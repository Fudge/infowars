[00:00.000 --> 00:23.200]  I don't think Hitler was a good guy.
[00:23.200 --> 00:28.400]  I get the Hugo Boss uniform, it's amazing, but I mean just because you're in love with
[00:28.400 --> 00:33.040]  the design, you're a designer, can we just kind of say, you like the uniforms, but that's
[00:33.040 --> 00:34.040]  about it.
[00:34.040 --> 00:42.160]  No, we know, there's a lot of things that I love about Hitler, a lot of things.
[00:42.160 --> 00:46.680]  I'm in the twilight zone right now.
[00:46.680 --> 00:50.120]  Netanyahu, what do you have to say?
[00:50.120 --> 00:53.680]  What do you have to say to Alex Jones right now, Nick Fuentes and yay?
[00:53.680 --> 01:02.440]  It was bad, it was bad for truck to meet with Nick and yay, okay.
[01:02.440 --> 01:08.120]  I had no idea your voice is going to sound like that Netanyahu.
[01:08.120 --> 01:11.240]  So you don't like Benjamin Netanyahu?
[01:11.240 --> 01:16.600]  I just heard about this guy two weeks ago since like the tweet and I thought he had
[01:16.600 --> 01:17.600]  a funny name.
[01:17.600 --> 01:22.280]  I heard he's like really into like, he's like a super killer, I could die for saying
[01:22.280 --> 01:23.280]  this.
[01:23.280 --> 01:27.600]  It's just the last time you ever hear from me.
[01:27.600 --> 01:34.400]  My accounts, because they've been frozen by Jewish banks, so I need to watch my meals.
[01:34.400 --> 01:38.960]  Well, CNN says why people are evil Nazis, so I mean, I disagree with both statements,
[01:38.960 --> 01:39.960]  but I get that.
[01:39.960 --> 01:41.800]  I don't like the word evil next to Nazis.
[01:41.800 --> 01:47.880]  I think we need to look at, oh my goodness, just because you don't like one group doesn't
[01:47.880 --> 01:48.880]  mean the other.
[01:48.880 --> 01:53.640]  I love Jewish people, but I also love Nazis.
[01:53.640 --> 01:56.240]  Oh man, well, I have to disagree with that.
[01:56.240 --> 02:01.120]  Hey, but listen, we're going to go to break, do I round up Jews in Nazi Germany, do I get
[02:01.120 --> 02:02.120]  loved in?
[02:02.120 --> 02:03.120]  Schwarzenegger said he loved Hitler.
[02:03.120 --> 02:04.120]  They gave him an award.
[02:04.120 --> 02:10.680]  I'm just saying, I don't like Nazis and I don't like what some of the mafias are doing either.
[02:10.680 --> 02:17.520]  My accounts, because they've been frozen by Jewish banks, so I need to watch my meals.
[02:17.520 --> 02:22.320]  CNN says why people are evil Nazis, so I mean, I disagree with both statements, but I get
[02:22.320 --> 02:23.320]  that.
[02:23.320 --> 02:24.880]  Yeah, I don't like the word evil next to Nazis.
[02:24.880 --> 02:30.920]  I think we need to look at, oh my goodness, just because you don't like one group doesn't
[02:30.920 --> 02:31.920]  mean the other.
[02:31.920 --> 02:35.520]  I love Jewish people, but I also love Nazis.
[02:35.520 --> 02:39.400]  Oh man, well, I have to disagree with that.
[02:39.400 --> 02:42.000]  Hey, but listen, we're going to go to break.
[02:42.000 --> 02:49.680]  So obviously there is a German side to World War I and World War II that a lot of people
[02:49.680 --> 02:52.480]  don't know and it's always good to pursue the truth.
[02:52.480 --> 02:57.520]  That being said, do I think Adolf Hitler and the Nazis were quote unquote good?
[02:57.520 --> 03:03.920]  No, I think that whoever's trying to get that ring of power is always going to use deception
[03:03.920 --> 03:07.120]  and force and all that stuff.
[03:07.120 --> 03:10.560]  Do I think there's a pretty high chance that he burned down his own Reichstag?
[03:10.560 --> 03:18.600]  Oh yeah, but the German people going towards the truth movement after the false and bank-driven
[03:18.600 --> 03:23.480]  World War I was good and they shouldn't be slandered for that.
[03:23.480 --> 03:29.640]  You know, the population of Germany was trying to reconnect with family and truth and getting
[03:29.640 --> 03:33.680]  rid of sin in their society and that's great, but I believe that once you get to puppet
[03:33.680 --> 03:39.160]  master level of politics, not even includes Putin, even though right now I believe Putin
[03:39.160 --> 03:47.400]  is leading his country well, but I think all of them are controlled on some level or else
[03:47.400 --> 03:53.600]  they wouldn't be allowed to be leaders of countries.
[03:53.600 --> 03:56.760]  Jones pimping 33 different kinds of pills and now a book.
[03:56.760 --> 04:00.800]  The big win will be when people get past the blame stage and get to the, I don't, yeah,
[04:00.800 --> 04:08.520]  and you know, that's, I can see that happening with a lot of people, that the blame stage
[04:08.520 --> 04:15.760]  is, the blame stage is hopefully passing by people quickly.
[04:15.760 --> 04:26.440]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[04:26.440 --> 04:30.800]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got
[04:30.800 --> 04:31.800]  one.

[06:16.920 --> 06:24.920]  It's Alex Jones and it's Friday, December 2nd, 2022.
[06:24.920 --> 06:26.640]  I know a lot of people are tuned in today.
[06:26.640 --> 06:31.320]  We have a record audience here staying today of over 40 extra million people that tuned
[06:31.320 --> 06:32.320]  in.
[06:32.320 --> 06:39.480]  Only another time we had a bigger audience was election night 2000 and 16 when Trump
[06:39.480 --> 06:44.360]  voted on that massive populous red wave and that obviously was Kanye West, formerly Kanye
[06:44.360 --> 06:51.360]  West, Yay West, in studio for three hours and ten minutes and everybody's tuning in
[06:51.360 --> 06:55.640]  want to know the inside baseball behind the scenes stuff and I do have all that with what
[06:55.640 --> 07:00.360]  happened with him and Elon Musk last night and Yay being banned on Twitter again and
[07:00.360 --> 07:03.520]  the aftermath and what really happened behind the scenes and all the rest of it and I'll
[07:03.520 --> 07:09.240]  be getting to that coming up in the last segment of this hour and then sum into the
[07:09.240 --> 07:13.760]  next hour but I've got to tell you it's important for free speech, it's important to know the
[07:13.760 --> 07:18.440]  behind the scenes what really went on and it's the top story in the world right now
[07:18.440 --> 07:24.120]  whereas potential nuclear war with Russia, global currency evaluations, the news coming
[07:24.120 --> 07:28.480]  out that indeed the so-called COVID shots are deadly and are causing mass illness, blood
[07:28.480 --> 07:37.320]  clots and death, that's really the biggest story and so quite frankly I'm almost tempted
[07:37.320 --> 07:41.360]  not to talk about the interview yesterday because we've got this giant audience of millions
[07:41.360 --> 07:49.000]  of new people that never tuned in and what we normally do is not wear gimp mask on air
[07:49.000 --> 07:56.400]  and talk about how we love Hitler, it was trolling at an epic level, I did not know
[07:56.400 --> 08:00.280]  that was going to happen, I had been told that they wanted to come here and kind of
[08:00.280 --> 08:03.440]  move into some other subjects and other issues, I said you can cover whatever you want and
[08:03.440 --> 08:08.240]  when the Jew stuff started I said okay I guess you're going to do the whole show on this
[08:08.240 --> 08:14.440]  and I believe in the First Amendment so I let you know Ye do that, he's left other interviews
[08:14.440 --> 08:18.520]  where they started erupting him so I let him say what he had to say, I told him I disagree
[08:18.520 --> 08:24.440]  with him and you know Ye is a savant, there's no doubt, I'm not even a huge fan of hip hop
[08:24.440 --> 08:29.640]  and rap but I do like the better stuff and his stuff is very varied, very complex and
[08:29.640 --> 08:34.360]  he's obviously a very smart man in ways but he even said he thinks he's autistic and so
[08:34.360 --> 08:38.120]  everybody being mean to him or people saying well even if he's autistic he's not allowed
[08:38.120 --> 08:44.600]  to say this, the guy is eccentric as it gets and is autistic okay so and I've gotten a
[08:44.600 --> 08:49.200]  chance to talk to him on the phone and over the past around him in person, the dude is
[08:49.200 --> 08:56.880]  autistic okay so I think he's a nice person, I don't think he means bad, he's obsessed
[08:56.880 --> 09:02.360]  with symbols and engineering and things like that and obviously the Nazis were as well,
[09:02.360 --> 09:05.600]  I mean hell the whole world basically adopted their designs and everything they did, that's
[09:05.600 --> 09:11.000]  how they sold Germans on getting on board with them was all the things they did but
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.240]  I'm going to break down what I really think happened and where this is all going coming
[09:14.240 --> 09:19.120]  up at the end of the hour but I need to hit the really big news first that's way more
[09:19.120 --> 09:21.720]  important quite frankly at the end of the day and I tried to get Ye to get into the
[09:21.720 --> 09:27.640]  poison shots and get into what it's really all about and the human depopulation operation
[09:27.640 --> 09:31.840]  but he didn't want to do that and I've invited him back on but I said listen you had your
[09:31.840 --> 09:41.600]  three hours of the whole Jew operation thing, I really want to get you on about other issues
[09:41.600 --> 09:45.840]  and we're also going to talk about the fact that he has a right to free speech and he
[09:45.840 --> 09:52.040]  shouldn't be silenced or censored obviously but just because I agree with someone's right
[09:52.040 --> 09:56.200]  to free speech it doesn't mean I have to agree with what they're saying or what they're doing
[09:56.200 --> 10:03.520]  now he got banned on Twitter last night for putting up a image of a sun symbol that's
[10:03.520 --> 10:09.600]  what the swastika is, it's an ancient symbol at least 6,000 years old found all over the
[10:09.600 --> 10:17.400]  Near East what's India today, what's the Middle East today and when he put it inside of the
[10:17.400 --> 10:25.400]  star of David which is really the seal of Solomon he put the Hindu or Sanskrit or Mesopotamian
[10:25.400 --> 10:30.840]  Babylonian sun symbol in there that you see all over temples all over the world, Buddhist
[10:30.840 --> 10:36.720]  and others and so they shouldn't ban the swastika, you shouldn't be banned for putting up a swastika
[10:36.720 --> 10:42.600]  off of Twitter anywhere else, a Nazi swastika that's been rotated 90 degrees, that's the
[10:42.600 --> 10:49.680]  Hitler swastika is a rolling swastika, this is not even a Nazi swastika he put up and
[10:49.680 --> 10:54.080]  by California law it's not even a hate symbol and I know what he was talking about yesterday
[10:54.080 --> 10:57.680]  because he was talking about bringing everybody together and loving everybody including Zionists
[10:57.680 --> 11:04.000]  and Nazis and that's what the symbol is supposed to say and so he shouldn't even be banned by
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.160]  Twitter under their rules for that, now their rules are obviously that you can't encourage
[11:10.160 --> 11:14.160]  violence against other people and I think it's really defamatory to say that he was encouraging
[11:14.160 --> 11:17.880]  violence against other people because he did not call for violence against anybody and
[11:17.880 --> 11:24.320]  he said he's anti-war but I'm done talking about yay for now, I don't mean that as an
[11:24.320 --> 11:29.800]  insult to say that he is autistic, you know a little trick I've been able to do and I
[11:29.800 --> 11:34.200]  think we're all a little bit autistic in different ways, you know savantish, idiot savantish in
[11:34.200 --> 11:38.120]  ways, is that I could, especially when I was younger, be given a whole bunch of numbers
[11:38.120 --> 11:44.240]  just spit out at me like 27, 145, 218 and then I could just almost always say the number
[11:44.240 --> 11:48.760]  if I didn't try, my brain just knew it, now that's a savantish type thing that we'll do,
[11:48.760 --> 11:55.880]  but I try to sit down and actually do math by hand I'm terrible at it, so there's thousands
[11:55.880 --> 11:59.920]  of different savantish things going on and I'm not giving him a total free pass for
[11:59.920 --> 12:03.840]  things he said that just aren't true, I mean I don't just need to read history books about
[12:03.840 --> 12:07.120]  Hitler, both my grandfathers were in World War II, they didn't like to talk about it,
[12:07.120 --> 12:12.040]  but believe me they were in Europe, especially my dad's dad, spent a lot of time in Europe,
[12:12.040 --> 12:17.840]  first in North Africa, then in Italy and then right into Germany and definitely said that
[12:17.840 --> 12:22.240]  what you've heard about definitely was going on, mile after mile after mile of dead people
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.400]  in these death camps, mile after mile after mile after mile after mile, people stacked
[12:26.400 --> 12:33.680]  up 40, 50, 100 feet and just the GIs pushing dead bodies with bulldozers into mass graves
[12:33.680 --> 12:38.920]  and then that's just what the Nazis hadn't gotten cleaned up by the time they turn and
[12:38.920 --> 12:44.240]  run at the end of 1949 or evacuated back to Berlin, so I'm not going to go over history
[12:44.240 --> 12:47.680]  lesson here but I'm actually quite a history buff, on World War II I probably read 300
[12:47.680 --> 12:52.040]  books on World War II, something I got into in high school and college and so I've read
[12:52.040 --> 12:57.440]  all the main books and I've also checked it with family and Hitler was absolutely horrible
[12:57.440 --> 13:02.960]  and 22 million Germans died, they killed 22 million Russians, that was the real war,
[13:02.960 --> 13:07.720]  90% of the war, the US and England were in the war but kind of like third ventures,
[13:07.720 --> 13:13.680]  okay, it was the Russians and the Germans point blank for three years killing each other,
[13:13.680 --> 13:17.960]  once Hitler snuck attack Russia with Operation Barbarossa, but see, Ye hasn't know about
[13:17.960 --> 13:22.120]  Operation Barbarossa, he hasn't read 10 books on Operation Barbarossa, he hasn't read Julius
[13:22.120 --> 13:26.040]  Caesar's Battle for Gaul like I have, he hasn't read the writings of Napoleon Bonaparte, he
[13:26.040 --> 13:29.760]  hasn't read Mein Kampf, he hasn't read Mein Struggle, he hasn't read Adolf Hitler's book,
[13:29.760 --> 13:36.680]  so he doesn't know what he's talking about, Hitler was a complete psychopathic devil worshiper,
[13:36.680 --> 13:42.120]  he was not a Christian, he wanted to outlaw Christianity, he was an occultist, period,
[13:42.120 --> 13:46.240]  it's an absolute fact but I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to stop right there, he
[13:46.240 --> 13:51.760]  was a pedophile, he had his niece that he was screwing for 10 years, sometimes she was
[13:51.760 --> 13:57.920]  10 years old, she shot her mouth off, killed, but again, he was a method, he was nerve
[13:57.920 --> 14:04.040]  gas twice in World War I, had their Congressional Medal of Honor, first class Iron Cross, he
[14:04.040 --> 14:09.840]  was a war hero, but the point is, is that he got nerve gas the second time and thought
[14:09.840 --> 14:16.200]  he was the Messiah when he came out of his coma, but see that's the frustration here,
[14:16.200 --> 14:20.000]  I can tell you all about Hitler because I found it very interesting and actually researched
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.240]  it, so I'm not mad at yay, he doesn't know what he's talking about, Hitler's bad, I
[14:25.240 --> 14:30.680]  can also tell you he's bad, the ADL would like to be Hitler, the ADL's anti-American,
[14:30.680 --> 14:34.840]  anti-free speech, lying criminal organization, literally involved in the censorship and control
[14:34.840 --> 14:38.560]  of this country, trying to take over, and there is as big a threat to America as Adolf
[14:38.560 --> 14:44.320]  Alois Hitler was, and so that's the bottom line here, ladies and gentlemen, all right
[14:44.320 --> 14:50.320]  I said I wouldn't get into this story first, but I'm starting to, oh it's so frustrating,
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.880]  but Hitler was a competing eugenics model, the British had their plan, they've actually
[14:54.880 --> 14:59.000]  read the writings of Hitler and Göring and Joseph Goebbels, they were competing with
[14:59.000 --> 15:09.000]  who, who were they competing with, H.G. Wells and who else, that's right Cecil Rhodes, the
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.720]  Nazis stole their plan for what you now seeing being rolled out worldwide through the medical
[15:13.720 --> 15:18.960]  tyranny is depopulation of eugenics, and Hitler basically launched his own program, but against
[15:18.960 --> 15:24.240]  different groups, the globalists want to poison and dumb down and finally medicalize
[15:24.240 --> 15:31.240]  everybody and kill 90-plus percent of us, they make Hitler look like a lightweight,
[15:31.240 --> 15:38.120]  you understand that, H.G. Wells didn't just write science fiction, he was the top futurist
[15:38.120 --> 15:46.400]  for the British crown, that's why he wrote about atomic weapons in the 1890s, oh yeah,
[15:46.400 --> 15:50.080]  the technology is a lot more advanced they tell you, when we come back though, the biggest
[15:50.080 --> 15:55.320]  news yet on the COVID front, Rand Paul calls out Fauci and says he murdered people, he created

[19:50.560 --> 19:56.120]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil, just like

[20:23.200 --> 20:27.360]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central with a Sunday show as well, don't forget,
[20:27.360 --> 20:28.360]  I'm Troyer.
[20:28.360 --> 20:32.840]  3 p.m. Central, the warms coming up today at every weekday morning, 8 a.m. American Journal
[20:32.840 --> 20:34.840]  with the great Harrison Smith.
[20:34.840 --> 20:39.520]  All right, let's, let me do this this segment, because I've been through it last segment,
[20:39.520 --> 20:45.560]  I went on a whole rant about yay and tell the prelude what I'll be covering a little
[20:45.560 --> 20:47.160]  bit later in the hour and next hour.
[20:47.160 --> 20:50.960]  But let's talk about what is coming up today that's so big.
[20:50.960 --> 20:54.000]  Senator Paul has done what should be done and what I've been calling for when I called
[20:54.000 --> 20:55.880]  for last week.
[20:55.880 --> 21:01.560]  We know Fauci created COVID-19, we have all the documents, we told you this in February
[21:01.560 --> 21:06.880]  and March of 2020, we had top biological weapons experts, the author of the U.S. Biological
[21:06.880 --> 21:13.480]  Chemical Weapons Laws, the former top UN prosecutor on these weapons, on to tell you that we
[21:13.480 --> 21:18.000]  had the documents that he specifically created, gain of function, COVID-19, they had it prepared
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.000]  in 2018.
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.680]  They called it COVID-19, they released it, they came to the Pentagon when Trump was in
[21:24.680 --> 21:28.640]  office and said, oh, we're going to release it to study stuff in caves in China, and Trump
[21:28.640 --> 21:29.640]  said no.
[21:29.640 --> 21:33.000]  They were trying to set Trump up with not just getting him to push the poison mRNA shots
[21:33.000 --> 21:39.080]  that aren't vaccines, but also to sign on to releasing it in China.
[21:39.080 --> 21:42.520]  That's London Telegraph, broke that a year and a half after we broke it.
[21:42.520 --> 21:45.280]  We've got the inside scoop on all this.
[21:45.280 --> 21:49.960]  So Paul has come out specifically and said, you gain a function, you lied to Congress,
[21:49.960 --> 21:54.480]  and now we know at Boston University, and at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, not just in
[21:54.480 --> 22:00.200]  Boston, Massachusetts, and also in London, Fauci and the NIH have funded three other
[22:00.200 --> 22:06.320]  gain of function programs with COVID-19, weaponizing it in humanized mice, which have the exact
[22:06.320 --> 22:13.200]  same effect, the pathogens on those mice as humans, they're mice, human chimeric clones.
[22:13.200 --> 22:17.240]  People who actually don't exist, that's 40 years old, okay?
[22:17.240 --> 22:22.480]  But the point is, is that they then rolled all of this out, and they weaponized it where
[22:22.480 --> 22:25.120]  it kills 80% of the mice.
[22:25.120 --> 22:29.400]  So not a COVID that kills less than 1% of people, one that kills 80% of those that get
[22:29.400 --> 22:30.400]  infected, okay?
[22:30.400 --> 22:36.080]  Doesn't mean it kills 80% of people, it means if you get infected, 80% die.
[22:36.080 --> 22:39.480]  The whole point is you don't wanna get infected whenever your immune system boosts and going.
[22:39.480 --> 22:41.760]  But that's what these psychos are making.
[22:41.760 --> 22:46.840]  There were huge scandal that Obama was funding this in 2015 with Fauci, they just put the
[22:46.840 --> 22:50.360]  scientists magazine up there about it, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[22:50.360 --> 22:54.640]  So for Fauci to get up there, this is a huge scandal in 2015 that he was doing it and said
[22:54.640 --> 23:00.240]  they've never had gain of function when he ran conferences titled, In Support of Gain
[23:00.240 --> 23:07.920]  of Function Research, and had C-SPAN discussions about supporting gain of function.
[23:07.920 --> 23:13.640]  So we have him, but now Senator Paul has come out and said, we have you, we have the proof,
[23:13.640 --> 23:19.400]  we've caught you red-handed, and he also said you will not get away.
[23:19.400 --> 23:22.320]  So I don't want any political violence, I don't want any extra-judicial violence, I
[23:22.320 --> 23:27.640]  don't want anybody to harm a hare or a whisker on his chinny-chin-chin.
[23:27.640 --> 23:33.840]  Really should harm Dazik or Fauci or Gates or any of them until they've been indicted,
[23:33.840 --> 23:38.080]  until they've been convicted, and then you know what needs to happen to them for biological
[23:38.080 --> 23:42.080]  weapons development and release against the people.
[23:42.080 --> 23:47.600]  It's more than just life in a supermax, that's what the U.S. code states.
[23:47.600 --> 23:51.640]  These people need to be in a lot of trouble for what they've done.
[23:51.640 --> 23:55.400]  So next segment I'm gonna drill into all of that, played part of the interview that Senator
[23:55.400 --> 24:00.820]  Paul did last night on Fox News and so much more.
[24:00.820 --> 24:06.240]  Then we've got the British government admitting that there are triple the normal rate of deaths
[24:06.240 --> 24:11.160]  happening in the U.K. that were happening just three years ago, and it's not COVID.
[24:11.160 --> 24:13.280]  Of course it's not, it's the shots.
[24:13.280 --> 24:16.280]  So we're gonna be getting to all of that incredibly important information, and then we're gonna
[24:16.280 --> 24:17.640]  explain why they're doing it.
[24:17.640 --> 24:22.080]  Got a stack of articles from mainstream news here, how it's gonna be good to depopulate
[24:22.080 --> 24:26.000]  the earth, and how wonderful it'll be when there's no more humans, and how shouldn't
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.920]  we all agree we're a bad species, and should we be gotten rid of?
[24:28.920 --> 24:33.680]  Here's Atlantic Monthly, the people shearing for humanity's end, but if they can't do it
[24:33.680 --> 24:37.040]  right away with a bio weapon, they're gonna do it with abortion, sterilization, the transgender
[24:37.040 --> 24:42.240]  movement that is admittedly assisted to make it popular to sterilize autistic and other
[24:42.240 --> 24:43.880]  handicapped individuals.
[24:43.880 --> 24:47.920]  Planned Parenthood's sexual education director claims that all children are born sexual.
[24:47.920 --> 24:52.280]  We're gonna explain how that's a form of birth control that can screw them up early, and
[24:52.280 --> 24:57.680]  what the statistics show, and kill their trajectory, and then that ties into Avatar director James
[24:57.680 --> 25:03.280]  Cameron says testosterone is a toxin, men must terminate from their system.
[25:03.280 --> 25:07.280]  So that's what this entire agenda is, we're gonna be getting to all of that.
[25:07.280 --> 25:11.840]  We're gonna look at the Herschel-Walker race in Georgia, and how they're already getting
[25:11.840 --> 25:16.080]  ready to steal it, pre-programming that he's lost, he's failed, everyone's hurrying against
[25:16.080 --> 25:17.080]  him.
[25:17.080 --> 25:20.200]  We're gonna be pre-programming that, and everybody said we'll look at the actual numbers on that
[25:20.200 --> 25:21.700]  front as well.
[25:21.700 --> 25:25.920]  We'll also look at the economy in November jobs reports, and what's happening with real
[25:25.920 --> 25:30.320]  inflation numbers, and a lot more coming up here today.
[25:30.320 --> 25:34.640]  And then we have Mike Adams joining us, investigative journalist of Natural News, breaking some
[25:34.640 --> 25:38.840]  major, major news, and I'm just gonna leave it at that, that's coming up in the third
[25:38.840 --> 25:39.840]  hour.
[25:39.840 --> 25:45.120]  I also intend to open the phones up here today, and I'm tempted I might come in Saturday, I'm
[25:45.120 --> 25:47.800]  thinking about, I don't talk to the crew, because they just over break.
[25:47.800 --> 25:50.920]  I might do a three hour live show tomorrow, that's internet only, and just take phone
[25:50.920 --> 25:56.560]  calls, because I do want to hear from all of you on those fronts as well.
[25:56.560 --> 25:59.320]  And then there's more censorship news we're gonna get to.
[25:59.320 --> 26:06.600]  The second largest church in Ukraine has been banned, because it has an association with
[26:06.600 --> 26:07.600]  Russians.
[26:07.600 --> 26:12.880]  Well, Russia was founded a thousand years ago, in what is Ukraine today, it translates
[26:12.880 --> 26:17.040]  out to like, slob the wise, that's what they're called slobs, that's this one guy, Russia
[26:17.040 --> 26:22.000]  was founded in Ukraine, then it got conquered by the Muslims for about 110 years, and then
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.720]  there was only one group of slobs left that had control, that was the Moscow tribe.
[26:26.720 --> 26:32.520]  They re-invaded in a multi-year war that killed, estimated hundreds of thousands of people,
[26:32.520 --> 26:36.800]  kicked the Muslims out, and so that's why the new capital of the slobs was Moscow.
[26:36.800 --> 26:42.480]  This is all a Slavic civil war, but AP reports it like it's no big deal.
[26:42.480 --> 26:48.720]  And it bans religious organizations with links to Russia, and it goes on to say, the Orthodox
[26:48.720 --> 26:55.480]  Church of Ukraine, which was founded by slob the wise, he has a longer name, that's the
[26:55.480 --> 26:56.480]  boil down.
[26:56.480 --> 27:06.400]  So, the founding church of Ukraine, over a thousand years ago, is now banned in Ukraine,
[27:06.400 --> 27:11.120]  boy isn't Solyansky a Democrat, isn't he a nice guy, isn't he a wonderful person.
[27:11.120 --> 27:15.520]  That doesn't mean I defend the Russians, but this is a Slavic civil war, and now a proxy
[27:15.520 --> 27:21.840]  war leading into a larger full war between NATO and Russia that could end civilization
[27:21.840 --> 27:24.120]  on this planet as we know.
[27:24.120 --> 27:29.520]  So that is a big, big deal, outlawing the second largest church in Ukraine.
[27:29.520 --> 27:34.160]  All right, we're going to go to break, and I'm going to come back with some other big
[27:34.160 --> 27:39.440]  financial news concerning not just the economy, not just you individually, but this broadcast,
[27:39.440 --> 27:44.240]  some of the biggest news concerning the future of in full wars ever on the other side of
[27:44.240 --> 27:50.520]  this break, and our ability to stay on air and be able to cover things and push for things
[27:50.520 --> 27:53.160]  and expose things that they don't want getting out.
[27:53.160 --> 27:57.720]  And nine times out of 10, we are credited by enemies of freedom and lovers of freedom.
[27:57.720 --> 28:01.920]  We're credited by George Soros, and we're credited by the UN, and we're credited by
[28:01.920 --> 28:06.360]  Klaus Schwab, and we're credited by all of them as being the vector of the evil populism.
[28:06.360 --> 28:12.840]  But we're also credited by Tucker Carlson and so many others as being the main progenitor
[28:12.840 --> 28:17.440]  of the major talking points based in truth that are countering the entire globalist narrative.
[28:17.440 --> 28:22.720]  So I'm extremely honored to be in that position, but to stay in that position, it takes money
[28:22.720 --> 28:25.520]  to fight a war, and that's what we're in a war.
[28:25.520 --> 28:28.320]  So I'm not going to just come back and plug some products and tell you to give us money.
[28:28.320 --> 28:31.880]  I'm going to give you the big financial news about info wars and about its future and about
[28:31.880 --> 28:36.080]  my future, and really just let you know that it is 100% in your hands.
[28:36.080 --> 28:40.320]  It's like your destiny is in your own hands, and your soul is in your own hands, your decision
[28:40.320 --> 28:42.600]  with free will, whether to love God or not.
[28:42.600 --> 28:45.000]  And it's also in your hands whether we're going to stay on air.
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.040]  So I have total confidence that it's up to God and working through you, and God works
[28:49.040 --> 28:52.560]  through you that if you want us to stay on air, you will, but I've got some big news
[28:52.560 --> 28:53.560]  on the other side.
[28:53.560 --> 28:55.760]  I declared personal bankruptcy this morning.
[28:55.760 --> 29:01.040]  We'll tell you more about it straight ahead.
[29:01.040 --> 29:06.680]  October 2022 is here, and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping
[29:06.680 --> 29:09.560]  is back at infowarstore.com.
[29:09.560 --> 29:10.560]  That's right.
[29:10.560 --> 29:16.520]  Free shipping on all orders of $50 or more, but we've signed a new deal with a big national
[29:16.520 --> 29:22.400]  shipping company, and they're able to cut our regular shipping cost by up to 50%.
[29:22.400 --> 29:26.920]  So that means even on orders that are below $50, you're going to be paying way lower than
[29:26.920 --> 29:27.920]  you were previously.
[29:27.920 --> 29:32.800]  This is a game changer, we're so excited about it, our listeners have really asked for free
[29:32.800 --> 29:33.800]  shipping again.
[29:33.800 --> 29:37.800]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able
[29:37.800 --> 29:38.800]  to do it.
[29:38.800 --> 29:43.880]  So now your orders will be shipped even faster, the same great customer service and more.
[29:43.880 --> 29:49.920]  So get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at infowarstore.com right
[29:49.920 --> 29:50.920]  now.
[29:50.920 --> 29:53.960]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune
[29:53.960 --> 29:54.960]  system.
[29:54.960 --> 30:00.600]  We'll keep you all the year alive and keep invoars on the air at infowarstore.com.
[30:00.600 --> 30:05.320]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here, we've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[30:05.320 --> 30:11.080]  Now the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[30:11.080 --> 30:15.680]  The bad news is by Christmas almost every product in the store will be sold out, we
[30:15.680 --> 30:17.720]  won't get more for months and months and months.
[30:17.720 --> 30:21.640]  So now is the time to take action to support the infowar and get the biggest sales of the
[30:21.640 --> 30:22.640]  year.
[30:22.640 --> 30:27.120]  We're going to be sold out of X2 and X3 and Biotru Selenium and our Wake Up America award
[30:27.120 --> 30:33.320]  winning coffee and now DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[30:33.320 --> 30:38.320]  So many other great products like Ultimate Crill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaso Beats, Secret
[30:38.320 --> 30:43.600]  12, they are all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[30:43.600 --> 30:47.760]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today, so every hour you wait, more stuff will be
[30:47.760 --> 30:54.360]  sold out at infowarstore.com, promo code 1776 and you get an additional 10% off the already
[30:54.360 --> 30:56.360]  giant savings at infowarstore.com.
[30:56.360 --> 31:00.400]  Thank you so much for your support, God bless.
[31:00.400 --> 31:02.960]  I've got some good news and bad news.
[31:02.960 --> 31:08.040]  Info Wars is running the biggest sale of 2022 right now on our amazing products.
[31:08.040 --> 31:11.760]  Your chance to empower your body, your health, your immune system and more and keep us on
[31:11.760 --> 31:13.520]  the air a win-win.
[31:13.520 --> 31:17.800]  The bad news is a bunch of our best selling products have already sold out because of
[31:17.800 --> 31:21.160]  supply chain breakdowns, it will be months and months until these great products come
[31:21.160 --> 31:22.160]  back in.
[31:22.160 --> 31:29.000]  X3's sold out, our great American coffee blend has sold out, Biotru Selenium has sold out
[31:29.000 --> 31:35.640]  but what hasn't sold out is DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric
[31:35.640 --> 31:42.600]  Formula, Whole Food Multivitamin, Rain Force Ultra, Super Mill Vitality and so much more.
[31:42.600 --> 31:47.080]  So you've only got a few weeks to get these products at the lowest price you're ever
[31:47.080 --> 31:48.080]  going to find them.
[31:48.080 --> 31:51.480]  Don't fight the crowds, don't fight the traffic, don't do all your Christmas shopping
[31:51.480 --> 31:56.680]  in a month like a fool, do it now, get it all over with, get a great deal, keep Info Wars
[31:56.680 --> 32:00.640]  on the air while empowering your body, infowarstore.com.
[32:00.640 --> 32:06.000]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican
[32:06.000 --> 32:10.960]  victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[32:10.960 --> 32:16.600]  possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[32:16.600 --> 32:22.400]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, made any
[32:22.400 --> 32:28.080]  resistance to it possible was people continuing to support Info Wars, despite the massive
[32:28.080 --> 32:34.000]  lawfare being waged against Info Wars, despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against
[32:34.000 --> 32:39.240]  Info Wars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own
[32:39.240 --> 32:44.720]  lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps Info Wars on the air and what that does
[32:44.720 --> 32:50.280]  is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[32:50.280 --> 32:56.360]  So continue to do it, go to places like infowarstore.com, go to the places like Save Info Wars, continue
[32:56.360 --> 33:01.720]  to keep Info Wars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[33:01.720 --> 33:19.760]  Pleading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:19.760 --> 33:24.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[33:24.360 --> 33:32.440]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:32.440 --> 33:37.920]  So welcome the millions and millions and millions and millions and millions more of new listeners
[33:37.920 --> 33:44.320]  and viewers tuning in at infowars.com and radio and TV stations dotted across this fine nation
[33:44.320 --> 33:45.320]  and the world.
[33:45.320 --> 33:49.560]  Again, I'm your host Alex Jones, a lot of you are tuning in for the first time, maybe
[33:49.560 --> 33:50.560]  the second time.
[33:50.560 --> 33:51.560]  What's this all about?
[33:51.560 --> 33:57.200]  What happened with Yeh, formerly Kanye West here yesterday, I'll get to that more next
[33:57.200 --> 33:58.400]  hour.
[33:58.400 --> 34:03.640]  But it's important to understand that the battle to take us off the air has nothing to do with
[34:03.640 --> 34:08.480]  Sandy Hook, nothing to do with stuff the media is taking and blowing up out of context.
[34:08.480 --> 34:12.440]  It's about setting a precedent to take everybody off the air that is going to oppose this globalist
[34:12.440 --> 34:15.120]  New World Order, great reset that's now out in the open.
[34:15.120 --> 34:19.200]  And because we've been vindicated in my 28 years of work and your work and all of our
[34:19.200 --> 34:23.880]  work together exposing this and all the countless guests and experts we've had on, they have
[34:23.880 --> 34:28.560]  to get us off the air because the credibility is gone away up and people are listening.
[34:28.560 --> 34:30.060]  It's very, very simple.
[34:30.060 --> 34:32.960]  So here's the long and short of it.
[34:32.960 --> 34:40.160]  I've never run this show as the goal to amass wealth, though I do like living in a nice
[34:40.160 --> 34:42.040]  house and don't take care of my family.
[34:42.040 --> 34:47.840]  But I would lose all of that today and go to prison or be lined up against a wall and
[34:47.840 --> 34:51.720]  I'd shot if we could snap our fingers and I could give my life or I'm sure you would
[34:51.720 --> 34:55.400]  do it if you give your life for your children and grandchildren.
[34:55.400 --> 34:58.080]  I'd do this because I know it's true and I know the globalists are evil.
[34:58.080 --> 34:59.800]  I know what they're doing is corrupt and bad.
[34:59.800 --> 35:04.520]  And so that's my main impetus for doing this, though it takes money to operate.
[35:04.520 --> 35:06.960]  It takes money to stay on air.
[35:06.960 --> 35:13.880]  And so in the last six years, there was a major PR campaign by the Democratic Party that even
[35:13.880 --> 35:18.800]  hired top PR firms, all just came out in the last two months, what we suspected was all
[35:18.800 --> 35:23.360]  confirmed the main PR firm out of New York that does the UN's PR, the Democratic Party's
[35:23.360 --> 35:25.840]  PR, much their PR.
[35:25.840 --> 35:30.840]  They did opposition research against Info Wars for supporting Trump and said, what has he
[35:30.840 --> 35:36.000]  done that we can really get him on and then say that he's Trump's brain?
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.880]  And they said, well, everything he's done, we could take this out of context, him doing
[35:39.880 --> 35:45.440]  23 minutes over a few years questioning Sandy Hook like he questions so many other big events.
[35:45.440 --> 35:48.880]  Not a story we've pre-generated, not a story we first created, but we covered the Internet
[35:48.880 --> 35:49.880]  having questions.
[35:49.880 --> 35:55.560]  It was a non-issue in 2015 and 16 and even 17 to a great extent.
[35:55.560 --> 35:56.560]  It wasn't even in the news.
[35:56.560 --> 35:58.760]  When I got banned off Twitter, it was for other reasons.
[35:58.760 --> 36:00.600]  You didn't even see Sandy Hook mention.
[36:00.600 --> 36:06.840]  So they built Sandy Hook up in late 2016-17, ran national news stories everywhere, coordinated
[36:06.840 --> 36:14.040]  with the Democrats in the deep state to make me the Sandy Hook guy and then sue me.
[36:14.040 --> 36:17.520]  But then once they sued me, they didn't have any proof or evidence of what they claimed
[36:17.520 --> 36:23.640]  I did, so they had judges default me in Texas and Connecticut so they could then say I was
[36:23.640 --> 36:29.200]  guilty unprecedented and then have juries be part of their little show trials to decide
[36:29.200 --> 36:31.360]  how guilty I was.
[36:31.360 --> 36:34.680]  We couldn't defend ourselves, we couldn't put on evidence.
[36:34.680 --> 36:38.600]  Once in the judge in Texas, just came out two weeks ago, it was big national news, they
[36:38.600 --> 36:42.520]  said despite state law, she says Jones will pay 50 million, though state law says it's
[36:42.520 --> 36:43.520]  capped at five.
[36:43.520 --> 36:45.760]  And she said, I don't care what the law says.
[36:45.760 --> 36:48.480]  She had a bunch of other unprecedented stuff as well saying, well, even though the jury
[36:48.480 --> 36:52.200]  didn't hear these charges, we're going to let the plaintiffs lawyers say Jones is guilty
[36:52.200 --> 36:56.000]  of elder abuse and all of a sudden weird stuff, she said, yes, the jury finds them guilty
[36:56.000 --> 36:57.000]  of that too.
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.360]  So she didn't just find me guilty and then tell them I'm guilty and then have them find
[37:00.360 --> 37:02.440]  me guilty again under her order.
[37:02.440 --> 37:06.600]  She then said they also found me guilty of stuff they never had put before them in their
[37:06.600 --> 37:07.600]  jury charge.
[37:07.600 --> 37:12.760]  I mean, this is just the most flagrant, absurd fraud the world can even imagine, but it's
[37:12.760 --> 37:15.480]  judicial tyranny, it's the system making a move.
[37:15.480 --> 37:19.360]  It doesn't mean all the judicial systems and everything are corrupt yet, but this process
[37:19.360 --> 37:21.680]  of globalist takeover is here.
[37:21.680 --> 37:27.800]  So first it's a 900 and something million dollar verdict, almost a billion and then
[37:27.800 --> 37:36.280]  the judge adds on 400 and something million and so it's now up at 1.5 billion plus.
[37:36.280 --> 37:40.960]  And you know, just a couple of years ago, I had an emergency backup of a couple of million
[37:40.960 --> 37:41.960]  dollars.
[37:41.960 --> 37:42.960]  That's all gone.
[37:42.960 --> 37:44.880]  I've got a couple hundred thousand dollars now in the bank.
[37:44.880 --> 37:45.880]  That's completely unempty.
[37:45.880 --> 37:49.600]  If you're somebody as big as I am with all my bills, it's actually a liberating feeling
[37:49.600 --> 37:54.240]  because I've told the truth, I've done my best, I've made mistakes, but I'm here targeted
[37:54.240 --> 38:01.000]  by a powerful power structure that's just using PR firms and families as their shield
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.600]  to come after the first amendment, not just the second amendment.
[38:04.600 --> 38:11.760]  And so as this progressed, and I did bankruptcy with free speech systems, it was maxed out
[38:11.760 --> 38:15.600]  and basically going in solvent and they were lying and saying I had hundreds of millions
[38:15.600 --> 38:18.760]  of dollars and letting witnesses get on the stand that are supposedly financial experts
[38:18.760 --> 38:23.720]  with no proof of just making up, I've got $400 million and the company's got all this money.
[38:23.720 --> 38:24.720]  None of it true.
[38:24.720 --> 38:28.200]  Alice in Wonderland, complete fiction.
[38:28.200 --> 38:30.880]  And then they still said to the court, even though it was proven not to be true, no, he's
[38:30.880 --> 38:31.880]  got all this money.
[38:31.880 --> 38:35.440]  Well, I'm officially out of money personally and it's all going to be filed, it's going
[38:35.440 --> 38:43.280]  to be public and you will see that Alex Jones has almost no cash and is, if you add their
[38:43.280 --> 38:49.480]  judgments against me, in the hole for over a billion, $500 million.
[38:49.480 --> 38:53.360]  Now they put those big numbers out to crush our will and to crush your will and to make
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.520]  you think, well, that's so big, he's going off the air, we better just stop supporting
[38:57.520 --> 38:58.520]  him.
[38:58.520 --> 39:01.800]  And they said, don't bet on Alex Jones at press conferences, don't buy his products,
[39:01.800 --> 39:03.840]  he's going off air, we're going to win.
[39:03.840 --> 39:06.120]  They don't want us to appeal these cases.
[39:06.120 --> 39:08.680]  They will be overturned or the country's gone anyways.
[39:08.680 --> 39:10.080]  They don't want us to stay on air.
[39:10.080 --> 39:14.760]  They've admitted, played the clips in both cases, they want us off air.
[39:14.760 --> 39:15.760]  That's their goal.
[39:15.760 --> 39:17.800]  They don't want money for these families.
[39:17.800 --> 39:20.760]  Any of this with those claims, they want me off air.
[39:20.760 --> 39:22.240]  They've said that.
[39:22.240 --> 39:23.520]  They've repeated it all over the news.
[39:23.520 --> 39:28.640]  They've done countless interviews, but we're not going to let them do that.
[39:28.640 --> 39:33.520]  But at the same time, if I am personally completely out of money and obviously can never even
[39:33.520 --> 39:37.880]  pay these fake debts and these fake judgments, then I have to declare bankruptcy and this
[39:37.880 --> 39:44.360]  is a hundred percent needed and probably should have been done a long time ago.
[39:44.360 --> 39:50.040]  But I followed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in Houston this morning and now under penalty
[39:50.040 --> 39:54.400]  of perjury and the whole nine yards, it's all going to be right there that they have
[39:54.400 --> 39:57.680]  misrepresented everything and you're going to know the absolute truth and that I told
[39:57.680 --> 40:02.320]  you the absolute truth and nothing but the truth on my children's souls.
[40:02.320 --> 40:05.160]  And so they are in a panic.
[40:05.160 --> 40:09.160]  According to what my lawyer, a witness in court in Connecticut this morning, they are
[40:09.160 --> 40:14.960]  just absolutely flabbergasted because I believe, they believe that their own BS that I had
[40:14.960 --> 40:15.960]  all this money.
[40:15.960 --> 40:20.240]  So here's my statement on this and I'm not making further statements on it after this,
[40:20.240 --> 40:22.120]  but here's the official statement.
[40:22.120 --> 40:26.000]  Early this morning, I filed a voluntary petition for chapter 11 in Houston, Texas.
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.080]  The Alex Jones show will continue as before, but with a greater purpose.
[40:30.080 --> 40:35.320]  The chapter 11 will allow for all of the litigation as well as any disputes regarding my assets
[40:35.320 --> 40:39.880]  and liabilities to be handled by the same bankruptcy court handling the free speech system chapter
[40:39.880 --> 40:40.880]  11 case.
[40:40.880 --> 40:43.920]  And the same judge was appointed by the federal court to this.
[40:43.920 --> 40:46.120]  That's not our doing, that just happened.
[40:46.120 --> 40:51.000]  While FSS and I intend to appeal the Texas and Connecticut judgments collectively now
[40:51.000 --> 40:57.240]  more than $1.5 billion, it is my intent to proceed with the chapter 11 in a good faith
[40:57.240 --> 41:04.120]  and to attempt to reach amicable resolutions with my creditors as the Alex Jones show moves
[41:04.120 --> 41:05.400]  forward with greater purpose.
[41:05.400 --> 41:06.400]  So will I.
[41:06.400 --> 41:12.880]  Now, I'm done talking about that, but here's the bottom line.
[41:12.880 --> 41:14.000]  I know we're in a recession.
[41:14.000 --> 41:15.360]  I know things are falling apart.
[41:15.360 --> 41:16.960]  We see all the numbers.
[41:16.960 --> 41:19.760]  This is very simply put, I'm in your hands.
[41:19.760 --> 41:22.160]  This operation's in your hands.
[41:22.160 --> 41:24.560]  You need this operation to stay on air.
[41:24.560 --> 41:29.240]  So everybody needs to go to infowarstore.com and then you get great products that empower
[41:29.240 --> 41:32.960]  your life, your libido, your energy, your immune system.
[41:32.960 --> 41:36.040]  Most importantly, with the biggest sales of the year, because we're barely treading water
[41:36.040 --> 41:41.600]  at free speech to be able to be successful and stay on the air in this bankruptcy, because
[41:41.600 --> 41:42.600]  that's what it is.
[41:42.600 --> 41:46.000]  It's chapter 11, sub-chapter five, but we're doing okay and we'll be able to fund things
[41:46.000 --> 41:47.000]  and move forward.
[41:47.000 --> 41:48.000]  Thanks for your support.
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.840]  I personally, and paid a paltry amount to what I was paid before, out of this, that's
[41:52.840 --> 41:53.840]  fine.
[41:53.840 --> 41:57.480]  I don't care about the money, but I care about staying on air.
[41:57.480 --> 41:58.480]  So I'm not quitting.
[41:58.480 --> 42:02.320]  I'm not giving up and I'm counting on you not to give up as well.
[42:02.320 --> 42:06.760]  We have a hundred percent chance of succeeding and exposing this and going through the appeals
[42:06.760 --> 42:11.040]  and staying on air as long as I'm healthy and as long as I'm able to and as long as
[42:11.040 --> 42:15.320]  the nuclear war doesn't break out, if you fund InfoWars.
[42:15.320 --> 42:16.880]  So you're the variable.
[42:16.880 --> 42:17.880]  Everything is in your hands.
[42:17.880 --> 42:20.040]  It is your decision and I'm not guilting you.
[42:20.040 --> 42:21.680]  I'm not saying you better do this.
[42:21.680 --> 42:25.480]  I'm saying it's a choice you've got to make to commit to get great products you need in
[42:25.480 --> 42:30.960]  books and films and so many other great products at InfoWarsStore.com, like vitamin mineral
[42:30.960 --> 42:38.800]  fusion, DNA Force Plus, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus,
[42:38.800 --> 42:42.800]  Body's Complete, so much more, Knockout Ultimate Sleep Formula.
[42:42.800 --> 42:48.920]  It's all at InfoWarsStore.com or call toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[42:48.920 --> 42:49.920]  I am in your hands.
[42:49.920 --> 42:51.160]  You are in my hands.
[42:51.160 --> 42:53.040]  We're up against the deep state and the globalist.
[42:53.040 --> 42:54.240]  I've got the little guys.

[44:00.400 --> 44:07.000]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting
[44:07.000 --> 44:13.840]  these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[44:13.840 --> 44:20.080]  when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day and that's the problem
[44:20.080 --> 44:23.080]  and everything changed after COVID-19.
[44:23.080 --> 44:30.000]  They illegally changed state elections, mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.080]  mailing multiple ballots to people.
[44:32.080 --> 44:34.360]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[44:34.360 --> 44:39.280]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this and I believe
[44:39.280 --> 44:44.360]  that just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying
[44:44.360 --> 44:49.760]  that and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our
[44:49.760 --> 44:56.600]  election integrity and question the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[44:56.600 --> 45:00.920]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[45:00.920 --> 45:05.920]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by InfoWarsLife.
[45:05.920 --> 45:12.520]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels, most men know that testosterone
[45:12.520 --> 45:18.960]  levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[45:18.960 --> 45:26.160]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[45:26.160 --> 45:30.640]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on
[45:30.640 --> 45:31.640]  the market.
[45:31.640 --> 45:38.160]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated
[45:38.160 --> 45:45.120]  into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia originally from Malaysia, makaroo
[45:45.120 --> 45:51.120]  from Peru, horny goatweed from China and tribulus from India.

[46:00.320 --> 46:07.240]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[46:07.240 --> 46:11.800]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[46:11.800 --> 46:16.240]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[46:16.240 --> 46:21.120]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[46:21.120 --> 46:24.680]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[46:24.680 --> 46:31.480]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3, but if you're not getting
[46:31.480 --> 46:36.560]  enough sun you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[46:36.560 --> 46:39.380]  things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[46:39.380 --> 46:43.320]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[46:43.320 --> 46:48.120]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into

[47:01.000 --> 47:17.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:17.480 --> 47:32.320]  Well, Fauci can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, sooner or later the truth
[47:32.320 --> 47:35.320]  is going to cut him down.
[47:35.320 --> 47:41.920]  So we need to address this for what it is, a criminal out of control mad scientist group
[47:41.920 --> 47:48.040]  of eugenicists who openly call for depopulation, Fauci, Bill Gates, that whole coterie, that
[47:48.040 --> 47:54.040]  whole cadre, they have been doing this forever since the 80s, intimately involved in HIV
[47:54.040 --> 47:58.840]  and drugs that killed people like ACT, they didn't work, I mean this guy's been a villain
[47:58.840 --> 48:02.680]  the whole time he lied to Congress, the list goes on and on, but now Rand Paul's coming
[48:02.680 --> 48:08.320]  right out and saying we have the documents, we have the emails, you weaponized COVID,
[48:08.320 --> 48:12.000]  you killed 7 million people that have died from COVID and you will be held accountable
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.360]  and your shots don't work and they're making people sick and you should stop giving the
[48:15.360 --> 48:19.440]  military these poison shots and stop trying to make school children take them.
[48:19.440 --> 48:26.520]  By the way, Pfizer came out two days ago and it's in my stack, I didn't see it in my video
[48:26.520 --> 48:33.400]  list guys and they said actually Tucker covered it last night, I told you this two and a half
[48:33.400 --> 48:38.400]  years ago they're going to want six to eight shots a year, it's a gene therapy, now how
[48:38.400 --> 48:44.600]  did I know, Bill Gates was telling his shareholders where they make twenty to one, you know, invest
[48:44.600 --> 48:48.760]  a dollar and make twenty dollars, unprecedented, he told his investors people are going to
[48:48.760 --> 48:53.720]  take six to eight shots a year, it's a business plan, they know it doesn't work, they know
[48:53.720 --> 48:58.680]  it erases your immune system, they're worse than crack dealers, they're worse than people
[48:58.680 --> 49:06.520]  selling OxyContin and MIT creating fentanyl, what a business model, they erase your immune
[49:06.520 --> 49:09.680]  system and give you blood clots and then you get sicker and sicker, they give you more
[49:09.680 --> 49:14.240]  and more of the very shots that kill you, less than they did with Rindesivir, 36% people
[49:14.240 --> 49:18.440]  that took it had renal failure, kidney failure, organ failure and they knew it didn't help
[49:18.440 --> 49:23.960]  anybody but that's what Fauci recommends because he's a psychotic Joseph Mingala and you can't
[49:23.960 --> 49:28.360]  recognize it because you're not Jeffrey Donner, you're not Joseph Mingala, you're not Anthony
[49:28.360 --> 49:35.520]  Fauci but now the quiet part is being said out loud, now the part that we're not supposed
[49:35.520 --> 49:40.240]  to say is being said by a doctor, Senator Paul and all the documents, I didn't just come
[49:40.240 --> 49:46.000]  up with this in February of 2020, I had the experts on, I called the top people, they
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.440]  said it's a weapons project started by Obama, that they got exposed in 2015, they moved
[49:51.440 --> 49:55.800]  to China but they're also secretly doing it here and it's man-made and all these foreign
[49:55.800 --> 50:01.000]  institutions that have CRISPR gene editing scanners scan the damn virus and said it's
[50:01.000 --> 50:08.800]  five viruses, chimeras with the actual gene injection points, the P2 Shuttle genes and
[50:08.800 --> 50:13.360]  others just like everybody knows Frankenstein's different parts because he's got stitches,
[50:13.360 --> 50:18.560]  it literally has the injection points, they know exactly how it was made, who did it,
[50:18.560 --> 50:23.480]  it's like saying a 57 Chevy just appeared in the Mojave Desert, they just sand blew around
[50:23.480 --> 50:28.520]  and made it, this thing is way more complex a 57 Chevy, they made it, it's artificial
[50:28.520 --> 50:34.680]  like the watch I'm wearing or the camera filming me right now, open and shut, done,
[50:34.680 --> 50:40.080]  they made it, they obviously released it to destabilize things and get rid of Trump and
[50:40.080 --> 50:45.520]  now Senator Paul is saying you are gonna get it, you're not getting away, we've caught
[50:45.520 --> 50:52.800]  him red handed, he won't get away and once we finally start indicting these criminals,
[50:52.800 --> 51:02.600]  the entire house of cards like Domino's will fall, the entire house of cards will come
[51:02.600 --> 51:07.160]  raining down, all they've got is their Hutzpah, all they've got is their arrogance, all they've
[51:07.160 --> 51:10.520]  got is their bravada that they control the media and they control the justice department,
[51:10.520 --> 51:13.520]  well you know what, you don't control our brains and our minds and there are medical
[51:13.520 --> 51:17.160]  doctors and scientists worldwide exposing you and there are hearings from Australia to
[51:17.160 --> 51:23.080]  Germany in their parliaments and criminal investigations have been begun against Pfizer
[51:23.080 --> 51:29.440]  and Moderna and Bill Gates and Peter Dazik and Anthony Fauci and you will be held accountable
[51:29.440 --> 51:34.760]  just like Hitler and just like Joseph Mingle his mad scientist thought they were invincible,
[51:34.760 --> 51:41.200]  they're not invincible, Stalin, Mao, Hitler, all these people are not invincible and we're
[51:41.200 --> 51:48.320]  not gonna let Hitler 2.0 in the embodiment of Fauci carry this out, oh he didn't tell
[51:48.320 --> 51:52.080]  you he loves Hitler publicly, he actually carries it out in a level that would make
[51:52.080 --> 51:58.400]  Hitler blush, here's part of that report last night with Senator Rand Paul, this is important.
[51:58.400 --> 52:03.440]  Goodbyes are always hard but as the saying goes, don't be sad it's over, be glad it happened
[52:03.440 --> 52:08.440]  but in his final month on the throne of science, Dr. Anthony Fauci is having a tough time saying
[52:08.440 --> 52:13.480]  goodbye to the cameras, we keep thinking Fauci has done his farewell interview but then he
[52:13.480 --> 52:18.880]  does another and another and another, the science tells us it's actually more dangerous
[52:18.880 --> 52:23.880]  to get between Fauci and a camera than it is to catch COVID, today he stopped by the
[52:23.880 --> 52:28.320]  Washington Post where he left them with one last departing message.
[52:28.320 --> 52:33.920]  To much of the country, you're a hero, to another significant portion of the country
[52:33.920 --> 52:38.040]  you've become the villain, how do you hope people are going to remember you?
[52:38.040 --> 52:46.720]  Well, you're right, there is a dichotomy and I think if you do the numbers with all due
[52:46.720 --> 52:51.800]  respect to the people who hate me, I think you're outnumbered by the people who feel
[52:51.800 --> 52:54.280]  differently than you do.
[52:54.280 --> 52:59.840]  Fauci's reading his own press clippings, I've seen my poll numbers, they're pretty good.
[52:59.840 --> 53:04.280]  He wants you to remember him as a hero, even though he was wrong on the travel ban masks,
[53:04.280 --> 53:09.400]  lockdown school closures, warp speed, vaccine effectiveness, vaccine mandates and the lab
[53:09.400 --> 53:10.400]  leak.
[53:10.400 --> 53:15.360]  But Fauci could never admit he was wrong, Fauci was always the victim.
[53:15.360 --> 53:24.080]  Ideologies were spilling over into an agenda or a discussion of what should have been purely
[53:24.080 --> 53:29.800]  public health issues and being the person who's very visible in that regard, I became
[53:29.800 --> 53:30.800]  the target.
[53:30.800 --> 53:36.280]  The enemy is the virus, it's not each other and if you look around at some of the things
[53:36.280 --> 53:43.680]  that have gone on in our country, it appears that we are more enemies of each other than
[53:43.680 --> 53:45.280]  we are of the virus.
[53:45.280 --> 53:50.160]  Well, philosopher Fauci, where do you get this deep knowledge?
[53:50.160 --> 53:56.040]  No hero should ever be the target, but every hero should always admit they're not perfect.
[53:56.040 --> 53:58.840]  Which Dr. Fauci had a tough time doing?
[53:58.840 --> 54:05.560]  Is there a moment of your career that you wish you could do over?
[54:05.560 --> 54:17.920]  You know, Yasmin, no, and I know people are going to respond to that who say, well, what
[54:17.920 --> 54:18.920]  does he think?
[54:18.920 --> 54:19.920]  He's perfect?
[54:19.920 --> 54:20.920]  Absolutely.
[54:20.920 --> 54:26.640]  I'm the first to admit I'm far from perfect, but when you say do over, I really can't see
[54:26.640 --> 54:29.240]  something that I would do completely over.
[54:29.240 --> 54:31.320]  Senator Rand Paul joins us now.
[54:31.320 --> 54:35.200]  Don't you love it when someone asks you what you've done wrong in your life and you pause
[54:35.200 --> 54:38.920]  for about 40 seconds and scratch your chin?
[54:38.920 --> 54:41.680]  Let me count the ways.
[54:41.680 --> 54:47.840]  Likely, there is no public figure or public health figure that has made a greater error
[54:47.840 --> 54:50.280]  in judgment than Dr. Fauci.
[54:50.280 --> 54:56.600]  The error in judgment was to fund gain of function research in a totalitarian country.
[54:56.600 --> 55:02.380]  Fund research that allowed them to create super viruses that in all likelihood accidentally
[55:02.380 --> 55:06.880]  leaked into the public and caused 7 million people to die.
[55:06.880 --> 55:07.880]  Think about it.
[55:07.880 --> 55:12.560]  This is right up there with decisions, some of them malevolent or military to kill millions
[55:12.560 --> 55:13.560]  of people.
[55:13.560 --> 55:16.480]  This accidental, but it goes to judgment.
[55:16.480 --> 55:17.480]  Talk about errors.
[55:17.480 --> 55:23.840]  You think you might apologize to the world for funding research that allowed super viruses
[55:23.840 --> 55:30.160]  to be created in a lab, a lab that was not properly outfitted for safety, that people
[55:30.160 --> 55:36.280]  were already reporting was dangerous, to support that type of research and then to look the
[55:36.280 --> 55:39.720]  other way and say nothing to see here and to cover it up.
[55:39.720 --> 55:44.280]  For the last two years, he's been covering his tracks, but we've got him red-handed and
[55:44.280 --> 55:45.520]  he won't get away.
[55:45.520 --> 55:50.120]  Historically, he will be remembered for one of the worst judgments in the history of
[55:50.120 --> 55:51.920]  modern medicine.
[55:51.920 --> 55:59.720]  Criminally, this would probably fall under involuntary manslaughter, but we're not in
[55:59.720 --> 56:03.760]  a criminal court, so I guess it's just politics.
[56:03.760 --> 56:07.880]  Six million people can die worldwide and it's oops, I was probably right.
[56:07.880 --> 56:09.640]  No one asked me any questions.
[56:09.640 --> 56:13.240]  You're going to be asking some tough questions in the next couple days.
[56:13.240 --> 56:15.200]  You're playing a game of chicken.
[56:15.200 --> 56:21.400]  I'm hearing the Defense Department is not getting funded unless they hire back unvaxed
[56:21.400 --> 56:23.320]  military men and women.
[56:23.320 --> 56:25.600]  How do you think that's going to play out?
[56:25.600 --> 56:30.800]  You know, our young men and women who volunteer, we have an all-voluntary army that volunteer
[56:30.800 --> 56:34.000]  to defend our country, to put their lives on the line.
[56:34.000 --> 56:39.240]  They deserve to have their religious freedom as well as their medical choices and freedom
[56:39.240 --> 56:41.600]  to decide what goes into their body.
[56:41.600 --> 56:44.320]  We know this and this is a scientific fact.
[56:44.320 --> 56:47.240]  The vaccine does not prevent you from getting an infection.
[56:47.240 --> 56:52.600]  It doesn't prevent you from transmitting an infection and for young people, there isn't
[56:52.600 --> 56:57.280]  significant evidence to show that it reduces the severity or the hospitalization.
[56:57.280 --> 57:01.640]  The military's become so woke and they're demanding you get a vaccine that you don't
[57:01.640 --> 57:04.000]  need, so something's got to change.
[57:04.000 --> 57:07.840]  I hope that changes things and we'll be following how that plays out.
[57:07.840 --> 57:10.120]  Senator Rand Paul, Kentucky, thanks so much.
[57:10.120 --> 57:11.120]  Thank you.
[57:11.120 --> 57:12.720]  All right, hour number two is coming up.
[57:12.720 --> 57:14.880]  I'm going to hit a lot of big yay developments.
[57:14.880 --> 57:19.720]  The Inside Baseball, the public president's come out and responded and attacked the interview.
[57:19.720 --> 57:22.400]  That is coming up next hour and so much more.
[57:22.400 --> 57:23.400]  My Academy's as well.
[57:23.400 --> 57:25.440]  Please don't forget, we brought it back.
[57:25.440 --> 57:30.160]  Store-wide free shipping on orders of $50 or more and we're selling out of amazing products
[57:30.160 --> 57:37.120]  like Vitamin Refusion, DNA Force, plus our Ultimate Tumoric Formula Bodies, 95% Humanoid.
[57:37.120 --> 57:40.000]  You need to be taking this stuff, plus it funds the Info War.
[57:40.000 --> 57:45.000]  Keep us on air, folks, and boost your immune system today at infowarstore.com.
[57:45.000 --> 57:46.800]  Now free shipping is back.
[57:46.800 --> 57:50.880]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[57:50.880 --> 57:56.480]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping
[57:56.480 --> 57:59.400]  is back at infowarstore.com.
[57:59.400 --> 58:04.880]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more, but we've signed a new deal
[58:04.880 --> 58:10.760]  with a big national shipping company and they're able to cut our regular shipping cost by up
[58:10.760 --> 58:12.240]  to 50%.
[58:12.240 --> 58:16.760]  So that means even on orders that are below $50, you're going to be paying way lower than
[58:16.760 --> 58:17.760]  you were previously.
[58:17.760 --> 58:19.760]  This is a game changer.
[58:19.760 --> 58:21.440]  We're so excited about it.
[58:21.440 --> 58:23.400]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[58:23.400 --> 58:27.640]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able
[58:27.640 --> 58:28.640]  to do it.
[58:28.640 --> 58:33.720]  So now your orders will be shipped even faster, the same great customer service and more.
[58:33.720 --> 58:39.760]  So get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at infowarstore.com right
[58:39.760 --> 58:40.760]  now.
[58:40.760 --> 58:43.800]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune
[58:43.800 --> 58:50.400]  system, lead a healthier life, and keep enforce on the air, infowarstore.com.
[58:50.400 --> 58:56.280]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[58:56.280 --> 59:01.640]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[59:01.640 --> 59:05.520]  The first amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[59:05.520 --> 59:06.520]  to speak freely.
[59:06.520 --> 59:09.440]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or are they going to go for Steve Bannon,
[59:09.440 --> 59:11.160]  or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[59:11.160 --> 59:15.320]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[59:15.320 --> 59:19.640]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[59:19.640 --> 59:20.640]  your support.
[59:20.640 --> 59:23.760]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[59:23.760 --> 59:28.240]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[59:28.240 --> 59:31.880]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[59:31.880 --> 59:33.560]  because of your past support.
[59:33.560 --> 59:37.360]  So I salute you, and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[59:37.360 --> 59:41.800]  free double your efforts by visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[59:41.800 --> 59:42.800]  on air.
[59:42.800 --> 59:48.240]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is infowarstore.com, and I thank you all for
[59:48.240 --> 59:49.240]  your support.
[59:49.240 --> 01:00:19.080]  We are now, my friends, into hour number two on this very important Friday edition, because
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:24.360]  we have tens of millions of new people that tuned in, well, that's an underestimation,
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:29.320]  30, 40 million new people tuned in yesterday, conservatively, and we can see from the numbers
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:33.720]  that tens of millions of them are tuning back in, and most of them pop in for five, ten
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.640]  minutes to see what it's all about, and they leave, they're coming to hear about Yay West
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.280]  and, you know, what he did yesterday, and I'm going to address that in the first amendment,
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:44.640]  the fallouts, the inside baseball, and some breaking news.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.120]  Coming up at about 20 after, I'm going to start getting into that, and we got Mike Adams
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.480]  coming up, I'm also going to open the phones up, but I want to get back to Senator Paul.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:58.600]  Politics is a popularity contest, but it really should be a policy contest, we don't need politicians,
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:04.520]  we need statesmen and women who actually stand up for the people, and I know that's a simple
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:10.440]  statement, but it's so true, and Rand Paul really is better than DeSantis, he's better
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:17.200]  than Trump, and I like DeSantis, I like Trump, but I really like Rand Paul, and I hope when
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:22.160]  the election cycle heats up next year, I've really done some soul searching, and I really
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.360]  thought about it, we need to draft Rand Paul, and I'm not going to support DeSantis over
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:32.320]  Rand Paul or Trump, he's just far superior on every issue, far superior on not being
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:36.560]  a polarizing figure, and he's just the guy to support, so I think we should draft Rand
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.120]  Paul, and I think Trump, you know, can continue to rally Republicans to do what he does, and
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:45.680]  I just, DeSantis has too many globalists backing him, I like what he does, but the whole globalist
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.880]  patina he's got on him is a big problem, but here's Senator Paul elaborating on why we
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:55.000]  shouldn't be giving these dangerous experimental shots to the military, he's holding up defense
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.200]  spending until the eugenicists that run the Pentagon stop it, here's that report, we'll
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:02.040]  come back from break and get into a lot of other big breaking news.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:06.160]  Good afternoon.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:09.760]  Our young men and women in the military deserve better.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:15.320]  The Biden administration's vaccination mandate has forced our nation's young patriotic men
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:20.560]  and women to choose between their faith and their career, between their medical autonomy
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.160]  and their career.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:26.480]  At a time when the military is struggling to meet their targets for recruitment, the
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:31.560]  Biden administration is firing soldiers we invested in and trained.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:35.520]  Some will argue that the vaccine mandate in the military is not new.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:41.760]  That is correct, but there are several factors unique to the COVID vaccine that make it different
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.760]  than other mandates.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:49.280]  First, the CDC acknowledges that the COVID vaccine does not stop transmission.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.240]  So the argument that the mandate will stop incapacitating spread in the close quarters
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.520]  of the military is not applicable.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:04.720]  Second, the COVID vaccine has a risk of causing inflammation, particularly in young men, particularly
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.480]  the young men that comprise over 90% of our military recruits.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:15.200]  In addition, several scientific studies, including a very large one in Israel and another one
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:21.560]  by the CDC, have shown that a heightened risk of myocarditis for children and teenagers
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:25.680]  after taking a second COVID vaccine dose.
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:30.560]  Israel saw elevated rates of myocarditis after young men were vaccinated, particularly
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.240]  after the second dose.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:37.760]  Because of this scientific evidence, European countries began restricting the vaccine for
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:45.880]  certain age groups, Germany, France, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden all limit their recommendations
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.160]  for vaccines for young people.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:55.280]  Norway, South Africa, and UK chose not to recommend or chose to recommend only one dose
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.360]  because of the risk of myocarditis.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:04.440]  Dr. Paul Offit, a former member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Vaccines, part of the
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:09.800]  FDA's Advisory Committee on Vaccines resigned over this policy.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:15.920]  He also said that even though he's pro-vaccine, he's been pro-everything vaccine for 40 years
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:19.000]  that he wouldn't give the vaccine to his 24-year-old son.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.720]  Third, the mandate ignores naturally acquired immunity.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:28.080]  80% of our young military recruits have had COVID.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.240]  By compelling the young people to inject a vaccine into their bodies, they're accepting
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.360]  a risk of myocarditis.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:39.520]  In fact, it is inadvisable to take a vaccine if you've recently had COVID.
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.720]  Even the CDC admits this.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:47.080]  Our service members have spent their entire lives dedicated to protecting our country
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.560]  and making sacrifices to defend the Constitution.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:55.080]  Congress should take action, and we're taking action today by saying we will not vote to
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:05:00.520]  get on the NDAA, the Defense Authorization Bill, unless we have a vote.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:06.000]  Christmas 2022 is almost here, and we have great products at infowarstore.com that empower

[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:19.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:25.520]  Well, everybody wants to talk about the big, gay interview yesterday and the inside baseball
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.120]  and what's coming next, and Biden's response to it, we will.
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.520]  Then we're going to get back into some news that is central to understanding the globalist
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:37.640]  war game for the Great Reset, the fourth turning, and the organized collapse they're engaged
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:38.640]  in.
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:43.880]  But here's a few excerpts of yesterday's, yay, firestorm.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.880]  Here it is.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.160]  I don't think Hitler was a good guy.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.320]  I get the Hugo Boss uniform, it's amazing.
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.200]  But I mean, just because you're in love with the design, you're a designer, can we just
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.800]  kind of say, you like the uniforms, but that's about it.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:05.200]  No, there's a lot of things that I love about Hitler, a lot of things.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:09.680]  I'm in the twilight zone right now.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:13.080]  Netanyahu, what do you have to say?
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:19.120]  What do you have to say to Alex Jones right now, Nick Fuentes, and yay, it was bad, it
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:25.400]  was bad, but trust me, Nick and yay, okay.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:31.080]  I had no idea your voice was going to sound like that, Netanyahu.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.800]  So you don't like Mr. Netanyahu?
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:39.560]  I just heard about this guy two weeks ago, so it's like the tweet, and I thought he had
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.560]  a funny name.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:45.440]  I heard he's like really into like, he's like a super killer, I could die for saying this,
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:46.440]  so.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.440]  Okay, it's just the last time you ever hear from me.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.600]  Well, look, look, look, look, look, do I round up Jews in Nazi Germany?
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.600]  Do I get loved in?
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.120]  Schwarzenegger said he loved Hitler.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.120]  They gave him an award.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:59.600]  I'm just saying, I don't like Nazis, and I don't like what some of the mafias are doing
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.600]  either.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.400]  I like Hitler.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:08.480]  My accounts, because they've been frozen by the Jewish banks, so I need to watch my
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.480]  meals.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:13.800]  Well, CNN says why people are evil Nazis, so, I mean, I disagree with both statements,
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.800]  but I get those.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.600]  I don't like the word evil next to Nazis.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.680]  I think we need to look at.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.200]  Oh my goodness.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.400]  Just because you don't like one group doesn't mean the other.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:27.320]  I love Jewish people, but I also love Nazis.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:36.840]  Oh man, well, I have to disagree with that, but listen, we're going to go to break.
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:41.400]  So we have millions and millions and millions and millions of new people tuned in because
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.960]  of the Yale interview, I appreciate you coming here.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.760]  I appreciate the First Amendment.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.040]  I respected him and let him say what he wanted to say.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:57.040]  He was part serious, part trolling, and everybody tuned in wanted to know what happened behind
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:00.160]  the scenes and I know he was going to do that and all the rest of it.
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:03.680]  Now, the fake president Biden has responded.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:09.840]  It is undoubtedly still 24 hours in the biggest new story in the world, which I really don't
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:10.840]  think it should be.
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:11.840]  Yale is big.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:12.840]  It's important.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.760]  What he said was outrageous.
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:21.440]  I disagree with almost all of the Hitler stuff, I mean, I disagree with all the Hitler stuff,
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:28.960]  but I agree with him on free speech issues is what I'm getting at.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:29.960]  People want to talk about this.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:37.320]  They want to discuss this, but it's only good to cover it if it's a teaching moment as they
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.320]  call that.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:44.160]  We can really get a 35,000-foot view of what's happening here by drilling into it and by talking
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.160]  to it.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:48.240]  Do we get all the true history about World War I and World War II?
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.240]  No.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:54.080]  Has the West done horrible things like drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki when
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:59.920]  it came out years later the Japanese had tried to unconditionally surrender two weeks before?
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.560]  No.
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.640]  Has America done secret experiments on poor whites, blacks, and Native Americans that
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.680]  would make Nazis blush?
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:09.680]  Yes.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:14.440]  But just because our government's had criminals in it at different levels at different times
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.760]  and just because we've got mafias and corrupt systems here does not then mean, well, then
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.720]  Hitler must be good.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.160]  That's like saying Hitler attacked Stalin.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:30.440]  Well, just because Hitler didn't like Stalin and Bolshevik communism, which was horrible
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.760]  as well, another super evil ideology, doesn't mean he's good.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:41.400]  It'd be like if Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacy, two serial killers that kidnapped and
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:46.160]  murdered young gay men, got in a cage fight with each other.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:49.840]  It's not like John Wayne Gacy's good or Jeffrey Dahmer's good.
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.600]  They're both bad.
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.920]  But that's this black and white world of polarization the way people work.
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:00.480]  I mean, a lot of what we're told about Hitler in pop culture isn't really true.
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:09.400]  When you actually dig into it though, it's even worse.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:15.960]  So everything we see in Hitler is what we see with the dehumanization and the depopulation
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:22.160]  and the medical tyranny and the Nuremberg Code violating actions where we executed a
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:32.640]  bunch of Nazis and had a year long trial before we did it in 1946 over what Hitler did.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:39.720]  And the main way they fried them was the medical records and the mad scientists that were
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:47.880]  haunt showing, that were commanding, that were field marshaling, that were captaining
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:53.440]  those operations that now if you pull back, my goodness, the British government, the Canadian
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.400]  government, the US government, the Australian government, they've all got the same weird
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.680]  mad scientist running them, the South African government, the Israeli government's done
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:05.000]  weird secret testing on their own people, look up the ringworm children, they would
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.920]  irradiate little kids to death, in some cases half the death, depending on how much radiation
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:10.920]  they were given.
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:20.280]  So the tie that binds or the string, the unifying field here is that there are mad scientists
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:28.000]  all over the world that have the same mindset and find social Darwinist eugenicists, whether
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.920]  it's the Japanese imperial family or the British imperial family or the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:39.640]  and the Nazis or the Cold Springs Harbor Rockefeller Foundation in New York to do secret experimentation
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:45.800]  and treat humans like animals and create a cadre of a medical corps that will do lethal
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:51.360]  experiments on people and cover it up because then you know you've got the intelligentsia
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:57.720]  of the country if you've got the very cream of the cream of scientists inducted into a
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:01.440]  eugenics cult.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:05.400]  And if you go to the University of Texas Biology Department or you go to the Harvard
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:13.520]  Biology Department or you go to the MIT Biology Department or you go to any of these, I don't
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:17.320]  care whether it's a Catholic university, I don't care if it's a government university,
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:26.240]  a public university, I don't care whether it's a Protestant university, you go to any
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:31.640]  of these universities and the majority of the scientists, the majority of the professors
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:37.600]  believe in eugenics and believe in world depopulation and believe you're dumb animals.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:42.440]  And Mike Adams has got huge breaking news next hour on this subject, wait till we cover
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:43.440]  it.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.320]  And I remember my dad telling me about this experiment, now the globalists are modeling
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:54.720]  their whole system at many levels on this and now they believe collapse is inevitable
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:01.040]  so they are helping orchestrate and engineer that collapse in a controlled way instead
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:05.440]  of being in an uncontrolled way, that's their excuse to play God, that's their excuse to
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:09.040]  come in and do all these things.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:15.960]  And this is going to be for 99.999% of people hell on earth and history shows it will finally
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:23.680]  in this unquenchable black hole of evil and control destroy the very elites that are trying
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:27.240]  to control and run everything.
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:37.320]  So that's where we are and so to look at Yee up here saying he thinks Hitler's been given
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:41.960]  a bad rap in many ways and they're asking about historical events and things, he doesn't
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:47.920]  understand them, he doesn't know them, 99% of people don't, it'd be like if a Martian
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:53.440]  landed and you tried to teach him how a football game worked or something and when I say Yee
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:59.400]  is like a Martian, I mean he is obviously savonic, autistic and I'm not putting him
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:05.440]  down, we all are to a certain extent and is at a different level, I don't want to say
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:11.680]  a level above or a level below, just a different perspective but my issue is you can't point
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:19.040]  a finger at him and say that's the bad man, that's the worst guy on earth, when he's saying
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.160]  I love the Zionist, I love the Nazis, I love everybody and some unified Christian Christ
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:32.160]  like idea that can be taken out of context, the issue is, is he doing secret medical experiments?
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:38.160]  Did he inject black people with syphilis into skiing, is he putting up 5G, is he starting
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.760]  World War 3, is he devaluing your currency, is he promoting pedophilia and the answer
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:48.000]  is no, the system is so what's behind the system, what's its operating system, why
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.320]  does it have this attitude, well we've cracked the code, we know, we're going to cover it
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:59.200]  when we come back, stay with us.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:05.280]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping

[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:09.600]  Now the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.160]  The bad news is by Christmas almost every product in the store will be sold out, we
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.240]  won't get more for months and months and months.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:20.080]  So now is the time to take action to support the info war and get the biggest sales of
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.080]  the year.
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:25.840]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and BioTruse Selenium and our Wake Up America award winning
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:32.120]  coffee and now DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Ralfusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, so many other

[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:41.880]  all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.

[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:06.040]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:10.640]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:15.080]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:19.920]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:23.520]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:30.320]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3, but if you're not getting
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:35.400]  enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:38.200]  things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:42.120]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:46.840]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload

[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:02.040]  It's a post COVID world now.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:07.040]  Those who have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system, there's a solution.
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.040]  The wellness company.

[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:40.000]  general medical care, but also COVID-19 acute and post COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:46.400]  and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new world that we're
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.400]  living in.

[01:19:54.080 --> 01:20:00.840]  You can get started today and on a pathway to better health.
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:25.400]  This corrupt out of control world corporate fashion system that literally just spawned
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:36.520]  my little
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:53.960]  camera to figure out what to do with it.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:57.760]  on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, national news.
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:02.120]  The puppet in chief, Biden has toddled out on the Twitter,
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:04.640]  and also I'm told is about to a press conference.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:07.720]  He said, I just want to make a few things clear.
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.880]  The Holocaust happened.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:11.440]  Hitler was a demonic figure.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:12.880]  Yeah, it takes one to know on.
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.040]  And instead of giving it a platform,
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:18.000]  our political leaders should be calling out
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.280]  and rejecting anti-Semitism wherever it hides.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:24.600]  Silence is complicity.
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:26.600]  Oh, oh, perfect.
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:30.280]  You say you're not gonna make a comment
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.680]  on the hundreds of days of lockdowns
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:35.720]  and the police state that has nothing to do.
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.680]  A hundred or something days in your house,
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:40.040]  the virus only stays the body 14 days.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.760]  You're only communicable less than 14 days.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:43.040]  Why are you keeping them locked their houses
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.840]  for 130, 140 days?
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:47.200]  Why are you killing people, put them in camps?
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:49.440]  While we talk about the three million innocent,
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:53.440]  Uyghur minority in Western China in slave factories,
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.480]  literally working at iPhone factories,
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:59.520]  Foxconn with suicide nets around the building.
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:01.480]  Because they're so desperate,
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:03.640]  they go up the fourth story and jump off.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:09.520]  Oh, silence is complicity.
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:11.760]  Yes, it's complicity about how the so-called vaccine
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.800]  isn't a vaccine, doesn't work, causes blood clots
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.520]  and all these problems of the racial immune system.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:18.280]  And silence is complicity on the now part two
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.640]  of the Veritas report out of the kidnap
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:23.040]  human smuggled children as young as six
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:26.320]  in sex slavery in Austin, caught on video,
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:29.440]  no national news, corporate media covering it up.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:32.080]  Silence is complicity.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:37.280]  Over and over and over and over again.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:40.040]  Silence is complicity.
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.960]  Cutting off our Keystone pipeline, destroying our economy.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.760]  Silence is complicity.
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:50.880]  Germany blames Russia for the power price increases,
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.680]  but Germany bans farmers from properly fertilizing land.
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.360]  So does Belgium.
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:00.240]  So do the Netherlands, following a UN edict to cut carbon
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.880]  as if plants and nitrogen is bad.
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.040]  They're cutting off the food.
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.640]  The Netherlands is one of the biggest food exporters
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.840]  that's in the top five in the world.
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:14.440]  And they turn around and blame Russia.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.040]  If Russia was a blame, I'd blame them.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:19.440]  But it's, the global is doing it again.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.920]  She wanna make a few things clear.
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:25.600]  Well, I don't count any life over another,
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.640]  whether it's a black person, a brown person,
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.760]  or a white person, whether it's a Muslim,
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.960]  or whether it's a Christian, or whether it's an agnostic.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:40.360]  So my only beef and concern with the Hollywood industry
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:43.600]  and the Holocaust centers and the school kids
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:47.120]  being taken on tours about it is that's great.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:50.800]  Can we have some communist genocide
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.560]  or Holocaust museums about communists killing
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.000]  200 million people in the last 100 years?
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.840]  Could we have one of those?
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:01.600]  Cause you know, I think Hitler probably did kill
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.000]  millions and millions and millions of Jews.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.800]  Nobody really knows the real number.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.440]  There's different estimates, but I mean,
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:09.120]  he had the final solution in 1943.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.480]  He put the orders out to take the people
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.840]  out of the forced labor camps and killed them.
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.280]  It's in the fricking orders.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.320]  They had trials.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.880]  It's called Nuremberg, okay?
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.800]  You can argue over the numbers.
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:23.840]  So they find a serial killer.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.000]  It's got 25 dead bodies buried in his backyard.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.080]  And the FBI goes, we think there might be more.
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.520]  So the FBI exaggerated and said
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:33.440]  we dug up a hundred bodies in the backyard.
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:34.360]  And then the whole debate comes,
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:37.800]  well, there wasn't a hundred, there was only 25 dead bodies.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.880]  But that's not what happened.
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:43.000]  So whether it's four million or seven million,
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.320]  nobody knows ladies and gentlemen, nobody knows, okay?
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.840]  But my grandfather saw it.
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:51.200]  Bodies dead as long as you could look.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:01.400]  And I had other family who worked for the US government
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:03.120]  and they never told me the specifics,
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:08.120]  but how disgusted they were having to babysit Nazis
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:15.400]  in US military bases in the 50s and 60s.
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.480]  And they weren't directly involved in it.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:22.760]  They were Nazis everywhere, 30 plus thousand taken here
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.200]  in Operation Paperclip alone.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.760]  And they were all over the place and they were arrogant
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.240]  and they openly brag about what they did
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:34.000]  and they thought they were superior.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.920]  So I don't, you talk about history books all day,
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.800]  I got plenty of examples of Operation Paperclip
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.040]  and how it went on and how every major US agency
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:43.360]  from the CIA to NASA was basically founded by Nazis
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.520]  because they follow orders and were a cut out group
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.240]  totally controlled by a breakaway intelligence group.
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.040]  But that's a side issue.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:54.680]  But before you sit there and look at yay
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.520]  and say he's the biggest demon on earth,
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:01.080]  he's rejecting the censorship, he's rejecting the system
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:03.760]  and he's saying he thinks this system's the bad guys.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.040]  Well, he's right.
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.160]  The people that have hijacked our system are bad
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.920]  and they're trying to steal our elections
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:13.840]  and surveil us and use lawfare and weaponize judiciary
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.560]  and all the rest of it to take our freedoms
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.120]  and put in a permanent bureaucratic
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.880]  deep state dictatorship.
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:20.480]  But what yay has to get
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:21.800]  and what everybody else out there
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.920]  that has these weird Nazi fetishes needs to get is
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:29.040]  just because the people running our system
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:33.120]  are corrupt and bad does not mean wars we've had
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.280]  with other groups.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:36.680]  If we go to war next month with China
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.000]  who's bought off our government,
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.400]  manipulated us in terrible things,
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.920]  China is way more advanced in their tyranny,
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:45.520]  way more evil than what Joe Biden and Obama
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.040]  and the Clintons have been able to get done.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.040]  I have no doubt if they could get that done,
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.520]  their control freaks, their evil,
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.600]  they would love to do what G.G. Ping's done.
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.040]  But let me explain something to you.
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:56.000]  If we have a war with China,
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.480]  it doesn't mean G.G. Ping is good
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:02.640]  just because our governments got problems.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.160]  And I've analyzed what's going on with yay
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.520]  and that's what's happening.
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.080]  When I sit there and I tell him things
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.800]  that are undisputed that came out of Adolf Hitler's mouth,
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.160]  he goes, no, that's not true.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:23.680]  Because he's operating like this is a comic book
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.520]  and they're Superman and Lex Luthor.
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:27.760]  That's not how this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:33.840]  But it takes study and it takes research
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.400]  and it takes a lot of commitment
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:36.480]  to know how this stuff really works.
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.840]  And that's what we do here.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.400]  And that's why the establishment
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:42.280]  is so scared of this broadcast because they tune in
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:44.600]  and they go, my God, this guy knows our whole game.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.480]  He knows more than most our top people
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.640]  because most of them just follow orders
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:48.480]  of departmentalize.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:51.440]  That's why Henry Kissinger tried to get me to go to New York
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:55.200]  in front of my producer, John Harmon, years ago,
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.160]  16, 17 years ago.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:59.800]  And that meeting was not off record.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:01.320]  That's why I talked about it.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.440]  The other offers have been over a dozen of them
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:04.960]  were in confidence.
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:06.480]  They had asked me to commit crimes
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:08.360]  but they wanted to meet with me.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.320]  They did meet with me.
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.320]  I've met with Bilderberg group members.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.400]  I've met with household name billionaires.
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:16.240]  I've met with representatives of these agencies
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.200]  and of these groups.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.480]  And they said, look, because you understand this,
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.760]  you need to join us and you can help lead
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:24.320]  the Liberty Movement and you'll get some of your input
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.440]  in our councils.
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.040]  Just join us, Alex.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.600]  And I don't tell you that to impress you
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.120]  but you already see advising Trump,
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.600]  all the stuff we're involved in,
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.360]  we know what we're talking about here.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.200]  So when you hear me talk about this stuff,
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:39.040]  you understand, I'm not just getting this out of books.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.360]  I have had them over and over again trying to hire me.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:47.280]  And of course, they stopped the last few years
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.640]  because they know I'm not gonna sell out and you see what I get.
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:50.840]  They're attempting to destroy me.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.400]  But you can keep us on air.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.600]  We got big breaking news on the other side.
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:55.440]  Stay with us.
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:01.720]  Christmas 2022 is almost here.

[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:07.880]  that free shipping is back at infowarstore.com.

[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.640]  But we've signed a new deal
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:16.240]  with a big national shipping company
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:19.000]  and they're able to cut our regular shipping cost
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.720]  by up to 50%.

[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:30.000]  This is a game changer, we're so excited about it.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.280]  Our listeners had really asked for free shipping again.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.640]  We couldn't afford it before,
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:35.960]  but by moving to a bigger national distributor,
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:36.800]  we're able to do it.

[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.680]  lead a healthier life and keep invoices on the air,
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:56.760]  infowarstore.com.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:02.080]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process,
[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:04.920]  the only thing that made any Republican victories
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.000]  tonight possible.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  The only thing that made any resistance
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.160]  to the war machine possible.
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:13.960]  The only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:16.000]  and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.320]  and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible.
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:22.400]  I made any resistance to it possible
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:25.400]  was people continuing to support info wars,
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:28.760]  despite the massive lawfare being waged against info wars,
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:32.040]  despite the media defamatory libelous campaign
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.240]  against info wars.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.960]  The ordinary people, the everyday people
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:38.640]  that buy products that make their own lives healthier,
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:42.080]  wealthier and wiser is what keeps info wars on the air.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:45.720]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:48.600]  in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:50.040]  So, continue to do it,
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:52.240]  go to places like infowarstore.com,
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.280]  go to the places like save info wars,
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:56.320]  continue to keep info wars alive
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.600]  because in the process,
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:00.400]  you're keeping American liberty alive.
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:04.080]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:07.320]  are a great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:08.880]  Info wars has made it easier
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:11.080]  to make sure you're getting enough in your system
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:13.200]  with a supplement that contains both.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:16.360]  This info wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.520]  with rose hips should be your next purchase
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:19.920]  from the info wars store.
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:21.640]  The rose hips contained within
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:24.720]  are a part of the rose flower just below the petals
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:27.120]  that contain the rose plant seeds.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.400]  Natural chemicals found in the hips
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:32.360]  may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:34.560]  including those with osteoarthritis
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:37.800]  and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:39.960]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves,
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:42.720]  you probably already know that they play an important role
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:44.680]  in nutrition, immune defense,
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:46.800]  and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.960]  It has been reported that intake of both
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:50.440]  is often inadequate,
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:53.440]  even in affluent populations like here in America.
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.520]  So next time you visit,
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:57.080]  be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:00.720]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:05.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:07.120]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:14.720]  ["Waging War on Corruption"]
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:25.160]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:29.120]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:33.120]  ["Waging War on Corruption"]
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:55.120]  Yes, my friends, we're stepping into the twilight zone.
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:34:02.120]  So last night, Ye put out his 2024 presidential symbol,
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:03.840]  which the minute I saw it this morning
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:06.120]  and saw that he was banned on Twitter,
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.840]  over like 5 a.m. and a bunch of techs were like,
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:10.880]  oh, look, Ye got banned, techs from Ye, you name it.
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:14.160]  And I went, that's the Raylian space cult symbol
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:18.240]  from the 1970s with Ray Al out of France.
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:20.120]  And immediately I looked at it and I said,
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:23.240]  the Hindu, and a bunch of other ancient cultures had it,
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:26.240]  regular Swastika is flat.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:28.400]  It's just, it's sitting there.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:31.840]  Hitler rotated it 90 degrees.
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:35.040]  But the point is, is it shows how every ancient culture
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:40.440]  had sun symbols, the Vikings carved Swastikas on things.
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:42.600]  The ancient Indians, you know, what are the, you know,
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:45.000]  Hindus and then folks today, that's on their temples
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.680]  and people all the time go to like India
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.000]  and they get really freaked out and go,
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.400]  oh, there's Swastikas and they all freak out.
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:52.600]  They go, no, no, no, that's a 3,000 year old temple,
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.040]  sweetheart.
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:56.960]  That's a 1,000 year old temple.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:01.120]  So Ye put out a Hindu Swastika inside a Star of David
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:04.200]  saying he wanted to unify everyone.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:07.280]  And it wasn't him saying he, like some of the things
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:11.280]  Hitler did, that got him banned on Twitter by Elon Musk,
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:14.840]  it was the symbol because Elon knew the public
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:17.520]  wouldn't even understand that.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:19.440]  And wouldn't even know what that meant.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.120]  And there was like, oh my God, he put a Swastika
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:22.240]  on the Star of David.
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.840]  So again, he's putting on an art piece.
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:26.520]  This stuff is all over the world.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:29.400]  There's even ancient examples of combining Swastikas
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:30.760]  with the Seal of Solomon.
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:32.080]  It's not the Star of David.
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:33.280]  It's the Seal of Solomon.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.720]  And if you know about the Bible,
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:35.760]  you know about ancient history,
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:37.800]  you know about the Masons and all of it,
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:41.120]  that's the symbol God gave him when he conjured
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:44.280]  all these demons and he married all these foreign wives.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.720]  And the Bible says, I'm not even sure if God accepted him,
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.880]  King David's son, because he was the wisest man to ever live.
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:55.880]  But he got overrun with these demonic things
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.600]  he was doing if you believe the Bible.
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.000]  You believe ancient history.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.280]  And then he was given the Seal of Solomon
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:06.160]  to be able to seal and control the demons.
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:08.800]  So it is a black magic symbol.
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:12.640]  So I mean, you wanna know where it comes from
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:17.640]  and what it is, it is a symbol used in black magic.
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:20.800]  And they believe that the Seal of Solomon
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:25.440]  is amongst the three most powerful sigils in the occult.
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:27.000]  And I will tell you what Alistair Crowley said,
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.200]  if you're into that stuff,
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:29.920]  just so you know the left follows it.
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:34.320]  The V symbol, he promoted and pushed
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.120]  and said it was an ancient symbol
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:39.280]  that could countermand Hitler's sigil
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:44.120]  of the 90 degree turned rotating clockwise swastika,
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:45.100]  meaning action.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:49.040]  So you have the Seal of Solomon,
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:52.120]  you have the swastika and it's not just black magic,
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:53.360]  it's all these occult ancient groups,
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.880]  but you have the Seal of Solomon,
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:58.240]  you have the swastika and all its permutations
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:01.960]  and then you've got the V for victory symbol
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:05.040]  as the west adopted it.
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.720]  And the V is not an evil symbol,
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:09.840]  Alistair Crowley just said it was his.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.640]  And a swastika is a symbol of the sun
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:12.800]  that ancients came up with.
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:17.800]  And the Seal of Solomon is about completion
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:22.440]  and balance and order and it's a beautiful symbol.
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:24.400]  The swastika is a powerful symbol.
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:26.840]  The V is not that powerful,
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:29.600]  but you still see it in iconography,
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:31.200]  it's probably not the most powerful of the three.
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:33.960]  You can debate whether the swastika
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:38.360]  or whether the Seal of Solomon is the most powerful symbol
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:41.800]  and those things are debated in the occult areas.
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:45.880]  And of course you know the most popular,
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:47.120]  what everybody's heard of,
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.600]  overhead shot please.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:52.560]  And that's called the pentacle.
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:55.400]  And the pentacle is the star
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:58.520]  and it's the symbol of a human.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.600]  And Leonardo da Vinci and all that
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.320]  talked about that and wrote about that.
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.600]  Now what happens when you invert that?
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:11.560]  The classical back to mech symbol of the Satanist
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:16.040]  which is inversion of God's plan for humanity.
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.920]  So that's the lesson in symbols.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:19.560]  Is a star bad?
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:21.320]  No.
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:28.720]  But when you invert it and what's another powerful sigil?
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:30.840]  I said, what's the most powerful?
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:32.320]  I threw these questions out there.
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:33.840]  We know the most powerful.
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.280]  It's a cross.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:43.280]  And all the geometrics and everything else
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.200]  that comes out of it.
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:51.400]  So they get you scared of that
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:54.600]  where you can't even use symbols
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.360]  or know how symbols work
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.680]  because you've been so hobbled.
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:03.680]  We've been so hobbled by it.
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:05.880]  And then you take the cross,
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:08.560]  a symbol of different powers converging
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:12.280]  and you put a man, the son of God,
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:17.120]  hanging on it in a sacrifice to humanity.
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:21.320]  And that is the Christian symbol.
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.400]  Now they've been putting people use the cross for wrong.
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.040]  Does that mean we stop using the cross?
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.200]  No, we use the cross.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:29.640]  Kanye should not have been suspended.
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:33.560]  Yay, should not have been suspended
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:37.400]  if he put up a Nazi swastika.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:38.720]  Because if they can take his right,
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:40.400]  we have the famous Supreme Court rulings
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:43.440]  and there's so many others about letting Nazis march
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.040]  and letting Nazis put ads in the paper
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.080]  and letting Nazis broadcast.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.440]  And in the old days, the ACLU sat there
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:54.940]  and they defended things like that.
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.120]  But if you're actually got death camps running
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:01.320]  and you're in China, Biden won't even decry that.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.880]  But he says silence is complicity.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:07.720]  But then he'll point at a black man
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:13.280]  who's clearly on the spectrum
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:16.640]  and say that's the bad man to make him the good man.
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:17.880]  And that's what Yay's saying.
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:18.840]  And I see what Yay's saying.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:20.560]  And I support his right to say it
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:22.600]  until he hurts somebody, which he hasn't.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:27.600]  But here's a piece from decades and decades and decades ago.
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:29.400]  I guess this ruling was what back in the 70s
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:33.920]  the memory serves on the 78 on free speech, here it is.
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.560]  If you've been following the curious
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:38.200]  and disturbing story on the Nazis and Jews
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:40.720]  in Skokie, Illinois, the Nazi march
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:42.880]  appears for the moment to be on again.
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:44.920]  A federal court in Chicago ruled today
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:46.640]  that attempts by the village of Skokie
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:49.320]  to stop the march are unconstitutional.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:51.360]  The federal judge, Bernard M. Decker,
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.680]  said the court was acutely aware of grave dangers
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:57.040]  posed by public dissemination of doctrines
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:59.000]  of racial and religious hatred.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.840]  But he said ordinances to stop the march violated
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.240]  the First Amendment protection of free speech
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:07.200]  and the 14th Amendment right of equal protection.
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:10.280]  The judge also quoted the opinion of justice homes
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:13.320]  that the constitutional principle of free thought meant
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:15.680]  free thought not for those who agree with us
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:18.160]  but freedom for the thought we hate.
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.000]  Now, if you're a TV viewer,
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.840]  you can see this for radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.320]  You got the news catcher off the one side.
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:24.200]  You've got a TV behind him with a graphic.
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:25.880]  This is the ACLU of the Nazis.
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:26.960]  And there's an American flag
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:29.040]  and one of the stars is a swastika.
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:35.000]  Does that mean that the talk show host is a Nazi
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  because he's illustrating that?
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.200]  No, so see, Americans knew that then.
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.720]  But yay puts out a swastika in the middle
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:44.240]  of a star of David calling for unity,
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:48.920]  which was a Hindu swastika, not the Nazi swastika
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:51.040]  and it still gets him banned.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.560]  So are they gonna ban NBC or ABC News
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:55.160]  because they showed a swastika?
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.920]  This is the superstition of information
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.840]  and ideas they're creating.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:01.680]  But look at the real symbol in the picture.
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:03.600]  All of it means something.
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:05.160]  You've got the red and the flag
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.800]  for the blood of patriots at Falkland Nation.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:12.120]  You've got the white and the symbol of the purity of ideas
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:14.840]  and the bandages to cover the wounds,
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:18.520]  give the blue sky for space and God and infinity
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:22.400]  and of it each state, former colonies as a star,
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:23.840]  representing the people.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:26.720]  Why do the police wear a five-pointed star?
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:29.440]  Because the sheriff selected by the people
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:32.120]  and they're supposed to represent the people.
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:34.880]  They have a symbol of a man on their chest
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:37.640]  saying I am the representative of you
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:40.480]  to carry out and execute this operation
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:42.320]  and this is a legal document.
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:46.160]  This flag is a contract of our commitment to be pure
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.840]  and strong and to bleed for God under the night sky
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:54.840]  as being made by the creator.

[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:03.040]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen,
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:07.560]  slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:10.280]  and it's absolutely absurd for anyone
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:14.360]  to take our election seriously when we just,
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:17.320]  it's election month, Alex, it's not election day
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:18.920]  and that's the problem.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:21.840]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:25.440]  They illegally changed state elections,
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:28.040]  mailing ballots to anyone and everyone
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:31.080]  and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:33.080]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:35.560]  We're in a serious country when we have elections
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.240]  that can be stolen like this.
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:39.480]  And I believe that just like I believe
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:41.240]  the election was stolen in 2020
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:43.560]  and I have no problem saying that
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:46.560]  and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:49.920]  to attack us that question our election integrity
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:53.520]  and question the fact that elections
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.320]  shouldn't be run the way they are.
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:58.240]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:01.920]  So when I first started taking survival skills,
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:04.480]  basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:06.800]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.600]  I was barely holding onto a job
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:11.280]  and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.840]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield,
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.760]  the X1 and it worked pretty good.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:18.120]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with a D
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:19.960]  you had with a D burden source, you know,
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:21.800]  and I got really excited about that so I took it.
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:25.000]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.160]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:29.560]  You know, I could think again,
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:31.400]  I could connect with people again.
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:34.200]  And over the course of the next couple of years,
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:36.840]  I got my health back and I religiously took basically
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:37.800]  all of your supplements.
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:40.200]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.720]  I want to like recently as a knockout, literally.
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:44.240]  Like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.520]  It's amazing, it works.
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:48.120]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:50.600]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:53.160]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:54.240]  into our own hands.
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:55.440]  Beautifully said, brother.
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:57.720]  I thank you so much for your call at Godspeed.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:03.080]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:05.640]  to introduce to you the wellness company,
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.440]  an alternative healthcare system for this COVID
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:13.480]  and post COVID world where trust has been lost
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:16.960]  in doctors and healthcare systems.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:21.920]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:26.240]  providing uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:30.280]  laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:35.280]  treatment packages specifically for COVID, post COVID,
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:38.800]  vaccine injury syndromes and all the usual things
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:41.800]  that are seen in primary care.
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:45.520]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products,
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:50.080]  an online store, media and health advice.
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:52.760]  Come see the wellness company
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:57.000]  and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.580]  to the wellness company.
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:04.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:09.240]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:37.720]  So Joe Biden lectures the world
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:39.720]  and says he's a great guy,
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:42.320]  all the human smelling, sex slavery,
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:44.800]  confirmed by Project Veritas, Senate reports,
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:46.520]  all the other crimes he's committing.
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.400]  The evilest person on earth is yay
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:54.080]  and oh, silence is, silence is complicity.
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:57.240]  Well, do you support listeners,
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:00.040]  the Chinese people under an unelected Chinese
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:02.600]  Communist dictatorship that they admit
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:04.160]  have killed 100 million of their own people
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:07.240]  since Mao Zedong took over in the late 1940s?
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:09.920]  And now all over the country,
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:12.720]  people locked down for hundreds of days.
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:14.720]  Their houses burning up, their high rises burning up,
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:15.960]  no one coming to help them.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.800]  Robots flying around, barking orders,
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:20.640]  QR codes to leave your house,
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:21.960]  if you're even allowed to.
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:24.800]  We get a yellow code, you're gonna leave where you're at,
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:27.680]  you just sleep on the street, sometimes for months.
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:29.520]  Giant camps built everywhere.
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:33.400]  What are they trying to invoke?
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:35.160]  What are they trying to do?
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.120]  Do you support the Chinese people
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:39.400]  that got sick of the COVID camps?
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:42.400]  Oh, where'd Chen go?
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.720]  Oh, he disappeared, he's gone.
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:46.160]  He died of COVID in the camp.
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:47.000]  Yeah, right.
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.560]  That's the new secret police uniform is the white.
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:54.200]  Bunny suits, do you support the Chinese people
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:55.720]  burning these facilities down?
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:57.200]  Cause there's been reports of it in the last year,
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:59.360]  but now there's footage, let's roll it.
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:04.280]  COVID isolation camp in Lanzhou, China,
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:07.320]  set on fire by the locals
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:10.720]  so they cannot send them there anymore.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:11.840]  G.G. Ping recently said,
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:15.680]  don't mess with Chinese people or it won't end well.
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:24.960]  I'd imagine Biden's probably sending the FBI over
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:29.960]  to help G.G. Ping arrest people around folks up.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  Seriously, under Obama, the CIA ran black sites in China.
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:36.600]  That's come out in the news.
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:39.000]  We first broke that before it was in the news.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.440]  We got all the other footage of people's houses
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:45.960]  beating them up cause they were caught online
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:46.840]  supporting protests.
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:50.040]  How dare them, how dare them do that?
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:54.360]  How dare them not stay in their house 120, 130 days
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:58.160]  where they weld the door shut and then starve to death.
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:59.280]  They admit that.
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:01.040]  Again, I'm gonna say it again.
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:03.520]  No one in or out, the virus doesn't incubate
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:07.920]  and it's not communicable for any longer than 14 days.
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:09.120]  Usually it's about seven.
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:13.920]  Why would you lock people in their house for 130 days?
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:18.120]  Because it's all a raw exercise of power
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:19.640]  by the dictator of China.
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:21.400]  And you go, why would he want to be a dictator?
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:24.840]  Cause he wants to, cause he likes power.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:27.000]  Why did John Wayne Gacy lure young men to his house
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.480]  and torture him to death and kill him
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:29.600]  and bury him in the basement?
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:30.680]  Cause he liked it.
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:35.320]  And when we get authoritarians in control,
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:37.120]  they set up a totalitarian regimes
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:39.760]  and they do this over and over and over again.
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:43.880]  And that's the issue that Google and Facebook
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:46.360]  and Twitter until must have covered,
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:47.880]  still remains to be seen what he's gonna do.
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:52.480]  They all helped suppress these demonstrations.
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:55.160]  These peaceful demonstrations and our own president
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:57.400]  won't even decry it.
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:58.960]  But he will decry
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.560]  yay on the Alex Jones show
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:06.080]  and say silence is complicity.
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:10.640]  Because yay is rejecting this whole system
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:13.000]  so he thinks who this system is used
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:16.720]  as this bad guy must be a good guy.
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:18.960]  No, that's yay's problem.
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:21.520]  But did yay do all these things?
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:23.040]  Did yay hurt anybody?
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:23.880]  Did yay kill anybody?
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:24.720]  No.
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:25.560]  And I'm not here to defend yay.
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:27.440]  The point is he's not the villain
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:29.280]  in a scale of villains here.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:30.600]  I disagree with someone what he said.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:35.240]  Here, let's say on a scale of one to a hundred.
[01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:38.080]  Where's yay?
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:41.280]  Well, let's make him a 15.
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:42.200]  Hell, I'm not perfect either.
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.960]  Let's make me a 20.
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:47.600]  There's a 30 and there's a 40 and there's a 50
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.000]  and there's a 60 and there's a 70.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  On out to a hundred.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.600]  Didn't leave enough room there.
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:56.120]  So where's Hitler's?
[01:51:56.120 --> 01:51:58.240]  Well, he killed like 35 million people
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:51:59.080]  over all those actions.
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:00.840]  So let's say he's a 70.
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:04.560]  And then Mao Zedong and the Communist Chinese,
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:05.560]  they killed the most.
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:06.680]  They've been a hundred million other people.
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:08.840]  Let's say they're about a 90.
[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:10.840]  They're like way over here.
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:12.360]  And Joe Biden won't say a word about them.
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:15.200]  But he'll say something about yay.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:19.760]  Oh my God, let he without sin cast the first stone.
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:25.560]  On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:28.760]  All right, Mike Adams, when he contacts me,
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:30.120]  because he's usually hard to get on the show,
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:30.960]  he can't get on the show.
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:34.400]  But when he's got a big story and he wants to come on,
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:35.320]  I never even asked.
[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:37.000]  They go, Mike Adams wants on, he's got a big story.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.440]  I go, I'm not even asking what it is,
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:40.880]  though I want what it is.
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:43.240]  Yes, he wants on, he gets on.
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:45.480]  He says, this is huge.
[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:46.520]  And so this morning I'm like,
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:48.600]  oh, I said last night get Mike on when he wants on.
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:50.360]  I didn't, I got busy, I didn't look.
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:51.520]  What's he want to cover?
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:54.640]  They brought me the story and I was like,
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:56.160]  oh, I know about this.
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:00.000]  I've only mentioned this a few times in 28 years on air.
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:03.680]  But this is one of the central things my dad,
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:05.800]  when I was a little kid, explained to me
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:08.880]  about culture and society as a study
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:12.120]  that the establishment really believes in
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:15.760]  and really follows in its sealed rat colony studies.
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:22.280]  And it's one of the biggest studies ever done
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:25.360]  and there's film footage of it.
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:29.480]  And we're going to describe it next hour.
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:31.040]  But let me tell you what happens.
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:33.520]  They build up the rat colony and all this food
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:35.320]  and they know in studies, I'm not comparing this to rats,
[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:37.280]  but whether it's what drugs we use
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:39.960]  or what things we take, rats have the closest
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:43.680]  physiological response to humans as any other animal
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:44.840]  except for pigs.
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:47.560]  And we're not really that related to rats or pigs
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:49.160]  that closely, but the point is,
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:51.240]  is that rats and pigs
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:58.320]  are the closest, not just in drug tests
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.400]  or chemical tests or poison tests,
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:03.920]  but also in societal studies how we operate
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:06.520]  and when rats get herded together
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:08.760]  and locked in, even if they have enough food,
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:13.120]  they start becoming transgender.
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:17.240]  They start killing their babies, they go crazy
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:20.880]  and a bunch of other things happen.
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:22.520]  And then you look at what the globalists are doing
[01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:25.240]  on every level, they are trying to artificially
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:28.400]  create an atmosphere or an environment
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:31.000]  that mimics the study with the mega systems
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.760]  and the mega cities and the rest of it.
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:37.280]  So yes, this is a very important study
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:39.160]  and we're gonna be looking at it next hour
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:42.640]  to understand the rat maze we've been artificially put in
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:46.080]  and why we're smartly, instinctively, spiritually
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:49.480]  at a gut level, exiting to the countryside
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:50.840]  and the globalists are coming in
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:53.280]  with all their carbon and control to shut that down
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:55.800]  all over the world, whether you're in Venezuela
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:57.240]  or whether you're in the Netherlands
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:58.200]  or whether you're in the UK
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:00.680]  or whether you're in Canada, the US or Australia,
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:02.960]  the policies are shut down,
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:06.360]  self-sufficient local communities, don't let them happen.
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:08.200]  Make everybody go into high rives,
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:10.160]  stacked on each other, systems,
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:12.820]  then turn the police off and watch what happens.
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:19.360]  Modern cities are extermination, collapse, kill grids.
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:22.440]  And China is just five years ahead of us.
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.480]  Everything you see there is directed
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:27.560]  by a world secretariat of scientists
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:31.320]  and their technocracy as a test
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:32.560]  to see can they get their own people
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:33.720]  to go against their own interests
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:35.080]  and do this to their fellow humans.
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:38.600]  And then the concentric levels of a successive approximation
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:41.720]  slowly turn up the heat of the control
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:44.120]  until you normalize the mass psychosis
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:45.860]  and the mob psychology.
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:50.280]  Now, we're gonna go to break, come back with Mike Adams.
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:51.800]  We have a lot of big announcements.
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:54.240]  I have declared personal bankruptcy
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:55.600]  because I don't have any money.
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:59.200]  That's fine, I don't measure myself by that, okay?
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:01.160]  And it'll all be published, it'll all be out there
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:03.480]  and you'll see what liars they were the whole time,
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:04.520]  not just my company.
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:07.480]  But that means in sub chapter five under chapter 11,
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:09.440]  this place will continue on as long as it
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:12.240]  can just make money and pay the bills forever.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:15.400]  Me personally, it'll be put up and shut up,
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:16.560]  they don't have all this money they claim,
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:18.400]  if they lied about it.
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:19.760]  And I'm out of money.
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:21.680]  So I just wanna keep M4 Wars going,
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:22.600]  that's what I'm committed to,

[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:53.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:57.120]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:03.200]  This program contains language and sequences
[02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:05.200]  some viewers may find disturbing.
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:09.200]  The nation, and all of our freedoms hang by a thread,
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:11.200]  and the military apparatus of this country
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:13.200]  is about to be handed over to SCUM,
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:17.200]  more beholden to SCUM, Russian SCUM.
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:25.200]  Listen, please listen.

[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:33.200]  then the same incredible terror that's menacing me
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:34.200]  will strike in you!
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:37.200]  The function of all life is survival.
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:39.200]  Sleep.
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:41.200]  Sleep.
[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:43.200]  Sleep.

[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:46.200]  Lock the door.
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:47.200]  Lock the door.
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:48.200]  They're coming!
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:49.200]  Help!
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.200]  Help!
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.200]  They're coming!
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:52.200]  They're coming!

[02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:57.200]  You're next!
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:58.200]  They're in danger!
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:59.200]  Please listen to me!
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:00.200]  It's something terrible!
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:01.200]  Please!
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:02.200]  You're next!
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:03.200]  Here they are!
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:04.200]  Help!
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:05.200]  You're next!
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:06.200]  They're coming!
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:07.200]  They're coming!
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:08.200]  Sleep.
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:09.200]  The seed is planted.
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:10.200]  Sleep.
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:12.200]  Sleep.
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:14.200]  Terror grows.
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:16.200]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:17.200]  I'll get you when you sleep!
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:18.200]  Sit up!
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:21.200]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:24.200]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:26.200]  Is it contagious?
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:27.200]  It's real!
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:28.200]  Real homies!
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:29.200]  It looked right at me.
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:30.200]  You need to get out!
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:32.200]  You're looking at it as if it was human,
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:33.200]  not human.
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:38.200]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:40.200]  We're being cornered.
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:43.200]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:45.200]  They're barricading the street.
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:49.200]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:02:03.200]  The land of the walking dead.
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:22.200]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:24.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:26.200]  Because that's what Americans do now.
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:29.200]  They're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:33.200]  in exchange for the feeling, the illusion of security.
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:38.200]  What we have now is a completely neurotic population obsessed
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:42.200]  with security and safety and crime and drugs and cleanliness
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:44.200]  and hygiene and germs.
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:45.200]  There's another thing.
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:46.200]  Germs.
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:49.200]  Where did this sudden fear of germs come from?
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:50.200]  In this country.
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:51.200]  Have you noticed this?
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:55.200]  The media constantly running stories about all the latest infections.
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:59.200]  Elminella, E. coli, hand to virus, bird flu.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:01.200]  And the Americans are, they panic easily.
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:04.200]  So now everybody's running around scrubbing this and spraying that
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:07.200]  and overcooking their food and repeatedly washing their hands,
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:09.200]  trying to avoid all contact with germs.
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:13.200]  It's ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous lengths.
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:14.200]  Fear of germs.
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:17.200]  Why these f***ing f***ies?
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:19.200]  Hey, where's your sense of adventure?
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:21.200]  Take a f***ing chance, will you?
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:25.200]  Besides, what do you think you have an immune system for?
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:27.200]  It's for killing germs.
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:28.200]  But it needs practice.
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:32.200]  It needs germs to practice on.
[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:35.200]  So, so listen.
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:37.200]  So listen.
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:42.200]  If you kill all the germs around you and live a completely sterile life,
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:45.200]  then when germs do come along, you're not going to be prepared.
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:46.200]  And never mind ordinary germs.
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:49.200]  What are you going to do when some super virus comes along
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:52.200]  that turns your vital organs into liquid s***?
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:54.200]  I'll tell you what you're going to do.
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:55.200]  You're going to get sick.
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:56.200]  You're going to die and you're going to deserve it
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:04:00.200]  because you're f***ing weak and you got a f***ing weak immune system.
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:05.200]  Now, hey, can I kill you?
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:10.200]  Hey, let me tell you a true story about immunization, okay?
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:13.200]  When I was a little boy in New York City in the 1940s,
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:17.200]  we swam in the Hudson River and it was filled with raw sewage.
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:18.200]  Okay?
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:23.200]  We swam in raw sewage, you know, to cool off.
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:26.200]  And at that time, the big fear was polio.
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:28.200]  Thousands of kids died from polio every year.
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:29.200]  But you know something?
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:31.200]  In my neighborhood, no one ever got polio.
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:32.200]  No one ever.
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:33.200]  You know why?
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:37.200]  Because we swam in raw sewage.
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:39.200]  It strengthened our immune systems.
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:41.200]  The polio never had a prayer.
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:48.200]  And we were tempered in raw s***.
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:51.200]  My Adams has huge news straight ahead.
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:53.200]  Everybody, you know, tune in now.
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:59.200]  This is critical to understanding the globalist.
[02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:01.200]  December 2022 is here.
[02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:04.200]  And we are proud and very excited to announce
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:08.200]  that free shipping is back at infowarstore.com.
[02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:12.200]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:16.200]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company
[02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:21.200]  and they're able to cut our regular shipping cost by up to 50%.
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:24.200]  So that means even on orders that are below $50,
[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:27.200]  you're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:29.200]  This is a game changer.
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:30.200]  We're so excited about it.
[02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:32.200]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:34.200]  We couldn't afford it before.
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:36.200]  But by moving to a bigger national distributor,
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:37.200]  we're able to do it.
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:40.200]  Now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:42.200]  The same great customer service and more.
[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:45.200]  So get huge discounts and free shipping
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:49.200]  on so many great items at infowarstore.com right now.
[02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:51.200]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:53.200]  But now there's no excuse to boost your immune system,
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:56.200]  lead a healthier life, and keep invoices on the air.
[02:05:56.200 --> 02:06:22.200]  That's where I come.
[02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:30.200]  So an authoritarian world government is in place.
[02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:35.200]  It's shutting down farming, shutting down fertilizer,
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:37.200]  locking down the third world to starve them to death
[02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:40.200]  so they collapse and flood us.
[02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:43.200]  And when you actually read the different books written
[02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:47.200]  by top globalists in Obama's Science R and others,
[02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:49.200]  they tell you the plan.
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:52.200]  Heard us into compact cities, cut off the resources,
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:55.200]  and then watch us kill each other.
[02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:57.200]  Well, the globalists are going to live in rural areas
[02:06:57.200 --> 02:07:00.200]  in special elite reservations where they believe
[02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:02.200]  they're going to be protected.
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:05.200]  But by being aware of Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030,
[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:06.200]  we can beat it.
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:09.200]  That's why if you watch my film, In Game, made in 2007,
[02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:12.200]  I talk about this rat study that we're about to cover
[02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:16.200]  that the globalists are obsessed with.
[02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:18.200]  And Mike Adams has done a great job writing a big article
[02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:21.200]  about it for naturalnews.com.
[02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:24.200]  We're going to post the article up on infowars.com as well.
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:26.200]  In the live show feed, we're going to post it on the main page
[02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:28.200]  of infowars as well.
[02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:32.200]  Calhoun's mouse utopia experiments are now coming true
[02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:35.200]  for humanity as self-annihilation and fantasizing
[02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:38.200]  gender distortions become commonplace.
[02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:41.200]  But my issue with this is the globalists are doing everything
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:46.200]  they can to create this scenario
[02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:48.200]  and then admitting they're doing that.
[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:50.200]  They believe a collapse is coming.
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:53.200]  They want to have an organized control collapse up front.
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:56.200]  Red Adair over 100 years ago figured out
[02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:58.200]  the biggest oil field fire company in the world
[02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:02.200]  decades after, even to today,
[02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:04.200]  how to get rid of an oil well fire or a gas fire.
[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:06.200]  They load up a wheelbarrow full of TNT,
[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:09.200]  have somebody roll it in, and the huge explosion
[02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:13.200]  would knock the oxygen out and put the fire out.
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:18.200]  Well, it is the exact same thing here.
[02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:20.200]  And so their argument is they've got to depopulate,
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:22.200]  they've got to create the calamity,
[02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:24.200]  they've got to go ahead and have the artificial war
[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:27.200]  and systems they control to get our numbers down.
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:30.200]  There was even a Star Trek episode in the 1960s
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:33.200]  where they come to a planet where they're constantly
[02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:35.200]  having nuclear wars with each other,
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:37.200]  but they're not real nuclear wars.
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:39.200]  When one country fires at the other with their missiles,
[02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:41.200]  people just get into the disintegration chamber
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:43.200]  so infrastructure's not destroyed.
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:47.200]  It's an allegory of the neutron bomb
[02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:50.200]  that only kills life, not the infrastructure.
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:53.200]  So this is a big, big deal, a big, big window
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:55.200]  into these people.
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:57.200]  I'll play a few clips coming up at the bottom of the hour
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:08:59.200]  from in-game, but I'm so glad that Mike
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:02.200]  has really burrowed into this big report.
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:04.200]  It's so important.
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:06.200]  And of course, we'll also get into the politics
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:08.200]  in the world a little bit later.
[02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:10.200]  And we'll talk about the Yay interview as well
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:12.200]  and so much more with Mike Adams.
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:14.200]  But this is understanding how the technocrats think
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:17.200]  why they're eugenicists, why they're social Darwinists.
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:19.200]  If you understand this study, it's one of three or four
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:21.200]  they follow.
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:23.200]  There's another study where they put bacteria in a petri dish.
[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:26.200]  They bloom, they eat through the cuter
[02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:29.200]  or the supply of food, then they eat each other,
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:31.200]  then they die.
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:33.200]  But we have systems to stop that from happening,
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:35.200]  but they're creating an artificial system
[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:37.200]  to actually carry that out as their pretext
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:40.200]  for total domination of human life
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:42.200]  and playing God.
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:44.200]  So Mike Adams, naturalnews.com, thanks for coming on with us
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:46.200]  about this fascinating study.
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:48.200]  Well, thank you for having me on, Alex.
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:51.200]  And may I offer an observation about yesterday
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:53.200]  that I think is...
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:55.200]  Let's do this. I almost brought up Yay first with you.
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:57.200]  And then, yeah, let's next segment get back into the rat study.
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:59.200]  Let's get into Yay, everyone.
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:02.200]  Okay, I want to mention that you...
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:04.200]  the way you handled that, I think, was brilliant
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:06.200]  because you have a platform
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:08.200]  and here was your guest saying some things
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:10.200]  that you and I find abhorrent
[02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:13.200]  and that I think your audience finds abhorrent as well.
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:15.200]  And yet you did not de-platform.
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:18.200]  You didn't boot him off your set in real time.
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:21.200]  Had you done so, it would have been like you were trapped
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:24.200]  in approving the logic that Big Tech has used
[02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:26.200]  to boot you off their platforms.
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:28.200]  So what you actually demonstrated
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:30.200]  is that censorship is not the answer.
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:33.200]  Let's listen to what people say,
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:36.200]  even if it is abhorrent and understand that
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:39.200]  in that segment yesterday, Yay did not convince anybody
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:41.200]  to follow what he was saying.
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:44.200]  He was not convincing or persuasive to anyone.
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:46.200]  People were watching it and hearing it.
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:48.200]  The world did not end.
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:51.200]  And yet, we were still able to preserve
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:53.200]  the philosophy of free speech,
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:55.200]  which means we are able to hear speech
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:57.200]  with which we strongly disagree.
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:59.200]  So I just want to point that out.
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:01.200]  I think you handled it perfectly.
[02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:03.200]  That's a great point.
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:05.200]  And I didn't talk to you in the last few weeks,
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:07.200]  but I think we're basically the same mind.
[02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:09.200]  We're both immersed in this.
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:11.200]  They act like just because something isn't true
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:13.200]  or something might not be right or something is abhorrent,
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:15.200]  they should never have a right to say it.
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:17.200]  Once you have that logic, then by that logic,
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:19.200]  anything they list is bad, even though it's not to be banned.
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:21.200]  So you've got to support the unpopular speech
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:23.200]  or things you disagree with,
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:25.200]  or your speech will be taken.
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:27.200]  That's level one.
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:29.200]  Level two is we need to hear the bad ideas
[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:31.200]  and the bad debates and aren't afraid of having a discussion
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:33.200]  and telling somebody how they're wrong
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:35.200]  and then educating people.
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:37.200]  And then he's also seeing it black and white.
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:39.200]  Well, if the West is really bad or screwed Germany over,
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:41.200]  well, then he's okay.
[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:43.200]  No, that's how Hitler sold the Germans on doing what they did.
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:45.200]  Yeah, they got screwed over World War I.
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:47.200]  Yeah, the West started World War I.
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:49.200]  Yeah, they assassinated the king of the Austrian
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:51.200]  and Hungarian Empire, the Crown Prince.
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:53.200]  So we all know that.
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:55.200]  The point is it's not like, well, Hitler's good
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:57.200]  or the other group's good or Hitler's bad.
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:59.200]  It's way more complex.
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:01.200]  And so that's why I tried to...
[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:03.200]  He also wasn't going to come here and get into that.
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:05.200]  I didn't tell him he couldn't.
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:07.200]  Once they got off on it,
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:09.200]  it just became like an obsession
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:11.200]  and it just went on and on.
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:13.200]  We all pray for Kanye
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:15.200]  to get whatever help he needs
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:17.200]  to get right with what's going on with himself.
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:19.200]  I mean, we want
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:21.200]  to bring God and Jesus into people's lives.
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:23.200]  So I'll just say that
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:25.200]  and end it there.
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:27.200]  I mean, there are mass murderers
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:29.200]  who are living today
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:31.200]  who I believe have murdered
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:33.200]  or they've been complicit in the murder of far more people
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:35.200]  than Hitler did.
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:37.200]  And those people are guests on CNN,
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:39.200]  by the way.
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:41.200]  And in my opinion, this is my opinion,
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:43.200]  I believe Fauci is complicit
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:45.200]  in the mass murder of millions,
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:47.200]  even tens of millions globally,
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:49.200]  of human beings.
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:51.200]  And so why is it okay for the mainstream media
[02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:53.200]  to have that kind
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:55.200]  of monster of society,
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:57.200]  a monster against humanity,
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:12:59.200]  to have him and celebrate him and give him awards?
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:01.200]  And then they would
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:03.200]  condemn the speech of someone like Yay,
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:05.200]  which of course, again,
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:07.200]  we found his speech abhorrent,
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:09.200]  and yet Yay himself has not killed anybody
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:11.200]  to my knowledge.
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:13.200]  So we need to keep that perspective
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:15.200]  in mind as we hear these words
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:17.200]  and we think about who the media is celebrating.
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:19.200]  The media is celebrating
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:21.200]  mass murderers every day, in my opinion.
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:23.200]  And so we should hit that first.
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:25.200]  Rand Paul just gets better and better.
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:27.200]  He says, look, Fauci created the virus,
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:29.200]  we're gonna get him, he's red-handed,
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:31.200]  he's going to prison, that's the truth.
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:33.200]  And we'll talk about that in a moment,
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:35.200]  but since you mentioned it, here's Madeleine Albright,
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:37.200]  for those that don't know,
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:39.200]  Clinton tripled the sanctions that George Herbert Walker Bush
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:41.200]  put in.
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:43.200]  They estimate his sanctions killed about a half million.
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:45.200]  The sanctions carried out
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:47.200]  by the Clinton crime network
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:49.200]  killed over a million and a half,
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:51.200]  million children. She said she'd do it again.
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:53.200]  It was a good price to pay.
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:55.200]  They lauded her like she was
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:57.200]  Mother Teresa when she died last year.
[02:13:57.200 --> 02:13:59.200]  That's how sick it is.
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:01.200]  I'm bad for questioning the shooting.
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:03.200]  She's good for killing 500,000 children.
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:05.200]  Here's the clip.
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:07.200]  We have heard
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:09.200]  that a half a million children have died.
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:11.200]  I mean, that's more
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:13.200]  children than died when
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:15.200]  in Hiroshima.
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:17.200]  And, you know,
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:19.200]  the price worth it.
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:21.200]  I think this is a very hard choice,
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:23.200]  but the price we think the price
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:25.200]  is worth it.
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:27.200]  Okay, so I don't want to hear that
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:29.200]  Yay's bad or I'm bad or anybody's bad,
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:31.200]  but these are Hitler level statements,
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:33.200]  but because it's a woman, it's like, oh, well, it's a woman.
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:35.200]  It's like Hillary said, yeah, we made
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:37.200]  Libby a fail and killed hundreds of thousands
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:39.200]  and laughed about it. It's like, what,
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:41.200]  because you're a fat woman in a suit,
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:43.200]  you're allowed to kill everybody now?
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:45.200]  Yeah, this is the thing.
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:47.200]  We're not only announcing mass extermination
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:49.200]  of humanity at levels
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:51.200]  that are orders of magnitude worse
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:53.200]  than what Hitler did in World War II.
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:55.200]  You know, think about it.
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:57.200]  Six million Jews were annihilated
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:14:59.200]  according to the historical records.
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:01.200]  Well, these globals today want to kill
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:03.200]  six billion or more human beings.
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:05.200]  That's a thousand times more people.
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:07.200]  This is a thousand holocausts
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:09.200]  that they are attempting to carry out
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:11.200]  with food scarcity, engineered starvation,
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:13.200]  engineered energy destruction,
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:15.200]  the mRNA injections, the infertility,
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:17.200]  the myocarditis, all of it, right?
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:19.200]  So we're talking about a thousand holocausts
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:21.200]  that the media is ignoring
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:23.200]  and they pretend that's not happening.
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:25.200]  So they have no pedestal
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:27.200]  from which to lecture people like you
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:29.200]  or me or frankly, yeah,
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:31.200]  or anybody else for that matter until the media
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:33.200]  comes clean with their complicity
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:35.200]  in this mass genocide against humanity.
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:37.200]  Beautifully said. I'm going to try to shut up
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:39.200]  when we come back and give you the floor to get into
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:41.200]  the study so much more.
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:43.200]  Hopefully, you'll see us a little bit in the next hour
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:45.200]  because we need to catch up on a lot.
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:47.200]  My cat is naturalnews.com.
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:49.200]  Be sure to bookmark that and share it.
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:51.200]  Everybody already does and infowars.com as well
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:53.200]  because people are really hungry for the truth now.
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:55.200]  Now's the time to go on infowars.com
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:57.200]  and man.videonaturalnews.com.
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:11.200]  I've got some good news and bad news.
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:13.200]  The bad news is a bunch of our best selling products
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:15.200]  have already sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:17.200]  It will be months and months
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:19.200]  until these great products come back in.
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:21.200]  X3 sold out.
[02:16:21.200 --> 02:16:23.200]  Our great American coffee blend
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:25.200]  has sold out.
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:27.200]  But what hasn't sold out is
[02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:29.200]  DNA Force Plus,
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:31.200]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion,
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:33.200]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula,
[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:35.200]  Whole Food Multivitamin,
[02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:37.200]  Rain Force Ultra,
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:39.200]  Super Mill Vitality and so much more.
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:41.200]  So, you've only got a few weeks
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:43.200]  to get these products at the lowest price
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:45.200]  you're ever going to find them.
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:47.200]  Don't fight the crowds. Don't fight the traffic.
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:49.200]  Don't do all your Christmas shopping in a month
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:51.200]  like a fool. Do it now.
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:53.200]  Get it all over with. Get a great deal.
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:55.200]  Keep Info Wars on the air while I'm powering your body.
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:17:24.200]  InfoWarsStore.com
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:27.200]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:29.200]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:31.200]  with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass,
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:33.200]  the super Tim Cass IRL.
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:35.200]  Listen, what I'm saying is,
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:37.200]  do not take Alex Jones and Bandot
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:39.200]  video for granted
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:41.200]  because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:43.200]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:45.200]  So, go check out the store.
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:47.200]  Go support their store. Go support InfoWars.
[02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:49.200]  Leave a donation right now.
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:51.200]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:53.200]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:55.200]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:17:59.200]  Once a tragedy reaches a level
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:01.200]  of national significance,
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:03.200]  American citizens should be allowed
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:05.200]  to basically question that event
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:07.200]  in any way that they deem fit.
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:09.200]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:11.200]  That's what they want to take away.
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:13.200]  Your ability to speak freely.
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:15.200]  So, they're going to go for Mike Lindell next.
[02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:17.200]  Or they're going to go for Steve Bannon.
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:19.200]  Or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:21.200]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago,
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:23.200]  and I knew they were planning all of this.
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:25.200]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:27.200]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:29.200]  And now, because we've been so successful
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:31.200]  warning the population of the planet, not just America,
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:33.200]  we're public enemy number one
[02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:35.200]  when it comes to globalist agenda.
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:37.200]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:39.200]  how successful InfoWars has been
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:41.200]  because of your past support.
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:43.200]  So, I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now
[02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:45.200]  to critical juncture of the battle
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:47.200]  for your double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:49.200]  and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:51.200]  1776 is the promo code.

[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:55.200]  And I thank you all for your support.
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:18:59.200]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process,
[02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:01.200]  the only thing that made
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:03.200]  any Republican victories tonight possible.
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:05.200]  The only thing that made any resistance
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:07.200]  to the war machine possible.
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:09.200]  The only thing that made any
[02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:11.200]  opposition to the lockdowns
[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:13.200]  and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:15.200]  and the forced vaccines
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:17.200]  and the dangerous drugs possible.
[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:19.200]  It made
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:21.200]  any resistance to it possible
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:23.200]  was people continuing to support InfoWars
[02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:25.200]  despite the massive
[02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:27.200]  lawfare being waged against InfoWars
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:29.200]  despite the media defamatory libelist
[02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:31.200]  campaign against InfoWars.
[02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:33.200]  The ordinary people,
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:35.200]  the everyday people that buy products
[02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:37.200]  that make their own lives healthier,
[02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:39.200]  wealthier and wiser is what keeps
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:41.200]  InfoWars on the air and what that does
[02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:43.200]  is keep the populist message
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:45.200]  alive in an era and an age
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:47.200]  of totalitarian oppression.
[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:49.200]  So continue to do it.
[02:19:49.200 --> 02:19:51.200]  Go to places like InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:53.200]  Go to places like Save InfoWars.
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:55.200]  Continue to keep InfoWars alive
[02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:57.200]  because in the process you're keeping
[02:19:57.200 --> 02:19:59.200]  American liberty alive.
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:01.200]  Leading a frontal assault
[02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:03.200]  on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:15.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:35.200]  New World Order Historian
[02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:37.200]  Jade Iyer will host 45 minutes
[02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:39.200]  so we can get into the rat study that's so huge.
[02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:41.200]  Next segment I want to go back
[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:43.200]  to Mike and what the current globalists are doing.
[02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:45.200]  What's happening with Fauci.
[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:47.200]  We're getting real traction
[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:49.200]  on him creating the virus
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:51.200]  and the gain of function.
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:53.200]  And what Senator Paul's saying, quote, we will get you.
[02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:55.200]  We've caught you red-handed. You won't get away with it.
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:57.200]  You're going to go to prison.
[02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:59.200]  Rand Paul's got a lot of courage
[02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:01.200]  for folks that don't know. Very dangerous
[02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:03.200]  for the power he's got and the respectability
[02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:05.200]  to do that to the globalists.
[02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:07.200]  So he's putting his life
[02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:09.200]  out there
[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:11.200]  on the line.
[02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:13.200]  It is a really, really big deal
[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:15.200]  and so just covering the waterfront in this segment
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:17.200]  all the other big developments
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:19.200]  and things that are happening, Mike Adams.
[02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:21.200]  Wow, well
[02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:23.200]  just to kind of tease up what we're going to talk about
[02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:25.200]  in the Calhoun segment
[02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:27.200]  coming up next segment, I got to tell you Alex
[02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:29.200]  the entire theory of overpopulation
[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:31.200]  is wrong and a lot of that
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:33.200]  theory was based on this particular study.
[02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:35.200]  Turns out it's not overpopulation
[02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:37.200]  that destroys societies.
[02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:39.200]  There aren't too many people.
[02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:41.200]  What happens is we've turned our world
[02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:43.200]  into a welfare state where people
[02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:45.200]  have lost the ability to transfer knowledge
[02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:47.200]  to their offspring or to even
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:49.200]  have viable offspring that know how to navigate
[02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:51.200]  the world and navigate challenges
[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:53.200]  and that's exactly what they're implementing.
[02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:55.200]  So hold your powder because I want to
[02:21:55.200 --> 02:21:57.200]  as one big congruent report, this is so important
[02:21:57.200 --> 02:21:59.200]  I want to really have you
[02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:01.200]  go through this. This is so revolutionary
[02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:03.200]  and extrapolating this
[02:22:03.200 --> 02:22:05.200]  clearly from your researcher and scientists as well
[02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:07.200]  they're using this model to artificially
[02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:09.200]  do this today.
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:11.200]  Well yes, exactly. So
[02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:13.200]  they are using that, they think
[02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:15.200]  it's true and they're using that to say
[02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:17.200]  to themselves, the globalists, saying that
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:19.200]  they are saving the future of humanity
[02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:21.200]  by depopulating the world
[02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:23.200]  and carrying out genocide.
[02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:25.200]  So that's why then they unleash the
[02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:27.200]  engineered food scarcity, the energy
[02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:29.200]  destruction, the
[02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:31.200]  culture wars, the destruction of the family
[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:33.200]  and so on.
[02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:35.200]  Because again, they tell themselves
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:37.200]  they're saving the world but they're not. They're actually
[02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:39.200]  complicit in the destruction of the world
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:41.200]  and we're going to expose all of this
[02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:43.200]  and turn this around and
[02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:45.200]  look, the truth is that
[02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:47.200]  our planet can support
[02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:49.200]  far more than 8 billion people
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:51.200]  by the way and we just crossed 8 billion
[02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:53.200]  we can support far more
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:55.200]  we're going to lose, I think, 1 to 2
[02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:57.200]  billion people, Alex, in the next decade
[02:22:57.200 --> 02:22:59.200]  because of what the globalists have already
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:01.200]  set into motion. I literally
[02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:03.200]  think we're going to lose at least 1
[02:23:03.200 --> 02:23:05.200]  billion people and it's not just the vaccines
[02:23:05.200 --> 02:23:07.200]  it is the starvation. Look
[02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:09.200]  at what's happening in Europe. The energy has been
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:11.200]  cut off partly because of the Nord Stream
[02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:13.200]  pipelines as you know but
[02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:15.200]  in addition, the European culture
[02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:17.200]  of the government there has said
[02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:19.200]  we are not allowing you
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:21.200]  the people to extract resources
[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:23.200]  from European land. So
[02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:25.200]  they are basically trying to dissociate humanity from the birds.
[02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:27.200]  Including basic farming. They put
[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:29.200]  the head of the Netherlands who's cutting off
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:31.200]  their farms in charge of the whole system
[02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:33.200]  to shut down farms worldwide. That is direct
[02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:35.200]  genocide. That's not cutting off pipelines
[02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:37.200]  to cars. That's cutting off the food pipeline
[02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:39.200]  to humans. That is the definition of
[02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:41.200]  siege. Well, yes
[02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:43.200]  and Alex, I'm telling
[02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:45.200]  you, they are going to unleash another
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:47.200]  massive pandemic to try to put people
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:49.200]  into camps when the uprising
[02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:51.200]  gets bad which is going to happen sometime
[02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:53.200]  in 2023, especially in Europe.
[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:55.200]  So people are going to freeze the starved
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:57.200]  death. People are going to lose their jobs
[02:23:57.200 --> 02:23:59.200]  like never before. There's a de-industrialization
[02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:01.200]  of Europe that is accelerating. Shutdown
[02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:03.200]  of so many companies. All the metals
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:05.200]  smelting operations, glass manufacturers.
[02:24:05.200 --> 02:24:07.200]  Listen, I'm going to just stop you though.
[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:09.200]  I don't want people to understand. This isn't your opinion.
[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:11.200]  This is their plan and when you said
[02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:13.200]  we're going to stop them. We have
[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:15.200]  senators. We have Rand Paul. We have world
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:17.200]  leaders listening to you and I and this audience.
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:19.200]  So we tell the audience this show and your show
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:21.200]  and others is beyond critical to the future
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:23.200]  of humanity. That's not bragging people. This
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:25.200]  is life and death. We know their battle
[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:27.200]  plan. We know how to beat them and we're
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:29.200]  getting traction. That's why we're so
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:31.200]  important and we need your support and your word
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:33.200]  of mouth. This is a total war. It's
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:35.200]  coming. I have children. I want to stop
[02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:37.200]  this. This is not a game. Sorry.
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:39.200]  Well, not at all. Actually,
[02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:41.200]  I appreciate you interrupting because
[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:43.200]  this is a back and forth and you add emphasis
[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:45.200]  and new questions that I hadn't
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:47.200]  thought of as well. So interrupt. I mean, it's your show.
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:49.200]  Do interrupt anytime you want. I want to say
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:51.200]  I don't want people to get how much trouble
[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:53.200]  we're in and how real this is. This
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:55.200]  is a world collapse plan. We've got
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:57.200]  to stop it.
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:24:59.200]  But I was speaking face to face
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:01.200]  with international war correspondent
[02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:03.200]  Michael Yon yesterday.
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:05.200]  I encourage you to have him on if you haven't
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:07.200]  yet. Michael Yon told me
[02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:09.200]  point blank. He said, look, I've studied
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:11.200]  famines. I've studied war and pandemics
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:13.200]  and collapse. He's an avid reader.
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:15.200]  There are hundreds of famines throughout
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:17.200]  the history of Japan and Thailand and Asia
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:19.200]  and Ireland and so on. He says, look, in
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:21.200]  every famine, there are certain local
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:23.200]  communities that survive with
[02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:25.200]  zero losses while other communities
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:27.200]  are wiped out around them. And the
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:29.200]  difference is that the leaders of those
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:31.200]  local communities taught
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:33.200]  decentralization of food
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:35.200]  production. So they were teaching
[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:37.200]  people to store food and to learn how to
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:39.200]  grow food. And as a result, even
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:41.200]  when famines wiped out huge
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:43.200]  ranges of populations, in some cases
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:45.200]  30, 40, 50 percent of the existing
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:47.200]  population, there were pockets that
[02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:49.200]  were zero percent loss.
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:51.200]  Say what you want about the Mormons.
[02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:53.200]  They have been dead right on this.
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:55.200]  Well, exactly. And a lot of other groups
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:57.200]  and preppers have been proven right
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:25:59.200]  again and again. So here's the bottom
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:01.200]  line. Yes, the globalists
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:03.200]  are going to kill billions of people.
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:05.200]  We're hard to kill.
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:07.200]  Right? So your listeners,
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:09.200]  you and I and the people that we know, the
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:11.200]  people that we run with, we are very
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:13.200]  hard to kill. We are going
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:15.200]  to be able to survive this, even though
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:17.200]  the oblivious masses, sadly, as much as
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:19.200]  we try to warn them, they refuse to
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:21.200]  prepare. And let me make this announcement
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:23.200]  now, and I'm going to give you the floor to
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:25.200]  come back, but this is important. This is
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:27.200]  what I think about Nipers at the time.
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:29.200]  We're not going to be able to save things
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:31.200]  now, folks. We can back it off. No, we're not.
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:33.200]  Make their plan be terminated later, but
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:35.200]  the collapse they've already initiated, the
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:37.200]  first phase, we're not getting out of it. So
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:39.200]  people should now spend 50% of their time
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:41.200]  getting ready to protect yourself. The other
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:43.200]  50 trying to mitigate how bad it's going to get, but
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:45.200]  we've passed the point of being able to stop this
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:47.200]  now. So people just better get ready.
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:49.200]  Completely agree.
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:51.200]  We're past the Rubicon on this.
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:53.200]  There are billions, again,
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:55.200]  at minimum one billion, maybe more
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:57.200]  who will not make it. That's
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:26:59.200]  my opinion. And by the way, I'm
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:01.200]  sorry about my video quality is not the best. We're
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:03.200]  trying to set up a new studio here with
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:05.200]  fiber optics and everything. We're trying to make
[02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:07.200]  it a better place to have
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:09.200]  better broadcast.
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:11.200]  We're in the process of that. Thank you for
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:13.200]  your patience. You're doing great. It looks great,
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:15.200]  Mike. Well,
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:17.200]  we don't have the lighting figured out. Everything
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:19.200]  takes a year longer than it should and you can't
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:21.200]  get parts and things like that. So you know how
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:23.200]  that goes. But the point is, we are going to
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:25.200]  make this through. I want to be clear. Your
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:27.200]  listeners are going to make it through when
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:29.200]  they've taken action. And you have to,
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:31.200]  I say, not only stockpile food, you need
[02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:33.200]  to stockpile nutrition because in all
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:35.200]  ways, you take InfoWars store products, for
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:37.200]  example. Some of those ingredients, you've
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:39.200]  had so much difficulty getting them over the
[02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:41.200]  last 18 months, there's going to be a day where
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:43.200]  they're not available. And it's not just
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:45.200]  the ingredients, it's the parts. You know
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:47.200]  this. Your manufacturers
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:49.200]  know this. The lids,
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:51.200]  the bottles, the labels.
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:53.200]  We are looking at like a nine-month backlog
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:55.200]  on labels for supplements right
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:57.200]  now. The lids like spray bottles, squeeze
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:27:59.200]  bottle tops, all of these things are just
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:01.200]  gone from the supply system.
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:03.200]  So you've got to have backup supplies. And
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:05.200]  if you don't have good nutrition, you're
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:07.200]  not going to be able to heal yourself from
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:09.200]  the insults that are coming as the collapse
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:11.200]  kicks in. When you face starvation
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:13.200]  and a lack of emergency response medicine
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:15.200]  and other people are getting sick
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:17.200]  and dying around you, you need the best nutrition
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:19.200]  possible. I remember like you were on in
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:21.200]  February, February and March of 2020
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:23.200]  months and months before they even said
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:25.200]  lockdown, saying the lockdown is coming. It
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:27.200]  will be here because you had the intel. So do
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:29.200]  we. We're not lying to your people.
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:31.200]  We know what we're talking about. This is not a
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:33.200]  game. This is life and death. And I'm being
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:35.200]  really stern with people right now because
[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:37.200]  I'm being stern myself and my family.
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:39.200]  We've got to get ready.
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:41.200]  100% get ready or get
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:43.200]  dead, folks. It really is that simple.
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:45.200]  But the good news is that surviving
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:47.200]  this is very possible. Just take
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:49.200]  action now. You can do it. All right. We're
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:51.200]  going to start the real interview when we come
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:53.200]  back. We're going to get into the studies, the
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:55.200]  big picture. Mike Adams straight ahead. Stay
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:57.200]  with us.
[02:28:57.200 --> 02:28:59.200]  Christmas 2022

[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:03.200]  to introduce to you

[02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:15.200]  and healthcare systems.

[02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:41.200]  Find out
[02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:43.200]  how even the FDA
[02:32:43.200 --> 02:32:45.200]  and the government admits fish oil
[02:32:45.200 --> 02:32:47.200]  is incredible. The number one thing
[02:32:47.200 --> 02:32:49.200]  anybody can do for themselves
[02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:51.200]  is take good fish oil
[02:32:51.200 --> 02:32:53.200]  or Crill Oil. Just like our

[02:32:57.200 --> 02:32:59.200]  Leading
[02:32:59.200 --> 02:33:01.200]  of frontal assault on the lies
[02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:03.200]  of the New World Order
[02:33:03.200 --> 02:33:05.200]  it's Alex Jones
[02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:17.200]  MegaCities
[02:33:17.200 --> 02:33:19.200]  Designed
[02:33:19.200 --> 02:33:21.200]  to carry out
[02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:23.200]  the deprivation and disintegration
[02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:25.200]  that was documented
[02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:27.200]  in rat studies. Like Adam's
[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:29.200]  big report on it coming up in a moment
[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:31.200]  here's just two minutes from my
[02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:33.200]  intro from the seminal film
[02:33:33.200 --> 02:34:01.200]  in 2007.
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:05.200]  Close to 80% of the earth's population
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:07.200]  has been eliminated.
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:09.200]  The remnants
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:11.200]  of a once free humanity
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:13.200]  are forced to live within highly controlled
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:15.200]  compact prison like cities.
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:17.200]  Travel
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:19.200]  is highly restricted.
[02:34:19.200 --> 02:34:21.200]  Super highways connect
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:23.200]  the MegaCities and keep the population
[02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:25.200]  from entering into unauthorized
[02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:27.200]  zones.
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:29.200]  No human activities private.
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:31.200]  AI supercomputers
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:33.200]  chronicle and categorize every action.
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:35.200]  A prison
[02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:37.200]  planet dominated by a ruthless
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:39.200]  gang of control freaks
[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:41.200]  whose power can never be challenged.
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:43.200]  This is the vision of the global
[02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:45.200]  elite, their goal.
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:47.200]  A program of total
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:49.200]  dehumanization where the science
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:51.200]  of tyranny is lost.
[02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:53.200]  A worldwide control grid
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:55.200]  designed to ensure the overlords
[02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:57.200]  monopoly of power forever.
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:34:59.200]  Our species will be condemned
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:01.200]  to this nightmare future
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:03.200]  unless the masses are awakened
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:05.200]  to the New World Order master plan
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:07.200]  and mobilized to defeat it.
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:09.200]  Erected
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:11.200]  by a secretive group
[02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:13.200]  the Georgia Guidestones
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:15.200]  are a testament to the elite's plan
[02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:17.200]  for a world religion
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:19.200]  global laws
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:21.200]  with a global court and army to enforce it.
[02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:25.200]  And set in stone
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:27.200]  it is written that the population
[02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:29.200]  will rise above 500 million.
[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:35.200]  Alright Mike, start over.
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:37.200]  Break it all down. This is literally the skeleton key
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:39.200]  the Rosetta Stone
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:41.200]  to understanding their plan for us.
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:43.200]  Break down this very important study
[02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:45.200]  Calhoun's mouse utopia experiment.
[02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:47.200]  Alright, so scientists named Calhoun ran
[02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:49.200]  these experiments in the late 1950s
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:51.200]  and the early 1960s
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:53.200]  and it was written up in major scientific
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:55.200]  magazines and even the Smithsonian
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:57.200]  and here's what it was. He built
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:35:59.200]  a little mouse city.
[02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:01.200]  It was actually maybe 10, 12 feet across
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:03.200]  and created unlimited
[02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:05.200]  resources for the mice that he put in there.
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:07.200]  He started with eight mice.
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:09.200]  He had unlimited food, unlimited water
[02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:11.200]  and essentially unlimited space.
[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:13.200]  And of course the population took off
[02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:15.200]  initially and the
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:17.200]  population doubling time was
[02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:19.200]  very short. They were able to have offspring
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:21.200]  and again, unlimited food.
[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:23.200]  So it was a giant welfare state for mice.
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:25.200]  This was also repeated with rats by the way
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:27.200]  with the same results.
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:29.200]  Now, long story short
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:31.200]  within a few
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:33.200]  generations, it was population zero.
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:35.200]  The entire
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:37.200]  population of mice or rats
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:39.200]  collapsed and
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:41.200]  as the final stage was emerging
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:43.200]  before the collapse
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:45.200]  they began to see
[02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:47.200]  homosexual behavior and transgenderism and
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:49.200]  pedophilia in the mice.
[02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:51.200]  So you would have adult males
[02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:53.200]  planting young mice.
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:55.200]  You would have female mice taking on the roles
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:57.200]  of male mice.
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:36:59.200]  And then at one point you had females
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:01.200]  losing all interest in reproduction
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:03.200]  whatsoever, which is
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:05.200]  some of what we're seeing in societies today
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:07.200]  for example in Japan.
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:09.200]  There's not a lot of couples having babies
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:11.200]  in Japan
[02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:13.200]  not comparing them to mice. I'm just saying
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:15.200]  that this is a universal process
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:17.200]  of many, many different
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:19.200]  biological systems.
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:21.200]  Right now today
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:23.200]  we are in the final stage before
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:25.200]  collapse of human society
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:27.200]  or we're in the collapse, the beginning
[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:29.200]  stages of it, and the things that we're seeing
[02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:31.200]  in terms of transgenderism
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:33.200]  the pedophilia
[02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:35.200]  and grooming operations, these have
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:37.200]  been seen before in the
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:39.200]  Calhoun experiments. And importantly
[02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:41.200]  Alex, what it shows is that
[02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:43.200]  if you give people
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:45.200]  unlimited food, unlimited money
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:47.200]  money printing, stimulus checks, universal
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:49.200]  basic income, you don't
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:51.200]  help them. You create a
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:53.200]  welfare state that causes the loss
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:55.200]  of skills and knowledge
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:57.200]  that's normally transferred from one generation
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:37:59.200]  to the next. And you end up with new
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:01.200]  generations of mice in this
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:03.200]  case or humans in our case
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:05.200]  who don't know how to navigate reality
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:07.200]  and cannot function in the real world
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:09.200]  and then they lose all interest in reproduction
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:11.200]  the family is gone, yes mice
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:13.200]  have families too, the family gets destroyed
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:15.200]  and within a few more generations
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:17.200]  it's population zero. Total
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:19.200]  collapse even though they had everything available
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:21.200]  to them including plenty of nesting
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:23.200]  space. So they didn't run out of space Alex
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:25.200]  they didn't run out of anything. Their
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:27.200]  culture collapsed because of a lack
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:29.200]  of knowledge transference.
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:31.200]  That's what happened and that's what's happening today
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:33.200]  when we send our children to colleges
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:35.200]  and universities they don't learn things
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:37.200]  in many of these locations. They get indoctrinated
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:39.200]  and then they engage in
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:41.200]  you know LGBT propaganda
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:43.200]  child mutilations. We have
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:45.200]  infanticide and abortions and all of those
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:47.200]  things were seen also in the mouse
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:49.200]  populations in the Calhoun experiments.
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:51.200]  So that's kind of the nutshell
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:53.200]  Alex of what this shows
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:55.200]  but it was misinterpreted by mainstream
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:57.200]  scientists who said oh population is the problem
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:38:59.200]  population is not the problem.
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:01.200]  The problem is lack
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:03.200]  of knowledge and too much free stuff
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:05.200]  for everybody. Well of course they knew that. I mean this was done by
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:07.200]  Globalist Genesist. The input was
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:09.200]  giving them everything free, compact
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:11.200]  and then now they're trying to artificially take everything in the
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:13.200]  study and prime
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:15.200]  the pump with this study with the
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:17.200]  transgenderism and the drugs and the free food
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:19.200]  and all this to basically
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:21.200]  accelerate this model in their own words.
[02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:23.200]  They're trying to hasten the collapse.
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:25.200]  Well that's right.
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:27.200]  So part of the attack on the family
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:29.200]  is pushing these
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:31.200]  behaviors that they observed in the mice.
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:33.200]  They can push them more aggressively
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:35.200]  through transgenderism and LGBT propaganda
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:37.200]  and they can break apart families
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:39.200]  and they can make mothers not care about their
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:41.200]  young. So what Calhoun was
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:43.200]  reporting is that some of the
[02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:45.200]  mice mothers they would be carrying one of their
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:47.200]  young and they would accidentally drop
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:49.200]  the young mouse and they wouldn't even
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:51.200]  bother to pick it up. They would just keep going
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:53.200]  and that young mouse would die
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:55.200]  because there was no caring for the children.
[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:57.200]  Well what do you see today?
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:39:59.200]  Abortions, infanticide.
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:01.200]  People throwing their children at the state
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:03.200]  and saying you raised them. They're your children now.
[02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:05.200]  Look at China where they don't take care of people
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:07.200]  that are in a car wreck and the Chinese
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:09.200]  that do care. They're trying to beat it out of them
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:11.200]  not to care.
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:13.200]  Yeah exactly. So instead of
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:15.200]  scientists learning from this experiment
[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:17.200]  of how to not have things go
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:19.200]  they use it as a weaponization
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:21.200]  to figure out what they should
[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:23.200]  do. What they want to do
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:25.200]  in their globalist depopulation
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:27.200]  efforts. So again
[02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:29.200]  they ran the experiments to find how they can
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:31.200]  weaponize it against humanity. I believe.
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:33.200]  And then now here we are
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:35.200]  we are living in the
[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:37.200]  so-called mouse utopia right now
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:39.200]  and that's what they call the mouse utopia
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:41.200]  everything for free everything provided
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:43.200]  and yet total collapse population
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:45.200]  zero. There were no survivors
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:47.200]  in that scenario Alex because they
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:49.200]  lost the skills. But you know what the upshot is
[02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:51.200]  as long as you maintain skills
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:53.200]  and you teach your children and you homeschool
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:55.200]  your children and you teach them how to do
[02:40:55.200 --> 02:40:57.200]  real things in the real world you
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:40:59.200]  won't reach population zero.
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:01.200]  That's right Elon Musk. So Elon Musk
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:03.200]  wants us to
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:05.200]  have universal basic income
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:07.200]  that's the holy grail of the globalist. They
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:09.200]  know exactly what that'll do go to any of these parks
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:11.200]  in the US Japan anywhere where they feed
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:13.200]  the birds they feed the squirrels in Japan
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:15.200]  they feed the monkeys. The monkeys become
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:17.200]  obese lazy and hateful
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:19.200]  as well and do things they never did before.
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:21.200]  Yeah that's right
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:23.200]  in fact it is free market competition
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:25.200]  that is critical to the survival
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:27.200]  of the human species and it's
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:29.200]  also socialization skills
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:31.200]  which were taken away from generation
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:33.200]  of children due to the COVID lockdowns
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:35.200]  and the masks and the isolation that we
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:37.200]  just saw over the last two years. They are
[02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:39.200]  in fact implementing the socialization
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:41.200]  destruction that was witnessed in the Calhoun
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:43.200]  mouse experiments. They're implementing that in the schools
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:45.200]  even in places like California
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:47.200]  continuing to this day
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:49.200]  masks are still required in many places.
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:51.200]  So that is the socialization destruction
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:53.200]  and when you destroy socialization
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:55.200]  you destroy the ability of
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:41:57.200]  a new generation to be able
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:41:59.200]  to reproduce and to have families to choose
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:01.200]  mates and to have healthy offspring and to teach
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:03.200]  those offspring the skills of survival.
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:05.200]  And what's crazy is the average leftist goes
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:07.200]  along with this but even mid-level leftists
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:09.200]  now know they're bringing down society
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:11.200]  they believe to build this utopia but they've been set
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:13.200]  up by eugenicists that I would even call
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:15.200]  liberal or leftist but are
[02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:17.200]  beyond hitlerian who are setting them up
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:19.200]  for this process and so they're literally victims
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:21.200]  of this brainwashing but they still
[02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:23.200]  love the servitude they've been
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:25.200]  put into. Yeah
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:27.200]  yeah exactly and you and I would be like
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:29.200]  the mice in the simulation
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:31.200]  screaming to the other mice
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:33.200]  hey teach your children protect your children
[02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:35.200]  maintain your fertility don't take the jab
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:37.200]  learn where food comes from
[02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:39.200]  right this is what the mice if they had known
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:41.200]  let's break out of this enclosure we're in
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:43.200]  there's a bigger world outside this you know
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:45.200]  yeah absolutely
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:47.200]  yeah climb this jump out
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:49.200]  let's free the other mice you know get out of the matrix
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:51.200]  that's what we would have been doing
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:53.200]  amazing. Stay there
[02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:57.200]  let's talk more about this when you come back
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:42:59.200]  December 2022
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:01.200]  is here and we are
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:03.200]  proud and very excited to announce
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:05.200]  that free shipping is back
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:07.200]  at infowarstore.com
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:09.200]  that's right free shipping on all orders
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:11.200]  of $50 or more but
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:13.200]  we've signed a new deal with a
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:15.200]  big national shipping company
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:17.200]  and they're able to cut our regular
[02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:19.200]  shipping cost by up to 50%
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:21.200]  so that means even on
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:23.200]  orders that are below $50
[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:25.200]  you're going to be paying way lower than you were
[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:27.200]  previously this is a game changer
[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:29.200]  we're so excited about it
[02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:31.200]  our listeners have really asked for free shipping again
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:33.200]  we couldn't afford it before
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:35.200]  but by moving to a bigger national distributor
[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:37.200]  we're able to do it so now your orders
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:39.200]  will be shipped even faster
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:41.200]  the same great customer service and more

[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:49.200]  right now I want to thank you all for your support
[02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:51.200]  but now there's no excuse

[02:43:55.200 --> 02:44:24.200]  at infowarstore.com
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:27.200]  we are having now the greatest victories
[02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:29.200]  in the fight against the new order
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:31.200]  we've ever had
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:33.200]  we are now entering the final mile
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:35.200]  of the marathon
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:37.200]  and that's why today it's more important
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:39.200]  than ever to realize how important
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:41.200]  you've been in this fight and to continue
[02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:43.200]  in the efforts you've been carrying out
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:45.200]  and to intensify them
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:47.200]  I bless you all, I salute you, I thank you
[02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:49.200]  and I beg you to intensify
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:51.200]  what you're doing now because we are
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:53.200]  over the target and this street is happening
[02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:55.200]  the fight is my fight, it's your fight

[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:01.200]  Americans have lost trust
[02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:03.200]  in their doctors and the health care system
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:05.200]  there's a solution

[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:37.200]  acute and post-COVID syndromes
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:39.200]  vaccine injury syndromes
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:41.200]  and the array of things that now
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:43.200]  America has to work through
[02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:45.200]  in this new

[02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:57.200]  to better health
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:45:59.200]  until about 150 years ago
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:01.200]  cultures all over the world
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:03.200]  believe that
[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:05.200]  people got sick and died
[02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:07.200]  in many cases in the winter
[02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:09.200]  because of something called vapors
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:11.200]  they associated these
[02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:13.200]  poisonous vapors with cold
[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:15.200]  weather of course it wasn't the cold
[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:17.200]  weather or catching a chill
[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:19.200]  that killed people what was killing
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:21.200]  people was a lack of vitamin
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:23.200]  D3 you see
[02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:25.200]  the sun via your skin
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:27.200]  helps your body produce
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:29.200]  vitamin D3 but if you're not
[02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:31.200]  getting enough sun you will not produce
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:33.200]  vitamin D3 and then it's very easy
[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:35.200]  for viruses and other things to start replicating
[02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:37.200]  and taking your body over

[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:23.200]  we're going a little bit in the next hour
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:25.200]  national international news to them
[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:27.200]  in a moment I want to finish up with the social engineers
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:29.200]  we read their books we read their
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:31.200]  papers we all know this is real
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:33.200]  we're telling them what's coming next they see it happen
[02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:35.200]  because the globalists are predominantly
[02:47:35.200 --> 02:47:37.200]  in control of the world they're not in full control
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:39.200]  and we say no no comply
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:41.200]  they can't win
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:43.200]  and if we all start trying to become more
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:45.200]  self-sufficient and educate others
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:47.200]  they will fail and they admit their own white papers
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:49.200]  they are failing more oppositions come in
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:51.200]  but they keep doubling down what elite
[02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:53.200]  people are doing
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:55.200]  because aristocrats of all weren't perfect
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:57.200]  there were different groups some were good
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:59.200]  but understood build up humanity build libraries
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:01.200]  maybe we'll be healthier give people style
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:03.200]  give people class develop culture
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:05.200]  develop jobs develop a worth ethic
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:07.200]  that's a better world for the elites
[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:09.200]  kids who live in as well with our children
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:11.200]  and in competition
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:13.200]  that's what America was about wasn't perfect
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:15.200]  imagine trying to come in and get rid of all that
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:17.200]  so you can manage people better
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:19.200]  so no new opposition forms to you
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:21.200]  you accelerate the bad tendencies of collapse
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:23.200]  and then are delusional
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:25.200]  with Yovall Noah Harari
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:27.200]  a totally creepy dude
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:29.200]  of medieval studies
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:31.200]  as the high priest saying he's going to be a god
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:33.200]  and Ray Kurzweil says that
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:35.200]  they're going to merge with machines
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:37.200]  and they're going to get rid of all of us
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:39.200]  in the process of imploding things
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:41.200]  they get rid of their own due process
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:43.200]  their own chivalry their own protections
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:45.200]  their own safety net and they're going to turn loose men
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:47.200]  and people way more
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:49.200]  evil and corrupt than they are
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:51.200]  and also others who have their backs against the walls
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:53.200]  that will just remove these people like a joke
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:55.200]  so they vestigially
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:57.200]  hang on to the old vestiges
[02:48:57.200 --> 02:48:59.200]  of the free republic and free nations
[02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:01.200]  and are protected by those very
[02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:03.200]  bulwarks that they themselves are
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:05.200]  removing believing it's about to give them
[02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:07.200]  incredible power these people are the biggest morons
[02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:09.200]  of all
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:11.200]  and of course they have a god complex
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:13.200]  but they believe that they're going to
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:15.200]  put in place the end of the era of
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:17.200]  biology as vessels for consciousness
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:19.200]  this is really critical to understand
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:21.200]  they believe for whatever reason yes they're
[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:23.200]  totally insane they're criminally insane
[02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:25.200]  but they believe they can transfer consciousness from
[02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:27.200]  the human body into a machine
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:29.200]  and the reason they believe that is because none
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:31.200]  of them believe in god so they don't understand
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:33.200]  that consciousness is an expression of the creator
[02:49:33.200 --> 02:49:35.200]  and that consciousness is not
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:37.200]  just whatever's sitting in your brain
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:39.200]  it's not just bites
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:41.200]  bits and bites that can be read and digitized and so on
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:43.200]  and by the way when Elon Musk
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:45.200]  says things like oh we're going to be
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:47.200]  able to implant your brain with a neural link
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:49.200]  and we're going to be able to read your memories
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:51.200]  and digitize and archive your memories
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:53.200]  or your dreams I think
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:55.200]  Elon is wrong about that you're not going to be
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:57.200]  able to read memories because memories
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:49:59.200]  are an expression of the holographic
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:01.200]  nature of how
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:03.200]  neurology interfaces with non-material
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:05.200]  consciousness non-physical
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:07.200]  consciousness in other words who you really
[02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:09.200]  are is a non-physical non-material
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:11.200]  being that
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:13.200]  is attached to your brain
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:15.200]  and your body and your physiology but that
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:17.200]  is not you the physical stuff isn't
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:19.200]  you and as a result
[02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:21.200]  scientists will never be able to locate
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:23.200]  like where is consciousness where
[02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:25.200]  did it come from is it this part of the brain
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:27.200]  is it that part of the brain no it's not in the
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:29.200]  brain it transcends the brain
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:31.200]  because again consciousness is a gift
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:33.200]  from god and by the way
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:35.200]  philosophically that's why we must have
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:37.200]  free speech and individual
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:39.200]  freedom because god
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:41.200]  gave us the gift of life and the gift
[02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:43.200]  to choose
[02:50:43.200 --> 02:50:45.200]  and let's expand on that
[02:50:45.200 --> 02:50:47.200]  all the science all the real numbers all the quantum
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:49.200]  mechanics coming out proves
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:51.200]  that and more and more the globalists even admit
[02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:53.200]  they know that's true they're selling
[02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:55.200]  the pop culture that oh grandma didn't really die
[02:50:55.200 --> 02:50:57.200]  she's uploaded this hologram
[02:50:57.200 --> 02:50:59.200]  and you get to talk to her yeah it's her voice print
[02:50:59.200 --> 02:51:01.200]  yeah it sounds like her yeah
[02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:03.200]  it has her sayings yeah it has a whole
[02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:05.200]  AI thing that can fool you but it's like
[02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:07.200]  having a photo of a bingo tiger
[02:51:07.200 --> 02:51:09.200]  versus actually having the bingo tiger and under their
[02:51:09.200 --> 02:51:11.200]  whole transhumanist system I predicted this
[02:51:11.200 --> 02:51:13.200]  20 years ago but now they're saying it'll
[02:51:13.200 --> 02:51:15.200]  be against the law to claim one of these holograms
[02:51:15.200 --> 02:51:17.200]  isn't really a person and then
[02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:19.200]  they'll claim they have voting rights and everything else
[02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:21.200]  so this is the ultimate fraud of the next level
[02:51:21.200 --> 02:51:23.200]  so we'll accept the fraud of two men having
[02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:25.200]  a baby well we'll accept that oh where's
[02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:27.200]  grandpa or where's dad oh he's here with us
[02:51:27.200 --> 02:51:29.200]  he's in you know let's have him at the kitchen table with
[02:51:29.200 --> 02:51:31.200]  us and or maybe we put him into a new body
[02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:33.200]  or whatever but it's really not grandpa
[02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:35.200]  and if you think about it the mRNA
[02:51:35.200 --> 02:51:37.200]  injections are really a digital
[02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:39.200]  instruction set to dismantle the
[02:51:39.200 --> 02:51:41.200]  biological systems that currently
[02:51:41.200 --> 02:51:43.200]  maintain consciousness so
[02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:45.200]  this is a cyber attack
[02:51:45.200 --> 02:51:47.200]  on the human body
[02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:49.200]  human culture the human mind and the human spirit
[02:51:49.200 --> 02:51:51.200]  now this this attack
[02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:53.200]  is from the globalist point of view it's
[02:51:53.200 --> 02:51:55.200]  succeeding in in those who keep taking
[02:51:55.200 --> 02:51:57.200]  the jabs but it is not succeeding
[02:51:57.200 --> 02:51:59.200]  overall which is you know
[02:51:59.200 --> 02:52:01.200]  because so many people are saying no to the vaccines
[02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:03.200]  and thank god for senator Rand Paul and others
[02:52:03.200 --> 02:52:05.200]  who are rejecting this and working to protect
[02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:07.200]  our military troops so
[02:52:07.200 --> 02:52:09.200]  globally then this is why and you know
[02:52:09.200 --> 02:52:11.200]  you've reported on this so many times but this
[02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:13.200]  is why they're accelerating the 2030
[02:52:13.200 --> 02:52:15.200]  and the 2050 agendas because the vaccines
[02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:17.200]  did not succeed at the level
[02:52:17.200 --> 02:52:19.200]  that they had wanted so now they
[02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:21.200]  have to just starve people with brutality
[02:52:21.200 --> 02:52:23.200]  now they have to
[02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:25.200]  you know release cyber warfare
[02:52:25.200 --> 02:52:27.200]  attacks on the power grid now they have to collapse
[02:52:27.200 --> 02:52:29.200]  the money supply all these things are going to happen
[02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:31.200]  but it's because they did not achieve
[02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:33.200]  the death that they wanted from
[02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:35.200]  the mRNA injection themselves
[02:52:35.200 --> 02:52:37.200]  absolutely so they're going back to old fashioned cut off the power
[02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:39.200]  like how was Putin trying to beat the Ukrainians
[02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:41.200]  keeping their power off what's biden doing to us
[02:52:41.200 --> 02:52:43.200]  turning our power off turning down
[02:52:43.200 --> 02:52:45.200]  all of our energy systems here's
[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:47.200]  Tucker Carlson last night
[02:52:47.200 --> 02:52:49.200]  they're now seeing six boosters now
[02:52:49.200 --> 02:52:51.200]  how did you and I know two and a half years
[02:52:51.200 --> 02:52:53.200]  ago it'd be six to eight shots a year
[02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:55.200]  because Bill Gates actually said to his investors
[02:52:55.200 --> 02:52:57.200]  they knew day one it would erase your immune system
[02:52:57.200 --> 02:52:59.200]  we've played the Pfizer executives
[02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:01.200]  we played the doctors on here
[02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:03.200]  so it's not like we have crystal balls folks
[02:53:03.200 --> 02:53:05.200]  that's what's so frustrating they were planning it the whole time
[02:53:05.200 --> 02:53:07.200]  and now two and a half years later here they are
[02:53:07.200 --> 02:53:09.200]  it didn't matter whether you're in Australia
[02:53:09.200 --> 02:53:11.200]  or Germany or America it's the same lie
[02:53:11.200 --> 02:53:13.200]  now you've got to have six shots here it is
[02:53:17.200 --> 02:53:19.200]  so in order for people
[02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:21.200]  to believe the science
[02:53:21.200 --> 02:53:23.200]  the people explaining the science
[02:53:23.200 --> 02:53:25.200]  have to be honest and consistent otherwise
[02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:27.200]  no one thinks any of it is real
[02:53:27.200 --> 02:53:29.200]  so it's important and with that in mind
[02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:31.200]  the Biden administration has been telling you for quite a while now
[02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:33.200]  that the COVID vaccine protects you for a full year
[02:53:35.200 --> 02:53:37.200]  well that's not true the vaccine does not
[02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:39.200]  unfortunately stop you from getting COVID
[02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:41.200]  the majority of people who've died recently from COVID
[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:43.200]  have been vaccinated but they're still
[02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:45.200]  telling you to take it every year but then suddenly
[02:53:45.200 --> 02:53:47.200]  with no explanation that recommendation has changed
[02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:49.200]  the HHS secretary Javier Becerra
[02:53:49.200 --> 02:53:51.200]  just made this announcement
[02:53:51.200 --> 02:53:53.200]  if it's been over two months
[02:53:53.200 --> 02:53:55.200]  since your last dose make a plan
[02:53:55.200 --> 02:53:57.200]  to get one now
[02:53:57.200 --> 02:53:59.200]  in other words you need to get a new
[02:53:59.200 --> 02:54:01.200]  COVID shot every two months
[02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:03.200]  six times a year
[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:05.200]  huh? who thinks that's a good idea
[02:54:05.200 --> 02:54:07.200]  well Bill Clinton
[02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:09.200]  he just tested positive for COVID but despite that
[02:54:09.200 --> 02:54:11.200]  he said he's quote grateful to be vaccinated
[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:13.200]  and boosted
[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:15.200]  because he'll say anything
[02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:17.200]  as you know
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:19.200]  I can't go to Google because they're totally rigged now
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:21.200]  being somewhat rigged you've got to go a few others
[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:23.200]  are a little bit better but if you go search
[02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:25.200]  2020
[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:27.200]  you'll find Mike Adams and Alex Jones saying
[02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:29.200]  they're going to be giving you six to ten shots a year
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:31.200]  because they said so Mike
[02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:33.200]  it's in the documents elaborate on that
[02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:35.200]  this is such an open fiasco
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:39.200]  well yeah they manipulated the public into this
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:41.200]  but the key is they had to have
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:43.200]  they had to manufacture consent into
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:45.200]  vaccine assisted suicide and multi-generational
[02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:47.200]  infertility
[02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:49.200]  so those who don't die from
[02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:51.200]  the clots or the myocarditis
[02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:53.200]  or the neurological problems
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:55.200]  if they try to have children
[02:54:55.200 --> 02:54:57.200]  the males are affected by drastically
[02:54:57.200 --> 02:54:59.200]  lowered sperm production
[02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:01.200]  it's down 62% over the last few years
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:03.200]  or since it was a few years ago
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:05.200]  62% it's almost two thirds reduction
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:07.200]  in sperm and in addition
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:09.200]  the spike protein circulates
[02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:11.200]  into the ovaries and female reproductive organs
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:13.200]  so remember
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:15.200]  that when a woman is pregnant with
[02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:17.200]  her female child
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:19.200]  that the ovaries that that female
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:21.200]  child will carry for her life are also
[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:23.200]  being formed during the gestation period
[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:25.200]  when
[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:27.200]  when that female child is in her mother's
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:29.200]  womb and so that means that
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:31.200]  what's circulating in the mother's body
[02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:33.200]  affects her daughter and her
[02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:35.200]  granddaughters and they're particularly
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:37.200]  pushing it on pregnant women
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:39.200]  absolutely because they know
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:41.200]  that this will kill
[02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:43.200]  fertility for
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:45.200]  most likely the next generation
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:47.200]  but if you're lucky enough to resist and have a child
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:49.200]  that child won't be fertile
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:51.200]  so remember how Bill Gates
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:53.200]  said that a reducing population
[02:55:53.200 --> 02:55:55.200]  he publicly said
[02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:57.200]  he wants to do it slowly by
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:55:59.200]  women's health initiatives which is
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:01.200]  murdering babies and causing fertility
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:03.200]  and it was Bill Gates also by the way
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:05.200]  that was funding or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:07.200]  funding the ultrasonic
[02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:09.200]  male infertility
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:11.200]  technology this is patented
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:13.200]  it was an ultrasound
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:15.200]  machine that wraps around the man's
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:17.200]  scrotum and blasts the scrotum
[02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:19.200]  with ultrasonic energy causing
[02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:21.200]  infertility loss of sperm production
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:23.200]  for six months that's the kind
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:25.200]  of tech that Bill Gates was funding
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:27.200]  before well they found
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:29.200]  a better tech right
[02:56:29.200 --> 02:56:31.200]  mRNA it goes to the sperm
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:33.200]  I mean it goes to the testes it reduces sperm
[02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:35.200]  it goes to the ovaries it goes to the
[02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:37.200]  spleen the liver the brain the heart
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:39.200]  the organs all throughout the body
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:41.200]  this is what this is their
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:43.200]  utopia the globalist utopia
[02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:45.200]  they finally found a weapon system
[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:47.200]  that's a self replicating
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:49.200]  depopulation and infertility system
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:51.200]  that they can convince people to
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:53.200]  want to take people who are oblivious
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:55.200]  that's the sad part
[02:56:55.200 --> 02:56:57.200]  incredible do 15 more minutes with us
[02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:59.200]  nantralnews.com I want to tie into this new
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:01.200]  incredible announcement of Planned Parenthood
[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:03.200]  that we should sexualize children at birth
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:05.200]  we told you it was coming this is a
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:07.200]  pedophile revolution the pedophiles
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:09.200]  like to rape kids but the globalist
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:11.200]  they like to ruin their fertility and their
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:13.200]  future that's why the Atlantic
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:15.200]  says the people cheering for humanity's
[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:17.200]  end and says we just get rid of all humans
[02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:19.200]  it's so beautiful avatar
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:21.200]  director says testosterone
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:23.200]  should basically be outlawed
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:25.200]  ladies and gentlemen this is a clear
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:27.200]  anti-human agenda they turn
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:29.200]  men against women women against men they're targeting
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:31.200]  it's all black against white it's all
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:33.200]  a lie it's all eugenics

[02:58:49.200 --> 02:58:51.200]  cultures all over the world
[02:58:51.200 --> 02:58:53.200]  believe that people got
[02:58:53.200 --> 02:58:55.200]  sick and died in many cases
[02:58:55.200 --> 02:58:57.200]  in the winter because of something
[02:58:57.200 --> 02:58:59.200]  called vapors
[02:58:59.200 --> 02:59:01.200]  they associated these poisonous
[02:59:01.200 --> 02:59:03.200]  vapors with cold weather
[02:59:03.200 --> 02:59:05.200]  of course it wasn't the cold weather
[02:59:05.200 --> 02:59:07.200]  or catching a chill that killed people
[02:59:07.200 --> 02:59:09.200]  what was killing people
[02:59:09.200 --> 02:59:11.200]  was a lack of vitamin D3
[02:59:11.200 --> 02:59:13.200]  you see the sun
[02:59:13.200 --> 02:59:15.200]  via your skin helps your body
[02:59:15.200 --> 02:59:17.200]  produce vitamin D3
[02:59:17.200 --> 02:59:19.200]  but if you're not getting enough sun
[02:59:19.200 --> 02:59:21.200]  you will not produce vitamin D3
[02:59:21.200 --> 02:59:23.200]  and then it's very easy for viruses
[02:59:23.200 --> 02:59:25.200]  and other things you start replicating
[02:59:25.200 --> 02:59:27.200]  and taking your body over

[03:00:15.200 --> 03:00:17.200]  I want to cover other big news stories
[03:00:17.200 --> 03:00:19.200]  that you're focused on right now
[03:00:19.200 --> 03:00:21.200]  on these next two segments
[03:00:21.200 --> 03:00:23.200]  what else is front and center
[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:25.200]  in natural news
[03:00:25.200 --> 03:00:27.200]  well I think here we're going into the winter
[03:00:27.200 --> 03:00:29.200]  here and we are facing
[03:00:29.200 --> 03:00:31.200]  energy scarcity in the United States
[03:00:31.200 --> 03:00:33.200]  we are facing what it was
[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:35.200]  mainstream reported 25% of the American people
[03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:37.200]  may be facing rolling blackouts
[03:00:37.200 --> 03:00:39.200]  and in Europe those blackouts could extend
[03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:41.200]  for many many days or even weeks
[03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:43.200]  in some cases and I think that
[03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:45.200]  people are not prepared for this
[03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:47.200]  generally speaking but this could be
[03:00:47.200 --> 03:00:49.200]  an important wake up call to let people know
[03:00:49.200 --> 03:00:51.200]  that the infrastructure that's promised to them
[03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:53.200]  is not reliable
[03:00:53.200 --> 03:00:55.200]  so people are losing faith more and more
[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:57.200]  in government they're losing faith in the FDA
[03:00:57.200 --> 03:00:59.200]  the CDC the FBI the DOJ
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:01.200]  when the power grid starts to fail
[03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:03.200]  this is when people are going to really question
[03:01:03.200 --> 03:01:05.200]  why do they have faith in these
[03:01:05.200 --> 03:01:07.200]  systems even more and then when food scarcity
[03:01:07.200 --> 03:01:09.200]  worsens which will happen
[03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:11.200]  throughout 2023 and 24
[03:01:11.200 --> 03:01:13.200]  and people realize there are fewer and fewer choices
[03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:15.200]  in the grocery store and the food
[03:01:15.200 --> 03:01:17.200]  items cost a lot more than they were anticipating
[03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:19.200]  and they don't have enough money to pay
[03:01:19.200 --> 03:01:21.200]  energy and food together
[03:01:21.200 --> 03:01:23.200]  and put food on the table for the families
[03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:25.200]  you're going to have more uprising
[03:01:25.200 --> 03:01:27.200]  potential forming through the population
[03:01:27.200 --> 03:01:29.200]  that's when they're going to hit us
[03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:31.200]  with the next big pandemic
[03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:33.200]  and the WHO treaty
[03:01:33.200 --> 03:01:35.200]  is going to be signed by Joe Biden sometime
[03:01:35.200 --> 03:01:37.200]  in the first half of 2023
[03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:39.200]  once that treaty goes in place and I know
[03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:41.200]  you interviewed Dr. Francis Boyle
[03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:43.200]  about this and many other topics
[03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:45.200]  that treaty has language in it that is designed
[03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:47.200]  to supersede national
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:49.200]  sovereignty as well as state sovereignty
[03:01:49.200 --> 03:01:51.200]  in the United States so a state like Texas
[03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:53.200]  would be subject
[03:01:53.200 --> 03:01:55.200]  according to this language subject to the
[03:01:55.200 --> 03:01:57.200]  WHO's orders
[03:01:57.200 --> 03:01:59.200]  to order your local doctors hospitals
[03:01:59.200 --> 03:02:01.200]  and clinics to lock you down and vaccinate you
[03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:03.200]  on command from the WHO
[03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:05.200]  regardless of what your state wants to do
[03:02:05.200 --> 03:02:07.200]  think about that because that's coming
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:09.200]  that's coming soon
[03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:11.200]  absolutely and my people that doubt this
[03:02:11.200 --> 03:02:13.200]  they always put out this lie the UN is incompetent
[03:02:13.200 --> 03:02:15.200]  it's about the idiots well when they get all the nations
[03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:17.200]  begging for food and help
[03:02:17.200 --> 03:02:19.200]  that's all a joke but the
[03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:21.200]  national security council
[03:02:21.200 --> 03:02:23.200]  international security council
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:25.200]  the UN security council
[03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:27.200]  plugging into the central banks are all on record
[03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:29.200]  that they're in control and we have the head of the UN
[03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:31.200]  information bureau a month ago
[03:02:31.200 --> 03:02:33.200]  telling the national television telling Ted talk
[03:02:33.200 --> 03:02:35.200]  oh we tell big tech what to do
[03:02:35.200 --> 03:02:37.200]  and they do but the corporations
[03:02:37.200 --> 03:02:39.200]  tell them what to do and then we go under
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:41.200]  you in control because it's unelected
[03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:43.200]  just like the EU was never elected
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:45.200]  they have a parliament that's elected but it's
[03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:47.200]  ceremonial advisory so we
[03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:49.200]  are well down the road here
[03:02:49.200 --> 03:02:51.200]  of being under you in control
[03:02:51.200 --> 03:02:53.200]  yeah I think about how easy it's going to be for them
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:55.200]  to push people into the central bank
[03:02:55.200 --> 03:02:57.200]  digital currency system when they
[03:02:57.200 --> 03:02:59.200]  engineer food scarcity and then they collapse
[03:02:59.200 --> 03:03:01.200]  the fiat currency debt based system
[03:03:01.200 --> 03:03:03.200]  people will beg
[03:03:03.200 --> 03:03:05.200]  they will beg
[03:03:05.200 --> 03:03:07.200]  what I've said is that your slavers
[03:03:07.200 --> 03:03:09.200]  that's the globalist who want to enslave you
[03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:11.200]  your slavers will pose as your saviors
[03:03:11.200 --> 03:03:13.200]  they will say oh we're your gods
[03:03:13.200 --> 03:03:15.200]  we're your solution to come to us
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:17.200]  we'll give you free money you just have to
[03:03:17.200 --> 03:03:19.200]  have your thumb print and your iris scan
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:21.200]  and your DNA scan and join the market to be system
[03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:23.200]  but people who don't know
[03:03:23.200 --> 03:03:25.200]  what's happening they will
[03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:27.200]  thank their slavers for
[03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:29.200]  enslaving them and annihilating them
[03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:31.200]  they will thank them for it
[03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:33.200]  and one of the things that concerns me
[03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:35.200]  is that I know people who are very close
[03:03:35.200 --> 03:03:37.200]  to for example Governor Abbott
[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:39.200]  in Texas and the people
[03:03:39.200 --> 03:03:41.200]  surrounding Governor Abbott as much
[03:03:41.200 --> 03:03:43.200]  good as he has done
[03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:45.200]  his people are not aware at all
[03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:47.200]  of the genocide
[03:03:47.200 --> 03:03:49.200]  the depopulation efforts the dangers of the vaccine
[03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:51.200]  the food scarcity that's being engineered
[03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:53.200]  and all of this they are not aware
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:55.200]  and they are not prepared and the reason I'm saying this publicly
[03:03:55.200 --> 03:03:57.200]  is not to criticize Governor Abbott because
[03:03:57.200 --> 03:03:59.200]  again he's done a lot of great things but just to say
[03:03:59.200 --> 03:04:01.200]  you need to get up to speed on what's happening here
[03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:03.200]  because Texas is going to
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:05.200]  have to defend for itself
[03:04:05.200 --> 03:04:07.200]  when the world is trying to bring down humanity
[03:04:07.200 --> 03:04:09.200]  and Joe Biden has signed on to that
[03:04:09.200 --> 03:04:11.200]  world treaty it's going to be individual states
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:13.200]  that are the sanctuaries
[03:04:13.200 --> 03:04:15.200]  for human life
[03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:17.200]  that's right like I've got a few other big
[03:04:17.200 --> 03:04:19.200]  issues I want to hit with you when we come back
[03:04:19.200 --> 03:04:21.200]  I'm going to cover the waterfront
[03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:23.200]  but wildcard what else do you want me to come back
[03:04:25.200 --> 03:04:27.200]  well I can go anywhere you want
[03:04:27.200 --> 03:04:29.200]  but I think the financial collapse
[03:04:29.200 --> 03:04:31.200]  is the big issue that we all need to be facing
[03:04:31.200 --> 03:04:33.200]  and even we don't take it seriously enough
[03:04:33.200 --> 03:04:35.200]  Alex you and I
[03:04:35.200 --> 03:04:37.200]  I was going to ask you about FTX and all the incredible things
[03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:39.200]  there and when we come back
[03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:41.200]  that's what I was going to head first with Mike Adams
[03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:43.200]  from InfoWars.com
[03:04:43.200 --> 03:04:45.200]  and Band-Aid Video remember the way we change the world

[03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:49.200]  part of this operation the viewers and
[03:04:49.200 --> 03:04:51.200]  listeners so don't forget that
[03:04:51.200 --> 03:04:53.200]  share the live feed infowars.com
[03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:57.200]  on your email today
[03:04:57.200 --> 03:04:59.200]  once a tragedy reaches a level
[03:04:59.200 --> 03:05:01.200]  of national significance
[03:05:01.200 --> 03:05:03.200]  American citizens
[03:05:03.200 --> 03:05:05.200]  should be allowed to basically
[03:05:05.200 --> 03:05:07.200]  question that event in any way
[03:05:07.200 --> 03:05:09.200]  that they deem fit
[03:05:09.200 --> 03:05:11.200]  the first amendment is unique in the world
[03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:13.200]  that's what they want to take away your ability to speak freely
[03:05:13.200 --> 03:05:15.200]  so they're going to go for Mike Lindell next
[03:05:15.200 --> 03:05:17.200]  or they're going to go for Steve Bannon
[03:05:17.200 --> 03:05:19.200]  or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson
[03:05:19.200 --> 03:05:21.200]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago but only 28 years
[03:05:21.200 --> 03:05:23.200]  and I knew they were planning all of this
[03:05:23.200 --> 03:05:25.200]  and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere
[03:05:25.200 --> 03:05:27.200]  but I couldn't have done it without your support
[03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:29.200]  and now because we've been so successful
[03:05:29.200 --> 03:05:31.200]  warning the population of the planet
[03:05:31.200 --> 03:05:33.200]  not just America we're public enemy number one
[03:05:33.200 --> 03:05:35.200]  when it comes to the globalist agenda
[03:05:35.200 --> 03:05:37.200]  that's why it's more important than ever to realize
[03:05:37.200 --> 03:05:39.200]  how successful InfoWars has been
[03:05:39.200 --> 03:05:41.200]  because of your past support

[03:06:11.200 --> 03:06:13.200]  find me guilty until juries to give
[03:06:13.200 --> 03:06:15.200]  millions of dollars to people that sued me
[03:06:15.200 --> 03:06:17.200]  I never even said their names except one person
[03:06:17.200 --> 03:06:19.200]  and they put out these big numbers
[03:06:19.200 --> 03:06:21.200]  making you think we're done
[03:06:21.200 --> 03:06:23.200]  it's over but we still have laws and things to protect us

[03:06:29.200 --> 03:06:31.200]  it's not them it will decide
[03:06:31.200 --> 03:06:33.200]  it's you that will decide
[03:06:33.200 --> 03:06:35.200]  and we got vitamin mineral fusion
[03:06:35.200 --> 03:06:37.200]  bodies a little bit too much for me
[03:06:37.200 --> 03:06:39.200]  the DNA force plus, supermodel vitality
[03:06:39.200 --> 03:06:41.200]  knockout sleep support
[03:06:41.200 --> 03:06:43.200]  dozens of other great products that are close to selling out
[03:06:43.200 --> 03:06:45.200]  despite that up to 60% off the promo code
[03:06:45.200 --> 03:06:47.200]  free shipping is back at infowarsstore.com
[03:06:47.200 --> 03:06:49.200]  so Mike Adams
[03:06:49.200 --> 03:06:51.200]  you've been really one of the best analysts out there
[03:06:51.200 --> 03:06:53.200]  on FTX even before
[03:06:53.200 --> 03:06:55.200]  it collapsed a deep state
[03:06:55.200 --> 03:06:57.200]  we now confirm what you first thought
[03:06:57.200 --> 03:06:59.200]  is they were slush funding
[03:06:59.200 --> 03:07:01.200]  to Ukraine and back a money laundering operation
[03:07:01.200 --> 03:07:03.200]  spending tens of millions
[03:07:03.200 --> 03:07:05.200]  a quarter on paying for fake
[03:07:05.200 --> 03:07:07.200]  media suppressing COVID truth
[03:07:07.200 --> 03:07:09.200]  putting out fake studies
[03:07:09.200 --> 03:07:11.200]  I mean this is really just a puppet of the globalist
[03:07:11.200 --> 03:07:13.200]  and now that's all come out of the New York Times
[03:07:13.200 --> 03:07:15.200]  it's trying to do facelifts
[03:07:15.200 --> 03:07:17.200]  for FTX this little monster
[03:07:17.200 --> 03:07:19.200]  that was just the front man for it
[03:07:19.200 --> 03:07:21.200]  but to me that's a canary in the coal mine
[03:07:21.200 --> 03:07:23.200]  big picture what are the real economic numbers we're seeing right now
[03:07:23.200 --> 03:07:25.200]  well first of all
[03:07:25.200 --> 03:07:27.200]  I want to give credit to those who know a lot more
[03:07:27.200 --> 03:07:29.200]  about this than I do
[03:07:29.200 --> 03:07:31.200]  and they've done a better job at BitBoy
[03:07:31.200 --> 03:07:33.200]  for example was a guest on your platform
[03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:35.200]  BitBoy shout out to him
[03:07:35.200 --> 03:07:37.200]  he's doing amazing work exposing all of this
[03:07:37.200 --> 03:07:39.200]  there's also a guy on
[03:07:39.200 --> 03:07:41.200]  YouTube I don't know him
[03:07:41.200 --> 03:07:43.200]  but his name is Coffee Zilla
[03:07:43.200 --> 03:07:45.200]  and he does a lot of
[03:07:45.200 --> 03:07:47.200]  investigations into crypto and I think he deserves
[03:07:47.200 --> 03:07:49.200]  a lot of credit
[03:07:49.200 --> 03:07:51.200]  you and I both should probably invite him on
[03:07:51.200 --> 03:07:53.200]  to see if he wants to talk about this
[03:07:53.200 --> 03:07:55.200]  I was just telling the producer while you were talking
[03:07:55.200 --> 03:07:57.200]  I was just texting him saying get both these guys on
[03:07:57.200 --> 03:07:59.200]  okay awesome yeah
[03:07:59.200 --> 03:08:01.200]  yeah we gotta bring in more minds on this
[03:08:01.200 --> 03:08:03.200]  right because you and I have big picture stuff
[03:08:03.200 --> 03:08:05.200]  a lot of people have a lot more details on this
[03:08:05.200 --> 03:08:07.200]  but I would say that
[03:08:07.200 --> 03:08:09.200]  you look at Sam Bakeman Freed and how he
[03:08:09.200 --> 03:08:11.200]  continues to be in my opinion
[03:08:11.200 --> 03:08:13.200]  delusional about his role
[03:08:13.200 --> 03:08:15.200]  in vaporizing billions of dollars of other people's money
[03:08:15.200 --> 03:08:17.200]  and the way he talks
[03:08:17.200 --> 03:08:19.200]  and the excuse making that he has to me
[03:08:19.200 --> 03:08:21.200]  it smacks of the kind of talk
[03:08:21.200 --> 03:08:23.200]  of transgenderism
[03:08:23.200 --> 03:08:25.200]  it's this artificial reality
[03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:27.200]  where people think that because they say something
[03:08:27.200 --> 03:08:29.200]  that makes it real and they don't have to pay attention
[03:08:29.200 --> 03:08:31.200]  to accounting or co-mingling funds
[03:08:31.200 --> 03:08:33.200]  or risk aversion strategies
[03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:35.200]  like using stop losses
[03:08:35.200 --> 03:08:37.200]  for example which you know Alameda
[03:08:37.200 --> 03:08:39.200]  in the research famously
[03:08:39.200 --> 03:08:41.200]  the gal there his girlfriend who was running that
[03:08:41.200 --> 03:08:43.200]  was saying oh we don't use stop losses
[03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:45.200]  you know a risk what's risk right
[03:08:45.200 --> 03:08:47.200]  which cause everybody in wall street cause their heads
[03:08:47.200 --> 03:08:49.200]  to explode because if you don't control risk
[03:08:49.200 --> 03:08:51.200]  you're gonna get wiped out just completely
[03:08:51.200 --> 03:08:53.200]  wiped out which is exactly what happened
[03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:55.200]  but he's in my opinion he's making
[03:08:55.200 --> 03:08:57.200]  excuses and still framing himself
[03:08:57.200 --> 03:08:59.200]  as the hero in this
[03:08:59.200 --> 03:09:01.200]  story the guy that I think
[03:09:01.200 --> 03:09:03.200]  should be arrested he should be
[03:09:03.200 --> 03:09:05.200]  imprisoned and he thinks he's the hero
[03:09:05.200 --> 03:09:07.200]  doesn't that remind you Alex of so many
[03:09:07.200 --> 03:09:09.200]  leftists who think that they're saving
[03:09:09.200 --> 03:09:11.200]  the world while they're the worst monsters
[03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:13.200]  on this planet it's the same thing
[03:09:13.200 --> 03:09:15.200]  such delusion
[03:09:15.200 --> 03:09:17.200]  well I'm sure you saw that talk two days ago
[03:09:17.200 --> 03:09:19.200]  but it's on info wars.com
[03:09:19.200 --> 03:09:21.200]  the New York Times had him on and literally
[03:09:21.200 --> 03:09:23.200]  worshiped him and made excuses
[03:09:23.200 --> 03:09:25.200]  I think he's fully conscious of the whole thing
[03:09:25.200 --> 03:09:27.200]  it's his family the connections to Harvard
[03:09:27.200 --> 03:09:29.200]  MIT he's just their front man
[03:09:29.200 --> 03:09:31.200]  this is Bernie Madoff 2.0
[03:09:31.200 --> 03:09:33.200]  yeah and
[03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:35.200]  a whole lot larger than Bernie Madoff
[03:09:35.200 --> 03:09:37.200]  but if we don't start to correct these kinds
[03:09:37.200 --> 03:09:39.200]  of things as a society to say no
[03:09:39.200 --> 03:09:41.200]  wait a second accounting actually matters
[03:09:41.200 --> 03:09:43.200]  right numbers actually matter like for
[03:09:43.200 --> 03:09:45.200]  example Alex if you go
[03:09:45.200 --> 03:09:47.200]  to your bankruptcy
[03:09:47.200 --> 03:09:49.200]  management group and you say things that
[03:09:49.200 --> 03:09:51.200]  Sam bankman freed said like oh
[03:09:51.200 --> 03:09:53.200]  we didn't know about co-mailing funds we didn't know that mattered
[03:09:53.200 --> 03:09:55.200]  money money numbers what numbers
[03:09:55.200 --> 03:09:57.200]  they're gonna they're gonna smack you
[03:09:57.200 --> 03:09:59.200]  for that right you have to be on
[03:09:59.200 --> 03:10:01.200]  top of the numbers so that
[03:10:01.200 --> 03:10:03.200]  you can continue to operate your business
[03:10:03.200 --> 03:10:05.200]  and work out
[03:10:05.200 --> 03:10:07.200]  you know possible solutions with
[03:10:07.200 --> 03:10:09.200]  so-called creditors and so on you have to be on
[03:10:09.200 --> 03:10:11.200]  top of the game you can't give them SBF
[03:10:11.200 --> 03:10:13.200]  kinds of excuses right it would never
[03:10:13.200 --> 03:10:15.200]  let you get away with that in the real world
[03:10:15.200 --> 03:10:17.200]  numbers matter
[03:10:17.200 --> 03:10:19.200]  they're saying they don't know where tens of
[03:10:19.200 --> 03:10:21.200]  billions went and the media is like it's okay
[03:10:21.200 --> 03:10:23.200]  you're a liberal trendy you got
[03:10:23.200 --> 03:10:25.200]  bozo hair you're allowed to
[03:10:25.200 --> 03:10:27.200]  wouldn't it be great if
[03:10:27.200 --> 03:10:29.200]  if accidentally 1.4 billion
[03:10:29.200 --> 03:10:31.200]  found its way over to you
[03:10:31.200 --> 03:10:33.200]  to pay off the
[03:10:33.200 --> 03:10:35.200]  creditors I mean that's a joke I'm just joking
[03:10:35.200 --> 03:10:37.200]  but you know they were playing
[03:10:37.200 --> 03:10:39.200]  around billions of dollars and part of
[03:10:39.200 --> 03:10:41.200]  the process there is that it makes juries
[03:10:41.200 --> 03:10:43.200]  think that billion a billion dollars is
[03:10:43.200 --> 03:10:45.200]  nothing or a trillion is nothing
[03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:47.200]  you know look at dr. Eric Nupudi he's
[03:10:47.200 --> 03:10:49.200]  being sued by I think it's the DOJ
[03:10:49.200 --> 03:10:51.200]  and the FTC for half
[03:10:51.200 --> 03:10:53.200]  a trillion dollars
[03:10:53.200 --> 03:10:55.200]  five hundred billion dollars in fines
[03:10:55.200 --> 03:10:57.200]  because he promoted vitamin D
[03:10:57.200 --> 03:10:59.200]  as a treatment for COVID say that again
[03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:01.200]  that's real news and again
[03:11:01.200 --> 03:11:03.200]  why are the numbers so big it's to scare
[03:11:03.200 --> 03:11:05.200]  everyone folks I don't have a million
[03:11:05.200 --> 03:11:07.200]  dollars much less it means
[03:11:07.200 --> 03:11:09.200]  nothing except to make you give up
[03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:11.200]  don't tell people take vitamin D
[03:11:11.200 --> 03:11:13.200]  even on record it literally stops
[03:11:13.200 --> 03:11:15.200]  the virus will get you for half a trillion
[03:11:15.200 --> 03:11:17.200]  it's all wizard of eyes
[03:11:17.200 --> 03:11:19.200]  trying to slime the great and powerful eyes
[03:11:21.200 --> 03:11:23.200]  yeah that's right and the bizarre
[03:11:23.200 --> 03:11:25.200]  thing is that dr. Nupudi everything
[03:11:25.200 --> 03:11:27.200]  he said about vitamin D has been
[03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:29.200]  confirmed this is too important
[03:11:29.200 --> 03:11:31.200]  start over with the case because I
[03:11:31.200 --> 03:11:33.200]  barely mentioned it two weeks ago it's so huge
[03:11:33.200 --> 03:11:35.200]  it doesn't even sound real it's real
[03:11:35.200 --> 03:11:37.200]  it takes some time on this
[03:11:37.200 --> 03:11:39.200]  well yeah so dr. Nupudi is a chiropractor
[03:11:39.200 --> 03:11:41.200]  in the st. Louis area
[03:11:41.200 --> 03:11:43.200]  and he was
[03:11:43.200 --> 03:11:45.200]  recommending vitamin D which we now know
[03:11:45.200 --> 03:11:47.200]  prevents
[03:11:47.200 --> 03:11:49.200]  all kinds of infections boost the immune
[03:11:49.200 --> 03:11:51.200]  function it's a wonderful nutrient
[03:11:51.200 --> 03:11:53.200]  for people it's been recommended by the late
[03:11:53.200 --> 03:11:55.200]  devs Alenko and Peter McCulloch and so many others
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:11:57.200]  but there was something
[03:11:57.200 --> 03:11:59.200]  in the emergency use
[03:11:59.200 --> 03:12:01.200]  law I forgot the name of it
[03:12:01.200 --> 03:12:03.200]  that there's a sentence in there that this was
[03:12:03.200 --> 03:12:05.200]  signed in
[03:12:05.200 --> 03:12:07.200]  2020 I believe a sentence in there that says
[03:12:07.200 --> 03:12:09.200]  well it's illegal to
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:11.200]  promote something if it's
[03:12:11.200 --> 03:12:13.200]  if it doesn't really treat covid
[03:12:13.200 --> 03:12:15.200]  so when he was recommending vitamin D
[03:12:15.200 --> 03:12:17.200]  then the government came down on him and said
[03:12:17.200 --> 03:12:19.200]  well we're gonna find you
[03:12:19.200 --> 03:12:21.200]  x amount of money for every time you ever mentioned
[03:12:21.200 --> 03:12:23.200]  this on social media and every impression
[03:12:23.200 --> 03:12:25.200]  every exposure and it comes to
[03:12:25.200 --> 03:12:27.200]  $500 billion
[03:12:27.200 --> 03:12:29.200]  half a trillion dollars which is larger
[03:12:29.200 --> 03:12:31.200]  than the GDP
[03:12:31.200 --> 03:12:33.200]  there's thousands of studies that if you have enough vitamin D
[03:12:33.200 --> 03:12:35.200]  viruses cannot replicate
[03:12:35.200 --> 03:12:37.200]  it is almost everybody that had high vitamin D
[03:12:37.200 --> 03:12:39.200]  survived and they literally
[03:12:39.200 --> 03:12:41.200]  I mean it's all
[03:12:41.200 --> 03:12:43.200]  he's selling oxy cotton or shipping fentanyl
[03:12:43.200 --> 03:12:45.200]  and he's saying vitamin D that our damn skin
[03:12:45.200 --> 03:12:47.200]  makes
[03:12:47.200 --> 03:12:49.200]  and vitamin D supplementation reduces hospitalization
[03:12:49.200 --> 03:12:51.200]  and it improves
[03:12:51.200 --> 03:12:53.200]  outcomes of covid patients and that is
[03:12:53.200 --> 03:12:55.200]  those are government published studies
[03:12:55.200 --> 03:12:57.200]  pub med national library of medicine
[03:12:57.200 --> 03:12:59.200]  it is the science the real science
[03:12:59.200 --> 03:13:01.200]  so
[03:13:01.200 --> 03:13:03.200]  they want to suppress him and shut everybody down
[03:13:03.200 --> 03:13:05.200]  and use that as an example
[03:13:05.200 --> 03:13:07.200]  to silence everybody from talking about
[03:13:07.200 --> 03:13:09.200]  vitamin D because of course they can't
[03:13:09.200 --> 03:13:11.200]  they can't ban vitamin D very easily
[03:13:11.200 --> 03:13:13.200]  although they may try but
[03:13:13.200 --> 03:13:15.200]  if you add to that zinc and quercetin
[03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:17.200]  and so many other things that are effective
[03:13:17.200 --> 03:13:19.200]  you know ivermectin for example
[03:13:19.200 --> 03:13:21.200]  you know you covered this a thousand times
[03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:23.200]  so they're just trying to shut it down
[03:13:23.200 --> 03:13:25.200]  but they're using these massive fines now
[03:13:25.200 --> 03:13:27.200]  you know $1.4 billion
[03:13:27.200 --> 03:13:29.200]  to you actually more now
[03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:31.200]  and then half a trillion
[03:13:31.200 --> 03:13:33.200]  to Dr. Nipudi
[03:13:33.200 --> 03:13:35.200]  and who knows what's coming next
[03:13:35.200 --> 03:13:37.200]  maybe it'll be a gazillion dollars for somebody
[03:13:37.200 --> 03:13:39.200]  oh you said that you're born
[03:13:39.200 --> 03:13:41.200]  with an immune system you have to pay
[03:13:41.200 --> 03:13:43.200]  a gazillion dollar fine
[03:13:43.200 --> 03:13:45.200]  and it's just it's absurd
[03:13:45.200 --> 03:13:47.200]  you know it's
[03:13:47.200 --> 03:13:49.200]  i don't know what they expect people to do
[03:13:49.200 --> 03:13:51.200]  with these kinds of fines
[03:13:51.200 --> 03:13:53.200]  that money doesn't exist in the world
[03:13:53.200 --> 03:13:55.200]  for most nations of the world
[03:13:55.200 --> 03:13:57.200]  i should i should clarify
[03:13:57.200 --> 03:13:59.200]  so you can't come up with this kind of money
[03:13:59.200 --> 03:14:01.200]  to even pay these fines and the fines are ridiculous in the first place
[03:14:01.200 --> 03:14:03.200]  so well i mean here's pub med
[03:14:03.200 --> 03:14:05.200]  here's pub med
[03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:07.200]  vitamin D deficiency is associated with COVID-19
[03:14:07.200 --> 03:14:09.200]  positivity and severity of the disease
[03:14:09.200 --> 03:14:11.200]  and i've got john hopkins reports
[03:14:11.200 --> 03:14:13.200]  i've got oxford reports
[03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:15.200]  jfact
[03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:17.200]  it is a fact but they don't want people to know that
[03:14:17.200 --> 03:14:19.200]  yeah yeah exactly right
[03:14:19.200 --> 03:14:21.200]  and of course it's a suppression of knowledge that helps humanity
[03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:23.200]  so if you think about
[03:14:23.200 --> 03:14:25.200]  the overall theme of what you and i do
[03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:27.200]  and your guests and
[03:14:27.200 --> 03:14:29.200]  you know j dire you have coming up he's brilliant
[03:14:29.200 --> 03:14:31.200]  he knows so much i love his work
[03:14:31.200 --> 03:14:33.200]  but we are trying to
[03:14:33.200 --> 03:14:35.200]  give humanity solutions to survive
[03:14:35.200 --> 03:14:37.200]  and thrive have healthy children
[03:14:37.200 --> 03:14:39.200]  teach our children and
[03:14:39.200 --> 03:14:41.200]  build a society
[03:14:41.200 --> 03:14:43.200]  together the average leftist has been shown in studies
[03:14:43.200 --> 03:14:45.200]  to be like nine times her life as a steal
[03:14:45.200 --> 03:14:47.200]  and not care but
[03:14:47.200 --> 03:14:49.200]  don't they get when you screw everyone
[03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:51.200]  you get screwed too
[03:14:51.200 --> 03:14:53.200]  they go why do you want to help people
[03:14:53.200 --> 03:14:55.200]  because it's going to affect me you morons
[03:14:55.200 --> 03:14:57.200]  yeah yeah exactly and by the way
[03:14:57.200 --> 03:14:59.200]  wealth means nothing in a world
[03:14:59.200 --> 03:15:01.200]  that is enslaved
[03:15:01.200 --> 03:15:03.200]  if you're one wealthy person in a city of a million
[03:15:03.200 --> 03:15:05.200]  impoverished desperate masses
[03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:07.200]  your wealth doesn't mean anything
[03:15:07.200 --> 03:15:09.200]  you don't want to walk out the door of a mansion
[03:15:09.200 --> 03:15:11.200]  in a city of desperate
[03:15:11.200 --> 03:15:13.200]  well that's what Henry Ford did
[03:15:13.200 --> 03:15:15.200]  he was the first kind of trouble people was paying
[03:15:15.200 --> 03:15:17.200]  he said how are we going to sell all these cars
[03:15:17.200 --> 03:15:19.200]  if they don't have money to buy the damn thing
[03:15:19.200 --> 03:15:21.200]  my cat has great points naturalnews.com

[03:20:25.200 --> 03:20:27.200]  thought about doing a takeoff
[03:20:27.200 --> 03:20:29.200]  on yesterday's event
[03:20:29.200 --> 03:20:31.200]  i was going to wear a panty hose over my head
[03:20:31.200 --> 03:20:33.200]  but i decided against it
[03:20:33.200 --> 03:20:35.200]  i started thinking about raising arizona
[03:20:35.200 --> 03:20:37.200]  where he said son you got a panty on your head
[03:20:37.200 --> 03:20:39.200]  today i'm just going to bring the straight facts
[03:20:39.200 --> 03:20:41.200]  we're going to be spitting facts with one of my favorite researchers
[03:20:41.200 --> 03:20:43.200]  one of my favorite historians
[03:20:43.200 --> 03:20:45.200]  richard grove of tragedy and hope
[03:20:45.200 --> 03:20:47.200]  he is a whistleblower since 2003
[03:20:47.200 --> 03:20:49.200]  media producer documentary filmmaker
[03:20:49.200 --> 03:20:51.200]  since 2006 forensic historian

[03:20:53.200 --> 03:20:55.200]  and lifelong
[03:20:55.200 --> 03:20:57.200]  learner
[03:20:57.200 --> 03:20:59.200]  richard grove of tragedy and hope we work together
[03:20:59.200 --> 03:21:01.200]  now producing a philosophy course
[03:21:01.200 --> 03:21:03.200]  that will be available i think in
[03:21:03.200 --> 03:21:05.200]  december or january
[03:21:05.200 --> 03:21:07.200]  and i want to talk about the
[03:21:07.200 --> 03:21:09.200]  managed dialectics that's out there
[03:21:09.200 --> 03:21:11.200]  and i just did a podcast
[03:21:11.200 --> 03:21:13.200]  the other night with dr james lindsay
[03:21:13.200 --> 03:21:15.200]  and a high powered pentagon
[03:21:15.200 --> 03:21:17.200]  consultant steven kauflin
[03:21:17.200 --> 03:21:19.200]  and we went deep into
[03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:21.200]  how managed dialectics is a
[03:21:21.200 --> 03:21:23.200]  strategy of warfare a strategy
[03:21:23.200 --> 03:21:25.200]  of control now i know everybody
[03:21:25.200 --> 03:21:27.200]  has probably heard of that well yeah we know
[03:21:27.200 --> 03:21:29.200]  the two-party system and all this kind of stuff
[03:21:29.200 --> 03:21:31.200]  but we need to understand that it's an
[03:21:31.200 --> 03:21:33.200]  actual a technology
[03:21:33.200 --> 03:21:35.200]  it's an actual strategy
[03:21:35.200 --> 03:21:37.200]  and it also involves
[03:21:37.200 --> 03:21:39.200]  people who are initiated into
[03:21:39.200 --> 03:21:41.200]  an inner group that run
[03:21:41.200 --> 03:21:43.200]  the world in a certain way and i'm going to give
[03:21:43.200 --> 03:21:45.200]  you a couple examples before we go to richard because
[03:21:45.200 --> 03:21:47.200]  richard knows this material very very well
[03:21:47.200 --> 03:21:49.200]  at the beginning
[03:21:49.200 --> 03:21:51.200]  of brave new world the famous book by
[03:21:51.200 --> 03:21:53.200]  aldis huxley he has
[03:21:53.200 --> 03:21:55.200]  an introductory essay
[03:21:55.200 --> 03:21:57.200]  and in this introductory essay he says i want you to understand
[03:21:57.200 --> 03:21:59.200]  that this novel this fictional presentation
[03:21:59.200 --> 03:22:01.200]  is based on reality
[03:22:01.200 --> 03:22:03.200]  and he mentions at the end
[03:22:03.200 --> 03:22:05.200]  of this that what we're going to
[03:22:05.200 --> 03:22:07.200]  do with eugenics is that
[03:22:07.200 --> 03:22:09.200]  we're going to take this study of
[03:22:09.200 --> 03:22:11.200]  so-called racial science and we're going to
[03:22:11.200 --> 03:22:13.200]  apply it so that we
[03:22:13.200 --> 03:22:15.200]  can bring the population down
[03:22:15.200 --> 03:22:17.200]  and he says that this process
[03:22:17.200 --> 03:22:19.200]  will utilize mass
[03:22:19.200 --> 03:22:21.200]  drugging of the population it will utilize the
[03:22:21.200 --> 03:22:23.200]  enforcement of every odd form
[03:22:23.200 --> 03:22:25.200]  of sexuality not because of anything to do
[03:22:25.200 --> 03:22:27.200]  with freedom and liberty and rights but to reduce
[03:22:27.200 --> 03:22:29.200]  the population simply put
[03:22:29.200 --> 03:22:31.200]  he ends this chapter by saying that what you
[03:22:31.200 --> 03:22:33.200]  read in this fictional book is not
[03:22:33.200 --> 03:22:35.200]  a
[03:22:35.200 --> 03:22:37.200]  made-up story it's actually
[03:22:37.200 --> 03:22:39.200]  order out of chaos
[03:22:39.200 --> 03:22:41.200]  order out of chaos
[03:22:41.200 --> 03:22:43.200]  and then i want you to understand that another famous
[03:22:43.200 --> 03:22:45.200]  person who was not a fiction writer
[03:22:45.200 --> 03:22:47.200]  but was very much a high-level
[03:22:47.200 --> 03:22:49.200]  strategist the big number zensky
[03:22:49.200 --> 03:22:51.200]  he wrote a famous book called strategic
[03:22:51.200 --> 03:22:53.200]  vision before he passed away and it was one of
[03:22:53.200 --> 03:22:55.200]  his last books and he goes into
[03:22:55.200 --> 03:22:57.200]  the very beginning talking about the cold war
[03:22:57.200 --> 03:22:59.200]  and he says if you want to understand
[03:22:59.200 --> 03:23:01.200]  the cold war he says you have to understand
[03:23:01.200 --> 03:23:03.200]  dialectics managed
[03:23:03.200 --> 03:23:05.200]  false either or is false
[03:23:05.200 --> 03:23:07.200]  choices
[03:23:07.200 --> 03:23:09.200]  because the real system
[03:23:09.200 --> 03:23:11.200]  that's going on is outside
[03:23:11.200 --> 03:23:13.200]  of this false choice
[03:23:13.200 --> 03:23:15.200]  and so within 30 pages
[03:23:15.200 --> 03:23:17.200]  he says that the cold war
[03:23:17.200 --> 03:23:19.200]  with the west versus
[03:23:19.200 --> 03:23:21.200]  the marxists in the east not saying it wasn't real
[03:23:21.200 --> 03:23:23.200]  in the sense of a real on the ground disagreement
[03:23:23.200 --> 03:23:25.200]  over ideology he says this is
[03:23:25.200 --> 03:23:27.200]  a higher level game being played
[03:23:27.200 --> 03:23:29.200]  that he says is
[03:23:29.200 --> 03:23:31.200]  mannequian dialectics
[03:23:31.200 --> 03:23:33.200]  now mannequian dialectics is an old
[03:23:33.200 --> 03:23:35.200]  kind of weird esoteric
[03:23:35.200 --> 03:23:37.200]  sect that dealt with dualism
[03:23:37.200 --> 03:23:39.200]  right the whole world
[03:23:39.200 --> 03:23:41.200]  is running on this
[03:23:41.200 --> 03:23:43.200]  position of dualism
[03:23:43.200 --> 03:23:45.200]  good, evil, light, dark
[03:23:45.200 --> 03:23:47.200]  etcetera and he says that
[03:23:47.200 --> 03:23:49.200]  this is a managed dialectic
[03:23:49.200 --> 03:23:51.200]  of order out of chaos and this is
[03:23:51.200 --> 03:23:53.200]  one of his strategies that he used
[03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:55.200]  to help in the cold war
[03:23:55.200 --> 03:23:57.200]  he is one of the architects of
[03:23:57.200 --> 03:23:59.200]  bringing the cold war to a synthesis
[03:23:59.200 --> 03:24:01.200]  of these choosing positions
[03:24:01.200 --> 03:24:03.200]  the synthesis is what
[03:24:03.200 --> 03:24:05.200]  they always wanted
[03:24:05.200 --> 03:24:07.200]  out of this cold war
[03:24:07.200 --> 03:24:09.200]  and he actually says that this dialectic
[03:24:09.200 --> 03:24:11.200]  of false left, right
[03:24:11.200 --> 03:24:13.200]  he says, Zbigniew Brzezinski
[03:24:13.200 --> 03:24:15.200]  right, long time
[03:24:15.200 --> 03:24:17.200]  Pentagon national security advisor
[03:24:17.200 --> 03:24:19.200]  Obama advisor
[03:24:19.200 --> 03:24:21.200]  big super architect of what we live under
[03:24:21.200 --> 03:24:23.200]  technocrat, right, he wrote another book
[03:24:23.200 --> 03:24:25.200]  about between two ages
[03:24:25.200 --> 03:24:27.200]  about technocracy and how we would go
[03:24:27.200 --> 03:24:29.200]  into the technocratic age between two ages
[03:24:29.200 --> 03:24:31.200]  right, well in this book he says
[03:24:31.200 --> 03:24:33.200]  that the dialectic of the false left
[03:24:33.200 --> 03:24:35.200]  right out of the French Revolution
[03:24:35.200 --> 03:24:37.200]  is the same that's in the American system
[03:24:37.200 --> 03:24:39.200]  Brzezinski says that
[03:24:39.200 --> 03:24:41.200]  in strategic vision
[03:24:41.200 --> 03:24:43.200]  and so I want to bring my good friend Richard Grove on
[03:24:43.200 --> 03:24:45.200]  because I know he knows this very well
[03:24:45.200 --> 03:24:47.200]  you know I think that
[03:24:47.200 --> 03:24:49.200]  when we look at somebody like Yay
[03:24:49.200 --> 03:24:51.200]  when you first wake up to a lot of this stuff
[03:24:51.200 --> 03:24:53.200]  there's always a danger of kind of going down
[03:24:53.200 --> 03:24:55.200]  false rabbit trails, false leads
[03:24:55.200 --> 03:24:57.200]  and you know I know
[03:24:57.200 --> 03:24:59.200]  there was a lot of trolling going on but at the same time
[03:24:59.200 --> 03:25:01.200]  you know that the
[03:25:01.200 --> 03:25:03.200]  system of eugenics that was
[03:25:03.200 --> 03:25:05.200]  accepted in Nazi Germany is really
[03:25:05.200 --> 03:25:07.200]  no different
[03:25:07.200 --> 03:25:09.200]  ultimately than the system of eugenics
[03:25:09.200 --> 03:25:11.200]  promoted by the socialists
[03:25:11.200 --> 03:25:13.200]  did you know the Fabian socialists also
[03:25:13.200 --> 03:25:15.200]  adopted and accepted eugenics
[03:25:15.200 --> 03:25:17.200]  just as much as the Nazis did
[03:25:17.200 --> 03:25:19.200]  and so the British
[03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:21.200]  as an example the Royal Society
[03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:23.200]  the Royal Institute of International Affairs
[03:25:23.200 --> 03:25:25.200]  they're the ones that
[03:25:25.200 --> 03:25:27.200]  prior to any of this stuff with Hitler
[03:25:27.200 --> 03:25:29.200]  any of that were the socialists
[03:25:29.200 --> 03:25:31.200]  they're the ones that actually had
[03:25:31.200 --> 03:25:33.200]  a real Darwinist philosophy of
[03:25:33.200 --> 03:25:35.200]  Malthusian depopulation
[03:25:35.200 --> 03:25:37.200]  Richard are you there?
[03:25:37.200 --> 03:25:39.200]  Yeah, how you doing Jay?
[03:25:39.200 --> 03:25:41.200]  So we're going to move from
[03:25:41.200 --> 03:25:43.200]  Yay's, Balenciaga, victimhood
[03:25:43.200 --> 03:25:45.200]  over to eugenics and Fabian socialism
[03:25:45.200 --> 03:25:47.200]  that's a good transition
[03:25:47.200 --> 03:25:49.200]  I think it's a good investment of time
[03:25:49.200 --> 03:25:51.200]  I've got Zabinyu Brzezinski's
[03:25:51.200 --> 03:25:53.200]  between two ages
[03:25:53.200 --> 03:25:55.200]  on the shelf back there but I really wanted
[03:25:55.200 --> 03:25:57.200]  the key off of what you said with Huxley
[03:25:57.200 --> 03:25:59.200]  Huxley's Brave New World
[03:25:59.200 --> 03:26:01.200]  chapter one starts out with the incubator
[03:26:01.200 --> 03:26:03.200]  room where the government grows its children
[03:26:03.200 --> 03:26:05.200]  so that there's no pesky
[03:26:05.200 --> 03:26:07.200]  parents in between
[03:26:07.200 --> 03:26:09.200]  and if you've seen the 3D printed
[03:26:09.200 --> 03:26:11.200]  pod story in the past week
[03:26:11.200 --> 03:26:13.200]  you're going to be incubated in the pod
[03:26:13.200 --> 03:26:15.200]  and you can also dye in the pod
[03:26:15.200 --> 03:26:17.200]  they have the euthanasia pods out there
[03:26:17.200 --> 03:26:19.200]  so this whole theme of
[03:26:19.200 --> 03:26:21.200]  what starts with Malthus and the preservation
[03:26:21.200 --> 03:26:23.200]  of the favored races that's followed
[03:26:23.200 --> 03:26:25.200]  with Darwin
[03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:27.200]  that's the subtitle of Origin of Species
[03:26:27.200 --> 03:26:29.200]  preservation of the favored races
[03:26:29.200 --> 03:26:31.200]  sounds like an institutionalized
[03:26:31.200 --> 03:26:33.200]  racism type of idea
[03:26:33.200 --> 03:26:35.200]  maybe we should look into these people
[03:26:35.200 --> 03:26:37.200]  Darwin's Bulldog was a guy named Th
[03:26:37.200 --> 03:26:39.200]  Huxley and he had a son named
[03:26:39.200 --> 03:26:41.200]  Leonard Huxley, Leonard had two kids
[03:26:41.200 --> 03:26:43.200]  that are prominent, Aldis and Julian
[03:26:43.200 --> 03:26:45.200]  Julian Huxley became the World
[03:26:45.200 --> 03:26:47.200]  Eugenics Foundation
[03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:49.200]  lead person as well as UNESCO
[03:26:49.200 --> 03:26:51.200]  which ties in the United Nations
[03:26:51.200 --> 03:26:53.200]  that Mike and Alex were just talking about in the last segment
[03:26:53.200 --> 03:26:55.200]  so this idea of globalism
[03:26:55.200 --> 03:26:57.200]  it spans back to the British Empire
[03:26:57.200 --> 03:26:59.200]  wanting to take over America
[03:26:59.200 --> 03:27:01.200]  the British Empire then picked up allies along the way
[03:27:01.200 --> 03:27:03.200]  there's other factions out there
[03:27:03.200 --> 03:27:05.200]  that would like to see America destroyed
[03:27:05.200 --> 03:27:07.200]  and essentially the creation
[03:27:07.200 --> 03:27:09.200]  of Soviet Russia
[03:27:09.200 --> 03:27:11.200]  Communist China were facilitated by these same
[03:27:11.200 --> 03:27:13.200]  robber barons who also funded
[03:27:13.200 --> 03:27:15.200]  the Third Reich back in World War II
[03:27:15.200 --> 03:27:17.200]  but before that
[03:27:17.200 --> 03:27:19.200]  they got Hitler to adopt Eugenics
[03:27:19.200 --> 03:27:21.200]  and the Cold Spring
[03:27:21.200 --> 03:27:23.200]  Harbor ideas of Eastern elites
[03:27:23.200 --> 03:27:25.200]  and also British Eugenicists were
[03:27:25.200 --> 03:27:27.200]  along for the ride as well
[03:27:27.200 --> 03:27:29.200]  Yeah exactly
[03:27:29.200 --> 03:27:31.200]  you can go way further back
[03:27:31.200 --> 03:27:33.200]  maybe even to the old caste system
[03:27:33.200 --> 03:27:35.200]  in which I think was kind of adopted
[03:27:35.200 --> 03:27:37.200]  out of the ancient Hindu system
[03:27:37.200 --> 03:27:39.200]  of evolutionary
[03:27:39.200 --> 03:27:41.200]  scales of lesser evolved people
[03:27:41.200 --> 03:27:43.200]  and more evolved people I think that's where
[03:27:43.200 --> 03:27:45.200]  Darwin I think his granddad had adopted
[03:27:45.200 --> 03:27:47.200]  some of this weird esoteric philosophy
[03:27:47.200 --> 03:27:49.200]  out of Hinduism which they
[03:27:49.200 --> 03:27:51.200]  got from
[03:27:51.200 --> 03:27:53.200]  some of these secret societies
[03:27:53.200 --> 03:27:55.200]  and I'm glad you mentioned Brave New World
[03:27:55.200 --> 03:27:57.200]  because on page 17
[03:27:57.200 --> 03:27:59.200]  if you have this copy of it
[03:27:59.200 --> 03:28:01.200]  Huxley goes on to say
[03:28:01.200 --> 03:28:03.200]  in the story that
[03:28:03.200 --> 03:28:05.200]  in this future scenario
[03:28:05.200 --> 03:28:07.200]  not only are you grown in a test tube
[03:28:07.200 --> 03:28:09.200]  everyone is
[03:28:09.200 --> 03:28:11.200]  inoculated by mandate
[03:28:11.200 --> 03:28:13.200]  at birth typical workers
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:15.200]  the working class start
[03:28:15.200 --> 03:28:17.200]  by being inoculated
[03:28:17.200 --> 03:28:19.200]  at meter 150 he says
[03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:21.200]  we immunize them
[03:28:21.200 --> 03:28:23.200]  against all diseases
[03:28:23.200 --> 03:28:25.200]  now diseases of course this is just a code
[03:28:25.200 --> 03:28:27.200]  this is just part of that process of creating
[03:28:27.200 --> 03:28:29.200]  the slave class
[03:28:29.200 --> 03:28:31.200]  creating this tiered system
[03:28:31.200 --> 03:28:33.200]  which you might think well I thought the revolutions
[03:28:33.200 --> 03:28:35.200]  were about getting us equality right
[03:28:35.200 --> 03:28:37.200]  I thought social justice it's about equality
[03:28:37.200 --> 03:28:39.200]  but the odd thing is that in this
[03:28:39.200 --> 03:28:41.200]  Brave New World scenario it's a rigid hierarchy
[03:28:41.200 --> 03:28:43.200]  based on
[03:28:43.200 --> 03:28:45.200]  genetics that are controlled
[03:28:45.200 --> 03:28:47.200]  and there's another guy who wrote about this
[03:28:47.200 --> 03:28:49.200]  his name was Jonas Salk and he wrote a book called
[03:28:49.200 --> 03:28:51.200]  Survival the wisest and he says
[03:28:51.200 --> 03:28:53.200]  that the inoculations
[03:28:53.200 --> 03:28:55.200]  are an experiment don't go anywhere this is the Alex Jones
[03:28:55.200 --> 03:29:19.200]  we'll be right back with Richard Grove
[03:29:25.200 --> 03:29:27.200]  so you've only got a few weeks to get these products
[03:29:27.200 --> 03:29:29.200]  at the lowest price

[03:29:31.200 --> 03:29:33.200]  don't fight the crowds don't fight the traffic
[03:29:33.200 --> 03:29:35.200]  don't do all your Christmas shopping in a month like a fool
[03:29:35.200 --> 03:29:37.200]  do it now

[03:29:55.200 --> 03:29:57.200]  get it all over with
[03:29:57.200 --> 03:29:59.200]  once a tragedy
[03:29:59.200 --> 03:30:01.200]  reaches a level of national significance
[03:30:01.200 --> 03:30:03.200]  American citizens
[03:30:03.200 --> 03:30:05.200]  should be allowed
[03:30:05.200 --> 03:30:07.200]  to basically question that event
[03:30:07.200 --> 03:30:09.200]  in any way that they deem fit
[03:30:09.200 --> 03:30:11.200]  the first amendment is unique in the world
[03:30:11.200 --> 03:30:13.200]  that's what they want to take away
[03:30:13.200 --> 03:30:15.200]  your ability to speak freely
[03:30:15.200 --> 03:30:17.200]  so they're going to be from Mike Lindell next
[03:30:17.200 --> 03:30:19.200]  I studied the global
[03:30:19.200 --> 03:30:21.200]  30 years ago but only 28 years
[03:30:21.200 --> 03:30:24.800]  And I knew they were planning all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul
[03:30:24.800 --> 03:30:25.800]  Revere.
[03:30:25.800 --> 03:30:29.180]  But I couldn't have done it without your support, and now because we've been so successful
[03:30:29.180 --> 03:30:33.360]  warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one
[03:30:33.360 --> 03:30:35.360]  when it comes to the global agenda.
[03:30:35.360 --> 03:30:39.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been
[03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:40.680]  because of your past support.
[03:30:40.680 --> 03:30:44.520]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,

[03:31:02.680 --> 03:31:07.760]  victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[03:31:07.760 --> 03:31:13.280]  possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[03:31:13.280 --> 03:31:18.880]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, it made
[03:31:18.880 --> 03:31:24.160]  any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars, despite the
[03:31:24.160 --> 03:31:30.280]  massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory libelous campaign
[03:31:30.280 --> 03:31:35.400]  against InfoWars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make
[03:31:35.400 --> 03:31:40.480]  their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air, and
[03:31:40.480 --> 03:31:46.320]  what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian
[03:31:46.320 --> 03:31:47.320]  oppression.

[03:32:59.080 --> 03:33:06.080]  Bringing up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.080 --> 03:33:15.800]  Welcome back to The Office of Jones, I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:33:15.800 --> 03:33:18.520]  You know, if you follow my work, you know, I've been lecturing through a lot of texts
[03:33:18.520 --> 03:33:24.520]  that deal with the history of the Fabian Socialist Society and their connection to Bolshevism,
[03:33:24.520 --> 03:33:28.520]  and who was funding a lot of these socialists and these revolutionaries and these communists,
[03:33:28.520 --> 03:33:33.120]  and of course, I did cover the well-known book, Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution
[03:33:33.120 --> 03:33:37.400]  by Anthony Sutton, and we've gone into a lot of depth with the Ratio book on the Fabians
[03:33:37.400 --> 03:33:40.160]  and Lord Milner, but there's another book that Sutton did that's really important that
[03:33:40.160 --> 03:33:45.840]  relates to recent material, recent controversy, which is Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler.
[03:33:45.840 --> 03:33:48.800]  And that's what I'm trying to demonstrate, and Richard knows this so well, which is
[03:33:48.800 --> 03:33:54.040]  that there's a higher level game being played, and in the modern era, those older systems
[03:33:54.040 --> 03:34:00.440]  of Fabian socialism, national socialism, and even to a degree, monopoly capitalism,
[03:34:00.440 --> 03:34:03.600]  which I think still has a lot of power and control, that's kind of the thing that's still
[03:34:03.600 --> 03:34:10.640]  here sitting over all this, debt-based world global capitalism, that debt system is manipulating
[03:34:10.640 --> 03:34:14.680]  these other systems, and you have a lot of people like Bertrand Russell coming out of
[03:34:14.680 --> 03:34:19.760]  the Fabian Society, H.G. Wells, talking about how they would do these experiments in these
[03:34:19.760 --> 03:34:20.760]  other countries.
[03:34:20.760 --> 03:34:23.760]  So, Bolshevism is an experiment in Russia.
[03:34:23.760 --> 03:34:29.160]  National socialism is an experiment in Germany, and national socialism wasn't the first to
[03:34:29.160 --> 03:34:31.040]  have that eugenics-based policy.
[03:34:31.040 --> 03:34:35.600]  It was the U.K., and as I think Richard was alluding to, Kaiser Wilhelm, right, prior
[03:34:35.600 --> 03:34:40.720]  to Hitler, Kaiser Wilhelm already believed in a very hard-core version of eugenics.
[03:34:40.720 --> 03:34:45.840]  So it precedes Hitler, it actually goes back to the British Empire, as we've said, and
[03:34:45.840 --> 03:34:48.600]  one more point before I go to you, Richard, which is that I'm glad you mentioned that
[03:34:48.600 --> 03:34:54.640]  UNESCO, philosophy of UNESCO, because if you read the document at the beginning, Julian
[03:34:54.640 --> 03:35:01.120]  Huxley, brother to Aldous, who did Break New World, Julian says, eugenics is not popular
[03:35:01.120 --> 03:35:02.120]  anymore.
[03:35:02.120 --> 03:35:05.200]  We're going to have to rebrand this, right, due to World War II and Hitler.
[03:35:05.200 --> 03:35:10.960]  Let's just rename this biometrics and health, right?
[03:35:10.960 --> 03:35:17.640]  And so he says, we'll go under the cloak of health and culture, and we'll just do the
[03:35:17.640 --> 03:35:22.520]  same eugenics and dysgenics program through rebranding.
[03:35:22.520 --> 03:35:28.160]  I'll throw it to you, Richard, if you want to comment on that.
[03:35:28.160 --> 03:35:29.880]  There's a lot of rebranding going on.
[03:35:29.880 --> 03:35:32.560]  I mean, let's go back to the British Empire.
[03:35:32.560 --> 03:35:37.000]  Cecil Rhodes, Alex mentioned about an hour and a half ago on the show, was a colonizer
[03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:38.880]  on behalf of the British Empire.
[03:35:38.880 --> 03:35:40.760]  He had a best friend, his name was Rudd, your Kipling.
[03:35:40.760 --> 03:35:44.360]  If you go back and look at Kipling's books, there's an interesting sun symbol on the edge
[03:35:44.360 --> 03:35:46.000]  of all of Kipling's books.
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:50.440]  Eventually, that group, along with Prescott Bush and some people from America, they decided
[03:35:50.440 --> 03:35:53.760]  to prop up a regime during their hyperinflation phase.
[03:35:53.760 --> 03:35:58.280]  A lot of American capital went overseas during our Great Depression phase and helped to prop
[03:35:58.280 --> 03:36:03.480]  up a guy who was not so popular in American culture or war culture because of how that
[03:36:03.480 --> 03:36:06.120]  war ended and the things that went on during that war.
[03:36:06.120 --> 03:36:08.200]  But there's also some other atrocities.
[03:36:08.200 --> 03:36:09.280]  I brought a couple books.
[03:36:09.280 --> 03:36:12.520]  I have the history of the Fabian Society, if you want to talk about that.
[03:36:12.520 --> 03:36:16.400]  I have the molecular vision of life that's Caltech, Rockefeller, and the new eugenics
[03:36:16.400 --> 03:36:18.680]  that they branded after World War II.
[03:36:18.680 --> 03:36:23.480]  But I also have Operation Paperclip where the people who funded the Nazis in the first place
[03:36:23.480 --> 03:36:26.960]  brought back their best and brightest to conduct experiments in the United States.
[03:36:26.960 --> 03:36:30.640]  They also took some of those and put them in their Soviet experiment over in Russia.
[03:36:30.640 --> 03:36:33.360]  This is all very well documented by Anthony Sutton.
[03:36:33.360 --> 03:36:37.280]  If you read Zbigniew Brzezinski's Between Two Ages in a footnote on the right-hand page,
[03:36:37.280 --> 03:36:43.040]  he says for impressive history of Western technology being inserted into the Soviet Union,
[03:36:43.040 --> 03:36:46.160]  reference Anthony Sutton's three-volume series on such.
[03:36:46.160 --> 03:36:49.720]  Then Sutton wrote another three-volume series more for the public, Wall Street and the Bolshevik
[03:36:49.720 --> 03:36:56.400]  Revolution, Wall Street and Hitler, Wall Street and FDR was the last one.
[03:36:56.400 --> 03:37:00.720]  There was a combine of finances behind the scenes of World War II.
[03:37:00.720 --> 03:37:06.560]  Then I also have a book here by the guy who led MI6 who says that they got America into
[03:37:06.560 --> 03:37:08.520]  the war kind of unfaithfully.
[03:37:08.520 --> 03:37:12.000]  They knew ahead of time about Pearl Harbor, but they needed America into the war.
[03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:16.680]  So there's a lot of British Empire history that I think was left out of Kanye's perspective.
[03:37:16.680 --> 03:37:20.320]  For instance, yesterday, but it's always more to learn.
[03:37:20.320 --> 03:37:24.920]  I'm a learner every day.
[03:37:24.920 --> 03:37:30.800]  Derek, you muted.
[03:37:30.800 --> 03:37:38.200]  One of the texts that I've worked through and lectured on over the years in passing
[03:37:38.200 --> 03:37:43.440]  is this very dense, very hefty history of British intelligence by Stephen Dorrell.
[03:37:43.440 --> 03:37:48.960]  This is a must-have text because as a mainline historian, Dorrell is really just giving the
[03:37:48.960 --> 03:37:54.120]  20th century from not just the British imperial perspective, but from the intelligence apparatus,
[03:37:54.120 --> 03:37:55.120]  from their perspective.
[03:37:55.120 --> 03:37:56.120]  What were they really doing?
[03:37:56.120 --> 03:37:57.360]  What were they really up to?
[03:37:57.360 --> 03:38:02.000]  As you read this text, he goes through most of the things that we think of as conspiracy
[03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:05.000]  theory as just obvious, well-known admissions.
[03:38:05.000 --> 03:38:08.320]  For example, he talks about staging false flags.
[03:38:08.320 --> 03:38:15.800]  He talks about the bio warfare programs that are porting down, evolving out of the British
[03:38:15.800 --> 03:38:17.400]  version of MKUltra.
[03:38:17.400 --> 03:38:24.000]  He talks about Bohemian Grove and Bilderberg as if, well, yeah, of course, as if they're
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:27.920]  humans, they're not conspiracy theories to this level of people and to this level of
[03:38:27.920 --> 03:38:28.920]  research.
[03:38:28.920 --> 03:38:33.600]  They're common, obvious things that people on the inside know about, but they're counting
[03:38:33.600 --> 03:38:37.320]  on people on the outside, the public, not knowing this thing, knowing this stuff because
[03:38:37.320 --> 03:38:38.720]  of the dummy down of education.
[03:38:38.720 --> 03:38:41.720]  Yeah, they're not supposed to know about Cecil Rhodes.
[03:38:41.720 --> 03:38:45.520]  You're not supposed to know about a book like the New World Order by Sean Stone that clearly
[03:38:45.520 --> 03:38:49.120]  on the cover shows America being overtaken by the British Empire.
[03:38:49.120 --> 03:38:54.480]  It's an unassailable history, but you need to understand the grammar of the individual
[03:38:54.480 --> 03:38:58.160]  players, of Rhodes, Lionel Curtis, the people that were in that milieu of Anglo-American
[03:38:58.160 --> 03:39:02.560]  establishment-ness to remove the sovereignty of America, to drag our reputation through
[03:39:02.560 --> 03:39:08.280]  the mud, to inherit as property managers hundreds of bases around the world that we didn't initiate.
[03:39:08.280 --> 03:39:10.760]  There's the Anglo-American establishment by Quigley.
[03:39:10.760 --> 03:39:15.880]  He was so scared of the whistleblower story that he got in 1948 that that book wasn't
[03:39:15.880 --> 03:39:19.000]  published until 1981 after Quigley died.
[03:39:19.000 --> 03:39:24.360]  In the New York Times article in 1976 with Rudy Maxa, Quigley can be heard in the audio
[03:39:24.360 --> 03:39:25.360]  tape.
[03:39:25.360 --> 03:39:26.360]  You can listen to it for yourself.
[03:39:26.360 --> 03:39:30.600]  When Rudy Maxa asks him about Lionel Curtis, the progenitor, the people who carried on
[03:39:30.600 --> 03:39:34.040]  Cecil Rhodes' last will and testament, Quigley's like, don't talk about that unless you want
[03:39:34.040 --> 03:39:35.040]  to lose your career.
[03:39:35.040 --> 03:39:36.040]  And that's where the tape ends.
[03:39:36.040 --> 03:39:40.800]  They had a nice conversation about how McMillan and company conspired and lied to Quigley
[03:39:40.800 --> 03:39:45.360]  about the destruction of the plates so that they couldn't publish Tragedy and Hope, the
[03:39:45.360 --> 03:39:51.440]  big 1300 page book anymore, and so that underground censorship built up a following of why, why
[03:39:51.440 --> 03:39:53.320]  does this book have to be censored?
[03:39:53.320 --> 03:39:58.520]  And so this story should be well known, especially to Americans who are the target of the plot
[03:39:58.520 --> 03:40:03.440]  of a group of international conspirators of which David Rockefeller, Brzezinski's mentor,
[03:40:03.440 --> 03:40:04.440]  was one of them.
[03:40:04.440 --> 03:40:12.360]  Nelson Rockefeller, his, his, I'm sorry, David, mentor Kissinger, Nellie, mentor Brzezinski,
[03:40:12.360 --> 03:40:15.800]  I got those backwards, David was Brzezinski and Nelson is Kissinger.
[03:40:15.800 --> 03:40:21.280]  They're so hard to keep them apart, those, those book ends of history, I will have you
[03:40:21.280 --> 03:40:24.040]  assassinated, you must get it clear.
[03:40:24.040 --> 03:40:25.560]  He's still kicking, isn't he?
[03:40:25.560 --> 03:40:27.720]  Kissinger still have to roll around.
[03:40:27.720 --> 03:40:31.840]  Brzezinski has departed, but between the book ends of the brothers Rockefeller and their
[03:40:31.840 --> 03:40:38.280]  political statecraft over the past 60 or 70 years, David is an admitted internationalist,
[03:40:38.280 --> 03:40:39.480]  a proud internationalist.
[03:40:39.480 --> 03:40:40.960]  He says so in his memoirs.
[03:40:40.960 --> 03:40:46.160]  But I'm just a fan of, of history books and these quotes that illustrate a narrative outside
[03:40:46.160 --> 03:40:47.800]  what people consider to be real.
[03:40:47.800 --> 03:40:51.520]  And outside that narrative of what they consider to be real, they let label everything conspiracy
[03:40:51.520 --> 03:40:52.520]  theory.
[03:40:52.520 --> 03:40:53.520]  Yes.
[03:40:53.520 --> 03:40:56.520]  Well, where do you think you're going to be in 10 years if you don't enlarge your world
[03:40:56.520 --> 03:40:59.360]  and look at the facts that exist outside the narrative?
[03:40:59.360 --> 03:41:06.000]  Where are you going to be if you don't realize that CIA document 1035-960 concerning criticism
[03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:11.520]  of the Warren commission report was a pejorative connotation of the conspiracy theorist genre
[03:41:11.520 --> 03:41:17.000]  or use of that phrase because of Edward J. Epstein's book in quest, questioning the nature
[03:41:17.000 --> 03:41:19.880]  and how the Warren commission made their decision.
[03:41:19.880 --> 03:41:21.640]  So they had a problem with the journalist.
[03:41:21.640 --> 03:41:26.320]  They made up a phrase and now that phrase limits people, people's capacity for what
[03:41:26.320 --> 03:41:27.520]  reality is.
[03:41:27.520 --> 03:41:32.320]  I just simply point out, convenient pieces, it's like, here's Rockefeller, Caltech and
[03:41:32.320 --> 03:41:33.320]  the new eugenics.
[03:41:33.320 --> 03:41:34.320]  Read it.
[03:41:34.320 --> 03:41:37.280]  It's MIT professor Lily Kay, who's also departed.
[03:41:37.280 --> 03:41:40.840]  There's a lot of good books out there on these topics that are being discussed, but no one's
[03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:46.880]  kind of bringing the history, the context and smashing the unrealistic claims into their
[03:41:46.880 --> 03:41:49.720]  reasonable realities of the evidence.
[03:41:49.720 --> 03:41:50.720]  Yeah.
[03:41:50.720 --> 03:41:56.160]  I mean, and to be clear, I don't want people to misunderstand, not saying that if you read
[03:41:56.160 --> 03:42:00.440]  a book like this, like, oh, we're saying that it's the British Empire secretly that is still
[03:42:00.440 --> 03:42:01.440]  running things.
[03:42:01.440 --> 03:42:05.000]  It's not really the British Empire per se, but the British Empire, in my view, was kind
[03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:10.360]  of a cutout, kind of a front for an inner click, the Rhodes Milner Roundtable groups
[03:42:10.360 --> 03:42:15.160]  that was running the British Empire and then getting the US back under that umbrella back
[03:42:15.160 --> 03:42:21.720]  into interventionism, into internationalism, which the US previous to that had a isolationist
[03:42:21.720 --> 03:42:22.720]  stance.
[03:42:22.720 --> 03:42:23.880]  That's been demonized as well.
[03:42:23.880 --> 03:42:28.560]  That was all the purpose of the CIR, was to demonize the idea of isolationism and to
[03:42:28.560 --> 03:42:34.160]  get the US back into this internationalism and policing the world, which is what these
[03:42:34.160 --> 03:42:39.600]  oligarchs really is the best way to describe them had as the plan for the US to come back.
[03:42:39.600 --> 03:42:43.120]  And they use a lot of British intelligence assets and agents to get the US back into
[03:42:43.120 --> 03:42:44.120]  that.
[03:42:44.120 --> 03:42:47.600]  That's who set up the OSS and the CIA, the Deep State, so to speak.
[03:42:47.600 --> 03:42:50.120]  The website is Trazion Hope.
[03:42:50.120 --> 03:42:53.160]  His podcast is Grand Theft World Over at Rockfin.
[03:42:53.160 --> 03:42:54.560]  My website is Jay's Analysis.
[03:42:54.560 --> 03:42:55.560]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:55.560 --> 03:42:57.880]  This is Jay Dyer with Richard Grove.

[03:43:50.800 --> 03:43:57.880]  system, live a healthier life and keep InfoWars on the air, infowarstore.com.
[03:43:57.880 --> 03:44:03.280]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[03:44:03.280 --> 03:44:05.320]  a healthier life.
[03:44:05.320 --> 03:44:09.160]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement
[03:44:09.160 --> 03:44:10.780]  that contains both.
[03:44:10.780 --> 03:44:15.760]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase

[03:44:17.360 --> 03:44:22.200]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[03:44:22.200 --> 03:44:24.920]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[03:44:24.920 --> 03:44:29.800]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[03:44:29.800 --> 03:44:34.440]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[03:44:34.440 --> 03:44:35.440]  shown.
[03:44:35.440 --> 03:44:39.720]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[03:44:39.720 --> 03:44:44.320]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[03:44:44.320 --> 03:44:49.400]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[03:44:49.400 --> 03:44:50.400]  like here in America.
[03:44:50.400 --> 03:44:55.200]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise

[03:45:57.440 --> 03:46:03.320]  Let's say tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[03:46:03.320 --> 03:46:08.680]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:46:08.680 --> 03:46:12.520]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[03:46:12.520 --> 03:46:13.520]  to speak freely.
[03:46:13.520 --> 03:46:16.760]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon or
[03:46:16.760 --> 03:46:18.240]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[03:46:18.240 --> 03:46:22.360]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years and I knew they were planning
[03:46:22.360 --> 03:46:26.680]  all of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[03:46:26.680 --> 03:46:27.680]  your support.
[03:46:27.680 --> 03:46:31.720]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America,
[03:46:31.720 --> 03:46:35.240]  we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[03:46:35.240 --> 03:46:38.920]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[03:46:38.920 --> 03:46:40.600]  because of your past support.
[03:46:40.600 --> 03:46:44.400]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,

[03:46:48.840 --> 03:46:49.840]  on air.

[03:46:55.280 --> 03:46:58.440]  your support.
[03:46:58.440 --> 03:47:02.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[03:47:02.960 --> 03:47:05.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.960 --> 03:47:16.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones on your guest says Jay Dyer of Jace analysis and I am here
[03:47:16.800 --> 03:47:23.400]  with my good friend Richard Grove of treasenhope.com and of the Grand Theft World podcast and you
[03:47:23.400 --> 03:47:26.920]  know Richard's been killing over there on Grand Theft World with some of these interviews
[03:47:26.920 --> 03:47:31.000]  that he's been doing with people like Whitney Webb and I noticed they went into really into
[03:47:31.000 --> 03:47:36.040]  a lot of depth in regard to the blackmail and the espionage and all of that and that's
[03:47:36.040 --> 03:47:41.320]  because you know a big part of how the system works is understanding the intelligence apparatus
[03:47:41.320 --> 03:47:45.240]  and as we were talking about the British Empire was reminded of this excellent book by Dr.
[03:47:45.240 --> 03:47:49.880]  Richard Spence which is the the Crowley right so everybody knows about Alistair Crowley
[03:47:49.880 --> 03:47:53.480]  as this oh he's the famous satanist he's the most evil man in the world all this stuff
[03:47:53.480 --> 03:47:58.200]  from the 20th century and pop culture Hollywood you know everybody speaking of Kanye not
[03:47:58.200 --> 03:48:03.200]  Kanye per se but you know Kanye used to be hanging out with Beyonce and Jay Z and they're
[03:48:03.200 --> 03:48:07.680]  big promoters of Crowley over the years and what's fascinating is that a lot of people
[03:48:07.680 --> 03:48:12.440]  don't know that Crowley was actually an asset of British intelligence and he was used in
[03:48:12.440 --> 03:48:20.760]  a lot of propaganda and sort of co-op co-opting other people in various missions and so you
[03:48:20.760 --> 03:48:25.800]  know why would why would Crowley be useful in that regard well Crowley had a philosophy
[03:48:25.800 --> 03:48:30.120]  where he said the slaves will serve and what he meant by that was that he was essentially
[03:48:30.120 --> 03:48:37.000]  adopting an occult version of the the dehumanization philosophy which is thus this operating system
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:42.160]  of the Malthusian British imperial system right that there's a giant mass of the population
[03:48:42.160 --> 03:48:47.040]  are essentially slaves that don't have any capability of thinking beyond just being
[03:48:47.040 --> 03:48:51.880]  sort of animals and so they're dehumanized into being viewed like animals that is the
[03:48:51.880 --> 03:48:57.120]  ultimately the social Darwinist system and that's the operating system that the US adopted
[03:48:57.120 --> 03:49:01.720]  you see if you look at things like State Department memorandum 200 if you look at the writings
[03:49:01.720 --> 03:49:07.040]  of Kissinger if you look at the writings of Brzezinski right that the American intelligence
[03:49:07.040 --> 03:49:13.400]  establishment the the planners the big scale planners they adopted wholesale this system
[03:49:13.400 --> 03:49:17.960]  and that is the key to understanding what is being pushed with the great reset with
[03:49:17.960 --> 03:49:22.720]  transhumanism with Klaus and so Richard again I know you've got Klaus back there I got my
[03:49:22.720 --> 03:49:26.720]  Klaus right here with me would you would you care to comment on that how we're just
[03:49:26.720 --> 03:49:32.680]  it's the same system it's just kind of given a high tech overlay now for sure let me start
[03:49:32.680 --> 03:49:37.760]  at the beginning Grand Theft World Podcast is on Banda video thank you Banda video we
[03:49:37.760 --> 03:49:41.920]  did four hours of interview between Whitney Webb's two volumes of her books it's impeccable
[03:49:41.920 --> 03:49:46.800]  it tells a very important story that carries back into BCCI and Iran Contra and I also
[03:49:46.800 --> 03:49:52.020]  brought for you the predicament of mankind the 1970 document that led to the world economic
[03:49:52.020 --> 03:49:57.480]  form and Klaus swabs 1973 Davos manifesto with Prince Bernard of the Netherlands a former
[03:49:57.480 --> 03:50:02.320]  SS officer and also Prince Philip a former eugenicist who wanted to come back as a virus
[03:50:02.320 --> 03:50:07.960]  to kill everybody and that whole movement picked up by the club of Rome into the world
[03:50:07.960 --> 03:50:13.760]  economic form precipitates down on us today as the great reset so if we don't understand
[03:50:13.760 --> 03:50:17.160]  what's going on in the past you're not going to understand their agenda for the present
[03:50:17.160 --> 03:50:21.200]  or the future they've already planned for you and you can just read about in their documents
[03:50:21.200 --> 03:50:25.720]  it's not conspiracy theory it's actually what literate people do if they want to stay free
[03:50:25.720 --> 03:50:33.160]  in a society kind of hell bent on taking away freedom yeah in the in the past century it
[03:50:33.160 --> 03:50:40.040]  was called the great game right and for example there was a book that I read many years ago
[03:50:40.040 --> 03:50:47.440]  by a CIA analyst guy who then went on to write about fiction and it's an important book because
[03:50:47.440 --> 03:50:54.160]  it's a great game I think Jay yeah exactly exactly and the reason I'm bringing up the
[03:50:54.160 --> 03:50:59.320]  fiction is that you understand that the the British espionage writers a hundred years
[03:50:59.320 --> 03:51:06.160]  ago realized that one of the better ways to program people was through stories and so
[03:51:06.160 --> 03:51:11.400]  that's why you read books like you know Brave New World right which is basically giving
[03:51:11.400 --> 03:51:17.800]  this this idea that this is a necessary future this must come to be and that's part of the
[03:51:17.800 --> 03:51:22.920]  great game which I said is them is managing the dialectic in terms of narrative or story
[03:51:22.920 --> 03:51:29.200]  so rather than looking at the facts of what went down the control system thrives on giving
[03:51:29.200 --> 03:51:34.600]  a story that limits the the perception in terms of a false dialectic that brzezinski
[03:51:34.600 --> 03:51:39.360]  talked about in strategic vision of a false manichean either or so you are kept within
[03:51:39.360 --> 03:51:44.800]  the circle within this box you have two false choices and it doesn't just apply to democrat
[03:51:44.800 --> 03:51:49.400]  and republican it applies to all of the events and narratives that come out in the mainstream
[03:51:49.400 --> 03:51:54.680]  media they have to be told in a false either or and you see it in the programming of the
[03:51:54.680 --> 03:51:59.760]  fiction and that's what I'm trying to get at with books like the great game well and
[03:51:59.760 --> 03:52:04.600]  also h.g. Wells and some of his nonfiction works I mean he wrote a book called the new
[03:52:04.600 --> 03:52:10.160]  world order he wrote a book the new Machiavelli he wrote several books on this capacity but
[03:52:10.160 --> 03:52:15.800]  he discloses it in his experiment on autobiography where he says he's hanging out with the Fabian
[03:52:15.800 --> 03:52:20.400]  socialists and he confirms much of what Quigley had attributed to Alfred Zimmern and the other
[03:52:20.400 --> 03:52:24.080]  whistleblowers who brought forth that information that ended up in tragedy and hope the big
[03:52:24.080 --> 03:52:29.120]  book and Anglo-American establishment so there is a long history it's all in English fortunately
[03:52:29.120 --> 03:52:33.320]  the people trying to do this they also speak the same language so it's pretty easy to read
[03:52:33.320 --> 03:52:36.880]  into their documents and their plans for the future and the things they said they do in
[03:52:36.880 --> 03:52:43.480]  the past like agenda 21 back in 92 seemed like far off and by agenda 21 they said they
[03:52:43.480 --> 03:52:48.680]  were going to eradicate polio and so here we are at agenda 2030 that's still a thing
[03:52:48.680 --> 03:52:54.080]  so not everything that they plan to do gets done but it is interesting to see their continuous
[03:52:54.080 --> 03:53:01.880]  planning for the future and the United Nations plans also mash up with the DC DC strategic
[03:53:01.880 --> 03:53:06.800]  trends program that the UK Ministry of Defense rolls out and they've been predicting the
[03:53:06.800 --> 03:53:10.840]  future decades and decades out for decades and decades now you can go back and read
[03:53:10.840 --> 03:53:17.040]  2007's report about 2030 and see if it matches up with the 2030 United Nations and World Economic
[03:53:17.040 --> 03:53:21.120]  Forum great recent agenda there's only so many people on the planet with a small group
[03:53:21.120 --> 03:53:25.040]  of people that want to ruin freedom and they work together it's not a secret they tell
[03:53:25.040 --> 03:53:26.040]  you about it.
[03:53:26.040 --> 03:53:31.160]  Yeah exactly I did a fourth hour here on that UK Ministry of Defense document was declassified
[03:53:31.160 --> 03:53:35.160]  that deals with transhumanism and one of the things that after all the transhumanist stuff
[03:53:35.160 --> 03:53:38.400]  about you know chipping everybody and all this kind of stuff the surveillance there's
[03:53:38.400 --> 03:53:42.800]  a specific section where they go on to talk about how the way they'll bring this in is
[03:53:42.800 --> 03:53:47.520]  by telling stories and changing narratives and so they actually talk about narrative
[03:53:47.520 --> 03:53:51.640]  construction and of course what did Klaus just put out the great narrative right his
[03:53:51.640 --> 03:53:56.960]  one of his new tax and that's because they want to tell this yeah.
[03:53:56.960 --> 03:54:02.240]  This book here the blue book and next time I'll work in book cam so I can show you these
[03:54:02.240 --> 03:54:06.160]  things more in depth but I know we're in a tight schedule today so I'll just keep it
[03:54:06.160 --> 03:54:10.160]  like that. Yeah I mean and another thing I wanted to bring out was about Islam you know
[03:54:10.160 --> 03:54:14.960]  one of the books I've been lecturing through is the Milner Fabian conspiracy by Ratio and
[03:54:14.960 --> 03:54:20.960]  he goes into the history of the idea of bringing Islam into Europe and into England he goes
[03:54:20.960 --> 03:54:24.640]  back to the Fabians it was specifically the Fabians and particularly Bertrand Russell
[03:54:24.640 --> 03:54:31.480]  who said that we will use Islam as a tool to destroy the existing society so that it
[03:54:31.480 --> 03:54:37.040]  can go into the future order and that he's not the only researcher to come to this in
[03:54:37.040 --> 03:54:41.680]  fact Royal Society researcher Mark Curtis who I have lectured through this book many
[03:54:41.680 --> 03:54:46.640]  years ago in his book Secret Affairs he goes into Britain's longtime collusion with all
[03:54:46.640 --> 03:54:51.040]  forms of Islam to bring about some further future goal right this is what I'm trying
[03:54:51.040 --> 03:54:55.360]  to say is that it's not a conspiracy theory it's actual geopolitics another American
[03:54:55.360 --> 03:55:00.040]  researcher Robert Dreyfus he wrote a similar book Devils Game where he looks at it from
[03:55:00.040 --> 03:55:05.520]  the American establishment perspective so both the UK the American is particularly just
[03:55:05.520 --> 03:55:11.560]  the Eastern Seaboard elites they have this strategy of utilizing religions to change
[03:55:11.560 --> 03:55:17.520]  the existing society not because they're altruistic not because Tony Blair as a Fabian said many
[03:55:17.520 --> 03:55:21.920]  years ago oh I love Islam I want more Islam because he actually is altruistic or cares
[03:55:21.920 --> 03:55:28.440]  about religion it's a tool to change the existing society for where they want to go in the future
[03:55:28.440 --> 03:55:33.880]  Miles Copeland says that very thing when he talks about changing Egypt right it's not
[03:55:33.880 --> 03:55:39.120]  because he doesn't like Islam and he wants to modernize Egypt if you read in his book
[03:55:39.120 --> 03:55:44.400]  Game of Nations at the end of it he says the purpose of the modernization of Egypt has
[03:55:44.400 --> 03:55:48.840]  nothing to do with good or bad it has to do with the end goal of population reduction
[03:55:48.840 --> 03:55:52.240]  and changing the existing societies for the technocracy.
[03:55:52.240 --> 03:55:56.960]  You know I'll try to wrap it all in a bow in one minute Kipling wrote a book called
[03:55:56.960 --> 03:56:00.800]  keep in memory it's to train kids to be spies.
[03:56:00.800 --> 03:56:06.240]  Sinjin Philby's son Kim Philby who was a famous spy was trained and named after that method.
[03:56:06.240 --> 03:56:12.000]  Sinjin Philby helped to create the Saudi royal family he was an MI6 agent was getting paid
[03:56:12.000 --> 03:56:15.920]  well after they said he left and that proves everything that Jay was just telling you about
[03:56:15.920 --> 03:56:21.360]  with the Kipling great game bigger picture secret affairs shows where Bin Laden had a
[03:56:21.360 --> 03:56:28.120]  headquarters in London in 1996 and MI6 supported it and so did CIA, Operation Cyclone so Anglo-America
[03:56:28.120 --> 03:56:33.200]  establishment learn more about it every week Grand Theft World dot com.
[03:56:33.200 --> 03:56:37.620]  Yeah exactly and Operation Cyclone that was really the mastermind of Brzezinski right
[03:56:37.620 --> 03:56:43.800]  Brzezinski was the guy who was telling you know the White House here's what we'll do
[03:56:43.800 --> 03:56:48.400]  we'll wind down the Cold War by getting the Soviets bogged down in this conflict we'll
[03:56:48.400 --> 03:56:53.000]  come out the victor at but at the same time he also had the strategy of controlled and
[03:56:53.000 --> 03:56:59.720]  managed chaos in the post Soviet block countries right so the Soviet block had to be then managed
[03:56:59.720 --> 03:57:05.400]  by controlled and managed chaos to bring it into a neoliberal order not because he cared
[03:57:05.400 --> 03:57:09.680]  about free markets or anything like that but because the long-term goal was as Brzezinski
[03:57:09.680 --> 03:57:17.240]  said technocracy to transition the entire world into a technocratic slave system and
[03:57:17.240 --> 03:57:22.520]  that's exactly what Klaus says in the shaping of the fourth industrial revolution.

[03:58:55.640 --> 03:59:01.520]  very heights of politics not just in America but in the world we are engaging the globalist
[03:59:01.520 --> 03:59:07.360]  at point blank range in the information war but I don't deserve the credit yes I persevered
[03:59:07.360 --> 03:59:12.160]  but the listeners and viewers who support in info wars are the real reason you have
[03:59:12.160 --> 03:59:13.160]  the success.
