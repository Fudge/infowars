[00:00.000 --> 00:18.920]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to Alex Jones
[00:18.920 --> 00:28.000]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show on the Sunday August 9th 2015 I'm David Knight your host today
[00:28.000 --> 00:34.560]  we're gonna be taking a look at the debates things are still unfolding we have developed into a
[00:34.560 --> 00:39.960]  soap opera not any more light on the issues that we should be looking at of course issues
[00:39.960 --> 00:45.440]  weren't really covered as one person pointed out this wasn't a debate it was an inquisition by
[00:45.440 --> 00:50.680]  Fox News and so that is now expanding we see that happening in the last couple of days there's been
[00:50.680 --> 00:56.000]  some develop developments between Fox News between Megyn Kelly and Donald Trump the back
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.880]  and forth personal vendetta so we're going to talk about that but I want to go over some of the
[01:00.880 --> 01:07.400]  news in this particular segment that we have we're also going to of course look at some additional
[01:07.400 --> 01:11.680]  information that's come to light about Chris Christie was he telling the truth and this back
[01:11.680 --> 01:16.680]  and forth between Rand Paul and Chris Christie that was one of the few moments of the debate
[01:16.680 --> 01:22.120]  that really got to anything that I think touched on some of our serious problems the rest of it was
[01:22.120 --> 01:28.200]  really essentially personal attacks on a lot of these individuals we're also going to talk about
[01:28.200 --> 01:34.360]  Ben Carson's comments post debate we're going to look at some more information about the Bush
[01:34.360 --> 01:39.640]  family and Planned Parenthood we're going to look at some new revelations that are up on info wars
[01:39.640 --> 01:46.640]  about how some of this tissue is being used with Planned Parenthood that they are passing on and we
[01:46.640 --> 01:51.040]  find that Donald Trump has actually been on the right side of vaccines now this was a few years
[01:51.040 --> 01:56.600]  ago this was back in 2012 this is a story up on info wars calm Trump opposed vaccines and he warned
[01:56.600 --> 02:02.080]  of autism he's been on the right side of the war on drugs as well but we haven't heard that in this
[02:02.080 --> 02:07.920]  debate he also said you're not going to stop the massive crime with the war on drugs unless you
[02:07.920 --> 02:13.080]  decriminalize it well he came out and warned about the connection between autism and vaccines and
[02:13.080 --> 02:17.800]  he says I know that a lot of people don't like to hear that but I don't really care and that's
[02:17.800 --> 02:21.960]  that's the thing about Donald Trump that it's gonna help people he will continue to talk about
[02:21.960 --> 02:27.360]  these issues but then we also have to ask since he's being quiet about it even if he does talk
[02:27.360 --> 02:31.960]  about it will he do anything about it we've seen so many politicians we've seen Ronald Reagan we've
[02:31.960 --> 02:36.920]  seen Bainer McConnell when they're running for office they say one thing when they get into
[02:36.920 --> 02:42.720]  office they do another and so that's one of the things that we're concerned about we see that
[02:42.720 --> 02:50.560]  there is a massive leak by the EPA the EPA of all people they have leaked over a million gallons of
[02:50.560 --> 02:56.440]  toxic waste into the Animas River in the Colorado and is now going down into New Mexico what would
[02:56.440 --> 03:03.240]  they have done to any individual any company if they had done that now they didn't do it deliberately
[03:03.240 --> 03:07.880]  but of course a lot of times we have accidental spills they would have absolutely destroyed
[03:07.880 --> 03:14.400]  anyone else maybe the EPA is too busy trying to take over our energy grid trying to shut down coal
[03:14.400 --> 03:20.400]  to really pay attention to their key mission which is to protect the environment they have
[03:20.400 --> 03:24.360]  become the destructors of the environment we're going to talk about that story in detail if you
[03:24.360 --> 03:29.800]  live out west you need to know about that if you live in Colorado New Mexico it's now headed
[03:29.800 --> 03:35.240]  further south as well it will spill out of that we're also going to take a look at college loans
[03:35.240 --> 03:40.560]  do you realize that delinquent college loans are one of the main reasons that many doctors are
[03:40.560 --> 03:48.000]  losing their license that's how rigorously they go after college loans you can't dismiss them in
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.040]  bankruptcy court we've had situations in the past where the Department of Education has actually
[03:52.040 --> 03:57.560]  used SWAT teams on families because they had a family member one particular case the mother was
[03:57.560 --> 04:02.600]  delinquent and alone they raided the remaining family the father and the children they drug
[04:02.600 --> 04:06.520]  them out in the wee hours of the morning put them face down on the lawn with guns drawn in
[04:06.520 --> 04:13.960]  their face over a delinquent college loan and now they're taking the licenses of doctors this is
[04:13.960 --> 04:18.440]  the kind of authoritarian out of control government that we have but of course we're not seeing any
[04:18.440 --> 04:22.520]  discussions of those types of things we're not seeing any discussions of the Trans-Pacific
[04:22.520 --> 04:26.680]  Partnership this deal that's being done in secret none of these questions were asked at the debate
[04:26.680 --> 04:33.240]  rather it was personal it was petty it was vindictive we're going to take a look at that when
[04:33.240 --> 04:40.120]  we come back the soap opera that has become the debates Megan Kelly putting herself not only center
[04:40.120 --> 04:46.760]  stage at the debate literally but also center stage of the presidential race after the fact stay
[04:46.760 --> 05:03.480]  with us we'll be right back planned parenthood head Cecile Richards want all those bogus videos
[05:03.480 --> 05:09.800]  released at once spoken like someone who really wants to know how much dirt they have on her
[05:09.800 --> 05:16.120]  so she can get her story straight the center for medical progress has hours more footage in the can
[05:16.120 --> 05:21.560]  and is deliberately drip feeding it to the public to keep the issue of organ harvesting from
[05:21.560 --> 05:28.920]  aborted fetuses in the headlines and plan parenthood hates it Richards took to twitter yesterday
[05:28.920 --> 05:36.280]  to complain about the method saying leaking one at a time is playing politics of course this method
[05:36.280 --> 05:42.440]  is being used to maximize impact as it rightfully should releasing them all at once would amount
[05:42.440 --> 05:47.560]  to a little more than outrage of the day status and then it'll be quickly swept under the rug
[05:48.200 --> 05:54.920]  not this time planned parenthood follow this story and the slow torturous release of the
[05:54.920 --> 06:09.160]  upcoming videos at info wars dot com he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to
[06:09.160 --> 06:23.480]  choose a side you're listening to alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show on this sunday
[06:23.480 --> 06:29.480]  august 9th 2015 i'm david night your host we're going to be taking a look at some more information
[06:29.480 --> 06:33.480]  that has come to light with the presidential debate and of course the back and forth between
[06:33.480 --> 06:37.560]  meghan kelly and donald trump has gotten even larger many events have happened in the last
[06:37.560 --> 06:42.760]  couple of days and we're going to try to even talk about some issues that matter but first i
[06:42.760 --> 06:46.600]  want to let you know about what's happened out west with the epa i think this is a wonderful
[06:46.600 --> 06:52.680]  example i shouldn't say wonderful it's a horrible example of how our government actually operates
[06:52.680 --> 06:57.720]  when we bring the government in to solve a problem many cases they make it far worse they become the
[06:57.720 --> 07:03.160]  problem here we now have out west at the enemas river it's been fouled by one million gallons
[07:03.160 --> 07:09.400]  of contaminated water from a mine the epa accidentally released this water into the river
[07:09.400 --> 07:15.240]  it affects durango residents and this is going down now not only from durango colorado but it is
[07:15.240 --> 07:20.760]  now going down into new mexico and headed further south they say a spill that sent one million gallons
[07:20.760 --> 07:26.200]  of wastewater from an abandoned abandoned mine into the enemas river turned the river orange
[07:26.200 --> 07:30.360]  it set off warnings thursday that contaminants threatened water quality for those downstream
[07:30.360 --> 07:35.800]  the epa agency confirmed that it triggered the spill while using heavy machinery to investigate
[07:35.800 --> 07:42.840]  pollutants at the gold king mine north of silverton one of the people there daniel silva 37 who's
[07:42.840 --> 07:47.880]  fishing near durango said it's a sad day the fish could be gone i'm safety oriented working in the
[07:47.880 --> 07:54.280]  oil fields we take measures every day to prevent leakage why didn't they if this kills the fish
[07:54.280 --> 08:01.960]  what do we do well see that's just it the epa created the spill they failed to warn the residents
[08:01.960 --> 08:07.720]  of it they failed to contain it because they're too busy trying to take down the power grid by
[08:07.720 --> 08:13.880]  executive order and by regulations that they write not laws written by congress but our agencies
[08:13.880 --> 08:19.080]  like the epa and the irs they continue to write their own laws once they're created by congress
[08:19.080 --> 08:25.800]  congress abdicates their authority to write laws to these agencies these agencies then write the law
[08:25.800 --> 08:30.200]  have their own enforcement agencies their own courts their tribunals that you're hauled before
[08:30.200 --> 08:36.520]  where you are guilty and must prove your innocence you have no uh in these regulatory disputes you
[08:36.520 --> 08:40.920]  do not have the presumption of innocence but what's the epa doing well here's another article epa
[08:40.920 --> 08:45.880]  crew accidentally accidentally turns the enemas river orange they say a federal cleanup cleanup
[08:45.880 --> 08:50.920]  crew caused a big potentially hazardous mess in colorado one person says when i first saw it i was
[08:50.920 --> 08:56.440]  speechless the river did not look real but in person it truly looks like the river has turned
[08:56.440 --> 09:01.880]  into carrot juice and in the article that we have on info wars dot com from rt it says toxic waste
[09:01.880 --> 09:07.480]  including arsenic and lead which seeped into a river in southwest colorado has now crossed the
[09:07.480 --> 09:13.560]  state border into new mexico more than 550 gallons per minute are entering the water flow system
[09:13.560 --> 09:19.720]  according to the epa which caused the spill they say aside from lead and arsenic federal
[09:19.720 --> 09:26.840]  officials say the spill also contains cadmium aluminum copper and calcium they say high levels
[09:26.840 --> 09:32.840]  of arsenic can cause blindness paralysis and cancer while lead poisoning can create muscle
[09:32.840 --> 09:38.920]  and vision problems and adults and can be fatal for children they say the sediment the metals
[09:38.920 --> 09:43.720]  that the sediment are going to start to settle out in the stream bottom as we have storm surges
[09:43.720 --> 09:50.040]  as we have flooding events that sediment can and likely will get kicked back up into the water
[09:50.040 --> 09:56.120]  we're going to have to do ongoing monitoring exactly this isn't something they can easily
[09:56.120 --> 09:59.880]  clean up it's going to settle down into the water whenever it gets agitated this is going
[09:59.880 --> 10:06.760]  to be a constant problem for this very large area again it was caused by the epa sloppy work
[10:06.760 --> 10:14.520]  this was a mine that was abandoned in 1923 says the epa spokesman so typical no accountability
[10:14.520 --> 10:20.840]  will anything happen to the epa people no will they lose any funding no they will likely get
[10:20.840 --> 10:24.680]  even more funding every time the federal government fails every time one of these
[10:24.680 --> 10:32.040]  agencies fails they say well if only we had had better salaries equipment more people whatever
[10:32.040 --> 10:39.080]  we need more money every time they fail that's the continuing excuse i want to turn now to look
[10:39.080 --> 10:45.080]  at the aftermath of the debate and of course really what has become the petty soap opera
[10:45.080 --> 10:54.520]  of megan kelly and donald trump what i would call as the world burns now when you last tuned in
[10:55.080 --> 11:00.840]  megan kelly glared at donald trump and accused him of demeaning women that was on thursday
[11:00.840 --> 11:07.560]  now emotional relationships are breaking up as friends are choosing sides as a nation
[11:07.560 --> 11:14.360]  focuses on the melodrama of hurt feelings stay tuned tomorrow for another episode of as the
[11:14.360 --> 11:22.360]  world burns because as the world we've got real problems here but these people have become the
[11:22.360 --> 11:27.720]  problems you know when you look at what they're doing and this really is like a soap opera
[11:27.720 --> 11:33.560]  as uh one calmness wrote at the daily dramas they say all those soap operas are melodramatic
[11:33.560 --> 11:39.400]  events they usually have the luxury of a space that makes them seem more naturalistic in other
[11:39.400 --> 11:46.600]  words they can go on and on and on and that's precisely what we're seeing with this now of
[11:46.600 --> 11:52.200]  course what everybody is making a big deal out of this weekend is the fact that as megan kelly
[11:52.200 --> 11:58.040]  came after donald trump with this vitriolic hatred in her eyes and you can really see that
[11:58.040 --> 12:03.480]  in the questioning i was really amazed when i looked at it he said well you can see what she
[12:03.480 --> 12:09.240]  was doing she had blood coming out of her eyes blood coming out of her wherever now everybody
[12:09.240 --> 12:16.920]  is saying that that was a reference to her being female demonstration really he said eyes
[12:16.920 --> 12:22.120]  are they suggesting that megan kelly is now some kind of weird genetic modification uh
[12:23.480 --> 12:29.000]  from fox's sponsors i don't know that was a that was a strange expression that he had blood
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.240]  coming out of your eyes i don't really understand what that means i maybe it's something from new
[12:33.240 --> 12:37.960]  york i don't know my wife had an expression her friends when i met her from uh from brooklyn
[12:37.960 --> 12:42.360]  from new york it was uh we're sweating bullets i never got that either i don't know maybe blood
[12:42.360 --> 12:48.280]  coming out of your eyes is something like that but seriously as donald trump says only a deviant
[12:48.280 --> 12:53.240]  would misunderstand this kelly remark and i have to agree with him on this one i think
[12:53.240 --> 12:59.640]  that what megan kelly is doing is far more demeaning to women than donald trump i think
[12:59.640 --> 13:04.440]  she's really showing that she's not ready to be in the position that she's in she's put herself
[13:04.440 --> 13:10.600]  center stage during the bait literally she was in center stage and now she is still in center stage
[13:10.600 --> 13:16.680]  this is about her hurt feelings the question was about her hurt feelings look donald trump
[13:16.680 --> 13:21.560]  calls everybody he doesn't like fat stupid slobs not just women he's equal opportunity that's the
[13:21.560 --> 13:27.800]  way the guy rolls okay he insults everybody like that this isn't something that was targeted at women
[13:27.800 --> 13:31.960]  and as many people went back and talked to the lady that she said well it was it was worse than
[13:31.960 --> 13:36.920]  that you said you'd like to see so and so on her knees as part of the tv reality show that you had
[13:36.920 --> 13:41.720]  had and the lady that that remark was made about says she didn't even remember that that he had
[13:41.720 --> 13:46.840]  always acted as a gentleman there was never anything demeaning about it megan kelly was
[13:46.840 --> 13:52.440]  putting this feminist chip on her shoulder she's making it all about her she looks petty she looks
[13:52.440 --> 13:57.400]  vindictive she looks like somebody that doesn't deserve to have the job but is there because
[13:57.400 --> 14:01.640]  of the way she looks because she's playing identity politics i've thought that for a very
[14:01.640 --> 14:05.240]  long time i mean really when you go back and you look at some of the things that she said
[14:05.240 --> 14:10.440]  on the war on christmas yeah we all know that santa claus is white or even worse when you look at
[14:10.440 --> 14:16.840]  the things that she did in pushing mandatory vaccines without informed consent saying is it
[14:16.840 --> 14:21.880]  big brother yeah of course it's big brother sometimes you need big brother we've seen that
[14:21.880 --> 14:28.520]  happen before as well we also saw eric bawling with fox news and the aftermath of the shootings
[14:28.520 --> 14:35.000]  in france crying like a baby practically that we need to over militarize the police that many people
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.800]  are saying that the police aren't militarized enough we need to over militarize the police
[14:39.800 --> 14:46.200]  that's what we're seeing from fox news now one of the things that they came after and i think it's
[14:46.200 --> 14:52.520]  a legitimate criticism of donald trump was his connection in terms of supporting the clintons
[14:52.520 --> 14:59.080]  with money and if you want to know who supports the clintons with money it is not just donald trump
[14:59.080 --> 15:05.480]  there's a lot of people in the mainstream republican party especially mainstream republican media
[15:05.480 --> 15:11.800]  like fox news take a look at this article fox news trying to take out trump for the gop establishment
[15:11.800 --> 15:17.240]  this was on cnn's out front brightbart news editor said the very first prime time debate was quote a
[15:17.240 --> 15:23.720]  great debate between fox news anchors and between donald trump with establishment fox trying to take
[15:23.720 --> 15:29.160]  out the businessman and the gop frontrunner he also said that polster frank lunges declaration
[15:29.160 --> 15:33.160]  that the prime time debate was quote the destruction of a presidential campaign for trump
[15:33.160 --> 15:38.280]  is quote wishful thinking so we saw last night's debate which is a great debate it was a great
[15:38.280 --> 15:43.880]  debate between the fox news anchors and between donald trump and we're going to talk about that
[15:43.880 --> 15:48.520]  in more detail because as many of you who've watched this program know i'm not a fan of donald trump
[15:48.520 --> 15:53.560]  but i'm also not a fan of the trivial nature in which these debates are being held stay with

[20:47.640 --> 20:54.840]  not your host on this sunday august 9th 2015 as we were talking about what people have been calling
[20:54.840 --> 21:00.120]  bloodgate the back and forth between meghan kelly and donald trump the comments that he made this
[21:00.120 --> 21:07.560]  weekend about how she had acted at the debate i think it's really not so much that as it is a
[21:07.560 --> 21:12.680]  fox hunt this is what many people were saying and this is really what donald trump was reacting to
[21:12.680 --> 21:16.920]  they say fox news trying to take out trump for the gop establishment just before the break i
[21:16.920 --> 21:22.360]  read the comments from breitbart news editor-in-chief he said it was a great debate between fox news
[21:22.360 --> 21:27.800]  anchors and between donald trump he said there was also i enjoyed the chris christy ran paul
[21:27.800 --> 21:34.040]  spat that was good too but for the most part what we saw was that fox was on a mission a mission to
[21:34.040 --> 21:41.320]  take out donald trump well fox has got a lot of missions actually fox is on a mission to push the
[21:41.320 --> 21:48.120]  militarized police state the police industrial surveillance complex if you want to call it that
[21:48.760 --> 21:55.320]  what used to be just pushing wars is now pushing the war on drugs and terror as a war against
[21:55.320 --> 22:00.760]  american citizens you know when i look at this fox debate it really started out with a pledge
[22:00.760 --> 22:06.200]  didn't it isn't it interesting that it wasn't a pledge to obey the constitution it wasn't
[22:06.200 --> 22:13.400]  will you take a pledge to restore the rule of law to restore the constitution no it was a pledge
[22:13.400 --> 22:19.080]  to the party to this artificial construct and quite frankly i could care less about the gop
[22:19.640 --> 22:23.960]  i could care less about the democrat party partisan politics is one of the things that's
[22:23.960 --> 22:29.000]  really wrong with this country the founders despised partisan politics they thought it
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.280]  would be the ruin of the country and it is one of the things that is ruining this country
[22:33.320 --> 22:38.840]  who cares about a loyalty oath to the gop this is the same gop this run by john bainer and mitch
[22:38.840 --> 22:44.360]  mcconnell those guys could care less about the people who elected them they could care less
[22:44.360 --> 22:49.800]  about the promises that they made when you do have congressmen who do care about the promises
[22:49.800 --> 22:54.760]  that they made to voters and try to stand behind them they're punished by the leadership and that's
[22:54.760 --> 23:01.480]  why there's a movement right now within the gop to try to take down john bainer at first they
[23:01.480 --> 23:06.600]  just laughed it off they said well we're going to pull this up to a vote but maybe we should check
[23:06.600 --> 23:13.640]  first when they checked they found out that they were so close they were afraid to call the vote
[23:13.640 --> 23:17.800]  so they're going to wait until the five week recess and you can imagine there's going to be
[23:17.800 --> 23:23.640]  a lot of lobbying going on with that so but let's get back to the debate i want to run the clip
[23:23.640 --> 23:28.360]  where they talk about the dark act where they asked for fox news asked the candidates what
[23:28.360 --> 23:35.880]  they thought about this monsanto act where they're not going to allow the accurate labeling
[23:35.880 --> 23:40.200]  of what is in your food they're going to shut it down at the federal level because they're
[23:40.200 --> 23:45.800]  afraid about all these referenda that they've had at local and state levels where they've lost a lot
[23:45.800 --> 23:49.960]  of these so they want to shut it down at the national level let's play that clip oh that's
[23:49.960 --> 23:53.960]  right we don't have that clip sorry the guys back there scream one sorry guys i didn't mean to do
[23:53.960 --> 23:58.360]  that to you i know we don't have that clip let's play the clip on the questions about police brutality
[23:58.360 --> 24:02.120]  and the militarization of the police oh that's right we don't have that clip either those questions
[24:02.120 --> 24:07.800]  weren't asked nor were the questions asked about the war on drugs has been failing for 44 years or
[24:07.800 --> 24:11.960]  ruled by executive order they did have a little bit of that in the junior varsity debate they asked
[24:11.960 --> 24:18.920]  the candidates there they said what would you do with obama's executive orders well on day one
[24:19.480 --> 24:25.080]  every single one of them in the jv debate said on day one i would repeal all of barack obama's
[24:25.080 --> 24:31.560]  executive orders what was left unsaid was that they would not repeal george w bush's executive
[24:31.560 --> 24:37.000]  orders or bill clinton's executive orders or george h w bush's executive orders no they're
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.640]  just fine with those it's only barack obama let me tell you something they're not going to repeal
[24:43.640 --> 24:48.600]  anybody's executive orders we haven't seen any president do that we have an out of control
[24:48.600 --> 24:54.600]  presidency we have an out of control bureaucracy the presidency is it now stands as something that's
[24:54.600 --> 24:59.240]  not manageable for any individual because this is not the institution that was designed by the
[24:59.240 --> 25:05.800]  founders of this country it's not the institution that was defined in the constitution why don't
[25:05.800 --> 25:09.640]  they ask them some questions about the revival of the cold war bringing us to the brink of world
[25:09.640 --> 25:12.360]  war three why don't they ask some questions about the federal reserve why don't they ask
[25:12.360 --> 25:17.160]  them questions about the trans pacific the transatlantic partnerships that are being negotiated
[25:17.160 --> 25:23.240]  in secret that have been fast tracked by the congress many of the people who are running for
[25:23.240 --> 25:29.720]  president voted to fast track this they don't ask them about the new pre-crime push they don't
[25:29.720 --> 25:34.760]  ask them about asset confiscation without trial they don't ask them about indefinite detention
[25:34.760 --> 25:40.920]  by the military without trial none of these questions are being asked none of the questions
[25:40.920 --> 25:47.000]  that are destroying america that are we making us into an authoritarian totalitarian society
[25:47.000 --> 25:52.120]  no questions about that no questions about the fundamental things that are destroying us economically
[25:52.840 --> 25:57.960]  they don't ask them questions about the problems of america to see if they have any solutions
[25:57.960 --> 26:04.360]  because fox news and the rest of the media like most of those politicians on the stage
[26:04.360 --> 26:09.880]  are the problem of america they represent the biggest problem that we have in america
[26:11.320 --> 26:15.480]  absolutely totally devoid of any real discussion and the media for the most part is not even
[26:15.480 --> 26:21.560]  talking about it the real exception to all of this of course is ran paul and they brought
[26:21.560 --> 26:25.880]  chris christie and i don't believe the guy even qualified to get into the debate so you can play
[26:25.880 --> 26:31.240]  games with polls you can make polls say anything you want i remember they kept gary johnson two
[26:31.240 --> 26:36.440]  term popular republican governor of a democrat state they kept him out of the debates by not
[26:36.440 --> 26:40.120]  including him in the polls they said well you have to poll to a certain level but they didn't
[26:40.120 --> 26:46.280]  even put his name in the poll they kept ron paul out of the debates many times so they can play
[26:46.280 --> 26:52.040]  these games they can include who they want exclude who they wish to keep out i believe they kept they
[26:52.040 --> 26:58.200]  put chris christie in as a bulldog to attack ron paul to shut down any discussion of some of the
[26:58.200 --> 27:04.360]  important issues of civil liberties that we face because ran paul is one of the few candidate is
[27:04.360 --> 27:11.000]  is the is the only candidate that i know of that actually has talked about the police state police
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.840]  brutality that's out of control the massive surveillance state none of the others are talking
[27:14.840 --> 27:20.040]  about that whatsoever but look at chris christie international business times and this was the day
[27:20.040 --> 27:24.840]  before the debate they said chris christie is actually the day of the debate this was august
[27:24.840 --> 27:30.920]  six so this is thursday chris christie's lowest moments only 30 hold a favorable opinion of the
[27:30.920 --> 27:37.000]  new jersey governor a new poll found on thursday the day of the debate they said only 30 of registered
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.400]  voters in new jersey had a favorable opinion of chris christie asked to justify their negative
[27:41.400 --> 27:46.920]  assessments 18 cited his character they didn't like him because of his character they didn't
[27:46.920 --> 27:52.600]  like him because of his attitude they didn't like him because the image as reasons for unfavorable
[27:52.600 --> 28:01.560]  feelings another 10% used terms like untrustworthy deceitful and liar to describe chris christie
[28:01.560 --> 28:06.920]  you could put me in that group chris christie has not experienced any kind of 2016 announcement
[28:06.920 --> 28:11.240]  bump in the ratings from voters back home in fact quite the opposite typically you see that
[28:11.240 --> 28:16.200]  usually when somebody is a a sitting governor and they say they're going to run for president
[28:16.200 --> 28:22.600]  usually they get a bump in popularity instead chris christie went exactly the opposite way
[28:23.720 --> 28:29.240]  now i want to play the uh guys if you can queue up that uh that clip between chris christie and
[28:29.240 --> 28:36.760]  ran paul i'd like to play that when we get back and i want to talk about something that chris
[28:36.760 --> 28:41.560]  christie said remember they said that he was unpopular because he was untrustworthy deceitful
[28:41.560 --> 28:46.520]  and a liar 10% of people use those terms to describe chris christie 10% of the people that
[28:46.520 --> 28:52.520]  they asked in new jersey where he's governor we're going to show you how deceitful and what a liar
[28:52.520 --> 28:57.720]  he is in the lies that he had going back and forth with ran paul in the debate the other night when

[34:50.360 --> 34:56.280]  specials getting back to what chris christie said as i was mentioning before we went to the break
[34:56.920 --> 35:03.320]  on the day of the debate they did a poll and found that he was at the lowest he has been got no bump
[35:03.320 --> 35:08.840]  for running for president as most candidates do when they're sitting governors 10 percent of the
[35:08.840 --> 35:15.320]  people that did not like him said use the terms to describe him as untrustworthy deceitful and a
[35:15.320 --> 35:21.480]  liar only 30 percent held a favorable opinion of new jersey governor chris christie and let me tell
[35:21.480 --> 35:26.600]  you a good example of this was the debate the other night there's a back and forth and we're
[35:26.600 --> 35:29.960]  going to play that for you as to whether or not we should have dragnet surveillance whether or
[35:29.960 --> 35:35.560]  not we should give carte blanche to the police state to spy on everyone all the time to keep us
[35:35.560 --> 35:39.480]  safe should we give up all of our liberties for security chris christie is on one side of that
[35:40.040 --> 35:44.840]  adamantly says yes we need to do more than the government is doing far more than the government
[35:44.840 --> 35:51.000]  has been doing and of course he was working with the government in the early part of the patriot
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.200]  act to do just that working with the faiza court to do just that ran paul is on the other side of
[35:56.200 --> 36:01.880]  that issue so they were going back and forth and at one point ran paul talked about how chris christie
[36:01.880 --> 36:07.160]  had hugged obama after sandy hook and then chris christie comes back and says well let me tell you
[36:07.160 --> 36:14.280]  about the people that i hugged after 9 11 because i was appointed as someone to track down these
[36:14.280 --> 36:19.720]  terrorists after 9 11 now we're going to play that for you and you're going to hear him say twice
[36:19.720 --> 36:26.600]  how he was nominated on september 10th and september 11th was the very first day that he took
[36:26.600 --> 36:33.000]  office actually that's another chris christie delay international business times pointed out
[36:33.000 --> 36:39.320]  that when he said i was appointed u.s attorney on september 10th 2001 i spent the next seven years
[36:39.320 --> 36:45.080]  of my career fighting terrorism putting terrorists in jail yeah i guess he was the guy who did he
[36:45.080 --> 36:51.800]  catch all those terrorists who did 9 11 maybe he was the guy that found the passport that floated down
[36:51.800 --> 36:57.320]  from the terrorists after they blew up the plane into the building that passport just magically
[36:57.320 --> 37:02.200]  floated down to the top of the heap there of all the rubble on 9 11 and somebody found it maybe that
[37:02.200 --> 37:07.800]  was chris christie maybe that was his contribution to put those terrorists in jail he says we have
[37:07.800 --> 37:12.200]  to give more tools to our folks in order to be able to do that then we have to trust those people
[37:13.080 --> 37:18.760]  yeah we can trust chris christie can't we we can trust him to lie we can trust james clapper to lie
[37:18.760 --> 37:25.240]  we've caught him in lies we can trust michael hayden to lie we can trust carlie fiorina to lie
[37:25.240 --> 37:29.720]  because she's been working the only job she's had in government is to work with michael hayden
[37:29.720 --> 37:34.280]  to cover up their dragnet spying but we're supposed to trust her now here's the reality
[37:34.280 --> 37:41.080]  he was not appointed on september 10th 2001 the day before september 11th he didn't take office
[37:41.080 --> 37:49.320]  on september 11th here's the press release from the office of press secretary for george w bush
[37:49.320 --> 37:55.480]  this was done on december the 7th two months later said president george w bush today announces
[37:55.480 --> 38:01.400]  intention to nominate three individuals and one of those was chris christie so the announcement
[38:01.400 --> 38:11.320]  was december 7th 2001 he was nominated by the president two months after chris christie is saying
[38:12.040 --> 38:17.720]  and then they say that he was named and this is on chris christie's own site his own bio at the
[38:17.720 --> 38:21.720]  state of new jersey governor chris christie if you look down and look at this chris christie
[38:21.720 --> 38:28.600]  was named u.s attorney for the district of new jersey in 2002 not september 10th not september
[38:28.600 --> 38:37.160]  11th 2001 he was lying about that he was lying about that to wrap himself in the clothing of
[38:37.800 --> 38:44.360]  emotionalism that they've used to push the police state on us this article from the nation says
[38:44.360 --> 38:51.240]  ran paul's eye roll marked the end of the 9 11 era they say and here's a quote from chris christie
[38:51.240 --> 38:56.440]  the hugs that i remember are the hugs that i gave to the families who lost their people on september
[38:56.440 --> 39:02.040]  11th and the nation says senator ran paul that moment engaged with christie on a debate about
[39:02.040 --> 39:07.080]  mass surveillance and then gave what will unilaterally dub as the most monumental eye roll in
[39:07.080 --> 39:12.520]  presidential debate history paul's smirking get a load of this guy this missile of christie's
[39:12.520 --> 39:19.080]  ghoulish grandstanding is a nice final line for an important political chapter it's the moment we
[39:19.080 --> 39:25.880]  knew for sure that september 11th had lost its currency even in republican politics paul wasn't
[39:25.880 --> 39:30.680]  immediately booed nor was he shredded by the moderators nor was he condemned as a terrorist
[39:30.680 --> 39:35.000]  sympathizer or worse is certainly would have been the case during the bush years in fact
[39:35.000 --> 39:41.160]  in the drudge reports instant reaction online poll paul finished fifth with christie dead last but
[39:41.160 --> 39:45.880]  of course that's not what we're being told by fox news that's not what we're being told by
[39:45.880 --> 39:52.760]  msnbc they're telling us that paul just he came across as just too mean spirited we need to get
[39:52.760 --> 39:57.640]  in the face of people who are destroying our country who are taking our civil liberties
[39:57.640 --> 40:03.080]  and not giving us anything in return this is a false promise of security going back to the
[40:03.080 --> 40:08.440]  nation they say the eye roll moment was a long time coming it was foreshadowed in 2008 by the
[40:08.440 --> 40:15.960]  spectacular failure rudy juliani's noun and verb 911 he used it both as a noun and as a verb
[40:15.960 --> 40:20.680]  in his presidential campaign they say in thursday night proved that september 11th has finally been
[40:20.680 --> 40:26.440]  stripped of its potency as an animating event even for republican voters well that's both good
[40:26.440 --> 40:33.960]  and bad it's good that people are finally waking up to that not that they are indifferent to the
[40:33.960 --> 40:40.360]  suffering of the people who died on 911 but they know that it was that the government everything
[40:40.360 --> 40:46.520]  the government has done before and since to spy on us was absolutely irrelevant to that even if
[40:46.520 --> 40:52.520]  they don't believe that it was a false flag event they understand that this has nothing to do with
[40:52.520 --> 40:56.840]  protecting us it's simply taking our liberties as benjamin franklin said if you'll give up your
[40:56.840 --> 41:01.960]  liberty for security you don't deserve either one we know throughout history that when you give up
[41:01.960 --> 41:07.800]  your liberty you don't get security you become a slave when you give up your liberty that's what
[41:07.800 --> 41:14.920]  you become you were you live in a maximum security state that's another name for a prison slaves
[41:14.920 --> 41:21.960]  never have security when you give up your individual rights you become a slave get that
[41:21.960 --> 41:25.400]  through your head you need to understand that hopefully people are starting to understand that
[41:25.400 --> 41:30.920]  but of course if it's losing its currency that is also a dangerous moment before us because
[41:30.920 --> 41:38.120]  this government may feel like it needs to pull another 911 in order to justify more encroachments
[41:38.120 --> 41:41.960]  to scare us into giving up our liberties let's play some of that back and forth debate
[41:41.960 --> 41:50.360]  on the stage who's actually filed applications under the patriot act who have gone before the
[41:50.360 --> 41:55.480]  federal uh the christ christie bragging about how he's violated people's liberties and investigated
[41:55.480 --> 42:00.440]  and jailed terrorists in this country after september 11th i was appointed u.s attorney by
[42:00.440 --> 42:06.600]  president bush on september 10th 2001 and the world changed enormously the next day there's a lie
[42:06.600 --> 42:12.040]  happened in my state this is not theoretical to me i was alive for him we lost friends of ours in
[42:12.040 --> 42:15.880]  the trade center that day my own wife was two blocks from the trade center that day at her
[42:15.880 --> 42:21.320]  office having gone through it that morning when you actually have to be responsible for doing this
[42:21.320 --> 42:26.920]  you can do it and we did it for seven years in my office respecting civil liberties and protecting
[42:26.920 --> 42:32.200]  the homeland and i will make no apologies ever for protecting the lives and the safety of the
[42:32.200 --> 42:37.720]  american people we have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that not fewer and then
[42:37.720 --> 42:42.600]  trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way as there you go that is exactly what
[42:42.600 --> 42:48.120]  that lying authoritarian guy who accuses ram paul who stands up for the bill of rights he says
[42:48.120 --> 42:52.920]  when you say that you're just full of hot air no he's the one who is full of hot air when he takes

[47:29.160 --> 47:35.880]  we were just telling you about the outright lies of chris christie posturing wrapping
[47:35.880 --> 47:42.760]  himself in the victims of 9 11 as we've seen rudy juliani and many others in the gop using that
[47:42.760 --> 47:48.200]  to create an authoritarian totalitarian police state destroying the rule of law destroying
[47:48.200 --> 47:54.120]  our civil liberties shredding the constitution and the bill of rights we've had enough the nation
[47:54.120 --> 48:01.480]  said this perhaps was the first time that we've seen that this doesn't work they said when ran
[48:01.480 --> 48:07.480]  paul rolled his eyes at the narrative that was laid out there by chris christie wrapping himself
[48:07.480 --> 48:13.320]  justifying all these encroachments on individual liberties justifying it as protecting us from
[48:13.320 --> 48:20.120]  9 11 when ran paul rolled his eyes perhaps that was the beginning of showing that this is over
[48:20.120 --> 48:24.920]  in terms of being able to sell tyranny using 9 11 to sell tyranny we're going to go back and we're
[48:24.920 --> 48:30.360]  going to give you ran paul's response to that and then ben carson's response to this back and forth
[48:30.360 --> 48:34.680]  exchange between ran paul and chris christie before we get back to that just want to let you
[48:34.680 --> 48:40.520]  know that the free shipping that we extended for another now it's 10 days past the end of july we
[48:40.520 --> 48:45.080]  had free shipping through july we didn't really push it that much towards the end of july as we
[48:45.080 --> 48:48.840]  started telling people it's approaching towards the end people started taking advantage of it so
[48:49.480 --> 48:54.760]  with it being at this time of year when many people are on vacation and not able to take
[48:54.760 --> 48:59.480]  advantage of that we decided we'd extend that for another uh week actually to 10 days but it will
[48:59.480 --> 49:04.280]  end tonight and that's everything at the store at info wars life dot com free shipping including
[49:04.280 --> 49:09.320]  things like supermail vitality which has been out of stock for several weeks is now back in stock
[49:09.320 --> 49:14.680]  but we do have a couple of specials and those will also be ending tonight survival shield x2 nascent
[49:14.680 --> 49:20.360]  iodine 30 off we put that on special on friday and we've now extended that till uh tonight it will
[49:20.360 --> 49:26.360]  end tonight as well as the buy two silver bullet get two free that will also end tonight so that's
[49:26.360 --> 49:32.680]  50 off of silver bullet 30 off of survival shield x2 and free shipping on everything in the store
[49:32.680 --> 49:39.560]  that all ends tonight now getting back to the the clip we won't play the chris christy uh for you
[49:39.560 --> 49:44.360]  again but basically what he said was he was appointed u.s attorney on september 10th 2001
[49:44.360 --> 49:48.120]  and i spent the next seven years of my career fighting terrorism and putting terrorists in
[49:48.120 --> 49:53.800]  jail well he didn't support that i don't know how many terrorists he put in jail i don't recall any
[49:53.800 --> 50:00.200]  of uh that he's put into jail but we do know because we can look at the documents we do know
[50:00.200 --> 50:07.000]  that he was not nominated until two months later not on september 10th not on september 11th but on
[50:07.000 --> 50:12.840]  december the 7th 2001 george bush had we have the press release that we're showing you on the screen
[50:13.400 --> 50:20.360]  it shows that he uh nominated him for the position of u.s attorney for the district of new jersey
[50:20.360 --> 50:25.080]  and then on christy's own website on the state of new jersey it says that he became
[50:25.080 --> 50:29.960]  a u.s attorney for the district of new jersey in 2002 so he was nominated in december and
[50:29.960 --> 50:35.560]  then didn't take that office until sometime in 2002 but of course he pretends that he was there
[50:35.560 --> 50:42.040]  on ground zero hugging people and arresting terrorists absolute total nonsense here's the
[50:42.040 --> 50:55.640]  way ran paul responded to that bull i want to collect more records from terrorists but less
[50:55.640 --> 51:02.840]  records from innocent americans the fourth amendment was what we fought the revolution
[51:02.840 --> 51:09.320]  over john adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence and i'm proud of standing
[51:09.320 --> 51:14.760]  for the bill of rights and i will continue to stand for the bill of rights and megan
[51:15.640 --> 51:21.720]  megan that's a that you know that's a completely ridiculous answer i want to collect more records
[51:21.720 --> 51:27.080]  from terrorists but less records from other people how are you supposed to know megan pause that pause
[51:27.080 --> 51:33.400]  that pause that how are you supposed to know who's a terrorist because in christ christy's mind
[51:33.400 --> 51:39.960]  every american is a terrorist you're all guilty unless he spies on you and vets you and determines
[51:39.960 --> 51:44.280]  that you're innocent how you're supposed to know who's a terrorist and who isn't unless you do
[51:44.280 --> 51:50.520]  dragnet surveillance of the american people that's what christ christy is telling us pull it up again
[51:50.520 --> 51:55.240]  because he goes on to say when you talk about the constitution bill of rights you're just blowing
[51:55.240 --> 52:02.040]  hot air because that's what he blows when he talks about the rule of law this the shill of a lawyer
[52:02.040 --> 52:06.360]  go ahead play that are you supposed to use the form now i'll tell you how you get a warrant let me
[52:06.360 --> 52:10.360]  tell you so that you don't get a warrant when you and you know senator go ahead governor christy make
[52:10.360 --> 52:14.520]  your point listen senator you know when you're sitting in a subcommittee just blowing hot air
[52:14.520 --> 52:19.240]  about this you can say things like that when you're responsible for protecting the lives of the america
[52:19.240 --> 52:22.040]  you can talk about getting a warrant according to the fourth amendment when you're just sitting in
[52:22.040 --> 52:26.200]  the committee is to make sure that you use the system the way it's supposed to work here's the
[52:26.200 --> 52:31.320]  problem governor you fundamentally misunderstand the bill of rights no he despises it every time you
[52:31.320 --> 52:38.920]  did a case you got a warrant from a judge i'm talking about searches without warrants indistriminately
[52:38.920 --> 52:44.280]  of all americans records and that's what i thought to end i don't trust president obama with our
[52:44.280 --> 52:54.280]  records i know you gave him a big hug and if you want to give him a big hug again go ahead and you
[52:54.280 --> 53:00.680]  know you know senator paul senator paul you know the hugs that i remember are the hugs that i gave
[53:00.680 --> 53:05.560]  to the families who lost their people on september 11th those are the hugs i remember and those had
[53:05.560 --> 53:10.840]  nothing to do and those had nothing to do with politics unlike what you're doing by cutting
[53:10.840 --> 53:14.920]  speeches on the floor of the senate than putting them on the internet within a half an hour to raise
[53:14.920 --> 53:21.000]  money for your campaign and while still putting our country at risk he's putting our country at risk
[53:21.000 --> 53:27.480]  no it is chris christy who's putting our country at risk because we don't have a country if we give
[53:27.480 --> 53:32.840]  all power to the government and we have no individual liberties but of course ben carson
[53:32.840 --> 53:38.200]  didn't see it that way he went on the hu hu it program and of course hu hu it is a hardcore
[53:39.080 --> 53:46.840]  neocon conservative type who wants to prosecute a war of terror against the american people he
[53:46.840 --> 53:51.000]  wants to prosecute a war of drugs against the american people just like everybody else on that
[53:51.000 --> 53:57.480]  stage except for rand paul never saw any civil liberty that he thought that americans should have
[53:58.120 --> 54:04.280]  and so he gets ben carson on and kind of asks him about the debate let's play that clip but what
[54:04.280 --> 54:10.680]  was the most surprising thing to you as a first timer on a debate stage you hear it from tonight's
[54:10.680 --> 54:16.440]  proceedings here's ben carson well i didn't i didn't expect to see some of the people go after
[54:16.440 --> 54:24.040]  each other so vigorously i i really expected much more civility than that but i guess that's
[54:24.040 --> 54:30.200]  the nature of the beast i'm i'm not likely to engage in such activities who do you remember
[54:30.200 --> 54:40.280]  as being the least civil on the stage probably ran paul and and towards towards chris christy
[54:40.280 --> 54:45.400]  is at the exchange you're referencing yeah yeah yeah there we go well let me let me remind these
[54:45.400 --> 54:51.880]  two guys let me remind these two guys of what goldwater said once upon a time conservatism
[54:51.880 --> 54:57.320]  meant people who respected the constitution who respected individual liberty that meaning has
[54:57.320 --> 55:03.080]  changed just like the meaning of the word liberal has changed over the decades what goldwater said
[55:03.080 --> 55:09.800]  of course the famous quote extremism in defense of liberty is no vice we don't have to apologize
[55:09.800 --> 55:16.360]  for that ben carson extremism in defense of liberty is no vice moderation in pursuit of
[55:16.360 --> 55:23.320]  justice is no virtue either i would suggest that what ben carson should do is he should spend some
[55:23.320 --> 55:28.680]  time educating himself on the constitution on the bill of rights on how our government works
[55:28.680 --> 55:34.840]  maybe he could start with some uh schoolhouse videos or something elementary like that would he
[55:34.840 --> 55:41.720]  operate on somebody without understanding human anatomy or are you going to start if you want to
[55:41.720 --> 55:46.360]  be president maybe you ought to go back to the founding documents that all of these people who
[55:46.360 --> 55:51.240]  take office whether it's president or somebody at a lower office they all swear allegiance to
[55:51.240 --> 55:57.720]  the constitution ben carson why don't you read the constitution as if you're reading anatomy
[55:57.720 --> 56:03.960]  before you go into surgery okay i don't want somebody elected president doing surgery on
[56:03.960 --> 56:08.680]  our constitution and on our country because we've had too much of that people who don't know
[56:08.680 --> 56:14.040]  and who don't care who have a cavalier attitude can you imagine somebody going in for brain surgery
[56:14.040 --> 56:18.840]  somebody a brain surgeon and he has absolute cavalier attitude yeah well you know i have
[56:18.840 --> 56:23.480]  i've kind of seen pictures of the brain or whatever you know i'm kind of i can't really get too excited
[56:23.480 --> 56:28.440]  about it but uh that's exactly what we have here somebody who wants to be president but he can't
[56:28.440 --> 56:32.760]  be bothered to read or understand the constitution this is somebody who said about the right to keep
[56:32.760 --> 56:38.040]  him bare arms that well yeah it's something that i can understand people need to have guns out in
[56:38.040 --> 56:44.520]  rural areas but people in the cities no it just creates problem really you haven't even
[56:44.520 --> 56:49.880]  bothered to understand what's behind that you have no concept of individual liberty this is
[56:49.880 --> 56:55.880]  somebody who as a doctor said that we ought to take away people's informed consent for vaccines
[56:55.880 --> 57:04.280]  he even flunks medical ethics ben karsten even flunks medical ethics let alone the ideals of
[57:04.280 --> 57:09.480]  individual liberty that we have in the constitution don't tell me that we need a civil candidate we
[57:09.480 --> 57:15.800]  need some candidates who understand what the issues are and i only saw one candidate on the podium
[57:15.800 --> 57:20.920]  that demonstrated that he did and that was ram paul don't talk about how he needs to be more civil
[57:20.920 --> 57:27.160]  we need to get more angry about people who are glibly denying and taking our liberties and the
[57:27.160 --> 57:36.840]  rule of law stay with us we'll be right back

[1:00:07.960 --> 1:00:15.000]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:20.760]  welcome back to the alex jones show we're going to talk a little bit more about the soap opera
[1:00:20.760 --> 1:00:26.040]  aspects of the debate as well as george bush's involvement with planned parenthood when we
[1:00:26.040 --> 1:00:29.720]  come back but this segment i want to go over some of the news that's breaking today of course we
[1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:36.280]  mentioned earlier in the show that the epa itself spilled one million dollar one million dollars one
[1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:42.840]  million gallons of toxic waste into the animus river in colorado it's now across the state border
[1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:48.120]  into new mexico 550 gallons per minute are entering the water and of course this contains
[1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:54.200]  things like cadmium aluminum copper calcium arsenic all these are things that can cause
[1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:58.760]  blindness paralysis cancer the poisoning can create muscle vision problems in adults and
[1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:05.080]  they can be fatal for children so here we go the epa which is designed to protect us is now more
[1:01:05.080 --> 1:01:13.000]  interested in shutting down coal more interested in becoming the the controller of our electricity
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:18.680]  grid than it is in terms of actually doing its mission and of course this incompetence this
[1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:25.720]  incredible incompetence will only be used to increase funding for the epa mark my words they
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:32.120]  will use it as an excuse to get more money not as an excuse for somebody to get penalized in other
[1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:38.600]  news we have a new york city bureaucrats are now firing a government worker who died of cancer
[1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:46.680]  a year ago for missing work it turns out that this this worker had missed over 17 months on the 18th
[1:01:46.680 --> 1:01:51.400]  month when he didn't show up to work they actually fired him i guess it's part of the new get tough
[1:01:51.400 --> 1:01:57.560]  austerity program that they have for new york city just like the epa maybe the epa will be better off
[1:01:57.560 --> 1:02:03.480]  if they didn't show up if they didn't dump millions of gallons of toxic waste into the rivers but
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:09.480]  in this particular case this fellow who died from cancer went a year and a half and then they
[1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:14.360]  finally noticed that he was missing and fired him things are getting really they're really
[1:02:14.360 --> 1:02:19.000]  sending a message as my son lance pointed out he says this is going to send a tough message to
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:25.080]  anybody else in new york city you miss 17 months of work in a row you're fired get out of here
[1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:29.720]  are they going to go total donald trump on them right then 17 months in your house participants
[1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:36.440]  of the conservative events in canada must now agree to a gag order isn't this very much like our
[1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:40.920]  politics are seeing this everywhere not only do we have secret treaties being done everywhere where
[1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:43.800]  our politicians are not allowed to see it where the people are not allowed to see it because you
[1:02:43.800 --> 1:02:49.560]  know you and i those of us who just happen to be american citizens we're not stakeholders in anything
[1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:53.560]  the stakeholders are the corporations who are secretly negotiating these treaties we'll take
[1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:59.800]  a look at what's going on in canada they have a conservative fundraising event they say members
[1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:03.800]  of the public who attend prime minister steven harper's campaign events are being required to
[1:03:03.800 --> 1:03:09.320]  agree to a gag order before they can walk through the door this is according to i politics they
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:13.640]  say attendance is by invitation only if you want to attend this campaign event you have to agree
[1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:20.680]  to a number of conditions including not to transmit any description of the event or any images from
[1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:24.760]  it and when people sign up for this they tell them the holder of the confirmation of the
[1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:28.840]  registration is prohibited from transmitting or aiding and transmitting any description
[1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:35.160]  account picture a reproduction of the event holder and his or her belongings may be searched upon
[1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:40.680]  entry and the holder of the tickets consents to such searches and waves any related claims that
[1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:45.480]  might arise against the conservative fund of canada the electoral district association concern in
[1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:49.640]  the facility if the holder of the ticket elects not to consent to these searches the holder of
[1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:56.200]  the ticket will be denied entry into the facility how's that for transparency over and over and
[1:03:56.200 --> 1:04:01.720]  over again not only in our country but everywhere else the government demands to operate in total
[1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:07.560]  secrecy and of course in many cases they'll say well it's for national security purposes you know
[1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:12.520]  we we don't want to risk anyone knowing who the policemen are or who the special forces are and we
[1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:17.240]  have jade helm we don't want anybody to know this or that because you know people's lives could be
[1:04:17.240 --> 1:04:26.600]  at stake this is a political party fundraiser in all these cases the government's cries for
[1:04:26.600 --> 1:04:35.000]  security are not necessary and virtually all of these cases national security has become
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:40.680]  the blanket excuse to shut down any knowledge of what these people are doing to shut down
[1:04:40.680 --> 1:04:47.560]  criminal operation meanwhile people like chris christie demand to know everything about you everything
[1:04:47.560 --> 1:04:52.760]  because if he doesn't spy on you totally then how is he supposed to know if you're not a terrorist
[1:04:52.760 --> 1:04:56.920]  the presumption of innocence and the rule of law are gone folks stay with us we'll be right back

[1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:28.040]  listening to the alex jones show
[1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:32.120]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this sunday august 9th 2015
[1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:37.320]  we're going to get back to politics in just a moment but as we were covering news in the last
[1:06:37.320 --> 1:06:40.840]  break i just want there's a couple more news items i wanted to get to that we're just kind of
[1:06:41.640 --> 1:06:47.800]  staying along on their sides of course one of these is student debt the rising cost of college
[1:06:47.800 --> 1:06:52.760]  and we're seeing the federal government now floating the idea that everybody should get a
[1:06:52.760 --> 1:07:01.240]  free college education or that college student debt should be relieved by taxpayers to the tune of
[1:07:01.240 --> 1:07:07.800]  thirty nine billion dollars or more this is what a student debt relief program would cost taxpayers
[1:07:07.800 --> 1:07:14.200]  i'm sorry but i shouldn't have to pay for other people's debt that they willingly entered into
[1:07:14.200 --> 1:07:19.000]  debt in many cases that they took on for getting some kind of a degree that had absolutely no
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:23.240]  relevance you want to go to school and you want to take some kind of a sociology degree
[1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:28.600]  or a woman's study degree or whatever fine pay for it yourself or go into debt for the rest of
[1:07:28.600 --> 1:07:35.320]  your life if you're going to pay these ridiculously expensive figures but don't ask me to pay for it
[1:07:35.320 --> 1:07:40.440]  on the other hand we see that the government that is now offering itself out there as this
[1:07:40.440 --> 1:07:47.880]  benevolent savior to these people has been incredibly rigid and unforgiving with those who
[1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:53.240]  do have student debt as i mentioned earlier in the program we've we've had situations where people
[1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:59.080]  have been swat teamed entire family swat teamed over the debt of one individual in the particular
[1:07:59.080 --> 1:08:04.200]  case i was talking about reported by the washington post this was a family drug out in the middle
[1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:08.920]  of the night swat teamed with shotguns to their heads and they were looking for the mother of
[1:08:08.920 --> 1:08:14.200]  the family who had left the family she had skipped out not only on her student loans but she skipped
[1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:18.760]  out on the family but the rest of those the family got swat teamed that's not an appropriate way to
[1:08:18.760 --> 1:08:23.960]  try to collect debt but that's the way the government does it and of course they're going to take that
[1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:29.560]  debt if they do taxpayer relief and they're going to transfer that debt to the rest of us
[1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:34.440]  and we'll get swat teamed if we don't pay for it if we don't pay our taxes or whatever but now look
[1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:39.400]  at this other aspect of it not just swat teaming people for their delinquent loans but this is
[1:08:39.400 --> 1:08:46.360]  from the ij review they say the reason doctors and nurses are losing their licenses has nothing
[1:08:46.360 --> 1:08:52.360]  to do with their job performance they say it's a group consisting of doctors teachers nurses
[1:08:52.360 --> 1:08:58.360]  engineers what do they have in common doctors teachers nurses and engineers are having their
[1:08:58.360 --> 1:09:05.800]  licenses revoked not due to malpractice not due to lawsuits but because of student debt they say
[1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:13.000]  since 2009 over 4200 tennessee residents alone this is just in the state of tennessee 4200 people
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:17.400]  have joined this group because of non-payment on their student loans reports the chattanooga
[1:09:17.400 --> 1:09:23.880]  times free press registered nurses and nurse aides are among the most likely to be affected because
[1:09:23.880 --> 1:09:28.120]  they're not making that much money many people to get a college degree without ever looking at
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:33.000]  whether or not this thing is going to pay off for them financially they go into massive amounts of
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:40.040]  debt and you cannot dispel your student loan by declaring bankruptcy and if you go in and you
[1:09:40.040 --> 1:09:44.440]  finally get a job they can take your license whether you're a licensed engineer whether
[1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:49.240]  you're a doctor whether you're a nurse they will take your license now how does that make any sense
[1:09:49.240 --> 1:09:53.000]  for the government to do that because now those people are not going to be able to pay it back
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:58.440]  it's the same thing that they're doing to the nation of Greece as an entire nation they're not
[1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:04.760]  interested in getting it back they just want to be punitive it's a very frightening scenario when
[1:10:04.760 --> 1:10:11.320]  we see the bank's doing that and i said fox because i'm pulling up this next article here
[1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:18.360]  this is an article from fox eight just a sign of the times target is going to move away from
[1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:25.000]  gender-based signs they say attention target shoppers say goodbye to girls building sets and
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:30.360]  boys betting they say they're going to start phasing out gender-based signage in some of their
[1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:35.560]  departments that's what target is going to do well that certainly should make megan kelly happy
[1:10:35.560 --> 1:10:42.040]  maybe fox news can be their next sponsor this is a fox article that goes on to say that parents
[1:10:42.040 --> 1:10:47.880]  and gender equality advocates welcomed the news really not this parent i understand that there's
[1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:52.760]  a difference between boys and girls i understand there's a difference between men and women
[1:10:52.760 --> 1:10:59.480]  i think that's a good thing i think that it's a we have a complementary relationship between
[1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:03.880]  the sexes i don't think everybody needs to be the same this is a brave new world agenda that
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:09.000]  they're pushing here this is an agenda that destroys the family this is something that's
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:14.200]  being pushed not only by target but by fox news saying that parents are welcoming this
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:20.920]  they go on to say that some people don't like this a small minority of commenters criticize
[1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:28.120]  target for their politically correct fads so most parents applauded according to fox news
[1:11:28.120 --> 1:11:32.520]  but a small minority of us don't like that let me tell you when my sons were young
[1:11:33.400 --> 1:11:39.880]  they were only a couple years old and we got a little car for them that my wife found on craigslist
[1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:45.160]  and she got a good price on it and you know has a little battery on it the kids can sit in it and
[1:11:45.160 --> 1:11:51.240]  it moves like about one mile an hour and so we got it for the two boys and she came home with it and
[1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:59.240]  i said karen that's pink boys aren't gonna want that and i had not told them anything about pink
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:04.760]  being a girl saying or whatever it was basically a jeep but it was colored pink and the boys walked
[1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:09.480]  out and they had a fit i'm not getting in that thing i mean they understood that there was a
[1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:17.880]  difference they instinctively wanted to pick up sticks and use them as guns my daughter instinctively
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:23.320]  has never done that okay she's always wanted to cuddle and nurture things there's a difference
[1:12:23.320 --> 1:12:27.400]  between men and women you can make everybody the same but you're going to have to force the issue
[1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:33.000]  and the only reason you would do that is because you want to create a brave new world society
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:38.520]  destroying the family this is an old old technique that authoritarians have always used it goes all
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:42.600]  the way back to playtoe's time we've talked about this many times in playtoe's republic
[1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:48.760]  he wanted to have a situation where nobody had any loyalty to any institution other than the state
[1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:55.160]  they want to replace the family they want to replace god in playtoe's republic no one even knew
[1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:59.880]  who their parents were he wanted to have a promiscuous society where everybody was intermixing
[1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:05.640]  all the time nobody knew who the parent of their child was and they were separated from the mother
[1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:10.520]  at birth so they didn't know who the mother was so their only loyalty would be to the state
[1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:16.520]  and now we have pushed the age that we turn our children over to the government earlier
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:20.680]  and earlier and earlier and it still isn't enough for them now they're coming for us
[1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:26.520]  in other ways and just understand this is coming from fox fox news the place where conservatives
[1:13:26.520 --> 1:13:31.560]  go to get their news the place that if you look at their programming has some of the most gender
[1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:37.480]  bending anti-family pushing programs they've had that for decades but of course that's where we go
[1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:43.560]  to get our news and they say fox eight says the change is a step towards removing gender
[1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:48.440]  limitations in childhood but when one of the world's largest retailers does this ripple effect
[1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:54.360]  will be significant there we go isn't that great let's get back to the politics of what's going
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:58.680]  on here there's an article about google's search engine algorithm they say that it could steal
[1:13:58.680 --> 1:14:02.840]  the presidency they say imagine this is from wired magazine imagine an election a close one
[1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:07.320]  you're undecided so you type in the name of one of the candidates under your search engine of choice
[1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:11.560]  and they say let's not be coy here it's going to be google for the most part great now you're an
[1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:19.240]  informed voter right no a study published this week says that the order of the results and the
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:23.800]  ranking of positive or negative stories on the screen can have an enormous influence on the
[1:14:23.800 --> 1:14:28.520]  way that you vote they say the if the election is close enough the effect could be profound enough
[1:14:28.520 --> 1:14:35.640]  to change the outcome you think of course it can of course they can skew the way that you think
[1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:41.000]  by putting positive articles of the top or negative articles of the top for a particular candidate
[1:14:41.800 --> 1:14:47.880]  that's precisely what fox news is doing in this debate they decided they wanted to come for
[1:14:47.880 --> 1:14:52.920]  donald trump they decided they wanted to come for rand paul and they made no bones about it and
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:57.720]  they've still been doing it and i i've mentioned over and over again how i'm not a fan of donald
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:06.040]  trump because of his business practices but i am also an even less of a fan of them of the media
[1:15:06.040 --> 1:15:11.720]  being used to influence the public that way they say you we report you decide no they're telling you
[1:15:11.720 --> 1:15:17.640]  what to decide the way they use frank luntz to manipulate public opinion people are sitting
[1:15:17.640 --> 1:15:21.720]  there watching this he says look i have this scientific reaction from my study group and
[1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:25.800]  they liked this part and they didn't like this part it's like where did this guy get his study group
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:30.680]  anybody ever asked that question does anybody ever question what fox news is saying of course
[1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:35.000]  so people are going to look at this they're going to have the playback that is carefully
[1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:41.240]  collected and carefully skewed to one candidate or the other they can declare over and over again
[1:15:41.240 --> 1:15:47.800]  that carlie fiorino won why would they do that there's somebody that has been deeply involved
[1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:52.200]  with the cia in the surveillance state the only government experience she's had is that and she
[1:15:52.200 --> 1:15:57.880]  hasn't had that much corporate experience either six years as a failed ceo 50 drop in stock will

[1:21:55.240 --> 1:22:01.000]  getting back to what we were talking about in terms of the debate well actually before we do that
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:06.520]  let me let me tell you about this article that's up on info wars.com by steve watson latest unedited
[1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:14.360]  planned parenthood video confirms that aborted babies are being sold to create super mice now
[1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:20.120]  again this is a kind of transgenetic modification combining elements of one species to the other
[1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:26.200]  we don't like to see that in our food and i certainly don't like to see that in our animals
[1:22:26.200 --> 1:22:31.560]  aborting and using children for this kind of frankincense listen to this the brains of aborted
[1:22:31.560 --> 1:22:38.680]  babies are being transplanted into mice and labs now this is taken from the scientist and the journal
[1:22:38.680 --> 1:22:44.280]  of neuroscience they're indicating that they say essentially the fetus brains are minced that's the
[1:22:44.280 --> 1:22:49.720]  actual words used in the paper published in the journal of neuroscience and the glial cells cells
[1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:56.440]  that support neurons in the nervous system were extracted and injected into lab mice the mice
[1:22:56.440 --> 1:23:02.360]  incorporated with the glial cells from these human babies into their brains quote outperformed
[1:23:02.360 --> 1:23:09.560]  normal mice almost fourfold in the variety of cognition tests now this would almost be funny
[1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:14.520]  if it wasn't so gruesome it's kind of a pinky in the brain type of science but it is absolutely
[1:23:14.520 --> 1:23:20.120]  disgusting and of course there were some questions in the debate on thursday about involvement with
[1:23:20.120 --> 1:23:28.040]  Planned Parenthood one of those was put out to george uh to jeb bush and he said no um they
[1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:34.680]  questioned him and they said you were director of a bloomberg foundation that gave 10 million
[1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:39.480]  dollars to Planned Parenthood i said i i didn't know anything about that i was in that bloomberg
[1:23:39.480 --> 1:23:46.760]  foundation because i wanted to enact common core that's a great excuse isn't it so he's
[1:23:46.760 --> 1:23:53.480]  director of a foundation with bloomberg pushing common core and giving 10 million dollars to
[1:23:53.480 --> 1:24:00.120]  Planned Parenthood jeb bush one of the bush clan but then in his defense he said no no i am a pro
[1:24:00.120 --> 1:24:05.320]  life governor let me tell you we cut off funding to Planned Parenthood and i thought well it'd be
[1:24:05.320 --> 1:24:10.760]  interesting to see how much money he did cut off from Planned Parenthood well here's what they did
[1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:17.640]  he two vetoes that he did he vetoed line item vetoes bush vetoed 115 thousand dollars in funding
[1:24:17.640 --> 1:24:23.080]  for northeast Florida Planned Parenthood in duval county and he vetoed 187 thousand dollars for
[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:27.400]  department of health contracts with Planned Parenthood Collier and Sarasota counties so if you load
[1:24:27.400 --> 1:24:33.400]  that up combine those two that's about 300 thousand dollars in state funding to Planned Parenthood
[1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:41.720]  that george bush vetoed however his private foundation gave 30 times that amount to Planned
[1:24:41.720 --> 1:24:48.840]  Parenthood over 10 million dollars so on the one hand he publicly the public face of jeb bush
[1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:54.520]  says i'm cutting funding to Planned Parenthood and he cuts 300 thousand dollars but then privately
[1:24:55.080 --> 1:25:01.720]  along with the bloomberg foundation jeb bush gives them 10 million dollars how's that 30 times as much
[1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:08.360]  much that's the kind of hypocrisy that we see coming from these people that's the kind of
[1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:14.760]  masks that they wear and as we pointed out last week and it bears repeating again back in 1947
[1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:21.880]  prescott bush ran the first national fundraiser for Planned Parenthood their national goal at the
[1:25:21.880 --> 1:25:27.320]  time was two million dollars remember inflation going back to 1947 look at this letterhead guys
[1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:33.880]  get a copy of this because here's a blown-up picture of this letter on the stationary on the top
[1:25:33.880 --> 1:25:42.520]  left hand side we have margaret sanger honorary honorary chairman thank you sorry and then on
[1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:47.080]  the right hand side we have prescott bush treasurer so margaret sanger on the left
[1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:55.720]  prescott bush grandfather of jeb and w on the right as treasurer for their first nationwide
[1:25:55.720 --> 1:26:01.800]  campaign and the letter was signed by margaret sanger and here's someone what she says this means
[1:26:01.800 --> 1:26:09.560]  the coming of age of our organization the enclosed pamphlet the nation's strength outlines our plans
[1:26:09.560 --> 1:26:14.840]  and our objectives it will mark the first major step in integrating Planned Parenthood and the
[1:26:14.840 --> 1:26:20.760]  health and welfare services of the country nationwide plan this is not an appeal for funds
[1:26:20.760 --> 1:26:26.360]  we wanted you to know in advance what our plans and our hopes are so this is prescott bush treasurer
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:32.840]  working with margaret sanger when it became known that he was working with at the time it was called
[1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:41.000]  the birth control society he was knocked out of an expected victory of a senate seat in 1950 but
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:46.920]  then of course he later got involved with that and of course it was not only the grandfather but
[1:26:46.920 --> 1:26:52.360]  of course george h.w. bush and barbara bush have been very actively involved in raising money for
[1:26:52.360 --> 1:26:57.720]  Planned Parenthood we have a letter and we talked about this at the end of last week in march of
[1:26:57.720 --> 1:27:03.720]  1972 from george bush about raising money and working with the people at Planned Parenthood
[1:27:03.720 --> 1:27:09.560]  to help them raise money and so we see then that the grandson now jeb bush is part of an
[1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:14.520]  organization that gives 10 million dollars to Planned Parenthood while trumpeting the fact
[1:27:14.520 --> 1:27:22.920]  that he shut off 300 000 of state funding that's the way it goes oh he also got rid of the uh
[1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:27.960]  Planned Parenthood license plates they haven't done that in virginia we have the story from
[1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:32.680]  kit daniels on info wars dot com virginia has banned the confederate flag plates but not the
[1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:38.600]  Planned Parenthood plates you can still get those in virginia just not a confederate flag plate
[1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:45.160]  but of course we should think that george that jeb bush is pro-life because he banned Planned
[1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:51.000]  Parenthood plates in florida and cut 1 30th of the amount of money that he and his private
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:58.600]  organization donated to Planned Parenthood and then this last thing about jeb bush eight months ago
[1:27:59.720 --> 1:28:04.680]  the day after christmas it came out in the daily news that jeb bush had resigned from a company
[1:28:04.680 --> 1:28:09.480]  that had cashed in an obama care they say his presidential ambitions are looking healthier
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:14.040]  now that he's dropped out of obama care tenet health care corporations and he was on the
[1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:19.480]  board of directors there they've made a lot of money they say they paid uh from obama care and
[1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:27.960]  they paid bush 2.3 million dollars from 2007 to third 2013 as he was a director on a company
[1:28:27.960 --> 1:28:34.840]  that profited from obama care just as he was a director of a company that donated 10 million dollars
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:43.560]  to Planned Parenthood that's pro-life jeb you don't need to understand that jeb bush is anti life
[1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:47.480]  you can look at what happened with terry chavo you don't have to just look at his donations
[1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:52.760]  but the money trail does talk his father his grandfather have all been involved in Planned

[1:33:51.960 --> 1:33:59.400]  call in and join the program before we go to our callers just briefly greek banks have lost half
[1:33:59.400 --> 1:34:04.920]  of their value in this last week you know they've closed the stock market in greece for about five
[1:34:04.920 --> 1:34:10.680]  weeks and they not only shut down the supply of cash but they stopped all stocks from being traded
[1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:17.480]  and as you remember they opened that back up on monday immediately the stocks lost about 23 of
[1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:22.280]  their value they had to stop trading on many of the stocks they throughout the week they gradually
[1:34:22.280 --> 1:34:28.360]  clawed their way back up they say now the stock market is down around 16 percent however it's
[1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:33.640]  much worse than that for the banks they say attica bank has lost over half of its value is down 53
[1:34:33.640 --> 1:34:40.760]  percent the national bank of greece is down 52 percent alpha bank has paid as is down 61 percent
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:46.920]  off of their share prices and one week this is done to the greek banks what it took carly
[1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:53.000]  fiorina to do to hula packard six years to do she took their stocks down 50 percent that's serious
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:57.960]  folks when your stock goes down 50 percent that's the way these people finance their organization
[1:34:57.960 --> 1:35:04.200]  and those are talking about greece is inching closer to a third bailout deal but fins are insisting
[1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:09.640]  that the rescue package will not work they're not talking about an 86 billion dollar a billion euro
[1:35:09.640 --> 1:35:17.800]  deal now they're looking at 100 billion euros it keeps getting bigger and bigger one last thing
[1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:25.560]  on greece then we'll go to your calls this i think tells the story and this is which nation has the
[1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:31.320]  worst dependency ratio here's the dependency ratio the number of non-household members
[1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:35.640]  each worker supports in other words this is a number if you're working you have to support
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:39.640]  yourself you have to support your household how many people outside of your household
[1:35:39.640 --> 1:35:45.240]  do you have to support well in greece that number is six by far and away they have the highest ratio
[1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:52.360]  so besides themselves and besides their household the worker has to support six people outside of
[1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:58.600]  the household that's the kind of burden they have the one next to that is italy at four that's why
[1:35:58.600 --> 1:36:04.680]  alex jones was saying it looks like italy may be the next one on the list where is the usa
[1:36:04.680 --> 1:36:09.400]  we're at two that means that besides yourself and your household you have two dependents outside
[1:36:09.400 --> 1:36:15.160]  of your household that you have to support who's the best on the list canada at only about a third
[1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:22.280]  so they have quite a few less dependents outside of their family that they have to support now
[1:36:22.280 --> 1:36:28.600]  all of this plays into the cloward and piven strategy that the obama administration is doing
[1:36:28.600 --> 1:36:33.080]  here in the united states currently we have to support two people outside of our household
[1:36:33.080 --> 1:36:39.960]  they're working to change that very rapidly that's what this open borders and lavish welfare
[1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:44.600]  benefits for people who are not citizens who did not even bother to get legal permission to come
[1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:49.480]  into this country from all over the world that's what this is all about cloward and piven of course
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:56.280]  the two socialist economies economists who came up with the idea that we need to in order to remake
[1:36:56.280 --> 1:37:02.360]  the various countries into their socialist paradise they first need to destroy it before they can
[1:37:02.360 --> 1:37:08.760]  rebuild it we heard that narrative of course in the last captain america movie that was the
[1:37:08.760 --> 1:37:12.120]  robert redford's character was saying that we have to destroy this country so we can rebuild it
[1:37:12.120 --> 1:37:15.720]  the way we want to and of course that's happening in a number of ways it's happening with the
[1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:19.960]  destruction of the bill of rights and the constitution of the due process and the rule of law but it
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:26.360]  is also happening economically and that's what this is about taking the country down with a
[1:37:26.360 --> 1:37:32.600]  unsustainable welfare state so then you can rebuild it into their communist utopia and we're not
[1:37:32.600 --> 1:37:38.360]  that far behind italy and greece we are far worse than canada again the dependency ratio
[1:37:38.360 --> 1:37:44.680]  of implied public reliance is one third for canada it's two for us and the worst case basket cases
[1:37:44.680 --> 1:37:50.920]  are four and six and we're going to rapidly approach that let's go to our callers now let's
[1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:56.680]  go to uh mark in north carolina mark you want to talk about bush and christy you said go ahead
[1:37:58.120 --> 1:38:03.080]  he had a first thing i wanted to say was about um as far as christy goes
[1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:10.360]  sir i think paul was too gentle with him yeah also reminded him that christy wanted to uh
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:18.520]  uh force states like colorado used federal force basically to um uh get him to uh let go of their
[1:38:19.400 --> 1:38:23.800]  marijuana laws in other words that they should that even though they legalized that he would force
[1:38:23.800 --> 1:38:30.280]  them to um illegitimize it exactly he was he was gonna he said that if he becomes president he's
[1:38:30.280 --> 1:38:36.520]  going to force uh colorado and washington states that have decriminalized marijuana he is going
[1:38:36.520 --> 1:38:42.120]  to remove that as president and let me ask you mark uh what's the constitutional authority for that
[1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:48.760]  well he has no constitutional authority that's actual states right that's right they use they
[1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:53.960]  talk about the civil rights movement sometimes but what they don't understand is you have everybody
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:59.640]  has constitutional rights the bill of rights is for everybody and when a state denies people
[1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:04.440]  their constitutional rights as they did with black people in certain southern states and some other
[1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:09.880]  states too then it is a federal responsibility to do something but this is in the case of marijuana
[1:39:09.880 --> 1:39:14.280]  you're not violating it nobody's rights are being violated in the state of colorado they have every
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:18.600]  right they decide the people decided they want to legalize marijuana now the other thing i wanted
[1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:23.640]  to talk about was bush okay wait before we leave that before we leave that topic we had an article
[1:39:23.640 --> 1:39:29.480]  up last week and it said the federal government has doesn't have the right to ban anything and we
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:35.000]  know that's the case because of alcohol prohibition they had to have a constitutional amendment to ban
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:39.400]  alcohol to prohibit it and we got another one the 21st amendment that that made it legal again
[1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:43.960]  why did they need that because there is nothing in the constitution that says the federal government
[1:39:43.960 --> 1:39:50.200]  can ban alcohol that they can ban cancer drugs or that they can ban marijuana or anything else they
[1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:55.400]  don't have that right the ninth and tenth amendment says if you're not explicitly given the right to
[1:39:55.400 --> 1:40:02.760]  do something that power is retained by the people by the states so they have no legal basis for the
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:08.920]  war on drugs whatsoever as far as guns go really that's what a federal government probably should
[1:40:08.920 --> 1:40:14.280]  interfere because again people's civil rights their constitutional rights are being denied
[1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:20.440]  in states like new york or christie's new jersey okay we're uh we're by it's almost impossible to even
[1:40:20.440 --> 1:40:25.480]  own a gun to even have one in your home let alone to have one to be able to carry one so i that's
[1:40:25.480 --> 1:40:29.160]  what a federal government probably shouldn't interfere because these are illegal laws that the
[1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:33.480]  states are describing people of their civil rights constitutional rights the only thing i want to
[1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:39.560]  talk about the bush family is i'm just finishing up this book called um family of secrets it's by a
[1:40:39.560 --> 1:40:47.160]  guy named rust baker and um this is a really a sleazy family i personally believe first of all
[1:40:47.160 --> 1:40:52.840]  prep scott bush was definitely a supportive hitler as well as plan parents oh yes yeah we know from
[1:40:52.840 --> 1:40:59.320]  the bank connections about that yes go ahead w bush i believe and is good evidence not only
[1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:03.640]  in this book i read other books too like your own course you put all that it's page w was involved
[1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:09.720]  in jf k's murder and i also believe he was involved in shooting ronald reagan because the bush family
[1:41:09.720 --> 1:41:13.880]  and the way in the hinkley family were actually very close friends a lot of people don't know this
[1:41:13.880 --> 1:41:18.680]  but i looked it up i knew this before too and i looked it up to make sure they were actually
[1:41:18.680 --> 1:41:24.120]  close friends too many coincidences happened with the bushes and on top of it h w was actually in
[1:41:24.120 --> 1:41:29.880]  the cia long before he became directed to cia oh yes we were we were told that he what didn't have
[1:41:29.880 --> 1:41:34.680]  any involvement with the uh uh with the bay of pigs or anything and yet it just turned out that
[1:41:34.680 --> 1:41:39.720]  two of the ships that were there were zapata and barbara were the name of them and of course what
[1:41:39.720 --> 1:41:45.160]  was uh hw's oil company it was the pot of oil and his wife was barbara why would they pick
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:52.520]  george bush to head the cia at its lowest point after the church committee hearings just because
[1:41:52.520 --> 1:41:57.800]  the guy was heavily involved in the cia obviously he was he's part of that mafia part of that that
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:42:04.760]  gangster mafia go ahead on top of all of that the bushes and not only the Saudis but the actual
[1:42:04.760 --> 1:42:11.800]  bin laden are very close to get it bin laden actually uh what i think bin laden's brother
[1:42:11.800 --> 1:42:17.080]  actually owned the company though they try to cover up a little bit in houston years before
[1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:23.000]  but i think back in the 1980s this family is i'm telling this family was dirty um
[1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:30.440]  they oh absolutely push it out absolutely very dirty and and we can see the same types of stuff
[1:42:30.440 --> 1:42:35.080]  that we see with the clinton family and all the issues with corruption with crime with people
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:40.280]  around them committing suicide that's what we see with both of these families we have essentially
[1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:45.720]  a game of thrones with a couple of different mafia families pushing this through and of course
[1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:50.120]  that's what the fox news is helping out we're going to have a quote here from michael savage when
[1:42:50.120 --> 1:43:01.160]  we come back and want to read to you about this debate stay with us we'll be right back
[1:43:01.160 --> 1:43:08.280]  cecile richards wants all those bogus videos released at once spoken like someone who really
[1:43:08.280 --> 1:43:13.960]  wants to know how much dirt they have on her so she can get her story straight the center for
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:19.400]  medical progress has hours more footage in the can and is deliberately dripped feeding it to the
[1:43:19.400 --> 1:43:26.040]  public to keep the issue of organ harvesting from aborted fetuses in the headlines and plan
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:32.440]  parenthood hates it richards took to twitter yesterday to complain about the method saying
[1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:39.320]  leaking one at a time is playing politics of course this method is being used to maximize
[1:43:39.320 --> 1:43:44.440]  impact as it rightfully should releasing them all at once would amount to a little more than
[1:43:44.440 --> 1:43:51.000]  outrage of the day status and then it'll be quickly swept under the rug not this time plan parenthood
[1:43:51.960 --> 1:43:58.680]  follow this story and the slow torturous release of the upcoming videos at info wars dot com

[1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:36.680]  no i have no problem uh i'm rare uh i'm anyway sorry don't worry about my problem having over
[1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:42.040]  here over here anyways uh i just wanted to know like your thoughts on the debate you know i think
[1:49:42.040 --> 1:49:48.280]  rampall performed very well and like the polls show about how um he didn't get much time you know
[1:49:48.280 --> 1:49:51.800]  of course it was the Donald Trump show all the sense that feels like we're on mbc watching like
[1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:57.000]  the apprentice here's all about Donald Trump but like what were your thoughts you know uh well i
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:01.800]  thought he had the only i thought he had the only back and forth and again they put chris christy there
[1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:06.520]  i think the only reason they put him in the debate was so that he that he could check rampall because
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:10.120]  we don't want to have somebody that's actually talking about how the government is destroying
[1:50:10.120 --> 1:50:14.600]  the rule of law and taking our individual liberties and shredding the constitution i think
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:19.960]  that's a very valuable role that rampall is serving here and i think he spoke that very spoke for
[1:50:19.960 --> 1:50:24.440]  those causes very well in the very brief amount of time of course he got a lot less even the next
[1:50:24.440 --> 1:50:29.720]  person uh got about 18 20 percent more time than he did uh the people who got the most amount of
[1:50:29.720 --> 1:50:34.120]  time of course were the fox newscasters they were the ones who gave themselves the most time because
[1:50:34.120 --> 1:50:39.400]  it's really about them front and center and that's what we're really seeing about uh making kelly
[1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:45.240]  she made this all about uh what uh donald trump said of course you know when he talks about men
[1:50:45.240 --> 1:50:50.280]  and women as being fat pigs and slobs it's really childish rhetoric but you know and it makes them
[1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:54.600]  look bad i think it makes uh trump look bad to talk like that but it's not necessarily racist or
[1:50:54.600 --> 1:50:59.160]  sexist she wants to take it that way if he says that she's bleeding out of her eyes because of
[1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:04.200]  the vitriol and the hatred that he sees coming out of that he says or or whatever i think personally
[1:51:04.200 --> 1:51:09.160]  i don't think he was referring to menstruation i mean bleeding out of the eyes really i think
[1:51:09.160 --> 1:51:14.120]  that they're twisting that but of course it's really about her narcissism her feminism putting
[1:51:14.120 --> 1:51:20.120]  herself at the center of the debate literally uh she's revealed herself i think to be a token
[1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:27.400]  anchor babe and they managed to avoid any real serious questions any real serious issues or
[1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:33.480]  solutions they made it all about a bunch of nonsense actually what michael savage said
[1:51:33.480 --> 1:51:37.960]  he said obama got away clean in the debate apparently it was trump who was the enemy
[1:51:37.960 --> 1:51:42.040]  think maybe fox wants a democrat victory so it'll keep their ratings high with discontented
[1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:45.880]  conservatives that's what michael savage said i think he's right about it he says think about it
[1:51:45.880 --> 1:51:50.120]  why would pro republican supporters want to provoke and antagonize the leading republican
[1:51:50.120 --> 1:51:53.400]  candidate well you got lindsay graham coming out and saying it's better for a democrat to
[1:51:53.400 --> 1:51:58.360]  win the white house and donald trump that's what he said this weekend lindsay graham there we go so
[1:51:59.640 --> 1:52:03.320]  thank you anthony and tony i want to go to uh some of the other callers so we can try to
[1:52:03.320 --> 1:52:07.560]  get through as many people in this short time we have let's go to uh montey and north dakota
[1:52:07.560 --> 1:52:13.880]  montey wanted to talk about the election go ahead yes sir i would like to talk about the republic
[1:52:13.880 --> 1:52:20.280]  of the united states and the republic for the united states are you there yes go ahead
[1:52:22.040 --> 1:52:35.640]  they were created in november of 2010 and was created by people from a majority of the states in
[1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:48.360]  the defacto corporation coming from as far away as uh hawaii to ethrom utah to create a legal form
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:58.520]  called the doctrine of sovereign intent which has been recognized by at least 90 nations of the world
[1:52:58.520 --> 1:53:05.480]  and presented to the um and well i haven't really heard of that what what is the name of that again
[1:53:06.840 --> 1:53:11.720]  republic and not the only word you need to change when you look for it in the computer
[1:53:11.720 --> 1:53:17.480]  is often for republic of the united states or republic for the united states do you have a
[1:53:17.480 --> 1:53:20.360]  website that you can get people something and look this up because we don't have time to go
[1:53:20.360 --> 1:53:23.240]  into it a lot of detail i want to get to some of the other callers do you have a website
[1:53:23.240 --> 1:53:32.200]  i would say republic for the united states dot org or republic of the united states dot org i'm
[1:53:32.200 --> 1:53:36.840]  not a computer person okay all right well we'll give that out to people you just gave that out
[1:53:36.840 --> 1:53:41.960]  to people and i think we need to all start looking at ways that we can cut off washington i think
[1:53:41.960 --> 1:53:46.680]  this whole thing with the 2016 elections especially when you focus on the very top of the ticket
[1:53:46.680 --> 1:53:50.680]  i've had a lot of experience with third party politics and i know that what they tried to do
[1:53:50.680 --> 1:53:55.800]  first of all was to keep people off the ballot they always give ballot access to the democrat and
[1:53:55.800 --> 1:53:59.080]  republican parties they're free to choose their candidates however they wish they can do it with
[1:53:59.080 --> 1:54:02.920]  a primary they can do it with a caucus or they could just appoint them if they want to there's
[1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:07.000]  nothing about how they get their candidates on but they reserve a spot for them on the ballot
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:11.560]  if you want to come in as an independent or as a third party it becomes extremely difficult for
[1:54:11.560 --> 1:54:15.720]  you to get in and to retain ballot access they typically do it most states certainly they did
[1:54:15.720 --> 1:54:20.440]  north carolina they made a requirement that we had to get ten percent of the vote for either president
[1:54:20.440 --> 1:54:25.720]  or for governor in an election in order to stay on the ballot as a third party so they want to try
[1:54:25.720 --> 1:54:31.720]  to focus you on the things where you're going to have the least success the least amount of of uh
[1:54:32.920 --> 1:54:38.520]  impact and that's on these highest races and we have our minds set on these things we talk about
[1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:42.920]  this because there are some vital issues and we can talk about how these are reflected in these
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:46.680]  candidates so it's good for us to talk about it and it's good for us to talk about it because
[1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:52.280]  other people are talking about these issues or non issues as as it turns out uh what the
[1:54:52.280 --> 1:54:57.000]  debate turned out to be but we need to understand that our real solution is going to be in doing
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:02.600]  something in terms of state nullification in terms of jury nullification or in terms of
[1:55:02.600 --> 1:55:07.560]  what this fellow was just talking about creating some other alternative organizations that stand
[1:55:07.560 --> 1:55:11.240]  against this i agree with that let's go to howard and philly you want to talk about the debate go
[1:55:11.240 --> 1:55:20.760]  ahead a couple a couple couple things david one have you noticed the uncanny resemblance to clare
[1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:26.680]  underwood and has a card of uh that's the seal richards from uh i don't watch house of cards but
[1:55:26.680 --> 1:55:31.320]  i didn't notice an uncanny resemblance between donald trump and biff tannin and back the old
[1:55:31.320 --> 1:55:35.960]  biff tannin and back to the future too i thought it was very much but no i don't watch house of
[1:55:35.960 --> 1:55:40.440]  cards so i didn't see that go ahead about trump and let's also talk about carly for your arena i'm
[1:55:40.440 --> 1:55:45.240]  getting tired of people telling me how smart she is yes because what i heard from that mini debate
[1:55:45.240 --> 1:55:50.680]  was that she thinks everybody should be surveilled she's like a thin chris christy and i'm i'm tired
[1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:55.560]  of chris christy too look the question that should have been asked of the every one of the debate
[1:55:55.560 --> 1:56:02.440]  participants the first one and the second one should have been uh will you uphold your oath of
[1:56:02.440 --> 1:56:08.520]  office and will you honor the constitution no they didn't do that did they did they howard
[1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:13.400]  they asked them are you loyal to the republican party it wasn't that interesting they wanted
[1:56:13.400 --> 1:56:17.160]  them to take a loyalty oath the republican party but they could care less about the bill of rights
[1:56:17.160 --> 1:56:23.320]  about the constitution no loyalty oath there no and i was there as i was on hold i was sitting
[1:56:23.320 --> 1:56:31.000]  here thinking why can't we the people uh create some kind of class action lawsuit for the politicians
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:38.680]  that don't uphold the oath of office that absolutely flout their uh oath of office and one one last
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:45.800]  thing about donald trump i don't trust him but he could be the next bet jessie ventura on a grander
[1:56:45.800 --> 1:56:52.440]  scale in minnesota and if i send the republican to washington as we've just witnessed i'm going to
[1:56:52.440 --> 1:56:58.440]  get socialist if i send a democrat to washington i'm going to get socialist so why not send trump
[1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:02.680]  yeah i understand that so people are saying absolutely yeah it would be interesting it
[1:57:02.680 --> 1:57:06.840]  would definitely be interesting and as i said i don't think we're really going to get it doesn't
[1:57:06.840 --> 1:57:13.400]  really matter who we send as uh uh mr smith to washington we have to work to cut this thing off
[1:57:13.400 --> 1:57:18.120]  at the local and the state level and if we can't get involved at that level it isn't going to
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:22.200]  matter who we elect i mean we could elect rand paul who talks about and works for individual
[1:57:22.200 --> 1:57:27.320]  liberty or whatever who has an understanding of the constitution again donald trump is somebody
[1:57:27.320 --> 1:57:32.840]  that people are looking at because they're angry at the system he's the howard bill he's the guy who
[1:57:32.840 --> 1:57:37.880]  says uh i'm angry as hell and i'm not gonna take it anymore that's why people like him and i understand
[1:57:37.880 --> 1:57:42.680]  i'm frustrated with all this process too but it isn't necessarily going to change anything it's
[1:57:42.680 --> 1:57:47.000]  gonna have to be done at the local level well that's it for today's program sorry to the other
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:58:00.040]  callers we couldn't get to join us tomorrow at 11
