[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
[00:08.000 --> 00:12.000]  There was something so pleasant about that place
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.000]  Even your emotions haven't echoed in so much space
[00:20.000 --> 00:26.000]  And when you're out there without care, yeah, I was out of touch
[00:26.000 --> 00:31.000]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
[00:31.000 --> 00:52.000]  Child Protective Services, the name says it all
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  To place them in the foster care system where they receive bounties from the federal government
[00:56.000 --> 01:04.000]  That's right, the average reimbursement to state and local government for each child taken into foster care is about $6,000 a month
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  The foster care provider receives about $600 a month of that
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  Therefore, each one of these kids forced into foster care are worth approximately $5,000 to CPS
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  Two foster parents had criminal records, a son living there with multiple felonies
[01:19.000 --> 01:26.000]  And a convicted sex offender visiting and sometimes caring for the children, she refused to arrange an adoption
[01:26.000 --> 01:33.000]  Her CPS supervisors responded with this memo, recommending the adoption should proceed quickly
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.000]  Our theory is that the basis for this is the tie to the federal money
[01:38.000 --> 01:46.000]  That every time a child is not placed in a home, the state of Kentucky through its cabinet is losing federal money
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  Child Protective Services in Pennsylvania was at her doorstep, taking her one day old baby
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  Because they thought Liz was abusing drugs
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  But what the hospital didn't consider more closely was poppy seeds
[01:58.000 --> 02:07.000]  We reached out to CPS, they say they can't specifically comment on this case because of privacy law
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  But we wanted to know what the rules are and what rights parents have
[02:11.000 --> 02:18.000]  CPS says we conduct a risk assessment of the child's safety and rely heavily on the direction of health care providers
[02:18.000 --> 02:25.000]  And now Anna and Alex find themselves fighting for Sammy's return and for their rights as parents
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.000]  Where there's children, there are pedophiles, you know, they're in schools and they're in churches
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  And they're everywhere where they can get their hands on children, so we know that that's true
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  And it's got to be brought to an end, it's got to be completely exposed for what it is
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  And in my opinion, it needs to completely be dissolved
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.000]  I don't see any good left in Child Protective Services
[02:50.000 --> 02:56.000]  Senator Nancy Schaefer and her husband Bruce were found dead today at their Habersham County home
[02:56.000 --> 03:02.000]  The bodies of former state senator Nancy Schaefer and her husband Bruce were found today at their Habersham County home
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  Investigators say both had been shot
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.000]  Pleminarity looks to be a murder-suicide, the GBI has six agents on the scene, two crime scene specialists
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  There will be a thorough investigation
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  CPS adversary Senator Nancy Schaefer and her husband's life met a very abrupt end
[03:19.000 --> 03:26.000]  There are far too many oddities surrounding her life for it to have been anything but an assassination due to her outspoken crusade
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  To uncover one of the prime child smuggling areas in the United States, Atlanta, Georgia
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  Bruce was retired and the couple didn't appear to be in any type of dire financial crisis
[03:37.000 --> 03:43.000]  Friends who knew the couple best state that Bruce would simply not have had the capability to kill his wife
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  Nancy was actively exposed in corruption within the Department of Family and Child Services
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  Including actions by the DFCS director in the county where she lived
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  Nancy's husband Bruce was highly supportive of Nancy's work for decades
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.000]  And would have had little or no reason to suddenly try to kill her at such a critical juncture in her career
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  Imagine you're a happy family living in Central Texas in a suburb of Austin, Round Rock
[04:09.000 --> 04:16.000]  And one night you decide to smoke some marijuana after your two-year-old daughter's gone to bed while you watch a movie
[04:16.000 --> 04:22.000]  Something over 100 million Americans are estimated to do every single week
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.000]  A good, secret police neighbor smells the marijuana, calls the police
[04:27.000 --> 04:33.000]  And they come with the CPS and take your two-year-old happy daughter
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  Who never been in the hospital and never been sick and never been beaten up
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  You go for weekly visits
[04:40.000 --> 04:46.000]  That's just a few minutes from a special report that aired last time on The Nightly News
[04:46.000 --> 04:54.000]  Dealing with the CPS connection to pedophile rings and tying it into the 10 children being taken in Kentucky
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  Full video interviews on infowars.com
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.000]  Stay with us
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  The latest example of liberal free speech oppression is brought to you by Kit Daniels in the article
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.000]  Campus police intimidate students over her anti-Obama and pro-gun signs
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  A college student is suing her school after three campus cops and an administrator
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.000]  Ordered her not to carry an anti-Obama sign and a pro-gun sign on campus without special permission
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000]  Nicole Sanders, a student at Blynne College in Brenham, Texas, was recently demonstrating with the signs
[05:21.000 --> 05:26.000]  When she was told she needed special permission for them and had to stay in the college's free speech zone
[05:26.000 --> 05:32.000]  I needed to fill out a form stating what I'm doing, where I'm doing it, who's involved, and what outcome we were expecting, she said
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  We have to wait until four administrators sign it
[05:34.000 --> 05:40.000]  In response, Sanders has filed a lawsuit against Blynne College stating its policies and their enforcement are unconstitutional
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  This story is eerily similar to an incident at California Polytech earlier this year
[05:44.000 --> 05:51.000]  In which school officials were also requiring students to engage in First Amendment activities on campus to apply for a free speech permit
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  You can find more stories like these at infowars.com and prismplanet.com
[05:55.000 --> 06:11.000]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars Nightly News
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  Alex Jones here
[06:28.000 --> 06:35.000]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist, and chemist to design a nutraceutical formulation
[06:35.000 --> 06:38.000]  That has truly life-changing health benefits
[06:38.000 --> 06:42.000]  Introducing the all-new ancient defense herbal immunity blend
[06:42.000 --> 06:50.000]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science

[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  I want more training, I want more reviewers, line, line, line
[07:01.000 --> 07:10.000]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.000]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control
[07:13.000 --> 07:23.000]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions
[07:23.000 --> 07:28.000]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs
[07:28.000 --> 07:34.000]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take
[07:34.000 --> 07:42.000]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there
[07:42.000 --> 07:50.000]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great

[08:01.000 --> 08:10.000]  Is the U.S. involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey?
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  Out of Libya
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.000]  To Turkey?
[08:16.000 --> 08:20.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  How is it that this organization is so well funded, so organized?
[08:24.000 --> 08:31.000]  Lovex state linked militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya, seizing new economically vital areas of the country
[08:31.000 --> 08:40.000]  The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel Hakim Belhaj and of course he was armed to the teeth by NATO
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  The Russians say they're negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military exercises
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up, creating an ominous alliance against the United States
[08:54.000 --> 09:02.000]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal that the U.S. government is negotiating with Iran
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.000]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks on Iran
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order
[09:12.000 --> 09:19.000]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and created an important part in events now
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of an international monetary fund aid package
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  We had broker the deal to transition power in Ukraine
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  Vladimir Putin is on the move
[09:31.000 --> 09:43.000]  Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the opportunities presented by this new and involving world order
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group
[09:46.000 --> 09:57.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live well into the second hour broadcasting worldwide
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  Our guests will be with us till the bottom of the next hour or till the very end of the next hour if they want
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  I don't want to exhaust them
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  Gary Haven is a successful grassroots entrepreneur, the most successful according to Forbes
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  He has franchise in history curves
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  He's retired from that a few years ago
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.000]  Mike Norris, successful filmmaker, Christian filmmaker
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  Son of Chuck Norris, the first born
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  The guy in there helping his dad launch the whole legend
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  He's going to get into that and so much more
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  His view on the world today
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  Gary Haven, Mr. Haven started curves
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  My memory must have been trying to think where did you start it originally?
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  In Harlingen, Texas
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.000]  In Harlingen, Texas
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  You've made a major movie with Mr. Norris over here that I was honored to be in
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  That's coming out in the future
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.000]  We're going to talk about that
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  Tell us about the film and then tell us about yourself
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  And then Mike Norris over here
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  Mr. Haven, all you
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.000]  Well, I retired, sold my company a couple years ago
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  And was looking for something to do
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.000]  And influencing the culture in a positive way
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.000]  Was something that I felt I had a duty to do
[11:08.000 --> 11:11.000]  People don't take the time
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.000]  They're busy, they don't want to watch the news
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  Or really invest in reading about what's going on
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  But they like to be entertained
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  And if you can entertain people while you teach them something
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  I just thought it was a great idea
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  And Mike and I have been friends for a long time
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  Mike is a real famous movie director
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  He's done about 20 different films
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  And so I came in one day and said, I've got a great idea
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  Let's make some movies together
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.000]  And let's influence the culture in a positive way while we entertain people
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  And the first movie we made was
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  It's out and it's available now
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  It's called Mission Air
[11:43.000 --> 11:47.000]  And you can go and find that information about that
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  From Pureflex, which was the distributor
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  For God's Not Dead, for example
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  Go to the website in Christian bookstores
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  And you can get Mission Air
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  And by the way, these Christian films now
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  Are bigger than a lot of Hollywood films
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  I mean, The Passion of the Crisis, an example
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  Absolutely, I'm sorry, Gary
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  There's a number of films that were released this year
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  With a faith-based message that have done phenomenal
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  So it's really great to see the culture
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  Actually starting to change
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.000]  And view this material that we're putting out
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  So it's very exciting
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.000]  It's voting with your dollars
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  I mean, this is how you really change the culture
[12:21.000 --> 12:22.000]  Absolutely
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  But it wasn't until about nine months ago
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  That Gary had this idea for another film
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.000]  That really kind of ramped everything up
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.000]  To a whole other level
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  And that's our next film in Marageddon
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  Now Gary Haven, I should have gone over your bio
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000]  A little bit better
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  And not butchered your name here
[12:38.000 --> 12:39.000]  Live on radio
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  But getting to know you's has really been amazing
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.000]  Your insight into government
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  All the people you've been talking to
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  Federally at the state level
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  You've learned a lot of amazing stuff
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  And it's wild to know the plot of your upcoming film
[12:50.000 --> 12:51.000]  That's already been shot
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  Is now being edited
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  To see that then it ties into Jade Helm
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  And it ties into this very theme
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  That America is so concerned about
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  Yeah, Marageddon was an idea that I had
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.000]  I felt that people needed to learn about power
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  And about what was going on in the world
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  The mainstream media is owned 98% of it
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  By six corporations
[13:15.000 --> 13:16.000]  They're scripted
[13:16.000 --> 13:17.000]  They stay on message
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.000]  And so people are not getting the truth out there
[13:20.000 --> 13:21.000]  And I want to commend you
[13:21.000 --> 13:22.000]  You are a
[13:22.000 --> 13:23.000]  Oh, please don't
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  No, I tell you
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.000]  The courage
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  And also your gift
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  To articulate these difficult concepts
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  Things like vaccinations you were talking about earlier
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  People are not going to get the truth
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.000]  From the mainstream media
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.000]  You know how much money
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  The pharmaceutical companies spend
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  On mainstream media
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  And to think that they don't control the message
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  With all that money would be naive
[13:46.000 --> 13:47.000]  So someone like you
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  Can articulate it beautifully
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.000]  In a way people can understand
[13:50.000 --> 13:51.000]  Well, you can do it better than I
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  In fact, your degree is in health
[13:53.000 --> 13:54.000]  Why don't you give us your take on vaccines
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  You were just telling me about them earlier
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  Well, vaccines are a very concerning thing
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  And I have a five-month-old granddaughter
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  You know, in two months this eight-pound child
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  Was scheduled to get this cocktail of vaccines
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  Whooping cough among them
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  That's something that is really concerning
[14:17.000 --> 14:18.000]  What's in these vaccines?
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  You know, do they have mercury?
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.000]  Do they have aluminum?
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  Do they have the material of the tissue
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  The vaccines were grown on
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  From Rhesus monkeys?
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  That DNA is in these vaccines
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  You know, I'm not saying don't get vaccines
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  But I'm saying think about it
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  Think critically before you allow the establishment
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  To inject into the vein of your eight-pound child
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  A cocktail of vaccines
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.000]  People need to take responsibility for themselves
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  They need to think about it
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  Because the system has been monetized
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  And so vaccines is a great example
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  Of the need for Americans
[14:56.000 --> 15:02.000]  For people like us to just think critically
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  Let's talk about the new film
[15:04.000 --> 15:05.000]  That's in production
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.000]  When it's coming out
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  As much as you can tell us about it
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  The title
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  Well, what we can tell you now is
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  Films called Marageddon
[15:15.000 --> 15:20.000]  We're looking for about a November release date
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  We are in post-production right now
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  Gosh, I wish we had a clip to show
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  A clip that might include one of the stars of the show
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  You might be sitting with us here today
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  Let's see if we've got that clip available
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  Wait, you guys are surprising me
[15:36.000 --> 15:37.000]  I don't even know Mr. Gray
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  That we don't know what you're up to
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  Stockpiling food, weapons, fuel
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  The National Defense Authorization Act
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  Is there to stop domestic terrorist threats
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  To this country and people like you
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  I am an American
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  I am a patriot
[15:53.000 --> 16:00.000]  You, sir, are nothing but a traitor
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  There's nothing like that in my life
[16:02.000 --> 16:12.000]  That man's a threat to this country
[16:12.000 --> 16:13.000]  That little rant
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  Will be all over the news tonight
[16:15.000 --> 16:19.000]  You must understand this plays into our hands
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  The American news media has our narrative
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  That narrative, Charlie Gray
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  Is perfectly playing the role of right-wing extremist
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  The stigma of that label will stop up the years
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  At the American public faster
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  Than any propaganda we could fashion
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.000]  By the way, you guys, we didn't plan any of this
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  And I just can't believe that you guys
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  Snuck that it is so good
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  That looks better than the big giant blockbuster movies
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  I wish I could have lighting like that for my show
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.000]  Man, that looks good
[16:53.000 --> 16:55.000]  And it sounds good
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  After you guys called and invited us on
[16:58.000 --> 17:01.000]  Mr. Haven says, get a clip together
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  And I go, yes, sir
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  So we just kind of put that together
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.000]  Just to give the audience a little feel of
[17:09.000 --> 17:12.000]  The bad politicians, the bad guy
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  And our hero in the movie
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  Well, folks, if you just joined us
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.000]  We have with us two amazing individuals
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.000]  Mike Norris and Gary Haven in studio
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.000]  And the new film is coming out in November
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  And, of course, it'll be in quite a few theaters
[17:27.000 --> 17:28.000]  If it becomes a hit in theaters
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  It'll then go nationwide into thousands of screens
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  If something like this, and believe me
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  I've seen the script I've been in the movie
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  Gets out at the public with this whole climate
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  I mean, could you guys have imagined
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  We'd be talking about Jade Helm and all this
[17:41.000 --> 17:44.000]  Right when your movie's getting ready to come out?
[17:44.000 --> 17:45.000]  Because for folks that don't know
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  We don't want to give the plot away
[17:47.000 --> 17:50.000]  We'll tell a little bit about kind of the theme of it
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  You know, I saw this coming
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  And felt like we needed to warn people
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  We needed to educate them while we entertained them
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  And it was kind of consistent with our message
[17:58.000 --> 18:01.000]  So we went from the Christian movie to the political realm
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.000]  And by the way, you play an evil senator
[18:05.000 --> 18:08.000]  Who is debating with me in front of a city hearing
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.000]  And you were particularly evil
[18:11.000 --> 18:16.000]  Well, I tell you, you guys were going to have
[18:16.000 --> 18:17.000]  Somebody else play the role
[18:17.000 --> 18:18.000]  And I guess you moved to another position
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  About two weeks before you said
[18:20.000 --> 18:21.000]  Hey, do you want to do this?
[18:21.000 --> 18:22.000]  I said, sure
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  And then like about four or five days before
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  I get the script that had been changed
[18:27.000 --> 18:28.000]  And I think I did an okay job
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  But not as good as you guys did
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  You really are good
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  I mean, just the dynamics of the both of you
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  We're all on the same side here
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  But what's fun is to go into a movie
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  And you get to play a crooked politician
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.000]  Well, I tell you, after we did about 10 takes
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.000]  That I sort of really not like in Gary
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  It was weird
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  Well, it was actually 14 takes out
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  Wow
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  There's a lot of footage
[18:56.000 --> 18:57.000]  Wow
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.000]  This is all over
[18:58.000 --> 18:59.000]  We'll pull out the fun footage
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  And we'll just have a little party together
[19:01.000 --> 19:02.000]  Oh my gosh, it's amazing
[19:02.000 --> 19:05.000]  Listen, I want to come back from break here in a moment
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  And get back into the film
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  But give us a sneak peek
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.000]  Gary, how much of this can we get into?
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  Well, the movie's based...
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  Kind of the byline is a true story
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  That hasn't happened yet
[19:17.000 --> 19:20.000]  And we're really seeing that play out right now
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  One of the scenes, for example
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  In fact, with you
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.000]  Was a take from a conversation I had with my congressman
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  Where I challenged him
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  Why he voted for the National Defense Authorization Act
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  And I said to him, do you realize it suspends the fifth one?
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  Hold on, you told me this story over dinner
[19:39.000 --> 19:40.000]  It was amazing
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  I can't tell the story of the inside baseball of this
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  Because you wanted to make this film
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.000]  From what you told me
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  Because you kept going around warning people
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  And then getting this response
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.000]  Wow, it's amazing
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  And then coming up
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  We're going to get into Chuck Norris, Steve McQueen

[24:30.000 --> 24:34.000]  That is so incredibly professional
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  Gary Haven and Mike Norris
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  And then I want to get into the Steve McQueen stories
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  Because I'm a big Chuck Norris fan
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  Watching him as a kid
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  But more so his politics
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  Being a real constitutionalist
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  A big fan of 1776
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  A big supporter of George Washington
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  Reading his columns in worldnetdaily.com
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  In the last decade or so
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  However long it's been, it made me
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  Really get into the mind of Chuck Norris
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  And see what a one-of-a-kind guy he is
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  And then to meet his son, who's a listener
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  And a patriot as well
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  And then to meet Gary
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  And then the stories he told me about
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  And who are awake, people that aren't
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  Telling me what a real deal
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  Governor Abbott is as well
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  I've talked to a lot of folks that know him
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  That have worked for him before he was even in government
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  They say he's a real Christian man
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  A great guy, really cares
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  He's suing the government over the power plant shutdowns
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  He's fighting to secure our border
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  I think we're really lucky to have him as a governor
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  I'm just giving a prelude, this is a short segment
[25:35.000 --> 25:36.000]  To what we're going to be talking about today
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  But listen, don't pause for me
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  I mean, I loved having that two-hour dinner
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  With the guys where you were just
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  Just screaming of consciousness
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  You're the guys that need a radio show
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  Fighting the New World Order
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  But hell, you've got movies fighting the New World Order
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  Let's get back, because when we come back from break
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  We're going to play that clip again
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  I got blindsided by that
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  I want to see that again
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  Tell us about the new film, how people support it
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  And more of the plot
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  Because when they hear the plot and understand
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  This is not a B-movie, folks
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  I mean, you spent big money on this
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  And Mike, I've seen a lot of your films
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  And they're powerful, because you know
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  My kids mainly watch Christian films
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  And you're one of the top directors
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  But my gosh, you've knocked it
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  I mean, what, that looks better
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  Than Steven Spielberg movies when they show Congress
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  How did you do that?
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  Right here
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  Gary, I, you know
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  I do not take lightly
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  What anything
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  That Gary asks of me
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  I have so much respect
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  For Gary and his wife Diane
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  That when this challenge was brought on
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  To do this film
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  I was in, let's do it
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  But boy, I had no idea
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  What I was getting into
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  Once production started
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  Things were happening left and right
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  And decisions having to be made
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  And for this film to come out
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  The way it did with the message
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  That it's presenting
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  I agree with Gary
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  This is a God thing, that this is happening
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  To get people to open their eyes
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  To what's really happening in the world
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  We need this alternative media
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  And you were talking about my father
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  Well, the first thing you told me
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  Tell Alex I said hi, I'm a huge fan
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  So, I'm just really excited
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  About Amerageddon
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  Absolutely
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  Shifting gears, we're gonna come back
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  And talk more about Amerageddon
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  And how people can support it
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  And make this international huge hit
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  That it needs to be to really educate people
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  About the news media
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  The Liberty movement is able to counter
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  CNN, MSNBC
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  But the real brainwashing, as you guys were saying
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  During the break, is in the music
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  Is in Hollywood, is in the culture
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  That's what they're really getting everybody
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  And the fact that more and more
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  Not just Christian, but patriot film
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  Could become the new mega genre
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  That could basically unseat this
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  And counter their narrative
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  And people are hungry for it
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  So it's not like we're pushing a boulder uphill
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  About to push it downhill
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  At the globalist in my view
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  I agree 100%
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  And I really have to
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  Once again, hand it to Gary
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  Personally, I wouldn't have been bold enough
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  On my own to make this film
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  At that time, but with Gary saying
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  This is what we're gonna do
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  This is the money we've got to make it
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  Let's go get this done
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  I jumped in both feet, and like I said
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  It was a tough shoot
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  Getting this cast together, getting you involved in it
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  By the way, talk about the cast
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  You've got some huge people on this
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  It's an interesting, eclectic cast
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  We have Diane Ladd
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  Three-time Academy Award
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  Nominated actress
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  She was an easy writer
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  Chinatown
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  Annalyn McCord, Deena Meyer
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  Alex Jones
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  Oh, come on
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  No, no, no, no
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  It really was perfect
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  I just had this idea, I go, gosh
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.000]  And I'm a listener
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.000]  I'm a patriot, I mean, every night
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  Infowars.com, that is what I listen to
[29:02.000 --> 29:04.000]  All night long
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  I should put up with it
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  I go to Infowars
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  So, to have you play
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  Such an evil character
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  I just thought was, I loved it
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  And you were great
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  It was kind of fun to try to get in that mindset
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  Of just ridiculing and stuff
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  It was crazy
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  It was beautiful
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  The intro, get into that
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  And then gentlemen, I'm putting it on autopilot
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  I mean, I want to go back to that Mexican food restaurant
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  And, you know
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  I want to just talk about the politics
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  And then look at Jade Helm
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  And then we're going to get in the next hour
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  Into the really juicy stuff
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  Because let me tell you, a lot of stuff you were telling me
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  Is not known about Chuck Norris
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  Nothing, none of it
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  I hope you don't come get us
[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  Alex Jones
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  And the GCN Radio Network
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.000]  Imagine Bin Laden, curled up on his couch
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.000]  Fascinated with the myriad of 9-11 conspiracy theories
[30:28.000 --> 30:30.000]  Knowing that he himself
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  Had masterminded the attack
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  The other possibility is that the entire list
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  Has been completely fabricated
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.000]  In an effort to smear conspiracy theorists
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  As terrorist sympathizers
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  Fun fact, you can actually find some of the books
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  On Bin Laden's bookshelf
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  Right here at the Infowars store
[30:46.000 --> 30:48.000]  Terrorists
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  Find out just what was on Bin Laden's bookshelf
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  By reading the article
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  Osama Bin Laden was a 9-11 truther

[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  Big changes, a lot of energy
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks
[31:28.000 --> 31:30.000]  Energy shots, they've got a ton of money there
[31:30.000 --> 31:32.000]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  Harvested around the planet
[31:34.000 --> 31:36.000]  And then concentrated
[31:36.000 --> 31:38.000]  Or maximum potency
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  They want to stun and dumb down
[31:40.000 --> 31:42.000]  And energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.000]  But then burn you out in my experience
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  Where stuff that gets your glands naturally going

[32:30.000 --> 32:32.000]  For the last two years I've been working with top doctors
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  Nutritionist and chemist
[32:34.000 --> 32:36.000]  To design a nutraceutical formulation

[32:54.000 --> 33:16.000]  That's infowarslife.com
[33:24.000 --> 33:28.000]  That little rant will be all over the news tonight
[33:28.000 --> 33:32.000]  You must understand this plays into our hands
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.000]  The American news media has our narrative
[33:36.000 --> 33:38.000]  And in that narrative
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.000]  Charlie Gray is perfectly playing
[33:40.000 --> 33:42.000]  The role of right wing extremist
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  The stigma of that label will stop up the years
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  At the American public faster
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  Than any propaganda we could fashion
[33:50.000 --> 33:52.000]  And that's a clip from the upcoming film
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  That is going to be coming out in what November?
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  Yeah, roughly November
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  Wow, and is there a website for it yet?
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  No, no, right now
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  Everything is about getting the film done
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.000]  We're in VFX right now
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  First cut is pretty much done
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  We just want to give you a little taste of you
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  Well, it looks really good
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  I remember seeing the monitors and how
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  Because I've been in some other pretty big films
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  Like Keanu Reeves and other folks
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  I've been in some other pretty big films
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  Like Keanu Reeves and other folks
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  Or like Keanu Reeves and other folks
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  Some link-letter films too
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  And quite a few other little movies
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  I never really sought it out
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  But people say, hey, will you do this cameo
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  Or will you come do this? Pretty much just playing myself
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  The reason I like this was it was doing something different
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  That's fun
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  Exactly, exactly
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  You had it good though, you're just playing yourself
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  It's kind of easy, being angry at the system
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  And how they're threatening our freedom
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  Is a pretty thing to get to
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  You haven't, we've got Mike Norris here
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  I tell you, I mean
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  Your dad's been on the show before via phone
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  And then he came out once and we were trying to stop
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  A standoff in East Texas and he helped
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  Kind of diffuse that with the grays
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  So I mean, I know your dad and then I was
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  I knew he was a listener even 15 years ago
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  But when he's been on, he goes, I really am a
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  Routine listener, so I'm just so flattered
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  But it's how many other people are aware
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  And it's not like I taught Chuck Norris anything
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  He was already a patriot before I was born
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  But what do you make with Jade Helm
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  Because I don't want to give away the film
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  But it almost parallels this
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  What do you make of Jade Helm
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  And Senator Cruz
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  And Representative Goldmer
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  And Governor Abbott
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  And all these other prominent people saying no
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  And Chuck Norris, no, we don't trust Obama
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  We don't think this is a takeover
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  But there shouldn't be this major domestic role
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  We know the military is in the news
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  Training to take on the patriots
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  Gary, yeah
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  This really is an area I've spent a lot of time
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  You know, being retired
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  It gives me about six hours a day
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  To read and to stay up on things
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  And so I've enjoyed getting to know that
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  You know, my company does business in 90 countries
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  So I've got a neat
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  World view of events
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  Ukraine, for example
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  If you follow the script
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  The mainstream media has been
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  Promoting on Ukraine
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  You would think that Putin's this bad guy
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  Who's come into Crimea
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  And taken it over
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  And this script is just all wrong
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  The United States
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  Spent six billion dollars
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  Through the State Department, Victoria Newland
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  To overthrow the elected government of Ukraine
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  And this is all about
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  Moneyed interest
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  It's about bankers' interest
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  It's another war
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  Where we're going to send our kids and our treasure
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  To go protect
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  The assets
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  Of Monsanto and the oil companies
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  Into central bankers
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  And I was having this
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  Discussion at dinner
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  With the governor and Ted Cruz
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  Senator Ted Cruz a few weeks ago
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  And I was actually vetting
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  Ted Cruz, you know, I was really hopeful
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  We've got a guy that's going to stand up
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  To these moneyed interests that are controlling
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  Our government
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  And I was really hopeful
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  That he was on our side
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  Now, I knew that Ted Cruz's wife
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  Was a vice president for
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  Goldman Sachs
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  And also that she's a member
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  Of the Council for Foreign Relations
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  And, you know, it puts him under suspicion
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  But we had a
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  Discussion, in fact, I'll tell you how it went
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  He kind of talked to the
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  Six or eight people at the table about
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  Why we need to be there, why we need to send our kids there
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  And I kept my mouth shut
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  When it was my turn to speak, I started
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  The conversation like this, I said, Senator
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  I know you're a Harvard Law School graduate
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  Who's argued in front of the Supreme Court
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  I may regret what I'm about to say
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  And I gave the
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  True view of the Ukraine
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  Over about ten minutes
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  In fact, it was so heated
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  I turned to the governor and I said
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  Are you going to invite me back
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  And he did
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  And I think he got to hear the truth
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  In front of the two of us
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  Challenging each other
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  And I got to tell you, I won the debate with Ted Cruz
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  Because I had the truth on my side
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  And I was fully informed
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  That's the one thing I don't like about him
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  Is that he is supporting
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  Starting a war with the Russians
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  It doesn't mean Putin is a good guy
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  It's just that you don't overthrow an elected
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  Government and put neo-Nazis in charge
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  So Joe Biden's son
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  Can run a gas company
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  Exactly, this thing stinks
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  So bad
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  And it's a great example
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  Of the control the mainstream media
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  Has on the
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  Informations out there and on who controls
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  The mainstream media
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  And the American people, again, it goes back to critical thinking
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  We really need to quit
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  You can't just think these people are stupid
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  You know, going in poking a stick
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  In a nuclear power, Russia
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  Is just not a good idea
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  And yet they're doing it in Syria
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  They're doing it in Iran
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  They're doing it in the Ukraine
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  And you always ask the question, Kuobono
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  Who's benefiting from this
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  If you ask that question
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  You can get to the bottom of a lot of things
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  In general, these are bankers
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  That think they're invincible and insulated
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  Because they got 15 helicopters
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  No, a nuclear war breaks out, it's over
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  It's insane
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  And this all comes from the
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  Wolfowitz Doctrine
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  Which came out in the 90s from Paul Wolfowitz
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  The Secretary of Defense
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  When he said that we have to maintain hegemony
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  We have to be the most powerful
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  The only powerful country on the planet
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  And if any other countries begin to threaten our power
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  We have to annihilate them
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  And I'll tell you what
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  We don't have the means
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  We should not be trying to
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  Dominate the world
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  And
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  Enforce
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  Our views on the world
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  We're going to save the world
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  We're not even putting American views
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  We're like trying to make Russia
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  Teach five-year-olds about gay marriage
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  I mean
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  Putin's like saying, you're not Christian
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  We're being lectured by Vladimir Putin
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  They're trying to put Christianity back in schools
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  We've taken it out, I mean this is really getting upside down
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  It's crazy
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  And again, you know
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  This is happening in such a large scale
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  That our voices
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  Are these quiet cries in the night
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  But truth is a powerful thing
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  We have truth on our side
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  And we have to have the courage to speak it
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  I believe I was
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  Given the ability, the opportunity
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  To speak truth to power
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  Whether it's Senator Chad Cruz
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  Governor
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  I spent nine hours with George W. Bush
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  This is Gary Haven speaking, the founder of the
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  Curves
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  One of the most successful, the most successful
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  According to Forbes franchise in history
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  He's made billions of dollars
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  And he's here now trying to fight the global
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  Let's go ahead
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  I took him to Haiti in my aircraft
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  Four hours there, four hours back
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  Just him and I sitting talking
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  So I've had the opportunity
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  To really speak truth to power
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  In so many different levels
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  I was a major Republican
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  Donor because I thought that
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  By supporting conservative Republicans
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  That I could influence good government
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  Well, I've given up on that
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  The Republican Party
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  Has given themselves over
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  Through the establishment
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  Look how they're pushing the TPP right now
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  That they want to let Congress see
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  They're helping Obama beat
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  The Republicans, it's incredible
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  That's a great example
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  This is where you and I
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  Have a responsibility
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  This Trans-Pacific Partnership
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  Is not available
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  To the general public
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  It's been kept secret
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  This is insane
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  We think from leaks
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  That corporations are going to be
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  Given power to sue governments
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  And when governments
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  Interfer with their profitability
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  Well, and we're not
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  Allowed to see this a witness
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  The American people should be
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  Up in arms over
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  The audacity
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  Of our government
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  And I tell you, the Republicans are pushing this
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  As hard as Obama is
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  A
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  A set of laws is going to totally
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  Change our society
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  We're not even allowed to look at it
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  Where is the outrage
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  Over our loss of freedoms
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  Over this issue
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  The whole thing right now is crazy
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  But this J. Helm
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  In our movie
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  It talks about things like
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  The National Defense Authorization Act
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  Which the Republican Party
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  Supported, that gives the president
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  The ability to declare martial law
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  For any reason, economic
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  Or otherwise, without approval
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  Of Congress, and under martial law
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  That's right, those executive orders and PDDs
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  Are all in the books, it's been in the news
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  You can just search, Obama signs executive order
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  To take over entire economy
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  For any emergency, including economic
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  They put internet kill switches in
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  They've got NDAA, it's all there
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  They say they're main enemies, Christians and veterans
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  And gun owners, I mean this is crazy
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  And Chuck Norris reads it
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  And Louie Gohmert reads it
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  And Senator Cruz reads it
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  And Ron Paul reads it, and you read it
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  We're just telling people
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  They're building this huge
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.000]  Terranical program, and then they
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  Misrepresent what we all say
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  Our movie was a chance
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  To provide an entertaining
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  Venue
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  Where we demonstrate and educate
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  What
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  13603 executive order
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  Actually does, where
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  The president can take
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  All of your resources
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.000]  I'm a former rancher, they can come
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  And take my tractors, they can come
[43:32.000 --> 43:34.000]  And take my property, my land, they can come
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  And take me, and
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  Enforce me to work
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  Without wages, and if you read
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  13603, it's very, very clear
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  When we talk about this in the movie
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  And then we demonstrate it, we show how
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  The UN is going to side
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  With the American army
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  And come in and arrest
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  Dissidents. And by the way, that's as you
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  Know, been in the Washington Post
[43:56.000 --> 43:58.000]  That they're going to use UN troops
[43:58.000 --> 44:00.000]  During civil disturbance in America
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  Yeah, it's all out there. I mean, we read
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  You're a billionaire company guy
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  Smart guy that's founded companies
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  You've made all these top films
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  In the media system, it's not like we're total idiots
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  And we just make stuff up
[44:12.000 --> 44:14.000]  I mean, it's all right here
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  I mean, this is what's going on
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  And the thing is, it's not like we're being
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  Conquered by the Romans
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  Or something, they're going to put aqueducts in
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  We're being conquered, I must say the Romans were good
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  By the globalists that are
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  Anti-human, Malthusian,
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.000]  Exterminist, basically
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  Satanist. And so
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  That's the real problem
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  Is we're being conquered by some really nasty people
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  You know, there's three things
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  That people ought to get a hold of
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  The first thing is
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  Is that
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  The power in Washington
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  Has been bought
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  And paid for by moneyed interest
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  There is no representation
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  Of the people. And I can prove this
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  Princeton University just finished
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.000]  The study and analyzed
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  What influenced do the average individual
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  Voters have on the
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  Policies of the US government
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  And the Princeton University said zero
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  They said that the average voter
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  The average person has no interest
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  That's a special interest coup d'etat
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  And the interest is
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  The people that provide the money
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  To Washington. And we're talking about
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  The pharmaceutical industry
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  The industrial security complex
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  We're talking about the bank
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  Oh, now you're anti-troops
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  Oh, Eisenhower warned too. I guess he's bad
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  Well, you know, admitting that
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  I think the greatest thing we can do
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  Is defeat them out of wars
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  That they have no business being in
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  Exactly. Why did we arm Al Qaeda
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  The Free Syrian Army? Now they're ISIS
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  The CIA did. Now the army has to go fight them
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  Good question
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  So we've got to recognize
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  That we have no influence on Washington
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  Everybody's been bought and paid for
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  And I've spoken this to my senators
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  And I've spoken this to my Congress
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  What did Ted Cruz say when he said that?
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  Ted Cruz
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  Liked the guy
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  But I vetted him
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  And I don't trust him. I believe
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  That he's given himself over to
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  To the elite, to the establishment
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  And in fact
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  You know, we can't go into all that
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  But the only guy I've got any hope for right now
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  Is Rand Paul. And I've met Rand Paul
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  Talked to Rand Paul. Tell me about it
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  I mean, I know him as well for 20 years
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  Tell me you're...
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  But I haven't talked to him in years
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  Tell me what you got from meeting with him
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  Two things. The first thing is
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  He's the son of his father
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  And I'm a big fan of his father
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  That's why they hate him. They know he's for real
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  Yeah. But the other thing is
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  He's also smart and he's staying in the middle
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  To stay electable
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  And they know he's doing that
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  So I believe
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  That if he gets elected
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  By staying in the middle
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  That he'll be the son of his father
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  When he's in power
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  And that's exactly what the Atlantic
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  Of the New York Times and others say
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  Well, they've had his phones tapped
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.000]  They know the whole deal. He's his dad
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.000]  And just as good
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  A patriot
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  And they hate his guts. That's why I think
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  Rand Paul is the best
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  Well, frankly, Ted Cruz is probably slicker
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  And it would be better than Hillary Clinton
[47:12.000 --> 47:14.000]  I mean, you know, I don't think Ted Cruz is a bad guy
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  But I think he's
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  He's just compromised
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  At the highest levels
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  Kind of with that Republican power structure
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  The Mitch McConnells right now
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  Trying to sign us on the TPP
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  It's insane. But you know, Alex
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  And I think you'd agree with me
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  There's not going to be a
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  Political solution to this problem
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  The only solution is if enough
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  People wake up and begin to think
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  They begin to critically think
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  And begin to pursue truth
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  And invest the time and effort
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  You told me you've developed a plan
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  And you're a guy that set up
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  More franchises in the world
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  Than anybody ever has
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  Even more than the McDonald's
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  The most successful franchise ever
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  So you're not organized things
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  Boy, I don't. Wish I did
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  Explained a great thing
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  My crew is starting to get good at it
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  But how would you organize
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  Simply put, a way to take things back
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  Because I just organically know
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  If we expose the tyranny, the fraud of the system
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  There'll be enough people in the system
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  That basically leak the truth that it comes down
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  But I was kind of wrong
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  With no more slaves
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  And the globalists are pointing a gun at us
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  Going, yeah, I took over
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  I think the message has to be
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  Fairly simple
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  And that's where the
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  This is so complex
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  The derivatives and the
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  Money printing, you get into that
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  And it's so complex
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  That it's difficult for people to grasp it
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  So you've got to keep the message simple
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  And again, I think there's three things
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  That if we stay focused on message
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  And the first one is
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  Is that our government in Washington
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  Is bought and paid for by the money interest
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  We have no influence
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  We're not going to get anybody
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  Elected that's going to change anything
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  Because, number two
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  The message is controlled
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  The mainstream media, this is the second thing
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  People need to realize, 98%
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  Of it is owned by six corporations
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  And it's scripted, and they're not going to go off message
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  There's too much money involved
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  So the third point is
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  It's up to individuals
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  To begin to think
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  Clearly to think critically
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  And to pursue truth
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  Thank God for alternative media
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  This is so important
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  Because the outlets for truth
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  Are narrowed now, but they exist
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  In alternative media
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  But there's real danger, they're trying to shut them down
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  It's here on the news today, go ahead
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  You bet you they are, they realize
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  That people that are fully aware
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  Are not going to tolerate the loss of the freedoms
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  Either through these executive orders
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  That defy the constitution
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  Or the National Defense Authorization Act
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  Or the spending of money
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  Your parents are retired
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  They're supposed to live off their savings
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  They're supposed to get 6% interest
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  And enjoy the benefits
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  Of what they've saved their lives for
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  They're getting nothing
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  0.6% interest if they're lucky
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  Or 0.06% interest
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  Our government, through its monetary policy
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  Have destroyed the life
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  Taking trillions of dollars
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  From our parents who saved and prepared
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  For retirement. Where's the outrage
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  Over this? This is insane
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  And it's supposed to be
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  To stimulate the economy
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  We just had a negative first quarter
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  We're about to have another negative
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  There is no stimulation of the economy
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  All there is is massive debts
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  That have been placed on the backs of
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  Not our children and grandchildren
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  Because it's not going to last that long
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  This massive debt is going to bankrupt
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  Our system in this country
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  And change all of our lives
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  Wow, Gary Haven is our guest
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  Mike Norris is here
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  And he's going to get into his view on the world
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  And a lot more coming up
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  In fact, if you guys will do it, we'll do the whole next hour
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  And who knows if you want, we'll open the phones up
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  And talk to both of you guys
[50:58.000 --> 51:24.000]  Did you know some countries are now banning GMO foods? It's true!
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.000]  We don't just sell the products, we live it!
[51:54.000 --> 52:02.000]  It's Katie Armour's 15% off sale now through Memorial Day

[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too

[53:08.000 --> 53:11.000]  And I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case

[54:24.000 --> 54:31.000]  If these walls had ears, the stuff you guys have been telling me is unbelievable
[54:31.000 --> 54:35.000]  We have the fount of the true Chuck Norris lore
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.000]  Right here with us, Mike Norris, next hour
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  We're doing the whole hour with us and the guys are getting lunch
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  Did you ever find out what you guys wanted for lunch?
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  Turkey
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.000]  You want a turkey sandwich? You want barbecue turkey?
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  No, no, no
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.000]  You aren't fat like I've been, but you've lost a ton of weight, Mike
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  Yeah, I'm trying, thank you
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  When was the film shoot? Three months ago?
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  January, in January and February?
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  Yeah, about January and February
[55:02.000 --> 55:03.000]  Just three months ago
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  About 25-30 pounds since then
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  Yeah, I mean, I've lost, I gained 99 pounds
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  I was literally fat as fresh limbaugh almost, not quite
[55:12.000 --> 55:15.000]  But the point is, when he was fat, I might be a mean
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.000]  And then I've lost 60 something of it, but I still need to lose another 25
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  It's tough, that last few pounds
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  Well, you've done it, buddy
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  I got no choice, I saw myself on film about how to heart attack
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  It looked like John Candy
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  No, you didn't
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  No, you didn't
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  Are we on air?
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  We are
[55:35.000 --> 55:39.000]  I gotta tell your audience, they have no idea how awesome this is here
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  This is fun
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  Well, thank you, it's just we get up here and just talk
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.000]  And we'll cover the news and just go over the information, take calls
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  Right, people on?
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  I was having an out-of-body experience listening to you two go at it
[55:51.000 --> 55:52.000]  Talking about
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  Well, let me tell you, this guy, you can tell why he made millions of dollars
[55:55.000 --> 55:56.000]  He knows what he's talking about
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  Please, Mr. Gaven, I'm saying
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  Mr. Haven, I do that all the time, I can flay names
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.000]  Please continue, Gary, getting into the solutions
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  First identify the problem and then get into the solutions
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  We're gonna start the next hour and get into
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  Chuck Norris, Lord
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  I'm sorry
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  We're heavy now, we'll get lightly
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.000]  You know, Al Cunha share a common goal
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  That is, we're committed to getting the truth out to people
[56:25.000 --> 56:30.000]  And we're committed to protecting and defending the Constitution
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.000]  Of this country against enemies foreign and domestic
[56:33.000 --> 56:37.000]  And I don't know that our forefathers, I don't know that George Washington
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.000]  Understood that the domestic threat that was gonna exist
[56:40.000 --> 56:43.000]  For our freedoms in this country that we have today
[56:43.000 --> 56:46.000]  Well, can you imagine what the founders would...
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  I mean, everybody always says that, but this is becoming crazy land
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  And they're just the Democrats have announced
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  They wanna shut down talk radio and Libertarian conservative news
[56:54.000 --> 56:57.000]  It was just announced today, it's up on infowars.com
[56:57.000 --> 57:00.000]  Electric Commission dams want to regulate conservative internet
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  Super PACs, they've made the announcement
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  They promised they wouldn't, just let the FCC run the internet
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  And now what are they doing?
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  Yeah, it's crazy
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  I wanna share a story with you
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  I felt...
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  It's a good thing
[57:16.000 --> 57:22.000]  I was given an opportunity to teach the governor
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  Governor Abbott about...
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  In fact, here's the way it began
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  In fact, he was the Attorney General at the time
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.000]  I said, General, you're gonna be the most important governor
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  In the history of Texas
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  And he gave me a really odd look
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  And he said, how so?
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  You're gonna be in a position to choose to comply
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.000]  With an out-of-control dictatorial federal government
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  You told me the story in February
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.000]  And now it's happening with him and Jane Helm
[57:51.000 --> 57:52.000]  Isn't that amazing?
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  And you told me at dinner, you said
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  I believe he will be in that position
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  God basically told me
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  And that is... I'm getting chills
[58:00.000 --> 58:01.000]  I don't mean to steal your thunder
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  You just can't make this stuff up
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  We should have led with this
[58:05.000 --> 58:08.000]  Hey, I've run into a chief of staff on the street
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  Twice in the last two weeks
[58:10.000 --> 58:11.000]  And then he comes over and shakes my hand
[58:11.000 --> 58:12.000]  And we start talking about stuff
[58:12.000 --> 58:13.000]  Yeah, they're great guests
[58:13.000 --> 58:16.000]  Well, for people that may not be aware of what he did
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.000]  When Texans begin to shop
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  Look, we don't like this Jane Helm thing
[58:23.000 --> 58:24.000]  We don't like...
[58:24.000 --> 58:25.000]  You know, we gotta go to break
[58:25.000 --> 58:26.000]  It's a five-minute segment
[58:26.000 --> 58:27.000]  12-minute segment
[58:27.000 --> 58:28.000]  6-minute segment
[58:28.000 --> 58:29.000]  18-minute segment
[58:29.000 --> 58:30.000]  6-minute segment
[58:30.000 --> 58:33.000]  So I want to just start this whole thing over
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.000]  I'm gonna shut up, give you the floor
[58:35.000 --> 58:38.000]  To tell the story in 70 seconds
[58:38.000 --> 58:42.000]  You are listening to GCN
[58:42.000 --> 59:09.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today
[59:09.000 --> 59:12.000]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory
[59:12.000 --> 59:14.000]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show
[59:14.000 --> 59:15.000]  Called Info Wars
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  These people are assaulting us
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  They are never going to stop
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  They're never going to deviate from their program
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  Until we stop them
[59:28.000 --> 59:40.000]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy
[59:40.000 --> 59:43.000]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out
[59:43.000 --> 01:00:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  Big Brother

[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  Government cover-ups
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  Well, so does he

[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  Alex Jones
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  Gary Haven, the founder of Curves
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  And many other huge successful corporations
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  Is our guest

[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  And a patriot running around
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  Trying to wake up the Republicans for years
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  Behind the scenes
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  And now working with Mike Norris
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  And some stations don't carry this segment
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  Most of them do, but I decided to do this
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  Instead of stations having to carry propaganda news
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  We're here
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  So I'm going to ask you to defer to tell your habit story
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  To the next segment
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  You will have the floor
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  And then we're going to segue into Steve McQueen land
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  Because this is interesting
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  It's back when men were men
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  And of course your dad was great buddies with Steve McQueen
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  I mean, it's Chuck Norris
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  I mean, you know, Steve McQueen
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  Discovered Chuck Norris
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  I mean, it's just amazing
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  But we'll get into all that
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  But getting back into Jade Helm
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  I want to ask you, Mr. Norris
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  What do you think about the big freak out about it?
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  Because quite frankly
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  It's just one more conditioning to have trips on the streets
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  We didn't say it was that big a deal
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  But now they're freaking out so bad
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  Do you think we hit on something bigger?
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  Because now we're learning it is about
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  Domestic operations for sure
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  Well, let me say this to you
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  I've had my head buried in an editing studio
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  For four months
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  I know about Jade Helm
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  And I know my dad is very much an advocate
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  For the anti Jade Helm
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  And he's Mr. Military
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  Yeah
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  He has the contacts
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  Absolutely
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  He hands out the bronze stars
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  And Gresham metal honors
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  Yes, and so I know Jade Helm
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  Gary really knows Jade Helm
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  And what I do know is that
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  My dad said that the troops were kind of
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  Butting up to his ranch
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  And if I could just say something to them
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  Don't do it
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  And also, if any troops back up to Gary Haven's ranch
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  Don't do it, seriously
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  You've got armed helicopters
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  My ranch is three miles from North Fort Hood
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  I think I'm out of luck on this
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  Well, we all know the truth
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  The troops are awesome
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  They are the most
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  And I'm not kissing their butt
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  Because I used to
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  I didn't like all this
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  The establishment using it
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  To make themselves look good
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  Oh, the troops are great
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  But then I found out
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  They are the most awake group
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  I mean, they are great
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  Absolutely
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  We had a number of actual military men
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  On our film
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  That are part of a security team now
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  But these are all guys
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  That have had four, five, six tours
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  Of Iraq, Afghanistan
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  And the troops are awake
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  Let me mention something too
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  One of the messages in our movie
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  Was to tell the troops
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  That they don't have to obey
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  Unconstitutional orders
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  For example, if they're ordered
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  To fire an American citizen
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  Or disarm American citizens
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  In violation of the Second Amendment
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  That they should think about it
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  And this is what's neat about this
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  If they watch the movie
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  They're going to think about it now
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  They're going to think about
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  Well in advance from the time
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  That they're ordered to do it
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  And so getting them to
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  Spend some time on that now
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  May save us and them from
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  From obeying illegal orders
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  There's the Providence again
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  I wish you would have
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  I should have thought to record
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  That dinner we had and then
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  Talking at night after the shoot
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  Because it was, it's Providence
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  I mean, I cannot, I don't think
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  I've ever experienced something
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  This providential is that you
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  Literally in there with the sheriff
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  In there in the green room
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  While we're eating breakfast
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  The sheriff sitting there nodding
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  And they got some Texas Rangers
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  And stuff, you know, fans the operation
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  And you're going, you're in this presentation
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  And Alex, I've been talking to politicians
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  And I believe the Texas is going to be
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  The battleground for this
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  And we've got to put this film out
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  To warn people about what's coming
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  And it's my job to reach out to the governor
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  So he knows his place in history
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  To basically be this peaceful shot
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  Heard around the world
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  When they say no to the troops on the streets
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  And I'm going, well this could happen
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  Yeah, but I mean, wow
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  I mean, this guy's really put
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  As many words as his mouth is
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  But I was, and then now it's all happening
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  And the governor did it
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  And you said, I woke the governor up
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  And all these meetings you've had with him
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  And hanging out with him
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  And I mean, we're going to come back
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  And you're going to get the floor
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  And roll with the providence of your film
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  And again, tell people when it's coming out
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  In the name
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  Uh, the name of the film is the Marageddon
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  Marageddon
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  Marageddon
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  And we're looking at the end of the year
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  For a release
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  Yeah, because I was excited to be part of it
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  Once I got there, I got really excited
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  And I'm not kidding
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  I'm not kidding, this film
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  In case you missed it yesterday
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  The hashtag Black Lives Matter protest
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  Was interrupted by members of Red Guards Austin
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  A political organization that admits
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  They are a Marxist, Leninist, Maoist collective
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  These guardians of the people
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  Attempted to block other people's free speech
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  Yelled at them
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  And then even started to agitate
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  By bumping into people
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  Pushing people around
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  And even stealing and breaking
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  Some of our broadcast equipment
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  Luckily, it was all caught on camera
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  And we were able to explain to the cops what happened
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  If you go to the Red Guards Austin Facebook page
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  You can see pictures of some of these individuals
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  Who showed up yesterday
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  During the live broadcast, we were able to show
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  Facebook images of these individuals
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  Carrying communist sickles
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  Burning American flags
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  And basically trying to get everybody
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  Into a race war against the police
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  Of course, they were there dressed in all black
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  Saying, we're here for women's health
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  But then even on tape
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  They talked about how they loved to kill babies
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  Check out our YouTube videos on the Alex Jones channel

[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  Gary Haven, Mike Norris in the studio
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  And we're tweeting out right now at Real Alex Jones
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  Chuck Norris' son tells all
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  But he's going to tell us how cool Chuck Norris is
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  Because when you actually know the real Lord
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  He gets even cooler
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  Not just the Chuck Norris sayings
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  And all the rest of it
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  Simply amazing
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  That'd be a good bumper sticker
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  Chuck Norris
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  Listen to Infowars.com
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  Or how would you say it?
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  Infowars.com
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  Powered by Chuck Norris
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  But that would be kind of stealing his name
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  So I won't do that
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  But one of my producers was making that joke earlier today
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  It's like
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  I don't get giddy about celebrities
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  But Chuck Norris really is just so cool
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  And now he's fighting Jade Helm
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  And saying he doesn't trust Obama
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  And control the military
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  And the military's been training to go after patriots
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  We got Congressman Louis Gummert saying it
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  And Ted Cruz coming out and saying it
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  Which I thought was a big plus for him
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  And the governor leading the fight
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  And now Gary Haven
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  Then we shift into Chuck Norris
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  And movies and Christian films
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  For the balance of transmission
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  But Mr. Haven, founder of Curves
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  Founder of huge supplement companies, you name it
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  Out there trying to wake up the Republican Party
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  Trying to take it back
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  Trying to warn the people
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  Amerageddon coming out in November-December
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  Which literally predicts Jade Helm
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  Trapped events
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  You know, Red Dawn Part II
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  With the very player, simply amazing
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  In the film, you warn the military
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  Not to be taken over by the globalist
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  I mean, it is a clarion call
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  Provincial, I would call it
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  And you didn't just say I'm making it
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  Because it's a nebulous possibility
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  You said, I believe this is happening
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  And it was so convincing
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  You said it with such gravitas
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  That I got really excited
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  Buckley was there, my cousin
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  You'd leave the room
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  And I was like, my God
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  This is something special
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  This guy, and then you told me
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  I'm waking the governor up
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  And I'm waking him
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  You weren't bragging
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  You say, I'm on a mission
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  I've already given these people
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  Tens of millions of dollars
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  Trying to get him to stop selling out America
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  And keep our jobs here
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  But they won't do it
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  So now I'm going to start making films
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  I mean, Alex, you need to do this and that
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  So go through that providential stuff
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  In your meetings, multi-hour long meetings
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  With the governor, private meetings
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  You name it
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  And talking to him about this big choice
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  He would have coming up very soon
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  This was just four months ago
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  Yeah, let's start with what happened
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  This last two weeks
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  And for people that may not be aware
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  Ordered the Texas National Guard
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  To observe the military
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  These special ops that are doing Jade Helen
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  That's a remarkable thing
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  And he took tremendous ridicule
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  In the mainstream media
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  Over standing up and protecting his citizens
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  What a novel idea
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  Protect the citizens that elected you
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  I'm really proud of him
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  It took a lot of courage to do that
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  You know, we go back
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  I retired a couple of years ago
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  And was looking for something important to do
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  And I felt like that I had an opportunity
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  And a duty to educate people
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  To help them to influence the culture
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  And the greatest threat to our culture right now
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  Is the usurpation of our Constitution
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  That protects our freedoms
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  And so using media
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  Using movies which are entertaining
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  To teach people
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  Was what I decided to do
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  And of course I partnered with Mike Norris, Chuck's son
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  And we began to make movies
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  Now this movie, Mike and I were with the script
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  Over last year
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  We didn't realize how timely it was going to be
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  But the byline of the movie is a true story
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  That hasn't happened yet
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  And now here we are
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  We're in the editing process
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  And a lot of the things depicted in the movie
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  Are happening
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  For example, we talk about the National Defense
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  Authorization Act
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  That was passed over the last few years
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  Which completely takes away
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  Due process in our Constitution
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  Today in America
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  You can be arrested under nothing but suspicion
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  Of terrorism
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  And disappears
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  Incarcerated
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  Not be told where you are
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  That's exactly right
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  Not have legal defense
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  Not face your accuser
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  And you could be held indefinitely
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  That's insane in America
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  But it is in law
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  Codified in law today
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  And now the government is saying
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  It's for the veterans
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  And the gun owners and the Christians
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  Oh, how dare Governor Abbott be concerned
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  Or Chuck Norris or Louis Gohmert
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  How dare the congressman care
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  So getting people to become aware
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  Of what our government has done
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  To threaten their freedoms
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  Is really the mission we're on right now
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  This movie is helping us to accomplish that
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  Because it tells the story
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  And demonstrates it
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  It shows it
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  You know, as troops come to my ranch
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  And try to take my resources
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  And in fact, there's a great scene
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  You know, I'm a helicopter pilot
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  So I have a helicopter battle
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  With a Huey
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  Flown by the top helicopter
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  Stunt pilot in the world
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  And we do a dance in the sky
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  Where he's trying to get missile locks
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  I should add dangerous dance
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  From what I mean
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  This is
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  Oh, the executive producer
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  Is flying his own helicopter
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  39 cross women
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  15 feet from the other helicopter
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  It was so cool getting to do that
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  But you know, it's fun
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  And yet it's very serious
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  People need to wear what's really going on
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  And these are not, you know, things that might happen
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  This is stuff that's codified in the law today
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  That are a direct threat to our freedoms
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  So we're telling that story
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  And during a financial collapse
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  They say they're going to seize infrastructure
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  And land and have forced labor
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  And in this financial collapse
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  That is imminent
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  I mean, you can't print money
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  And buy your own debt indefinitely
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  If you could do that
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  Zimbabwe would be one heck of a success story
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  Or why more Germany?
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  Yeah
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  By the way, we have two curves in Zimbabwe
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  So I...
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  They're quite successful, by the way
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  So, you know, in my worldwide experience
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  Been in 90 countries
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  Including 200 locations in Ukraine
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  You know, it's really given me an insight
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  Much broader than it would expect
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  Aren't the Ukrainian ladies beautiful?
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  Oh, they all are over there
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  It's amazing
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  And I'd like to take a little credit for it
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  We've been there
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  Yeah, they're working out
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  Ending them up in helping them restore their beauty
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  But back to the governor
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  One of the opportunities I had
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  Was to really speak truth to power
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  And I believe the Texas government
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  Is an amazing thing
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  I was one of 150 people on the platform
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  On the podium when the governor gave his speech
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  And he and the lieutenant governor
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  They said to the public
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  And not a lot of people saw this
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  They said, we will sign no laws
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  That are not consistent with our Judeo-Christian values
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  You would not have heard that
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  From any platform in any state and country but Texas
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  In a world of universal deceit
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  Telling the truth of the Revolutionary Act
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  Towards our will
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  That's exactly right
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  Well, I believe that...
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  And I believe God has shown me that
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  Texas is going to be a sanctuary
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  God has given us good government
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  See, my uncle said that
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  Really?
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  Yeah, he died last year
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  But he was a very deep Christian
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  Very devout man, he believed that
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  You know, the Bible says
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  That there will be a place in the wilderness
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  For the woman
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  And I believe Texas is going to be
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  A place in the wilderness
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  For free-minded people to go to
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  So the real free state?
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  Yeah, and I believe it will happen
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  And I believe that I've been privileged
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  To spend time with the governor
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  And the attorney general, by the way
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  Who is the chief law enforcement officer of the state
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  To teach them
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  And prepare them for what's coming
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  And they've been very receptive
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  To what I've been talking about
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  So, and then we had the evidence
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  Well, Gary, you are slick
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  I'm ready to buy snow cones
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  And Antarctica right now
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  I feel like you have hotness in me
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  Gary, talk to people, listen
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  When you got the truth on your side
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  It's pretty interesting
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  And that's the beauty of it
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  And again, I commend you for telling the truth
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  Please continue
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  Well, we saw the evidence
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  To the governor being willing
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  To protect the citizens of his state
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  And repeat that, you told me
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  You said it earlier, but you got cut up by the break
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  I mean, because you told me this
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  Again, back in February
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  You just talked to him like a month before
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  Specifically, he was sworn in
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  Specifically, you said
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  You're going to have this challenge
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  It's going to happen
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  And then describe how he was like, really?
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  Yeah, keep in mind
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  When Greg Abbott was the attorney general of Texas
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  He sued the federal government 28 times
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  More than anybody has ever done before
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  Everything from the EPA
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  Coming into Texas, trying to dictate
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  He won the only 10 Commandments
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  Defense
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  He put thousands of DPS on the border
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  And they're calling him a cook
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  Trying to remove him
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  So this man is already very, very knowledgeable
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  In the overreach of the federal government
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  But I was in a meeting with him early on
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  And I said, you realize that the president
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  Can take command of the Texas National Guard
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  Away from you
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  And he didn't know that
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  And I showed him the evidence of it
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  Under National Defense Authorization Act
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  And he was pretty astounding
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  2007
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  Yeah
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  Well, the 2012 was really the nasty one
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  You're right
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  But it started with the John Warner Defense Authorization Act
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  And then Obama accelerated it
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  And they simply renewed it each year
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  And the Republicans have signed on to this
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  As well as the Democrats
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  That's kind of another topic
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  But let's touch on it
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  They'll go over it
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  We're going to skip this network break
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  Go ahead
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  You know, we know the Democrats are sold out socialists
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  They have bought the electorate
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  And you know your enemy, that's one thing
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  But the Republicans, the establishment Republicans
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  Are the enemy in our own camp
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  They're the real danger
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  I was explaining this to John Cornyn
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  Senator Cornyn from Texas
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  Tell the crowd right out there, there's a camera
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  I said, Senator, you've got one foot in the conservative camp
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  And one foot in the establishment camp
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  You need to make your mind up
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  Because you are an enemy in our camp
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  And you're more dangerous than an enemy on our border
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  And you've got to make your mind up
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  And he had an interesting response
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  Gary, I can't disagree with the thing you said
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  That's pretty astounding
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  Well, he admitted he's an enemy
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  Well, he admitted he's got one foot in the establishment camp
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  And so we've got to realize as American citizens
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  That the Republican Party is not our hope either
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  There is bought and paid for by the money
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  To interest as the Democrats
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  It's just that they still claim some pledge to freedom
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  Now there's a few good Republicans out there
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  You know, I feel good about Rand Paul and Louis Gomert
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  And Roger Williams is my personal congressman
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  I believe he's done some good things
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  But they're in the minority
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  Our solution to our country is not going to come into political realm
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  It's going to become, with a number of Americans waking up
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  And thinking critically
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  So that they can make informed decisions about what's going on out there
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  Evidence that's all around us
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  It's an info war
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  That's amazing you work that in
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  I mean, it's true, but specifically back to the Providence
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  So you're there with the governor
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  And you say you're going to have to make this decision on a federal takeover
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  I mean, you told me, you said I believe it's coming
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  And describe that conversation
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  Yeah, I said to, he was the attorney general about to be sworn in
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  And I said, you're going to be the most important governor in the history of Texas
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  And he said, how so? And he looked perplexed
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  And I said, because you're going to be in a position to have to decide
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  Whether to be compliant to an out of control federal government
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.000]  Or to stand for the rights and freedoms of the American, of the Texas citizens
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000]  And you can see his reaction to that
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000]  It was very, very meaningful to him
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  And just two weeks ago, we saw the evidence of him making that kind of decision
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000]  When he ordered the Texas National Guard to observe
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  All of these special ops groups that are going to be operating in Texas
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  Under the Jade Helm program
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000]  And quote doing suspicious things
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  And then they give speeches and admit this at one city council
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000]  And then go and speak in Bass Drop to the county council and say they never said any of that
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  I mean, it's just, we have their own document
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  You remember Jack LaLaine, the exorcist guy?
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  Yes
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  Most people do, he had the longest running teeth
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  He was a friend of mine
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  And he used to say that he always told the truth because he has such a poor memory
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  Me too, I tell you man
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  Well, all these people apparently have poor memories
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  You know, when you're trying to keep all these stories together that are not based in fact
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  You end up exposing it, that's why we have an opportunity to take our country back
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  Because the things that these people in power do are based on deceit
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  And they can't get away with it if enough people are thinking clearly
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  Well, and that's why they want to make the world so complex and confusing with all these false stories
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  Because I'm 41, in the past I had a near photographic memory with text
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  And on also photos
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  Now it's from stress and everything else, it's still a good memory but not as good
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  They say you can make a couple hundred decisions a day and then you start getting fuzzy
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  And that's why I want to work till seven or eight at night
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  But after that I just, it doesn't work anymore
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  I mean, it's like I'm kind of done, or I go take a nap
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  But people, my kids ask me questions or family does
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  And I caught myself the last few years, I go, oh yeah, yeah, this is how it is
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  Not lying on purpose, but not being able to remember, so just saying something
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  And now I've just learned how to just go, I don't remember or I got to think about that
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  And I guess it's something you have to get used to, and now I realize when I asked my grandpa
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  Somebody would go, ah, just, yeah, because you know, you just, you don't want to
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  It's that you've got the knowledge, you just don't want to dredge it all up
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  And I think that's where they've gotten the American people
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  Where they're just so poleaxed with so much data that they kind of just curl up in a ball
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  What I'm saying is, don't curl up in a ball, go read what the globalists are saying
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000]  On the Council of Foreign Relations and Club of Rome and Bilderberg and Davos
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  They're in the news today calling for planetary government run by them
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000]  That's though, because that's in scholarly papers between themselves
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  Then they have seen an income out and say it doesn't exist, but if you just
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  All we do is go pass them to the executive orders, to the Jade Helm document
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  To the, as a corporate executive, you go to the bottom line
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  To the corporate papers, I mean, you just get passed all the flim flam
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  And all the stuff to the heart of the matter
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  Yeah, just stay on message is what we all have to do
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  You know, I have, at my age I have more of a Polaroid memory
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  I have to take the picture and let it sit there and develop
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  Exactly, I don't quite remember it
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  But people, if they stay on the basic facts, which is, you know
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  You're not getting the truth from the media it's bought and paid for
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  If we're over in Ukraine picking a fight with a nuclear opponent
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  It's probably not the best idea
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  So these are not concepts that are complicated or too difficult
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  But stay on message and really think about the things that are important
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  Printing money to buy your own debt, you know, it's a real simple concept
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  You don't have to understand derivatives and all that kind of stuff
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  Just a bad idea, no country in history has been able to do it and survive
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  How far do you think it can go?
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  I mean, how much, because obviously we've gone past Weimar, past Zimbabwe
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  In the total real metric of money digital issuances
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  Now they've got computers and more manipulative systems
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  But we're seeing the signs of it everywhere
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  I mean, how far, as a real business expert
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  You know, a guy who bootstraps started one of the most successful chains in history
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  In other corporations, which I was reading online in Forbes
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  He started dozens of different successful companies
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  And I really respect that
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  That's rockstar to me
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  You know, it's people that are actually entrepreneurs
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  You know, I know Paul Gioria
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  I mean, I think he's a rockstar, he's a patriot as well
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  But kind of keeps it on the low down a little bit
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  He lives here in Austin
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  Absolutely, I bet you know him
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  I don't want to speak for him
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  We could probably get him on the show
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  I just kind of, anyways, I'm not going to get into that
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  But I know him
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  How far can it go?
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  Let me give you two answers real quick
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  This is a great example that I shared with Senator Corn in dinner one day
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  If you took the spending of the United States government
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  And you took away all the zeroes
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  And let's take the three and a half trillion
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  That they spent this year
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  And you reduced it to $35,000
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  That would be the spending, annual spending
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  Of our household budget
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  And then we took in two trillion in taxes
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  And that two trillion includes the trust fund
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  For social security and Medicare
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  That's supposed to be set aside and say, there's no trust fund
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  And there's a good example too
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  There is no trust fund, there's just IUs
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  There's no Social Security fund, there's no Medicare fund
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  It's gone, spent, spent in the general budget
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  But if your income is $20,000
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  Which is two trillion without the zeroes
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  And you're spending $35,000
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  Which is three and a half trillion without the zeroes
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  You know, how long can your household manage that budget?
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  Now here's the other problem
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  You've got 18 trillion in debt that has to be serviced every month
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  So your credit card is $180,000
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  So you're making $20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  You're trying to service $180,000,000
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  If you're a household you'd be bankrupt
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  And then if you took the unfunded liabilities
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  It's not just the $18 trillion our government does
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  It's the Social Security
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  It's the federal pensions, it's all the other things
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  And it's a minimal, conservatively, $100 trillion
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  But if you took $100 trillion and you divided
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  Among 100 million American families
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  Which is how many of us there are
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.840]  are. That's a million dollars per family. Let's go further. Now there's 2.2 quadrillion globally
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:15.080]  in fake derivatives that we don't know that they say we do. The U.S. they say it's half of those.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:21.960]  So 1.1 trillion. If you add 1.1 trillion to 100 trillion, that's 1.2 trillion. Can we divide
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:26.200]  that to 100 million households please? I can't do it. I don't see any either. Guys, can you or the
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:32.600]  calculator do? I don't even think the calculator goes that high, but I think it does. But divide
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:40.920]  1.2 quadrillion, 1,200 trillion into 100 million. There you go. It's going to be a big number.
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:45.720]  You know what it is? It's probably 10 million dollars per household. But you know, just to keep
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:50.120]  it simple, you know, the real, the things that I think the average American get the hand around
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:55.880]  for 12 million. A million bucks per family, the average family makes 50,000 a year. How
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:01.400]  are we going to pay that debt off? It's mathematically impossible. Well, their answer is army,
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:06.040]  tanks, checkpoints, and forced labor. It's clowered and pebbin. They collapse everything. We'll be
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:09.240]  begging for troops when there's people running around, burning everything. And you got the
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:13.800]  Justice Department in there taking some problems that are there, stirring it up for a war on police,
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:17.400]  just like Ukraine, just like they financed the overthrow there. They're getting ready to do it
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:22.600]  here. And I'll be saying bring the troops in. I mean, you know, they've got to figure it out.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:30.120]  Now, shifting gears into Mike Norris. And he said, Hey, I don't mind talking about my dad.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.040]  He was talking about him, you know, like he's his, you know, biggest hero when we were at
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:38.040]  dinner and stuff, because he said, Hey, wouldn't be or wasn't for Chuck Norris. Chuck Norris,
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:42.600]  incredibly private guy. You were telling me amazing stuff. I talked to some Hollywood stunt
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:47.000]  drivers and people that I know. They go, Oh, yeah, it's all true and more. He's just over the top.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.400]  Some of the behind the scenes stuff, or I mean, some of it's so cool. I don't even know if you
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:56.120]  can even tell these stories. I mean, and then Steve McQueen and everything else over the top.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:02.280]  Into the fucking, we're celebrating Americana. What is more Americana than,
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:07.400]  than Chuck Norris? Maybe John Wayne? No, I don't think so. Cause John Wayne was a patriot, but he
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:14.520]  really wasn't the Taekwondo champion and all the rest of it. Tell us what's going on with the
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:23.240]  current Chuck Norris planet. I mean, there's this planet Norris. Yeah, yeah, it is. You know, it's
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:31.800]  so great being Chuck Norris' son. When I was 13, 14 years old, it was just like this, a front seat
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:39.880]  to see in a movie star being created. And you know, in a strange way, it's kind of a lot like
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:46.520]  what's going on now. It was perfect timing in the late seventies, early eighties for a new American
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:53.320]  hero to be born. And that was my dad. My dad was that new American. He's the new John Wayne.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:29:01.080]  And it was great. It was what a blessing to watch this happen and how it changed my world.
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:07.480]  You know, as kids, my dad was a karate teacher. So every Friday, Saturday and Sunday,
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:12.360]  we packed up in the station wagon. We went to a car dealership, did a karate demonstration,
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:16.920]  trying to get students into the car. Of course, he'd been in the military before that, an MP.
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:22.520]  Yeah. He was in Korea. He learned karate in Korea. Stay there. You have the floor. We return.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:27.240]  Promise. We may have to go. We need to get you some water, whatever. But Mike Norris is here
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:32.520]  and it's exciting. I want you, I heard two hours of it, but I want you to get to hear some of this
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:39.160]  stuff because it's amazing. And we'll be back, ladies and gentlemen with Mike Norris. You can
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:47.400]  just actually go over and just pat him and there he is right there. We'll be back. We're not worth it.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:54.040]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:30:03.240]  I think you've got nothing to hide. Well, a group of activists is challenging that mentality
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:09.400]  by placing hidden tape recorders throughout New York to protest the NSA. The campaign called
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:15.560]  We Are Always Listening is currently collecting private conversations of unsuspecting citizens
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:20.760]  and then uploading those intimate conversations online in an attempt to discredit that nothing
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:25.880]  to hide narrative. The group's website says, citizens don't seem to mind this monitoring,
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:32.040]  so we're hiding recorders in public places in hopes of gathering information to help win the war
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:37.640]  on terror. The site encourages those who are angry about surveillance to contact Congress
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:43.160]  as section 215 of the Patriot Act reaches expiration on June 1st. You can listen to some
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:48.120]  of those audio recordings embedded in the article, activist place hidden tape recorders
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:55.000]  throughout New York to protest NSA at infowars.com. This is Leanne McAdoo reporting for infowars.com.

[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:19.400]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:35.160]  Don't think Mr. Gray that we don't know what you're up to. Stockpiling food, weapons, fuel,
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:40.280]  the national defense authorization act is there to stop domestic terrorist threats to this country
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:34:05.160]  and people like you. I am an American. I am a patriot. You, sir, are nothing but a traitor.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:11.320]  That little rant will be all over the news tonight. You must understand this place into our hands.
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:18.920]  The American news media has our narrative and at that narrative, Charlie Gray is perfectly
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:24.440]  playing the role of right wing extremist. The stigma of that label will stop up the use of the
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:35.080]  American public faster than any propaganda we could fashion. America getting hitting theaters and your
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:40.760]  online viewing as well. Are there with the Netflix? You name it on the online systems,
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:47.320]  TV systems coming up in November, December of 2015 could not be a better time. It deals with
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:52.520]  internationalist globalist using the federal government to basically bring in a creeping
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:57.640]  tyranny and a seizure of the infrastructure of the country, just like the TPP is doing. And if we
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:03.640]  ever try to say no, then they bring in the force. Now, without further ado, we've got Gary Haven in
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:08.840]  here, entrepreneur, the creator of the largest successful franchise in world history, according
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:13.720]  to Forbes Curves, which he retired from a few years ago. And then of course we have Mike Norris,
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:19.400]  20 plus films, some of the top Christian films, other films, TV shows, mainline TV shows he's
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:23.160]  produced, of course working with his father and others, but doing a lot of his own productions,
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:27.560]  that is Mike Norris. Okay, we've only got this segment and one more, maybe a little bit of overdrive.
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:30.360]  You've been a trooper sitting there while we talk about the New World Order, but thank you for
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:35.800]  coming down to Austin from Dallas for folks that just joined us. Mike Norris, tell us about the
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:43.160]  real Chuck Norris, because a bunch of this stuff's not known. Wow, the real Chuck Norris is even cooler
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:51.000]  than what we heard. You know, he really is an amazing man that has done so many amazing things,
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:56.200]  not only for the country, for the troops, but for his family and for his friends.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:03.480]  Just a huge blessing, just a huge blessing. Absolutely. Well, I mean, you told us so many
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:08.360]  of the stories, and I don't think you even need that airpiece they can take. It's just dangling
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:12.920]  there. I know it's hard to talk about your dad, but it's also fun. When we were sitting around
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:17.400]  eating Mexican food though, you were telling the stories. Where should we begin? Let's start at the
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:21.480]  beginning, you know, where you just ended, driving in the station wagon every weekend
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:27.080]  to recruit folks for karate class. Yeah, and it was my dad and I, we had this routine we did
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:32.280]  together, you know, we'd be walking across each other, he'd bump into me, we'd do a fight scene,
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:40.440]  and you know, we'd go go to Chuck Norris Karate schools. So he ended up losing his karate schools,
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:44.760]  and he was teaching Steve McQueen private lessons, and Steve goes,
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:49.480]  why don't you just become an actor? And he's like, I can't talk in front of people. He says,
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:52.600]  let everybody else do all the talking, you say what's important.
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:59.960]  And that's kind of how Chuck Norris started in the cinema. But while that was all taking place,
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:05.320]  we'd go out to California, we'd go motorcycle riding with Steve McQueen. I'll never forget,
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:11.880]  Steve McQueen, tighter rope around his stomach. I was on an Indian motorcycle, and I was going in
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:15.880]  circles, and he was just teaching me how to ride a motorcycle at nine years old.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:20.520]  I'm like going, wow, this is pretty cool. I talked to folks in Hollywood, and they say
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:26.680]  Steve McQueen is hands down the coolest ever. Had to be. Had to be. He was great. He was great.
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:33.720]  And later on in life, his son and I, Chad, did a movie together. It was really fun. My dad had a
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:39.640]  lot of very interesting people that he taught karate to. Bob Barker is a black belt. He did
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:46.360]  that fight scene in that Adam Sandler movie, Happy Madison. Knocked him out. And so as a kid,
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:51.160]  I just get up, I go with my dad. I'll sit there. He teaches class. We go home, go home together.
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:57.560]  It was when he started making films that it was just such a meteoric rise. It was
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:04.840]  like we were talking about our country at that time needed a hero. And our country at this time
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:11.640]  needs a wake up call. And that's what we're providing for the country. What my dad did back then.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:17.400]  Yeah, because the globalists were putting us through a process of demonizing America,
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:22.840]  blaming America's problems on Americana when Americana was the answer to the globalist poison.
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:27.880]  Just like they're doing now. He was a pro America hero that people needed. And notice
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:31.160]  today he's speaking out against the globalists. Let's get into Bruce Lee.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:43.640]  Bruce Lee. Wow. My dad and Bruce met a number of times. And there's a lot of stories that you
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:47.480]  could read online about my dad and Bruce training. Yeah, but you told us something nobody knows.
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:55.000]  Tell us some of those. No, I fought in a karate tournament and I'd won. And my dad was going
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.240]  to fight that night. But Bruce Lee was there. And I'm getting a picture with Bruce Lee. I'm like,
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:05.400]  oh my gosh, this is Bruce Lee, but I'll never forget. There was a guy in the audience and he
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:10.680]  kept looking and staring like looking back at the guy. And finally Bruce just grabbed my face
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:16.200]  and put it forward like this and we snapped the picture. And it was amazing. And to this day,
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:24.040]  I still have that picture of Bruce Lee. But growing up in our household was very adventurous.
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:31.880]  For some reason, my father was a magnet for anybody that needed help. And we shared a lot
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:37.560]  of stories. And there are all things I could say over here. It is no problem. But a Sunday morning,
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:43.080]  I'm 11 years old, there's somebody banging on the front door. And I come to the front door,
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:46.920]  I open up and there's some guy there with a summer eye sword going, where's Chuck Norris?
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:55.560]  So people wanted to come fight him. These are his people my dad knew that if they were in trouble
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:40:00.600]  or something, they all showed up at our house. I don't know why my dad could give him advice.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:05.800]  Well, he was a guru. He really was. And you know, here's a guy standing with a summer eye sword.
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:14.600]  And I just looked at him, I go, dad. Oh, my dad comes down, talks a guy down, gets him out of
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:19.320]  there. Oh, we've had people come stay at our house and said they were relatives spent the night.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:25.480]  We're all stuck in a bedroom. My mom, my dad, my brother and I and and my dad's going to my mom
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:31.640]  going, don't you understand? I can kick this guy's butt. And he's got control of the house.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:34.920]  And we're locked in a little room. We've got some guy walking around the house saying,
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:42.200]  he's our uncle Gene from Oklahoma. We had tons of stories like that. It was so exciting to especially
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:47.880]  like just kind of go back to that time when life was simple. And when did your dad become,
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:50.840]  you know, from kind of a mainline conservative Constitutionist, I know he's a big fan of the
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.720]  founding fathers or his columns. I read one of one he wrote fears it was great about, you know,
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:59.480]  why we need another George Washington or more George Washington's. When did his views, when did
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:06.840]  he become aware of the new world order, the globalist, the larger program? You know, I think
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:13.960]  that really came on after we were done doing Walker, Texas Ranger, when in a sense he kind of retired
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:21.880]  really from acting is after Walker. I don't recall him. And we did Expendables, but you know, I think
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:28.680]  after Walker, it gave him time to kind of read, reflect, investigate. He's always been political.
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:34.200]  He's been, you know, I've been great friends with the presidents. I don't want to speak for him.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:37.720]  He's been on the show a few times, you know, six, seven, eight years ago and a few years ago,
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:43.320]  but he listens quite a bit. Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely. And I called him while we were filming. I go,
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:49.000]  dad, Alex Jones is coming to play a part in our movie. And he was so excited. He goes, really,
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.600]  I tell Alex, I love him. I listen to show all the time. I'm like, I will. So it's just bizarre to
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:59.960]  have Chuck Norris a regular listener. You told me a lot of other stories. I don't know how many
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:06.760]  of these we can tell. Well, I didn't tell you anything. Oh, it was all good. It was all good.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:15.160]  No, no, it was all really good. But it's exciting. And, and I consider it
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:23.320]  a privilege. And I also consider it a responsibility of being Chuck Norris' son,
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:29.400]  because I'm not only representing myself, I am representing my family, which is my father,
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:34.360]  which is my children, which is Gary. I mean, well, your dad's got to be proud of you fighting
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:37.000]  the globalists like you are right now and putting out these great Christian films.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:43.640]  He's well, he's really excited. He's excited that obviously, you know, Gary, a guy, you know,
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:49.880]  let me remember when Mike shared with him that we were going to do this movie,
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:53.320]  he asked you one question. Are you willing to die for it?
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:59.000]  Oh, now we're getting to some of the stories. Are you willing to die for this movie?
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:05.800]  Because that's how important this script was. Chuck Norris said that. Yes.
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:13.880]  Wow. Yeah. What do you mean by that? Who is the director on that anti-establishment film that
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:20.040]  was killed? Well, Dinesh Yasuda just got locked up. A bunch of people are getting killed. In Minnesota,
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:25.560]  a 32-year-old veteran was making movie Gray State. Oh yeah, they definitely are. No, it's
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:28.760]  bad. I know, I believe me. I'm not trying to act like we're in danger or anything,
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:32.440]  because I want to freak people out. But I mean, this is a real deal.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:36.040]  I'll share that. We were filming, middle filming, and we pick up the newspaper,
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:42.120]  and this young director was found in this home with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:47.160]  wound along with his five-year-old daughter and his wife. The people that it was suspicious,
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:51.160]  people who knew him said, this is impossible. He was excited. Just like the state center that
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:54.680]  was exposed in the pedophile rings was coming on my show. The next week we covered at the start
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:44:00.440]  of the show, she got executed at her house in a murder suicide. So when we heard this, I told Mike,
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:08.280]  I said, man, I'm glad I'm not the director on this movie. Well, you know, they're scared of
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:12.840]  movies and your dad's right. So your dad thinks this is a dangerous film. Oh, absolutely. But
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:21.080]  he was saying, go for it. He was warning you. I think he was proud. I think we need to be more
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:25.640]  bold. I agree. We need to speak up. Now, well, look, you're doing some bold stuff right now.
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:32.120]  And I got full disclosure. A lot of my knowledge has come from Gary. Don't blame me.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:42.360]  All the money's come from Gary. We got to make this film hit big. Yeah. And it's coming together
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:47.000]  good. And that's why it's fun to come in here, kind of talk about it. And you play such a key
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:53.800]  role in the opening of the film. And that's a long scene. Well, that's that was just a minute,
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:45:00.760]  but it was long and powerful. It sets up the rest of the movie. So instead of having like
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:05.080]  Blade Runner where there's a long narration about replicants of the future, you're not copy
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:09.240]  your little people. This is done in a congressional hearing where you really get everything.
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:13.720]  Absolutely. It was really smart. And again, who wrote that area? I wrote that scene. Yeah.
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:18.840]  And in fact, I'll kind of restate it. That's a smart way to introduce the film. Yeah. And the
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:26.040]  movie opens where I'm the Charlie Gray, the kind of the star and the hero of the movie. And I'm
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:33.320]  in front of a Senate hearing and Alex plays an evil senator. Very, very. And we have a debate.
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.520]  I'm challenging the government to do something about protecting America from its most imminent
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:44.680]  threat. This is real life. That's an EMP attack on electromagnetic pulse. And I'm calling his
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:50.920]  attention that the Congress has already determined it's the number one threat. And he is ridiculing
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:59.080]  me, which is what the strategy of those people do. And so we have this opening scene where you get
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:04.360]  a gist of what the movie's going to be about and what you should be concerned about. And you also
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:09.880]  get to see the political establishment to kind of poo poo this whole thing. And it's a great way
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:16.760]  to kind of get up to speed about what you're about to watch. Well, it's dynamite. The whole
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:22.760]  thing's powerful. And if we just had more people doing this, I tell you, you can launch a whole
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:28.440]  new genre of Patriot cinema. And just like, I mean, now I'll see in the top box office,
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:33.560]  of the top 50 films or so, like 10 of them are Christian. And a lot of these have really good
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:38.920]  messages. And so that means we're starting to have victories against these people. Yeah. And I'm
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:45.000]  wondering if there's maybe a sliver in Hollywood that could be a wake because they have dropped
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  tents in other big Hollywood film. Oh, more and more. We're seeing the people talk about the
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.080]  New World Order, like the Captain America Winter Soldier. Yeah, exactly. I mean, that whole thing
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:59.160]  is exposing, you know, the hydra system and what it's doing and how it's taking our rights and the
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:03.080]  NSA. I mean, well, you're in you're on Hollywood. So I mean, you know, and if people are awake out
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:06.120]  there, I mean, that's the thing is it came out in the news that there's thousands of
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:12.040]  closet libertarians and conservatives cloth have cloth secret meetings. Yeah. Because they're not
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:21.480]  communist. And it goes, it goes a lot deeper in Hollywood than that. As far as the agenda in
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:30.200]  Hollywood, how you're starting to go, skip the network break. Oh, come on. No, okay.
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:39.400]  It is there is an agenda in Hollywood. Right. We know what the agenda is. It's in the family.
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:51.240]  It's to it's to it's a it's a gay agenda. It's a demonic agenda. I saw that firsthand as an 18
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:59.000]  year old, you know, back in the 80s, my dad was making movies and hey, let's make this movie with
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:04.440]  Mike Norris and we'll just put Norris up on the thing. And I was like, great, I'm all in. So I
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:11.400]  was making these movies, but I was exposed at 18, 19 years old to agents that they were going to make
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:19.320]  my future. I said, if this is what it's going to take, I'm done. And so I just kind of did my
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:24.120]  own thing, lose my own films and try to Well, the issue is it's a cult. I mean, they make you
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:30.040]  get involved in this. They do. And if you want to be successful, if you want to be successful,
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:38.760]  and they make you do horrendous things to be part of that culture out there. I don't want it. I live
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:45.080]  in Texas. My kids are Texans. We're going to write right here in Texas. Hollywood. And by the way,
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:48.040]  you know, because we know some of those people, some of the biggest names in Hollywood, and they're
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:52.360]  all locked their houses scared. Oh, yeah. I mean, people, it's not like everybody's evil out there.
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:56.760]  They're all scared that there are a lot of good people in Hollywood, but they are scared. You
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:03.560]  know, it's do you want to make a dollar? Or do you want to be honest? And everybody there wants
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:08.040]  to make a dollar. Great. We all want to make money. We all want to live. But I want to do it
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:13.480]  with a purpose. Well, Mark Cuban, and this came out in the New York Times a year after I talked
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:19.800]  about it, was going to put like $15 million into a rollout on a thousand screens of loose change
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:25.880]  of film that I produced, partially produced. And it was down over 100 million times. They
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:29.640]  saw that and he said, yeah, I think false flags. And I was there in some phone conversations with
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:34.440]  him and man, all these lawyers came to the meeting. And I mean, Jake Bloom, you know, the
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:38.600]  biggest guys in Hollywood, I'm not going to get into the rest of the names. And I mean,
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:45.160]  it was like something out of good fellows. And then the White House was involved and I'm told,
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:50.280]  yeah, they're threatening everybody. And then they basically indict Mark Cuban. And then it all
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:53.480]  came out in the New York Times later that they called him and sent emails that were going to get
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:58.840]  you, you bastard. You know, you know, we send messages. Jake Bloom wasn't involved in that.
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:02.920]  He was just some of these meetings. I'm just saying, what a character. And Subna Redstone's
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:06.920]  top representative, you know, I'm not going to get another names that were there. But I mean,
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:11.160]  I've just seen it firsthand. I mean, this is not a game. No, no, no, no, this is a game. No, no,
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:18.040]  no, this is this is not a game. And media is impacting our culture in such a huge way right
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:26.120]  now with the music with the just what you can pull up on the internet right now. So we have to,
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:32.840]  you know, we, yeah, there are problems that we need to address and that, you know, issues that are
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:38.040]  that Gary's passionate about that I'm able to kind of help facilitate that things that I'm a
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:43.560]  passionate about that Gary is able to help facilitate me. So it's really been a huge blessing
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:48.760]  for him and I to come together. Absolutely. We're so much you've got a lot of websites. What's
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:52.280]  no, no, no, no. What's the best one? You know what? I'll talk about some of your new films. I
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:56.520]  want you to do it. Well, we've got we've got a film out right now that's called Missionaries with
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:51:02.760]  Tom Arnold, Jamie Kennedy, Paul Rodriguez, Gigi Rice about a family of flying missionaries.
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:10.280]  It's released by Pierre Flicks who did God's Not Dead. Do you believe that's in any Christian
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:16.280]  bookstore anywhere in the world and soon coming to TV? The answer is you've got to get all these
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:19.480]  to support the industry that's countering the globalist and then so your kids have something
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:24.360]  good to watch. Absolutely. Absolutely. I want to shift gears back into any other Steve McQueen
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:33.640]  stories anymore. Come on. Chuck Norris. People want this lore. Yeah. This Cromulan lore. Okay.
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:41.400]  I'm 19, 20, 21, somewhere in there and we used to train. We'd meet at my dad's house every morning
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:48.280]  seven o'clock and we'd train. We had this guy named Jean-Claude Van Damme driving a little piece of
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:55.080]  junk rabbit up the street getting out. We had Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, myself. I mean,
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:52:00.600]  all these, not me, but all these really great people. So we trained. Oh, I mean, every morning
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:04.040]  hours and we were in great shape and I'll never forget one day my dad goes,
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:09.480]  he let's all kind of spar around together and I'm like, okay, great. So, you know, I'd spar with
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:15.160]  Van Damme. We'd spar around then. My dad and I kind of come up and we're sparring and I go,
[01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:21.320]  oh boy, he kind of kicked me hard right there. So I kind of throw one back in Van Damme. No, my dad.
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:27.800]  Oh, I killed Van Damme. But uh, and so I go, God, boy, that kick was awfully hard by my dad.
[01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:31.320]  And so I kind of threw one back and my dad, like all of a sudden this,
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:39.400]  you know, came on. And next thing I know, it was like, and I'm on my back
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:45.080]  and I'm looking up at my dad looking over at me and I just kind of look up when I go, mom.
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:51.560]  And boy, did I learn a very valuable lesson. I was talking to Joe Rogan, who in his own right
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:56.760]  was a champion in Taekwondo God in his way, in those of UFC. And he was saying, he was saying,
[01:52:56.760 --> 01:53:01.960]  if Chuck Norris was going 25, 30 today, he'd be a top UFC contender because he was the smartest
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:08.680]  fighter. He wasn't the strongest. He wasn't the fastest. He was the smartest. And that is something
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:17.240]  I admire so much about my dad is he will set one goal and he will fight and go after that one goal.
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:23.080]  If it's picking up this coffee cup, man, he will make that happen. But my father's lived that as
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:30.440]  a creed his whole life, setting goals for yourself and achieving small goals at a time for the ultimate
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:37.320]  plan. So these are awesome things that I've been able to take away from my father and implement
[01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:43.880]  into my own life, as well as a lot of things Gary has brought into my wife, Valerie and I's world
[01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:49.640]  with our kids, just having somebody. You guys are good buddies. You know what? He's the best. I
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:53.880]  mean, you guys have no idea if you really got to spend some time with them. Oh, he's definitely
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:57.960]  magnetic. Yes. He was saying he's going to mentor me on some business stuff. I really appreciate it.
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:03.240]  Yeah. Oh, gosh. Anyways, we're about to finish up this hour to five minutes over. We're gonna get
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:10.120]  some lunch. You guys have been awesome. But specifically, I mean, he writes about it world
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:14.680]  that daily. And I guess we could try to get your dad back on. I know he's just been super busy.
[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:20.600]  I don't like to bug him a lot of the ranch. Absolutely. But but I guess he likes Huckabee.
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:25.320]  And I saw Huckabee come out and criticize the TSA the other day. I think, you know,
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:27.960]  he said, why are we groping grandma? We got ISIS terrorists attacking.
[01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:36.360]  I wish Chuck Norris would run for president. Yeah, you know what? I think I think what he's
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:41.480]  doing is going to help us much more than if Chuck Norris were president. No, I hear you.
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:45.640]  Let me ask you this question. Did you did you ever see your dad outside of a match
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:53.080]  have to like defend himself or somebody else and take somebody out? I saw him come very close one
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:59.880]  time. And one thing my dad is a master of is self control. He said he was good like Obi-Wan
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:05.560]  Kenobi at diffusing things. Absolutely. That is greatest trait is he could he could look at somebody
[01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:11.960]  and know, am I going to have to beat this guy's butt or can I talk him down? Did that come from
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:21.560]  being a cop? I think it's part of his soul. My dad has a very kind soul and he always wants
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:29.480]  to help somebody. And I just think that comes from his DNA of wanting to help people. And
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:34.120]  he's been great. He's been great at it. So it's just Steve McQueen. When you think about your dad,
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:37.960]  Steve McQueen, give me a Steve McQueen Chuck Norris story. I know what Steve McQueen got him
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:44.600]  into Hollywood, right? Yeah, you know, gosh, really the ones I know best are the ones that I'm
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:50.920]  involved in. Unfortunately, you know, going out to Indian dunes in California and riding motorcycles,
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:58.680]  his son Chad was a great motorcycle rider, went on to do films, just lost Steve McQueen way too
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:04.280]  soon. You know, way too soon. He was a young man when he died. How old was he? I'm thinking his
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:10.840]  fifties. Steve McQueen was in his fifties when he died. I think, right? Yeah, some long, long time
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:21.160]  ago. But it was a whole soup of Donnie and Marie Elvis. Yeah, I saw Elvis. He's alive. Well, he
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:28.520]  was in 72. Tell me your Elvis story. You know, I'm not into Hollywood and high, but these are
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:40.600]  Americana. Okay, Elvis. Okay, you know, we all know about Elvis's wife leaving Elvis for a karate guy.
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:47.080]  Yeah. And these are all people in our immediate world, as a kid, Mike Stone.
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:53.160]  These are all like this. I mean, that's like, for someone to leave and Gary to come to me.
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:57:03.560]  There's not much chance of that. But it was just fun. And you know, it's fun to reflect back and go,
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:08.120]  wow, you know, none of us knew this was going to happen. You know, my dad's just teaching and
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:13.560]  had a punching kick. And look what what has happened now and how blessed I am to be able
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:19.000]  to carry on that legacy. Elvis, you thought Elvis showed up? Yeah. Tell me this story.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.720]  You know what? He came to a karate class. He had about 30 guys with him. It was up in
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:28.520]  the Hollywood, one of my dad's karate schools up near Hollywood.
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:35.560]  He kind of came in with his entourage and slick silk karate uniform. Oh my goodness.
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:40.760]  He got me kicks and it was out of there. Hey, yeah, just but it was the king. You know,
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:46.600]  the bizarreness of America then. Yeah. But it was a real bizarreness. It was organic. Now it's all
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:52.760]  fake. I, you know, I'm trying to catch up with social media. I try. I've got, I think,
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:59.720]  four Twitter people following. What is your Twitter to quote Governor Perry?
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:04.760]  What is my Twitter? I have no idea. I have no idea what my tweet is. He calls it Twitter handle.
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:09.640]  Yeah, it's Twitter handle. He calls it Twitter, Twitter, Twitter. My kids do it. Hey, we're not
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:14.520]  going to, but your dad, I hear it does not have a temper either. That makes her casting. Yeah,
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:21.480]  okay. I've had a number of flying objects come at me on a movie set from my dad. I unfortunately,
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:26.600]  one time yelled cut too soon. So he's Jen on one side, but the others are you one of the dragon?
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:32.520]  Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. And it's, you know what? I miss son. So he could throw a walkie.
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:36.440]  Hey, I have a temper. I threw one of these microphones yesterday. Hold on. We'll be right back.

[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:11.640]  mainstream media government coverups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:20.600]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:36.200]  the enemy is showing itself more and more globalism is out of the open and it is
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:46.760]  legendary it is epic it is biblical that Texas is resisting
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:54.840]  the way it is my uncle that died last year this is total sweetheart
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:01:04.360]  vietnam helicopter veteran pilot with special operations taught me so much of what i know
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:07.640]  my dad taught me probably more but my uncle was a close second
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:15.880]  he listened to pastor david j smith which i think is still around every time i listen to him
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:21.240]  i've been walks of hatching and smith wasn't the type that was constantly saying he had visions
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:25.560]  about this and visions about that but he was kind of a mainline preacher i think it was up in
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:30.680]  oklahoma like 30 something years ago and he had a vision that a world government was going to take
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:40.040]  over and that texas would be a stronghold against it and my uncle said that with his discernment
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:47.000]  and prayer that he knew that was true and that this is what i was already on the year
[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:54.760]  and that basically i should tell people that and try to help folks make preparation for it
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:59.800]  of course i never did i've never spoken of this until now and then now i just see texas across
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:08.600]  the board resisting and the first place to start where the giant the sleeping giant is
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:16.600]  starting to wake up as world government and smart dust and in tv's watching everybody i mean my god
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:25.080]  global abortion uh just like i said the none of us are safe when the veterans can be put on
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:29.560]  don't treat list and they just spend the whole thing like oh the va screwed up that'd be like
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:34.200]  st jeffrey domers screwed up no he didn't screw up man it was premeditated john wane gasey was
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:40.600]  premeditated ted body was premeditated i'm tired of it and i'll be honest with you i don't like
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:46.680]  messing with these dangerous people but if you're gonna mess with them because they're not
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:51.400]  gonna quit messing with us you better go all the way and that's just all i can tell you is
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:57.560]  man i wish every day i'd been wrong about all this stuff
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:01.160]  i mean i wish every day
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:07.400]  that i was wrong and you know what i wasn't wrong about any of it don't tell you why i wasn't
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:13.640]  wrong about any of it because i i just began studying this and getting on the trail of it
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:23.480]  after all these great people john birchers fbi agents cops people like my uncle scholars like
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:30.600]  my dad countless other people when i was a kid talked about all this and my heavenly father
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:38.520]  i cannot believe how right they were and how they were fighting so hard back then when nobody
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:43.400]  knew the federal reserve was private and nobody knew what was going on to warn people
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:46.600]  so we'd have a defense down the road when all of this came down
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:54.760]  because once the shields fall and real tyranny comes in they're coming after everybody folks
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:59.880]  and i don't mean people that just fought evil they hate anyone who is upright and beautiful and
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:06.200]  strong and who has built something these people have a will to dominate the next guy we got
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:16.280]  coming up gets persecuted for planting city gardens they just hate normal human life men and women
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:26.440]  loving each other families gardening farmers ranching metallurgy physical fitness uh wholesomeness
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:30.840]  they just and it doesn't mean those of us that want wholesomeness are on some high horse or
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:38.440]  perfect it just means we want to gravitate towards that and and there look there's not room for both
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:47.160]  groups of evil and good you understand that the evil wants to extinct good and to see the amazing
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:54.200]  awakening happening is buoying and invigorating but also horrifying because man the enemy is
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:05:01.400]  freaked out right now and they're gonna attack like osama bin laden was a 9 11 truther cyhurst
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:07.000]  just released an explosive story debunking the u.s government's version of events in the 2011

[02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:18.040]  recovered so just what was on bin laden's bookshelf well around half of the books recovered were
[02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:24.680]  about conspiracies 9 11 and the illuminati imagine bin laden curled up on his couch

[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:36.360]  the attack the other possibility is that the entire list has been completely fabricated

[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:18.680]  of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:22.600]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities if you've got a

[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:56.680]  warrior column that's chuck norris and to be a little blasphemous but not intentionally i mean
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:03.640]  it's a joke if chuck norris be with us and for us who be against us all right that's a little too
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:15.560]  far on the chuck norris jokes uh but i first heard about all this from the whole norris combine
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:20.680]  about jade helm and stuff several months ago and i talked about it i said huge military news with
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:25.000]  the governor which stuff is going on the feds the state knows what's going on well of course the
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:31.160]  state knows i mean we've had half our power plants seized outside of law and just shut off
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:37.720]  and that all ties into the war on lemonade stands that forms asked for years ago why is there a
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:43.000]  war on lemonade stands why is there a war on amish why is there a war on backyard gardens and
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:47.800]  now they said in tulsa we want inspections you might be growing pie because there's nothing
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:53.240]  worse than a backyard garden folks or or zone people harassing folks for tomatoes growing in
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:58.920]  their windows or whatever yeah there's the headline the inexplicable war on lemonade stands no it's
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:04.760]  big mega box stores that want to end normal human activity and have giant food deserts everywhere
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:09.320]  let me tell you one of the most enjoyable things i don't have time to do it anymore my kids do it
[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:15.240]  but it's so much fun to go out and till the soil we got nine acres out in the country outside
[02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:21.160]  austin's the little plot on the end fruit trees on it and stuff it's so much fun to pick the plums
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:26.680]  and pick the apples and pick the you know different things that are out there it's so much fun to pick
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:35.720]  the spinach and pick the squash and to even grow our own pumpkins and things like that and it's
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:41.000]  just so simple you plant it you take care of it it grows my favorite is hot peppers i mean you're
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.840]  talking about for a couple dollars you could have a whole field of pepper plants growing
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:49.880]  you could take them to a farmers market and sell them but there's a war against that
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:56.280]  and i remember reading about johnny apple seed three years ago and i remember reading about him
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:02.280]  in school but i reread about johnny apple seed in seven states it's estimated planting
[02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:08.120]  over a million apple trees and other fruit trees and teaching people how to take care of themselves
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:14.920]  will germany forever plants stuff in the highway rightaways and local community groups just go and
[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:18.200]  they just pick an area they just plant fruit trees and stuff and they go and pick them and
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:22.520]  they eat them and they can them and they sell them or whatever well here though that's the
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:26.360]  new crime and i didn't even know this guy was doing this i separately you can watch the video
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:32.200]  at the info or seed center and info or store dot com we have eight different companies the best
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:38.120]  low cost high quality non-gmo heirloom seeds because monsanto is an award to buy up all the
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:42.600]  seeds and with two other gmo companies and just basically ban their sale but these are groups
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:49.960]  still doing it everything you need to survive and i've explained that even in urban areas
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:55.880]  we've gone out and shown this on video you can go to the middle of a you know the highway
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:00.520]  in the middle of the woods with some little 200 square foot open area of the sun dig it up plant
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:05.320]  tomatoes and get more tomatoes than you can ever even harvest this is nature's bounty
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:13.320]  ron finley has had arrest warrants issued for him out in la trying to get this going and the studies
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:18.440]  show you get young people growing things or you get young people even with a fish tank or a dog
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:25.720]  to take care of but especially plants we release hormones it's been shown that calm us when we're
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:32.680]  out in the garden with the bees and the sunflowers and the and the watermelons and just everything
[02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:40.120]  it's so much fun to do this it's a normal human agrarian activity and there's the ron finley project
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:44.520]  here i was saying copy johnny apple seed and then nico a few months ago said if you're about this
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:50.120]  guy in the only times places who they've tried to arrest and fine and fee because he dares to go
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:55.800]  into these you know government lots with weeds everywhere and plant stuff and then other people
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:59.800]  get involved and they start planting and then they start demanding hey we want part of this
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:06.600]  city park that nobody uses for a city city garden and next they're going to want chickens in their
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:10.520]  backyards next they're going to want to be independent humans see the globalists don't
[02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:17.640]  want us to be self-sufficient this is the essence of the plantation the essence of the reservation
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:22.680]  is you can't be self-sufficient and that's the plan ron finley dot com

[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:03.880]  the plant there we have these these um in front of the they're called parkways it's like right
[02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:09.240]  before you get to the street that's stripper land you know strip of grass yeah like in these
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:16.440]  pictures i'm standing in the street so i decided to just remove my grass by a sheet moat shit
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:22.920]  with cardboard a lot of it and i planted food but as far as alex it started only for beautification
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:28.600]  of my of my block of my neighborhood i mean i wanted to be kissed by hummingbirds every day i
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:34.920]  wanted to see butterfly i wanted i wanted to smell lavender and jasmine and and rosemary
[02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:40.280]  so that's where that's where it started um and so then i started and then it came down again
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:49.000]  long story short i took a hundred and fifty feet uh by ten by about nine ten feet and i made a food
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:55.400]  for us um that i wanted to feed my i wanted my neighbors basically to see look you can design

[02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:06.680]  that's my that's this is my street art this is my graffiti and that's how i treat it but also it
[02:28:06.680 --> 02:28:12.440]  beautifies it purifies and it's all you're cleaning the air you're bringing in pollinators you're
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:18.920]  bringing in all kinds of insects and you're feeding people but also the the it's it's it's
[02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:23.640]  multi-layered because people pass by and like you were saying they see these flowers they see this
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:29.720]  it's color therapy alex you know it helps the value of the neighborhood too exactly exactly but
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:36.360]  it in it and in that it changes people's perspective it changes their mind people are smiling i mean

[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:15.560]  like you gardens build communities period and like you said man this is a people ask me what i do
[02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:20.440]  and i'm like i change culture that's what i do you know and that's what we have to do and we have
[02:37:20.440 --> 02:37:26.280]  to get back to being self-sufficient you know like you said they that this they don't that and people
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:31.800]  ask me why you call it gangster i said this is gangster you want to know what true gangster is
[02:37:31.800 --> 02:37:36.840]  it's being self-sufficient right building your community it's not it's not it's not bit tearing
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:42.600]  it down you know it's it's it's it's educating it's helping people that's to me that's that's the
[02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:49.320]  you know i i got a hashtag real gangsters growth grow food you know real g's grow flowers you know
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:54.360]  and that that's that's that's that's true to me man it's like it's all the lessons are in the
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:38:01.400]  soil you know i said i don't i don't good i don't grow food i grow soil you know because you are people
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:06.600]  they tell us you are what you eat that's kind of not true because you are what you eat eats
[02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:12.280]  you know now if your soil is deficient of any kind of nutrients what do you think your plant's
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:16.120]  going to be what do you think your lettuce is in your tomatoes they're not going to they're not
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:21.480]  going to grow they're not going to prosper but the same thing like you was saying everything
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:27.320]  starts from a seed and we started from a seed alex and people people get away from that concept man
[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:32.760]  that that look at what we turned into in the same thing just little tiny seed can give you
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:39.160]  you know a 50 foot tree that gives you fruit year after year after year after year you know we we
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:44.680]  have to we have to look at things different we have to look even our so-called waste alex we
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:49.480]  have to look at different you know i tell people you know people think leaves are debris and it's
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:56.120]  it's a pain in its trash i'm like no no leaves are a resource you know a leaf falls for a reason
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:39:01.800]  in a particular season that's by design you know and we need to stop trying to change mother earth's
[02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:08.600]  design and and do biomimicry and mimic what she's doing because who gardens in a forest alex
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:16.520]  if nobody so how the hell do we have 350 foot trees you know because that's because it's a it's
[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:23.320]  a divine plan and it's an incredible it's it's magic and all the synergy and the harmony and
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:29.640]  absolutely you know when i had children my brain clicked and i opened up a lot but when you garden
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:36.840]  it really is spiritual and that's why they don't want people doing it because you zone out when
[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:43.960]  you're doing it you just it's just programmed into us to be life givers life builders to work
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:55.000]  with the earth to be positive imagine you need a garden you know it becomes your solace and that's
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:40:00.760]  what i tell people man this the soil seduces you i mean period and you got to think that that's
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:06.440]  where we come from that's where we are man and i'm trying to just get people back and and and to
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:12.520]  where you can design your own life i talk to kids i was they don't dream you know and and that that
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:17.400]  bothers me because a dream is free but you got people's mind to the point that they don't even
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:22.760]  dream that's control and i'm trying to break well sure everybody's inside in these in these food
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:27.880]  prisons in these in these neighborhoods with no plants and they're in there watching tv
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:33.000]  watching these incredibly unhappy rich people because i know a bunch of them thinking that they
[02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:39.160]  aren't adequate and they've got to follow what this is saying we're being farmed by the corporatist
[02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:45.960]  it's time to get out of that system get outside and start doing this and i mean it really is in
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:51.560]  my gut but also intellectually i know this is one of the keys to really overturning this system
[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:55.160]  peacefully because they sell us on violent revolutions the way to go well that's because
[02:40:55.160 --> 02:41:02.360]  they can win that every day but a velvet revolution of culture of art of food of literature of gardening
[02:41:02.360 --> 02:41:07.480]  that's something the system can't beat because it's so innately human you just do it as you were
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:13.800]  saying and everybody comes you don't have to sell anything no and you know i i had some folks here
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:19.720]  they did a march against manasanto and i'm like and people like ron we everyone was expecting
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:24.360]  you to be at the mart and i'm like why were they expecting me to be there i'm like i didn't
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:29.960]  i mean that hey that my santo don't really care about you guys marching you know what i'm saying
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:36.520]  i all the thousand and how many people was there i said you know what i did i had that day i had 60
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:42.920]  people putting in a garden so now imagine if you had all those people that were marching and doing
[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:48.280]  that which is cool i mean people need to mark but just imagine alex if that energy went into
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:53.000]  all those people putting in gardens i mean there's your fight against myself exactly that's what i
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:57.400]  always say vote with your dollars vote with your action if the 10 000 great people that marched in
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:02.520]  almost every city like 10 000 austin even more i know in other areas if they all went and put in a
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:09.080]  garden or a plant that would overturn monsanto in a year i mean it'd be there'd be so much fresh
[02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:14.360]  non-gmo food everywhere it'd be crazy and what do they got to swat team us for growing tomatoes
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:21.240]  i mean we're that close if people just get into this no that i i that's one of the jokes i tell
[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:27.400]  about my garden you know i said uh all of a sudden you know i planted tomato next thing i know you
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:34.040]  know uh we got a black guy planting a tomato okay we're gonna need backup you know it was like that
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:39.000]  you know they call swat because you know hey he's got cabbage out on his street you know we we gotta
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:45.320]  do something about that it's ridiculous man and and and we gotta break these these slave chains
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:51.240]  and i ain't talking i'm talking about everybody because they own our food they control our foods
[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:55.480]  so therefore they control us and well look at how they've been waging war against the american
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:43:02.120]  farmer for 70 80 years these robber barons know what they're doing yeah and the thing about it
[02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:06.760]  they're depleting all the resources from the soil to the water while they're doing it and they're
[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:13.640]  creating all these superb bugs and super weeds you know because of the toxic sprays and everything
[02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:19.320]  is a new rare cancer now every day you know oh she has a rare cancer i'm not to say i've studied
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:26.200]  this architecture of this evil it's so hard to be as evil as they are i mean how did they come up
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:32.840]  with something you're so good then Alex do what how did they do it so well then yeah no i'm saying
[02:43:32.840 --> 02:43:36.840]  if they're just so i mean they are so evil i mean when you really study them they know what
[02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:41.640]  they're doing i mean they these are some smooth operators that's one of those don't hate the player
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:48.120]  hate the game kind of thing because they know that if we could do what they do as good as they do i mean
[02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:55.320]  i oh man the world would be a beautiful place but my word has spread literally Alex around the world
[02:43:55.320 --> 02:44:03.640]  i mean from from north korea to africa man i i i've i've spoken at at cutter and oman and greece

[02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:29.960]  and is already changing the world that is the microcosm the archetype of what will defeat the system
[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:37.640]  and i mean the thing about with my with me i am no i didn't i wasn't even trying i tell people
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:43.960]  i'm the most reluctant anarchist i'm not an activist not saying you're an anarchist it's a

[02:46:28.280 --> 02:46:34.280]  pleasure to meet you uh ron and alec uh ron i got a question for you what do you think about the
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:40.440]  geoengineering that's going on with the california drought alex had a guest on some time ago from
[02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:48.040]  stopthecrime.net and she discusses different things about uh the onesanto grew purposely
[02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:53.400]  putting things into the clouds to prevent the rain while causing more rain and more devastation
[02:46:53.400 --> 02:46:59.080]  on the in the midwest with their snowstorms and depotting us of well we know geoengineering is
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:04.680]  going on but they classify what they're doing just like you mentioned superweeds antibiotic
[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:10.440]  resistant stuff from the chickens and everything else uh are you aware of the larger program of
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:18.440]  manipulating the weather no i mean i know i mean you you see it though i mean uh it's funny because
[02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:24.440]  even guys that fly the planes they oh those are those are com trails that's every yeah why are they
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:29.080]  in this pattern do well all of a sudden do they dissipate and they join together and all of a
[02:47:29.080 --> 02:47:41.080]  sudden we have this cloud cover um it's it's um i don't know i see here it doesn't benefit california
[02:47:41.080 --> 02:47:45.800]  which was one of the biggest agriculture states in in the united states of america they want to bankrupt
[02:47:45.800 --> 02:47:53.400]  the whole thing well who's that gonna that's not gonna benefit the the the the powers that be the
[02:47:53.400 --> 02:48:00.280]  biggest landowners in this in this state though alex i mean if their whole thing is about money alex
[02:48:00.280 --> 02:48:04.520]  how why would they want to bankrupt it because well you just brought the key point because it's
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:09.080]  beyond that they got the ultra rich but there's people above that that are long term once they
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:13.640]  bankrupt it for a decade they can come in and buy it all up and be the bread basket for the next 200
[02:48:13.640 --> 02:48:20.440]  years for all of north america it's long term players uh terrence great question renee in south

[02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:11.400]  more powerful that's why they're targeting amish it's why they're going after like i said earlier
[02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:18.920]  the any type of farmers markets raw milk it's why i've seen an la where they go after these co-op
[02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:23.880]  places where people are coming and selling their produce it's all done in the name of safety but
[02:55:23.880 --> 02:55:30.120]  it's done to dominate and control people prisoners can't grow their own food and that's what it comes
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:35.000]  down to ron finley i want to take some more phone calls here but anything else you'd like to have
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:41.080]  before we go to joseph and others no just i mean you hit it on the head with the the whole prison
[02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:45.720]  of things i mean people think because they can get into their swanky cars and drive around that
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:51.080]  they're that they're not in prison i mean and that's why i call these food prisons you know like
[02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:56.200]  you said you can't grow your own food in prison and that's bad the fact that they have outlaw
[02:55:56.200 --> 02:56:02.360]  you know this is this is you get in you become a criminal because you plan a carrot it's it's
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:08.840]  ridiculous man and um uh it has to change and like you said earlier in the in the segment
[02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:14.440]  we're we're seeing the fall man we're seeing you know mcdonald's some of those are closing we're
[02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:22.040]  seeing them coming oh they're slowly changing natural chicken a lot of the stuff they're cutting out you
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:27.560]  know and that's because people vote with the dollars dollars exactly and they see they had they see
[02:56:27.560 --> 02:56:33.480]  they have to their their their their sales are down and they're like okay now we it's terrible that
[02:56:33.480 --> 02:56:38.280]  we have to take it to this point for them to do the right thing why are you why are you selling
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:43.160]  me toxic food in the first place you know like with the thing with dunk and donuts where they
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:47.880]  had the powdered sugar was supposed to be not powdered sugar was supposed to be some chemical
[02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:52.200]  or something that you know that look like powdered sugar on the dough why why are you
[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:56.200]  you know why are you doing this first i mean why would you do something that somebody wouldn't
[02:56:56.200 --> 02:57:02.440]  want done to you it's just it's just it's just a fundamental predatory nature and as you said the
[02:57:02.440 --> 02:57:09.320]  warmest turning very exciting times joseph in california you're on the air go ahead hey i have
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:14.440]  a question a pleasure to be on your show but i have a question um with for friendly uh what do
[02:57:14.440 --> 02:57:20.840]  you think is the state's uh the state's government role in agriculture and for john's uh you just
[02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:25.960]  mentioned co-ops you have like do you think there should be a balance between socialism and crony
[02:57:25.960 --> 02:57:32.040]  capitalism because you know i'm i'm what i used to be kooky cutter liberal but now i'm a libertarian
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:35.800]  and i just think there should be a balance between the two sure listen when you hear the term co-op
[02:57:35.800 --> 02:57:41.400]  that has a communist connotation they had co-ops for that all that means is people kind of come in
[02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:46.200]  as a group share some of their profits to pay for the facility and for upkeep but then people
[02:57:46.200 --> 02:57:52.280]  make profits so i'm talking about co-ops based on but but again co-ops only work on the micro
[02:57:53.080 --> 02:57:57.080]  okay that's why small is beautiful and that's what i've seen working my own life
[02:57:57.080 --> 02:58:03.560]  but but that's my view what what's your take on that run well i mean that that's what i that's
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:09.560]  what i want um as you well know out you cannot eat all the food that you grow it's impossible
[02:58:09.560 --> 02:58:13.800]  that's all you would be doing is eating we're so productive we gotta share if we gotta share
[02:58:15.560 --> 02:58:22.120]  you had a block that was like a co-op where you grow carrots and onions and i grow lettuce and
[02:58:22.120 --> 02:58:27.560]  tomatoes and sally grows cucumbers so now you don't have to grow all your food because you can
[02:58:27.560 --> 02:58:33.480]  trade between your uh between your neighbor exactly that's not communism that's human activity
