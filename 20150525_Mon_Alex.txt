[00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:07.634]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:12.597]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:15.859]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[00:00:38.894 --> 00:00:40.595]  Child Protective Services.
[00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:42.037]  The name says it all.
[00:00:42.037 --> 00:00:51.384]  CPS claims that they are out to protect children from abusive and neglectful parents, but is that just a ruse in order to take healthy children away from good families?
[00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:55.908]  To place them in the foster care system where they receive bounties from the federal government?
[00:00:55.908 --> 00:01:03.754]  That's right, the average reimbursement to state and local government for each child taken into foster care is about $6,000 a month.
[00:01:03.754 --> 00:01:06.236]  The foster care provider receives about $600 a month of that.
[00:01:07.677 --> 00:01:14.282]  Therefore, each one of these kids forced into foster care are worth approximately $5,000 to CPS.
[00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:23.670]  Two foster parents had criminal records, a son living there with multiple felonies, and a convicted sex offender visiting and sometimes caring for the children.
[00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.772]  She refused to arrange an adoption.
[00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:33.000]  Her CPS supervisors responded with this memo recommending the adoption should proceed quickly.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.426]  Our theory is that the basis for this is the tie to the federal money.
[00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:45.654]  That every time a child is not placed in a home, the state of Kentucky through its cabinet is losing federal money.
[00:01:45.854 --> 00:01:53.917]  Child Protective Services in Pennsylvania was at her doorstep taking her one-day-old baby because they thought Liz was abusing drugs.
[00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:57.919]  But what the hospital didn't consider more closely was poppy seeds.
[00:02:01.303 --> 00:02:02.944]  We reached out to CPS.
[00:02:02.944 --> 00:02:07.245]  They say they can't specifically comment on this case because of privacy law.
[00:02:07.245 --> 00:02:11.407]  But we wanted to know what the rules are and what rights parents have.
[00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:18.369]  CPS says we conduct a risk assessment of the child's safety and rely heavily on the direction of health care providers.
[00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:25.111]  And now Anna and Alex find themselves fighting for Sammy's return and for their rights as parents.
[00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.932]  Where there's children, there are pedophiles.
[00:02:27.692 --> 00:02:34.575]  You know, they're in schools and they're in churches and they're everywhere where they can get their hands on children.
[00:02:34.575 --> 00:02:36.476]  So we know that that's true.
[00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:38.537]  And it's got to be brought to an end.
[00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:41.579]  It's got to be completely exposed for what it is.
[00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:47.061]  And in my opinion, it needs to completely be completely be dissolved.
[00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:50.403]  I don't see any good left in child protective services.
[00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:55.865]  Senator Nancy Schaefer and her husband Bruce were found dead today at their Habersham County home.
[00:02:55.865 --> 00:03:02.167]  The bodies of former State Senator Nancy Schaefer and her husband Bruce were found today at their Habersham County home.
[00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:04.587]  Investigators say both had been shot.
[00:03:04.587 --> 00:03:06.588]  Preliminarily looks to be a murder-suicide.
[00:03:06.588 --> 00:03:11.229]  The GBI has six agents on the scene, two crime scene specialists.
[00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:12.650]  There will be a third investigation.
[00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:19.258]  CPS adversary Senator Nancy Schaefer and her husband's life met a very abrupt end.
[00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:32.294]  There are far too many oddities surrounding her life for it to have been anything but an assassination due to her outspoken crusade to uncover one of the prime child smuggling areas in the United States, Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:03:32.814 --> 00:03:37.676]  Bruce was retired and the couple didn't appear to be in any type of dire financial crisis.
[00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:43.418]  Friends who knew the couple best state that Bruce would simply not have had the capability to kill his wife.
[00:03:43.418 --> 00:03:52.201]  Nancy was actively exposing corruption within the Department of Family and Child Services, including actions by the DFCS director in the county where she lived.
[00:03:52.381 --> 00:04:03.124]  Nancy's husband Bruce was highly supportive of Nancy's work for decades and would have had little or no reason to suddenly try to kill her at such a critical juncture in her career.
[00:04:03.124 --> 00:04:21.408]  Imagine you're a happy family living in Central Texas in a suburb of Austin, Round Rock, and one night you decide to smoke some marijuana after your two-year-old daughter's gone to bed while you watch a movie, something over a hundred million Americans are estimated to do every single week.
[00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:37.524]  A good secret police neighbor smells the marijuana, calls the police, and they come with the CPS and take your two-year-old happy daughter, who'd never been in the hospital, and never been sick, and never been beaten up.
[00:04:38.615 --> 00:04:40.757]  You go for weekly visits.
[00:04:40.757 --> 00:04:53.849]  All right, that's just a few minutes from a special report that aired last night on the Nightly News dealing with the CPS connection to pedophile rings and tying it into the 10 children being taken in Kentucky.
[00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.651]  The full video interviews on Infowars.com.
[00:04:56.651 --> 00:04:57.032]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.149 --> 00:05:07.159]  The latest example of liberal free speech oppression is brought to you by Kit Daniels in the article, Campus Police Intimidates Student Over Her Anti-Obama and Pro-Gun Signs.
[00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:16.009]  A college student is suing her school after three campus cops and an administrator ordered her not to carry an anti-Obama sign and a pro-gun sign on campus without special permission.
[00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:26.153]  Nicole Sanders, a student at Blinn College in Brenham, Texas, was recently demonstrating with the signs when she was told she needed special permission for them and had to stay in the college's free speech zone.
[00:05:26.153 --> 00:05:31.915]  I needed to fill out a form stating what I'm doing, where I'm doing it, who's involved, and what outcome we were expecting, she said.
[00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:34.396]  We have to wait until four administrators sign it.
[00:05:34.396 --> 00:05:40.699]  In response, Sanders has filed a lawsuit against Blinn College stating its policies and their enforcement are unconstitutional.
[00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:51.432]  This story is eerily similar to an incident at California Polytech earlier this year in which school officials were also requiring students to engage in First Amendment activities on campus to apply for a free speech permit.
[00:05:51.432 --> 00:05:55.276]  You can find more stories like these at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:05:55.276 --> 00:05:57.298]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:03.221]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:17.705]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[00:06:27.968 --> 00:06:28.988]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:38.270]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.071]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:06:42.071 --> 00:06:50.393]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[00:06:52.753 --> 00:06:53.793]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:01.086 --> 00:07:10.831]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:13.533]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:17.095]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:07:17.095 --> 00:07:23.419]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:28.222]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:07:28.522 --> 00:07:34.927]  Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:07:34.927 --> 00:07:42.673]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[00:07:42.673 --> 00:07:50.199]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:53.822]  Obtain your Child Ease today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:53.822 --> 00:07:56.744]  That's Child Ease exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:01.782]  Is the U.S.
[00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:14.033]  involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling, anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[00:08:14.033 --> 00:08:14.694]  To Turkey?
[00:08:16.408 --> 00:08:17.850]  It is a big idea.
[00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.034]  A new world order.
[00:08:20.034 --> 00:08:24.180]  How is it that this organization is so well-funded, so organized?
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:31.351]  Islamic State-linked militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya, seizing new economically vital areas of the country.
[00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:39.895]  The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel Hakim Belhadj, and of course he was armed to the teeth by NATO.
[00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:44.097]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:08:44.097 --> 00:08:48.579]  The Russians say they're negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military exercises.
[00:08:48.579 --> 00:08:53.982]  Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up, creating an ominous alliance against the United States.
[00:08:55.002 --> 00:08:59.967]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal that the U.S.
[00:08:59.967 --> 00:09:02.310]  government is negotiating with Iran.
[00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:07.976]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks on Iran.
[00:09:07.976 --> 00:09:09.978]  We have an unprecedented opportunity.
[00:09:10.578 --> 00:09:12.799]  To build a new world order.
[00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:19.103]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and played an important part in events now.
[00:09:19.103 --> 00:09:23.525]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of an international monetary fund aid package.
[00:09:23.525 --> 00:09:28.228]  We had brokered a deal to transition power in Ukraine.
[00:09:28.228 --> 00:09:29.969]  Vladimir Putin is on the move.
[00:09:32.288 --> 00:09:43.340]  Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the opportunities presented by this new and involving world order.
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.163]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:09:46.163 --> 00:09:48.346]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:09:56.954 --> 00:10:00.757]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live, well into the second hour, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:10:00.757 --> 00:10:05.220]  Our guests will be with us until the bottom of the next hour, or until the very end of the next hour, if they want.
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.081]  I don't want to exhaust them.
[00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:14.287]  Gary Haven is a successful grassroots entrepreneur, the most successful, according to Forbes, franchise in.
[00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:16.449]  History curves.
[00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.990]  He's retired from that a few years ago.
[00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.012]  Mike Norris, successful filmmaker.
[00:10:20.012 --> 00:10:21.294]  Christian filmmaker.
[00:10:21.294 --> 00:10:22.235]  Son of Chuck Norris.
[00:10:22.235 --> 00:10:23.076]  You know, the firstborn.
[00:10:23.076 --> 00:10:26.739]  You know, the guy in there helping his dad launch the whole legend.
[00:10:26.739 --> 00:10:28.481]  He's gonna get into that and so much more.
[00:10:28.481 --> 00:10:30.363]  His view on the world today.
[00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:31.464]  Gary Haven.
[00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.126]  Mr. Haven started Curves.
[00:10:33.126 --> 00:10:35.809]  And the reason my memory messed up, I was trying to think, where did you start it originally?
[00:10:36.249 --> 00:10:37.669]  In Harlingen, Texas.
[00:10:37.669 --> 00:10:38.650]  In Harlingen, Texas.
[00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:45.392]  And now you've made a major movie with Mr. Norris over here that I was honored to be in that's coming out in the future.
[00:10:45.392 --> 00:10:46.592]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:10:46.592 --> 00:10:51.453]  Tell us about the film and then tell us about yourself and then Mike Norris over here.
[00:10:51.453 --> 00:10:52.474]  Mr. Haven, all you.
[00:10:53.396 --> 00:11:00.900]  Well, I retired, sold my company a couple of years ago and was looking for something to do.
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:07.504]  And influencing the culture in a positive way was something that I felt I had a duty to do.
[00:11:07.504 --> 00:11:10.926]  And, you know, people don't take the time.
[00:11:10.926 --> 00:11:11.766]  They're busy.
[00:11:11.766 --> 00:11:15.588]  They don't want to watch the news or really invest in reading about what's going on.
[00:11:15.588 --> 00:11:16.709]  But they like to be entertained.
[00:11:17.489 --> 00:11:20.311]  And if you can entertain people while you teach them something.
[00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:21.472]  I just thought it was a great idea.
[00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:23.754]  And Mike and I have been friends for a long time.
[00:11:23.754 --> 00:11:28.678]  Mike is a real famous movie director who's done about 20 different films.
[00:11:28.678 --> 00:11:31.400]  And so I came to him one day and said, hey, I got a great idea.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:37.125]  You know, let's make some movies together and let's influence the culture in a positive way while we entertain people.
[00:11:37.725 --> 00:11:52.241]  And the first movie we made was, it's out and it's available now, it's called Mission Air, and you can go and find that information about that from Pureflix, which was the distributor for God's Not Dead, for example.
[00:11:52.241 --> 00:11:56.025]  Go to their website in Christian bookstores and you can get Mission Air.
[00:11:56.025 --> 00:11:59.468]  And by the way, these Christian films now are bigger than a lot of Hollywood films.
[00:12:00.109 --> 00:12:02.151]  I mean, The Passion of the Christ is an example.
[00:12:02.151 --> 00:12:02.731]  Absolutely.
[00:12:02.731 --> 00:12:03.812]  I'm sorry, Gary.
[00:12:03.812 --> 00:12:09.377]  There's a number of films that were released this year with a faith-based message that have done phenomenal.
[00:12:09.377 --> 00:12:16.863]  So, it's really great to see the culture actually starting to change and view this material that we're putting out.
[00:12:16.863 --> 00:12:18.184]  So, it's very exciting.
[00:12:18.184 --> 00:12:19.545]  It's voting with your dollars.
[00:12:19.545 --> 00:12:21.006]  I mean, this is how you really change the culture.
[00:12:21.606 --> 00:12:22.567]  Absolutely.
[00:12:22.567 --> 00:12:33.091]  But it wasn't until about nine months ago that Gary had this idea for another film that really kind of ramped everything up to a whole other level, and that's our next film, Amerigeddon.
[00:12:33.091 --> 00:12:41.315]  Now, Gary Haven, I should have gone over your bio a little bit better and not butchered your name here live on radio, but getting to know you has just really been amazing.
[00:12:41.315 --> 00:12:49.539]  Your insight into government, all the people you've been talking to federally and at the state level, you've learned a lot of amazing stuff, and it's wild to know the plot of your upcoming film
[00:12:50.523 --> 00:13:00.805]  It's already been shot, it's now being edited, to see that then it ties into Jade Helm, and it ties into this very theme that America is so concerned about.
[00:13:00.805 --> 00:13:02.826]  Yeah, Merrick Gedden was an idea that I had.
[00:13:02.826 --> 00:13:09.767]  I felt that people needed to learn about power, and about what was going on in the world.
[00:13:09.767 --> 00:13:15.268]  The mainstream media is owned, 98% of it, by six corporations.
[00:13:15.268 --> 00:13:16.128]  They're scripted.
[00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:17.609]  They stay on message.
[00:13:17.609 --> 00:13:19.729]  And so people are not getting the truth out there.
[00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:21.450]  And Alex, I want to commend you.
[00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.992]  You are a... Oh, please don't.
[00:13:23.992 --> 00:13:31.318]  No, I tell you, the courage and also your gift to articulate these difficult concepts.
[00:13:31.318 --> 00:13:33.440]  Things like vaccinations you were talking about earlier.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.142]  You know, people are not going to get the truth from the mainstream media.
[00:13:37.142 --> 00:13:41.446]  Do you know how much money the pharmaceutical companies spend on mainstream media?
[00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:45.389]  And to think that they don't control the message with all that money would be naive.
[00:13:46.029 --> 00:13:50.350]  So someone like you can articulate it beautifully in a way people can understand.
[00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.891]  You can do it better than I. In fact, your degree is in health.
[00:13:52.891 --> 00:13:54.272]  Why don't you give us your take on vaccines?
[00:13:54.272 --> 00:13:56.172]  You were just telling me about them earlier.
[00:13:56.172 --> 00:14:03.455]  Well, vaccines are a very concerning thing, and I have a five-month-old granddaughter.
[00:14:03.455 --> 00:14:10.957]  You know, and at two months, this eight-pound child was scheduled to get this cocktail of vaccines, whooping cough among them.
[00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:16.880]  That's something that is really concerning.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.701]  What's in these vaccines?
[00:14:18.701 --> 00:14:19.682]  Do they have mercury?
[00:14:19.682 --> 00:14:21.443]  Do they have aluminum?
[00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:28.407]  Do they have the material of the tissue the vaccines were grown on from rhesus monkeys?
[00:14:28.407 --> 00:14:30.028]  That DNA is in these vaccines.
[00:14:30.788 --> 00:14:33.789]  You know, I'm not saying don't get vaccines, but I'm saying think about it.
[00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:43.750]  Think critically before you allow the establishment to inject into the vein of your eight-pound child a cocktail of vaccines.
[00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.891]  People need to take responsibility for themselves.
[00:14:46.891 --> 00:14:51.112]  They need to think about it, because the system has been monetized.
[00:14:51.112 --> 00:14:59.413]  And so vaccines is a great example of the need for Americans, for people like us, to just think critically.
[00:15:02.028 --> 00:15:09.052]  Let's talk about the new film that's in production, when it's coming out, as much as you can tell us about it, the title.
[00:15:09.052 --> 00:15:14.955]  Well, what we can tell you now is the film's called Merrigeddon.
[00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:20.058]  We're looking for about a November release date.
[00:15:20.058 --> 00:15:22.419]  We are in post-production right now.
[00:15:22.419 --> 00:15:23.440]  Gosh, I wish we had
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.621]  I wish we had a clip to show.
[00:15:25.621 --> 00:15:31.683]  Yeah, a clip that might include one of the stars of the show, who might be sitting here with us here today.
[00:15:31.683 --> 00:15:32.824]  Can we have a clip?
[00:15:32.824 --> 00:15:34.565]  Let's see if we've got that clip available.
[00:15:34.565 --> 00:15:35.885]  Wait, you guys are surprising me.
[00:15:35.885 --> 00:15:38.826]  I don't even know that we don't know what you're up to.
[00:15:38.826 --> 00:15:41.288]  Stockpiling food, weapons, fuel.
[00:15:41.288 --> 00:15:48.931]  The National Defense Authorization Act is there to stop domestic terrorist threats to this country and people like you.
[00:15:48.931 --> 00:15:50.552]  I am an American.
[00:15:51.593 --> 00:15:52.855]  I am a patriot.
[00:15:52.855 --> 00:15:55.319]  You, sir, are nothing but a traitor.
[00:15:55.319 --> 00:16:01.611]  I've never seen anything like that in my life.
[00:16:01.611 --> 00:16:02.993]  That man's a threat to this country.
[00:16:11.707 --> 00:16:15.289]  That little rant will be all over the news tonight.
[00:16:15.289 --> 00:16:18.610]  You must understand this plays into our hands.
[00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.872]  The American news media has our narrative.
[00:16:21.872 --> 00:16:27.515]  And in that narrative, Charlie Gray is perfectly playing the role of right-wing extremist.
[00:16:27.515 --> 00:16:33.898]  The stigma of that label will stop up the ears of the American public faster than any propaganda we can fashion.
[00:16:36.257 --> 00:16:40.699]  By the way, you guys, we didn't plan any of this.
[00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:44.041]  And I just can't believe that you guys snuck that in.
[00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:45.281]  It's so good.
[00:16:45.281 --> 00:16:49.824]  That looks better than the big giant blockbuster movies.
[00:16:49.824 --> 00:16:51.645]  I wish I could have lighting like that for my show.
[00:16:51.645 --> 00:16:53.085]  Man, that looks good.
[00:16:53.085 --> 00:16:54.046]  And it sounds good.
[00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:54.986]  Yeah.
[00:16:54.986 --> 00:17:01.829]  You know, after you guys called and invited us on, Mr. Haven says, get a clip together.
[00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:02.690]  And I go, yes sir.
[00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:13.755]  And so we just kind of put that together just to give the audience a little feel of, you know, the bad politicians, the bad guy and our hero in the movie.
[00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:23.005]  Well, folks, if you just joined us, we have with us two amazing individuals, Mike Norris and Gary Haven, in studio.
[00:17:23.005 --> 00:17:25.406]  And the new film is coming out in November.
[00:17:25.406 --> 00:17:27.567]  And, of course, it'll be in quite a few theaters.
[00:17:27.567 --> 00:17:28.588]  It becomes a hit in theaters.
[00:17:28.588 --> 00:17:31.549]  It'll then go nationwide to thousands of screens.
[00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:43.235]  If something like this, and believe me, I've seen the script, I've been in the movie, gets out to the public with this whole climate, I mean, could you guys have imagined we'd be talking about Jade Helm and all this right when your movie's getting ready to come out?
[00:17:44.886 --> 00:17:47.609]  Folks that don't know, we don't give the plot away.
[00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:50.111]  We'll tell a little bit about kind of the theme of it.
[00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:54.655]  You know, I saw this coming and felt like we needed to warn people.
[00:17:54.655 --> 00:17:56.897]  We need to educate them while we entertain them.
[00:17:56.897 --> 00:17:58.938]  And it was kind of consistent with our message.
[00:17:58.938 --> 00:18:02.461]  So we went from the Christian movie to the political realm.
[00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:09.667]  And by the way, you play an evil senator who is debating with me in front of a sitting hearing.
[00:18:09.667 --> 00:18:11.469]  You were particularly evil.
[00:18:14.699 --> 00:18:21.482]  Well, I tell you, you guys were going to have somebody else play the role and I guess you moved to another position about two weeks before you said, hey, do you want to do this?
[00:18:21.482 --> 00:18:22.522]  I said, sure.
[00:18:22.522 --> 00:18:27.804]  And then like about four or five days before I get the script that had been changed.
[00:18:27.804 --> 00:18:30.085]  And I think I did an OK job, but not as good as you guys did.
[00:18:31.706 --> 00:18:32.746]  You really are good.
[00:18:32.746 --> 00:18:36.548]  I mean, just the dynamics of the both of you.
[00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:42.410]  We're all on the same side here, but what's fun is to go into a movie and you get to play a crooked politician.
[00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:46.532]  Well, I'll tell you, after we did about 10 takes of that, I started really not liking Gary.
[00:18:46.532 --> 00:18:47.593]  It was weird.
[00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:48.613]  It was weird.
[00:18:48.613 --> 00:18:50.014]  Well, it was actually 14 takes, Alex.
[00:18:54.396 --> 00:18:56.018]  There's a lot of footage.
[00:18:56.018 --> 00:18:56.459]  Wow.
[00:18:56.459 --> 00:19:00.925]  And when this is all over, we'll pull out the fun footage and we'll just have a little party together.
[00:19:00.925 --> 00:19:02.507]  Oh my gosh, it's amazing.
[00:19:02.507 --> 00:19:09.136]  Listen, I want to come back from break here in a moment and get back into the film, but give us a sneak peek.
[00:19:09.136 --> 00:19:10.617]  Gary, how much of this can we get into?
[00:19:11.516 --> 00:19:18.138]  Well, the movie's based, kind of the byline is a true story that hasn't happened yet.
[00:19:18.138 --> 00:19:21.640]  And we're really seeing that play out right now.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:33.144]  One of the scenes, for example, in fact with you, was a take from a conversation I had with my congressman, where I challenged him why he voted for the National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:19:33.865 --> 00:19:37.449]  And I said to him, do you realize it suspends the Fifth Amendment?
[00:19:37.449 --> 00:19:38.971]  Hold on, you told me this story over dinner.
[00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:39.432]  It was amazing.
[00:19:39.432 --> 00:19:42.035]  We're going to come back and tell this story, the inside baseball of this.
[00:19:42.035 --> 00:19:48.003]  Because you wanted to make this film, from what you told me, because you kept going around warning people and then getting this response.
[00:19:48.884 --> 00:19:49.565]  Wow, it's amazing.
[00:19:49.565 --> 00:19:54.229]  And then coming up, we're going to get into Chuck Norris, Steve McQueen, all your latest films.
[00:19:54.229 --> 00:19:55.850]  Mike Norris is here.
[00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.652]  That's right, the son of Chuck Norris.

[00:24:21.391 --> 00:24:22.393]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:24:22.393 --> 00:24:23.615]  You just joined us on the radio.
[00:24:23.615 --> 00:24:33.388]  On TV, you can see us here in the studio with my good friends who have produced a new film that is so incredibly...
[00:24:34.451 --> 00:24:52.911]  Professional Gary Haven and Mike Norris and then I want to get into the Steve McQueen stories the because I'm a big Chuck Norris fan You know watching him as a kid, but more so his politics being a real constitutionalist a big fan of 1776 a big supporter of George Washington reading his columns
[00:24:54.072 --> 00:25:15.005]  In WorldNetDaily.com in the last decade or so, however long it's been, have made me really get into the mind of Chuck Norris and see what a one-of-a-kind guy he is, and then to meet his son, who's a listener and a patriot as well, and then to meet Gary, and then the stories you told me about people in government who are awake, people that aren't, you know, telling me what a real deal.
[00:25:16.045 --> 00:25:18.746]  Governor Abbott is, as well.
[00:25:18.746 --> 00:25:23.467]  But I've talked to a lot of folks that know him, that have worked for him before he was even in government.
[00:25:23.467 --> 00:25:26.668]  They say he's a real Christian man, a great guy, really cares.
[00:25:26.668 --> 00:25:29.009]  He's suing the government over the power plant shutdowns.
[00:25:29.009 --> 00:25:31.009]  He's fighting to secure our border.
[00:25:31.009 --> 00:25:32.650]  I think we're really lucky to have him as a governor.
[00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:36.111]  I'm just giving a prelude, this is a short segment, to what we're going to be talking about today.
[00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:37.951]  But listen, don't pause for me.
[00:25:37.951 --> 00:25:40.792]  I mean, I loved having that two-hour dinner with you guys where you were just
[00:25:41.232 --> 00:25:42.593]  Just a stream of consciousness.
[00:25:42.593 --> 00:25:45.514]  You're the guys that need a radio show fighting the New World Order.
[00:25:45.514 --> 00:25:47.714]  But hell, you've got movies fighting the New World Order.
[00:25:47.714 --> 00:25:48.535]  Let's get back.
[00:25:48.535 --> 00:25:50.215]  As we come back from break, we're going to play that clip again.
[00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:51.276]  I got blindsided by that.
[00:25:51.276 --> 00:25:52.616]  I want to see that again.
[00:25:52.616 --> 00:25:56.858]  Tell us about the new film, how people support it, and more of the plot.
[00:25:56.858 --> 00:26:00.379]  Because when they hear the plot and understand this is not a B-movie, folks,
[00:26:00.839 --> 00:26:03.200]  I mean, you spent big money on this.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.981]  You know, you've got hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:26:04.981 --> 00:26:07.023]  You spent a lot of money on this.
[00:26:07.023 --> 00:26:08.684]  You've got an incredible director.
[00:26:08.684 --> 00:26:12.846]  And Mike, I've seen a lot of your films, and they're powerful, because, you know, my kids mainly watch Christian films.
[00:26:12.846 --> 00:26:14.087]  And you're one of the top directors.
[00:26:14.087 --> 00:26:16.348]  But my gosh, you knocked it.
[00:26:16.348 --> 00:26:17.469]  I mean, what?
[00:26:17.469 --> 00:26:21.291]  That looks better than Steven Spielberg movies when they show Congress.
[00:26:21.291 --> 00:26:23.372]  How did you do that?
[00:26:23.372 --> 00:26:25.954]  Right here.
[00:26:25.954 --> 00:26:27.535]  Gary, I, you know,
[00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:35.697]  I do not take lightly anything that Gary asks of me.
[00:26:35.697 --> 00:26:43.685]  I have so much respect for Gary and his wife Diane, that when this challenge was brought on to do this film, I was in, let's do it.
[00:26:44.586 --> 00:26:47.607]  Boy, I had no idea what I was getting into.
[00:26:47.607 --> 00:26:54.090]  Once production started, things were happening left and right, and decisions having to be made.
[00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:58.672]  And for this film to come out the way it did, with the message that it's presenting,
[00:27:00.276 --> 00:27:01.576]  I agree with Gary.
[00:27:01.576 --> 00:27:08.499]  This is a God thing, that this is happening, to get out, to get people to open their eyes to what's really happening in the world.
[00:27:08.499 --> 00:27:12.420]  We need this alternative media, and you were talking about my father.
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.102]  Well, the first thing you told me, tell Alex I said hi, I'm a huge fan.
[00:27:16.102 --> 00:27:19.463]  So, just really excited about Amerigeddon.
[00:27:20.302 --> 00:27:21.903]  Absolutely.
[00:27:21.903 --> 00:27:29.570]  Shifting gears, we're going to come back and talk more about Amerigeddon and how people can support it and make this international huge hit that it needs to be to really educate people.
[00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.473]  Because we're dominating news media.
[00:27:33.473 --> 00:27:39.699]  The Liberty Movement is able to counter CNN, MSNBC, but the real brainwashing, as you guys were saying during the break,
[00:27:40.339 --> 00:27:42.701]  Is in the music, is in Hollywood, is in the culture.
[00:27:42.701 --> 00:27:44.642]  That's where they're really getting everybody.
[00:27:44.642 --> 00:27:57.132]  And the fact that more and more, not just Christian, but Patriot film could become the new mega-genre that could basically unseat this and counter their narrative, and people are hungry for it.
[00:27:57.132 --> 00:27:59.414]  So it's not like we're pushing a boulder uphill.
[00:27:59.414 --> 00:28:03.477]  We're at the top of a hill, about to push it downhill at The Globalist, in my view.
[00:28:04.497 --> 00:28:05.178]  I agree 100%.
[00:28:05.178 --> 00:28:10.460]  And I really have to, once again, hand it to Gary.
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:15.263]  Personally, I wouldn't have been bold enough on my own to make this film at that time.
[00:28:15.263 --> 00:28:22.046]  But with Gary saying, this is what we're going to do, this is the money we've got to make it, let's go get this done.
[00:28:22.046 --> 00:28:23.167]  I jumped in both feet.
[00:28:23.167 --> 00:28:26.108]  And like I said, it was a tough shoot.
[00:28:26.108 --> 00:28:28.610]  Getting this cast together, getting you involved in it.
[00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:29.630]  By the way, talk about the cast!
[00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.151]  You've got some huge people in this!
[00:28:32.211 --> 00:28:35.253]  It's an interesting, eclectic cast.
[00:28:35.253 --> 00:28:40.515]  We have Diane Ladd, three-time Academy Award nominated actress.
[00:28:40.515 --> 00:28:44.056]  She was an Easy Rider, Chinatown.
[00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:45.557]  Anna Lynn McCord, Dina Meyer.
[00:28:48.078 --> 00:28:49.139]  Alex Jones!
[00:28:49.139 --> 00:28:50.420]  Oh, come on!
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.081]  No, no, no.
[00:28:51.081 --> 00:28:52.543]  No, but it really was.
[00:28:52.543 --> 00:28:55.345]  It really was perfect, because I just had this idea.
[00:28:55.345 --> 00:28:56.927]  I go, gosh!
[00:28:56.927 --> 00:28:57.708]  And I'm a listener.
[00:28:57.708 --> 00:28:58.549]  I'm a patriot.
[00:28:58.549 --> 00:29:01.111]  I mean, every night, Infowars.com.
[00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:03.894]  That is what I listen to all night long.
[00:29:03.894 --> 00:29:06.076]  I should put up with him.
[00:29:06.076 --> 00:29:07.337]  I go to Infowars.
[00:29:07.337 --> 00:29:09.419]  So, to have you play
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.261]  Such an evil character.
[00:29:12.261 --> 00:29:15.362]  I just thought was... I loved it and you were great.
[00:29:15.362 --> 00:29:19.964]  It was kind of fun to try to get in that mindset of just ridiculing and stuff.
[00:29:19.964 --> 00:29:20.985]  It's crazy.
[00:29:20.985 --> 00:29:22.946]  Yeah, yeah, but it was beautiful.
[00:29:22.946 --> 00:29:27.928]  We're gonna come back, play the intro, get into that, and then gentlemen, I'm putting it on autopilot.
[00:29:27.928 --> 00:29:30.409]  I mean, I want to go back to that Mexican food restaurant.
[00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:45.164]  And you know, I want to just talk about the politics, and then look at Jade Helm, and then we're gonna get in the next hour into the really juicy stuff, because let me tell you, as long as you were telling me, he's not known about Chuck Norris.
[00:29:45.164 --> 00:29:45.885]  None of it.
[00:29:45.885 --> 00:29:47.607]  I hope he doesn't come get us.
[00:29:47.607 --> 00:29:49.008]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.008 --> 00:29:51.551]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:54.214]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.266 --> 00:30:01.089]  Osama Bin Laden was a 9-11 truther?
[00:30:01.089 --> 00:30:04.714]  Cyhurst just released an explosive story debunking the U.S.
[00:30:04.714 --> 00:30:08.278]  government's version of events in the 2011 Bin Laden raid.
[00:30:08.278 --> 00:30:13.424]  Apparently in response, the White House released a trove of documents they supposedly recovered.
[00:30:13.604 --> 00:30:16.245]  So just what was on Bin Laden's bookshelf?
[00:30:16.245 --> 00:30:22.147]  Well, around half of the books recovered were about conspiracies, 9-11, and the Illuminati.
[00:30:22.147 --> 00:30:31.989]  Imagine Bin Laden, curled up on his couch, fascinated with the myriad of 9-11 conspiracy theories, knowing that he himself had masterminded the attack.
[00:30:31.989 --> 00:30:40.792]  The other possibility is that the entire list has been completely fabricated in an effort to smear conspiracy theorists as terrorist sympathizers.
[00:30:41.152 --> 00:30:47.116]  Fun fact, you can actually find some of the books on Bin Laden's bookshelf right here at the InfoWars store.
[00:30:47.116 --> 00:30:48.517]  Terrorists!
[00:30:48.517 --> 00:30:56.463]  Find out just what was on Bin Laden's bookshelf by reading the article, Osama Bin Laden was a 9-11 truther, at InfoWars.com
[00:30:58.186 --> 00:30:59.147]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:30:59.147 --> 00:30:59.707]  Good, brother.
[00:30:59.707 --> 00:31:01.669]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:03.371]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:31:03.371 --> 00:31:07.375]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:31:07.375 --> 00:31:10.037]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:31:10.037 --> 00:31:12.460]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:20.307]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:31:20.627 --> 00:31:23.870]  We did a super male and a super female vitality.
[00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:25.392]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:31:25.392 --> 00:31:30.096]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[00:31:30.096 --> 00:31:35.881]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:31:36.141 --> 00:31:37.942]  Or maximum potency.
[00:31:37.942 --> 00:31:48.150]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going, goes right to the source.
[00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:49.951]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.781]  Threats to this country and people like you.
[00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:05.782]  I am an American.
[00:33:05.782 --> 00:33:07.002]  I am a patriot.
[00:33:07.002 --> 00:33:09.543]  You, sir, are nothing but a traitor.
[00:33:09.543 --> 00:33:15.144]  I've never seen anything like that in my life.
[00:33:15.144 --> 00:33:18.165]  That man's a threat to this country.
[00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:29.586]  We'll be all over the news tonight.
[00:33:29.586 --> 00:33:32.927]  You must understand, this plays into our hands.
[00:33:32.927 --> 00:33:36.189]  The American news media has our narrative.
[00:33:36.189 --> 00:33:41.852]  And in that narrative, Charlie Gray is perfectly playing the role of right-wing extremist.
[00:33:41.852 --> 00:33:48.256]  The stigma of that label will stop up the ears of the American public faster than any propaganda we could fashion.
[00:33:51.246 --> 00:33:56.888]  And that's a clip from the upcoming film that is going to be coming out in what, November?
[00:33:56.888 --> 00:33:59.348]  Yeah, roughly November.
[00:33:59.348 --> 00:34:00.309]  Wow.
[00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:02.089]  And is there a website for it yet?
[00:34:02.089 --> 00:34:06.131]  No, right now everything is about getting the film done.
[00:34:06.131 --> 00:34:08.371]  We're in VFX right now.
[00:34:08.371 --> 00:34:09.572]  First cut's pretty much done.
[00:34:09.572 --> 00:34:13.493]  But we just want to give you a little taste of
[00:34:14.366 --> 00:34:15.027]  You?
[00:34:15.027 --> 00:34:15.987]  Well, it looks really good.
[00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:26.275]  I remember seeing the monitors and how, because I've been in some other pretty big films, but like Keanu Reeves and other folks, some Linkletter films, two of them, and quite a few other little movies.
[00:34:26.275 --> 00:34:29.118]  I never really sought it out, but people say, hey, will you do this cameo?
[00:34:29.118 --> 00:34:29.918]  Will you come do this?
[00:34:29.918 --> 00:34:31.540]  Because pretty much just playing myself.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.901]  The reason I like this was it was doing something different.
[00:34:33.901 --> 00:34:34.302]  That's fun.
[00:34:35.283 --> 00:34:37.125]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:34:37.125 --> 00:34:37.886]  You had it good though.
[00:34:37.886 --> 00:34:38.808]  You're just playing yourself.
[00:34:38.808 --> 00:34:40.510]  It was kind of easy.
[00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:47.239]  Being angry at the system and how they're threatening our freedom is a pretty thing to get.
[00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:48.341]  And again, this is Gary Haven.
[00:34:48.341 --> 00:34:49.482]  We've got Mike Norris here.
[00:34:50.393 --> 00:35:00.120]  I tell you, I mean, your dad's been on the show before via phone, and then he came out once and we were trying to stop a standoff in East Texas and he helped kind of diffuse that with the Grays.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:07.445]  So, I mean, I know your dad, and then I was, I mean, I knew he was a listener even 15 years ago, but when he's been on, he goes, no, I really am a routine listener, so I'm just so flattered.
[00:35:07.885 --> 00:35:09.747]  But it's how many other people are aware.
[00:35:09.747 --> 00:35:11.428]  It's not like I taught Chuck Norris anything.
[00:35:11.428 --> 00:35:13.771]  He was already a patriot before I was born.
[00:35:13.771 --> 00:35:16.073]  But what do you make with Jade Helm?
[00:35:16.073 --> 00:35:19.596]  Because I don't want to give away the film, but it almost parallels this.
[00:35:19.596 --> 00:35:26.663]  What do you make of Jade Helm and Senator Cruz and Representative Gomer and Governor Abbott?
[00:35:27.123 --> 00:35:29.605]  And all these other prominent people saying no.
[00:35:29.605 --> 00:35:30.726]  And Chuck Norris.
[00:35:30.726 --> 00:35:32.307]  No, we don't trust Obama.
[00:35:32.307 --> 00:35:33.989]  We don't think this is a takeover.
[00:35:33.989 --> 00:35:36.771]  But there shouldn't be this major domestic role.
[00:35:36.771 --> 00:35:40.314]  We know the military is in the news, training to take on the patriots.
[00:35:42.116 --> 00:35:45.758]  Gary, yeah, this really is an area I've spent a lot of time.
[00:35:45.758 --> 00:35:54.661]  You know, being retired, it gives me about six hours a day to read and to stay up on things, and so I've enjoyed getting to know that.
[00:35:54.661 --> 00:36:00.823]  You know, my company does business in 90 countries, so I've got a neat worldview of events.
[00:36:00.823 --> 00:36:07.846]  Ukraine, for example, if you follow the script that the mainstream media has been promoting on Ukraine,
[00:36:08.706 --> 00:36:13.350]  You would think that Putin's this bad guy who's come into Crimea and taken it over.
[00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:16.112]  This script is just all wrong.
[00:36:16.112 --> 00:36:24.919]  The United States spent six billion dollars through the State Department, Victoria Nuland, to overthrow the elected government of Ukraine.
[00:36:25.499 --> 00:36:28.241]  And this is all about moneyed interest.
[00:36:28.241 --> 00:36:30.882]  It's about bankers' interest.
[00:36:30.882 --> 00:36:42.349]  It's another war where we're going to send our kids and our treasure to go protect the assets of Monsanto and the oil companies and the central bankers.
[00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:50.374]  And I was having this discussion at dinner with the governor and Ted Cruz, Senator Ted Cruz, a few weeks ago.
[00:36:51.034 --> 00:36:53.456]  And I was actually vetting Ted Cruz.
[00:36:53.456 --> 00:36:54.557]  You know, I was really hopeful.
[00:36:54.557 --> 00:36:59.622]  We've got a guy that's going to stand up to these moneyed interests that are controlling our government.
[00:36:59.622 --> 00:37:03.425]  And I was really hopeful that he was on our side.
[00:37:03.425 --> 00:37:13.854]  Now, I knew that Ted Cruz's wife was a vice president for Goldman Sachs, and also that she's a member of the Council of Foreign Relations.
[00:37:13.854 --> 00:37:15.396]  And, you know, that puts him under suspicion.
[00:37:16.357 --> 00:37:18.559]  But we had a discussion.
[00:37:18.559 --> 00:37:20.400]  In fact, I'll tell you how it went.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:28.126]  He kind of talked to the six or eight people at the table about why we need to be there, why we need to send our kids there, and I kept my mouth shut.
[00:37:28.126 --> 00:37:31.308]  When it was my turn to speak, I started the conversation like this.
[00:37:31.308 --> 00:37:31.528]  I said,
[00:37:32.549 --> 00:37:36.410]  I know you're a Harvard Law School graduate who's argued in front of the Supreme Court.
[00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:38.451]  I may regret what I'm about to say.
[00:37:38.451 --> 00:37:45.113]  And I gave the true view of the Ukraine over about 10 minutes.
[00:37:45.113 --> 00:37:49.375]  In fact, it was so heated, I turned to the governor and I said, are you going to invite me back?
[00:37:50.035 --> 00:37:51.596]  And he did.
[00:37:51.596 --> 00:37:57.861]  And I think he got to hear the truth in front of the two of us challenging each other.
[00:37:57.861 --> 00:38:03.085]  And I got to tell you, I won the debate with Ted Cruz because I had the truth on my side.
[00:38:03.085 --> 00:38:04.306]  And I was fully informed.
[00:38:05.006 --> 00:38:09.730]  That's the one thing I don't like about him is that he is supporting starting a war with the Russians.
[00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:11.851]  It doesn't mean Putin is a good guy.
[00:38:11.851 --> 00:38:19.677]  It's just that you don't overthrow an elected government and put neo-Nazis in charge so Joe Biden's son can run a gas company.
[00:38:19.677 --> 00:38:21.018]  Exactly.
[00:38:21.018 --> 00:38:22.939]  This thing stinks so bad.
[00:38:22.939 --> 00:38:33.087]  It's a great example of the control the mainstream media has on the information out there and on who controls the mainstream media.
[00:38:33.727 --> 00:38:38.369]  The American people, again, it goes back to critical thinking.
[00:38:38.369 --> 00:38:40.829]  You can't just think these people are stupid.
[00:38:40.829 --> 00:38:46.251]  You know, going and poking a stick at a nuclear power, Russia, is just not a good idea.
[00:38:46.251 --> 00:38:51.633]  And yet they're doing it in Syria, they're doing it in Iran, they're doing it in the Ukraine.
[00:38:51.633 --> 00:38:53.874]  And you always ask the question, cuo bono?
[00:38:54.574 --> 00:38:55.975]  Who's benefiting from this?
[00:38:55.975 --> 00:38:59.138]  If you ask that question, you can get to the bottom of a lot of things.
[00:38:59.138 --> 00:39:05.463]  That's right, and these aren't generals, these are bankers that think they're invincible and insulated because they've got 15 helicopters.
[00:39:05.463 --> 00:39:07.265]  No, when nuclear war breaks out, it's over!
[00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:09.872]  It's insane.
[00:39:09.872 --> 00:39:19.176]  And this all comes from the Wolfowitz Doctrine, which came out in the 90s from Paul Wolfowitz, the Secretary of Defense, when he said that we have to maintain hegemony.
[00:39:19.176 --> 00:39:23.337]  We have to be the most powerful, the only powerful country on the planet.
[00:39:23.337 --> 00:39:28.339]  And if any other countries begin to threaten our power, we have to annihilate them.
[00:39:28.339 --> 00:39:32.061]  And I'll tell you what, we don't have the means.
[00:39:32.061 --> 00:39:35.262]  We should not be trying to dominate the world
[00:39:37.963 --> 00:39:45.047]  I mean, we're not even putting American views.
[00:39:45.047 --> 00:39:51.491]  We're like trying to make Russia teach five-year-olds about gay marriage.
[00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:53.772]  Putin's like saying, you're not Christian.
[00:39:53.772 --> 00:39:58.255]  We're being lectured by Vladimir Putin who's trying to put Christianity back in schools.
[00:39:58.255 --> 00:39:58.895]  We've taken it out.
[00:39:58.895 --> 00:40:00.556]  I mean, this is really getting upside down.
[00:40:01.036 --> 00:40:02.218]  It's crazy.
[00:40:02.218 --> 00:40:11.030]  And again, this is happening on such a large scale that our voices are these quiet cries in the night.
[00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.193]  But truth is a powerful thing.
[00:40:13.193 --> 00:40:16.358]  We have truth on our side and we have to have the courage to speak it.
[00:40:17.291 --> 00:40:22.034]  I believe I was given the ability, the opportunity to speak truth to power.
[00:40:22.034 --> 00:40:25.156]  Whether it's Senator Jake Cruz or whether it's the governor.
[00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:27.297]  I spent nine hours with George W. Bush.
[00:40:27.297 --> 00:40:34.742]  This is Gary Haven speaking, the founder of the Curves, one of the most successful, the most successful according to Forbes franchise in history.
[00:40:34.742 --> 00:40:38.904]  He's made billions of dollars and he's here now trying to fight the globalists.
[00:40:38.904 --> 00:40:39.445]  Go ahead.
[00:40:39.445 --> 00:40:39.845]  Yeah.
[00:40:39.845 --> 00:40:41.526]  You know, and I've been... You were meeting with George Bush.
[00:40:42.066 --> 00:40:44.448]  I took him to Haiti in my aircraft.
[00:40:44.448 --> 00:40:46.889]  Four hours there, four hours back.
[00:40:46.889 --> 00:40:48.790]  Just him and I sitting talking.
[00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:54.473]  So I've had the opportunity to really speak truth to power on so many different levels.
[00:40:54.473 --> 00:41:02.959]  I was a major Republican donor because I thought that by supporting conservative Republicans that I could influence good government.
[00:41:02.959 --> 00:41:05.060]  Well, I've given up on that.
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:10.383]  The Republican Party has given themselves over through the establishment
[00:41:10.523 --> 00:41:14.265]  Well look how they're pushing the TPP right now that they want to let Congress see.
[00:41:14.265 --> 00:41:17.647]  They're helping Obama beat the Republicans.
[00:41:17.647 --> 00:41:18.447]  It's incredible.
[00:41:18.447 --> 00:41:19.648]  That's a great example.
[00:41:19.648 --> 00:41:23.370]  And again, this is where you and I have a responsibility.
[00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:30.394]  You know, this Trans-Pacific Partnership is not available to the general public.
[00:41:30.394 --> 00:41:31.775]  It's being kept secret.
[00:41:31.775 --> 00:41:32.956]  This is insane!
[00:41:33.937 --> 00:41:44.038]  In this, we think from leaks that corporations are going to be given power to sue governments and when the governments interfere with their profitability.
[00:41:44.707 --> 00:41:48.770]  Well, and we're not allowed to see this as witnesses.
[00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:55.576]  The American people should be up in arms over the audacity of our government.
[00:41:55.576 --> 00:42:00.580]  And I tell you, the Republicans are pushing this as hard as Obama is.
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:04.763]  A set of laws is going to totally change our society.
[00:42:04.763 --> 00:42:06.705]  We're not even allowed to look at it.
[00:42:06.705 --> 00:42:12.149]  Where is the outrage over our loss of freedoms over this issue?
[00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:16.012]  It's, it's, the whole thing right now is crazy.
[00:42:16.012 --> 00:42:34.704]  But this Jade Helm in our movie is, talks about things like the National Defense Authorization Act, which the Republican Party supported, that gives the President the ability to declare martial law for any reason, economic or otherwise, without approval of Congress.
[00:42:34.704 --> 00:42:35.685]  And under martial law,
[00:42:35.845 --> 00:42:36.105]  That's right.
[00:42:36.105 --> 00:42:38.888]  Those executive orders and PDDs are all in the books.
[00:42:38.888 --> 00:42:40.189]  It's been in the news.
[00:42:40.189 --> 00:42:46.035]  You can just search Obama signs executive order to take over entire economy and during any emergency including economic.
[00:42:46.035 --> 00:42:47.796]  They put internet kill switches in.
[00:42:47.796 --> 00:42:48.977]  They've got NDAA.
[00:42:48.977 --> 00:42:50.319]  It's all there.
[00:42:50.319 --> 00:42:52.821]  They say their main enemies Christians and veterans and gun owners.
[00:42:52.821 --> 00:42:53.682]  I mean this is crazy.
[00:42:54.002 --> 00:43:01.026]  And Chuck Norris reads it, and Louie Gohmert reads it, and Senator Cruz reads it, and Ron Paul reads it, and you read it.
[00:43:01.026 --> 00:43:09.872]  We're just telling people they're building this huge, tyrannical program, and then they misrepresent what we all say.
[00:43:10.552 --> 00:43:24.099]  Well, our movie was a chance to provide an entertaining venue where we demonstrate and educate what 13603 Executive Order actually does.
[00:43:24.099 --> 00:43:28.141]  Where the President can take all of your resources.
[00:43:28.141 --> 00:43:29.602]  I'm a farmer and rancher.
[00:43:29.602 --> 00:43:31.323]  They can come and take my tractors.
[00:43:31.323 --> 00:43:33.624]  They can come and take my property, my land.
[00:43:33.624 --> 00:43:37.146]  They can come and take me and force me to work.
[00:43:37.827 --> 00:43:42.293]  Without wages, and if you read 13603, it's very, very clear.
[00:43:42.293 --> 00:43:45.377]  Well, we talk about this in the movie and then we demonstrate it.
[00:43:45.377 --> 00:43:52.647]  We show how the UN is going to side with the American army and come in and arrest dissidents.
[00:43:52.867 --> 00:43:56.749]  And by the way, that's, as you know, been in the Washington Post that they're going to use U.N.
[00:43:56.749 --> 00:43:59.110]  troops during civil disturbance in America.
[00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:00.110]  Yeah, it's all out there.
[00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:08.594]  I mean, we read, you're a billionaire company guy, smart guy that's founded companies, you've made all these top films, I've built my own media system.
[00:44:08.594 --> 00:44:11.536]  It's not like we're total idiots and we just make stuff up.
[00:44:11.536 --> 00:44:12.996]  I mean, it's all right here.
[00:44:12.996 --> 00:44:17.659]  I mean, this is what's going on, and the thing is, it's not like we're being conquered
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:22.043]  By the Romans or something, they're going to put aqueducts in.
[00:44:22.043 --> 00:44:31.352]  We're being conquered, and I'm not saying the Romans were good, by the globalists that are anti-human, Malthusian, exterminist, basically Satanist.
[00:44:31.352 --> 00:44:35.797]  And so that's the real problem, is we're being conquered by some really nasty people.
[00:44:36.658 --> 00:44:40.400]  You know, there's three things that people ought to get a hold of.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:51.047]  The first thing is that the power in Washington has been bought and paid for by moneyed interest.
[00:44:51.047 --> 00:44:53.589]  There is no representation of the people.
[00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:55.090]  And I can prove this.
[00:44:55.090 --> 00:45:03.195]  Princeton University just finished a study and analyzed what influence do the average individual voters have on the policies of the U.S.
[00:45:03.195 --> 00:45:03.915]  government.
[00:45:03.915 --> 00:45:05.937]  And Princeton University said zero.
[00:45:06.497 --> 00:45:09.039]  They said that the average voter, the average person has no interest.
[00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:10.800]  That's a special interest coup d'etat.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.201]  Yep.
[00:45:12.201 --> 00:45:16.205]  And the interest is the people that provide the money to Washington.
[00:45:16.205 --> 00:45:22.890]  And we're talking about the pharmaceutical industry, the industrial security complex, we're talking about the bank.
[00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:24.451]  Oh, now you're anti-troops.
[00:45:24.451 --> 00:45:25.792]  Oh, Eisenhower worn too.
[00:45:25.792 --> 00:45:26.773]  I guess he's bad.
[00:45:26.773 --> 00:45:27.173]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:45:27.213 --> 00:45:35.945]  Well you know, admission to that, I think the greatest thing we can do to support our troops is to keep them out of wars that they have no business being in.
[00:45:35.945 --> 00:45:36.506]  Exactly.
[00:45:36.506 --> 00:45:42.314]  Why did we arm Al Qaeda, the Free Syrian Army, now they're ISIS, the CIA did, now the army has to go fight them.
[00:45:43.302 --> 00:45:44.603]  Good question.
[00:45:44.603 --> 00:45:47.986]  So we've got to recognize that we have no influence in Washington.
[00:45:47.986 --> 00:45:49.547]  Everybody's been bought and paid for.
[00:45:49.547 --> 00:45:54.231]  And I've spoken this to my Senators and I've spoken this to my Congressmen.
[00:45:54.231 --> 00:45:55.232]  What did Ted Cruz say when he said that?
[00:45:59.355 --> 00:46:03.300]  Like the guy, but I've vetted him and I don't trust him.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:08.767]  I believe that he's given himself over to the elite, to the establishment.
[00:46:08.767 --> 00:46:14.915]  And in fact, you know, we can't go into all that, but the only guy I've got any hope for right now is Rand Paul.
[00:46:14.915 --> 00:46:16.597]  And I've met Rand Paul, I've talked to Rand Paul.
[00:46:16.897 --> 00:46:24.381]  Tell me about, I mean I know him as well, I've known him for 20 years, tell me your, but I haven't talked to him in years, tell me what you got from meeting with him.
[00:46:24.381 --> 00:46:25.802]  I'll tell you two things.
[00:46:25.802 --> 00:46:31.305]  The first thing is that I'm convinced he's the son of his father.
[00:46:31.305 --> 00:46:32.446]  And I'm a big fan of his father.
[00:46:32.446 --> 00:46:34.247]  That's why they hate him, they know he's for real.
[00:46:34.247 --> 00:46:35.027]  Yeah.
[00:46:35.027 --> 00:46:39.430]  But the other thing is he's also smart and he's staying in the middle to stay electable.
[00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:40.831]  And they know he's doing that.
[00:46:42.004 --> 00:46:50.386]  So, I believe that if he gets elected, by staying in the middle, that he'll be the son of his father when he's in power.
[00:46:50.386 --> 00:46:55.427]  And that's exactly what the Atlantic and the New York Times and others say.
[00:46:55.427 --> 00:46:58.287]  They know, they've had his phones tabbed, they know the whole deal.
[00:46:58.287 --> 00:47:00.468]  He's his dad.
[00:47:00.468 --> 00:47:02.288]  And just as good.
[00:47:02.288 --> 00:47:03.588]  A patriot.
[00:47:03.588 --> 00:47:04.689]  And they hate his guts.
[00:47:04.689 --> 00:47:06.269]  That's why I think Rand Paul is the best.
[00:47:07.307 --> 00:47:11.569]  Quite frankly, Ted Cruz is probably slicker, and would be better than Hillary Clinton.
[00:47:11.569 --> 00:47:21.832]  I mean, you know, I don't think Ted Cruz is a bad guy, but I think he's just compromised at the highest levels, kind of with that Republican power structure.
[00:47:21.832 --> 00:47:26.734]  The Mitch McConnells right now that are trying to silence on the TPP.
[00:47:26.734 --> 00:47:27.515]  It's insane.
[00:47:27.515 --> 00:47:33.617]  But you know, Alex, and I think you'd agree with me, there's not going to be a political solution to this problem.
[00:47:34.595 --> 00:47:38.416]  The only solution is if enough people wake up and begin to think.
[00:47:38.416 --> 00:47:46.198]  They begin to critically think and begin to pursue truth and invest the time and effort.
[00:47:46.198 --> 00:47:53.039]  You told me you've developed a plan and you're a guy that set up more franchises in the world than anybody ever has.
[00:47:53.039 --> 00:47:56.340]  Even more than McDonald's, the most successful franchise ever.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.001]  So, you know how to organize things.
[00:47:59.001 --> 00:47:59.781]  Boy, I don't.
[00:47:59.781 --> 00:48:01.122]  Wish I did.
[00:48:01.122 --> 00:48:02.863]  Explained a great thing.
[00:48:02.863 --> 00:48:05.624]  My crew's starting to get good at it.
[00:48:05.624 --> 00:48:10.106]  But how would you organize, simply put, a way to take things back?
[00:48:10.106 --> 00:48:18.250]  Because I just organically know, if we expose the tyranny, the fraud of the system, there'll be enough people in the system that basically leak the truth that it comes down.
[00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:24.853]  But I was kind of wrong, because now we just know we're slaves, and the globalists are sitting there pointing a gun, and it's going, yeah, okay, I took over.
[00:48:26.092 --> 00:48:30.296]  You know, I think the message has to be fairly simple.
[00:48:30.296 --> 00:48:42.546]  And that's where the, you know, this is so complex, you know, the derivatives and the money printing, you get into that and it's so complex that it's difficult for people to grasp it.
[00:48:42.546 --> 00:48:43.867]  So you've got to keep the message simple.
[00:48:44.427 --> 00:48:49.110]  You know, and again, I think there's three things that if we stay focused on message.
[00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:54.274]  And the first one is, is that our government in Washington is bought and paid for by the moneyed interest.
[00:48:54.274 --> 00:48:56.455]  We have no influence.
[00:48:56.455 --> 00:49:00.358]  We're not going to get anybody elected that's going to change anything.
[00:49:00.358 --> 00:49:03.760]  Because, number two, the message is controlled.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:09.504]  The mainstream media, this is the second thing people need to realize, 98% of it is owned by six corporations.
[00:49:09.504 --> 00:49:10.765]  And it's scripted.
[00:49:10.765 --> 00:49:12.126]  And they're not going to go off message.
[00:49:12.126 --> 00:49:13.447]  There's too much money involved.
[00:49:14.267 --> 00:49:22.791]  So, the third point is, it's up to individuals to begin to think, and to think clearly, to think critically, and to pursue truth.
[00:49:22.791 --> 00:49:24.672]  Thank God for alternative media.
[00:49:24.672 --> 00:49:25.713]  Thank God for your program.
[00:49:25.713 --> 00:49:26.893]  Oh, please don't thank me.
[00:49:26.893 --> 00:49:32.296]  Well, this is so important, because the outlets for truth are narrowed now, but they exist.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.122]  But there's real danger.
[00:49:35.122 --> 00:49:36.063]  They're trying to shut them down.
[00:49:36.063 --> 00:49:36.963]  It's here in the news today.
[00:49:36.963 --> 00:49:37.544]  Go ahead.
[00:49:37.544 --> 00:49:38.485]  You betcha they are.
[00:49:38.485 --> 00:49:52.678]  They realize that people that are fully aware are not going to tolerate the loss of their freedoms, either through these executive orders that defy the Constitution, or the National Defense Authorization Act, or the spending of money.
[00:49:52.678 --> 00:49:55.040]  You know, your parents are retired.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.601]  They're supposed to live off their savings.
[00:49:56.601 --> 00:49:57.402]  They're supposed to get 6% interest.
[00:49:58.823 --> 00:50:02.045]  And enjoy the benefits of what they've saved their lives for.
[00:50:02.045 --> 00:50:03.766]  Well, they're getting nothing.
[00:50:03.766 --> 00:50:08.649]  You know, 0.6% interest if they're lucky, or 0.06% interest.
[00:50:08.649 --> 00:50:16.915]  Our government, through its monetary policy, have destroyed the life, taken trillions of dollars from our parents who saved and prepared for retirement.
[00:50:16.915 --> 00:50:19.036]  Where's the outrage over this?
[00:50:19.036 --> 00:50:20.177]  This is insane.
[00:50:20.177 --> 00:50:23.899]  And it's supposed to be to stimulate the economy.
[00:50:23.899 --> 00:50:25.420]  Well, we just had a negative
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.284]  First quarter, we're about to have another negative.
[00:50:28.284 --> 00:50:30.026]  There is no stimulation to the economy.
[00:50:30.026 --> 00:50:37.556]  All there is is massive debts that have been placed on the backs of not our children and grandchildren because it's not going to last that long.
[00:50:37.556 --> 00:50:42.243]  This massive debt is going to bankrupt the system in this country and change all of our lives.
[00:50:42.663 --> 00:50:43.584]  Wow.
[00:50:43.584 --> 00:50:44.986]  Gary Haven is our guest.
[00:50:44.986 --> 00:50:46.268]  Mike Norris is here.

[00:50:55.901 --> 00:50:58.084]  But I'm telling you, this is amazing.
[00:50:58.644 --> 00:51:02.025]  Did you know some countries are now banning GMO foods?
[00:51:02.025 --> 00:51:02.865]  It's true.

[00:54:40.834 --> 00:54:44.536]  Did you ever find out what you guys wanted for lunch?
[00:54:44.536 --> 00:54:45.397]  Turkey.
[00:54:45.397 --> 00:54:46.778]  Okay, you want a turkey sandwich?
[00:54:46.778 --> 00:54:47.898]  You want barbecue turkey?
[00:54:47.898 --> 00:54:49.019]  No, no, no.
[00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:53.082]  By the way, you aren't fat like I've been, but you've lost a ton of weight, Mike.
[00:54:54.738 --> 00:54:55.878]  I'm trying, thank you.
[00:54:55.878 --> 00:54:58.379]  When was the video shoot, the film shoot, three months ago?
[00:54:58.379 --> 00:54:59.079]  January.
[00:54:59.079 --> 00:55:00.279]  In January, in February?
[00:55:00.279 --> 00:55:01.699]  Yeah, about January, February.
[00:55:01.699 --> 00:55:02.860]  Three, four months ago.
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:05.200]  I've lost about 25, 30 pounds since then.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:05.700]  Yeah.
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:08.941]  I mean, I've lost, I gained 99 pounds.
[00:55:08.941 --> 00:55:11.541]  I was, I mean, I was literally as fat as Rush Limbaugh almost.
[00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:17.682]  Not quite, but the point is, when he was fat, I'm not being mean, and then I've lost 60-something of it, but I still need to lose another 25.
[00:55:17.682 --> 00:55:18.522]  It's tough.
[00:55:18.522 --> 00:55:19.763]  That last few pounds.
[00:55:19.763 --> 00:55:20.683]  Well, you've done it, buddy.
[00:55:22.234 --> 00:55:22.934]  I got no choice.
[00:55:22.934 --> 00:55:24.755]  I saw myself on film.
[00:55:24.755 --> 00:55:25.835]  I about had a heart attack.
[00:55:25.835 --> 00:55:28.035]  I looked like John Candy.
[00:55:28.035 --> 00:55:29.876]  No, you didn't.
[00:55:29.876 --> 00:55:32.476]  No, you didn't.
[00:55:32.476 --> 00:55:33.216]  Are we on air?
[00:55:33.216 --> 00:55:35.397]  We are.
[00:55:35.397 --> 00:55:39.617]  I got to tell your audience, they have no idea how awesome this is here.
[00:55:39.617 --> 00:55:40.778]  This is fun.
[00:55:40.778 --> 00:55:41.418]  Well, thank you.
[00:55:41.418 --> 00:55:47.559]  No, it's just we get up here and just talk and cover the news and just go over the information, take calls, have great people on.
[00:55:47.839 --> 00:55:54.623]  I was having an out-of-body experience listening to you two go at it, talking about... Well, let me tell you, this guy, you can tell why he made millions of dollars.
[00:55:54.623 --> 00:55:55.923]  I mean, he knows what he's talking about.
[00:55:55.923 --> 00:56:02.086]  Please, Mr. Gavin, I'm sorry, Mr. Haven, I do that all the time, I conflate names.
[00:56:02.086 --> 00:56:05.468]  Please continue, Gary, getting into the solutions.
[00:56:05.468 --> 00:56:08.710]  First, identify the problem, and then get into the solutions.
[00:56:09.855 --> 00:56:14.937]  We're going to start the next hour and get into Chuck Norris lore.
[00:56:14.937 --> 00:56:17.598]  We're heavy now and we'll get light later.
[00:56:17.598 --> 00:56:25.600]  Alex, you and I share a common goal, and that is we're committed to getting the truth out to people.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:29.982]  And we're committed to protecting and defending the Constitution.
[00:56:30.802 --> 00:56:42.934]  I don't know that our forefathers, I don't know that George Washington understood that the domestic threat that was going to exist for our freedoms in this country that we have today.
[00:56:44.241 --> 00:56:49.784]  Well, can you imagine what the founders... I mean, everybody always says that, but this is becoming crazy land.
[00:56:49.784 --> 00:56:54.826]  And they're just... The Democrats have announced they want to shut down talk radio and libertarian conservative news.
[00:56:54.826 --> 00:56:56.027]  They just announced it today.
[00:56:56.027 --> 00:56:57.608]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:56:57.608 --> 00:57:01.029]  Election Commission Dems want to regulate conservative internet super PACs.
[00:57:01.029 --> 00:57:02.210]  They've made the announcement.
[00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:03.250]  They promised they wouldn't.
[00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:06.812]  Just let the FCC run the internet.
[00:57:06.812 --> 00:57:08.173]  And now what are they doing?
[00:57:09.051 --> 00:57:10.012]  It's crazy.
[00:57:10.012 --> 00:57:11.473]  I want to share a story with you.
[00:57:11.473 --> 00:57:26.365]  I felt, and this is a God thing, I was given an opportunity to teach the Governor, Governor Abbott, about, in fact here's the way it began.
[00:57:26.365 --> 00:57:29.208]  I said Governor, in fact he was the Attorney General at the time, I said General,
[00:57:30.269 --> 00:57:33.573]  You're going to be the most important governor in the history of Texas.
[00:57:33.573 --> 00:57:36.838]  And he gave me a really odd look and he said, how so?
[00:57:36.838 --> 00:57:45.710]  And I said, you're going to be in a position to choose to comply with an out of control, dictatorial federal government.
[00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:51.093]  You told me this story in February and now it's happening with him and Jane Helm.
[00:57:51.093 --> 00:57:51.814]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:57:51.814 --> 00:57:56.057]  And you told me at dinner, you said, I believe he will be in that position.
[00:57:56.057 --> 00:57:57.618]  God basically told me.
[00:57:57.618 --> 00:57:59.839]  And that is, I'm getting chills.
[00:57:59.839 --> 00:58:00.900]  I don't mean to steal your thunder.
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:02.721]  You just can't make this stuff up.
[00:58:02.721 --> 00:58:04.542]  We should have led with this.
[00:58:04.542 --> 00:58:09.125]  Hey, I've run into a chief of staff on the street twice in the last two weeks.
[00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:12.331]  And then he comes over and shakes my hand and we start talking about stuff.
[00:58:12.331 --> 00:58:13.471]  Yeah, they're great guys.
[00:58:13.471 --> 00:58:23.816]  Well, for people who may not be aware of what he did, when Texans begin to shout, look, we don't like this Jade Helm thing.
[00:58:23.816 --> 00:58:25.437]  We don't like the... You know, we gotta go to break.
[00:58:25.437 --> 00:58:30.239]  It's a 5-minute segment, 12-minute segment, 6-minute segment, 18-minute segment, 6-minute segment.
[00:58:30.239 --> 00:58:32.940]  So, I wanna just start this whole thing over.
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:36.662]  I'm gonna shut up, give you the floor to tell the story in 70 seconds.
[00:58:38.723 --> 00:58:42.267]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:59:07.936 --> 00:59:09.496]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:59:09.496 --> 00:59:12.337]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:59:12.337 --> 00:59:15.577]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:59:15.577 --> 00:59:17.758]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:59:18.058 --> 00:59:19.399]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:59:19.399 --> 00:59:21.580]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:24.181]  They are never going to stop.
[00:59:24.181 --> 00:59:28.243]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:59:35.186 --> 00:59:36.187]  Imperative.
[00:59:36.187 --> 00:59:38.227]  Destroy for the women it's to do.
[00:59:38.227 --> 00:59:42.890]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:44.270]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:45.011]  You can feel it.
[00:59:50.661 --> 00:59:53.275]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:06.691]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.691 --> 01:00:08.452]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.452 --> 01:00:10.233]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.233 --> 01:00:11.813]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.813 --> 01:00:13.354]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.354 --> 01:00:17.557]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.557 --> 01:00:21.599]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.395 --> 01:00:46.361]  Gary Haven, the founder of Curves and many other huge successful corporations, is our guest, the biggest health chain in the world, and a patriot, running around trying to wake up the Republicans for years, behind the scenes, and now working with Mike Norris.
[01:00:48.524 --> 01:00:50.426]  Some stations don't carry this segment.
[01:00:50.426 --> 01:00:53.828]  Most of them do, but I decided to do this instead of stations having to carry propaganda news.
[01:00:53.828 --> 01:00:54.589]  We're here.
[01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:57.871]  So I'm going to ask you to defer to tell your Abbott story to the next segment.
[01:00:57.871 --> 01:01:03.236]  You will have the floor, and then we're going to segue into Steve McQueen land, because this is interesting.
[01:01:03.236 --> 01:01:06.578]  It's back when men were men, and of course your dad was great buddies with Steve McQueen.
[01:01:06.578 --> 01:01:08.160]  I mean, it's Chuck Norris!
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:08.540]  I mean, you know.
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.961]  Steve McQueen discovers Chuck Norris.
[01:01:10.961 --> 01:01:12.981]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[01:01:12.981 --> 01:01:14.222]  But we'll get into all that.
[01:01:14.222 --> 01:01:20.263]  But getting back into Jade Helm, I want to ask you, Mr. Norris, what do you think about the big freakout about it?
[01:01:20.263 --> 01:01:23.644]  Because quite frankly, it's just one more conditioning to have troops on the streets.
[01:01:23.644 --> 01:01:26.885]  We didn't say it was that big a deal, but now they're freaking out so bad.
[01:01:26.885 --> 01:01:29.346]  Did you think we hit on something bigger?
[01:01:29.346 --> 01:01:32.287]  Because now we're learning it is about domestic operations for sure.
[01:01:33.207 --> 01:01:36.310]  Well, let me say this to you.
[01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:41.134]  I've had my head buried in an editing studio for four months.
[01:01:41.134 --> 01:01:49.602]  I know about Jade Helm, and I know my dad is very much an advocate for the anti-Jade Helm.
[01:01:49.602 --> 01:01:50.563]  He's Mr. Military.
[01:01:50.563 --> 01:01:50.943]  Yeah.
[01:01:50.943 --> 01:01:52.364]  He has the contacts.
[01:01:52.364 --> 01:01:52.905]  Absolutely.
[01:01:52.905 --> 01:01:56.768]  He hands out the Bronze Stars and Gresham Medal of Honor.
[01:01:56.768 --> 01:01:59.430]  And so, I know Jade Helm.
[01:02:00.276 --> 01:02:02.079]  Gary really knows Jade Helm.
[01:02:02.079 --> 01:02:08.208]  And what I do know is that my dad said that the troops were kind of butting up to his ranch.
[01:02:08.208 --> 01:02:12.735]  And if I could just say something to them, don't do it.
[01:02:15.329 --> 01:02:20.531]  And also, if any troops back up to Gary Haven's ranch, don't do it.
[01:02:20.531 --> 01:02:21.452]  Seriously.
[01:02:21.452 --> 01:02:24.333]  You've got armed helicopters.
[01:02:24.333 --> 01:02:26.674]  My ranch is three miles from North Fort Hood.
[01:02:26.674 --> 01:02:28.774]  I think I'm out of luck on this.
[01:02:28.774 --> 01:02:29.675]  Well, we all know the truth.
[01:02:29.675 --> 01:02:30.935]  The troops are awesome.
[01:02:30.935 --> 01:02:35.877]  They are the most, and I'm not kissing their butt, because used to I didn't like all this, the establishment using them to make themselves look good.
[01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:36.597]  Oh, the troops are great.
[01:02:36.597 --> 01:02:39.318]  But then I found out they are the most awake group.
[01:02:39.318 --> 01:02:40.359]  I mean, they are great.
[01:02:41.139 --> 01:02:41.660]  Absolutely.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:57.993]  We had a number of actual military men on our film that are part of a security team now, but these are all guys that have had four, five, six tours of Iraq, Afghanistan, and the troops are awake.
[01:02:57.993 --> 01:02:59.153]  Let me mention something, too.
[01:02:59.153 --> 01:03:03.036]  One of the messages in our movie was to tell the troops
[01:03:03.837 --> 01:03:08.101]  That they don't have to obey unconstitutional orders.
[01:03:08.101 --> 01:03:15.388]  For example, if they're ordered to fire on American citizens or disarm American citizens in violation of the Second Amendment, that they should think about it.
[01:03:15.388 --> 01:03:16.509]  And this is what's neat about this.
[01:03:16.509 --> 01:03:18.932]  If they watch the movie, they're going to think about it now.
[01:03:18.932 --> 01:03:23.957]  They're going to think about it well in advance from the time that they're ordered to do it.
[01:03:24.637 --> 01:03:34.644]  And so, getting them to spend some time on that now may save us and them from obeying illegal orders.
[01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:35.824]  There's the Providence again.
[01:03:35.824 --> 01:03:40.748]  I wish you would have, I should have thought to record that dinner we had and then talking the night after the shoot.
[01:03:41.809 --> 01:03:45.235]  Because it's providence.
[01:03:45.235 --> 01:03:54.392]  I mean, I cannot, I don't think I've ever experienced something this providential, is that you literally, in there with the sheriff, in there in the green room while we're eating breakfast,
[01:03:55.379 --> 01:04:00.821]  And the sheriff's sitting there nodding and they got some Texas Rangers coming by and stuff, you know, fans of the operation.
[01:04:00.821 --> 01:04:02.822]  And you're going, you're in this presentation.
[01:04:02.822 --> 01:04:19.650]  And Alex, I've been talking to politicians and I believe that Texas is going to be the battleground for this and we've got to put this film out to warn people about what's coming and it's my job to reach out to the governor so he knows his place in history to basically be this peaceful shot heard around the world when they say no to the troops on the streets.
[01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:43.650]  And I'm going, well, this could happen, yeah, but I mean, wow, I mean, this guy's really putting his money where his mouth is, but I was, and then now it's all happening, and the governor did it, and you said, I woke the governor up, and all these meetings you've had with him, and hanging out with him, and I mean, we're going to come back, and you're going to get the floor, and roll with the providence of your film, and again, tell people when it's coming out in the name.
[01:04:45.031 --> 01:04:47.474]  Uh, the name of the film is Amerageddon.
[01:04:47.474 --> 01:04:48.174]  Amerageddon.
[01:04:48.174 --> 01:04:48.975]  Amerageddon.
[01:04:48.975 --> 01:04:50.917]  And we're looking at the end of the year for a release.
[01:04:50.917 --> 01:04:52.559]  Yeah, because I was excited to be part of it.
[01:04:52.559 --> 01:04:54.580]  Once I got there, I got really excited.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.362]  And I'm not kidding.
[01:04:56.362 --> 01:04:56.822]  I'm not kidding.
[01:04:58.163 --> 01:05:10.194]  In case you missed it yesterday, the hashtag Black Lives Matter protest was interrupted by members of Red Guards Austin, a political organization that admits they are a Marxist-Leninist Maoist collective.
[01:05:10.194 --> 01:05:22.244]  These guardians of the people attempted to block other people's free speech, yelled at them, and then even started to agitate by bumping into people, pushing people around, and even stealing and breaking some of our broadcast equipment.
[01:05:22.404 --> 01:05:26.785]  Luckily, it was all caught on camera, and we were able to explain to the cops what happened.
[01:05:26.785 --> 01:05:32.287]  If you go to the Red Guards Austin Facebook page, you can see pictures of some of these individuals who showed up yesterday.
[01:05:32.287 --> 01:05:43.330]  During the live broadcast, we were able to show Facebook images of these individuals carrying communist sickles, burning American flags, and basically trying to get everybody into a race war against the police.
[01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:47.617]  Of course, they were there dressed in all black saying, we're here for women's health.
[01:05:47.617 --> 01:05:51.403]  But then even on tape they talked about how they love to kill babies.
[01:05:51.403 --> 01:05:55.750]  Check out our YouTube videos on the Alex Jones Channel and the articles on InfoWars.com.
[01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:57.473]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com.

[01:06:07.807 --> 01:06:17.732]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:06:17.732 --> 01:06:20.654]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[01:06:20.814 --> 01:06:20.894]  Yeah.
[01:06:35.831 --> 01:06:36.071]  We're good.
[01:06:58.090 --> 01:07:05.293]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:07:53.755 --> 01:07:55.095]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:29.213]  Gary Haven, Mike Norris in studio.
[01:08:29.213 --> 01:08:35.398]  And we're tweeting out right now at Real Alex Jones, Chuck Norris' son tells all.
[01:08:35.398 --> 01:08:37.760]  But he's going to tell us how cool Chuck Norris is.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.442]  Because when you actually know the real lore, it gets even cooler.
[01:08:40.442 --> 01:08:44.285]  Not just the Chuck Norris sayings and all the rest of it.
[01:08:44.285 --> 01:08:45.446]  Simply amazing.
[01:08:45.446 --> 01:08:46.787]  That'd be a good bumper sticker.
[01:08:46.787 --> 01:08:47.688]  Chuck Norris!
[01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:49.348]  I don't know.
[01:09:06.321 --> 01:09:12.724]  And now he's fighting Jade Helm and saying he doesn't trust Obama and control the military, and the military's been trained to go after patriots.
[01:09:12.724 --> 01:09:21.828]  We got Congressman Louie Gohmert saying it, and Ted Cruz coming out and saying it, which I thought was a big plus for him, and the governor leading the fight, and now Gary Haven.
[01:09:21.828 --> 01:09:26.850]  Then we shift into Chuck Norris and movies and Christian films for the balance of transmission.
[01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:30.991]  But Mr. Haven, founder of Curves, founder of huge supplement companies, you name it,
[01:09:32.412 --> 01:09:37.254]  You're out there trying to wake up the Republican Party, trying to take it back, trying to warn the people.
[01:09:37.254 --> 01:09:42.956]  Amerigeddon coming out in November, December, which literally predicts Jade Helm type of events.
[01:09:42.956 --> 01:09:46.177]  You know, Red Dawn Part 2 with the very players.
[01:09:46.177 --> 01:09:47.558]  Simply amazing.
[01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:51.179]  In the film, you warn the military not to be taken over by the globalists.
[01:09:51.179 --> 01:09:53.140]  I mean, it is a clarion call.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.921]  Providential, I would call it.
[01:09:55.921 --> 01:10:00.104]  And you didn't just say, I'm making it because it's a nebulous possibility.
[01:10:00.104 --> 01:10:02.905]  You said, I believe this is happening.
[01:10:02.905 --> 01:10:07.208]  And it was so convincing, you said it with such gravitas, that I got really excited.
[01:10:07.208 --> 01:10:08.128]  Buckley was there, my cousin.
[01:10:08.128 --> 01:10:12.671]  You'd leave the room, and I was like, my God, this is something special.
[01:10:12.671 --> 01:10:15.852]  And then you told me, I'm waking the governor up, and I'm waking the, you weren't bragging.
[01:10:15.852 --> 01:10:16.893]  You say, I'm on a mission.
[01:10:17.393 --> 01:10:22.934]  I've already given these people tens of millions of dollars trying to get them to stop selling out America and keep our jobs here, but they won't do it.
[01:10:22.934 --> 01:10:24.535]  So now I'm going to start making films.
[01:10:24.535 --> 01:10:26.875]  I mean, Alex, you need to do this and that.
[01:10:26.875 --> 01:10:39.418]  So go through that providential stuff in your meetings, multi-hour long meetings with the governor, private meetings, you name it, and talking to him about this big choice he would have coming up very soon.
[01:10:39.418 --> 01:10:41.079]  This was just four months ago.
[01:10:41.892 --> 01:10:56.781]  Yeah, let's start with what happened this last two weeks, and for people that may not be aware, the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, ordered the Texas National Guard to observe the military, the special ops that are doing Jade Helm.
[01:10:56.781 --> 01:10:58.362]  That's a remarkable thing.
[01:10:58.362 --> 01:11:06.386]  And he took tremendous ridicule in the mainstream media over standing up and protecting his citizens.
[01:11:06.386 --> 01:11:09.088]  What a novel idea, protect the citizens that elected you.
[01:11:09.628 --> 01:11:10.829]  I'm really proud of him.
[01:11:10.829 --> 01:11:13.912]  It took a lot of courage to do that.
[01:11:13.912 --> 01:11:18.996]  You know, we go back, I retired a couple years ago and was looking for something important to do.
[01:11:18.996 --> 01:11:29.245]  And I felt like that I had an opportunity and a duty to educate people, to help them to influence the culture.
[01:11:29.245 --> 01:11:35.951]  And the greatest threat to our culture right now is the usurpation of our Constitution that protects our freedoms.
[01:11:36.611 --> 01:11:45.157]  And so using media, using movies which are entertaining to teach people was what I decided to do.
[01:11:45.157 --> 01:11:49.699]  And of course I partnered with Mike Norris, Chuck's son, and we began to make movies.
[01:11:49.699 --> 01:11:53.222]  Now this movie, Mike and I wrote the script over last year.
[01:11:54.002 --> 01:11:56.803]  We didn't realize how timely it was going to be.
[01:11:56.803 --> 01:12:01.344]  But the byline of the movie is a true story that hasn't happened yet.
[01:12:01.344 --> 01:12:06.566]  And now here we are, we're in the editing process, and a lot of the things depicted in the movie are happening.
[01:12:06.566 --> 01:12:16.669]  For example, we talk about the National Defense Authorization Act that was passed over the last few years, which completely takes away due process in our Constitution.
[01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:21.230]  Today, in America, you can be arrested under nothing but suspicion
[01:12:22.511 --> 01:12:23.411]  Of terrorism.
[01:12:23.411 --> 01:12:24.652]  And disappeared.
[01:12:24.652 --> 01:12:25.873]  Incarcerated.
[01:12:25.873 --> 01:12:27.054]  Not be told where you are.
[01:12:27.054 --> 01:12:28.455]  That's exactly right.
[01:12:28.455 --> 01:12:29.776]  Not have legal defense.
[01:12:29.776 --> 01:12:31.077]  Not face your accuser.
[01:12:31.077 --> 01:12:32.958]  And you could be held indefinitely.
[01:12:32.958 --> 01:12:35.380]  That's insane in an America.
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:39.102]  But it is in law, codified in law today.
[01:12:39.102 --> 01:12:43.085]  And now the government's saying it's for the veterans and the gun owners and the Christians.
[01:12:43.085 --> 01:12:47.448]  Oh, how dare Governor Abbott be concerned or Chuck Norris or Louie Gohmert?
[01:12:47.448 --> 01:12:49.270]  How dare the congressman care?
[01:12:50.123 --> 01:12:58.071]  So getting people to become aware of what our government has done to threaten their freedoms is really the mission we're on right now.
[01:12:58.071 --> 01:13:02.776]  This movie is helping us to accomplish that because it tells the story and demonstrates it.
[01:13:02.776 --> 01:13:03.276]  It shows it.
[01:13:03.276 --> 01:13:07.941]  You know, as troops come to my ranch and try to take my resources.
[01:13:07.941 --> 01:13:09.242]  And in fact, there's a great scene.
[01:13:09.242 --> 01:13:10.744]  You know, I'm a helicopter pilot.
[01:13:12.125 --> 01:13:22.029]  I have a helicopter battle with a Huey flown by the top helicopter stunt pilot in the world, and we do a dance in the sky where he's trying to get missile locks.
[01:13:22.029 --> 01:13:24.070]  I should add dangerous dance, from what I mean.
[01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:29.253]  This is, this is... Oh, and the executive producer is flying his own helicopter.
[01:13:29.253 --> 01:13:31.674]  In a 39 crosswind, 15 feet from the other helicopter.
[01:13:31.674 --> 01:13:34.215]  It was just, it was so cool getting to do that.
[01:13:34.215 --> 01:13:38.037]  But you know, it's fun, and yet it's very serious.
[01:13:38.037 --> 01:13:40.018]  People need to be aware of what's really going on.
[01:13:40.018 --> 01:13:40.518]  And these are not
[01:13:41.058 --> 01:13:42.500]  You know, things that might happen.
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:46.867]  This is stuff that's codified into the law today that are a direct threat to our freedoms.
[01:13:46.867 --> 01:13:47.929]  So we're telling that story.
[01:13:47.929 --> 01:13:53.117]  And during a financial collapse, they say they're going to seize infrastructure and land and have forced labor.
[01:13:53.812 --> 01:13:57.474]  And in this financial collapse, that is imminent.
[01:13:57.474 --> 01:14:01.716]  I mean, you can't print money and buy your own debt indefinitely.
[01:14:01.716 --> 01:14:05.158]  If you could do that, Zimbabwe would be one heck of a success story.
[01:14:05.158 --> 01:14:06.358]  Or Weimar, Germany.
[01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:06.939]  Yeah.
[01:14:06.939 --> 01:14:12.581]  By the way, we have two curves in Zimbabwe, so I... They're quite successful, by the way.
[01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:21.926]  So, you know, my worldwide experience being in 90 countries, including 200 locations in Ukraine, you know, has really given me an insight much broader than you would expect.
[01:14:21.926 --> 01:14:23.227]  Aren't the Ukrainian ladies beautiful?
[01:14:23.727 --> 01:14:24.987]  Oh, they all are over there.
[01:14:24.987 --> 01:14:26.008]  It's amazing.
[01:14:26.008 --> 01:14:28.688]  I'd like to take a little credit for it.
[01:14:28.688 --> 01:14:33.509]  We've been pinning them up and helping them restore their beauty.
[01:14:33.509 --> 01:14:34.769]  But back to the Governor.
[01:14:34.769 --> 01:14:39.810]  One of the opportunities I had was to really speak truth to power.
[01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:44.391]  And I believe the Texas government is an amazing thing.
[01:14:44.391 --> 01:14:51.733]  I was one of 150 people on the platform, on the podium when the Governor gave his speech, and he and the Lieutenant Governor.
[01:14:52.333 --> 01:15:00.957]  They said to the public, and not a lot of people saw this, they said we will sign no laws that are not consistent with our Judeo-Christian values.
[01:15:00.957 --> 01:15:05.719]  You would not have heard that from any platform in any state in the country but Texas.
[01:15:05.719 --> 01:15:09.081]  In a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act, George Orwell.
[01:15:09.081 --> 01:15:10.382]  That's exactly right.
[01:15:10.382 --> 01:15:14.984]  Well I believe that, and I believe God has shown me that Texas is going to be a sanctuary.
[01:15:16.379 --> 01:15:17.840]  God has given us good governance.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.240]  See, my uncle said that.
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:19.861]  Really?
[01:15:19.861 --> 01:15:24.464]  Yeah, and he died last year, but he was a very deep Christian, very devout, and he believed that.
[01:15:24.464 --> 01:15:35.671]  You know, the Bible says that there'll be a place in the wilderness for the woman, and I believe Texas is going to be a place in the wilderness for free-minded people to go to.
[01:15:35.671 --> 01:15:36.852]  So the real free state?
[01:15:36.852 --> 01:15:45.298]  Yeah, and I believe it'll happen, and I believe that I've been privileged to spend time with the Governor and the Attorney General, by the way, who's the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the state.
[01:15:45.858 --> 01:15:49.319]  To teach them and prepare them for what's coming.
[01:15:49.319 --> 01:15:55.020]  And they've been very receptive to what I've been talking about.
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:56.760]  So, and then we had the evidence.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.920]  Well, Gary, you are slick.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:02.061]  I'm ready to buy snow cones in Antarctica right now.
[01:16:02.061 --> 01:16:05.561]  It's like you have hotness in you when Gary talks to people listening.
[01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:09.342]  I tell you, when you got the truth on your side, it's pretty interesting.
[01:16:09.342 --> 01:16:09.902]  Absolutely.
[01:16:09.902 --> 01:16:10.962]  And that's the beauty of it.
[01:16:10.962 --> 01:16:13.503]  And again, I commend you for telling the truth to so many people.
[01:16:15.049 --> 01:16:21.556]  Well, we saw the evidence of the governor being willing to protect the citizens of his state.
[01:16:21.556 --> 01:16:25.620]  And repeat that, you told him, you said it earlier, but you got caught up in the break.
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:36.992]  I mean, because you told me this again back in February, and you just talked to him like a month before, specifically when he was sworn in, specifically you said you're going to have this challenge, it's going to happen, and then describe how he was like, really?
[01:16:37.332 --> 01:16:38.193]  Yeah.
[01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:46.019]  Keep in mind, when Greg Abbott was the Attorney General of Texas, he sued the federal government 28 times, more than anybody has ever done before.
[01:16:46.019 --> 01:16:51.864]  Everything from the EPA, you know, coming into Texas trying to dictate.
[01:16:51.864 --> 01:16:56.808]  He won the only Ten Commandments defense.
[01:16:56.808 --> 01:17:00.792]  He's put thousands of DPS on the border and they're calling him a kook trying to remove him.
[01:17:01.747 --> 01:17:07.673]  So this man is already very, very knowledgeable in the overreach of the federal government.
[01:17:07.673 --> 01:17:18.443]  But I was in a meeting with him early on and I said, do you realize that the president can take command of the Texas National Guard away from you?
[01:17:18.443 --> 01:17:19.564]  And he didn't know that.
[01:17:20.333 --> 01:17:26.657]  And I showed him the evidence of it under the National Defense Authorization Act, and he was pretty astounded.
[01:17:26.657 --> 01:17:27.818]  Yeah, 2007.
[01:17:27.818 --> 01:17:28.058]  Yeah.
[01:17:28.058 --> 01:17:29.779]  Well, the 2012 was really the nasty one.
[01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:33.521]  You're right, but it started with the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and then Obama accelerated it.
[01:17:33.521 --> 01:17:35.883]  And they simply renewed it each year.
[01:17:35.883 --> 01:17:39.705]  And the Republicans have signed on to this as well as the Democrats.
[01:17:39.705 --> 01:17:41.386]  That's kind of another topic, but let's touch on it.
[01:17:41.386 --> 01:17:42.607]  No, go over it.
[01:17:42.607 --> 01:17:43.788]  We're going to skip this network break.
[01:17:43.788 --> 01:17:44.028]  Go ahead.
[01:17:44.628 --> 01:17:48.290]  You know, we know the Democrats are sold-out socialists.
[01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:50.532]  You know, they have bought the electorate.
[01:17:50.532 --> 01:17:51.493]  Openly evil.
[01:17:51.493 --> 01:17:52.193]  Yeah.
[01:17:52.193 --> 01:17:54.575]  And you know your enemy, that's one thing.
[01:17:54.575 --> 01:18:00.339]  But the Republicans, the establishment Republicans, are the enemy in our own camp.
[01:18:00.339 --> 01:18:01.559]  They're the real danger.
[01:18:01.559 --> 01:18:05.722]  I was explaining this to John Cornyn, Senator Cornyn from Texas.
[01:18:05.722 --> 01:18:06.623]  Tell the crowd right out there.
[01:18:06.623 --> 01:18:07.283]  There's a camera.
[01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:13.948]  I said, Senator, you know, you've got one foot in the conservative camp and one foot in the establishment camp.
[01:18:15.148 --> 01:18:16.709]  You need to make your mind up.
[01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:24.034]  Because you are an enemy in our camp, and you're more dangerous than an enemy on our border.
[01:18:24.034 --> 01:18:25.675]  And you've got to make your mind up.
[01:18:25.675 --> 01:18:27.156]  And he had an interesting response.
[01:18:28.052 --> 01:18:30.554]  Gary, I can't disagree with the thing you said.
[01:18:30.554 --> 01:18:32.796]  That's pretty astounding.
[01:18:32.796 --> 01:18:34.558]  Well, he admitted he's an enemy.
[01:18:34.558 --> 01:18:38.021]  Well, he admitted he's got one foot in the establishment camp.
[01:18:38.021 --> 01:18:44.507]  And so we've got to realize, as American citizens, that the Republican Party is not our hope either.
[01:18:44.507 --> 01:18:49.532]  They're as bought and paid for by the moneyed interest as the Democrats.
[01:18:49.532 --> 01:18:51.274]  It's just that they still claim some
[01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:53.816]  I don't think so.
[01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:13.243]  Our solution to our country is not going to come in the political realm.
[01:19:13.243 --> 01:19:23.175]  It's going to come with a number of Americans waking up and thinking critically so that they can make informed decisions about what's going on out there.
[01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:24.517]  Evidence that's all around us.
[01:19:24.517 --> 01:19:26.159]  It's an info war.
[01:19:26.159 --> 01:19:27.620]  Very good.
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:28.722]  It's amazing you worked that in.
[01:19:29.710 --> 01:19:32.170]  I mean, it's true, but specifically back to the Providence.
[01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:37.011]  So you're there with the governor and you say you're going to have to make this decision on a federal takeover.
[01:19:37.011 --> 01:19:40.012]  I mean, you told me, you said, I believe it's coming.
[01:19:40.012 --> 01:19:42.272]  And we described that conversation.
[01:19:42.272 --> 01:19:46.413]  Yeah, I said to, he was the attorney general about to be sworn in.
[01:19:46.413 --> 01:19:50.213]  And I said, you're going to be the most important governor in the history of Texas.
[01:19:50.213 --> 01:19:51.314]  And he said, how so?
[01:19:51.314 --> 01:19:52.294]  And he looked perplexed.
[01:19:52.294 --> 01:19:58.935]  And I said, because you're going to be in a position to have to decide whether to be compliant to an out of control
[01:19:59.835 --> 01:20:05.320]  Federal government, or to stand for the rights and freedoms of the Texas citizens.
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:08.262]  And you can see his reaction to that.
[01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:11.345]  It was very, very meaningful to him.
[01:20:11.345 --> 01:20:25.076]  And just two weeks ago, we saw the evidence of him making that kind of decision, when he ordered the Texas National Guard to observe all of these special ops troops that are going to be operating in Texas under the Jade Helm program.
[01:20:25.236 --> 01:20:27.737]  And quote, doing suspicious things.
[01:20:27.737 --> 01:20:35.901]  And then they give speeches and admit this at one city council, and then go and speak in Bastrop to the county council and say they never said any of that.
[01:20:35.901 --> 01:20:39.043]  I mean, it's just, we have their own document.
[01:20:40.046 --> 01:20:40.466]  Yeah.
[01:20:40.466 --> 01:20:42.407]  You remember Jack LaLanne, the exercise guy?
[01:20:42.407 --> 01:20:43.267]  Yes.
[01:20:43.267 --> 01:20:43.868]  Most people do.
[01:20:43.868 --> 01:20:44.848]  He had the longest running team.
[01:20:44.848 --> 01:20:46.108]  He was a friend of mine.
[01:20:46.108 --> 01:20:50.410]  And he used to say that he always told the truth because he has such a poor memory.
[01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:51.571]  Me too.
[01:20:51.571 --> 01:20:53.171]  I tell you, man.
[01:20:53.171 --> 01:20:55.112]  All these people apparently have poor memories.
[01:20:55.112 --> 01:20:59.354]  You know, when you're trying to keep all these stories together that are not based in fact, you end up exposing it.
[01:20:59.694 --> 01:21:04.317]  That's why we have an opportunity to take our country back.
[01:21:04.317 --> 01:21:09.360]  Because the things that these people in power do are based on deceit.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.982]  And they can't get away with it if enough people are thinking clearly.
[01:21:12.982 --> 01:21:17.465]  Well, and that's why they want to make the world so complex and confusing with all these false stories, because I'm 41.
[01:21:17.465 --> 01:21:20.726]  In the past, I had a near-photographic memory with text.
[01:21:22.088 --> 01:21:23.689]  Uh, and on also photos.
[01:21:23.689 --> 01:21:25.992]  Now, it's from stress and everything else.
[01:21:25.992 --> 01:21:27.434]  It's still a good memory, but not as good.
[01:21:27.434 --> 01:21:31.319]  I kind of, you know, they say you can make a couple hundred decisions a day, and then you start getting fuzzy.
[01:21:31.319 --> 01:21:35.043]  And that's why I want to work till seven or eight at night, but after that, I just, it doesn't work anymore.
[01:21:35.043 --> 01:21:38.007]  I mean, it's like I'm kind of done, or I go take a nap, but...
[01:21:39.239 --> 01:21:45.945]  People, my kids ask me questions, or family does, and I caught myself the last few years, I'd go, oh yeah, yeah, this is how it is.
[01:21:45.945 --> 01:21:50.449]  Not lying on purpose, but not being able to remember, so just saying something.
[01:21:50.449 --> 01:21:53.852]  And now I've just learned how to just go, I don't remember, or I gotta think about that.
[01:21:54.412 --> 01:21:56.093]  And I guess it's something you have to get used to.
[01:21:56.093 --> 01:22:04.138]  And now I realize when I ask my grandpa something, he'd go, uh... Because, you know, they've got the knowledge.
[01:22:04.138 --> 01:22:06.139]  You just don't want to dredge it all up.
[01:22:06.139 --> 01:22:13.683]  And I think that's where they've gotten the American people, where they're just so poleaxed with so much data that they kind of just curl up in a ball.
[01:22:13.683 --> 01:22:16.485]  What I'm saying is, don't curl up in a ball.
[01:22:16.485 --> 01:22:21.748]  Go read what the globalists are saying on the Council of Foreign Relations and Club of Rome and Bilderberg and Davos.
[01:22:22.228 --> 01:22:27.010]  They're in the news today calling for planetary government run by them.
[01:22:27.010 --> 01:22:31.252]  That's, though, because that's in scholarly papers between themselves.
[01:22:31.252 --> 01:22:44.259]  Then they have CNN come out and say it doesn't exist, but if you just... All we do is go past them to the executive orders, to the Jade Helm document, to the... As a corporate executive, you go to the bottom line, to the corporate papers.
[01:22:44.259 --> 01:22:48.801]  I mean, you just get past all the phlegm phlegm and all the stuff to the heart of the matter.
[01:22:49.523 --> 01:22:52.686]  Yeah, just stay on message is what we all have to do.
[01:22:52.686 --> 01:22:57.449]  You know, I have, at my age, I have more of a Polaroid memory.
[01:22:57.449 --> 01:23:00.111]  I have to take the picture and let it sit there and develop.
[01:23:00.111 --> 01:23:00.632]  Exactly.
[01:23:00.632 --> 01:23:02.533]  Before I can remember it.
[01:23:02.533 --> 01:23:10.920]  But people, if they stay on the basic facts, which is, you know, you're not getting the truth from the media, it's bought and paid for.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:12.241]  If we're over in Ukraine,
[01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:16.604]  Picking a fight with a nuclear opponent is probably not the best idea.
[01:23:16.604 --> 01:23:20.007]  You know, these are not concepts that are complicated or too difficult.
[01:23:20.007 --> 01:23:23.410]  But stay on message and really think about the things that are important.
[01:23:23.410 --> 01:23:26.573]  Printing money to buy your own debt.
[01:23:26.573 --> 01:23:28.614]  It's a real simple concept.
[01:23:28.614 --> 01:23:31.337]  You don't have to understand derivatives and all that kind of stuff.
[01:23:31.337 --> 01:23:32.878]  Just a bad idea.
[01:23:32.878 --> 01:23:35.860]  No country in history has been able to do it and survive.
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:37.101]  How far do you think it can go?
[01:23:38.002 --> 01:23:47.950]  I mean, how much, because obviously we've gone past Weimar, past Zimbabwe, in the total real metric of money digital issuances.
[01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:52.514]  Now they've got computers and more manipulative systems, but we're seeing the signs of it everywhere.
[01:23:52.514 --> 01:24:00.081]  I mean, how far, as a real business expert, you know, a guy who bootstrapped sort of one of the most successful chains in history and other corporations.
[01:24:00.081 --> 01:24:03.624]  I was reading online in Forbes, you started dozens of different successful companies and
[01:24:04.344 --> 01:24:06.265]  So, and I really respect that.
[01:24:06.265 --> 01:24:07.946]  That's rock star to me.
[01:24:07.946 --> 01:24:11.989]  As people that are actually entrepreneurs, you know, I know Paul DiGiorgio.
[01:24:11.989 --> 01:24:12.969]  I mean, I think he's a rock star.
[01:24:12.969 --> 01:24:16.231]  He's a patriot as well, but kind of keeps it on the low down a little bit.
[01:24:16.231 --> 01:24:17.772]  He lives here in Austin.
[01:24:17.772 --> 01:24:18.293]  Absolutely.
[01:24:18.293 --> 01:24:18.933]  I bet you know him.
[01:24:18.933 --> 01:24:20.014]  I don't want to speak for him.
[01:24:20.014 --> 01:24:21.014]  We could probably get him on the show.
[01:24:21.014 --> 01:24:23.155]  I just kind of... Anyways, I'm not going to get into that, but I know him.
[01:24:25.973 --> 01:24:27.775]  How far can it go?
[01:24:27.775 --> 01:24:29.796]  Let me give you two answers real quick.
[01:24:29.796 --> 01:24:35.541]  This is a great example that I shared with Senator Cornyn at dinner one day.
[01:24:35.541 --> 01:24:47.531]  If you took the spending of the United States government, and you took away all the zeroes, and let's take the $3.5 trillion that they spent this year, and you reduced it to $35,000.
[01:24:50.813 --> 01:24:55.257]  That would be the annual spending of our household budget.
[01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:57.799]  And then we took in $2 trillion in taxes.
[01:24:57.799 --> 01:25:04.765]  And that $2 trillion includes the trust fund for Social Security and Medicare that's supposed to be set aside and saved.
[01:25:04.765 --> 01:25:05.766]  There's no trust fund.
[01:25:05.766 --> 01:25:07.087]  And there's a good example too.
[01:25:07.087 --> 01:25:08.128]  There is no trust fund.
[01:25:08.128 --> 01:25:09.149]  There's just IOUs.
[01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:10.310]  There's no Social Security fund.
[01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:11.311]  There's no Medicare fund.
[01:25:11.311 --> 01:25:11.951]  It's gone.
[01:25:11.951 --> 01:25:12.552]  It's been spent.
[01:25:12.552 --> 01:25:13.453]  Spent in the general budget.
[01:25:14.253 --> 01:25:27.385]  But if your income is $20,000, which is 2 trillion without the zeros, and you're spending $35,000, which is 3.5 trillion without the zeros, how long can your household manage that budget?
[01:25:27.385 --> 01:25:28.766]  Now here's the other problem.
[01:25:28.766 --> 01:25:33.730]  You've got $18 trillion in debt that has to be serviced every month, so your credit card is $180,000.
[01:25:36.092 --> 01:25:41.634]  So you make it $20,000, you spend $35,000, and you're trying to service $180,000 in credit.
[01:25:41.634 --> 01:25:47.116]  If you were household, you'd be bankrupt.
[01:25:47.116 --> 01:25:59.421]  And then if you took the unfunded liabilities, it's not just the $18 trillion our government owes, it's the Social Security, it's the federal pensions, it's all the other things, and it's a minimal, conservatively, $100 trillion.
[01:26:00.541 --> 01:26:07.724]  If you take $100 trillion and divide it among 100 million American families, which is how many of us there are, that's $1 million per family.
[01:26:07.724 --> 01:26:08.444]  Let's go further.
[01:26:08.444 --> 01:26:13.646]  Now there's $2.2 quadrillion globally in fake derivatives that we don't know that they say we do.
[01:26:13.646 --> 01:26:14.267]  The U.S.
[01:26:14.267 --> 01:26:15.887]  says half of those.
[01:26:15.887 --> 01:26:17.068]  So $1.1 trillion.
[01:26:17.068 --> 01:26:21.590]  If you add $1.1 trillion to $100 trillion, that's $1.2 trillion.
[01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:23.511]  Can we divide that to 100 million households, please?
[01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:24.191]  I can't do it.
[01:26:24.811 --> 01:26:25.512]  I don't either.
[01:26:25.512 --> 01:26:30.635]  Guys, can you or the calculator do... I mean, I don't think the calculator goes that high, but I think it does.
[01:26:30.635 --> 01:26:32.616]  Divide 1.2 quadrille, 1,200 trillion, into 100 million.
[01:26:32.616 --> 01:26:33.657]  There you go.
[01:26:33.657 --> 01:26:35.078]  It's going to be a big number.
[01:26:41.182 --> 01:26:44.987]  You know what it is, it's probably $10 million per household.
[01:26:44.987 --> 01:26:50.773]  But you know, just to keep it simple, you know the real, the things that I think the average American gets their hand around for $12 million.
[01:26:50.773 --> 01:26:54.898]  A million bucks per family, the average family makes $50,000 a year.
[01:26:54.898 --> 01:26:57.021]  How are we going to pay that debt off?
[01:26:58.643 --> 01:27:00.404]  It's mathematically impossible.
[01:27:00.404 --> 01:27:03.466]  Well, their answer is army tanks, checkpoints, and forced labor.
[01:27:03.466 --> 01:27:04.666]  It's Cloward and Pevin.
[01:27:04.666 --> 01:27:05.727]  They collapse everything.
[01:27:05.727 --> 01:27:09.009]  We'll be begging for troops when there's people running around burning everything.
[01:27:09.009 --> 01:27:16.554]  And you've got the Justice Department in there taking some problems that are there, stirring it up for a war on police, just like Ukraine, just like they financed the overthrow there.
[01:27:16.554 --> 01:27:17.715]  They're getting ready to do it here.
[01:27:17.715 --> 01:27:20.877]  And I'll be saying bring the troops in.
[01:27:20.877 --> 01:27:22.638]  I mean, you know, they've got it figured out.
[01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:30.149]  Now shifting gears into Mike Norris and he said, hey, I don't mind talking about my dad.
[01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:33.732]  So he was talking about him, you know, like he's his, you know, biggest hero.
[01:27:33.732 --> 01:27:37.714]  And we were at dinner and stuff because he said, hey, it wouldn't be if it wasn't for Chuck Norris.
[01:27:37.714 --> 01:27:39.615]  Chuck Norris, incredibly private guy.
[01:27:39.615 --> 01:27:41.476]  You were telling me amazing stuff.
[01:27:41.476 --> 01:27:44.418]  I talked to some Hollywood stunt drivers and people that I know.
[01:27:44.418 --> 01:27:45.839]  They go, oh yeah, it's all true and more.
[01:27:45.839 --> 01:27:47.220]  He's just over the top.
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.961]  Some of the behind the scenes stuff or
[01:27:50.137 --> 01:27:53.100]  I mean, some of it's so cool, I don't even know if you can even tell these stories.
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:59.125]  And then Steve McQueen and everything else, over the top.
[01:27:59.125 --> 01:28:00.826]  We're celebrating Americana.
[01:28:00.826 --> 01:28:04.049]  What is more Americana than Chuck Norris?
[01:28:04.049 --> 01:28:04.950]  Maybe John Wayne?
[01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:12.637]  No, I don't think so, because John Wayne was a patriot, but he really wasn't the Taekwondo champion and all the rest of it.
[01:28:12.637 --> 01:28:15.940]  Tell us what's going on with the current Chuck Norris planet.
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:17.001]  I mean, there's this planet Norris.
[01:28:18.108 --> 01:28:20.930]  Yeah, it is.
[01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:27.894]  You know, it's so great being Chuck Norris' son.
[01:28:27.894 --> 01:28:34.738]  When I was 13, 14 years old, it was just like this, a front seat to seeing a movie star being created.
[01:28:36.974 --> 01:28:41.057]  You know, in a strange way, it's kind of a lot like what's going on now.
[01:28:41.057 --> 01:28:48.423]  It was perfect timing in the late 70s, early 80s for a new American hero to be born.
[01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.644]  And that was my dad.
[01:28:49.644 --> 01:28:52.527]  My dad was that new American.
[01:28:52.527 --> 01:28:53.408]  He's the new John Wayne.
[01:28:54.088 --> 01:28:55.469]  And it was great.
[01:28:55.469 --> 01:29:02.215]  What a blessing to watch this happen and how it changed my world.
[01:29:02.215 --> 01:29:05.377]  You know, as kids, my dad was a karate teacher.
[01:29:05.377 --> 01:29:09.241]  So every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, we packed up in the station wagon.
[01:29:09.881 --> 01:29:14.664]  We went to a car dealership, did a karate demonstration, trying to get students into the karate.
[01:29:14.664 --> 01:29:17.065]  Of course, he'd been in the military before that, an MP.
[01:29:17.065 --> 01:29:18.466]  Yeah, he was in Korea.
[01:29:18.466 --> 01:29:21.008]  He learned karate in Korea.
[01:29:21.008 --> 01:29:21.468]  Stay there!
[01:29:21.468 --> 01:29:22.649]  You have the floor, we return.
[01:29:22.649 --> 01:29:23.009]  Promise?
[01:29:23.009 --> 01:29:25.791]  You may have to go, we need to get you some water, whatever.
[01:29:25.791 --> 01:29:28.372]  But Mike Norris is here, and it's exciting.
[01:29:28.372 --> 01:29:34.096]  I want you, I heard two hours of it, but I want you to get to hear some of this stuff, because it's amazing.
[01:29:36.357 --> 01:29:38.999]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen, with Mike Norris.
[01:29:38.999 --> 01:29:44.942]  You can just actually go over and just pat him and... There he is, right there.
[01:29:44.942 --> 01:29:45.963]  We'll be back.
[01:29:45.963 --> 01:29:47.524]  But we're not worth it!
[01:29:47.524 --> 01:29:48.905]  We're on the march.
[01:29:48.905 --> 01:29:51.446]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.446 --> 01:29:54.108]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.274 --> 01:29:59.995]  Think you've got nothing to hide?
[01:29:59.995 --> 01:30:08.218]  Well, a group of activists is challenging that mentality by placing hidden tape recorders throughout New York to protest the NSA.
[01:30:08.218 --> 01:30:22.243]  The campaign, called We Are Always Listening, is currently collecting private conversations of unsuspecting citizens and then uploading those intimate conversations online in an attempt to discredit that nothing-to-hide narrative.
[01:30:22.243 --> 01:30:23.384]  The group's website says
[01:30:23.684 --> 01:30:33.115]  Citizens don't seem to mind this monitoring, so we're hiding recorders in public places in hopes of gathering information to help win the war on terror.
[01:30:33.115 --> 01:30:41.745]  The site encourages those who are angry about surveillance to contact Congress as Section 215 of the Patriot Act reaches expiration on June 1st.
[01:30:42.446 --> 01:30:52.156]  You can listen to some of those audio recordings embedded in the article, activists place hidden tape recorders throughout New York to protest NSA at InfoWars.com.
[01:30:52.156 --> 01:30:55.019]  This is Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.

[01:31:53.156 --> 01:31:54.976]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:31:57.797 --> 01:32:00.439]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:00.439 --> 01:32:01.920]  Check it out today.
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:10.307]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none, and that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:10.307 --> 01:32:17.432]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[01:32:18.072 --> 01:32:20.533]  Or because they're not 100% organic.
[01:32:20.533 --> 01:32:27.156]  Or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:27.156 --> 01:32:38.060]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder, I believe
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:38.780]  We're good.
[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:13.648]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:13.648 --> 01:33:15.552]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.608 --> 01:33:32.229]  Don't think, Mr. Gray, that we don't know what you're up to.
[01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:34.811]  Stockpiling food, weapons, fuel.
[01:33:34.811 --> 01:33:42.515]  The National Defense Authorization Act is there to stop domestic terrorist threats to this country and people like you.
[01:33:42.515 --> 01:33:45.036]  I am an American.
[01:33:45.036 --> 01:33:46.277]  I am a patriot.
[01:33:46.277 --> 01:33:49.098]  You, sir, are nothing but a traitor.
[01:33:49.098 --> 01:33:55.101]  I've never seen anything like that in my life.
[01:33:55.101 --> 01:33:56.702]  That man's a threat to this country.
[01:34:05.385 --> 01:34:08.847]  That little rant will be all over the news tonight.
[01:34:08.847 --> 01:34:12.188]  You must understand this plays into our hands.
[01:34:12.188 --> 01:34:15.430]  The American news media has our narrative.
[01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:21.812]  And in that narrative, Charlie Gray is perfectly playing the role of right-wing extremist.
[01:34:21.812 --> 01:34:30.376]  The stigma of that label will stop up the years of the American public faster than any propaganda we can fashion.
[01:34:30.376 --> 01:34:33.818]  America hitting theaters and your
[01:34:35.299 --> 01:34:46.865]  Online viewing as well, or there with the Netflix, you name it, on the online systems, TV systems, coming up in November, December of 2015, could not be a better time.
[01:34:46.865 --> 01:35:00.172]  It deals with internationalists, globalists, using the federal government to basically bring in a creeping tyranny and a seizure of the infrastructure of the country, just like the TPP is doing, and if we ever try to say no, then they bring in the force.
[01:35:00.172 --> 01:35:01.533]  Now, without further ado,
[01:35:02.653 --> 01:35:12.483]  We've got Gary Haven in here, entrepreneur, the creator of the largest successful franchise in world history according to Forbes, Curves, which he retired from a few years ago.
[01:35:12.483 --> 01:35:19.910]  And then of course we have Mike Norris, 20 plus films, some of the top Christian films, other films, TV shows, mainline TV shows he's produced.
[01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:23.354]  Of course working with his father and others, but doing a lot of his own productions.
[01:35:23.354 --> 01:35:24.415]  That is Mike Norris.
[01:35:24.415 --> 01:35:24.655]  Okay.
[01:35:24.975 --> 01:35:27.716]  We've only got this segment and one more, maybe a little bit of overdrive.
[01:35:27.716 --> 01:35:33.219]  You've been a trooper sitting there while we talk about the New World Order, but thank you for coming down to Austin from Dallas for folks who just joined us.
[01:35:33.219 --> 01:35:40.322]  Mike Norris, tell us about the real Chuck Norris, because a bunch of this stuff's not known.
[01:35:40.322 --> 01:35:42.243]  Wow, the real Chuck Norris.
[01:35:42.243 --> 01:35:43.824]  He's even cooler than what we heard!
[01:35:44.798 --> 01:35:58.661]  You know, he really is an amazing man that has done so many amazing things, not only for the country, for the troops, but for his family and for his friends.
[01:35:58.661 --> 01:35:59.821]  Just a huge blessing.
[01:35:59.821 --> 01:36:01.962]  Just a huge blessing.
[01:36:01.962 --> 01:36:02.482]  Absolutely.
[01:36:02.482 --> 01:36:04.262]  Well, I mean, you told us so many of the stories.
[01:36:04.262 --> 01:36:05.683]  I don't think you even need that earpiece.
[01:36:05.683 --> 01:36:06.863]  They can take it off.
[01:36:07.654 --> 01:36:10.435]  It's just dangling there.
[01:36:10.435 --> 01:36:12.176]  I know it's hard to talk about your dad, but it's also fun.
[01:36:12.176 --> 01:36:14.717]  When we're sitting around eating Mexican food, though, you were telling the stories.
[01:36:14.717 --> 01:36:16.038]  Where should we begin?
[01:36:16.038 --> 01:36:24.042]  Let's start at the beginning, where you just ended, driving in the station wagon every weekend to recruit folks for karate class.
[01:36:24.702 --> 01:36:37.105]  And it was my dad and I, we had this routine we did together, you know, we'd be walking across each other, he'd bump into me, we'd do a fight scene, and, you know, we'd go, go to Chuck Norris Karate schools!
[01:36:37.105 --> 01:36:46.187]  So, he ended up losing his karate schools, and he was teaching Steve McQueen private lessons, and Steve goes, why don't you just become an actor?
[01:36:46.187 --> 01:36:48.808]  And he's like, well, I can't talk in front of people.
[01:36:48.808 --> 01:36:52.689]  He says, let everybody else do all the talking, you say what's important.
[01:36:53.758 --> 01:36:57.359]  And that's kind of how Chuck Norris started in the cinema.
[01:36:57.359 --> 01:37:04.481]  But while that was all taking place, we'd go out to California, we'd go motorcycle riding with Steve McQueen.
[01:37:04.481 --> 01:37:05.481]  I'll never forget.
[01:37:05.481 --> 01:37:09.322]  Steve McQueen, tighter rope around his stomach.
[01:37:09.322 --> 01:37:12.823]  I was on an Indian motorcycle and I was going in circles.
[01:37:12.823 --> 01:37:16.804]  And he was just teaching me how to ride a motorcycle at nine years old.
[01:37:16.804 --> 01:37:19.145]  I'm like going, wow, this is pretty cool.
[01:37:19.145 --> 01:37:22.826]  I've talked to folks in Hollywood and they say Steve McQueen is hands down the coolest ever.
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:25.461]  Had to be.
[01:37:25.461 --> 01:37:26.264]  He was great.
[01:37:26.264 --> 01:37:27.087]  He was great.
[01:37:27.087 --> 01:37:30.258]  And later on in life, his son and I, Chad, did a movie together.
[01:37:32.057 --> 01:37:32.998]  It was really fun.
[01:37:32.998 --> 01:37:36.981]  My dad had a lot of very interesting people that he taught karate to.
[01:37:36.981 --> 01:37:39.482]  Bob Barker is a black belt.
[01:37:39.482 --> 01:37:43.025]  He did that fight scene in that Adam Sandler movie, Happy Madison.
[01:37:43.025 --> 01:37:45.547]  Knocked him out!
[01:37:45.547 --> 01:37:52.252]  And so as a kid, I just get up, I go with my dad, I'll sit there, he teaches class, we go home together.
[01:37:52.252 --> 01:37:56.895]  It was when he started making films that it was just such a meteoric rise.
[01:37:58.456 --> 01:38:03.180]  Like we were talking about, our country at that time needed a hero.
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:06.964]  And our country, at this time, needs a wake-up call.
[01:38:06.964 --> 01:38:10.387]  And that's what, you know, we're providing for the country.
[01:38:10.387 --> 01:38:11.668]  What my dad did back then.
[01:38:14.022 --> 01:38:22.949]  Yeah, because the globalists were putting us through a process of demonizing America, blaming America's problems on Americana, when Americana was the answer to the globalist poison.
[01:38:22.949 --> 01:38:30.356]  Just like they're doing now, he was a pro-America hero that people needed, and notice today he's speaking out against the globalists.
[01:38:30.356 --> 01:38:34.099]  Let's get into Bruce Lee.
[01:38:34.099 --> 01:38:34.619]  Bruce Lee.
[01:38:38.024 --> 01:38:46.268]  My dad and Bruce met a number of times, and there's a lot of stories that you could read online about my dad and Bruce training together.
[01:38:46.268 --> 01:38:47.588]  Yeah, but you told us some that nobody knows.
[01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:51.830]  Tell us some of those.
[01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:59.294]  I fought in a karate tournament, and I'd won, and my dad was going to fight that night, but Bruce Lee was there, and I'm getting a picture with Bruce Lee, and I'm like,
[01:39:00.305 --> 01:39:02.746]  Oh my gosh, this is Bruce Lee, but I'll never forget.
[01:39:02.746 --> 01:39:06.627]  There was a guy in the audience and he kept looking and staring.
[01:39:06.627 --> 01:39:14.670]  I kept looking back at the guy and finally Bruce just grabbed my face and put it forward like this and we snapped the picture.
[01:39:14.670 --> 01:39:18.712]  It was amazing and to this day I still have that picture of Bruce Lee.
[01:39:18.712 --> 01:39:24.814]  But growing up in our household was very adventurous.
[01:39:24.814 --> 01:39:27.775]  For some reason my father was a magnet.
[01:39:29.022 --> 01:39:30.923]  For anybody that needed help.
[01:39:30.923 --> 01:39:32.663]  And we shared a lot of stories.
[01:39:32.663 --> 01:39:34.263]  And they're all things I can say over here.
[01:39:34.263 --> 01:39:35.024]  It's no problem.
[01:39:35.024 --> 01:39:41.265]  But, you know, a Sunday morning, I'm 11 years old, there's somebody banging on the front door.
[01:39:41.265 --> 01:39:48.087]  And I come to the front door, I open up and there's some guy there with a samurai sword going, where's Chuck Norris?
[01:39:48.087 --> 01:39:50.628]  So people wanted to come fight him.
[01:39:50.628 --> 01:39:51.148]  These are his
[01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:52.831]  He was a guru!
[01:39:52.831 --> 01:39:53.071]  Oh my god.
[01:40:14.175 --> 01:40:15.155]  Get some out of there.
[01:40:15.155 --> 01:40:20.357]  Oh, we've had people come stay at our house and said they were relatives, spent the night.
[01:40:20.357 --> 01:40:27.479]  We're all stuck in a bedroom, my mom, my dad, my brother and I. And my dad's going to my mom going, don't you understand?
[01:40:27.479 --> 01:40:30.440]  I can kick this guy's butt.
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:33.041]  And he's got control of the house and we're locked in a little room.
[01:40:33.041 --> 01:40:36.782]  We've got some guy walking around the house saying he's our Uncle Gene from Oklahoma.
[01:40:38.523 --> 01:40:39.684]  Tons of stories like that.
[01:40:39.684 --> 01:40:58.636]  It was so exciting to, especially like, just kind of go back to that time when life was simple and... When did your dad become, you know, from kind of a mainline conservative constitutionalist, I know he's a big fan of the Founding Fathers, I read his columns, I read one he wrote a few years ago, it was great about, you know, why we need another George Washington or more George Washingtons.
[01:40:58.636 --> 01:41:04.560]  When did his views, when did he become aware of the New World Order, the globalists, the larger program?
[01:41:05.066 --> 01:41:17.573]  You know, I think that really came on after we were done doing Walker, Texas Ranger when, in a sense, he kind of retired really from acting is after Walker.
[01:41:17.573 --> 01:41:18.754]  I don't recall him.
[01:41:18.754 --> 01:41:27.138]  We did Expendables, but you know, I think after Walker, it gave him time to kind of read, reflect, investigate.
[01:41:27.138 --> 01:41:28.839]  He's always been political.
[01:41:28.839 --> 01:41:29.220]  He's been
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:33.102]  You know, I've been great friends with the President.
[01:41:33.102 --> 01:41:34.323]  I don't want to speak for him.
[01:41:34.323 --> 01:41:36.284]  He's been on the show a few times.
[01:41:36.284 --> 01:41:37.865]  Six, seven, eight years ago and a few years ago.
[01:41:37.865 --> 01:41:39.706]  But he listens quite a bit on film.
[01:41:39.706 --> 01:41:41.167]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:41.167 --> 01:41:42.728]  And I called him while we were filming.
[01:41:42.728 --> 01:41:47.572]  I go, Dad, Alex Jones is coming to play a part in our movie.
[01:41:47.572 --> 01:41:48.532]  And he was so excited.
[01:41:48.532 --> 01:41:49.713]  He goes, really?
[01:41:49.713 --> 01:41:50.994]  Tell Alex I love him.
[01:41:50.994 --> 01:41:52.255]  I listen to his show all the time.
[01:41:52.255 --> 01:41:53.936]  And I'm like, I will.
[01:41:53.936 --> 01:41:56.017]  It's just bizarre to have Chuck Norris as a regular listener.
[01:41:58.376 --> 01:41:59.496]  You told me a lot of other stories.
[01:41:59.496 --> 01:42:00.757]  I don't know how many of these we can tell.
[01:42:00.757 --> 01:42:04.058]  I didn't tell you anything.
[01:42:04.058 --> 01:42:06.219]  It was all good.
[01:42:06.219 --> 01:42:11.681]  It was all really good.
[01:42:11.681 --> 01:42:15.243]  It's exciting and I consider it
[01:42:16.223 --> 01:42:17.404]  I don't think so.
[01:42:33.211 --> 01:42:37.174]  Well, your dad's got to be proud of you fighting the globalists like you are right now and putting out these great Christian films.
[01:42:37.174 --> 01:42:39.215]  He's, well, he's really excited.
[01:42:39.215 --> 01:42:50.862]  He's excited that, um, obviously, you know, Gary, a guy, you know, let me remember when Mike shared with him that we were going to do this movie.
[01:42:50.862 --> 01:42:52.203]  He asked you one question.
[01:42:52.203 --> 01:42:53.304]  Are you willing to die for it?
[01:42:54.875 --> 01:42:57.096]  Oh, now we're getting to some of the stories.
[01:42:57.096 --> 01:42:59.857]  Are you willing to die for this movie?
[01:42:59.857 --> 01:43:04.740]  Because that's how important this script was.
[01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:05.640]  Chuck Norris said that?
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:08.001]  Yes.
[01:43:08.001 --> 01:43:09.182]  Wow.
[01:43:09.182 --> 01:43:10.002]  What do you mean by that?
[01:43:11.069 --> 01:43:15.294]  Who was the director on that anti-establishment film that was killed?
[01:43:15.294 --> 01:43:16.916]  Well, Dinesh D'Souza just got locked up.
[01:43:16.916 --> 01:43:18.157]  A bunch of people got killed.
[01:43:18.157 --> 01:43:24.185]  In Minnesota, a 32-year-old veteran was making the movie Grey... Grey State!
[01:43:24.185 --> 01:43:26.527]  Oh yeah, they definitely... No, it's bad.
[01:43:26.527 --> 01:43:29.951]  Believe me, I'm not trying to act like we're in danger or anything because I don't want to freak people out, but...
[01:43:30.612 --> 01:43:33.314]  I mean, this is a real deal.
[01:43:33.314 --> 01:43:46.064]  We were filming, middle of filming, and we pick up the newspaper, and this young director was found in his home with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, along with his five-year-old daughter and his wife.
[01:43:46.064 --> 01:43:47.285]  It was suspicious.
[01:43:47.285 --> 01:43:49.287]  People who knew him said, this is impossible.
[01:43:49.287 --> 01:43:49.968]  He was excited.
[01:43:49.968 --> 01:43:54.171]  Just like the state senator that was exposed in the pedophile rings was coming on my show the next week.
[01:43:54.171 --> 01:43:55.452]  We covered it at the start of the show.
[01:43:55.452 --> 01:43:57.674]  She got executed at her house in a murder-suicide.
[01:43:58.464 --> 01:44:03.689]  So when we heard this, I told Mike, I said, man, I'm glad I'm not the director on this movie.
[01:44:03.689 --> 01:44:09.734]  Well, you know, they're scared of movies and your dad's right.
[01:44:09.734 --> 01:44:12.056]  So, so, so your dad thinks this is a dangerous film.
[01:44:12.056 --> 01:44:12.896]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:44:12.896 --> 01:44:13.877]  But he was saying, go for it.
[01:44:13.877 --> 01:44:14.538]  He was warning you.
[01:44:15.359 --> 01:44:16.940]  I think he was proud.
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:21.883]  I think we need to be more bold.
[01:44:21.883 --> 01:44:22.203]  I agree.
[01:44:22.203 --> 01:44:24.024]  We need to speak up.
[01:44:24.024 --> 01:44:27.947]  Well look, you're doing some bold stuff right now.
[01:44:27.947 --> 01:44:31.469]  Full disclosure, a lot of my knowledge has come from Gary.
[01:44:31.469 --> 01:44:35.151]  Hey, don't blame me.
[01:44:35.151 --> 01:44:36.352]  All the money's come from Gary.
[01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:40.563]  We gotta make this film hit big.
[01:44:40.563 --> 01:44:42.766]  Yeah, and it's coming together good.
[01:44:42.766 --> 01:44:45.992]  And that's why it's fun to come in here and talk about it.
[01:44:45.992 --> 01:44:48.796]  You play such a key role in the opening of the film.
[01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:52.361]  That's a long scene.
[01:44:52.361 --> 01:44:59.546]  Well, that was just a minute, but the scene is long and it sets up the rest of the movie.
[01:44:59.546 --> 01:45:06.670]  So instead of having like Blade Runner where there's a long narration about replicants of the future, you're not cop, you're little people.
[01:45:06.670 --> 01:45:09.452]  This is done in a congressional hearing where you really get everything.
[01:45:09.452 --> 01:45:09.932]  Absolutely.
[01:45:09.932 --> 01:45:10.613]  It was really smart.
[01:45:10.613 --> 01:45:11.633]  Again, who wrote that?
[01:45:11.633 --> 01:45:13.915]  I wrote that scene.
[01:45:13.915 --> 01:45:15.896]  In fact, I'll kind of restate it.
[01:45:15.896 --> 01:45:17.437]  That's a smart way to introduce a film.
[01:45:18.397 --> 01:45:30.584]  Yeah, and the movie opens where I'm the Charlie Gray, the kind of the star and the hero of the movie, and I'm in front of a Senate hearing, and Alex plays an evil senator.
[01:45:30.584 --> 01:45:32.064]  Very, very evil.
[01:45:32.064 --> 01:45:33.445]  And we have a debate.
[01:45:33.445 --> 01:45:39.008]  I'm challenging the government to do something about protecting America from its most imminent threat.
[01:45:39.008 --> 01:45:39.969]  This is real life.
[01:45:39.969 --> 01:45:42.370]  That's an EMP attack, an electromagnetic pulse.
[01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:49.392]  And I'm calling his attention that the Congress has already determined it's the number one threat.
[01:45:49.392 --> 01:45:56.075]  And he is ridiculing me, which is what the strategy of those people do.
[01:45:56.075 --> 01:46:02.837]  And so we have this opening scene where you get a gist of what the movie is going to be about and what you should be concerned about.
[01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:14.786]  And you also get to see the political establishment kind of poo-poo this whole thing, and it's a great way to kind of get up to speed about what you're about to watch.
[01:46:14.786 --> 01:46:16.668]  Well, it's dynamite.
[01:46:16.668 --> 01:46:21.592]  The whole thing's powerful, and we just had more people doing this.
[01:46:21.592 --> 01:46:31.200]  I tell you, you can launch a whole new genre of patriot cinema, and just like, I mean, now I'll see in the top box office of the top 50 films or so, like 10 of them are Christian.
[01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:38.447]  And a lot of these have really good messages, and so that means we're starting to have victories against these people.
[01:46:38.447 --> 01:46:48.137]  Yeah, and I'm wondering if there's maybe a sliver in Hollywood that could be awake, because they have dropped hints in other big Hollywood films.
[01:46:48.137 --> 01:46:53.262]  Oh, more and more we're seeing people talk about the New World Order, like the Captain America Winter Soldier.
[01:46:53.262 --> 01:46:54.023]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:54.443 --> 01:46:59.808]  I mean, that whole thing is exposing, you know, the Hydra system and what it's doing and how it's taking our rights and the NSA.
[01:46:59.808 --> 01:47:03.331]  I mean, well, you're not in Hollywood, so you know how many people are awake out there.
[01:47:03.331 --> 01:47:08.316]  I mean, that's the thing is it came out in the news that there's thousands of closet libertarians and conservatives.
[01:47:08.316 --> 01:47:12.580]  They have secret meetings because they're not communists.
[01:47:13.881 --> 01:47:22.187]  And it goes a lot deeper in Hollywood than that, as far as the agenda in Hollywood.
[01:47:22.187 --> 01:47:23.227]  Now you're starting to go.
[01:47:23.227 --> 01:47:25.089]  Skip the network break.
[01:47:25.089 --> 01:47:29.191]  Go ahead.
[01:47:29.191 --> 01:47:29.792]  Come on!
[01:47:29.792 --> 01:47:33.494]  No, okay.
[01:47:33.494 --> 01:47:36.356]  There is an agenda in Hollywood, right?
[01:47:36.356 --> 01:47:37.357]  We know what the agenda is.
[01:47:37.357 --> 01:47:38.057]  In the family.
[01:47:38.057 --> 01:47:38.578]  It's a gay agenda?
[01:47:44.333 --> 01:47:49.135]  It's a demonic agenda.
[01:47:49.135 --> 01:47:51.816]  I saw that firsthand as an 18 year old.
[01:47:51.816 --> 01:48:02.039]  You know, back in the 80s, my dad was making movies and, hey, let's make this movie with Mike Norris and we'll just put Norris up on the thing.
[01:48:02.039 --> 01:48:04.360]  And I was like, great, I'm all in.
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:05.620]  So I was making these movies.
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:13.243]  But I was exposed at 18, 19 years old to agents that they were going to make my future.
[01:48:13.243 --> 01:48:13.543]  I said,
[01:48:15.623 --> 01:48:17.964]  If this is what it's going to take, I'm done.
[01:48:17.964 --> 01:48:22.945]  And so, I just kind of did my own thing, produced my own films, and tried to... Well, the issue is it's a cult.
[01:48:22.945 --> 01:48:26.546]  I mean, they make you get involved in this.
[01:48:26.546 --> 01:48:27.426]  They do.
[01:48:27.426 --> 01:48:28.906]  If you want to be successful.
[01:48:28.906 --> 01:48:30.246]  If you want to be successful.
[01:48:30.246 --> 01:48:37.788]  And they make you do horrendous things to be part of that culture out there.
[01:48:37.788 --> 01:48:38.588]  I don't want it.
[01:48:38.588 --> 01:48:39.589]  I live in Texas.
[01:48:39.589 --> 01:48:40.609]  My kids are Texans.
[01:48:41.618 --> 01:48:44.240]  We're going to do something right here in Texas.
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:44.800]  Hollywood can do it.
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:49.443]  And by the way, you know, because we know some of those same people, some of the biggest names in Hollywood, and they're all locked in their houses scared.
[01:48:49.443 --> 01:48:49.784]  Oh yeah.
[01:48:49.784 --> 01:48:52.465]  I mean, people, it's not like everybody's evil out there.
[01:48:52.465 --> 01:48:53.846]  They're all scared.
[01:48:53.846 --> 01:48:56.768]  There are a lot of good people in Hollywood, but they are scared.
[01:48:56.768 --> 01:49:02.472]  You know, it's, do you want to make a dollar or do you want to be honest?
[01:49:02.472 --> 01:49:04.393]  And everybody there wants to make a dollar.
[01:49:04.393 --> 01:49:04.654]  Great.
[01:49:04.654 --> 01:49:05.574]  We all want to make money.
[01:49:05.574 --> 01:49:08.096]  We all want to live, but I want to do it.
[01:49:10.117 --> 01:49:10.998]  With a purpose.
[01:49:10.998 --> 01:49:21.787]  Well, Mark Cuban, and this came out in the New York Times the year after I talked about it, was going to put like $15 million into a rollout of 1,000 screens of loose change of film that I produced.
[01:49:22.964 --> 01:49:24.545]  Partially produced.
[01:49:24.545 --> 01:49:25.846]  And it was downloaded over 100 million times.
[01:49:25.846 --> 01:49:26.407]  They saw that.
[01:49:26.407 --> 01:49:28.068]  And he said, yeah, I think false flags are interesting.
[01:49:28.068 --> 01:49:30.410]  I was there in some phone conversations with him.
[01:49:30.410 --> 01:49:31.891]  And man, all these lawyers came to the meeting.
[01:49:31.891 --> 01:49:35.794]  And I mean, Jake Bloom, you know, the biggest guys in Hollywood.
[01:49:35.794 --> 01:49:37.956]  I'm not going to get into the rest of the names.
[01:49:37.956 --> 01:49:42.800]  And I mean, it was like something out of Goodfellas.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:44.841]  And then the White House was involved.
[01:49:44.841 --> 01:49:46.242]  And I'm told, yeah, they're threatening everybody.
[01:49:47.023 --> 01:49:49.464]  And then they basically indict Mark Cuban.
[01:49:49.464 --> 01:49:50.004]  Yeah.
[01:49:50.004 --> 01:49:55.326]  And then it all came out in the New York Times later that they called him and sent emails that were going to get you, you bastard.
[01:49:55.326 --> 01:49:58.068]  You know, we send messages.
[01:49:58.068 --> 01:50:00.228]  Jake Bloom wasn't involved in that, he was just in some of these meetings.
[01:50:00.228 --> 01:50:02.229]  I'm just saying, what a character.
[01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:08.412]  And Sumner Redstone's top representative, you know, I'm not going to get into other names that were there, but I mean, I've just seen it firsthand.
[01:50:08.412 --> 01:50:09.292]  I mean, this is not a game.
[01:50:09.292 --> 01:50:09.872]  No, no, no, no.
[01:50:09.872 --> 01:50:11.233]  None of this is a game.
[01:50:11.233 --> 01:50:13.034]  No, this is not a game.
[01:50:13.034 --> 01:50:15.235]  And media is impacting
[01:50:16.155 --> 01:50:16.395]  Are you
[01:50:46.675 --> 01:50:49.117]  You've got a lot of websites.
[01:50:49.117 --> 01:50:50.337]  No, no, no, no.
[01:50:50.337 --> 01:50:50.998]  You know what?
[01:50:50.998 --> 01:50:52.378]  Talk about some of your new films.
[01:50:52.378 --> 01:50:53.779]  I want you to do it.
[01:50:53.779 --> 01:51:04.104]  Well, we've got a film out right now that's called Missionaries with Tom Arnold, Jamie Kennedy, Paul Rodriguez, Gigi Rice about a family of flying missionaries.
[01:51:04.104 --> 01:51:08.927]  It's released by Pure Flix who did God's Not Dead, Do You Believe?
[01:51:08.927 --> 01:51:14.130]  That's in any Christian bookstore anywhere in the world and soon coming to TV.
[01:51:15.050 --> 01:51:20.654]  The answer is you've got to get all these to support the industry that's countering the globalists, and then so your kids have something good to watch.
[01:51:20.654 --> 01:51:21.454]  Absolutely.
[01:51:21.454 --> 01:51:21.814]  Absolutely.
[01:51:21.814 --> 01:51:25.217]  I want to shift gears back into any other Steve McQueen stories.
[01:51:25.217 --> 01:51:25.657]  Any more?
[01:51:25.657 --> 01:51:26.357]  Come on.
[01:51:26.357 --> 01:51:27.458]  Chuck Norris.
[01:51:27.458 --> 01:51:29.199]  People want this lore.
[01:51:29.199 --> 01:51:30.380]  Yeah.
[01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:31.741]  This Cromulon lore.
[01:51:31.741 --> 01:51:32.681]  Okay.
[01:51:36.024 --> 01:51:36.204]  I'm 19, 20, 21.
[01:51:36.204 --> 01:51:37.265]  Somewhere in there.
[01:51:52.461 --> 01:51:54.861]  Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, myself.
[01:51:54.861 --> 01:51:58.342]  I mean, all these, not me, but all these really great people.
[01:51:58.342 --> 01:52:01.423]  So we trained, I mean, every morning, hours.
[01:52:01.423 --> 01:52:02.243]  And we were in great shape.
[01:52:02.243 --> 01:52:06.143]  And I'll never forget, one day my dad goes, hey, let's all kind of spar around together.
[01:52:06.143 --> 01:52:07.684]  And I'm like, well, okay, great.
[01:52:07.684 --> 01:52:11.404]  So, you know, I'd spar with Van Damme.
[01:52:11.404 --> 01:52:12.364]  We'd spar around then.
[01:52:12.364 --> 01:52:18.445]  My dad and I kind of come up, and we're sparring, and I go, oh, boy, he kind of kicked me hard right there.
[01:52:18.445 --> 01:52:19.886]  So I kind of throw one back at him.
[01:52:19.886 --> 01:52:20.526]  Van Damme?
[01:52:20.526 --> 01:52:21.126]  No, my dad.
[01:52:22.930 --> 01:52:23.990]  Kill Van Damme.
[01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.871]  Bye.
[01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:27.911]  And so I go, boy, that kick was awfully hard by my dad.
[01:52:27.911 --> 01:52:35.033]  And so I kind of threw on back and my dad goes, like, all of a sudden this, whoa, came on.
[01:52:35.033 --> 01:52:45.676]  And next thing I know, it was like, and I'm on my back and I'm looking up at my dad looking over at me and I just kind of look up and I go, Mom!
[01:52:47.199 --> 01:52:50.000]  And boy, did I learn a very valuable lesson.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.422]  I was talking to Joe Rogan, who in his own right was a champion Taekwondo guy in his way, host of UFC.
[01:52:55.422 --> 01:53:00.684]  And he was saying if Chuck Norris was 25-30 today, he'd be a top UFC contender.
[01:53:00.684 --> 01:53:02.624]  Because he was the smartest fighter.
[01:53:02.624 --> 01:53:03.945]  He wasn't the strongest.
[01:53:03.945 --> 01:53:05.505]  He wasn't the fastest.
[01:53:05.505 --> 01:53:06.726]  He was the smartest.
[01:53:07.668 --> 01:53:17.398]  And that is something I admire so much about my dad is he will set one goal and he will fight and go after that one goal.
[01:53:17.398 --> 01:53:21.262]  If it's picking up this coffee cup, man, he will make that happen.
[01:53:21.262 --> 01:53:30.812]  But my father's lived that as a creed his whole life, setting goals for yourself and achieving small goals at a time for the ultimate plan.
[01:53:31.652 --> 01:53:45.001]  Um, so these are awesome things that I've been able to take away from my father and implement into my own life, as well as a lot of things Gary has brought into my wife Valerie and I's world with our kids.
[01:53:45.001 --> 01:53:47.663]  Just having somebody... You guys are good buddies.
[01:53:47.663 --> 01:53:48.384]  You know what?
[01:53:48.384 --> 01:53:49.404]  He's the best.
[01:53:49.404 --> 01:53:51.105]  I mean, you guys have no idea.
[01:53:51.105 --> 01:53:54.588]  If you really got to spend some time with him... Oh, he's definitely magnetic.
[01:53:54.588 --> 01:53:55.308]  He is.
[01:53:55.308 --> 01:53:57.250]  He was saying he was going to mentor me on some business stuff.
[01:53:57.250 --> 01:53:58.650]  I really appreciate it.
[01:53:58.650 --> 01:53:59.111]  Oh, gosh.
[01:54:00.109 --> 01:54:03.691]  Anyways, we're about to finish up this hour, do five minutes of overdrive and we're going to get some lunch.
[01:54:03.691 --> 01:54:05.532]  You guys have been awesome.
[01:54:05.532 --> 01:54:11.575]  But specifically, I mean he writes about it in the World Net daily.
[01:54:11.575 --> 01:54:13.676]  And I guess we could try to get your dad back on.
[01:54:13.676 --> 01:54:14.797]  I know he's just been super busy.
[01:54:14.797 --> 01:54:15.818]  I don't like to bug him a lot.
[01:54:15.818 --> 01:54:17.018]  It's called the ranch.
[01:54:17.018 --> 01:54:17.959]  Absolutely.
[01:54:17.959 --> 01:54:21.561]  But I guess he likes Huckabee.
[01:54:21.561 --> 01:54:25.343]  And I saw Huckabee come out and criticize the TSA the other day.
[01:54:25.343 --> 01:54:27.984]  He said, why are we groping grandmas when we've got ISIS terrorists attacking?
[01:54:30.205 --> 01:54:32.986]  I wish Chuck Norris would run for president.
[01:54:32.986 --> 01:54:40.870]  Yeah, you know what, I think what he's doing is going to help us much more than if Chuck Norris were president.
[01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:41.670]  No, I hear you.
[01:54:41.670 --> 01:54:42.610]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:54:42.610 --> 01:54:50.394]  Did you ever see your dad outside of a match have to defend himself or somebody else and take somebody out?
[01:54:51.275 --> 01:54:58.081]  I saw him come very close one time, and one thing my dad is a master of is self-control.
[01:54:58.081 --> 01:55:01.725]  And you say he was good like Obi-Wan Kenobi at defusing things?
[01:55:01.725 --> 01:55:02.366]  Absolutely.
[01:55:02.366 --> 01:55:11.615]  His greatest trait is he could look at somebody and know, am I going to have to beat this guy's butt, or can I talk him down?
[01:55:11.615 --> 01:55:12.576]  Did that come from being a cop?
[01:55:15.172 --> 01:55:17.596]  I think it's part of his soul.
[01:55:17.596 --> 01:55:23.585]  My dad has a very kind soul and he always wants to help somebody.
[01:55:23.585 --> 01:55:29.533]  And I just think that comes from his DNA of wanting to help people.
[01:55:29.533 --> 01:55:30.374]  And he's been great.
[01:55:30.374 --> 01:55:31.115]  He's been great at it.
[01:55:31.963 --> 01:55:34.804]  When you think about your dad, Steve McQueen.
[01:55:34.804 --> 01:55:36.966]  Give me a Steve McQueen, Chuck Norris story.
[01:55:36.966 --> 01:55:38.867]  I know Steve McQueen got him into Hollywood, right?
[01:55:38.867 --> 01:55:47.091]  Yeah, you know, gosh, really the ones I know best are the ones that I'm involved in, unfortunately.
[01:55:47.091 --> 01:55:51.113]  You know, going out to Indian Dunes in California and riding motorcycles.
[01:55:51.113 --> 01:55:54.074]  His son, Chad, was a great motorcycle rider.
[01:55:54.074 --> 01:55:56.435]  Went on to do films.
[01:55:56.435 --> 01:55:59.337]  Just lost Steve McQueen way too soon.
[01:55:59.337 --> 01:56:00.357]  You know, way too soon.
[01:56:00.357 --> 01:56:01.498]  He was a young man when he died.
[01:56:01.578 --> 01:56:02.558]  The good die young.
[01:56:02.558 --> 01:56:03.319]  How old was he?
[01:56:03.319 --> 01:56:05.200]  I think in his fifties.
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:07.581]  Steve McQueen was in his fifties when he died.
[01:56:07.581 --> 01:56:08.982]  I think, right?
[01:56:08.982 --> 01:56:09.742]  Yeah.
[01:56:09.742 --> 01:56:12.043]  Some long, long time ago.
[01:56:12.043 --> 01:56:13.184]  But it was a whole slew.
[01:56:13.184 --> 01:56:15.265]  Donnie and Marie.
[01:56:15.265 --> 01:56:17.446]  Elvis!
[01:56:17.446 --> 01:56:17.846]  Yeah.
[01:56:17.846 --> 01:56:19.327]  I saw Elvis!
[01:56:19.327 --> 01:56:19.907]  He's alive!
[01:56:21.007 --> 01:56:22.009]  Well, he was in 72.
[01:56:22.009 --> 01:56:25.034]  Tell me your Elvis story.
[01:56:25.034 --> 01:56:29.582]  You know, um... No, because I'm only into Hollywood and high, but these are Americana.
[01:56:29.582 --> 01:56:31.526]  Okay, uh, Elvis, um...
[01:56:32.737 --> 01:56:40.400]  Okay, you know, we all know about Elvis's wife leaving Elvis for a karate guy.
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:41.981]  Yeah.
[01:56:41.981 --> 01:56:45.563]  And these are all people in our immediate world.
[01:56:45.563 --> 01:56:47.183]  As a kid, Mike Stone.
[01:56:47.183 --> 01:56:49.604]  I mean, these are all like this.
[01:56:49.604 --> 01:56:55.687]  I mean, that's like Priscilla leaving Gary to come to me.
[01:56:55.687 --> 01:56:56.867]  There's not much chance of that.
[01:56:59.154 --> 01:57:06.959]  Um, but it was just fun and you know, it's fun to reflect back and go, wow, you know, none of us knew this was going to happen.
[01:57:06.959 --> 01:57:15.205]  You know, my dad's just teaching how to punch and kick and look what, what has happened now and how blessed I am to be able to carry on that life.
[01:57:15.205 --> 01:57:17.206]  So tell Elvis, you saw Elvis showed up.
[01:57:17.206 --> 01:57:17.987]  Yeah.
[01:57:17.987 --> 01:57:19.188]  Tell me this story.
[01:57:19.188 --> 01:57:19.628]  You know what?
[01:57:19.628 --> 01:57:21.129]  He came to a karate class.
[01:57:21.129 --> 01:57:23.050]  He had about 30 guys with him.
[01:57:23.050 --> 01:57:28.534]  It was up in, uh, uh, the Hollywood, uh, one of my dad's karate schools up near Hollywood.
[01:57:29.214 --> 01:57:30.515]  Oh my goodness.
[01:57:30.515 --> 01:57:31.596]  The bizarreness of America then.
[01:57:31.596 --> 01:57:34.678]  But it was a real bizarreness.
[01:57:34.678 --> 01:57:35.278]  It was organic.
[01:57:35.278 --> 01:57:35.979]  Now it's all fake.
[01:57:47.746 --> 01:57:50.948]  I, you know, I'm trying to catch up with social media.
[01:57:50.948 --> 01:57:51.529]  I try.
[01:57:51.529 --> 01:57:56.092]  I've got, I think, four tweeter people following.
[01:57:56.092 --> 01:57:58.633]  What is your tweeter?
[01:57:58.633 --> 01:57:59.934]  To quote Governor Perry.
[01:57:59.934 --> 01:58:00.955]  What is my tweeter?
[01:58:00.955 --> 01:58:02.176]  I have no idea.
[01:58:02.176 --> 01:58:03.556]  I have no idea what my tweeter is.
[01:58:03.556 --> 01:58:04.977]  He calls it tweeter handle.
[01:58:04.977 --> 01:58:06.038]  Yeah, it's twitter handle.
[01:58:06.038 --> 01:58:08.500]  He calls it tweeter handle.
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:09.320]  My kids do it.
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:11.862]  Hey, we're not going to, but your dad I hear does not have a temper either.
[01:58:13.038 --> 01:58:13.958]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:58:13.958 --> 01:58:15.739]  Yeah, okay.
[01:58:15.739 --> 01:58:20.760]  I've had a number of flying objects come at me on a movie set from my dad.
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:23.181]  I, unfortunately, one time yelled, cut too soon.
[01:58:23.181 --> 01:58:26.702]  So he's Jen on one side, but the other's Hannah the Dragon?
[01:58:26.702 --> 01:58:29.103]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:58:29.103 --> 01:58:31.284]  And it's, you know what, I'm his son.
[01:58:31.284 --> 01:58:33.264]  So, he could throw a walkie-talkie.
[01:58:33.264 --> 01:58:35.625]  I have a jumper, I threw one of these microphones yesterday.
[01:58:35.625 --> 01:58:36.545]  Hold on, we'll be right back.
[01:58:36.545 --> 01:58:40.046]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:17.445 --> 01:59:27.968]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:59:28.248 --> 01:59:32.070]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:59:32.070 --> 01:59:40.395]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[01:59:42.696 --> 01:59:43.416]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:43.416 --> 01:59:45.017]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:04.437 --> 02:00:05.757]  Big Brother.
[02:00:05.757 --> 02:00:07.518]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.518 --> 02:00:09.279]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.279 --> 02:00:10.859]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.859 --> 02:00:12.199]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.199 --> 02:00:16.601]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.601 --> 02:00:28.484]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.484 --> 02:00:31.845]  The enemy is showing itself more and more.
[02:00:31.845 --> 02:00:33.426]  Globalism is out in the open.
[02:00:35.969 --> 02:00:51.321]  It is legendary, it is epic, it is biblical that Texas is resisting the way it is.
[02:00:51.321 --> 02:01:01.610]  My uncle that died last year, this is total sweetheart, Vietnam helicopter veteran pilot with special operations.
[02:01:03.086 --> 02:01:04.487]  Taught me so much of what I know.
[02:01:04.487 --> 02:01:11.709]  My dad taught me probably more, but my uncle was a close second.
[02:01:11.709 --> 02:01:17.831]  He listened to Pastor David J. Smith, which I think is still around, if we have time to listen to him, up in Waxahachie.
[02:01:17.831 --> 02:01:25.094]  And Smith wasn't the type that was constantly saying he had visions about this and visions about that, but he was kind of a mainline preacher.
[02:01:25.094 --> 02:01:30.956]  I think it was up in Oklahoma, like 30-something years ago, and he had a vision that a world government was going to take over.
[02:01:32.342 --> 02:01:37.203]  And that Texas would be a stronghold against it.
[02:01:37.203 --> 02:01:43.265]  And my uncle said that with his discernment and prayer that he knew that was true.
[02:01:43.265 --> 02:01:50.086]  And that this is when I was already on the air.
[02:01:50.086 --> 02:01:54.867]  And that basically I should tell people that and try to help folks make preparation for it.
[02:01:54.867 --> 02:01:55.728]  Of course I never did.
[02:01:55.728 --> 02:01:58.188]  I've never spoken of this until now.
[02:01:58.188 --> 02:02:00.849]  And then now I just see Texas across the board resisting.
[02:02:05.472 --> 02:02:15.692]  And the first place to start with the giant, the sleeping giant is starting to wake up as world government and smart dust and TV's watching everybody.
[02:02:15.692 --> 02:02:16.754]  I mean, my God!
[02:02:18.052 --> 02:02:20.394]  Global abortion.
[02:02:20.394 --> 02:02:29.222]  Like I said, none of us are safe when the veterans can be put on don't treat list and they just spin the whole thing like, oh, the VA screwed up.
[02:02:29.222 --> 02:02:31.023]  That'd be like saying Jeffrey Dahmer screwed up.
[02:02:31.023 --> 02:02:32.064]  No, he didn't screw up, man.
[02:02:32.064 --> 02:02:33.405]  It was premeditated.
[02:02:33.405 --> 02:02:35.087]  John Wayne Gacy was premeditated.
[02:02:35.087 --> 02:02:36.408]  Ted Bundy was premeditated.
[02:02:36.408 --> 02:02:39.070]  I'm tired of it!
[02:02:39.070 --> 02:02:43.514]  And I'll be honest with you, I don't like messing with these dangerous people.
[02:02:45.293 --> 02:02:49.396]  If you're going to mess with them, because they're not going to quit messing with us, you better go all the way.
[02:02:49.396 --> 02:02:59.642]  And that's just all I can tell you is, man, I wish every day I'd been wrong about all this stuff.
[02:02:59.642 --> 02:03:05.086]  I mean, I wish every day that I was wrong.
[02:03:05.086 --> 02:03:05.726]  And you know what?
[02:03:05.726 --> 02:03:06.807]  I wasn't wrong about any of it.
[02:03:06.807 --> 02:03:08.268]  I'll tell you why I wasn't wrong about any of it.
[02:03:10.683 --> 02:03:17.051]  I just began studying this and getting on the trail of it after all these great people.
[02:03:17.051 --> 02:03:30.647]  John Birchers, FBI agents, cops, people like my uncle, scholars like my dad, countless other people when I was a kid talked about all this and my heavenly father
[02:03:32.719 --> 02:03:46.663]  I cannot believe how right they were and how they were fighting so hard back then when nobody knew the Federal Reserve was private and nobody knew what was going on to warn people so we'd have a defense down the road when all of this came down.
[02:03:49.946 --> 02:03:54.932]  Because once the shields fall and real tyranny comes in, they're coming after everybody, folks.
[02:03:54.932 --> 02:03:56.894]  And I don't mean people that just fought evil.
[02:03:56.894 --> 02:04:02.141]  They hate anyone who is upright and beautiful and strong and who has built something.
[02:04:02.141 --> 02:04:05.585]  These people have a will to dominate.
[02:04:05.585 --> 02:04:09.029]  The next guy we got coming up gets persecuted for planting city gardens.
[02:04:11.889 --> 02:04:15.272]  They just hate normal human life.
[02:04:15.272 --> 02:04:17.573]  Men and women loving each other.
[02:04:17.573 --> 02:04:18.654]  Families.
[02:04:18.654 --> 02:04:19.535]  Gardening.
[02:04:19.535 --> 02:04:20.756]  Farmers.
[02:04:20.756 --> 02:04:21.756]  Ranching.
[02:04:21.756 --> 02:04:22.337]  Metallurgy.
[02:04:23.578 --> 02:04:25.940]  Physical fitness.
[02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:27.962]  Wholesomeness.
[02:04:27.962 --> 02:04:32.186]  And it doesn't mean those of us that want wholesomeness are on some high horse or are perfect.
[02:04:32.186 --> 02:04:37.271]  It just means we want to gravitate towards that.
[02:04:37.271 --> 02:04:39.653]  There's not room for both groups of evil and good.
[02:04:39.653 --> 02:04:40.674]  Do you understand that?
[02:04:40.674 --> 02:04:42.496]  The evil wants to extinct good.
[02:04:44.384 --> 02:05:00.911]  And to see the amazing awakening happening is buoying and invigorating but also horrifying because man, the enemy is freaked out right now and they're gonna attack like... Osama Bin Laden was a 9-11 truther?
[02:05:00.911 --> 02:05:08.094]  Cy Hirst just released an explosive story debunking the US government's version of events in the 2011 Bin Laden raid.
[02:05:08.094 --> 02:05:13.236]  Apparently in response, the White House released a trove of documents they supposedly recovered.
[02:05:13.436 --> 02:05:16.057]  So just what was on Bin Laden's bookshelf?
[02:05:16.057 --> 02:05:21.959]  Well, around half of the books recovered were about conspiracies, 9-11, and the Illuminati.
[02:05:21.959 --> 02:05:31.822]  Imagine Bin Laden, curled up on his couch, fascinated with the myriad of 9-11 conspiracy theories, knowing that he himself had masterminded the attack.
[02:05:31.822 --> 02:05:40.605]  The other possibility is that the entire list has been completely fabricated in an effort to smear conspiracy theorists as terrorist sympathizers.
[02:05:40.965 --> 02:05:46.933]  Fun fact, you can actually find some of the books on Bin Laden's bookshelf right here at the InfoWars store.
[02:05:46.933 --> 02:05:48.355]  Terrorists!
[02:05:48.355 --> 02:05:56.285]  Find out just what was on Bin Laden's bookshelf by reading the article, Osama Bin Laden was a 9-11 truther, at InfoWars.com
[02:05:57.936 --> 02:06:05.139]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[02:07:00.764 --> 02:07:10.488]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:07:10.488 --> 02:07:13.189]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:16.750]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:07:16.750 --> 02:07:23.073]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[02:07:23.073 --> 02:07:25.594]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[02:07:25.794 --> 02:07:28.216]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:07:28.216 --> 02:07:34.603]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:07:34.603 --> 02:07:42.050]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:07:42.330 --> 02:07:49.874]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:07:56.597 --> 02:08:06.742]  Excuse me?
[02:08:10.106 --> 02:08:20.551]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[02:08:20.551 --> 02:08:22.371]  I hereby declare this to be...
[02:08:29.699 --> 02:08:31.901]  It's a military mission in North St.
[02:08:31.901 --> 02:08:32.541]  Louis.
[02:08:32.541 --> 02:08:39.766]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[02:08:39.766 --> 02:08:44.570]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[02:08:44.570 --> 02:08:45.610]  Guns will be taken.
[02:08:45.610 --> 02:08:46.951]  No one will ever be armed.
[02:08:46.951 --> 02:08:47.752]  We will take all weapons.
[02:08:48.132 --> 02:08:50.514]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[02:08:50.514 --> 02:08:55.057]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:08:55.057 --> 02:08:55.917]  Enough.
[02:08:55.917 --> 02:08:56.718]  Enough.
[02:08:56.718 --> 02:08:57.779]  Enough.
[02:08:57.779 --> 02:08:58.179]  Enough.
[02:08:58.179 --> 02:09:02.742]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[02:09:02.742 --> 02:09:06.685]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[02:09:07.065 --> 02:09:13.948]  And as KSLA News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered, the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[02:09:13.948 --> 02:09:14.268]  Us.
[02:09:14.268 --> 02:09:22.312]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:09:22.312 --> 02:09:25.893]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[02:09:25.893 --> 02:09:27.494]  Somebody else made that happen.
[02:09:28.326 --> 02:09:34.609]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:09:34.609 --> 02:09:39.572]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[02:09:39.572 --> 02:09:52.018]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[02:09:52.018 --> 02:09:57.001]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[02:09:58.667 --> 02:09:59.648]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[02:09:59.648 --> 02:10:01.030]  You're back inside right now?
[02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:02.031]  I am inside.
[02:10:02.031 --> 02:10:03.933]  I have two words for you.
[02:10:03.933 --> 02:10:05.755]  Predator Globes.
[02:10:05.755 --> 02:10:06.776]  You will never see it coming.
[02:10:10.805 --> 02:10:13.648]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[02:10:13.648 --> 02:10:22.916]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[02:10:22.916 --> 02:10:28.380]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:33.445]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[02:10:33.445 --> 02:10:35.507]  If you want them, come and take them!
[02:10:37.222 --> 02:10:39.006]  We are on the march.
[02:10:39.006 --> 02:10:41.771]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:10:41.771 --> 02:10:46.520]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:11:01.158 --> 02:11:06.171]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[02:11:06.171 --> 02:11:07.595]  This is the heart of 1776!
[02:11:12.882 --> 02:11:18.626]  Alright, coming up to about 40 after, and then I'm going to get into the over-the-top ISIS news.
[02:11:18.626 --> 02:11:22.669]  Claims it has 71 trained soldiers in 15 different states.
[02:11:22.669 --> 02:11:26.112]  Hillary Clinton vows to expand Obama amnesty to more illegals.
[02:11:26.112 --> 02:11:28.874]  Civil forfeiture, you can't make this stuff up.
[02:11:28.874 --> 02:11:30.475]  The latest on the Clinton Foundation.
[02:11:30.475 --> 02:11:33.558]  The latest on what's happening with the global economy.
[02:11:34.873 --> 02:11:38.374]  More Jade Helm I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:11:38.374 --> 02:11:43.695]  Benjamin Franklin said, distrust and caution are the parents of security.
[02:11:43.695 --> 02:11:46.816]  He also said security without liberty is called prison.
[02:11:46.816 --> 02:11:51.317]  Both apply to what I want to show you today in my Culture Warrior column.
[02:11:51.317 --> 02:11:54.398]  That's Chuck Norris.
[02:11:54.398 --> 02:11:57.899]  And to be a little blasphemous, but not intentionally, I mean, it's a joke.
[02:11:57.899 --> 02:12:00.320]  Chuck Norris be with us and for us, who be against us.
[02:12:02.822 --> 02:12:05.804]  Alright, that's a little too far on the Chuck Norris jokes.
[02:12:05.804 --> 02:12:18.792]  But, I first heard about all this from the whole Norris Combine about Jade Helm and stuff several months ago, and I talked about it.
[02:12:18.792 --> 02:12:24.375]  I said, huge military news with the governor, with stuff that's going on with the feds, the state knows what's going on.
[02:12:24.375 --> 02:12:25.776]  Well, of course the state knows.
[02:12:25.776 --> 02:12:31.219]  I mean, we've had half our power plants seized outside of law and just shut off.
[02:12:32.674 --> 02:12:37.437]  And that all ties into the war on lemonade stands that Forbes asked a few years ago.
[02:12:37.437 --> 02:12:38.678]  Why is there a war on lemonade stands?
[02:12:38.678 --> 02:12:40.058]  Why is there a war on Amish?
[02:12:40.058 --> 02:12:42.840]  Why is there a war on backyard gardens?
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:45.402]  And they said in Tulsa, we want inspections.
[02:12:45.402 --> 02:12:47.303]  You might be growing pie.
[02:12:47.303 --> 02:12:49.864]  Because there's nothing worse than a backyard garden, folks.
[02:12:49.864 --> 02:12:54.367]  Or zone people harassing folks for tomatoes growing in their windows or whatever.
[02:12:56.033 --> 02:12:58.517]  Yeah, there's the headline, the inexplicable war on lemonade stands.
[02:12:58.517 --> 02:13:04.826]  No, it's big mega box stores that want to end normal human activity and have giant food deserts everywhere.
[02:13:04.826 --> 02:13:09.393]  Let me tell you, one of the most enjoyable things, I don't have time to do it anymore, my kids do it.
[02:13:10.990 --> 02:13:13.613]  It's so much fun to go out and till the soil.
[02:13:13.613 --> 02:13:17.618]  We got nine acres out in the country outside Austin, just a little plot on the end.
[02:13:17.618 --> 02:13:19.541]  Fruit trees on it and stuff.
[02:13:19.541 --> 02:13:25.628]  It's so much fun to pick the plums and pick the apples and pick the, you know, different things that are out there.
[02:13:25.628 --> 02:13:26.870]  It's so much fun to pick the...
[02:13:29.446 --> 02:13:35.370]  Spinach and pick the squash and to even grow our own pumpkins and things like that.
[02:13:35.370 --> 02:13:36.751]  And it's just so simple.
[02:13:36.751 --> 02:13:39.133]  You plant it, you take care of it, it grows.
[02:13:39.133 --> 02:13:40.333]  My favorite is hot peppers.
[02:13:40.333 --> 02:13:46.017]  I mean, you're talking about for a couple dollars you could have a whole field of pepper plants growing.
[02:13:46.017 --> 02:13:47.859]  You could take them to a farmer's market and sell them.
[02:13:48.695 --> 02:13:50.876]  But there's a war against that.
[02:13:50.876 --> 02:13:59.880]  And I remember reading about Johnny Appleseed three years ago, and I remember reading about him in school, but I re-read about Johnny Appleseed in seven states.
[02:14:01.064 --> 02:14:08.226]  It's estimated planting over a million apple trees and other fruit trees and teaching people how to take care of themselves.
[02:14:08.226 --> 02:14:13.567]  Well, Germany forever plants stuff in the highway right-of-ways.
[02:14:13.567 --> 02:14:20.209]  And local community groups just go and they just pick an area and they just plant fruit trees and stuff and they go and pick them and they eat them and they can them and they sell them or whatever.
[02:14:21.209 --> 02:14:23.450]  Well, here though, that's the new crime.
[02:14:23.450 --> 02:14:24.890]  And I didn't even know this guy was doing this.
[02:14:24.890 --> 02:14:30.352]  I separately, you can watch the video at the Infowars Seed Center and InfowarsStore.com.
[02:14:30.352 --> 02:14:36.255]  We have eight different companies, the best low-cost, high-quality, non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[02:14:36.255 --> 02:14:42.017]  Because Monsanto's in a war to buy up all the seeds with two other GMO companies and just basically ban their sale.
[02:14:42.017 --> 02:14:47.039]  But these are groups still doing it, everything you need to survive.
[02:14:47.039 --> 02:14:50.020]  And I've explained that even in urban areas,
[02:14:50.970 --> 02:14:52.572]  We've gone out and shown this on video.
[02:14:52.572 --> 02:15:04.390]  You can go to the middle of a, you know, the highway in the middle of the woods with some little 200 square foot open area of the sun, dig it up, plant tomatoes and get more tomatoes than you can ever even harvest.
[02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:05.312]  This is nature's bounty.
[02:15:06.929 --> 02:15:11.834]  Ron Finley has had arrest warrants issued for him out in L.A.
[02:15:11.834 --> 02:15:12.855]  trying to get this going.
[02:15:12.855 --> 02:15:20.644]  And the studies show you get young people growing things, or you get young people even with a fish tank or a dog to take care of, but especially plants.
[02:15:21.914 --> 02:15:32.782]  We release hormones, it's been shown, that calm us when we're out in the garden with the bees and the sunflowers and the watermelons and just everything.
[02:15:32.782 --> 02:15:35.684]  It's so much fun to do this.
[02:15:35.684 --> 02:15:38.466]  It's a normal human agrarian activity.
[02:15:38.466 --> 02:15:40.847]  And there's the Ron Finley Project.
[02:15:40.847 --> 02:15:45.671]  Here I was saying, copy Johnny Appleseed, and then Nico a few months ago said, have you heard about this guy in the LA Times and places?
[02:15:46.451 --> 02:16:05.286]  Who they've tried to arrest and fine and fee because he dares to go into these, you know, government lots with weeds everywhere and plant stuff and then other people get involved and they start planting and then they start demanding, hey, we want part of this city park that nobody uses for a city garden.
[02:16:05.286 --> 02:16:07.268]  And next they're going to want chickens in their backyards.
[02:16:07.268 --> 02:16:09.750]  Next they're going to want to be independent humans.
[02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:12.052]  See, the globalists don't want us to be self-sufficient.
[02:16:12.052 --> 02:16:12.933]  This is the essence
[02:16:14.184 --> 02:16:15.927]  of the plantation.
[02:16:15.927 --> 02:16:19.574]  The essence of the reservation is you can't be self-sufficient.
[02:16:19.574 --> 02:16:21.277]  And that's the plan.
[02:16:21.277 --> 02:16:21.998]  RonFinley.com
[02:16:24.841 --> 02:16:29.522]  Very, very, crowdrise.com, Ron Finley HQ.
[02:16:29.522 --> 02:16:30.902]  Very exciting what Ron's doing.
[02:16:30.902 --> 02:16:36.044]  I mean, this guy is just over the top with the success he's had, but also the persecution.
[02:16:36.044 --> 02:16:39.304]  To show you, we're not in Kansas anymore, folks.
[02:16:39.304 --> 02:16:44.326]  When they said they had victory gardens in World War II, now they come after you.
[02:16:44.326 --> 02:16:50.107]  Ron, thank you for sitting there during that long babbling introduction, but something like you're doing is so amazing, my friend.
[02:16:51.550 --> 02:16:52.251]  Thank you.
[02:16:52.251 --> 02:16:54.733]  Thank you so much for having me here, Alex.
[02:16:54.733 --> 02:16:55.613]  I appreciate it.
[02:16:55.613 --> 02:16:58.716]  And what you're what you're saying is so correct, man.
[02:16:58.716 --> 02:17:00.597]  This is so on point.
[02:17:00.597 --> 02:17:09.825]  And so, I mean, it's basically, you know, it's like slavery, man, for all of us, you know, because, you know, they control the food, they control you.
[02:17:09.825 --> 02:17:13.147]  And we're trying to redesign that system.
[02:17:14.308 --> 02:17:15.369]  It's a total revolution.
[02:17:15.369 --> 02:17:19.952]  If everybody started planting gardens in their areas and learn what you could do with rooftops.
[02:17:19.952 --> 02:17:20.973]  Well, you're the expert.
[02:17:20.973 --> 02:17:22.234]  Tell us about this revolution.
[02:17:22.234 --> 02:17:24.316]  What got you started?
[02:17:24.316 --> 02:17:26.037]  See, everybody says that.
[02:17:26.037 --> 02:17:28.399]  I said, I'm not an expert.
[02:17:28.399 --> 02:17:29.640]  I'm a fashion designer.
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:31.161]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:17:31.161 --> 02:17:37.866]  I'm just some guy that decided to put a carrot, you know, in the ground and all hell broke loose.
[02:17:37.866 --> 02:17:39.547]  But you are an expert by taking action.
[02:17:41.107 --> 02:17:43.795]  I mean, that's what makes you an expert is that you've actually done it.
[02:17:43.795 --> 02:17:44.256]  I mean, come on.
[02:17:47.096 --> 02:17:49.338]  But I mean, we're all experts.
[02:17:49.338 --> 02:17:50.378]  Alex, we're all experts.
[02:17:50.378 --> 02:17:51.959]  This is in all of us.
[02:17:51.959 --> 02:17:53.540]  This is in all of us, man.
[02:17:53.540 --> 02:17:54.701]  It is that.
[02:17:54.701 --> 02:17:56.262]  It's just doing something.
[02:17:56.262 --> 02:18:03.707]  And like you said about your children, man, if you put them out there, they're learning a life skill.
[02:18:03.707 --> 02:18:05.809]  This is not frivolous.
[02:18:05.809 --> 02:18:09.831]  This is something that they can take with them and we'll take with them the rest of their life.
[02:18:09.831 --> 02:18:11.893]  But we have these areas that
[02:18:12.193 --> 02:18:13.754]  I call them food prisons.
[02:18:13.754 --> 02:18:15.494]  They call them food deserts.
[02:18:15.494 --> 02:18:18.215]  These kids have no skin in the game.
[02:18:18.215 --> 02:18:22.076]  Their whole life has been predestined for them.
[02:18:22.076 --> 02:18:25.718]  They don't have any kind of... They don't even dream, man.
[02:18:25.718 --> 02:18:29.219]  It's sad talking to some of these kids, and they don't know.
[02:18:29.219 --> 02:18:32.700]  They already are born with barcodes on the back of their necks.
[02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:33.700]  I want to talk about you.
[02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:35.961]  We're going to break in a moment, but I want to come back and give you the floor.
[02:18:35.961 --> 02:18:38.302]  Talk about your awakening, how this started.
[02:18:39.162 --> 02:18:46.385]  And then how you got attacked, and from what I've seen, that backfired and made it even bigger.
[02:18:46.385 --> 02:18:47.266]  Okay.
[02:18:47.266 --> 02:18:49.527]  We're going to break in about a minute, but I mean how did this get started?
[02:18:51.292 --> 02:19:02.767]  Uh, well, basically, I remember going to the store and there was, um, I, you know, I picked up a tomato and it says, maybe, uh, coated with shellac.
[02:19:02.767 --> 02:19:05.370]  And I was like, wow, shellac on my tomato?
[02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:09.896]  Isn't that what we put on wood and wood shop when I was in grade school?
[02:19:10.496 --> 02:19:17.461]  And you just start looking, and you just open your eyes one day, and you're like, wow.
[02:19:17.461 --> 02:19:24.166]  And you go to other cities, you go to other places, and you realize that all this is by design.
[02:19:24.166 --> 02:19:26.808]  This bad food.
[02:19:26.808 --> 02:19:38.416]  You talk the medical-industrial complex, the prison-industrial complex, the military-industrial complex, and you realize, like, wow, these kids are on a track to go absolutely nowhere.
[02:19:38.416 --> 02:19:39.877]  But, you know, two combined.
[02:19:40.097 --> 02:19:45.539]  So it's all started with a tomato with shellac that'll give you kidney failure in your face.
[02:19:45.539 --> 02:19:46.960]  Ron Finley, ronfinley.com.
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:49.021]  We're going to come back and talk about your story.
[02:19:49.021 --> 02:19:50.061]  It's simply incredible.
[02:19:50.061 --> 02:19:54.163]  Then we're going to get into how folks can get involved and stop these food prisons.
[02:19:54.163 --> 02:19:57.985]  This is true revolution, peaceful revolution, the magic of...
[02:19:58.505 --> 02:20:01.227]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:20:01.227 --> 02:20:05.530]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:20:05.530 --> 02:20:06.931]  Silverlungs.com.
[02:20:06.931 --> 02:20:09.593]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[02:20:09.593 --> 02:20:12.595]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[02:20:12.595 --> 02:20:14.957]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[02:20:14.957 --> 02:20:16.858]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[02:20:16.858 --> 02:20:22.422]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[02:20:22.422 --> 02:20:26.225]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[02:20:26.225 --> 02:20:27.726]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[02:20:28.214 --> 02:20:33.195]  Are you tired of being cyber-raped by big government and big business?
[02:20:33.195 --> 02:20:39.537]  Are you tired of being forced to cough up information, private, personal information, against your will?
[02:20:39.537 --> 02:20:42.478]  Well, I found the answer to their invasive behaviors.
[02:20:42.478 --> 02:20:43.718]  It's called D-vasive.
[02:20:43.718 --> 02:20:46.139]  D- or D-vasive.
[02:20:46.139 --> 02:20:48.440]  It's made for PCs and Androids.
[02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:50.360]  Go get it now at the Google Play Store.
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:51.880]  D-vasive.
[02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:52.681]  D-vasive.
[02:20:52.681 --> 02:20:53.541]  D-vasive.
[02:20:53.541 --> 02:20:54.221]  It's an app.
[02:20:54.221 --> 02:20:57.402]  Get it now and turn Big Brother off.
[02:20:58.330 --> 02:20:59.231]  I love my candy!
[02:20:59.231 --> 02:20:59.951]  I want my baby again!
[02:20:59.951 --> 02:21:01.252]  Mine, mine, mine!
[02:21:28.090 --> 02:21:28.190]  Yes.
[02:21:28.190 --> 02:21:34.574]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:21:34.574 --> 02:21:42.258]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:21:42.258 --> 02:21:49.682]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[02:21:49.682 --> 02:21:53.304]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:21:53.304 --> 02:21:56.165]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:21:57.526 --> 02:21:59.568]  What's your health worth to you?
[02:21:59.568 --> 02:22:05.051]  You probably can't place an exact value on it, but its importance has certainly increased greatly as you've grown older.
[02:22:05.051 --> 02:22:09.635]  Yet some companies seem to believe you can be lured in with cheap prices and false promises.
[02:22:09.635 --> 02:22:12.957]  That's never been the way Supernatural Silver has chosen to do business.
[02:22:13.257 --> 02:22:18.519]  Long ago, we set out to create a product that was light years beyond colloidal and ionic silver.
[02:22:18.519 --> 02:22:25.120]  Through extensive research and testing, we succeeded in making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective.
[02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:30.002]  Some might call us a premium product, but we simply strive to be a product that worked.
[02:22:30.002 --> 02:22:37.684]  Supernatural silver is strong enough to fight off viruses, bacteria, and fungus, but safe enough to be used internally or topically.
[02:22:37.924 --> 02:22:45.029]  And it's powerful enough that just a handful of applications per week can give you better results than the daily use of those bargain silvers.
[02:22:45.029 --> 02:22:52.114]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com today and use the promo code SILVER2015 for 30% off your order.
[02:22:52.114 --> 02:22:56.597]  Give yourself and your loved ones a fighting chance with Supernatural Silver.
[02:22:57.037 --> 02:23:06.345]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:23:06.345 --> 02:23:07.145]  This capitalism?
[02:23:07.145 --> 02:23:13.290]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:23:13.290 --> 02:23:16.993]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:23:19.315 --> 02:23:19.655]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:26.841 --> 02:23:38.706]  Americans honor their war dead every year on Memorial Day, the last Monday in May of each year with a special remembrance and celebration with flowers on the graves of our fallen heroes.

[02:23:50.711 --> 02:23:51.011]  Go now.
[02:24:03.988 --> 02:24:20.804]  Don't know much about history Don't know much biology Don't know much about a science book Don't know much about the French I took But I do know that I love you
[02:24:27.239 --> 02:24:29.660]  I have good will towards people.
[02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:35.323]  And the system wants to eradicate that because free will gets in the way of the corporatist program.
[02:24:35.323 --> 02:24:47.029]  The reason I get so excited about city gardening, but also rural gardening, truck farms, you name it, is that everything the social engineers are doing, as our guest said, is about ending that.
[02:24:48.066 --> 02:25:00.115]  He's agreed to see us for the whole hour, so at about 40 after, I'm going to give the number out, we're going to take some calls about your stories of city gardening or articles you want to talk about where people get in trouble for gardening in their front yard or their backyard.
[02:25:00.115 --> 02:25:07.119]  This is a real attempt to intimidate people, but if we start doing this, it can circumvent the Monsanto tyranny, all of it.
[02:25:07.119 --> 02:25:10.962]  Remember, they just cut the fluoride in the water in half this week.
[02:25:10.962 --> 02:25:12.003]  We're having major victories.
[02:25:12.003 --> 02:25:14.365]  McDonald's is starting to take the GMO out.
[02:25:14.365 --> 02:25:16.846]  We're having victories with our actions.
[02:25:18.078 --> 02:25:23.523]  Plants, seeds are so magic that you can plant a little seed and a whole mustard tree grows.
[02:25:23.523 --> 02:25:25.684]  You can have mustard for 20 years from it.
[02:25:25.684 --> 02:25:31.429]  Or you can plant a seed and a pecan tree grows, or an apple tree, or strawberries.
[02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:33.691]  I mean, this is nanotech.
[02:25:33.691 --> 02:25:34.652]  God's nanotech.
[02:25:34.652 --> 02:25:39.276]  I'm going to shut up because this is a short segment, long segment coming up with Ron Finley, ronfinley.com.
[02:25:39.656 --> 02:25:41.259]  I know you don't like talking about yourself during the break.
[02:25:41.259 --> 02:25:42.701]  You're like, I don't want to brag about myself.
[02:25:42.701 --> 02:25:48.691]  Talk about your story, what you've done in L.A., the thousands you've inspired, but also the persecution you went through.
[02:25:48.691 --> 02:25:50.655]  So you see this tomato with shellac.
[02:25:50.655 --> 02:25:52.097]  That begins the wheels going.
[02:25:52.097 --> 02:25:52.998]  Tell people your story.
[02:25:54.141 --> 02:26:04.292]  Well, I mean, it was the tomato with shellac, Alex, but it was also, I mean, that was just like almost the tipping point or the, you know, the straw.
[02:26:04.292 --> 02:26:10.439]  And you just look around and all of a sudden you realize that all you see is asphalt and concrete.
[02:26:10.439 --> 02:26:14.523]  And my whole thing, like you was saying, I don't want my food loco.
[02:26:14.523 --> 02:26:16.165]  I want my food hyper loco.
[02:26:16.685 --> 02:26:22.629]  You know, why in this desert that we live in in California, why are we watering grass?
[02:26:22.629 --> 02:26:30.934]  When you can use the less water and water and grow food, which is what we need here.
[02:26:30.934 --> 02:26:32.735]  Why aren't yards full of all this beautiful food?
[02:26:33.976 --> 02:26:34.617]  Right, exactly.
[02:26:34.617 --> 02:26:47.830]  Well, I mean, what happened with my story, you know, after I got persecuted, you know, had to go to court the first time, I decided years later, I thought they forgot about it and I did it again.
[02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:54.557]  And so, basically got thrown under the bus again and... Tell folks what you did, though.
[02:26:54.557 --> 02:26:55.838]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:26:55.838 --> 02:26:57.080]  Were you planning what they did?
[02:26:57.947 --> 02:27:03.429]  The plant, we have these in front of the, they're called parkways.
[02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:10.913]  It's like right before you get to the street, that strip of land, you know, strip of grass, like in these, I'm standing in the street.
[02:27:10.913 --> 02:27:15.175]  So I decided to just remove my grass.
[02:27:15.175 --> 02:27:19.477]  I sheet mulched it with cardboard, a lot of it, and I planted food.
[02:27:19.477 --> 02:27:22.358]  But first, Alex, it started only for beautiful
[02:27:22.678 --> 02:27:28.643]  I mean, I wanted to be kissed by hummingbirds every day.
[02:27:28.643 --> 02:27:31.045]  I wanted to see butterflies.
[02:27:31.045 --> 02:27:35.068]  I wanted to smell lavender and jasmine and rosemary.
[02:27:35.068 --> 02:27:37.310]  So that's where it started.
[02:27:37.310 --> 02:27:40.172]  And so then I started, and then it came down again.
[02:27:40.172 --> 02:27:43.615]  Long story short, I took 150 feet by nine, 10 feet, and I made a food forest.
[02:27:50.500 --> 02:27:57.603]  That I wanted my neighbors basically to see, look, you can design your own life and you can start here.
[02:27:57.603 --> 02:27:59.704]  I use it as a canvas.
[02:27:59.704 --> 02:28:02.605]  I use the soil, Alex.
[02:28:02.605 --> 02:28:03.725]  This is my street art.
[02:28:03.725 --> 02:28:04.926]  This is my graffiti.
[02:28:04.926 --> 02:28:05.886]  And that's how I treat it.
[02:28:05.886 --> 02:28:07.467]  But also, it beautifies.
[02:28:08.007 --> 02:28:16.454]  It purifies, and it's all, you're cleaning the air, you're bringing in pollinators, you're bringing in all kinds of insects, and you're feeding people.
[02:28:16.454 --> 02:28:25.581]  But also, it's multi-layered, because people pass by, and like you were saying, they see these flowers, they see this, it's color therapy, Alex.
[02:28:25.581 --> 02:28:26.101]  You know?
[02:28:26.101 --> 02:28:27.683]  It ups the value of the neighborhood, too.
[02:28:28.573 --> 02:28:29.834]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:28:29.834 --> 02:28:33.216]  And in that, it changes people's perspective.
[02:28:33.216 --> 02:28:34.536]  It changes their mind.
[02:28:34.536 --> 02:28:35.697]  People are smiling.
[02:28:35.697 --> 02:28:42.681]  I mean, and you're having conversations that you would never have had, you know, just because... Well, you're also a really good gardener.
[02:28:42.681 --> 02:28:45.042]  I've looked at photos in the news about you and your own site.
[02:28:45.042 --> 02:28:45.943]  You've got a green thumb.
[02:28:47.735 --> 02:28:51.978]  I got green hands, Alex.
[02:28:51.978 --> 02:28:53.540]  Not just my thumbs, you know.
[02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:59.445]  But I want people, I put it on the street because I want people to realize you can do this.
[02:28:59.445 --> 02:29:01.546]  You know, treat this like your canvas.
[02:29:01.546 --> 02:29:03.468]  And people like ask me, well, where do you start?
[02:29:03.468 --> 02:29:04.589]  I'm like, at the beginning.
[02:29:04.589 --> 02:29:05.510]  And they're like, where's that?
[02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:06.831]  I said, wherever you start.
[02:29:06.831 --> 02:29:11.515]  When you get a canvas, you decide where you're going to put that first brush stroke.
[02:29:11.515 --> 02:29:15.098]  It could start with a box plant with some peppers and tomatoes in your window.
[02:29:16.038 --> 02:29:20.643]  And that one tomato plant and pepper plant's gonna have so much food, you're gonna, I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:29:20.643 --> 02:29:23.346]  Every week, they're, look, we have no culture.
[02:29:23.346 --> 02:29:30.133]  They've taken our culture, the most human culture is agrarian, and you are a revolutionary taking back our culture.
[02:29:30.133 --> 02:29:31.574]  I'm gonna get your take on that.
[02:29:31.574 --> 02:29:35.859]  Ron Finley, a true revolutionary, ronfinley.com, an example to everybody.
[02:29:35.859 --> 02:29:38.542]  Straight ahead, on the other side, and we'll open the phones up, but...
[02:29:39.571 --> 02:29:45.941]  I mean, they had arrest warrants out, they fined him, they came after him, but it blew up in their face and now they've had to capitulate.
[02:29:45.941 --> 02:29:47.463]  It's a victory story.
[02:29:47.463 --> 02:29:48.866]  We're on the march.
[02:29:48.866 --> 02:29:51.409]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.409 --> 02:29:54.094]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.206 --> 02:29:59.947]  Think you've got nothing to hide?
[02:29:59.947 --> 02:30:08.153]  Well, a group of activists is challenging that mentality by placing hidden tape recorders throughout New York to protest the NSA.
[02:30:08.153 --> 02:30:21.862]  The campaign called We Are Always Listening is currently collecting private conversations of unsuspecting citizens and then uploading those intimate conversations online in an attempt to discredit that nothing-to-hide narrative.
[02:30:22.182 --> 02:30:33.051]  The group's website says, citizens don't seem to mind this monitoring, so we're hiding recorders in public places in hopes of gathering information to help win the war on terror.
[02:30:33.051 --> 02:30:41.698]  The site encourages those who are angry about surveillance to contact Congress as section 215 of the Patriot Act reaches expiration on June 1st.
[02:30:42.398 --> 02:30:52.116]  You can listen to some of those audio recordings embedded in the article, activists place hidden tape recorders throughout New York to protest NSA at InfoWars.com.
[02:30:52.116 --> 02:30:54.981]  This is Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:30:58.089 --> 02:30:59.350]  Another major health threat.
[02:30:59.350 --> 02:31:04.332]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:31:04.332 --> 02:31:07.014]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:31:07.014 --> 02:31:14.057]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:31:14.057 --> 02:31:17.039]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:31:17.039 --> 02:31:20.000]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.021]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:31:22.021 --> 02:31:24.823]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:31:24.923 --> 02:31:30.665]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:31:30.665 --> 02:31:34.166]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:31:34.166 --> 02:31:37.247]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:31:37.247 --> 02:31:44.569]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[02:31:44.569 --> 02:31:47.790]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[02:31:54.192 --> 02:31:56.113]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:31:56.113 --> 02:32:06.956]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:32:06.956 --> 02:32:15.059]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:32:15.359 --> 02:32:20.225]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:32:20.225 --> 02:32:27.033]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:27.033 --> 02:32:34.121]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:32:34.181 --> 02:32:36.103]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:32:36.103 --> 02:32:41.227]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:32:41.227 --> 02:32:45.711]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:32:45.711 --> 02:32:49.094]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:32:49.094 --> 02:32:55.399]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:32:55.399 --> 02:32:57.341]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:33:09.346 --> 02:33:15.411]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[02:33:15.411 --> 02:33:20.415]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[02:33:20.415 --> 02:33:25.280]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!
[02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:27.281]  It's not about food.
[02:33:27.281 --> 02:33:29.824]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[02:33:36.528 --> 02:33:38.673]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:38.673 --> 02:33:41.619]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:43.442 --> 02:33:52.188]  That's right, both political parties in this country work for the very same corporate interests that are anti-human liberty and want to centralize things.
[02:33:52.188 --> 02:33:58.232]  Good news though, NSA phone data collection illegal appeals court rules, that's out of the New York Times.
[02:33:58.232 --> 02:34:01.694]  I'm going to cover that starting in the next hour in more detail.
[02:34:01.694 --> 02:34:09.179]  We're going to open the phones up here in about 10 minutes for your stories about gardening, any persecution you've gone through, any positive stories.
[02:34:09.179 --> 02:34:13.162]  But there is a war on just normal human activity, on human self-sufficiency.
[02:34:14.503 --> 02:34:19.186]  We had 90% of people somewhat self-sufficient and rural in the Great Depression.
[02:34:19.186 --> 02:34:21.167]  Now we're 90% urban.
[02:34:21.167 --> 02:34:23.349]  Only half the rural self-sufficient.
[02:34:23.349 --> 02:34:25.150]  We've gone from 90% to 5%.
[02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:28.092]  That's a crisis situation.
[02:34:28.092 --> 02:34:36.538]  That's why we help fund our own operations selling high-quality heirloom non-GMO seeds at InfoWareStore.com at the InfoWare Seed Center.
[02:34:36.538 --> 02:34:39.920]  And, I mean, we've got it across the board, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:42.002]  The Survival Seed Vaults, the Survival Arc,
[02:34:43.740 --> 02:34:53.407]  The top eight companies, the lowest prices, Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, and your purchase of the products helps fund our operation.
[02:34:53.407 --> 02:35:00.712]  Now is the time in the late spring, summer, fall, to start planting, to get good at it, to find out what grows well in your areas.
[02:35:00.712 --> 02:35:02.833]  It's a real adventure.
[02:35:02.833 --> 02:35:10.519]  But even if it's just planting sunflowers and then, you know, eating those, it brings in the hummingbirds, it brings in the bees, it just... Gardens are so entertaining.
[02:35:11.857 --> 02:35:15.800]  I mean, they're just a great place to hang out and, you know, have lunch or dinner.
[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:17.001]  They're just wonderful.
[02:35:17.001 --> 02:35:18.041]  And I've always been a gardener.
[02:35:18.041 --> 02:35:20.223]  I don't have time to do it because I'm too busy on the air all the time.
[02:35:20.223 --> 02:35:22.224]  I need to get back to that.
[02:35:22.224 --> 02:35:24.346]  But, again, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:35:24.346 --> 02:35:33.092]  We're also, for Mother's Day, speaking of what comes from plants, concentrated herbal extracts known to supercharge endurance, libido, energy.
[02:35:33.092 --> 02:35:35.954]  You've heard the right reviews for super male and super female vitality.
[02:35:37.290 --> 02:35:39.692]  Super Female has been sold out for almost three months.
[02:35:39.692 --> 02:35:41.954]  We now have a limited supply back in.
[02:35:41.954 --> 02:35:45.758]  It's a different formula than the Super Male.
[02:35:45.758 --> 02:35:48.220]  And you've heard the right reviews.
[02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:49.722]  Great gift for Mother's Day to give your
[02:35:50.874 --> 02:35:55.016]  Mom or give your wife or to give your girlfriend.
[02:35:55.016 --> 02:35:56.716]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:35:56.716 --> 02:35:59.377]  Super Female Vitality is back in stock.
[02:35:59.377 --> 02:36:04.579]  The premier high-quality non-GMO concentrated extracts.
[02:36:04.579 --> 02:36:06.160]  Again, Infowarslife.com.
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:08.161]  Okay, Ron Finley, ronfinley.com.
[02:36:09.301 --> 02:36:11.522]  Get more into what you've done since then.
[02:36:11.522 --> 02:36:14.302]  I was reading the news, other people picked up on it.
[02:36:14.302 --> 02:36:22.464]  There are other community garden programs around the country, but usually the government says, here's the spot, you can do it, far removed, away from people's homes.
[02:36:22.464 --> 02:36:24.205]  Really, before we go to calls, at 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[02:36:24.205 --> 02:36:26.985]  Before we do that, you've got the floor for the next ten minutes.
[02:36:26.985 --> 02:36:30.126]  Give us a speech, tell us where you stand, what you've done, where this is going.
[02:36:38.652 --> 02:36:48.580]  Right now, Alex, the law has been changed in Los Angeles where you can now plant edibles on your parkway in front of your house.
[02:36:48.580 --> 02:36:51.182]  The mayor signed it last month.
[02:36:51.182 --> 02:36:53.985]  So I mean, it is, it's a big victory.
[02:36:53.985 --> 02:36:56.406]  And like you said, yeah, the parkways are cool.
[02:36:56.406 --> 02:36:59.589]  If you put them together, that's acres and acres and acres of space.
[02:36:59.589 --> 02:37:01.971]  But I want some of these vacant lots, man.
[02:37:01.971 --> 02:37:05.434]  I want people to be able to walk outside of their house.
[02:37:05.714 --> 02:37:06.475]  Thank you so much.
[02:37:22.972 --> 02:37:27.955]  People ask me, why do you call it gangster?
[02:37:27.955 --> 02:37:29.817]  I say, this is gangster.
[02:37:29.817 --> 02:37:31.958]  You want to know what true gangster is?
[02:37:31.958 --> 02:37:33.199]  It's being self-sufficient.
[02:37:33.199 --> 02:37:34.860]  It's building your community.
[02:37:34.860 --> 02:37:38.243]  It's not tearing it down.
[02:37:38.243 --> 02:37:39.964]  It's educating.
[02:37:39.964 --> 02:37:40.844]  It's helping people.
[02:37:40.844 --> 02:37:43.346]  I got a hashtag, real gangsters grow food.
[02:37:43.346 --> 02:37:44.307]  Real G's grow flowers.
[02:37:49.150 --> 02:37:52.233]  You know, and that's true to me, man.
[02:37:52.233 --> 02:37:55.076]  It's like, all the lessons are in the soil.
[02:37:55.076 --> 02:37:59.940]  You know, I don't grow food, I grow soil.
[02:37:59.940 --> 02:38:03.343]  You know, because you are, people they tell us, you are what you eat.
[02:38:03.343 --> 02:38:06.686]  That's kind of not true, because you are what you eat eats.
[02:38:07.307 --> 02:38:12.889]  You know, now if your soil is deficient of any kind of nutrients, what do you think your plant's going to be?
[02:38:12.889 --> 02:38:15.309]  What do you think your lettuces and your tomatoes?
[02:38:15.309 --> 02:38:16.270]  They're not going to grow.
[02:38:16.270 --> 02:38:18.090]  They're not going to prosper.
[02:38:18.090 --> 02:38:22.971]  But the same thing, like you were saying earlier, everything starts from a seed.
[02:38:22.971 --> 02:38:25.032]  We started from a seed, Alex.
[02:38:25.032 --> 02:38:27.773]  And people get away from that concept, man.
[02:38:27.773 --> 02:38:35.395]  They look at what we turned into, and the same thing, this little tiny seed can give you, you know, a 50-foot tree that gives you fruit.
[02:38:35.575 --> 02:38:35.835]  No, no.
[02:38:35.835 --> 02:38:36.375]  Leaves are a resource.
[02:38:54.446 --> 02:38:57.729]  You know, a leaf falls for a reason in a particular season.
[02:38:57.729 --> 02:38:59.110]  That's by design.
[02:38:59.110 --> 02:39:06.596]  You know, and we need to stop trying to change Mother Earth's design and do biomimicry and mimic what she's doing.
[02:39:06.596 --> 02:39:08.638]  Because who gardens in a forest, Alex?
[02:39:09.716 --> 02:39:10.836]  If nobody.
[02:39:10.836 --> 02:39:14.417]  So how the hell do we have 350 foot trees?
[02:39:14.417 --> 02:39:17.618]  You know, because it's a divine plan.
[02:39:17.618 --> 02:39:27.121]  It's an incredible, it's magic and all the synergy and the harmony and absolutely, you know, when I had children my brain clicked and I...
[02:39:28.132 --> 02:39:32.474]  Opened up a lot, but when you garden, it really is spiritual.
[02:39:32.474 --> 02:39:38.777]  And that's why they don't want people doing it, because you zone out when you're doing it.
[02:39:38.777 --> 02:39:45.900]  It's just programmed into us to be life givers, life builders, to work with the earth, to be positive.
[02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:51.972]  It means you need a garden.
[02:39:51.972 --> 02:39:54.693]  You know, it becomes your solace.
[02:39:54.693 --> 02:39:56.833]  And that's what I tell people, man.
[02:39:56.833 --> 02:39:58.614]  The soil seduces you.
[02:39:58.614 --> 02:39:59.655]  I mean, period.
[02:39:59.655 --> 02:40:01.835]  And you got to think that's where we come from.
[02:40:01.835 --> 02:40:03.216]  That's what we are, man.
[02:40:03.216 --> 02:40:08.938]  And I'm trying to just get people back into where you can design your own life.
[02:40:08.938 --> 02:40:10.479]  I talk to kids, Alex, they don't dream.
[02:40:11.199 --> 02:40:14.903]  You know, and that bothers me, because a dream is free.
[02:40:14.903 --> 02:40:18.166]  But you got people's minds to the point that they don't even dream?
[02:40:18.166 --> 02:40:19.227]  That's control.
[02:40:19.227 --> 02:40:20.589]  And I'm trying to break those terms.
[02:40:28.957 --> 02:40:36.960]  Watching these incredibly unhappy rich people, because I know a bunch of them, thinking that they aren't adequate, and they've got to follow what this is saying.
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:39.361]  We're being farmed by the corporatists.
[02:40:39.361 --> 02:40:44.923]  It's time to get out of that system, get outside, and start doing this.
[02:40:44.923 --> 02:40:52.465]  I mean, it really is in my gut, but also intellectually, I know this is one of the keys to really overturning this system peacefully.
[02:40:52.465 --> 02:40:54.626]  Because they sell us on violent revolution as the way to go.
[02:40:54.626 --> 02:40:56.267]  Well, that's because they can win that every day.
[02:40:56.747 --> 02:41:09.622]  But a velvet revolution of culture, of art, of food, of literature, of gardening, that's something the system can't beat because it's so innately human, you just do it, as you were saying, and everybody comes.
[02:41:09.622 --> 02:41:10.644]  You don't have to sell anything.
[02:41:11.598 --> 02:41:11.918]  No.
[02:41:11.918 --> 02:41:16.682]  And you know, I had some folks here, they did a march against Monsanto.
[02:41:16.682 --> 02:41:20.965]  And I'm like, and people are like, Ron, everyone was expecting you to be at the march.
[02:41:20.965 --> 02:41:23.287]  And I'm like, why were they expecting me to be there?
[02:41:23.287 --> 02:41:28.691]  I'm like, I didn't, I mean, hey, Monsanto don't really care about you guys marching.
[02:41:29.131 --> 02:41:30.912]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:41:30.912 --> 02:41:35.095]  All the thousand or however many people was there, I said, you know what I did?
[02:41:35.095 --> 02:41:38.298]  That day I had 60 people putting in a garden.
[02:41:38.298 --> 02:41:44.022]  So now imagine if you had all those people that were marching and doing that, which is cool.
[02:41:44.022 --> 02:41:45.263]  I mean, people need to march.
[02:41:45.263 --> 02:41:50.346]  But just imagine, Alex, if that energy went into all those people putting in gardens.
[02:41:50.346 --> 02:41:52.388]  I mean, there's your fight against my son.
[02:41:52.588 --> 02:41:55.450]  That's what I always say, vote with your dollars, vote with your action.
[02:41:55.450 --> 02:42:07.077]  If the 10,000 great people that marched in almost every city, like 10,000 in Austin, even more I know in other areas, if they all went and put in a garden or a plant, that would overturn Monsanto in a year.
[02:42:07.077 --> 02:42:11.719]  I mean, there'd be so much fresh non-GMO food everywhere, it'd be crazy.
[02:42:11.719 --> 02:42:14.541]  And what are they going to do, SWAT team us for growing tomatoes?
[02:42:14.541 --> 02:42:17.663]  I mean, we're that close if people just get into this.
[02:42:18.849 --> 02:42:23.015]  No, that's one of the jokes I tell about my garden, you know.
[02:42:23.015 --> 02:42:26.640]  I said, all of a sudden, you know, I plant a tomato.
[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:30.185]  Next thing I know, you know, we got a black guy planting a tomato.
[02:42:30.185 --> 02:42:31.426]  OK, we're going to need backup.
[02:42:33.027 --> 02:42:34.168]  You know, it was like that.
[02:42:34.168 --> 02:42:38.311]  You know, they call SWAT because, you know, hey, he's got cabbage on his street.
[02:42:38.311 --> 02:42:40.353]  You know, we got to do something about that.
[02:42:40.353 --> 02:42:42.234]  It's ridiculous, man.
[02:42:42.234 --> 02:42:45.417]  And we got to break these slave chains.
[02:42:45.417 --> 02:42:49.820]  And I'm talking about everybody because they own our food.
[02:42:49.820 --> 02:42:51.342]  They control our food.
[02:42:51.342 --> 02:42:53.463]  So therefore, they control us.
[02:42:53.463 --> 02:42:57.747]  Well, look at how they've been waging war against the American farmer for 70, 80 years.
[02:42:57.747 --> 02:42:59.168]  These robber barons know what they're doing.
[02:43:00.532 --> 02:43:06.637]  Yeah, and the thing about it, they're depleting all the resources from the soil to the water while they're doing it.
[02:43:06.637 --> 02:43:12.181]  And they're creating all these super bugs and super weeds, you know, because of the toxic sprays.
[02:43:12.181 --> 02:43:15.423]  And everything is a new rare cancer now.
[02:43:15.423 --> 02:43:17.705]  Every day you go, oh, she has a rare cancer.
[02:43:17.705 --> 02:43:21.808]  I was about to say, I've studied this architecture of this evil.
[02:43:21.808 --> 02:43:24.690]  It's so hard to be as evil as they are.
[02:43:24.690 --> 02:43:28.993]  I mean, how did they come up with something... You're doing so good, Alex!
[02:43:28.993 --> 02:43:29.413]  Do what?
[02:43:30.413 --> 02:43:32.114]  How do they do it so well, then?
[02:43:32.114 --> 02:43:35.415]  Yeah, no, I'm saying it's just so... I mean, they are so evil.
[02:43:35.415 --> 02:43:37.415]  I mean, when you really study them, they know what they're doing.
[02:43:37.415 --> 02:43:40.256]  I mean, they... These are some smooth operators.
[02:43:40.256 --> 02:43:42.977]  That's one of those, don't hate the player, hate the game kind of thing.
[02:43:42.977 --> 02:43:46.158]  Because they know that if we can do what they do, it's good.
[02:43:46.998 --> 02:43:51.462]  As they do, I mean, oh man, the world would be a beautiful place.
[02:43:51.462 --> 02:43:55.566]  My word has spread literally, Alex, around the world.
[02:43:55.566 --> 02:43:59.449]  I mean, from North Korea to Africa, man.
[02:43:59.449 --> 02:44:04.433]  I've spoken in Qatar and Oman and Greece.
[02:44:04.433 --> 02:44:08.897]  I got a garden named after me in Bristol's UK.
[02:44:11.539 --> 02:44:26.192]  I was about to say, you are a testament to one man or one woman, one human, taking action, not thinking it'd be big, not doing it to be Mr. Cool, already successful in your own right, and it just resonated and is already changing the world.
[02:44:26.192 --> 02:44:29.976]  That is the microcosm, the archetype, of what will defeat this system.
[02:44:30.779 --> 02:44:37.228]  And I mean, the thing about with me, Alex, I didn't even, I wasn't even trying.
[02:44:37.228 --> 02:44:42.936]  I tell people I'm the most reluctant anarchist, not an activist.
[02:44:42.936 --> 02:44:46.141]  I'm not saying you're an anarchist against the corporate system.
[02:44:46.141 --> 02:44:47.122]  Organic anarchy.
[02:44:47.943 --> 02:44:48.563]  Anarchist.
[02:44:48.563 --> 02:44:52.085]  You know, my card says head troublemaker, you know?
[02:44:52.085 --> 02:44:54.146]  But I mean, none of this was planned, Alex.
[02:44:54.146 --> 02:45:12.474]  So if I could do this without the plan, without the blueprint, and where I have guys talking about me on the news in Brazil, you know, where they took over a lot outside their apartment building, now they're taking over another lot because it's so successful, man.
[02:45:12.474 --> 02:45:15.495]  That's what I want to hear, man.
[02:45:15.495 --> 02:45:16.936]  I call it life revolution.
[02:45:17.356 --> 02:45:21.061]  Spreading life, getting aggressive.
[02:45:21.061 --> 02:45:22.683]  Yeah, man, I tell you it's exciting what you're doing.
[02:45:22.683 --> 02:45:29.771]  I want to take a few phone calls, but ronfinley.com, people can go there, they can see what you've done, they can augment it, do their own thing.
[02:45:29.771 --> 02:45:32.755]  I just want to challenge everybody today, this is the season to do it.
[02:45:32.755 --> 02:45:36.419]  Start planting, even if it's just some sunflowers, some tomatoes, some peppers.
[02:45:37.220 --> 02:45:51.284]  Whatever it is you're into, I mean, if you live on the West Coast or areas that are good, you know, plant some grapes, plant some tomatoes, plant some lemons, some limes, some whatever.
[02:45:51.284 --> 02:45:53.565]  It's just so exciting to do this.
[02:45:53.565 --> 02:45:57.346]  Ron Finley is our guest, changing the world by taking action.
[02:45:57.346 --> 02:45:58.687]  Just simply amazing.
[02:45:58.687 --> 02:46:02.748]  We got Terrence, Renee, Joseph, Stephen, Ray, and many others.
[02:46:03.608 --> 02:46:07.390]  Let's go ahead and talk to Terrence first in California, in your neck of the woods.
[02:46:07.390 --> 02:46:22.317]  The guy we have on the line, Ron Finley of ronfinley.com, just got the second most populous city in North America, well I guess Mexico City is bigger than New York, so third most populous city in North America, to legalize planting food in the right-of-ways.
[02:46:22.317 --> 02:46:24.298]  How incredible is that?
[02:46:24.298 --> 02:46:26.779]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Terrence.
[02:46:26.779 --> 02:46:28.480]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:30.801]  Pleasure to meet you, Ron and Alex.
[02:46:31.908 --> 02:46:33.290]  Ron, I got a question for you.
[02:46:33.290 --> 02:46:37.934]  What do you think about the geoengineering that's going on with the California drought?
[02:46:37.934 --> 02:46:57.892]  Alex had a guest on some time ago from StopTheCrime.net and she discusses different things about the Monsanto group purposely putting things into the clouds to prevent the rain while causing more rain and more devastation in the Midwest with their snowstorms and depriving us of our
[02:46:58.052 --> 02:47:08.581]  We know geoengineering is going on, but they classify what they're doing, just like you mentioned superweeds, antibiotic resistant stuff from the chickens and everything else.
[02:47:08.581 --> 02:47:11.344]  Are you aware of the larger program of manipulating the weather?
[02:47:13.027 --> 02:47:14.889]  No, I mean, no.
[02:47:14.889 --> 02:47:16.610]  I mean, you see it though.
[02:47:16.610 --> 02:47:23.055]  I mean, it's funny because even guys that fly the planes, they, oh, those are, those are comm trails.
[02:47:23.055 --> 02:47:24.076]  That's every, yeah.
[02:47:24.076 --> 02:47:25.957]  Why are they in this pattern, dude?
[02:47:25.957 --> 02:47:31.622]  Why all of a sudden do they dissipate and they join together and all of a sudden we have this cloud cover?
[02:47:31.622 --> 02:47:33.583]  Um, it's, it's, um,
[02:47:36.385 --> 02:47:37.346]  I don't know.
[02:47:37.346 --> 02:47:45.269]  See, here, it doesn't benefit California, which is one of the biggest agricultural states in the United States of America.
[02:47:45.269 --> 02:47:48.091]  They want to bankrupt the whole thing?
[02:47:48.091 --> 02:47:49.471]  Well, who's that going to be?
[02:47:49.471 --> 02:47:56.575]  That's not going to benefit the powers that be, the biggest landowners in this state, though, Alex.
[02:47:56.575 --> 02:48:02.278]  I mean, if their whole thing is about money, Alex, why would they want to bankrupt it?
[02:48:03.218 --> 02:48:05.181]  You just brought up the key point because it's beyond that.
[02:48:05.181 --> 02:48:08.865]  They've got the ultra-rich, but there's people above that that are long-term.
[02:48:08.865 --> 02:48:15.713]  Once they bankrupt it for a decade, they can come in and buy it all up and be the breadbasket for the next 200 years for all of North America.
[02:48:15.713 --> 02:48:18.036]  It's long-term players.
[02:48:18.036 --> 02:48:19.117]  Terrence, great question.
[02:48:19.117 --> 02:48:21.640]  Renee in South Dakota, you're on the air.
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:21.981]  Welcome.
[02:48:23.533 --> 02:48:27.738]  Well, I just want to say that in the 1920s, there were no grocery stores.
[02:48:27.738 --> 02:48:29.280]  So where was the groceries?
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:30.342]  It was in the gardens.
[02:48:30.342 --> 02:48:31.283]  It was in the homes.
[02:48:31.283 --> 02:48:32.224]  It was on the farms.
[02:48:32.224 --> 02:48:34.006]  It was all local.
[02:48:34.006 --> 02:48:36.489]  You know, you didn't have to go to the grocery store.
[02:48:36.489 --> 02:48:37.591]  Now they got us.
[02:48:37.591 --> 02:48:38.252]  They know that.
[02:48:39.012 --> 02:48:40.954]  And I've been planting my plants.
[02:48:40.954 --> 02:48:42.996]  I've been buying just straight seeds.
[02:48:42.996 --> 02:48:45.998]  And I've been putting them in plastic containers.
[02:48:45.998 --> 02:48:50.742]  And I've got about, I've got a whole garden full of seeds for one person.
[02:48:50.742 --> 02:48:54.645]  I'm probably going to be giving away everything by the end of my season.
[02:48:54.645 --> 02:48:57.708]  And I mean, my tomatoes are already two feet high.
[02:48:57.708 --> 02:48:59.249]  I planted them two weeks ago.
[02:48:59.249 --> 02:49:03.673]  I just threw some seeds in and it's amazing to watch the seeds come up.
[02:49:05.043 --> 02:49:07.785]  You got magic soil, Renee.
[02:49:07.785 --> 02:49:09.966]  Two feet in two weeks?
[02:49:09.966 --> 02:49:12.087]  That's crazy.
[02:49:12.087 --> 02:49:14.669]  Well, no, maybe it's been about three weeks.
[02:49:14.669 --> 02:49:18.291]  But I mean, really, I mean, I've been blessing my plants every day.
[02:49:18.291 --> 02:49:23.234]  And I mean, you know, they do respond.
[02:49:23.234 --> 02:49:28.017]  It's amazing just seeing the watermelon seeds come up and them sprouting out of the soil.
[02:49:28.017 --> 02:49:33.740]  And, you know, I throw a little cup of water on them each day in my windowsill.
[02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:35.221]  Well, it's what Ron said, though.
[02:49:35.221 --> 02:49:41.786]  I love how you're out in your garden and a little hummingbird flies up right by your face and then winks at you and flies off.
[02:49:41.786 --> 02:49:45.009]  I mean, let me tell you, gardens are a lot better than watching TV.
[02:49:45.009 --> 02:49:47.491]  I mean, I'm here to tell you.
[02:49:47.491 --> 02:49:49.592]  No, literally, you get seduced.
[02:49:49.592 --> 02:49:58.139]  I mean, I, you know, I've known I've gone out in the morning to watch stuff and all of a sudden it's four hours later when you were only supposed to be out there 20 minutes.
[02:49:58.619 --> 02:50:05.823]  You know, no, I it's like it becomes your solace literally in your meditation.
[02:50:05.823 --> 02:50:07.364]  I on my Parkway.
[02:50:07.364 --> 02:50:19.291]  I've actually have seating that I made out of logs man, and you can come and people are sitting out there having coffee and I mean the bottom line if you build it, it's going to people.
[02:50:19.291 --> 02:50:22.913]  Well, it's been said that make art make culture that will defeat the globalist.
[02:50:23.797 --> 02:50:25.518]  Oh, totally, totally, totally.
[02:50:25.518 --> 02:50:39.227]  And that's what it's all about is showing people how creative they can be and giving them the ideas, man, because we have to show a lot of people that they have the ability to dream.
[02:50:39.227 --> 02:50:41.449]  You know, we have to show, look, look at this.
[02:50:41.449 --> 02:50:42.730]  You can dream about this.
[02:50:42.730 --> 02:50:44.351]  A lot of times people need help with that.
[02:50:44.571 --> 02:50:46.972]  And I mean, if that's what I think we're here to do... And a garden's something you can do.
[02:50:46.972 --> 02:50:51.494]  You can dream it, you can grow it, you can have success, you can get better, it can build competency.
[02:50:51.494 --> 02:50:55.616]  This whole system is about making you think you have no power except through the system.
[02:50:55.616 --> 02:50:56.797]  Rene, thank you.

[02:52:06.848 --> 02:52:15.250]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:52:15.250 --> 02:52:20.131]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:52:20.131 --> 02:52:25.913]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowars.com.
[02:52:26.834 --> 02:52:34.019]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:52:34.019 --> 02:52:41.044]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:52:41.044 --> 02:52:45.527]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:52:45.527 --> 02:52:48.709]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:52:48.809 --> 02:52:55.114]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:52:55.114 --> 02:52:57.756]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:52:57.756 --> 02:52:59.698]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:52:59.698 --> 02:53:03.321]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[02:53:03.321 --> 02:53:04.262]  A pair of scissors.
[02:53:04.662 --> 02:53:10.445]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[02:53:10.445 --> 02:53:15.388]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[02:53:15.388 --> 02:53:16.368]  The phone line.
[02:53:16.368 --> 02:53:21.611]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[02:53:21.611 --> 02:53:25.533]  But, a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:53:25.533 --> 02:53:28.415]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[02:53:28.835 --> 02:53:31.296]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[02:53:31.296 --> 02:53:35.638]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[02:53:35.638 --> 02:53:38.980]  Scissors can't cut it, and that means your home stays safe.

[02:54:02.908 --> 02:54:07.512]  Everybody knows.
[02:54:07.512 --> 02:54:11.756]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[02:54:11.756 --> 02:54:16.721]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[02:54:16.721 --> 02:54:21.305]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[02:54:21.305 --> 02:54:24.888]  Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[02:54:25.970 --> 02:54:28.873]  Ron Finley, ronfinley.com is our guest.
[02:54:28.873 --> 02:54:36.342]  Maybe he'll do five more minutes the next hour, take more of your calls, we'll see if he can stay with us, but I'm gonna cut over all the other news after he's gone.
[02:54:36.342 --> 02:54:41.808]  It's not over simplistic to say, going back to the soapbox, going back to the...
[02:54:42.557 --> 02:54:55.820]  Back to having your neighbors over for a barbecue, going back to having a garden, going back to disconnecting the television a few hours a day and taking your kids off the video games, going fishing, going playing a softball game.
[02:54:55.820 --> 02:55:02.522]  I mean, just anything that's normal human activity that's not in this big globalist combine.
[02:55:03.630 --> 02:55:08.553]  And nothing like microagriculture is more powerful.
[02:55:08.553 --> 02:55:09.834]  That's why they're targeting Amish.
[02:55:09.834 --> 02:55:16.338]  It's why they're going after, like I said earlier, any type of farmer's markets, raw milk.
[02:55:16.338 --> 02:55:22.421]  It's why I've seen in LA where they go after these co-op places where people are coming and selling their produce.
[02:55:22.421 --> 02:55:27.144]  It's all done in the name of safety, but it's done to dominate and control people.
[02:55:27.144 --> 02:55:28.565]  Prisoners can't grow their own food.
[02:55:29.673 --> 02:55:31.376]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:55:31.376 --> 02:55:36.323]  Ron Finley, I want to take some more phone calls here, but anything else you'd like to add before we go to Joseph and others?
[02:55:38.044 --> 02:55:41.706]  No, just, I mean, you hit it on the head with the whole prisoner things.
[02:55:41.706 --> 02:55:47.990]  I mean, people think because they can get into their swanky cars and drive around that they're, that they're not in prison.
[02:55:47.990 --> 02:55:50.751]  I mean, and that's why I call these food prisons.
[02:55:50.751 --> 02:55:53.653]  You know, like you said, you can't grow your own food in prison.
[02:55:53.653 --> 02:56:02.318]  And that's the fact that they have outlaw, you know, this is, this is, you get in, you become a criminal because you plant a carrot.
[02:56:02.318 --> 02:56:03.579]  It's ridiculous, man.
[02:56:03.579 --> 02:56:05.040]  And, um, uh,
[02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:06.761]  It has to change.
[02:56:06.761 --> 02:56:11.446]  And like you said earlier in the segment, we're seeing the fall, man.
[02:56:11.446 --> 02:56:14.409]  We're seeing, you know, McDonald's, some of those are closing.
[02:56:14.409 --> 02:56:15.630]  We're seeing them coming.
[02:56:15.630 --> 02:56:18.252]  Oh, they're slowly changing.
[02:56:18.252 --> 02:56:19.313]  Natural chicken.
[02:56:19.313 --> 02:56:23.317]  A lot of the stuff they're cutting out, you know.
[02:56:23.317 --> 02:56:24.859]  And that's because people are voting with their dollars.
[02:56:25.900 --> 02:56:26.381]  Exactly.
[02:56:26.381 --> 02:56:28.764]  And they see they have to.
[02:56:28.764 --> 02:56:36.756]  Their sales are down and they're like, okay, now we, it's terrible that we have to take it to this point for them to do the right thing.
[02:56:36.756 --> 02:56:40.341]  Why are you, why are you selling me toxic food in the first place?
[02:56:40.842 --> 02:56:51.211]  You know, like with the thing with Dunkin' Donuts, where they had the powdered sugar, it was supposed to be not powdered sugar, it was supposed to be some chemical or something that, you know, that looked like powdered sugar on the donut.
[02:56:51.211 --> 02:56:54.274]  Why are you, you know, why are you doing this to us?
[02:56:54.274 --> 02:56:57.096]  Yeah, why would you do something to somebody you wouldn't want done to you?
[02:56:57.096 --> 02:57:01.800]  It's just, it's just a fundamental predatory nature.
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:03.421]  And as you said, the worm is turning.
[02:57:03.421 --> 02:57:04.823]  Very exciting times.
[02:57:04.823 --> 02:57:06.604]  Joseph in California, you're on the air.
[02:57:06.604 --> 02:57:07.265]  Go ahead.
[02:57:08.669 --> 02:57:10.650]  Hey, I have a question.
[02:57:10.650 --> 02:57:14.351]  Pleasure to be on your show, but I have a question for Finley.
[02:57:14.351 --> 02:57:19.033]  What do you think is the state's government role in agriculture?
[02:57:19.033 --> 02:57:21.814]  And for Jones, you just mentioned co-ops.
[02:57:21.814 --> 02:57:22.374]  You have like
[02:57:23.332 --> 02:57:26.755]  Do you think there should be a balance between socialism and crony capitalism?
[02:57:26.755 --> 02:57:34.021]  Because, you know, I used to be a cookie-cutter liberal, but now I'm a libertarian, and I just think there should be a balance between the two.
[02:57:34.021 --> 02:57:34.281]  Sure.
[02:57:34.281 --> 02:57:39.065]  Listen, when you hear the term co-op, that has a communist connotation, they had co-ops for that.
[02:57:39.065 --> 02:57:47.091]  All that means is people kind of come in as a group, share some of their profits to pay for the facility and for upkeep, but then people make profits.
[02:57:47.091 --> 02:57:52.356]  So I'm talking about co-ops based on... But again, co-ops only work on the micro.
[02:57:53.254 --> 02:57:58.216]  Okay, that's why small is beautiful, and that's what I've seen work in my own life, but that's my view.
[02:57:58.216 --> 02:58:01.598]  What's your take on that, Ron?
[02:58:01.598 --> 02:58:05.140]  Well, I mean, that's what I want.
[02:58:05.140 --> 02:58:08.942]  As you well know, Alex, you cannot eat all the food that you grow.
[02:58:08.942 --> 02:58:09.702]  It's impossible.
[02:58:09.702 --> 02:58:11.463]  That's all you would be doing is eating.
[02:58:11.463 --> 02:58:13.744]  We're so productive, we gotta share it.
[02:58:15.715 --> 02:58:24.858]  You had a block that was like a co-op where you grow carrots and onions and I grow lettuce and tomatoes and Sally grows cucumbers.
[02:58:24.858 --> 02:58:30.640]  So now you don't have to grow all your food because you can trade between your, uh, between your neighbors.
[02:58:30.640 --> 02:58:31.040]  Exactly.
[02:58:31.040 --> 02:58:32.060]  That's not communism.
[02:58:32.060 --> 02:58:34.121]  That's human activity interaction.
[02:58:34.121 --> 02:58:34.681]  Stay there.
[02:58:34.681 --> 02:58:35.802]  Do five more minutes with us.
