[00:00.000 --> 00:13.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.560 --> 00:36.520]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones all right folks
[00:36.520 --> 00:44.560]  it is another unbelievably jam-packed broadcast day lined up before us here at 11 a.m. central
[00:44.560 --> 00:49.400]  standard time as a lot of stations carry us live others air us in different times around the
[00:49.400 --> 00:54.280]  country and there's folks listening on shortwave and satellite internet all over the world want
[00:54.280 --> 01:00.160]  to welcome you to the world by transmission and I really realize that I've tried this about 100
[01:00.160 --> 01:05.000]  times and failed every time but I think today is going to be the day that I succeed everybody
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.000]  pretty much knows what a lot of the big news is there is some breaking news we're going to be
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.440]  getting to but I'm going to just open the phones up for first-time callers and I'm going to go to
[01:12.440 --> 01:16.440]  your phone call and I'm going to give the person one minute and I'm going to move the next person
[01:16.440 --> 01:20.520]  now that never actually been able to do this back 10 15 years ago I could do talk radio and take
[01:20.520 --> 01:28.600]  50 phone calls an hour in 45 minutes of airtime I just cannot get out of the rut I'm in of just
[01:28.600 --> 01:33.680]  covering news and ranting and pontificating which is incredibly popular and I think informative
[01:33.680 --> 01:40.040]  to a certain extent but I am still very hungry to and many of you've heard this probably 100 times
[01:40.040 --> 01:44.320]  the last 10 years heard me give this speech that I'm going to take your calls and it's kind of
[01:44.320 --> 01:48.480]  like licking to the center of a tootsie roll how many licks is it take to get to the center of a
[01:48.480 --> 01:55.920]  tootsie pop or whatever it's called and a little owl goes one two three crunch a three and it's the
[01:55.920 --> 02:00.400]  same thing I can never get through five or six articles without one of them making me mad and
[02:00.400 --> 02:04.960]  going off onto a rant that makes me think of something else that goes to another rant but
[02:05.840 --> 02:15.040]  in the interest of time we are going to come back open the phones up and take a lot of calls
[02:15.040 --> 02:20.720]  and go over news as well Facebook photo shows another google mystery barge off the coast of Maine
[02:22.080 --> 02:28.080]  this is a technological above breakaway civilization takeover that's what I keep
[02:28.080 --> 02:35.200]  explaining to people these are NSA ships lying off the coast in fact we ought to play that
[02:35.200 --> 02:40.560]  christa bird song that the network's got I think it's called revolution because it talks about
[02:40.560 --> 02:47.360]  tall ships lying off the coast and they carry the light in the dark of the night not this time
[02:47.360 --> 02:55.600]  they carry the spy grid and they're just doing whatever they want whenever they want and they're
[02:55.600 --> 03:01.360]  even preparing for plan B's if we pass laws making what they've done illegal they're going to do it
[03:01.360 --> 03:07.280]  offshore because the globalists are offshore diplomatic immunity above the law and they're
[03:07.280 --> 03:12.400]  trying to disarm all of our nations and all of us individually so only the corporate global
[03:12.400 --> 03:18.160]  government has private mercenary armies and the UN and NATO have their army and then what's left of
[03:18.160 --> 03:23.840]  our nation armies are components of that new global army where the militaries can't even operate
[03:23.840 --> 03:29.280]  and can't even function on their own and they can't even get the components for the weapon systems
[03:29.280 --> 03:34.720]  unless it comes from China this is what they admit globalism is about it is a diabolical
[03:34.720 --> 03:40.880]  scientific plan and they're carrying it out and then now they're launching giant spy ships
[03:42.080 --> 03:46.800]  and notice you know they're going to know what's in your baby's diaper if he goes to the airport
[03:46.800 --> 03:50.960]  but nobody's going to know what google's doing and then google has like oh we drink beer and play

[10:12.160 --> 10:19.600]  humiliation and all of their scams but admit to ourselves that we're slaves
[10:21.760 --> 10:28.080]  or stand up and do something about it but then still others won't admit their slaves
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.000]  they're just going to rationalize and go along
[10:35.600 --> 10:39.600]  with whatever's put in front of them because they can't even imagine
[10:40.560 --> 10:44.240]  that they could be leaders or that they could resist or that they could build a better world
[10:44.240 --> 10:52.640]  they are receivers not transmitters they are spectators not players on the gladiatorial field

[12:58.960 --> 13:05.120]  russle brand listener of the show said that he took a job working in a newspaper because he was
[13:05.120 --> 13:11.520]  enamored with the beautiful woman that headed it up he was enchanted by her instead of saying oh how
[13:11.520 --> 13:19.440]  romantic the chivalry uh the oh no he's been skewed by the feminazis as rustlin ball would call them
[13:19.440 --> 13:24.320]  he's been skewed by them who know that they're taking over the culture it's not about empowering
[13:24.320 --> 13:30.160]  women it's about empowering them as tyrants never before but with modern feminism as it's called
[13:30.160 --> 13:37.360]  have we seen women more debased more bankrupted more unhealthy more brought low more dishonored
[13:37.360 --> 13:44.560]  more trampled and russle brand tells the establishment anti-human authoritarian salon
[13:47.040 --> 13:52.320]  that he took a job working somewhere because he was so enchanted with the female editor
[13:52.320 --> 14:00.640]  that headed it up and then they called that hateful and and and and all the rest of it when i was
[14:00.640 --> 14:04.640]  asked to edit an issue of the new statesman i said yes because it was a beautiful woman asking me
[14:05.520 --> 14:12.160]  see just the act of men and women loving each other just the purity and goodness of that
[14:13.440 --> 14:19.200]  is anathema to these people they they they know what they're doing they say you can't dress up
[14:19.200 --> 14:25.200]  like a cowboy on halloween it's hurtful to cowboys they are the arbiters of reality they put you
[14:25.200 --> 14:30.160]  in a smaller and smaller cage where your mommy and daddy can't make your lunch they're not trusted
[14:31.040 --> 14:36.160]  where if someone says hey let's go eat chinese food everyone goes don't say chinese i've witnessed that
[14:37.600 --> 14:44.560]  this is the ultimate tyranny and it's done by design these are not misguided liberals these are
[14:44.560 --> 14:50.800]  conscious dominators of the psyche the most vicious mystery and enemies of humanity that
[14:50.800 --> 14:56.560]  you could even imagine and i'm only now coming to the realization of it i've run into them over
[14:56.560 --> 15:00.480]  the years i've talked to them and see the hateful glare but more and more they admit it they are
[15:00.480 --> 15:10.080]  proud of it and that's why they see true liberals thomas jeffersonian libertarian constitutional
[15:10.080 --> 15:19.120]  love and risk loving fast cars loving honored loving strong men loving pure women loving real
[15:19.120 --> 15:27.200]  fights trailblazing adventurism humanity they are at war with humanity because they are ugly inside

[15:32.880 --> 15:39.680]  they do is about dominating you while they are hyperarmed and hyper vicious no feminists with
[15:39.680 --> 15:45.120]  dare criticize bill clinton except somebody like camille paglia who's a real feminist if you want
[15:45.120 --> 15:49.840]  to say that you know actual deep thoughts about empowering women not just fake garbage to suck
[15:49.840 --> 15:54.160]  women into doing what you say to enslave them i think she was the only one that would criticize
[15:54.160 --> 15:59.200]  bill clinton when he settled cases for raping women and biting them and beating them it was like
[15:59.200 --> 16:06.720]  oh how sexy you know when bill clinton rapes a woman it's sick these are sick sick sick sick sick

[17:09.040 --> 17:14.720]  become we're going to have a real debate about humanity's future they have it already set where

[17:19.920 --> 17:24.080]  globalist publication and a handful of these control freaks believe they're going to merge with

[29:05.600 --> 29:10.160]  are more informed and ready to be informed in the general public because on average they're not bad
[29:10.160 --> 29:15.040]  people they and and they've already got questions about things it's just that they don't really
[29:15.040 --> 29:20.400]  have the answers and if you get them information like the navy seals coming out in segment being
[29:20.400 --> 29:26.080]  trained to take guns or you know how foreign banks run the federal reserve they will they will really
[29:26.080 --> 29:30.400]  listen on average or if they freak out on you you know they're run by the southern property

[33:39.120 --> 33:46.080]  in austin texas i am your host all right listen i haven't gotten into all the news and there's a
[33:46.080 --> 33:53.760]  ton of it i've got the 70 plus page report research designed for the multi-market study
[33:53.760 --> 33:58.720]  of critical information needs that's what cast sunstein said they would do they would use regular
[33:58.720 --> 34:04.160]  regulations and agencies and call it something non-threatening like oh affordable care act
[34:04.160 --> 34:11.440]  you like your 539 increase in texas 220 something in california on average this isn't just
[34:11.440 --> 34:16.000]  100 increases that that's what i was giving conservative numbers it looks like they're
[34:16.000 --> 34:21.520]  going to go ahead and double or triple or quadroop right up front because the public loves being
[34:21.520 --> 34:28.400]  abused why not the paramilitary standing by if you don't like it so continuing here uh april
[34:28.400 --> 34:35.200]  2013 and when you get into the report i'm going to be covering what is it on page 23 it says
[34:35.200 --> 34:39.840]  they're going to go assess and make sure we're not being politically incorrect and this is the map
[34:39.840 --> 34:48.240]  to roll out the FCC the internet print media tv cable not just broadcast everything and you've got
[34:48.240 --> 34:51.920]  what is it last time i think we wrote an article a couple years ago two years ago i think it with
[34:51.920 --> 34:58.080]  the headline was more democratic senators join call for fairness doctrine and i think it was like
[34:58.080 --> 35:04.800]  10 of them last time i checked actually said we need to shut down hate radio well i mean let me
[35:04.800 --> 35:10.240]  be honest i do love my family so i do hate you but it's beyond hate now it's more of a more
[35:10.240 --> 35:17.200]  horrified of you but not like in a fearful way like it's horrifying to see a dog get round over by a
[35:17.200 --> 35:25.200]  car it's even more horrifying to see a human hurt even though i've seen lots of violence in my life
[35:25.200 --> 35:31.040]  real and simulated my empathy becomes more intense not less intense but they've got the big studies
[35:31.040 --> 35:36.080]  out the general public is very desensitized that people now laugh at seeing people being run over
[35:36.080 --> 35:41.840]  in the real world because it makes them feel important and powerful and and that's the new man
[35:41.840 --> 35:48.320]  that's supposed to go into the uh new order future i don't think it's a new man i think it's uh uh
[35:48.880 --> 35:55.840]  uh basically the coming of the zombo tron but again we're opening the phones up when you
[35:55.840 --> 35:59.280]  hear someone hang up that's your chance to call in we're not screening your calls you just get
[35:59.280 --> 36:10.640]  about 45 seconds so make your points 800 2599231 800 2599231 dhs approves over 80 of dreamers who
[36:10.640 --> 36:17.520]  apply for legal status there you go and uh folks let me explain something uh obama lets go almost
[36:17.520 --> 36:23.680]  all the illegal aliens that they pick up they they they put a few in detention centers that they
[36:23.680 --> 36:28.080]  admit under the emergency centers establishment act are just being primed and pumped with the
[36:28.080 --> 36:35.440]  legals uh for the general public uh but uh that is uh being uh reported by the washington free beacon
[36:35.440 --> 36:43.200]  and others uh directly from dhs's own admissions and and again my whole point is just like homes in
[36:43.200 --> 36:48.240]  detroit homes in atlanta homes in austin some of them got over 80 million dollars
[36:49.760 --> 36:56.880]  per household in fake tax refunds and then no one gets in trouble because those are being sent to
[36:56.880 --> 37:05.280]  mafia groups through the democratic party chicago mafia compound combine and so you see to know that
[37:05.280 --> 37:10.160]  so so my whole deal is this is going to be the black market for the new world order it's just
[37:10.160 --> 37:16.800]  that you're not going to get to be part of it unless you are part of the latin american train
[37:17.360 --> 37:21.520]  that they're going to use economically to break north america and it's not meant to help these
[37:21.520 --> 37:26.480]  folks once they're done you know they'll have a new slave population up here uh while they try to
[37:26.480 --> 37:30.160]  reduce population in latin america with the sterilants and the Gardasil shots and the rest of it
[37:30.880 --> 37:35.760]  they can bring up an excess population here to replace the baby boomers who have 1.3 children
[37:35.760 --> 37:40.160]  on average and who are dying out the population that was here previously so there'll be a new
[37:40.160 --> 37:46.160]  slave population but but right now again just like a mousetrap that has a piece of cheese on it the
[37:46.160 --> 37:50.640]  the incentive is the free welfare and the double standard and all of it it's total discrimination
[37:50.640 --> 37:56.400]  that's why msnbc and other enemy platforms promote constantly you know you you will support the
[37:56.400 --> 38:00.720]  free health care of your races you will support open borders of your races we're like look at
[38:00.720 --> 38:05.120]  all the economic actuaries this will drive down wages even more obama care everybody will go to
[38:05.120 --> 38:09.120]  part time then you'll have to go on welfare and now that's official and it's going to bankrupt
[38:09.120 --> 38:12.800]  things even faster and it doesn't give you free health care i mean if you thought the affordable
[38:12.800 --> 38:17.440]  care act was great just wait till it's free because you know it's supposed to be free soon
[38:18.880 --> 38:22.080]  yeah free to bankrupt you i mean you're going to be free to go die in a ditch i guess
[38:22.080 --> 38:28.960]  but see it'll take a few years to fully bankrupt everything and then you're gonna get your medicine
[38:28.960 --> 38:34.160]  they're gonna give you pain pills when you need heart surgery or whatever knee surgery and you
[38:34.160 --> 38:41.280]  can just you can just die so and then the rich will be able to go get their private clinic health
[38:41.280 --> 38:46.000]  care that aren't in the dirty buildings in the dirty hospitals and with all the deadly bugs in
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.840]  them and it'll cost 10 times what it does now that they've already done this model in some
[38:49.840 --> 38:53.600]  european countries and you'll be able if you're really rich you'll be able to go get a lot of
[38:53.600 --> 38:58.160]  incredible stuff and that's how it's all set up because the general public's not going to get the
[38:58.160 --> 39:04.480]  life extension technologies get that through your brain the foreign banks that run the suicide
[39:04.480 --> 39:10.160]  compounds in china and the and the mobile execution vans they're that's when they're in control that's
[39:10.160 --> 39:15.920]  what they do when they protest in mexico they machine gun men women and children and then
[39:15.920 --> 39:20.480]  mexico says be loving don't be racist let all our people up there because the mexican government
[39:20.480 --> 39:25.920]  is going to deal with the globalist to bring down the entire north american system the mexican
[39:25.920 --> 39:30.560]  government who has the nickname for the general mexican population of cockroaches that's well
[39:30.560 --> 39:35.360]  known in spanish absolutely hates their people i love their people i don't want them to abort
[39:35.360 --> 39:39.360]  their children i don't want their children to take the Gardasil the sterilized them i want to see
[39:39.360 --> 39:45.680]  them industrialized and advanced and bring them up because i am a human with a big fat loving soul
[39:45.680 --> 39:51.120]  who wants to lift people up because i know it lifts me up when they fall i fall
[39:52.800 --> 39:58.880]  i'm the real liberal these people running the system are absolute eugenesis hellbent to enslave
[39:58.880 --> 40:03.920]  us and if you haven't figured that out yet folks you better figure it out real quick all right let's
[40:03.920 --> 40:10.000]  stop right there and go back to the phone calls as promised gordon in canada your next up thank you
[40:10.000 --> 40:17.120]  for joining us hey alex you're on fire today well thank you brother yeah a couple of quick
[40:17.120 --> 40:20.960]  points alex do you remember a few months ago you mentioned these floods and high river and
[40:20.960 --> 40:25.520]  alberta where the rc and p complicated people's weapons while they were out of their homes that's
[40:25.520 --> 40:29.200]  right that was on record just like anywhere else in the world where the globalist control
[40:29.200 --> 40:34.400]  any type of disaster they take your weapons yes it's just come out alex it's been discovered they
[40:34.400 --> 40:40.320]  also confiscated over two tons of ammunition from people's homes and while there was a shortage of
[40:40.320 --> 40:45.520]  boats during the flood they used these boats to go into people's homes and confiscate two
[40:45.520 --> 40:50.480]  tons of ammunition they're just now reimbursing people for their smashed indoors well well you
[40:50.480 --> 40:55.520]  know why they always do that they want the the troops and the police ready to confiscate guns
[40:55.520 --> 41:00.560]  and any chance they have they always try to take them you can be in a high and dry area with your
[41:00.560 --> 41:05.200]  own generator that's the first house they're coming to and it's to test who will follow the orders
[41:06.240 --> 41:12.800]  and so it's part of the cultural shift alex i just want to say one more quick thing where
[41:12.800 --> 41:19.520]  there's more people awake every day it is coming to a conclusion sometime in the future are you
[41:19.520 --> 41:26.480]  science fiction fan alex i am a science fiction fan back when i had time to read the greats well
[41:26.480 --> 41:31.520]  movies i can't help but feel what's happening now you remember at the end of the first star wars
[41:31.520 --> 41:37.040]  movie where the x-wing fighters are coming in and the lieutenant goes up to the death star commander
[41:37.040 --> 41:41.840]  i think it was played by peter cushing and he said you know we better evacuate these guys are on
[41:41.840 --> 41:48.080]  to something do you remember what peter cushing said he said evacuate in a moment of triumph
[41:48.080 --> 41:53.920]  i think you overestimate their chances i think i really feel i evacuate in our numbers of triumph
[41:53.920 --> 42:01.520]  i think you overestimate their chances i love that scene alex they it's why the greeks and uh the
[42:01.520 --> 42:05.920]  great american authors and shakespeare wrote about arrogance and hoovers is because it will
[42:05.920 --> 42:12.320]  be the downfall of people that i try to take control without honor several fighters have broken
[42:12.320 --> 42:16.880]  off from the main group come with me all right brother god bless you i appreciate you calling in
[42:16.880 --> 42:23.040]  uh let's go ahead and talk to brian in canada another call from canada you're on the air sir
[42:25.040 --> 42:32.160]  alex i uh am another one of those yeah canadiens who love you to death up here and i just wanted
[42:32.160 --> 42:37.040]  to say this is maybe a little bit off uh topic but i guess i just wanted to share it with you
[42:37.040 --> 42:43.040]  um your slogan says because there's a war on for your mind and i just wondered alex if you would
[42:43.040 --> 42:49.760]  share with your audience what your thoughts are with regard to mind versus brain is the mind
[42:49.760 --> 42:54.560]  the same as the brain in your estimation i'll hang up and listen for your response brother thank you
[42:55.280 --> 42:59.440]  well you know i'm no scientist but i've read a lot of scientific reports and had a lot of top
[42:59.440 --> 43:05.040]  experts on and i don't you know get into some of the areas where they can't completely prove
[43:05.040 --> 43:11.440]  everything but but throughout time a memorial uh historians researchers have pointed out that
[43:11.440 --> 43:16.400]  there's something you know you know more than just the brain it's like they can do a perfect clone
[43:16.400 --> 43:22.880]  that's 100 the same and for some reason it just doesn't have the same vigor it it it
[43:22.880 --> 43:27.040]  doesn't matter whether it's a lizard whether it's a mammal it just isn't the same and we know that
[43:27.040 --> 43:35.520]  there are a six cents we know there are magnetic um cells in the brains not just of mammals but of
[43:36.080 --> 43:40.720]  birds and other uh fish that's how they're able to navigate it's how they're able to fly south
[43:40.720 --> 43:46.640]  for the winter it's how how a hummingbird can fly you know five thousand miles and now from science
[43:46.640 --> 43:54.400]  they know that the brain is able to go into the fourth and fifth dimension in calculations that
[43:54.400 --> 43:59.680]  it's able to make and of course we live in the third dimension and we know when someone is looking
[43:59.680 --> 44:03.760]  at us we feel it i mean it's a fact it's been scientifically proven people can tell when someone's
[44:03.760 --> 44:07.760]  threw a brick wall on the other side in double blind studies over and over again even if they're
[44:07.760 --> 44:12.400]  not supposedly clairvoyant now of course there's a bunch of con artists and people out there jumping
[44:12.400 --> 44:19.200]  on that but we most of us have had dreams where exactly that dream comes true not like you dream
[44:19.200 --> 44:24.000]  of being a rock star you become a rock star i mean you dream of being mugged that's happened to me
[44:24.000 --> 44:29.200]  and then a six months later whatever the exact mugging happens and it's like deja vu and you
[44:29.200 --> 44:33.120]  even know what the person's going to do and it's almost like your brain was able to jump forward
[44:33.120 --> 44:37.120]  into the future it's not like deja vu where you think you've seen this before you talk about it
[44:37.120 --> 44:41.680]  you remember it's very upsetting those dreams are waking dreams is what i call them where you know
[44:41.680 --> 44:46.160]  it's real when i was a child i had them obviously more it's been marked throughout history that
[44:46.160 --> 44:51.360]  children are more more sensitive it's why the globals like to abuse and hurt them uh because
[44:51.360 --> 44:55.760]  you know the evil wants to feed on that but i mean i still have waking dreams and you always
[44:55.760 --> 44:59.760]  know on even if it's something good coming like most of us the most common waking dream is of
[44:59.760 --> 45:05.760]  your children unborn or a lot of times parents when their children will have dreams about their
[45:05.760 --> 45:14.720]  grandchildren that's very common my dad had dreams about my daughters and then only later went oh my
[45:14.720 --> 45:18.720]  god that was the little blonde haired girls i imagine that we're gonna be my children
[45:20.800 --> 45:25.280]  but it was exactly them that's the issue it was a little later he said oh my gosh that was that
[45:25.280 --> 45:29.280]  dream or because he told my mom about this when they first got married we're gonna have daughters
[45:29.280 --> 45:36.080]  i've seen these daughters they weren't his daughters they were his granddaughters and the enemy knows
[45:36.080 --> 45:39.760]  this that's why they don't want you to think there's anything else outside of what we can see
[45:39.760 --> 45:44.960]  we're like moles folks we're blind we have we have these five senses we don't have five senses we
[45:44.960 --> 45:51.520]  have six senses and beyond we're in the universe the the time space continuum flows directly
[45:51.520 --> 46:00.560]  through us we're like hollow our bodies are very thin we're just we're made of stardust we're made
[46:00.560 --> 46:08.880]  of the universe we've always been here it's it's unbelievable that's why i'm not worried about the
[46:08.880 --> 46:14.000]  new world order i laugh at them because they're so pathetic let's go ahead and take a call
[46:14.000 --> 46:21.600]  shall in florida you're on the air yes hi alex long time listener thank you for everything you've
[46:21.600 --> 46:26.400]  done you woke me up about six or seven years ago and i've just been listening to you every day for
[46:26.400 --> 46:34.560]  the past year i want to talk to you about the black box my friend showed me there's a commercial
[46:34.560 --> 46:40.800]  with progressive auto insurance and flow is promoting this little box that the um that you
[46:40.800 --> 46:45.120]  can put in your car yeah i don't know progressive's done that for 10 years they're paid by the feds
[46:45.840 --> 46:50.160]  as a beta test also in europe under another name i forget their european division name
[46:50.160 --> 46:55.120]  and what they do is you put the box in and they give you discounts but in the future you won't
[46:55.120 --> 46:59.600]  have a choice and then the box will track everything you do and give you wireless tickets
[46:59.600 --> 47:04.000]  and then that's all beneficially announced so now the same progressive box but more advanced
[47:04.000 --> 47:09.120]  is in all the new cars starting in 2011 and of course it was designed for that and we told people
[47:09.120 --> 47:12.960]  that they said that the government would never do that conspiracy theorist instead of getting
[47:12.960 --> 47:17.840]  together to beat it and say no that the yuppies with their knowledge you know because they live in
[47:17.840 --> 47:23.360]  a fantasy land they just told you know us that were liars they didn't oppose it so now it's going
[47:23.360 --> 47:27.840]  to begin and then the yuppies will say well we need highway money the highway department said
[47:27.840 --> 47:31.600]  they're bankrupt when the highway departments are making more money than they've ever made
[47:31.600 --> 47:37.360]  and on average over 75 percent of all tax money is sent and invested in offshore banks and then
[47:37.360 --> 47:42.000]  destroyed as derivatives you're like well why don't they take the money they have unlimited money
[47:42.000 --> 47:47.360]  the only way they get value in money is destroying your money the irs is not meant to pay off the
[47:47.360 --> 47:55.120]  national debt as reagan's commission showed in 81 100 of it is taken and put into the fiat
[47:55.120 --> 48:01.280]  debt on the money not the actual debt but on the interest on it to destroy you just like the
[48:01.280 --> 48:09.440]  communist manifesto says a progressive heavy income tax that is a carl marx deal and so it is a fact
[48:09.440 --> 48:16.160]  on record that it is to destroy us what's the italian or latin distruto is that right what's
[48:16.160 --> 48:22.720]  what's what's latin for destroyed they want to destroy you anything else sir yes one other thing
[48:22.720 --> 48:26.880]  i just want to tell you that i'm doing my part in Florida to wake people up i'm talking and having
[48:26.880 --> 48:32.400]  conversations with people and um it's really tough but i'm just doing my job and i'm finding these

[48:43.520 --> 48:47.600]  department i'm trying to guess what department and then he says department of homeland security
[48:47.600 --> 48:54.160]  she's she's observing people's behavior another girl i met at her she's she's uh she's a nsa got

[49:10.320 --> 49:17.040]  in data mining spying and yes we have conservatively five times the number of human spies on the
[49:17.040 --> 49:21.040]  ground all the kid toys are about spying they teach them spy on your parents in school for at

[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.480]  obama said you can have a cold power plant but we will bankrupt you it's impossible to lead
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.640]  smell that's why we import it all from china now and now they're going to control the importation

[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.920]  up to drive up the prices this is economic warfare max kaiser getting into money velocity
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.800]  and how bad it's going to get because it is starting to get out in the economy i see inflation
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.520]  everywhere it's really bad and the media says there's no inflation there's no inflation the
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:15.040]  dinosaur ecliptic rat decepticon media but how does that tie into not just a chase but other
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.680]  big banks are saying you can wire money in but not out of the country and you've got to get an
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.960]  approved special checking account and pay us you and you said this years ago if i get to the point
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:30.160]  before the inflation really got bad where your money will be like garbage you've got a pay to
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:36.720]  have taken away max kaiser well there's a couple of things there alex no first of all yep understand
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:44.080]  that although the inflation rate right now is high if you put into the calculation things like food
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:49.440]  and energy the inflation rates really six seven eight percent it's not the two or two and a half
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.160]  percent the government says the government lies about the real number of inflation because
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:58.880]  all of the entitlement programs are tied to the official inflation rate that being like social
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:04.640]  security so they're incentivized to under report that number that's why they always under report
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.440]  that number the real it's correct that the real inflation if you really add up the cost of what
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.960]  people actually buy the supermarket it's really six seven eight percent that's true but even though
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:20.560]  that's high there's another big factor going on which is that the shadow banking system which is
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.960]  the derivatives market which is seven hundred trillion dollars in size versus the global gdp
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.800]  of roughly sixty trillion dollars in size that is collapsing at faster than seven or eight percent
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:35.760]  a year it's collapsing at ten fifteen twenty percent a year the derivatives shadow banking
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:41.920]  system is collapsing and that's why these banks have to constantly be bailed out by the central
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:46.800]  banks who are constantly engaged in programs of quantitative easing because they're trying to keep
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:51.520]  what are called zombie banks alive and their reason they're zombie banks is because their
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:57.040]  balance sheets are collapsing faster than the economy can grow to generate the taxable income
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:02.160]  to pay off these debts now going forward because there is no velocity because there are some of
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:06.000]  these zombie banks because there is so much money just sitting there not doing anything because
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.920]  they're zombies you have countries like china that have accumulated up to four trillion dollars worth
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:17.920]  of money as a creditor nation including over a trillion dollars and dollars with nowhere to spend
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:25.440]  it until such time as they decide to get panic stricken because maybe the dollar finally starts
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:32.320]  to collapse in the wake of this obvious sign of no economic growth and they dump those dollars and
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:37.280]  other currencies onto the market in a classic hyperinflation where they want to spend them
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:44.480]  quickly before the value collapses then all this pent up hyperinflation that's been pent up and
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:50.960]  kind of off off the radar for 10 to 15 years all happens like a thunder clap at once that's what
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:57.280]  everyone needs to be prepared for because at that moment it'll be way too late is there any way to
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.840]  escape the y mar because the globalists admit and they're double speak that they're trying to have a
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:08.320]  depression to somehow black hole the inflation so they only have inflation and luxury goods and we
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:14.800]  see that no no no they say that there is deflation they say that there is a recession because they
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:22.400]  are constantly trying to convince people that they don't deserve to make a minimum wage or a
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:28.560]  livable wage they they people at mcdonald's and walmart look look look at how they promoted
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:32.880]  obama care the u.s. government that's right they're being subsidized by the u.s. government because
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:39.360]  they they they must always talk about the collapse of the inflation which they include wages as the
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.920]  reason why they need to keep printing money but that's a false statement they print the money to
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.400]  keep the zombie banks alive they don't care as i said before they don't care if people have jobs
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:53.040]  because they can just print money why would i care if i had a job exactly max thank you so much

[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:23.280]  dr. peter koznik is one of the most renowned historians and researchers out there period
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:29.120]  we're very honored to have him join us for the next 25 minutes or so he also worked with his
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.520]  book turning it into a 12-part series for television 10 parts on cable here in the united
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:40.160]  states for the untold history of the united states and he just had a piece in us today
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:47.120]  about american exceptionalism and we're going to get his take just on where america and the world is
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:53.200]  right now versus the different political histories that are out there and obviously we all see
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:58.560]  through rose colored glasses and and and history's too big and too deep to ever really know the
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:03.040]  truth of everything but we know there's a lot of different histories that are politicized out there
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:10.960]  versus what the real histories are and so he joins us dr. peter koznik thank you so much for coming
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:16.160]  on my pleasure alex wow i mean we could talk about a million different things but just studying
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:22.000]  history in its whole uh where would you say the world is today and where is america and the empire
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:29.120]  in that well there have been a lot of empires and what we know is that no empire lasts forever
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:38.640]  and the united states is in a similar position to all the previous empires empires cling to life
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:46.320]  in their dying stages the united states is not yet in its dying stages an empire but we're already
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:51.760]  retracting we're already seeing that we can't dominate the world in the ways that we used to
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:58.720]  be able to you see america's declining influence in the middle east america's declining influence
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:04.160]  in latin america you know that this does not necessarily have to be a bad thing for the american
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:11.120]  people being the world's policeman has not been in america's interest even from military standpoint
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:18.080]  our victories have been minor yeah we we succeeded in defeating several uh dozen cuban construction
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:24.160]  workers in granada and reagan says america is back again standing proud but we haven't had a very
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:30.880]  good track record the korean war was a standoff uh vietnam was a disaster we got our budget kicked
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:38.480]  in vietnam uh the kuey uh he could say was uh somewhat of a success uh but uh there again
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:49.200]  they were lied into that war the first time uh afghanistan iraq even uh libya i mean what has
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:55.440]  our militarism got us okay we've got 700 to a thousand bases around the world we are by far the
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:00.080]  strongest nation in the world we spend almost as much on our military as the rest of the world
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:04.640]  combined if we factor in our intelligence uh for a while we were spending as much as the rest of
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:10.880]  the world combined so we've militarized the planet and we're looking for military solutions
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:16.080]  but we've seen over and over again that military solutions don't really work so what oliver stone
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:21.920]  and i have tried to do with our project is show the dark side of american history we acknowledge
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:26.160]  that the united states have done a lot of great things but what what we don't think we'd learn
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:31.200]  the lessons from that but we the lessons which we want to teach we think that are most essential
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:36.000]  for people to learn are the lessons from the mistakes that we've made and americans have not
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.840]  been good at reflecting and one of the problems is americans don't know their history the national
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:48.400]  report card that was issued in june of 2011 reported that american high school seniors
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:55.120]  came in worst in u.s history than they did any other subject in fact they are worse than in their
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:59.440]  understanding of u.s history than they are in math and science we're always demoting the fact that
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.040]  our students are so inept in math and science compared to the rest of the world well the
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:08.000]  students came in worse in u.s history 12 percent of american high school seniors were judged to be
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:14.640]  proficient in u.s history of that 12 percent only 2 percent of high school seniors could actually
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:19.920]  identify the problem that brown versus board of education was trying to address even though the
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:24.880]  answer was obvious from the way the question itself was worded so we've got a lot of problems
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:31.280]  that we have to deal with intellectually educationally and politically well i've seen some of the
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.960]  episodes they're they're really a thought-provoking and try to give some depth not just black or white
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:42.400]  i see america becoming an empire really around the time kennedy's killed and a lot of historians
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:47.840]  agree with me on that i want to see if you agree i mean it's hard to pick a point but america has
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:54.640]  lost its superpower status and is now seen as a super tyranny because uh all these corporate
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:13:00.560]  interests they're winning off the profits they're winning off of the no bid contracts but america
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:07.040]  is being destroyed our name our treasure everything in the process and then putin came out and said
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.480]  you know you're not just exceptional because you say you are i see america has been exceptional
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:18.240]  in many ways with inventions and trailblazing but also exceptional in in in darkness as well
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:22.720]  uh and i think you always see that yin and yang i mean i would say america has been exceptional
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:30.800]  in many ways but now we're exceptionally unhealthy exceptionally evil uh and exceptionally arrogant
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:35.920]  and i think it's good for us to not be so arrogant and uh what is your take on american
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.080]  exceptionalism because i know you wrote a big piece uh that i was able to read part of uh on it
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:46.080]  i saw synopsis another paper i had a piece on american exceptionalism in us today a few days ago
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:54.640]  and we started by saying uh thanking latimer putin for uh not just chastising for a brock
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:59.680]  obama for invoking american exceptionalism to justify a unilateral military strike against
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:05.040]  syria but for offering a solution so the united states didn't have to follow through on on on
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:12.640]  that promise uh but we we argued that what putin did was was right his timing was bad
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:18.400]  we had wished that he'd waited another week till both the houses of congress had repudiated
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.200]  a military strike cruise missile strike against syria because we thought that that would have
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:28.320]  sent the real message uh about where the united america people want to be right now they were
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:33.760]  overwhelmingly opposed to a military strike and would have been a tremendous victory for the
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:39.280]  anti-war movement probably the biggest victory in decades but this idea of exceptionalism
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:45.440]  is so deeply ingrained it's become part of the air that americans breathe it goes back to jonathan
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:51.440]  winthrop and his sermon aboard the arbella in 1630 in massachusetts bay when it started
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:57.840]  massachusetts bay colony it says we shall be like a city upon a hill that the rest of the world will
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:04.240]  be upon us we'll set the example for the world woodrow wilson says after the ever side tree conference
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:11.680]  he says uh now at last the world knows america as the savior of the world this idea so deeply
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:20.480]  ingrained we see it over and over again uh in the especially it takes off in a big way in the 1980s
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:25.680]  of ronald reagan at the same time he's supporting death squads in central america supporting the
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:32.240]  mujahideen the islamic extremists in pakistan and afghanistan he's going around crowing about
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:38.000]  mourning again in america and that america is god's gift to humanity we see it in manila all
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.240]  bright who uh as secretary of state says if we have to use force it's because we're america
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:48.800]  we're the indispensable nation hillary clinton saying the same thing we're the indispensable
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:54.480]  nation we stand for peace and progress and prosperity while at the same time she's
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:59.200]  authorizing the invasion of iraq supporting expansion that's what i mean as you know you're
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.880]  going through the history but i mean we've had john carrey secretary of state now obama
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:08.400]  saying hey we're america we've got to go in there and do this when american and globalist interest
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:14.720]  started the civil war they put al qaeda in there it's all on record uh the al qaeda a lot of evidence
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:20.320]  behind the chemical attacks and then carrie gets up and says we're exceptional we've got to go save
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:26.560]  the day when it's clearly a war crime i mean i've never seen america so on the wrong side
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:31.600]  so openly and again i'm not a fan of Assad but compared to al qaeda i am i mean is there
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:36.480]  it's almost a mental illness in the elite do you think they're smoking their own propaganda their
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:42.160]  own dope it's an interesting comment because i have stolen the great independent journalist
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:47.600]  used to go to schools of journalism they would tell the students if you want to be a journalist
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:54.960]  you have to remember two words government's lie but he said at one point that governments lie
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:17:00.640]  but the americans smoke the same hashish they pass out and it's possible that these people
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:05.920]  actually believe it although i think obama is too smart and carrie was once too smart
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.960]  he was one of the founders one of the leaders of the vietnam veterans against the war it comes from a
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:17.360]  much more thoughtful intelligent position and to rely on this kind of militarism so these people
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:22.800]  once had some sense of integrity i don't know about hillary clinton if she ever had that kind of
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:28.080]  sense of jesus so hawkish people don't think of it i think of her but that's exactly but that that's
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.960]  what makes them such effective judiz goes and obama i've heard it said that he's on a lesser
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:38.560]  of two evils he's a more effective of evils imagine if george w bush was still in office
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.440]  got a magical third fourth term could he have gotten away with anything that obama's done
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:49.680]  well arie fleischer uh bush's press secretary said that this is bush's fourth term i agree with
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:55.840]  that and in some ways obama is different obama did resist the invade the attack on sirio for a
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:01.360]  long time before he came in part of his problem is that he doesn't have a backbone he doesn't seem
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:07.600]  to have a moral core where john f kennedy could stand up to the military he knew what they were
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:12.560]  he knew what they were doing and he resisted them time after time and you saw what happened to him
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:17.680]  well that's part of the message maybe you know we don't know why obama has turned into
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:23.280]  the opposite of what people hope he was going to be in so many ways in terms of his domestic policy
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:30.080]  is his surveillance his overall militarism and this is not the guy who deserved a nobel peace
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:36.880]  prize of course this is the obama who was lectured by malala that's 16 year old pakistani girl who
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:44.000]  was shot in the head by the taliban uh she she she said that your drone policy is is wrong
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.880]  that you're killing innocent people you're creating more enemies 16 year old girl who should have
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:55.440]  gotten a nobel peace prize perhaps uh was lecturing the nobel laureate himself has the
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:01.280]  nobel prize giving him to people like henry kissinger and now obama made itself into a joke
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.600]  well tom learer who was the great political satyrist of the 1950s and 60s harvard mass
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:12.320]  professor brilliant said that he gave up he stopped performing when kissing you got the
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:19.200]  nobel peace prize he said uh political satire has become obsolete what henry kissinger got the
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:25.360]  nobel peace prize and and he's right about that uh being kissinger of course should be in the talk
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:33.200]  at that bank you know it he's uh i mean this is a man whose war crimes his long list of war
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:38.640]  crimes you know shei vietnam the list is just endless right back in the dash uh she you know
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:44.560]  actually is just saying uh cambodia louse and one of the points that i make we're about to be

[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:52.720]  up with vietnam then i want to ask you about the death of empires at the end i finish up your vietnam
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:25:02.720]  point yeah it was very disconcerting to read recently a recent gallup poll found that 51
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:10.880]  percent of americans between the ages of 18 and 29 think that the vietnam war was not a mistake
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:15.280]  the older people think it was a terrible mistake but the young kids are not even learning
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:22.880]  about vietnam anymore and they think it wasn't a mistake 51 percent um martin lucy king said
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:29.280]  that uh if america's soul becomes totally poisoned part of the autopsy must read vietnam i think a
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:35.920]  big part of it must read vietnam uh and obama has announced recently a 13-year commemoration of the
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:42.640]  vietnam war honoring the americans who has fought heroically to protect the ideals we hold the earth
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:48.240]  americans well if you look at vietnam you wonder what ideals is he talking about robin maximara
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:53.680]  secretary of defense who was the architect of that war told my students a few years right before
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:59.840]  his death that he believed that 3.8 million vietnamese died in the war when i asked students
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:05.120]  how many americans died in the war some of them know the 58 thousand number when i asked them
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:10.560]  how many vietnamese died in the war just did it a couple weeks ago with honor students and the
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:19.760]  guess is raised from 300 000 to 1.3 million well 3.8 million according to maximara uh and and then
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:24.480]  i asked them how many jews died in the holocaust every hand goes up they all know the six million
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:31.200]  figure i think that says something about american education how would we feel if german kids today
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.360]  thought that a half million to a million jews died in the holocaust we'd be horrified
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:40.960]  at the education system in germany but the german kids know the truth the americans have no idea
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:47.760]  about the atrocities the outrage is committed by their own government uh what i'd like to point out
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:56.320]  is that the vietnam wall now the vietnam memorial wall has a name of 58 272 americans who died in
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:01.680]  the war the message of that wall is that the tragedy of vietnam is that 58 thousand americans
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:08.400]  died that is a tragedy but if that wall contained the names not only of the americans but also the
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:15.520]  vietnamese the cambodians the leotians the other the the brits all everybody who died in that war
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:22.640]  it would be over four miles long it's 146 feet long well it shows it shows the wall would send
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:28.080]  the message that we need to send about about what that war was about and it would also
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:35.360]  represent a fitting tombstone to the american empire i agree with you so so so so when do we
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:40.160]  really become a full-fledged empire not just in our in uh not just in the americas but all
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:44.240]  over the world when when does the military industrial complex really take over i'd say
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:48.080]  three years after eisenhower left office and warned us it's when they kill kennedy do you
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:54.560]  agree with that statement uh yes and no uh we traced it back to the 1898 to the spanish-american
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:59.520]  war sure but the united states starts to become a global empire when the united states becomes
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:05.040]  a counter-revolutionary force in the philippines we before that supported reform and revolution
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.280]  then we go in there we oh we over throw the aguinaldo government we overthrow the popular
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:15.280]  forces we impose a dictatorship we set up a colony there and then we begin to intervene over and over
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.880]  sure doc we're almost out of time i would agree with you i think it is william mckinley's navy
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:23.840]  in 1898 and the stage main clearly staged i certainly use you supply the pictures i'll
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:29.120]  supply the war and then you've got uh another stage deal with the gulf of tonkin 1964 we've only
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:34.400]  got about a bombings and irish him in nagasaki at the start of the cold war with truman truman
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:39.200]  wasn't in office for 10 days before he reversed roosevelt's policies toward the soviet union
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:45.840]  less than 10 days amazing just to keep the war machine going uh enclosing the american empire
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:50.560]  is there a way to extricate out of it without going through the evil degeneration cycle where
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:54.560]  they always become so authoritarian at home well it's becoming authoritarian look at what's
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:29:01.120]  happening with the surveillance state that we see now um it's not easy to roll back powers not easy
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:06.960]  to roll back empires but the united states still is in a position where it can learn and begin to
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:12.480]  reach out on syria we said for example if you want to bring in the the so the russians to get
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:17.280]  them to cooperate on syria roll back on the missile defense that they hate roll back on the
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:22.000]  weaponization of space that they hate roll back on the expansion of nato to their doorstep if you
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.800]  want to bring china in to collaborate with us to cooperate with us let's just pull back this asia
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:32.320]  pivot that obama and clinton have announced where we're militarizing the pacific in the same way to
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:36.960]  contain china like we tried to contain russia that could be a way to have peace and not have

[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:40.000]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:52.320]  well i've got articles here where folks putting out anti corrupt homeland security shirts that
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:34:00.640]  say homeland stupidity are being threatened by the nsa and dhs he's fighting back with a lawsuit
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:06.560]  free speech t-shirt maker threatened by nsa dhs fights back with lawsuit that is so criminal
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:11.840]  when parody is 100 covered the nsa the only part of government that actually listens
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.520]  and they're trying to claim you can't use our logo government logos folks are the most widely
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:22.560]  open to be used items they try to threaten people with criminal charges saying that you're
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:28.800]  impersonating a criminal nsa person engaging in and and fraud and criminal activity no we're
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:34.560]  exposing your fraud and criminal activity of your narcotics child trafficking murdering bosses
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:39.040]  we know who you are and by the way it's that spirit of knowing who the globalist star that's
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:44.240]  going to bring them down because we call this the american empire this is the globalist using
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:50.160]  america to build and fund their empire at our expense that's why i want this empire to go away
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:56.000]  and i don't mean just go away like fall apart i mean have our money our tax dollars kept here
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.880]  to create the ingenuity and the trailblazing and the inventiveness that was american exceptionalism
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:09.280]  when we did until 100 years ago promote revolutions in countries for real liberty america used to do
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:13.040]  that we didn't go around meddling but we'd support groups that were promoting freedom
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:19.600]  now it's the opposite let's put al-qaeda in charge of libya syria and al-qaeda light in charge of
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:27.120]  in charge of places like egypt and you know you hear that professor who's a smart guy
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:31.120]  and comes from kind of a liberal perspective but a real liberal perspective he'll at least
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:35.680]  criticize obama we need to reach out to those people because i'm not a conservative or a liberal
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:41.680]  i'm a freedom lover i'm a truth lover i'm a justice lover people didn't over 150 years ago
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:47.120]  they didn't say left or right that meant male or female wicked not wicked that's sinister
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:52.000]  non sinister sinister means your left hand like you have a sword fight he holds his sword sinister
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:57.360]  the point is is it was all about is that more freedom or is that less freedom is that more
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:01.200]  fair is that less fair that's what you judge everything by not
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:07.360]  it's something to surface is that person black is that person white is that person from the
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:10.800]  south is that person from the north is that person a christian is that person a jew
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:15.680]  is that person an agnostic you have to judge people by the character of their deeds what
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:18.640]  they do what they stand for that's what marlon leuther king said i agree with that
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:24.000]  look at the so-called liberals of today they're the opposite a brown bag is racist
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.840]  and then you comply with that well now just being a cowboy is racist
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:35.840]  wearing a cowboy hat's racist cover that red neck up you've been outside as racist
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:43.360]  everything becomes racist it's just a war on reality and they know it's asinine they know it's
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:48.720]  crazy to arrest a woman that shoots her boyfriend with a water gun they know it's crazy to arrest a
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:55.600]  kid in the backyard with an airsoft you know nerf type gun with friends they say well comply with
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:00.240]  the officers they feel that it was threatening that you had a gun at your neighbor saw you guys
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:04.560]  shooting at a target with airsoft and it was an orange gun doesn't matter we're going to go ahead
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:10.240]  and then the probation officer comes in and says we're not going to charge you with menacing but
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:16.720]  go ahead and go on probation and then you sign with the judge they have just engaged in a mass
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:22.800]  fraud to violate your civil and god-given rights just like when they lie and say well we kicked
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:26.000]  you out of school for a week and then charge you with truancy because you weren't inoculated
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:31.760]  we're going to drop the criminal charges of truancy if you take the shots they kicked you out of
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:37.600]  school the penal code in every state states that you're then not truant if they've kicked you out
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:43.840]  of the school they're all in a criminal operation they've got to get 97.3 last time i checked
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:51.280]  of the school inoculated or they don't get about a third of the money you know the states don't get
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:58.960]  any cps money unless they increase last time i checked it varies clinton got this in in 97
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:04.480]  10 more kids grabbed each year that's why it was a couple hundred thousand under clinton
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:09.920]  it's over a million and a half kids they grab each year now and it's only going to grow it's
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:15.920]  designed to erect everybody you can look at these actuaries look at these setup plans and know it's
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.080]  for total destruction of the family but i don't even need to go look at that they openly say the
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:29.680]  family's bad they openly badmouth anything was good man i don't care if you're black white
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:36.160]  hispanic a christian not a christian whatever i don't want you to be manipulated and lied to
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:41.280]  because if they can do that they can turn you into an army of livings to run me and my family over
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:46.720]  i want my children to grow up in a world with other good successful people i want to have a
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:53.840]  future i have empathy but i see the public with their death culture obsession their zombie obsession
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:59.600]  their murder obsession their gangster obsession their fake tough guy obsession really being
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.560]  desensitized everything and man i tell you in the general public i've never seen so much corruption
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:10.240]  i've never seen so much backstabbing i've never seen so much lying i've never seen people
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:17.040]  do so much wrong to each other and then make excuses for it i've never seen common sense so
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:24.240]  in trouble and it's going to get a lot worse folks i see it in life i see it in business i see it
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:32.080]  in media i see and i and i always realized the good feel humble and like pathetic if we stand
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:36.960]  up and try to lead and so we just stand back and let the arrogant control freaks run things
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:42.560]  it's time for those of us that love justice to really stand up those of us that have done the
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:47.200]  research those of us that have the facts those of us that really care those of us that have common
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:53.920]  sense it is our duty but that duty is the animating contest of liberty that jefferson talked about it
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:40:00.720]  is it is the struggle and we're taught to like give in like give you compromise but they never
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:07.280]  compromise compromising means we give in to them they're not compromising the collective the dumb
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:13.600]  down mass the uh the you know low IQ chemically dumb down people that that will aggressively
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:17.840]  laugh at you if you try to wake them up it's pathetic i want to go to your phone calls in
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:24.800]  the news we haven't hit but this is such a big deal um gigi urnetta and and and and david night
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:29.440]  and others that are here today and jacari and folks were just really freaking out this morning
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:35.440]  when they went over uh this uh article that's on drug report dot com we have our own article
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:43.600]  up on info wars dot com um but uh this this this 2003 federal communications commission
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:47.840]  where they basically twist arms and threaten and tell people you got to answer these questions
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:51.360]  it's what's your political views what do you do how much time do you give to this how much time
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:56.880]  do you give that what the daily caller doesn't get and what we have in curtain emos article
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:01.120]  i'm not saying that to differentiate myself i could care less i've wished there were people
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:05.040]  out there that knew more than we did it's pretty scary to be rag tag and be the about the best
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:10.400]  there is but the point is our article breaks down it is the fairness doctrine back i mean if
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:15.120]  you know what it is it's back and uh curtain emo breaks it down in an excellent article let's see
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:21.120]  see prepares fairness doctrine for the internet and if you scroll down we have a screenshot to
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:24.720]  the document and then a link where you can go through to it and cast sunstein talking about
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:29.840]  how they would use the the secret police now come and just say it's a mandatory survey
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:35.680]  just like they have police on the highways under federal funds who take blood
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:40.320]  and stuff but they say oh it's a research project you don't have to but you better
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:44.160]  and then the feds then then after they do that for a while then they fund blood draws and lie
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:48.320]  and say oh it's a real warrant when it's not they want in your body folks they want to put
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:53.840]  their hands on you nothing to do with drinking beer okay and now they are going to go through and
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:42:00.960]  say what is the news philosophy of the station who else in your market provides news who are your
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:08.640]  main competitors how much news is your station air every day and and again i get these i i got
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:14.000]  these under the the the business census this year you're like but it's 2013 you're not people the
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.080]  ignorant public goes you only get it every 10 years i i know no no i get threatened by the
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:27.360]  department of labor when that's not even the group over the census with arrest folks if i don't
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:31.840]  tell them stuff i don't even know what's the total profit on this what you do on that what
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:36.640]  have you amortized i mean it would be it would be $50,000 a year of accounting we we had the
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:40.160]  accountant look at it to answer those questions properly and if i didn't answer them properly
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:45.440]  i would be lying on a federal document then they would have me i can't fill this thing out it's
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:50.880]  like but that's it's like i can't even i don't even mess with my own life with my i'm not sitting
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:56.800]  here counting you know coins or something i'm busy trying to cover the news and and and then
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:02.400]  they lie on the forum and say it's the law we will find you or arrest you and i know the law i
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:07.680]  know the federal rulings i know what the census is the census isn't do you own firearms do you
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:13.760]  have a low flush toilet how many of your employees are minority it's all just stuff to put in a
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:21.840]  database for targeting who are your board of directors blah blah blah there is no board of
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:30.320]  directors it's me but it just goes on and on and on and on and now how much does community input
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:35.520]  influence news coverage decisions this is to get you to report and where they can admit and say you

[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:32.800]  you're like a sheep coming up to the big pack of wolves and you think if you come up to them and
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:38.160]  curl up next to them that the starving ravenous wolves are going to give you a kissy time they're
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:42.880]  not going to give you kissy time and you can sit there and watch sheep being torn apart in front
[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:48.000]  of you wolves sometimes will just kill like 1015 sheep are fine just you know and just running
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.560]  around ripping their guts out running with their intestine 20 feet literally you look at films of
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:58.560]  it online and and and other sheep will just roll over and go uh that's why you call cowards that
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:06.240]  won't resist sheep because they roll over and go uh and just you know help me uh and and that's
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:11.280]  people think they do that they go oh no historically big giant governments in black uniforms saying
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:15.440]  that they'll arrest christians and and that the family isn't good that's not soviet union or
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:24.560]  nazi germany no no they'll know that's liberal trendy i mean it's pathetic pathetic and i'm
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:29.120]  starting to flip out because it gets crazier every day as these people think they're in total control
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:34.560]  they just run around and meeting all their crimes and then people you go well is it wrong you can't
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:41.520]  pack your kids lunch i mean is it wrong that it just goes on and on and on the any justification
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:49.760]  people can do for the system this is not what made this country great okay america has had
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:56.000]  exceptionalism compared to all the other places undoubtedly get stuff like beat the biggest empire
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:01.920]  of the world that ever seen that nobody beaten i mean britain beat napoleon a few years ago a few
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:09.520]  years after we beat them after we beat the british and again folks is because we had right on our side
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:14.880]  and we didn't back off and that's why you got to learn to just know that they're the enemy commit
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:20.080]  and not care what they say just discredit them savage them and be confident because the sheep
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:24.320]  are looking for confidence folks they see confidence in the wolves they don't have confidence in
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:28.720]  themselves that they could run from the walls and so they just roll over spread their legs that's
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:33.920]  what sheep do they see a wolf they just roll over open their legs and think if i let you rip my guts
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:39.440]  out you'll eat me slower and because they want to be eaten slower i mean for whatever reason i don't
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:44.240]  understand it um that's why a lot of books call themselves a sheepdog you're not a wolf you're
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:49.840]  not a sheep and the sheepdog you ever seen footage you can look them up online of sheepdogs tearing
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:55.120]  into wolves and see we're supposed to be sheep dogs folks not sheep and we're not supposed to raise a
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:59.680]  nation of sheep everything they do is to raise a nation of sheep we're going to go into overdrive

[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:40.800]  doing that they force companies to do outside law but with threats uh to answer questions about
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:45.680]  their politics and see that's what they said 15 years ago that the census was then going to be
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:52.000]  back in like 1998 they were already preparing the 2000 census and they admitted that this is how the
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:58.080]  stasi will come oh it's a survey notice that's how thieves knock on your door too overselling
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:02.560]  newspapers we're selling magazines oh we've got a good deal for you we're selling speaker systems

[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:10.960]  shove a gun in your face and come in and well tie you up and kill you and you know even though it
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:15.040]  creates a murder investigation a lot of times they just like to kill you and the globalists are
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:19.280]  like that too i mean it's a big thrill for them and then no one's run them to ground no one stood
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:24.480]  up to them show they're in a big giant spoiled rotten operation like like kids if you have bad
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:28.960]  kids love to uh do whatever they wanted pretty soon they'd probably be killing people it's kind
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:32.480]  of like if you've got enough employees a lot of them are good a lot of them are bad you don't
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:36.960]  monitor people you don't see what they're doing you don't give them goals they will literally every
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:42.000]  time shut up and then tell you that they are your boss and make up some reason that they're your boss
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:47.200]  and you're a bad person and the globalists also do that they always demonize it's just human nature
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:51.760]  corrupt human nature they always demonize whoever they're abusing or whoever they're dominating
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:57.200]  so that it's okay for them to feel like they're doing that well i declare my resistance to all
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:04.080]  control freaks and scum i see you you're pathetic and you will be defeated uh let's go to zack in
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:09.920]  new hampshire ahead of max kaiser joining us jack you're on the air welcome sir hey alex i just like
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:13.680]  to say i'm a big fan of your show thank you so much for everything you do you're really doing
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:18.320]  god's work and you really helped to wake up me and my family i just like to run a few things by you
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:22.480]  and see what you think about them but i might do a lot of research i'm like the paranormal and
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:27.280]  i've had paranormal experiences and you know seeing you oppose the photograph things and the research
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:31.360]  i've done is it's all occultic and it's all demonic i just like to know what you think about that
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:37.360]  well look just from a scientific perspective the elite throughout history and especially in modern
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:42.080]  times you think it would be less are obsessed with the occult and believe they're deriving their power
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:50.880]  from the occult i mean both george bush his dad um so many others like uh john carrey believe
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:57.600]  that they are possessed by dark angels and that that's where they get their power at skull and
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:03.360]  bones i mean their own documents have been leaked that's mainstream news back in the 80s it got leaked
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:09.840]  by charlotte israbi whose father and uh i guess grandfather were in it uh but more has been
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:15.200]  leaked and it's now been abc news is confirmed these are people who believe they are channeling
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:19.920]  entities so regardless whether because atheists will say i don't believe in any of that and say i'm a
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:24.560]  kook well it'd be like if i said pick me's worship the snake god or whatever i don't worship the snake
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:31.920]  god i'm reporting on the anthropology the sociology of those people the globalist worship blood
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:37.040]  death and hurting children and that's that that's their most popular cult they've got some other
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:42.960]  cults i mean you can get in a cult if you'll just go along with them and stuff but uh you don't get
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:49.200]  to the higher levels unless you like to torture children to death but go ahead so you'd agree
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:54.560]  that like things like ghosts and aliens and UFOs and even like bigfoot like it's all a cultic and
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:58.640]  like you know you know i mean a lot of bigfoot is guys dressing up in in gorilla outfits so
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:06.560]  they can sell a a film for you know $50,000 and that's a guy in a gorilla suit um have there been

[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:39.360]  ladies and gentlemen we are now into our number two and there's an article out by
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:46.880]  the daily caller it's up on info wars dot com right now fcc to police news media question
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:52.560]  reporters in wide ranging content survey and this is how they send out the secret police now
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:56.800]  you've got at least 10 democratic senators calling for a return to the fairness doctrine
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:02.320]  where you cannot give any of your views you can't say i think it's illegal that the nsa spying on
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:07.280]  us without warrants you have to just report what the government said that it's loving and then it's
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:12.080]  you know like diane feinstein says it's not surveillance to be illegally spied on that's a quote
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:19.600]  that it's not surveillance that it's a wonderful thing that they're doing for you and that you
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:26.720]  should be just absolutely amazingly thankful well now they say that's not allowed and actually went
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:36.080]  into the 2013 report here and the and the really meaty stuff starts on page 20 23 and they're
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:40.800]  going to make sure that you're you know be politically correct and putting you in a database
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:46.160]  and so this creates the database and a survey of everyone's political views and what you're saying
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:50.000]  and what you're doing and then they come around now with the different federal departments to
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.960]  businesses they send us these things every few months now the general public is well i don't
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:58.960]  get those because you're not a what they call a business they send me these things saying
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.920]  you know who you're corporate directors how much money do you make what's the stocks and bonds do
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:08.480]  you have firearms what are your other businesses under penalty of law you will tell us department
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:15.360]  of commerce they have no authority the census is for the apportionment of members of congress for
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:21.360]  your state and it goes back to Leviticus and the numbering of the people with moses that that's
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:25.600]  where it biblically comes from and that's in the law how many people live here that's it
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:31.360]  but they use a code through criminal fraud and tell you oh there's a code on this you better do it
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:36.160]  and i send it back to them and say fourth and fifth amendment you know full well this is fraud
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:39.520]  and they keep sending it and keep threatening and keep threatening criminal penalties and of
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:46.080]  course there really aren't any it's all fraud it's all fraud it's all a criminal group just like
[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:50.560]  they tell you it's the law that you've got to take vaccines to be in school there is no law to go
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:54.880]  to college to go anywhere and and and they have their fraudulent admissions to get into college
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:58.480]  to make you take all these shots and then say well we have to protect others if they've all taken
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:03.040]  the poison they should be just fine this is a government caught on record thousands of times
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:08.560]  killing people in secret test why would you ever trust the government run by the foreign banks
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:13.520]  that created Adolf Hitler our government the reason they took 30 plus thousand nazi scientists
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:19.040]  is that in a world war two back to the u.s and england they were coming home the nirenberg defense
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:28.320]  used for the eugenics and the mass extermination of millions was u.s cold springs harbour IBM
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:35.280]  directives IBM ran the extermination operations they were commanding it from the united states
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:38.800]  daring it that's why up until the end of the war they would say conspiracy theories
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:42.800]  hitler doesn't have death camps that's why they have the conspiracy theory today that
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:47.760]  hitler didn't have death camps people think that's some new thing no hitler had death camps and they
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:57.280]  killed all sorts of people folks so you better learn about all of this IBM directed the entire
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:05.200]  operation and IBM directs microsoft and IBM directs google today to get around antitrust
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:09.040]  that's why they created all these groups and of course i told you that 15 plus years ago it's
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:13.760]  now come out in the news it's all fake they've got attack barges with their surveillance grids off

[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:45.760]  offshore to destroy the money it doesn't go to even rich people they they have the income tax
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:51.200]  congressional report 81 is to destroy you selectively so they don't pay taxes and then your money's
[02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:58.400]  destroyed you understand that so that quote their money doesn't lose value see it's about
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:02.800]  artificial scarcity where they have hyperinflation where they get first use of the money and then
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:09.360]  and then all the benefits to them and then all the problems are to you it's all scientific gang

[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:37.680]  how scientific this takeover is in their own words uh if this was a football game where's free
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:42.640]  humanity on the board versus the corporate psycho guild who compete with each other on
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:48.880]  how evil they can be uh where is humanity right now max keiser hey alex how's it going you know
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:54.480]  i'm gonna be uh trying to get down to austin to see you in january i'm on down yeah i'm looking
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:15:00.800]  forward to that trip but um listening to you talk right there there's a couple of ideas that i have
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:05.840]  one is called digital apartheid the other one is called interest rate apartheid so let's talk
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:12.160]  about digital apartheid for a second as it relates to obama care if you notice uh over the past few
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:19.440]  years we have been uh exposed via the snowden revelations to an unbelievably sophisticated
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:26.400]  digital infrastructure for spying that seems to work flawlessly we also have been given obama
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:32.080]  care which is a digital product that's a shambles and this is the digital apartheid if you live on
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:38.080]  the right side of the digital apartheid wall you have access to flawless technology to spy to
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:44.560]  commit corporate espionage to commit all kinds of uh insider trading if you live on the wrong side
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:48.800]  of the digital apartheid wall you end up with obama care which is like a ghetto which like a
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:53.760]  slump and that's how they've always done it red tapes for the little guy not for the globalist
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:16:00.000]  this is literally like that stuff cops have they can shoot that's like goo to tie you down well you
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:06.160]  know red tape is uh bureaucracy has always been around and it slows things down and there's the
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:13.600]  state behind it and the state hires a lot of employees and there's um too much state uh payroll
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:19.760]  that gets into in the way of building a vibrant economy but this is more insidious than that this
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:25.520]  is a program of what i call digital apartheid where the program is to create two classes of
[02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:31.520]  individuals of have and have not sooner than there's interest rate apartheid which is i've been
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:36.000]  i've talked about this on your show before if you are on the right side of the interest rate
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.640]  apartheid wall you're a partner at goldman sacks or you're a partner at one of these big firms
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:46.320]  you can borrow money at zero percent but if you live on the wrong side of the apartheid wall
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:52.880]  you end up paying 16 percent 20 percent 30 percent or a payday loan here in the uk they have a payday
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:58.560]  loan shop called the wanga that charges an annualized rate of interest of 5 000 percent
[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:05.760]  uh and these people that run the wanga interest payday loan shop are some of the biggest contributors
[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:10.400]  to the conservative government the cameron government so here you have the government
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:19.040]  supporting a company that charges 5 000 percent against a payday loan uh to encourage the creation
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:26.960]  of this ghetto where people don't have access to capital anywhere near at the rate that if the friends
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:32.320]  of cameron but i mean let's go back to the goldman sacks and jp morgan others they're allowed to not
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:39.280]  just have zero percent they're able to create tens of trillions a month in fake garbage counterfeit
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:45.040]  derivatives and then have government bail those out giving them actual value so that's that's always
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:49.440]  the plan but briefly going back to your let me follow up on let me follow up on that a little bit
[02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:59.520]  because um we live now in an interesting world where in the uk or in the united states the
[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:08.800]  growth of the economy is not needed to support the economy you don't need workers in the uk you
[02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:15.520]  don't need workers in america you don't need their tax revenues because the insiders when they need
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:20.640]  money they just print it they just use the either the federal reserve bank or the bank of england
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:26.560]  to print all the money they want it's like saudi arabia saudi arabia you have a ruling elite and
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:31.520]  then you have the vast majority live in abject poverty because the ruling elite whenever they
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:35.920]  need more money they just turn on the oil tap they just they're part of opec and they just drill for
[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:40.880]  more oil but they don't need the population the population might get a bit of a stipend but there's
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:46.080]  a huge gap between the princes and the rest of the population in america it's turning into the same
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:51.840]  thing because you've got the princes on wall street who can just go to the fed and get all the money
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:57.520]  they want virtually an unlimited amount of money at zero percent interest rate so that they don't
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:02.160]  need they don't need workers they don't need your tax revenue they don't need you you're expendable
[02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:07.280]  beautifully said beautifully said we're about to go to break but then meanwhile msnbc and cnn
[02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:12.240]  they're all debating all the racial division to keep us fighting with each other as we're
[02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:18.560]  all being abused by the foreign offshore above the law tax exempt mega banks and the insurance
[02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:23.120]  companies making record profits on the obama care that they wrote when we come back i want to
[02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:29.680]  you to elaborate on uh this genius way you put this max geyser because it really is something
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:33.760]  people can crystallize and understand this is the ultimate discrimination the ultimate
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:39.200]  tax debt slavery but i want to go back to the first apartheid the digital because they said that
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:43.840]  going back about 18 years ago when they set up internet to consortium that they're going to kill
[02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:50.400]  the old web surveillance tax and control it but create their super private web for the top corporations
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:53.680]  and governments and that's now what they're setting up stay with us we'll be right back

[02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:39.120]  was jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater
[02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:42.960]  menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army ted anderson on placing a free silver

[02:24:02.640 --> 02:24:06.480]  folks if you've been sitting it out and not fighting the tyrants and not getting involved
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:12.000]  you are under scientific attack and you should take that personal i'll guarantee if i walked up to an
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:17.040]  average guy that doesn't even think of himself as a tough guy and slapped his wife right across the
[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:23.120]  face he'd get up and fight me i guarantee if i walked up to just a regular 150 pound you know
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:27.760]  guy that thinks he's a wimp started punching his five-year-old son in the face he'd get up and fight
[02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:34.480]  me if your neighbor came over every day and had their dog go to the bathroom and right in front of
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:41.760]  you'd come out and say hey quit doing that bob but the globalist do all these horrible things
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:47.360]  to us i mean they are openly under the federal government teaching two plus two equals five
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:51.360]  in common core you're not allowed to say mother and father that's hurtful russle brand's been
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:56.800]  told by salon that it's it's it's hateful to women to say that he thought a woman was beautiful
[02:24:56.800 --> 02:25:02.960]  it's a war on reality these are not liberals they're authoritarians and they work with the fake
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:07.360]  right wing people as well that's why the republican leadership's coming out to the tea party right now
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:12.560]  the real ron paul tea party folks not the co-opted one that carl rove tried to take over
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:18.640]  he failed but look at the school test teaches kids commands of government officials must be
[02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:23.520]  obeyed by all i forgot to call 590 our local affiliate and get it about a month ago i got
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:26.720]  to get this back i want you guys to call him from the last time our day saveta was on the morning
[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:32.000]  show he said point blank obey a police officer's commands no matter if you know they're wrong
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:38.640]  or illegal and you quote won't get hurt that flies in the face of common law common sense the
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:43.120]  constitution and you know i don't even like to attack the police chief he's very charming says
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:48.400]  he's my friend and all this but the point is he says so much evil stuff that's what they're teaching
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:54.320]  total submission to government is tyranny it's a recipe for hell on earth guaranteed max is a
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:26:00.480]  short segment long segment coming up but your eloquent breakdown it is so key about how and
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:05.760]  this is the essence they get us obsessing on saying brown bag is racist you'll be you'll be
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:11.280]  lose your job if you work for the government in in seattle if you bring a brown bag because that's
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:16.080]  there's no history of that being racist no claim no nothing just means cheap you know paper you put
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:21.040]  your lunch in everybody knows that but if they can expand it out to everything's racist except
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:28.480]  really hurting everybody i mean it's so elementary they want us looking at all this other side
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:35.840]  stuff that isn't even real in most cases while they engage in the electronic and in the other forms
[02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:43.200]  of apartheid please continue max geyser yeah well i'll add to this uh to this apartheid theme we
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:48.080]  talked about interest rate apartheid we talked about digital apartheid there's another form
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:53.280]  of apartheid and it goes back to what you were saying earlier about nazis and germany and of
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:59.360]  course they had a lot of us corporations like ibm coca cola and jp morgan were very active supporting
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:06.400]  the nazis at that time so was walt disney and the disney corporation and we see evidence of this today
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:12.960]  with the what i would say is a copyright apartheid you see the history of the internet is about
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:21.360]  really the internet versus walt disney corporation in hollywood disney has every 20 years fought in
[02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:26.960]  congress to extend copyright to protect mickey mouse because every 20 years mickey mouse is set
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:31.440]  to enter the public domain and remember thomas jefferson argued that there should not be any
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:36.000]  intellectual property rights that everything should be in the public domain but they compromised
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:41.040]  and they gave intellectual property a 14-year copyright monopoly plus a 14-year extension
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:47.840]  well thanks to disney that copyright is now lifetime plus 70 years or what laurence lesig
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:54.480]  would call he's a professor at stanford university a perpetual copyright and why this qualifies as
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:28:00.960]  apartheid versus the internet and why it's active right now is that corporations in hollywood want
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:06.160]  you or they want to force the price of ideas and intellectual property of just like they're forcing
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:11.040]  everything else up out of reach from the general population but it's worse than that under these
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:16.000]  treaties as you know max they're trying to get through they put controls on your speech before
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:21.360]  it's made which is a total form of slavery in the name of protecting their copyright
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:27.840]  but that's all put in place to protect disney's and other intellectual property right monopolies
[02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:35.600]  and he saw this played out last year spectacularly when the mpaa headed up by chris dodd went after
[02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:41.280]  erin schwarz and according to his father at the funeral erin schwarz was hounded to death by the
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:44.640]  government erin schwarz killed himself because they really murdered him it's clear they murdered
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:49.600]  him but they threatened him with 50 or 60 years in prison and they tried to get a plea bargain for
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:53.680]  two or three years in prison he was getting married he said i'm not giving up i'm going to beat him
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:58.400]  he was becoming a hero they came to his house and hung him but go ahead well they erin schwarz
[02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:04.880]  effectively was a martyr for the this idea of intellectual property freedom on the internet
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:10.400]  and this is another it form another insidious form of apartheid that you see playing out and
[02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:17.440]  creating this vast gap between information that's freely available and information that now cost
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:22.960]  money hollywood wants the internet to be like hbo where everyone pays to view and you don't create
[02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:26.880]  anything yourself because every time you try to create something for yourself on the internet you
[02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:30.720]  have to reference something else because all creation is referenced from all other creation
[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:36.880]  we're coming back we're coming back long segment i want to break this down this is so key here

[02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:33.280]  ladies and gentlemen here's the bottom line there is a scientific system of total control
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:42.800]  in the globalist own words that has been basically established in this country and worldwide and the
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:49.200]  globalist admit this in their own words game to stock markets just like casinos and then we've
[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:54.960]  got a major east coast casino owner you know in the news saying let's nuke iran preemptively it's
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:34:02.560]  literally ruled by by mafia by gangsters by thugs who have used the development of technological
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:09.280]  systems to wage war on reality and to wage war on any independent opposition that's why they
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:13.840]  instinctively want to get rid of the middle class i mean this is really a horrible situation
[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:19.680]  and i don't know how we get out of it i don't know how we controvert it i don't know how we pull
[02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:33.600]  out of it because because it's so bad it's so serious it's so unspeakable and it's so documented
[02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:37.760]  we're going to go back to max keiser here just a moment but here's some of the headlines
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:44.160]  obama care site crashes minutes before sabilia's testimony she's now come out and said blame her
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:50.000]  that's the quote she says it's all her fault here it is like we have that queued up don't we
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:58.240]  hold me accountable for this debacle and then hold obama even he leaves no it's the big insurance
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:04.240]  companies owned by the big banks that wrote this and by the way they're in the news doubling their
[02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:08.880]  profits since it passed three years ago and set to double them again and they're in the news saying
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:17.040]  no we want it fully implemented because we want the really big quadruple profits here is the headline
[02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:27.680]  ensures oppose obama care extension as a danger to profits and that's being put out in press releases
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:35.200]  and on the news this is the type of stuff that's going on this is from business week from bloomberg
[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:41.600]  and literally i have obama care supporters call it may go no it'll get fixed later i want my free
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:47.360]  stuff you could get free charity care now this bill lets hospitals even charity ones refuse you
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:54.240]  and i gave the subsection i had medical doctors on we warned you i mean it's just it's death panels
[02:35:54.240 --> 02:36:00.720]  it's death it's pure evil but you guys have to admit you've been conned where the buck stops
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:06.720]  some see a bystander new york times whitewashing for obama i want to get into the digital apartheid
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:12.960]  and and other systems of apartheid with max keiser but but max specifically on obama care
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:17.600]  we called it we broke it down we knew what it would be this is the opposite of social
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:23.680]  health care folks even want that why is the system so bold now is it that it's not just one dictator
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:29.200]  or one ruling party it's a global corporate group above the law tax exempt they know the public's
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:35.040]  not sophisticated enough to figure out how it's happening and so it's free reign but but shouldn't
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:40.480]  the elite themselves be scared of their own hubris and the fact that they have free reign
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:49.360]  and the system in place now is a dictatorship so um you have obama is a figurehead for a
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:55.280]  dictatorship and a dictatorship doesn't really have to answer to anybody and they'll put you in
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:37:02.320]  prison and people gladly go to prison if you give them uh you know free access to online gambling
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:06.960]  etc what i call the prison gulag mentality the model but i wanted to get back to this whole
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:11.600]  copyright apartheid idea because you know it's funny you play the star wars music and the star
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:16.960]  wars theme on your show and of course star wars the original star wars when that was being written
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:22.320]  by lucas he consulted very heavily with joseph cambell who wrote a very famous book a hero with
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:29.920]  a thousand faces about yes archetypes and the recurrence of archetypes and stories throughout
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:36.160]  history the problem with this with this copyright lifetime plus 70 copyright regime that hollywood
[02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:41.760]  wants and is imposing is that when people try to write new stories hollywood says no we own the
[02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:49.600]  rights to those stories so they are by by creating this division between you and access to your own
[02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:56.720]  history to access to your own being as a human being and part of a long ongoing history they
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:03.760]  have created effectively a digital lobotomy because people cannot even access ideas anymore without
[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:09.920]  being billed by one of these hollywood or intellectual property behemoth like a microsoft
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:15.280]  etc so this is how they've created this digital lobotomy by using copyright law and copyright
[02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:20.640]  extension law so that it's lifetime plus 70 years and claiming that all the stories all the hero
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:26.160]  with a thousand faces all the thousand stories throughout history are owned by these corporations
[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:34.080]  disney took german folktales like snow white and others and copyrighted them or uh now they
[02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:39.280]  claim that they own those stories so now people try to do stories like that they get sued by disney
[02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:44.720]  so they have and then same thing they took a hauns christiansons the little mermaid and then
[02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:50.480]  copyrighted it when it was open source right so they've taken that public domain of stories that
[02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:56.160]  we've you know taken hundreds of thousand you know thousands of years to develop and they claim
[02:38:56.160 --> 02:39:00.400]  ownership and so now when you go to try to be creative and that's part of being a human being
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:04.880]  is to be creative create things but if you have don't have access to even being creative because
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:09.280]  someone will come down to you and say that's we own that you can by the way it's hauns christian
[02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:14.480]  anderson i was going for memory there but but you're absolutely right and they're now even taking
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:21.200]  the classics that are open source and then saying this printing is copyright and then going after
[02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:25.600]  people who then put out a movie off of that claiming that they've copyrighted or they'll
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:30.400]  take government film footage of nukes going off and then do a false copyright and for those that
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:35.920]  don't know there's been a bunch of companies out there that if you just take a snippet of an article
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:42.080]  and put it in your article we've had ap and people tell us you can't even put a paragraph of our stuff
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:48.080]  in an article quoting us and i'm like but it's totally fair use or we've had Warner Brothers
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:51.360]  and i challenged them and had to do it behind the scenes in court and they backed off right
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:56.880]  in the same thing i can't i can't review batman in the conversation there's a provision called fair
[02:39:56.880 --> 02:40:02.320]  use and fair use is for educational purposes and other purposes and there's there used to be a thing
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:06.640]  called a public library where you could go in and read a book take out a book for a week and read
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:11.600]  that book but now these libraries have been totally uh libraries have been totally infiltrated and
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:16.240]  this whole idea of fair use has been subverted so that there is no more fair use and you end up when
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:22.240]  this situation we have now where all stories are owned by these mega corporations and it creates a
[02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:28.800]  this situation where people are even afraid to think because they might be billed or somehow
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:32.960]  invoiced if you if you write an email i wouldn't be surprised before too long you write an email
[02:40:32.960 --> 02:40:36.320]  and you start to use a phrase in your email and then you get a bill at the end of the month from
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:42.080]  microsoft or did actually google came out last month and said they are reading your email to
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:48.320]  make sure nothing copyright is in it right so either they will just take put push you off the grid
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:52.560]  so that's part of the digital apartheid now you're living in a digital no man's land or they send
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:57.040]  you a bill if you can't pay the bill they'll lend you money at 16 17 18 percent that's an
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:41:02.720]  interest rate apartheid uh or uh they'll just stick you in uh one of their other prisons and
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:08.480]  remember what mccain said he's about six years ago he said we'll blow your computer up with
[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:13.920]  remote commands fry your computer that's what they want total control let me ask you this question
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:19.680]  economically geopolitically how are things going for the kleptocrats what do you make of the you
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:26.240]  know 13 million dollar fines on uh companies like chase at the top of the pyramid slap on the
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:32.160]  rest uh other other points that are important max well the the greatest thing i saw in the last week
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:38.080]  was the quote that came out between a meeting between park obama and eric schmidt the google
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:45.840]  chair where america obama asked eric schmidt should we be worried about bitcoin and of course
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:52.560]  eric schmidt uh was clueless even about what bitcoin was at that moment in the meantime bitcoin
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:59.200]  has surged to become the napser of currencies to totally be threatening to all central banks
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:04.320]  and bankers everywhere and as the days go on we're finding out this to be the case and of course the
[02:42:04.320 --> 02:42:10.240]  big story this week was somebody bought bitcoins in 2009 for 57 dollars and now they're worth 800
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:14.800]  thousand dollars he just bought an apartment in norway and these types of stories are bringing a
[02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:22.160]  lot of attention to bitcoin who was really behind bitcoin it the they are activists who hate bankers
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:28.160]  so you've got a group of folks back in 2009 who put what's called a bitcoin protocol onto the
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:34.800]  internet which is a fan which is i think the most remarkable piece of technology and insight
[02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:40.480]  sent you're going back to kopernicus you know who who reasoned that in fact the the the sun was at
[02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:45.440]  the center of the solar system and not the earth at the time he got a lot of flak for that the
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:50.880]  creators of bitcoin have figured out that you could take the encryption algorithms used for
[02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:55.680]  sending encrypted emails and you could turn that into a currency that would be completely stateless
[02:42:55.680 --> 02:43:02.240]  and completely safe to use outside of all government interference it's a it's complete
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:07.920]  ingenious idea and it's changing to the entire global economy i want to be clear i want to be
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:13.200]  clear i totally believe in free open digital currencies believe it is the way of the future
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:18.800]  it gives the power of fiat to the people in the power of choice and a bunch will emerge and whatever's
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:23.360]  the most trusted the best will become preeminent and it could take the globalist out of the equation
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:28.400]  my issue is i believe whatever the first big one is they're going to try to sabotage it demonize
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:33.760]  it come after it so i haven't endorsed it to my listeners because i want it come you know
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:38.320]  ends up getting brought down if it does i don't want to be connected to that just because i understand
[02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:43.600]  how volatile and dangerous it is but i think out of pure speculation look look at this so
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:48.960]  they busted silk road recently silk road online marketplace for a lot of illicit activity was
[02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:56.000]  going on the fbi bug creator they then found themselves in possession of lots of bitcoins
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:44:02.720]  some of the bitcoins they found the password to and discovered 30 or 35 million dollars other
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:07.840]  bitcoins that they did not have the password to they are completely incapable of cracking
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:16.160]  into that bitcoin cash because the bitcoin network right now is bigger than 500 supercomputers it's
[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:21.200]  something like 60 000 computers distributed around the world they go through this bitcoin protocol
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:25.760]  and they're discovering what i you could call precious numbers that are as precious as precious
[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:29.440]  metals or precious diamonds well sure that's what they do with the whole fiat banking system using
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:35.520]  and against us this this inversion fiat banking system is money that has no intrinsic value
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:41.200]  whatsoever bitcoins have intrinsic value like gold or silver and that's the big difference
[02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:47.440]  except explain why they do because people put original value into it because there's two reasons
[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:53.920]  the system that it requires to solve the mathematical equations to unlock these these numbers
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:59.760]  is so huge that that itself is the value the value is the network the network is the value
[02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:05.040]  and then the numbers themselves are extraordinarily valuable they're for example you as you know as
[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:09.520]  your listeners probably know there's been an ongoing hunt for prime numbers and prime numbers
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:14.640]  are very rare and scientists are looking for these prime numbers and they are very happy to find one
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:19.440]  the bitcoin protocol is similar in that it finds numbers that fit in with the protocol that are
[02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:24.800]  also extremely rare and you need this network of thousands and thousands of computers working
[02:45:24.800 --> 02:45:31.120]  simultaneously to unlock the these numbers so that's the intrinsic value and it has then it has all
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:36.400]  the attributes of the currency and it's a medium of exchange so now i understand your point you
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:39.680]  you know you don't want to jump into it and recommend something that'll blow up let's wait
[02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:45.040]  to see if it has a good adoption rate at the moment if you if you read the bitcoin press
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:49.120]  you notice that it does have an excellent adoption rate you've got people like second
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:53.120]  market in new york city that have introduced a bitcoin investment trust where it's now become
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:57.760]  an asset class sure and that makes me think that it might have a leadus behind it who want to control
[02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:03.280]  this type of technology when it comes out so they you know you can't blame hedge funds necessarily
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:07.920]  for wanting to jump into things that make money hedge funds are also stateless hedge funds are
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:12.800]  no no i get it i get it i understand all that i understand that but listen getting off of bitcoin
[02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:17.120]  for a moment because there's so much other stuff going on what is the state of the global economy
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:23.200]  what's happening with the bond market what are your predictions for gold for war i mean i mean
[02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:29.440]  let's let's take a walk on the waterfront here tell me what's going on well in in the in the
[02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:37.120]  uk and in the us they're very similar i think in the uk it's really more of a good demonstration
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:42.160]  of what is going on than anywhere else right now the central bank are in charge mark carney the new
[02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:48.160]  guy who came in from canada he has just announced that he wants to expand the balance sheet of
[02:46:48.160 --> 02:46:52.880]  the bank of england up to nine trillion dollars they've already expanded it from eight hundred
[02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:59.040]  billion four and a half years ago to two two and a half trillion he wants to take it to nine trillion
[02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:07.200]  pounds so and his message to the world is you we will swap all of your toxic debt from all of your
[02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:15.760]  banks for fresh uh gilts the equivalent of a treasury bond for the uk so the uk is emerging
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:23.680]  as the global garbage dump for bad debts and mark carney has now given himself extraordinary regulatory
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:28.000]  a power because they've consolidated several regulatory offices under mark carney and he's
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:32.800]  led to people now around the world banks around the world that all the toxic debt in europe america
[02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:38.480]  south america and asia we will take your toxic debt and print gilts so he's becoming the enormous
[02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:44.240]  garbage collector he's a bernie made off on steroids he's a bernie made off to the 10th degree
[02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:49.680]  and this is and the uk economy as a result you've got another another apartheid happening in terms
[02:47:49.680 --> 02:47:55.920]  of housing you've got huge rich oligarchs who get the money for free and then buy apartments
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:48:00.640]  and they've pushed out everybody else very few people can afford to live in the city of london
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:06.080]  anymore who who are not part of the oligarch class people are just fleeing the city because it's too
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:12.080]  frickin expensive because exactly what mark carney's doing so he's he's put on the we are open sign
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:18.640]  to every crook and oligarch in the world they'll take all the toxic debts that you accumulated
[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:23.200]  in all the dodgy deals you did over the past five to ten years and we'll swap you with fresh
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:30.560]  gilts pound gilts and you can keep the ponzi scheme going now we see the same thing in in in in in

[02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:47.920]  going to be any taper of of buying by the fed of treasuries to keep the ponzi scheme going there is
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:53.440]  a high likelihood that they will expand quantitative easing from 85 billion dollars a month to 100
[02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:59.280]  120 you know mark faber said on a show on cnbc last week he would anticipate quantitative
[02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:04.160]  easing could go to a trillion dollars a month i mean that sounds incredible but if you go back

[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:31.760]  feelings like france has banned the word mother and father but my dreams they aren't as empty

[02:54:42.080 --> 02:54:53.680]  easy to tell the truth we either love the truth you hate it all right max keiser's with us
[02:54:55.040 --> 02:54:58.960]  we appreciate him joining us max you were getting into this whole economic thing
[02:54:58.960 --> 02:55:03.200]  obviously it's going towards hyperinflation they're putting police states in place to control
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:08.480]  things during that period can they get away with everything they seem to think they can but as you
[02:55:08.480 --> 02:55:14.080]  pointed out eric smith didn't know what bitcoin was he says we don't have any privacy and don't
[02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:18.320]  deserve it but then he makes his girlfriends wear uh michael jackson hoods over their heads
[02:55:19.360 --> 02:55:25.920]  i mean these guys are all crazy i i think in the final equation they're really just crooks
[02:55:25.920 --> 02:55:30.560]  and they're not invincible uh what does max keiser have to say well just a couple of late
[02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:34.640]  breaking things that are happening during the break here first of all you just said they banned
[02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:41.440]  the word mother and father how do they do that they use copyright law they'll say we own the word
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:47.680]  mother and father that's that's the problem of perpetual copyright law now you can't even use
[02:55:47.680 --> 02:55:53.600]  the word mother and father they use copyright law that's how they create the copyright apartheid
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:59.280]  political correctness the type of copyright where they just want to everything becomes racist
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:03.520]  it's not about political correctness they'll present it as being somehow politically motivated
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:08.240]  or ideologically motivated no it's about just they want to own it they want to own the words
[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:12.320]  and then if you ever use the words they want you to pay them if you can't pay they'll lend you the
[02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:17.040]  money it's all the economics there's no ideology whatsoever if everyone thinks it's ideologically
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:20.800]  driven they're falling into the trap it's just money money money now before we get off the
[02:56:20.800 --> 02:56:24.480]  air i want to talk about what i want to talk about which is that you know i'm starting a new
[02:56:24.480 --> 02:56:32.080]  crowdfunding um site called start join and this crowdfunding site is going to have a top-up fund
[02:56:32.080 --> 02:56:36.640]  so the more people that like the page because it doesn't actually start until december but
[02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:41.840]  i'm going to be tracking the number of likes on the facebook page associated with start join
[02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:47.840]  and as the number of likes goes up i'm going to increase that fund the top-up fund which is going
[02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:54.640]  to be essentially money that i'm going to be giving away to projects so uh yes this is very new
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:56:59.760]  this has just been up in the last couple of weeks but this is me trying to bring something
[02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:06.400]  economic to the table to rebalance what's going on here so that everyone has access to funding
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:12.480]  and everyone has access to the benefits of having funded stuff because right now nobody has access
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:16.800]  to the funding and nobody gets the benefit and by the way we're now seeing some of the big uh
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:21.280]  you know classic ones that are out there not letting people have pro-gun or libertarian
[02:57:22.320 --> 02:57:27.280]  projects so it's important to have diversity out there with these crowdfunding systems
[02:57:27.280 --> 02:57:33.840]  yeah exactly and this is as you know good goes to the technologies i've developed for 15 years
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:37.680]  so we were going to bring some new things to the to the party but right now i'm just trying to get
[02:57:37.680 --> 02:57:42.080]  as many likes as possible on this on the facebook start join page where i think i you might have it
[02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:47.520]  up on your on your screen right now uh as just a way to kick this thing off which will be coming
[02:57:47.520 --> 02:57:52.240]  into beta in december and the more likes i get the bigger the fund which means the more money i'm
[02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:57.680]  going to be giving away that's very interesting max in closing how bad is the hyperinflation
[02:57:57.680 --> 02:58:03.120]  going to get and when will we really see it start to get worse well in hyperinflation
[02:58:03.120 --> 02:58:10.160]  or any type of major inflation you are referring to something called the velocity of money right
[02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:14.960]  now all the money is being printed by the fed or other central banks just sits on the balance sheets
[02:58:14.960 --> 02:58:19.360]  of the banks and they use it amongst themselves to make quick gains amongst themselves it doesn't
[02:58:19.360 --> 02:58:24.960]  enter the general economy but once you have a big creditor let's say china decides that you know what
[02:58:24.960 --> 02:58:28.320]  we've got four trillion of these dollars sitting around do five more minutes we're back in one

[03:01:57.280 --> 03:02:00.800]  and i know you can't really give advice on stuff like that but what would you do if someone well
[03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:04.960]  i mean it's too complex and i it's hard for me to figure out what to do myself but here's a fox
[03:02:04.960 --> 03:02:10.320]  news article Detroit bankruptcy proposal would leave pensioners with 16 cents on the dollar
[03:02:10.320 --> 03:02:15.360]  and by the time they're done with us nobody's getting your pension i told you you'll get 10 to 20
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:20.160]  percent nobody's going to get social security you're going to get death paneled and they've
[03:02:20.160 --> 03:02:25.440]  got actuaries they've already done it northern europe this is the plan the bankers want you poor
[03:02:26.400 --> 03:02:32.640]  so they're trying to create debtor prisons they're trying to persecute people uh i mean i personally
[03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:38.000]  if i had some big uh you know college degree thing and most of them you know like 80 something
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:42.880]  or some of the time you could never even pay it off with the jobs you've got it's all a giant fraud
[03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:48.800]  anyways uh i would pay your debt back to a local bank or a local group or some or or it's a family
[03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:53.360]  that loans you money everybody always cheats though their family i i mean if it was with a big bank
[03:02:53.360 --> 03:02:57.920]  or something uh you know one of the big six narcotics trafficking banks it's almost your duty
[03:02:57.920 --> 03:03:04.400]  in my view to a not pay and and then of course you can later settle with them or do what what
[03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:11.600]  what all the big you know gangsters do uh like um uh trump and peoples they just put you know they
[03:03:11.600 --> 03:03:14.880]  just declare bankruptcy over and over again but of course they'll go after you if you're small
[03:03:14.880 --> 03:03:20.080]  they only let the billionaires you know engage in fraud uh through that but and i'm not even encouraging
[03:03:20.080 --> 03:03:28.080]  you to do that because look look the system is a wall of evil and it's designed to wreck everything
[03:03:28.080 --> 03:03:34.400]  and there's never no one's ever set something up this purely evil so all i know is the colleges
[03:03:34.400 --> 03:03:39.440]  are all a fraud they're all a facade they're all a big front all the big ones uh and i mean take
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:43.280]  university of texas this is basically a crime syndicate that secretly owns like a third of the
[03:03:43.280 --> 03:03:47.360]  country and you know is involved in every shady deal you can imagine but they've got beavos so
[03:03:47.360 --> 03:03:51.280]  it makes it okay it's all fake and they send out these things all their alumni saying give us your
[03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:56.320]  estate when you die so it can be laundered into offshore operations i mean these are mafia i mean
[03:03:56.320 --> 03:04:02.400]  it's just it's all a giant joke they've broken the social contract with us okay they're waging war
[03:04:02.400 --> 03:04:08.880]  on us so um you know i i mean i i think i think you should pay more into social security they
[03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:13.120]  should raise taxes you should pay off all your fake debts um and and just worship government
[03:04:14.080 --> 03:04:17.600]  and and then if they you know want to check point want to do a proctology exam i think you
[03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:23.040]  should uh worship them and thank them how's that sound that sounds awful you know i'm doing fairness
[03:04:23.040 --> 03:04:27.280]  doctrine because yeah i just said i wouldn't pay it back or whatever especially if you can't pay it
[03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:30.720]  back and what's the point it's like the interest go up and up and up you gotta make them make a deal
[03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:36.320]  with you okay but that that's what alex jones would do the FCC approved though we do this now
[03:04:36.320 --> 03:04:40.240]  part of the fairness doctrine i had a bit coming back in is that you know i think you should just
[03:04:40.240 --> 03:04:56.160]  literally do whatever the government says and worship them roman's 13 worship government
