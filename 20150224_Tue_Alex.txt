[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  Here is a sneak peek at the new head-to-head TV show I'm doing with Jesse Ventura.
[00:20.000 --> 00:26.000]  Energy dependency is always a big thing. Look at wars. How do they fight wars?
[00:26.000 --> 00:33.000]  One of the major things they do is cut off the energy in whatever form it is to the particular country you're going to war with.
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.000]  We did it with the Japanese in World War II. We embargoed they couldn't get any oil.
[00:39.000 --> 00:49.000]  We would have been even more successful against the Germans in World War II except the Germans had already figured out how to create synthetic oil.
[00:49.000 --> 00:57.000]  And by the way, in the German synthetic oil, there was no fossil fuel used.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  So I question whether oil is actually a fossil fuel. I don't believe that it is.
[01:02.000 --> 01:11.000]  I think that's made up in which to get people to believe so that they can control the pricing then that there's only a finite amount of it.
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  The Keystone Pipeline isn't pushing us towards energy independence at all.
[01:15.000 --> 01:22.000]  All it is doing is going to make huge money for the oil companies as they export that oil out of the United States.
[01:22.000 --> 01:30.000]  The simple way to look at it, if Keystone was going to provide oil for us, they'd be loading it into trucks.
[01:30.000 --> 01:37.000]  But what are they doing? Keystone is going down to the Gulf of Mexico and it is being loaded onto tanker ships.
[01:37.000 --> 01:45.000]  So unless them ships are heading to LA or San Francisco, say goodbye to all that oil from Keystone. It's heading to China.
[01:45.000 --> 01:54.000]  There's your key to it right there. If it was coming to us, it would be loaded onto trucks and you wouldn't have to build a pipeline all the way to the Gulf.
[01:54.000 --> 02:03.000]  But because they need to load it onto ships, the pipeline goes to the Gulf to put it on ships so the oil companies can make big money over in China.
[02:03.000 --> 02:16.000]  We use so much oil, the United States of America, there is no way that we can provide it for ourselves without seeking it in other countries and other places throughout the world.
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  Okay? That's the way I see it.
[02:21.000 --> 02:31.000]  What is energy dependence? Well, it's basically slavery. We are slaves to oxygen. We have to have it. Plants are slaves to carbon dioxide.
[02:31.000 --> 02:39.000]  If you go back to the most ancient form of warfare, practiced for more than 6,000 years, it's siege, shut off the city's water, shut off their food.
[02:39.000 --> 02:52.000]  So through oil dependence in the last 100 plus years, the Standard Oil and the Saudi Arabians today, we are slaves to OPEC and the cartels that control oil.
[02:52.000 --> 03:01.000]  And so they've done everything they can to block the development of independent renewable new forms of energy like solar, wind.
[03:01.000 --> 03:13.000]  The problem is the very same system has allowed the few innovations that have been made to be corrupted and wind power farms and solar systems that have been built by government
[03:13.000 --> 03:24.000]  have just turned into inefficient boondoggles for the establishment so they can basically make the new clean energy systems fail to discredit it.
[03:24.000 --> 03:32.000]  We're seeing right now Saudi Arabia and others out of bankrupt Russia and independent U.S. oil producers by driving down prices.
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  So there's also a lot of manipulation within the oil market itself.
[03:37.000 --> 03:46.000]  But when you begin to research artificial energy dependence, you're really hitting at the heart of how the globalist control our planet today.
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  And that's why I encourage people to develop their own solar systems at their home that's off the grid.
[03:51.000 --> 03:59.000]  Government encourages certain solar systems or wind systems that are hooked directly into the grid and the system and are highly regulated.
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.000]  What we need is truly independent off the grid systems like Jesse Ventura has set up in Baja, Mexico.
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.000]  I'm Alex Jones, head to head with Jesse Ventura.
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  And this is an idea that Jesse's folks had and I like it.
[04:16.000 --> 04:23.000]  Once a week he'll take two minutes and I'll take two minutes and we won't look at each other's video.
[04:23.000 --> 04:28.000]  And then we just sandwich them together to see if we agree or disagree.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  And then when he comes back on the radio show we can debate things we disagree about or flesh out things we agree about.
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  And it's surprising how much we did agree on and the angles we went with.
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.000]  Because I did not look at it. He did not look at my video. They sent it to us. We sandwiched it together.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  And there you go. Jesse Ventura is joining us.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[04:49.000 --> 04:57.000]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[04:57.000 --> 05:02.000]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[08:16.000 --> 08:20.000]  We're going to be here at Lord Willing for the next three hours.
[08:20.000 --> 08:34.000]  There is so much to get into today. It really is over the top how fast the globalists are moving on every single front.
[08:34.000 --> 08:53.000]  From Internet to ObamaNet, the Wall Street Journal, here are the type of headlines that are out today. Future of the entire Internet at stake, FCC chief presses to release new web rules.
[08:53.000 --> 09:13.000]  The regs will, quote, make the net as slow as in Europe. Isn't that just special? Meanwhile, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, has come out and testified before Congress today, this morning,
[09:13.000 --> 09:24.000]  saying that she does not want the Fed audited and they continue to plan to have zero interest rates for the establishment, not for the general public, into the foreseeable future.
[09:24.000 --> 09:34.000]  So free money for the elite and the insiders, but basically nobody else.
[09:34.000 --> 09:45.000]  There's the CNBC headline of your TV viewer. I strongly oppose audit, the Fed Yellen says. And that ties into this article that's up on infowars.com.
[09:45.000 --> 09:56.000]  14 signs that most Americans are flat broke and totally unprepared for the coming economic crisis.
[09:56.000 --> 10:05.000]  And you can have arguments about whether it's a year away or five years away. It's already here when four out of 10 Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[10:05.000 --> 10:14.000]  And if they have one unforeseen emergency bill, they're bankrupted. We are net debtors now in this country.
[10:14.000 --> 10:28.000]  And only the establishment is standing to gain from all of this. That's coming up. We've got some good news. Montana House Judiciary Committee pushes back against agenda 21.
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  We're going to be breaking that down. We've got some other positive news.
[10:33.000 --> 10:45.000]  Record U.S. farmers switching a record number of U.S. farmers are switching to non GMO crops in 2015 continue to vote with your dollar.
[10:45.000 --> 10:52.000]  An infowars.com story with the Department of Agriculture's own numbers.
[10:52.000 --> 11:07.000]  But here's the bad news. 75% of air and rain samples contain Monsanto's Roundup. Biotech isn't just tainting the food supply. We're going to break that down.
[11:07.000 --> 11:16.000]  Secret TSA program quizzes travelers returning to the U.S. but illegal aliens are let in with no quiz and no ID.
[11:16.000 --> 11:28.000]  Federal agency interviews Americans abroad before allowing them to fly home. It's all about letting the slaves know that they better give up all their liberties and learn to behave like prisoners.
[11:28.000 --> 11:38.000]  Scare tactics or possible threat? Last time Homeland Security was threatened with budget cuts, America suffered a terror attack. That of course was the Boston bombing.
[11:38.000 --> 11:46.000]  Threat advisories have been circulated about a possible terror attack on the Mall of America in Minnesota, as you know, since the weekend, right as their budget's up.
[11:46.000 --> 11:54.000]  And Jay Johnson came out, of course, a few days ago and said, hey, if you don't want the mall to get hit, you need to go ahead and up our funding.
[11:54.000 --> 12:04.000]  While they leave the borders wide open, I mean, terrorists could randomly attack a restaurant, randomly attack a train station, randomly attack anything.
[12:04.000 --> 12:15.000]  A PTA meeting. The idea that we need Homeland Security everywhere to protect every, quote, soft target inside the country when the borders are wide open, except for citizens.
[12:15.000 --> 12:23.000]  Citizens dutifully have their laptops downloaded, their cell phones downloaded, or ask all these questions harassed, your bags are dug through.
[12:23.000 --> 12:38.000]  But oh, you're coming in out of Mexico and you walk over and say, I have no ID. They just waved you right through it. I witnessed this five, six years ago in Texas and in California at airports flying around internally in the U.S.
[12:38.000 --> 12:52.000]  And then last year, it came out in mainstream news that indeed there's memos and TSA is told, let them fly without IDs. I mean, this is a joke. It has nothing to do with stopping terrorism.
[12:52.000 --> 13:11.000]  It's all about dominating and controlling the American people. We're going to get into that report as well. James O'Keefe, of course, came out yesterday and said he was afraid for his life out of scores of huge reports and stories that he has broken.
[13:11.000 --> 13:27.000]  Well, now he's released the report and it's on drugsreport.com out of the New York Post and other publications. It's Garner, the man who was choked to death by police and New York daughter on Sharpton says he's all about the money.
[13:27.000 --> 13:41.000]  And it's basically collection of videos exposing the people of New York don't like Sharpton. Some people will say you went up against Obama, you brought down Acre and you've been arrested. You've done all these big stories.
[13:41.000 --> 13:56.000]  Why would you be scared, O'Keefe, of Sharpton? Well, you don't live in New York like O'Keefe does. People that have gone up against Sharpton end up getting burned alive, end up getting stabbed. I mean, he is a gangster and an FBI informant.
[13:56.000 --> 14:18.000]  And a coke dealer. So he's kind of the king of Harlem. And that's why whenever we had Pastor Manning on a month or so ago with his initiative to get Sharpton fired off MSNBC for all of his activities, that I said, boy, that takes a lot of cojones because Sharpton is a very dangerous individual.
[14:18.000 --> 14:30.000]  Some people kind of struck their soldiers and said, you know, what's the big deal, O'Keefe? Well, O'Keefe never put out tweets before saying, I fear for my life on this. Believe me, I'd fear for my life bringing down Acre.
[14:30.000 --> 14:39.000]  He's been arrested. He's been thrown in jail. He's been accused of wiretapping in Louisiana. And this guy's earned his bones in the press over and over again.
[14:39.000 --> 14:52.000]  So I respect the fact that he's probably got some threats coming through. We're working to get him on the show sometime this week, not today or tomorrow to get the inside scoop on what's happening on that from the Veritas Project Director.
[14:52.000 --> 15:00.000]  That's a model of grassroots media and really just an example of how to counter these people.
[15:00.000 --> 15:10.000]  So those reports are up on DrudgeReport.com as well, including our infowars.com article on James O'Keefe. I'm afraid for my life. You want to read those actual quotes and more.
[15:10.000 --> 15:24.000]  Jesse Ventura joins us in about 15, 20 minutes from now. Jesse had the idea a few months ago for once a week for him to shoot a video on a topic or for me to shoot a video on a topic.
[15:24.000 --> 15:35.000]  Either one of us could come up with a topic and then he sends us two minutes and then we produce two minutes without watching his video, but on the subject that is mentioned.
[15:35.000 --> 15:48.000]  And then we put the two videos together so that it's a real, not even so much debate. Sometimes it'll be a debate. Sometimes it'll be a head scratcher. Sometimes it'll be something that spurs thought.
[15:48.000 --> 15:58.000]  And it's kind of exciting. I mean, I like the idea because you don't know what the other person's views are exactly on, say, energy dependence.
[15:58.000 --> 16:07.000]  So Ventura sent us his two minutes and, you know, Josh back there, the video editor, he looked at it and I didn't watch the video.
[16:07.000 --> 16:15.000]  Didn't tell me what the video was about. He said, oh, he talks about Keystone and some other stuff. That was it.
[16:15.000 --> 16:30.000]  Next time I wouldn't be told that. And I didn't really even get into Keystone. So I went and shot my two minutes at my house and then we slapped the two together.
[16:30.000 --> 16:37.000]  And that's going to be head to head that he'll air on his show and then we'll also air here. And then when he occasionally comes on the broadcast, we can further discuss those.
[16:37.000 --> 16:48.000]  So I'm going to air the first installment. It's only five minutes long total with a 30 second intro and outro, four minutes of content. We're going to air that at the bottom of the hour as Ventura joins us.
[16:48.000 --> 17:04.000]  And the full video is on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. I think it's very, very interesting that we agreed on so much and brought up different angles that really just complimented each other.
[17:04.000 --> 17:11.000]  Because you'll notice when you hear Ventura, it's not an establishment left or right talking point, same thing with us. We're just going off how energy really works.
[17:11.000 --> 17:18.000]  And a lot of people say, well, I'm not into energy or I don't know energy stocks. Why would I care? Energy is everything. We're not going to just talk about energy today.
[17:18.000 --> 17:30.000]  We're going to talk about police violence in this country. And is it an epidemic or is it the fact that social media is showing the bad examples, creating that perception?
[17:30.000 --> 17:48.000]  And what's the end game there? We're going to look at the different wars, the economy, Obama and the future of the Internet and so much more with Jesse Ventura coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[17:48.000 --> 18:01.000]  Now, before I go any further, here are some of the headlines on infowars.com. FCC or ex-FCC chief shocked by feds attempting to regulate the Internet.
[18:01.000 --> 18:10.000]  And they're doing it under the guise of protecting and under net neutrality. So they've got to bring in all these anti-free speech, SOPA and SISPA rules.
[18:10.000 --> 18:23.000]  Video, barbaric sheriff's deputy drags woman through courthouse by shackled feet. There's just an epidemic of these videos and we could fill the entire show with just the craziest stuff.
[18:23.000 --> 18:44.000]  Cupcake, cupcake cop, pepper sprays grandmother in the face, dislocates her shoulder, took a gladiatorial event, FBI cops raid Republic of Texas meeting, fingerprint members see cell phones and computers, secret TSA program, quizzes travelers returning to the U.S.
[18:44.000 --> 18:56.000]  Got to love how it's secret. Eric Garner's daughter on Al Sharpton, he's all about the money. Just mentioned that.
[18:56.000 --> 19:16.000]  And the good news that I'll cover in the next segment, record number of U.S. farmers switching to non-GMO crops in 2015, but then how that ties into the bad news. That's just some of the news up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com that we'll be covering today.
[19:16.000 --> 19:39.000]  Another report as well, feds fear patriots not murdering terrorists. I'm Alex Schoen, your host, infowars.com, and prisonplanet.com are our main websites. The subscription TV site is prisonplanet.tv, but hey, you need not be a subscriber if you just want to see the radio show slash TV show, the simulcast.
[19:39.000 --> 19:46.000]  Go to infowars.com forward slash show. You can find the free audio and video feeds to pass on to friends and family.
[20:09.000 --> 20:29.000]  I'm really glad my buddy Mark turned me on to guns80.com. I got to tell you, I didn't want to buy any more firearms. I didn't want a paperwork trail headed back to Big Brother. I want 100% privacy. I want to be an invisible gun owner.
[20:29.000 --> 20:45.000]  So Mark says, hey, you know, guns80.com, ghostAR15. Ghost means invisible, get it? GhostAR15, guns80.com. I got a couple, if you know what I mean. Go to guns80.com or call 844-2-Guns80.
[20:45.000 --> 21:01.000]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body. As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink and you'll become wrinkled. An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly. Not fun.
[21:01.000 --> 21:14.000]  However, if you could consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery. One World Way is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[21:14.000 --> 21:34.000]  My name is Errol. I'm 74 years old. You know, the taste of One World Way is amazing. I play pickleball and since taking One World Way and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out. I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Way.

[24:03.000 --> 24:22.000]  But meanwhile, the New York Post reports, despite the fact that billions, billions with a B, has been spent since 9-11 on, quote, added surveillance and security systems in the rotten apple, cops can't catch gang that has stolen 73 ATMs.
[24:22.000 --> 24:32.000]  They drive it with a truck, tie up to it, jerk it out of the wall and drag it off. When you go to New York City, they're just police almost on every corner, but they can't stop whoever's done this.
[24:32.000 --> 24:41.000]  Probably an inside job connected to that famously corrupt police department. The bigger the police state, the less safe we all are.
[24:41.000 --> 24:49.000]  And in the end, the police state always is used to rob what's left of the people's wealth and that's now happening. Snow on the ground in 48 states.
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  We're going to talk about that in a moment. But first, speaking of the police state, Jay Johnson, I mentioned this, but let's play the clip.
[24:55.000 --> 25:07.000]  America needs to be vigilant about Mall of America threat. He also goes on to say on CNN, all the more reason why I need a budget. That's right.
[25:07.000 --> 25:20.000]  Homeland security over every federal agency. And then now they need more money to keep us safe from the imminent jihadi attack on malls, which really might happen.
[25:20.000 --> 25:28.000]  They brought in so many North African jihadis that they let them fly out of the US and England and Europe to fight all of the Middle East.
[25:28.000 --> 25:35.000]  Our government's funding them. You bet. They may not have to cook up some group to do this. They've got enough crazies to do it.
[25:35.000 --> 25:43.000]  And then it'll be, well, the answer is taking all your guns. Well, there's a problem. ABC News reported this last year.
[25:43.000 --> 25:51.000]  And it was also reported back in 2013 after Westgate Interpol chief ponders armed citizen ring.
[25:51.000 --> 25:57.000]  Ronald Noble asked if Nairobi massacre would have ended sooner in pro-gun states.
[25:57.000 --> 26:07.000]  So the common sense cannot be suppressed forever. Let's go to Jay Johnson terrorizing the public and fear mongering about terror attacks.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  Shane, give me more funding. Let's go to that clip.
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  And I just want to read you one more thing on this. This is a statement from the Mall of America today.
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  Mall of America is aware of a threatening video that was released, which included a mention and images of the mall.
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  We take any potential threats seriously and respond appropriately.
[26:24.000 --> 26:31.000]  We have implemented extra security precautions. Some may be noticeable to guests and others won't.
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  What are you telling Americans who might be planning a trip to the mall this Sunday?
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  What we're telling the public in general is you've got to be vigilant.
[26:41.000 --> 26:47.000]  We just revamped our, if you see something, say something campaign at the Super Bowl last month.
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  Well, I see tyrants.
[26:48.000 --> 26:58.000]  And so public engagement, public awareness is critical. Americans should still feel that they are free to associate.
[26:58.000 --> 27:06.000]  They are free to go to public gatherings, but it's critical that we have public awareness and public participation in our efforts.
[27:06.000 --> 27:11.000]  Are they safe in going to the Mall of America today? If you want to go take your kids to the Mall of America?
[27:11.000 --> 27:17.000]  I would say that if anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they've got to be particularly careful.
[27:17.000 --> 27:24.000]  And as the statement you read indicates, there will be enhanced security there that will be apparent to people who go there.
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  Federal security as well?
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  There will be enhanced security there.
[27:27.000 --> 27:35.000]  But public vigilance, public awareness and public caution in situations like this is particularly important.
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  And it's the environment we're in, frankly. And it's all the more reason why I need a budget.
[27:40.000 --> 27:49.000]  And then it just cuts. It's from CNS News. Grab that clip. CNSnews.com. This is just amazing.
[27:49.000 --> 27:56.000]  They train, they arm Al Qaeda slash ISIS. They admit ISIS is Al Qaeda. They let them get funding.
[27:56.000 --> 28:03.000]  Saudi Arabia is involved. Turkey's involved. Israel's involved. The U.S. is involved. All of this to topple Syria.
[28:03.000 --> 28:09.000]  And then when it blows back, they say, you do have to be careful. It is dangerous.
[28:09.000 --> 28:18.000]  Statistically, we talk about it, honeybees kill over 200 people a year. Terrorism doesn't. Here in the United States.
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.000]  So what if it's a real threat? Since when does Land of the Free, Home of the Brave even cower with some police state chief up there going,
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  we need more funding and we're going to have a federal presence and we're going to be there and more security.
[28:30.000 --> 28:38.000]  Some you'll see, some you won't to keep you safe. When the threat is the big giant out of control government.
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.000]  This is the same federal government that has completely opened our borders outside of law and is legalizing tens of millions of illegals,
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  many of them aggravated felons and releasing them when local police arrest them.
[28:48.000 --> 28:55.000]  ICE won't even come pick up rapist armed robbers and arsonist on record.
[28:55.000 --> 29:01.000]  But they will sit there and oh, in hushed voices. The threats are very serious.
[29:01.000 --> 29:11.000]  If you go to Mall of America, you've got to really watch it. This is so transparent. The threat is you people.
[29:11.000 --> 29:16.000]  You know the ones that ship guns into Mexico in a false flag to demonize the Second Amendment.
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.000]  You people are caught red-handed and you're disgusting. The same ones fear mongering.
[29:20.000 --> 29:25.000]  Global warming's real and we've got to pay global carbon taxes. We're all dead.
[29:25.000 --> 29:31.000]  I went and saw Kingsman, the Secret Service last night. It's like my show again. It's like every movie is this show now.
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  Global government wants to exterminate everybody except the elite. It's like Moon Raker.
[29:35.000 --> 29:36.000]  We're on the march.
[29:36.000 --> 29:37.000]  Part two.
[29:37.000 --> 30:00.000]  We're on the march.
[30:00.000 --> 30:15.000]  We're on the march.
[30:15.000 --> 30:41.000]  We're on the march.
[30:41.000 --> 31:07.000]  We're on the march.
[31:07.000 --> 31:33.000]  We're on the march.
[31:33.000 --> 31:59.000]  We're on the march.
[31:59.000 --> 32:25.000]  We're on the march.
[32:25.000 --> 32:46.000]  We're on the march.
[32:46.000 --> 33:12.000]  We're on the march.
[33:12.000 --> 33:17.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[33:17.000 --> 33:39.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:39.000 --> 33:45.000]  Energy dependency is always a big thing. Look at wars. How do they fight wars?
[33:45.000 --> 33:53.000]  One of the major things they do is cut off the energy in whatever form it is to the particular country you're going to war with.
[33:53.000 --> 33:58.000]  We did it with the Japanese in World War II. We embargoed they couldn't get any oil.
[33:58.000 --> 34:08.000]  We would have been even more successful against the Germans in World War II except the Germans had already figured out how to create synthetic oil.
[34:08.000 --> 34:16.000]  And by the way, in the German synthetic oil, there was no fossil fuel used.
[34:16.000 --> 34:22.000]  So I questioned whether oil is actually a fossil fuel. I don't believe that it is.
[34:22.000 --> 34:30.000]  I think that's made up in which to get people to believe so that they can control the pricing then that there's only a finite amount of it.
[34:30.000 --> 34:41.000]  The Keystone Pipeline isn't pushing us towards energy independence at all. All it is doing is going to make huge money for the oil companies as they export that oil out of the United States.
[34:41.000 --> 34:49.000]  The simple way to look at it, if Keystone was going to provide oil for us, they'd be loading it into trucks.
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.000]  But what are they doing? Keystone is going down to the Gulf of Mexico and it is being loaded onto tanker ships.
[34:56.000 --> 35:04.000]  So unless them ships are heading to LA or San Francisco, say goodbye to all that oil from Keystone. It's heading to China.
[35:04.000 --> 35:13.000]  There's your key to it right there. If it was coming to us, it would be loaded onto trucks and you wouldn't have to build a pipeline all the way to the Gulf.
[35:13.000 --> 35:22.000]  But because they need to load it onto ships, the pipeline goes to the Gulf to put it on ships so the oil companies can make big money over in China.
[35:22.000 --> 35:35.000]  We use so much oil, the United States of America, there is no way that we can provide it for ourselves without seeking it in other countries and other places throughout the world.
[35:35.000 --> 35:40.000]  Okay? That's the way I see it.
[35:40.000 --> 35:50.000]  What is energy dependence? Well, it's basically slavery. We are slaves to oxygen. We have to have it. Plants are slaves to carbon dioxide.
[35:50.000 --> 35:58.000]  If you go back to the most ancient form of warfare, practiced for more than 6,000 years, it's siege, shut off the city's water, shut off their food.
[35:58.000 --> 36:11.000]  So through oil dependence in the last 100 plus years, the Standard Oil and the Saudi Arabians today, we are slaves to OPEC and the cartels that control oil.
[36:11.000 --> 36:20.000]  And so they've done everything they can to block the development of independent renewable new forms of energy like solar, wind.
[36:20.000 --> 36:32.000]  The problem is the very same system has allowed the few innovations that have been made to be corrupted and wind power farms and solar systems that have been built by government
[36:32.000 --> 36:43.000]  have just turned into inefficient boondoggles for the establishment so they can basically make the new clean energy systems fail to discredit it.
[36:43.000 --> 36:51.000]  We're seeing right now Saudi Arabia and others out of bankrupt Russia and independent U.S. oil producers by driving down prices.
[36:51.000 --> 36:56.000]  So there's also a lot of manipulation within the oil market itself.
[36:56.000 --> 37:05.000]  But when you begin to research artificial energy dependence, you're really hitting at the heart of how the globalist control our planet today.
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.000]  And that's why I encourage people to develop their own solar systems at their home that's off the grid.
[37:10.000 --> 37:18.000]  Government encourages certain solar systems or wind systems that are hooked directly into the grid and the system and are highly regulated.
[37:18.000 --> 37:24.000]  What we need is truly independent off the grid systems like Jesse Ventura has set up in Baja, Mexico.
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.000]  I'm Alex Jones, head to head with Jesse Ventura.
[37:33.000 --> 37:40.000]  I think that really turned out well and we've got Jesse Ventura joining us for the next 50 minutes or so live from Baja, Mexico.
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.000]  Amazing Skype connection despite the fact that he's down there and he's got some amazing stories to tell.
[37:45.000 --> 37:51.000]  But his crew had the idea that periodically every month or so Jesse will take two minutes.
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  He did it in one take, I did mine in one take as well, exactly two minutes.
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  And then we sandwich them together.
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.000]  And I think we pretty much agreed from different angles on that piece.
[38:01.000 --> 38:08.000]  Jesse was just saying during the break, he thinks it'll be a real debate when we talk about illegal immigration.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  We can probably not save that for that.
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.000]  We can debate that today here as well.
[38:13.000 --> 38:29.000]  But we're going to cover the waterfront with Jesse. You can find this piece that airs over at aura.tv forward slash off the grid or twitter.com forward slash gov J Ventura and Facebook forward slash official Jesse Ventura.
[38:29.000 --> 38:39.000]  We have those all linked up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and you can follow us of course at real Alex Jones and on our different Facebook channels that are listed.
[38:39.000 --> 38:47.000]  What I know about Jesse Ventura get to know him over now. It's hard to believe like eight nine years is that he's the real deal.
[38:47.000 --> 38:54.000]  And even though we disagree on probably 30% of the issues, it doesn't matter because at least he's an honorable guy.
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.000]  He stands up for basic liberty. I'd call him a libertarian.
[38:57.000 --> 39:08.000]  He's an anti establishment party guy. You've heard him here many times and the system is attacking him and demonizing him and misrepresenting what he says and what he stands for.
[39:08.000 --> 39:18.000]  More and more because they're scared of him. And that's why they did the fake thing where he got basically arrested by the police in California at the at the airport or whatever did never happen.
[39:18.000 --> 39:30.000]  Wasn't true. He was in Minnesota or the police had stopped him. It was a confrontation made up or the whole American sniper thing which is now unraveling and you know coming out that the movies basically has nothing to do with reality.
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  Why would they try to put him in that book?
[39:32.000 --> 39:42.000]  And I'm sure Ventura hadn't threatened to assume probably in the movie. It's because the establishment is really going after him and anybody else that they know they don't control.
[39:42.000 --> 39:50.000]  Because Jesse Ventura and we're going to get to all the issues with him for new listeners with a lot of new affiliates and always being demonized and attacked.
[39:50.000 --> 39:57.000]  Wouldn't go for the war when he had a top rated show back when MSNBC had tens of millions of viewers.
[39:57.000 --> 40:08.000]  So for three years he was gagged from speaking and played out his contract because and of course Donahue had some of the top ratings in cable and they fired him because he wouldn't go along with the war.
[40:08.000 --> 40:17.000]  So that's why I admire Jesse Ventura is because he wouldn't sell out to the establishment and he's a maverick just like in full wars is and that's the spirit of what we try to do here.
[40:17.000 --> 40:24.000]  But overall I don't think you've seen that head to head piece yet. You just heard it Jesse. What do you think of it?
[40:24.000 --> 40:31.000]  I think it worked very well Alex. You know we both made our points. Like you said we came from at it from slightly different angles.
[40:31.000 --> 40:38.000]  But I think we both realize the importance of energy independence and that we have to achieve it.
[40:38.000 --> 40:47.000]  And what I've been pushing people very hard on is the fact that oil is old energy oil is old. We need to start looking new.
[40:47.000 --> 40:57.000]  We need to start looking beyond. I remember when I met with the scientist John Hutchinson and he looked at me at the end of our meeting and he said something to me.
[40:57.000 --> 41:06.000]  He said do you really believe that scientists like me since 1945 haven't discovered anything beyond the jet engine.
[41:06.000 --> 41:13.000]  And I looked down said no John I would think in 50 years of time you have discovered something better than the jet engine.
[41:13.000 --> 41:21.000]  I remember John smiled and said how long do you think it would take to go to New York to L.A. if you didn't have to deal with gravity and just smiled at me.
[41:21.000 --> 41:30.000]  Well and the point I'm making Alex is that we need to start looking to the future. Enough of this oil stuff. Oil is old news.
[41:30.000 --> 41:40.000]  It's energy new. Let's move into the new century with a new outlook on energy and start putting our resources towards finding it.
[41:40.000 --> 41:51.000]  Let's get into energy first because we know that I remember in the 70s a Chevy had a carburetor that would get you 100 miles to the gallon.
[41:51.000 --> 42:05.000]  I know that the SR 71 Blackbird in service in 1951 they still says the fastest airplane in the world when as you said the Germans invented jets the Nazis did in 1943.
[42:05.000 --> 42:16.000]  So for them to sit around and claim that what we're seeing is the latest greatest when the federal government admits that they are trying to block quote disruptive technologies.
[42:16.000 --> 42:24.000]  Well they mean disruptive to the grandsons and granddaughters of the robber barons that pretty much run a monopoly system worldwide.
[42:24.000 --> 42:37.000]  Yeah. Oh yeah. No no and I agree wholeheartedly Alex it's time you know one thing about you know when I did the three years of conspiracy theory you know it kind of labeled me and all that by the mainstream media.
[42:37.000 --> 42:50.000]  But I'll tell you I learned a lot of stuff and talked to a lot of very very interesting people in doing the three seasons of conspiracy theory and you know it really broadened my outlook on a lot of things.
[42:50.000 --> 42:58.000]  Doing it and hearing things from a different point of view and hearing people that were out were not in the mainstream.
[42:58.000 --> 43:04.000]  So it was a great learning experience and we were happy to have you on board for a few of those episodes.
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.000]  You were what did we used to refer to you again from Starsky and Hutch.
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  What was the black character again.
[43:10.000 --> 43:11.000]  Huggy Bear.
[43:11.000 --> 43:12.000]  Huggy Bear. Yeah.
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  Remember we used to call you Huggy Bear.
[43:14.000 --> 43:23.000]  Well I really enjoyed doing the show as well and it didn't matter it got top ratings they actually censored some of the more hardcore episodes that dealt with continuity of government.
[43:23.000 --> 43:35.000]  Now they admit plans for civil unrest and now just in the last three years since that episode aired on the police state they admit the surveillance grid they admit the threat fusion centers are federalization spy centers.
[43:35.000 --> 43:47.000]  They admit that they're training for gun confiscation they admit that they're set up an Internet kill switch a Wall Street Journal from Internet to Obama net with.
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  So do you feel vindicated.
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.000]  A and then B Jesse why do you think so much is coming out now.
[43:53.000 --> 44:00.000]  Alex I kind of wanted I kind of want people to refer to me now as the prophet.
[44:00.000 --> 44:05.000]  Well yeah sure I guess we've all been warning.
[44:05.000 --> 44:10.000]  Yeah I mean I gotta laugh because the very things how about the how about the redacted stuff on 9 11.
[44:10.000 --> 44:16.000]  I remember going through utter hell because I was questioning there had to be more than 9 11.
[44:16.000 --> 44:26.000]  You went to Congress you pointed out the Saudi connection you talked to the experts absolutely that 9 11 episode is incredible and now it's all just out in the open.
[44:26.000 --> 44:36.000]  Yeah now it's in the open and and and everything that we were saying back then is coming to be the truth how about the places when they took me to Kansas.
[44:36.000 --> 44:47.000]  And they took me to these old missile sites where they're building the underground condominiums that hit mainstream a couple months ago that indeed it's happening and it's.
[44:47.000 --> 45:02.000]  This and that you can buy into them I think for 1.3 million you can have a condominium and we covered that in the show years ago so I'm sitting back laughing going you know conspiracy theory really was ahead of its time wasn't it.
[45:02.000 --> 45:07.000]  And that's a problem they have Jesse again Governor Jesse Ventura joins us.
[45:07.000 --> 45:29.000]  Looking at this whole situation we see CNBC MSNBC getting rid of a bunch of their crew MSNBC CNN's ratings are literally collapsed that's it's nonexistent from their great days Fox is slumping as well but not comparatively but mainstream media itself is in decline while alternative new media is exploding.
[45:29.000 --> 45:44.000]  What do you expect the establishments move to be well obviously they're gonna try to censor the Internet and they've got experts in the news today saying this new FCC take over the web to quote protect it will totally screw it up and bring censorship governor.
[45:44.000 --> 45:55.000]  Well and that's what we've got to fight against the way they ought to do it is they should they should move their shows over to the Internet and and let those that want to see them see them.
[45:55.000 --> 46:08.000]  You know ultimately everything comes down to the public's choice I remember when there used to be all the talk on censorship and what kids should see when I was governing what they shouldn't see and I remember always telling people.
[46:08.000 --> 46:14.000]  There's something called the on off switch and there's something called you can change the channel.
[46:14.000 --> 46:36.000]  And ultimately that's what it comes down to his personal responsibility and personal viewership if mainstream media is not delivering what the public wants and needs the public's going to look other places for it and you would think they would adapt so the adaptation has to come from them because as you said Alex we're winning we're
[46:36.000 --> 46:55.000]  gaining and we're winning and so they've got to adapt to it now if there's if they do it the honest way they'll get into our type of media and try to win people over or they'll do it the dishonest way and that is paying off the politicians legislating and bringing the government into it to censor us.
[46:55.000 --> 47:02.000]  So I kind of vote they'll make the move to the second alternative not the first one although they should take the first option first.
[47:02.000 --> 47:19.000]  Undoubtedly I mean it's now here bipartisan Republicans and Democrats working together from Internet to Obama net and we've got the former FCC chief saying he's shocked by Fed's attempts the articles on screen to regulate Internet the order goes far beyond protecting net neutrality.
[47:19.000 --> 47:30.000]  What a perfect cover though say you're going to protect that neutrality that most of us support and you're keeping it open and free but then actually using it to bring in Sopa and Syspa style controls.
[47:30.000 --> 47:39.000]  See Alex you know what I how I saw through that they have already got plenty antitrust laws on the books.
[47:39.000 --> 47:47.000]  All they have to do is apply right law laws that existed before the Internet antitrust laws were here before the Internet.
[47:47.000 --> 47:54.000]  All they need they don't need to pass any new controls just apply antitrust laws to the Internet.
[47:54.000 --> 48:02.000]  Don't let one or two corporations take it over in a monopoly. It's no different than any other business out there.
[48:02.000 --> 48:07.000]  They always do ask these new laws. They've got laws in place Alex.
[48:07.000 --> 48:17.000]  Well you know that trick as a former mayor and then a governor of a major state where they won't fill the potholes and then they'll demand more taxes to fix that when they just wasted a huge budget.
[48:17.000 --> 48:24.000]  The exact same thing they say ISIS and Al Qaeda are allowed to recruit on Facebook and Twitter so pass laws to censor everybody's free speech.
[48:24.000 --> 48:31.000]  Well I get censored on Facebook and Twitter for just peaceful speech. Your TV shows have been erased off Tivo and off time Warner.
[48:31.000 --> 48:40.000]  You've been openly censored. I've been openly censored. They've censored Navy SEALs families questioning the official story of their deaths and they've been lauding raids.
[48:40.000 --> 48:49.000]  So they're already censoring stuff that shouldn't be censored. So these claims that we need new laws to stop ISIS recruiting they're letting ISIS recruit.
[48:49.000 --> 48:58.000]  I want to segue into that. You were on a year I mean a year ago two years ago every time you've been on and you can go back to Internet if you want first.
[48:58.000 --> 49:04.000]  And you talked about how it's a false flag. They're funding ISIS. They're funding Al Qaeda. This is all stage is going to be a wider war.
[49:04.000 --> 49:13.000]  Now again that's all official. We're being told brace for the malls to be attacked. A Mall of America where you're from up there in Minneapolis St. Paul.
[49:13.000 --> 49:20.000]  And then J. Johnson says or give me more funding. I can keep you safe. How transparent does that have to get.
[49:20.000 --> 49:30.000]  Well it's you know the whole thing. I'll go back into history. Let's go back to the Iraq war and put blame where it's belongs which is what you never hear out of our country.
[49:30.000 --> 49:40.000]  One thing about the United States you can bank on and take it home. We will never admit to a mistake. We will never admit that we made the wrong move.
[49:40.000 --> 49:51.000]  And the wrong move I'm talking about was the original invasion of Iraq. Going back to that. Do you think for one minute ISIS would exist today if Saddam were alive.
[49:51.000 --> 50:06.000]  Do you think ISIS would exist if Gaddafi were alive. No those those countries over there can only survive having a dictator someone with a powerful position to keep the peace and keep everything in line.
[50:06.000 --> 50:17.000]  The United States invades the country. Gaddafi gets taken out. We take out Saddam. It throws the whole thing into unrest. It throws the whole thing up into the wind.
[50:17.000 --> 50:27.000]  Which I have to believe Alex's was their intention. They wanted to make the Middle East unstable. By the way Wesley Clark just came out. I don't know if you've seen this clip down in Mexico.
[50:27.000 --> 50:42.000]  It just came out two days ago. I try to queue it up guys for later. He said that Western governments are behind a destabilization campaign and he's basically seen the documents just like he exposed the seven country plan that they plan to invade.
[50:42.000 --> 50:53.000]  Yeah. No. I can't believe that this is an all part of a grandmaster plan to keep the place of unstable so that we will be at perennial war. That's right.
[50:53.000 --> 51:05.000]  And the only way to keep us at perennial war is to bring the war home with these threats that ISIS is going to attack us in America. They're going to attack us in America.
[51:05.000 --> 51:17.000]  So therefore we need to fight them over there. It to me it is it goes back to Smedley Butler war is a racket and we're involved in the biggest racket of all right now.
[51:17.000 --> 51:27.000]  And that's these wars in the Middle East. We can solve them all. ISIS won't be a problem. Let's do it. Ronald Reagan did. Let's do it.
[51:27.000 --> 51:38.000]  Ronald Reagan did when the car bomb attacked the Marines in Lebanon and killed 100 brave Marines over there. Did Ronald Reagan go to war. No.
[51:38.000 --> 51:47.000]  Ronald Reagan got the hell out of there. Yeah. Let people kill each other. That's not our issue. Well today it's called cutting and running.
[51:47.000 --> 51:58.000]  Ronald Reagan the pinnacle of the Republican Party cut and ran. But I agree with Ronald Reagan. He made the right decision. Let's make the right decision and get the hell out of there.
[51:58.000 --> 52:07.000]  Let them decide for themselves who's going to govern who over there. It's so unstable now. It's a regional thing and we got no business over there Alex.
[52:07.000 --> 52:19.000]  Well the plan is destabilization just like Ukraine. It's it's the same global chessboard. You know you've read Brzezinski's book grand chessboard. They admit this whole plan. That's what's so incredibly frustrating about that.
[52:19.000 --> 52:32.000]  But expanding on this speaking of propaganda wars. You have spoken out and I like you to elaborate on it. I don't know if you've seen American sniper yet. I know you've read the book for those that don't know.
[52:32.000 --> 52:47.000]  No no no. The only part of that book I've read is my chapter. I didn't need to read anymore. Mine was completely fabricated and it destroyed. I didn't care to read anymore. I have not seen the movie and I've only read one chapter of the book.
[52:47.000 --> 53:03.000]  Well the movie from what I know I mean and from what's admitted is is is largely cobbled together truths and half truths and then outright fabrications.
[53:03.000 --> 53:18.000]  It's Hollywoodized you know they're gonna they do it with a purpose like I put it into the best quote I think Alex I said it's a propaganda movie with the same and it's as authentic as dirty Harry.
[53:18.000 --> 53:23.000]  Well I know you're a big fan because a lot of times we're hanging out we've talked about.
[53:23.000 --> 53:33.000]  You've told me you're a fan of Clint Eastwood. I mean what has this changed your view or do you just think Clint thought it was a neat book and wanted to make a war movie.
[53:33.000 --> 53:46.000]  You know I don't know what Clint you know Clint's in the business to make movies that's what he does. It disappointed me that Clint did it but you know it's not my you know Clint's going to do what he wants to do.
[53:46.000 --> 54:00.000]  But I the point I make about it being dirty Harry is this dirty Harry's a fabrication. You know you can't go to San Francisco and look up dirty Harry Callahan in their police and see that he was a police officer there because he wasn't.
[54:00.000 --> 54:12.000]  And that's the point I made about the movie and the fact that Clint directed it so it's it's a propaganda movie with as authentic as dirty Harry which means it's not authentic at all.
[54:12.000 --> 54:21.000]  Absolutely right down to fake babies expanding on that. Would you have been upset if they would have thrown in you getting beaten up in the movie.
[54:21.000 --> 54:37.000]  That was one of the reasons it forced me into court. People need to understand this that they would not talk about restoring my reputation in the four settlement official settlement conferences we had.
[54:37.000 --> 54:48.000]  The others the Kyle side immediately stated we won't admit the fabrication and we will do nothing to restore your reputation we will only talk money.
[54:48.000 --> 54:58.000]  I refused because the this trial for me was not about money. It was about the truth and restoring my reputation so they forced me to go to court.
[54:58.000 --> 55:10.000]  The mainstream media portrayed it Alex as you know I was going after the widow and the children of the war hero and not you know what I'd like to say Alex let's have fun with this for a moment.
[55:10.000 --> 55:17.000]  Let's go back because I know you understand history well and I'll and I'll quiz you on this this will be a good one.
[55:17.000 --> 55:23.000]  Let's go back to the late 30s early 40s when Nazi Germany invaded Poland right.
[55:23.000 --> 55:33.000]  OK. Let's go back to there. They invade Poland. They overthrow its government. They occupy them during the occupation.
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.000]  They also torture Polish people right. Yes.
[55:37.000 --> 55:56.000]  Now if a Nazi soldier during this invasion and occupation were to have killed 150 or 160 Polish people a Nazi sniper would that sniper be viewed as a hero by the Nazis he would but not by the allies.
[55:56.000 --> 56:09.000]  OK. Just wanted to hear your opinion on that. So in other words a hero is in the eye of the beholder. So people of the United States are comfortable with the fact that we invaded a country.
[56:09.000 --> 56:22.000]  We occupied that country and we tortured the people of that country. And during all of this some of our women and men in the military doing their jobs killed vast amounts of people in that country.
[56:22.000 --> 56:32.000]  That makes them heroes. Well I'll say this. What would Americans do if we got invaded by a foreign army. Yes. We would be called terrorist.
[56:32.000 --> 56:40.000]  And we would be called insurgents and we'd be terrorists and we'd be a good point Alex. What would happen hypothetically. That's phenomenal.
[56:40.000 --> 56:52.000]  If the United States were invaded and somebody from the invading side killed 150 of us would that person be considered a hero.
[56:52.000 --> 57:03.000]  Well it's just the classic cowboy story of the Texan out there fighting wanting to do it for his country but not happy about killing people.
[57:03.000 --> 57:13.000]  We know from Kyle's own statements that he loved it. So that's my problem. Eastwood should have shown him calling him you know rag heads and all these other racist terms.
[57:13.000 --> 57:25.000]  They should have shown him getting off on it. They should have shown all that and shown the real thing not the other thing. And what's sad here is Saudi Arabia we now know quarterback 9 11.
[57:25.000 --> 57:31.000]  We go attack their enemy Iraq. Iraq didn't do anything. And so that's what makes this so evil. Jesse.
[57:31.000 --> 57:44.000]  Exactly. I agree with you Alex. You know when I made this statement I think I said it on on on Alan Combs radio show as a veteran.
[57:44.000 --> 57:53.000]  They they destroyed my American dream with Iraq because I never believed in my heart and my mother and father were both W W two vets.
[57:53.000 --> 58:08.000]  And I never believed in all my heart that I would see the United States line up our military at another sovereign nations border lie to us giving us reasons why they should go in that we would invade a country
[58:08.000 --> 58:22.000]  overthrow its government and occupy the country and then worst of all torture people torture people and then and then we nobody in this country will admit that what we did in Iraq was so wrong.

[59:37.000 --> 59:57.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show big brother mainstream media government cover ups you want answers.
[59:57.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas. Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  Here's Wesley Clark just a few days ago former top NATO general talking about how our allies are involved with ISIS and funding them. Here's the clip.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  Look I just got started through funding from our friends and allies because his people will tell you in the region if you want somebody who will fight to the death against his blog.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  You don't put out a recruiting poster and say you know sign up for us. We're going to make a better world. You go after zealots and you go after these religious fundamentalists.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  That's who fights his blog. But general I'm hearing you like a Frankenstein. OK.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  And then they go on from there. But for five years they've been fighting the Free Syrian Army. Two years ago our own military came out.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  So we're not going to be their air force. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul to their credit came out and said that so they just changed the name.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  And Jesse Ventura was here at the time predicting and breaking it down accurately. We were as well. We've been proven right yet again.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  And I'm not bragging. It's not that hard to figure this out once you understand the paradigm of how this works.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  And now these groups are set to attack us and they'll try to take our liberties. Governor Ventura. This is a short segment long segment coming up but finishing up with terrorism.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  I'm really concerned about a major event here so they can finish their police state. Well I am too. You know I you know will that event be a false flag operation.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  Who will really be running it to make it happen. And I fear it also. I've also said that another one's going to happen. And you know to me the Boston Marathon was a practice run through where they brought in the federal troops to
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  come and told people to stay in their homes and all that stuff like like a martial law type situation. And certainly if we do get hit with something say hopefully not at the Mall of America but if they do get hit in some type of situation like that.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  You can bet the government's going to step in and go through a lockdown procedure and it's going to depend on whether the American people accept that type of are they willing to give up their freedoms for safety.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  Let me ask you this question. And I'm not. I'm not either. Let me ask you this question. Obviously they're worried about economic collapse other issues but why are the people that run this country
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  accelerating classical police state. Why do they want it in place and why are they pointing it at the American people. Because it's power because it's you know the separation between the wealthy and the poor.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  It may be part of the of the globalization you talk about Alex because they can't put us on power with Mexico till they destroy the middle class. That's right.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  Then you'll then you'll have rich and then you'll have poor. And that's basically what Mexico has rich and poor. You know and and then they can put us on the all the same currency like they've done to Europe.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  You know and then it'll work here to then I guess. And so who and one thing in order to accomplish that they have to destroy our bill of rights.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  Because Mexico and other countries don't have bills of rights and we do or we used to. I would question whether we actually do today or not. I don't know because it's being violated constantly.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  That's why I urge I tell people young men and women that are enlisting in the military service. I always tell them remember you're taking an oath to protect the Constitution and Bill of Rights from all enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  Never forget that. Never forget the oath to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. That's right. There's a bunch of issues I want to get into in the 25 minutes we have left when we go to break.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  But you're kind of making my case for me about Constitution. Government can't act unilaterally. And you know you basically don't want to be a third world country like Mexico.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  I'm not against the immigrants and we'll debate when we come back briefly or longer if you want. It's that they're being used as a tool to drive down wages and as a new Democratic voting block.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  The Democrats admit this to vote for gun control and things. So I'm not against the immigrants. I'm against how they're geopolitically being used. So Governor will come back to you on the other side. Jesse Ventura.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  And I'll kind of restate that for stations that join us. And then you can give me your take on it. So we'll briefly debate that. And then it's a wild card. I'm going to ask Governor Ventura what he thinks is important and get into some of the subjects he wants to cover.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  He's been a radio talk show host longer than I am. So I'm sure he can direct the show. Stay with us.

[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  They've come out and said the government of Iraq we know you're really behind it in Saudi Arabia.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  You've got there two days left until this incredibly important piece of legislation will be voted on that will change the web forever and no one has even seen the FCC's 332-page regulation plan.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  That's an article up on InfoWars.com and you've got these different Pacific partnerships and deals that are secret that Congress can't even see.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  I mean talk about global government we're in it we're going to talk about that in a moment with Jesse Ventura and Jesse I found nine times out of ten we don't really disagree on things and it's fine to disagree.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  We just have different perspectives I get hardworking immigrants are what made this country I get that you live down in Mexico at least four or five months out of the year in Baja and you like it and you like the people.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  And I understand the US already under the age of about 12 is half Hispanic so America is is a Hispanic nation the United States it's going to be more so white people and blacks don't have babies whatever I don't care I like quote Hispanics.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  Okay my issue is that the Ford Foundation the globalist are pushing for open borders Obama's doing it without Congress most the Republican leadership wanted as well they get here was in CBS News.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  They order the police to not even arrest the illegals for drunk driving so they get all this extra welfare they can come from China women come here CNN reported and have their babies and we pay for them.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  Nobody else does that Jesse so I'm saying I'm not against the Emirates I know if people are here hardworking we should have find a way.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  Pathward citizenship but instead I see the whole police state only for citizens is Ron Paul said the fence is to keep us in not the illegals out and I see this entitlement.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  Of the illegals that they should get everything for free that's my issue and I think the border being pretty much open in many areas shows the war on tears of fraud.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  So that's my two minutes had to head with Jesse Ventura live on immigration explain your position and any counter arguments you have a governor.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  Well the problems this if those things are going on Alex then blame our Democrats and Republicans and our politicians for creating programs that can be so easily abused.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  I agree how hard how hard can it be to say you have to be a citizen in which to get welfare seems pretty straightforward to me but they create a system that can be looped all the time.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  And then when somebody loops it we always blame the person that loops the system blame the people that created the system now in speaking about freedom.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  OK I'll give it to you from a different perspective let's say I'm a business owner and what I'm involved in I hire people I do the proper thing I deduct taxes properly the whole ball of wax.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  Why shouldn't I have the freedom to hire who I want and why should being a citizen have any part of it.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  I mean if I wanted to get roofers or people that work with cement I guarantee you I'm going to look for Mexican people because they when they do cement they're not cement workers they're artists I've watched them and they they're remarkable.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  And if you look at any roofing crew in America today at least up in Minnesota they're all Hispanic on those roofs.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  So if you're don't you shouldn't an employer have the freedom to hire who they want to can get the job done. And as long as they deduct properly those people can't even get a tax refund.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  They work and it goes into the taxes and it you know they don't get refunded any of the money that's being that's being changed.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  What about doing the right thing. See if the employers are not doing the right thing which are United States people and they're not deducting taxes and they're not doing it on the up and up well then they're the ones to blame not the worker.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  Well I don't sit there and hate people from Latin America that want a better life.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  I know that Alex I'm just giving you my opinion that freedom also should be the freedom to hire who I want to find the United States businessman and why should being a citizen be part of it.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  Why why why does US citizenship have anything to do with who I would hire to get the job done.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  But listen what I'm getting at and your points are valid I can't go to Mexico and have a baby and have it paid for for free they'd laugh at me.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  So this whole system is being exploited by design for corporate welfare and hospital welfare.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  Get the people who wrote the laws.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  I agree.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  Blame the Democrats and Republicans don't blame the person who uses the law to their advantage.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  Sure.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  Blame the people who did the law that allows it to be taken advantage of.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  Well I do.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  Right back to the Democrats and Republicans.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  Yes and that's why I'm trying to block their latest agendas that are just more of the same and then they always make it about hey don't be mean to the immigrants.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  Well I mean come on so many of the immigrants are fleeing criminal past they can come up here and use any ID they want.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  I mean in California they're giving the illegals driver's license and then they can vote.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  Should illegals who aren't citizens be able to vote.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  No.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  And I don't believe they are.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  We did we have as much immigration as anybody in the nation up in Minnesota and we did a huge study when I was up there on campaign fraud voter fraud.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  It's so minute.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  That's the biggest red herring out there that people are committing vote.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  What criminal you ever met a criminal that says you know what it's November.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  I think that means voter fraud.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  I'm going to go vote illegally.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  Well I don't think of the classic illegals as criminals just because they're violating federal law and breaking a law.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  But the Democrats are organizing them and they are voting.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  Nobody commits voter fraud.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  It's that's a red herring out there.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  That's a red herring.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  We did a study when I was governor.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  It was you couldn't have won an election on voter fraud in Minnesota.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  There weren't enough.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  Jesse that was in your state and what 15 years ago or 12 14 years ago.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  They're now just giving them driver's license and letting them vote in California and they don't have to take a driver's test.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  They don't have to get behind the wheel.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  No they give it to them.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  I mean yes they go take the test.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  They don't.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  So they don't have to do nothing.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  They just show up and they hand them a driver's.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  No they go and they take the driver's test.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  And that's California's fault that should be dealt with by the state of California not the federal government because the federal government has nothing to do.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  Listen I agree with you we need immigrants in this country but we don't need mothers with no skills with three kids who are immediately signed on to welfare the day they get here.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  Well I'm only laughing because I'm thinking back to when I was governor and I met the we were putting the budget together and all the welfare protesters were out in front of the Capitol and I remember I went down to talk to them which no governor had ever done.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  And I remember a woman with her baby yelling at me that I was responsible for her and her child and I remember looking at her and saying well where's your husband and she said he ran off.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  And I looked at her and I said well so I'm responsible because you married a bum.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  Somehow it comes to my responsibility and I remember Rush Limbaugh I was his hero for like 30 days you know this new independent governor who said this.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  The point I'm making is that our system is violated because the people that make the system allow it to be violated.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  So if you want the system to not be violated you have to blame the people that created for allowing that to happen.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  Don't blame the people that find the loopholes. Find the people that allowed the loopholes in the first place.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  I totally agree with what you're saying but they can just take what I say or you say out of context and we need to get the public focused on actually stopping all these different loopholes and dealing with a special interest.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  Let's shift gears.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  You know it's so weird Alex.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  I cross the border every year twice and when I go into Mexico sometimes there's nobody even there.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  I mean I've actually stopped my vehicle and rolled my windows down and said well doesn't somebody at least say Buenos Dias and hand you a piece of paper.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  No they're not worried that I'm coming into their country they care I got pesos I'm going to spend some and it's going to spur the economy yet when I turn around and come back into my own country.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  My country I've had times where seven lanes of traffic I've had to wait three hours in the blistering 99 degree where I've seen where I can prove to you that global warming and climate change is real because while I'm sitting in my pickup truck.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  The temperatures gone from 99 degrees in the desert all the way to 116 while I'm simply waiting to cross into my country which repels me like I'm some sort of rabid monster.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  And then you know what the first thing they ask you Alex when you come back to your own country you know what the first question is.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  What is it without a doubt I can forbade him how long have you been in Mexico and I think to myself how is that any of your business whether I'm in Mexico one day or whether I went there for nine months it's really none of your business how long I've been in
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  Mexico I have a legitimate passport this is my country I'm coming back to my country why do you need to know how long I've been in Mexico.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  Jesse Ventura is our guest it's funny you bring up climate change because it is a very seriously complex issue and we come back from break I want to cover this is our final subject.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  Obviously there's weather manipulation going on but when we say global warming now they're saying climate change period that we're denying that climate change is always happening.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  No one denies that there aren't heat sinks in cities with all the engines and all the concrete that doesn't go up 510 degrees.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  What we're saying is their solution to it is global taxation regulation so I want to get your view on that and this London Guardian article from February 15 spy agencies fund climate research in hunt for weather weapon.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  What I'm concerned about is they're already manipulating the weather that's admitted and weaponizing it will be back with our final segment with Jesse Ventura.

[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  We get that question a lot here at big Berkey water filters dot com and in a word the answer is protection.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell and all forms of fluoride.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  Plus big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood and prevention of disease.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease and a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product. I've taken whey protein products for years and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life. Within a few days of taking one whey whey I noticed a dramatic change.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  Also in the past few years I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes. I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  But I've noticed in the past week or so I'm not feeling bad anymore and the foot pain is gone.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  I'm just finishing up the 5 pound top I ordered and just got off the phone ordering more. I love your product. Thank you.

[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  Again I'm Alex Jones coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  So we went to break spy agencies fund climate research in hunt for weather weapons scientists fears.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  U.S. expert Alan Roebuck raises concerns over who would control climate altering technologies if research is paid for by intelligence agencies.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  Well it's already going on. Billions a year by the Department of Energy, HAARP and others. You've been to HAARP, you've investigated it.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  The Russians, folks in Dubai, they admit they can already control the weather.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  I've had the former head of weather weapons for the U.S. government been living since then on.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  They were controlling and steering and killing hurricanes back in the 60s.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  Now what do you think is really going on with the weather Jesse Ventura and all these earthquakes we're seeing in Miami and in Oklahoma?
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  What's going on?
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  Well part of that's fracking. You know, fracking is causing earthquakes. We know that for a fact.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  But what's going on? They're violating treaty agreements. They're signed treaties that nobody can use the weather for war.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  That's right.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  And yet here we are violating them behind the back and nobody's going to do anything about it anywhere in the world.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  You know, I don't know what to say about it. It's ridiculous. You start messing with mother nature and mother nature is going to come back and bite you.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  What are you most concerned about in the world? I mean, do you think humanity is going to survive?
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  Well, I want to believe it is. But I'll tell you what, I've been down here in the Baha now for 10 years.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  And maybe some of it's due to the hurricane that hit here, which was devastating earlier this past fall.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  But out where I live, Alex, I'm not seeing the fish this year like I've seen them in past years.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  There's no sardine swarms that I'd see five or six of them a day, these hot spots of sardines. I'm not seeing that anymore.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  There's nothing dead on the beaches anymore. You can't be dead on the beach if nothing in the water is alive.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  That's right. And Fukushima started melting down again this week. And that's what we've got in mainline scientific reports.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  They're saying much of the Northern Pacific is dead in a doornail.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  Well, I don't know what the whales are here. I will say that the whales are surviving. I'm seeing plenty of whales.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  But I'm worried about the other things I'm not seeing. I'm not seeing a lot of seagulls, which are not seagulls.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  But what's the ones that's pelicans pelicans? There you go. I'm not seeing I used to see them.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  They were like fighter formations down here. You'd see five or six a day with 20 of them in a group, flying in formation.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  Unbelievable. Today I see a single pelican here and there. I finally saw a couple of formations the other day.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  So I don't know if the hurricane threw everything off here or I don't know. And I'll tell you what's going on down here.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  It isn't the sport fishing. It isn't the Mexicans in their bonka boats fishing. They've been doing it for years.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  It's these trawlers. They're out at night. I see them. They're five abreast. They drag these nets and they literally sweep the bottom of everything that exists.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  Well, that's a big part of it. You know about a real environmental crisis.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  Overfishing is devastating fish populations worldwide and something needs to be done about it. That is a real environmental crisis in my view.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  Yeah. I mean, I'm living it down here. Alex, I didn't think in one decade I would see the change down here that I've seen in one decade as far as the wildlife goes in the ocean down here.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  Well, I'll tell you, it is. Remember, this is the place Jacques Cousteau. Jacques Cousteau bought the Calypso his ship here, parked it here for two to three years and said this is paradise.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  I don't think he might say that today. Wow. Real environmental crisis. Undoubtedly humans are causing some big problems, but the globalists just use that to divert us off into things that give them more power and don't fix the problems.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  Oh, Alex, always remember what one of my heroes, George Carlin said. You know why we're here, don't you humans on earth? Well, the earth needed plastic.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  You know, the earth can produce anything else. The one thing the earth cannot produce is plastic. So that's the reason humans came because humans know how to make plastic and the earth needed plastic.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  Because other than that, we are simply a consumer. We do. We give nothing back. We only take.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  Well, if you look out in the Pacific, they say that there is a garbage island bigger than Texas floating out off the coast of the United States in between Japan.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:08.000]  Imagine if that thing ever comes ashore. Governor Ventura, I'm not kissing your butt. It is like the fountain of youth down there. You look like you lost 15, 20 pounds. You look 10 years younger. What are you doing?
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  Well, I do a four mile walk every morning in the desert with four pound weights on each ankle.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  And you're doing some surfing?
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  Well, I'm getting them in. I'm doing a lot of old dumbbell training. You know, I don't have all the mechanized machines off the grid. We're ducking and hiding from the drones all the time. That's why Abraham's always dirty.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  Jesse, we're out of time. Thanks for joining us.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  All right, Alex, we'll see you next time.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  Thanks a lot, buddy. There goes Jesse Ventura on our show.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day. Big heart shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:58.000]  What if we the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000]  I'm all about human potential. I'm all about the individual being empowered. The establishment is the opposite.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers and the rest of the garbage.

[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  BodyArmer.com Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmer.com Infidel BodyArmer just won't quit.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  Well ladies and gentlemen, the FCC is coming in to regulate the internet.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  They've got legislation they're trying to ram through in the next two days. The former FCC head calls it just over the top censorship and draconian.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  We need to talk about that. We've got some good news as well. Montana House Judiciary Committee pushes back against Agenda 21.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  We've got, of course, what I was just mentioning, from internet to obama net, blackberries and AT&T are already making moves that could exploit new utility regulations.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  It's on. Obama's regs will make the internet slow as in Europe warns FCC, FEC commissioners, Republican FCC commissioner ask Wheeler to delay net neutrality vote release proposal.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  That's right, the 322 pages is secret. That's from CBS News. It is secret, ladies and gentlemen. Since when do free countries continually have everything secret?
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  You've got these Asian partnerships and trans union partnerships and North American union partnerships and all these different agreements that are secret.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  And then pieces of it get leaked and it's just so draconian.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  Number five years ago, the Copenhagen Treaty, they're trying to get global carbon taxes and they wouldn't release it. Well, it got leaked. They confirmed. Yes, that's the Danish text.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  So they called it because it was a version in Danish translated Lord Monk and basically got it. We had him on first and I popped champagne on air.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  Because it was it was just devastating that that came out on the heels that same week of climate gate with the top UN professors.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  They're in England at the university that were managing over 200 major colleges worldwide to hide the decline and engage in systematic cover up.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  Does that mean I want to eat GMO? Does that mean I want to drink mercury and lead the water supply? Does that mean I want every fish in the ocean caught and, you know, trolled?
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  Does that mean I want GMO salmon four times bigger that will extinct the regular salmon population within 40 generations according to major studies?
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  Does that mean I want that in the water? Does that mean I want spider goats roaming around in the in the forest?
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  They're part spider. I mean, we know some of the spider goats have already gotten out, by the way, in New York and other states where they're producing them.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  Animals always end up getting out, especially goats. You can't keep them pinned up.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  They can climb trees. Not kidding. They will climb a tree over the fence and jump out of a tree to go to the San Antonio Zoo that climbed trees. But it's a side issue. What I'm getting at is this earth is being annihilated right now.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  It's being chewed up destroyed by the very people that grandstand and say, we're not worried about GMO. We're not worried about overfishing. We're not worried about all this stuff.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  We're not going to let people out west cut dead trees down and create fire breaks. So when there is a lightning strike, millions of acres burn down instead of humans being good stewards.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  Because when humans are good stewards and care about the land, it creates OACs that animals absolutely thrive in. Humans can make things better and do.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  But that's not happening because they've made everything environmental about a global government that taxes carbon dioxide that's part of the four legs of life.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  Sunlight, water, CO2 and O2 oxygen. Four things. Water, sunlight, oxygen and carbon dioxide. If you don't have those, death. No life on this planet, baby. And what's king of those? The sun.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  It doesn't matter if you have CO2, oxygen and water. If you don't have the sun, no life. So sun is a numero uno. And then you got to have the other three. They're all paramount together.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  They're all co-equal like the three branches of government. You got to have those three. And they are saying we're going to track, we're going to tax, we're going to surveil, we're going to curtail.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  Carbon, all carbon, including carbon dioxide. If you increase carbon dioxide, just a few sub-percentage points, not even a percentage point, just a few, few fractionable points, the studies are out there.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  Plants live longer and grow up to three times faster. Don't believe me? Just type in plants grow faster, higher yields with higher carbon dioxide. They've done literally thousands of published studies in the last 100 years.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  In Germany, the U.S., Japan, you name it, in controlled greenhouses, pumping carbon dioxide in.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  They've done studies next to power plants that have carbon dioxide and water vapor coming out. What do you think happens to trees downwind from that?
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  They found statistically they grow faster. And anybody can search into the fact that if we just had a fraction of higher carbon dioxide, they predict that the Sahara would come back.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  And they've gone and done core samples in the Sahara deep and found that just, it depends on the numbers you look at, but less than 10,000 years ago, it was a green oasis with huge crocodiles running around and jungles and just life everywhere.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  And that carbon dioxide's been dropping until recent times and it's directly correlated. We're at one of the lowest levels of carbon dioxide in the history of this planet that is undisputed.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  Do I want more oxygen? You bet. Do I want more carbon dioxide? You bet. Do I want more water? You bet.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  For life on this planet, do I want more sunlight? During higher sun cycles, when it's putting out more heat, more radiation, there's more life on this planet, more plankton.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  That means more carbon dioxide, which means more oxygen.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  Daily Mail. Carbon dioxide emissions help tropical rainforests grow faster. Study shows trees absorb more greenhouse gases than expected. NASA study shows tropical forests absorb 1.5 billion tons of CO2 a year. Rainforests absorb more than half the CO2 taken up by vegetation globally.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  Scientists have previously believed tropical forests emitted carbon dioxide.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  We were talking about cutting the rainforest down five years ago to stop and this is how crazy they are. That's like burning your lungs up with acid and putting space mirrors up.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  Just please. I saw a Sahara study that was in association with the Smithsonian Institute.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  There's another one. Carbon dioxide, the gas of life, tiny amounts of this miracle molecule make life on earth possible. A special report by the committee for a constructive tomorrow.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  That's probably some oil company funded deal if you actually just drill into the real studies out there.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  But again, you've got the biggest oil companies, BP, ExxonMobil and Dutch Roll Shell, they give the majority of the pro-carbon taxing money in the world.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  Look it up. Goldman Sachs gives the most money for gun control, open borders, anti-family initiatives. Just look it up.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  BMW gives tens of millions to try to open our borders. I mean, just any of these companies you pick, just go look into it. The mischief they're involved in.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  Oh, and by the way, hundreds of companies are pouring just huge amounts of money into Hillary Clinton right now. It should be illegal.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  All these foreign interests, but if Dinesh D'Souza gets five of his friends to give $30,000 in combined, then it's questionable he goes to jail for nine months.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  But Hillary, she could sit up there and just take all the foreign government money she wants. And the reason I mention all this is snow on the ground in 48 states, USA Today.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  USA Today also reported record low since 1960 for the number of tornadoes in the United States. But you tune into the news, it's like tornadoes, deadly weather.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  It's on the rise because of human activity. Meanwhile, there's huge secret weather modification programs going on.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  And we talked to meteorologists. It appears they're designed to create drought.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  You'll have huge wet weather systems coming into the West Coast, and then just suddenly 100 planes will take off, fly back and forth, spring, aluminum dioxide, barium salts and other things blocking the rain, making it go into the ocean.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  I mean, we're getting hit. We're getting hit hard. Guaranteed we're under weather war attack.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  I mean, this is just cuckoo for cocoa puffs.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  Snow is on the ground in 48 states, according to three separate national snow cover maps. Florida has no snow on the ground, according to all the maps, one of which can be seen.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  But the three maps looked at don't agree on snow free state. It could be South Carolina, it could be Louisiana or possibly Mississippi.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  And those states see snow. But regardless of whether the three states have shown the ground now or not, or some snow is forecast this fall, this week or all of them, Florida will remain the lone holdout as no snow is predicted there.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  Ladies said snow there a month ago. And yes, I had to look at the webcams in Hawaii where they had snow a month ago to see that patch of snow is there atop the high mountain located in a lower state.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  And then it just goes through the fact that at least 48 states have snow right now unprecedented.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  Here's another article out of Michigan live.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  And Arbor breaks record low temperature set in 1900 115 years ago. Liberian Megan Heartline makes her way across the diet at the University of Michigan and Arbor. There's a photo caption there.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  I was reading the temperature in an Arbor was minus seven to the University of Michigan weather observer Dennis call bomb. It was still falling at that point.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  It was already low enough to break the previous record low of minus five for February 23 shut in the date 1900 with the windshield.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  The temperature felt a good bit cooler than that a windshield advisory issue with the National Weather Service was in effect until noon.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:40.000]  Yeah, it's 30 something here in Texas. When chill values could reach 15 to minus 20 according to the advisory.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  Speaking of earthquakes probably fracking mysterious quakes rattling coral gables homes outside Miami.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  CBS Miami.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:58.000]  Here's some good news. Virginia measure could put PETA out of the animal shelter business the Washington Post.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  PETA on record kills about 90% of the animals that are brought to their bizarro shelters.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  And I know people that have worked for PETA in Virginia at their headquarters and they pressure the employees to go adopt animals.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  And then this is what I was told and I didn't believe it at the time and later it came out on the news.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  They sit there literally getting crazy looks in their eyes while they inject them.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  It's not a weirdo freak cult folks. And because they don't believe you should have a domesticated animal.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000]  It's really just a transhumanist death cult.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  So there you go. But some good news on that front. These are not really top stories. They're just they're just interesting.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  Here's the toll free number. I'm going to open the phones up right now.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  We're going to reset the phone system so that it's operable up there at the network.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:57.000]  We're going to open the phones up. The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  I want to open the phones up for first time callers today on any issue you'd like to cover on any topic you'd like to go over.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  It's a total free for all the attack on the Internet. The fact that the globalists are now moving in high gear on every front.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  On from open borders to web censorship to forced inoculations. I mean the hammer is dropping. That's really the big topic.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  Why do you think the hammer is dropping? Why are they accelerating their globalist takeover program?
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  Why are they just thrilling in everybody's face?
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  800-259-9231. 800-259-9231.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  We're going to go to break. Come back and start taking your phone calls.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  Briefly, I wanted to tell listeners, because I've been an hour and 47 minutes of news and a guest had not plugged any of our products.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  If you notice, most talk shows have plugged products' responses every segment.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  I should do that because then our funding issues would be over, but I just get so obsessed with the news I don't tend to do it enough.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:14.000]  We have life changing, in my view, products like DNA force, the Rolls-Royce of known compounds that are incredibly hard to get and incredibly expensive.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  One of the organic products in here cost us $12,000 a kilo.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  It's a Rolls-Royce nutraceutical. It's got QQ10. It's got a whole bunch of other really amazing things in it that are unprecedented.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  Stragulus root, bio-enhanced, NAR, bioptic acid, P40, palm-granted extract, Tibetan extracts.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  It's got a whole bunch of other incredible stuff.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  Bio-PQQ, that's what's really expensive, and a whole bunch of other things that have supercharged my health, my mind, my body.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  It is the Rolls-Royce product at an incredibly affordable price.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  Comparable formulas are three to six times more.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  Comparable formulas are $600.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  And I know why. In the industry, things are marked up seven times on average in the supplement industry.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  They put crap in it, and then they do marketing. We don't do that.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  We put the most expensive, high-quality products we can, and then sell them at the very lowest prices we can.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  So we've got some products that cost $14.95, like the ancient defense known, easily obtainable, high-quality organic herbs.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  And then it costs us $6, $7 a bottle, and we sell it for $14.95.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  In the industry, you do that, and you sell it for $30, or $40.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  DNA Force is like $150, but it's got stuff patented and confirmed to repair telomeres.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  I mean, you name it. This is it. Comparable stuff, $300 to $600. This is $150, and it's still marked up double.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  And your purchase funds our operation. It takes a lot of money to run this operation.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  The poor man's DNA Force is Occupower. The stuff in our Occupower eye formula is not just for the eyes.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  And I take it every day as well. DNA Force, though, and we have people on about this.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  If you've had nerve damage, like in your back, your hand, or whatever, where my finger was cut off,
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  it was still a little bit sore, even though it happened 10 years ago.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  It's not sore, and it's not numb anymore. But first, it got real numb as the nerve was growing back.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  Now, that's what this stuff's patented and known to do, but I mean, it's no joke.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  I'm not saying it'll do that for you. Consult your physician.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  But this is stuff we can actually make claims about because it's patented.
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  But that's why it's so expensive. This is the real deal.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  DNA Force, your purchase supports the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  Or we've got oil of oregano in the caplets, the best organic sourced from the Mediterranean,
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  the highest quality at an extremely low price.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  We've got our colloidal silver at $10 less than what it sold for at Whole Foods.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  We private label the same stuff they private label from the highest quality lab in the country,
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  and we sell it for $5 to $10 less, depending on what special we're running.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  Now, it's $10 less than Whole Foods, two ounce bottle of silver bullet colloidal silver.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  Topical, it could also be ingested. Consult your physician.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  We've got 20% off on DNA, 20% off on super male and super female vitality.

[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  Infowars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  How we can come together and win the human race and celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment Month.
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  We're slashing prices on infowarslife.com products like super male and super female vitality.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  The sale is only running for the month, 20% off, and there's a lot of other powerful specials at infowarslife.com.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  Infowarslife.com celebrating human potential in the month of February.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  Visit infowarslife.com to find this special and many others in the month of February.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  Again, infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  Visit infowarslife.com to find this special and many others in the month of February.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  Visit infowarslife.com to find this special and many others in the month of February.
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  I'll start going to your phone calls and going over other news we haven't hit yet.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  You can get DNA force that is the Rolls Royce at a Mercedes price.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  So it's about three or four times cheaper than the leading competitor for the best of the same thing.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  You get super male vitality at about half what the leading competitor puts out as a testosterone booster.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  And we don't advertise it as that. That's not really exactly what it even does. It just gets your glands going.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  If you want to see dramatic effect, you've heard the rave reviews from listeners.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  This is not a game. This is concentrated, cold pressed, extremely expensive product.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  Give you an example. It cost me $18 a bottle.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  And then we mark it up. We got to fund this operation and the reporters and all the bills and the rest of it.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  But other people we happen to know put like $2 in other formulas of just some really strong herb that just does one thing but has side effects.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  And they sell it for a hundred. But they'll have like movie stars out there promoting it and all the money goes into the marketing.
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  We don't do that. And that's how we fund our operation.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  So super male and super female vitality, 20% off already discounted a great time to start.
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  And quite frankly, women have an even bigger on average effect with super female than we see with super male.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  And it's about energy. It's about stamina. It's about libido.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  We've all been artificially suppressed and it's amazing what cold pressed organic herbs can do.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  So this special will end when February ends.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  We customarily go a few extra days afterwards to give stragglers a chance.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  But there's a bunch of specials, the free bottle of ancient defense for the X2, nascent iodine.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  That's going to be ending next week.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  Take infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  And a lot of guys I know like the super female rather than the super male.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  Because without going into detail, there are two ingredients in the super female that are not in the super male.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  One of them has a very obnoxious folk name. It's something goatweed.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  And it works on men and women.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  But I didn't come out with this as a herbal viagra.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  And I know folks that take viagra and they say this does a better job than viagra or Cialis.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  If I'm not comparing it to a drug, that's just what they personally tell me.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  We don't sell it as that. That's a side effect.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  It's overall increased stamina in the gym, you name it, is what I personally have experienced.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  But regardless, try it out and what do you have to lose?
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  If it doesn't work for you, we haven't found anybody yet. You've heard the callers.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  Literally no emails, no nothing. The few complaints are my bottle was broken.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  Will you send me another one? Well, of course we will.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  The customer service folks are standing by. We want to serve you.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  A, it's the right thing to do. B, we want repeat customers.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  And I had terrible customer service 10 years ago because I was a very small operation.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  It's tip top right now.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  We answer the phones until about six at night, seven days a week, right here in our offices.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  Then it goes to an answering service that are great folks as well.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  But obviously can't do as thorough a job as actual folks that have worked here for years.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  We've got some customer service people that have worked here eight years, like Michelle over there,
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  who's just been doing a fabulous job. I don't know what to say her last name.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  Probably didn't want me to. The point is, it is your purchasing of the products that makes all this possible.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  You can also call toll free and talk to the great customer service people or order via the phone.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  888-253-3139.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  And when I kind of do an elaborate plug like this, when I forget to plug for an hour and 40-something minutes,
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  to pay the bills, we call it midair refueling.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  Support those local AM and FM affiliates. Tell your friends and family to tune into the show.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000]  Support those local sponsors or become a sponsor today.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  We're doing everything we can. In fact, I got a stack of liners I'm supposed to cut for affiliates.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  I need to do that at two o'clock today before I go to all these other meetings.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  A lot of big things happening here, and it's all because of your support and your prayers.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  I salute you and want to thank you. We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  with a third hour of your phone calls and a ton of news.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:04.000]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin Jail.
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  They are never going to stop. They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  Block free iPhone app at infowars.com.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:23.000]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000]  Imperatives, Detroit, Britain, and its TV.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:30.000]  Shut your eye on the enemy. Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:59.000]  Get electorally, it's for God you can fail it.
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:04.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:11.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:16.000]  We're now into hour number three, open phones coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:21.000]  75% of air and rain samples contained on Santos Roundup.
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  That's the bad news.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:30.000]  Here's another article with the good news.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  Record US, record number of US farmers switching to non-GMO crops in 2015.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  Here's another one.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  The fall of Al Sharpton is coming close.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  Lawsuit accuses Comcast.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:46.000]  Al Sharpton are discriminating against black-owned media.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  That's what all these gangster black leaders are about.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  Al Sharpton is running rough shot over the black community and basically pimping them out to the Democratic and Republican Party.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  Al Sharpton doesn't just shake down regular media that's owned by black-white, you name it.
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  He shakes everybody down.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000]  The guy's a thug gangster.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  So that's all coming up as well.
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  Another report here.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  The spy cables are glimpsed into the world of espionage.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  Al Jazeera is set to release a bunch of international spy cables.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  I imagine those will be carefully selected and act like it's a leak to put out the image they want to put out.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000]  But we'll see what happens.
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  We've got to Amy, Charlie, Michael, Rick, Thurman and others.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  Charlie, thanks for holding.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000]  You're on the air.
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  Hello, Alan.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  How are you doing?
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  Pretty good, my friend.
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  Brother, I just want to say it's an honor to be speaking with you today, a true patriot.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  And I'm really proud to be an American.
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  And I just want to ask you a question and then make a brief comment.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  I'm going to go, please, wake up in the morning as men and women, those who have reported that terrible cause.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  How can they wake up and face the day in the morning and then set about the job of destroying the American dream like they're doing?
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  I just don't understand it.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  Well, it's the same way that people can sell each other into slavery.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  Who was it? Joshua's family sold him into slavery.
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  It's the same reason that we've done all these evil things where we abort our babies.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  They just dehumanize us.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  They see themselves as the ruling class and they don't want to have an economy based on freedom anymore.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  They have the rationale that it's bad for the earth for us to be wealthy, which they could argue.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  But they should just argue for cleaner technologies instead.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  They just want to control us.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000]  The elite just don't want a large population anymore.
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  And so they're busy dumbing us down, preparing us for the culling.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  But the globalist, I don't care if they're African elite, Chinese elite, Asian elite, European elite, Latin American elite.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  They all pretty much act and dress the same.
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  They all have the same hobbies and they all get off on dumbing people down and controlling them.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  And they tend to be psychopaths and sociopaths who just enjoy screwing people over.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  Whereas a normal person likes having people over and cooking dinner for them.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  Globalists hate hospitality.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  They hate, you know, I mean, they're just parasites.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  And they know how to manipulate people.
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  Good people don't sit around thinking about how to be manipulative.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  Well, these globalists do. And so we're basically blind to them.
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  And we've got a blind spot that they can then take advantage of.
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  I mean, that's what I think. What do you think?
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  Well, I think the same way, Alex. And it just baffles me, man.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  I tell you, if people would look closely at what the American dream is saying,
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  it eliminates any kind of racism that they promote racism.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  And like you say, in order to keep us separated, so we can't live up to what God created us to be.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  And it's a shame, but I really believe that God will bless the patriots of America,
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  the patriots of the world when we stand up against them and we will overcome them.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  But I just want to make a quick comment.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  A couple of weeks ago, you mentioned you were going to sponsor an anonymous contest.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  Do you still plan to do that if you do? Stay there. I'm going to come back to you.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  Don't hang up, Charlie, because you're a great caller.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  I want you to be able to elaborate on your question and make other comments.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  Here's my problem. I sit up there and have these ideas and then I have a limited crew.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  And then I call for things that my crew can't cash.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  It's like my mouth writes checks that, you know, my body can't cash.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  But we're going to talk about when we come back.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:19.000]  The Average Person's Life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:26.000]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality,
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:31.000]  specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  to create superior vitality in males and females.
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  Supercharge and conquer your world.

[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.000]  Silver bullet.
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:10.000]  Coming up, lawsuit for $20 billion against Al Sharpton.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:15.000]  We've got some good news on record numbers of farmers planting non-GMO crops.
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:25.000]  We're going to get into just a ton of news I haven't hit yet, but if you just joined us, record low temperatures across the entire United States,
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  but also record low temperatures in Alaska and Hawaii.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  So all 50 are record cold, but snow on the ground in 48 states.
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  The weather channel is reporting.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  The paper in Detroit reporting that Ann Arbor breaks record low temperatures set in 1900.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal has the headline from internet to obama net,
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.000]  and they report that it will slow down the internet and basically kill freedom of the web.
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:03.000]  As we know it, the former FCC head says that it is extremely draconian and extremely dangerous.
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  Obama's regs will make internet slow as in Europe or in FCC, FCC commissioners.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  But this is what Congress and others are going ahead with.
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  Republican FCC commissioner asked Wheeler to delay net neutrality vote release proposal, which is still secret,
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  and we have articles detailing all that at infowars.com.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  But I want to drill into these articles and some other news I haven't hit yet, but first, let's take a bunch of calls here.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  Charlie, we're running a contest for people to send in their art for Alex Jones billboards, just the art.
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  But then part of that contest is to shoot video of either putting up a billboard or putting it up on the side of your barn
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  or handing out hand bills of the image and then putting that to YouTube.
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  I just kind of came up with the contest and just said handle it and I haven't seen any of the entries.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  I don't know what's going on with it.
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  And that's the problem. I'll come up with these contests and then I don't follow up on them.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  And then we've had film contests where we get a thousand entries, 500 of them plus were good.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  And then it took my whole crew, took up all our time to try to judge them.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  It was obviously very effective and the contest, some of the videos got millions of views and the aggregate tens of millions of views.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  And a lot of major filmmakers got involved.
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  I had one contest was for $100,000 for the first price.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  That's as big as the Doritos contest.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  I couldn't do that anymore. We had some excess funds then, so we did that.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  Usually we don't have excess funds, so most contests are like $5,000.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  We had one $5,000 contest to hang up flyers in legal and lawful areas with vaccine info about the adverse reactions.
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  And we probably had 20 or more TV stations around the country covered it.
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  Newspapers covered it. It was big.
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000]  So these contests have all been successful.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  It's just that a lot of them aren't as successful as they would be because I don't follow up.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000]  I know this. I said I'd put up two billboards at least.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  We were putting one up at the Y. It goes up next week in South Austin and one is up off South IH 35 down off Slaughter.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  So the two billboards are going in in Austin just to kind of match in spirit the fellow that put up dozens on the east coast that have had such a big effect.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  And it was just the idea of what if listeners put infoworks.com on their car, whether it was a bumper sticker or a big sign.
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:42.000]  What if you started your own website and put it on your car? What if you put it on the side of your barn?
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  A lot of people have been doing this.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  So we thank you because it's certainly getting the word out and they're trying to censor us on so many fronts.
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:59.000]  That's the reason we should double and triple down and up what we're doing so that people that have never heard the truth come to infoworks.com.
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  Click on the free video feed.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  In fact, it just hit me down at the bottom of infoworks.com and prisonpana.com.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  We always have one or two of our most recent YouTube videos posted.
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  What we should do is get a video player like CNN has where it just says live video and that's pretty much up in the middle or at the top so that people can click it and watch the free video feed that we have right now at infoworks.com
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  and then have a link or a little window that opens.
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  We should have a pop-up window. People don't like pop-ups. I've never had them. I don't like them either.
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  But what about a pop-up window with a nice display with the video feed and then the podcast link and the audio links under it to really push that?
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000]  I mean, every other talk show host does that. Why haven't I?
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  So you kind of bring these issues up. I start a brainstorm on air.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  You just don't have the crew to get all these things implemented. I should be a better administrator and focus on what's key, like getting us on satellite, getting us on all these cable systems and TV stations that are ready, willing and able.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  That's paramount. Redesign info wars. That's next.
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  Get a couple more reporters and writers. But I'm always so busy trying to comply with all the government garbage and all the regulations and all the employee stuff and trying to make money to put coal in the engine to get this engine and this train over the mountain.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  But here's the deal.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  I'm pretty much info wars is up at the top of the mountain right now and I'm looking down the hill now.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.000]  And I'm thinking, what's it going to be like when we start rolling down the hill?
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  I've kind of climbed the mountain with you and my crew and I'm now up here on top of the mountain.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  And I see an even bigger mountain.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  And I see that we go down the hill and being an engineer, I know that we'll be able to climb that last mountain with the kinetic energy we're going to gain.
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  If I speed this train up to about 150 miles an hour or 200 miles an hour, but the trains, you know, the tracks only designed for about a 60 mile an hour.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  I'm not going to take the risk to accelerate this train down off this mountain down into the valley and then up that mountain of Mordor.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  That's the allegory because believe me, they don't like me now.
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  They know we're positioned and they know I can pull the trigger, drop the hammer and have this show explode even faster.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  People are going to freak out on little local cable systems and TV stations and stuff when this is on.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  Without even asking, we're already on five cable systems and some broadcast TV stations.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  I'm talking about Southern California, Houston, Texas, upstate New York, Florida.
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  Without, I mean, we're talking about big stations.
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000]  I haven't even plugged these people yet.
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000]  I haven't even gotten ready to roll this out yet.
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  We're on the satellite provider already and the cable system that put the Ron Paul channel on.
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  They've been trying to get me to it for years.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  They got Ron Paul to do it.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  I mean, we've got it lined up.
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  We've got stations clamoring.
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  I'm just trying to get our news quality production up more, which we're doing.
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  I mean, this is a ragtag operation that is ready.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:23.000]  We're going to be a lot bigger than Glenn Beck, who tried to get a, you know, just a cable channel.
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  He got a thousand cable channels.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  Nobody's watching.
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  You're on the local basic cable channel like we are in Houston right now.
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:33.000]  You're right now we're on the basic cable in Houston.
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  You know what that means?
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  We got basic cable franchise holders that are listeners all over the country.
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000]  And quite frankly, it's not that I'm a coward.
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  I've been hesitating after all these battles now facing the main enemy and knowing that
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  if I turn up the heat and go up against them, they are going to drop a hammer on me, but
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  that'll make us even bigger.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  Every time I get attacked with espionage, like stuff out of movies, folks.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.000]  I don't even get into it.
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:02.000]  It just, everything goes our way.
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  It blows up in all of our enemy's faces.
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  Things just drop right in our laps.
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000]  The enemy's entire battle plan.
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.000]  Everything just blows up in their face.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:17.000]  God be with us who can be against us, but I'll be honest with you.
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000]  My spirit is willing, but my flesh is weak.
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:23.000]  It's like my spirit wants to fight harder and my body goes, man, I'm tired.
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  Buddy, can't you go fishing and enjoy yourself?
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  You really are pushing it.
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000]  Okay, don't get me killed.
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:30.000]  Stop it.
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:31.000]  Stop it.
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  My spirit's like, yes, yes, yes, go, go, go, go.
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000]  My body's like, no, no, no, no.
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  Don't do it.
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  Don't, no, don't you dare.
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  It's like the devil on the left, angel on the right.
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:46.000]  Make no mistake who I'll be with tonight.
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  I mean, it's hard.
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:51.000]  It's hard to do this when you're actually in the position.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000]  I mean, I could have even greater success as my whole point.
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.000]  And I'm busy flogging around here to try to get basic stuff done,
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  because it's not well organized because I run it.
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000]  And it's not that I'm badly organized.
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000]  It's that I take on too much.
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000]  See, I shouldn't skip the breaks.
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  That bankrupts the network.
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  In fact, we're not going to skip it.
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  I apologize.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.000]  Charlie, go ahead and finish up.
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000]  I don't remember the anonymous contest.
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000]  I said something about it.
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:19.000]  It would be a really great idea to get people involved,
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:23.000]  to do things anonymously and then videotape it, legal and lawful things.
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  It's a great idea, but I don't think I even have the,
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  that's lower on the totem pole.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000]  How about other people just go out and do it,
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  send us the YouTube's at show tips.
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000]  I mean, you know, let's just do it.
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:35.000]  For me, take action.
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000]  Go ahead, Charlie.
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.000]  Well, sir, I just want to say an ending.
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  I saw you on the peers market show when you appeared there,
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000]  defending the second amendment.
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  And as a result of that, I'm a better man today.
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:51.000]  All you could do was defend in a man's right,
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  defend and protect his family.
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  And God bless you.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  God bless you in the entire awards team.
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:00.000]  And we send our prayers to you, sir.
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000]  Well, thank you.
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  You made some really good points earlier.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  We're going to break in a few minutes.
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:08.000]  No, sir.
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  We're with you, sir, and we're praying and working.
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.000]  And God is with us.
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  Well, thank you so much, brother.
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.000]  Thank you.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  And I want to thank you, sir, for all you're doing
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000]  and supporting us and calling in.
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:24.000]  It's very humbling to just have all these good people.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  You can hear how good they are,
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.000]  how good their spirit is in their voice.
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.000]  And it just shakes me up to have so many incredible men
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000]  and women of every race, color and creed
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000]  who are counting on me.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000]  And I've seen people procrastinate
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  and never launch a radio show,
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000]  never launch a magazine, never make a film
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  because they want to do a perfect job.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  And I've always criticized those people
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  saying, don't wait, get involved,
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:53.000]  but now that I'm in such a spotlight
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:56.000]  and my operation is, it's almost like
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  I'm a deer in the headlights now, to a certain extent,
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:04.000]  that it's just, it's so overwhelming, I struggle with it.
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000]  Now, I'm going to take a bunch of calls
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  if the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  They've got an obnoxious statement from England
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:14.000]  if something doesn't, the admiral.
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:17.000]  But when we come back, I'm going to Amy on Fukushima.
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:20.000]  I'm going to Rob on America's Bankruptcy, 1933.
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:24.000]  Rick and World Net Daily on the New Temple and Prophecy
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000]  and Thurman on Immigration.
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  Please hold, I'm going to you straight ahead.
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  So just have your question or comment ready
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000]  and I'm going to move to the next person.
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  I get started slow and I babble
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000]  and I appreciate you putting up with me.
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  I'm Alex Jones in FullWars.com.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:20:02.000]  I hope you enjoyed this video.
[02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:18.000]  My name is Dale and I live in El Cajon, California.
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000]  I was concerned about my cholesterol readings
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000]  because I knew that high cholesterol
[02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000]  is related to clogging of the arteries
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:27.000]  and increases the risk for heart attack and stroke.
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:30.000]  One day I heard an ad for heart and body extract
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:33.000]  and I was skeptical and I decided to give it a try.
[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000]  Man, the numbers don't lie.

[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000]  and most challenging to acquire.
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000]  This winter season is more important than ever

[02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:49.000]  you could be left to fend for yourself and your family.

[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000]  on every facet of our lives,
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000]  we're all asking ourselves,
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:54.000]  how can we maintain our independence?
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000]  The answer is clear.
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:01.000]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:04.000]  My Patreon supply is here to help.

[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:55.000]  Ha-ha-ha-ha.
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:59.000]  Yep, coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.000]  You found it, the Info War.
[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000]  Amy and then Thurman and others.
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000]  Amy in Oregon on Fukushima.
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:17.000]  Actually, I'm a first-time caller, long-time listener.
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:21.000]  I had actually taken a flu shot in 2004,
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:24.000]  and from that, I had to have open-heart surgery
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  because I guess whatever caused problems
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000]  just ate up my aortic valve.
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:33.000]  Did they admit that to you?
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000]  No, they did not.
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  Because, by the way, when they had the smallpox shots in 2002,
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:42.000]  remember it killed a bunch of troops and reporters that took it?
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:45.000]  They admitted that it caused basically an autoimmune response.
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  I'm not a doctor. I don't understand how it happens,
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000]  but I know it does it.
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  Vaccines attack the brain, heart valves,
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  and the pancreas particularly.
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:58.000]  And yes, I know that valves go out
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  when people take certain vaccines.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:04.000]  But what happened to your heart?
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  Why do you think it was the vaccines in your case?
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000]  Well, because right after I took the vaccine,
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:12.000]  I was diagnosed with an ITT,
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:15.000]  which is idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura.
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:18.000]  It's where your blood doesn't clot correctly,
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  and you bruise and bleed out,
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:23.000]  and actually bled into my lungs
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000]  and was suffocating because of it,
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:29.000]  and went to Reckonridge Hospital there in Austin,
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  and they said that I needed a heart valve transplant.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:36.000]  So that's why I think it was a flu shot.
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:39.000]  And later on, after the heart valve transplant,
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:42.000]  I was diagnosed with lupus,
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:45.000]  which is autoimmune disorder.
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:48.000]  Well, they admit flu shots and Gardasil.
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  That's in the inserts that they can give you autoimmune disorders.
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  So I guess it did what it told you to do.
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000]  Sorry to hear that happen.
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000]  It did do it.
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:02.000]  But I've been taking the DNA for the secret 12x2,
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000]  all your products,
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  and I'm seizure-free.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:10.000]  They diagnosed me with epilepsy as well as lupus.
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  And I've been seizure-free for four months.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  Unbelievable.
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000]  Wow.
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:24.000]  And what happened when you started taking the products?
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  I was less foggy in my mind.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  I was actually able to get off of my anti-seizure medicine.
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:36.000]  And so I'm the only medication that I'm on now is blood thinners
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  from my heart valves, which is ridiculous because it's a cow's valve.
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  It's bovine.
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  Are you on CUMIDIN?
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000]  CUMIDIN, yeah.
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  Our war friend is the generic.
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  No.
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  But that's the only thing that I'm on.
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:54.000]  I actually met you and your wife in 2005
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.000]  at a, let's say, premiere of one of your movies.
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000]  Well, it's a pleasure, Amy, to talk to you again.
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  Specifically, what was your take on Fukushima?
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:07.000]  Fukushima, well, being on the West Coast in Oregon,
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  the weather, I mean, it sounds to me like what's going on in the East Coast
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000]  is a nuclear winter.
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  Because over here, it is warm.
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:18.000]  It's 60 degrees, 65.
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  It's insane.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:20.000]  The sun is shining.
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  And of course, there's chemtrailing like nobody's business.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  It's insane.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  But I think that we're in extreme trouble,
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  especially with the new thing that's going on at Fukushima
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  with the new reactor billowing out all this smoke.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  And I looked in the sky and I'm just seeing horrible,
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  or at least it was a couple of days ago,
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  plumes of smoke, which looks like they're just traveling across the sky.
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:56.000]  And it's just really scary because I can feel the radiation.
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:00.000]  My husband said he can actually see it going through the window.
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000]  I mean, it's just...
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:05.000]  Well, I'm showing the headlines out of the Statesman Journal.
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:08.000]  Fukushima Radiation found 400 miles west of Newport.
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  Showed another headline, RT, Radiation Levels in Tuna of Oregon.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:13.000]  Tripled after Fukushima.
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:16.000]  And yeah, it's melting down again.
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  Thank you so much for your support.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:18.000]  God bless you.
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  Let's go to Sermon in Florida. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  Yes, sir.
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  Been listening to you since about 2002 or so.
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  First time I've gotten through.
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:32.000]  Basically want to give two perspectives on immigration
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000]  having been in public education.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  I recently got out of public education.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:44.000]  But starting off in 2006, I have my own landscaping business.
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000]  We're doing very well.
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  And of course, you know, the bottom started falling out.
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  But we ended up being undercut by people coming in.
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:29:00.000]  The artists that Jesse spoke of earlier pretty much ran us out of business.
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000]  I have a degree and I've been in education before.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:06.000]  So I went ahead and took a job as a teacher.
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000]  Hold on. I'm coming back to you, Sermon. Don't hang up.
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  I want to hear this story straight ahead.
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:16.000]  And again, the issue is the illegals on record tend to get welfare with mama at home.
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  Daddy goes out and works. They live great because you get welfare,
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  sometimes on multiple identities and then daddy's working and daddy can undercut.
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  Just like Walmart is government sanctioned and sponsored
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:32.000]  and tells its employees to get on welfare to undercut other companies as well.
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  It's the same strategy and it's a fraud.
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:42.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:49.000]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:53.000]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.

[02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:31.000]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:36.000]  This winter season is more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000]  And we will live.
[02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:00.000]  Alright? Fight and you may die.
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.000]  Run. And you'll live.

[02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:14.000]  Many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that
[02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:20.000]  for one chance, just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies
[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:27.000]  that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:36.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:42.000]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:48.000]  You know perhaps I should put on airs like other talk show hosts in broadcast like this
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:51.000]  with this voice for the balance of the hour.
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:54.000]  Let's go back to Thurman in Florida.
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:58.000]  In FEMA Region 4, Thurman, thanks for holding your on the ear.
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:06.000]  Yes, sir. So from 2006 to 2009, we watched our income go down in the landscape business.
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:11.000]  And like I said, we were being undercut by a lot of immigrant labor that was coming in.
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000]  Okay.
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:17.000]  Illegal alien. Listen, use the term because if they can get people to not use the proper term,
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:20.000]  that's what they call illegal aliens in Mexico as illegal aliens.
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000]  That's the term used for hundreds of years.
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000]  That's the alien of the state.
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:28.000]  We call things from other planets aliens because that's the term.
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:33.000]  We need to use the proper term and not let them bully us into using their politically correct terms.
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:36.000]  But to go ahead and finish, I'm sorry.
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000]  Gotcha. That's okay.
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  Alright, so anyway, I started working at the local elementary school.
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  And it was an affluent school, I'll say.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  And that was for three and a half years. And then I transferred over to a high poverty,
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:57.000]  what we called 95% free and reduced lunch school.
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:02.000]  I was a general music teacher, which meant that I saw every child in that school.
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  And it was right at about a thousand kids.
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  I went in, first of all, I was a little bitter, you know, because the illegal aliens had come in.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000]  I felt like we had been undercut.
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:22.000]  You know, it was, I was seeing it happen. I was in the office on several times helping out during registration.
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:27.000]  And I would, you know, see the family filling out the paperwork for the free reduced lunch.
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:32.000]  And they would set their brand new iPhone down, you know, to be able to fill out the paperwork.
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000]  And that didn't quite add up to me.
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:37.000]  But here's where things started changing.
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:42.000]  Once I got in there, and also I worked as an interpreter within the school system too, because I speak Spanish.
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:48.000]  So I saw, you know, that side of it, the families being deported and the horrible things that happened there.
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:51.000]  But to get to where things changed was this.
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:59.000]  This high poverty school that I spent the last two years at before I got out of public ed was broken down like this.
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  And first of all, let me say that I used to teach my students, you know, we are Americans.
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.000]  We don't, you know, I don't see black Americans. I don't see white Americans.
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:14.000]  But let's just say it. It's just like a prison, I'm guessing, and what you're going to say, everyone was put into their own prison quadrant.
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:18.000]  The poor white kids, the poor black kids, the poor Hispanic kids.
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  Something like that. But more to the point was this. It broke down evenly along these lines.
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:32.000]  A fifth of the students were Asian because I'm near a very large military base where quite a few were lifted over after Vietnam.
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:38.000]  All right. A fifth were white kids. A fifth were black kids. A fifth were Hispanic kids.
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:41.000]  And then the other fifth would be the mixed-race children. Okay.
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:52.000]  All right. By far and large, hands down, the best students, the best manners, the hardest workers,
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:57.000]  the ones who did their homework, the ones who tried, who were well-dressed,
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:02.000]  the ones who just taken care of were the Hispanic kids. And what I guessed,
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:10.000]  what I ended up concluding and kind of changing my own frame and way of looking at it was that we,
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:13.000]  that is, the people that had been here in the United States.
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:17.000]  We are degenerates spoiled rotten pigs and are collapsing.
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:24.000]  And so there's a little bit of old-world conservatism left in Latin America as hellish as it is.
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:28.000]  So imagine when we fall, how bad it's going to be.
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:37.000]  That's a good point. But to me, the thing that was the most impactful as far as what I saw was that I've even told people,
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:44.000]  I think that those kids are the last hope for our country because they still have that American dream.
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:52.000]  They still work hard. Now, that having been said, I also believe that we need to shut those borders down yesterday.
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:38:00.000]  Well, nobody else does this. And absolutely, the problem is the Democratic Party is there to take these immigrants
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:08.000]  who on average would be good for the country and to turn them into voters who will make everybody slaves.
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  I mean, these illegals vote when they end up becoming citizens or vote.
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  They've got the polls right at 90 percent. The most hardcore, look at California.
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:19.000]  I mean, they're taking all the freedom in California.
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  And so here's the question. How do we reach out? Because here's the thing.
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:30.000]  50 percent, I saw this like in USA Today last year, but I've already seen the demographics,
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:38.000]  below the age of 12 on average in the country, half the country is Hispanic.
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  In many areas, the country is already like 67 percent Hispanic. It's a joke.
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:51.000]  It's Hispanic American citizens that are paying in these areas the majority for all the illegals.
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:56.000]  So it's a total screw job. And again, I don't blame the illegals wanting all this stuff.
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  But because Latin America is in a long protracted depression, Mexico is a descending hell pit.
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  And it's a beautiful place on the Pacific and the Caribbean side.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:13.000]  I wish Mexico was like super nice and I wish Africa was. I mean, I'd probably move there.
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  I want countries to run to. I'm sick of it.
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  You know, I've said I'll stay in America, but I don't know, man.
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:29.000]  It's just that they're taking these people and just turning them into the political army to vote us into total slaves.
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:33.000]  And that's what makes me sick. I appreciate your call. See, I said I'd give each caller one minute.
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000]  These callers are all grabbing me each like 10 minutes.
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:39.000]  Rick in Texas, go ahead.
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:46.000]  Yes, I'm the first time caller. I've listened for many, many years. I've been awake for 30 plus years.
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  Well, thanks for putting up with me, brother.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:52.000]  Oh, that's what I'm glad to.
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  I attribute being awake to having been through Bible calls at seminary where I had such an avid interest in Bible prophecy that I've taught for many, many years.
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  So I've got two points that I'd like to make if I can. First is to call attention to an article in WND.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:15.000]  It's called prayers to God in the wrong spot. This is probably one of the most significant articles of our times, literally.
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:20.000]  Prayers to God in the wrong spot. WND.com. We'll look it up.
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000]  Yep. It was there a couple of days ago.
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  And the author is... Oh, he travels the world solving biblical mysteries.
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  So he's hunted the Noah's Ark, the Ark of the Covenant, and then took on the issue of where is the exact site of the Jewish temple.
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  And his conclusion was that the exact site of the temple was not on the Temple Mount, but about 600 feet south, which is in the city of David, which Israel actually owns.
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:54.000]  And part of it is a Ark.
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:41:01.000]  And that would resolve an enormous number of problems, because for most of us that know the Scripture is well in that way.
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  There are a number of textual things that present enormous problems, much less just the geopolitical...
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  Sure. And of course, they built a mosque on top of where they think...
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:16.000]  I think the first temple was, correct me if I'm wrong for my history.
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:22.000]  And so there's big fights whenever the Jews want to tear that down and build their temple back.
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:25.000]  It creates incredible division.
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:31.000]  Yes. And there's been a group called the Temple Mount Faithful that has actually rebuilt all of the implements for the temple.
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:41.000]  They've had the cornerstone for many, many years. They bring it out each year as the reminder of what it is that's to come, because they believe that's part of the end times.
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:46.000]  So I would recommend that people really look at this article. I mean, this is...
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  When I read this article, I was absolutely astounded after having been on the illusion for a long, long time.
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:42:02.000]  I think it's just our absolute head turn, because that would allow for the rebuilding of the temple.
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:10.000]  And without any question at all, and it would take and change the whole geopolitical construction in the Middle East.
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  So that's number one.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  Number two, I was a clinical psychologist for a long, long time.
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:22.000]  And I've observed the process through the years.
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  When I first started teaching prophecy, because the events were so far out, people would have a great interest in it, but it was far removed.
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  So, especially when you get into things like we were trying to teach about the Federal Reserve, we actually had book lists.
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:48.000]  Sure, sure. Or people would deny it because the media said it didn't exist. I found now that it's pretty much admitted, people don't go, oh, you were right.
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:59.000]  Wow, you're really smart. I better listen to you. They say, oh, so what? Just accept it. I mean, not everybody, but people that were already not listening, they will then just say, oh, so what now that all this is in our face.
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:02.000]  But get into your story. What did you see happen?
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:10.000]  I see a process is the issue that I'd like to talk to for a moment, if I may.
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  The process is that as time has progressed, I moved to teaching where I wasn't just teaching prophecy and the original languages and all the things that you would normally do.
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:31.000]  I started to teach along the lines of this is that, because years ago, if we saw one thing a year that was really had prophetic significance, I mean, we were jumping up and down.
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:37.000]  I mean, we had to subscribe to the London Times and, you know, we had to literally get the old papers.
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:45.000]  Oh, yeah. I mean, it'd be a big deal 15 years ago to have some CEO admit sooner or by all have brain chips. And now it's just in the newspaper 50 times a day.
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:59.000]  Exactly. But in the process, as the veil is being lifted on all these events and people become more sophisticated about the religious, economic, military and political aspects of current events,
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:05.000]  things happen within the individual that actually is listening and absorbing that.
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:20.000]  And a part of that is kind of like the loss of a child. When you know a child, that's devastating. And part of that devastation is related to the fact that you're not just losing the child, you're losing all the dreams of and for that child.
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:34.000]  Now, all of us have those dreams for our future. And so when the realities of what we thought our future were going to be are changed and challenged in any significant way, that actually enters us into a grieving process.
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:46.000]  And so what happens typically is that there'll be one, like in a couple, there will be one person who's really getting lit up and they can't hardly not talk about it.
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:56.000]  But then the other staffs who doesn't have that same interest or doesn't have the same background or have the same amount of information starts to get really scared and withdraw.
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:04.000]  And so you see all of these problems related to actually what underneath is a grieving process that takes place.
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:10.000]  Absolutely. That's why you just got to tell people the truth and then move on and hope they wake up and God will work with them.
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:24.000]  Also, most people are so tied into Hollywood and the NFL and kind of the fake world that the system puts out that they can't seem to then dial in to what's really going on.
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:28.000]  Because if they ever did, you'd never care about petty stuff anymore.
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:33.000]  I mean, quite frankly, I know a lot of Hollywood people and musicians and I like them because they're cool people that love freedom.
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:40.000]  And they tend to be interesting folks, but I could care less at their movie stars. I could care less to be invited to some A-list Hollywood party already done it.
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:44.000]  The problem is most people never got invited to parties like that.
[02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:52.000]  So they imagine there's some Mount Olympus Valhalla that oh, they could just get there. They'd be fulfilled and it really just doesn't exist.
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:46:02.000]  What exists is just being an artist, being a person that crafts things, a farmer, someone who builds things, someone that educates, someone that helps.
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:07.000]  The passion of life, the simple things, that's what is fulfilling.
[02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:16.000]  But the world wants to sell that no, you've got to go do all this and you've got to follow the Madison Avenue line to be fulfilled.
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:22.000]  And the system wants to be God and the system wants to recreate the earth in its image, which is very ugly.
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000]  Thank you, Rick. Really good points.
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  I want to move quick now because I got a bunch of news I want to hit.
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:31.000]  Rob in North Carolina, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000]  You there?
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000]  Yes, sir. I am. Go ahead.
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  I had a question for you.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:45.000]  I was kind of looking online and it appears that back in 1933 the government actually went bankrupt under Roosevelt.
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:48.000]  Sure did. War Powers Act officially. Yep.
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:56.000]  So from that point it looks like the U.S. government and all the cities and states and everything kind of turned into corporations.
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:04.000]  They did and then they went under the 1878 Federal District of Columbia realignment that we talked about yesterday.
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:11.000]  And there is a corporate fiction operating in the same domain as the real republic.
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:17.000]  So they built a scaffolding of the fraudulent system to then slowly transfer power to that.
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:24.000]  While milking the old system, now they're preparing to fully suck dry what was left, blow it out the airlock.
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.000]  The enemy is now moving into its final phase.
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  I guess my question is, you know, I've listened to a couple years now.
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:37.000]  Why do you always refer to the government as the government or at least that's what I think I hear you say.
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:52.000]  Sure. It's the same reason when I talk about micro FM, I call it pirate radio because we're on over 170 affiliates and most of our listeners don't know what micro FM is or FCC rules or community radio or how the airways belong to the people and on and on.
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:48:00.000]  So I will say pirate FM or AM known by insiders as micro people should look into it.
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:12.000]  I do it because we're talking about the government, the de facto forced to sure force measure by by seizure by taking under common law, we have been usurped.
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:18.000]  And so via the barrel of a gun, there is an illegitimate government that operates their ignorance.
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  But its agents believe their agents of the Republic almost to a man.
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:40.000]  So if I get up here and speak in the real legal parlance and in the actual text of the system, the general audience would think I was speaking in Latin this half the time I would be.
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  Well, I understand. But I guess the thing is, if I think maybe if people actually understood that the government really doesn't serve them as they say they do, and it's actually a corporation.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  Yes, yes.
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000]  There may be a quicker awakening.
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:49:08.000]  I agree. I mean, we are modeled after the British East India Company. They set up a corporation. They had a district in two different spots in India and maybe 10,000 Brits by the middle of it control hundreds of millions of people.
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  And so that's how they did it. And we're we're under that model, just like the city of London controls the UK, the city of London within London, has it's a wall around it, its own laws, the highest rent in the world.
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  It might as well be an alien spaceship that lands, you know, a city and then controls everything around it. I mean, it's that's exactly what we're talking about.
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  And you notice the Vatican operates like that with its Swiss army. You notice Israel has says it's not part of the UN and above the law. And I'm not attacking Israel folks.
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:52.000]  I'm just stating this is how these things operate. You notice the UN says it's above the law and has its own sectors at the Hague and the Netherlands and in New York City and who gave them land the Rockefellers.
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:56.000]  I mean, yeah, this is hardcore what we're facing.
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:07.000]  The other thing to that I've also made me wrong, but it looks like when this all happened that the United States citizens actually became collateralized via the Social Security system.
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:15.000]  Yes, we are collateralized and they say that our our work, our names, our children are pledges collateral on the national debt. That's a fact.
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:18.000]  I mean, that means that we're slaves. I mean, yes, yes.
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:28.000]  In fact, they didn't free black people at the end of Civil War on record. They created a system to make everyone indentured servants who then had privileges.
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  Everyone became a slave.
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  It's unbelievable when you really discover all the truth about this. Very good calls, great points. Antonio, Chris, Wayne, I'm going to overdrive to talk to you because in this final official segment, I got a bunch of news. Stay with us.
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:56.000]  Hear that. That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place and what they don't steal will be destroyed this year.

[02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:21.000]  Two years ago we showed JPMorgan memos and letters to their customers as well as Bank of America letters. DrudgeReport.com linked to both of them.
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:28.000]  And they had JPMorgan and Bank of America come out and say we're not going to charge for deposits.
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:32.000]  And then they had national outlets attack me and say I was a liar. I mean we had copies of it.
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:37.000]  Here it is MarketWatch. That's a division of the Wall Street Journal.
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:44.000]  JPMorgan to start charging big clients fees on some deposits.
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:50.000]  And they're also saying they're going to start charging people at Bank of America and JPMorgan and others.
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:54.000]  JPMorgan Chase to transfer money.
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:59.000]  So see they've debased the money so much that they're going to charge you to keep your money in the bank.
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:07.000]  And yelling the head of the Federal Reserve, the private Federal Reserve says she's going to continue basically QE unlimited and never raise interest rates.
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  Don't audit me she said and no rate rise ever. That's DrudgeReport.com with links to her statements at CNBC and MarketWatch.
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:27.000]  Home ownership hits 20 year low. A nation of renters. I thought they loaned poor people all that money to get houses because they cared about you.
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  U.S. home ownership rate hits 20 year low. CNS News.
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:36.000]  So that's some of the news that we're covering.
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:43.000]  Pachari, the guy whose family owns the steel plant, they had the British one shut down the last steel plant in Britain and moved to India that he owns.
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:48.000]  AP reports he stepped down as the climate change head over sexual harassment charges.
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:52.000]  So I love how their political correctness bites them in the butt.
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:59.000]  Greece's leaders face a revolt at home as they try to appease creditors. I thought the new elected group was going to not pay these debts that really aren't theirs most of them.
[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:02.000]  But New York Times reports they're not moving in that direction now.
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  Thailand is jailed to on royal insult charge over a play they wrote.
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:10.000]  We talked about how Thailand's a free country. No, it's not.
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:16.000]  I knew a lady from Thailand. She goes, I know your country's not free. I was at a party years ago. She was arguing with me and I go, no, it's not.
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:23.000]  You don't have any free speech. She goes, we free. We have King and Queen. I said, excuse me. She goes, we free. We have King and Queen.
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:28.000]  I kept this gleam in her eye like, oh, the royalty, royalty, royalty.
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:31.000]  Just want to throw up.
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  Doesn't matter. What matters is, is Sweden's Misson the world's oldest living cat?
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:40.000]  Misson 29, maybe the world's oldest cat, according to Swedish owner.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000]  I bet money they don't vaccinate this cat.
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:49.000]  Says aside from suffering from some minor back and kidney problems, there's no reason why the furry friend won't make it to the grand age of 30.
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:53.000]  So we're going to end that part of the show with really important news. I'm joking.
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  Here is the really important news. We've known this forever.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:02.000]  Superbug strikes again, killing two in North Carolina, directly linked to antibiotics, CBS News.
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:05.000]  Here's another CBS News article.
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:10.000]  Antibiotics on food causing children to have allergic reactions to fruits and vegetables.
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:13.000]  Yeah, it's just all over everything.
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:18.000]  More children are appearing to have allergic reactions to fruits and vegetables, but this has nothing to do with the food.
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:22.000]  Farmers often use antibiotics to keep pests away that have a problem for some children.
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:25.000]  And it goes on how it's causing asthma and everything else.
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:28.000]  Yeah, but they don't tell you wash your food or get organic.
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  They just say, here's a bunch of drugs. Oh, your five-year-old daughter's going into puberty.
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000]  Here's some hormones to suppress that.
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:42.000]  Not, hey, quit drinking, you know, abyssinol A bottles or quit microwaving in plastic trays where it just boils out.
[02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:47.000]  You know, they don't tell men, you know, you have a rectal dysfunction because you've got so much estrogen out of plastics.
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:51.000]  They just say, oh, we've got drugs for you. We're being killed by this garbage.
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  And here's the good news that I mentioned earlier.
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:57.000]  A record number of U.S. farmers switching to non-GMO crops in 2015.
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:00.000]  Continue to vote with your dollar.
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:05.000]  There's rising sentiment among farmers in the U.S. as a conference of factors.
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:09.000]  A confluence urges them to produce pro-organic.
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:14.000]  From falling GMO grain prices to rising tide of public distress of genetically modified ingredients.
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:18.000]  Failing GMO traits, higher GMO seed prices.
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:24.000]  And then it goes into the study about how record numbers are going into non-GMO organic.
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000]  Very exciting. We're going to overdrive for five minutes.
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:33.000]  Say, bottle, most of the stations. We're going to go to overdrive internet only and take some phone calls from Antonio and others.
[02:58:56.000 --> 02:59:09.000]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:13.000]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:20.000]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds.
[02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:26.000]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal, but for how long? Go to infidelbodyarmor.com.
[02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:30.000]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L Body Armor.com.
[02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:34.000]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:40.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:54.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:58.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:12.000]  Antonio in FEMA Region 9, formerly California under UN occupation.
[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:16.000]  The UN here in Austin is putting an open borders conference on that ends today.
[03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000]  We're living under UN rule.
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:22.000]  Antonio from UN Command Base 9, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:26.000]  From Region 9, you're in the Hunger Game. Go ahead.
[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:30.000]  Yeah. How's it going, Alex? It's a pleasure to speak to you, man. I really appreciate what you do.
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000]  Appreciate you, brother. What's on your mind?
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:39.000]  Okay. Originally, I wanted to talk about trendies, which I want to get to, but just you started talking about JP Morgan got me worked up.
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:44.000]  And have you happened to catch on Netflix? And I believe it's a history channel.
[03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:48.000]  Many series is called The Men Who Built America. My friend David turned me on for that.
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000]  No, but I've heard about it.
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:53.000]  You know what? It's a very interesting watch.
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:56.000]  But you know what? They build these guys up like gods.
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:01:02.000]  Oh, I know. I've seen history channel and PBS shows about the loving Rockefellers.
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000]  Lady Rockefeller helped the children.
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:07.000]  Meanwhile, you find out she was like a Hitler worshiper.
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000]  I mean, it's once you know the real history, it's sick.
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:13.000]  Oh, Thomas Watson loved the little black children.
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:16.000]  Meanwhile, his writings were, he must exterminate all of them, the high Hitler.
[03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  I mean, it is just so sick.
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:26.000]  Yeah. You know, there was good facts, you know, talking stuff like others, stuff like about Tesla and Edison, which, you know, was interesting.
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000]  But just the God worship and, you know,
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000]  Oh, JP Morgan built America.
[03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:33.000]  No, didn't he sucked off the country? He was a British agent.
[03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:37.000]  Oh, yeah. It's it's it's it's bad.
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000]  I recommend a watch of the research.
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:43.000]  And then also there's other documentary.
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  I don't know if you're aware of it.
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:50.000]  I'm sure that you've seen that show growing pains, you know, with her camera.
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000]  Yes, years ago.
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:53.000]  Yeah. Yeah.
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:56.000]  He has a documentary about my suit that turned me out to my sister Carmen.
[03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000]  It's called Monumental.
[03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:03.000]  And it goes into the, to the, the founding fathers, the Puritan that came from overseas to here.
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000]  And it's a very interesting watch.
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:08.000]  And I've heard about that so much, man.
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:09.000]  There's so much media now.
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:12.000]  What was your point on the trendies and the uppies?
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:15.000]  Okay. I'm sorry about that.
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:16.000]  How dare you?
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000]  I'm joking. Go ahead.
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:23.000]  I'm here in San Jose, California where I'm in like trendy jewelry here.
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:24.000]  I live down.
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:28.000]  I live down the way right there from where that that fake there.
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:31.000]  There were supposedly that drill that terrorist attack happened.
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:32.000]  Sure.
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  Morgan Hill.
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000]  I'm like right down the street.
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:36.000]  So what are the trendies doing?
[03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  We're almost out of time.
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:38.000]  Okay.
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:43.000]  So what are the trendies? What they're doing out here is man, they're pro GMO, pro vaccine.
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:44.000]  They're pro everything.
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:45.000]  And it's like something.
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:46.000]  Yeah.
[03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  They think they get power out of doing whatever the systems tells them to.
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:50.000]  Like I'm a winner.
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:51.000]  I'm for the system.
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:52.000]  It loves me.
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:53.000]  I love Obamacare doubling prices.
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:54.000]  I love death panels.
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:55.000]  Kill the veterans.
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000]  You've seen Mark Dice.
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  I mean, he's not editing these tapes.
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000]  Should we put the gun owners in slave camps?
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:02.000]  Absolutely.
[03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:03.000]  I'm sick of them.
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:04.000]  Really?
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:05.000]  Yeah.
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:06.000]  Let's take all their properties.
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:07.000]  You bet.
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:11.000]  And let's up ban brown bags because they're racist.
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:12.000]  Of course.
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:15.000]  I mean, these are not liberals.
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:20.000]  These are just mindless scumbags that are on power trips.
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:24.000]  These trendies, you know, they're not just here in the streets and just don't care, you know,
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:27.000]  all they want to do is just get, get drunk, get laid and stuff.
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:28.000]  But you know what?
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:29.000]  They're in the church.
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:30.000]  Well, I mean, you know, there's worse things.
[03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  I mean, I'm not judging him.
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:34.000]  My point is, listen, I appreciate your call.
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:35.000]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000]  I'm going to jam in one more.
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:38.000]  I apologize.
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:39.000]  We're out of time.
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:40.000]  Chris in Washington, you're on the air.
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:41.000]  Go ahead.
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:45.000]  Well, you sent me for the last, but I was trying to tell your call screener.
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:50.000]  I just think the naysayers talking about how you don't organize and you should be more
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:54.000]  than just a journalist and that you should get something going on.
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:04:00.000]  I kind of think that you're doing a job as a journalist, but you should maybe offer some
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:04.000]  assistance for people that are trying to meet locally, get some kind of organization.
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:05.000]  What do you think about that?
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:10.800]  Just assisting your popularity, your website for people that want to start preparing and
[03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:13.000]  organizing other than just by themselves.
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:16.000]  Like we seem to always be left alone in the dark.
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:17.000]  Well, I agree.
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:22.440]  I mean, there's a million things I want to do and I'm just trying to get things organized
[03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:27.400]  to put on a TV show, radio show three hours a day and nightly news, news websites, everything
[03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:29.360]  else and try to get the funding.
[03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:31.720]  But there's a bunch of stuff I want to do.
[03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:37.200]  Which is quite frankly, I can't do it, but I'm getting there.
[03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:39.320]  So we're getting a lot done.
[03:04:39.320 --> 03:04:40.920]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:40.920 --> 03:04:41.920]  Free transmission starts now.
[03:04:41.920 --> 03:05:01.480]  Sorry to Wayne, David and William.
