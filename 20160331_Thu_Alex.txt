[00:00.000 --> 00:11.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.360 --> 00:18.920]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.920 --> 00:33.160]  Texas Alex Jones all right ladies and gentlemen get ready we have congressman
[00:33.160 --> 00:41.360]  Walter Jones joining us on huge 28 pages 9-11 attack news and more coming up
[00:41.360 --> 00:45.880]  today we're also gonna have open phones and Anthony Gucci already will be
[00:45.880 --> 00:52.480]  hosting the fourth hour obviously the new big sensation is Trump saying women
[00:52.480 --> 00:56.800]  that get illegal abortions should be punished and now he's kind of backtracked
[00:56.800 --> 01:01.440]  off that if you've got illegal brain surgery I think whoever does it should
[01:01.440 --> 01:05.080]  be punished but that's a side issue we're gonna break the whole thing down
[01:05.080 --> 01:08.480]  coming up there is so much to cover today our troops are in the field but
[01:08.480 --> 01:14.960]  first a key report from John Bowne on the incredible reverse racism going on in
[01:14.960 --> 01:20.160]  this country non whites only need apply so read the casting call for Hamilton a
[01:20.160 --> 01:25.120]  Broadway hit that hijacks the genius of the founding fathers and super imposes
[01:25.120 --> 01:29.600]  them onto minorities now being heavily scrutinized by New York's civil rights
[01:29.600 --> 01:34.240]  attorney Randolph McLaughlin what if they put an ad out that said whites
[01:34.240 --> 01:39.160]  only need apply why African-Americans Latinos Asians will be outraged you
[01:39.160 --> 01:44.560]  cannot advertise showing that you have a preference for one racial group over
[01:44.560 --> 01:50.000]  another as an artistic question sure he can cast whomever he wants to cast but
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.160]  he has to give every actor eligible for the role an opportunity to try
[01:54.160 --> 01:58.840]  nonetheless the cast was welcomed with open arms by the George Soros funded
[01:58.840 --> 02:03.920]  Black Lives Matter crowd stumbling around the White House seven years ago
[02:03.920 --> 02:10.000]  Lin Manuel Miranda came to the White House poetry jam this is definitely the
[02:10.000 --> 02:19.080]  room where it happened right here I'm actually working on a hip-hop album it's
[02:19.080 --> 02:22.800]  a concept album about the life of someone I think embodies hip-hop Treasury
[02:22.800 --> 02:29.200]  Secretary Alexander Hamilton you laugh but it's true by 14 then you placed him
[02:29.200 --> 02:33.560]  in charge of the trade and charter and then slaves were being slaughtered
[02:33.560 --> 02:38.480]  and caught it away across the waves our Hamilton kept his guard up inside he was
[02:38.480 --> 02:43.120]  longing for something to be a part of the brothers ready to beg steal our
[02:43.120 --> 02:49.040]  water Hamilton is an amazing story that is beautifully told through Hamilton
[02:49.040 --> 02:53.760]  Lin Manuel reveals all the drama and the glory the heartbreak that run through
[02:53.760 --> 02:58.800]  our nation's history and he shows us that the icons in our history books were
[02:58.800 --> 03:05.480]  real people with real brilliance but also with real flaws so really Hamilton
[03:05.480 --> 03:09.840]  teaches us history the way it really should be taught the entertainment
[03:09.840 --> 03:14.360]  industry's lack of creative minority roles has become par for the course a
[03:14.360 --> 03:18.960]  situation Chris Rock recently brought to the fore at the Academy Awards
[03:18.960 --> 03:25.680]  is Hollywood racist? You're doing right Hollywood's racist but it ain't not racist that you've grown accustomed to
[03:25.680 --> 03:32.920]  Hollywood is sorority racist however diversity in American entertainment is
[03:32.920 --> 03:38.320]  booming in the US while overseas audiences have yet to grasp the concept
[03:38.320 --> 03:43.080]  the Hollywood reporter writes Sony Pictures TV casting director Don
[03:43.080 --> 03:47.680]  Steinberg says it's colorblind casting there used to be a time when it had to
[03:47.680 --> 03:51.840]  be written that way to look for an actor with a specific ethnicity now it's just
[03:51.840 --> 03:56.960]  who is the best actor for the role but when trying to sell overseas American
[03:56.960 --> 04:00.040]  shows are finding the color barrier is still there
[04:00.040 --> 04:04.040]  Marion Edwards president of international TV at Fox says these shows are a
[04:04.040 --> 04:08.840]  reflection of our society but they are not a reflection of all societies take
[04:08.840 --> 04:13.720]  Empire Fox's hip-hop drama appeared to be a slam dunk for the international
[04:13.720 --> 04:19.240]  market Empire has been a global flop the New York City human rights law that the
[04:19.240 --> 04:24.080]  Broadway play Hamilton may have violated was enacted to defend against
[04:24.080 --> 04:28.800]  discrimination the law states it is unlawful for an employer because of the
[04:28.800 --> 04:34.000]  actual or perceived race of any person to discriminate essentially
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.680]  entertainment supposedly aggressively tackling stereotypes has in all of its
[04:39.680 --> 04:45.280]  arrogance dug up the past basically George Soros's black lives matters

[08:36.240 --> 08:42.000]  today I'm Alex Jones your host. Wow there is a lot to cover and a lot to go
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.680]  over today undoubtedly we have all Hades breaking loose over Donald Trump says
[08:47.680 --> 08:57.240]  women should be punished for illegal abortions isn't that interesting
[08:57.240 --> 09:02.840]  illegal abortions should someone be punished if they cut your hair without
[09:02.840 --> 09:09.480]  a license I really don't think so but they have laws on the books all over the
[09:09.480 --> 09:13.280]  country saying you got to have a license to cut somebody's hair a license to
[09:13.280 --> 09:18.040]  paint somebody's nails a license to put cream on somebody's face a license to
[09:18.040 --> 09:22.560]  give somebody a massage and that's supposedly to protect you from back
[09:22.560 --> 09:28.360]  alley cooks and crazies who'll end up getting you killed well we know back
[09:28.360 --> 09:32.360]  alley abortions have killed tens of thousands of women that's one reason they
[09:32.360 --> 09:38.760]  were able to get Roe v Wade rammed through the Supreme Court in 1973 was
[09:38.760 --> 09:42.480]  because there were a lot of back alley abortions and Trump saying we shouldn't
[09:42.480 --> 09:48.840]  have back alley abortions but he has since even backed off of that look
[09:48.840 --> 09:52.640]  here's where I stand on abortion I understand that a lot of women are
[09:52.640 --> 09:57.640]  scared they're poor they've already got kids in some cases they don't know what
[09:57.640 --> 10:02.400]  to do I don't judge those women that have gone out and had abortions I don't
[10:02.400 --> 10:07.000]  think that their devil worshipers or they want to hurt their kids or their
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.480]  evil people they've been told by the culture it's okay they've been told us
[10:11.480 --> 10:18.120]  the way to get out of a bad situation but you've also got to think about the
[10:18.120 --> 10:22.800]  unborn life and stand up for that child as well and that counterbalances the
[10:22.800 --> 10:27.760]  rights of the woman because that is a human and we've devalued human life so
[10:27.760 --> 10:31.960]  much in this country that now they're killing old people on don't treat list
[10:31.960 --> 10:37.560]  veterans wounded veterans they're talking about killing children up to age
[10:37.560 --> 10:41.680]  three they're talking about killing handicap people notice I'm politically
[10:41.680 --> 10:48.760]  correct I'm not supposed to say handicap but you can kill them the left the
[10:48.760 --> 10:53.320]  eugenicists are now pushing getting rid of Down's syndrome children up to age
[10:53.320 --> 11:00.200]  three now don't call them retarded that's mean but killing them is okay see
[11:00.200 --> 11:05.000]  how they take a real right away and then give you a phony language right this is
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.400]  how they scramble it all don't call my grandmother who's had polio since the
[11:10.400 --> 11:20.080]  50s or had polio almost killed her don't call her a cripple but it's okay to
[11:20.080 --> 11:24.640]  give her the second round of the polio vaccine and then one week later she got
[11:24.640 --> 11:29.000]  that exact strain and the doctor told her yeah you probably got it from the
[11:29.000 --> 11:37.000]  vaccine see wound my grandmother for 50 plus years 60 plus years she's 90 now
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.680]  don't talk about the big vaccine scandal but don't you call her a cripple as if
[11:42.680 --> 11:48.520]  crippled is a bad word it's not derogative they said it was derogative
[11:48.520 --> 11:53.560]  they said it was an insult they said be nice let us take control of language
[11:53.560 --> 12:05.080]  let us tell you how to talk call her disabled disabled and then now don't
[12:05.080 --> 12:09.480]  say the word mother or father don't say the word boy or girl say he and G in
[12:09.480 --> 12:13.800]  public schools and colleges all over the Western world and I've got so much
[12:13.800 --> 12:17.400]  news here to start off with today it just shows how the people claiming they
[12:17.400 --> 12:20.520]  want to represent our rights they want to protect us they want to be the
[12:20.520 --> 12:24.640]  arbiters of the rulebook to tell us what words we can use have been
[12:24.640 --> 12:31.160]  maneuvering us towards a post-intellectual world of no communication no
[12:31.160 --> 12:35.840]  information we're all debate is seen as somehow criminal and abusive and
[12:35.840 --> 12:42.200]  oppressive that said there's an extremely powerful video
[12:42.200 --> 12:53.640]  that is up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com that I just tweeted
[12:53.640 --> 13:00.440]  out at real Alex Jones on Twitter that needs to go viral now it's powerful
[13:00.440 --> 13:04.200]  audio-wise for radio listeners but it's really powerful when it comes to the
[13:04.200 --> 13:09.320]  video you need to see it to believe it it is destined to become a meme lately
[13:09.320 --> 13:15.040]  info wars dot com unexpectedly has been seeing some of the biggest traffic in
[13:15.040 --> 13:20.360]  our history from a new source not drudge report not our daily AM and FM
[13:20.360 --> 13:24.880]  audience not Facebook not Twitter not YouTube those are all huge sources those
[13:24.880 --> 13:33.240]  are all our top sources of referral not just original listeners and fans coming
[13:33.240 --> 13:40.600]  every day no our our new biggest amount of traffic ever and I guess articles are
[13:40.600 --> 13:43.760]  being written about it it's being marveled about I wasn't aware of it till
[13:43.760 --> 13:47.120]  last week Buckley ran up and said look at this look at these sites these are
[13:47.120 --> 13:53.560]  meme sites these are things I've been visiting for years this is something
[13:53.560 --> 13:58.000]  Generation X right down to Millennials is into I'm aware of the big sites Reddit
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.840]  and others have it but I don't really follow it and I didn't know that the
[14:01.840 --> 14:07.640]  last two weeks we've had most of the top memes because our listeners are going
[14:07.640 --> 14:12.520]  and getting clips from idiots on the show and clips from anti-trump people
[14:12.520 --> 14:17.120]  and going and making memes out of them and and now info wars has many of the
[14:17.120 --> 14:21.600]  top memes we should do a report on it we haven't really talked about it yet
[14:21.600 --> 14:27.440]  because it's so over the top the weirdos that attack our camera people
[14:27.440 --> 14:31.680]  whether it's Chicago or whether it's Appleton Wisconsin or whether it's
[14:31.680 --> 14:37.920]  New York City or Washington DC run up like arrogant mentally ill cartoon
[14:37.920 --> 14:42.600]  characters totally whacked out of their brains old young black white it doesn't
[14:42.600 --> 14:47.880]  matter and they say the most ridiculous stuff you've ever seen and they do it
[14:47.880 --> 14:55.240]  with real weird slurping strange utterances and strange ticks that are
[14:55.240 --> 15:05.680]  the ambrosia the finest mother's milk to the meme makers who by the way are not
[15:05.680 --> 15:09.840]  conservative they're not libertarian they're not they're just into
[15:09.840 --> 15:15.280]  entertainment and I don't know how we hit the zeitgeist here but we've now
[15:15.280 --> 15:19.920]  hit the zeitgeist of memes I mean sure they've always had fun with things I do
[15:19.920 --> 15:23.680]  that are silly and I certainly enjoy it please make more goofy memes of yours
[15:23.680 --> 15:33.400]  truly I love it but these people it is sickeningly ridiculous you watch MSNBC
[15:33.400 --> 15:39.440]  you watch CNN all they do is tell you how intellectual and smart liberals are
[15:39.440 --> 15:44.280]  and how they are the most cool avant-garde cutting-edge philanthropists on
[15:44.280 --> 15:49.880]  the planet lovers of humanity and when you actually go out to these events I
[15:49.880 --> 15:58.560]  have never seen less light in someone's eyes they look like they're dead less
[15:58.560 --> 16:04.760]  control of language more unhealthy looking people they have been raised
[16:04.760 --> 16:09.200]  latchkey children in front of television sets their victims and I
[16:09.200 --> 16:13.240]  shouldn't call them walnut heads and pea brains and idiots but I'm just honest
[16:13.240 --> 16:17.400]  when I see something and I say it I'm not on a power trip calling him totally
[16:17.400 --> 16:21.800]  stupid I mean I am frightened by them but the reason I go one step further
[16:21.800 --> 16:28.200]  calling them scum of the earth is to a person they run up and try to stop other
[16:28.200 --> 16:34.360]  people talking to our camera men they run up and they try to get in our face
[16:34.360 --> 16:38.240]  they run up and they try to stop us talking there was a Hispanic lady
[16:38.240 --> 16:43.080]  telling a white Trump supporter you know you shouldn't be against illegals we
[16:43.080 --> 16:47.000]  grow the food we cook your food and he says look lady I grow my own food he
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.760]  been talking earlier about raw milk at me and a farmer we were doing an
[16:49.760 --> 16:53.840]  interview and he's like I'm not against in the longer interview Hispanics we've
[16:53.840 --> 16:57.880]  got to have a border Mexico has a border this is all globalism it's a takeover
[16:57.880 --> 17:01.280]  and she's sitting there talking to him and she's not that bad of a person she's
[17:01.280 --> 17:05.200]  just as saying hey we produce we're humans too and I get that whole argument
[17:05.200 --> 17:10.920]  it's absolutely true it's the social justice warrior white knight I think
[17:10.920 --> 17:18.800]  it's a man that runs over and says check yourself folks we're not joking when we
[17:18.800 --> 17:21.960]  we talk about this when we played a bunch of videos last week where women
[17:21.960 --> 17:26.280]  walk over to men and say you're not allowed to talk or videotape you're a
[17:26.280 --> 17:34.840]  white male you are surrounded by your white privilege and they mean it folks
[17:34.840 --> 17:39.000]  they're not unin that they're not trying to be funny they're unintentionally
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.440]  funny but here's the deal if I wasn't laughing I'd be crying because these are
[17:43.440 --> 17:50.040]  dangerous P-brains conversely I've seen the white supremacist marching in
[17:50.040 --> 17:57.400]  Germany and in Sweden and in Belgium and they are the exact same type people

[24:28.240 --> 24:33.280]  of a kind collectors edition t-shirts on them was the Obama Joker shirt our best
[24:33.280 --> 24:37.360]  seller ever and I just said it was gonna end that year and it ended but we've
[24:37.360 --> 24:40.760]  had so many complaints some people that are angry about the original Hillary for
[24:40.760 --> 24:44.920]  present shirt being now sold out for two or three months because we didn't
[24:44.920 --> 24:49.480]  produce anymore like I said that we're gonna bring back the basic original
[24:49.480 --> 24:53.560]  design as you know Polo has designer shirts every year but like two things
[24:53.560 --> 24:57.720]  are different on them so the shirt you have is an original collectors edition
[24:57.720 --> 25:00.960]  we're just gonna change one thing on the front and one thing on the back we're
[25:00.960 --> 25:06.040]  gonna change info wars.com legalized freedom on the back from white to red on

[25:10.000 --> 25:18.080]  shirt Hillary for present 2016 and something like and forever or until the
[25:18.080 --> 25:22.640]  end of time that's what I decided and and till the end of time because it
[25:22.640 --> 25:25.760]  looks like she may be indicted any minute she is in deep trouble so we need
[25:25.760 --> 25:29.520]  to celebrate the first amendment she tried to intimidate it we are now
[25:29.520 --> 25:32.440]  sending that proof of that shirt off today being made right here in America
[25:32.440 --> 25:35.520]  and we will have them shipped here by next week so we're gonna put them up for
[25:35.520 --> 25:40.080]  sale tomorrow pre-order but it's only a week and a half you'll be waiting maximum
[25:40.080 --> 25:46.120]  for the original shirt augmented so it is a new design technically it is a new
[25:46.120 --> 25:49.200]  addition because I will not lie to people but I'm just being honest that
[25:49.200 --> 25:53.760]  I'm almost fudging I feel bad doing it but it you want it so I'm sure you're
[25:53.760 --> 25:59.880]  not mad at me. Speaking of that look at dredgerport.com
[25:59.880 --> 26:06.080]  Hillary has a date with the FBI that's out of the Washington Times the FBI
[26:06.080 --> 26:14.200]  talks Hillary while Bill trolls Obama and they are now setting up the date do
[26:14.200 --> 26:20.920]  Hillary and Bill sends a breakdown in whatever deal they may have struck with
[26:20.920 --> 26:24.760]  President Obama to protect his presidential ambitions is whatever
[26:24.760 --> 26:28.400]  negotiation they may have been conducting over her email server problem and the
[26:28.400 --> 26:32.760]  inside information she may have had on him now imploding or have the Clintons
[26:32.760 --> 26:38.600]  won the negotiation with Mr. Obama freeing them to hit him publicly to get
[26:38.600 --> 26:43.000]  her elected and the article goes over the fact that the Clintons are now
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.720]  attacking Obama just like he started two weeks ago saying that Obama you know
[26:47.720 --> 26:53.600]  has a horrible eight-year legacy and now they're officially attacking him and now
[26:53.600 --> 26:57.560]  the FBI officially says they're about to meet with her and will announce the date
[26:57.560 --> 27:08.760]  here very very soon so what's really going on meanwhile behind the facade of
[27:08.760 --> 27:15.760]  this innocent-looking fake Texans cowboy hat speaking of Ted Cruz not yours truly
[27:15.760 --> 27:20.920]  I'm a fake Texan too who wants to be a Texan anyway I too and from Canada by
[27:20.920 --> 27:25.360]  the way nothing against Canada I'm being sarcastic I'm from Texas Cruz jokes
[27:25.360 --> 27:31.240]  about running over Trump with his car and I have the clip from Jimmy Kimmel
[27:31.240 --> 27:35.680]  and it's very well deliberated out we'll play it later very well thought out by
[27:35.680 --> 27:42.600]  Cruz back we'll just play it in a moment and he just makes the big joke and then
[27:42.600 --> 27:47.720]  has a scripted Star Wars joke and CNN cut back to the clip they played it this
[27:47.720 --> 27:52.200]  morning and just really liked Ted Cruz so he's just such a darling none the
[27:52.200 --> 27:55.720]  bushes have endorsed him and so much more and he's funded by Goldman Sachs and
[27:55.720 --> 27:59.720]  the Council on Foreign Relations and helped write the TPP for Bush senior
[27:59.720 --> 28:05.200]  with his wife he's now uncloking as the fourth attempt by the bushes to secure
[28:05.200 --> 28:08.880]  the winehouse now they've done it the last three times and they were smart
[28:08.880 --> 28:12.040]  enough to know their name may have been run in the mud so will there be three
[28:12.040 --> 28:28.440]  Cruz presidencies now let's go to the club I dislike Obama's policies more I
[28:28.440 --> 28:35.920]  see but but Donald Donald is a unique individual I will say I was watching the
[28:35.920 --> 28:39.720]  early part of the show and if I were in my car and getting ready to reverse and
[28:39.720 --> 28:52.680]  saw Donald in the backup camera I'm not confident which pedal that was given
[28:52.680 --> 29:02.040]  star legal approval to be able to put that out legal approval guaranteed so he
[29:02.040 --> 29:05.360]  could be ambiguous well he could a secret service visit for that because the
[29:05.360 --> 29:09.360]  New York Times writer calling for him to be killed other people calling for him
[29:09.360 --> 29:14.280]  to be killed countless musicians calling for him to be killed movie stars
[29:14.280 --> 29:18.080]  calling for him to be killed thousands of tweets that's conservative probably
[29:18.080 --> 29:22.560]  tens of thousands calling for him to be killed this is an atmosphere calling for
[29:22.560 --> 29:28.240]  violence against Trump and Trump rallies so that his supporters Bernie Sanders
[29:28.240 --> 29:32.520]  Hillary supporters you name it feel emboldened to go up and attack Donald
[29:32.520 --> 29:36.840]  Trump supporters they're the ones pushing the climate of violence they're the
[29:36.840 --> 29:41.600]  ones pushing the Nazi-style brown shirt thugs in the street agenda and we've
[29:41.600 --> 29:45.560]  got video of that and more coming up after the break stay with us I'm Alex
[29:45.560 --> 29:54.120]  Jones we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[30:01.400 --> 30:07.440]  nuns to buy abortion insurance it should be a reminder of how absurd it is to
[30:07.440 --> 30:12.400]  trust our liberty to nine political appointees who believe the Constitution
[30:12.400 --> 30:17.600]  can be amended by their opinion NBC News reports that a quarter of Republican
[30:17.600 --> 30:21.960]  senators now want to meet with Obama's Supreme Court nominee much has been said
[30:21.960 --> 30:25.920]  about Obama's nominee Merrick Garland's record opposing the Second Amendment
[30:25.920 --> 30:29.720]  what hasn't been talked about is his long record of rubber stamping any rule
[30:29.720 --> 30:34.680]  from any federal regulatory agency Garland will be a reliable ally of the
[30:34.680 --> 30:39.720]  real government federal bureaucracies with Scalia's death the Supreme Court is
[30:39.720 --> 30:43.880]  expected to be deadlocked on Obama's EPA regulations to shut down the coal
[30:43.880 --> 30:49.120]  industry the lower court on which Garland now serves will have the final say he
[30:49.120 --> 30:53.080]  will take Scalia's place on this important issue regardless of whether he
[30:53.080 --> 31:09.760]  takes Scalia's place on the court for info wars com I'm David Knight thank you

[35:02.240 --> 35:12.080]  predator belongs the dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras
[35:12.080 --> 35:15.600]  parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night
[35:15.600 --> 35:19.240]  hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the
[35:19.240 --> 35:23.000]  muzzle of a SWAT officers rifle they let them in the area they told them they
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.200]  could come in and now they're coming in like their trespassers punching and
[35:26.200 --> 35:35.120]  shoving people
[35:35.120 --> 35:42.720]  we are on the March the Empire is on the run live from the info wars.com
[35:42.720 --> 35:59.480]  studios it's Alex Jones
[35:59.480 --> 36:04.680]  the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will
[36:04.680 --> 36:14.160]  persist America for all its problems is what is left of the
[36:14.160 --> 36:19.160]  renaissance what is left of the Magna Carta what is left of the spirit of
[36:19.160 --> 36:25.800]  1776 I'm your host Alex Jones we are broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday
[36:25.800 --> 36:36.000]  already the 31st day of March 2016 former senators and members of the 9-11
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.200]  Commission as well as the Congressional Commission have gone public that have
[36:39.200 --> 36:44.200]  seen the 28 pages and said that it shows an order for NORAD the Pentagon to
[36:44.200 --> 36:48.560]  stand down on 9-11 and that the FBI had been ordered to stand down when wanting
[36:48.560 --> 36:52.960]  to go after the hijackers that all came out in the news at the time the FBI
[36:52.960 --> 36:59.320]  agents from Illinois and Minnesota and Arizona and Texas and Florida and
[36:59.320 --> 37:04.760]  California all went public many of them got demoted many of them got in trouble
[37:04.760 --> 37:11.840]  instead of getting medals and said that they were ordered to stand down well the
[37:11.840 --> 37:15.600]  specifics Congress learned and the Intelligence Committee learned in close
[37:15.600 --> 37:23.160]  session they were ordered to stand down six months before 9-11 right through 9-11
[37:23.160 --> 37:26.880]  you notice a few months before 9-11 Chris Carter on the lone gunman a spinoff of
[37:26.880 --> 37:36.120]  X files aired an episode that the CIA had approached them on the talking points
[37:36.120 --> 37:40.000]  where a criminal element in the government hijacks a passenger jet by
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.520]  remote control to fly it into the World Trade Center to blame it on Afghanistan
[37:45.520 --> 37:51.000]  start a worldwide war and a set of a police state in America nor ads ordered
[37:51.000 --> 37:57.440]  to stand down in the TV show because they're told it's a terrorism drill not
[37:57.440 --> 38:04.120]  a real hijacking that happened a few months later on 9-11 we all wondered
[38:04.120 --> 38:10.600]  why it was in the piece we've basically confirmed it was a warning leaked
[38:10.600 --> 38:15.440]  through and still the criminal elements didn't care that it had been put out on
[38:15.440 --> 38:21.360]  television they went ahead with it I was always saying revelation of the method
[38:21.360 --> 38:24.680]  throwing it in our face preparing us but now I've tracked it back I'm gonna just
[38:24.680 --> 38:28.280]  stop there later I'll be able to bring all this out super dangerous obviously
[38:28.280 --> 38:35.220]  not so much for me but other people that that's why there were warnings to the
[38:35.220 --> 38:38.640]  FBI and the CIA most people in the government don't want to be part of
[38:38.640 --> 38:42.080]  stuff like this it's highly compartmentalized criminal elements did it
[38:42.080 --> 38:46.600]  that's why the government in general is not our enemy now be honest with you
[38:46.600 --> 38:50.280]  15 years ago I wasn't sophisticated enough or didn't have enough time to
[38:50.280 --> 38:53.960]  figure out what this stuff was I just said there's no way they had a plot of
[38:53.960 --> 39:04.880]  a show that's exactly what fits happen in reality well now we know it's amazing
[39:04.880 --> 39:10.960]  it's sensational it's incredible and it's real truth is strange the fashion I
[39:10.960 --> 39:15.440]  want to get into the over-the-top China news over-the-top over-the-top attacks
[39:15.440 --> 39:21.400]  on free speech over-the-top police-state activity University of North Carolina
[39:21.400 --> 39:24.960]  diversity workshop brands
[39:25.800 --> 39:32.640]  band-aids as white privilege yeah that's what most Harris Perry's would teach on
[39:32.640 --> 39:39.520]  MSNBC that hot water is white privilege that clothing is white privilege what
[39:39.520 --> 39:43.400]  you have any idea how many whites have been slaves in history or have been
[39:43.400 --> 39:47.680]  homeless I mean I'm just tired of it it's this myth that like I have rocket
[39:47.680 --> 39:55.840]  boosters on me like Iron Man when I get up in the morning and I fly around I
[39:55.840 --> 40:00.000]  don't get diseases I don't get sick what was the latest thing Bernie Sanders
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.800]  said white people white people over white people don't know what it's like to be
[40:05.800 --> 40:17.260]  poor was it something like 18% of white people are below the poverty line we
[40:17.260 --> 40:23.240]  drove around Joe Biggs did we found quite a few poor white people and we
[40:23.240 --> 40:26.080]  talked to so-called minorities I say that because most areas minorities the
[40:26.080 --> 40:29.840]  majority and they just couldn't they couldn't believe it so that's pure
[40:29.840 --> 40:35.400]  bull so this is this idea let me give everybody a newsflash all our kids are
[40:35.400 --> 40:38.360]  getting bombarded by television having their brains rewired all our kids are
[40:38.360 --> 40:41.080]  getting hit with fluoride all our kids are having deadly vaccines planted at
[40:41.080 --> 40:45.640]  them all our kids are having GMO shoved at them and dies and chemicals and MSG
[40:45.640 --> 40:51.760]  and aspartame we're all under globalist attack they just want us fighting with
[40:51.760 --> 40:56.480]  each other so we're not aware of that but I'm gonna stop right there like that
[40:56.480 --> 41:00.200]  movie the Kingsman where they put a wavelength program out be all the
[41:00.200 --> 41:04.360]  smartphones and TVs to make everybody kill each other that's a dumb down
[41:04.360 --> 41:08.280]  allegory of what they're actually doing
[41:08.800 --> 41:12.840]  literally through flicker rates of the TV but then a bunch of other cultural
[41:12.840 --> 41:19.080]  brainwashing and the rest of it remember Pokemon 15 years ago made tens of
[41:19.080 --> 41:22.640]  thousands of kids in Japan the US have convulsions fall and bust their heads
[41:22.640 --> 41:28.960]  open some of them died with flashing lights and a certain rhythm folks you
[41:28.960 --> 41:34.040]  can go to UT psychology department go right in there of your student a PhD
[41:34.040 --> 41:38.360]  level go right in the DARPA funded areas and that's literally what they're
[41:38.360 --> 41:42.320]  obsessed with they have got flicker rates that'll make a grown man in about 30
[41:42.320 --> 41:45.520]  seconds fall down on the ground
[41:48.320 --> 41:54.120]  that's fact they can knock you out but they don't want to be too obvious they
[41:54.120 --> 41:59.880]  want to just slowly test it slowly find ways you ask why the public seems to be
[41:59.880 --> 42:05.680]  in a mindless trance they're in highly suggestible near sleep sleepwalking
[42:05.680 --> 42:10.320]  trances they're jellyfish that watch TV and play video games up to 10 hours a
[42:10.320 --> 42:13.560]  day they don't want to be told they shouldn't do that they have hypnotic
[42:13.560 --> 42:19.720]  suggestions planted to get angry if you warn them they're addicted they live in
[42:19.720 --> 42:23.680]  a false world and then they're only activated by having to go to work or
[42:23.680 --> 42:29.640]  school or whatever and by messages in TV of when it's time to go zombie attack
[42:29.640 --> 42:36.400]  Donald Trump races Donald Trump hateful must get him must kill him and that's
[42:36.400 --> 42:42.720]  the messages from Trump and the New York the Trump haters like Cruz and the New
[42:42.720 --> 42:46.960]  York Times and all of the publications saying somebody kill him kill him kill
[42:46.960 --> 42:50.640]  him how dare his people attack the loving protesters who are actually
[42:50.640 --> 42:58.280]  attacking they're legitimizing and all what's the movie is it major league to
[42:58.280 --> 43:03.120]  where is it naked gun two or three I forget I was surfing through cable like
[43:03.120 --> 43:10.200]  six months ago and and and saw one with the naked gun actor and is it OJ Simpson
[43:10.200 --> 43:16.680]  must kill guys go to YouTube and type in OJ Simpson no no it's not OJ Simpson
[43:16.680 --> 43:21.440]  he's another one saying must kill it's a strawberry famous baseball player and
[43:21.440 --> 43:27.120]  then he's got to kill Drebben I think that's the name of the detective it's
[43:27.120 --> 43:32.600]  about like that except it's not as a hundred percent like sir hand sir hand
[43:32.600 --> 43:36.680]  was drugged he was drooling the police said he shot the ground his hand was
[43:36.680 --> 43:41.640]  held down we know the guy behind him CIA from a skunk works base nearby that
[43:41.640 --> 43:47.120]  shot him in the back that's all come out it's in the LAPD report but it's
[43:47.120 --> 43:52.080]  happening total mind control it's a highly suggestible population yeah there
[43:52.080 --> 43:56.520]  it is naked gun Reggie Jackson folks I don't follow I don't follow baseball I
[43:56.520 --> 44:04.000]  just knew it was famous baseball player so we can try to cue that up I want to
[44:04.000 --> 44:07.440]  show that because that's hilarious until you understand you make it
[44:07.440 --> 44:12.120]  suggestible you go on mainstream television and say it's legitimate to
[44:12.120 --> 44:16.400]  kill XYZ he deserves to be killed and you've got tens of millions of viewers
[44:16.400 --> 44:20.400]  there's a good chance one of those people when you're having a public rally is
[44:20.400 --> 44:27.840]  going to take a shot at you or try to kill you and so it's basically like the
[44:27.840 --> 44:32.000]  mafia saying who's going to take care of this problem for me you're not giving
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.920]  the order for somebody to be killed you're just doing it now let me stop and
[44:34.920 --> 44:40.680]  get into this news because I'm kind of kind of digressing here first off the
[44:40.680 --> 44:44.120]  good news is we're selling a lot of vitamin mineral fusion the latest

[46:51.640 --> 46:55.040]  you think about it in fact it's so good my mouth is watering I keep getting
[46:55.040 --> 46:58.400]  busy during the breaks working on news well one of the great crew one of the
[46:58.400 --> 47:03.240]  great interns or whoever can I have one scoop of this ice cubes and some of
[47:03.240 --> 47:08.320]  that some of that pro pure filtered water please because I actually started
[47:08.320 --> 47:12.600]  I'm not kidding it was involuntary this is the best tasting fruit punch because
[47:12.600 --> 47:15.080]  when it's sugary fruit punch there's something weird about it you know it
[47:15.080 --> 47:18.520]  tastes good or when it's stuff with other artificial flavors that might even
[47:18.520 --> 47:23.440]  be not bad for you it's still just some weird taste this is so game-changing
[47:23.440 --> 47:30.040]  but there's so many permutations of it that it's naturally sweetened by just
[47:30.040 --> 47:35.640]  what's in it like a thousand daily intake of vitamin C and it's the actual
[47:35.640 --> 47:39.760]  you know organic form of vitamin C which itself tastes good I mean it's just
[47:39.760 --> 47:43.360]  it's flavored by the vitamins and minerals that are in it it's crazy my
[47:43.360 --> 47:47.160]  mouth is watering that is not a pitch it was watering I said why not just be
[47:47.160 --> 47:52.520]  honest about it wait till you taste this my only problem is it's so super
[47:52.520 --> 47:57.120]  neurotic so clean so good the best sources to get all these ingredients
[47:57.120 --> 48:01.440]  together to be able to do a run was hard we finally three months ago four months
[48:01.440 --> 48:05.560]  ago actually green-lighted the final formulation it took a couple months just
[48:05.560 --> 48:09.680]  to get the ingredients and that's why big companies that even have you know
[48:09.680 --> 48:14.520]  quality stuff still isn't to this level because they wouldn't be able to operate
[48:14.520 --> 48:17.920]  on a mass scale that's our problem is it's almost becoming boutique
[48:17.920 --> 48:22.840]  nutraceuticals because sometimes we can't get what we were getting we have
[48:22.840 --> 48:25.880]  to change the formulation and then make that announcement that's why we've
[48:25.880 --> 48:33.160]  changed super male twice super female twice we had to change job we had to
[48:33.160 --> 48:36.940]  change the deep cleanse what was it from Himalayan Shiligita Russian
[48:36.940 --> 48:41.120]  Shiligita same mountain ranges but and we couldn't put it out for like six months
[48:41.120 --> 48:43.720]  because we couldn't get it anyways I'm digressing I have news to cover I
[48:43.720 --> 48:48.960]  apologize in fourslife.com in four store.com vitamin mineral fusion get yours

[48:59.840 --> 49:02.440]  tell you how many stations were on when we start out on the weekend with a Sunday
[49:02.440 --> 49:05.440]  show to put their toe in the water and within six months we're on at night and
[49:05.440 --> 49:09.840]  then within a year we're on during the day live it's because we get good ratings
[49:09.840 --> 49:14.640]  a lot of folks tune in support get great ratings top ratings in many cases but
[49:14.640 --> 49:19.600]  also the support comes through a lot of times after that 15th hundred dollar bill
[49:19.600 --> 49:23.680]  or $20 bill comes in to a station manager thinking they go that Alex Jones what
[49:23.680 --> 49:27.200]  are his ratings yeah they've gone up on Sunday's current in three months put him
[49:27.200 --> 49:31.200]  on weeknights and a few months later that does well all right let's give them
[49:31.200 --> 49:35.760]  an hour live the rest at night and then after a few months all three hours all
[49:35.760 --> 49:40.920]  four hours live happening all over the country then the station sells or it
[49:40.920 --> 49:44.360]  changes format and that that's you know we get up to like 200 affiliates it
[49:44.360 --> 49:47.760]  always goes back down we've never gotten above 200 affiliates like 180
[49:47.760 --> 49:51.400]  something right now they're always changing and that's just the way talk
[49:51.400 --> 49:55.040]  radio is but and we're not part of a big there's two big companies that have a
[49:55.040 --> 49:59.040]  duopoly or an oligopoly probably the better term there's three companies
[49:59.040 --> 50:04.200]  total but two of them have like 90% of the stations there's thousands and
[50:04.200 --> 50:07.480]  thousands radio stations in the country but only a few hundred that could pick
[50:07.480 --> 50:11.240]  this show up and be independent and they're the ones doing it actually had
[50:11.240 --> 50:14.760]  soft to clear channel they put me just out of a business decision eight years
[50:14.760 --> 50:20.840]  ago on XM and it got top signups made him a lot of money had a lot of listeners
[50:20.840 --> 50:24.720]  and we shared the advertising with them just executives remark I wanted to make
[50:24.720 --> 50:29.160]  money plus I was told those those a lot talk so I'm those guys were libertarians
[50:29.160 --> 50:32.880]  and then there was a merger happened Goldman Sachs came in and I was thrown
[50:32.880 --> 50:39.360]  off with over 200 other libertarian Patriots so I said didn't matter it was
[50:39.360 --> 50:42.240]  successful didn't matter you tuned in I mean they're doing everything they can
[50:42.240 --> 50:48.120]  to shut us off folks everything they can I mean I'll admit clear channel actually
[50:48.120 --> 50:51.760]  put us on a few stations they manage them things just because we get high ratings

[54:39.400 --> 54:42.520]  son don't want a box and stuff and like accidentally punch into my fist when
[54:42.520 --> 54:48.800]  we're shadow boxing it's like ah I tell you getting old is is is is interesting
[54:48.800 --> 54:53.240]  and I'm not that old I'm 42 but I tell you I tell you I can't imagine what it's

[54:56.480 --> 54:59.040]  because I've got to get reconstructive surgery the doctors told me on three
[54:59.040 --> 55:02.960]  knuckles the knuckles are completely collapsed and gone and the tendons now
[55:02.960 --> 55:06.520]  go basically up underneath each other so I'm not whining I'm not complaining I
[55:06.520 --> 55:10.880]  need to start taking the inforce life comm joint and bone formula because I'm
[55:10.880 --> 55:15.200]  told it really helps I'm just not in the mode of taking all these pills but
[55:15.200 --> 55:18.720]  everything else I've taken ends up helping so I need to do that didn't mean
[55:18.720 --> 55:24.280]  to do a plug right there from force life comm but I just did it in inadvertently
[55:24.280 --> 55:29.680]  all right let me get into the news that's coming up after Congressman Walter
[55:29.680 --> 55:34.640]  Jones currently of North Carolina joins us for the first 30 minutes in the
[55:34.640 --> 55:37.760]  second half of the transmission I'm going to open the phones up and play
[55:37.760 --> 55:44.280]  tons of clips and get into all of the other news because there is so much of
[55:44.280 --> 55:50.000]  it the political correctness is kind of really going to a new level right now
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.040]  again wanting to say that band-aids are part of white privilege I'm not kidding
[55:54.040 --> 55:57.920]  that's coming up that's being taught in colleges right now you don't pay to go
[55:57.920 --> 56:00.320]  to college you don't pay for your children to go to college so they
[56:00.320 --> 56:03.840]  actually get a job you you pay to go lose them and have them further
[56:03.840 --> 56:10.600]  indoctrinated by the system we're also going to play the video meet the dumb
[56:10.600 --> 56:16.240]  bleepers who hate Trump and they try to come over and stop people's free speech
[56:16.240 --> 56:22.440]  when they try to talk to the media because they're so incredibly liberal and
[56:22.440 --> 56:26.320]  so incredibly cool we're also going to get into the heart of the problem
[56:26.320 --> 56:31.880]  children now spend less time outside than the average prisoner also this ties
[56:31.880 --> 56:34.520]  into Donald Trump and we have the clip here we're gonna play just a moment of
[56:34.520 --> 56:40.000]  a Trump on punishing women that quote get illegal abortions FDA authorizes
[56:40.000 --> 56:47.960]  expanded use of medical abortion pill but first let's go to the clip of Trump
[56:47.960 --> 56:52.600]  that they're saying is the biggest faux pas yet every faux pas only many more
[56:52.600 --> 56:57.640]  popular saying women should be punished for illegal abortions here it is what
[56:57.640 --> 57:01.880]  should the woman be punished for having abortion look this is not something you
[57:01.880 --> 57:06.280]  can dodge it's a if you say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder you have
[57:06.280 --> 57:11.320]  to deal with it under the law should abortion be punished well people in
[57:11.320 --> 57:15.280]  certain parts of the Republican Party and conservative Republicans would say
[57:15.280 --> 57:20.160]  yes they should be part of you I would say that it's a very serious problem and
[57:20.160 --> 57:24.920]  it's a problem that we have to decide on is it's very you're for me to say well
[57:24.920 --> 57:28.920]  wait are you gonna say put them in jail I know what I'm asking you because you
[57:28.920 --> 57:33.400]  say you want to ban it I would I am against I am pro-life yes how do you
[57:33.400 --> 57:36.520]  ban abortion how do you actually do it well you know you'll go back to a
[57:36.520 --> 57:42.680]  position like they had where people will perhaps go to illegal places yeah but
[57:42.680 --> 57:45.880]  you have to ban it I'm you ban and they go to somebody who try to flunk out of
[57:45.880 --> 57:49.120]  medical school are you Catholic yes I think I know how do you feel about the
[57:49.120 --> 57:53.120]  Catholic Church's position I accept the teaching authority of my church on moral
[57:53.120 --> 57:57.160]  issues but do you know their position on abortion yes I do and do you concur
[57:57.160 --> 58:00.440]  with that position I concur with their moral position but legally I get to the
[58:00.440 --> 58:03.360]  question here's my problem no but let me ask you but what do you say
[58:03.360 --> 58:06.840]  about it's not funny your church yeah it's really not funny what do you say
[58:06.840 --> 58:09.520]  about your church they're very very strong they're allowed to but the church
[58:09.520 --> 58:12.320]  has made their moral judgments but you ready for president I states will be
[58:12.320 --> 58:16.680]  chief executive that's enough do you believe but you believe and so all he
[58:16.680 --> 58:19.240]  says that we have to look at it they turn that into he wants to put women in
[58:19.240 --> 58:24.520]  prison very reasonable answer unscripted that's what you want that's not
[58:24.520 --> 58:28.600]  controversial at all if we're gonna ban it again like it isn't so many other
[58:28.600 --> 58:32.680]  countries then there will probably be some type of punishment for going and
[58:32.680 --> 58:36.200]  getting illegal abortion the truth is women will just go to Canada or other
[58:36.200 --> 58:40.840]  country but the point is this is about eugenics it's not about abortion folks
[58:40.840 --> 58:47.680]  and plus Trump's not even going there stay with us

[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:35.160]  We brought TV originally to radio about 18 years ago. Drudge kind of gives me
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.600]  dips on that and he's right we have trailblaze on that front it's fun to
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.960]  trailblaze but we're not pretty much a TV production but with talk radio style
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.560]  on the radio and on television but during the break I was actually mixing
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:54.160]  some of the new flagship product then fourslife.com vitamin mineral fusion fruit
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.840]  punch drink one little tiny scooper is it so concentrated into a whole glass of
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:03.120]  water and it's almost too sweet and almost too strong for me but I just love
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.520]  the flavor that's why this stuff is so incredible is gonna be such a game
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.480]  changer no reviews yet because it just came out yesterday in fourslife.com
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:14.720]  I'm gonna stop plugging I was just describing for TV viewers during the
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:19.280]  break I actually just took over and was talking during the break and mixing some
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.360]  of this because it's so amazing by the way there's no reason even plug it it's
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.320]  gonna sell out by next week but I'm excited about the product because as
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.560]  soon as we're able to get enough of a mass produced I think it's gonna be a
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:34.960]  game changer and may actually help fund us to the next level take on the
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:39.560]  globalist and then I won't have to beat my brains out trying to raise money to
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:44.480]  fund this operation like I know local station owners have to do as well most
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.080]  newspapers are bankrupt they've been bought by foreign interest to just
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:53.560]  influence pedal and engage in political disinformation. Foreign leaders, Mexican
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:59.760]  kingpins, Russian kingpins, Chinese kingpins, EU kingpins that's in the news
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.440]  we are such a joke when Donald Trump talks about foreign interest coming in
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:09.080]  and taking over that's why we the people have to go out and support independent
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.360]  liberty-based media that will tell the truth even if you don't just you know
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:20.400]  agree with all of it I don't agree with maybe 20% of what Donald Trump has to
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:26.200]  say but I like his brashness I like his political incorrectness I like his
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:31.600]  nationalism I like what he's doing when it comes to sovereignty he's a
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:37.240]  nationalist their globalist he's the answer I mean here's an example they
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.800]  say if you throw a vampire in a big fire they'll catch on fire and burn up now I
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.320]  don't want to stick my arm in a fire I don't agree with everything the fire is
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.040]  doing but I I do want to throw the globalist onto the big burning pit of
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:53.760]  coals and 50-foot flame shooting up that is Donald Trump he's kind of like the
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.280]  oven you know that Hansel and Gretel trick the witch on going in they close
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:02.120]  the door and you know what I mean so Trump I have some weird analogies off
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:06.120]  the top of my head some of them are really stupid but whatever the point is
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:12.600]  is there you go that's what's going on we have Congressman Walter Jones coming
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.800]  on a very very serious information on multi fronts the latest on the 28 pages

[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.360]  them have their own black only deal oh but you see here's my problem they're

[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.480]  finance terror and truly protecting and securing this republic then coming up
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:52.720]  we're going to get into the latest jihad activity I mean you know the last 15 16
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:57.920]  years is 9-11 this isn't a topic I covered a lot because the threat was
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:03.320]  sporadic and much of it was being authorized by criminals in our
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:07.560]  government and Saudi Arabia now ISIS is a real army they're being allowed into
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.520]  Europe the US there are sleeper cells you already seeing them and them attack
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:16.640]  this is a real threat folks the threat is real Italy gears up for hundreds of
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:21.360]  thousands of new migrants other European routes closed this ties into what
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:26.440]  Jones is about to talk about the other Jones the congressman Jones because
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:30.360]  ISIS said over a year ago we're gonna flood you with millions a lot of them
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:34.080]  are our fighters we got sleeper cells they said that they've done it they're
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.680]  bringing them in they're not stopping them they're bringing them in here
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:44.000]  they're not vetting them look at San Bernardino French fashion mogul hits out
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.760]  at Islamic clothing because all the top designers are coming out with Islamic
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:51.000]  garb as the new style he says why are you oppressing women quote the
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.640]  enslavement of women the left is behind this they're giving the radical Islamists
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:59.440]  the keys this is crazy
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:04.960]  periberg Islamic State is on the brink of using nuclear weapons chilling
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:08.400]  report Daily Express gonna get to that Europe's Muslims hate the West
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:16.680]  Politico that is just some of what's coming up on that front today but we
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.720]  can't control our borders everybody knows I've got some issues with Donald
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:24.240]  Trump on his spying and torture and the rest of it he's backed off that but I
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:28.320]  like his nationalism I like where he stands against NAFTA and get one-sided
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:33.760]  trade deals with China representative Walter Jones has done just as much great
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:37.160]  work as somebody like Ron Paul who I also respect and who's a routine guest he
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.800]  just is unsung because the media it wants to ignore what he's doing because
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:44.320]  it's so good and he doesn't want to be complimented but we need to know the
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:49.080]  great work he's doing 28 pages dot org jones dot house dot gov the reason I
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:52.680]  introduced him with those earlier articles is for years he's been pushing
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:56.600]  with members of the congressional previous committee it was congressional
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:00.000]  committee not nine nine eleven committee to be clear but they also had
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.720]  somewhere findings that there were 28 pages to reintroduce this that showed
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:10.280]  major Saudi link stand down by our government what the FBI had basically
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:16.040]  already told us happened but the proof from a secret congressional report this
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:21.160]  is bombshell because it's ongoing and Saudi Arabia is quarterbacking ISIS and
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:26.040]  al-Qaeda today and trying to menace the west into submission if this comes out
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:32.080]  it'll unravel the whole plan by Obama and others to bring these people in now
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:36.000]  congressman Jones doesn't like to speculate but I tell you this isn't
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.560]  speculation now if you look out your window and see a tornado 500 yards away
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:44.080]  coming right at you tearing up barns they're opening this up they're
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.760]  funding these groups they're protecting them Saudi Arabia is running it the
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.640]  pentagons come out and talk about that they're coming into the country they're
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.320]  being allowed to attack now more than ever we need to get this out and the
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.640]  reason I prefaced it is congressman Jones and a handful of others like former
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:03.440]  senator Graham and others have valiantly and members of the 9-11 Commission
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.000]  even though they weren't part of congressional commission they've come
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.760]  out and said release it because there was a cover-up and now more than ever
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:14.800]  this cover-up has to come out to expose us in the good news is Donald Trump the
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.160]  last few months has been saying hey there's secret pages they need to be
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.000]  brought out he's been talking about the having a press conference with the
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.160]  families that's very exciting so it shows the attention that Walter Jones and
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:30.640]  you the listeners and others brought to this is bearing fruit so this isn't a
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:34.720]  pep rally I'm giving you a little three-minute synopsis of where we're at
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:38.640]  to let folks know that the few good men and women we've gotten in Congress take
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.280]  an action with millions of other people like you out there is having an effect
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:46.440]  so I want to get orders from our general on this congressman Jones to find out
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:50.640]  the latest where we're going and what we can do to push this over the edge
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.400]  representative Walter Jones thank you so much sir well Alex thank you and it's
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:00.840]  people like you who have access through your show with to so many people that
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:06.960]  are energizing the support that we need to get a declassification of the 28
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:12.040]  pages and let me say that Bob Graham he's the former senator from Florida he
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:17.680]  was a co-chair at the time that they wrote the 9-11 congressional inquiry
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:23.920]  into the attack on New York and the other states and quite frankly it was a
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.680]  Bush administration I want to make that clear I know we knew you know you're in
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:34.480]  Texas but the Bush administration are the ones that classified the 28 pages the
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:40.360]  inquiry released a whole report but it had to go to the administration at that
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.840]  time the Bush administration then they had to review the report before it was
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:49.840]  made public and they decided the Bush administration that the 28 pages should
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:55.680]  be classified I have read the report other members the 28 page excuse me and
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:00.400]  other members have and that's why we have almost 40 members of the House from
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:07.480]  both parties who have joined Steve Lynch from Pence excuse me from Massachusetts
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:12.640]  Democrat Thomas Massey from Kentucky Republican and myself have put in a
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:19.480]  resolution for two sessions of Congress now calling on the White House to keep
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:24.800]  his word to the 9-11 families and Obama gave his word to the families that he
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.840]  would declassify or excuse me consider declassifying the information but
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:34.160]  thanks to you and many other hosts like yourself throughout this country the
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:40.840]  word is out and your preference to me getting on was exactly right the Saudis
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:45.840]  are just as complicit as the Iranians in half the problems we have around this
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:51.760]  world with you hottest and and you exactly right in what you said I will
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:58.040]  tell you that I'm very hopeful that Senator Graham myself and Steve Lynch
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:04.640]  are going to meet with the CIA director Clapper in early May and ask him to
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:10.800]  please do what is necessary to educate the American people and keep the
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:15.800]  amendment excuse me keep the word to the 9-11 families who have been so hurt
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:21.080]  since 9-11 well speaking of Saudi Arabia I see on the news where they're
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:24.280]  involved with Hollywood the stock exchange they're trying to buy the
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:28.920]  Chicago mercantile exchange they're heavily influencing media I know they
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:33.000]  censored Michael Savage's book I have had to actually deal with pressure they
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.560]  put on us this is an out-of-control government that is meddling in our
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:41.240]  affairs I think more than any other foreign government but no one ever
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:45.600]  talks about I mean I get critical of Israel being involved internally I'm
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:48.720]  not an enemy of Israel I'm a friend of Israel I don't like Israel meddling in
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.200]  our internal affairs but but but no one ever talks about Saudi Arabia I think
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:59.160]  the number one meddler may be after China well Alex I agree with you I think
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:05.320]  you have stated and many others have stated and we have read in public
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.600]  information that talks about how Saudi Arabia look at what's happening with
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:14.320]  the jihadists in the ISA where are the Saudi troops they're not on the ground
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.400]  but everybody in the Middle East wants America to put its troops on the ground
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:23.800]  I don't make any sense they won't even take one refugee sir well that's the
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:28.960]  point I mean you know Steve King and I were the only two Republicans back in
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.680]  November when the Republican Party wanted to show the American people that
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:39.480]  we were concerned about all these in immigrants coming over from Syria and
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:46.400]  these other countries and and we knew when Steve Steve King and I did not
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:52.000]  vote for the House resolution that was put in by the Republican Party that says
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.880]  we're going to tell this administration the Obama administration you've got to
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:00.920]  do a vet better job of vetting these people these 10,000 people coming into
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:06.040]  America that we agreed to take in and I knew that was a shell game Steve
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:11.120]  King knew it was a shell game and we voted against it because what happened
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:17.440]  Alex was in December of this year 2015 when we passed the budget a 1.1
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.560]  trillion dollars the money was in there for mr. Obama to bring in the 10,000
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:28.840]  refugees amazing and the numbers I get from people inside ICE is that it's
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:33.040]  way above or even being told 30 plus governors have asked who they are what
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.040]  their names are they're just being brought in I'm told they're being given
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:41.960]  new names and social security numbers and section 8 housing I know you don't
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.160]  like to speculate but looking at Europe being flooded Merkel inviting in
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:50.200]  millions of people from war zones mostly military age men not vetting them
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:56.240]  Interpol telling them that they're full of jihadis ICE is saying we're coming to
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:01.800]  attack you what is the I know you try to be nonpartisan to get stuff done but
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.720]  but particularly with the European left and and with the left in this country and
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:08.760]  others and I just talked about French fashion designers trying to make
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:15.440]  everything Muslim now or or compliant with Sharia law I mean this is crazy I
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.440]  see it pushed even in our liberal media like this Islamic takeover this is like
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:28.680]  a twilight zone episode it Alex you're exactly right I mean when I look at how
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:33.000]  this country has just continued to collapse all around us but Marley and
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.760]  economically talking about the jihadists and ice and all this all that is
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:43.000]  happening in this country is because the people need to understand that you
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.400]  have encouraged about the 28 pages we need to take this country back because I
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:53.520]  think the luxury of time we do not have any longer I give the example in my
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:58.800]  district that we are on a 12-hour clock there is no 1 a.m. and we're right at
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:04.040]  11 o'clock there's no 1 a.m. on the clock I'm looking at and when it hits 12 is
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:10.360]  over well I'm not single in Fox News out but one of the largest owners of news
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:16.440]  core that's just not Fox News is one of the Saudi members of the royal family
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:22.400]  and they admit they're influencing Fox News and influencing movies and it's
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:25.440]  just crazy the anti-American garbage they're pushing and I'm not trying to
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:30.160]  single Saudi Arabia out but they're the ones that are running ISIS running
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:34.000]  al-Qaeda that's come out congressional reports the 28 pages has to come out
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.800]  28 pages or g how excited congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina did you
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.280]  get or did you get excited to see Donald Trump make this subject front and
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:50.960]  center well I actually spoke to one of his not one of his staff as this man
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:55.480]  does not work for him but he is a supporter of a Trump's in Washington he's a
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:20:00.160]  lobbyist quite frankly and he came to my office one day and I was telling him
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:04.160]  about the 28 pages and I said I'm gonna tell you something Rand Paul knows
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:07.400]  about it he's been speaking out about it you ought to give it to Donald Trump I
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:11.280]  said he's from New York let him talk about it and put pressure on this
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:16.400]  administration and put pressure on Congress to allow the American people to
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:21.680]  see the truth as to who was involved in 9-11 and I want to go back to another
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:26.200]  point how many times the king of Saudi Arabia who's now deceased how many
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:34.080]  times was he in Crawford Texas I think it was eight or nine times well you're
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.160]  putting it all together Alex that's why I love to be on your show I listened to
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:41.320]  you and I learned things I learned stuff from you too sir speaking of the fact
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:46.240]  of why I like Donald Trump I have some problems too I have said things to him
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:50.720]  three Rogers down to also talk to him on and off air some and he he goes and
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:54.160]  talks about he goes let me research that and then he goes and talks about it
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:57.320]  and I think that's what scares the Republican establishment so much about
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:02.720]  him is that they know that he actually does want to have nationalism does want
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:07.080]  to have fair trade deals and that he's more influenced by the people than he is
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.680]  by special interest I think that's why they're scared of him and I don't want
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:13.640]  to try to get you to wait into this sir but overall what is your view of Donald
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:20.440]  Trump well I think that now with the pre-left I'm a Donald Trump Ted Cruz I
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:24.320]  think either one of those two and I don't know how you feel about Cruz not
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:27.680]  trying to get in that conversation no I mean I like both of them compared to
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:34.120]  Casey Casey's kind of just a bush blue blooded one of the two in my opinion
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:38.120]  would do what this country needs to do and that's to get this country straight
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:44.080]  based on the Constitution well you're right sir in the six seven minutes we
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:47.640]  have left because I'm a thrown a lot of points out here 28 pages or G
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:51.640]  congratulations this is so good for our country in the world I feel like people
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:54.560]  are learning about it even if it hasn't been declassified thanks to the fact that
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.000]  you guys have basically stood up and not leaked but said hey we have a right to
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  tell you what's in this what comes next what else can we do and what are other
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.200]  shoes to drop and I know also you've been involved trying to get us out of
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:11.160]  Afghanistan get us out of Iraq and we've also gotten to pilots exonerated as
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:16.280]  well yeah well I was in a few little bit of time we have left limit let me
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:21.880]  touch on that very quickly on April the 8th of the year 2019 Marines were
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:27.520]  killed and at the airport in Marana Arizona they were flying a v-22 Osprey
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:33.760]  they had not been adequately trained the company that produced it was not still
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:39.120]  needed do testing on it and these poor 19 Marines were killed the two pilots
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:43.440]  John Braille was the pilot the co-pilot was Brooks Groob his wife lives in my
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:47.000]  district in Jacksonville North Carolina the home of Camp Lejeune Marine Base
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:53.320]  she brought this to my attention in 2002 God put it on my heart that this woman
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:58.920]  needed help because no one was there to defend her husband and we started a 14
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:03.760]  year journey that is now concluded thanks to the Deputy Secretary of Defense
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:08.520]  Robert work has sent out a six-page letter we can get that down to you and
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:13.440]  he says that these pilots should not be seen at fault a lot of people helped me
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:18.400]  Alex to get this done can't name them all but I will tell you the one that
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:23.400]  helped me the most was my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and his Father God they
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:28.320]  answered my prayers 13 years I prayed on my knees that these two pilots would be
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:33.160]  cleared because the press release by the Marine Corps in one month after the
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:36.720]  accident said that the pilots rushed to complete the mission might have been the
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:40.960]  fatal flaw could not get the Marine Corps itself to do anything to clear
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:44.840]  clear up their press release had to go to the Department of Defense and they
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:49.720]  have agreed to help the families to have a little bit of peace yes sir well I
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.760]  know they're trying to get rid of all the old helicopters they ought to just
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:56.520]  update those I don't want to bash the defense companies and things they're
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:59.280]  trying to produce better systems from when I've talked a lot of pilots and
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:02.560]  people they've been trying for 15 20 years to get the Osprey to work and be
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:06.440]  safe enough not to not to crash and kill everybody I remember them scapegoating
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:10.640]  the pilots when clearly it was a malfunction they're up there flying
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:16.720]  that's really still experimental and look it's it's like the F-35 a billion
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:20.840]  plus dollars a piece foreign pilots tell us our own pilots tell us it's not as
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:26.760]  good as an F-15 made 25 years ago I mean who is running the purchasing because
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:30.760]  we have the biggest defense budget ever we don't need in my view more money we
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:34.360]  need quality and we need to actually have what works what's your view on that
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:38.720]  Congressman Jones Alex Alex I agree with you totally I've learned so much in
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:42.600]  trying to clear the names of these two Marine pilots and you're exactly right
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:46.560]  and let me tell you one thing very quickly the waste of money in Afghanistan
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:51.360]  I hope you saw the article if you didn't we will email it to you that the
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.880]  Department of Defense spent six million dollars to buy nine goats from Italy
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:02.040]  nine goats to get them to Western Afghanistan so they can start a goat
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:06.880]  business to make cashmere sweaters and coats and everything John Sopco the
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:10.080]  Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction who's doing a magnificent
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:13.600]  job to wake up the American people to the waste of their money in Afghanistan
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:19.600]  he tests five before the Senate he said we can't find the goats well that's I
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:22.720]  mean that's how these ripoffs work these thousand dollar hammers or whatever
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:27.160]  they were a hundred dollar hammers in the 80s absolutely say that again because
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:30.200]  we're gonna put the article on screen I saw that a while back we're gonna dig
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:37.040]  that up six million dollars for goats six million dollars for nine goats there
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:40.600]  it is Huffington Post was also in the Associated Press US military spent
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:45.760]  millions bringing nine Italian goats to Afghanistan isn't that incredible it is
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:49.920]  unbelievable that's why your show is so important and you telling the truth is
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:54.400]  so important the American people need to listen and to take back this country
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:59.960]  before we hit 1 a.m. because it's over when it is 1201 absolutely in the
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:02.560]  manner to we have left back to the 28 pages I know you don't like to take
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:06.120]  credit but I'm pretty excited here because this is a game changer if this
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:09.720]  comes out it's gonna the Clintons are in trouble the bushes are in trouble well
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:13.160]  you've seen the pages describe to people what you think is going to happen if
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:19.080]  they finally come out what will happen it will make America stronger because
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:23.940]  America would know that the truth about what happened on 9-11 and what
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:30.440]  countries had an involvement in that tragic event in our country and there's
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:34.040]  a reason the whole power structure doesn't want it released they are scared
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:36.440]  to death because I've talked to you about what's in I've talked to others that
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:41.280]  have seen it and basically correct me if I'm wrong it's a stand down it's Saudi
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:46.680]  Arabia involved it's our FBI trying to stop it being told to stand down and
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:50.760]  this will basically bring a lot of people down and they've got to know that
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:56.480]  they're not going to stop it ended up coming out Alex people will be embarrassed
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:01.400]  because they did not do their jobs and they had too close of a friendship and
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:08.160]  relationships with foreigners jones.house.gov 28 pages.org we are so
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.480]  blessed to have people like you there congressman and I hope you'll come on
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:15.800]  time from time and to kind of spend 20 30 minutes with us on a review of people
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:20.120]  running for Congress and tell us who you think is good and who you think is
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.280]  honorable and who we should support because I think of you as one of the
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:27.400]  most honorable people in that whole dishonorable mess up there so God bless
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:32.080]  you congressman and thank you so much Alex I'm humble thank you so much no no
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:36.520]  thank you sir gobble that's a really great fine southern gentleman right
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.880]  there and on so many issues he tirelessly fights for veterans for
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.760]  their health care for families for our businesses for factories for jobs for
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:51.960]  sovereignty and he's so nice and so gentlemanly you really never see him on
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:55.920]  the big TV shows because he just won't get in the fights with people but he's
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.640]  getting a lot done to defend this republic and let me tell you something
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:08.280]  those 28 pages come out it is a mortal wound to the criminals not the whole CIA
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:12.520]  not the whole defense intelligence agency not the whole government and I
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.880]  say that because we help the globalist when we say it's the whole government
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:18.640]  and then we just hate the government the government's too big it's out of
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:22.760]  control it's got to be reformed absolutely but when you just sit here and
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:27.600]  go they're all did 9-11 they all are criminals they're all and child molest
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:32.680]  you know child molesters no it's the top criminal groups at the top that are
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:36.040]  blackmailing and controlling and murdering people and killing people
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:43.160]  they're the ones and they have an alliance with Saudi Arabia and Turkey and
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:48.200]  Israel's involved into it up to Israel has its own evil group I'm not attacking
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.880]  Israel I'm saying Israel has evil factions and they are up to their eyeballs as
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:56.760]  well with Saudi Arabia and they double-crossed our allies like Egypt
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:00.360]  and others who were working with us and stabilizing the area and trying to have
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:06.400]  basic freedom to put in dirty evil filthy murderous jihadists and I'm gonna

[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:08.040]  Democrat paper came to this conclusion after contacting Democrat super
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:11.080]  delegates in New York and asking if they would switch from Hillary to Bernie
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:16.920]  if he won the popular vote every single super delegate said no just like the
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:20.080]  Republican establishment with its never Trump movement the Democrat
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:25.320]  establishment is never Bernie welcome to crony socialism Democrats should ask
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:30.120]  themselves why they want a crooked rigged system to control everything
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:35.280]  and crony capitalism can't happen without crony socialism in the GOP they
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:38.920]  steal it differently they're the wait until after the election to steal it
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:43.160]  like in South Carolina where the voters gave Trump every delegate the crews came

[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:18.760]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:37.520]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central we're live we've added a
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:41.840]  fourth hour different members of our crew reporters and anchors hosted every
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:46.880]  day like Paul Watson, Jakari Jackson today it's not gonna be David Deight one of
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:50.320]  my favorites it's going to be Anthony Gutiarty but they all do an excellent
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.320]  job that's why I love the fact there's four or five different hosts sometimes
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:57.160]  they co-host they bring different angles different perspectives to things that's
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:01.440]  why you'll read articles and info wars.com and see video reports that I
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:05.920]  don't totally agree with put out by my crew because we're not running a cult
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:10.480]  here ladies and gentlemen we're having debates we're having discussions if
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:15.160]  anybody die at Sandy Hook was the whole thing real were there crisis actors
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:22.400]  there did they exacerbate it was some of it fake absolutely does the mainstream
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:30.520]  media come out and say that I say it's all fake all actors yes is that true no
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:35.280]  see that's how they operate I saw a bunch of newspapers last week come out with
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:39.400]  the same live like four years ago and I saw a bunch of news clips I was sent
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:45.480]  going Alex Jones the guy that thinks Obama sends tornadoes to Oklahoma City
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:52.160]  now believes this so just remember that's how they deceive a caller calls in
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:56.240]  three four years ago when a tornado hits Oklahoma City and says do you think
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:01.760]  Obama sent a weather weapon and I said no they do have weather weapons they do
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:05.280]  have cloud seeding major governments have it it was used as a weapon in
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:15.680]  Vietnam this probably wasn't that that turns into Obama did it that's how they
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:19.000]  operate so just just be aware of their deceptions be aware of their
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.120]  operations because they're not just doing it with me they're doing it across

[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:28.680]  show host plug every segment for a minute or two I tend to plug one time an
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:32.800]  hour for three or four minutes that what that's what we just did all right
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:38.800]  talk about taking the plunge here I want to go to Mark Karen Dave Gary Keith
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:45.640]  everybody and we will but right now let's get ready to plunge into the news
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:54.200]  into the information let's start first with this clip I played earlier but I
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:59.360]  want to play it again right now to kick this off the Trump news Trump says
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:04.360]  women should be punished for illegal abortions that's how the media spun it
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:10.360]  that's what they said no Trump said that we should end the practice of abortion
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:15.840]  and there needs to be a process to do that and that yes when women go and get
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:19.360]  it illegally they then end up getting in trouble but it really should be the
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.200]  doctors or the butchers people that don't have degrees that are doing it
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:27.760]  there needs to be a phasing of it out partial birth needs to end let's start
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:32.720]  with that the truth is Trump has become pro-life because of children in his
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:37.720]  life he's become anti-vaccine for other family reasons why do you think Robert
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:43.800]  DeNiro has questions you live you learn I'm concerned he wouldn't be hardcore
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:47.600]  enough on abortion quite frankly he says Planned Parenthood does a lot of good
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:50.880]  but the abortion's wrong well I guess I mean I'm not against birth control I
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:54.360]  think poor people that don't want to have kids should be on birth control so
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:57.720]  there's some there's some points that are too extreme on the other side and I'm
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:00.960]  not going to say crucify some woman if the baby's three weeks old and they
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:04.240]  kill it because you know I don't think the baby felt very much at that point
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:08.480]  it's still you're killing a human being we always said where's it in next little
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:12.800]  kids old people veterans yep they're killing them see that's why I'm against
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:17.520]  it but I'm not on a high horse up here judging people that have had abortions
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:21.720]  but the people that like the partial birth of seven eight nine-month-old babies
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:24.360]  they don't tell the women they're selling about baby parts they don't tell the
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:27.880]  women there's more people wanting adoptions every year than there are
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:32.800]  abortions in this country there are liberal groups that fight to keep whites
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:38.120]  and others from getting other race babies there are Hispanic and black groups
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:41.840]  that try to fight to keep whites from adopting babies they'd rather them be
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:45.240]  killed that's in the news that's how whacked out and races some of these
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:49.720]  groups are and it's despicable you know my mother couldn't have any more
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:52.760]  children after me if you wanted to have more my sisters adopted from South
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:57.600]  Korea and we didn't adopt her because I was a white savior my parents were white
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:02.400]  saviors you know when I was 15 years old whenever David Knight and his wife
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:06.320]  were out at the abortion protest and their daughter's a teenager she's from
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:11.160]  China from a hellish orphanage they got her from I'm not gonna tell you the
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:14.440]  stuff Knight told me about it I mean he may want to do a story on it someday so
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:18.640]  you know but he said I could talk about some of it let's just say hello on earth
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:23.000]  and they're saying I kill my baby we're gonna kill us he's black and white women
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.480]  out there we love the devil murder everybody kill I love I love death I love
[01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:30.680]  killing babies she goes listen don't kill your babies people want those babies
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:35.600]  she'll shut up white savior you're not getting I kill it I murder and then she
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:40.760]  says the black lady say black she's a human she's mainly white she says the
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:45.120]  demon woman there that's a good name for her the green-skinned weird translucent
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:51.160]  lizard woman she says to her well no I'm not a white savior out my my daughter's
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:56.640]  Chinese she goes exactly no she was a mother she wanted a baby she wanted a
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:00.240]  nurture it wasn't because she wanted to be a white savior which she has
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:05.360]  maternal instincts unlike you she didn't kill her kids and she wanted more kids
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:10.960]  get that through your head gosh you people are evil so there's a child you're
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:16.560]  killing there's a child you're killing let me tell you the sentence women get
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:20.280]  that have a bunch of abortions massive cervical ovarian and uterine cancer you
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:24.880]  terminate pregnancies it weren't supposed to be your body is jacked they
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:28.200]  don't want you to know that what the morning after pill does to you they
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:31.560]  don't want you to know if something's powerful enough to kill a baby in you
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:35.640]  it's basically a chemotherapy pill you better learn about the connections of
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:42.200]  these pills and leukemia you better get the facts first is what I'm saying a lot
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:45.680]  of women get these abortions and then they get into it they go it's my choice
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.600]  mine mine and Gloria Steinem and women say it's fun it's good and you know
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:56.960]  Hillary killed her baby boys she only kept Chelsea for a prop she's a true
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:03.560]  Gloria Steinem feminist these are sick freaks folks let's go ahead and go to
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:06.640]  the club from Trump we'll go to your calls what should the woman be punished
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:11.240]  for having abortion look this is not something you can dodge it's a if you
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:15.480]  say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder you have to deal with it under
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:20.920]  the law should abortion be punished well people in certain parts of the
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:24.000]  Republican Party and conservative Republicans would say yes they should
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.640]  be part of you I would say that it's a very serious problem and that's the
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:33.040]  problem that we have to decide on is it's very you're forbidding say well
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:37.040]  wait are you gonna say put them in jail I know what I'm asking you because you
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:41.240]  say you want to ban it I would I am against I am pro-life yes what is that
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:44.120]  how do you ban abortion how do you actually do it well you know you'll go
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:49.720]  back to a position like they had where people will perhaps go to illegal
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:53.280]  places yeah but you have to ban it I'm you're bad and they go to somebody who
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.080]  flunked out of medical school are you Catholic yes I think I do you feel about
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:00.840]  the Catholic Church's position I accept the teaching authority of my church
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:04.520]  or more issues you know you know their position on abortion yes I do and do
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:08.080]  you concur with that position I concur with their moral position but legally
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:11.520]  I get to the question here's my problem no but let me ask you but what do you say
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:14.760]  about it's not funny your church yeah it's really not funny like what do you
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:18.680]  say about your church they're very very small that's enough Matthews knew the
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:21.520]  camera had gone to the back shot of him so he tried to act like Trump was
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:26.120]  laughing Trump didn't laugh and by the way I love how you follow your church
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:32.160]  you're a member but then you say later but he doesn't personally follow it so
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:37.960]  it's all this legalese let's get this through Chris Matthews brain this is
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:41.240]  about eugenics it's about dehumanization it's about turning humans into
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:45.440]  garbage and now they're a commodity we heat hospitals by burning the baby's
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.120]  bodies we sell their organs and we don't tell the women it's going on and now
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:53.600]  our media won't criticize communist China and they won't criticize Cuba
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:57.640]  arresting political dissidents next they'll be doing that to us and they
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:05.200]  already are understand that we need solidarity for humankind but nobody's
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:08.040]  telling these women that there are all these Christian organizations and others
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:13.400]  that will pay you to have the baby give you 10 20 40 50 thousand dollars after
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:18.720]  it's born and get you a job and you get to see the baby three or four times a
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:24.220]  year if you want to even if they move they pay to take you there to meet your
[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:29.160]  baby you get to stay with your baby have a relationship with your baby get
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:35.560]  money get taken care of and get a job because there's a there is a big demand
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:42.080]  for babies and I'd go down to Planned Parenthood and demonstrate 20 years ago
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:48.400]  18 years ago and the and the black white Hispanic people walk up to me with the
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:52.960]  same chance we got it on video now nobody wants these ugly black and little
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:56.680]  Hispanic nappy hair babies you nobody wants to adopt him you come get these
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:59.800]  black babies if you want them and we were like what there are people wanting to
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:05.080]  adopt black babies I have the numbers they go and now we have the footage of
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:09.080]  the abortion people going nobody wants the ugly black baby get out of here
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:14.200]  whites Asians all the same thing black it's the same deal no one wants the ugly
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:17.840]  baby but they're the liberals running the Planned Parenthood they're the liberals
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:22.000]  who hate black people and you go into these black neighborhoods they'll be the
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:27.200]  rich blacks that rule over them kind of the Illuminati the Prince Hall people
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:29.960]  say the Masons are conspiracy I'll tell you where the conspiracy is in black
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:34.280]  Masons that's who's running the black people that's the uncle Tom's that's the
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:37.400]  people not all of them but that that tends to be the pattern that are
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:41.360]  literally feeding on the black people and then working with the corrupt local
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:44.080]  government and that's why they ship the drugs in there and they have the
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:47.400]  prostitutes in there and that's the zone where you're allowed to have criminal
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:51.640]  activity is in the black neighborhood where then of a black mother single
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:54.760]  mother doesn't want her kids to be destroyed she has to lock them up in the
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:59.560]  house for their life or they'll end up being forced into the system you want
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:05.800]  the real racist conspiracy there it is now I'm off on a whole jag I said I'd go
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:09.080]  to your calls we're gonna go to break and come back go to Mark we go to David
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:12.040]  we're gonna go to Gary we're gonna go to Keith Karen and many others and then I'm
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:15.840]  going to start getting into more of the Trump news here's some of it coming up
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:19.720]  Hannity and Judge DePaulitano on Lew Adowski video nothing happens zero
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:23.720]  evidence of interintentional harm yeah we're about to have war with communist
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:26.840]  China perhaps that's in the news next but we got to hear about Lew
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:30.400]  Adowski grabbing someone by the arm didn't even look like that and that ties
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:34.920]  in this other hysteria I saw this when I watched the press conference the other
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:40.040]  day my reporters were were nearby I thought nothing of it then it was in
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:43.480]  the news last night this morning I had started coming up Donald Trump knocks

[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:36.000]  you hear how he killed a person with a phone and then and then Ted Cruz will

[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:44.280]  ISIS says they got nukes and people say oh they can't get them somebody might
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:48.720]  give them one folks China the US be careful in South China Sea threatens
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:54.000]  military attack that's the kind of stuff coming up the next hour mark go ahead hi
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.440]  Alex I wanted to thank you and your organization for being there and for
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:00.840]  promoting and giving us the information that we need to figure out what's going
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:08.080]  on this morning there was a bulletin that Britain is going to be shipping
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:15.680]  tons of nuclear waste here to the United States also this morning Obama is
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:22.160]  going to be having some type of a summit on nuclear terrorism another bulletin
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:26.400]  came out that the Belgium is finally accepting help from the US concerning
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:30.600]  terrorism probably because of the information about that possible attack
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:36.240]  on their nuclear reactor and I'm just kind of concerned that given what
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:42.080]  happened regarding San Bernardino the day before President Obama said we really
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:45.960]  don't have anything to worry about from ISIS and then the next day the San
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:49.720]  Bernardino San Bernardino attacks happened and then he said something
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:54.120]  like that again and then the situation in Brussels Belgium happened no no I
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:57.320]  agree with you and let me stop right there when I'm calm at home eating
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:01.880]  breakfast or dinner with the kids and you know not on air my brain slows down
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:05.520]  but it almost speeds up you know what I mean and it gets real clear all the nuke
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:10.480]  terror chatter all the hype Obama saying what I what really keeps me up at
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:14.680]  night two years ago let's find the clip if we can what keeps me up at night is a
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:19.680]  mushroom cloud over Manhattan it won't be ISIS that does it his people could do it
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:23.920]  or others bring in martial law they've got the preparations ready and I'm
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:30.040]  telling you they're so bold they could do anything and in my gut it's funny you
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:34.040]  say that I keep meaning to come in and do a whole show about nuclear false flag
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:38.680]  but then I self-censor I go no Alex they're gonna think you're fear mongering
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:43.320]  well you know what I don't care I really in my gut see all the chatter see the
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:48.000]  history see the preparations see the boldness and I think it's a real threat
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:52.960]  and I think you're right go ahead yeah that's that's pretty much so what I
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:56.760]  had to say right now that's all I thought I had to say well you're freaking me
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:59.760]  out because that's exactly what keeps me up at night in fact I don't want to get
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:02.960]  into it I can't handle this anymore I'm gonna be honest with people folks I
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:07.040]  shouldn't be in this position I'm just some regular guy from Texas who can see
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:10.760]  what's going on and we'll talk about it I got congressman on trying to release

[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:24.080]  outer limits I'm telling you that's why the public didn't aware what's going on
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:28.760]  they think their lives boring folks it isn't boring here's just one example
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:31.400]  there's thousands of things like this hundreds and hundreds to be conservative
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:36.200]  they say the biggest quake in US history may hit anytime it's overdue all the
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:40.800]  seismographs show it it could destroy San Francisco or LA no one's hardly even
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:45.600]  concerned what's that gonna do to the economy the Chinese are threatened in

[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:43.480]  freaked me out because driving home at work at night waking up middle of the
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:48.960]  night this morning I was on the elliptical and I saw this news about a
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:53.480]  nuclear armed ISIS and you know saying that they've got nuclear material not
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:58.280]  just a dirty bomb and I know about how our government under Clinton gave
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:01:04.400]  reactors that can make hydrogen anatomic bombs to Kim Jong-il the father of
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:07.720]  Kim Jong-un and then all these hundreds of points come in it's why I get
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:12.440]  exhausted about like five or six now because I have so much data I mean I
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:16.800]  when I think about something I can like pull up in my mind this whole 3d map but
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:23.960]  that gets exhausting so I'll just do it for all this petty stuff like no we have

[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:01.600]  exciting time to be alive right now and Trump if he gets elected better deliver

[02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:13.720]  IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:17.840]  and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they
[02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:22.320]  took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima

[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:26.060]  you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance it's alex
[02:08:26.060 --> 02:08:34.780]  jones I was almost late getting in here because I was busy on showing getting my
[02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:37.620]  good buddy Weldon Henson it was a wonderful country music band it's very
[02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:42.420]  popular named a band of the year or whatever just a few weeks ago here in
[02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:48.500]  Austin then they go play next week for my grandma at her nursing home she finally
[02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:52.220]  had to be put in nursing home about a year ago but she's still all there great
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:57.780]  lady a Christian she said I'm not gonna get into it point as she is she's not
[02:08:57.780 --> 02:09:04.340]  person that is tough and reason I digress often to all of that is I've been
[02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:08.380]  trying for three months to get them over the phone to let Weldon come play for
[02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:11.700]  old folks so I'm as they have folks that come and play there but they're not
[02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:15.140]  usually as successful as he is and I finally said this morning I said you go
[02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:19.460]  march in there personally and do it and get it done that way and then now it's
[02:09:19.460 --> 02:09:25.580]  all set up quicker than I even wanted but we're gonna have barbecue over there
[02:09:25.580 --> 02:09:31.060]  and stuff like that but that just shows how digital stuff is somewhat effective
[02:09:31.060 --> 02:09:36.780]  to wake people up or to inform them but when it comes to physically going and
[02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:40.100]  getting in people's faces that's what gets things done that's why we've all
[02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:44.260]  got to be in Ohio and Cleveland when they try to steal the nomination for
[02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:49.940]  Trump even if you hate Donald Trump you shouldn't let them steal the
[02:09:49.940 --> 02:09:54.980]  nomination from him if he's got 500 more delegates than Ted Cruz which he's
[02:09:54.980 --> 02:10:01.180]  set to have what what's the magic number 1236 he's gonna be just a few shy
[02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:08.180]  of that and now Ted Cruz and Casey are on TV saying we want to be positioned to
[02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:15.460]  not give him the nomination and the 1236 no one has ever had a contested
[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:21.420]  election where the delegates weren't almost the same and then there was some
[02:10:21.420 --> 02:10:26.020]  battle because it was so close that's all that's for this is incredible steal
[02:10:26.020 --> 02:10:32.100]  out in the open Bill Clinton says he would give Bernie Sanders his super
[02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:40.020]  delegate vote if the Vermont senator wins the nomination that's like Bill
[02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:44.300]  Clinton saying he would vote against Hillary man this is getting weirder and
[02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:49.020]  weirder he comes out in badmouth Obama now he's badmouthing Hillary Hillary
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:57.580]  stealing his super delegates from Bernie what is going on and I'm not being
[02:10:57.580 --> 02:11:03.180]  mean when I say that Bill Clinton could march on to a Hollywood set as a zombie
[02:11:03.180 --> 02:11:10.660]  today with no makeup and be the star of his high-budget zombie film he looks
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:18.460]  like a reanimated corpsicle what do you think's really going on there now I'm
[02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:24.420]  gonna go to your calls Gary and James and Karen and Keith everybody else here
[02:11:24.420 --> 02:11:28.340]  in just a moment get back in all the Trump news but but we already knew this
[02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:31.740]  was going on but this is what I want Rob do and crew I forgot to tell them this
[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:36.700]  to talk to the folks on the ground about how much were you paid and who bus
[02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:41.660]  in here because it's move on org mainly that's George Soros but the
[02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:46.700]  followers are so dumb they will load up bus loads of Bernie Sanders supporters
[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:56.020]  to go take orders from Hillary's move on org to then blame him when his
[02:11:56.020 --> 02:11:59.900]  supporters do bad things I mean that's that's what it's like when you've got
[02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:04.980]  followers that are this stupid I mean these are really dumb people it's a
[02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:10.100]  Paul Joseph Watson article it's up on info wars dot com I don't say they're
[02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:14.380]  dumb again for my ego it it doesn't make me feel good to be part of the same
[02:12:14.380 --> 02:12:19.940]  species I don't think of myself as rocket science smart but I'm like a god
[02:12:19.940 --> 02:12:24.900]  compared to these people they know nothing I don't care what color they are
[02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:29.380]  where they're from you talk to an institutionalized yuppie liberal TV head
[02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:34.380]  video game smartphone head and all they know is weird political correct
[02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:38.820]  statements that they state and then smile like they're supposed to get a
[02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:44.820]  gold star in a lollipop like a train seal you can take a seal that's had
[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:56.940]  electroshock convulsive therapy or lobotomy and it can do tricks for kids so
[02:12:56.940 --> 02:13:02.700]  when I marvel at them it's like look at the product of this higher education and
[02:13:02.700 --> 02:13:09.100]  standard education primary education system it creates devil worshipers
[02:13:09.100 --> 02:13:16.020]  communists weirdos twits morons people that can hardly walk or talk that run
[02:13:16.020 --> 02:13:20.940]  around screaming trying to take free speech that's what this machine produces
[02:13:20.940 --> 02:13:24.900]  that's where this it's like North Korea announced prepare for millions to starve
[02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:28.420]  to death again as millions have that's your announcement we're gonna let you
[02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:36.260]  starve get ready and then all these college kids want to be communists
[02:13:36.260 --> 02:13:42.140]  craigslist ad with their little smartphones get paid $15 an hour to
[02:13:42.140 --> 02:13:49.180]  protest at the Trump rally post promotes pre-protest instructions and a
[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:53.820]  shuttle bus to the event a pro Bernie Sanders craigslist ad and vice people
[02:13:53.820 --> 02:13:58.260]  in Wisconsin a protesting song from for $15 an hour but if the image of Bernie

[02:14:02.860 --> 02:14:07.100]  positions for protesters at the Trump rally we tried to get there in time to
[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:10.620]  go to this but was already over by then I will bet you just come out and move on

[02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:12.820]  shuttle buses parking signs an hourly bill available $15 an hour due to

[02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:46.420]  position oh my goodness we we have a lot to cover here don't we there's here's a
[02:15:46.420 --> 02:15:52.540]  big Esquire article about where is Trump's political campaign really going
[02:15:52.540 --> 02:15:56.900]  what's really going on inside Trump's political operation that it basically
[02:15:56.900 --> 02:16:04.620]  hint hint talks about stone run in the show well as Emperor Palpatine says
[02:16:04.620 --> 02:16:08.940]  help me I'm weak stones not running anything all right let's go ahead now
[02:16:08.940 --> 02:16:14.860]  he's not involved in anything either and and and Obamacare is free and okay
[02:16:14.860 --> 02:16:17.860]  let's go ahead and go back to your calls I apologize I'm out of control
[02:16:17.860 --> 02:16:23.900]  Charles in north to don't know Charles is in North Dakota and we guys list the
[02:16:23.900 --> 02:16:27.340]  station is listening to I see the call letters but I can't see it all actually
[02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:31.540]  one of those who's been holding the longest Gary in Oklahoma I apologize Gary
[02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:36.820]  go ahead yes sir what I want to talk about is the kind of what's going on
[02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:43.180]  there in Europe you know is long just really think compatible with Western
[02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:47.500]  ideology you know they're intolerant and violent and there's a lot of low back
[02:16:47.500 --> 02:16:54.700]  from it well I was wondering is it any kind of a natural reaction for the kind
[02:16:54.700 --> 02:16:58.660]  of white supremacist groups to form like they have you know kind of like they
[02:16:58.660 --> 02:17:03.860]  blame radical Islam on Western governments interfering with the Islamic
[02:17:03.860 --> 02:17:13.100]  state state that again because I heard part of that okay you know I'm
[02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:19.540]  liberal media blames America in the Western countries for radical Islam yes
[02:17:19.540 --> 02:17:24.420]  I got that part absolutely absolutely yes so why aren't they attacking Islam
[02:17:24.420 --> 02:17:30.660]  for creating this Nazi groups that are rising up over there you know because
[02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:35.180]  it said it said that one in four sure look it's all illogical so trying to
[02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:39.420]  reason with them it's all just propaganda to a dumbed-down audience
[02:17:39.420 --> 02:17:43.540]  radical Islam has not been created by the West attacking over there that's
[02:17:43.540 --> 02:17:49.260]  that's part of it it's been part of the long-term expansionist imperialistic
[02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:54.900]  goonish nature of what Islam has turned into under the last few hundred years of
[02:17:54.900 --> 02:18:00.140]  its attempts to expand which it happened when first begun as well so it's
[02:18:00.140 --> 02:18:04.220]  it's repeated history yes going over and bombing the wrong countries and putting
[02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:10.340]  radicals in charge has made it worse the West is exacerbating it opening the
[02:18:10.340 --> 02:18:16.280]  door up to radical Islam to bring them in you're absolutely right and yeah now
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:20.540]  it will give rise to a right-wing movement in Europe which I would even
[02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:25.780]  call right-wing the Nazis were socialist but whatever a very aggressive
[02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:30.780]  nationalistic groups that the media will give attention to that will only then
[02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:35.100]  discredit legitimate nationalist groups great point Gary good to hear from you
[02:18:35.100 --> 02:18:41.340]  Charles in North Dakota you're on the air go ahead yeah what's going on

[02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:28.020]  earth there's more than 50,000 nuclear weapons on the earth right now and I
[02:24:28.020 --> 02:24:34.060]  destroy it 10 15 times over that is the surface of the earth and I want to
[02:24:34.060 --> 02:24:41.620]  pledge something to you out there I'm gonna work as hard as I can I'm gonna
[02:24:41.620 --> 02:24:47.820]  do everything I can because I'm not a suicidal lunatic so I'm not a hero to
[02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:51.380]  try to expose nuclear terrorism and the fact the globalists are clearly trying
[02:24:51.380 --> 02:24:56.620]  to get us ready for it so they can absolutely re-engineer our
[02:24:56.620 --> 02:25:02.620]  society into a total police state and we all need to work together to expose the
[02:25:02.620 --> 02:25:05.820]  fact that they're funding radical Islam they're funding North Korea they're
[02:25:05.820 --> 02:25:09.420]  funding all these enemies they gave the Chinese Communist all these weapons
[02:25:09.420 --> 02:25:14.820]  especially in the 90s under Clinton so they can now menace us and threaten to
[02:25:14.820 --> 02:25:21.220]  attack our mainland Chinese submarine of course famously launched a missile
[02:25:21.220 --> 02:25:26.740]  years ago off the West Coast AFP reports China to US be careful in South China Sea
[02:25:26.740 --> 02:25:34.060]  we may militarily go after you no plans for killer US military robots yet AFP
[02:25:34.060 --> 02:25:39.580]  China said to deploy largest range nuclear missile ever financial times of
[02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:46.420]  London North Korea threatened to nuke South Korea this is what's going on in
[02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:51.620]  the real world then we've got Ted Cruz running around trying to convince
[02:25:51.620 --> 02:25:55.380]  everybody that he's this great Patriot because he moved to Canada from Cuba and
[02:25:55.380 --> 02:26:00.700]  then he moved down to Texas six seven years ago and got a cowboy hat and since
[02:26:00.700 --> 02:26:05.460]  then he has voted pro-gun and a few other things he did vote for TPP and
[02:26:05.460 --> 02:26:08.540]  stuff like that his wife helps write it and he says George Herbert Walker Bush
[02:26:08.540 --> 02:26:13.540]  is his ideological grandfather and he got money from Goldman Sachs and now
[02:26:13.540 --> 02:26:17.900]  he's been endorsed by George Herbert Walker Bush's family and Jeb Bush and
[02:26:17.900 --> 02:26:21.540]  the Neil and Marvin are running his campaign got their hands in the cookie
[02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:28.020]  jar he's very proud of that so I'd tell Charles I'd say man I tell you good to
[02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:32.660]  talk to you I got a question about Jeb Bush you know he and his daddy and the
[02:26:32.660 --> 02:26:38.580]  rest of them were for NAFTA and GATT and open borders but you admit you worked
[02:26:38.580 --> 02:26:44.140]  for him but now you're glad you got endorsed by him no wait a minute no
[02:26:44.140 --> 02:26:51.940]  slick Pinocchio lion Ted whatever your name is answer my question and then if
[02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:55.780]  he doesn't answer it go that's a coward right there who doesn't want to talk
[02:26:55.780 --> 02:27:01.420]  about his pedigree but let me tell you the bushes knew they'd already been in
[02:27:01.420 --> 02:27:05.820]  three times they already knew that name was bad so they laid down on their back
[02:27:05.820 --> 02:27:13.300]  about a decade ago and you know what came crawling out of the abyss of hell
[02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:22.620]  Ted Cruz is the creation the the leavings the the Frankenstein monster of
[02:27:22.620 --> 02:27:28.860]  the bushes they got a bunch of people on their stable look I don't care if
[02:27:28.860 --> 02:27:31.660]  somebody's Hispanic if they become president I could care less like I'd
[02:27:31.660 --> 02:27:35.580]  love it if they were a patriot but you got Marco Rubio and you got Ted Cruz
[02:27:35.580 --> 02:27:41.900]  with the CIA and the chosen kosher safe Hispanic to run for president and and
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:45.300]  Jeb admitting he married a Hispanic lady he's an attractive lady but you know
[02:27:45.300 --> 02:27:49.660]  that's all part of the political dynasty and they got George P. Bush in Texas
[02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:53.260]  who's Hispanic to bring back their dynasty and hope they can bring in
[02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:56.580]  enough Hispanics will then vote for him to get them back into power and that's
[02:27:56.580 --> 02:28:01.700]  all lying Ted is is one more of these Frankenstein monsters they got wound up
[02:28:01.700 --> 02:28:05.300]  back there in the laboratory they want to roll out against the American people
[02:28:05.300 --> 02:28:08.740]  and Cruz had a good voting record I ignored some of his problems but what
[02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:14.620]  I've seen him do now is very troublesome so I've gone from 80% liking Cruz to
[02:28:14.620 --> 02:28:18.740]  10% liking now if he got in his president did good stuff I'd turn around and
[02:28:18.740 --> 02:28:23.100]  supporting but the proof's in the putting Ted when you're not busy saying
[02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:26.900]  you want to kill Donald Trump you're busy supporting the TPP hell your wife
[02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:31.100]  helped write it Charles is that someone a pretty good question for you well
[02:28:31.100 --> 02:28:34.500]  that's exactly what my question was gonna be was how can you tell me you're

[02:28:58.740 --> 02:29:02.820]  percent there's videos all over the web about this guy and on top of that I mean
[02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:07.980]  he sent me eight emails in less than 24 hours begging me for my well they

[02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:15.340]  Obama had that allows you to steal basically elections they know when

[02:30:04.460 --> 02:30:09.980]  should be a reminder of how absurd it is to trust our liberty to nine political
[02:30:09.980 --> 02:30:14.380]  appointees who believe the Constitution can be amended by their opinions
[02:30:14.380 --> 02:30:18.860]  NBC News reports that a quarter of Republican senators now want to meet
[02:30:18.860 --> 02:30:22.900]  with Obama's Supreme Court nominee much has been said about Obama's nominee
[02:30:22.900 --> 02:30:26.620]  Merrick Garland's record opposing the Second Amendment what has it been talked
[02:30:26.620 --> 02:30:30.740]  about is his long record of rubber stamping any rule from any federal
[02:30:30.740 --> 02:30:35.500]  regulatory agency Garland will be a reliable ally of the real government
[02:30:35.500 --> 02:30:40.260]  federal bureaucracies with Scalia's death the Supreme Court is expected to be
[02:30:40.260 --> 02:30:44.900]  deadlocked on Obama's EPA regulations to shut down the coal industry the lower
[02:30:44.900 --> 02:30:49.740]  court on which Garland now serves will have the final say he will take
[02:30:49.740 --> 02:30:53.620]  Scalia's place on this important issue regardless of whether he takes Scalia's
[02:30:53.620 --> 02:30:57.620]  place on the court. For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:30:57.620 --> 02:31:00.620]  Yeah, first of all, I want to say,
[02:31:00.620 --> 02:31:05.620]  Secret 12, that's two super male brain force, prostigar, silver bullet, I use them all.

[02:31:08.620 --> 02:31:09.620]  Thank you brother.
[02:31:09.620 --> 02:31:11.620]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[02:31:11.620 --> 02:31:16.620]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[02:31:16.620 --> 02:31:18.620]  Welcome to the InfoWars.
[02:31:18.620 --> 02:31:20.620]  It's so easy to get these incredible
[02:31:20.620 --> 02:31:24.620]  nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWars at the same time.
[02:31:24.620 --> 02:31:25.620]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[02:31:25.620 --> 02:31:28.620]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Mason, all that.
[02:31:28.620 --> 02:31:31.620]  Right, God, let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[02:31:31.620 --> 02:31:33.620]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[02:31:33.620 --> 02:31:35.620]  What products are you taking?
[02:31:35.620 --> 02:31:42.620]  Everything from super male to brain force to winter sun, X2, even got a little
[02:31:42.620 --> 02:31:46.620]  a DNA force so when I just re-upped everything and I just went to auto-fill.
[02:31:46.620 --> 02:31:51.620]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[02:31:51.620 --> 02:32:17.620]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:22.620 --> 02:32:26.620]  We've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2,
[02:32:26.620 --> 02:32:32.620]  Super Male Vitality and so many others, but I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[02:32:32.620 --> 02:32:38.620]  with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[02:32:38.620 --> 02:32:42.620]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:32:42.620 --> 02:32:49.620]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:52.620]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure.
[02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:55.620]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[02:32:55.620 --> 02:33:24.620]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:33:24.620 --> 02:33:32.620]  Well, my aspiration is to, I don't know, be in a teen tit film like that guy who played Horatio.
[02:33:32.620 --> 02:33:35.620]  You know, he was in the Malibu Bikini Beach Shop.
[02:33:35.620 --> 02:33:42.620]  Well, other than that, take over the world, world domination, you know, rule everything,
[02:33:42.620 --> 02:33:46.620]  rich, powerful, that sort of stuff.
[02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:51.620]  And who does Ted Cruz now work for or who runs his campaign?
[02:33:51.620 --> 02:34:01.620]  We now see coming into view a new world order where no small nations will stand in the way of our world government.
[02:34:01.620 --> 02:34:05.620]  Oh yeah, let's play Ted Cruz's dad talking about him becoming president.
[02:34:05.620 --> 02:34:09.620]  Let's back that up. I forgot that part. I apologize.
[02:34:09.620 --> 02:34:15.620]  I try to give folks a benefit of the doubt because you can work for Goldman Sachs and CFR and the Bushes and everything
[02:34:15.620 --> 02:34:17.620]  and then go against them.
[02:34:17.620 --> 02:34:21.620]  But when you say you now endorse them and they're going to run your campaign,
[02:34:21.620 --> 02:34:25.620]  they're more new world order than Obama.
[02:34:25.620 --> 02:34:29.620]  Obama may be actually double crossing and setting up some caliphate.
[02:34:29.620 --> 02:34:31.620]  I don't know what's worse.
[02:34:31.620 --> 02:34:33.620]  Let's go back to Ted Cruz's dad. Here it is.
[02:34:33.620 --> 02:34:35.620]  Cruz, do you think Ted's going to rule the world one day?
[02:34:35.620 --> 02:34:39.620]  I hope not.
[02:34:39.620 --> 02:34:42.620]  All right, let's get serious here and go to Shelley in New Hampshire.
[02:34:42.620 --> 02:34:48.620]  We're going to go to Karen, James, Anthony.
[02:34:48.620 --> 02:34:50.620]  Oh, Keith's been holding a long time too.
[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:53.620]  Shelley in New Hampshire, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[02:34:53.620 --> 02:34:57.620]  Hi, thank you for taking my call. First time caller.
[02:34:57.620 --> 02:34:59.620]  I've been listening for about a couple of years.
[02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:00.620]  Well, thank you.
[02:35:00.620 --> 02:35:11.620]  I had a question about the 9-11 conspiracy in the 28 pages and wondering if the 28 pages will reveal if there was actually a physical plane
[02:35:11.620 --> 02:35:13.620]  that crashed into Pennsylvania.
[02:35:13.620 --> 02:35:21.620]  And if there were actually people who are making those cell phone calls that cannot be done,
[02:35:21.620 --> 02:35:26.620]  who was making those let's roll calls and where is the physical plane?
[02:35:26.620 --> 02:35:29.620]  I'm wondering if that will be revealed in the 28 pages.
[02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:33.620]  Sure. This is a very, very, very complex question.
[02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:38.620]  Do you want to hold for the answer to come back and respond or do you want to get let go now?
[02:35:38.620 --> 02:35:39.620]  I can hold.
[02:35:39.620 --> 02:35:41.620]  Okay, put her on hold. This will take a couple of minutes.
[02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:45.620]  Let me try to really crystallize this.
[02:35:45.620 --> 02:35:51.620]  To understand 9-11, I have to explain it to you from my perspective.
[02:35:51.620 --> 02:35:59.620]  I learned that the establishment wanted us to debate all the anomalies and all the problems so they could confuse the public
[02:35:59.620 --> 02:36:04.620]  and then say which conspiracy is it because it's such a big mess.
[02:36:04.620 --> 02:36:10.620]  A whole bunch of FBI agents, it's on record, I made films about it, you can go back and pull the articles up if you're a new listener,
[02:36:10.620 --> 02:36:12.620]  but most people remember this.
[02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:21.620]  FBI agents from Texas to Arizona to Minnesota to Illinois to Florida to California, New York, you name it,
[02:36:21.620 --> 02:36:26.620]  said they were ordered to not follow the hijackers and ordered to not stop them.
[02:36:26.620 --> 02:36:34.620]  The head of the visa section told Springman who had been the previous head that they were ordered to stand down and let them get fake passports
[02:36:34.620 --> 02:36:39.620]  or use their fake passports to get back into the U.S. and were told they were actually working for the CIA.
[02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:45.620]  That's Mohammed Atta and the other 15 of the 19 hijackers out of Saudi Arabia.
[02:36:45.620 --> 02:36:49.620]  The other four came from other countries, Yemen and a few others.
[02:36:49.620 --> 02:36:53.620]  So that alone, there's a cover up, the door is open, they're bringing them in.
[02:36:53.620 --> 02:36:59.620]  You get into bombs in Tower 1 and 2, in 7, absolutely, we don't know who did it.
[02:36:59.620 --> 02:37:04.620]  You get NORAD stand down, you get the Happy Hooligans.
[02:37:04.620 --> 02:37:12.620]  I mean, I talked to a retired Army colonel who was dead one week after he came on my show.
[02:37:12.620 --> 02:37:18.620]  Colonel Don deGréme-Prix.
[02:37:18.620 --> 02:37:23.620]  And he said, who did it? The two AIM-9s were shot into Flight 93.
[02:37:23.620 --> 02:37:27.620]  That stuff came out like a decade later.
[02:37:27.620 --> 02:37:32.620]  I called him up a week later, getting back on, they said the colonel died of a heart attack last night.
[02:37:32.620 --> 02:37:38.620]  Famous arms runner for the CIA, you name it. Huge, huge spook, guys, huge.
[02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:41.620]  He was not going to be part of it.
[02:37:41.620 --> 02:37:47.620]  He came on and said, I met day after it happened with all these top retired generals and they called their sources
[02:37:47.620 --> 02:37:52.620]  It was a Happy Hooligans, they had a secret reward ceremony giving them medals just a few days after
[02:37:52.620 --> 02:37:54.620]  and they wouldn't refuse the order to shot it down.
[02:37:54.620 --> 02:38:01.620]  You could go on and on and on and on with 9-11.
[02:38:01.620 --> 02:38:08.620]  The whole thing is a black hole of lies.
[02:38:08.620 --> 02:38:14.620]  I mean, I made six, seven films on it, wrote books on the subject, it's ridiculous.
[02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:21.620]  But we know there was a stand down. The former head of transportation, Panetta, said he saw the order happen in the bunker.
[02:38:21.620 --> 02:38:26.620]  Cheney then ran to Side R. Bush was running around scared at bunkers.
[02:38:26.620 --> 02:38:34.620]  From witnesses, I know that we're there with him. He seemed scared legitimately. That's why I say it was just a puppet.
[02:38:34.620 --> 02:38:38.620]  Saudi Arabia had control of the 15. The FBI was ordered not to stop them.
[02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:40.620]  Whatever, once they got on the planes, we don't know.
[02:38:40.620 --> 02:38:43.620]  There were planes landing at NASA bases and planes taken off.
[02:38:43.620 --> 02:38:49.620]  Warren Buffett for months said, I'm going to have a very special meeting at this Air Force Base in Nebraska.
[02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:57.620]  He had over a several hundred top CEOs and leaders, thousands of people total, in a hangar with a big giant movie screen
[02:38:57.620 --> 02:39:02.620]  with messages from the White House. That came out in the news after, but they wouldn't say what it was.
[02:39:02.620 --> 02:39:06.620]  They were in the hangar before it happened.
[02:39:06.620 --> 02:39:11.620]  And the word is they told him, this is national security. We wanted to protect you and make sure you weren't in New York.
[02:39:11.620 --> 02:39:19.620]  Then they questioned him and it was in mainstream news that the Pentagon canceled all these trips the day before to New York.
[02:39:19.620 --> 02:39:24.620]  So they had a big secret government meeting on COG happening in New York, except for 9-11.
[02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:29.620]  Then the conspirators went to people and said, the terrorists have learned of it. They may strike us tomorrow.
[02:39:29.620 --> 02:39:36.620]  They then got them all out in Nebraska to be part of the conspiracy to feel safe when they're actually meeting with the people that did it.
[02:39:36.620 --> 02:39:41.620]  Now, that's the best I can break it down with tens of thousands of data points. Nobody studied it like I have folks.
[02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:48.620]  I'm not bragging. It's just I'd day one. I told you two months before it was coming, they were going to blow up the World Trade Center blaming on bin Laden.
[02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:54.620]  I got all this news and loaded calls. It's just hard to get into.
[02:39:54.620 --> 02:39:59.620]  So you notice the last six, seven years since I got more sophisticated, I don't really get into all of my news show.
[02:39:59.620 --> 02:40:05.620]  I mean, I cover it. I get into building seven. I talk about a lot of the subjects, but we're meant to get lost and all that.
[02:40:05.620 --> 02:40:12.620]  Here's the deal. There was a congressional report in the first year after the event that found that Saudi Arabia ran the attacks.
[02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:18.620]  There was a NORAD order to stand down from the White House and the Clintons and the Bushes were involved in it.
[02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:27.620]  And there was ongoing cover-up since then. That's enough to lock all these people up, open the investigation up, and then we learn everything.
[02:40:27.620 --> 02:40:34.620]  I have a pretty good idea of exactly what they did, but I'm not going to sit there and speculate on it, okay?
[02:40:34.620 --> 02:40:39.620]  Now, separately, the media confuses that and goes, do you believe Jones?
[02:40:39.620 --> 02:40:43.620]  He says the New York Fire Department blew the towers up and he says that there is no radical Islam.
[02:40:43.620 --> 02:40:48.620]  The Fire Department were patriots, heroes. They're the ones that exposed it was an inside job from the ground.
[02:40:48.620 --> 02:40:56.620]  The police weren't involved. They were heroes. They exposed it. I've interviewed firefighters, police chiefs, deputy emergency manager's heads.
[02:40:56.620 --> 02:41:00.620]  I had Barry Jennings on and one week after he was on, he was dead in the hammer.
[02:41:00.620 --> 02:41:07.620]  DC matter, madam, month after, dead in the hammer. You want me to really sit there and talk about dead in the hammer with you all day long?
[02:41:07.620 --> 02:41:12.620]  This is a spy movie you're watching in real time. They're just afraid to kill me to make me a martyr.
[02:41:12.620 --> 02:41:21.620]  And it ruins their fun because they've done an analysis and an assessment on me and they know exactly where I'm coming from.
[02:41:21.620 --> 02:41:26.620]  Let's just say I ruin all the fun. Not just in the night. I don't care what they do to me because I'm committed to the truth.
[02:41:26.620 --> 02:41:35.620]  They know I ruin all the fun from so many angles because I didn't come into this as some government operative or some super spy or some Superman.
[02:41:35.620 --> 02:41:46.620]  But over the years, not connections, not things I'm doing, not people I'm talking to, it's an unwritten conspiracy against evil.
[02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:54.620]  It's a sink. It's a click. It's an understanding with all these other people in government, in corporations, in other governments
[02:41:54.620 --> 02:41:57.620]  that don't like what happened and know what's happening as well.
[02:41:57.620 --> 02:42:12.620]  So I become a focal point of the knowledge and the understanding and a figurehead, a tarot card, an archetype, a logo, a symbol, a maxim, a standard, a fulcrum, a shield, a sword, a weapon.
[02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:18.620]  And what do you do to a weapon like this when you crush it?
[02:42:18.620 --> 02:42:22.620]  I'll use a cheesy comic book analogy. What happens when you attack Doomsday?
[02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:27.620]  What happens when you do that? You just make me 100 times stronger each time.
[02:42:27.620 --> 02:42:33.620]  The enemy knows that. They understand the metaphysical rules.
[02:42:33.620 --> 02:42:41.620]  You don't think I'm naive. They have the Austin Police Department and the FBI watching out for my safety because they love me so much.
[02:42:41.620 --> 02:42:44.620]  They don't want me dead because of the chain reactions it could create.
[02:42:44.620 --> 02:42:51.620]  And I don't want to get off into all this, but to talk about 9-11 is to talk about myself because I've been in this since the very beginning.
[02:42:51.620 --> 02:43:01.620]  The public can't handle the full truth of 9-11 because it's not all sussed out and we don't know all the exact details, but we know there was a stand down.
[02:43:01.620 --> 02:43:11.620]  We know Saudi Arabia ran it. We know that we then attacked Iraq, arch enemies with them, and that was a war crime.
[02:43:11.620 --> 02:43:18.620]  And so we're this close to the 28 pages coming out. We've already had Jones and others talk about what's in it.
[02:43:18.620 --> 02:43:23.620]  It confirms Panetta and other stand down order. It confirms it all. It's the beginning of the end.
[02:43:23.620 --> 02:43:33.620]  And it's just one symbol of their fall because they've been killing and arresting and persecuting whistleblowers for about 10 years really bad.
[02:43:33.620 --> 02:43:37.620]  It's gotten really bad under Obama, but it was happening under Bush there at the end. Those guys are puppets.
[02:43:37.620 --> 02:43:41.620]  The decision was made about 2006 to start really going after people.
[02:43:41.620 --> 02:43:51.620]  It hasn't worked. More people are just saying, you know what? I'm done. I'm going public or I'm leaking this information.
[02:43:51.620 --> 02:43:58.620]  And that's why they want to go ahead and just have a civil war in this country is because they want to get fellow Americans from a race, color, and creed killing each other
[02:43:58.620 --> 02:44:08.620]  and thinking local government and local cops or a random FBI agent or a random ATF agent or a random person in a government building as your enemy
[02:44:08.620 --> 02:44:14.620]  and as if you're going to stop the New World Order going with a rifle and shooting some people at the IRS.
[02:44:14.620 --> 02:44:18.620]  No, you're not. Don't do it. You couldn't do something worse to help the enemy.
[02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:25.620]  We are interfacing with everybody in the government. We're interfacing with the corporations. We're interfacing with the CEOs.
[02:44:25.620 --> 02:44:31.620]  We're interfacing with the foreign leaders. We're interfacing with the truth and nothing on earth can stop it.
[02:44:31.620 --> 02:44:42.620]  And everybody knows that. So all they can hope for is a huge war, a huge civil war, a huge collapse that they hope diverts everybody.
[02:44:42.620 --> 02:44:46.620]  That's not going to work either. So the globalists are kind of hesitating. They don't know what to do.
[02:44:46.620 --> 02:44:53.620]  They pulled a lot of really nasty tricks, but it's not working. They're like, sir, we've only got a few other options and they're super dangerous too.
[02:44:53.620 --> 02:45:01.620]  We recommend you don't do this and the elite go, but we're stuck. We're already losing. We're telling you don't do it.
[02:45:01.620 --> 02:45:05.620]  And they're going, we've always been in control because we're bold. Go ahead with these plans.
[02:45:05.620 --> 02:45:09.620]  They're like, don't do it. You don't have the momentum. You don't have the people. Don't do it.
[02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:15.620]  But let me tell you, they're telling the elite, don't do it. Don't set off the nuke in New York.
[02:45:15.620 --> 02:45:21.620]  Don't set it off in Chicago. Don't set it off in Dallas. Don't set it off in Austin. I'm listing targets here, folks.
[02:45:21.620 --> 02:45:28.620]  Do not sit there and think they don't know. We are in a death battle with these people.
[02:45:28.620 --> 02:45:33.620]  And the elite are saying they're getting their hands around our neck. What do we do?
[02:45:33.620 --> 02:45:37.620]  And their experts are going, I just try to hope, just leave them alone, hope they turn loose.
[02:45:37.620 --> 02:45:41.620]  We're not turning loose. And you know that because you're not turning loose either.
[02:45:41.620 --> 02:45:44.620]  You may consciously be trying to turn loose of us, but you're like a centipede.
[02:45:44.620 --> 02:45:47.620]  All your other feet and stingers are in our guts attacking us.
[02:45:47.620 --> 02:45:52.620]  You understand? You brought the fight. You attacked us. You want one. You're going to get one.
[02:45:52.620 --> 02:45:55.620]  You understand that? It's a spiritual law.
[02:45:55.620 --> 02:45:59.620]  And I'm only one part of the manifestation of that law. We're coming.
[02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:03.620]  And a lot of people can't handle this. Well, you know what? This planet's real.
[02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:08.620]  This struggle's real. Humanity's real. Free will's real. The spirit's real.
[02:46:08.620 --> 02:46:11.620]  And destiny's real.
[02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:15.620]  So nobody should be bored right now because this is a historic time.
[02:46:15.620 --> 02:46:18.620]  So, Shelley, I don't know how to answer your question about 28 pages.
[02:46:18.620 --> 02:46:22.620]  It's known what's on them. It's been leaked. It's devastating info.
[02:46:22.620 --> 02:46:26.620]  That's the big domino. You knock that, all the others fall.
[02:46:26.620 --> 02:46:31.620]  Yeah, no, I get the gist of it. And you're right. It's not worth hashing up the details.
[02:46:31.620 --> 02:46:35.620]  This is the bigger picture. So I get it.
[02:46:35.620 --> 02:46:39.620]  Well, I'm here to tell you the proudest thing I am is you can debate anything you want.
[02:46:39.620 --> 02:46:44.620]  But two months for 9-11 on the day of 9-11, Alex Jones hit that domino. Boom.
[02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:48.620]  That would have made my life worldwide right there for humanity.
[02:46:48.620 --> 02:46:52.620]  I earned my bones up one side and down the other on that day.
[02:46:52.620 --> 02:46:56.620]  Everything else after that's just gravy before my god.
[02:46:56.620 --> 02:47:00.620]  It's all my sins. I believe there are plenty of them. I feel good at the final equation.
[02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:04.620]  Ma'am, what are you going to do to try to expose these monsters, Shelley?
[02:47:04.620 --> 02:47:09.620]  Hey, listen, I work every day at doing it.
[02:47:09.620 --> 02:47:18.620]  You know, I spread the word every day to people about your show, about vaccines, every day.
[02:47:18.620 --> 02:47:23.620]  You're a sweetheart and God bless you. And I tell you, there's a lot better souls out there than I.
[02:47:23.620 --> 02:47:27.620]  When I talk about myself, it's because it's the journey I've had. You are the leaders. You are the future.
[02:47:27.620 --> 02:47:30.620]  You are unstoppable. And I salute you.
[02:47:30.620 --> 02:47:35.620]  I want to go to Keith and then Karen. Keith in Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:47:35.620 --> 02:47:40.620]  Hello, Alex. I'm going to go off the grid for a minute.
[02:47:40.620 --> 02:47:46.620]  I saw that you want to bring up the burning contest. The one contest I announced that I never followed up or actually did.
[02:47:46.620 --> 02:47:48.620]  And so we're going to do it. Go ahead.
[02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:57.620]  Dude, that was a stroke of brilliance. You are taking it to these people in ways you've had some go viral.
[02:47:57.620 --> 02:48:03.620]  And you're seeing the results of it. I mean, that was a stroke of brilliance.
[02:48:03.620 --> 02:48:06.620]  I just threw it out on air and it's not brilliant. It's just a lot of dumb stuff.
[02:48:06.620 --> 02:48:10.620]  So I'm going to say a few good things. What was the burning contest? Because I want to do the contest.
[02:48:10.620 --> 02:48:14.620]  That was a meme. I mean, what was the plan? Because we never did it.
[02:48:14.620 --> 02:48:23.620]  You announced a meme for the white privilege, non-sensee, to put out that one time.
[02:48:23.620 --> 02:48:30.620]  And you've seen the results from it. I mean, you said it yourself. Look at the title.
[02:48:30.620 --> 02:48:33.620]  Oh, my gosh. I didn't wait for orders from headquarters. You're right.
[02:48:33.620 --> 02:48:36.620]  Buckley says we are now the number one memes on the internet for two weeks.
[02:48:36.620 --> 02:48:41.620]  We never even looked at our own contest info. That's people entering the contest to show white privilege.
[02:48:41.620 --> 02:48:44.620]  And how ridiculous it was. I got so busy and forgot it.
[02:48:44.620 --> 02:48:49.620]  We have to officially launch a new date, make the prize bigger and have the Bernie Sanders meme contest.
[02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:52.620]  See, I'm just busy throwing hand grenades at enemy operations.
[02:48:52.620 --> 02:48:57.620]  And then I forget because I run to the next bunker, what I blew up earlier, what you blew up earlier.
[02:48:57.620 --> 02:49:00.620]  So I was trying to remember that contest I announced, but never followed through on.
[02:49:00.620 --> 02:49:05.620]  The only one I ever failed on. We always pay out on these. We're just doing too much.
[02:49:05.620 --> 02:49:08.620]  So it was a Bernie Sanders meme contest, right?
[02:49:08.620 --> 02:49:14.620]  Yeah. And you know, you're hitting these guys on the level that they can understand.
[02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:17.620]  You know, you said yourself, look how they're dumbed down they are.
[02:49:17.620 --> 02:49:20.620]  They can only communicate through memes.
[02:49:20.620 --> 02:49:24.620]  Look, we got to start converting them one way or the other.
[02:49:24.620 --> 02:49:28.620]  At least get these brain dead people thinking.
[02:49:28.620 --> 02:49:32.620]  And if they're listening, that's a start, correct?
[02:49:32.620 --> 02:49:36.620]  Absolutely. Well, I forgot why Buckley was showing me all these Bernie Sanders memes and stuff.
[02:49:36.620 --> 02:49:40.620]  There were some of the top memes and I forgot that was our contest I ever followed through on.
[02:49:40.620 --> 02:49:44.620]  So I will codify after the show. We will relaunch it and we will follow through on that contest.
[02:49:44.620 --> 02:49:46.620]  That's a great idea.
[02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:49.620]  Well, it's your idea. I just want to say it was a stroke of genius.
[02:49:49.620 --> 02:49:53.620]  Not that one other thing. How's Big doing?
[02:49:53.620 --> 02:49:55.620]  He's back to work. I made him go home two days ago.
[02:49:55.620 --> 02:49:58.620]  He had pneumonia and the flu. He looks good. He lost a bunch of weight.
[02:49:58.620 --> 02:50:01.620]  It wasn't fat, but, you know, he lost a lot of weight. That's the byproduct of it.
[02:50:01.620 --> 02:50:05.620]  Weldon's never been to the hospital. He looks great. He lost a bunch of weight.
[02:50:05.620 --> 02:50:09.620]  He was already skinny. He was in the hospital with this flu or whatever it is.
[02:50:09.620 --> 02:50:12.620]  It's really bad stuff, but Biggs is back.
[02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:16.620]  I'm not going to worry about it anymore unless he starts looking like a hipster.
[02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:19.620]  God bless you, brother. Good to hear from you, Keith.
[02:50:19.620 --> 02:50:24.620]  I'm going to come back and go to Karen and James and Anthony and Jasmine and others.
[02:50:24.620 --> 02:50:27.620]  And then we've got Anthony Gutierrez coming in to take over.
[02:50:27.620 --> 02:50:31.620]  I've not hit the Muslim news yet, and I, you know, I love everybody on this planet.
[02:50:31.620 --> 02:50:34.620]  A lot of great people happen to be under the Muslim faith,
[02:50:34.620 --> 02:50:39.620]  but I tell you what's taken Islam over is really about as bad as it gets.
[02:50:39.620 --> 02:50:42.620]  And the left has now merged with it.
[02:50:42.620 --> 02:50:45.620]  And I want to break that down briefly too when we come back.
[02:50:45.620 --> 02:50:49.620]  The Italian liberals and French liberal designers are saying,
[02:50:49.620 --> 02:50:53.620]  why are all the new clothes designed, hot jib, Muslim stuff,
[02:50:53.620 --> 02:50:56.620]  for Christians and people? What's going on here?
[02:50:56.620 --> 02:50:58.620]  Well, the left wants to kill the west.
[02:50:58.620 --> 02:51:00.620]  Investments in securities involves the risk of loss.
[02:51:00.620 --> 02:51:03.620]  The following is a far too common tale of investing in annuities.
[02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:06.620]  A successful couple invested a large portion of their savings in annuities,
[02:51:06.620 --> 02:51:09.620]  thinking they were a safe way to guarantee a dependable income stream,
[02:51:09.620 --> 02:51:12.620]  no matter what the market did, but it didn't take long for them to regret their decision.
[02:51:12.620 --> 02:51:15.620]  They were locked into low returns, faced potential tax consequences,
[02:51:15.620 --> 02:51:18.620]  and that they couldn't get out of their annuities without paying huge penalties.
[02:51:18.620 --> 02:51:20.620]  They were stuck, and so was their money.
[02:51:20.620 --> 02:51:23.620]  Suddenly their retirement hopes and dreams were in danger,
[02:51:23.620 --> 02:51:26.620]  but it didn't have to happen to them, and it doesn't have to happen to you.

[02:52:57.620 --> 02:53:02.620]  This is Sharon Hunt. Before using hard and body extract, my energy level was very, very low.
[02:53:02.620 --> 02:53:05.620]  I could only walk a few feet and then would have to sit down.
[02:53:05.620 --> 02:53:09.620]  I was tired and lethargic, but after taking hard and body extract,
[02:53:09.620 --> 02:53:14.620]  my energy level has improved greatly and I can now walk longer distances without getting tired so fast.
[02:53:14.620 --> 02:53:16.620]  Thank you, hard and body extract.

[02:55:17.620 --> 02:55:20.620]  So we're changing it a little bit, so it'll still be limited edition,
[02:55:20.620 --> 02:55:23.620]  but basically it's coming back. Infowarsstore.com.
[02:55:23.620 --> 02:55:26.620]  Okay, let's go back to your calls. Next little short segment.
[02:55:26.620 --> 02:55:31.620]  I'm going to play this bizarro clip of Hillary saying it's no big deal if she takes the popular vote
[02:55:31.620 --> 02:55:36.620]  and the superdelegates right now. Karen in Arizona, thanks for holding.
[02:55:36.620 --> 02:55:38.620]  Hi, Alex. Thank you for taking my call.
[02:55:38.620 --> 02:55:43.620]  First of all, I would like to mention I'm taking your joint formula and it works really well.
[02:55:43.620 --> 02:55:44.620]  Thank you.
[02:55:44.620 --> 02:55:47.620]  And also, I like to give a little punch also on your silver bullet.
[02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:50.620]  Sometimes when I wake up with a stuffing nose in the morning,
[02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:55.620]  I put one or two drops of your silver bullet and it clears up my nose.
[02:55:55.620 --> 02:55:58.620]  That's what I do personally is put it with salt,
[02:55:58.620 --> 02:56:01.620]  Epsom salt and hot water with a netty pod, and it's just amazing.
[02:56:01.620 --> 02:56:05.620]  I start getting the sore throat, I gargle with salt and stuff, then do a bunch of silver.
[02:56:05.620 --> 02:56:09.620]  It's been incredible. Thank you for the support.
[02:56:09.620 --> 02:56:17.620]  Also, I do have to reorder the joint, but I want to mention I am a big Trump supporter
[02:56:17.620 --> 02:56:22.620]  and I am planning on mailing my contribution to Roger Stone,
[02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:29.620]  but I want your opinion on Jesse Benton that he was named one of the superdelegates.
[02:56:29.620 --> 02:56:33.620]  I have some concerns about that.
[02:56:33.620 --> 02:56:39.620]  I don't want to be a mean person, and so I'm not going to say anything about Jesse Benton,
[02:56:39.620 --> 02:56:42.620]  but let's just say this, I have a concern.
[02:56:42.620 --> 02:56:45.620]  Who was he named as the superdelegate for?
[02:56:45.620 --> 02:56:48.620]  Donald Trump.
[02:56:48.620 --> 02:56:51.620]  Well, he's better than some of the Republican establishment people,
[02:56:51.620 --> 02:56:55.620]  but man, I'm just not going to sit there and whatever.
[02:56:55.620 --> 02:57:00.620]  I have a concern too, and that's why everybody should be involved heavily in Cleveland.
[02:57:00.620 --> 02:57:03.620]  This is going to be just spectacularly wild.
[02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:05.620]  This is like a real movie, folks.
[02:57:05.620 --> 02:57:10.620]  This is like something out of a movie and then some, and so I was not aware of that,
[02:57:10.620 --> 02:57:13.620]  but because Ron Paul is not, I like Ron Paul.
[02:57:13.620 --> 02:57:15.620]  He's not supporting Trump because he's some of the purest views,
[02:57:15.620 --> 02:57:18.620]  and I know Benton has done some other things,
[02:57:18.620 --> 02:57:23.620]  but you know, I guess Benton's better than like Mitch McConnell's people. I don't know.
[02:57:23.620 --> 02:57:29.620]  Also, I have a friend named Gary, and if you want information off the line,
[02:57:29.620 --> 02:57:34.620]  he lives in Texas, and he is a delegate also,
[02:57:34.620 --> 02:57:37.620]  but he won't be able to go to the superdelegate,
[02:57:37.620 --> 02:57:42.620]  and he told me that he stopped just by two votes to have them
[02:57:42.620 --> 02:57:47.620]  from voting on the delegate level in Texas through the diebolt machines.
[02:57:47.620 --> 02:57:49.620]  Wow. Yeah, major election fraud in Texas.
[02:57:49.620 --> 02:57:52.620]  Even the election board said that it looks like Cruz got robbed.
[02:57:52.620 --> 02:57:55.620]  I mean, look, he won Louisiana. They gave it to Ted Cruz.
[02:57:55.620 --> 02:57:59.620]  But yes, we'll put you on hold. We want to hear from delegates, superdelegates.
[02:57:59.620 --> 02:58:02.620]  We're going to really be focusing heavily on this.
[02:58:02.620 --> 02:58:04.620]  Bernie Sanders is being robbed as well.
[02:58:04.620 --> 02:58:08.620]  He was winning those first states, so they would just give the delegates to Hillary
[02:58:08.620 --> 02:58:10.620]  and tell her supporters on CNN.
[02:58:10.620 --> 02:58:12.620]  They'd say, just give up. Your vote doesn't count. Hillary's got it.
[02:58:12.620 --> 02:58:15.620]  So most of them started switching to Hillary,
[02:58:15.620 --> 02:58:19.620]  creating a self-fulfilling prophecy where she now is winning a lot of the popular vote.
[02:58:19.620 --> 02:58:22.620]  I thought we had a clip of it coming up. Thank you, Karen.
[02:58:22.620 --> 02:58:25.620]  Let's go to Luke in Tennessee. Who's been holding the longest?
[02:58:25.620 --> 02:58:27.620]  No, James in Texas.
[02:58:27.620 --> 02:58:30.620]  Then Caesar in Mexico.
[02:58:30.620 --> 02:58:33.620]  We'll talk about Jasmine, Luke, and everybody else.
[02:58:33.620 --> 02:58:37.620]  We got Luke as a Tennessee Democrat voting for Trump.
[02:58:37.620 --> 02:58:39.620]  Tennessee Democrat in that Davy Crockett.
[02:58:39.620 --> 02:58:40.620]  We'll be back. Stay with us.
[02:58:40.620 --> 02:58:53.620]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:59:10.620 --> 02:59:24.620]  We're introducing the best yet, the brand new Pro Pure Pro Max high-performance shower filter.

[03:00:09.620 --> 03:00:12.620]  Here's a clip of Hillary Clinton.
[03:00:12.620 --> 03:00:16.620]  She doesn't think superdelegates system is inappropriate.
[03:00:16.620 --> 03:00:19.620]  Here she is trying to confuse the viewers of MSNBC.
[03:00:19.620 --> 03:00:22.620]  To be clear on this issue of superdelegates versus delegates,
[03:00:22.620 --> 03:00:25.620]  the Republican Party really wishes they had superdelegates right now
[03:00:25.620 --> 03:00:30.620]  because they'd love to have some manifestation of the establishment worries
[03:00:30.620 --> 03:00:35.620]  about their front-runner that they could throw a big part of the nominating process
[03:00:35.620 --> 03:00:39.620]  back basically to the party and take it away from the voters.
[03:00:39.620 --> 03:00:43.620]  Do you make a distinction between the different kinds of delegates that the Democrats have?
[03:00:43.620 --> 03:00:47.620]  I mean, are superdelegates an inappropriate thing in terms of the process
[03:00:47.620 --> 03:00:51.620]  that there are these party leaders and elected officials who can make such a big difference?
[03:00:51.620 --> 03:00:55.620]  Well, I have more popular votes and I have more pledged delegates
[03:00:55.620 --> 03:01:01.620]  and we have a system in our party that was set up before I decided...
[03:01:01.620 --> 03:01:05.620]  That's enough. Man, I should have played that earlier and played that all day.
[03:01:05.620 --> 03:01:08.620]  Maybe Anthony will play it again coming up and he'll continue with your calls.
[03:01:08.620 --> 03:01:12.620]  I'm going to take a few right now, but they didn't change it till the 70s.
[03:01:12.620 --> 03:01:15.620]  They didn't dare try it till now.
[03:01:15.620 --> 03:01:17.620]  There is a popular vote. It's under state law.
[03:01:17.620 --> 03:01:20.620]  People think they're voting. It's going to be counted.
[03:01:20.620 --> 03:01:23.620]  There is real fraud here. This is false advertising.
[03:01:23.620 --> 03:01:27.620]  You cheated early on when you were losing to steal the delegates
[03:01:27.620 --> 03:01:33.620]  to then say you were ahead to swing people to now vote for you.
[03:01:33.620 --> 03:01:36.620]  And so to see Matt, I'm going, hey, is this kind of weird, you know,
[03:01:36.620 --> 03:01:42.620]  that party officials have so much power and change votes?
[03:01:42.620 --> 03:01:44.620]  And then Hillary just acts like, hey, it's not me.
[03:01:44.620 --> 03:01:48.620]  I mean, wow, that's how you come home and somebody's kidnapping your five-year-old
[03:01:48.620 --> 03:01:50.620]  and you're like, what are you doing?
[03:01:50.620 --> 03:01:55.620]  Oh, I'm just taking them to McDonald's with me and you got your hand over their mouth and everything.
[03:01:55.620 --> 03:01:58.620]  It's just crazy. They open the kit up.
[03:01:58.620 --> 03:02:02.620]  The truck up or the van up. There's other tied up kids inside.
[03:02:02.620 --> 03:02:05.620]  They're like, never mind them. They're happy, too.
[03:02:05.620 --> 03:02:08.620]  Let's go to Caesar in Mexico. Let's go to Mexico.
[03:02:08.620 --> 03:02:11.620]  Caesar, go ahead.
[03:02:11.620 --> 03:02:13.620]  Hey there, Alex Jones. First-time caller.
[03:02:13.620 --> 03:02:15.620]  Been hearing you for about eight years. It's an honor to be on the show.
[03:02:15.620 --> 03:02:17.620]  It's an honor to talk to you, Caesar.
[03:02:17.620 --> 03:02:19.620]  I have two points I want to cover. Thank you so much.
[03:02:19.620 --> 03:02:21.620]  I have two points. I want to be as brief as possible.
[03:02:21.620 --> 03:02:26.620]  I'm living in Mexico about 10 years now, almost, and I grew up in the United States,
[03:02:26.620 --> 03:02:29.620]  as a matter of fact, and I'm right now pursuing a career here in Mexico.
[03:02:29.620 --> 03:02:36.620]  But what I want to get at is I have been seeing how the NWO agenda has been infiltrating Mexico.
[03:02:36.620 --> 03:02:40.620]  There are two points real fast. One is in May 25th of this year,
[03:02:40.620 --> 03:02:48.620]  they want to try to pass a law which prohibits or limits the freedom of religious organizations
[03:02:48.620 --> 03:02:54.620]  and the aspect of, like, evangelizing, you know, like propaganda and religious organizations.
[03:02:54.620 --> 03:02:59.620]  So they're trying to pass a law in the House of Senates in the state of Mexico,
[03:02:59.620 --> 03:03:05.620]  and they're saying that, you know, religious organizations have to stop being so insistent
[03:03:05.620 --> 03:03:08.620]  when it comes to quote-unquote evangelizing.
[03:03:08.620 --> 03:03:12.620]  Oh yeah, that's part of the UN deal, part of the World Council of Churches.
[03:03:12.620 --> 03:03:16.620]  I was aware that was going on. I didn't know that it was in the Federal Senate of Mexico,
[03:03:16.620 --> 03:03:19.620]  or is this a state trying to do it?
[03:03:19.620 --> 03:03:21.620]  No, it's actually the Federal, yeah, because here...
[03:03:21.620 --> 03:03:24.620]  Wow, wow, that's a big story, because that's happening all over the world,
[03:03:24.620 --> 03:03:28.620]  and I bet money, I know which organizations behind that, the old Pope,
[03:03:28.620 --> 03:03:31.620]  wants to shut down his competition, amazing.
[03:03:31.620 --> 03:03:38.620]  And so tell us the name of it or a news headline, because I want to look this up and cover it.
[03:03:38.620 --> 03:03:41.620]  I don't have it right now, but I can give you it in a moment.
[03:03:41.620 --> 03:03:43.620]  I don't have it, it's in my tablet.
[03:03:43.620 --> 03:03:47.620]  What's going on all over the place? We'll look into it. What was the other point?
[03:03:47.620 --> 03:03:51.620]  Yeah, another point is this, it's amazing. It was about, remember when Ratfinger,
[03:03:51.620 --> 03:03:55.620]  Pope Ratfinger was Pope, he came here approximately, I don't remember,
[03:03:55.620 --> 03:03:58.620]  time just goes by so fast, I don't remember, it was like five years ago or something.
[03:03:58.620 --> 03:04:04.620]  Pope Ratfinger came four years ago, maybe, he came to visit one of the big cities here in Mexico,
[03:04:04.620 --> 03:04:11.620]  and this is crazy, I have a client where I work, he's a lawyer, he teaches law,
[03:04:11.620 --> 03:04:15.620]  he gave me an inside scoop, he writes articles for a local newspaper,
[03:04:15.620 --> 03:04:19.620]  and he explained to me in private, he said, you know what, the Pope,
[03:04:19.620 --> 03:04:23.620]  he's trying, in his visit here, he's trying to push a law,
[03:04:23.620 --> 03:04:28.620]  and to get in accordance with the government leaders here, to make a tie,
[03:04:28.620 --> 03:04:34.620]  look at this, a tax, an extra tax for all the citizens here in Mexico,
[03:04:34.620 --> 03:04:39.620]  and that tax would go as a tie or an offering to the Vatican Church,
[03:04:39.620 --> 03:04:42.620]  and I couldn't believe it, but thankfully it didn't pass it.
[03:04:42.620 --> 03:04:44.620]  Oh yeah, well that's what the Catholic Church used to do,
[03:04:44.620 --> 03:04:48.620]  all those countries had to pay that, you also had to give the Pope personally money,
[03:04:48.620 --> 03:04:53.620]  or he wouldn't get your family out of purgatory. Amazing, yeah, no, I'm actually aware of that,
[03:04:53.620 --> 03:04:58.620]  although this Pope is one of the richest guys in the world, he's amazing.
[03:04:58.620 --> 03:05:03.620]  The New York Daily News says, maybe the system really is rigged, you think?
[03:05:03.620 --> 03:05:08.620]  The Democrat paper came to this conclusion, after contacting Democrat superdelegates in New York,
[03:05:08.620 --> 03:05:12.620]  and asking if they would switch from Hillary to Bernie if they won the popular vote.
[03:05:12.620 --> 03:05:15.620]  Every single superdelegate said no.
[03:05:15.620 --> 03:05:18.620]  Just like the Republican establishment, with its never Trump movement,
[03:05:18.620 --> 03:05:21.620]  the Democrat establishment is never Bernie.
[03:05:21.620 --> 03:05:23.620]  Welcome to crony socialism.
[03:05:23.620 --> 03:05:29.620]  Democrats should ask themselves why they want a crooked, rigged system to control everything.
[03:05:29.620 --> 03:05:33.620]  Now crony capitalism can't happen without crony socialism.
[03:05:33.620 --> 03:05:35.620]  In the GOP, they steal it differently.
[03:05:35.620 --> 03:05:38.620]  There they wait until after the election to steal it.
[03:05:38.620 --> 03:05:41.620]  Like in South Carolina, where the voters gave Trump every delegate,
[03:05:41.620 --> 03:05:46.620]  the crews came in later with the establishment and appointed his friends as delegates.
[03:05:46.620 --> 03:05:52.620]  Go to infowars.com to follow this open theft of our elections, and to find out what you can do about it.

[03:06:57.620 --> 03:07:16.620]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[03:07:16.620 --> 03:07:25.620]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right there. I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind of clears up.
[03:07:25.620 --> 03:07:37.620]  You have stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:07:37.620 --> 03:07:41.620]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force.
[03:07:41.620 --> 03:07:47.620]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force, and came in.
[03:07:47.620 --> 03:07:57.620]  You will find brain force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[03:08:04.620 --> 03:08:06.620]  Oh, that's good music.
[03:08:06.620 --> 03:08:08.620]  Robert Plant, baby.
[03:08:08.620 --> 03:08:15.620]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:15.620 --> 03:08:18.620]  Yeah, before I was married, I sometimes had long-distance relationships.
[03:08:18.620 --> 03:08:21.620]  Girlfriends in Dallas, you name it. Houston.
[03:08:21.620 --> 03:08:31.620]  And there was something about that long drive to go meet the woman, especially as it got dark, and the lights and the song just describes it. It just builds on.
[03:08:31.620 --> 03:08:36.620]  That relationship is so special. That's why they're attacking families, attacking the very species.
[03:08:36.620 --> 03:08:42.620]  The globalists might as well be aliens from deep space. They hate us that much. They are literally here to override our culture.
[03:08:42.620 --> 03:08:53.620]  I didn't get to this. Anthony Hucciardi is the political correctness, University of North Carolina, diversity workshop, brands, band-aids as white privilege.
[03:08:53.620 --> 03:08:59.620]  Okay, just make everything racist, except the globalists stealing all of our basic liberties and freedom.
[03:08:59.620 --> 03:09:02.620]  He's going to go to your calls to Jasmine in California, Trump supporter.
[03:09:02.620 --> 03:09:15.620]  We're going to look at Tennessee Democrat voting for Trump. James in Texas, a new vitamin supplement ideas, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. Anthony is taking over.
[03:09:15.620 --> 03:09:21.620]  But CJ walked in and said, hey, you never played the video you've been promoting.
[03:09:21.620 --> 03:09:28.620]  And I forget the exact title, meet the dumb butts, says something else, but that hate Trump.
[03:09:28.620 --> 03:09:35.620]  Radio listener, it's pretty powerful, but I kind of need to narrate it. For TV viewers, you can obviously see this.
[03:09:35.620 --> 03:09:43.620]  These people, I don't put them down to feel good about myself. They're scary dumb. They're like, Saudi Arabia is executing people that are gay.
[03:09:43.620 --> 03:09:51.620]  Well, it's wrong. They should execute everyone. They didn't even understand, because it's always about equality, equality.
[03:09:51.620 --> 03:09:59.620]  Stop your legs off as somebody else's in a wheelchair. It's like, can't say mother and father or somebody else doesn't have a mother and father.
[03:09:59.620 --> 03:10:07.620]  It's, well, not all the Saudis are like that. The point is they're totalitarian, not Donald Trump.
[03:10:07.620 --> 03:10:12.620]  So that's what we're getting at. And so I want to play this clip. There's a bunch of others.
[03:10:12.620 --> 03:10:21.620]  We've got Rob Do and we got Travis Knight and Michael Zimmerman out there on the road, following the people attacking Trump and the other side of the equation.
[03:10:21.620 --> 03:10:26.620]  The Trump people are all real scared of media and won't talk to the camera. But once they do, they're pretty informed.
[03:10:26.620 --> 03:10:34.620]  Now, about one in six or seven, maybe one in five is an info horse listener, which scares me because somebody must be bootleg in t-shirts.
[03:10:34.620 --> 03:10:39.620]  I'm not selling that many. And anywhere we go, we see them. So I guess it's our listeners or the politically active people.
[03:10:39.620 --> 03:10:46.620]  That's why this is happening. So bravo to everybody out there. We salute you. Anthony Gutiardi is here about to take over.
[03:10:46.620 --> 03:10:52.620]  The new fight of the mineral fusion is in. It will sell out by Monday or Tuesday. Take advantage of it at infowarslife.com.
[03:10:52.620 --> 03:10:54.620]  And you are the folks that built info wars.
[03:10:54.620 --> 03:10:58.620]  Natalie News is coming up tonight, seven o'clock central as well with the rest of our great crew.
[03:10:58.620 --> 03:11:03.620]  But before I hand the baton over, let's just go ahead and go to this video.
[03:11:03.620 --> 03:11:08.620]  And then coming up, we also have kingdom games, the passion of Christian entertainment.
[03:11:08.620 --> 03:11:12.620]  And the reason I like this jacari Jackson report, and I meant to get to it earlier.
[03:11:12.620 --> 03:11:22.620]  Is there's big articles out from Bloomberg, CNS today about Christian films aren't just dominating like the passion of the Christ six, seven years ago with a billion plus domestically.
[03:11:22.620 --> 03:11:27.620]  They're taken over Christian libertarian conservative films to niche markets are good.
[03:11:27.620 --> 03:11:32.620]  They're informative. And when the rest of Hollywood's in trouble, they're making money.
[03:11:32.620 --> 03:11:46.620]  So it's an example of vote with your dollars for hardcore liberty media, for people to tell the truth, for culture, for non GMO food, for organic, for good nutraceuticals, whatever it is, while there's still a tiny bit of free market.
[03:11:46.620 --> 03:11:54.620]  Getting involved with that. Having free choice will displace all of the garbage.
[03:11:54.620 --> 03:11:57.620]  So whether you love Christians or not, that's not the issue.
[03:11:57.620 --> 03:12:05.620]  When you support something, when you create a culture, when you back that culture, if it is better, it will supplant the previous forced culture.
[03:12:05.620 --> 03:12:09.620]  So that's coming up as well. Very, very important report.
[03:12:09.620 --> 03:12:23.620]  But let's go to some of the events there in Appleton, Wisconsin yesterday that Rob do witnessed were actual social justice warriors kept coming over and saying, you're a white male, you're not allowed to speak.
[03:12:23.620 --> 03:12:29.620]  So you know what? It's those same people that came, that are putting food on your table, vegetables and everything else.
[03:12:29.620 --> 03:12:30.620]  Because you-
[03:12:30.620 --> 03:12:31.620]  I grow my own food.
[03:12:31.620 --> 03:12:32.620]  Hey, check yourself, dude.
[03:12:32.620 --> 03:12:38.620]  Patriarchy runs the world, so check your white male privilege.
[03:12:38.620 --> 03:12:39.620]  Okay.
[03:12:39.620 --> 03:12:41.620]  Check yourself what? What are you gonna go on with?
[03:12:41.620 --> 03:12:45.620]  Are you a social justice warrior? Are you some kind of white knight now? You're gonna come-
[03:12:45.620 --> 03:12:46.620]  No, I'm not claiming to be a white knight.
[03:12:46.620 --> 03:12:48.620]  All right, well, I'm talking to her.
[03:12:48.620 --> 03:12:49.620]  Can we do it?
[03:12:49.620 --> 03:12:57.620]  Yeah.
[03:12:57.620 --> 03:13:00.620]  I'm a Trump supporter, but we can still get along.
[03:13:00.620 --> 03:13:29.620]  You tell us to love everybody. What you're doing is you're harassing the people that are standing in this line to go to this event, right?
[03:13:29.620 --> 03:13:39.620]  Okay, we're not- you know, if you want to love everybody, you wouldn't start these kind of things.
[03:13:39.620 --> 03:13:41.620]  You wouldn't carry a sign that's just gonna make people mad.
[03:13:41.620 --> 03:13:46.620]  We're supporting the people that we love. We're here trying to stand up for what we believe in.
[03:13:46.620 --> 03:13:48.620]  What is going on with the Democrats?
[03:13:48.620 --> 03:13:51.620]  This is not political. This is not political.
[03:13:51.620 --> 03:13:53.620]  This is not political.
[03:13:53.620 --> 03:14:01.620]  This is not with a political party. I'm here because I'm supporting students of color at Lawrence and the people of color in America and in Appleton and all around that are not-
[03:14:01.620 --> 03:14:05.620]  that feel threatened, that don't feel safe because of this exact kind of gathering.
[03:14:05.620 --> 03:14:07.620]  That's right, but I think he's got some legitimacy.
[03:14:07.620 --> 03:14:09.620]  He's trying to build a wall to block out Mexicans.
[03:14:09.620 --> 03:14:10.620]  Why is that-
[03:14:10.620 --> 03:14:13.620]  No, no, no, he's not trying to build a wall to block out Mexicans.
[03:14:13.620 --> 03:14:18.620]  He's trying to build a wall to block out- to secure the border.
[03:14:18.620 --> 03:14:24.620]  Trump's a pony! Yes he is!
[03:14:24.620 --> 03:14:25.620]  First, let me check a selfie.
[03:14:25.620 --> 03:14:29.620]  Trump's a pony! Yes he is!
[03:14:29.620 --> 03:14:30.620]  Trump's a pony!
[03:14:30.620 --> 03:14:33.620]  Trump's a pony!
[03:14:33.620 --> 03:14:36.620]  Trump's a pony!
[03:14:36.620 --> 03:14:43.620]  Trump's a pony!
[03:14:43.620 --> 03:14:47.620]  Trump's a pony!
[03:14:47.620 --> 03:14:52.620]  Love not hate, love not hate, love not hate, love not hate.
[03:15:17.620 --> 03:15:25.620]  What news would I work out here from? I'm just curious.
[03:15:25.620 --> 03:15:27.620]  There's info wars right here.
[03:15:27.620 --> 03:15:31.620]  Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!
[03:15:31.620 --> 03:15:33.620]  The quickest way to clear out a protest.
[03:15:33.620 --> 03:15:34.620]  Now have a good one.
[03:15:34.620 --> 03:15:35.620]  Thank you.
[03:15:35.620 --> 03:15:36.620]  What do we want?
[03:15:36.620 --> 03:15:37.620]  Equality!
[03:15:37.620 --> 03:15:39.620]  First, let me take a selfie.
[03:15:39.620 --> 03:15:40.620]  What do we want?
[03:15:40.620 --> 03:15:41.620]  Now!
[03:15:41.620 --> 03:15:42.620]  What do we want?
[03:15:42.620 --> 03:15:43.620]  Equality!
[03:15:43.620 --> 03:15:44.620]  What do we want?
[03:15:44.620 --> 03:15:45.620]  Now!
[03:15:45.620 --> 03:15:46.620]  What do we want?
[03:15:46.620 --> 03:15:47.620]  Now!
[03:15:47.620 --> 03:15:48.620]  What?
[03:15:48.620 --> 03:15:50.620]  Now what do we want?
[03:15:50.620 --> 03:15:52.620]  Prime!
[03:15:52.620 --> 03:15:53.620]  Let's do 2 Jets!
[03:15:53.620 --> 03:15:55.620]  Let's do 2 Jets!
[03:15:55.620 --> 03:15:57.620]  Let's do 2 Jets!
[03:15:58.620 --> 03:16:02.620]  Filming!
[03:16:05.620 --> 03:16:08.620]  First let me take a selfie.
[03:16:10.620 --> 03:16:11.620]  Let's do 1.
[03:16:12.620 --> 03:16:13.620]  That's 1.
[03:16:13.620 --> 03:16:15.620]  I mean, you can't break it!
[03:16:15.620 --> 03:16:17.620]  Junot is rubbing!
[03:16:17.620 --> 03:16:19.620]  Junot is rubbing!
[03:16:34.620 --> 03:16:36.620]  Oh, oh, now you're going to play the...
[03:16:36.620 --> 03:16:37.620]  Oh, you're special!
[03:16:37.620 --> 03:16:40.620]  So you're a Miss Andrews, got it.
[03:16:40.620 --> 03:16:42.620]  Miss Andrews doesn't have a say!
[03:16:42.620 --> 03:16:45.620]  Miss Andrews doesn't exist? You hate men!
[03:16:45.620 --> 03:16:47.620]  Let's take a man talking down to me.
[03:16:47.620 --> 03:16:48.620]  What are you doing?
[03:16:48.620 --> 03:16:52.620]  That's the same thing I do to him as I do to you
[03:16:52.620 --> 03:16:55.620]  I gotta go, I gotta go!
[03:16:55.620 --> 03:16:57.620]  Check your …
[03:16:57.620 --> 03:17:03.620]  Love, God, hate! Love, God, hate! Love, God, hate! Love, God, hate, love, God, hate!
[03:17:03.620 --> 03:17:22.500]  All right, there we go, there's the video ending with a nice slow clap.
[03:17:22.500 --> 03:17:26.820]  Definitely an interesting summary of some of the anti-Trump protesters.
[03:17:26.820 --> 03:17:33.100]  And to me, the craziest part about all of it is that look, I could argue on both sides
[03:17:33.100 --> 03:17:36.860]  of the equation, intellectually, not saying I'm the smartest person in the world or the
[03:17:36.860 --> 03:17:40.220]  most researched, but I could at least bring some points up.
[03:17:40.220 --> 03:17:43.900]  The thing that kills me is when people just throw out buzzwords.
[03:17:43.900 --> 03:17:48.740]  They throw out loaded buzzwords, they've heard on the news, or they've read online, and they
[03:17:48.740 --> 03:17:54.020]  say something like, well, you know, he's hateful, he's a bigot, he's whatever it is, and this
[03:17:54.020 --> 03:17:56.060]  could be about anyone, not just Trump.
[03:17:56.060 --> 03:18:00.380]  And you say, well, give me some real solid reasons to back up what you're saying.
[03:18:00.380 --> 03:18:02.220]  And I had this conversation the other day.
[03:18:02.220 --> 03:18:05.420]  And what's funny is, I'm not even claiming sides.
[03:18:05.420 --> 03:18:11.020]  I'm saying, give me a solid reason, give me an example of what you're talking about.
[03:18:11.020 --> 03:18:16.820]  And they'll say something like, well, you know, he's a racist, okay, well, give me an example.
[03:18:16.820 --> 03:18:17.820]  What about his policies?
[03:18:17.820 --> 03:18:20.220]  Do you agree with his policies?
[03:18:20.220 --> 03:18:21.580]  And this is on both sides.
[03:18:21.580 --> 03:18:26.620]  My problem is, I could go to one of those rallies, and if they asked me, I could, for
[03:18:26.620 --> 03:18:33.500]  either side, argue some policy that I support, I could argue some things that he said specifically
[03:18:33.500 --> 03:18:37.140]  that I'm for or against, and it just blows my mind.
[03:18:37.140 --> 03:18:42.460]  And I think it's going back hundreds of years in intellectual evolution, when it has turned
[03:18:42.460 --> 03:18:48.340]  into just screaming, like, buzzwords at each other and labeling things to where we can't
[03:18:48.340 --> 03:18:50.540]  even have a real discussion anymore.
[03:18:50.540 --> 03:18:54.100]  And it's one thing, if you could say, well, you know, that's a small percentage of the
[03:18:54.100 --> 03:18:59.220]  population and they go to these rallies, no, the media has adopted this now.
[03:18:59.220 --> 03:19:04.060]  Because of the clickbait style headlines that go down in the news today, they also just
[03:19:04.060 --> 03:19:07.420]  put things in the headlines because they know that people don't read the stories.
[03:19:07.420 --> 03:19:12.820]  So they just put things in the headlines like bigots, hate, racist, all that kind of stuff.
[03:19:12.820 --> 03:19:17.180]  When the funniest thing about it is the media is most of the time, the ones that are the
[03:19:17.180 --> 03:19:20.420]  purveyors of hatred and the ones fueling the fire.
[03:19:20.420 --> 03:19:23.420]  And that's why we're going to talk about this article.
[03:19:23.420 --> 03:19:28.340]  The North Carolina Diversity Workshop brands beige band-aids as white privilege, and I've
[03:19:28.340 --> 03:19:30.020]  got some things to say about that.
[03:19:30.020 --> 03:19:33.300]  We're also going to talk about a story you're not going to hear in the mainstream media,
[03:19:33.300 --> 03:19:34.300]  apparently.
[03:19:34.300 --> 03:19:39.060]  And that is about the FBI and Department of Justice investigating a joint investigation
[03:19:39.060 --> 03:19:42.540]  into a massive global bribery racket of the oil industry.
[03:19:42.540 --> 03:19:44.940]  That and a lot more and some videos coming up.
[03:19:44.940 --> 03:19:45.940]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:45.940 --> 03:19:46.940]  This is the Fourth Hour.
[03:19:46.940 --> 03:19:47.940]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:19:47.940 --> 03:19:54.940]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi and I'm Anthony Gucciardi and I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:20:17.940 --> 03:20:21.900]  Part and body extract talks about the positive effects of heart and body extract.
[03:20:21.900 --> 03:20:26.180]  What happens with the formula heart and body extract is it's giving the body the necessary
[03:20:26.180 --> 03:20:31.900]  vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:20:31.900 --> 03:20:36.460]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol,
[03:20:36.460 --> 03:20:38.340]  clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:20:38.340 --> 03:20:43.780]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics, so the body is an amazing thing.
[03:20:43.780 --> 03:20:47.020]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:20:47.020 --> 03:20:49.340]  Heart and body extract gets results.

[03:20:58.780 --> 03:21:00.620]  Investments in securities involves the risk of loss.
[03:21:00.620 --> 03:21:03.660]  The following is a far too common tale of investing in annuities.
[03:21:03.660 --> 03:21:07.100]  A successful couple invested a large portion of their savings in annuities thinking they
[03:21:07.100 --> 03:21:10.860]  were a safe way to guarantee a dependable income stream no matter what the market did.
[03:21:10.860 --> 03:21:13.020]  But it didn't take long for them to regret their decision.
[03:21:13.020 --> 03:21:16.900]  They were locked into low returns, faced potential tax consequences and that they couldn't get
[03:21:16.900 --> 03:21:19.380]  out of their annuities without paying huge penalties.
[03:21:19.380 --> 03:21:21.420]  They were stuck and so was their money.
[03:21:21.420 --> 03:21:24.540]  Suddenly their retirement hopes and dreams were in danger, but it didn't have to happen

[03:22:08.740 --> 03:22:12.420]  A while back a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:22:12.420 --> 03:22:16.660]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:22:16.660 --> 03:22:18.180]  I said, let me see.
[03:22:18.180 --> 03:22:23.020]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated price competitive
[03:22:23.020 --> 03:22:28.700]  companies we represent and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been

[03:23:52.500 --> 03:23:53.500]  800-803-5505.
[03:23:53.500 --> 03:24:14.260]  All right, so I've got a bunch of news here and some of it is so absurd that it feels
[03:24:14.260 --> 03:24:15.260]  like I'm reading the onion.
[03:24:15.260 --> 03:24:19.100]  But I'm not reading the onion and we're going to have to get to all of it.
[03:24:19.100 --> 03:24:24.220]  One of them is of course the University of North Carolina Diversity Workshop that rates
[03:24:24.220 --> 03:24:29.460]  students based on their white privilege and they talk about beige band-aids.
[03:24:29.460 --> 03:24:34.540]  They have you do a score from zero to five how privileged you are and how like racist
[03:24:34.540 --> 03:24:37.300]  you are and just the total absurdity of it.
[03:24:37.300 --> 03:24:39.100]  So we're going to talk about that in a second.
[03:24:39.100 --> 03:24:44.740]  Another story, so I had one earlier about this chair that people are buying.
[03:24:44.740 --> 03:24:48.900]  I sent all this over to you guys as well back in the studio there.
[03:24:48.900 --> 03:24:53.660]  So this chair is designed to hug you so that you feel like someone is comforting you and
[03:24:53.660 --> 03:24:55.500]  maybe someone loves you.
[03:24:55.500 --> 03:24:58.100]  And I was just going to talk about that in the state of our culture and this is from
[03:24:58.100 --> 03:25:03.340]  really South Korea, which it's much worse in some ways over there in certain circumstances.
[03:25:03.340 --> 03:25:05.100]  But Alex showed me this one.
[03:25:05.100 --> 03:25:10.020]  Children now spend less time outside than the average prisoner, a prisoner in their
[03:25:10.020 --> 03:25:11.020]  own home.
[03:25:11.020 --> 03:25:14.580]  They spend less time outside than the average prisoner.
[03:25:14.580 --> 03:25:20.460]  So we're going to talk about that and we're going to talk about this oil racketeering bribery
[03:25:20.460 --> 03:25:26.980]  racket investigation, the FBI and the DOJs on this is from the age slash Huffington Post.
[03:25:26.980 --> 03:25:30.460]  The Fairfax Media and the Huffington Post can reveal the U.S. giant Halliburton and its
[03:25:30.460 --> 03:25:36.020]  former subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Root are embroiled in the UNO oil bribes for contracts
[03:25:36.020 --> 03:25:39.060]  scandal through their operations in former Soviet states.
[03:25:39.060 --> 03:25:42.300]  Man, who knew there might be some fishy stuff going on with the oil industry.
[03:25:42.300 --> 03:25:43.300]  That is just wacky.
[03:25:43.300 --> 03:25:48.740]  No, but it's a big deal right now in Reddit that none of the major news companies, CNN,
[03:25:48.740 --> 03:25:50.420]  Fox, etc., are covering this story.
[03:25:50.420 --> 03:25:51.420]  So we're going to talk about.
[03:25:51.420 --> 03:25:53.580]  And then Leigh Ann also is going to join us.
[03:25:53.580 --> 03:25:55.300]  Leigh Ann McAdoo is going to join us in the next segment.
[03:25:55.300 --> 03:25:58.660]  I was coming in here to host the show and she told me she had some really, really good
[03:25:58.660 --> 03:26:02.180]  news, powerful news that coincided with what we're talking about today.
[03:26:02.180 --> 03:26:05.620]  So I said, hey, jump on and show us and she said she's got some really good stuff.
[03:26:05.620 --> 03:26:09.740]  But first, before the long segment coming up, I want to get to some of these calls because
[03:26:09.740 --> 03:26:11.220]  they sound very interesting.
[03:26:11.220 --> 03:26:14.140]  So I want to jump to Luke in Tennessee.
[03:26:14.140 --> 03:26:16.660]  He says he's a Democrat voting for Trump.
[03:26:16.660 --> 03:26:20.460]  Now, Luke, first, tell me what is on your mind here.
[03:26:20.460 --> 03:26:23.780]  Well, I'm actually a very short time listener.
[03:26:23.780 --> 03:26:25.980]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:26:25.980 --> 03:26:30.140]  And I got to tell you, I'm very impressed with you guys overall with Alex and I'm impressed
[03:26:30.140 --> 03:26:31.780]  with how sharp your audience is.
[03:26:31.780 --> 03:26:36.820]  I mean, I'm absolutely genuinely impressed and I like how you guys push Trump.
[03:26:36.820 --> 03:26:38.700]  Well, you know, thanks.
[03:26:38.700 --> 03:26:41.980]  I'm always happy to be invited to join the show here.
[03:26:41.980 --> 03:26:47.460]  And look, my question to you is, so you say you're a Democrat who's supporting Trump.
[03:26:47.460 --> 03:26:50.620]  And I actually haven't even said I'm supporting anyone.
[03:26:50.620 --> 03:26:52.500]  But let me ask you this.
[03:26:52.500 --> 03:26:58.220]  Does it shock you to see the anti-Trump protesters and what I was speaking about earlier, not
[03:26:58.220 --> 03:27:02.740]  talking about specific things, not talking about specific policy concerns or any form
[03:27:02.740 --> 03:27:07.620]  of intellectual discussion, just screaming racist, screaming bigot, just screaming buzzwords?
[03:27:07.620 --> 03:27:10.100]  I mean, what do you think about that?
[03:27:10.100 --> 03:27:12.180]  Well, yeah.
[03:27:12.180 --> 03:27:17.860]  And just for full disclosure, my mother actually was a longtime supporter or move on.org, which
[03:27:17.860 --> 03:27:20.140]  she no longer, you know, is a part of.
[03:27:20.140 --> 03:27:24.100]  But I can tell you that as far as that, you don't see, I mean, everybody's going to tell
[03:27:24.100 --> 03:27:26.700]  you that you don't see these type of protests.
[03:27:26.700 --> 03:27:31.780]  You don't see Trump protesters doing this at a Hillary Clinton rally, but it's deeper
[03:27:31.780 --> 03:27:32.780]  than that.
[03:27:32.780 --> 03:27:39.260]  I mean, what's funny about it is if the Trump campaign managers would actually maybe call
[03:27:39.260 --> 03:27:45.620]  their rallies job fairs, these people wouldn't even be there, first of all, you know, something
[03:27:45.620 --> 03:27:46.620]  like that.
[03:27:46.620 --> 03:27:51.380]  But what's funny about it, you said something earlier about that there's no substance.
[03:27:51.380 --> 03:27:53.500]  These people are so into the buzzwords.
[03:27:53.500 --> 03:27:59.500]  You could, you know, you could probably write an article that said Trump is a racist, smacks
[03:27:59.500 --> 03:28:04.460]  African American woman, and then the body of the article could be about the calorie
[03:28:04.460 --> 03:28:08.420]  counting cornflakes, but they would never see that.
[03:28:08.420 --> 03:28:09.420]  You're so right.
[03:28:09.420 --> 03:28:10.420]  You're so right.
[03:28:10.420 --> 03:28:12.380]  And that is the power of the media.
[03:28:12.380 --> 03:28:15.620]  That's the power of the media, even though they are losing control of the narrative.
[03:28:15.620 --> 03:28:16.900]  People are smart.
[03:28:16.900 --> 03:28:17.900]  People really are smart.
[03:28:17.900 --> 03:28:20.260]  OK, people really, really deep down are smart.
[03:28:20.260 --> 03:28:22.300]  They're just a lot of them are busy.
[03:28:22.300 --> 03:28:23.300]  They're worn down.
[03:28:23.300 --> 03:28:24.300]  They're tired.
[03:28:24.300 --> 03:28:28.820]  And they don't have time to read the 600 words in the body of the article and sometimes
[03:28:28.820 --> 03:28:31.900]  the body of the article is deceiving, too, because it'll repeat the headline and then
[03:28:31.900 --> 03:28:33.500]  it'll get down into the minutia.
[03:28:33.500 --> 03:28:38.060]  And sometimes it's not the last paragraph where you can actually read what's going on.
[03:28:38.060 --> 03:28:39.500]  But I totally hear you.
[03:28:39.500 --> 03:28:44.820]  And the funny thing is, I mean, I would discount this if it were Trump supporters saying, you
[03:28:44.820 --> 03:28:46.100]  know, doing the same thing to Hillary.
[03:28:46.100 --> 03:28:50.860]  It's just it's almost Orwellian to where it's new speak.
[03:28:50.860 --> 03:28:53.380]  You can't talk in speaking full sentences.
[03:28:53.380 --> 03:29:00.660]  You have to just scream loaded establishment PC style buzzwords and then get mad when someone
[03:29:00.660 --> 03:29:01.860]  responds to you.
[03:29:01.860 --> 03:29:05.380]  The best to me and I want to get your thoughts on this, too, before we had to break is when
[03:29:05.380 --> 03:29:09.980]  you ask someone like that intellectual question, well, what do you think about, you know, such
[03:29:09.980 --> 03:29:15.780]  and such and if you screw you, you know, you're racist, it's like whoa.
[03:29:15.780 --> 03:29:19.980]  And then get away with that, though, because they say you triggered them and they say you're
[03:29:19.980 --> 03:29:20.980]  racist.
[03:29:20.980 --> 03:29:21.980]  What do you think about that as we go to break?
[03:29:21.980 --> 03:29:22.980]  Final comment.
[03:29:22.980 --> 03:29:23.980]  I mean, exactly.
[03:29:23.980 --> 03:29:26.580]  It's very, it's the easiest thing to do now.
[03:29:26.580 --> 03:29:31.780]  I mean, that's the new thing, but, you know, maybe kind of bordering on that.
[03:29:31.780 --> 03:29:36.420]  One thing that I would like for everybody to notice is that you see these people, you
[03:29:36.420 --> 03:29:39.780]  know, they're they're probably professional students, you know what, hold your point.
[03:29:39.780 --> 03:29:40.780]  We're going to come back to you.
[03:29:40.780 --> 03:29:41.780]  We've got a head to break.
[03:29:41.780 --> 03:29:42.780]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:42.780 --> 03:29:43.780]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[03:29:43.780 --> 03:29:44.780]  Fourth hour.
[03:29:44.780 --> 03:29:47.980]  I'm Anthony Gutiarty.
[03:29:47.980 --> 03:29:49.260]  We're on the March.
[03:29:49.260 --> 03:29:51.740]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.740 --> 03:30:01.460]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network going out and protesting Islamophobia, guess what
[03:30:01.460 --> 03:30:03.020]  you've probably been looking for?
[03:30:03.020 --> 03:30:07.180]  Sharia friendly social networks for Muslims are now on the rise.
[03:30:07.180 --> 03:30:08.180]  Hurray!
[03:30:08.180 --> 03:30:10.180]  Article up by Forbes.com.
[03:30:10.180 --> 03:30:14.980]  A month ago, while attending the startup Turkey conference in Antalya, I had the chance
[03:30:14.980 --> 03:30:20.420]  to talk to Shoya Fadi, CEO and co-founder of the social networking platform.
[03:30:20.420 --> 03:30:22.180]  Now get ready, this is the best part.
[03:30:22.180 --> 03:30:23.180]  Muslim face.
[03:30:23.180 --> 03:30:27.660]  Muslim face is going to be used to help combat Islamophobia created by Donald Trump, definitely
[03:30:27.660 --> 03:30:30.900]  not created by that racist title called Muslim face.
[03:30:30.900 --> 03:30:33.060]  You look like you could probably be a member of Muslim face.
[03:30:33.060 --> 03:30:34.060]  He would have.
[03:30:34.060 --> 03:30:35.060]  What gave you that idea?
[03:30:35.060 --> 03:30:36.660]  Well, you kind of look like a Muslim.
[03:30:36.660 --> 03:30:41.940]  He was there to pitch to potential investors, his website, which also offers prayer times,
[03:30:41.940 --> 03:30:46.740]  job postings, a total locate your nearest mosque and another button to help find your
[03:30:46.740 --> 03:30:47.740]  spouse.
[03:30:47.740 --> 03:30:52.100]  If you might not be seeing the best of times to write about Islamic online content, you
[03:30:52.100 --> 03:30:54.420]  just named your website Muslim face.
[03:30:54.420 --> 03:30:55.420]  Come on, man.
[03:30:55.420 --> 03:30:58.820]  You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.
[03:30:58.820 --> 03:31:02.740]  Secret 12, Info Wars Lives, Vitamin B12 Formulation.
[03:31:02.740 --> 03:31:08.020]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[03:31:08.020 --> 03:31:09.020]  by the body.
[03:31:09.020 --> 03:31:13.740]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which
[03:31:13.740 --> 03:31:16.140]  are known to have higher absorption rates.
[03:31:16.140 --> 03:31:21.300]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful
[03:31:21.300 --> 03:31:25.500]  form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[03:31:25.500 --> 03:31:32.220]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimental grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin,
[03:31:32.220 --> 03:31:36.460]  the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[03:31:36.460 --> 03:31:39.820]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[03:31:39.820 --> 03:31:41.900]  No needles, no injections.
[03:31:41.900 --> 03:31:43.460]  Don't take my word for it.
[03:31:43.460 --> 03:31:44.900]  Try it for yourself.

[03:31:54.900 --> 03:31:56.900]  InfoWarsLife, Secret 12.
[03:31:56.900 --> 03:31:57.900]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:31:57.900 --> 03:31:58.900]  Good, brother.
[03:31:58.900 --> 03:31:59.900]  I just recently started using your products.
[03:31:59.900 --> 03:32:00.900]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:32:00.900 --> 03:32:04.900]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:32:04.900 --> 03:32:05.900]  Well, thank you, brother.
[03:32:05.900 --> 03:32:08.900]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the
[03:32:08.900 --> 03:32:09.900]  highest quality.
[03:32:09.900 --> 03:32:16.900]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[03:32:16.900 --> 03:32:17.900]  of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:32:17.900 --> 03:32:22.900]  We do the super male and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy.
[03:32:22.900 --> 03:32:27.900]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[03:32:27.900 --> 03:32:33.900]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated,
[03:32:33.900 --> 03:32:35.900]  or maximum potency.
[03:32:35.900 --> 03:32:39.900]  They want to stun and dumb down, and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a
[03:32:39.900 --> 03:32:43.900]  while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally
[03:32:43.900 --> 03:32:45.900]  going goes right to the source.
[03:32:45.900 --> 03:32:47.900]  So it's pretty exciting, and I love it.
[03:32:47.900 --> 03:32:53.900]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products
[03:32:53.900 --> 03:33:06.900]  from infowarslife.
[03:33:06.900 --> 03:33:10.900]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:33:10.900 --> 03:33:15.900]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:15.900 --> 03:33:16.900]  All right, we're back.
[03:33:16.900 --> 03:33:17.900]  It's the bottom of the hour.
[03:33:17.900 --> 03:33:18.900]  Leanne McAdoo's in here.
[03:33:18.900 --> 03:33:22.900]  She's got some really powerful news she's going to share with us in a moment.
[03:33:22.900 --> 03:33:25.900]  But first, we're going to go back to the caller who is finishing his point.
[03:33:25.900 --> 03:33:29.900]  We're going to talk about children now spend less time outside than the average prisoner.
[03:33:29.900 --> 03:33:31.900]  So they're prisoners in their own home.
[03:33:31.900 --> 03:33:35.900]  And then we wonder, gee, for 80 years, depression rates have just been skyrocketing.
[03:33:35.900 --> 03:33:36.900]  That's really absurd.
[03:33:36.900 --> 03:33:38.900]  Why are the youths so depressed?
[03:33:38.900 --> 03:33:39.900]  It just makes no sense.
[03:33:39.900 --> 03:33:40.900]  They're not going outside.
[03:33:40.900 --> 03:33:42.900]  They're having their dreams crushed.
[03:33:42.900 --> 03:33:49.900]  They're being placed into this facade where you have to go to school, get in debt, work
[03:33:49.900 --> 03:33:53.900]  a nine to five that you hate and basically pay taxes until you die.
[03:33:53.900 --> 03:33:54.900]  Why are they so depressed?
[03:33:54.900 --> 03:33:55.900]  That's so strange.
[03:33:55.900 --> 03:33:56.900]  That's so weird.
[03:33:56.900 --> 03:33:58.900]  So we're going to go to this call here in a second.
[03:33:58.900 --> 03:34:03.900]  I also like to comment that the first thing Leanne says, not just about her news, is the
[03:34:03.900 --> 03:34:06.900]  comment on my face being nice and shiny today.
[03:34:06.900 --> 03:34:09.900]  That's because I'm trying out a new product that we may be launching soon.
[03:34:09.900 --> 03:34:11.900]  It's a secret formula.
[03:34:11.900 --> 03:34:15.900]  So anyway, all right, we're going to go to Luke in Tennessee who's finishing up his point
[03:34:15.900 --> 03:34:22.900]  about the ridiculousness of the anti whatever protesters, whatever it is that they just scream
[03:34:22.900 --> 03:34:23.900]  buzzwords.
[03:34:23.900 --> 03:34:26.900]  They can't have an intellectual conversation when you talk to them, you say, well, what
[03:34:26.900 --> 03:34:28.900]  about, you know, this event or that event?
[03:34:28.900 --> 03:34:30.900]  They just say, you're a racist.
[03:34:30.900 --> 03:34:31.900]  F you.
[03:34:31.900 --> 03:34:32.900]  It's crazy.
[03:34:32.900 --> 03:34:33.900]  So Luke finishing up.
[03:34:33.900 --> 03:34:34.900]  Go ahead, Luke.
[03:34:34.900 --> 03:34:35.900]  Thanks for.
[03:34:35.900 --> 03:34:36.900]  Yes, sir.
[03:34:36.900 --> 03:34:37.900]  Can you hear me?
[03:34:37.900 --> 03:34:38.900]  Absolutely.
[03:34:38.900 --> 03:34:39.900]  Okay.
[03:34:39.900 --> 03:34:43.900]  So, so finishing up, I was thinking about it.
[03:34:43.900 --> 03:34:47.900]  You know, in the, like the big shopping malls, the franchise malls all throughout the United
[03:34:47.900 --> 03:34:52.700]  States, maybe like a Simon mall, for example, you see these signs that says do not group
[03:34:52.700 --> 03:34:54.900]  up in larger than five or six people.
[03:34:54.900 --> 03:34:55.900]  Have you seen those?
[03:34:55.900 --> 03:34:56.900]  Yeah, I have not.
[03:34:56.900 --> 03:34:58.900]  But, but I believe you go ahead.
[03:34:58.900 --> 03:35:04.900]  So the reason they do that is so gang of people are not, not racially speaking, just speaking
[03:35:04.900 --> 03:35:05.900]  in general.
[03:35:05.900 --> 03:35:06.900]  They know how.
[03:35:06.900 --> 03:35:07.900]  How destructive.
[03:35:07.900 --> 03:35:09.900]  Let me stop you right there.
[03:35:09.900 --> 03:35:10.900]  Hold on.
[03:35:10.900 --> 03:35:11.900]  Hold on.
[03:35:11.900 --> 03:35:12.900]  Hold on.
[03:35:12.900 --> 03:35:18.900]  I forgot a sense of the verbal domination because you said gangs and you said not racially.
[03:35:18.900 --> 03:35:19.900]  Right.
[03:35:19.900 --> 03:35:21.500]  Because think about that for a minute.
[03:35:21.500 --> 03:35:22.500]  I was an employee.
[03:35:22.500 --> 03:35:26.020]  I don't think you're employing any type of race in this, but it's just like we're told
[03:35:26.020 --> 03:35:28.740]  band-aids are racist and white privilege.
[03:35:28.740 --> 03:35:31.900]  The funny thing to me is I'm not racist.
[03:35:31.900 --> 03:35:33.540]  I'm not sexist.
[03:35:33.540 --> 03:35:35.540]  I am about human empowerment.
[03:35:35.540 --> 03:35:38.740]  I genuinely want everyone to succeed.
[03:35:38.740 --> 03:35:40.780]  I do not think in those ways.
[03:35:40.780 --> 03:35:44.940]  But the problem is when you take children and you have them sit down, you say, you see
[03:35:44.940 --> 03:35:46.180]  this is a black person.
[03:35:46.180 --> 03:35:47.180]  This is a white person.
[03:35:47.180 --> 03:35:48.180]  This is a male.
[03:35:48.180 --> 03:35:49.180]  This is a female.
[03:35:49.180 --> 03:35:50.180]  They're different, but they're not.
[03:35:50.180 --> 03:35:51.180]  Okay.
[03:35:51.180 --> 03:35:52.180]  And if you think they're different, you're bad.
[03:35:52.180 --> 03:35:53.180]  They're the same.
[03:35:53.180 --> 03:35:54.180]  You got it.
[03:35:54.180 --> 03:35:55.180]  But they look different.
[03:35:55.180 --> 03:35:56.180]  And you got to like that.
[03:35:56.180 --> 03:35:57.180]  And they're like, wait, what?
[03:35:57.180 --> 03:35:58.180]  I didn't even think about this.
[03:35:58.180 --> 03:35:59.180]  My friend has different color skin.
[03:35:59.180 --> 03:36:00.180]  I didn't even think about it.
[03:36:00.180 --> 03:36:03.780]  Or my friend is, you know, my friend is a female and they're like, well, those are
[03:36:03.780 --> 03:36:04.780]  females.
[03:36:04.780 --> 03:36:05.780]  They're different.
[03:36:05.780 --> 03:36:06.780]  But you better not think they are.
[03:36:06.780 --> 03:36:07.780]  And you're like, wait, what?
[03:36:07.780 --> 03:36:08.780]  What?
[03:36:08.780 --> 03:36:11.780]  I'm not going to be equal until you try to wear my culture's hairstyle and it's like
[03:36:11.780 --> 03:36:12.780]  it.
[03:36:12.780 --> 03:36:13.780]  Attack you.
[03:36:13.780 --> 03:36:14.780]  Yeah.
[03:36:14.780 --> 03:36:15.780]  It's like maybe we're having a discussion with Leanne and I'm like, yeah, I was hanging
[03:36:15.780 --> 03:36:17.780]  out with my friend.
[03:36:17.780 --> 03:36:19.580]  You know, and she, but not in a sexist way.
[03:36:19.580 --> 03:36:20.580]  Like she's just not.
[03:36:20.580 --> 03:36:21.780]  You know, it's like, it's just a friend.
[03:36:21.780 --> 03:36:22.780]  It's just a friend.
[03:36:22.780 --> 03:36:26.380]  Like, uh, like we've already all, we've all been brainwashed.
[03:36:26.380 --> 03:36:28.420]  We all police our language.
[03:36:28.420 --> 03:36:31.860]  It's absurd because I know that you didn't meet it in that sense.
[03:36:31.860 --> 03:36:34.220]  And it's kind of like it's been said before.
[03:36:34.220 --> 03:36:36.380]  This isn't my analogy, but it's a beautiful one.
[03:36:36.380 --> 03:36:39.460]  If you're out in the middle of nowhere and you're driving your car and there's a stop
[03:36:39.460 --> 03:36:40.460]  sign.
[03:36:40.460 --> 03:36:41.460]  Okay.
[03:36:41.460 --> 03:36:43.260]  I'm not telling you to break the law.
[03:36:43.260 --> 03:36:44.260]  No.
[03:36:44.260 --> 03:36:47.060]  But if you were to just blitz through that stop sign, you know, it's totally safe.
[03:36:47.060 --> 03:36:48.980]  You feel something go in the bottom of your gut.
[03:36:48.980 --> 03:36:49.980]  Don't you?
[03:36:49.980 --> 03:36:52.980]  Every time you break the law, you feel something like, oh, like a control, right?
[03:36:52.980 --> 03:36:54.540]  Like a fear.
[03:36:54.540 --> 03:36:58.380]  That is an invisible domination and I'm not saying you should break the law.
[03:36:58.380 --> 03:36:59.380]  I'm not saying it's bad.
[03:36:59.380 --> 03:37:04.260]  I'm just saying that it's, it's, it's a form of control over you.
[03:37:04.260 --> 03:37:07.260]  You've been brought up your entire life that doing that is bad.
[03:37:07.260 --> 03:37:10.340]  So now the new form of control is you better not be racist.
[03:37:10.340 --> 03:37:11.340]  You better not be sexist.
[03:37:11.340 --> 03:37:12.340]  You better not be intolerant.
[03:37:12.340 --> 03:37:13.700]  You better not be a bigot or whatever.
[03:37:13.700 --> 03:37:18.540]  So we are spending a percentage of our ability, our capacity to express ourselves policing
[03:37:18.540 --> 03:37:19.540]  ourselves.
[03:37:19.540 --> 03:37:20.940]  That's never happened before.
[03:37:20.940 --> 03:37:27.980]  We are literally policing ourselves for these psychological weird control freaks instead
[03:37:27.980 --> 03:37:29.180]  of them doing it for us.
[03:37:29.180 --> 03:37:30.180]  Isn't that is insane?
[03:37:30.180 --> 03:37:34.380]  It is because you end up with some kind of robot.
[03:37:34.380 --> 03:37:35.380]  Yes.
[03:37:35.380 --> 03:37:37.980]  Just exactly what's on the fly up there.
[03:37:37.980 --> 03:37:42.980]  You're dealing with some sort of robot because they're not allowed to, they're not allowed
[03:37:42.980 --> 03:37:46.700]  to even express themselves, their own value.
[03:37:46.700 --> 03:37:47.700]  Absolutely.
[03:37:47.700 --> 03:37:48.700]  There you have it.
[03:37:48.700 --> 03:37:49.700]  Luke, thank you for your call.
[03:37:49.700 --> 03:37:50.700]  What a great caller.
[03:37:50.700 --> 03:37:51.700]  You know why?
[03:37:51.700 --> 03:37:54.860]  Also, it's interesting because he put on there, he's a Democrat voting for Trump.
[03:37:54.860 --> 03:38:00.140]  And you know, I wouldn't, I'm definitely not a Democrat, but it's interesting to me.
[03:38:00.140 --> 03:38:01.620]  I'm from Philadelphia, okay?
[03:38:01.620 --> 03:38:06.460]  I'm from a city where guns are the boogeyman, you know, guns are evil.
[03:38:06.460 --> 03:38:09.540]  If you even saw a gun, it's like, oh my word, right?
[03:38:09.540 --> 03:38:14.060]  I'm from a city where if you weren't a Democrat at any high level, you were pretty much, you
[03:38:14.060 --> 03:38:15.060]  know, pushed away.
[03:38:15.060 --> 03:38:17.980]  And it's funny because I'm not, you know, a conservative.
[03:38:17.980 --> 03:38:23.180]  I'm just an open, ideologically open individual that looks for common sense on the third
[03:38:23.180 --> 03:38:24.180]  party of reality.
[03:38:24.180 --> 03:38:25.180]  Right?
[03:38:25.180 --> 03:38:26.500]  And I think that's what we all should be.
[03:38:26.500 --> 03:38:30.380]  And it's interesting to me when you can't label something to dominate it because we
[03:38:30.380 --> 03:38:32.380]  use labels as a form of domination, right?
[03:38:32.380 --> 03:38:36.420]  So let's say we're having a discussion right now and you're presenting me with an ideology
[03:38:36.420 --> 03:38:37.420]  that I don't agree with.
[03:38:37.420 --> 03:38:38.780]  I could just say, oh, are you a conservative?
[03:38:38.780 --> 03:38:41.900]  If you were to say yes, I could say, oh, I could just dismiss you right away.
[03:38:41.900 --> 03:38:46.060]  We just label everything we don't understand and try to put it in a box so we understand
[03:38:46.060 --> 03:38:47.060]  it.
[03:38:47.060 --> 03:38:50.300]  And then once we understand it, we can pass judgment on it and push it out the window.
[03:38:50.300 --> 03:38:51.300]  Right.
[03:38:51.300 --> 03:38:52.460]  So it's actually a form of control.
[03:38:52.460 --> 03:38:53.460]  Listening and...
[03:38:53.460 --> 03:38:54.460]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:38:54.460 --> 03:38:56.820]  Once we label something, then it's bad, and then we can get rid of it.
[03:38:56.820 --> 03:38:57.820]  Right.
[03:38:57.820 --> 03:38:59.740]  Which is why, you know, it's interesting we have a lot of people saying, well, why aren't
[03:38:59.740 --> 03:39:01.820]  you for Bernie Sanders?
[03:39:01.820 --> 03:39:05.540]  And a lot of us do agree with a lot of the things that he's saying, and we get it, why
[03:39:05.540 --> 03:39:07.580]  people are so supportive of his message.
[03:39:07.580 --> 03:39:08.580]  But that's...
[03:39:08.580 --> 03:39:14.140]  The point is you have to engage those people as well to have them expand on the economy
[03:39:14.140 --> 03:39:16.020]  and how that may or may not work.
[03:39:16.020 --> 03:39:17.020]  And it's not...
[03:39:17.020 --> 03:39:20.380]  It sounds really good in theory, but how are you going to make it work?
[03:39:20.380 --> 03:39:22.340]  And that's where it falls short.
[03:39:22.340 --> 03:39:23.340]  Exactly.
[03:39:23.340 --> 03:39:27.540]  And I support a lot of the things that Bernie Sanders is for, and I think most of the listeners
[03:39:27.540 --> 03:39:28.540]  what do.
[03:39:28.540 --> 03:39:29.540]  He's against the NSA spying.
[03:39:29.540 --> 03:39:30.540]  Right.
[03:39:30.540 --> 03:39:31.540]  He's against a lot of...
[03:39:31.540 --> 03:39:33.940]  Big things take over the economy and...
[03:39:33.940 --> 03:39:34.940]  Exactly.
[03:39:34.940 --> 03:39:36.260]  He's for a lot of good things.
[03:39:36.260 --> 03:39:40.100]  It's just when you get down the rabbit hole and you look at his policy and you say, oh,
[03:39:40.100 --> 03:39:42.780]  okay, 90% tax, not a big fan of that.
[03:39:42.780 --> 03:39:43.940]  But anyway, let's get into some...
[03:39:43.940 --> 03:39:47.740]  Also, too, the fact if you can just have two girls get up on a podium and shut down your
[03:39:47.740 --> 03:39:53.300]  whole speech, I am not really confident in how you're going to run the country.
[03:39:53.300 --> 03:39:58.700]  And be able to stand down against something much more scary than two young women.
[03:39:58.700 --> 03:40:00.260]  I think you're being sexist, Leanne.
[03:40:00.260 --> 03:40:01.260]  You're right.
[03:40:01.260 --> 03:40:03.820]  So, all right, let's talk about some news, and you've got some news, too.
[03:40:03.820 --> 03:40:08.060]  So I want you to open up with some of that here in a second, but just to blitz through
[03:40:08.060 --> 03:40:09.060]  some.
[03:40:09.060 --> 03:40:12.100]  And we're also going to play a very interesting video from Jakarii Jackson at some point
[03:40:12.100 --> 03:40:13.820]  in this segment, most likely.
[03:40:13.820 --> 03:40:15.980]  So this is a big one.
[03:40:15.980 --> 03:40:17.660]  Court condemns use of Stingray devices.
[03:40:17.660 --> 03:40:22.540]  I don't know if you guys are familiar with that, but basically it's a device that they
[03:40:22.540 --> 03:40:27.460]  can, without a warrant, go into your phone, take all of your texts, all of your calls,
[03:40:27.460 --> 03:40:29.380]  and monitor everything.
[03:40:29.380 --> 03:40:30.900]  And this is big news.
[03:40:30.900 --> 03:40:34.780]  In a decision that could have far-ranging implications for Americans' privacy protection
[03:40:34.780 --> 03:40:42.500]  from law enforcement, an appellate court has, for the first time, I'm so stupid, I didn't
[03:40:42.500 --> 03:40:47.660]  know a word, ruled strongly against the use of controversial Stingray devices that covertly
[03:40:47.660 --> 03:40:50.060]  tracks and sell your devices.
[03:40:50.060 --> 03:40:54.580]  So in other words, the police department may not have the ability to look at every single
[03:40:54.580 --> 03:40:56.780]  thing you're doing with how to warrant anymore.
[03:40:56.780 --> 03:40:58.500]  If this continues further on.
[03:40:58.500 --> 03:41:00.100]  Some pesky little constitution.
[03:41:00.100 --> 03:41:02.020]  Now, are you a vegetarian?
[03:41:02.020 --> 03:41:03.020]  Mostly yes.
[03:41:03.020 --> 03:41:04.020]  Okay.
[03:41:04.020 --> 03:41:06.620]  So here's an interesting piece that was mentioned the other day, too.
[03:41:06.620 --> 03:41:07.620]  Are we what we eat?
[03:41:07.620 --> 03:41:13.840]  And this is about a study from Cornell University, and they found gene mutations.
[03:41:13.840 --> 03:41:18.180]  So they said, a new evolutionary proof of an old adage, we are what we eat.
[03:41:18.180 --> 03:41:23.100]  Cornell University scientists have found tantalizing evidence that a vegetarian diet has led to
[03:41:23.100 --> 03:41:28.260]  a mutation that if they stray from balanced omega-6 to omega-3 diet, may make people
[03:41:28.260 --> 03:41:33.260]  more susceptible to inflammation and, by association, increase risk of heart disease
[03:41:33.260 --> 03:41:34.260]  and colon cancer.
[03:41:34.260 --> 03:41:37.980]  So in other words, being a vegetarian long-term can increase your risk of these things.
[03:41:37.980 --> 03:41:38.980]  Right.
[03:41:38.980 --> 03:41:40.380]  There are certain things that will cause inflammation.
[03:41:40.380 --> 03:41:42.380]  Well, I've got my opinion on this.
[03:41:42.380 --> 03:41:43.900]  As a vegetarian, what do you think?
[03:41:43.900 --> 03:41:49.460]  Well, I mean, I'm not a strict vegetarian, I do eat seafood sometimes, at least twice
[03:41:49.460 --> 03:41:55.340]  a week, because of the fact that I don't feel nourished, and I don't think I get enough
[03:41:55.340 --> 03:41:58.900]  amino acids and things like that, unless I'm doing brags or something.
[03:41:58.900 --> 03:42:05.940]  It's pretty hard to be a very healthy vegetarian, especially with the way that the micronutrients
[03:42:05.940 --> 03:42:08.220]  have been taken out of the soil in general.
[03:42:08.220 --> 03:42:12.140]  So even there, you're getting a depletion of the vitamins and minerals, even if you
[03:42:12.140 --> 03:42:16.820]  are eating vegetables, simply because the soil, the mineral content in the soil is so
[03:42:16.820 --> 03:42:17.820]  poor.
[03:42:17.820 --> 03:42:18.820]  I think the study is too generalized.
[03:42:18.820 --> 03:42:19.820]  Well, they all...
[03:42:19.820 --> 03:42:20.820]  I think if you're comparing...
[03:42:20.820 --> 03:42:25.260]  I think there's a million studies about everything that argue with each other, but...
[03:42:25.260 --> 03:42:26.260]  On the other hand...
[03:42:26.260 --> 03:42:29.780]  If you're comparing vegetarians versus non-vegetarians, you have to look at what type of things they're
[03:42:29.780 --> 03:42:30.780]  eating.
[03:42:30.780 --> 03:42:34.580]  I mean, meat, you're eating crappy processed meat with a million different...
[03:42:34.580 --> 03:42:35.580]  Antibiotics, minerals...
[03:42:35.580 --> 03:42:38.980] ...preservatives, chemicals, preservatives, yeah, you name it, it's gonna be a lot different
[03:42:38.980 --> 03:42:43.340]  than someone that's killing the chicken themselves, and then conversely, if you're looking at vegetarians,
[03:42:43.340 --> 03:42:44.340]  you know how many vegetarians I know?
[03:42:44.340 --> 03:42:48.260]  They're like, oh, I don't eat meat, and then they go home and eat like Domino's Pizza?
[03:42:48.260 --> 03:42:49.260]  Yeah.
[03:42:49.260 --> 03:42:54.940]  Or meat substitutes that are just like gluten and sodium and all these...
[03:42:54.940 --> 03:43:01.260]  It's like a cardboard meat substitute, or mac and cheese, and that's their vegetarian...
[03:43:01.260 --> 03:43:02.260]  Exactly.
[03:43:02.260 --> 03:43:04.860]  So yeah, I mean, you can be unhealthy on both sides of the spectrum.
[03:43:04.860 --> 03:43:05.860]  Exactly.
[03:43:05.860 --> 03:43:06.860]  And I think everyone's different.
[03:43:06.860 --> 03:43:08.100]  For me, I've tried to eat a vegetarian diet.
[03:43:08.100 --> 03:43:09.100]  I've tried it for months.
[03:43:09.100 --> 03:43:10.100]  It didn't work for me.
[03:43:10.100 --> 03:43:11.100]  I think everyone's a little bit different.
[03:43:11.100 --> 03:43:12.100]  It's almost...
[03:43:12.100 --> 03:43:13.100]  Oh, possibly...
[03:43:13.100 --> 03:43:16.700]  I think being ethical about it is what's the key for me.
[03:43:16.700 --> 03:43:21.940]  But on the flip side of that, I've got this article about how much exercise does it really
[03:43:21.940 --> 03:43:27.620]  take to burn off something like a Big Mac, and a Big Mac with large fries, Coca-Cola,
[03:43:27.620 --> 03:43:32.380]  which is more than all of your daily intake for calories.
[03:43:32.380 --> 03:43:37.540]  I mean, the bare minimum you'd have to do is two and a half hours of cardio, biking,
[03:43:37.540 --> 03:43:38.540]  running, and...
[03:43:38.540 --> 03:43:39.540]  Worth it, right?
[03:43:39.540 --> 03:43:44.260]  Nobody really does that unless you're kind of obsessed with working out, like per day.
[03:43:44.260 --> 03:43:49.220]  And also, I think it's so important to understand, sure, you're going to maybe burn those calories
[03:43:49.220 --> 03:43:54.020]  off, but you know what you can't burn off is all the crap that you're eating, the fillers,
[03:43:54.020 --> 03:43:55.420]  the ingredients, the...
[03:43:55.420 --> 03:43:59.460]  If you have an issue with genetically modified organisms or all the stuff in there, the various
[03:43:59.460 --> 03:44:02.460]  chemical substances that you're consuming, you're not going to burn that off, right?
[03:44:02.460 --> 03:44:03.460]  You're not going to deadlift that out.
[03:44:03.460 --> 03:44:06.420]  Exactly, because your body doesn't know what to do with it, and that is the key with the
[03:44:06.420 --> 03:44:09.940]  whole, we are what we eat, because you really are what you eat.
[03:44:09.940 --> 03:44:11.460]  You're feeding your cells.
[03:44:11.460 --> 03:44:18.340]  So if you're feeding your cells, dead animals or fake process things that it's a chemical
[03:44:18.340 --> 03:44:19.340]  created lab.
[03:44:19.340 --> 03:44:20.340]  What's funny is most of it's not even meat.
[03:44:20.340 --> 03:44:24.940]  Actually, I was saying one time I said McDonald's should label some of their things like chicken
[03:44:24.940 --> 03:44:28.860]  nuggets vegetarian, because it's mostly not even real meat.
[03:44:28.860 --> 03:44:33.300]  And by the Cornell study, are we what we eat, which is what we talked about earlier, I mean,
[03:44:33.300 --> 03:44:37.740]  if you're eating that, then it's basically saying, if you're a vegetarian, there's a
[03:44:37.740 --> 03:44:41.940]  concern, imagine if we apply what we eat to eating McDonald's.
[03:44:41.940 --> 03:44:42.940]  Process food.
[03:44:42.940 --> 03:44:43.940]  Eating total junk.
[03:44:43.940 --> 03:44:46.820]  Nothing but those things that are stored on the shelf.
[03:44:46.820 --> 03:44:47.820]  Exactly.
[03:44:47.820 --> 03:44:48.820]  So what else you got, Leanne?
[03:44:48.820 --> 03:44:50.100]  You said you have some interesting news for us today.
[03:44:50.100 --> 03:44:52.980]  Well, on that note, I just thought this was interesting.
[03:44:52.980 --> 03:44:56.060]  There's a 78-year-old Jim Junkie grandma.
[03:44:56.060 --> 03:44:59.260]  She can deadlift 245 pounds.
[03:44:59.260 --> 03:45:06.860]  So she's a member of club fitness, and she's also one of these competing in these competitions.
[03:45:06.860 --> 03:45:11.980]  So people have no excuse to not get out there and take care of themselves and do something.
[03:45:11.980 --> 03:45:15.780]  I mean, she's lifting more than 180-pound men could lift.
[03:45:15.780 --> 03:45:17.700]  I certainly can't deadlift.
[03:45:17.700 --> 03:45:19.540]  She's not being suppressed by sexism.
[03:45:19.540 --> 03:45:20.540]  Yeah.
[03:45:20.540 --> 03:45:25.140]  No, she's just out there, but no matter what age you are, you can do something proactive
[03:45:25.140 --> 03:45:28.700]  and take care of your health, which I think is pretty cool.
[03:45:28.700 --> 03:45:33.940]  On the flip side of that, I will say I have been seeing a lot of articles lately praising
[03:45:33.940 --> 03:45:40.500]  anorexic women that are going from anorexia, and then they become these bodybuilding competitors.
[03:45:40.500 --> 03:45:42.100]  And you think, well, that's great.
[03:45:42.100 --> 03:45:48.300]  Now they're being very healthy, but they're sort of trading one extreme food and diet for
[03:45:48.300 --> 03:45:49.300]  another.
[03:45:49.300 --> 03:45:54.100]  Well, you know what's funny about all that really sad stuff is that they attack people.
[03:45:54.100 --> 03:46:00.820]  There was that huge problem with the protein company that used a model woman to promote
[03:46:00.820 --> 03:46:03.980]  their protein or whatever, saying it had unrealistic standards, right?
[03:46:03.980 --> 03:46:08.300]  But the real problem is, OK, the celebrity culture, why does no one talk about that?
[03:46:08.300 --> 03:46:13.100]  They talk about how there's sexism, the band-aids are offending people, women are actually being
[03:46:13.100 --> 03:46:17.940]  drove into anorexia because they watch the media culture, which is the establishment
[03:46:17.940 --> 03:46:22.140]  culture, which acts like they back the social justice warrior system, but then it's showing
[03:46:22.140 --> 03:46:27.500]  all of the models as like 100-pound goddesses with abs and they're like, yes, get rid of
[03:46:27.500 --> 03:46:28.500]  the patriarch.
[03:46:28.500 --> 03:46:29.500]  Yeah.
[03:46:29.500 --> 03:46:31.620]  Meanwhile, they're being driven to anorexia because they watch all that stuff, but then
[03:46:31.620 --> 03:46:37.700]  the same media groups get behind the social justice warrior ideology and say, yes, it's
[03:46:37.700 --> 03:46:41.700]  your fault, people that are supporting anything.
[03:46:41.700 --> 03:46:42.700]  It's Trump supporters fault.
[03:46:42.700 --> 03:46:44.900]  It's totally absurd.
[03:46:44.900 --> 03:46:49.380]  No, I think that's something that a lot of people really need to pay attention to because
[03:46:49.380 --> 03:46:54.180]  I know there's actually a girl at my gym that I want to go and talk to this girl and
[03:46:54.180 --> 03:47:00.860]  that I don't really know her, but she is clearly anorexic, but now she is like a bodybuilding
[03:47:00.860 --> 03:47:02.300]  at the same time.
[03:47:02.300 --> 03:47:08.940]  And so there is this sort of a culture on Instagram where people will take pictures and they're
[03:47:08.940 --> 03:47:10.940]  ripped and they got a six pack and everything.
[03:47:10.940 --> 03:47:14.420]  But obviously we all know the old adage that the camera adds 10 pounds.
[03:47:14.420 --> 03:47:18.660]  So you can't tell by looking at these girls that they're actually real thin.
[03:47:18.660 --> 03:47:22.460]  And the reason why you can see all of their muscles is because they're not eating properly.
[03:47:22.460 --> 03:47:23.460]  It's just one addiction.
[03:47:23.460 --> 03:47:24.460]  Yeah.
[03:47:24.460 --> 03:47:25.460]  It's really frightening.
[03:47:25.460 --> 03:47:29.140]  So I would, you know, I hope people kind of, because anorexia is one of those diseases
[03:47:29.140 --> 03:47:35.060]  that it's a silent disease and people need to be able to speak out about that unhealthy
[03:47:35.060 --> 03:47:38.460]  way that, you know, women are, are treating themselves.
[03:47:38.460 --> 03:47:39.460]  Absolutely.
[03:47:39.460 --> 03:47:41.100]  We don't have time to play the jacari report, do we?
[03:47:41.100 --> 03:47:43.580]  But we probably have time for the Watson report.
[03:47:43.580 --> 03:47:45.460]  Guys, do you think?
[03:47:45.460 --> 03:47:46.460]  Awesome.
[03:47:46.460 --> 03:47:47.860]  We're going to check that out for a second.
[03:47:47.860 --> 03:47:51.100]  And then we might go to this report by Watson because I wanted to play it.
[03:47:51.100 --> 03:47:53.940]  It's interesting about this whole Michelle Fields assault stuff because no one knows
[03:47:53.940 --> 03:47:58.700]  the clear picture of what actually went down, but Watson always does these amazing The Truth
[03:47:58.700 --> 03:48:00.220]  About Blank video.
[03:48:00.220 --> 03:48:02.660]  So he's going to break down the truth about the Michelle Fields assault.
[03:48:02.660 --> 03:48:03.900]  Let's go ahead and watch that video.
[03:48:03.900 --> 03:48:09.780]  The truth about the supposed battery of Breitbart journalist Michelle Fields by Trump campaign
[03:48:09.780 --> 03:48:18.300]  manager Corey Lewandowski is that Fields, Lewandowski and supporters of both are all lying about
[03:48:18.300 --> 03:48:19.300]  what happened.
[03:48:19.300 --> 03:48:24.500]  Today, it was confirmed that Lewandowski had been charged with misdemeanor battery for
[03:48:24.500 --> 03:48:29.300]  an incident earlier this month when Lewandowski appeared to grab Fields' arm to prevent her
[03:48:29.300 --> 03:48:31.740]  from asking Trump a question.
[03:48:31.740 --> 03:48:36.900]  A new surveillance video released by police shows Lewandowski yanking Fields back by the
[03:48:36.900 --> 03:48:37.900]  arm.
[03:48:37.900 --> 03:48:43.720]  First of all, why are Fields supporters pretending like this is the first time we've seen video
[03:48:43.720 --> 03:48:45.420]  of this incident?
[03:48:45.420 --> 03:48:51.500]  This video of the incident was released weeks ago, yet was largely glossed over by the media
[03:48:51.500 --> 03:48:56.420]  because it contradicted Fields' characterization of what happened.
[03:48:56.420 --> 03:49:01.500]  Michelle Fields lied about the incident from the start.
[03:49:01.500 --> 03:49:08.340]  She claimed quote, somebody had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down.
[03:49:08.340 --> 03:49:15.260]  The video footage clearly shows that she was pulled back, not yanked down.
[03:49:15.260 --> 03:49:21.580]  Fields said quote, I almost fell to the ground but was able to maintain my balance.
[03:49:21.580 --> 03:49:27.100]  The video footage clearly shows she did not almost fall to the ground.
[03:49:27.100 --> 03:49:33.980]  She also claims that Lewandowski quote, aggressively tried to pull me to the ground.
[03:49:33.980 --> 03:49:37.740]  The video clearly shows that's not what happened.
[03:49:37.740 --> 03:49:41.860]  She also went on television claiming that this was the worst thing to happen to her
[03:49:41.860 --> 03:49:45.740]  in her entire life, apart from her father dying.
[03:49:45.740 --> 03:49:48.260]  Well, it feels awful.
[03:49:48.260 --> 03:49:52.580]  This has to be, aside from my father's death, the worst experience I've gone through.
[03:49:52.580 --> 03:50:01.180]  Unless Fields has lived a near perfect utopian life, that's obviously a massive exaggeration.
[03:50:01.180 --> 03:50:06.580]  Despite the fact that Fields was obviously completely mischaracterizing the incident,
[03:50:06.580 --> 03:50:12.460]  the media bolstered her credibility because it synced with their narrative of demonizing
[03:50:12.460 --> 03:50:19.620]  Trump, his staffers and his supporters as unhinged violent extremists.
[03:50:19.620 --> 03:50:24.940]  Fields told Fields that she fell back, but caught herself from falling.
[03:50:24.940 --> 03:50:29.060]  The video clearly shows she did not fall back.
[03:50:29.060 --> 03:50:34.060]  Alright, there you go, there's the video from Paul Joseph Watson up on his YouTube account
[03:50:34.060 --> 03:50:35.060]  and on Infowars.com.
[03:50:35.060 --> 03:50:41.060]  We'll be right back with some more news and perhaps something very interesting from Leigh-Anne.
[03:50:41.060 --> 03:50:44.300]  This is the fourth hour of The Outstanding Show, this is Anthony Gucciardi with Leigh-Anne
[03:50:44.300 --> 03:50:59.580]  McNeil, we'll be right back.
[03:50:59.580 --> 03:51:04.980]  My name is Don Whisken and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was
[03:51:04.980 --> 03:51:08.340]  told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:08.340 --> 03:51:09.620]  What did I do?
[03:51:09.620 --> 03:51:15.860]  I created Extendivite, a garlic and cayenne mix of 7 herbs which rebuilt my heart and
[03:51:15.860 --> 03:51:17.700]  gave me back my life.
[03:51:17.700 --> 03:51:24.620]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you, so you don't have to suffer
[03:51:24.620 --> 03:51:26.860]  the same thing I did.
[03:51:26.860 --> 03:51:31.700]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:31.700 --> 03:51:35.500]  I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.
[03:51:35.500 --> 03:51:48.380]  To get your Extendivite call 1-877-928-8822 that's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:48.380 --> 03:52:01.500]  Extendivite is only $69.95 for a two month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:52:01.500 --> 03:52:05.980]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a select quote agent with a true story of how select quote goes
[03:52:05.980 --> 03:52:08.940]  to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[03:52:08.940 --> 03:52:12.660]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:52:12.660 --> 03:52:16.860]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:52:16.860 --> 03:52:18.500]  I said, let me see.
[03:52:18.500 --> 03:52:23.260]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated, price competitive
[03:52:23.260 --> 03:52:29.380]  companies we represent and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been
[03:52:29.380 --> 03:52:30.380]  quoted.
[03:52:30.380 --> 03:52:32.300]  It seems to term life insurance.
[03:52:32.300 --> 03:52:38.460]  No other company touches select quotes, experience and expertise in finding the right policy
[03:52:38.460 --> 03:52:42.020]  at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:52:42.020 --> 03:52:43.020]  How about you?

[03:53:59.820 --> 03:54:13.780]  And, you know, it's actually my fault that I failed to mention to you that vitamin mineral
[03:54:13.780 --> 03:54:19.340]  fusion, which is, in my view, the most highly advanced multivitamin powder drink mix that's
[03:54:19.340 --> 03:54:21.700]  on the market, is on InfowarsLife.com.
[03:54:21.700 --> 03:54:27.260]  It's new, it just came out yesterday, and by the estimations that I was just given, it's
[03:54:27.260 --> 03:54:31.140]  probably going to sell out within one week, potentially by the weekend.
[03:54:31.140 --> 03:54:35.180]  So I'm not sure when it's going to sell out, but now is the time to go on InfowarsLife.com
[03:54:35.180 --> 03:54:39.260]  and get your canister of vitamin mineral fusion.
[03:54:39.260 --> 03:54:46.100]  So actually, right here, the difference between this and what you might find if you use, let's
[03:54:46.100 --> 03:54:50.540]  say, go to a store or you look online and check out some of the products is this doesn't
[03:54:50.540 --> 03:54:58.220]  just have vitamins that you need, like vitamin C, E, D. It has a whole laundry list of things
[03:54:58.220 --> 03:55:04.180]  like amino acids and minerals, biotin, all-in-plant derived forms or highly advanced lab forms.
[03:55:04.180 --> 03:55:10.260]  And it's sweetened with xylitol, it's called xivia, and it's a patented form of xylitol
[03:55:10.260 --> 03:55:13.220]  that helps protect the teeth, helps to fight cavities.
[03:55:13.220 --> 03:55:17.460]  It's not sugar, it's not fructose, it's the real deal, it tastes great.
[03:55:17.460 --> 03:55:19.260]  Give it a shot, try it.
[03:55:19.260 --> 03:55:20.980]  It's pretty affordable at InfowarsLife.com.
[03:55:20.980 --> 03:55:24.460]  I'll just tell you what you think, put it up there on the reviews, and you can also
[03:55:24.460 --> 03:55:28.300]  read the reviews for yourself on all the other products, like survival shield X2, super
[03:55:28.300 --> 03:55:30.100]  mild vitality, InfowarsLife.com.
[03:55:30.100 --> 03:55:34.860]  Now, Leanne, what you're going to talk about tonight on the Infowars Nightly News?
[03:55:34.860 --> 03:55:39.300]  Well, we're going to kind of break down all of the rumors of this potential nuclear attack
[03:55:39.300 --> 03:55:45.820]  by ISIS and just talk about, it's very interesting that there is a lot of discussion about nuclear
[03:55:45.820 --> 03:55:52.020]  warheads in China, North Korea, but as well, just about last year, they reported there
[03:55:52.020 --> 03:55:57.300]  was a strange, mysterious break-in at a nuclear facility in the United States, and they reported
[03:55:57.300 --> 03:56:01.740]  on it maybe for a couple days, and then it just completely went away.
[03:56:01.740 --> 03:56:08.260]  And then, of course, the U.S. and the U.K. are doing a cyber drill to test the cyber
[03:56:08.260 --> 03:56:12.700]  capabilities of an attack on a nuclear facility, so it's pretty interesting.
[03:56:12.700 --> 03:56:18.060]  Also about the subversive takeover of our election as well through our schools.
[03:56:18.060 --> 03:56:22.300]  So David Knight will be breaking that down with me, but I wanted to go ahead and challenge
[03:56:22.300 --> 03:56:28.180]  you, Anthony Gucciardi, to an experience that I would like to do.
[03:56:28.180 --> 03:56:32.100]  You know, I've been on this kind of health kick and like self-improvement.
[03:56:32.100 --> 03:56:34.260]  One thing that I cannot do is meditate.
[03:56:34.260 --> 03:56:38.780]  I just can't, my brain is always going a million miles, so something that's supposed
[03:56:38.780 --> 03:56:45.140]  to really help you with that is sensory deprivation tanks, flotation pools.
[03:56:45.140 --> 03:56:50.620]  What the salt is matching to your body content in the water is the same temperature as your
[03:56:50.620 --> 03:56:54.340]  body, so you kind of don't feel anything, you're floating in an enclosed tank and there's
[03:56:54.340 --> 03:56:55.340]  no light.
[03:56:55.340 --> 03:57:00.460]  There's no light, there's no sound, you're just, you're basically suspended in the air
[03:57:00.460 --> 03:57:04.340]  is what you feel like, you're floating through space, and apparently this is one of the best
[03:57:04.340 --> 03:57:09.340]  ways to help you reach that stillness.
[03:57:09.340 --> 03:57:11.780]  There's tons of people that say it's amazing, Joe Rogan loves it.
[03:57:11.780 --> 03:57:16.860]  Yeah, well I want to go and do a report on it and see how it really is, and you know,
[03:57:16.860 --> 03:57:18.540]  I know you're kind of into that stuff.
[03:57:18.540 --> 03:57:23.380]  I will do one with you, challenge accepted, we will go into a sensory deprivation tank
[03:57:23.380 --> 03:57:25.860]  and find the meaning of life.
[03:57:25.860 --> 03:57:26.860]  Hopefully.
[03:57:26.860 --> 03:57:30.020]  So I've been meaning to do one, I actually bought a couple credits to a place and didn't
[03:57:30.020 --> 03:57:31.020]  go.
[03:57:31.020 --> 03:57:32.020]  Very interesting stuff.
[03:57:32.020 --> 03:57:37.620]  What I get to are states to dissolve cancer funds accused of misusing funds, it's just
[03:57:37.620 --> 03:57:41.420]  been, you know, ongoing for years and years, but at least someone's finally doing something
[03:57:41.420 --> 03:57:42.420]  about it.
[03:57:42.420 --> 03:57:48.260]  Two cancer charities accused in New York of misusing $75 million in donations for jet
[03:57:48.260 --> 03:57:49.260]  ski outings.
[03:57:49.260 --> 03:57:50.940]  What are they used for?
[03:57:50.940 --> 03:57:57.060]  Jet ski outings, dating website subscriptions, and other personal spending are being dissolved
[03:57:57.060 --> 03:58:02.140]  for all 50 United States in the U.S. Attorney General or I can't even read that point, Attorney
[03:58:02.140 --> 03:58:03.300]  of some kind said on Wednesday.
[03:58:03.300 --> 03:58:07.980]  Wow, it's got like the eight houses that they built for the Haitians following that devastating
[03:58:07.980 --> 03:58:10.700]  earthquake with all the millions of dollars in aid they got.
[03:58:10.700 --> 03:58:15.500]  Well, you got to go jet skiing sometimes on $75 million in cancer charity donations.
[03:58:15.500 --> 03:58:16.500]  Total absurdity.
[03:58:16.500 --> 03:58:18.740]  I've been talking about that for years and years and years.
[03:58:18.740 --> 03:58:20.740]  Anyway, thanks so much for watching the show.
[03:58:20.740 --> 03:58:25.060]  It's been a pleasure to be joined by you guys hosting the show, Alex will be back tomorrow
[03:58:25.060 --> 03:58:27.500]  from 11 to 2 p.m. Central.
[03:58:27.500 --> 03:58:28.500]  Thanks so much for watching.
[03:58:28.500 --> 03:58:57.460]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
