[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:31.120]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones every day my job is easier because
[00:31.120 --> 00:36.200]  world government the fact that the world government wants to euthanize babies that are healthy up to
[00:36.200 --> 00:43.200]  age three kill old people it's out in the open every day prestigious publications call for world
[00:43.200 --> 00:49.880]  government run by Goldman Sachs Europe has been conquered through fraud by these people there
[00:49.880 --> 00:56.400]  are more CIA statements about how they're spying on citizens illegally and surveilling everything
[00:56.400 --> 01:01.880]  without warrants because they're telling us public schools all over the place are following in the
[01:01.880 --> 01:09.280]  footsteps of Pennsylvania and announcing themselves that they're watching you over laptops at home
[01:09.280 --> 01:17.280]  Reuters the Daily Mail and others have picked up on our six-year-old research is nothing off
[01:17.280 --> 01:24.000]  limits now Google plans to spy on background noises in your phone calls to bombard you with
[01:24.000 --> 01:31.880]  tailored adverts well it's actually worse than the patent they're covering and worse what Google
[01:31.880 --> 01:38.800]  announced six years ago and is in place via the DVR's the digital cable all of your cell phones
[01:38.800 --> 01:48.280]  not just smartphones and all of the major new appliances under global treaty and more people
[01:48.280 --> 01:53.760]  keep sending me emails saying there's no light bulbs that can interface with your computer and
[01:53.760 --> 02:00.440]  I've asked Watson to a whole nother article today just on appliances that spy on you and to link
[02:00.440 --> 02:09.040]  to videos I did a decade ago on this because DARPA through MIT was bragging we need to have like a
[02:09.040 --> 02:14.680]  full spectrum in fact guys you get me Watson via Skype just calling get him in front of his
[02:14.680 --> 02:18.560]  computer with Skype I want to have a talk with him on air because we got a talk this morning he
[02:18.560 --> 02:25.840]  did a great article on this but it's not hardcore enough I know he does the work of five writers
[02:25.840 --> 02:33.520]  every day I just you know he's my go-to guy I need a chronicle blow-by-blow for people here
[02:33.520 --> 02:38.640]  it's not enough to have Google saying they're using cameras for six years to watch you in your
[02:38.640 --> 02:48.440]  house on record it's not enough to have Sacramento and Philadelphia and all these cities admitting
[02:48.440 --> 02:54.120]  the police watch kids in the showers at school and watch you at home over the government-issued
[02:54.120 --> 03:00.240]  laptop every time I mention that I get emails saying I'm making it up people are either totally
[03:00.240 --> 03:05.880]  ignorant denial or now they're upset about what's happening or the third group they're saying I'm
[03:05.880 --> 03:13.760]  still a cook for not liking it but it's real speaking of that here's Forbes the simple solution
[03:13.760 --> 03:19.200]  to climate change hint it isn't world government Forbes is countering an article that came out
[03:19.200 --> 03:28.320]  in Scientific American and was published in the official section of the blog of the site
[03:28.320 --> 03:33.680]  that's like I guess the official statements of the editorial page effective world government will
[03:33.680 --> 03:38.720]  be needed to stave off climate catastrophe but I've got to have the ADL and Southern
[03:38.720 --> 03:43.960]  Poverty Law Center that masquerade as public interest groups and that advise the police putting
[03:43.960 --> 03:55.000]  manuals out saying that people like me are insane and want to blow buildings up I mean this is the
[03:55.000 --> 04:03.240]  type of garbage this is the type of garbage that I have to deal with and you have to deal with and
[04:03.240 --> 04:10.200]  only a public under mind control or brainwashing as the Attorney General admits they're under and
[04:10.200 --> 04:17.400]  brags in video clips we've played on C-Span he thinks it's real funny could sit there and
[04:17.400 --> 04:27.400]  simultaneously when I've had Discovery Channel History Channel Nightline MSNBC BBC all of them
[04:27.400 --> 04:34.640]  come through my office and they go so you imagine there's a 33rd degree to Masonry we'll know it's
[04:34.640 --> 04:40.880]  on record there is so you imagine there's a world government well no it's being announced I play
[04:40.880 --> 04:46.440]  some clips of world leaders saying it no I don't think so the New York Times says the Bilderberg
[04:46.440 --> 04:52.000]  doesn't exist and that I was in a field having a full-born schizophrenic hallucination when it was
[04:52.000 --> 04:58.040]  on record they were there and I had video up they think you're idiots and they treat you like
[04:58.040 --> 05:04.000]  you're idiots this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.960]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[05:08.960 --> 05:14.240]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[05:14.240 --> 05:19.760]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[05:19.760 --> 05:25.320]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[05:25.320 --> 05:31.080]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[05:31.080 --> 05:35.480]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[05:35.480 --> 05:41.280]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks
[05:41.280 --> 05:45.080]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my

[06:05.040 --> 06:10.760]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[06:10.760 --> 06:16.080]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the
[06:16.080 --> 06:21.600]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the
[06:21.600 --> 06:27.400]  respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[06:27.400 --> 06:33.120]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale
[06:33.120 --> 06:39.400]  of nano silver products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs
[06:39.400 --> 06:44.840]  generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast
[06:44.840 --> 06:51.880]  and simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of
[06:51.880 --> 07:02.720]  the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount
[07:02.720 --> 07:07.760]  of food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was
[07:07.760 --> 07:13.240]  literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that
[07:13.240 --> 07:19.600]  I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds
[07:19.600 --> 07:24.600]  of great products at info wars team dot com but I want to point out the three that have helped me

[09:27.480 --> 09:35.560]  while we've got a big transmission lined up for you today here is Paul Joseph Watson's
[09:35.560 --> 09:44.560]  article you read it here first Google's ambient background spy tech cell phones computer microphones
[09:44.560 --> 09:55.680]  computer built-in cameras now ubiquitous internet of things also a surveillance tool for authorities
[09:55.680 --> 10:02.680]  and the Daily Mail is now reporting this headline is nothing off limits now Google plans to
[10:02.680 --> 10:08.000]  spy on background noise in your phone calls to bombard you with tailored events and if
[10:08.000 --> 10:16.680]  we can go to Paul Watson's article it's the top on info wars.com and click on the fifth
[10:16.680 --> 10:23.600]  paragraph down it says indeed back in 2006 we first reported on the issue Google was
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.440]  already finalizing plans to spy on individuals ambient background environment by means of
[10:28.440 --> 10:34.000]  microphone embedded in their personal computer and Watson's great but his headline is you
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.400]  read it here first Google's ambient background spy tech Paul that's great but what I want
[10:39.400 --> 10:43.800]  you to do and he's online with us now is do another one I know because you're addicted
[10:43.800 --> 10:47.800]  to fighting the tyranny just like our great researchers Curtin M.O. Steve Watson Aaron
[10:47.800 --> 10:53.480]  Dykes and others but what I want you to do is something no one's done yet no one's done
[10:53.480 --> 11:02.360]  yet you cover some of it here I want the headline about appliances and phones have been spying
[11:02.360 --> 11:08.120]  on you for the decade a headline like that you read it here first and then go boom because
[11:08.120 --> 11:13.040]  I know you can dig up stuff I did 10 years ago when I linked to the MIT stuff about how
[11:13.040 --> 11:19.320]  they put the tech as the piggyback into everything all devices are to have this implanted into
[11:19.320 --> 11:25.000]  it I want the light bulbs that the feds are paying police departments to put in that flicker
[11:25.000 --> 11:35.400]  and interface with the computers that's even AP but we reported on it almost a decade ago
[11:35.400 --> 11:41.160]  I want to be able to to cover all of that because I want to just have a bullet point
[11:41.160 --> 11:45.880]  like here's the rest of the story and then explain that's why they're coming out and
[11:45.880 --> 11:49.360]  saying with CIA spying domestically illegally and they're and they're spying on everything
[11:49.360 --> 11:54.040]  I mean I want it to be a bullet point boom boom boom boom boom I know I called you as
[11:54.040 --> 11:58.800]  the you know overall editor of the operation this morning we had a little five minute discussion
[11:58.800 --> 12:03.960]  about hey be sure to toot our horn and your horn that you saw this patent and them telling
[12:03.960 --> 12:08.080]  shareholders they would do this quietly six years ago and we got a tax for that I've been
[12:08.080 --> 12:13.120]  on national shows they go you're the crazy guy saying they're watching me over my camera
[12:13.120 --> 12:17.040]  on my computer you're the crazy guy saying that there's microphones in my digital cable
[12:17.040 --> 12:23.560]  locks you're the crazy guy saying Teavos watching me this is even after they admit they are
[12:23.560 --> 12:30.640]  remember in Sacramento in the suburb of Philadelphia in other areas on the east coast and the west
[12:30.640 --> 12:37.360]  coast and I saw stories in Tennessee seven years ago we're a visiting basketball team
[12:37.360 --> 12:42.000]  of 11 year old girls came and took a shower after the game before they got on the bus
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.400]  and saw cameras in the showers and they panicked like you're supposed to they panicked ran
[12:48.400 --> 12:54.640]  out parents bowed up to police they were almost fistfights and the principal and coach came
[12:54.640 --> 12:58.040]  out and said of course we video type of in the showers for their safety there could be
[12:58.040 --> 13:05.160]  a theft or something in there and then everybody went whoa authority is saying cameras in the
[13:05.160 --> 13:14.920]  showers I mean that was in the Tennessee newspapers it happened in Kansas nearby I saw it happens
[13:14.920 --> 13:22.440]  speaking of that in Missouri I saw it happen in Illinois in Michigan in Texas this has
[13:22.440 --> 13:28.720]  been going on forever let's see the globalists hadn't made the announcements yet so it's
[13:28.720 --> 13:31.960]  like oh that's not true they would never do that in America then they're announcing people
[13:31.960 --> 13:37.920]  are like oh that's reasonable kind of like I've been aware for 17 years since I really
[13:37.920 --> 13:42.640]  fired up on air and started researching every day not just you know in my off time I've
[13:42.640 --> 13:51.800]  been researching for over 20 since high school I'm 38 since I graduated high school I was
[13:51.800 --> 13:58.440]  awakening and I remember reading the transhumanist and the globalist and the eugenicist under
[13:58.440 --> 14:02.480]  the bioethicist system say we're gonna get rid of the Hippocratic oath no more you know
[14:02.480 --> 14:07.640]  will not harm patients and we're gonna decide to have a utopian system and Bertrand Russell
[14:07.640 --> 14:12.040]  and George Bernard Shaw and how the socialists will decide if we live or not and how they'll
[14:12.040 --> 14:16.720]  decide by the eighth grade if you're gonna be killed and now you got all these movies
[14:16.720 --> 14:21.440]  coming out about that conditioning everybody that's gonna be normal but if you don't excel
[14:21.440 --> 14:28.480]  you're dead this is all planned because I read their own documents it's not hidden that's
[14:28.480 --> 14:31.760]  what's so frustrating it's just they think you're dumb and won't read it so it's all
[14:31.760 --> 14:38.120]  public but not advertised and now they come out Paul Watson three weeks ago writes an
[14:38.120 --> 14:42.800]  article out of the bioethics journal linking to it where they say kill babies up to three
[14:42.800 --> 14:48.160]  first it's up to birth then it's up to three then it's up to ten then it's everybody kill
[14:48.160 --> 14:55.280]  granny cover a newsweek simultaneously there is no plan to have death panels because they
[14:55.280 --> 15:00.160]  call them something else technically it's not called that but it is a death panel and
[15:00.160 --> 15:04.200]  no Bill Gates now admits it after it passes by the way they say the Supreme Court is set
[15:04.200 --> 15:07.480]  to go ahead and approve it well of course the insurance companies wrote it owned by
[15:07.480 --> 15:11.480]  the big banks it isn't liberals wanting to give you some health care they want to take
[15:11.480 --> 15:15.640]  over health care so you can't buy it if you want it and kill you that are never you'll
[15:15.640 --> 15:21.480]  all find out soon enough though all you that serve the system and love it so all of that's
[15:21.480 --> 15:28.200]  going on and people didn't believe it they were like this is satire oh there goes info
[15:28.200 --> 15:33.800]  wars lying again when Paul was linked to the journal well two days later London Telegraph
[15:33.800 --> 15:38.120]  Associated Press others but a lot of the publications said this is good let's kill
[15:38.120 --> 15:46.560]  some healthy three-year-old kids my daughter just turned four but I can't imagine her eyes
[15:46.560 --> 15:53.120]  electric with life and awakening and understanding and discernment and creativity and and and
[15:53.120 --> 16:00.560]  discovery and these murderous scum I saw confirmed reports now where Pepsi won't let its shareholder
[16:00.560 --> 16:10.800]  stop putting baby fetal juices in his flavoring that's confirmed just it's gonna get in last
[16:10.800 --> 16:16.160]  week Obama approved aborted babies for everything health care products cosmetics because they
[16:16.160 --> 16:21.320]  got to compete with the Chinese market and that's back in the news today men taking
[16:21.320 --> 16:27.080]  dead baby ground up pills so they can get erections they think that's in the news today
[16:27.080 --> 16:34.120]  and I'm the bad guy because I'm against all this horror I'm the extremist I'm the bad
[16:34.120 --> 16:48.920]  man Paul Watson but Paul Watson's the bad man see first first people say it can't be
[16:48.920 --> 16:57.560]  true kill babies the state says kill babies even if they're geniuses people always say
[16:57.560 --> 17:00.760]  don't kill mentally retarded babies because next will be healthy ones they're just like
[17:00.760 --> 17:07.880]  skip all that kill whoever we say we're the state we say die and they target the unborn
[17:07.880 --> 17:12.840]  with these vaccines that they know is causing deformities mental illness and miscarriages
[17:12.840 --> 17:15.960]  on record they always knew till three and a half years ago it was in every insert don't
[17:15.960 --> 17:19.960]  give a pregnant woman a shot now it's on the news and pregnant women get extra because
[17:19.960 --> 17:23.800]  they're testing telling you to get it have the miscarriage and get away with it they're
[17:23.800 --> 17:28.400]  testing murdering you they're not quietly injecting black men with syphilis anymore
[17:28.400 --> 17:33.840]  and watching them die slowly or atomic soldiering you know people or or or or letting children
[17:33.840 --> 17:39.440]  die with radiation poisoning like they used to do in secret now it's just killing us out
[17:39.440 --> 17:46.600]  in the open but the minute they admit it yeah we want to kill your baby after they're born
[17:46.600 --> 17:50.920]  suddenly people went that's reasonable but I thought I was crazy it wasn't real no it's
[17:50.920 --> 17:56.320]  real and it's good because those people are cowards and they're scared deep down the system
[17:56.320 --> 17:59.880]  so they're going to accept anything they're like oh I'm with you I'll do it oh oh yeah
[17:59.880 --> 18:04.680]  I'll kill babies all of you that are going along with this who think you're going to
[18:04.680 --> 18:09.200]  get away with stuff and keep being able just to operate it as usual you're the ones that
[18:09.200 --> 18:12.720]  are ensuring your own destruction I want to bring Paul Watson up he'll be with us the
[18:12.720 --> 18:19.000]  next segment Paul incredible job on this report and your other report on the locals not buying
[18:19.000 --> 18:23.560]  up in Wisconsin this is earthquakes and that they think it's explosions obviously probably
[18:23.560 --> 18:28.440]  some underground testing who knows what it is or the result of fracking they also think
[18:28.440 --> 18:32.960]  they're doing a lot of CO2 pumping in the area part of carbon taxing you know they've
[18:32.960 --> 18:36.120]  got deals they can pump it back into the ground saying it's evil don't want plants to breathe
[18:36.120 --> 18:42.400]  it great job that's up on the drugs report right now but briefly look is bad as hardcore
[18:42.400 --> 18:47.800]  as your article is it's not hardcore enough I want another one just with a hardcore sensational
[18:47.800 --> 18:54.920]  headline because this is sensational I can't come up Paul with a headline hardcore enough
[18:54.920 --> 19:01.280]  for every system of tech coming out and all appliances wired to listen and track us Paul
[19:01.280 --> 19:07.480]  Watson what's a good idea for an article just giving people every piece of the puzzle I
[19:07.480 --> 19:16.320]  don't know Alex it probably take a long time the main concern I have is people just don't
[19:16.320 --> 19:23.160]  care anymore that if you're signed into Google which if you've got any kind of account related
[19:23.160 --> 19:29.400]  to email or advertising of virtually anything then you have to be signed into Google it's
[19:29.400 --> 19:33.200]  virtually become the Internet now they quietly claim you waive your rights so they're going

[24:10.000 --> 24:16.200]  coming up after the break I'll give you my take on the poor young black teenager who
[24:16.200 --> 24:25.240]  was shot outside Orlando Obama is mercilessly using this to inject race hate and make the
[24:25.240 --> 24:34.760]  election racial Obama if I had a son he'd look like Trayvon unbelievable and if you
[24:34.760 --> 24:38.880]  look at the guy that shot him reportedly he was constantly calling 911 always paranoid
[24:38.880 --> 24:42.760]  about crime because there's been some robberies in the area people do get freaked out by hoodies
[24:42.760 --> 24:46.680]  and things like that I'm gonna give you my take on it a little bit later but I do think
[24:46.680 --> 24:53.840]  it's tragic and I think this person was outside the castle law in that he was off his property
[24:53.840 --> 24:58.560]  and then following someone that's if somebody's coming up to you threatening you then you
[24:58.560 --> 25:05.720]  have a right to defend yourself but if it's confirmed that this guy followed Trayvon and
[25:05.720 --> 25:09.400]  then did something to him that's not this that's not the second amendment that's why
[25:09.400 --> 25:13.960]  they're pushing this is for racial division and to go after these castle laws this is
[25:13.960 --> 25:19.360]  bad news hey Al Sharpton why don't you talk about how they sterilize black women all of
[25:19.360 --> 25:24.880]  this country or how they give them injections that sterilize them or how oh no you're not
[25:24.880 --> 25:29.600]  gonna talk about that or how they give the Africans HIV you're just gonna shoot your
[25:29.600 --> 25:36.000]  mouth off all day and threaten violence in Florida I'm telling you Obama advised Odinga
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.640]  in emails when he was a senator when he didn't win the election in Kenya to stage riots to
[25:40.640 --> 25:45.520]  make them give him a prime ministership to invent a post I'm gonna tell you what I think
[25:45.520 --> 25:51.640]  about this coming up but let me tell you Obama and his controllers are not beyond staging
[25:51.640 --> 26:00.280]  race riots in this country and it's despicable all right going back to Paul Watson Paul talk
[26:00.280 --> 26:06.160]  about sheep I mean people are getting to wear yeah first we were crazy that the Google and
[26:06.160 --> 26:11.000]  others were watching us through appliances now it's just admitted Paul I mean what if
[26:11.000 --> 26:18.000]  this is totally illegal Paul people don't care though Alex I mean there's a there's
[26:18.000 --> 26:24.280]  a thing in London where you walk past this Xbox connect type screen and it scans your
[26:24.280 --> 26:31.000]  face to determine your gender and then it targets adverse based on that premise there's
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.840]  RFID where it's literally minority report style advertising that the RFID is scanned
[26:37.840 --> 26:43.160]  in your clothing or your bag or whatever and then the ad is specifically targeted to you
[26:43.160 --> 26:46.960]  and that technology is now being rolled out now remember this is never gonna happen but
[26:46.960 --> 26:52.280]  now it's just being rolled out and the sheeple are loving it but it doesn't matter if 20%
[26:52.280 --> 27:00.880]  or 80% or 99% want to be slaves I have privacy that's why in a republic everybody's rights
[27:00.880 --> 27:05.560]  are protected even of the majority want to be slaves and this is totally illegal and
[27:05.560 --> 27:09.880]  most people don't like it they're just not aware of it and then they're slowly being
[27:09.880 --> 27:17.160]  conditioned publicly to accept it right people are already slaves though I mean they've got
[27:17.160 --> 27:22.560]  a face buried in a cell phone which we have anyway because that's our job I mean we have
[27:22.560 --> 27:27.360]  to do it every day but we choose to do it but we're aware of it we know yeah we need
[27:27.360 --> 27:32.600]  to that's our job we need to keep up with the news but generally people have their face
[27:32.600 --> 27:39.280]  buried in their cell phone you've got the majority of stuff on Twitter is complete babble and
[27:39.280 --> 27:45.600]  people are just obsessed with babble and crud and so when that gets thrown at them via targeted
[27:45.600 --> 27:52.440]  advertising most of them welcome it they like to see you know if they've been shopping at
[27:52.440 --> 27:58.000]  a particular store and then an ad from that same store pops up on their browser a couple
[27:58.000 --> 28:04.040]  of weeks later they like it they like most of them like being in the matrix that's what
[28:04.040 --> 28:08.200]  you've got to understand and of course Google six years ago said they were already testing
[28:08.200 --> 28:13.280]  and it was patented that they would dial in when you were using Google systems that they
[28:13.280 --> 28:19.280]  would hack into your computer via the cookies and interfaces and that they would watch you
[28:19.280 --> 28:24.240]  with an AI computer system over the camera and listen and if they heard a dog barking
[28:24.240 --> 28:29.480]  or certain TV shows that would go into the algorithm and tailor advertising but we know
[28:29.480 --> 28:35.280]  that's just the funding mechanism it's really a DARPA system and they now admit that why
[28:35.280 --> 28:40.040]  do you think Betrayus came out and admitted the CIA's operating domestically which is
[28:40.040 --> 28:45.040]  illegal a felony every time on record and that they're all the appliances are watching
[28:45.040 --> 28:50.920]  us and that there's no more Fourth Amendment why would he just come out publicly and defecate
[28:50.920 --> 28:56.600]  all over the Constitution because as I just said people don't care most people don't give
[28:56.600 --> 29:02.400]  it down I mean Google and the CIA are virtually the same thing through Incutel which is the
[29:02.400 --> 29:07.640]  CIA's investment program he was given a speech in Incutel and he said that yeah yeah they're
[29:07.640 --> 29:13.760]  all in they're invested in the same projects Google's recorded future this is basically
[29:13.760 --> 29:18.680]  eventually designed to be an attempt to predict the near future events through continuous
[29:18.680 --> 29:25.440]  monitoring of internet data and information Google and Incutel the primary investors of
[29:25.440 --> 29:31.280]  course we know Google was started by CIA CIA seed money so let's talk about this over the
[29:31.280 --> 29:36.680]  horizon future prediction system that we reported on ten years ago we're called loonies without
[29:36.680 --> 29:41.720]  it being declassified I could foresee with my own electrochemical supercomputer we all
[29:41.720 --> 29:46.880]  have one do you use yours we're gonna defeat these people stay there Paul I want to break
[29:46.880 --> 29:54.960]  down this nightmare matrix we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[33:09.680 --> 33:16.760]  this is not a new world it is simply an extension of what began in the old one it is patterned
[33:16.760 --> 33:21.480]  itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages
[33:21.480 --> 33:27.720]  of history since the beginning of time it has refinements technological advances and
[33:27.720 --> 33:33.680]  a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like every one of the
[33:33.680 --> 33:52.080]  super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic is an enemy and truth is a
[33:52.080 --> 34:09.720]  lie and the transmission is live 34 minutes into global transmission on this Friday I'll
[34:09.720 --> 34:15.280]  be back live this Sunday I did five weeks straight doing every Sunday show or six weeks

[34:21.200 --> 34:28.040]  part of it was recorded but I'll be live this Sunday four two six central five to seven
[34:28.040 --> 34:34.840]  eastern two to four Pacific three to five mountain it's gonna be the coolest time zone
[34:34.840 --> 34:45.600]  name mountain I love the West we are living in a brave new world and we are having our
[34:45.600 --> 34:52.040]  genetics overwritten the elite are playing God we have discovered documents from the
[34:52.040 --> 35:02.320]  1850s of a UFO cult with the Huxley's Darwin's Wedge Woods and others HD Wells was part of
[35:02.320 --> 35:09.960]  it and a whole star child program they believe that they are descendants of space aliens
[35:09.960 --> 35:19.760]  the Anunnaki and the movie coming out Prometheus is basically propaganda in that vein and so
[35:19.760 --> 35:24.880]  I'm gonna shoot a video today that'll be out Monday or so a special report here for the
[35:24.880 --> 35:35.480]  radio exposing the secrets that that film entails because it is highest level Illuminati
[35:35.480 --> 35:40.600]  religion that's why they're so crazy that's what they believe it's why they believe they've
[35:40.600 --> 35:45.200]  got a race with all these antimatter weapons genetic engineering all of it underground
[35:45.200 --> 35:56.080]  seed bunkers DNA vaults all over the world it is just crazy and we are going to be breaking
[35:56.080 --> 36:06.040]  that down for you with the documents from the 1850s now do I believe aliens are running
[36:06.040 --> 36:15.480]  all this Christians would call it the devil I don't get into that I'm gonna cover what
[36:15.480 --> 36:23.680]  the elite believe and there's a reason Prometheus is making such a stir online and everybody
[36:23.680 --> 36:29.200]  from forms of the LA Times is freaking out saying you know science fiction with mystery
[36:29.200 --> 36:34.160]  is back the only good science fiction movie in years has been something like well there's
[36:34.160 --> 36:39.640]  been some good ones but like children of men but that too is where they sterilize everybody
[36:39.640 --> 36:46.720]  it's all about controlling of the genetics and most of us are dead already we've already
[36:46.720 --> 36:51.480]  had our DNA wrecked that's on record from the lead mercury alone they've put into the
[36:51.480 --> 36:58.600]  environment we're one generation into GMO now they're going full GMO in every mammal
[36:58.600 --> 37:06.800]  test of creatures that have a quicker life cycle getting pigs rats mice sheep you get
[37:06.800 --> 37:14.000]  99 plus percent total sterilization and deformity mutations generally you think of deformities
[37:14.000 --> 37:20.280]  only happening in utero and developing in the first trimester really fantastic deformities
[37:20.280 --> 37:28.720]  you know it's two heads you know five eyes seven fingers stuff like that two hearts three
[37:28.720 --> 37:35.560]  kidneys another human inside a human teeth growing on the pancreas oh that's that's the
[37:35.560 --> 37:40.200]  type of deformities you can go look them up the list goes on and on another head inside
[37:40.200 --> 37:52.280]  a head but with the GMO goodies with the goodies that the global UFOs start child cult has
[37:52.280 --> 37:59.800]  been giving us in every mammal species by the third generation under this they start
[37:59.800 --> 38:07.160]  mutating when they're born and after and I mean eyeballs growing out teeth growing out
[38:07.160 --> 38:14.120]  of the side little heads popping out hair growing out of the mouths females with giant
[38:14.120 --> 38:21.360]  breasts the males with no testicles it's all the blessings of the new world order and they're
[38:21.360 --> 38:25.880]  going to give you all the other blessings oh they're going to bless you like they bless
[38:25.880 --> 38:30.240]  the troops with DU how many troops didn't believe me and call in now and say they're
[38:30.240 --> 38:34.400]  coughing up blood and got cancer at 25 and their kidneys are failing and they've been
[38:34.400 --> 38:39.880]  diagnosed with diabetes and the DU and they go into the VA and they say here's some prozac
[38:39.880 --> 38:43.120]  they're like but I'm coughing up blood and losing weight there's nothing wrong with you
[38:43.120 --> 38:47.040]  Jack and if you complain I'm gonna put you on a list is crazy and have your firearms
[38:47.040 --> 38:52.200]  taken that's not even an American doctor most of the doctors the VA now don't even have
[38:52.200 --> 38:58.560]  real medical degrees you are to be decommissioned like an old cannon you're to be spiked all
[38:58.560 --> 39:03.040]  right I'm ranting I'm gonna go to watch in and back to the calls but a sneak peek I'm
[39:03.040 --> 39:07.840]  gonna be letting you know the real lowdown on Prometheus they're not gonna like it and
[39:07.840 --> 39:14.400]  by the way I'm a big fan of Ridley Scott as a director he's probably the best living
[39:14.400 --> 39:26.040]  director after or before somebody like James Cameron and of course it's all about transhumanism
[39:26.040 --> 39:30.800]  it's all about replicants it's all about humans becoming God creating humanoids that are
[39:30.800 --> 39:37.480]  more advanced more human than human the nexus six that's the religion of these folks and
[39:37.480 --> 39:41.520]  some would say they really are geniuses yeah the cream of the British Empire the highest
[39:41.520 --> 39:51.320]  IQ is 160 plus years ago along with their US and German counterparts in visioned DNA
[39:51.320 --> 39:57.320]  more than 60 years before it was discovered and of course the discoverers all eugenicists
[39:57.320 --> 40:04.200]  obsessed with star child stuff 2001 space Odyssey you know inventor of the telecommunications
[40:04.200 --> 40:13.600]  satellite high-level Illuminati Mason Arthur C. Clark all of it all of it all of it you
[40:13.600 --> 40:21.560]  are all to be killed you are not to go through to the anointed level of the Illuminati and
[40:21.560 --> 40:27.400]  those running things if anybody is profane and shouldn't go to the next level to use
[40:27.400 --> 40:33.920]  their own system it's them they think they're enlightened they're not they are not illuminated
[40:33.920 --> 40:48.000]  they're illuminated with a counterfeit a black sunshine this is black sunshine let he who
[40:48.000 --> 40:56.680]  has ears let him hear whoa to those who have eyes and cannot see and ears and cannot hear
[40:56.680 --> 41:02.160]  Watson I just always love having you pop in finish up with the total control grid being
[41:02.160 --> 41:07.320]  announced to the slaves now that it's pretty much in place the torture of the secret arrest
[41:07.320 --> 41:11.640]  the UN running everything it's all being announced scientific American effective world government
[41:11.640 --> 41:17.560]  will be needed to stave off climate catastrophe that's Club of Rome standard garbage and that's
[41:17.560 --> 41:24.320]  just it for the profane outsiders inner workings are but public not not publicized it's public
[41:24.320 --> 41:29.120]  it's there but not pushed that that means kill everybody to save the earth meanwhile
[41:29.120 --> 41:33.920]  these people are engaging in experiments that are probably going to destroy the earth
[41:33.920 --> 41:38.480]  that's the deception that's why you can only see the black sunshine you cannot see the
[41:38.480 --> 41:42.920]  full spectrum that's why you're blind those of you that serve this evil if you had any
[41:42.920 --> 41:48.560]  discernment and any will and any connection to the creator of the universe the real creator
[41:48.560 --> 41:58.840]  you wouldn't be serving the abomination creation you wouldn't be serving the engineers that
[41:58.840 --> 42:05.360]  you believe you're following and making movies about it if you understood truly what you've
[42:05.360 --> 42:10.080]  turned loose and what you're doing going back to Watson Watson what do you think of the
[42:10.080 --> 42:13.800]  fact that they're just announcing world government is the answer to everything right now announcing
[42:13.800 --> 42:17.440]  all the spying I mean why are they just throwing this all out in the open right now they don't
[42:17.440 --> 42:27.720]  want to get into the blast going off in Wisconsin because people don't read books anymore they
[42:27.720 --> 42:36.760]  don't read the news they read 140 character blurbs about Justin Bieber so who are they
[42:36.760 --> 42:41.760]  announcing it to they're not even paying attention anymore so who cares if they're just announcing
[42:41.760 --> 42:46.680]  it to us and saying we're in control basically while all the rest of the people are off in
[42:46.680 --> 42:51.160]  La La Land but the globalist aren't in control they think they're in control they're not
[42:51.160 --> 42:57.720]  in control yeah but it's about them telling us that they're in control so we bow down
[42:57.720 --> 43:03.120]  to their authority exactly they'd rather try to dominate their own species instead of actually
[43:03.120 --> 43:13.440]  being in control of themselves well yeah but people who choose to ignore it deliberately
[43:13.440 --> 43:19.880]  deserve everything they get it's only the people who are aware of it who deserve to have some
[43:19.880 --> 43:24.840]  kind of free choice and some quality of life but that's why we're all targeted by the globalist
[43:24.840 --> 43:29.680]  they're harassing me Amish the preppers anybody who doesn't want to be part of this liquid
[43:29.680 --> 43:36.200]  death is the enemy well yeah that's why they've characterized as all terrorists they've got
[43:36.200 --> 43:42.560]  the FBI putting tracking cookies on people who visit prepper websites which then follow
[43:42.560 --> 43:49.480]  them around the web everywhere else they go so people people who do care that there are
[43:49.480 --> 43:55.280]  very simple and easy ways to avoid this the primary one is to get a subscription which
[43:55.280 --> 44:02.440]  is not expensive to a technology that simply hides your IP address and if you're in Britain
[44:02.440 --> 44:06.760]  you can pretend you're in Texas and if you're in Texas you can pretend you're anywhere else
[44:06.760 --> 44:11.540]  I mean that's what I have to do when I go to China because Facebook everything that I use
[44:11.540 --> 44:16.520]  YouTube is blocked so I have to pretend that I'm in Houston and they don't know they're
[44:16.520 --> 44:20.920]  non the wiser and that's completely legal and anyone can do it so the people who do
[44:20.920 --> 44:26.720]  care about privacy that's what they need to do that's right all over the world our YouTube
[44:26.720 --> 44:32.920]  videos specifically are blocked and people send me screenshots it's been in the news
[44:32.920 --> 44:39.280]  that they can't see my videos in many cases in Eastern Europe or in Australia or in China
[44:39.280 --> 44:43.320]  or other areas but they could see everything else that's on YouTube and then I try to watch
[44:43.320 --> 44:48.120]  stuff in Australia and it tells me I can't see it because I'm in the US and I've got
[44:48.120 --> 44:53.320]  to go use a proxy if I want to be able to go over there and see that I mean this is incredible
[44:53.320 --> 44:58.400]  this is already being put into place they don't want a sharing info see a show like
[44:58.400 --> 45:05.640]  this can take stories in Africa or stories in North America and can and can show you
[45:05.640 --> 45:08.880]  a regional story that you're not meant to see in the other part of the world because
[45:08.880 --> 45:16.040]  they don't want to sing the continuity of agenda Paul oh but I mean the problem is most
[45:16.040 --> 45:21.320]  of our track we get if you pull out a YouTube video it could get half a million views and
[45:21.320 --> 45:28.520]  it could get 50,000 comments whereas even articles on our own website you know a popular
[45:28.520 --> 45:34.440]  article will probably get 300 comments so all our traffic is shifting over to them because
[45:34.440 --> 45:40.680]  that's where the matrix is that's where everybody's got their accounts is with YouTube and Google
[45:40.680 --> 45:44.600]  of course Google owns YouTube the people say well why are we there because that's the battle
[45:44.600 --> 45:51.660]  zone and info wars in prison planet are getting more traffic than ever but yes there's a larger
[45:51.660 --> 45:56.920]  community there on YouTube or on a Facebook or a Twitter so yeah we'll get thousands
[45:56.920 --> 46:02.040]  of comments on our Facebook and our Twitter areas and then you are biggest articles maybe
[46:02.040 --> 46:10.280]  a thousand comments and it again it just shows exactly what you're talking about but it shows
[46:10.280 --> 46:16.360]  that you need to interact with the matrix to have any kind of effect on it I mean you
[46:16.360 --> 46:20.760]  can go out and live your life without the internet without modern technology but you're
[46:20.760 --> 46:25.160]  not going to be able to change anything or no you're right we've got to engage the matrix
[46:25.160 --> 46:30.720]  we've got a 100% use its systems now in fact I want to talk to you all fair about we've
[46:30.720 --> 46:36.520]  I've never really tried to use hijack pop culture I want to launch an operation basically
[46:36.520 --> 46:41.840]  hijack popular culture I want to shift into this battle mode and I think I think it's
[46:41.840 --> 46:48.640]  going to give us a light-ear jump on the enemy well you did it with that Lindsay Lohan poison
[46:48.640 --> 46:54.640]  video which got hundreds of thousands of views to a certain extent that's what the Angelina
[46:54.640 --> 47:00.400]  Jolie thing was that reach tens of millions but the point is exactly we hijack one of
[47:00.400 --> 47:07.080]  their petty issues to transmit to people deep in matrix control and we make no apologies
[47:07.080 --> 47:11.000]  for it because it deserves to be hijacked because it's absolutely meaningless they're
[47:11.000 --> 47:17.680]  hijacking our communication pathway and polluting it with garbage yeah so it's about giving
[47:17.680 --> 47:21.120]  them the antidote isn't it and that's the only way to do it is to interact with the
[47:21.120 --> 47:29.160]  matrix so I mean that's what Google is now Google is the matrix Google is the internet
[47:29.160 --> 47:34.280]  you can you can barely use the internet without interacting with Google in some way they're
[47:34.280 --> 47:40.680]  basically a CIA front the strat for emails confirmed that basically they were the one
[47:40.680 --> 47:45.160]  of the main driving forces behind the Arab Spring behind all these fake revolution which
[47:45.160 --> 47:48.720]  we knew day one I mean Google and the NSA were in there running the whole thing they're
[47:48.720 --> 47:55.440]  running al-Qaeda so I mean they've got al-Qaeda blowing up police stations in Syria and the
[47:55.440 --> 48:02.080]  news calls them protesters listen they've got al-Qaeda giving speeches in YouTube videos
[48:02.080 --> 48:07.920]  in front of huge al-Qaeda flags with you know that all the headgear and on and everything
[48:07.920 --> 48:15.560]  they've got Libyan al-Qaeda desecrating christian graves but you know the videos they're banning
[48:15.560 --> 48:22.200]  our videos oh yeah al-Qaeda can have all the videos they want but god forbid should you
[48:22.200 --> 48:27.880]  know put out a video about the TSA it gets age restricted for no reason or the numerous
[48:27.880 --> 48:33.480]  other examples where videos disappear now they've got copyright infringement and all this stuff
[48:33.480 --> 48:39.080]  you know you got harassed for holding up a newspaper headline it's ridiculous but as
[48:39.080 --> 48:42.760]  I said that's where all the traffic is so that's where you have to go to wait people
[48:42.760 --> 48:46.920]  and that's why I filed in court quietly four times on people to make false claims to see
[48:46.920 --> 48:50.880]  how they like federal court that's why they don't mess with us that much anymore now it's
[48:50.880 --> 48:56.200]  the government demanding our videos be taken down because we're hurting them now briefly
[48:56.200 --> 48:59.320]  Paul I appreciate the great job you've done I'm again I'm begging you do that big boil
[48:59.320 --> 49:06.640]  down bullet point article Sarkozy's saying arrest people that visit conspiracy sites
[49:06.640 --> 49:11.680]  Kurt Nemo's got an article on that at infowars.com briefly your reports up at drudge the government
[49:11.680 --> 49:16.640]  saying now it's in two towns these big booms being now recorded they say our earthquakes
[49:16.640 --> 49:21.600]  the public isn't buying it Paul tell us about residents skeptical of many quakes explanation
[49:21.600 --> 49:29.600]  for Clintonville booms well the USGS came out and said there was a mini earthquake on Tuesday
[49:29.600 --> 49:36.120]  which was a 1.5 on the Richter scale which would only be even if it was felt they have
[49:36.120 --> 49:41.280]  these routinely in California nobody even feels them even if it was felt it would be
[49:41.280 --> 49:47.240]  people within a five mile zone of it and yet people 80 miles away in a different town
[49:47.240 --> 49:52.000]  heard the same thing so they're saying an earthquake that happened on Tuesday caused
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.520]  all these reports of booms which were reported the previous Sunday night so how can that
[49:57.520 --> 50:03.600]  be even possible in the first place and then people 80 miles away here as well nobody buying
[50:03.600 --> 50:09.000]  it in this town of Clintonville but the local city officials have just said yeah that's
[50:09.000 --> 50:13.680]  it case solved all the equipment that was going to find the epicenter of it's being
[50:13.680 --> 50:19.960]  sent back they're not going to do any more tests and even professors at the local universities
[50:19.960 --> 50:25.720]  have come out and said that this this earthquake that they suddenly found which you know nobody
[50:25.720 --> 50:29.920]  knew had happened until they there was this big controversy that they needed to explain
[50:29.920 --> 50:36.320]  away even this explanation is just doesn't add up so the mystery continues and all the
[50:36.320 --> 50:40.880]  residents there are very skeptical about the official explanation well people can read
[50:40.880 --> 50:46.120]  all that info works dot com and prison planet dot com's residents skeptical of many quick
[50:46.120 --> 50:50.480]  explanation what they don't believe their government they're all conspiracy theorists
[50:50.480 --> 50:54.880]  have the southern property law center put them on a hate list I mean they're questioning
[50:54.880 --> 51:02.880]  I mean this is un-American I mean Petraeus watch them a little over a year ago I began
[51:02.880 --> 51:07.240]  to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still
[51:07.240 --> 51:12.280]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow
[51:12.280 --> 51:16.360]  our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[51:16.360 --> 51:21.840]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies
[51:21.840 --> 51:27.560]  need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best

[54:43.440 --> 54:48.280]  one percent chance it was purely alone not who they weren't helping I mean they admit
[54:48.280 --> 54:52.720]  they were tracking him for years people warned him he went to this al-qaeda training deal
[54:52.720 --> 54:57.440]  but he's a lone actor like all these guys are and then I predicted they'd blow him up
[54:57.440 --> 55:02.520]  in an apartment just like in Madrid with the bombings back in two thousand three which
[55:02.520 --> 55:08.000]  turned out to be staged the government got thrown out in Spain over it and the police
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.480]  went and just blew up some patsies in an apartment and hope case closed and turned out federal
[55:12.480 --> 55:20.360]  anti terror police have been seen planning the bombs on the trains so this stuff goes
[55:20.360 --> 55:27.040]  on obviously it's it's in Europe its operation gladio basically revisited and now Sarkozy
[55:27.040 --> 55:34.480]  has gone ahead of the nationalist lapin the daughter of a lapin who almost one years ago
[55:34.480 --> 55:39.840]  and they do not like that because they are actually for France and aren't globalist and
[55:39.840 --> 55:44.920]  one out of the EU and that's just not going to be allowed even the socialist I'm not seeing
[55:44.920 --> 55:49.360]  Dominique Strauss-Cons good he's a Bilderberg globalist he said don't ruin our societies
[55:49.360 --> 55:55.040]  we got to write off most this debt it's derivatives you'll destroy the golden goose wasn't because
[55:55.040 --> 56:00.440]  he was moral he was like look you can't be greedy you're going to ruin everything you're
[56:00.440 --> 56:05.160]  going to totally implode things and then he was on record he was about ten points ahead
[56:05.160 --> 56:10.080]  of Sarkozy I told you day one that was a setup it was later confirmed this has been in New
[56:10.080 --> 56:15.120]  York Daily News you name it Sarkozy intelligence operatives were involved they tweeted it before
[56:15.120 --> 56:19.640]  he was even the police have been called and they jumped the gun and they staged the whole
[56:19.640 --> 56:24.440]  deal and it turned out she worked for organized crime and it was all set up and the charges
[56:24.440 --> 56:30.040]  were dropped remember that the bottom line is don't get in the way of Sarkozy who isn't
[56:30.040 --> 56:37.800]  even French by the way I mean it's it's just disgusting that this is going on so there I
[56:37.800 --> 56:43.080]  pretty much already covered that wow you know I usually put a article up Paul Watson wrote
[56:43.080 --> 56:50.120]  one last night and you know most people agree with us and people disagree with me I always
[56:50.120 --> 56:56.280]  try to see what they're saying but I'd say 30 40% disagreed and we're really nasty about
[56:56.280 --> 57:01.120]  it so after I take some calls I'm going to get into this Obama administration tries to
[57:01.120 --> 57:06.800]  shut down Rush Limbaugh media matters as White House front group and we go on to point out
[57:06.800 --> 57:11.080]  that this group is funded by George Soros on record memos have come out that they want
[57:11.080 --> 57:16.880]  to destroy alternative media Fox News Limbaugh but also people like me that seen as not part
[57:16.880 --> 57:21.640]  of their system not saying Fox or Limbaugh are good I criticize them my radio show is
[57:21.640 --> 57:26.520]  up against Rush Limbaugh we've had stations calling up wanting to get out of their contract
[57:26.520 --> 57:31.320]  with him to pick up my show and I've said I don't want to get stations that way I would
[57:31.320 --> 57:37.440]  benefit personally in the short term by Rush Limbaugh getting kicked off the air but long
[57:37.440 --> 57:44.000]  term long term they're going to get me next folks the White House is running media matters
[57:44.000 --> 57:49.600]  on record we have links to it all here admitted their own memos funded by George Soros and
[57:49.600 --> 57:56.240]  other foreign groups and they want to shut him down and kick him off the air if it was
[57:56.240 --> 58:00.640]  some true grassroots group actually trying to get him off I'd go that's kind of dangerous
[58:00.640 --> 58:11.360]  but okay the White House folks if Bush was trying to get Randy Rhodes or some you know
[58:11.360 --> 58:18.240]  liberal radio host off or or Schultz I would have been against it don't you get it I don't
[58:18.240 --> 58:24.320]  like the Ku Klux Klan but I'll fight for their right to demonstrate and to publish I don't
[58:24.320 --> 58:27.800]  like some of the black Muslim groups that say kill all the whiteies but I you know what
[58:27.800 --> 58:33.360]  they've got a right to say I'm the devil if they want folks it's simple if they can bring
[58:33.360 --> 58:37.220]  down Limbaugh they can bring down anybody and they think he's unpopular and they're
[58:37.220 --> 58:52.760]  trying to do it this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network a little over a year ago I began
[58:52.760 --> 58:57.160]  to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still
[58:57.160 --> 59:02.240]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow
[59:02.240 --> 59:06.360]  our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[59:06.360 --> 59:11.880]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies
[59:11.880 --> 59:17.680]  need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best
[59:17.680 --> 59:23.200]  vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered young Jeviti the young Jeviti products

[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:48.680]  just give me the name and that's how i can search it people always give urls out the whole url they
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.240]  try to spell out the whole deal just well this is this is going back to that document that you
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.840]  talked about in december that disappeared the national continuity plan the red team and
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:01.400]  blue team thing with the fema camps and all that yeah this is a follow-up on that because
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:09.080]  they didn't take down the entire document there's a vendor list there are people who are signing
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:15.400]  up who want to make money off of this okay so so so let me clear it's p a m s s yes and then the
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:25.240]  next word is wiltex w i l t e x that's one of the companies that signed up p x you should get two
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:32.280]  links on that the first is an fbo dot gov the other is cryptome dot org so the original pdf
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:37.000]  back in december was archived so anybody who wants to see the entire thing and there's an
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.440]  important piece of information in there um uh the other one is the fbo link and you can either
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.760]  click the main link by the way when i covered that they had co and gel pro opposing his patriots
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:52.200]  come out and say i was fear mongering about camps as they're spending billions overall we found a
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:57.400]  bunch of other documents activating them everywhere that's big news that they're getting the emergency
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:03.320]  centers ready for civil unrest in their own words but i'm bad just like i made up they're
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:09.000]  saying kill babies up to age three and just like i made up world government i'm bad but they've got
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:16.200]  other conspiracy theorists we can trust saying i'm a liar yes i am aware of the vendors list i
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.600]  think you may have missed the reports paul watson did in january and february but i haven't seen
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:26.760]  this particular one so i should just put that in the search engine or go uh to the government contract
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:31.400]  site well you can go and search there but start page will give you two different links and it'll
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:37.960]  take you right there all right so pam ss wiltex and cryptome dot org also i can search there
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:43.640]  thank you so much i'll have to look into that great points there but it's all imaginary you know

[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:19.800]  network okay coming up herald river says a hoodie allowed zimmerman to kill martin and i'm going
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:25.960]  to give you my take on this obama has now come out and said that this young man looked like
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:35.320]  the son never had to personalize it talk about opportunistic evil and this is going to be done
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:41.160]  to play people off against each other in a big way and to try to demonize the second amendment
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:47.560]  you better believe this is the type of election year stunt that is going to be pulled and this
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:52.680]  is what the globalists are into the multiculturalist it's never about people living in peace it's about
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:09:00.280]  playing it up and here's an example i can go show you crimes by black people against whites burning
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:06.280]  them shooting them killing them does that mean i blame all black people no but there are a lot of
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:11.880]  racial crimes against whites hispanics you name it and vice versa there's a big war on average
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:18.120]  between hispanics and blacks i see it all the time buried in the news but it never really becomes a
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:24.520]  big issue because it's not something they can use in an election i mean out in california the mexican
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:30.520]  gangs because they're dominant are just pushing the blacks out and it's a turf war if it was a
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:35.400]  different black gang if it was all blacks pretty much in california it would be one other black
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:40.120]  group going after another black group and it'd be over what color they wore just like hutus and
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:48.360]  tutsis and rwanda it's all about turf and yeah they'll people find race or religion or region
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:53.880]  oh you're a Yankee oh you're from the south it's just an excuse to put yourself in groups because
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:58.840]  humans are tribal here i'm already getting into it aren't i but it's just despicable by obama i'm
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:04.760]  going to get into that more on this big deal folks that the white house on record meets with and
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:10.520]  through groups funds media matters the media matters has said they want to end web freedom period
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:16.360]  they attack me they want me shut down they're really creepy they have private investigators
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:23.720]  they infiltrate they make stuff up um it's like a foreign military i mean i've had media matters
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:28.760]  call me before as a reporter and i'm talking with their head guys and i go you get fun about
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.840]  george sorris he goes no we don't we're and i pulled up federal elections commission and
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:38.360]  nonprofit funding and read it to him he goes boy you're good at that aren't you and i went yeah
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.880]  here's a million here a million there and there's these other groups that he gives to that didn't
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:48.680]  give to you i mean it's on and he's just like well boy you're good at that you i get you got me there
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:56.200]  alex it's like real funny i mean when you're dealing with somebody they didn't even ideology
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:05.800]  they're just mercenaries it's really creepy and they said in memos they would infiltrate alternative
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:11.000]  media and they see fox and limbaugh as the kings of that because they're posing as conservative
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.720]  alternative media so the system can control the right angle of it they're just getting rid of that
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:21.240]  now the system is decided and the memos are out there they want to just get rid of talk radio
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:26.600]  whether it's liberal conservative because you can call in its long form it's very hard for the
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:32.040]  censors and the and the and the talking point controllers to manage it this is on record
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.280]  and i've talked in confidence people go well why don't you give us the info when someone
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:44.360]  at the highest levels of talk radio tells you something and when you're brought into confidence
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:48.760]  by other people at near the highest level and you're told names and you're told things that
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:55.080]  later get confirmed you can't give the source up that's journalism 101 if i ever start giving up
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:02.840]  my sources if i ever start kissing and telling as they say in the media then i'm over people say
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:06.840]  oh really we don't believe your peanut documents real we don't believe this someone's pretty
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:12.360]  documents real tell us what federal marshal gave it to us tell us what state police officer gave it to
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:22.760]  you and for a week i was attacked everybody said it was fake both times of course later the government
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:26.760]  had to admit it was real because congress started doing requests for the information
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:31.800]  because congressmen were mentioned as being basically terrorist and of course did i get
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:37.080]  any apologies when it turned out all that was real no no see i'm here to hit the bar bar first
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:42.520]  let's get that straight so people who think they're beating me when they lie about me and twist things
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:48.440]  and and no you don't win because i in the final equation care about defeating the globalist i'm
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.880]  ready to hit the barbed wire and take it first to make sure the info gets out even if i don't get
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:59.880]  credit but i realized how valuable our operation is so it is important for people not even so much
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:07.080]  defend us but support us by being sponsors and by buying our books videos t-shirts by subscribing
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:13.800]  to prison planet dot tv and by taking our info that you know is good and accurate when you check
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:19.160]  it out for yourself and getting it out to people come and tell pro wants you to defend us and spend
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:25.480]  all your time in a rat's nest defending us don't do that that's why even when i have total proof
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:33.240]  something saying something that somebody's saying about me isn't true i rarely defend myself unless
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:42.920]  it's an educational moment and then occasionally i will but i i take the attacks as okay i'm over
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:45.880]  the target the old world war two saying when do you know you're over the target when you're
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:51.720]  getting the heavy flag i i take that as we're taking heavy enemy fire we are over the target
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:58.600]  well we're not getting as much fire turn the more fire over there turn into it because i'm like a
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:04.200]  signal flare in world war one you fire it up it drifts down on a parachute it illuminates things
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:09.400]  because just a spotlight will only eliminate certain areas you want that top down light
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:15.320]  to be able to see so i'm a signal flare that's what i'm doing here and so i'm up there floating
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:19.480]  around down towards the ground who knows how long i'll be up there and they're shooting at me
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:24.200]  you know they want to knock me out of the air they want to pop my parachute so that they're not
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:32.040]  eliminated but by then more people are firing signal flares my job has already been completed
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:36.920]  i mean i can keep going on for a long time keep having greater victories against tyranny but i i
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:43.400]  feel peace and fulfilled because i've already dropped some heavy payloads that are self replicating
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:49.000]  like nano tech information virals what the enemy calls it and i've already hit them and
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.280]  hit them hard i mean i can see the dominoes i can project out over the horizon with full
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:00.120]  horizon analysis and i can go wow that's history making my name probably won't even be connected
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:08.440]  to it but the the the victory is a survival of the species and an example to others because flesh
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:15.160]  isn't what's important what is important is your spirit and your deeds and my flesh does not like
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:21.880]  defending rush limbaugh who's attacked me before viciously many times five or six times i know of
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:29.080]  and built straw man rush limbaugh who says gas i actually found the clip gas people that used
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:33.720]  drugs he said that a decade ago while he was gobbling pills he's all for the drug war while
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:47.320]  he's doing it himself the point is if if if they can destroy him see my my my flesh says destroy him
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:55.320]  but my gut my spirit my discernment says no defend rush limbaugh and my gut's never wrong
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:00.600]  and then i can intellectually analyze okay why to defend rush limbaugh well if they can shut
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:06.920]  him down for some humor that's mild compared to shows on network television good christian bleepers
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:13.800]  and and and uh you know the guy on hbo calling christian scum and women you know this and that
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:18.440]  that's all acceptable of course i didn't call for him losing a show i just call for my right to expose
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:26.680]  it bill marn so when they all call for the end of limbaugh and and and all of this it's to set a
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:32.680]  precedent to go after everybody and they're going after local talk show host i know and when you roll
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:37.320]  over to that stations when you give into that you might as well just kiss everything goodbye
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:42.440]  because when the white house which is goldman sacks run on record is funding media matters and
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:46.840]  having strategy meetings at the white house every meeting and phone strategies every day
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:53.240]  and they're trying to shut alex shone's down they're trying i mean they they got napolitano
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:17:03.480]  off the air and brag about it on fox business uh glenn beck wasn't perfect but putting out more
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:09.400]  truth anything else i'd seen on fox and he was still a worldly person who did dirty tricks to me
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:14.520]  behind the scenes i was there at fox supposed to be on a bunch of shows and they said sorry glenn
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:19.640]  beck's throwing a fit and i was like well i was already on the view and cnn and msnbc okay that's
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:25.480]  okay and he said you know let us get you a steak over here you know next door sorry about glenn
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:33.320]  everybody hates him you know but uh he's throwing fits and then i you know still i'm like well don't
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:38.520]  run him off the air because i understand there's bigger things in me so all you worldly people
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:43.480]  saying you idiot get rid of limbaugh i hope he i hope he gets fired and all this don't you get it
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:49.880]  you can't have the white house front groups trying to kick people off the air
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.360]  don't you don't you understand that this is dangerous for everybody's free speech all right
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:00.280]  i've already covered the limbaugh now let's go another call john in wisconsin you're on the air
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:09.560]  welcome go ahead uh yeah go ahead go ahead and talk on your telephone john yep uh i was just
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:15.720]  calling uh about uh just basically to agree with you completely about the swim ball thing um even
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:19.880]  though you know i don't really uh you know respect the guy too much but i mean you're exactly right
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:24.600]  i mean if they can take him down they can literally take anybody down hang together hang separate
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:29.880]  it's what it's called exactly exactly if people don't realize that then pretty much they get what
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:35.320]  they deserve i agree with you what do you think about obama coming out and saying this could be
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:41.560]  his son that got killed to personalize it that is the sickest exploitation of a death i have ever seen
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:46.040]  absolutely i just seen that on the droge report not too long ago too and i just
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:51.640]  that was my first instinct i just you know i seen it and i was just like god you gotta be
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:59.160]  kidding me yeah it's politico reporting it it's completely and totally disgusting and again folks
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:04.120]  we've already had stations contacting us that are looking to get out of their contract with limbaugh
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:10.840]  and i'm like i'm like a couple weeks ago i'm like uh and and and i still has a bad feeling
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:15.320]  i want to listen i'm beating him in many cities in the ratings i want to replace him
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:20.440]  because i'm more hardcore and get better ratings and i'm a winner i don't want him off the field
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:25.400]  before i've crushed him that's another issue absolutely yeah but you're smart enough to
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:30.680]  realize like you said earlier i mean if if uh he goes down i mean next could be easily you
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:37.560]  exactly he doesn't go down like this with obama that globalist puppets sneaking around with jord
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:43.080]  soros i mean jord soros wants an end to the free press in this country it that's what they do
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:49.160]  so i mean look i'm sorry it's not even a lesser two evils you can't let the the white house and
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:55.560]  goldman sacks through soros kick rush limbaugh off the air more calls coming up i mean that is a no
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:03.000]  brainer that is a no brainer we'll be right back i've seen the ungevity products work for many
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.160]  others and so i bought a bunch of them started using them had a little bit of results but i
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:13.160]  wasn't following the regimen every day but erin dykes in my office did and lost more than 60

[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:35.000]  briefly back to the subject of media matters media matters has 501c3 tax exempt status and

[01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:01.880]  tea parties all over the country that are doing the tax exempt thing and saying they're just for
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:05.960]  the constitution and a lot of the tea parties genuinely are mad at the republicans too and
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:09.880]  they just want the republic back they're being shut down audited everywhere but
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:18.600]  it's just such a rig game i am so sick of it and i'm quite frankly blown away by some of our
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:24.120]  readers at info wars dot com implying that i'm friends with limbaugh when he's attacked me on
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:36.840]  record and i'm on the radio against him for 15 years in this slot 15 years i'm a direct competitor

[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:55.480]  in a trance they're in a medical trance we've written articles with the government documents
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:01.000]  just like we wrote articles six years ago and ten years ago about appliances having tracker
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.080]  systems in them now it's admitted but we had the documents it is a fact that in the entire

[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:05.160]  motivation but to run four or five so about a week ago i said man this stuff you know i'm promoting

[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:06.280]  adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters i tell you some of the best things that were
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:10.520]  happening in my life were adversity i don't get into those stories but nothing like his adversity
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:15.080]  got an infection and lost his limbs i want him to talk about that and in fact before we get into
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:18.680]  the bad stuff with the tsa i'd like to have him up sometime for a full hour we have a limited time
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:25.160]  today i you know tell us about yourself a little bit uh jeff and then i know you want to be nice

[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:34.200]  this didn't keep in a safe it's training our kids that pedophiles can touch them the psychologists
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:38.760]  are on record and when the state of texas tried to ban it the feds threatened to blockade of our
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:43.880]  airspace so i know you're like before you came on you're like i just don't want to batch the tsa
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:49.000]  they're doing their job but this is out of control so first tell us about yourself and then what
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.800]  you're going through when you fly all the time to speak around the country hi alex thank you for
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:59.240]  inviting me on your show my wife is here also and she's part of this my story also in fact she's
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:04.920]  the biggest hero of all in this whole thing so if you need her to chime in just let me know uh
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:11.000]  i was shot in the back in 1985 and lost my spleen and that's actually what caused the loss of my
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:22.680]  limbs uh because your spleen captures encapsulated bacteria i contacted strep b in 19 or 2005 and
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:27.800]  because i had no spleen to fight it off it developed an asepsis and that's and then what's called
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:34.360]  d i c which is a your body's miracle that saves blood for your heart and your brain and your lungs
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:39.560]  by cutting off the blood supply to things that are unnecessary and in that case it was my
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:46.120]  hands and my feet and i almost lost my nose and my ears and uh i woke up in a hospital after being
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:51.960]  a coma for three weeks with no hands and no feet that's everything else was described to me but
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:57.400]  before that i had been perfectly healthy i've only been sick sick one day in my life and that were
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:03.720]  for that period of my life and boy that was a doozy and since then you uh are a motivational
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:08.600]  speaker kind of encapsulate what you do there well i kind of stumbled into that uh people had
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:13.880]  started inviting me to just come tell my story to be honest with you before this happened to be
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:19.960]  nobody cared much about what i had to say even my students but now my wife and i have literally
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:26.360]  been all over the country just just to share our story and we love it we just love to get out and
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:32.840]  say life goes on uh basically my story is if you fall down get back up don't complain about the
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:40.440]  things you don't have celebrate the things you do have and i'm surrounded by heroes and wonderful
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:47.720]  people like golf i bowl i run and i'm dance with my wife and i'm just leading a fantastic life well
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:53.880]  my father uh his dad was in world war two and flew bombers but then uh after he flew his
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:59.480]  22 missions he was on the ground in italy when he saw a lot of kids with arms and legs blown off
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:03.960]  and my dad ever once in a while would complain wanting some new shoes or whatever not wanting
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:10.120]  to go milk the cows at 4 30 in the morning and he would say you know to my dad you know i saw a man
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:15.320]  you know who was complaining that he had no shoes until he saw a man who had no feet and i mean i
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:20.360]  guess that parable certainly certainly uh you know fits in your story how did it change your
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:27.400]  outlook on life losing both your arms and legs actually i'm not don't get me wrong i'd love to
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:33.000]  have my hands and feet back but i'm actually enjoying life more right now i mean there's
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.640]  so many fantastic people out there that i've met and that i've helped and that have helped me
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:43.880]  and i don't i don't know who was sigmund Freud or whoever but there's no better feeling in this
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:49.640]  world than to help someone else that's that's the good feeling in life uh and you were talking
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:54.440]  about your parents uh my parents were very very instrumental in my attitude my dad was on board
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:59.320]  the uss oklahoma and pearl harbour when the japanese came in he was a musician and was actually
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:05.240]  leading the band in the national anthem my mom was a rheumatoid arthritic as as crippled up as
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:09.960]  you could possibly be with it but if you ever talked to her on the phone she would never complain
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:14.280]  and she'd say how you feeling today and she said i heard the little bit that's about as much
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:20.840]  complaint as she would do so i don't i don't my family isn't a complaining family and we get up
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:25.480]  we brush ourselves off and we get right back to the batter's box again well that's that's that's
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:30.040]  what not just the american way that's the human way and you know the globalists want to make us
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:34.520]  all a bunch of victims so they can control us and they're not there trying to give us a hand up they
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:39.880]  want to they actually want to cut our legs off and give us a pair of crutches i know pun intended
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:45.960]  there sir uh look i i know you don't want to sit here and bash on people but look it's got to be
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:51.000]  done i was on a tv show last week and they were going after the tsa people and i said how about the
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.520]  politicians and since obama's gotten in office and i'm just giving credit where it's due that's
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:02.600]  where all the groping and everything is accelerated and he could stop it and and the idea that we're
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:08.440]  just going to blame the tsa i mean i get that that's wrong and i tend to do that myself because
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:12.600]  that's where the rubber meets the road but what you're going through flying every week or so
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:18.680]  to go on speaking engagements and they know you and they put you through all this and i see it
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:23.560]  with other people you know 95 year old women going home to die with cancer and trying to make them
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:28.920]  get out of wheelchairs stripping them i mean this isn't i'd rather have terrorists blow a bunch of
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:34.840]  stuff up than live like this and since when did americans say take all my liberty to keep me safe
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:42.280]  i think i agree with you on that uh it wouldn't bother me so much if everybody didn't know me on
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:47.080]  a first name basis we walk up to the gate they say hey jeff where are you going today and as soon
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:52.600]  as i get on the other side of that uh metal detector here comes the guy with the rubber
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:58.520]  gloves and i'll be the smile's gone he says all right i want to know who approached you was it
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:05.800]  the taglia or barcini and it just bugs me every time they have to assume that i've changed since
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:13.560]  the last time they went over me i have to fill out so much personal information to even buy my tickets
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:19.480]  can't they just check that out and pull me aside if a flag goes up i just don't understand why
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:29.240]  every time i have to get a full once over well this is guilty until proven innocent and it's
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:35.320]  overthrowing our common law and constitutional system the idea that you're all guilty and we're
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:39.320]  going to put you through this and we know there's nothing in your background you're already run
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:45.320]  through the check but now we're going to do this to you and now the tsa is actually expanding out
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:51.560]  on the roads of america yeah and how have my prosthetics changed since the last time you
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:56.440]  swapped me over and helped me up nothing's changed the only possible thing is if someone
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:02.600]  who have gotten to me and paid me off i mean that that's an awful big jump right there that's the
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:07.160]  only possible way that i would be any different the next time i go to the airport if there's
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:11.880]  someone bright me and then talk me into blowing up a plane then that's not going to happen
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:19.880]  incredible well also notice what zero tolerance in school does they have seen this like 20 times
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:27.560]  as it keeps happening over the last decade where it's career day and it's always somebody's dad is
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:34.600]  in the military or they're they're a police officer it's always the same and they say you know draw a
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:39.400]  picture in art class of your parents and what they do i remember doing that and they draw their dad
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:43.800]  is in the marines or they draw you know their mom or whoever is a police officer with a gun
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:49.240]  and they arrest them or kick them out of school and they go well it's zero tolerance where the
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:56.120]  teachers aren't able to make their own decisions it's a default and they want that mindless robotic
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:01.320]  following orders and that's what tsa is about they know you're not a terrorist they know you they
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:05.960]  meet you every week so it's this idea of we're not going to violate just one group's right
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:12.040]  we're going to violate everybody and that makes it fair yeah i agree with you i was a teacher for
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:17.160]  30 years and there's certain things that i did because i was told to do but there's also certain
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:23.080]  things that i refuse to do uh what common sense has to take place someplace along the line
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:31.080]  so where do you go from here uh what do you mean traveling or with my life
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:37.560]  with the tsa yes i'm just i'm just going to comply i'm not i'm not going to make waves about it uh
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:41.880]  i hope they you know they don't think i'm i'm jumping on them it
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:47.640]  that there's only one time that i really became angry with them and they had given me the full
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:54.280]  check over and let me go and i so i went to my gate and they hunted me down and brought me all
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:58.760]  the way back saying they needed to check some more things out and they made me take each prosthetic
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:05.800]  on every limb turning in a quarter of a turn so they could x-ray it again and i almost missed
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:12.680]  my flight because of that and that's and the guy that was doing it was was really obnoxious but
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:20.200]  99 out of 100 tsa people i've dealt with have been very apologetic very nice and most of them
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:27.320]  have encouraged me to fill out a complaint card well that's what happens to me i fly some and they
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:33.160]  either want my autograph and say look it's just a job we're trying to unionize and change this
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:39.080]  but other times i've had him get in my face and go this is alex jones he's a troublemaker
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:44.360]  and i'm like you're actually in america trying to intimidate me now you don't intimidate me
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:52.040]  with your so-called authority you want to be ashamed of the misuse of power and i understand
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:57.480]  you fly a lot and and you love helping people with your story so but the fact that you're
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:01.960]  wanting to hey i hope they don't come after me i hope they let me fly you know because i'm speaking
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:09.160]  about him bro this is america and you've got tell us what you really think about it well i'm i feel
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:15.160]  offended and i feel like my freedoms have been jeopardized because of this but i'm not blaming
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:21.080]  the tsa individuals i believe they are told from the higher ups to do what they're doing of course
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:25.320]  they are yeah they're not allowed to have any discretion and if they don't do it they'll hire
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:32.280]  someone in their place who will so it's it's like the uh oh jeez i hate to i hate to make this strong
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:38.280]  of comparison but it's like nazi germany it's it's my my superior officers told me to do this
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:41.640]  if i don't do it then i'm done i'm up to the russian front
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:49.880]  well you're right in the russian front boy that was not fun but but that's where appeasing the system
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:55.400]  ends up that finally when you're forced to say no it's off to the russian front we need to say no
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:04.200]  now before stuff gets really really bad you know uh it's two things uh that kind of really
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:09.400]  chapped my height about this they haven't caught anybody yet doing this they haven't caught one
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:15.960]  person from boarding the plane yet they've had a the underwear bomber they've had the uh the guy
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:21.720]  with the the fuse in his shoe get on one there's a group out there that intentionally tries to
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:31.000]  smuggle things on and they actually smuggled a uh 1930s style tommy gun onto a plane and that
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:38.120]  wasn't picked up on the screening so what good is it doing it's training you that unbonded
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:45.000]  unsworn non-peace officers can violate the fourth and tenth amendment and operate anywhere in the
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:50.440]  country and it's training the american people and their children to line up uh at the gestapo
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:50:00.520]  checkpoint i agree but i'm not blaming the tsa people well i'll say this it is a cop out in
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:05.720]  the final equation to blame them we should blame ourselves letting the congress and the executive
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:11.320]  branch and the courts and the state governments put up with this i agree uh
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:19.080]  uh what can we do as a nation to do something about this you know that's an important question
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:23.560]  when we come back in the next little short segment i want to talk about some ideas i have for
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:28.440]  solutions and then i want you to think during this whole three minute break you bet and we can
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:32.120]  we can discuss that because it's one thing to complain about this one thing is people aren't
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:36.600]  flying as much and that's why you've got the Orlando airport seeing a big loss in tourism
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:41.720]  saying we want the tsa out and then maybe bring private groups in there could be competition
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:48.440]  on who could do it the better you know uh fashion but again the feds do not have the power to order
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:55.080]  that small children have their genitals grabbed by men and women i mean it's illegal so it needs
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:51:02.920]  to stop we'll be right back with our guest jeff lewis stay with us i had tried everything i'd
[01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:08.120]  cut back the amount of food i was eating i was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:13.160]  my body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as
[01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:19.720]  soon as i had that i immediately could eat half of what i was eating previously and be satisfied

[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:37.160]  motivational speaker and gets the uh once over and the twice over and the thrice over everywhere
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:45.080]  he goes solutions we've got to get people elected that will curtail and back off what the tsa is
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:50.760]  doing this federal power grab we've got to get our state houses to pass legislation and when texas
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:55.960]  passed it in the house last year unanimously and the senate was about to to just ban the tsa
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:55:00.360]  touching people inappropriately because it's already illegal the feds threatened an armed blockade
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:05.400]  well go ahead and do it then i mean that type of threat of pure tyranny just go ahead and get it
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:11.560]  done now because let's get that out in the open they could have never have carried that out not
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:17.000]  like this is libya uh that would have exposed them they would have had to back off kind of like
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.160]  if they're able to kick rush limbaugh off the air they're going to get emboldened to shut everybody
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:26.760]  down see even though i'm up against rush limbaugh i understand that i understand if he went off
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:31.960]  the air i'd get a lot of more affiliates very quickly but i don't want that because it's at
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:37.240]  the expense of the first amendment so we hang together or hang separate uh there are other
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:43.880]  things we can do uh what are your ideas jeff of what we can do here well i got a very simple
[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:50.520]  solution actually uh every time my wife and i fly we buy our tickets online and we have to fill out
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:57.560]  a lot of very very personal information just to get those tickets isn't that information available to
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:04.440]  the airlines and wouldn't that tell them whether they need to pull me aside and and give me the
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:08.920]  once over when i get to the airport they say hey we got something here we need to talk to you about
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:13.800]  otherwise let me go right on through sorry your background's okay you hop right on that's right
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:20.440]  if you don't have reasonable suspicion then there is no excuse to mess with people that is the basic
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:26.600]  common law of the world over for thousands of years take this reported shooter who conveniently was
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:33.320]  killed over during the election uh sarcosi's got a 10 point bounce out of it it turns out for two
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:38.440]  years they knew all about it women had warned them girlfriends he'd gone to afghanistan they knew
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:47.960]  what he was doing and that he had guns and they just let him do it oh yeah what and the the
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:55.640]  uh the hardest thing for me to stomach is the second third fourth fifteenth twentieth hundredth
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:57:02.360]  time they checked me over as if i've never been checked before i mean how many times they have
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:07.480]  to check me over say hey this guy's clean let him go well sir as you know they pull colostomy
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:13.560]  bags off people and say what's this and i mean i've had him ask me what a canon camera is it's
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:19.240]  got canon on it looks like the classic 35 millimeter camera and i literally say is that a joke this is
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:25.560]  that repeatedly you know what that is you know i had i had contact with a woman uh who was detained
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:30.760]  because of her she had separate breast milk and she didn't want it to go through the x-ray machine
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:36.920]  and they they detained her so long that she missed her flight this was like 50 minutes they held her
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:42.040]  decided what to do this breast milk they finally said you either let us x-ray it or you have to
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:49.720]  dump it out in the meantime her baby is starving so that's gone that's going over the line oh no
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:54.360]  they make them drink it to prove it's theirs or they make them breast pump it out to show them
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:58.920]  do you didn't hear about that a month ago oh i did not hear about that i'm not kidding but i mean
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:02.600]  i think she would have been glad to taste it for him i think she would have been more than happy
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:08.040]  to but she stood there in that glass booth for for 15 minutes while they were trying to decide
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:13.400]  what to do with her breast milk it's all just training us to put up with anything uh jeff louis

[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:40.840]  okay coming up i mentioned this but it is a big deal because it's the plan for the united states
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:47.240]  charcoasy prosecute in prison readers of extremist websites also we the people demand a full-scale
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:51.560]  investigation of the eligibility requirements of the president obama to be president to run again
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:56.120]  for a second term we're going to be talking about that coming to a head and more i'm also
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:59.800]  getting into this shooting outside orlando and how they're openly trying to create
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:05.240]  race war in this country with this tragedy obama is shameless saying he looks like the sun i never
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:10.600]  had the poor guy that got shot this is incredible but right now let's go to christin new jersey
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:15.720]  then gorgos shad john franklin and others christ you're on the air thanks for holding
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:22.280]  hey alex how's it going pretty good uh i just you know what i noticed what you're saying about
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:27.960]  uh just what's happening i mean the police department a lot of them i'm against all of them
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:33.400]  but most of them in my area they're just they're just getting you know violating people's rights
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:41.480]  and i'm in control and it's just it's just terrible i mean it's just like you have no freedom anymore well
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:46.520]  people are waking up though i've got reports that guns are selling so fast factories are so far
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:54.040]  behind producing guns they're having to suspend the new manufacturer for now or or or new orders
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:02:01.080]  while they catch up i mean it's like an armed camp in this country and i wish people would put that
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:05.240]  energy i think it's great they got more firearms that's a good insurance policy but
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:09.560]  yeah i bet they better train with them too and think about their rules of engagement too not just
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:16.120]  buy a bunch of guns or they're near worthless um but people should also fight in the info or hard
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:23.160]  core before you ever think about starting a shooting war definitely i mean these cops
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:28.200]  don't just violate your constitutional right they just they just like nazi germany you feel and
[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:33.320]  when i was a kid i mean the police department where i live was never like that now i mean
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:39.720]  they're pretty disgusting i mean i'm sitting here live in new jersey and they're it varies but i mean
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:47.400]  when i've read new jersey i mean they do whatever they want yeah that's what i heard because i mean
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:52.440]  somebody told me they lived out in texas over there and that the police weren't as harassing at the
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:58.360]  police in new jersey i don't know if that's true i don't know this guy was telling me from here he
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:05.240]  lived say that again say that again this guy was outside of dallas and he told me the police weren't
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:11.000]  as harassing the people as they are in new jersey well dallas is pretty darn dangerous and i've got
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:16.600]  to be honest about the police in dallas um they're so busy they're not out writing as many tickets
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:22.040]  as places like austin i mean let me tell you in dallas is downright dangerous i go up there
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:27.880]  sometimes and especially downtown and stuff i've had people really aggressive panhandlers slash
[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:32.920]  muggers that i was about to have to punch in the face repeatedly uh and then all of a sudden a cop
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:38.120]  just pops out of nowhere i mean they're on it in dallas i'm not saying they're perfect but uh i've
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:43.720]  actually been in dallas i don't know six or seven eight times doing video shoots the last decade
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:49.000]  where repeatedly i've got aggressive people to me and my camera guys trying to shake us down
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:55.320]  and like a jack in the box a cop just goes boing i mean you talk about johnny on the spot uh in
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:04:01.720]  areas of dallas because dallas has always been in a pretty serious city but uh yeah i know some
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:08.440]  areas you get a bad culture and the union gets in control and you get really out of control police
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:14.280]  and you get a culture of thugs also it depends where police work when they work around really
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:18.840]  bad areas they also tend to just get to where they see everybody as criminals they get exhausted
[02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:23.960]  like the six street cops a lot of them uh the ones of the bikes aren't too bad but sometimes there's
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:28.680]  these shaved head you know tattooed type guys i'm profiling because that's what i've seen
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:34.200]  who are just starting fights kind of the tough guy type black gloves shaking people down hitting
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:39.640]  on hot girls getting in people's faces for no reason telling folks they can't videotape and
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:43.000]  i've had some run-ins with them and i mean you look at them and i'm like man you're like a
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:52.600]  right head bouncer they're like i was a bouncer better watch it jones uh and i mean uh but i mean
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:58.120]  it's those types that just really make police look bad more calls straight ahead stay with us

[02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:52.600]  We're here, ladies and gentlemen, Monday through Friday, tip of the spear in the Info War.
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:57.080]  Knowledge is power and the truth trumps any lie.
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:58.080]  Do you want the truth?
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:08:59.080]  Do you need it?
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:00.080]  Do you need it?

[02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:08.760]  end.
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:11.680]  Go, ladies and gentlemen, come to我.
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:13.320]  In the end, burn it and church.
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:14.320]  Laugh it out, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:15.320]  We are live into our number three wide-open phones today.
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:19.040]  Let me get one news item, because I was just mentioning in the last segment just to back
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:21.480]  up what I'm saying, because you know I'm neurotic about that.
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:29.440]  a press release from Ruger put out yesterday afternoon. Effective immediately, Ruger has
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:35.400]  stopped accepting firearms orders. The company says that they have had to temporarily suspend
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:41.640]  the acceptance of new orders. I got a stockpile more myself after receiving requests for more
[02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:54.200]  than one million units in one month. That's one of hundreds of companies. This is keeping
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:10:00.760]  our economy going right here. Ladies and gentlemen, I did the numbers a month ago. The previous
[02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:08.360]  record for gun sales from like 1994 when Clint was trying to ban semi-autos, that doubled
[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:14.680]  in the six months before Obama got elected and then continued and then roughly doubled
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:20.040]  again right at doubled and then now more than doubled and now the new numbers coming in.
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:27.720]  It has reached pandemonium. I want to warn the globalist and I know they're spying and
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:33.120]  they've got actuaries and computer algorithms. I know they know this. Let me explain something.
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:39.280]  You could steal the election from Ron Paul in Iowa, Maine, South Carolina and Nevada
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:42.840]  and then people said, oh, well, he's not winning and I better go over somebody that is a winner.
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:46.680]  But he was the front runner up front. That's why they said he couldn't win and gave him
[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:50.720]  the least amount of time. I mean, Ron Paul was the front runner. That shows that conservatives
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:57.280]  have woken up and are becoming constitutionalist now and he's staying in there to keep educating
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:03.640]  folks. That's a great idea. But you go look at the numbers. Four years ago when he was
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:11.760]  not even as well known as now and this year and last year, Ron Paul is always over 70%
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:18.200]  of all Republican donations, even when there were eight candidates and Obama combined.
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:22.760]  All the military given to Obama, Ron Paul gets more. All the Republicans, Ron Paul got
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:28.280]  more. Now that's starting to not happen because the military is going, well, I guess Santorum
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:32.200]  or Mitt Romney might be better if that's their statement, not mine. Now a lot of folks are
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:38.400]  still sticking with Ron Paul and that's great. And is he going to run for a third party?
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:46.800]  Who knows? I probably not. The point is that the military's waken up. The police, I talked
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:52.880]  to them, they're waken up and the public's waken up. Those that know how to tie their
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:56.960]  shoe laces. You got folks that watch sitcoms all day and literally, you know, don't know
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:00.200]  their head from the whole of the ground. People don't count. They've never counted. They never
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:05.560]  will count. Let's get that straight. I could take 5% of this country if they were highly
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:11.360]  motivated and actually followed plans I've developed myself and the people actually executed
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:17.880]  100%, 5% could sweep the globalist without firing a shot. The problem is the globalist
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:23.840]  would then fire shots and try to make it physical. And if that goes to that, their plan is to
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:28.360]  let civil war death mass shootings rage and just let us kind of bake. That's what they
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:33.040]  do in the third world for a year or two. And then people will beg later because of the
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:38.040]  total depression for control. I don't think that's going to happen either because we're
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:42.000]  going to get the word out who did it. They could kill me tomorrow and I hope they don't.
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:46.160]  And you don't think this mission is going to continue. You don't think the word's already
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:51.400]  not out. You think people are waken up now and our credibility is just golden triple
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:58.360]  platinum right now. It's going to go supernova when they go to the next phases of this. That's
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:01.360]  why they got a meme out that Alex Jones doesn't know what he's talking about. None of it's
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:07.080]  coming true because it's all coming true with precision and their system is freaking out
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:15.440]  because myself and many others hit the bar bar decades ago back when nobody was talking
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:24.960]  about this and we sounded like five headed Martians from planet pop snout. So it's on
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:38.640]  right now. It's on. It's on big time. And there is a globalist takeover of America.
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:45.200]  You're living in what is either the final days of this republic and a nightmare technocratic
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:58.680]  genetic engineer bio weapon freak show mad scientist madhouse psychopath party land. You're
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:04.840]  either living in the final days of the republic and hell that'll make Stalin Hitler Mao Pol
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:17.800]  Pot look like choir boys. You're either living in those days the beginning of that or 1776
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:23.640]  freedom destiny awakening worldwide. There's a reason that the globalists are getting ready
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:27.160]  to accelerate total tyranny. Well, they're already now keep saying getting ready. We're
[02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:33.080]  now into the acceleration and it's acceleration. It just gets getting wilder. I mean, you scrap
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:40.080]  yourselves in because this is it. You're going to start seeing stuff get crazier and crazier
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:44.280]  and crazier. And I keep saying this. You see it getting crazier and crazier and crazier
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:50.080]  and still crazier and then crazier. And you're going to see all this tech they've got lined
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:57.040]  up in bed and everything the casual society rolling out bio flesh eating bacteria all
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:04.480]  of it. Question is, will they fully implement they won't fully implement if their algorithm
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:08.360]  show they're not going to win. And that's why they're only doing little shootings and
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:13.480]  stuff to get Sarkozy elected and Obama's like seizing on natural events and going, oh, that's
[02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:17.960]  like my son that got killed to make it like he's the victim. He lost his son. He knows
[02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:22.640]  at a subconscious level. He's claiming him as a son. So it's like Obama lost his son.
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:28.320]  I mean, it's just pure. This is government run by technocratic psychiatrist and genetic
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:34.120]  engineers and mathematicians. And the Holy Grail is future prediction systems. Google's
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:40.440]  all over the news admitting that. I mean, these guys, these guys are getting demigod powers
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:44.680]  out of technology, but they're still humans. And because they're evil, they're they're
[02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:49.400]  not fully developed humans. So they think they're understanding, but they they have
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:16:00.920]  power and cunning, but not wisdom. That's smarts and basic knowledge or IQ test is
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:12.160]  not wisdom. Those are two different things. An ounce of wisdom is worth a thousand gallons
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:21.360]  of smarts, smarts alone or just raw data crunching. Evil people look in two or three levels and
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:26.640]  the globalists know this. So they try to look out into further models, but they delude themselves
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:33.920]  that they're going to be able to manage this and you're not. You are so wrong. You are
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:45.280]  so horribly wrong about what you're doing. Here it is from Ruger and company, Inc. NASDAQ
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:50.520]  RGR announced today that for the first quarter, 2012, the company's received orders for more
[02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:55.560]  than one million. And if you backdate this to reports, I've seen it's like a million
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:59.480]  in the first months. That's why they're stopping. That's why I said a million a month, but one
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:02.960]  of this three months. Therefore, the company has temporarily suspended the acceptance of
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:10.120]  new orders. That'll only make it 10 times worse. Chief Executive Officer Michael O.
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:14.240]  Pfeiffer made the following comments. The company's retailer programs that were offered
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:18.640]  from January 1st, 012 through 29th, 2012 were very successful and generated significant
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:23.200]  orders for retailers to independent wholesale distributors for Ruger firearms. Here to
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:26.960]  date, the independent wholesale distributors placed orders with the company for more than
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:33.080]  one million Ruger firearms. That's so sexy. Despite the company's continued successful
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:39.840]  efforts to increase production rates. Oh yeah, Liberty's sexy folks. Well, you know, it gets
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:47.960]  my heart beating freedom. People waking up is like watching Marilyn Monroe stand out
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:18:01.440]  there with that winds blowing up under her dress. Oh man. Still my heart. Oh man. And
[02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:09.280]  it just goes on. They say by May they might be able to be caught up. We'll see. Emergency
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:15.520]  foods all flying off. By the way, if you do want to get the highest quality storeable
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:19.840]  foods, this isn't even a plug here. They're a big sponsor. EatFoodsDirect.com. It's the
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:25.440]  best place out there. It makes me mad. There's a lot of crud being sold. That's how I found
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:29.680]  EatFoods. I bought like three different places and it was MSG. It was like 10 years old.
[02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:34.920]  Repackage. They said it was new. Fly by night garbage. And then I found EatFoods, the biggest
[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:38.760]  oldest company. There's all these liars that say they're older. It's pure bull. EatFoods
[02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:42.720]  is the place to get your storeable food. The lightest spectrum, EatFoodsDirect.com. Tell
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:48.200]  them Alex Jones sent you. And separately, everybody needs to get a pro-pure water filtration
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:52.720]  system. It's heads above. We have all the specs at infowars.com, the shopping cart area
[02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:57.000]  with the five different filters we offer. We have a 10% discount. Our price is already
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:00.640]  the lowest when you purchase. It does support us, obviously. We're free market here. We're
[02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:04.480]  not revolutionary. We're restorationist. So we don't rob banks to fund ourselves. We

[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:30.000]  out there. Pro-pure at infowars.com. And if you type in the product code WATER, WATER.
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:34.240]  In there, you get 10% off the already low price on the pro-pure gravity-fed filters
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:39.480]  that blow the competition away. Go look at the leading competitors' numbers stacked up
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:44.560]  against pro-pure. And again, the others will do just fine for you. You want something that
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:50.480]  works better, looks better, has bigger filters, fluoride filters, everything. Beautiful glass
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:56.960]  spickets you can see at the water level, a lot of other features. It just blows the competition
[02:19:56.960 --> 02:20:01.320]  away at infowars.com. Pro-pure, you're called straight ahead.
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:06.080]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had
[02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:10.360]  a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known
[02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:15.000]  fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:20.480]  the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:25.520]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and
[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:31.320]  be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered
[02:20:31.320 --> 02:20:36.520]  Yongevity. The Yongevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:42.400]  once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've lost 37 pounds
[02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:48.080]  in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need. Check it out for yourself.
[02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:53.600]  It's incredible. Go to infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy

[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:05.200]  Hi, Jason Lewis here. Anybody who's been listening to my program knows how shaky the
[02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:10.600]  U.S. economy is right now. Will we have a V-shaped recovery or will it be a W-shaped
[02:21:10.600 --> 02:21:15.120]  one where the nation slips back into recession? Of course, if you think that Washington can
[02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:19.320]  spend or inflate its way out of a downturn, you've got nothing to worry about. But as
[02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:24.720]  you know, I have my doubts. So let me tell you about gold. Now, as my friend Ted Anderson
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:30.040]  from Midas Resources likes to say, gold, like all commodity markets, fluctuates in price
[02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:34.560]  and you could lose money, but it has never been worth zero. Give it some thought and
[02:21:34.560 --> 02:21:38.800]  if you're interested in converting your IRA to gold or would like to actually have it
[02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:46.280]  in your possession, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237. The U.S. dollar was once
[02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:51.000]  backed by gold, but has since lost 90% of its value and if things don't change, I'm
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:58.520]  afraid the trend will continue. Call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237 for gold
[02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:05.640]  and tell them Jason Lewis sent you. Are you still a traditional smoker? Now, experience

[02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:04.760]  What is the most abundant resource on earth? Water. It's essential for sustaining life,
[02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:08.600]  but it's not always the most available. When disaster strikes, water quickly vanishes
[02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:13.760]  from store shelves. Like it did during 9-11, Katrina, Japan and in Joplin, three days without
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:18.040]  water and your body begins to shut down. Don't risk being without an abundant supply of water
[02:23:18.040 --> 02:23:22.480]  when the next disaster hits. Get a flowjack hand well pump. The affordable flowjack drops
[02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:26.880]  right into almost any well and is easy to install without having to remove the existing
[02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:30.880]  pump, giving you immediate access to plenty of cool, clean water. You could risk your
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:35.280]  family's health on a limited supply of stored water, or you could be prepared with the reliable,
[02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:41.720]  affordable flowjack backup hand pump kit for only $3.99 complete. See how it works at flowjack.com.

[02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:43.800]  All right, Alex. Actually, I think Gorgogo was an England Godzilla movie from the 80s.
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:49.800]  There you go. I knew it. Gorgogo. Guys, Google Gorgogo. Let's put Gorgogo on screen while
[02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:53.800]  this guy. That's a cool name. I like it. I wasn't knocking it. I like it. That's powerful.
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:25:00.800]  That name has given me a long time ago. Gorgogo the Magnificent. Gorgogo vs. King Kong. Go
[02:25:00.800 --> 02:25:07.800]  ahead. I'm calling actually about when you were referring to Prometheus. I'm an old
[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:12.800]  Giger fan. In fact, I'm going off the subject real quick. I'm the one who sent you that
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:17.800]  Cobra Commander costume back in January. Thank you very much.
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:21.800]  That's the point of my software. Just wanted to... No, no, you made a really nice Cobra
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:26.800]  Commander outfit. You sent it to us. It was too small for me, so I put it on to Jacobson,
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:30.800]  a really nice uniform, and then he played the part of my Lieutenant, but then I put on
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:33.800]  the other outfit you gave me. We did a little Cobra Commander for you.
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:38.800]  Yeah, that was great. That was awesome. Anyway, I'm an old Giger fan, and I've really
[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:47.800]  changed my perspective on things since I've become awake. Anyway, I've been in a lot of
[02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:57.800]  special effects artists, and we've seen a lot of Giger stuff. Somebody gave me a book
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:02.800]  called... Necronomicon. He put one out called Necronomicon.
[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:09.800]  Well, there's this one called www.hrgiger.com, and it has this page in there. I'm going to
[02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:16.800]  send it to you guys, this page, or at least maybe look it up. This page says a Swiss
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:26.800]  transit tunnel that Giger had designed back in 93, and it's a big pentagram plan. He had
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:34.800]  sent this design to... You say a Swiss tunnel? What kind of tunnel? It was called... Officially
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:43.800]  it's called the STT Swiss transit tunnel underground at half-hour intervals. Now, I know he
[02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:48.800]  designs a lot of stuff, and he's designing the new monsters for this new movie, and it's
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:53.800]  total Illuminati stuff. Yeah, that guy puts out some really satanic, very powerful stuff.
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:27:01.800]  It's archetypal. That's why it freaks people out so bad. But Swiss transit tunnel, and
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:03.800]  I don't see it yet.
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:13.800]  At each point of the pentagram of this, he had plans for pyramids at each point where
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:23.800]  conjunctions... It's pretty dark. I mean, Giger is pretty much the architect of hell.
[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:30.800]  Yeah, I'm looking for it. I'm on his site, and I know it's listed on here, so I'll find
[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:37.800]  it, and we'll put it up. Guys, search HR, Giger, Giger, Swiss transit tunnel, and it'll come
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:42.800]  up in images, so we can put that on screen for prismplanet.tv viewers. For folks that
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:48.800]  don't know about it, out there, tell folks who Giger is, and of course, who the legendary
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:55.800]  director of the original alien, not the other cheesy ones, is Ridley Scott.
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:28:07.800]  Yeah, Giger is very famous for his biomechanical designs. For Dune, he even did the tequila
[02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:17.800]  worm for Polar Geist, too. I respect him as an artist, but he's got some dark stuff.
[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:20.800]  He's the species alien.
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:27.800]  He's super duper satanic and very archetypal, and his biomechanical drawings, it's really
[02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:36.800]  nasty, and extreme satanic type stuff. Then his wife commits suicide or something. I mean,
[02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:40.800]  just all this darkness around him. You can see it. I mean, talk about somebody you want
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:48.800]  to be in the movies playing an evil person. I mean, he just radiates, and I've seen photos
[02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:54.800]  of a crew, too. I don't want to get anywhere near it. I want the opposite. But see, that's
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:59.800]  what they're doing. They're imitating death life. It's like ugly death that spawns its
[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:05.800]  own life, and that's what these satanists really want. That's what the genetic engineering
[02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:11.800]  is, and they love ugliness. They love the twisting of children. That's why a lot of us things
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:16.800]  are like disease, rotting demon children. Schwarzenegger, I know, is a big fan of it, and a lot
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:21.800]  of dark, spinoff art. Schwarzenegger, I came across him in an art gallery saying it was
[02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:26.800]  his favorite art, like dead children killed in car wrecks. He pays for photographs of
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:31.800]  that and stuff, and little babies mangled in car wrecks. Schwarzenegger goes into his
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:36.800]  private office and looks at that all day, and little girls dressed up in Nazi outfits laying
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:45.800]  on beds. It's very sick. I'll take life. That's what I choose. We'll be right back. Stay with
[02:29:45.800 --> 02:29:47.800]  me.
[02:30:15.800 --> 02:30:22.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:30:45.800 --> 02:30:52.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:31:15.800 --> 02:31:22.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:31:45.800 --> 02:31:52.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:32:15.800 --> 02:32:22.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:33:00.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:35.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:33:35.800 --> 02:34:00.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:07.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:56.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:34:56.800 --> 02:35:22.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:48.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:35:48.800 --> 02:36:14.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:43.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:37:12.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:38.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:37:38.800 --> 02:37:53.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:37:53.800 --> 02:38:19.800]  We'll be right back.
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:25.800]  I agree. I recently found myself on the front lines of the fight for the First Amendment.
[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:34.800]  I was at a St. Patrick's Day parade, and I expressed my displeasure of how an officer was
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:40.800]  conducting himself with some people, and I didn't say anything to him. I was only talking to the
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:45.800]  people, and he overheard me talking to him, and he came back over.
[02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:51.800]  He heard you talking in America? What do you think this is? Land of the free home of the brave?
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:55.800]  This is land of the bioengineered subslave.
[02:38:55.800 --> 02:39:00.800]  Well, he came over and told me to shut my mouth and mind my own business, boy.
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:03.800]  Good. You are a boy of this government.
[02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:10.800]  I looked at him and I said, well, First Amendment to the Constitution, you know,
[02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:15.800]  I write freedom of speech, and he said, yeah, it does. And he immediately came around and arrested me
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:17.800]  for disorderly conduct.
[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:20.800]  Well, whatever. You know, they hire people that it's all about.
[02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:25.800]  Sometimes it's all about the exercise authority, and what was he saying to the people?
[02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:30.800]  What was he doing, you know, I guess on a piranha-type power trip?
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:31.800]  What was he doing?
[02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:41.800]  He was, it was, the people had a dog, and another man had walked into this, it was a fenced-in area,
[02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:47.800]  like where beer tents were, and this guy comes walking in with this nasty vile pit bull that immediately
[02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:53.800]  went for these other people's dog, and that guy drags his dog away, you know, into the crowd,
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:59.800]  and the cop came over and told the people whose dog was sitting there calmly, told him that
[02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:04.800]  they couldn't control their dog, that he was going to remove them both, and have them put in jail,
[02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:06.800]  and the dog would be taken to the pound and destroyed.
[02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:11.800]  Well, that's horribly mean, so people have their nice dog, and instead of just talking to them,
[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:15.800]  or being lazy and not going after the other guy, he did that, and you said that's wrong,
[02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:17.800]  and he came and arrested you?
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:21.800]  I said it was BS. I actually used the S word.
[02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:24.800]  You know, that's probably not that good, but that's usually protected speech.
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:30.800]  So, I mean, when he puts you in the car, did he say, like, I've shown you, boy, or anything?
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:33.800]  Oh, he just went on and on.
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:36.800]  He said, next time you shut your mouth, won't you?
[02:40:36.800 --> 02:40:38.800]  He says, you need to go back to law school.
[02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:40.800]  I said, well, I never attended law school.
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:43.800]  Look, you need to go get a jury trial, and you need to file a complaint on him,
[02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:50.800]  and then you need to start a blog about him, and you need to start tracking what he's doing as a citizen reporter.
[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:54.800]  And because what matters is the long haul.
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:40:56.800]  This isn't a one-encounter event.
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:02.800]  What matters is, in the end, he knows the First Amendment's boss and learns respect for it.
[02:41:02.800 --> 02:41:06.800]  But I would go in and talk to Chief of Police, and they don't let you.
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:10.800]  I'd wait until there was a meet-and-greet, and I'd go to events, and I'd go to city council about it,
[02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:14.800]  and I would, you know, talk about how the guy had a pit bull here.
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:16.800]  You know, I got to say this about folks.
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:20.800]  People who like pit bulls, they're friendly dogs, whatever,
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:25.800]  but they have that switch in their brain where they are, you know, been bred and trained to just kill.
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:28.800]  They're killing kids all the time. They're attacking people's dogs.
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:32.800]  And let me tell you something. I go to the park sometimes, or I'm walking down the street.
[02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:36.800]  This has actually happened before, and these gangbanger types have the dog dragging along.
[02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:38.800]  They're getting off on it, scaring you.
[02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:44.800]  They're kind of similar to thug cops that get off on trying to scare you, and it's all I can do.
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:49.800]  Because when somebody's trying to threaten me, I become violent, and it's all I can do.
[02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:55.800]  I mean, I've actually said things before, and it's not good to not just attack them and their dog.
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:41:59.800]  And I don't understand who wants to go to public places where people have kids
[02:41:59.800 --> 02:42:02.800]  and have a dog that wants to attack people.
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:04.800]  What makes me want to attack you?
[02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:10.800]  And I just don't understand, but see, those are people that want to be tough.
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:15.800]  Anybody that actually has a mean streak is afraid of what they're going to do,
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:18.800]  compared to all these want-to-be-tough guys.
[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:21.800]  And I'm telling you, that's what's going to happen with the New World Order as well.
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:23.800]  They think they know human psychology.
[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:29.800]  If this stuff continues and a war breaks out, I mean, I just cannot even imagine what it's going to be like.
[02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:33.800]  I appreciate your call. Terrible story.
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:36.800]  John and Utah, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:43.800]  Yes, Alex. I've listened to you a couple of times when you've been on coast to coast with the originary.
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:48.800]  And both of you are lamenting the fact that you didn't know who to go to,
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:56.800]  who knew the truth about our income tax and its true nature, whether it was voluntary or mandatory, etc.
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:43:01.800]  You may have misunderstood what I was saying, because I've known all about the IRS
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:07.800]  being a collection agency with the Private Federal Reserve, 1913, with the Federal Reserve Act,
[02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:11.800]  not adopted for the general public till a wartime tax in World War II.
[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:17.800]  So, I know it's a fraud. So, I mean, you can make your point, but you must have gotten me mixed up with somebody else.
[02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:19.800]  Good to have you listening. Go ahead.
[02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:24.800]  Well, anyway, I had the same quandary, like, 30-plus years ago.
[02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:33.800]  And I've studied all that you're talking there, but I also spent thousands and thousands of hours in the law library
[02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:37.800]  studying, you know, this whole thing and its background.
[02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:45.800]  And the reason that the Supreme Court has held that the government's, the Treasury Department's,
[02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:52.800]  summary procedures, new to due process, is a case back in the 1856.
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:59.800]  And they said, it was the first case they ever considered the meaning of the due process cause of the Fifth Amendment.
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:10.800]  And they determined that to mute due process, the process had to correspond with the process that was in effect in England
[02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:13.800]  at the time that the Fifth Amendment was ratified.
[02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:20.800]  And having done that, then they went back into the Old English treatises on the Revenue Laws of England
[02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:27.800]  of that period and found out that what this corresponds to is what was known as the Statute Staple.
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:33.800]  Now, the Statute Staple was a contract written in accordance with the provisions of the enactment
[02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:38.800]  in Parliament in 1353 entitled the Statute for the Staple.
[02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:43.800]  Those days, all those laws in England were written in French and stapled as a market.
[02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:45.800]  So this was the statute for the marketplace.
[02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:49.800]  Yes, it's a commerce clause.
[02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:53.800]  It's all maritime and that's what the city of London within London is.
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:45:04.800]  And actually, our IRS is modeled after what is the Inland Revenue Corporation that is England's IRS tax group.
[02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:12.800]  Well, anyway, yes, if you look at the tax code, it's laid out step by step as this contract was.
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:16.800]  And they don't tell you how you volunteer and what the contract is.
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:27.800]  And what it comes down to is the 1040 is, in fact, by its form, you can tell it's a Statute Staple contract.
[02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:29.800]  That's a voluntary contract.
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:31.800]  But here's the problem, sir.
[02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:36.800]  It's just like in the 50s they introduce and say, you're no longer a church.
[02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:38.800]  You're a charity.
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:39.800]  You're under 501c3.
[02:45:39.800 --> 02:45:40.800]  Don't worry.
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:41.800]  You still don't pay taxes.
[02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:46.800]  And the denominations ordered their sub-churches to sign on, then that waives rights.
[02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:52.800]  Whereas under First Amendment, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, prohibiting them for exercise thereof.
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:54.800]  That's the beginning of the First Amendment.
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:46:08.800]  So it's, again, once people then adopted it, they create brainwashed cores of enforcers and dumbed-down juries that will send preachers to prison who don't have 501c3 in many cases.
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:12.800]  Just like they send people to prison who won't take vaccines, there's no law.
[02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:25.800]  It is just so they first start it as a contract fraud, but then they phase it in under common, accepted, custom, possession nine-tenths of the law.
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:30.800]  And just by force to juror, it's done by the barrel of a gun.
[02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:32.800]  Complete lawless garbage.
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:40.800]  In a statute sample contract, the debtor actually conveyed title to everything he owned.
[02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:41.800]  Yes.
[02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:46.800]  We sign on to be an indentured servitude clause, but what I'm saying, sir, is they're beyond that now.
[02:46:46.800 --> 02:46:50.800]  They just have armed police who believe whatever they're told.
[02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:55.800]  And a public running around picking their noses all day and, you know, slobbering, watching television.
[02:46:55.800 --> 02:46:58.800]  So I'm saying it's beyond that now.
[02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:04.800]  I've seen people, and I've had Red Beckman, Bill Benson, all of them that went around and proved it wasn't ratified, all of it.
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:06.800]  The problem is they don't care.
[02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:11.800]  I mean, they've got the Department of Education isn't even authorized to have guns.
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:20.800]  They now have SWAT teams kicking down doors for money when there's no law that you can be criminally charged for not paying a student loan debt.
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:21.800]  They just don't care.
[02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:23.800]  They've got juries ready to put you in jail.
[02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:28.800]  We've now entered because the public are in a jellyfish state.
[02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:29.800]  We've entered La La Land.
[02:47:29.800 --> 02:47:30.800]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:37.800]  What do you do when we enter a vector where anything is possible by the criminal class?
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:46.800]  Well, I understand what you're saying because of what I was teaching when I learned this stuff and was teaching at San Bernard back in 1992.
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:49.800]  They sent me to prison for what I was teaching.
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:55.800]  Exactly. They tried to put former Treasury agent in jail.
[02:47:55.800 --> 02:48:05.800]  Joe Bannister, who just spoke out against him, they arrested him and the jury found him not guilty because they've been programmed to worship somebody who's a sworn officer.
[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:14.800]  So the fact that he had this perfect record and was a clean cut, well-spoken guy and was just teaching CPA seminars, he was found not guilty.
[02:48:14.800 --> 02:48:16.800]  But usually you go to jail.
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:17.800]  There you go.
[02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:18.800]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:19.800]  What's your name?
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:20.800]  I'm curious.
[02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:22.800]  Are you known for talking about this stuff?
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:24.800]  Oh, I'm known along the page of the community.
[02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:26.800]  My name is John Benson.
[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:28.800]  And I've just finished a book.
[02:48:28.800 --> 02:48:31.800]  And I'd like an e-book explaining all of this.
[02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:32.800]  What's the name of it?
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:36.800]  I guarantee you that if you can get to five million people in America.
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:37.800]  What's the name of it?
[02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:39.800]  We'll get rid of the income tax.
[02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:41.800]  What's the name of your book?
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:45.800]  The name of the book is Taxation by Misrepresentation.
[02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:46.800]  Good name.
[02:48:46.800 --> 02:48:47.800]  God bless you.
[02:48:47.800 --> 02:48:49.800]  Well, people will check it out.
[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:50.800]  Thank you, sir.
[02:48:50.800 --> 02:48:51.800]  Maybe I'll have you on as a guest.
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:53.800]  Bill in Connecticut.
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:54.800]  Bill, you're on the air.
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:48:55.800]  Go ahead.
[02:48:55.800 --> 02:48:56.800]  Yeah.
[02:48:56.800 --> 02:48:57.800]  Hi, Alex.
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:48:58.800]  How are you?
[02:48:58.800 --> 02:48:59.800]  Good.
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:01.800]  I have several points, but I'll try to be brief on each one.
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:06.800]  Last night, I'm in the belly of the beast here in Fairfield County with the globalist.
[02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:10.800]  And I'm flipping around last night in around 1130.
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:16.800]  I saw your great interview with the great Aaron Russo, which was...
[02:49:16.800 --> 02:49:17.800]  It was so clear.
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:18.800]  It was like...
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:23.800]  It's not like the typical cable channels, those local things, because it was played on DVD.
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:26.800]  It looked like a regular news channel.
[02:49:26.800 --> 02:49:28.800]  So that was played for an hour.
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:32.800]  So you're getting through, and it's coming through here in the...
[02:49:32.800 --> 02:49:35.800]  And really the center of the cyclone, as far as I can...
[02:49:35.800 --> 02:49:40.800]  Yeah, the power of people, instead of just buying a bunch of guns, go out and wake the police up,
[02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:43.800]  instead of just preparing to kill people when they come to your house,
[02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:46.800]  which I got to warn the system, you guys are dead if you try this.
[02:49:46.800 --> 02:49:49.800]  I mean, the American people are going to destroy you.
[02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:51.800]  But the globalists will sit offshore.
[02:49:51.800 --> 02:49:52.800]  That's part of the plan.
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:58.800]  So all over the country, put stuff on access TV, start a local newspaper, even on your block.
[02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:00.800]  Start a local radio show.
[02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:01.800]  There's so many things you can do.
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:03.800]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:09.800]  Okay, I've come up with a couple of either t-shirts, coffee mugs, or whatever.
[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:14.800]  The first one is Kurt Haskell saw something.
[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:16.800]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:17.800]  That's the first one.
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:19.800]  Kurt Haskell saw something.
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:21.800]  So that would be like a bumper sticker.
[02:50:21.800 --> 02:50:22.800]  Oh, that's good.
[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:29.800]  Second one is Conspiracy Realist.
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:31.800]  You know how it's always become a pejorative?
[02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:34.800]  Conspiracy theorist?
[02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:36.800]  You could put Conspiracy Realist.
[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:37.800]  Good point.
[02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:40.800]  Okay, there, I'm going to give you a minute on the other side and try to jam in a few more.
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:43.800]  I need to get to this free speech attack stuff, a bunch of big breaking news.
[02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:45.800]  This came out on infoawards.com.
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:47.800]  It's so important to get out to people.
[02:50:47.800 --> 02:50:51.800]  Obama installs new guidelines to aid spying on innocent Americans.
[02:50:51.800 --> 02:50:55.800]  National Counterterrorism Center gives new privacy-busting power.
[02:50:55.800 --> 02:51:01.800]  Obama shamelessly exploits the death of Trayvon Martin.
[02:51:01.800 --> 02:51:03.800]  I'd seen the ungevity products work for many others.
[02:51:03.800 --> 02:51:06.800]  And so I bought a bunch of them, started using them, had a little bit of results.
[02:51:06.800 --> 02:51:09.800]  But I wasn't following the regimen every day.
[02:51:09.800 --> 02:51:13.800]  But Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds.
[02:51:13.800 --> 02:51:17.800]  When I saw those results, I said, I'd better follow my own advice.
[02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:20.800]  I started taking the ungevity products and it's been incredible.
[02:51:20.800 --> 02:51:23.800]  37 pounds in two months.
[02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:25.800]  Our bodies are amazing.
[02:51:25.800 --> 02:51:27.800]  And God gave us an incredible gift.
[02:51:27.800 --> 02:51:31.800]  But if our body doesn't have the tools it needs, all of the vitamins, all of the minerals,
[02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:35.800]  and the other key essential trace elements, we're not going to be healthy.
[02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:39.800]  Folks, this hidden hype, I only bring to my listeners products that I've tried myself
[02:51:39.800 --> 02:51:41.800]  and I truly believe in.
[02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:45.800]  And the amazing supplements available at InfoWarsTeam.com

[02:54:01.800 --> 02:54:10.800]  All right, I'm going to do a little bit of overdrive so I can jam in
[02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:13.800]  some of the folks that are holding.
[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:16.800]  We've got a fellow listening on a Roku box.
[02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:19.800]  We've got a lot of listeners and viewers now on the good old Roku box.
[02:54:19.800 --> 02:54:22.800]  You're at prisonplanet.tv. Remember, you get Roku, boxy,
[02:54:22.800 --> 02:54:25.800]  a bunch of other systems that are getting online there.
[02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:28.800]  A lot of little stuff we're doing around here the next time.
[02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:32.800]  By the way, speaking of prisonplanet.tv,
[02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:36.800]  it will premiere the Billy Corrigan interview with Smashing Pumpkins.
[02:54:36.800 --> 02:54:40.800]  It will premiere Monday evening, 7 o'clock, Info Wars Nightly News,
[02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:45.800]  and I'll be back myself with the whole news and then the Hour Plus interview.
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:50.800]  So here is a sneak peek for our radio and TV viewers.
[02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:02.800]  It's very weird to me that the left has become the old right in terms of
[02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:05.800]  they don't want to hear ideas, they don't want any dissent,
[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:08.800]  they don't want any questioning.
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:13.800]  Where I've been attacked the most for expressing any particular opinion
[02:55:13.800 --> 02:55:18.800]  is if I question in any way the global warming climate change narrative,
[02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:21.800]  I mean, you think I was skin and babies a lot.
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:26.800]  With the amount of money that's behind the green movements,
[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:28.800]  how can that literal class be that comfortable?
[02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:30.800]  Shouldn't it be going, why is this, you know,
[02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:33.800]  why is Monsanto standing behind me on this?
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:37.800]  From a political standpoint, anywhere where you see dissent being stifled,
[02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:39.800]  why is the fear there?
[02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:41.800]  You have a little run-in with Al Gore.
[02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:43.800]  I did, I did. Well, technically speaking,
[02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:45.800]  I made the former vice president wait for me.
[02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:49.800]  I had this little payback for something from the past.
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:54.800]  My point is, is not to get locked in to the idea of whether you're right
[02:55:54.800 --> 02:55:57.800]  or I'm right or you're wrong and I'm wrong,
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:01.800]  it's to be okay with letting those ideas onto the table
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:03.800]  and not be afraid of exploring them.
[02:56:03.800 --> 02:56:08.800]  Billy Corrigan, the founder of Smashing Pumpkins in studio,
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:12.800]  to talk about the media, music and what he sees in the future.
[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:15.800]  The way to counter darkness is with life, you know,
[02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:18.800]  and that's why I go back to the spiritual point.
[02:56:18.800 --> 02:56:24.800]  I think everything that you're willing to address is worthy of thought
[02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:28.800]  and the difference is whether we shroud that in shadow
[02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:31.800]  and anger and frustration and powerlessness
[02:56:31.800 --> 02:56:38.800]  or we put light on it and say, you know what, I want to know the truth.
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:40.800]  By the way, that's just the YouTube version.
[02:56:40.800 --> 02:56:42.800]  You want to see the actual high-def one?
[02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:45.800]  We're just playing that off YouTube for whatever reason.
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:48.800]  We're going to air that Monday night at 7 o'clock central
[02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:51.800]  and I'll play some big excerpts of it here on the radio the next day or so.
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:53.800]  I need to do that with the Dave Mustaine interview as well.
[02:56:53.800 --> 02:56:56.800]  That's important because these are not only smart, talented guys.
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:57:00.800]  They didn't have their giant fan base being awakened to the New World Order.
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:03.800]  It's all just networking, you know, the Liberty Movement
[02:57:03.800 --> 02:57:05.800]  and the Great Awakening that is happening.
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:10.800]  And if you're not a prisonplanet.tv subscriber, it's 15 cents a day.
[02:57:10.800 --> 02:57:14.800]  And when you are a member, it funds a truly independent media operation
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:16.800]  that is hurting the globalist.
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:20.800]  I mean, we're reaching millions more people, new people every week,
[02:57:20.800 --> 02:57:23.800]  15 million plus every week, one way or another, and that's growing.
[02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:27.800]  Speaking of reaching people, I haven't even gotten into this yet properly.
[02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:32.800]  This poor black teenager shot does look like, you know, he was wearing a hoodie.
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:35.800]  Suspicious to some guy that was known to call 911 all the time.
[02:57:35.800 --> 02:57:37.800]  The guy goes out off the property.
[02:57:37.800 --> 02:57:39.800]  It looks like it shoots him.
[02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:42.800]  And then they're going to use that to demonize the Second Amendment.
[02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:47.800]  But statistically, guns are used 20-something times more than they are in crime or in mistakes.
[02:57:47.800 --> 02:57:52.800]  But you see the usual suspects, Obama and Al Sharpton talking about violence
[02:57:52.800 --> 02:57:59.800]  and Obama's talking about, this is like, you know, it would have been his son to personalize it.
[02:57:59.800 --> 02:58:05.800]  So they can go ahead and engage in all their drug dealing in the black community
[02:58:05.800 --> 02:58:07.800]  and all the corruption that the globalists carry out.
[02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:10.800]  The globalists have to act like they're friends of the black community.
[02:58:10.800 --> 02:58:12.800]  This is all election division.
[02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:14.800]  And Kurt Nemo's got a story about that.
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:17.800]  Obama shamelessly exploits death of Trayvon Martin.
[02:58:17.800 --> 02:58:19.800]  That's at infowars.com.
[02:58:19.800 --> 02:58:24.800]  You'll find out what's really happening to black folks. We have these discounted down to $9.95.
[02:58:24.800 --> 02:58:28.800]  I mean, that's getting pretty close to our cost right there, just to get them out to people.
[02:58:28.800 --> 02:58:33.800]  Black genocide, MAFA 21, a documentary film in the 21st century America.
[02:58:33.800 --> 02:58:37.800]  You want to know what Jesse Jackson and all these people won't tell you?
[02:58:37.800 --> 02:58:50.800]  This is what you need to get at infowars.com.
[02:59:08.800 --> 02:59:15.800]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.800 --> 02:59:19.800]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.800 --> 02:59:22.800]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:22.800 --> 02:59:26.800]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:59:26.800 --> 02:59:31.800]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.800 --> 02:59:36.800]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[02:59:36.800 --> 02:59:40.800]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:40.800 --> 02:59:42.800]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.800 --> 03:00:10.800]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:00:12.800 --> 03:00:19.800]  We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:19.800 --> 03:00:27.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:27.800 --> 03:00:31.800]  Okay, we are back live. We're on the edge of the Second American Revolution.
[03:00:31.800 --> 03:00:33.800]  We hope it's an info war or not physical.
[03:00:33.800 --> 03:00:36.800]  But justice be done. May the heavens fall.
[03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:38.800]  Let's go back to Bill in Connecticut.
[03:00:38.800 --> 03:00:40.800]  Bill, finish up your points you had there, sir.
[03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:44.800]  Yes, I'll get to my main point here.
[03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:53.800]  Back in November of 2011, I read an article by Pam Martens of Counterpunch, and she wrote, she worked on Wall Street,
[03:00:53.800 --> 03:00:58.800]  that there's a surveillance center in New York called the Lower Manhattan Security Coordination Center.
[03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:05.800]  And it's coordinated jointly by the NYPD, Wall Street firms, and Homeland Security.
[03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:13.800]  If that's not fascism, I don't know what is. It operates around the clock under the auspices of the NYPD.
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:18.800]  And they've got 2,000 private spy cameras that are owned by Wall Street firms.
[03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:22.800]  Then another 1,000 cameras are owned by the NYPD.
[03:01:22.800 --> 03:01:24.800]  No, no, that's on record all over the world.
[03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:29.800]  They're talking about by law in what Chicago and England in London,
[03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:34.800]  making people wire their surveillance cameras into the grid.
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:39.800]  Right. But the idea that it's coordinated jointly,
[03:01:39.800 --> 03:01:46.800]  and they have a room that's set up where the police can sit right alongside somebody from Goldman Sachs.
[03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:49.800]  No, no, no, that's what the threat fusion centers are.
[03:01:49.800 --> 03:01:56.800]  And now other CIA advisors, Homeland Security pays for the building. The CIA is running these.
[03:01:56.800 --> 03:02:00.800]  Right. And it's unbelievable.
[03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:07.800]  Sir, sir, they're openly blatant fascism. They're blatantly admitting that they're watching all of us without warrants now.
[03:02:07.800 --> 03:02:10.800]  And Obama just came out. This is as big as the NDAA.
[03:02:10.800 --> 03:02:14.800]  This new article, Obama installs new guidelines to aid spying on innocent Americans.
[03:02:14.800 --> 03:02:17.800]  National Counterterrorism Center giving new privacy-busting power.
[03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:22.800]  He's just saying, UN runs everything. No more Bill of Rights. I'm king.
[03:02:22.800 --> 03:02:24.800]  And again, he'll probably leave office later.
[03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:29.800]  But the office itself for the bankers, I mean, these people are criminals.
[03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:30.800]  Absolutely.
[03:02:30.800 --> 03:02:33.800]  God bless you. I'm going to jump to another call here. Folks have been holding a while.
[03:02:33.800 --> 03:02:41.800]  Let's go to Bregen in Wisconsin listening on Roku Box. Go ahead, Bregen.
[03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:43.800]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call.
[03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:53.800]  I thank also to the gals in the business office because they have been helping me get my 86th membership that I bought activated.
[03:02:53.800 --> 03:03:01.800]  And so time six, I think that's 516. And so I have little cards that I made up and I'll send you the template.
[03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:07.800]  I'll send that to your business office so people can print those out with their username and password.
[03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:13.800]  But my point is on the Clintonville, Wisconsin booming sounds.
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:18.800]  Thanks to Paul Watson for covering that.
[03:03:18.800 --> 03:03:36.800]  Even the fellow with the USGS, I think his name is Caruso, says that that one earthquake that happens to have coincided with one of the nice episodes of booming.
[03:03:36.800 --> 03:03:50.800]  And that's just one out of, say, 16 different episodes spread out over four nights. And there's actually a fantastic map, an interactive map that's GIS, satellite and interactive.
[03:03:50.800 --> 03:04:02.800]  If you type in quotes, booming sounds, map, and then type in Clintonville, you'll get a fantastic GIS interactive map.
[03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:10.800]  And you can look at the dates when all these calls came in and where they were in the city from satellite imagery.
[03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:16.800]  What do you think it is? A lot of times when there's underground mining and underground bases being built, people hear that.
[03:04:16.800 --> 03:04:23.800]  There's underground weapons tests. There's harp systems. There's all sorts of stuff, the Kokomo Hum in Indiana.
[03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:33.800]  Yeah, so 80 miles away from there, if you look on a big map, there's a big triangle that kind of forms from the three towns that are reporting these booms.
[03:04:33.800 --> 03:04:38.800]  One is called Fond du Lac, F-O-N-D-E.
[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:41.800]  You have 20 seconds. So what's the end of the story?
[03:04:41.800 --> 03:04:48.800]  And there's a bunch of foods that have come up into the sewers in Fond du Lac and the city engineers are wondering what the heck it is.
[03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:55.800]  One of the guys used to work for a mining company and he says it smells and feels like a lubricant that's used for drilling.
[03:04:55.800 --> 03:05:19.800]  Yeah, who knows what they're building down there. Government loves this stuff.
