[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:27.000 --> 00:32.000]  That's right, right here, hosting from Deep in the Heart of Texas, Austin, the ATX.
[00:33.000 --> 00:40.000]  It's Wednesday, the 26th of April, 2017. We're going to be here for the next four hours with myself.
[00:41.000 --> 00:47.000]  Paul Watson, Roger Stone, Mike Cernovich, and many, many others.
[00:47.000 --> 00:56.000]  I'm not going to spend a lot of time on the Chabani Yogurt lawsuit today, but I'm going to cover it a little bit in the next segment.
[00:57.000 --> 01:10.000]  But what you need to know is the media is lying as usual. They're saying there's no connections with Chabani in a refugee program or the U.N. refugee program, and that there's no connections with George Soros, and I'm just making that up.
[01:10.000 --> 01:26.000]  Even though in the very video that they mentioned but don't link to all of the news, I show the official news articles where the law firm that George Soros was the first client of and financed and still finances and uses is the one suing me.
[01:26.000 --> 01:41.000]  Or him meeting with Chabani to bring in more migrants and how Chabani owner works with the U.N. agency to bring people in. I mean, it is just crazy.
[01:41.000 --> 02:01.000]  But their argument, the lawsuit is, oh, the State Department, the State Department, they're the ones that vetis and bring them in. Exactly. And the State Department gets its orders in the U.N. refugee program for Peter Sutherland that runs that program that Chabani owner works with along with George Soros to open the borders.
[02:01.000 --> 02:13.000]  And then they certify people from seven countries is vetted when these countries have their own Islamic caliphates that issue their passports that basically come from the back of a cereal box.
[02:13.000 --> 02:35.000]  Now, I don't know if Hamid Ulaqiah is a bad guy or not. I don't hate him personally. What I hate is the media and the Islamist and others oppressing people all over the world and always going after anybody like Trump that says the cops getting shot a whole bunch of them last week in Paris was Islamic.
[02:35.000 --> 02:45.000]  They screamed Allah Akbar. ISIS took credit. The media said it's crazy. It's like, oh, look at this mouse. It's white. This computer mouse is white. You're totally insane. It's not white.
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  The American flag is red, white and blue. No, it isn't racist.
[02:49.000 --> 03:04.000]  But I've been doing deep research into Chabani owner Hamid Ulaqiah because look, they're saying I went after because I want to hurt his yoga company or I went after him because I've got a score to settle with Muslims or whatever.
[03:05.000 --> 03:14.000]  My crew covered that. David Knight covered that. The headline was from Rob Do and the point is they did their research and we're reporting on other reports.
[03:14.000 --> 03:22.000]  And it depends on how you look at it, but a lot of it is accurate. Did the yogurt place itself or the employees import rapists? No.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  Do you think Chabani did it on purpose? The owner? Probably not. Who wants the trouble?
[03:27.000 --> 03:33.000]  The point is this larger flow and the unvettedness that he's pushing here and in Europe is causing a big problem.
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  And that's what I'm sick and tired of. And that's what I hate is the political correctness that won't admit all this is going on.
[03:39.000 --> 03:45.000]  Because the media twisted my words and said that, you know, I hate Chabani himself. No, I hate the bully.
[03:46.000 --> 03:55.000]  And I'm doing some research. I'm weighing things here, but we can do clarifications but really not retractions on the main issues except for one thing.
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.000]  He is a Kurd and I know the Kurds have been oppressed by Turkey big time and the Kurds generally aren't starting fights with people around them.
[04:02.000 --> 04:12.000]  The military folks tell me some of the best people in the Middle East who have been oppressed by the radical Islamists are Kurds and his family from a dairy farm was oppressed by them.
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  And I'm not against having refugees that are actually oppressed by radical Islam. I don't want to bring radical Islam in.
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  So we have to weigh all this. I mean, maybe this guy just cares about, you know, Kurds or something and wants to bring them in.
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.000]  And he's pointed out that the people reportedly that have pled guilty to sexual assault are North African and Iraqi.
[04:29.000 --> 04:35.000]  So I can get that point. So let's clarify that. So I may put out a larger clarification on the larger issues.
[04:36.000 --> 04:44.000]  But on the issue of the media last year saying there weren't rapes or sexual assaults and attacking everybody and yours truly, they've pled guilty now.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  So again, it's the media that's been discredited here. The mainstream media is the main problem.
[04:49.000 --> 04:58.000]  But we will seek the truth and we'll bring it to you. I'm Alex Jones, info wars dot com. Huge nook drills when we come back.
[05:01.000 --> 05:04.000]  North Korea continues to threaten the United States.
[05:05.000 --> 05:11.000]  This time saying they are ready to sink the U.S. aircraft carrier Carl Vinson with a single strike.
[05:11.000 --> 05:20.000]  They also claim that their military has the ability to reach the continental United States and they are now in possession of a massive hydrogen bomb.
[05:21.000 --> 05:31.000]  Meanwhile, the White House held an emergency meeting over North Korea that included a phone call between President Trump and China over the escalating tensions in the region.
[05:31.000 --> 05:42.000]  And China says World War Three is inevitable as North Korea prepares for yet another nuclear missile test and Donald Trump is poised to intervene.
[05:43.000 --> 05:56.000]  The nuclear submarine USS Michigan has arrived in the South Korean port of Busan and we've now learned that the United States is preparing to evacuate 230,000 Americans from South Korea.

[07:59.000 --> 08:04.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[08:07.000 --> 08:11.000]  I am so honored ladies and gentlemen to be here with you today.
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000]  I follow my intellect but more importantly I follow my gut. That of course is your spirit.
[08:17.000 --> 08:28.000]  And everything I do with the assurity of a sleepwalker ends up turning out to be the right move as long as I follow my gut. My north star that's God.
[08:29.000 --> 08:36.000]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect doesn't mean sometimes things that look like a train wreck but look at info wars and look what we've done look what we've done.
[08:36.000 --> 08:51.000]  Look what we've all done together. Look what this cruise done. It has changed the world in such a massive way. Globalism, unelected corporate planetary government is now collapsing and the enemies own internal documents but also public statements is in full swing.
[08:51.000 --> 09:06.000]  They are then attempting to terrorize the nation states flood them with Islamist flood them with brainwashed leftist activist and just prosperity haters and are attempting full destabilization.
[09:06.000 --> 09:21.000]  And demonizing attacking destroying or attempting destroy anyone that is a focal point anyone that is not a leader but simply a common sense person trying to survive.
[09:21.000 --> 09:40.000]  I'm not a famous person. I'm not a celebrity. I'm not a star. I hate Hollywood. I hate the elite. I hate all the garbage. I am someone resisting up against the enemy because I don't want to be a slave because I have a spirit of liberty in me that God gave me.
[09:40.000 --> 09:57.000]  Now that said Stephen Colbert has attacked me five times the last week and a half starting his broadcast television show every night with it.
[09:57.000 --> 10:12.000]  I saw my son this morning over breakfast and I said if you see Stephen Colbert attacking me constantly he says my wife is bringing it up.
[10:13.000 --> 10:21.000]  And he said dad not nobody in my high school watches Stephen Colbert only old people do.
[10:21.000 --> 10:36.000]  And that's not just my son saying that that's what all the young people say it's a joke but everybody 40 and above thinks that Stephen Colbert is trendy and cutting edge and cool old people watch that.
[10:36.000 --> 10:51.000]  So Stephen Colbert wearing a tinfoil hat ladies and gentlemen and then talking with my gravely voice. I mean I guess some of it's funny with brain fight.
[10:51.000 --> 11:06.000]  But at least now they're admitting on the next files and on Stephen Colbert and on homeland and countless other shows that they're creating a strong man of Alex Jones.
[11:07.000 --> 11:18.000]  Now Chris Carter said he liked me and did a fair character but all the other ones I mean there's so many there's at least 10 national characters where they now admit it's based on me.
[11:18.000 --> 11:29.000]  Now I noticed earlier in the year before Homeland came out we had a leaker that gave us the scripts and said it's you know Hillary was supposed to win but they're going ahead with the scripts that it's a woman that won and they're just going to tweak it.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  But it's all about you and how you're a fraud and how you're fake and how you're a liar.
[11:35.000 --> 11:42.000]  And then I talked about it the news said I was crazy no show would be about me well they've since come out and said yes it's all based on Alex Jones.
[11:42.000 --> 11:49.000]  You just search engine Homeland talks about you know Alex Jones and how it's based on Alex Jones and how they're proud of it.
[11:50.000 --> 11:58.000]  And notice then you see the news saying I'm fake and you see the comedy show saying I'm fake because they're the fake ones.
[11:59.000 --> 12:07.000]  We don't have an army of sock puppets and disinfo people posting articles here at the office we have a ragtag crew we are telling the truth at or dying trying.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  And I don't want to start the broadcast about me Paul Watson's coming up.
[12:12.000 --> 12:23.000]  But the reason we have to do this is if they can destroy my name and info wars name new people when they see it will be psychologically poisoned the well will be poisoned actually looking at we're saying.
[12:24.000 --> 12:31.000]  Now remember these arrogant people think their audience is stupid like whenever Trevor Noah.
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  Came out last week he's attacked me a few times this week.
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.000]  And incidentally I think he's funnier and Stephen Colbert many ways I mean I disagree with all his BS but I mean the guy's talented.
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  It's a good looking guy too.
[12:47.000 --> 12:53.000]  I'll give him that he he came out and said what the planes doing right over with a spray in the car.
[12:53.000 --> 13:00.000]  Oh let's get in the same pool have some possible.
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.000]  Okay granny let's do it.
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.000]  When you can just search engine I have a limited crew right now city bike search engine CFR.
[13:10.000 --> 13:36.000]  We need geoengineering and then the article from six years ago admits we're already geoengineering we're already adding aluminum salts barium and and and other things to the jet fuel through the patents through the big three makers of jet fuel that it then aerosolizes and creates nuclei and the earth is 21 to 30% darker according to NASA there is CFR on the regulation of geoengineering.
[13:36.000 --> 13:55.000]  That's not the one I was talking about but there it is that 2008 yeah there's another one from like 2012 but the point is there's a global treaty on geoengineering and massive reengineering of the planet and they say as long as it's not military it's okay.
[13:55.000 --> 14:10.000]  The Secretary of Defense in 1997 gave a big speech and said we have weather weapons other weapons it's all over the news that Dubai is making the desert green and China is making it rain developments of international framework geoengineering they're in a CFR.
[14:10.000 --> 14:25.000]  So this whole thing's going on just like there were death panels in Obamacare just like it would double your prices and just like it was written by insurance companies to screw you over I would show you the bill and they would just have Rachel Maddow go he's deeply racist and doesn't like black people.
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.000]  Where's the proof of that.
[14:29.000 --> 14:30.000]  They don't care.
[14:30.000 --> 14:39.000]  So see that's just one point of all the lies they put out you're watching it.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  And the lies go like this.
[14:43.000 --> 14:52.000]  I can't remember who one teacher is of like 20 that my kids have then I don't know who my nannies are then I don't know their names by the time it gets to cobear.
[14:52.000 --> 15:06.000]  And this is how they deceive or they say hey in the news you sometimes put a lizard hat on you really believe that you're a lizard I said of course not I'm playing a part a big sarcastic satire they go oh you're fake oh oh we got you we got you.
[15:07.000 --> 15:11.000]  And look I know the audience knows this but remember you're awake.
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  None of us are perfect we're all constantly trying to become more awake we all see through rose colored darkly as the Bible says.
[15:17.000 --> 15:31.000]  But we're seeking the truth the public they're targeting literally believes this crap is real when they say Donald Trump hates Mexicans but don't show a clip people believe it when they say I love David Duke.
[15:32.000 --> 15:44.000]  That's all it is David Duke spends most his time attacking me I don't know why but it's like David Duke hates me for at least 10 years because I don't hate groups for what color they are.
[15:44.000 --> 15:50.000]  I hate ideas I hate cultures like the communist Chinese or the Nazis.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  So then he says all this stuff about me.
[15:54.000 --> 16:08.000]  Yeah he's not even compared to some of the others the lies I mean I guess he just kind of twist stuff and I mean I'm not out to get the black panthers that hate white people I'm not out to get David Duke I just am not their enemy but I sure as hell don't agree with them.
[16:08.000 --> 16:17.000]  But they don't care they'll level their fingers at me in the media and say you love David Duke I got worth the proof shut up David Duke lover.
[16:18.000 --> 16:24.000]  And look I don't let that reverse psychology work on me to then drive me over to that side but I'm just you're trying to be real ladies and gentlemen.
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.000]  And just understand we hang together or we hang separate as Benjamin Franklin said.
[16:30.000 --> 16:37.000]  Coming back I'm going to hit the big news and polls coming in feds prep for nuclear attack in New Jersey.
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.000]  U.S. Navy fires warning flare at Iran vessel the Persian Gulf.
[16:42.000 --> 16:50.000]  We've got Saudi Arabia trying to get nukes we've got my I've got my sources Sarnovich has got his mind separate but very close to his source.
[16:51.000 --> 16:56.000]  And I got to make masters he is pushing for war he wants to give nukes to Saudi Arabia they already got nukes.
[16:56.000 --> 17:07.000]  I was told by special ops folks I'll just leave it at that that Iran had nukes 1617 years ago and that Saudi Arabia got him.
[17:08.000 --> 17:15.000]  And of course I was told that Pakistan had nukes 20 years ago by family before it was admitted I'll just leave it at that I was never given any classified info.
[17:16.000 --> 17:22.000]  I was just I was like are we going into Iran during the Iraq war and I told my family we're not going into Iran.
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.000]  They got nukes and missiles delivered it.
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.000]  I was like whoa.
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.000]  So you know obviously the officers passing that on down or like that's not happening and of course it later came out.
[17:34.000 --> 17:35.000]  Then I have some other sources as well.
[17:36.000 --> 17:41.000]  So that's why this is such a powder keg North Korea is getting more advanced nukes and they're getting better missiles and they're crazy.
[17:42.000 --> 17:47.000]  And that's why they've got to be dealt with Iran acts like they're crazy not so much but they need to stop harassing our boats.
[17:48.000 --> 17:48.000]  I mean Trump's right.
[17:49.000 --> 17:50.000]  You shoot us again we're going to blow your ass out of the water.
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  I don't want a war but we can't get pushed around here.
[17:53.000 --> 17:54.000]  So that's all coming up as well.
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.000]  Julian Assange is the CIA director is waging war on truth tellers like WikiLeaks.
[18:00.000 --> 18:01.000]  Let me just stop at this point.
[18:02.000 --> 18:09.000]  You know we're being sued by billionaire Federal Reserve Board of New York member hooked into the big international Turkish organizations.
[18:10.000 --> 18:15.000]  We're doing research on that who openly pushes the Peter Sutherland and George Soros up in the borders.
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  You know he's suing us and even Time Magazine Associated Press says he doesn't have a case.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  They just tend to keep hitting us and hitting us.
[18:24.000 --> 18:31.000]  I told you a month ago from our sources that George Soros and the Clintons Foundation are going to get a bunch of front groups to sue us.
[18:32.000 --> 18:38.000]  I was told that by high level sources Cernovich who does have the sources I've confirmed to his main sources very high level, very high level.
[18:39.000 --> 18:43.000]  And you've seen some of the family tweet he deserves a Pulitzer Prize I'll leave it at that.
[18:43.000 --> 18:52.000]  And so the point is is that we were told and out of the Justice Department is aware of this, but they got their own fights.
[18:53.000 --> 18:59.000]  We're kind of all out here alone just fighting as hard as we can that I am to be targeted and just sued, sued, sued, sued, sued till we're destroyed.

[22:58.000 --> 23:17.000]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's. In an epic battle of David versus Goliath, in the early 1980s a child was born. Two of them actually. Their names were Jeff and Andy. Time went by, they developed facial hair and one day something happened. Andy got ripped off by overpriced razors.
[23:17.000 --> 23:34.000]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all. They hired the best designers. They bought a 95-year-old German blade factory and they started selling high quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers. How did the overpriced razor company respond? By threatening to sue their pants off.
[23:35.000 --> 23:40.000]  Don't worry, Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to get all guys a great shave at a great price.

[24:23.000 --> 24:29.400]  I'm your host Alex Jones, Paul Wash is coming up in the next segment in studio joining us
[24:29.400 --> 24:39.160]  from London, England, old London town, here's the bottom line, most people seek affirmation
[24:39.160 --> 24:44.880]  from society, from culture, from the establishment and they want to be conformist and they want
[24:44.880 --> 24:49.480]  to be successful within the system and that's great if you have a good system, but if you're
[24:49.480 --> 24:54.680]  in authoritarian EU or authoritarian North Korea or authoritarian Venezuela where they're starving
[24:54.680 --> 24:58.840]  to death for four years running, eating their family pets, well those were eaten a few years ago.
[25:01.080 --> 25:08.600]  Conforming to a system that's broken the social contract is called cultural suicide and I'm not
[25:08.600 --> 25:15.880]  going to commit suicide culturally or physically or spiritually. I was a history buff growing up,
[25:15.880 --> 25:21.480]  people ask why I'm so radical, I'm not radical, history is radical, truth is radical, truth is
[25:21.480 --> 25:29.320]  stranger than fiction, always is, always has been and I had studied history and I'd studied recent
[25:29.320 --> 25:34.840]  history and I started reading then handbooks written by the globalist by the time I was 12 years old
[25:36.200 --> 25:44.760]  and articles and publications of the John Birch Society and Nundercall conspiracy that I was
[25:44.760 --> 25:48.600]  reading what they said the elite were doing and then I'd go read what the elite were saying at
[25:48.600 --> 25:53.720]  the library by the time I was 16 at law libraries to actually read Club of Rome stuff and it was
[25:53.720 --> 25:59.400]  word for word what JBS was saying. JBS is the most truthful, I might even remember, organization
[25:59.400 --> 26:05.720]  I've ever heard of and it was founded by US intelligence operatives who knew we were putting
[26:05.720 --> 26:11.320]  communist Chinese in charge in 1949. That's when our own splinter groups in our government went,
[26:11.320 --> 26:15.880]  we're not putting up with this and those splinter groups have been in the government
[26:15.880 --> 26:20.680]  ever since trying to fight this. That's why Julian Assange has come out and said the CIA director
[26:20.680 --> 26:26.360]  is waging war on truth tellers like WikiLeaks, The Washington Post. Trump is so wrong on this
[26:26.920 --> 26:31.400]  when the whistleblowers in our own intelligence agencies got the intel out on Hillary's criminal
[26:31.400 --> 26:35.320]  activity, you said if you've got the info release it, Trump said that.
[26:35.320 --> 26:41.640]  Got to play that clip the next segment. He said the Russians had it, they should release it because
[26:41.640 --> 26:47.800]  it's Hillary committing the crimes. So how can Trump now do this? This for me is the biggest
[26:47.800 --> 26:55.800]  black eye to Trump and I know he delegates and I know if he you know goes after the Russians
[26:55.800 --> 26:59.560]  on the surface and goes after WikiLeaks on the surface that gets him off his back in Congress
[26:59.560 --> 27:04.280]  but it's all made up anyways so he shouldn't do that for public consumption. It's wrong,
[27:04.280 --> 27:09.000]  we always hear Trump's so loyal well if people did things that were legal and lawful exposing
[27:09.000 --> 27:16.600]  criminal activity and the government and it got you elected how in the hell excuse me how on earth
[27:16.600 --> 27:22.600]  can you do that President Trump? I'm glad you're controlling our border, I'm glad you're getting
[27:22.600 --> 27:26.200]  our taxes cut, I'm glad you're trying to repeal Obamacare, I'm glad you're trying to stop the
[27:26.200 --> 27:32.280]  Islamists pouring in. I love 85% of what you're doing but I don't want to give nukes to North
[27:32.280 --> 27:36.440]  Korea like the Clintons did and I don't want to give them to Saudi Arabia like McMasters is
[27:36.440 --> 27:52.280]  pushing for that's up on infohorses.com. So it's absolutely certain that if Trump does this it's
[27:52.280 --> 27:57.880]  wrong and it opens the door for them to be able to say well you got this information you claims
[27:57.880 --> 28:03.000]  criminal so you're a criminal so the election's illegitimate. It's horse manure we need more
[28:03.000 --> 28:08.280]  leaks exposing criminal activity not less. I understand Trump doesn't like leaks inside
[28:08.280 --> 28:13.480]  his national security council on constitutional stuff but that's not what this was this was
[28:13.480 --> 28:18.920]  her private illegal servers and crime she was committing. I'm about to come back the next
[28:18.920 --> 28:22.520]  segment and take some appalls time I'm sure he'll be fine to get into this whole nuke drill
[28:23.240 --> 28:27.720]  but because that ties into all this but I've got a major warning for Trump when we return on the
[28:27.720 --> 28:32.280]  other side of this break one of the most important I've ever issued and it ties into all of this
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.080]  straight ahead. You heard me plug at the end of the last segment I'm going to plug again here
[28:37.640 --> 28:42.520]  because we had a lot of capital come in last week to help fund things had a big specials end and now
[28:43.160 --> 28:47.320]  there's not enough capital coming in day by day if you look at it to fund the operation and
[28:47.320 --> 28:50.680]  some weeks were in the red some weeks were in the black we'd have a lot of black weeks
[28:50.680 --> 28:57.960]  to be able to deal with the globalist Islamist's lawsuits the George Soros law firm Islamist's
[28:57.960 --> 29:03.240]  lawsuit that the media is playing dumb on that the fellow reserve board members suing me on the

[33:47.400 --> 33:52.760]  okay so we reported on this a few days ago now it's big news mainstream media is covering our
[33:52.760 --> 33:57.000]  fake news of course no we just lead because we're cutting edge that's why they hate us because they
[33:57.000 --> 34:03.480]  don't control the narrative now feds prep for nuclear attack in new jersey federal authorities
[34:03.480 --> 34:08.680]  are running nuclear response drills at met life stadium in northern new jersey homeland
[34:08.680 --> 34:14.120]  security fema are conducting operation gotham shield the purpose is to practice how to access
[34:14.120 --> 34:18.920]  and activate evacuate victims during a potential nuclear attack in new york city area the drill
[34:18.920 --> 34:24.760]  simulated scenario which a 10 000 ton improvised nuclear device goes off on the nuclear new jersey
[34:24.760 --> 34:35.240]  side of the link and tunnel all right so let's stop right there this is a cog drill continuity
[34:35.240 --> 34:41.240]  of government drill i've been telling you since trump got elected november 8th that the noises
[34:41.240 --> 34:47.160]  they were making about we need a civil emergency the election wasn't real overturn it we need a crisis
[34:47.160 --> 34:52.760]  that's the dumb down folks at cnn msnbc just getting the word to their teleprompter loads from the
[34:52.760 --> 34:58.600]  globalist start talking about emergency civil emergencies new elections homeland security
[34:58.600 --> 35:05.160]  taking over elections that's continuity of government which copies the nazi continuity
[35:05.160 --> 35:11.720]  of government program called project or operation valkyrie their false flag ops were called operation
[35:11.720 --> 35:17.480]  himmler so the germans did have one of the most sophisticated governmental systems the inter-world
[35:17.480 --> 35:23.160]  war two that's why it was adopted by the cia nasa our entire system basically not saying it's
[35:23.160 --> 35:27.640]  a nazi conspiracy they just took it over that's well known 36 000 high level nazis brought over
[35:27.640 --> 35:36.120]  more than 100 000 technicians yeah the nazi refugee program so you have this system
[35:38.440 --> 35:44.280]  the germans tried to use valkyrie against hitler using cog to overthrow him now the idea is they're
[35:44.280 --> 35:48.200]  saying trump hitler that's what the democrats are going around months after i told you they would
[35:48.200 --> 35:52.840]  to congress and to the pentagon saying he's to be overthrown we did military coup and the way to do
[35:52.840 --> 35:57.240]  it is to claim it's legitimate under cog had the democrats declared the whole election null and void
[35:58.440 --> 36:06.200]  and then come out and say that all the republicans that got elected basically they have to step down
[36:06.200 --> 36:09.960]  they have to go away and a new election is going to happen and under obama's last executive order
[36:09.960 --> 36:15.960]  homeland security will be in charge of the election all that's now happened they've set that all up
[36:15.960 --> 36:21.400]  they've prepared it they've done it because that's how i would do it if i was them historically so
[36:21.400 --> 36:29.880]  all of that's been unfolding now i've been saying look for massive nuke drills now this is probably
[36:29.880 --> 36:33.880]  happening on the surface with north korea threatening to nuke in fact no doubt part of it is because
[36:33.880 --> 36:39.240]  of that and the situation with syria and russia but this is the biggest nuke drills ever dc
[36:39.240 --> 36:43.880]  new york new jersey it's happening everywhere and they'll have they'll have the doomsday planes in
[36:43.880 --> 36:48.840]  the sky they'll have the president moving around this is a big drill one of the biggest if not
[36:48.840 --> 36:53.320]  biggest ever trump needs to know and i'm not saying this is going to happen but with everything else
[36:53.320 --> 36:58.120]  going on and the missile defense being put in and south korea and all the rest of it and
[36:58.840 --> 37:03.640]  north korea threatened to nuke our carriers and just the huge escalations with all of this unfolding
[37:03.640 --> 37:09.640]  they can use cog because cog and the alternate government kicks in
[37:11.800 --> 37:18.040]  right as these drills kick in and congress and the leaders of congress are then moved out
[37:18.040 --> 37:24.600]  to quote safe zones like site r in maryland very easy to decapitate them during this drill
[37:25.160 --> 37:28.840]  because you don't want to decapitate congress with a nuke going off for something for real
[37:28.840 --> 37:36.200]  or a mass bombing or shooting the leadership being killed like america with a k unless you've
[37:36.200 --> 37:41.960]  already got the cog in place because your enemies might strike you during that command and control
[37:41.960 --> 37:45.880]  confusion and the globalist are obsessed with being control freaks and having everything under
[37:45.880 --> 37:51.800]  their control i'm not saying this is going to happen in the next few days as these drills are
[37:51.800 --> 37:57.160]  ongoing this isn't the only one i'm telling you that this is the time they do it or they might
[37:57.160 --> 38:02.280]  bootleg it and test it during this one and see if other agencies are aware of what's happening
[38:02.280 --> 38:07.400]  because if the shadow group trying to use the cog which they are to take over it starts getting
[38:07.400 --> 38:13.000]  caught in the process or wants to abort they can do it claiming it's just a drill and this
[38:13.000 --> 38:20.120]  follows past operations so president trump needs to understand during a cog drill like this he's
[38:20.120 --> 38:26.680]  at the greatest danger of a military coup with the globalist at the highest levels or a globalist
[38:26.680 --> 38:32.840]  a globalist coup through fema and other agencies and needs to be watching this very very carefully
[38:32.840 --> 38:36.760]  again they were having national security cog drills when they tried to kill hitler during
[38:36.760 --> 38:43.560]  operation valkyrie they've done they've had overthrows in russia during drills because you
[38:43.560 --> 38:47.640]  see all the trucks and tanks and things and helicopters moving around and so you think oh
[38:47.640 --> 38:52.440]  that's just part of the drill and it's not there was a drill going on by the us military in panama
[38:52.440 --> 39:01.000]  law of course in uh 19 was it 1988 89 it was 88 it was it was 8889 that was the drill so we need
[39:01.000 --> 39:08.760]  to be absolutely vigilant during this entire period now separately i'm going to hand the baton
[39:08.760 --> 39:16.920]  to paul watson right now we have hameed bula kayab who was born as a Kurdish minority he says
[39:16.920 --> 39:21.720]  persecuted group i believe that the the Kurds have been persecuted from the military i've talked to
[39:21.720 --> 39:25.720]  there's going to be a nicer you know more non radical group of muslims i've been a lot of muslims
[39:25.720 --> 39:29.560]  are nice people i don't want to sit there and say i hate this guy because i don't personally hate him
[39:30.920 --> 39:36.280]  now suing me not for ten thousand dollars that's just how you have to file in idaho and then it's
[39:36.280 --> 39:41.800]  it's got the punitive damages it could be millions for reporting on mainstream news articles confirming
[39:41.800 --> 39:47.400]  the charging of these teens for sexual assault remember the media for a year said it wasn't
[39:47.400 --> 39:51.800]  true it was all a lie we were liars the everybody else we we we were just following it but we got
[39:51.800 --> 39:56.360]  called the creators of it and fake news so now the headline everywhere is i'm fake news this is all
[39:56.360 --> 40:01.400]  fake because they're saying technically shabani yogurt didn't bring them in the state department
[40:01.400 --> 40:08.520]  did well he's the owner he is on the he lobbies the un and it's in the news it's part of the
[40:08.520 --> 40:13.080]  clinton global initiative and meets with george soros saying i'm looking forward in the next few
[40:13.080 --> 40:18.040]  years this is two years ago to working with george soros to bring in more refugees then
[40:18.040 --> 40:22.840]  they say well we didn't bring in unvetted the state department did the point is you're promoting
[40:22.840 --> 40:30.040]  refugees that are in the town you're the main employer in the town there's thousands of refugees
[40:30.040 --> 40:35.800]  in the town the colonization has been going on for 20 years i'm not sitting there questioning
[40:35.800 --> 40:40.360]  that i'm not seeing you want rapist here so we three weeks ago when their lawyers called us
[40:40.360 --> 40:44.840]  and sent letters i saw the headlines and that's a little strong to say they're in caught importing
[40:44.840 --> 40:50.520]  rapist migrants no it's just that the company and owner who've been pushing migrants
[40:52.440 --> 40:57.880]  come into the country who've now played guilty that's really the headline so we changed it
[40:57.880 --> 41:03.000]  they sued us and say we didn't change it so that's a deception in the media and what it is in my
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.640]  views of publicity stunt i'm all over the news i'm everywhere they want to brand this is fake news
[41:07.640 --> 41:13.640]  you come out shabani yogurt has gotten you know some heat for saying they hire refugees so has
[41:13.640 --> 41:18.280]  and saying they want more so it's starbucks they lost like 20 revenue the last few months that's
[41:18.280 --> 41:26.440]  your fault hameed ulakaya you get government lunch programs you've got an exclusive nationwide on
[41:26.440 --> 41:30.120]  that you get government contracts you're on the federal reserve board we're investigating your
[41:30.120 --> 41:35.640]  gulon connections they've been nights usually not a very aggressive guy but he says we should go on
[41:35.640 --> 41:38.520]  the offense and i agree we're going to send investigative journalists there we're going to
[41:38.520 --> 41:43.320]  get totally involved or interview local doctors they're suing me saying refugees haven't increased
[41:43.320 --> 41:49.960]  tb even though it's all over the news he pushes bringing in refugees tb explodes all over the
[41:49.960 --> 41:57.160]  country they're suing me saying shabani yogurt brought in i said you the owner of it have pushed
[41:57.160 --> 42:02.840]  it and they're not vetting people for tb that's all over the news and what i hate is the arrogance
[42:02.840 --> 42:07.880]  and the bullying of mainstream media and radical islam that thinks that they can say we're all
[42:07.880 --> 42:13.000]  crazy that no muslims are raping anybody when there's an epidemic all over the world i don't know
[42:13.000 --> 42:18.760]  this shabani owner i did a poll two of my kids don't like it one of my children love it a lot
[42:18.760 --> 42:22.840]  people i say doctors they love it i think it's too dry yogurt i don't like greek style yogurt
[42:23.800 --> 42:29.880]  but i they've sued me saying i'm out to get his company bro i didn't even know or pay attention to
[42:29.880 --> 42:37.400]  you the fact that you were a muslim i just kept hearing about the islamists as supposedly raping
[42:37.400 --> 42:40.440]  out in this town and how it was getting covered up and the media tried to cover it up but now
[42:40.440 --> 42:45.720]  they pled guilty so the claim that i want to hurt your yogurt company i hope you're a good
[42:45.720 --> 42:51.480]  Kurdish immigrant i hope you want to fight radical islam because i know the Kurds along
[42:51.480 --> 42:55.720]  with the alawites are some of the only groups that don't want radical islam taken over that are
[42:55.720 --> 43:01.240]  muslim so i hope you're a good guy but man you're with george soros his law firm that he founded
[43:02.680 --> 43:07.480]  is suing me you're working with him in the u n and then you're saying none of that's true
[43:09.080 --> 43:16.200]  i've talked to four top lawyers including lawyers in ido and they say and like my lawyers will
[43:16.200 --> 43:22.680]  tell me when i don't have when i've got problems they say man well this guy's really miscalculated
[43:22.680 --> 43:27.480]  so and i'm not saying that to act tough even time magazine says you don't have a case but
[43:27.480 --> 43:30.920]  he's got a billion dollars so i guess he wants to put me through it well here's the deal i'll get
[43:30.920 --> 43:36.840]  attorney's fees it's just the time and and what it'll take let's scroll down it shows him with
[43:36.840 --> 43:42.280]  his wife or girlfriend beautiful um a muslim looking lady or cursing like let's click on it
[43:42.280 --> 43:46.760]  you know he lets his wife or girlfriend is out without a hood over her head a lot of Kurds women
[43:46.760 --> 43:51.000]  have more freedom in Kurdistan let me show that photo she's scrolling down it's right there it's
[43:51.000 --> 43:58.200]  in that article i saw it online it's the top uh well anyways i i just searched this morning uh
[43:58.200 --> 44:03.080]  shabani alex jones and if you just click it uh it was in uh all the stories i saw on my phone at
[44:03.080 --> 44:07.640]  least and if there is with his beautiful wife or girlfriend enjoying freedom in america great
[44:07.640 --> 44:11.720]  bro that's what i want to see she's wearing pretty black dress she gets to go out she gets to have
[44:11.720 --> 44:16.920]  freedom and if you're like that that's great come out and clarify because i've clarified
[44:16.920 --> 44:22.600]  and i retracted the headline that that i said yeah that's a little extreme but we didn't do that on
[44:22.600 --> 44:27.560]  purpose we were covering the other headlines with our news and you know that so you want some publicity
[44:32.520 --> 44:35.800]  i'm still gonna cover whatever's going on with you but if you want to go the whole nine yards
[44:35.800 --> 44:41.400]  with me just look what i've done in court in other cases we don't back down info wars.com
[44:41.400 --> 44:45.960]  forward slash show our listeners don't back down spread the links stand up against the globalist
[44:45.960 --> 44:50.600]  supporters buy the products pray for us we're all on the same team i want to thank the listeners
[44:50.600 --> 44:58.200]  worldwide now let's go to paul joseph watson in studio we're live it's wednesday april 26 on the
[44:58.200 --> 45:03.960]  alex jones show again another huge show lined up stefan molyneux is coming up in the next hour to
[45:03.960 --> 45:08.840]  talk about north korea the french election the fallout from that obviously the polls show that
[45:08.840 --> 45:13.960]  the establishment candidate mackron as we've been discussing is way ahead what can marine
[45:13.960 --> 45:20.200]  lupin do if anything to pull that back over the next 10 days or so james wesley rolls is going to
[45:20.200 --> 45:25.640]  be on in the third hour to talk about all these uh mass terror attack drills that are going on in
[45:25.640 --> 45:32.360]  new york washington dc and other cities as it relates to north korea we also have mic syrnovich
[45:32.360 --> 45:37.240]  coming on in the third hour to talk about his big story about saudi arabia obtaining arms
[45:37.240 --> 45:43.720]  uh basically a mcmaster neocon coup could be happening we're going to drill into that with
[45:43.720 --> 45:48.920]  mic syrnovich first though we're going to go to this clip and then i'm going to talk about it which
[45:48.920 --> 45:55.800]  is evanke trump and this is why many people remain concerned about president donald trump being
[45:55.800 --> 46:01.800]  surrounded by globalists being surrounded by people with interests and agendas that the american
[46:01.800 --> 46:08.920]  people did not vote for one of whom could very well be evanke trump today she says and this is
[46:08.920 --> 46:15.400]  a daily caller headline evanke trump resettling syrian refugees in u.s should be part of the
[46:15.400 --> 46:21.640]  discussion let's go to the clip in germany her father's far from popular the president's
[46:21.640 --> 46:27.480]  controversial travel ban a stark contrast to germany opening its doors to syrian refugees
[46:27.480 --> 46:33.480]  evanke trump now going further than her father on whether those refugees should be led into the u.s
[46:34.680 --> 46:42.360]  i think there is a global humanitarian crisis that's happening and we have to come together
[46:42.360 --> 46:48.040]  and we have to solve it and and you know refugees get include opening the borders to syrian refugees
[46:48.040 --> 46:51.640]  in the u that has to be part of the discussion but that's not going to be enough in and of itself
[46:51.640 --> 46:57.400]  now there's evanke trump basically reversing donald trump's policy before the election
[46:57.400 --> 47:03.480]  saying that the u.s should open its borders for syrian refugees that's very misinformed
[47:03.480 --> 47:07.560]  at best of course you know we've covered the stories over and over again in fact just a
[47:07.560 --> 47:13.960]  few days ago we had a story out of italy which found that only 2.65 percent of the people coming
[47:13.960 --> 47:21.400]  into europe through italy were actually refugees okay the vast majority of these people are not
[47:21.400 --> 47:28.680]  syrian they're not even refugees they're economic migrants so to call for them to just be allowed
[47:28.680 --> 47:34.200]  into the united states again shows a very limited very misinformed very naive perspective there you
[47:34.200 --> 47:40.360]  see bright bought reporting only 2.65 percent of the refugees the migrants coming in actually got
[47:40.360 --> 47:46.920]  refugee status and as you can see not many women and children are there not many syrians
[47:46.920 --> 47:52.600]  okay news flash syrian people aren't black those people are coming from west africa
[47:52.600 --> 47:58.120]  they're not syrian refugees they're picking them up i've talked about it over and over
[47:58.120 --> 48:03.800]  we have ngo's working with the european union picking them up 11 miles off the coast of libya
[48:03.800 --> 48:10.120]  they work directly with criminal people smugglers who call them up on the phone an hour before and
[48:10.120 --> 48:16.680]  say we've got a new boatload of migrants to dump into italy they're not refugees they're not syrian
[48:16.680 --> 48:23.320]  that is the huge bulk of the quote refugees coming into europe now if anka trump is out on
[48:23.320 --> 48:30.440]  the today's show saying that the us needs to open its borders people are rightly concerned about this
[48:30.440 --> 48:36.120]  is she an outright globalist or is she just naive misinformed a bleeding heart liberal
[48:36.120 --> 48:42.680]  well she's been hanging out with christine legard formerly of the imf and of course angela merkel
[48:43.240 --> 48:50.760]  german chancellor who oversaw the importation of what is probably now up to 2 million migrants
[48:50.760 --> 48:54.680]  and look at the problems that have taken place in germany we have sexual assaults on a regular
[48:54.680 --> 49:01.240]  basis we had the berlin truck attack just a few months ago this is not what the american people
[49:01.240 --> 49:07.560]  voted for and again the policy of bombing the people in syria who are fighting isis which is
[49:07.560 --> 49:14.280]  what happened what about three four weeks ago again behind the scenes supported by ivanka trump
[49:14.280 --> 49:19.880]  that is not going to help the situation if you actually look at the polls and we've highlighted
[49:19.880 --> 49:27.800]  them before 21 percent of syrians support isis it was an independent poll they asked people in
[49:27.800 --> 49:33.720]  all these different middle eastern countries 21 percent of syrian support isis so yes you are
[49:33.720 --> 49:40.040]  going to get genuine refugees genuine families fleeing from war fleeing from isis persecution
[49:40.760 --> 49:44.840]  but you're also going to get terrorist and you've seen the pictures you've seen the problems that
[49:44.840 --> 49:50.680]  have unfolded in europe it's not as simple as just opening the borders like if anka trump says
[49:50.680 --> 49:56.840]  what happened to extreme vetting the travel ban got shot down there you see the article study 21
[49:56.840 --> 50:01.400]  percent of syrian support isis you scroll down there's a poll there which you can zoom into
[50:02.200 --> 50:10.440]  support for isis in muslim countries 21 syria now those are the people who admit it it's probably
[50:10.440 --> 50:15.400]  even more than that and so if you want to just have syrian refugees coming in well of course you
[50:15.400 --> 50:21.480]  need extreme vetting but again the american people didn't vote for that you have turkey on record
[50:21.480 --> 50:28.760]  you have judge soros on record saying that they are using migrants as a weapon urdoan in turkey
[50:28.760 --> 50:33.960]  has said it over and over and over again so this is not the solution to the problem the solution
[50:33.960 --> 50:41.000]  is to stop bombing the people who are fighting isis in syria and to create safe zones within syria
[50:41.640 --> 50:47.160]  what is evanke trump saying when she's calling for the us to just swing its borders wide open
[50:47.160 --> 50:52.920]  that's not what americans voted for we'll be back live on the ice jones show breaking news coming

[52:19.000 --> 52:24.680]  the water they took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis

[54:25.320 --> 54:29.800]  should basically open its borders to syrian refugees or at least that should be part of the
[54:29.800 --> 54:34.520]  discussion wasn't part of the discussion during the campaign it was obviously something that
[54:34.520 --> 54:40.520]  donald trump ran against after he was misinformed on it remember there was that clip a few months
[54:40.520 --> 54:45.720]  before the election campaign really picked up when he said yeah we should just let the refugees in
[54:46.360 --> 54:51.240]  he was red-pilled on it it appears as though if onka trump has gone back on that or maybe she
[54:51.240 --> 54:57.240]  believed it all along and with the other worrying signs coming out of the trump administration which
[54:57.240 --> 55:02.440]  we're going to cover with stephan mollin new people are concerned and it's the elephant in the living
[55:02.440 --> 55:07.000]  room so we're going to cover it doesn't mean we're supporting hillary clinton doesn't mean we're not

[1:00:27.400 --> 1:00:33.160]  on this wednesday edition from austin texas stefan molyneux is coming up in the next segment
[1:00:33.800 --> 1:00:39.560]  we played the clip earlier ivanka trump saying that resettling syrian refugees opening the borders
[1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:45.320]  to syrian refugees needs to be part of the discussion this is causing absolute huge concern
[1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:51.000]  amongst trump's base bearing in mind she's been hanging out with angela merkel and christine
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:57.400]  legard of the imf angela merkel the same woman who oversaw the disastrous policy of allowing up to
[1:00:57.400 --> 1:01:04.840]  two million migrants into germany despite the fact that merkel herself admitted on the record
[1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:11.960]  back in 2010 that multiculturalism has failed daisy of anka trump hanging out with two top
[1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:18.920]  globalists while advocating globalist policies is anyone worried about this given how close
[1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:25.080]  ivanka trump is to the white house to donald trump now of course trump is very impressionable
[1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:32.520]  he takes advice from all sides we need to continue giving him good advice because he seems to be
[1:01:32.520 --> 1:01:38.520]  getting a lot of bad advice in recent weeks ivanka trump also wrote an editorial in the
[1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:45.160]  financial times you can probably find it with the president of the world bank group so she's
[1:01:45.160 --> 1:01:51.480]  hanging out with you know presidents of the world bank angela merkel christine legard all top
[1:01:51.480 --> 1:01:58.200]  globalists while advocating purely globalist policies the same policies advocated by the likes
[1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:04.600]  of peter southerland as alex talked about earlier by the likes of george soros so that's the worst
[1:02:04.600 --> 1:02:09.880]  case scenario the best case scenario is that she's just a bleeding heart humanitarian and is you
[1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:15.800]  know completely misinformed about the migrant crisis you can look at the isis controlled areas
[1:02:15.800 --> 1:02:23.240]  of syria and iraq even at the peak of isis control a couple of years ago which is now quickly waning
[1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:30.840]  there were 3.7 million people living in those areas controlled by isis so if you want to drill
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:36.520]  down into true refugees who are under bombardment who are living in war who are living under isis
[1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:42.280]  persecution even at the height of that it was 3.7 now they're saying the isis has lost basically
[1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:48.120]  half or more of its territory so even to be generous you're talking about you know about two million
[1:02:48.120 --> 1:02:53.960]  people who in syria and iraq are still living under isis persecution and that's horrific that's
[1:02:53.960 --> 1:02:59.560]  terrible we should do everything we can to help them by creating those safe zones by donating
[1:02:59.560 --> 1:03:05.240]  vast amounts of money doing everything we can but again if you take that number two million
[1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:12.840]  actual refugees germany has taken in almost that number alone on its own already in the past two
[1:03:12.840 --> 1:03:20.280]  years so we can already accommodate the actual refugees that's not who's coming in the u n numbers
[1:03:20.280 --> 1:03:29.080]  show that it's 75 plus probably even higher now are not syrian again 75 plus are men they're not
[1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:34.600]  women and children you can go to the calais migrant camp which reporters have gone to it and noted
[1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:41.000]  basically no children they're from eritrea they're from all these different countries none of which
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:47.560]  is syria tiny amount of these refugees are actually from syria and again judge sorris has
[1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:52.120]  gone on record turkeys erdogan has gone on record and says that you know we're going to use these
[1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:56.120]  as a weapon if you don't let turkey in the eu for example we're going to continue to use these
[1:03:56.120 --> 1:04:02.600]  migrants as a weapon they're not being resettled in the rich gulf state countries that are close
[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:08.600]  to syria that have the same culture that speak the same language those countries are taking in
[1:04:08.600 --> 1:04:16.200]  precisely zero syrian refugees so why should the burden be on america given that this whole refugee
[1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:21.480]  problem has been completely mischaracterized the vast majority of these people are not
[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:26.840]  refugees they're economic migrants so if you want to make a different argument
[1:04:26.840 --> 1:04:31.080]  for just allowing the entire third world to move to the west then fine but that's a completely
[1:04:31.080 --> 1:04:37.560]  different argument to couch it in terms of humanitarianism is fundamentally dishonest
[1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:43.080]  because again the vast majority of these people coming in are not refugees and you would think
[1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:49.400]  at some level if on katromb understood that so why is she now advocating for it given the huge
[1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:54.760]  problems crime terrorism that have occurred in europe over the past two years we'll be back on
[1:04:54.760 --> 1:05:05.560]  the alex jump show live with stefan mollin you don't go away google wants to save you from fake

[1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:36.680]  new changes are in response to the fake news outbreak of 2016 when the russians infiltrated

[1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:51.880]  election so far it remains unclear how the state of california was immune to the russians propaganda

[1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:47.000]  new of free domain radio dot com stephan welcome back thanks for a great to be here how you doing
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:50.360]  good now i just want to get into some of this trump news just to start off with obviously
[1:08:50.360 --> 1:08:54.440]  we're going to get on to the uh french election that's going to be the bulk of the discussion but
[1:08:55.080 --> 1:08:59.800]  evanka trump we played the clip earlier actually if you can cue that clip up again that would be
[1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:04.840]  uh illustrative for this uh part of the discussion let's roll the clip this is evanka trump on the
[1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:11.640]  today's show talking about refugees in germany her father's far from popular the president's
[1:09:11.640 --> 1:09:17.480]  controversial travel ban a stark contrast to germany opening its doors to syrian refugees
[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:23.480]  evanka trump now going further than her father on whether those refugees should be led into the us
[1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:32.360]  i think there is a global humanitarian crisis that's happening and we have to come together
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:38.200]  and we have to solve it and and you know refugees opening the borders to syrian refugees in the
[1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:43.400]  that has to be part of the discussion but that's not going to be enough in and of itself now stephan
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:50.360]  evanka trump she's meeting with legard she's meeting with angela merkel top globalist merkel
[1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:56.120]  of course pioneered the disastrous uh migrant policy in germany she's writing editorials in
[1:09:56.120 --> 1:10:02.280]  the financial times with the president of the world bank she's calling now for the us to take
[1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:09.960]  in refugees stephan correct me if i'm wrong that doesn't sound very america firsty does it well i
[1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:15.320]  mean there's a lot behind it of course paul i mean if it is a humanitarian crisis of the first order
[1:10:15.320 --> 1:10:20.120]  then it is the result of the government program called arm sales called arming isis called meddling
[1:10:20.120 --> 1:10:25.240]  in the middle east called regime change just another example of how one disastrous program
[1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:30.600]  called regime change leads to another disastrous program called immigration bottomless immigration
[1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:35.240]  from the third world is there a humanitarian crisis of course there is for some of the syrians
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:41.320]  there is a huge problem and the best thing to do if you care about this crisis is to resettle them
[1:10:41.320 --> 1:10:46.440]  in the middle east the cost is very very clear if you want to help 10 000 refugees if you want
[1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:50.520]  to help them in the middle east you can resettle them for 10.6 million us dollars if you want to
[1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:57.640]  bring them to america it's going to cost you 128.7 million dollars it is 12 plus times the cost
[1:10:57.640 --> 1:11:03.240]  to bring these supposed refugees if in fact that's what they are to america to resettle them if you
[1:11:03.240 --> 1:11:07.560]  actually want to help these people then stop doing regime changes in the middle east help them
[1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:12.760]  resettle in the middle east where they have a much greater chance of success in the long run now
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:18.200]  correct me if i'm wrong but i'm right in saying that the majority of these migrants refugees are
[1:11:18.200 --> 1:11:24.680]  illiterate in their own language never mind english that's right correct well two thirds are the
[1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:29.320]  syrian refugees who reach europe are illiterate in their own language and recently i think it was
[1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:34.920]  in italy paul they did a scan of the the people pouring in across the boats right there's a lot
[1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:40.200]  of NGOs who set up this kind of uber from hell ferry service to bring people from north africa
[1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:46.840]  into europe which is exactly what godafi warned about if he was going to be ousted by the obama
[1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:52.360]  hillary clinton a regime change goal in libya he said if you take down this wall everyone from
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:57.800]  africa is going to try and flood into europe and in italy they did an analysis of a bunch of the
[1:11:57.800 --> 1:12:03.720]  migrants who landed and only three percent of them were syrian refugees and so no it is a massive
[1:12:03.720 --> 1:12:08.520]  migration from a significantly overpopulated africa which has partly resulted from massive
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:13.320]  amounts of food aid and other kinds of foreign aid that's been showered on the continent setting off
[1:12:13.320 --> 1:12:18.040]  you know massive birth rates in an overpopulation crisis and so again we have this whole series of
[1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:23.640]  dominos ill thought out virtue signaling nonsense destructive government programs just lead to more
[1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:28.280]  and more and more disastrous and i don't think that the trump administration is going to take
[1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:34.120]  all this very seriously but it is not very comforting to hear this kind of talk going on
[1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:38.520]  there was a report i think it was out of bright spot a few weeks ago that showed that in a period
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:44.360]  of time since um trump you know got into the white house the pace of refugees coming into
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:50.120]  america had doubled in comparison with the same time period uh under obama so that is of massive
[1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:55.320]  concern the travel ban got shot down the figures i were looking at earlier showed that you know even
[1:12:55.320 --> 1:13:02.760]  at the height of isis's control of territory in iraq and syria they had about 3.7 million people
[1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:08.600]  living under them of course under isis persecution now they've lost more than half of their territory
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:14.520]  it's more like to be generous two million people you know germany has already taken in almost two
[1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:20.680]  million people in the last two years those are actual refugees which of course we can um counter
[1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:25.320]  that the idea that it's a good idea to bring them in in the first place with the illiteracy with the
[1:13:25.320 --> 1:13:30.920]  problems with integration but i mean two million people the people coming into europe and not syrian
[1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:35.880]  refugees we've tried to make that point over and over again do you think people like ivanka trump who
[1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:41.400]  are advising the president and he's very impressionable do you think as he said they're just doing this
[1:13:41.400 --> 1:13:48.120]  out of virtue signaling out of naivety or is this part of the concern that some people have got that
[1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:54.600]  neocons globalists are increasingly surrounding trump and that the swamp is draining him well
[1:13:54.600 --> 1:14:01.400]  that's a good question whether it is misguided uh altruism uh that they want to do the right thing
[1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:07.080]  they want to help people or whether it is part of some sinister destabilized western civilization
[1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:11.640]  plan i got to tell you i mean initially i was like well it's well-meaning people but you know
[1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:15.720]  they just don't have the facts they just don't have all the data they just don't understand the
[1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:21.160]  consequences of what they're advocating but i tell you paul since the information has been escalating
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:26.600]  and the disasters of this non-integration have been accumulating uh it's really really hard
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:32.440]  to ascribe these kinds of disastrous decisions and policies to mere naivety when you see of course
[1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:37.960]  as you've we've talked about before uh in france the second generation of muslim immigrants tends
[1:14:37.960 --> 1:14:43.400]  to be more radicalized than the first generation when you see this massive increase in migrant
[1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:48.600]  crime over 50 percent year over year in germany when you start to see the emergence of a genuine
[1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:53.720]  rape culture in sweden it's really really hard to continue to say well they're just misguided
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:58.440]  because the facts are very very clear the challenges and the failures are very very
[1:14:58.440 --> 1:15:02.360]  clear so people who are continuing down this road i'm beginning less and less to believe
[1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:07.560]  in any kind of purity of motive let's flash this headline up and i'll read part of it this is out
[1:15:07.560 --> 1:15:13.240]  of information liberation neocon paul wolfowitz speaking privately with mcmaster and mattis the
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:18.840]  article states neocon warhawk paul wolf wolfowitz is now optimistic about president trump and
[1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:24.040]  privately emailing hr mcmaster and james mattis to whore for more wars that's the commentary in
[1:15:24.040 --> 1:15:30.360]  the article in the middle east we have a never trump her helen ferre is now part of the white
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:35.400]  house that came out in a bright bar article this morning we have wolf it's wolfowitz speaking
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:41.480]  privately with mattis with mcmaster we have lindsay graham saying he's the happiest dude ever
[1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:49.560]  stephan this this 4d chess games really getting quite convoluted isn't it well i'm going to
[1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:54.280]  suggest that it's a marathon not a sprint which is kind of a cliche to say but i think people need
[1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:59.160]  to remember that there was no question in anyone's mind who studied this matter in any depth
[1:15:59.160 --> 1:16:02.840]  that the deep state was going to fight back they weren't going to just roll over and say well you
[1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:07.640]  know he got a whole bunch of electoral college votes so let's just hand up over this drug called
[1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:12.440]  power and all of this money and all of this deference and all of this control that we have
[1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:18.360]  over the population they weren't going to do it they view trump as i think as a kind of bug that's
[1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:22.920]  approaching the windshield of the deep state and they think they view that they can co-opt him and
[1:16:22.920 --> 1:16:27.000]  you know is it possible sure theoretically it's possible which is i think his base needs to keep
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:31.400]  reminding him of what they put him in the white house for what they need for him to do because
[1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:35.720]  if it's not going to be trump if trump can't take on and win against the deep state at least
[1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:40.520]  to some degree then i'm going right back to abstract philosophy because political action
[1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:44.600]  will have proven itself to be thoroughly useless in practice and then we just have to hunker down
[1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:49.720]  and wait for the crash and again the point i make is you know trump is very impressionable he has
[1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:55.000]  different circles of people that surround him at different times giving giving him different advice
[1:16:56.200 --> 1:17:01.000]  you know the deportations have increased that's a positive we do need to celebrate the positives
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:06.600]  the wall seems like it's been delayed but again he's impressionable we're not abandoning him but
[1:17:06.600 --> 1:17:12.360]  by the same token we're not being sycophants it's it's credible and we maintain our credibility
[1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:18.520]  and our consistency if we question him on these issues like if you send 59 tom hulk missiles
[1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:24.520]  into syria to help the people who are fighting isis that's a policy i've opposed for what five
[1:17:24.520 --> 1:17:29.880]  six years now i'm still going to oppose that policy i'm not going to just suddenly do a 180 just
[1:17:29.880 --> 1:17:34.920]  because um you know donald trump's behind it and that's that's your position i guess right stefa
[1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:40.680]  well if i sort of were to look at the sort of global chess master move paul i would say something
[1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:47.080]  like the following the refugees um our refugees because they want to go back that's sort of the
[1:17:47.080 --> 1:17:52.120]  theory that you escape when your house is on fire to a motel and then when your house is rebuilt
[1:17:52.120 --> 1:17:58.120]  you move back on whatever can contribute to any kind of political stability uh in syria in particular
[1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:02.840]  also in libya and other countries that have been smashed by leftists and globalists whatever can
[1:18:02.840 --> 1:18:08.360]  contribute to that stability whatever in the sense uh noses we have to hold in order to support
[1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:13.640]  somebody who can bring political stability to that region then we find out whether it's refugees
[1:18:13.640 --> 1:18:17.800]  or economic migrants who are there to invade and potentially take over the culture that's
[1:18:17.800 --> 1:18:22.760]  when we find out because if syria is stabilized under Assad which seems like the only reasonable
[1:18:22.760 --> 1:18:27.720]  approach at the moment if syria is stabilized then of course what can happen is we can say okay
[1:18:27.720 --> 1:18:33.480]  house is out out of fire and fire's out house has been rebuilt uh off you go back now if they're like
[1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:37.480]  woof thank you for the uh thank you for putting us up while our house was on fire we'd love to go
[1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:43.000]  back home then um i guess we can look at it one way if however you know they vanish into the no
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:48.200]  go zones and don't show up uh to go back home then we can start to look at it quite another way
[1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:52.040]  and it is actually my prediction that should stability come to syria it will be the latter
[1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:57.160]  that will happen to a lot of these migrants in europe now i want to move on to france of course
[1:18:57.160 --> 1:19:03.000]  we had the big election um on sunday we've got the second round coming up on may the seventh the polls
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:09.240]  show that um marine lapan has basically got a mountain to climb to come back here against macron
[1:19:09.240 --> 1:19:13.560]  and overturn that deficit um actually we're going to get into that after the break because we're
[1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:18.280]  running out of time on this segment we're going to go to a clip after the break where macron visits
[1:19:18.280 --> 1:19:25.080]  i think it's a warehouse or a factory and within about 30 seconds is absolutely pelted with catcalls
[1:19:25.080 --> 1:19:29.880]  and booze and marine lapan visits the same factory i believe or a different factory but you know
[1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:36.200]  similar circumstance big press scrum around her workers at the factory and the reaction to marine
[1:19:36.200 --> 1:19:40.520]  lapan is quite different indeed so we're going to play that clip after the break and go back to

[1:24:54.280 --> 1:25:00.360]  okay now those booze and whistles you heard in that clip were coming from workers at a
[1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:06.840]  whirlpool factory in france which was visited by the french presidential frontrunner immanuel
[1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:12.040]  macron you can cut that clip now what's interesting about this is marine le pen basically trolled him
[1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:17.800]  she turned up at the same factory all the workers rushed to her they were all rushing around her
[1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:22.680]  adoration you can see the photo if you scroll down the west monster article french workers
[1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:29.800]  cheer le pen heckle macron so he got absolute dogs abuse as soon as he arrived marina le pen
[1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:35.320]  got worshiped basically and this really crystallizes it for me stefan you know i read an article yesterday
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:42.600]  i think it was the telegraph and they were still billing macron as a quote maverick outsider
[1:25:42.600 --> 1:25:48.360]  you know stefan how many people in the real world how many maverick outsiders emerge from within a
[1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:54.360]  ruling bureaucracy having had their campaigns bankrolled by ross schilding company you you
[1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:59.080]  can always tell an outsider by how often they've attended a bill de berger conference a bill de
[1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:05.080]  berg conference that is the way it goes he is a vanity hologram he's like barack oblander because
[1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:11.800]  what he did he's a marketing ghost he's a chauncey gardener because before he announced his candidacy
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:16.920]  this is taking his cue from the obama campaign in 2008 what did he do well he he had a whole bunch
[1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:23.320]  of french voters surveyed 25 000 pretty in-depth interviews and figured out exactly what they
[1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:29.160]  wanted which cliches would wrestle the vote from their stony hearts and so that's exactly what he
[1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:33.240]  did he got all of this marketing material out there he got all of what the voters want to hear
[1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:39.400]  and he produces a ridiculously convoluted and self well self complicating self-contradicting
[1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:44.040]  kind of campaign and nobody knows what he's all about because he's just this vanity mirror
[1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:48.520]  according to a recent survey only 31 percent of french voters have any kind of clear idea
[1:26:48.520 --> 1:26:54.520]  of what macron is going to do when he gets office and that's far below his rivals and what what is
[1:26:54.520 --> 1:27:00.280]  he going to do oh he's going to cut taxes but he's also going to increase spending on unemployment
[1:27:00.280 --> 1:27:04.200]  and there's going to be a lot of spending on public infrastructure and he's going to shift to
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:09.640]  renewable energy for renewable energy and so on so yes a lot more spending but he's going to cut taxes
[1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:13.320]  and i'm going to tell you whatever we want to hear and i'm kind of pretty and i have a
[1:27:13.320 --> 1:27:18.440]  skeletor for a wife so how that adds up to a compelling candidate one can only say good job
[1:27:18.440 --> 1:27:23.560]  french public schools you have completely stripped any critical thinking from your subjects and with
[1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:28.760]  the renewable energy thing they tried that in spain it was an absolute disaster youth unemployment
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:32.760]  shot through the roof and that's one of the main reasons why young people are voting for lippen
[1:27:32.760 --> 1:27:39.080]  they've got a 25 percent youth unemployment rate and yet macron on the same token says that you
[1:27:39.080 --> 1:27:45.480]  know immigration is desperately needed to keep the economy vibrant how vibrant do you think that 25
[1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:51.240]  percent youth unemployed feel about their economic future well especially do migrants and especially
[1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:57.000]  if they're coming in from lower-rent districts in africa there's just no way in any conceivable
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:02.680]  time frame that they're going to be net contributors to the french economy as a whole that is completely
[1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:06.680]  insane something's happened in the west ball it's completely incomprehensible like we've given up on
[1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:11.000]  the idea of just having babies what's wrong with having sex and having babies i believe the french
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:14.680]  are fairly proficient in the first part of that equation at least what's wrong with just having
[1:28:14.680 --> 1:28:19.240]  babies well of course what's wrong with having babies for the politicians paul is that babies
[1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:24.120]  cost politicians money and don't give them instant leftist voting patterns right so of course
[1:28:24.120 --> 1:28:29.240]  immigrants particularly from third world reliably vote for the left which is why they're constantly
[1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:33.880]  want to be drawn in by the left and of course they can conceivably at least start contributing
[1:28:33.880 --> 1:28:38.600]  taxes if not votes but if you have children well you've got to supply them with education and
[1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:43.240]  health care and people need bigger houses and so on so that cost politicians money and they only
[1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:47.560]  start paying taxes in about a quarter century or so so what politician well worth his salt and
[1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:51.800]  vote buying in the here and now wants to wait a quarter century for a more babies policy to
[1:28:51.800 --> 1:28:56.920]  pay off with additional taxes so this is part of the whole decline of the greed of the baby boomers
[1:28:56.920 --> 1:29:01.640]  who wanted everything for nothing and now we're all paying the price in potential collective
[1:29:01.640 --> 1:29:07.240]  cultural catastrophe and on that same subject and we're going to get more into this after the break
[1:29:07.240 --> 1:29:13.800]  the immigration aspect of it six months after this guy ran down mowed down 86 people killed 86
[1:29:13.800 --> 1:29:20.520]  injured injured over 400 in nice macron came out and said that europeans quote must get used to mass
[1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:25.880]  immigration he did it again after the police officer was gone down in paris he said police
[1:29:25.880 --> 1:29:30.040]  french people had to learn to live with terrorism it seems there's some kind of a
[1:29:30.040 --> 1:29:35.800]  national psyche that dominates france which is still based around total capitulation
[1:29:35.800 --> 1:29:40.440]  given the current poll numbers if we're to believe them we'll get back into it more with
[1:29:40.440 --> 1:29:47.240]  stefan mollin you free domain radio dot com after the break also alex jones will call in live don't
[1:29:47.240 --> 1:30:00.520]  go away we'll be back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[1:30:23.400 --> 1:30:29.240]  meeting over north korea that included a phone call between president trump and china over the
[1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:35.800]  escalating tensions in the region and china says world war three is inevitable as north korea

[1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:45.480]  was just mentioning before the break again the immigration issue we have six jihadist attacks
[1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:52.040]  in paris alone in the last three years you know 21 jihadist attacks in france since charlie hebdo
[1:33:52.040 --> 1:33:58.040]  yet manwell vows the prime minister of france and macron himself on numerous occasions have come
[1:33:58.040 --> 1:34:03.800]  out time and time again and said this is something that we have to live with do you think it's
[1:34:03.800 --> 1:34:10.280]  you know part of the psyche the national psyche of the french people that is you know centered
[1:34:10.280 --> 1:34:15.320]  around submission and capitulation given given their history or is that just something that's
[1:34:15.320 --> 1:34:21.000]  specific to the left as a whole this kind of stock home syndrome sit your head in the sand
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:27.640]  identify with your captors and just hope that it's all going to go away well i mean it has a whole
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:33.400]  history in in french philosophy and macron studied philosophy which of course is very very impressive
[1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:38.520]  to people not in france although fairly common to france and what's happened of course is that
[1:34:38.520 --> 1:34:44.520]  the left has dominated um higher education and the media for you know at least 30 to 50 years in
[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:50.520]  various western countries now 50 years ago it was the left who were very very big on nationalism
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:56.440]  very very big on national self-determination in the third world because it was really really bad
[1:34:56.440 --> 1:35:00.360]  to have all of these western powers in there dominating and bleeding dry the resources
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:05.400]  against the will of the people of those people in the third world and they loved you know sukarno
[1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:10.360]  cabral ho chi min and all these kinds of people because they were fighting to liberate their
[1:35:10.360 --> 1:35:15.560]  countries from external control and influence them to be nationalistic and patriotic now
[1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:20.760]  it's completely reversed now any country in europe that wants to get out from under the
[1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:26.440]  globalism of the eu is called far right because that's just a negative nazi brand that you can
[1:35:26.440 --> 1:35:31.880]  attach to anyone although le pen certainly economically is significantly left but she's
[1:35:31.880 --> 1:35:36.280]  on the quote far right as far as she respects the idea of nationalism and patriotism and has
[1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:41.000]  a respect for the domestic historical french culture so the left of course nobody seems to
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:46.600]  notice these serpentine twists and turns of leftist justifications when western countries go to
[1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:50.680]  third world countries and strip mine resources against the will of the domestic population
[1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:55.160]  that's colonialism that's exploitation that's really bad and the way to fight it is with
[1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:59.720]  nationalism when third world has come to western countries and strip mine state resources against
[1:35:59.720 --> 1:36:03.480]  the will of the population through the welfare state well that's multiculturalism and that's
[1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:10.040]  very positive and anyone who argues against it is a bad fascist nazi racist whatever right
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:13.720]  these hypocrisies at some point we're going to have to pick up on these twists and turns and
[1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:18.920]  fight back intellectually against this nonsense and some countries are further along than others
[1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:24.360]  um i think her decision to step down as national front leader before this uh final round is part
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:30.520]  of the effort to you know detoxify the brand the problem is from what i hear her father
[1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:35.880]  who of course represents some of the worst aspects of the brand he's set to give a speech on sunday
[1:36:35.880 --> 1:36:40.440]  that is not going to help her campaign so we'll wait to see if that comes off but another thing
[1:36:40.440 --> 1:36:45.640]  that you tweeted about yesterday i think which was this bizarre relationship between immanuel
[1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:53.080]  macron and his wife you tweeted quote 15-year-old immanuel macron kissing his 40-year-old married
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:59.080]  drama teacher who later divorced and married him now you know sefa and i understand that age gaps
[1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:03.880]  in relationships are perfectly natural and you know they can work within reasonable bounds but
[1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:11.880]  a 25-year age gap what does that tell us about macron well i know before everyone reacts with
[1:37:11.880 --> 1:37:16.760]  this that's the similar if not the same as the gap between uh evanke uh sorry between melania
[1:37:16.760 --> 1:37:23.720]  trump and um and donald trump but of course uh she was 28 when they met so yes she was his teacher
[1:37:23.720 --> 1:37:30.200]  40 years old and um he was 15 now the kiss is a more platonic kind of french style on the cheek
[1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:35.240]  kiss but uh he very much wanted to pursue her he suggested that they write a play together i can
[1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:40.920]  only imagine it was entitled a vacuous eatable but um they wrote a play together and then she began
[1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:47.800]  to pursue him he began to pursue her his parents tried to move him away from her but they continued
[1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:52.920]  their relationship and uh one of her daughters was his classmate while she was teaching him
[1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:58.120]  when she began to fixate upon him at the age of 15 now the age of consent in france is 15 and
[1:37:58.120 --> 1:38:01.720]  they say that it's a secret when their relationship became physical it's a secret
[1:38:01.720 --> 1:38:07.400]  i imagine for pretty obvious reasons but i don't think she's allowed to um have sexual relations
[1:38:07.400 --> 1:38:13.960]  with a student if she is in a position of power over him and um this is pretty horrendous stuff and
[1:38:13.960 --> 1:38:18.680]  of course we can just imagine if the situations were reversed and he was a 40-year-old teacher
[1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:25.400]  who began fixating on a 15-year-old teenage girl in his class and then pursued her and they ended
[1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:31.240]  up together it's um it's pretty messy and it's pretty ugly but of course it's france i mean you
[1:38:31.240 --> 1:38:36.280]  you have uh in france politicians all the time having these kinds of weird and creepy things
[1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:40.680]  set up and uh it actually sometimes even seems to help their cause in in ways that pass my
[1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:45.960]  understanding completely well the the thing that ties into this stuff and is you know we've got the
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:51.720]  polls showing 20 25 points ahead for macro the only thing that could probably and you know don't
[1:38:51.720 --> 1:38:56.520]  trust the polls they say but this is quite a big gap at this point the only thing that could probably
[1:38:56.520 --> 1:39:02.120]  bring him down at this point within the next 10 days is a massive scandal they've already set the
[1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:07.960]  narrative that if a scandal does emerge about macron that it's russian hackers to blame once again
[1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:12.440]  they actually had a new york times article yesterday if we can flash that up i think we had it during
[1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:18.040]  the fourth hour where they were saying again that russian hack hackers had tried to penetrate macrons
[1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:24.120]  party campaign emails very similar to the dnc leak there was actually another article which said that
[1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:29.160]  concerns about muslim migration there you see the new york times article there was another
[1:39:29.160 --> 1:39:36.040]  article which said concerns about muslim migration were vladimir putin's fault and that's that was
[1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:40.840]  marina lupin's whole campaign they said was concerns about muslim migration but that was a
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:47.960]  narrative a meme that vladimir putin had inserted into the entire narrative now you've had 20
[1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:54.920]  21 jihadist attacks in france you've had what 230 plus people murdered by jihadists over the past
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:40:00.760]  two and a bit years how on earth has that got anything to do with vladimir putin that's obviously
[1:40:00.760 --> 1:40:07.800]  an organic authentic natural concern for the french people yet they still try to spin this russian
[1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:13.720]  hackers narrative stefan they're so terrified despite the polls they're so terrified of a scandal
[1:40:13.720 --> 1:40:19.480]  coming out about macron about lupin pulling off a miracle that they're still spinning this russian
[1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:25.480]  narrative as a kind of fallback it's incredible well there is this terrible situation throughout the
[1:40:25.480 --> 1:40:31.560]  west as a whole a poll as you know where you arm everyone you invade everyone you bomb everyone
[1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:37.080]  and then you invite everyone and this is such a disastrous self-contradictory kind of policy
[1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:41.720]  that one again i'm what we talked about earlier i'm not sure i'm anywhere close to thinking that
[1:40:41.720 --> 1:40:47.000]  there's anything confused and positive and altruistic and benevolent you couldn't design a system more
[1:40:47.720 --> 1:40:52.600]  or better tripwire to take down western civilization than to spend massive amounts to strip mine
[1:40:52.600 --> 1:40:57.240]  taxpayers for money use it to buy arms sell it to dictatorships all over the world have very
[1:40:57.240 --> 1:41:02.280]  aggressive farm policy bomb people invade people and then invite all of the people into your country
[1:41:02.280 --> 1:41:07.160]  who you've been bombing and invading i mean it's completely incomprehensible from any standpoint
[1:41:07.160 --> 1:41:14.040]  other than a kind of sepuku on the entire culture it's just absolutely incredible i mean we say some
[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:17.880]  countries are further along than others and now there's big support in sweden for the sweden
[1:41:17.880 --> 1:41:23.800]  democrats which is actually surprising that they seem to be further ahead afd in germany seems to
[1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:29.160]  be falling behind they don't have great organization behind their party so we've had you know we've had
[1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:35.160]  global populism is ebbing away after the situation in holland with their election where gert wilders
[1:41:35.160 --> 1:41:40.760]  failed to win is it really ebbing away or are we just moving in different speeds in different countries
[1:41:41.720 --> 1:41:48.360]  well the future belongs to those who wanted the most that is the basic reality of history
[1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:52.600]  and if the people who want to preserve their culture are willing to do what it takes intellectually
[1:41:52.600 --> 1:41:56.280]  and organizationally and politically if they're willing to do what it takes to preserve their
[1:41:56.280 --> 1:42:00.920]  culture why then they get to preserve their culture and if they don't want to do it and if the other
[1:42:00.920 --> 1:42:06.280]  side is more organized and more efficient and more willing to do what it takes then they will lose
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:10.520]  their culture and one of the great things that's happening in france at the moment is leftists are
[1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:15.240]  really being exposed because you have of course marie le penne a woman who could become the first
[1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:20.040]  female president of france she's supported by a significant proportion of french women so french
[1:42:20.040 --> 1:42:24.520]  women want to vote for a french candidate to break through the glass ceiling and smash the patriarchy
[1:42:24.520 --> 1:42:29.960]  of globalism and the leftists hate le penne and the feminists seem to hate le penne which shows
[1:42:29.960 --> 1:42:35.080]  that they don't care about women they care about leftism you can see in france very clearly five
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:39.320]  percent of people in paris voted for le penne the people who are voting for le penne seem similar to
[1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:42.680]  the people who voted for trump the people who are outside the cities who are dealing with poverty
[1:42:42.680 --> 1:42:47.320]  who are dealing with proximate migrant problems and so on and the socialists don't care about them
[1:42:47.320 --> 1:42:51.640]  either so the feminists don't care about women and the socialists don't care about poor the poor
[1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:55.960]  and that's all you need to know about the french election as far as the takeaways for other countries
[1:42:55.960 --> 1:43:01.960]  go and of course marie le penne will probably be back in five years time she's got an east marie
[1:43:01.960 --> 1:43:06.280]  on le penne who is in some senses even more conservative than her she also got the most
[1:43:06.280 --> 1:43:10.920]  amount of votes from women which people tend to forget again with these feminist protesting against
[1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:15.000]  her literally trying to block people from voting for her let's move on though because we've got
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:19.640]  limited time let's talk about north korea now this is always a difficult one because you know kim
[1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:24.200]  jong il kim jong on they've been threatening to literally destroy the world for the best part of
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:30.120]  two decades now you never know how much of it is alarmism people in south korea tend to roll
[1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:34.920]  their eyes at this point whenever these tensions build up again that could be you know a normal
[1:43:34.920 --> 1:43:40.280]  see bias going on with that obviously they don't want to fear that annihilation is imminent so
[1:43:40.280 --> 1:43:46.360]  they always reflect um go back to normalcy bias so how much of it is alarmism i mean we do have
[1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:52.840]  today reuters reporting trump has called all 100 senators to the white house for a meeting
[1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:57.400]  they're calling it an unusual move he's going to talk about north korea some are speculating
[1:43:57.400 --> 1:44:04.440]  he's pushing for um support from those senators for an actual declaration of war yet we've heard
[1:44:04.440 --> 1:44:10.280]  this same um beating of the war drums the same alarmism for decades now just how alarmed should
[1:44:10.280 --> 1:44:15.560]  we be about the situation in north korea right now oh i think very alarmed i think very alarmed
[1:44:15.560 --> 1:44:20.520]  paul because if there is the idea that there's some kind of surgical strike that they can take out
[1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:25.720]  the north korean leadership in some sort of single strike decapitation that's my great
[1:44:25.720 --> 1:44:29.560]  temptation because history has shown that high IQ populations and the koreans are among the
[1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:34.840]  highest IQ population in the world high IQ high IQ populations do very well through regime change
[1:44:34.840 --> 1:44:39.880]  and you can look at sort of post-second world war germany and japan for examples of that more
[1:44:39.880 --> 1:44:44.920]  challenging or lower IQ populations do worse under regime change as we've seen in more recent
[1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:50.200]  wars in the middle east so if they can go in and take out the leadership then you are liberating
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:56.200]  20 plus million people from the world's largest open air concentration camp i can really see that
[1:44:56.200 --> 1:45:00.520]  being a positive thing sort of putting myself in their position i mean they're so starved as they
[1:45:00.520 --> 1:45:04.440]  talked about on a show recently paul they're so starved in north korea that even though they're
[1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:09.560]  genetically the same as south koreans they're four inches shorter and so it is a monstrous open
[1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:14.040]  air prison there if some sort of surgical strike could go in to take out the leadership and replace
[1:45:14.040 --> 1:45:18.360]  it unify the country which is different you know unify unification of east and west germany was
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:23.000]  a lot easier than trying to do regime change in iraq and so there is that possibility if it's a
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:27.560]  ground war though i think it's a disaster because then they'll have enough warning they will be able
[1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:31.880]  to launch their nuclear weapons soul is just a stone's throw away you got millions and millions of
[1:45:31.880 --> 1:45:37.160]  people there and that could be a true catastrophe for the region the repercussions of which will
[1:45:37.160 --> 1:45:43.080]  be felt biologically physically radioactively for generations it's difficult because china came out
[1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:48.040]  a few days ago and basically in that official global times mouthpiece and said you know we will
[1:45:48.040 --> 1:45:53.320]  not tolerate regime change in north korea but again as you said there is a temptation to be
[1:45:53.320 --> 1:45:59.000]  an interventionist in that sense because you know for a fact that it is they've literally got 200 000
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:04.760]  political dissidents in concentration camps the figure's probably higher by now it's also different
[1:46:04.760 --> 1:46:08.600]  to the middle east you know you're not going to get a vacuum where a bunch of horrible jihadists
[1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:14.760]  even worse than the dictatorship rush in and take power the the tyranny that they're living under i
[1:46:14.760 --> 1:46:19.880]  don't think people can grasp it we have defectors people who have escaped into japan into china
[1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:24.040]  come out with these stories i think one of my favorite is because it's based on the prisoner
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:30.280]  series which i'm a big fan of and they they copied it basically people in north korea they
[1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:37.320]  by law it's mandatory that they have a radio in their apartment broadcasting propaganda
[1:46:37.880 --> 1:46:44.520]  during daytime hours they can't turn it off they physically can't turn off the government propaganda
[1:46:44.520 --> 1:46:50.280]  they can only lower the volume so there is that temptation knowing the absolute terror
[1:46:50.280 --> 1:46:54.520]  that these people are placed under you know women have babies in these concentration camps
[1:46:54.520 --> 1:46:59.880]  they rip the babies out they strangle them absolutely horrific tales not coming out of
[1:46:59.880 --> 1:47:05.880]  the mainstream media but coming directly from defectors and numerous uh you know similar stories
[1:47:05.880 --> 1:47:12.280]  that they they they match up with each other i mean how can we make people grasp the tyranny
[1:47:12.280 --> 1:47:17.000]  that north koreans are living under given the well you you can have a tough time with that paul
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:21.240]  because of course it comes out of a communist history anything that comes out of a communist or
[1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:25.800]  socialist history is going to be downplayed by the mainstream media you know it's a real tragedy
[1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:31.160]  when you have world leaders or anybody reading 1984 not as a warning but as an instruction manual
[1:47:31.160 --> 1:47:36.760]  because of course the reminded of the telescreens when you're talking about these radios but if you
[1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:41.720]  look at what's going on in venezuela where on average people have lost 17 pounds over the last
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:46.200]  little while where you've got death squads being sort of put together by the government to put down
[1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:50.840]  dissent when you have starvation when you've got people hunting pigeons and rats just to try and
[1:47:50.840 --> 1:47:54.600]  stay alive well that comes out of socialist policies therefore it's going to be underreported
[1:47:54.600 --> 1:48:00.440]  on by the mainstream media the fact that north korea has evolved from the usual horror show right
[1:48:00.440 --> 1:48:05.000]  of the of the communist central planning and central control of the economy into the inevitable
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:09.320]  style and style culture personality they don't want to talk about it it's just some nameless
[1:48:09.320 --> 1:48:13.480]  dictatorship they never want to talk about how it came about which is the soviets and the chinese
[1:48:13.480 --> 1:48:19.000]  funding communists to invade the north and and take it over so it's really really hard to get the
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:23.640]  facts other than some vague nameless horror no lessons are being learned about central planning
[1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:28.200]  about centralized control about socialism and communism because that is the agenda of so much
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:33.400]  of the mainstream leftist media that they simply won't talk about the history you can't get any
[1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:37.800]  positive lessons that's why people come to you and i ball to get the actual lessons that people
[1:48:37.800 --> 1:48:42.040]  need to learn from these kinds of tragedies now you mentioned venezuela there stefan you have
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:49.640]  maduro handing out firearms to 400 000 loyalists we have this article i think it's the shtf point
[1:48:49.640 --> 1:48:55.880]  they're giving guns to 400 000 loyalists they've had these massive street protests isn't it interesting
[1:48:55.880 --> 1:49:02.520]  that they banned private ownership of firearms back in 2012 so they disarmed the population
[1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:07.560]  armed the loyalist thug brigade i mean stefan has there ever been a socialist experiment
[1:49:07.560 --> 1:49:14.200]  not just talking about venezuela on any kind of scale that hasn't led to mass starvation and bloodshed
[1:49:14.200 --> 1:49:21.320]  as it looks like could happen now in venezuela well i can't think of any time in history where
[1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:27.240]  the central banking the money printing the buying of votes the increasing control of the government
[1:49:27.240 --> 1:49:33.480]  over the economy the setting of prices the limiting of production it always leads to and it sounds so
[1:49:33.480 --> 1:49:38.760]  terribly cold and clinical because it is human lives at stake but this misallocation of resources
[1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:44.520]  that the great economist von mesus talked about us almost a hundred years ago in the 1920s he talked
[1:49:44.520 --> 1:49:49.160]  about this if you don't have a free market if you don't have a price system there's simply no
[1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:54.600]  conceivable way to efficiently allocate resources resources get wasted resources get squandered you
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:49:59.240]  can think of france with their lakes of wine and their mountains of butter that all get destroyed
[1:49:59.240 --> 1:50:03.080]  you can think of all of this terrible socialist stuff that goes on with food production where you
[1:50:03.080 --> 1:50:07.160]  dump food production into the third world destroying agriculture and stimulating birth
[1:50:07.160 --> 1:50:11.560]  rates which again produce starvation in the future it is human lives at stake when we
[1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:16.440]  have these abstract economic policies of centralized coercive control people die
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:22.040]  by the thousands by the hundreds of thousands and in north korea by the millions okay we're
[1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:27.240]  going to leave it there for now stefan mollin you free domain radio dot com the biggest

[2:00:30.760 --> 2:00:36.760]  james wesley rolls coming up with his hot take on operation gotham shield that huge nuclear bomb
[2:00:36.760 --> 2:00:43.720]  drill which is basically taking place across the east coast today is that a routine exercise or are
[2:00:43.720 --> 2:00:49.640]  they preparing for something specific in mind given all the threats with north korea that are
[2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:53.480]  building right now we'll talk to james wesley rolls about that we're going to dip into some news
[2:00:53.480 --> 2:00:59.560]  right now though french mayor found guilty of incitement for saying 91 percent muslim classrooms
[2:00:59.560 --> 2:01:06.280]  are a problem he committed the thought crime of saying that 91 percent muslim classrooms
[2:01:06.280 --> 2:01:12.280]  in a western country something not quite right about that that's not integration that's not
[2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:18.360]  multiculturalism that's monoculture that's a problem no can't say that that's a thought crime
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:23.480]  now he's being charged right wing mayor robert minard has been found guilty of a thought crime
[2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:28.680]  in france for saying schools with 91 muslim students are a problem a key advisor to marina
[2:01:28.680 --> 2:01:34.840]  le penne has been found guilty so they're trying to tie it into a pen inciting hatred against muslims
[2:01:35.400 --> 2:01:44.520]  so again inciting hatred is pointing out the fact that 91 muslim students is not integration
[2:01:44.520 --> 2:01:51.000]  is not multiculturalism he also posted a tweet as part of his thought crime comparing a school
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:55.880]  picture from the 1970s to one taken most most recently which he said proved the conspiracy
[2:01:55.880 --> 2:02:00.440]  theory of a great replacement which claims muslim immigrants are replacing the traditional
[2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:08.760]  french population which is completely true in some areas of france this is the ghettoization
[2:02:08.760 --> 2:02:13.880]  these are the schools in which we've had cases in britain where they're actually being taught
[2:02:13.880 --> 2:02:20.440]  radical propaganda in these muslim majority schools that's why it's a problem because they're
[2:02:20.440 --> 2:02:26.280]  actually creating that jihadist mindset at an incredibly early age like they do in some of
[2:02:26.280 --> 2:02:31.480]  them addresses like they do in some of the mosques but again they don't get shut down for hate speech
[2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:36.920]  sadeek khan the mayor of london is more interested in mean comments on the internet you have actual
[2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:42.680]  hate preachers preaching hate to terrorists who then carry out terrorist attacks that's not a problem
[2:02:42.680 --> 2:02:47.080]  this guy's a problem because he committed the thought crime of saying that 91 percent muslim
[2:02:47.080 --> 2:02:52.600]  classrooms that's not multiculturalism and it's the same in britain you have entire schools in
[2:02:53.160 --> 2:02:58.680]  birmingham and in the area where i live in london where you will see the kids go out and play in the
[2:02:58.680 --> 2:03:06.920]  park when they take them on trips there's one white kid and 25 arab kids okay that's not integration
[2:03:06.920 --> 2:03:13.000]  that's not multiculturalism that's monoculture they don't even speak english a lot of them
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:20.680]  it's a problem he simply noted it now he's being charged for inciting hatred against muslims that's
[2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:25.400]  the situation in france while they're literally being mowed down on the street by muslim migrants
[2:03:25.400 --> 2:03:30.520]  and immanuel macron says let's just invite more in and get used to it just get used to it this is
[2:03:30.520 --> 2:03:36.040]  how we're going to live from now on bright bar reports thousands of former taliban fighters
[2:03:36.040 --> 2:03:41.800]  may have entered germany thanks angela merkel germany's federal office for migration and refugees
[2:03:41.800 --> 2:03:47.560]  has confessed it is dealing with a four digit number of migrants with declared links to the
[2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:52.920]  taliban potentially endangering neighboring countries such as france this is out of der
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:58.360]  spiegel german federal prosecutors are currently investigating at least 70 afghans although it's
[2:03:58.360 --> 2:04:03.720]  unclear whether they are all suspected of links to the islamist group six have actually been
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:08.200]  detained in cases appending against several more with prosecutor general peter frank warning
[2:04:08.200 --> 2:04:12.840]  politicians that the authorities which are now contending with suspected islamic state
[2:04:12.840 --> 2:04:19.080]  sympathizers have now reached quote the limits of their capacity so now they're inviting in
[2:04:19.080 --> 2:04:28.200]  actual taliban fighters on top of isis fighters of course sweden 150 isis militants came back into
[2:04:28.200 --> 2:04:32.920]  sweden they let them back in because they felt sorry for them after they were chopping people's
[2:04:32.920 --> 2:04:38.280]  heads off they felt sorry for them so they wanted to give them jobs welfare housing that's how
[2:04:38.280 --> 2:04:44.600]  sweden treated them the stock home attack happened not long after that this is what they're doing in
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:50.600]  europe actually inviting in taliban inviting in islamic state with very little vetting whatsoever
[2:04:50.600 --> 2:04:55.160]  and it's leading to huge problems we'll be back with james wesley rolls on the alex jones

[2:08:26.440 --> 2:08:32.600]  operation got the shield their training is if a fake nuclear bomb has detonated in northern new
[2:08:32.600 --> 2:08:39.240]  jersey hundreds of first responders strike teams from across the region flooded metlife stadium to
[2:08:39.240 --> 2:08:45.960]  triage and treat thousands of pretend patients they set up a field hospital and a mobile emergency
[2:08:45.960 --> 2:08:52.200]  room as you can see it's a basically 48 foot or so tractor trailer this is a little higher this is a
[2:08:52.200 --> 2:08:58.680]  little lower everything kind of collapses in on itself once it's closed up we could drive anywhere
[2:08:58.680 --> 2:09:05.640]  and if we're on scene i'd say within 30 to 45 minutes we will be open and seeing patients
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:11.880]  they can also check people for radiation when a patient comes in we would do a quick a quick
[2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:17.640]  sweep of the patient with the with the guy or counter to make sure that they truly are safe
[2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:23.960]  the federal government is simultaneously performing a four-day nuclear training exercise led by fema
[2:09:23.960 --> 2:09:29.160]  the department of defense the domestic nuclear detection office and others are participating
[2:09:29.160 --> 2:09:34.040]  this exercise is separate but tacked on to what fema is doing today and tomorrow their
[2:09:34.040 --> 2:09:38.520]  training exercise is taking place entirely behind closed doors they'll be focusing on
[2:09:38.520 --> 2:09:45.800]  communication and coordination in response to a simulated nuclear attack that is operation
[2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:50.120]  gotham shield and we're going to talk about that with our guests now he is james wesley
[2:09:50.120 --> 2:09:56.600]  rolls former us army intelligence officer author of the patriots novel series he is the founder
[2:09:56.600 --> 2:10:03.320]  and senior editor of survival blog dot com james welcome back to the show thanks for having me on
[2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:07.960]  paul now i just want to get into operation gotham shield this is a huge drill taking place in
[2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:13.720]  numerous different cities in the northeast today absolutely massive drill nuclear bomb drill we
[2:10:13.720 --> 2:10:18.920]  heard the segment there i mean is this do you think this is just routine training or is it
[2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:24.440]  related to north korea do they expect some kind of massive you know paris style massacre attack
[2:10:25.080 --> 2:10:30.120]  given the details of this drill what do you think they're preparing for is it anything specific
[2:10:31.080 --> 2:10:37.000]  well i suspect that this training was scheduled months in advance so it's probably not in response
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:43.720]  to any really recent news from north korea but nuclear tensions are actually much higher now than
[2:10:43.720 --> 2:10:51.400]  they were during the cold war just most people don't realize it we have manifold threats out there
[2:10:52.040 --> 2:11:00.520]  and of course north korea is at the top of the list right now and i suspect that the planners
[2:11:00.520 --> 2:11:07.560]  within fema and the other federal agencies are anticipating perhaps a coastal attack
[2:11:07.560 --> 2:11:17.400]  by north korea i don't believe that they have the launch capability given the size of the
[2:11:17.960 --> 2:11:23.400]  nuclear bombs they have available they don't have rockets that can carry them all the way
[2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:30.360]  trans-pacific but they certainly have fairly advanced submarine technology so they could
[2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:43.080]  presumably drop off a nuclear device right at or near a coastline somewhere in a literal area
[2:11:44.040 --> 2:11:49.640]  and the the other option of course would be to to bring in a nuclear device on a cargo ship
[2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:54.600]  the advantage of bringing them in by submarine of course is that they would have the chance
[2:11:54.600 --> 2:12:01.960]  of having them being able to bring it in undetected and of course seawater once you have more than
[2:12:01.960 --> 2:12:08.280]  15 or 20 feet of seawater over a device it's essentially undetectable because it makes fantastic
[2:12:08.280 --> 2:12:16.440]  shielding water is makes actually quite good shielding for both nuclear power plants and for
[2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:23.080]  nuclear weapons in fact that's why you can go visit a nuclear power plant and look down into the pool
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:31.800]  and see the actual nuclear pile just 20 feet away from you in safety because it is such good
[2:12:31.800 --> 2:12:37.720]  shielding now i want to flash up this NBC headline because it relates to what you just talked about
[2:12:37.720 --> 2:12:44.520]  this is NBC today what should you do in case of nuclear attack don't run get inside the article
[2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:50.280]  states the simplest of the warnings is don't run get inside sheltering in place beneath as many layers
[2:12:50.280 --> 2:12:55.240]  of protection as possible is the best way to avoid the radiation that would follow a nuclear
[2:12:55.240 --> 2:13:01.960]  detonation so we have all these articles coming out about you know 1950s style preparation duck
[2:13:01.960 --> 2:13:07.560]  and cover that kind of thing in the mainstream media alongside the tensions with north korea
[2:13:07.560 --> 2:13:12.360]  james i mean this is a question i've wondered over and over again you know if if an uke did hit
[2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:17.000]  san francisco as you just described if if one was smuggled in or if north korea got the capability
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:23.800]  to do so you know given that a lot of millennials now get ptsd if you insult them on the internet
[2:13:23.800 --> 2:13:31.400]  how would today's generation cope with a scenario of actual nuclear war i just don't think they
[2:13:31.400 --> 2:13:36.520]  would even have the emotional stamina to face up to the reality of it it would be absolute
[2:13:36.520 --> 2:13:44.200]  bedlam right i have to agree with you paul i think that um that generation is is not very well
[2:13:44.200 --> 2:13:50.440]  prepared they didn't grow up under the nuclear threat like folks in my generation did they
[2:13:51.640 --> 2:13:57.640]  the the threat out there is real and it is actually prudent for families to prepare
[2:13:59.160 --> 2:14:06.920]  most importantly is you don't want to live right in a target area and in the case of north korea
[2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:11.720]  i think most of their targets would be the west coast of the united states would be the most likely
[2:14:11.720 --> 2:14:21.000]  target locations and if you can relocate i think it's wise to do so it's it's wise to do so just
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:27.320]  for societal demographic reasons if nothing else but the nuclear threat is just one more reason
[2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:35.640]  to leave the the major coastal cities and strategically relocate and once you've relocated
[2:14:35.640 --> 2:14:44.520]  it's wise to buy a house with a basement and to upgrade that basement to nuclear fallout shelter
[2:14:44.520 --> 2:14:51.880]  specifications and it's not that difficult to do all it takes is mass and a air pump and filtration
[2:14:51.880 --> 2:15:01.320]  system it's not that difficult you know people need to be prepared to to shelter in place for
[2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:08.520]  anywhere from three weeks to as much as six months and for any preppers who read blogs like mine
[2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:17.640]  they already have the food storage situation squared away hopefully they also have access to
[2:15:17.640 --> 2:15:23.560]  well water or spring water that they can pump manually any decent prepper will have already
[2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:29.160]  long since done that and then it's just a matter of of creating a fallout shelter and having the
[2:15:29.160 --> 2:15:35.640]  correct monitoring equipment you'll need a dosimeter and a rate meter and a charger so that you can
[2:15:35.640 --> 2:15:45.320]  zero those two instruments and of course you'll anyone who's under 50 years old should also have
[2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:54.200]  access to either potassium iodide or potassium iodate tablets so that that's what will protect
[2:15:54.200 --> 2:15:59.560]  your thyroid gland in the event of a nuclear attack because the thyroid gland naturally
[2:16:00.120 --> 2:16:07.320]  accumulates a radioactive isotopes and what potassium iodide or potassium iodate will do
[2:16:07.320 --> 2:16:14.680]  is flush your thyroid gland to prevent thyroid damage but there was a recent study done by
[2:16:14.680 --> 2:16:24.120]  Oak Ridge National Laboratory that showed that it's using that prophylactically is only advisable
[2:16:24.120 --> 2:16:33.560]  for people under the age of 50 over 50 the risks outweigh the benefits of using potassium iodide
[2:16:35.240 --> 2:16:39.560]  now I mean sticking with North Korea and the whole nuclear tensions that building up I had a
[2:16:39.560 --> 2:16:44.760]  guest on on Monday who's actually French but he lives in Seoul South Korea and he was saying that
[2:16:44.760 --> 2:16:49.480]  at this point people living in Seoul basically roll their eyes they're quite nonchalant about
[2:16:49.480 --> 2:16:54.520]  all these threats they've been hearing them for probably over two decades now the imminent threat
[2:16:54.520 --> 2:16:59.240]  of nuclear attack that they've basically become quite blasé about it you know they've they've
[2:16:59.240 --> 2:17:06.040]  got normalcy bias but given the tensions you know we have Trump meeting today with a hundred senators
[2:17:06.040 --> 2:17:10.520]  on the issue of North Korea there's suggestions he's going to try and get authorization
[2:17:10.520 --> 2:17:15.960]  for a military attack I mean how alarmed should we be it seems people in South Korea at least
[2:17:15.960 --> 2:17:20.840]  have got this kind of normalcy bias whereby it hasn't happened before so it's never going to happen
[2:17:20.840 --> 2:17:28.360]  in the future well it's sad to see that they're getting blasé about it because the the nuclear
[2:17:28.360 --> 2:17:35.160]  threat from North Korea really didn't exist until about 17 18 years ago but now that it does exist
[2:17:36.200 --> 2:17:44.760]  it is prudent it is wise to prepare obviously governments are wholly incapable of providing
[2:17:45.640 --> 2:17:52.440]  any kind of adequate civil defense for the civilian populace it's just it's just not going to happen
[2:17:52.440 --> 2:18:00.200]  we had a civil defense program here in the United States but it's essentially more abundant hasn't
[2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:05.400]  really been funded since the 1970s there's still some designated fallout shelters but they really
[2:18:05.400 --> 2:18:12.520]  aren't viable it really comes down to family preparedness and for anyone here in the United
[2:18:12.520 --> 2:18:20.680]  States or for anyone in Japan or anyone in South Korea I think it is wise to go ahead and make
[2:18:20.680 --> 2:18:30.680]  preparations it's not that expensive and although they the actual threat may be fairly low in any
[2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:38.360]  given year it's enough of a threat that it's wise to go ahead and prepare there definitely is
[2:18:38.360 --> 2:18:47.560]  normalcy bias out there yeah it will definitely see some some panic reactions if if there's actual
[2:18:47.560 --> 2:18:52.520]  mobilization on the part of North Korea and at that point anyone who thinks that they'll be able
[2:18:52.520 --> 2:19:01.960]  to order themselves a a dosimeter a rate meter a dosimeter charger or potassium iodate they'll
[2:19:01.960 --> 2:19:06.760]  be they'll be kidding and I don't be fooling themselves because all of those supplies will
[2:19:06.760 --> 2:19:14.920]  be completely gone overnight and I have a friend who's who runs a preparedness company he's one
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:20.520]  of my advertisers on my blog he runs a company called ready-made resources and he's fond of saying
[2:19:20.520 --> 2:19:27.000]  panic now and avoid the rush exactly that's what most people don't understand I mean a lot of
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:31.160]  Alice has obviously got the storeable food but that's only part of it I'm going to ask you after
[2:19:31.160 --> 2:19:35.400]  the break actually we're coming up on about 30 second break here what actually happened to the
[2:19:35.400 --> 2:19:40.520]  prepper market obviously we had this supposed crash after Donald Trump won but now it's picking back
[2:19:40.520 --> 2:19:45.720]  up again obviously accelerated under Obama so I'm going to ask you about that we will be back
[2:19:45.720 --> 2:19:51.080]  in the next segment with James Wesley rules this is the Alex Jones show live Mike Cernovich also
[2:19:51.080 --> 2:19:56.040]  coming up at the bottom of the hour breaking news at info wars dot com we'll be right back
[2:20:01.480 --> 2:20:06.040]  hiring is the most challenging part of my job it's really hard the searching the sorting through
[2:20:06.040 --> 2:20:11.640]  resumes most people don't have the right experience we started using zip recruiter about three months
[2:20:11.640 --> 2:20:16.360]  ago right from the start you could tell it was going to make hiring a lot easier one click and
[2:20:16.360 --> 2:20:21.800]  my job was posted to a hundred plus job boards all the top sites all the candidates came to my
[2:20:21.800 --> 2:20:26.840]  dashboard and it's easy to compare them thumbs up if I like them thumbs down if I didn't no emails

[2:26:20.360 --> 2:26:25.880]  support by getting the products at info wars store dot com now james wesley rolls i was just
[2:26:25.880 --> 2:26:30.680]  mentioning it there before the break you know we had this huge surge in the the prepper market
[2:26:30.680 --> 2:26:36.760]  when barack obama was in office people said that would stagnate once trump got in it i think it did
[2:26:36.760 --> 2:26:42.760]  for a short time but still we have the elite buying their panic rooms buying their land in
[2:26:42.760 --> 2:26:48.760]  remote locations like new zealand what's the state of the market right now at both ends at the elite
[2:26:48.760 --> 2:26:57.400]  end and at the the prepper end well at the elite and it's definitely a frantic market right now
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:02.280]  because people who never had any interest at all in preparedness are playing catch up
[2:27:03.640 --> 2:27:12.760]  at the middle class prepper level there was definitely a a drop off that took place
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:19.000]  immediately following the election and it has bounced back the only part of the market that's
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:26.760]  still fairly slow is in firearms and ammunition purchases which are still fairly slow simply
[2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:35.160]  because there was a huge anticipation that uh clinton would be elected and that there would be
[2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:42.120]  additional gun restrictions so people overbought before the election and now we're kind of in the
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:49.160]  in the rebound but i think even that will come back probably after this summer it's interesting
[2:27:49.160 --> 2:27:54.760]  isn't it i mean if we continue to hear stories about panic rooms about them buying land in new
[2:27:54.760 --> 2:28:00.680]  zealand people buying entire reserves they're preparing so why shouldn't the people prepare
[2:28:00.680 --> 2:28:04.360]  uh james we've got about a minute left just tell us about survivalblog.com

[2:35:42.280 --> 2:35:49.480]  saudi arabia to obtain arms nuclear technology in mcmaster orchestrated deal saudi arabia will
[2:35:49.480 --> 2:35:55.320]  obtain a massive weapons arsenal and missile defense system in a deal perceived by hr mcmaster
[2:35:55.320 --> 2:36:00.760]  gary cone and dina powell under this deal which is set to be announced in may saudi arabia will
[2:36:00.760 --> 2:36:08.200]  obtain technology to build civilian nuclear reactors president trump has expressed skepticism of this
[2:36:08.200 --> 2:36:16.440]  deal despite continued pressure from mcmaster cone and powell mike i mean saudi arabia this is a
[2:36:16.440 --> 2:36:23.160]  country that had involvement in 9 11 trump himself slammed saudi arabia for engaging in a brutal
[2:36:23.160 --> 2:36:30.040]  war against yemen why is the trump administration now moving closer to saudi arabia with this deal
[2:36:30.920 --> 2:36:34.760]  well if you scroll in an article you can see a picture that is quite revealing
[2:36:35.480 --> 2:36:42.760]  you can see dina powell hanging out with the wife of the same saudi prince who told donald trump
[2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:49.960]  that he was at his grace not only to the g.o.p but to all americans so there you can see dina's
[2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:58.520]  with umma she's with the saudi princess ariana huffington it really says it all and it went
[2:36:58.520 --> 2:37:05.800]  once k.t farland is out once k.t mcfrawn is out dina powell is actually one of two people who
[2:37:05.800 --> 2:37:11.240]  is going to be second in command at the national security council she's working her way up so she
[2:37:11.240 --> 2:37:16.920]  and globalist gary who both worked at golden sacks and as you know the saudi's give a lot of money
[2:37:16.920 --> 2:37:22.360]  to golden sacks golden sacks will make a lot of money out of this deal brokering this deal
[2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:26.520]  that's ultimately what this is about it is out of the coup that we talked about before
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:32.920]  where mcmaster has been bringing in golden sacks people bringing in deep state people bringing in
[2:37:32.920 --> 2:37:39.320]  never trump people to take over the nsc they worked hard to push out bannon remember bannon was on
[2:37:39.320 --> 2:37:44.600]  the nsc board for a while and they they wanted to get him shuffled away and i actually have another
[2:37:44.600 --> 2:37:49.320]  story too about what mcmaster wants to do and this is a story i haven't even had time right up
[2:37:49.320 --> 2:37:54.200]  because i'm just evolving it so we can talk about the saudi arabia thing and then i can break a brand
[2:37:54.200 --> 2:37:59.800]  new story that is in my note form because i haven't even had time to write it up yet go ahead let's
[2:37:59.800 --> 2:38:05.480]  break that new story right now tell us about it all right so mcmaster has another plan so as you
[2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:12.600]  know mcmaster wanted to do 150 000 ground troops in syria i reported that people go oh that's fake
[2:38:12.600 --> 2:38:18.760]  and then bloomberg reports that they go oh well sternovich was wrong he mcmaster only wants 50 000
[2:38:18.760 --> 2:38:24.760]  you know as if that changes anything and as if you know 50 150 once you have boots on the ground
[2:38:24.760 --> 2:38:30.360]  in that number now you're just fighting at the margins so mcmaster was rebuffed by that because
[2:38:30.360 --> 2:38:35.960]  trumps people were furious about that and that's why a lot of the media team actually really hates me
[2:38:35.960 --> 2:38:40.840]  because i'm breaking this kind of news and i'm disrupting globalist gary dino poll and all those
[2:38:40.840 --> 2:38:47.400]  people and remember too the head of trumps media team is actually a never trumper so it really is
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:55.400]  mind blowing so mcmaster presented a 35 billion dollar plan for afghanistan at a principles meeting
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:39:00.920]  which was with the whole national security council minus the president was there mcmaster
[2:39:00.920 --> 2:39:06.920]  wants to spend 35 billion dollars in afghanistan and he faced a lot of resistance pushback
[2:39:06.920 --> 2:39:14.920]  for various officials there mcmaster said i quote we will create an inclusive government
[2:39:15.480 --> 2:39:21.160]  the strategy has not been presented to the president because even the people at the principles
[2:39:21.160 --> 2:39:25.400]  meeting think that master is out of his mind they're saying what are you talking about you want to do
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:30.920]  35 billion in afghanistan what is that going to look like are we talking troop surges another surge
[2:39:30.920 --> 2:39:36.440]  now remember mcmaster was a protégé david patrice and patrice is indeed pulling at the
[2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:43.400]  strings of mcmaster and patrice was a big proponent of the surge so mcmaster is now going to present
[2:39:43.400 --> 2:39:50.920]  another massive 35 billion dollar plan to donald trump to create a new regime in afghanistan
[2:39:51.560 --> 2:39:55.800]  now where's bannon in all this because of course we know there were reports that he had
[2:39:55.800 --> 2:40:00.680]  spoke out against the serious strike there were separate reports that he had kind of faded off into
[2:40:00.680 --> 2:40:05.400]  the background at one point it looked like he was hanging on by a thread where where's his voice
[2:40:05.400 --> 2:40:10.600]  in all this why isn't bannon being more vocal in telling trump what a sheer disaster this is going
[2:40:10.600 --> 2:40:17.160]  to be given the history of interventions in the region well the media played a great psychological
[2:40:17.160 --> 2:40:21.640]  operation on trump and i actually had warned people about him because i knew it would work
[2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:27.720]  what happened with bannon is the media created a narrative which claimed that bannon was violating
[2:40:27.720 --> 2:40:32.200]  one of the 48 laws of power which is never outshine the master the media made it look like
[2:40:32.200 --> 2:40:38.120]  bannon was actually controlling trump that rattles trump ego because he's thinking how dare
[2:40:38.120 --> 2:40:45.160]  anybody say that that's my strategist bannon was actually going to be out um like as of 10 days ago
[2:40:45.160 --> 2:40:55.080]  bannon was gone but he actually had to completely lay low and realizes that if he is too vocal then
[2:40:55.080 --> 2:40:59.400]  trump is going to have him out because what you don't see in the media which i find interesting
[2:40:59.400 --> 2:41:05.160]  is where the article is saying that gary cohen is manipulating controlling trump
[2:41:05.160 --> 2:41:10.440]  even though gary cohen is the one presenting his tax plans so what the media is doing is
[2:41:10.440 --> 2:41:16.280]  they are trying to attack trump and attack his ego by saying look bannon really controls trump
[2:41:16.280 --> 2:41:21.240]  that's how they create drama that's how they create strife but the media is not saying anything about
[2:41:21.240 --> 2:41:28.120]  McMaster or dina paul or gary cohen even those are actually the real puppet masters because
[2:41:28.120 --> 2:41:33.880]  a lot of people are saying now that trump doesn't want to go on this trip to saudi arabia trump
[2:41:33.880 --> 2:41:39.400]  was actually not sold on it but he's getting a massive amount of pressure from dina paul
[2:41:40.040 --> 2:41:45.000]  McMaster and from cohen so they're the people who have more or less taken over the national
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:50.520]  security council and now the nsc is essentially becoming a puppet of patreus and a puppet of
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:55.720]  golden sacks in saudi arabia and as he said the media isn't going to kick up a fuss about the
[2:41:55.720 --> 2:42:00.760]  fact that you know as i talked about months ago literally half of the national security council
[2:42:00.760 --> 2:42:05.400]  a council on foreign relations members this was months ago and you would expect some of them to
[2:42:05.400 --> 2:42:10.120]  be but you know that swamp was filled pretty quickly i want to get your take on this as well
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:15.160]  mike because it ties into all this evanke trump and let's let's get that clip ready again evanke
[2:42:15.160 --> 2:42:20.840]  trump saying that allowing syrian refugees into the u.s needs to be part of the discussion let's
[2:42:20.840 --> 2:42:27.640]  roll the clip in germany her father's far from popular the president's controversial travel ban
[2:42:27.640 --> 2:42:34.360]  a stark contrast to germany opening its doors to syrian refugees evanke trump now going further
[2:42:34.360 --> 2:42:42.440]  than her father on whether those refugees should be led into the u.s i think there is a global
[2:42:42.440 --> 2:42:49.160]  humanitarian crisis that's happening and we have to come together and we have to solve it and and
[2:42:49.160 --> 2:42:53.560]  you know we have to be opening the borders to syrian refugees in the u that has to be part of
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:42:58.040]  the discussion but that's not going to be enough in another cell now mike she's hanging out with
[2:42:58.040 --> 2:43:03.000]  angela merkel the pioneer of the disastrous migrant policy in germany she's hanging out with
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:07.320]  christine legard you know another globalist she's writing op-eds in the financial times with the
[2:43:07.320 --> 2:43:13.480]  president of the world bank at best she's a naive misinformed bleeding heart liberal at worst she's
[2:43:13.480 --> 2:43:18.520]  an actual globalist how concerned should we be that she's become this prominent within the trump
[2:43:18.520 --> 2:43:25.320]  administration given what we just heard paul this is 40 chests and if you don't understand that this
[2:43:25.320 --> 2:43:30.600]  is really just 40 chests then you just don't understand what is really going on this is all
[2:43:30.600 --> 2:43:36.200]  part of the grand master plan and anybody who can't understand that this is actually good
[2:43:36.200 --> 2:43:41.240]  this actually means we won't have terrorists coming in because something something something
[2:43:41.240 --> 2:43:47.480]  40 chests something something something so at this point they're running out of excuses we've
[2:43:47.480 --> 2:43:54.840]  got the very people expressing the policies americans voted against now pushing those policies they're
[2:43:54.840 --> 2:43:59.400]  the people closest to trump it's the elephant in the room that's why we're concerned about it but
[2:43:59.400 --> 2:44:03.880]  we you know we've still got the proviso at least hillary clinton's not in there trump is still
[2:44:03.880 --> 2:44:09.560]  impressionable he listens to a lot of people do we still have a chance to reach him and to try and
[2:44:09.560 --> 2:44:15.800]  drown out these globalist voices sure and that's the point i'm getting really tired of the morons
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:20.120]  i don't mind the people who call me like a nazi every day and lie about me i'm so used to that
[2:44:20.120 --> 2:44:25.640]  i'm tired of the morons who anytime we offer a critique or explain something they go you're
[2:44:25.640 --> 2:44:30.680]  anti-trump now you must hate trump those people are so stupid i don't know how they ever found
[2:44:30.680 --> 2:44:35.960]  me i want them to unfollow me i don't want them watching anything because no that is exactly not
[2:44:35.960 --> 2:44:42.600]  the point as i've said hillary in office would be so much fundamentally worse than the little
[2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:48.040]  squabbles we're having now the big picture is hillary isn't in i'm happy as you can see in
[2:44:48.040 --> 2:44:54.200]  that fan artwork you're on that alex jones is in there there's alex roger stone you're up there
[2:44:54.200 --> 2:45:00.200]  you know great people there's no question that it's a great thing that trump won there's also
[2:45:00.200 --> 2:45:05.800]  no question that you don't just vote for the guy he goes in office and then you quit talking about
[2:45:05.800 --> 2:45:13.400]  issues that mattered to you i find it astounding that gary cone dino paul and hr mcmaster they're
[2:45:13.400 --> 2:45:18.360]  every day trying to get trump's ear they're trying to influence them they're trying to persuade him
[2:45:18.360 --> 2:45:25.560]  but the minute pjw paul the great mike sternovich roger stone stefan mollin you alex jones the minute
[2:45:25.560 --> 2:45:31.800]  any of us try to influence trump suddenly we're the bad guys suddenly we're not supposed to talk
[2:45:31.800 --> 2:45:37.400]  i think though judging by the twitter reaction to this avonka trump thing which was i mean they
[2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:43.400]  absolutely decimated her the argument is beginning to shift over to our side significantly especially
[2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:47.960]  with her maybe not with trump directly yet but you know we'll we'll continue to try to have an
[2:45:47.960 --> 2:45:53.160]  influence and maintain actual consistent principles rather than being sycophants i want to move on
[2:45:53.160 --> 2:45:57.400]  to a bit of breaking news and get your take on it mike then you can flash this up this is out of
[2:45:57.400 --> 2:46:03.240]  reuters ankelter cancels her speech at uc berkeley conservative commentator ankelter's cancelled
[2:46:03.240 --> 2:46:08.280]  her speech plan for this week at uc berkeley after his dispute with university officials who
[2:46:08.280 --> 2:46:13.400]  feared violent protests over whether a safe venue could be found there will be no speech he wrote
[2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:19.000]  an email to reuters on wednesday that was basically after the police came out and said we're gonna
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:25.400]  stand down again and not arrest violent rioters we're going to allow them to commit crimes mike
[2:46:25.400 --> 2:46:31.720]  how ironic is it that you know uc berkeley the birthplace of the free speech movement
[2:46:31.720 --> 2:46:37.400]  is now apparently the place where free speech has gone to die yet and i don't know if the
[2:46:37.400 --> 2:46:43.240]  producers can get to my twitter but i posted the tax return to the young america's foundation
[2:46:43.240 --> 2:46:51.800]  which was supposed to sponsor this speech they are making in revenue 35 million not a typo
[2:46:51.800 --> 2:46:57.640]  35 million dollars a year in contributions they have net assets of 65 million dollars i tweeted
[2:46:57.640 --> 2:47:03.400]  that out earlier i went through the tax returns of young america's foundation 35 million dollars a
[2:47:03.400 --> 2:47:09.880]  year and they can't hire some blackwater people this just shows how factless and ineffective
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:16.120]  and what a waste of money and i will say an outright fraud and scam the so-called conservative
[2:47:16.120 --> 2:47:21.560]  non-profits are could you imagine if you were i had 35 million dollars a year coming in what we
[2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:26.360]  could do with that they have 35 million dollars and they say oh we can't do the encolter speech
[2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:31.160]  just can't do it we have oh we have 65 million dollars cash money in the bank account but we
[2:47:31.160 --> 2:47:36.920]  can't hire some blackwater people we can't do any kind of security thing i'm i'm so done with
[2:47:36.920 --> 2:47:42.280]  traditional conservatives there you know the way i put it on twitter today is to the left of the
[2:47:42.280 --> 2:47:48.200]  left of me i have an antifa people who want to kill me i have factless conservatives who despite
[2:47:48.200 --> 2:47:53.960]  making 35 million dollars a year can't figure out hey we can figure out a way to have this speech
[2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:59.080]  and then to the right of me i have idiots doing Nazi salutes and all that stuff and it's just time
[2:47:59.080 --> 2:48:05.880]  to to find out where actual the critical thinkers are this big metal and focus on them and the young
[2:48:05.880 --> 2:48:11.000]  america's foundation again it just shows why conservatives lose you have all that money you
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:16.360]  have 65 million dollars in the bank account and you're not going to take a stand for free speech
[2:48:16.360 --> 2:48:21.960]  make the speech happen i'm i'm done i'm done with all these people and i mean the word cooked is
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:26.760]  kind of overused but that's definitely what happened the the yaf cooked out the headlines
[2:48:26.760 --> 2:48:31.640]  out of gateway pundit young american foundation pulls support from coulter event due to berkeley
[2:48:31.640 --> 2:48:35.800]  police stand down we knew the police were going to stand down anyway that's what they do every
[2:48:35.800 --> 2:48:40.760]  single time so of course you have to hire your own security they said they wouldn't they pulled out
[2:48:40.760 --> 2:48:45.960]  immediately that is the ultimate cook move and you're rightly critical of them we got a couple
[2:48:45.960 --> 2:48:50.440]  of minutes left i want to move on that and call to speeches not happening by the looks of it i'm
[2:48:50.440 --> 2:48:56.360]  sure that will continue though christian bail came out in an article mike of course he risks his
[2:48:56.360 --> 2:49:02.600]  hollywood career by calling trump a dictator how edgy how brave but he also said had something to
[2:49:02.600 --> 2:49:09.240]  say about you correct yeah so i got a good kick out of that i wake up in the morning and christian
[2:49:09.240 --> 2:49:13.400]  bail apparently went for an interview where he should be talking about the armenian genocide
[2:49:13.400 --> 2:49:18.040]  an issue is an issue near and dear to my heart i have many armenian friends as a strong armenian
[2:49:18.040 --> 2:49:22.440]  community in l.a so christian bail there's finally going to be a movie in hollywood of
[2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:28.840]  their meaning genocide and how the young turks and people like sinca people like him you know he's
[2:49:28.840 --> 2:49:34.840]  his youtube channel is named after a genocidal hate group the young turks actually is the equivalent
[2:49:34.840 --> 2:49:40.840]  of the nazi ss organization and somehow he's mainstream you know we're the bad guys so finally
[2:49:40.840 --> 2:49:46.120]  there's going to be a story finally a big blackbuster hollywood will be doing it christian bail goes
[2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:51.320]  into an interview with some no-name blogger at the daily beast which is a hundred million dollars in
[2:49:51.320 --> 2:49:58.840]  debt and says that he's obsessed with me he's just can't stop thinking about me they mentioned
[2:49:58.840 --> 2:50:03.560]  breitbart you know the guy mentioned breitbart then bail goes who's that guy who talked about
[2:50:03.560 --> 2:50:09.560]  that pizza parlor something bitch then they go mike sternovich goes oh so i have multiple there's
[2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:14.920]  multiple layers to look at the big picture is that these hollywood people have lost their mind and if
[2:50:14.920 --> 2:50:20.520]  you google his name all he's talking about is trump alex jones and sternovich i don't even know what
[2:50:20.520 --> 2:50:25.000]  the guy's name is the movie's called because instead of promoting this movie this is their
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:29.560]  derangement syndrome their trump derangement syndrome their pewton derangement syndrome their
[2:50:29.560 --> 2:50:34.120]  alex jones their mike sternovich derangement syndrome where instead of focusing on this movie
[2:50:34.120 --> 2:50:39.960]  that costs a hundred million dollars to make he's trying to throw shade on me but this is why i tell
[2:50:39.960 --> 2:50:45.720]  the info warriors that this is why every time i'm on this show i might you guys matter this is the
[2:50:45.720 --> 2:50:51.160]  impact alex jones is making a difference everybody here who's sharing links to info wars dot com and
[2:50:51.160 --> 2:50:57.320]  fighting back a list hollywood actors cannot stop thinking about us all right mike hold that thought
[2:50:57.320 --> 2:51:02.040]  we'll be back in the next segment mike sternovich coming up county folks colonel sanders here to
[2:51:02.040 --> 2:51:06.600]  announce that kfc's new spicy crispy zinger chicken sandwich is now available in a five
[2:51:06.600 --> 2:51:11.480]  dollar fill up for limited time why because who wants to spend seven dollars on a meal at a burger

[2:51:16.200 --> 2:51:22.360]  at a drink at kfc i mean we specialize in chicken you need another reason i didn't think so try the

[3:01:31.960 --> 3:01:37.800]  used to it at this point but could they have normalcy bias we have trump meeting today with 100
[3:01:37.800 --> 3:01:45.000]  senators reuters calls calls it unusual in a meeting in which he could start to pitch start
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:52.200]  to canvass support for senatorial for congressional authorization for war on north korea could that
[3:01:52.200 --> 3:01:57.800]  happen and if so how soon another report here twitter goes wild over reported death penalty
[3:01:57.800 --> 3:02:03.480]  for atheism in saudi arabia so a bunch of people on twitter are celebrating the fact that a man

[3:02:35.560 --> 3:02:40.520]  arabia the women being whipped when they try to leave the classrooms to go to their male guardian
[3:02:40.520 --> 3:02:46.680]  to drive them home they can't even appear in public that's the belief system that we're importing
[3:02:46.680 --> 3:02:51.000]  into the west right now and it only seems to be getting worse in terms of radicalization
[3:02:51.640 --> 3:02:57.880]  it's not moderating there's no reformation of islam it only seems to be sliding towards the
[3:02:57.880 --> 3:03:04.920]  worse extreme we mentioned this story earlier out of shtf plan why we have a second amendment
[3:03:04.920 --> 3:03:10.600]  venezuela plans to give firearms to loyalists so they can purge growing resistance so you had

[3:03:22.360 --> 3:03:30.440]  have had enough they had the protests now the dictator maduro is arming his loyalists 400 000
[3:03:30.440 --> 3:03:38.760]  of them with firearms a gun for every militiaman he cried the problem with that is that venezuela
[3:03:38.760 --> 3:03:45.720]  disarmed everybody else back in 2012 so all those people who are out on the streets protesting
[3:03:45.720 --> 3:03:51.800]  against this communist dictatorship basically at this point are now under severe threat and

[3:08:34.520 --> 3:08:41.640]  big breaking news out of washington an internal struggle inside the trump whitehouse
[3:08:41.640 --> 3:08:47.960]  uh between those who favored a complete analysis uh pardon me a complete emphasis
[3:08:48.600 --> 3:08:56.840]  on uh the obama care repeal and those who thought that dylan trump's dynamic pro-growth plan
[3:08:57.560 --> 3:09:05.880]  for a tax reform should lead the way uh i can report exclusively here at info wars
[3:09:05.880 --> 3:09:13.240]  that the president had a what i thought was a compelling and perhaps even a determinative
[3:09:13.240 --> 3:09:21.400]  telephone call with uh the supply side economist uh and growth advocate larry kudlow last week
[3:09:22.120 --> 3:09:30.440]  kudlow who continues to supply analysis for cnbc uh urged the president to unveil
[3:09:30.440 --> 3:09:38.760]  his pro-growth tax reform agenda as soon as possible and the white house has done that
[3:09:38.760 --> 3:09:46.760]  only about an hour and a half ago now here's a shock for inside the beltway washington
[3:09:47.320 --> 3:09:53.240]  donald trump has proposed exactly what he said he would propose in the campaign
[3:09:53.240 --> 3:10:00.920]  that is a sweeping john f kennedy ronald reagan type tax cut for all americans
[3:10:00.920 --> 3:10:09.560]  because a rising tide lifts all boats but also the the entirely crucial i would say vital
[3:10:09.560 --> 3:10:17.880]  reduction on corporate income taxes the reason china and mexico and japan are taking us to the
[3:10:17.880 --> 3:10:24.280]  cleaners on economic issues and on growth is because all of them have a corporate tax rate
[3:10:24.280 --> 3:10:31.000]  that is substantially lower than the united states one can see why an american corporation
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:36.680]  would choose to do business in those venues because it is immediately more profitable
[3:10:37.240 --> 3:10:45.000]  donald trump uh who has threatened to use tariffs throughout his um late political career i have
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:52.840]  always argued that the tariffs that he mentions are a stick uh and that the corporate tax reduction
[3:10:52.840 --> 3:11:01.400]  would be a far more efficient way uh to bring those american companies back home if the corporate
[3:11:01.400 --> 3:11:09.880]  tax rate in the united states was below that of china mexico japan and others uh it would really
[3:11:09.880 --> 3:11:17.640]  be an inducement for american companies to move back to the united states to expand here to hire
[3:11:17.640 --> 3:11:25.560]  here to build new facilities here and therefore i have always believed that a pro-growth dynamic
[3:11:25.560 --> 3:11:34.280]  economy is the absolute cornerstone of the donald trump reform agenda significant economic growth
[3:11:34.280 --> 3:11:40.920]  would buy the president both political time to address the country's other problems but also
[3:11:40.920 --> 3:11:47.640]  could conceivably give him a bump in revenues now there are some analysts who say that the
[3:11:47.640 --> 3:11:55.720]  president's plan when looked at it in a static analysis will cause billions of dollars in revenue
[3:11:55.720 --> 3:12:03.960]  shortfall but our history under president ronald reagan indicates otherwise in fact every year
[3:12:03.960 --> 3:12:11.960]  reagan was president federal revenues went up as a result of his pro-growth supply side oriented
[3:12:11.960 --> 3:12:18.200]  tax cuts the problem we had in the reagan years indeed the problem we still have today
[3:12:18.200 --> 3:12:26.920]  is a spending problem and spending in reagan's years all eight years outpaced the growth in
[3:12:26.920 --> 3:12:36.040]  revenue generated by his tax cuts we also have a strange sequence of events this week in washington
[3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:48.120]  uh where i'm sure many have seen that the uh the uh cia director mr pompeo um has begun what appears
[3:12:48.120 --> 3:12:56.200]  to be a campaign of vilification and perhaps even a campaign to prosecute wikileaks founder
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:13:04.120]  and journalist julien assange uh let me go through this because it is something we've discussed a lot
[3:13:04.120 --> 3:13:12.840]  here assange is not a russian asset our intelligence assets uh pardon our intelligence agencies
[3:13:12.840 --> 3:13:20.440]  continue to insist that he is but when pressed for proof they say well that is our assessment
[3:13:21.560 --> 3:13:27.560]  listen for that code word folks when the intelligence agencies when the cia or the fbi
[3:13:27.560 --> 3:13:34.120]  tell them it is it is their assessment that means they're guessing or that they're projecting
[3:13:34.760 --> 3:13:41.800]  assange is a journalist and he has done this country a service by exposing massive corruption
[3:13:42.440 --> 3:13:47.560]  we don't know that he has broken the law because we do not know the source of the
[3:13:47.560 --> 3:13:54.840]  documents that he has made public the entire effort to vilify assange as a foreign agent
[3:13:54.840 --> 3:14:02.520]  is an obvious attempt to distract americans from the substance of what wikileaks has made public
[3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:09.880]  and in fact wikileaks proves uh in the uh in the documents that they did publish
[3:14:10.840 --> 3:14:17.880]  that uh hillary clinton herself was deeply involved in campaign dirty tricks something that they
[3:14:17.880 --> 3:14:25.480]  ran ritchard nixon out of office for even though there was never any proof uh that he was uh uh
[3:14:25.480 --> 3:14:33.720]  had knowledge in advance of the of the watergate break in so the the documents is put forward by
[3:14:33.720 --> 3:14:40.360]  wikileaks which by the way i had no advance notice of other than the fact that they had a treasure
[3:14:40.360 --> 3:14:49.000]  trove of documents on clinton that would be released in october uh they proved corruption in some cases
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:56.520]  treason uh they proved the collusion between the mainstream media uh and the clinton campaign to
[3:14:56.520 --> 3:15:03.480]  write the news narrative in a way that benefited hillary that they exposed a massive
[3:15:03.480 --> 3:15:10.600]  uh hypocrisy by the clintons the internals of their efforts to silence the various women
[3:15:11.160 --> 3:15:19.800]  assaulted by bill and then later uh uh threatened bullied and intimidated by hillary clinton
[3:15:20.680 --> 3:15:27.240]  now would be a superb time to also mention the fact that info wars along with other
[3:15:27.240 --> 3:15:34.760]  uh alternative media sites like bright bar daily news stone cold truce dot com stone zone dot com
[3:15:35.320 --> 3:15:44.920]  are under horrendous attack from the tech left that's right folks facebook google amazon and others
[3:15:44.920 --> 3:15:54.280]  are conspiring to limit our reach to you and that's why info wars needs your support now you can
[3:15:54.280 --> 3:16:02.840]  have a win win situation by going to the info wars dot com store uh and ordering a number of the
[3:16:02.840 --> 3:16:10.600]  outstanding products there i recently visited uh austin where i did some live appearances here on
[3:16:10.600 --> 3:16:18.360]  info wars and while there i actually managed to obtain a tube of the non fluoride toothpaste in
[3:16:18.360 --> 3:16:25.560]  this case the peppermint flavor which i found to be superior i gave the bubble gum flavor
[3:16:25.560 --> 3:16:31.240]  to my grandchildren this is the best toothpaste i have ever used first of all it is interesting
[3:16:31.240 --> 3:16:37.720]  that the tube is designed so you use a minimum amount of it stretching the life of your supply
[3:16:38.360 --> 3:16:44.600]  there's no waste but secondarily uh better even than the dental strips you can buy in the drug store
[3:16:44.600 --> 3:16:51.160]  or the whitening process at some dentists this product really works so let me urge you
[3:16:51.160 --> 3:16:57.560]  go to the info wars dot com store and pick up your uh non fluoride toothpaste now available
[3:16:57.560 --> 3:17:03.240]  in two different flavors i strongly strongly recommend it big division in my family some
[3:17:03.240 --> 3:17:14.920]  like the super blue while others are hanging tough for the temperament flavor now we are not only on
[3:17:14.920 --> 3:17:24.120]  the edge of our seats this morning my attorneys receive a call from the house intelligence
[3:17:24.120 --> 3:17:31.640]  committee telling us that they would be sending us a letter shortly we've been watching the facts
[3:17:31.640 --> 3:17:39.960]  folks but uh so far no letter i have expressed some skepticism uh that the house or senate
[3:17:39.960 --> 3:17:47.560]  intelligence committee would have the cahones to call me because i will put the lie to this entire
[3:17:47.560 --> 3:17:54.360]  myth of russian collusion with donald trump's campaign that's right i'm going to take the exact
[3:17:54.360 --> 3:18:01.720]  words of the democrats on both committees and one republican john mccain and demonstrate how they
[3:18:01.720 --> 3:18:09.320]  have been systematically false and how they have included supposition conjecture and coincidence
[3:18:09.320 --> 3:18:18.280]  and tried to call it evidence evidence of crime evidence of a violation of our national security
[3:18:18.280 --> 3:18:25.720]  because of course collusion with the russians we constitute treason now i recognize that some
[3:18:25.720 --> 3:18:33.160]  democrats call me a dirty trickster uh most of them are democrats that i have beaten so i wear it
[3:18:33.160 --> 3:18:41.880]  as a badge but as i have said before there is one trick that is not in my bag treason it's an insult
[3:18:41.880 --> 3:18:48.440]  and it must be addressed thanks for tuning in with us today at info wars please again go to the

[3:24:17.960 --> 3:24:27.560]  welcome back i'm roger stone here at info wars recently called trump's albino assassin by the
[3:24:27.560 --> 3:24:36.280]  comedian bill marr it's now a title i wear as a badge of honor the uh billings in berkeley are
[3:24:36.280 --> 3:24:42.120]  deeply disturbing to anyone who believes in the first amendment or free speech you may recall
[3:24:42.120 --> 3:24:47.560]  that immediately after the election alex jones warned that while the left was stunned they would
[3:24:47.560 --> 3:24:54.600]  soon wake up and they would begin a national spasm after the first few riots alex jones correctly
[3:24:54.600 --> 3:25:00.680]  predicted that things were about to get much worse today i joined alex jones and warning you
[3:25:00.680 --> 3:25:11.720]  you the worst is yet to come universities have become uh a the new site for the war on free
[3:25:11.720 --> 3:25:20.040]  speech how ironic that berkeley where the free speech movement was founded by the leftist radical
[3:25:20.040 --> 3:25:27.640]  mario savio is now the site for this clash the leftist spasm is making its way through the liberal
[3:25:27.640 --> 3:25:33.320]  run of cities as well as universities the universities have become the centers for
[3:25:33.320 --> 3:25:42.360]  indoctrination where communists anarchists virulent socialists and their ilk gather freely to plot to
[3:25:42.360 --> 3:25:49.640]  plan the demise of this great nation they're no longer plotting folks they're now well funded
[3:25:49.640 --> 3:25:57.240]  with insane democrat money and evil wealthy oligarchs like george soros sponsoring through
[3:25:57.240 --> 3:26:02.520]  their dollars these actions in the streets and since their money comes from the deep state and
[3:26:02.520 --> 3:26:09.480]  their corporate supporters and they're following orders from the liberal elite to crush all descent
[3:26:09.480 --> 3:26:17.560]  well then in tifa they are the fascists my good friend and colter uh was courageously
[3:26:17.560 --> 3:26:24.360]  planning to go to berkeley and confront the demonstrators i sent her an email two days ago
[3:26:24.360 --> 3:26:31.000]  fearing for her personal safety and now despite the fact that i dislike retreat in the face
[3:26:31.560 --> 3:26:39.160]  of these bullies these cowards my personal regard for an uh leads me to believe that she has made
[3:26:39.160 --> 3:26:47.240]  the right decision she is too important a voice to be sacrificed to a bunch of punks uh a bunch of
[3:26:47.240 --> 3:26:54.920]  hoodlums who have now incorporated the entire left tactic you see they can't compete with us
[3:26:55.560 --> 3:27:03.160]  in the battleground or i should say the battlefield of ideas they can only silence us
[3:27:03.160 --> 3:27:11.800]  you see it on the tech left attempt to uh to manipulate the algorithms so that fewer of you
[3:27:11.800 --> 3:27:19.560]  will see info wars in your email box on the net yes even the google pardon me even the internet
[3:27:19.560 --> 3:27:28.360]  giants like yahoo are in on this act we at stone cold truth have seen a substantial drop in the
[3:27:28.360 --> 3:27:38.120]  opens of our outgoing uh sign up white list uh a list of followers uh it is not just the internet
[3:27:38.120 --> 3:27:44.600]  where we are being harassed or i should say not just the net based sites but it is also
[3:27:44.600 --> 3:27:52.760]  the function of our email where will this go my idea is simply this that the folks at bright
[3:27:52.760 --> 3:28:02.840]  bark at info wars uh at town hall at the daily caller that they uh perhaps led by alex jones
[3:28:02.840 --> 3:28:11.480]  convene a meeting of all of those on the alternative media right to determine whether it is a petition
[3:28:11.480 --> 3:28:18.680]  to the trump antitrust department of the justice department or whether it is a class action lawsuit
[3:28:19.320 --> 3:28:27.400]  we cannot let the left put the toothpaste back in the tube we simply cannot let the mainstream media
[3:28:27.400 --> 3:28:40.440]  abc nbc cbs cnn and fox regain their mainstream media uh uh monopoly on the dissemination of
[3:28:40.440 --> 3:28:47.320]  political information the freedom of this nation the prospect for the midterm elections the prospect
[3:28:47.320 --> 3:28:55.160]  for donald trump's reelection lies in whether or not we continue to have a vibrant robust
[3:28:55.160 --> 3:29:03.080]  alternative media it is ironic that the liberals are now using the tactics of joseph stalin and
[3:29:03.080 --> 3:29:09.800]  adolf hitler and other dictators who know the key to controlling the people is to cut off their flow
[3:29:09.800 --> 3:29:15.960]  of information help us in this vital fight by going to the info wars dot com store get your

[3:29:59.560 --> 3:30:06.840]  north korea continues to threaten the united states this time saying they are ready to
[3:30:06.840 --> 3:30:13.720]  sink the us aircraft carrier carl vinson with a single strike they also claim that their military
[3:30:13.720 --> 3:30:19.720]  has the ability to reach the continental united states and they are now in possession of a massive
[3:30:19.720 --> 3:30:25.560]  hydrogen bomb meanwhile the white house held an emergency meeting over north korea that included
[3:30:25.560 --> 3:30:31.880]  a phone call between president trump and china over the escalating tensions in the region and china
[3:30:31.880 --> 3:30:39.080]  says world war three is inevitable as north korea prepares for yet another nuclear missile test
[3:30:39.080 --> 3:30:45.560]  and donald trump is poised to intervene the nuclear submarine uss michigan has arrived in
[3:30:45.560 --> 3:30:51.320]  the south korean port of besan and we've now learned that the united states is preparing to

[3:33:42.520 --> 3:33:51.880]  recognized the uh power of the issue of bill clinton's systematic abuse through sexual assault
[3:33:51.880 --> 3:33:59.960]  and rape of literally dozens of women last week hillary clinton came out and said that misogyny
[3:33:59.960 --> 3:34:05.800]  was the reason she lost the election well this is the only time hillary clinton and i have agreed
[3:34:05.800 --> 3:34:12.520]  on anything she's absolutely right her husband's misogyny against women is one of the key factors
[3:34:13.320 --> 3:34:19.720]  that allowed dylan trump to get 53 percent of the vote among white women something that no
[3:34:19.720 --> 3:34:27.800]  political pundit or or pollster for the mainstream media saw coming is this uh issue going to be
[3:34:27.800 --> 3:34:35.000]  swept under the table we have a special report that reminds us that bill clinton is a rapist
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:40.280]  let's roll that you're facing the greatest threat not just the existence of info wars
[3:34:40.280 --> 3:34:44.600]  but the free speech in this country you've seen the mainstream news articles admitting google and
[3:34:44.600 --> 3:34:50.520]  others plan to shut down the new right libertarians nationalists not just here but all over europe
[3:34:50.520 --> 3:34:55.880]  and other parts of the world who are standing up to the unelected authoritarian system of globalism
[3:34:55.880 --> 3:35:02.440]  can you do that you can't do that bill clinton's a rapist he's ready to broader it the media
[3:35:02.440 --> 3:35:18.600]  covering up bill clinton is a rapist i don't want everybody to know bill clinton is a rapist
[3:35:18.600 --> 3:35:26.600]  Bill Clinton is the rapist! Bill Clinton is the rapist! Bill Clinton is the rapist! Bill Clinton is the rapist!
[3:35:26.600 --> 3:35:41.600]  Don't be like them, give them a hand, they've had a bad week! They've had a bad week!
[3:35:41.600 --> 3:35:52.600]  Now, moments later, right after this press conference, Donald Trump got up, walked out and went straight to the debate.
[3:35:52.600 --> 3:35:59.600]  And guess who went with him? That's right, right there in the audience were Bill Clinton's rape accusers.
[3:35:59.600 --> 3:36:02.600]  And then, the gloves came off.
[3:36:02.600 --> 3:36:16.600]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, minor words, and his was action, his was what he's done to women, there's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[3:36:16.600 --> 3:36:27.600]  Now, we can put on screen, Mike Cernovich has been around for years, but he's one of the top bloggers now in the world because he has such amazing sources inside the Trump administration and more.
[3:36:27.600 --> 3:36:33.600]  There it is from Fox News, pro-Trump blogger Cernovich getting big scoops mainstream media attention.
[3:36:33.600 --> 3:36:36.600]  And they have to admit, okay, these are big scoops.
[3:36:36.600 --> 3:36:41.600]  She had a seizure and froze up, walking into her mortarcade.
[3:36:41.600 --> 3:36:44.600]  Well, she had pneumonia.
[3:36:44.600 --> 3:36:46.600]  How do you know? Who told you that?
[3:36:46.600 --> 3:36:48.600]  Well, the campaign told us that.
[3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:49.600]  Why would you trust the campaign?
[3:36:49.600 --> 3:36:54.600]  The point is, you didn't talk to anybody who'd ever examined Hillary Clinton.
[3:36:54.600 --> 3:36:58.600]  I don't take anything Hillary Clinton is going to say at all.
[3:36:58.600 --> 3:36:59.600]  It's true.
[3:36:59.600 --> 3:37:01.600]  I'm not going to take her on her word.
[3:37:01.600 --> 3:37:07.600]  The media says we're not going to take Donald Trump on his word, and that's why we are these different universes.
[3:37:07.600 --> 3:37:08.600]  That's right.
[3:37:08.600 --> 3:37:10.600]  And they didn't show it.
[3:37:10.600 --> 3:37:12.600]  She then fully falls down on her face.
[3:37:12.600 --> 3:37:15.600]  She repeated the same lie they've done over and over again.
[3:37:15.600 --> 3:37:17.600]  You can search into it on YouTube.
[3:37:17.600 --> 3:37:22.600]  TV host says Hillary didn't fall down.
[3:37:22.600 --> 3:37:29.600]  And then they show her where she wobbles, and they grab her arm, not her falling on her face and being drug into the vehicle.
[3:37:29.600 --> 3:37:32.600]  Then they say we lied about that.
[3:37:32.600 --> 3:37:39.600]  Now, Sernovich came to Austin to visit with us, and we were doing a broadcast about censorship.
[3:37:39.600 --> 3:37:44.600]  He was sent by his Google insider of five years, and I've seen the intel.
[3:37:44.600 --> 3:37:46.600]  I've seen the text messages.
[3:37:46.600 --> 3:37:49.600]  I've seen the basic identity to document this.
[3:37:49.600 --> 3:38:02.600]  The internal Google order and memorandum that represents absolute total fraud and absolute criminal activity against myself and against the American people in free speech.
[3:38:02.600 --> 3:38:09.600]  It is true racketeering in the very essence and sense of it from our research.
[3:38:09.600 --> 3:38:19.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, they direct their contractors to go vote us down, and then they say, oh, but this is all free, fair and open.
[3:38:19.600 --> 3:38:21.600]  Again, a total fraud on his face.
[3:38:21.600 --> 3:38:28.600]  They then misrepresent what we say and what we do and say that we're not credible playing clips of Ron Paul,
[3:38:28.600 --> 3:38:35.600]  Vladimir Putin, and Assad saying that the Syrian gas attack was probably a false flag.
[3:38:35.600 --> 3:38:39.600]  In our article they list, they say we give no proof.
[3:38:39.600 --> 3:38:48.600]  We list Sky Television and other mainstream news outlets with the interviews.
[3:38:48.600 --> 3:38:55.600]  So understand, we're being delisted and blocked and put into an electronic gulag that Matt Drudge warned about.
[3:38:55.600 --> 3:39:01.600]  They at 60 Minutes are so out of touch, they thought, boy, we got Sernovich now.
[3:39:01.600 --> 3:39:07.600]  We got the alternative media now because Hillary Clinton is clearly healthy because the campaign told us.
[3:39:07.600 --> 3:39:10.600]  In their world, that made us look bad.
[3:39:10.600 --> 3:39:14.600]  It's unbelievable that really is how to touch they are and how clueless they are.
[3:39:14.600 --> 3:39:22.600]  And that is why they want to censor us because they are so ineffective and so out of touch that people can't believe or trust them now,
[3:39:22.600 --> 3:39:26.600]  even in an editing room with all full-time production staff.
[3:39:26.600 --> 3:39:35.600]  All right, that is the great Mike Sernovich.
[3:39:35.600 --> 3:39:37.600]  My hats off to him.
[3:39:37.600 --> 3:39:42.600]  He is doing yeoman service to the country, breaking blockbuster stories like this.
[3:39:42.600 --> 3:39:50.600]  If you go back and look, you will see that Hillary Clinton's campaign issued a formal press release when the questions about her health first surface,
[3:39:50.600 --> 3:39:58.600]  blaming conspiracy theorists Roger Stone and Alex Jones for spreading disinformation.
[3:39:58.600 --> 3:40:00.600]  Why did we know she was sick?
[3:40:00.600 --> 3:40:03.600]  We saw it with her own two eyes.
[3:40:03.600 --> 3:40:04.600]  She had no stamina.
[3:40:04.600 --> 3:40:06.600]  She was constantly falling down.
[3:40:06.600 --> 3:40:10.600]  She needed help getting up one row of stairs.
[3:40:10.600 --> 3:40:16.600]  And she had a physician or probably a nurse's assistant with her at all times.
[3:40:16.600 --> 3:40:22.600]  I also noticed there was always an ambulance standing by at her public events.
[3:40:22.600 --> 3:40:29.600]  So my hats off to Alex Jones and Sernovich for reminding the American people about the lies of the Clintons.
[3:40:29.600 --> 3:40:41.600]  I think it would be an excellent time to point out to you that there's 53% off on the caveman formula at theinfowars.com store.
[3:40:41.600 --> 3:40:56.600]  Now, this formula is a basic building block for nutrition to promote health, strength of bones, clear skin and addresses all in the most fundamental ways,
[3:40:56.600 --> 3:40:59.600]  the respiratory and circulatory systems.
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:01.600]  It boosts the immunity.
[3:41:01.600 --> 3:41:12.600]  This is going back to the absolutely best raw ingredients that scientists have known for years are fundamental to our health.
[3:41:12.600 --> 3:41:25.600]  Alex Jones and his crew spent a lot of time formulating caveman and the special bone broth that is made this product so widely praised by those who have endorsed it.
[3:41:25.600 --> 3:41:28.600]  These are the actual users.
[3:41:28.600 --> 3:41:30.600]  You can look at the testimonials.
[3:41:30.600 --> 3:41:37.600]  So if you want to help the fight for freedom, if you want to crush those who want to crush the First Amendment,
[3:41:37.600 --> 3:41:48.600]  who would snuff out our right to free speech, go to theinfowarsstore.com and get caveman or any of the other fine products there.
[3:41:48.600 --> 3:41:53.600]  You can't buy these kinds of things in the local drugstore, folks.
[3:41:53.600 --> 3:42:05.600]  Sure, there are others who put forward claims, but Alex Jones and the people at Infowars are absolutely stringent about finding the very best ingredients,
[3:42:05.600 --> 3:42:10.600]  testing it thoroughly before they offer it at the Infowars store.
[3:42:10.600 --> 3:42:25.600]  The other thing I wanted to touch on today is the fact that I first became aware of Alex Jones and what was going on at Infowars based on his courageous reporting on the globalist groups such as the Bilderbergs,
[3:42:25.600 --> 3:42:29.600]  the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.
[3:42:29.600 --> 3:42:34.600]  And now they bring us a special report on the Club of Rome.
[3:42:34.600 --> 3:42:40.600]  This is among the most dangerous globalist cabals out there today.
[3:42:40.600 --> 3:42:42.600]  Let's roll it.
[3:42:42.600 --> 3:42:48.600]  The Club of Rome in the 1960s was a powerful consortium of international elites.
[3:42:48.600 --> 3:43:00.600]  Much of their private corporate meetings was declassified in the late 1990s in a congressional data dump because they've been interfacing with the Energy Department and different Senate and House committees.
[3:43:00.600 --> 3:43:08.600]  I exposed this in my film, Endgame, that's Endgame, Blueprint for Global and Slate, and it's free online if you'd like to go watch it.
[3:43:08.600 --> 3:43:10.600]  It's about two and a half hours long.
[3:43:10.600 --> 3:43:24.600]  The first link goes to an article that came out in November of this year, just a month ago, at the World Economic Forum that is basically the mouthpiece of the private Bilderberg group and secretive Club of Rome.
[3:43:24.600 --> 3:43:31.600]  The very same members attend this and they want a $100 trillion global tax every decade that's paid out every year.
[3:43:31.600 --> 3:43:34.600]  They want the state running your family.
[3:43:34.600 --> 3:43:44.600]  They admit it all and the exhibits in the article, in Snyder's article, are again the establishment themselves in this article alone.
[3:43:44.600 --> 3:43:51.600]  From the perspective of a woman, she basically admits she has Stockholm syndrome but says it's good.
[3:43:51.600 --> 3:43:58.600]  She's given up her free will, everything she does is surveilled, AI computers read her mind in 2030.
[3:43:58.600 --> 3:44:10.600]  The robot shop for her food, she eats what she's told, she goes where she's told, she lives in a compact city, 200 square foot coffin apartment and it's so liberating and it's so good for the earth.
[3:44:10.600 --> 3:44:27.600]  There are bad people that live out in collapsing old houses and hide from the government outside the new centralized mega cities that I warned you about in in-game and she just doesn't like them because they're bad, they didn't trust the government, they were racist and had to be dealt with
[3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:38.600]  and she knows the AI computers, read her mind and track everything she does but the world's a better place and she submits to it and gives into it and just hopes they never use it against her.
[3:44:38.600 --> 3:44:48.600]  The Club of Rome financed by the UN and others said, we want to promote that humans are bad and have a system of tax energy worldwide to fund a corporate world government.
[3:44:48.600 --> 3:44:59.600]  We also want to be able to stifle certain countries, corporations and individuals from developing and using what we call disruptive technologies.
[3:44:59.600 --> 3:45:13.600]  Zero point energy and things like that that they knew were theoretically possible even in the 1960s and of course we're discovered in the 80s and the media discredited all that and the 90s has been now proven everywhere but you never hear about it.
[3:45:13.600 --> 3:45:28.600]  In the near future, earth is dominated by a powerful world government. Once free nations are slaves to the will of a tiny elite, the dawn of a new dark age is upon mankind.
[3:45:28.600 --> 3:45:44.600]  But folks thought that it was like a science fiction dystopia film even though it was real quotes and real video of world leaders in the last 80 years calling for an authoritarian science based global dictatorship.
[3:45:44.600 --> 3:45:58.600]  Fast forward to late 2016 and much of what we put in the film and predicted as near future developments has already happened and the rest of it is now being publicly announced.
[3:45:58.600 --> 3:46:15.600]  A lot of people ask me, Alex, how did you know all of this? Are you psychic? And I explain to them again, have you watched the film? It's video clips, it's film clips, it's newsreels. Going back to the 20s and 30s where they were admitting all of this.
[3:46:15.600 --> 3:46:29.600]  Pre-Hitler eugenics and this new science based control of human procreation, compact cities, you name it, was accepted by the public because they believed anything scientific must be good.
[3:46:29.600 --> 3:46:38.600]  But there are hundreds of different types of advanced technologies that have been developed on energy, communications, you name it, they get shelved. That's incontrovertible, that's admitted.
[3:46:38.600 --> 3:46:45.600]  Here's the headline, welcome to 2030, I own nothing, have no privacy and life has never been better.
[3:46:45.600 --> 3:46:54.600]  And see, for someone awake, you're like, this is insulting or this is written from the perspective of someone saying this is bad. No, they're pushing this officially.
[3:46:54.600 --> 3:47:03.600]  Taxes by the mile, not being able to have a car, only getting meat once a year, the government telling you by high school what you're going to be when you grow up. Total centralization.
[3:47:03.600 --> 3:47:11.600]  I'm V, I'm looking forward to showing you around Plandopolis today. Are you ready to go? Have you got your calorie card open on your smartphone?
[3:47:11.600 --> 3:47:20.600]  I registered your visit with Slick Travel Corp the other day, so they've allotted you a journey time to match mine. It makes so much sense, doesn't it?
[3:47:20.600 --> 3:47:38.600]  Thank you very much to the folks at InfoWars for that terrific special report. The entire international community has all eyes on the nation of France.
[3:47:38.600 --> 3:47:51.600]  The French, as you may remember, were a key ally of the colonists in the American Revolution. And now savvy folks know that the once great France is in deep, deep trouble.
[3:47:51.600 --> 3:48:10.600]  Paris, once the most vibrant and lively city, a center of the arts has already fallen to the Islamic hordes of young men who rape and pillage and destroy public property in what can only be called a rampage.
[3:48:10.600 --> 3:48:26.600]  Just as Donald Trump was the last best choice to save this country, it is my personal view that Marie Le Pen, who is not her father, is the last best chance for the French people.
[3:48:26.600 --> 3:48:43.600]  The situation is very analogous to what we saw here in the United States. The pollsters and the pundits, the same who told us that Trump cannot win, who told us that the Brexit vote would fail, well now they're telling us that Le Pen cannot win.
[3:48:43.600 --> 3:48:57.600]  It's very easy to see why the liberal press would go all in for a manual Macron. He could be very well be a Rothschild puppet, having the potential to have been groomed for this job from an early age.
[3:48:57.600 --> 3:49:23.600]  He has a wife who is a well-known liberal, almost 25 years his senior, who began to woo him when he was a child and she was 40. He has also certainly groomed during the stint as a Rothschild banker where he worked and he went from updating financial spreadsheets in a junior capacity to being a full partner almost overnight.
[3:49:23.600 --> 3:49:41.600]  As a cap to this overwhelming success for someone so young, Macron was invited to attend the annual Bilderberger meeting in 2014. This is fairly conclusive when you're trying to figure out where his real loyalties lie.
[3:49:41.600 --> 3:50:02.600]  One more time, folks, you can aid the fight for liberty and the fact that the tech left, Google, Facebook, Amazon, they are seeking to throttle Infowars.com. They are seeking to shut us down, to silence us and to stifle the voice of freedom.
[3:50:02.600 --> 3:50:19.600]  The single best way you can help us, other than going to the Infowars.com store, is by taking the links of these very segments, going to your Facebook, your Twitter feed and let the world know what we're doing here at Infowars.
[3:50:19.600 --> 3:50:34.600]  Indeed, Infowars.com is the tip of the spear in the fight for a continued First Amendment and a vibrant, robust alternative media in America. Thanks for joining us. I'll be back.
[3:50:49.600 --> 3:51:09.600]  Don't become dependent on the medical system. Get and stay healthy naturally with extended weight. Metals in the liver cause peroxides to get dumped into the bloodstream.
[3:51:09.600 --> 3:51:20.600]  Peroxides do more damage than free radicals to the arteries, and the LDL has no protection from peroxides, causing the LDL to get stuck in the arteries, creating a potential blockage.

[3:53:58.600 --> 3:54:22.600]  Welcome back to Infowars. I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones. Folks, let's be absolutely clear. Alex Jones is being targeted.
[3:54:22.600 --> 3:54:38.600]  We have the intelligence services leaking the disinformation that Alex Jones is a Russian asset, and that the Russians have spent millions on computer bots pushing the links of Infowars.
[3:54:38.600 --> 3:54:58.600]  It is a lie, a canard, a falsehood, a false flag to discredit perhaps one of the most influential journalists on the right, and the distorted coverage of the child custody trial now going on in an Austin, Texas courtroom.
[3:54:58.600 --> 3:55:24.600]  Just another example of the attempts to smear Alex Jones. That's why your support for Infowars is so vitally crucial to keep his strong voice, and the voices of all the other men and women who work at Infowars out there as a beacon for patriots who need to know the truth to utilize it in the war of those against those who would censor us.
[3:55:24.600 --> 3:55:46.600]  Now, I think it is pretty clear when Donald Trump was elected. Prospects for world peace never looked better. The neocons and the progressives, the extreme Bush types on the neocon right, and the progressives are literally slavering for World War III.
[3:55:46.600 --> 3:55:58.600]  Donald Trump so far has outwitted them. For those who want to say, well, what are Trump's accomplishments in his first 100 days, I would argue that's pretty clear.
[3:55:58.600 --> 3:56:12.600]  For the first time, the Communist Chinese are working with us to try to rest the weapons of mass destruction being developed from the North Koreans from the international scene.
[3:56:12.600 --> 3:56:30.600]  This is a diplomatic breakthrough that the president is not getting credit for. Clearly, the Chinese have determined based on their meeting in Palm Beach with President Donald Trump that it's time for them to join the international community of nations.
[3:56:30.600 --> 3:56:50.600]  It's time to give up the currency manipulation and the wholesale theft of our copyright secrets done through internet piracy. Donald Trump has been unfairly criticized for not putting those issues ahead of the North Korean threat.
[3:56:50.600 --> 3:57:05.600]  In this case, I think the president has done exactly the same thing to claim that Trump has abandoned his goals when it comes to both currency manipulation and copyright theft is false.
[3:57:05.600 --> 3:57:23.600]  He has prioritized world peace for those economic issues by hats off now to President Donald Trump, who is despite the hectoring of the neocons and the progressives leading this country to a more peaceful world.
