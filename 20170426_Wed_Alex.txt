[00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:20.415]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:22.076]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:28.177]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.177 --> 00:00:28.677]  That's right.
[00:00:28.677 --> 00:00:33.318]  We're right here, hosting from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, the ATX.
[00:00:33.318 --> 00:00:36.299]  It's Wednesday, the 26th day of April 2017.
[00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:46.941]  We're gonna be here for the next four hours with myself, Paul Watson, Roger Stone, Mike Cernovich, and many, many others.
[00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:56.229]  I'm not going to spend a lot of time on the Chobani yogurt lawsuit today, but I'm going to cover it a little bit in the next segment.
[00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.131]  But what you need to know is the media is lying, as usual.
[00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:10.754]  They're saying there's no connections with Chobani and a refugee program, or the UN refugee program, and that there's no connections with George Soros, and I'm just making that up.
[00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:17.697]  Even though in the very video that they mentioned, but don't link to all of the news, I show the official news articles.
[00:01:18.732 --> 00:01:26.656]  Where the law firm that George Soros was the first client of, and financed, and still finances, and uses, is the one suing me.
[00:01:26.656 --> 00:01:40.344]  Or him meeting with Chobani to bring in more migrants, and how Chobani owner works with the UN agency to bring people in.
[00:01:40.344 --> 00:01:41.825]  I mean, it is just crazy.
[00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:46.727]  But their argument in the lawsuit is, oh, the State Department!
[00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:47.968]  The State Department!
[00:01:49.378 --> 00:01:52.120]  They're the ones that vet these and bring them in, exactly.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:01.346]  And the State Department gets its orders in the UN Refugee Program for Peter Sutherland, that runs that program that Chobani owner works with, along with George Soros, to open the borders.
[00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:13.295]  And then they certify people from seven countries as vetted, when these countries have their own Islamic caliphates that issue their passports that basically come from the back of a cereal box.
[00:02:15.472 --> 00:02:19.395]  Now I don't know if Hamid Ulukaya is a bad guy or not.
[00:02:19.395 --> 00:02:21.837]  I don't hate him personally.
[00:02:21.837 --> 00:02:27.981]  What I hate is the media and the Islamists and others oppressing people all over the world.
[00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:35.446]  And always going after anybody like Trump that says the cops getting shot, a whole bunch of them last week in Paris, was Islamic.
[00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:36.887]  They screamed Allah Akbar.
[00:02:36.887 --> 00:02:38.028]  ISIS took credit.
[00:02:38.028 --> 00:02:39.049]  The media said it's crazy.
[00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:41.630]  It's like, oh, look at this mouse.
[00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.110]  It's white.
[00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.270]  This computer mouse is white.
[00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.431]  You're totally insane!
[00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:46.372]  It's not white!
[00:02:46.372 --> 00:02:47.713]  The American flag's red, white, and blue.
[00:02:47.713 --> 00:02:48.933]  No, it isn't!
[00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:50.774]  Racist!
[00:02:50.774 --> 00:03:04.781]  But I've been doing deep research into Chobani owner, Hamid Ulukaya, because, look, they're saying, I went after him because I want to hurt his yogurt company, or I went after him because I've got a score to settle with Muslims or whatever.
[00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:06.062]  My crew covered that.
[00:03:06.062 --> 00:03:08.183]  David Knight covered that.
[00:03:08.183 --> 00:03:09.484]  The headline was from Rob Dew.
[00:03:11.112 --> 00:03:14.896]  And the point is, they did their research and were reporting on other reports.
[00:03:14.896 --> 00:03:19.141]  And it depends on how you look at it, but a lot of it is accurate.
[00:03:19.141 --> 00:03:22.024]  Did the yogurt place itself or the employees in Port Rapists?
[00:03:22.024 --> 00:03:22.165]  No.
[00:03:23.224 --> 00:03:25.026]  Do you think Shabani did it on purpose?
[00:03:25.026 --> 00:03:25.426]  The owner?
[00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:26.027]  Probably not.
[00:03:26.027 --> 00:03:27.348]  Who wants the trouble?
[00:03:27.348 --> 00:03:33.913]  The point is this larger flow and the unvettedness that he's pushing here and in Europe is causing a big problem.
[00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:35.475]  And that's what I'm sick and tired of.
[00:03:35.475 --> 00:03:39.478]  And that's what I hate, is the political correctness that won't admit all this is going on.
[00:03:39.478 --> 00:03:43.161]  Because the media twisted my words and said that, you know, I hate Shabani himself.
[00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:45.203]  No, I hate the bullying.
[00:03:46.943 --> 00:03:48.183]  And I'm doing some research.
[00:03:48.183 --> 00:03:50.184]  I'm weighing things here.
[00:03:50.184 --> 00:03:55.685]  But we can do clarifications, but really not retractions on the main issues, except for one thing.
[00:03:55.685 --> 00:04:03.287]  He is a Kurd, and I know the Kurds have been oppressed by Turkey big time, and the Kurds generally aren't starting fights with people around them.
[00:04:03.287 --> 00:04:07.688]  The military folks tell me some of the best people in the Middle East who've been oppressed by the radical Islamists are
[00:04:09.128 --> 00:04:13.190]  Our Kurds and his family from a dairy farm was oppressed by them.
[00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.332]  And I'm not against having refugees that are actually oppressed by radical Islam.
[00:04:16.332 --> 00:04:18.152]  I don't want to bring radical Islam in.
[00:04:18.152 --> 00:04:19.893]  So we have to weigh all this.
[00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:24.195]  I mean, maybe this guy just cares about Kurds or something and wants to bring them in.
[00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:29.858]  And he's pointed out the people reportedly that have pled guilty to sexual assault are North African and Iraqi.
[00:04:29.858 --> 00:04:31.038]  So I can get that point.
[00:04:31.038 --> 00:04:32.259]  So let's clarify that.
[00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.501]  So I may put out a larger clarification on the larger issues.
[00:04:36.801 --> 00:04:44.790]  On the issue of the media last year saying there weren't rapes or sexual assaults and attacking everybody, and yours truly, they've pled guilty now.
[00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.753]  So, again, it's the media that's been discredited here.
[00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:49.635]  The mainstream media is the main problem.
[00:04:49.635 --> 00:04:52.258]  But we will seek the truth, and we'll bring it to you.
[00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:54.160]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.462]  Huge nuke drills when we come back.
[00:05:01.056 --> 00:05:05.238]  North Korea continues to threaten the United States.
[00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:12.041]  This time saying they are ready to sink the US aircraft carrier Carl Vinson with a single strike.
[00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:21.305]  They also claim that their military has the ability to reach the continental United States and they are now in possession of a massive hydrogen bomb.
[00:05:21.305 --> 00:05:22.005]  Meanwhile the White
[00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:31.651]  The White House held an emergency meeting over North Korea that included a phone call between President Trump and China over the escalating tensions in the region.
[00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:42.098]  And China says World War III is inevitable as North Korea prepares for yet another nuclear missile test and Donald Trump is poised to intervene.
[00:05:42.358 --> 00:05:56.610]  The nuclear submarine USS Michigan has arrived in the South Korean port of Busan, and we've now learned that the United States is preparing to evacuate 230,000 Americans from South Korea.
[00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.473]  For more updates and news alerts, go to Infowars.com.
[00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:06.342]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:06:06.342 --> 00:06:08.445]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:06:08.445 --> 00:06:13.732]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:06:13.732 --> 00:06:17.497]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants that
[00:06:17.597 --> 00:06:21.019]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:24.221]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:06:24.221 --> 00:06:28.083]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:35.248]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:06:35.248 --> 00:06:40.631]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:42.952]  Iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[00:06:42.952 --> 00:06:51.255]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue that is Spearmint-free.
[00:06:51.255 --> 00:06:59.558]  Learn more about the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:04.589]  A new shipment of Bio-True Selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:06.070]  We've been sold out for months.
[00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:11.133]  Our one-of-a-kind Infowarslife Bio-True Selenium formula is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:11.133 --> 00:07:15.276]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[00:07:15.276 --> 00:07:24.963]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium, but Bio-True Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[00:07:24.963 --> 00:07:27.585]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are
[00:07:27.585 --> 00:07:40.671]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, BioTrue Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:45.553]  Visit Infowarslife.com to order your bottle of BioTrue Selenium before we sell it again.
[00:07:45.553 --> 00:07:53.377]  That's Infowarslife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalists.
[00:07:53.377 --> 00:07:53.597]  A 360 win.
[00:07:54.617 --> 00:07:56.678]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[00:07:56.678 --> 00:07:58.179]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[00:07:58.179 --> 00:07:59.440]  That's InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.962]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:08:01.962 --> 00:08:03.483]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:06.745]  I am so honored, ladies and gentlemen, to be here with you today.
[00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:27.151]  I follow my intellect, but more importantly, I follow my gut.
[00:08:27.151 --> 00:08:29.211]  That, of course, is your spirit.
[00:08:29.211 --> 00:08:40.216]  And everything I do with the assurity of a sleepwalker ends up turning out to be the right move, as long as I follow my gut, my North Star that's God.
[00:08:40.216 --> 00:08:50.459]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect, doesn't mean sometimes things don't look like a train wreck, but look at InfoWars, and look what we've done, look what you've done, look what we've all done together.
[00:08:50.459 --> 00:08:51.400]  Look what this crew's done.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.563]  It has changed the world in such a massive way.
[00:08:56.563 --> 00:09:07.692]  Globalism, unelected corporate planetary government is now collapsing, and the enemy's own internal documents, but also public statements, is in freefall, is in full retreat.
[00:09:09.073 --> 00:09:30.098]  They are then attempting to terrorize the nation states, flood them with Islamists, flood them with brainwashed leftist activists, and just prosperity haters, and are attempting full destabilization, and demonizing, attacking, destroying, or attempting to destroy anyone that is a focal point, anyone that is not a leader.
[00:09:31.124 --> 00:09:34.305]  But simply a common sense person trying to survive.
[00:09:34.305 --> 00:09:35.845]  I'm not a famous person.
[00:09:35.845 --> 00:09:37.206]  I'm not a celebrity.
[00:09:37.206 --> 00:09:38.586]  I'm not a star.
[00:09:38.586 --> 00:09:40.027]  I hate Hollywood.
[00:09:40.027 --> 00:09:41.207]  I hate the elite.
[00:09:41.207 --> 00:09:43.068]  I hate all the garbage.
[00:09:43.068 --> 00:09:52.271]  I am someone resisting up against the enemy because I don't want to be a slave because I have a spirit of liberty in me that God gave me.
[00:09:52.271 --> 00:10:00.013]  Now that said, Stephen Colbert has attacked me five times in the last week and a half starting
[00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:06.713]  His broadcast television show, Every Night With It.
[00:10:06.713 --> 00:10:15.077]  I saw my son this morning, over breakfast, and I said, if you see Stephen Colbert attacking me constantly, he says my wife is bringing it up.
[00:10:15.077 --> 00:10:23.841]  And he said, dad, nobody in my high school watches Stephen Colbert, only old people do.
[00:10:23.841 --> 00:10:28.183]  And that's not just my son saying that, that's what all the young people say, it's a joke.
[00:10:29.042 --> 00:10:34.247]  But everybody 40 and above thinks that Stephen Colbert is trendy and cutting edge and cool.
[00:10:34.247 --> 00:10:38.270]  Old people watch that.
[00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:46.338]  So Stephen Colbert wearing a tinfoil hat, ladies and gentlemen, and then talking with my gravelly voice.
[00:10:46.338 --> 00:10:49.561]  I mean, I guess some of it's funny with brain fight.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:11:05.898]  But at least now they're admitting on the X-Files and on Stephen Colbert and on Homeland and countless other shows that they're creating a straw man of Alex Jones.
[00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.132]  Chris Carter said he liked me and did a fair character.
[00:11:11.132 --> 00:11:13.134]  But all the other ones, I mean, there's so many.
[00:11:13.134 --> 00:11:19.159]  There's at least 10 national characters where they now admit it's based on me.
[00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:29.747]  Now notice, earlier in the year, before Homeland came out, we had a leaker that gave us the scripts and said Hillary was supposed to win, but they're going ahead with the scripts, that it's a woman that won, and they're just going to tweak it.
[00:11:29.747 --> 00:11:33.270]  But it's all about you, and how you're a fraud, and how you're fake, and how you're a liar.
[00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:39.674]  And then I talked about it, the news said I was crazy, no show would be about me.
[00:11:39.674 --> 00:11:45.078]  Well, they've since come out and said, yes, it's all based on Alex Jones.
[00:11:45.078 --> 00:11:51.123]  You need a search engine, Homeland talks about Alex Jones and how it's based on Alex Jones and how they're proud of it.
[00:11:51.123 --> 00:11:54.646]  And notice, then you see the news saying I'm fake.
[00:11:54.646 --> 00:11:58.289]  And you see the comedy shows saying I'm fake, because they're the fake ones.
[00:11:59.514 --> 00:12:03.536]  We don't have an army of sock puppets and disinfo people posting articles here at the office.
[00:12:03.536 --> 00:12:04.877]  We have a ragtag crew.
[00:12:04.877 --> 00:12:07.879]  We are telling the truth, or dying trying.
[00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:12.102]  And I don't want to start the broadcast about me, Paul Watson's coming up.
[00:12:12.102 --> 00:12:20.687]  But the reason we have to do this is, if they can destroy my name, and InfoWars name, new people when they see it will be psychologically poisoned.
[00:12:20.687 --> 00:12:24.870]  The well will be poisoned to actually looking at what we're saying.
[00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.691]  Now remember, these arrogant people,
[00:12:28.624 --> 00:12:35.928]  Think their audience is stupid, like whenever Trevor Noah came out last week.
[00:12:35.928 --> 00:12:40.271]  He's attacked me a few times this week.
[00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:42.492]  And incidentally, I think he's funnier than Stephen Colbert in many ways.
[00:12:42.492 --> 00:12:44.733]  I mean, I disagree with all his BS, but I mean, the guy's talented.
[00:12:44.733 --> 00:12:46.294]  He's a good-looking guy, too.
[00:12:46.294 --> 00:12:46.795]  I'll give him that.
[00:12:47.825 --> 00:12:53.669]  He came out and said, what are them planes doing flying over with the spray in the corners?
[00:12:53.669 --> 00:12:56.671]  I think those are Beverly Hillbillies.
[00:12:56.671 --> 00:13:00.054]  Let's get in the cement pool, have some pie, some pie.
[00:13:00.054 --> 00:13:04.597]  Okay, granny, let's do it.
[00:13:04.597 --> 00:13:08.920]  When you can just search engine, I have a limited crew right now, but just anybody can search engine, CFR.
[00:13:12.048 --> 00:13:33.423]  We need geoengineering, and then the article from six years ago admits we're already geoengineering, we're already adding aluminum, salts, barium, and other things to the jet fuel through the patents, through the big three makers of jet fuel, that it then aerosolizes and creates nuclei, and the Earth is 21 to 30 percent darker according to NASA.
[00:13:33.423 --> 00:13:38.406]  There it is, CFR, on the regulation of geoengineering.
[00:13:38.406 --> 00:13:40.328]  That's not the one I was talking about, but there it is.
[00:13:42.012 --> 00:13:42.512]  That's 2008.
[00:13:42.512 --> 00:13:44.093]  Yeah, there's another one from like 2012.
[00:13:44.093 --> 00:13:53.896]  But the point is, there's a global treaty on geoengineering and massive re-engineering of the planet.
[00:13:53.896 --> 00:13:56.297]  And they say as long as it's not military, it's okay.
[00:13:56.297 --> 00:13:59.438]  The Secretary of Defense in 1997 gave a big speech.
[00:13:59.438 --> 00:14:01.259]  He said, we have weather weapons, other have weather weapons.
[00:14:01.259 --> 00:14:07.961]  It's all over the news that Dubai's making the desert green and China's making it rain.
[00:14:07.961 --> 00:14:09.822]  Developments of international framework of geoengineering.
[00:14:09.822 --> 00:14:10.522]  They're in a CFR.
[00:14:11.761 --> 00:14:19.767]  So, this whole thing's going on, just like there were death panels in Obamacare, and just like it would double your prices, and just like it was written by insurance companies to screw you over.
[00:14:19.767 --> 00:14:27.592]  I would show you the bill, and they would just have Rachel Maddow go, he's deeply racist and doesn't like black people.
[00:14:27.592 --> 00:14:29.814]  Where's the proof of that?
[00:14:29.814 --> 00:14:31.315]  They don't care.
[00:14:31.315 --> 00:14:34.197]  So see, that's just one point.
[00:14:34.197 --> 00:14:40.562]  Of all the lies they put out, you're watching it, and
[00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.112]  The lies go like this.
[00:14:44.112 --> 00:14:48.777]  I can't remember who one teacher is of like 20 that my kids have.
[00:14:48.777 --> 00:14:50.318]  Then I don't know who my nannies are.
[00:14:50.318 --> 00:14:52.721]  Then I don't know their names by the time it gets to Colbert.
[00:14:54.205 --> 00:14:56.006]  And this is how they deceive.
[00:14:56.006 --> 00:15:00.428]  Or they say, hey, in the news, you sometimes put a lizard hat on.
[00:15:00.428 --> 00:15:01.848]  You really believe that you're a lizard?
[00:15:01.848 --> 00:15:02.649]  I say, of course not.
[00:15:02.649 --> 00:15:04.910]  I'm playing the part of being sarcastic satire.
[00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.070]  They go, oh, you're fake.
[00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.010]  Oh, oh, we got you.
[00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:07.591]  We got you.
[00:15:07.591 --> 00:15:12.713]  And look, I know the audience knows this, but remember, you're awake.
[00:15:12.713 --> 00:15:13.373]  None of us are perfect.
[00:15:13.373 --> 00:15:15.494]  We're all constantly trying to become more awake.
[00:15:15.494 --> 00:15:17.675]  We all see through rose-colored darkly, as the Bible says.
[00:15:19.215 --> 00:15:20.636]  But we're seeking the truth.
[00:15:20.636 --> 00:15:25.361]  The public they're targeting literally believes this crap is real.
[00:15:25.361 --> 00:15:30.646]  When they say Donald Trump hates Mexicans but don't show a clip, people believe it.
[00:15:30.646 --> 00:15:34.050]  When they say I love David Duke, that's all over the news.
[00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:41.537]  David Duke spends most of his time attacking me and I don't know why, but it's like David Duke hates me for at least 10 years.
[00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.612]  Because I don't hate groups for what color they are.
[00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:52.075]  I hate ideas, I hate cultures, like the communist Chinese or the Nazis.
[00:15:52.075 --> 00:15:53.756]  So then he says all this stuff about me.
[00:15:53.756 --> 00:15:58.139]  Yeah, he's not even compared to some of the others, the lies.
[00:15:58.139 --> 00:16:00.040]  I mean, he just kind of twists stuff.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.582]  And I mean, I'm not out to get the Black Panthers that hate white people.
[00:16:03.582 --> 00:16:04.963]  I'm not out to get David Duke.
[00:16:04.963 --> 00:16:08.025]  I just am not their enemy, but I sure as hell don't agree with them.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.220]  They don't care.
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.823]  They'll level their fingers at me in the media and say, you love David Duke.
[00:16:14.823 --> 00:16:15.743]  I go, where's the proof?
[00:16:15.743 --> 00:16:17.144]  Shut up, David Duke lover!
[00:16:17.144 --> 00:16:21.968]  And look, I don't let that reverse psychology work on me to then drive me over to that side.
[00:16:21.968 --> 00:16:25.930]  But I'm just here trying to be real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:31.414]  And just understand, we hang together or we hang separate, as Benjamin Franklin said.
[00:16:31.414 --> 00:16:33.715]  Coming back, I'm gonna hit the big news and Paul's coming in.
[00:16:33.715 --> 00:16:35.877]  Feds prep for nuclear attack in New Jersey.
[00:16:37.322 --> 00:16:37.482]  U.S.
[00:16:37.482 --> 00:16:43.005]  Navy fires warning flare at Iran vessel in the Persian Gulf.
[00:16:43.005 --> 00:16:45.787]  We've got Saudi Arabia trying to get nukes.
[00:16:45.787 --> 00:16:46.887]  I've got my sources.
[00:16:46.887 --> 00:16:48.268]  Cernovich has got his.
[00:16:48.268 --> 00:16:50.830]  Mine's separate, but very close to his source.
[00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.711]  And I gotta tell you, McMaster is pushing for war.
[00:16:53.711 --> 00:16:55.152]  He wants to give nukes to Saudi Arabia.
[00:16:55.152 --> 00:16:56.433]  They already got nukes.
[00:16:56.433 --> 00:17:02.977]  I was told by special ops folks, I'll just leave it at that, that Iran had nukes.
[00:17:04.742 --> 00:17:07.965]  16, 17 years ago and that Saudi Arabia got them.
[00:17:07.965 --> 00:17:13.570]  And of course, I was told that Pakistan had nukes 20 years ago by family before it was admitted.
[00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:14.331]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:17:14.331 --> 00:17:16.834]  I was never given any classified info.
[00:17:16.834 --> 00:17:19.877]  I was just, I was like, are we going into Iran during the Iraq war?
[00:17:19.877 --> 00:17:23.400]  And I told my family, we're not going into Iran.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.721]  They got nukes and missiles delivered.
[00:17:24.721 --> 00:17:26.844]  I was like, whoa.
[00:17:28.607 --> 00:17:32.208]  So, you know, obviously the officers passing that on down are like, that's not happening.
[00:17:32.208 --> 00:17:33.289]  And of course it later came out.
[00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:35.870]  Then I have some other sources as well.
[00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.571]  So that's why this is such a powder keg.
[00:17:37.571 --> 00:17:42.473]  North Korea is getting more advanced nukes and they're getting better missiles and they're crazy.
[00:17:42.473 --> 00:17:43.713]  And that's why they've got to be dealt with.
[00:17:43.713 --> 00:17:47.875]  Iran acts like they're crazy, not so much, but they need to stop harassing our boats.
[00:17:47.875 --> 00:17:49.015]  I mean, Trump's right.
[00:17:49.015 --> 00:17:51.316]  You shoot us again, we're going to blow your ass out of the water.
[00:17:51.316 --> 00:17:53.117]  I don't want a war, but we can't get pushed around here.
[00:17:53.797 --> 00:17:55.337]  So that's all coming up as well.
[00:17:55.337 --> 00:17:59.858]  Julian Assange says the CIA director is waging war on truth tellers like WikiLeaks.
[00:17:59.858 --> 00:18:02.339]  Let me just stop at this point.
[00:18:02.339 --> 00:18:10.420]  You know we're being sued by billionaire Federal Reserve Board of New York member, hooked into the big international Turkish organizations.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:16.061]  We're doing research on that, who openly pushes the Peter Sutherland and George Soros over the borders.
[00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:17.601]  You know he's suing us.
[00:18:17.601 --> 00:18:20.682]  And even Time Magazine, the Associated Press says he doesn't have a case.
[00:18:21.604 --> 00:18:23.726]  They just tend to keep hitting us and hitting us.
[00:18:23.726 --> 00:18:31.774]  I told you a month ago, from our sources, that George Soros and the Clinton Foundation are going to get a bunch of front groups to sue us.
[00:18:31.774 --> 00:18:33.536]  I was told that by high-level sources.
[00:18:33.536 --> 00:18:38.020]  Cernovich, who does have those sources, I've confirmed to his main sources, very high-level.
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.082]  Very high-level.
[00:18:40.082 --> 00:18:43.265]  And you've seen some of the family tweet, he deserves the Pulitzer Prize, I'll leave it at that.
[00:18:45.976 --> 00:18:53.120]  And so, the point is, is that we were told, and I know the Justice Department is aware of this, that they got their own fights.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:59.863]  We're kind of all out here alone, just fighting as hard as we can, that I am to be targeted and just sued, sued, sued, sued, sued, till we're destroyed.
[00:18:59.863 --> 00:19:00.784]  Well, guess what?
[00:19:00.784 --> 00:19:02.425]  We've got listeners that are to support us.

[00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:35.722]  People ask how real we are.
[00:19:35.722 --> 00:19:36.362]  Look at our info.
[00:19:36.362 --> 00:19:37.202]  It's hardcore.

[00:19:42.505 --> 00:19:43.425]  You are.
[00:19:43.425 --> 00:19:44.386]  That's why the enemy hates us.
[00:19:44.386 --> 00:19:47.007]  You'll know a man by his enemies.
[00:19:47.007 --> 00:19:48.628]  We're not just not funded by Soros.
[00:19:48.628 --> 00:19:49.288]  He's after us.

[00:22:59.522 --> 00:23:05.108]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's, in an epic battle of David versus Goliath.
[00:23:05.108 --> 00:23:07.471]  In the early 1980s, a child was born.
[00:23:07.471 --> 00:23:08.412]  Two of them, actually.
[00:23:08.412 --> 00:23:10.474]  Their names were Jeff and Andy.
[00:23:10.474 --> 00:23:14.838]  Time went by, they developed facial hair, and one day, something happened.
[00:23:14.838 --> 00:23:16.941]  Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors.
[00:23:17.401 --> 00:23:21.363]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all.
[00:23:21.363 --> 00:23:30.246]  They hired the best designers, they bought a 95-year-old German blade factory, and they started selling high-quality razors online with no upcharging to wreck the customers.
[00:23:30.246 --> 00:23:32.587]  How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[00:23:32.587 --> 00:23:34.068]  By threatening to sue their pants off.
[00:23:34.448 --> 00:23:35.428]  Don't worry.

[00:24:04.845 --> 00:24:25.682]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:24:25.682 --> 00:24:28.604]  Paul Walsh is coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:28.604 --> 00:24:31.947]  In studio, joining us from London, England.
[00:24:31.947 --> 00:24:32.868]  Old London Town.
[00:24:34.619 --> 00:24:35.920]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:43.346]  Most people seek affirmation from society, from culture, from the establishment.
[00:24:43.346 --> 00:24:46.608]  And they want to be conformist, and they want to be successful within the system.
[00:24:46.608 --> 00:24:49.190]  And that's great if you have a good system.
[00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:58.818]  But if you're an authoritarian EU, or authoritarian North Korea, or authoritarian Venezuela, where they're starving to death for four years running, eating their family pets, well those were eaten a few years ago,
[00:25:01.195 --> 00:25:07.800]  Conforming to a system that's broken the social contract is called cultural suicide.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:14.626]  And I'm not going to commit suicide culturally, or physically, or spiritually.
[00:25:14.626 --> 00:25:16.788]  I was a history buff growing up.
[00:25:16.788 --> 00:25:18.049]  People ask why I'm so radical.
[00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.950]  I'm not radical.
[00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.171]  History is radical.
[00:25:20.171 --> 00:25:21.251]  Truth is radical.
[00:25:21.251 --> 00:25:22.532]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:25:22.532 --> 00:25:23.573]  Always is.
[00:25:23.573 --> 00:25:24.194]  Always has been.
[00:25:26.696 --> 00:25:36.340]  And I had studied history, and I've studied recent history, and I started reading then handbooks written by the globalists by the time I was 12 years old.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.722]  And articles and publications.
[00:25:41.192 --> 00:25:56.303]  of the John Birch Society, and none dare call it conspiracy, that I was reading what they said the elite were doing, and then I'd go read what the elite were saying at the library by the time I was 16, at law libraries to actually read Club of Rome stuff, and it was word for word what JBS was saying.
[00:25:56.303 --> 00:26:00.346]  JBS is the most truthful, I don't even remember, organization I've ever heard of.
[00:26:02.517 --> 00:26:08.478]  And it was founded by US intelligence operatives who knew we were putting communist Chinese in charge in 1949.
[00:26:08.478 --> 00:26:12.859]  That's when our own splinter groups and our government went, we're not putting up with this.
[00:26:12.859 --> 00:26:18.181]  And those splinter groups have been in the government ever since trying to fight this.
[00:26:18.181 --> 00:26:23.742]  That's why Julian Assange has come out and said the CIA director is waging war on truth tellers like WikiLeaks, The Washington Post.
[00:26:24.721 --> 00:26:27.103]  Trump is so wrong on this.
[00:26:27.103 --> 00:26:34.689]  When the whistleblowers and our own intelligence agencies got the intel out on Hillary's criminal activity, you said if you've got the info, release it.
[00:26:34.689 --> 00:26:37.691]  Trump said that.
[00:26:37.691 --> 00:26:39.773]  Gotta play that clip in the next segment.
[00:26:39.773 --> 00:26:43.996]  He said if the Russians had it, they should release it, because it's Hillary committing the crimes.
[00:26:43.996 --> 00:26:45.558]  So how can Trump now do this?
[00:26:45.558 --> 00:26:51.042]  This, for me, is the biggest black eye to Trump.
[00:26:51.042 --> 00:26:52.143]  And I know he delegates.
[00:26:54.059 --> 00:26:59.681]  And I know if he goes after the Russians on the surface and goes after WikiLeaks on the surface, that gets him office back in Congress.
[00:26:59.681 --> 00:27:03.563]  But it's all made up anyways, so he shouldn't do that for public consumption.
[00:27:03.563 --> 00:27:04.443]  It's wrong.
[00:27:04.443 --> 00:27:06.324]  We always hear Trump's so loyal.
[00:27:06.324 --> 00:27:18.449]  Well, if people did things that were legal and lawful, exposing criminal activity and the government, and it got you elected, how in the hell, excuse me, how on earth can you do that, President Trump?
[00:27:20.717 --> 00:27:22.017]  I'm glad you're controlling our border.
[00:27:22.017 --> 00:27:23.538]  I'm glad you're getting our taxes cut.
[00:27:23.538 --> 00:27:25.058]  I'm glad you're trying to repeal Obamacare.
[00:27:25.058 --> 00:27:27.478]  I'm glad you're trying to stop the Islamists pouring in.
[00:27:27.478 --> 00:27:37.060]  I love 85% of what you're doing, but I don't want to give nukes to North Korea like the Clintons did, and I don't want to give them to Saudi Arabia like McMasters is pushing for.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.120]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[00:27:48.311 --> 00:27:53.873]  It's absolutely certain that if Trump does this, it's wrong.
[00:27:53.873 --> 00:27:57.634]  And it opens the door for them to be able to say, well, you got this information.
[00:27:57.634 --> 00:28:01.035]  You claim it's criminal, so you're a criminal, so the election's illegitimate.
[00:28:01.035 --> 00:28:02.436]  It's horse manure.
[00:28:02.436 --> 00:28:05.457]  We need more leaks exposing criminal activity, not less.
[00:28:05.457 --> 00:28:13.160]  I understand Trump doesn't like leaks inside his National Security Council on constitutional stuff, but that's not what this was.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.541]  This was her private illegal servers and crimes she was committing.
[00:28:18.131 --> 00:28:20.773]  I'm going to have to come back in the next segment and take some of Paul's time.
[00:28:20.773 --> 00:28:24.817]  I'm sure he'll be fine to get into this whole nuke drill, because that ties into all this.
[00:28:24.817 --> 00:28:34.605]  But I've got a major warning for Trump when we return on the other side of this break, one of the most important I've ever issued, and it ties into all of this straight ahead.
[00:28:34.605 --> 00:28:36.227]  You heard me plug at the end of the last segment.
[00:28:36.227 --> 00:28:37.107]  I'm going to plug again here.
[00:28:37.833 --> 00:28:46.838]  Because we had a lot of capital come in last week to help fund things, had a big specials end, and now there's not enough capital coming in day by day if you look at it to fund the operation.
[00:28:46.838 --> 00:28:49.419]  And some weeks we're in the red, some weeks we're in the black.
[00:28:49.419 --> 00:29:04.387]  We need to have a lot of black weeks to be able to deal with the globalist Islamists' lawsuits, the George Soros law firm Islamists' lawsuit that the media is playing dumb on, that the Federal Reserve Board members suing me on the secret New York Fed.
[00:29:04.387 --> 00:29:06.849]  I mean, you'll know a man by his enemies.
[00:29:07.972 --> 00:29:09.373]  My enemies are your enemies.
[00:29:09.373 --> 00:29:13.816]  They hate you because this is a conduit, a focal point, and we're rising, and they hate it.
[00:29:13.816 --> 00:29:17.938]  And if they can politically assassinate me, you know what's coming next, the physical.
[00:29:17.938 --> 00:29:24.142]  So we need your prayers, but InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, a lot of big specials running right now.
[00:29:24.142 --> 00:29:27.965]  Go take advantage of them and help fund this operation, or call toll-free, AAA-253-3139.

[00:29:50.034 --> 00:29:51.415]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.415 --> 00:29:53.936]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.936 --> 00:29:56.617]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.778 --> 00:30:15.605]  Google wants to save you from fake news, and they are rewriting their algorithm to bury misleading, false, and offensive news articles.
[00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:25.971]  Google's parent company, Alphabet Incorporated, recently announced a rare sweeping change to its search function, and they have already declared InfoWars
[00:30:26.471 --> 00:30:28.291]  As untrustworthy.
[00:30:28.291 --> 00:30:44.455]  Google claims the new changes are in response to the fake news outbreak of 2016 when the Russians infiltrated alternative and social media to defeat Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump win the presidential election.
[00:30:44.455 --> 00:30:51.876]  So far it remains unclear how the state of California was immune to the Russians' propaganda.
[00:30:52.337 --> 00:30:55.752]  I'm Darren McBreen, and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:00.868 --> 00:31:01.688]  Hey, everyone!
[00:31:01.688 --> 00:31:03.969]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[00:31:03.969 --> 00:31:07.811]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:31:07.811 --> 00:31:09.892]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:31:09.892 --> 00:31:20.176]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:31:20.176 --> 00:31:26.159]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:26.980]  We're good to go.
[00:31:41.596 --> 00:31:42.156]  I think so.
[00:32:01.297 --> 00:32:02.878]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:32:02.878 --> 00:32:08.782]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[00:32:08.782 --> 00:32:11.323]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[00:32:11.323 --> 00:32:17.147]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[00:32:17.147 --> 00:32:22.851]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[00:32:23.271 --> 00:32:26.234]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[00:32:26.234 --> 00:32:31.800]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:38.827]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[00:32:38.827 --> 00:32:43.392]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[00:32:43.652 --> 00:32:46.933]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[00:32:46.933 --> 00:32:49.034]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[00:32:49.034 --> 00:32:54.756]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[00:32:54.756 --> 00:32:57.177]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[00:32:57.177 --> 00:32:58.878]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[00:33:04.324 --> 00:33:08.405]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:08.405 --> 00:33:11.146]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:11.146 --> 00:33:14.846]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:33:14.846 --> 00:33:17.827]  Run on for a long time.
[00:33:17.827 --> 00:33:20.628]  Run on for a long time.
[00:33:20.628 --> 00:33:23.628]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:33:23.628 --> 00:33:26.009]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:33:28.718 --> 00:33:31.741]  All right, Paul Watson is going to be in studio here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:31.741 --> 00:33:33.963]  I want to hit a final big story here.
[00:33:33.963 --> 00:33:38.328]  I'll be back later in the next hour, popping in as well.
[00:33:38.328 --> 00:33:39.529]  Stefan Malin is coming up.
[00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:41.591]  Mike Cernovich is coming up.
[00:33:41.591 --> 00:33:42.912]  Roger Stone's coming up today.
[00:33:42.912 --> 00:33:46.136]  Paul Joseph Watson here in studio, obviously.
[00:33:47.563 --> 00:33:49.966]  Okay, so we reported on this a few days ago.
[00:33:49.966 --> 00:33:50.787]  Now it's big news.
[00:33:50.787 --> 00:33:53.730]  Mainstream media is covering our fake news, of course.
[00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:56.293]  Now we just lead because we're cutting edge.
[00:33:56.293 --> 00:33:58.695]  That's why they hate us, because they don't control the narrative now.
[00:33:58.695 --> 00:34:01.458]  Feds prep for nuclear attack in New Jersey.
[00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:08.472]  Federal authorities are running nuclear response drills at MetLife Stadium in northern New Jersey.
[00:34:08.472 --> 00:34:12.153]  Homeland Security and FEMA are conducting Operation Gotham Shield.
[00:34:12.153 --> 00:34:18.755]  The purpose is to practice how to access and evacuate victims during a potential nuclear attack in the New York City area.
[00:34:18.755 --> 00:34:27.977]  The drills simulate a scenario in which a 10,000 ton improvised nuclear device goes off on the New Jersey side of the Lincoln Tunnel.
[00:34:27.977 --> 00:34:29.217]  Alright, so let's stop right there.
[00:34:31.564 --> 00:34:34.566]  This is a COG drill.
[00:34:34.566 --> 00:34:37.088]  Continuity of Government drill.
[00:34:37.088 --> 00:34:47.277]  I've been telling you since Trump got elected November 8th that the noises they were making about we need a civil emergency, the election wasn't real, overturn it, we need a crisis.
[00:34:47.277 --> 00:34:53.642]  That's the dumbed down folks at CNN, MSNBC just getting the word to their teleprompter loads from the globalists.
[00:34:53.642 --> 00:34:59.787]  Start talking about emergencies, civil emergencies, new elections, homeland security, taking over elections.
[00:35:00.945 --> 00:35:09.851]  That's continuity of government, which copies the Nazi continuity of government program called Project or Operation Valkyrie.
[00:35:09.851 --> 00:35:14.134]  Their false flag ops were called Operation Himmler.
[00:35:14.134 --> 00:35:17.917]  So the Germans did have one of the most sophisticated governmental systems at the end of World War II.
[00:35:17.917 --> 00:35:22.880]  That's why it was adopted by the CIA, NASA, our entire system, basically.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.102]  Not saying it's a Nazi conspiracy, they just took it over.
[00:35:25.102 --> 00:35:26.063]  That's well known.
[00:35:26.063 --> 00:35:28.284]  36,000 high-level Nazis brought over more than 100,000 technicians.
[00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:33.591]  Yeah, the Nazi refugee program.
[00:35:33.591 --> 00:35:38.654]  So, you have this system.
[00:35:38.654 --> 00:35:43.478]  The Germans tried to use Valkyrie against Hitler, using COG to overthrow him.
[00:35:43.478 --> 00:35:52.484]  Now the idea is they're saying Trump's Hitler, that's what the Democrats are going around months after I told you they would, to Congress and to the Pentagon saying he needs to be overthrown, we need a military coup.
[00:35:52.484 --> 00:36:00.630]  And the way to do it is to claim it's legitimate under COG, have the Democrats declare the whole election null and void, and then come out and
[00:36:02.463 --> 00:36:08.468]  Say that all the Republicans that got elected basically, they have to step down, they have to go away and a new election is going to happen.
[00:36:08.468 --> 00:36:12.952]  And under Obama's last executive order, Homeland Security will be in charge of the election.
[00:36:12.952 --> 00:36:15.174]  All that's now happened.
[00:36:15.174 --> 00:36:17.416]  They've set that all up, they've prepared it, they've done it.
[00:36:17.416 --> 00:36:19.838]  Because that's how I would do it if I was them.
[00:36:19.838 --> 00:36:21.059]  Historically.
[00:36:21.059 --> 00:36:22.721]  So, all of that's been unfolding.
[00:36:26.875 --> 00:36:29.176]  I've been saying, look for massive nuke drills.
[00:36:29.176 --> 00:36:32.137]  Now this is probably happening on the surface with North Korea threatening to nuke.
[00:36:32.137 --> 00:36:34.738]  In fact, no doubt, part of it is because of that.
[00:36:34.738 --> 00:36:37.298]  And the situation with Syria and Russia.
[00:36:37.298 --> 00:36:38.919]  But this is the biggest nuke drills ever.
[00:36:38.919 --> 00:36:42.320]  DC, New York, New Jersey, it's happening everywhere.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.801]  And they'll have the doomsday planes in the sky.
[00:36:44.801 --> 00:36:46.301]  They'll have the president moving around.
[00:36:46.301 --> 00:36:48.082]  This is a big drill.
[00:36:48.082 --> 00:36:50.403]  One of the biggest, if not biggest ever.
[00:36:50.403 --> 00:36:53.864]  Trump needs to know, and I'm not saying this is going to happen, but with everything else going on,
[00:36:55.543 --> 00:37:02.086]  And the missile defense being put in in South Korea and all the rest of it and North Korea threatening to nuke our carriers and just the huge escalations.
[00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:09.689]  With all of this unfolding, they can use COG because COG and the alternate government kicks in.
[00:37:11.912 --> 00:37:21.440]  Right as these drills kick in and Congress and the leaders of Congress are then moved out to, quote, safe zones like Site R in Maryland.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.343]  Very easy to decapitate them during this drill.
[00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:33.210]  Because you don't want to decapitate Congress with a nuke going off or something for real, or a mass bombing or shooting, the leadership being killed.
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.881]  I'm not saying this is going to happen.
[00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:53.733]  In the next few days as these drills are ongoing, this isn't the only one.
[00:37:53.733 --> 00:38:03.081]  I'm telling you that this is the time they do it or they might bootleg it and test it during this one and see if other agencies are aware of what's happening.
[00:38:03.081 --> 00:38:10.227]  Because if the shadow group trying to use the COG, which they are, to take over starts getting caught in the process or wants to abort.
[00:38:11.263 --> 00:38:16.147]  They can do it, claiming it's just a drill, and this follows past operations.
[00:38:16.147 --> 00:38:33.003]  So, President Trump needs to understand, during a COG drill like this, he's at the greatest danger of a military coup with the globalists at the highest levels, or a globalist coup through FEMA and other agencies, and needs to be watching this very, very carefully.
[00:38:33.003 --> 00:38:37.687]  Again, they were having national security COG drills when they tried to kill Hitler during Operation Valkyrie.
[00:38:39.568 --> 00:38:42.270]  They've had overthrows in Russia during drills.
[00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:50.254]  Because you see all the trucks and tanks and things, and helicopters moving around, and so you think, oh, that's just part of the drill, and it's not.
[00:38:50.254 --> 00:38:51.495]  There was a drill going on by the U.S.
[00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:56.938]  military in Panama, of course, in 19... Was it 1988, 89?
[00:38:56.938 --> 00:38:59.820]  It was 88, it was 88, 89.
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:00.801]  That was the drill.
[00:39:00.801 --> 00:39:04.843]  So we need to be absolutely vigilant during this entire period.
[00:39:07.571 --> 00:39:10.173]  Now, separately, I'm going to hand the baton to Paul Watson right now.
[00:39:10.173 --> 00:39:16.716]  We have Hamid Bulakayev, who was born as a Kurdish minority.
[00:39:16.716 --> 00:39:17.977]  He says persecuted group.
[00:39:17.977 --> 00:39:19.078]  I believe that.
[00:39:19.078 --> 00:39:21.619]  The Kurds have been persecuted from the military I've talked to.
[00:39:21.619 --> 00:39:25.041]  They seem to be a nicer, more non-radical group of Muslims.
[00:39:25.041 --> 00:39:25.762]  I've met a lot of Muslims.
[00:39:25.762 --> 00:39:26.782]  They're nice people.
[00:39:26.782 --> 00:39:29.544]  I don't want to sit there and say I hate this guy because I don't personally hate him.
[00:39:31.075 --> 00:39:32.595]  Now suing me, not for $10,000.
[00:39:32.595 --> 00:39:35.476]  That's just how you have to file in Idaho.
[00:39:35.476 --> 00:39:39.417]  And then it's got punitive damages, it could be millions.
[00:39:39.417 --> 00:39:46.159]  For reporting on mainstream news articles confirming the charging of these teens for sexual assault.
[00:39:46.159 --> 00:39:48.580]  Remember the media for a year said it wasn't true, it was all a lie.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.540]  We were liars, everybody else.
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:54.141]  We were just following it, but we got called the creators of it and fake news.
[00:39:54.141 --> 00:39:56.762]  So now the headline everywhere is I'm fake news, this is all fake.
[00:39:57.947 --> 00:40:01.808]  Because they're saying, technically, Chobani Yogurt didn't bring them in, the State Department did.
[00:40:01.808 --> 00:40:05.330]  Well, he's the owner.
[00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:18.115]  He lobbies the UN, and it's in the news, as part of the Clinton Global Initiative, and meets with George Soros, saying, I'm looking forward, in the next few years, this is two years ago, to working with George Soros to bring in more refugees.
[00:40:18.115 --> 00:40:20.776]  And they say, well, we didn't bring in unvetted.
[00:40:20.776 --> 00:40:21.916]  The State Department did.
[00:40:21.916 --> 00:40:25.637]  The point is, you're promoting refugees that are in the town.
[00:40:25.637 --> 00:40:26.998]  You're the main employer in the town.
[00:40:28.899 --> 00:40:32.241]  There's thousands of refugees in the town.
[00:40:32.241 --> 00:40:34.282]  The colonization has been going on for 20 years.
[00:40:34.282 --> 00:40:36.363]  I'm not sitting there questioning that.
[00:40:36.363 --> 00:40:38.144]  I'm not saying you want rapists here.
[00:40:38.144 --> 00:40:46.488]  So we, three weeks ago when their lawyers called us and sent letters, I saw the headlines and that's a little strong to say they're caught importing rapist migrants.
[00:40:46.488 --> 00:40:54.653]  No, it's just that company and owner who've been pushing migrants come into the country who've now pled guilty.
[00:40:55.458 --> 00:40:56.959]  That's really the headline.
[00:40:56.959 --> 00:40:57.999]  So we changed it.
[00:40:57.999 --> 00:41:00.800]  They sued us and say we didn't change it.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.420]  So that's a deception in the media.
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.181]  And what it is, in my view, is a publicity stunt.
[00:41:04.181 --> 00:41:05.321]  I'm all over the news.
[00:41:05.321 --> 00:41:06.182]  I'm everywhere.
[00:41:06.182 --> 00:41:07.742]  They want to brand us as fake news.
[00:41:07.742 --> 00:41:12.924]  You come out, Chobani Yogurt has gotten, you know, some heat for saying they hire refugees.
[00:41:12.924 --> 00:41:14.845]  So has, and saying they want more.
[00:41:14.845 --> 00:41:15.625]  So has Starbucks.
[00:41:15.625 --> 00:41:17.966]  They lost like 20% revenue in the last few months.
[00:41:17.966 --> 00:41:19.026]  That's your fault!
[00:41:21.633 --> 00:41:32.977]  Hamid Ulukaya, you get government lunch programs, you've got an exclusive nationwide on that, you get government contracts, you're on the Federal Reserve Board, we're investigating your Gulan connections.
[00:41:32.977 --> 00:41:36.498]  David Knight's usually not a very aggressive guy, but he says we should go on the offense, and I agree.
[00:41:36.498 --> 00:41:41.140]  We're going to send investigative journalists there, we're going to get totally involved, we're going to interview local doctors.
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:45.181]  They're suing me saying refugees haven't increased TB, even though it's all over the news.
[00:41:45.181 --> 00:41:47.502]  He pushes bringing in refugees.
[00:41:47.502 --> 00:41:48.623]  TB explodes.
[00:41:49.696 --> 00:41:55.021]  All over the country, they're suing me saying Chobani yogurt brought in.
[00:41:55.021 --> 00:41:59.244]  I said you, the owner of it, have pushed it and they're not vetting people for TB.
[00:41:59.244 --> 00:42:01.186]  That's all over the news.
[00:42:01.186 --> 00:42:12.475]  And what I hate is the arrogance and the bullying of mainstream media and radical Islam that thinks that they can say we're all crazy that no Muslims are raping anybody when there's an epidemic all over the world.
[00:42:12.475 --> 00:42:14.137]  I don't know this Chobani owner.
[00:42:15.126 --> 00:42:15.926]  I did a poll.
[00:42:15.926 --> 00:42:17.627]  Two of my kids don't like it.
[00:42:17.627 --> 00:42:18.407]  One of my children love it.
[00:42:18.407 --> 00:42:20.568]  A lot of people I talk to, they love it.
[00:42:20.568 --> 00:42:21.669]  I think it's too dry a yogurt.
[00:42:21.669 --> 00:42:24.830]  I don't like Greek-style yogurt.
[00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.091]  They shoot me saying I'm out to get his company.
[00:42:27.091 --> 00:42:32.754]  Bro, I didn't even know or pay attention to the fact that you were a Muslim.
[00:42:34.764 --> 00:42:39.206]  I just kept hearing about the Islamists supposedly raping out in this town and how it was getting covered up.
[00:42:39.206 --> 00:42:41.687]  And the media tried to cover it up, but now they pled guilty.
[00:42:41.687 --> 00:42:47.410]  So the claim that I want to hurt your yogurt company, I hope you're a good Kurdish immigrant.
[00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:49.991]  I hope you want to fight radical Islam.
[00:42:49.991 --> 00:42:56.714]  Because I know the Kurds, along with the Alawites, are some of the only groups that don't want radical Islam taken over that are Muslim.
[00:42:56.714 --> 00:42:57.874]  So I hope you're a good guy.
[00:42:57.874 --> 00:43:01.256]  But man, you're with George Soros, his law firm that he founded.
[00:43:02.768 --> 00:43:04.190]  Is suing me?
[00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:09.276]  You're working with him in the UN, and then you're saying none of that's true?
[00:43:09.276 --> 00:43:18.947]  I've talked to four top lawyers, including lawyers in Idaho, and they say, and my lawyers will tell me when I've got problems, they say, man,
[00:43:20.916 --> 00:43:22.916]  Well, this guy's really miscalculated.
[00:43:22.916 --> 00:43:24.997]  And I'm not saying that to act tough.
[00:43:24.997 --> 00:43:27.298]  Even Time Magazine says you don't have a case.
[00:43:27.298 --> 00:43:30.138]  But he's got a billion dollars, so I guess he wants to put me through it.
[00:43:30.138 --> 00:43:30.798]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:43:30.798 --> 00:43:31.959]  I'll get attorney's fees.
[00:43:31.959 --> 00:43:35.800]  It's just the time and what it'll take.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.440]  Let's scroll down.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:41.581]  It shows him with his wife or girlfriend, beautiful Muslim-looking lady or Kurdish-looking lady.
[00:43:41.581 --> 00:43:42.401]  Let's click on it.
[00:43:42.401 --> 00:43:45.762]  You know, he lets his wife or girlfriend, whoever it is, out without a hood over her head.
[00:43:45.762 --> 00:43:48.683]  A lot of Kurds, women have more freedom in Kurdistan.
[00:43:48.683 --> 00:43:49.383]  Let me show that photo.
[00:43:49.383 --> 00:43:49.823]  Just scroll down.
[00:43:49.823 --> 00:43:50.203]  It's right there.
[00:43:51.038 --> 00:43:52.620]  It's in that article.
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:53.961]  I saw it online.
[00:43:53.961 --> 00:43:55.783]  It's the top.
[00:43:55.783 --> 00:43:59.707]  Well, anyways, I just searched this morning, Shabani Alex Jones.
[00:43:59.707 --> 00:44:03.771]  And if you just click it, it was in all the stories I saw on my phone, at least.
[00:44:03.771 --> 00:44:07.455]  And there he is with his beautiful wife, her girlfriend, enjoying freedom in America.
[00:44:07.455 --> 00:44:08.836]  Great, bro, that's what I want to see.
[00:44:08.836 --> 00:44:10.658]  She used to wear a pretty black dress.
[00:44:10.658 --> 00:44:11.399]  She used to go out.
[00:44:11.399 --> 00:44:12.140]  She used to have freedom.
[00:44:13.157 --> 00:44:14.758]  And if you're like that, that's great.
[00:44:14.758 --> 00:44:15.978]  Come out and clarify.
[00:44:15.978 --> 00:44:17.839]  Because I've clarified.
[00:44:17.839 --> 00:44:21.841]  And I retracted the headline that I said, yeah, that's a little extreme.
[00:44:21.841 --> 00:44:23.242]  But we didn't do that on purpose.
[00:44:23.242 --> 00:44:25.103]  We were covering the other headlines, other news.
[00:44:25.103 --> 00:44:26.443]  And you know that.
[00:44:26.443 --> 00:44:27.504]  So you want some publicity?
[00:44:32.745 --> 00:44:38.767]  I'm still going to cover whatever's going on with you, but if you want to go the whole nine yards with me, just look what I've done in court in other cases.
[00:44:38.767 --> 00:44:40.508]  We don't back down.
[00:44:40.508 --> 00:44:42.569]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:44:42.569 --> 00:44:43.989]  Our listeners don't back down.
[00:44:43.989 --> 00:44:44.850]  Spread the links.
[00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:46.070]  Stand up against the globalists.
[00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:46.810]  Support us.
[00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:47.711]  Buy the products.
[00:44:47.711 --> 00:44:48.591]  Pray for us.
[00:44:48.591 --> 00:44:49.591]  We're all on the same team.
[00:44:49.591 --> 00:44:51.432]  I want to thank the listeners worldwide.
[00:44:51.432 --> 00:44:53.553]  Now, let's go to Paul Joseph Watson in studio.
[00:44:55.199 --> 00:44:55.980]  We are live!
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:59.163]  It's Wednesday, April 26th on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:00.664]  Again, another huge show lined up.
[00:45:00.664 --> 00:45:13.256]  Stefan Molyneux is coming up in the next hour to talk about North Korea, the French election, the fallout from that, obviously the polls show that the establishment candidate Macron, as we've been discussing, is way ahead.
[00:45:13.256 --> 00:45:17.880]  What can Marine Le Pen do, if anything, to pull that back over the next 10 days or so?
[00:45:18.641 --> 00:45:30.029]  James Wesley Rawls is going to be on in the third hour to talk about all these mass terror attack drills that are going on in New York, Washington DC and other cities as it relates to North Korea.
[00:45:30.828 --> 00:45:38.214]  We also have Mike Cernovich coming on in the third hour to talk about his big story about Saudi Arabia obtaining arms.
[00:45:38.214 --> 00:45:41.838]  Basically, a McMaster neocon coup could be happening.
[00:45:41.838 --> 00:45:45.461]  We're going to drill into that with Mike Cernovich.
[00:45:45.461 --> 00:45:50.945]  First, though, we're going to go to this clip and then I'm going to talk about it, which is Ivanka Trump.
[00:45:50.945 --> 00:45:53.508]  And this is why many people remain concerned.
[00:45:54.068 --> 00:46:04.572]  About President Donald Trump being surrounded by globalists, being surrounded by people with interests and agendas that the American people did not vote for.
[00:46:04.572 --> 00:46:07.673]  One of whom could very well be Ivanka Trump.
[00:46:07.673 --> 00:46:16.377]  Today she says, and this is a Daily Caller headline, Ivanka Trump resettling Syrian refugees in US should be part of the discussion.
[00:46:16.377 --> 00:46:17.297]  Let's go to the clip.
[00:46:18.422 --> 00:46:18.962]  I think there is...
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:44.008]  A global humanitarian crisis that's happening, and we have to come together, and we have to solve it.
[00:46:44.008 --> 00:46:48.434]  And, you know, refugees... Does that include opening the borders to Syrian refugees in the U.S.?
[00:46:48.434 --> 00:46:51.738]  That has to be part of the discussion, but that's not going to be enough in and of itself.
[00:46:52.858 --> 00:47:02.007]  There's Ivanka Trump basically reversing Donald Trump's policy before the election, saying that the US should open its borders for Syrian refugees.
[00:47:02.007 --> 00:47:04.510]  That's very misinformed at best.
[00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:07.113]  Of course, you know we've covered the stories over and over again.
[00:47:07.113 --> 00:47:12.878]  In fact, just a few days ago we had a story out of Italy, which found that only 2.65% of the people coming into Europe
[00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:18.502]  through Italy were actually refugees.
[00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:18.942]  Okay?
[00:47:18.942 --> 00:47:22.323]  The vast majority of these people are not Syrian.
[00:47:22.323 --> 00:47:24.004]  They're not even refugees.
[00:47:24.004 --> 00:47:27.145]  They're economic migrants.
[00:47:27.145 --> 00:47:34.107]  So to call for them to just be allowed into the United States again shows a very limited, very misinformed, very naive perspective.
[00:47:34.107 --> 00:47:41.590]  There you see Breitbart reporting only 2.65% of the refugees, the migrants coming in, actually got refugee status.
[00:47:42.588 --> 00:47:45.493]  And as you can see, not many women and children are there.
[00:47:45.493 --> 00:47:47.096]  Not many Syrians.
[00:47:47.096 --> 00:47:48.399]  OK, newsflash.
[00:47:48.399 --> 00:47:50.262]  Syrian people aren't black.
[00:47:50.262 --> 00:47:52.727]  Those people are coming from West Africa.
[00:47:52.727 --> 00:47:54.630]  They're not Syrian refugees.
[00:47:56.035 --> 00:47:56.995]  They're picking them up.
[00:47:56.995 --> 00:47:58.235]  I've talked about it over and over.
[00:47:58.235 --> 00:48:03.917]  We have NGOs working with the European Union picking them up 11 miles off the coast of Libya.
[00:48:03.917 --> 00:48:14.279]  They work directly with criminal people, smugglers, who call them up on the phone an hour before and say we've got a new boatload of migrants to dump into Italy.
[00:48:14.279 --> 00:48:16.779]  They're not refugees, they're not Syrian.
[00:48:16.779 --> 00:48:21.120]  That is the huge bulk of the quote refugees coming into Europe.
[00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:27.438]  Now Ivanka Trump is out on the Today Show saying that the US needs to open its borders.
[00:48:27.438 --> 00:48:30.643]  People are rightly concerned about this.
[00:48:30.643 --> 00:48:36.351]  Is she an outright globalist or is she just naive, misinformed, a bleeding-heart liberal?
[00:48:36.351 --> 00:48:37.453]  Well, she's been hanging out with
[00:48:38.214 --> 00:48:50.937]  Christine Lagarde, formerly of the IMF, and of course Angela Merkel, German Chancellor, who oversaw the importation of what is probably now up to 2 million migrants.
[00:48:50.937 --> 00:48:53.158]  And look at the problems that have taken place in Germany.
[00:48:53.158 --> 00:48:55.518]  We have sexual assaults on a regular basis.
[00:48:55.518 --> 00:48:58.759]  We had the Berlin truck attack just a few months ago.
[00:48:59.699 --> 00:49:02.201]  This is not what the American people voted for.
[00:49:02.201 --> 00:49:16.753]  And again, the policy of bombing the people in Syria who are fighting ISIS, which is what happened, what, about three, four weeks ago, again behind the scenes, supported by Ivanka Trump, that is not going to help the situation.
[00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:25.875]  If you actually look at the polls, and we've highlighted them before, 21% of Syrians support ISIS.
[00:49:25.875 --> 00:49:32.939]  It was an independent poll, they asked people in all these different Middle Eastern countries, 21% of Syrians support ISIS.
[00:49:32.939 --> 00:49:40.043]  So yes, you are going to get genuine refugees, genuine families fleeing from war, fleeing from ISIS persecution.
[00:49:40.984 --> 00:49:42.405]  But you're also going to get terrorists.
[00:49:42.405 --> 00:49:43.926]  And you've seen the pictures.
[00:49:43.926 --> 00:49:46.248]  You've seen the problems that have unfolded in Europe.
[00:49:46.248 --> 00:49:50.811]  It's not as simple as just opening the borders like Ivanka Trump says.
[00:49:50.811 --> 00:49:53.874]  What happened to extreme vetting?
[00:49:53.874 --> 00:49:55.315]  The travel ban got shut down.
[00:49:55.315 --> 00:49:56.816]  There you see the article study.
[00:49:56.816 --> 00:49:58.957]  21% of Syrians support ISIS.
[00:49:58.957 --> 00:50:02.400]  You scroll down, there's a poll there which you can zoom into.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.301]  Support for ISIS in Muslim countries.
[00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:05.202]  21% Syria.
[00:50:07.984 --> 00:50:09.967]  Now those are the people who admit it.
[00:50:09.967 --> 00:50:12.270]  It's probably even more than that.
[00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:17.416]  And so if you want to just have Syrian refugees coming in, well of course you need extreme vetting.
[00:50:17.416 --> 00:50:19.819]  But again, the American people didn't vote for that.
[00:50:19.819 --> 00:50:21.661]  You have Turkey on record.
[00:50:21.661 --> 00:50:26.748]  You have George Soros on record saying that they are using migrants as a weapon.
[00:50:28.012 --> 00:50:31.233]  Erdogan in Turkey has said it over and over and over again.
[00:50:31.233 --> 00:50:33.433]  So this is not the solution to the problem.
[00:50:33.433 --> 00:50:41.775]  The solution is to stop bombing the people who are fighting ISIS in Syria and to create safe zones within Syria.
[00:50:41.775 --> 00:50:47.236]  What is Ivanka Trump saying when she's calling for the US to just swing its borders wide open?
[00:50:47.236 --> 00:50:50.117]  That's not what Americans voted for.
[00:50:50.117 --> 00:50:52.257]  We'll be back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:52.257 --> 00:50:53.238]  Breaking news coming up.

[00:52:00.312 --> 00:52:06.794]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[00:52:06.794 --> 00:52:19.738]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[00:52:19.738 --> 00:52:23.079]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[00:52:23.379 --> 00:52:30.346]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[00:52:30.346 --> 00:52:43.178]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[00:52:43.178 --> 00:52:44.720]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:51.366]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[00:54:11.827 --> 00:54:19.189]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:19.189 --> 00:54:25.451]  We have Stefan Molyneux coming up in the next hour to talk about Ivanka Trump saying the U.S.
[00:54:25.451 --> 00:54:30.452]  should basically open its borders to Syrian refugees, or at least that should be part of the discussion.
[00:54:31.272 --> 00:54:33.534]  Wasn't part of the discussion during the campaign.
[00:54:33.534 --> 00:54:39.140]  It was obviously something that Donald Trump ran against after he was misinformed on it.
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:46.567]  Remember though, that clip a few months before the election campaign really picked up when he said, yeah, we should just let the refugees in.
[00:54:46.567 --> 00:54:47.908]  He was red-pilled on it.
[00:54:47.908 --> 00:54:51.872]  It appears as though Ivanka Trump has gone back on that or maybe she believed it.
[00:54:52.702 --> 00:55:04.089]  All along, and with the other worrying signs coming out of the Trump administration, which we're going to cover with Stefan Molyneux, people are concerned, and it's the elephant in the living room, so we're going to cover it.
[00:55:04.089 --> 00:55:12.675]  Doesn't mean we're supporting Hillary Clinton, doesn't mean we're not delighted that she's not the president, but we're going to talk about it, because it's out there.
[00:55:12.675 --> 00:55:14.256]  Many people are concerned about this.
[00:55:14.676 --> 00:55:20.242]  Before I get back into that news though, I want to tell you about DNA Force because it's back in stock.
[00:55:20.242 --> 00:55:24.086]  We have a limited supply available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:55:24.086 --> 00:55:29.071]  You've seen the attacks on InfoWars intensify over the past few weeks.
[00:55:29.071 --> 00:55:31.193]  Now we have DNA Force back in stock.
[00:55:31.193 --> 00:55:36.179]  Again, a way for you to support us as we battle on a daily basis against these people.
[00:55:36.639 --> 00:55:43.261]  Our highly advanced DNA Force formula has been sold out for months, but it's now back in a limited shipment.
[00:55:43.261 --> 00:55:44.481]  It's about to arrive.
[00:55:44.481 --> 00:55:46.562]  It's about to come through the door.
[00:55:46.562 --> 00:55:48.342]  Sign up for the waiting list.
[00:55:48.342 --> 00:55:50.323]  It's so hot you're going to have to get on the waiting list.
[00:55:50.323 --> 00:55:52.623]  We can't just release it all in one go.
[00:55:52.623 --> 00:55:58.705]  InfoWarsStore.com and be the first to know when DNA Force is back so you can get it before it sells out once again.
[00:55:59.873 --> 00:56:07.879]  It contains the powerful lineup of patented ingredients like the Coenzyme Q10, Systematic Enzymes, Bio-PQQ, and many others.
[00:56:07.879 --> 00:56:11.502]  4.8 out of 5 stars.
[00:56:11.502 --> 00:56:16.025]  That's the average on InfoWarsStore.com out of all the reviews.
[00:56:16.025 --> 00:56:17.727]  Power reviews.
[00:56:17.727 --> 00:56:20.729]  And we don't just put up the good reviews, we leave them all up.
[00:56:21.707 --> 00:56:23.748]  So, go and look at the average.
[00:56:23.748 --> 00:56:25.168]  4.8 out of 5.
[00:56:25.168 --> 00:56:27.469]  That is absolutely massive.
[00:56:27.469 --> 00:56:29.750]  People are really delighted with this product.
[00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:31.210]  What it's done for them.
[00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:34.031]  And it's going to be available, but only for a limited time.
[00:56:34.031 --> 00:56:35.372]  It is DNA Force.
[00:56:35.372 --> 00:56:36.472]  You see, it says out of stock.
[00:56:36.472 --> 00:56:37.953]  We're just about to get some more in.
[00:56:38.513 --> 00:56:43.297]  Click join the mailing list and you will be notified first before anyone else.
[00:56:43.297 --> 00:56:46.360]  You will be able to get this product while it lasts.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.302]  We have a featured review of the day.
[00:56:48.302 --> 00:56:54.728]  Speaking of those reviews, this time about Survival Shield X2, the nascent iodine.
[00:56:54.728 --> 00:56:56.329]  And it's from New York.
[00:56:56.329 --> 00:57:00.713]  I take Survival Shield X2 on a daily basis as part of my supplemental support system.
[00:57:01.547 --> 00:57:05.972]  Three drops a day, and the bottle feels like it lasts forever!
[00:57:05.972 --> 00:57:07.233]  Which is another good feature of it.
[00:57:07.233 --> 00:57:09.475]  It's incredibly concentrated.
[00:57:09.475 --> 00:57:13.699]  I had a very mild detox when I began, but quickly settled in.
[00:57:13.699 --> 00:57:17.844]  Great product, Alex, and InfoWars, and that's what a lot of people are saying.
[00:57:17.844 --> 00:57:22.689]  You get that detox to start off with, but then the benefits really start to take effect.
[00:57:22.689 --> 00:57:24.610]  That is Survival Shield X.
[00:57:25.231 --> 00:57:34.258]  Two, we also have the Mammoth 53% off Caveman True Paleo Formula for a limited time at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:34.258 --> 00:57:40.963]  That is the bone broth, the primal superfoods to help support healthy muscles, fight free radicals and so much more.
[00:57:41.804 --> 00:57:46.648]  The original Caveman Paleo Formula, 53% off!

[00:58:00.439 --> 00:58:10.588]  You can select 14 days, 30 days, different days on which it's delivered on a regular basis, so you don't have to deal with that hassle, and you get the Caveman True Paleo Formula.
[00:58:11.414 --> 00:58:12.655]  That's going to wrap it up for this segment.
[00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:15.877]  We're going to come back and cover some more news.
[00:58:15.877 --> 00:58:18.018]  Wolfowitz, you remember him?
[00:58:18.018 --> 00:58:19.399]  Well, now he's happy with Trump.
[00:58:19.399 --> 00:58:22.161]  We've had Lindsey Graham saying that he's delighted with Trump.
[00:58:22.161 --> 00:58:25.043]  He's the happiest dude in America.
[00:58:25.043 --> 00:58:30.566]  Well, now, neocon war hawk Paul Wolfowitz is making similar noises.
[00:58:30.566 --> 00:58:32.808]  How concerned should we be?
[00:58:32.808 --> 00:58:34.168]  We're going to talk about it after the break.
[00:58:34.168 --> 00:58:37.371]  It's the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.
[00:58:37.371 --> 00:58:37.871]  Don't go away.
[00:58:41.095 --> 00:58:44.627]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.627 --> 00:58:46.835]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[01:00:11.877 --> 01:00:16.788]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:00:16.788 --> 01:00:18.231]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.802 --> 01:00:30.625]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday edition from Austin, Texas.
[01:00:30.625 --> 01:00:33.987]  Stefan Molyneux is coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:33.987 --> 01:00:42.813]  We played the clip earlier, Ivanka Trump saying that resettling Syrian refugees, opening the borders to Syrian refugees needs to be part of the discussion.
[01:00:42.813 --> 01:00:46.536]  This is causing absolute huge concern amongst Trump's base.
[01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:52.380]  Bearing in mind she's been hanging out with Angela Merkel and Christine Lagarde of the IMF.
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:59.846]  Angela Merkel, the same woman who oversaw the disastrous policy of allowing up to 2 million migrants into Germany.
[01:00:59.846 --> 01:01:08.994]  Despite the fact that Merkel herself admitted on the record back in 2010 that multiculturalism has failed.
[01:01:08.994 --> 01:01:15.619]  There you see Ivanka Trump hanging out with two top globalists while advocating globalist policies.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:22.964]  Is anyone worried about this, given how close Ivanka Trump is to the White House, to Donald Trump?
[01:01:22.964 --> 01:01:25.225]  Now, of course, Trump is very impressionable.
[01:01:25.225 --> 01:01:28.387]  He takes advice from all sides.
[01:01:28.387 --> 01:01:36.552]  We need to continue giving him good advice, because he seems to be getting a lot of bad advice in recent weeks.
[01:01:36.552 --> 01:01:40.374]  Ivanka Trump also wrote an editorial in the Financial Times, you could probably find it.
[01:01:41.601 --> 01:01:44.863]  With the President of the World Bank Group.
[01:01:44.863 --> 01:02:02.515]  So she's hanging out with, you know, Presidents of the World Bank, Angela Merkel, Christine Lagarde, all top globalists, while advocating purely globalist policies, the same policies advocated by the likes of Peter Sutherland, as Alex talked about earlier, by the likes of George Soros.
[01:02:03.885 --> 01:02:05.466]  So that's the worst case scenario.
[01:02:05.466 --> 01:02:13.693]  The best case scenario is that she's just a bleeding-heart humanitarian and is, you know, completely misinformed about the migrant crisis.
[01:02:13.693 --> 01:02:17.736]  You can look at the ISIS-controlled areas of Syria and Iraq.
[01:02:17.736 --> 01:02:29.085]  Even at the peak of ISIS control a couple of years ago, which is now quickly waning, there were 3.7 million people living in those areas controlled by ISIS.
[01:02:29.986 --> 01:02:40.478]  So if you want to drill down into true refugees who are under bombardment, who are living in war, who are living under ISIS persecution, even at the height of that it was 3.7.
[01:02:40.478 --> 01:02:44.642]  Now they're saying that ISIS has lost basically half or more of its territory.
[01:02:44.642 --> 01:02:46.544]  So even to be generous you're talking about
[01:02:47.185 --> 01:02:52.647]  You know, about two million people who in Syria and Iraq are still living under ISIS persecution.
[01:02:52.647 --> 01:02:54.828]  And that's horrific, that's terrible.
[01:02:54.828 --> 01:03:02.052]  We should do everything we can to help them by creating those safe zones, by donating vast amounts of money, doing everything we can.
[01:03:02.052 --> 01:03:13.197]  But again, if you take that number, two million actual refugees, Germany has taken in almost that number alone on its own already in the past two years.
[01:03:14.346 --> 01:03:19.431]  So we can already accommodate the actual refugees, that's not who's coming in.
[01:03:19.431 --> 01:03:25.997]  The UN numbers show that it's 75% plus, probably even higher now, are not Syrian.
[01:03:25.997 --> 01:03:30.661]  Again, 75% plus are men, they're not women and children.
[01:03:30.661 --> 01:03:34.665]  You can go to the Calais migrant camp, which reporters have gone to it and noted,
[01:03:35.606 --> 01:03:37.490]  Basically no children.
[01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:38.953]  They're from Eritrea.
[01:03:38.953 --> 01:03:42.000]  They're from all these different countries, none of which are Syria.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.986]  Tiny amount of these refugees are actually from Syria.
[01:03:46.383 --> 01:03:48.283]  And again, George Soros has gone on record.
[01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:54.905]  Turkey's Erdogan has gone on record and says that, you know, we're going to use these as a weapon if you don't let Turkey in the EU, for example.
[01:03:54.905 --> 01:03:57.886]  We're going to continue to use these migrants as a weapon.
[01:03:57.886 --> 01:04:07.308]  They're not being resettled in the rich Gulf state countries that are close to Syria, that have the same culture, that speak the same language.
[01:04:07.308 --> 01:04:10.949]  Those countries are taking in precisely zero Syrian refugees.
[01:04:11.849 --> 01:04:19.238]  So why should the burden be on America, given that this whole refugee problem has been completely mischaracterized?
[01:04:19.238 --> 01:04:24.845]  The vast majority of these people are not refugees, they're economic migrants.
[01:04:24.845 --> 01:04:26.487]  So if you want to make a different argument,
[01:04:27.168 --> 01:04:32.235]  Just allowing the entire third world to move to the west then fine, but that's a completely different argument.
[01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:41.668]  To couch it in terms of humanitarianism is fundamentally dishonest because again the vast majority of these people coming in are not refugees.
[01:04:42.429 --> 01:04:54.339]  And you would think at some level Ivanka Trump understood that, so why is she now advocating for it, given the huge problems, crime, terrorism, that have occurred in Europe over the past two years?
[01:04:54.339 --> 01:04:57.441]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live with Stefan Molyneux.
[01:04:57.441 --> 01:04:57.962]  Don't go away.
[01:05:01.556 --> 01:05:15.387]  Google wants to save you from fake news, and they are rewriting their algorithm to bury misleading, false, and offensive news articles.
[01:05:15.387 --> 01:05:25.775]  Google's parent company, Alphabet Incorporated, recently announced a rare sweeping change to its search function, and they have already declared InfoWars
[01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:28.077]  As untrustworthy.
[01:05:28.077 --> 01:05:44.250]  Google claims the new changes are in response to the fake news outbreak of 2016 when the Russians infiltrated alternative and social media to defeat Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump win the presidential election.
[01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:51.677]  So far it remains unclear how the state of California was immune to the Russians' propaganda.
[01:05:52.117 --> 01:06:00.801]  I'm Darren McBrain and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:00.801 --> 01:06:06.284]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:06.284 --> 01:06:08.365]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:06:08.365 --> 01:06:13.667]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:06:13.667 --> 01:06:17.409]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[01:06:17.509 --> 01:06:20.951]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:06:20.951 --> 01:06:24.134]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:06:24.134 --> 01:06:28.016]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:06:28.016 --> 01:06:35.181]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:06:35.181 --> 01:06:40.585]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[01:06:40.725 --> 01:06:41.586]  We're good to go.
[01:07:00.586 --> 01:07:04.588]  A new shipment of BioTrue Selenium is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:04.588 --> 01:07:06.069]  We've been sold out for months.
[01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:11.131]  Our one-of-a-kind InfoWarsLife BioTrue Selenium formula is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:11.131 --> 01:07:15.293]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[01:07:15.293 --> 01:07:19.816]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[01:07:19.816 --> 01:07:23.017]  But BioTrue Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[01:07:24.938 --> 01:07:28.421]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[01:07:28.421 --> 01:07:32.584]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[01:07:32.584 --> 01:07:40.670]  BioTruth Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield X2 Basin Iodine as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:45.573]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTruth Selenium before we sell it again.
[01:07:45.573 --> 01:07:53.359]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help yourself and your family but also fund our operation against the globalists.
[01:07:53.359 --> 01:07:53.619]  A 360 win.
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:56.681]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[01:07:56.681 --> 01:07:58.202]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[01:07:58.202 --> 01:08:02.325]  That's InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:08:02.325 --> 01:08:05.126]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[01:08:05.126 --> 01:08:10.310]  Broke my leg in the Santa Fe.
[01:08:10.310 --> 01:08:16.373]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[01:08:16.373 --> 01:08:19.435]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[01:08:19.435 --> 01:08:22.297]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that
[01:08:29.025 --> 01:08:43.416]  It's Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones live on the Alex Jones Show this Wednesday April 26th edition and we're joined live by the one and only Stefan Molyneux of freedomainradio.com.
[01:08:43.416 --> 01:08:44.397]  Stefan, welcome back!
[01:08:45.253 --> 01:08:47.115]  Thanks Paul, great to be here, how you doing?
[01:08:47.115 --> 01:08:50.178]  Good, now I just want to get into some of this Trump news just to start off with.
[01:08:50.178 --> 01:09:02.431]  Obviously we're going to get onto the French election, that's going to be the bulk of the discussion, but Ivanka Trump, we played the clip earlier, actually if you can queue that clip up again that would be illustrative for this part of the discussion.
[01:09:02.431 --> 01:09:07.317]  Let's roll the clip, this is Ivanka Trump on the Today Show talking about refugees.
[01:09:08.422 --> 01:09:08.962]  I think there is...
[01:09:27.594 --> 01:09:34.002]  A global humanitarian crisis that's happening, and we have to come together, and we have to solve it.
[01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:38.388]  And, you know... Does that include opening the borders to Syrian refugees in the U.S.?
[01:09:38.388 --> 01:09:41.733]  That has to be part of the discussion, but that's not going to be enough in and of itself.
[01:09:42.728 --> 01:09:50.095]  Now, Stefan, Ivanka Trump, she's meeting with Lagarde, she's meeting with Angela Merkel, top globalist.
[01:09:50.095 --> 01:09:54.639]  Merkel, of course, pioneered the disastrous migrant policy in Germany.
[01:09:54.639 --> 01:09:59.704]  She's writing editorials in the Financial Times with the President of the World Bank.
[01:09:59.704 --> 01:10:04.208]  She's calling now for the US to take in refugees.
[01:10:04.208 --> 01:10:08.372]  Stefan, correct me if I'm wrong, that doesn't sound very America-thirsty, does it?
[01:10:09.699 --> 01:10:12.061]  Well, I mean, there's a lot behind it, of course, Paul.
[01:10:12.061 --> 01:10:22.292]  I mean, if it is a humanitarian crisis of the first order, then it is the result of the government program called arms sales, called arming ISIS, called meddling in the Middle East, called regime change.
[01:10:22.292 --> 01:10:31.461]  Just another example of how one disastrous program called regime change leads to another disastrous program called immigration, bottomless immigration from the third world.
[01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:33.602]  Is there a humanitarian crisis?
[01:10:33.602 --> 01:10:34.242]  Of course there is!
[01:10:34.242 --> 01:10:36.683]  For some of the Syrians, there is a huge problem.
[01:10:36.683 --> 01:10:42.085]  And the best thing to do, if you care about this crisis, is to resettle them in the Middle East.
[01:10:42.085 --> 01:10:43.586]  The cost is very, very clear.
[01:10:43.586 --> 01:10:50.249]  If you want to help 10,000 refugees, if you want to help them in the Middle East, you can resettle them for 10.6 million US dollars.
[01:10:50.249 --> 01:10:55.311]  If you want to bring them to America, it's going to cost you 128.7 million dollars.
[01:10:55.311 --> 01:11:00.153]  It is 12 plus times the cost to bring these supposed refugees, if in fact,
[01:11:00.393 --> 01:11:03.056]  That's what they are, to America to resettle them.
[01:11:03.056 --> 01:11:12.506]  If you actually want to help these people, then stop doing regime changes in the Middle East, help them resettle in the Middle East, where they have a much greater chance of success in the long run.
[01:11:12.506 --> 01:11:21.736]  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm right in saying that the majority of these migrant refugees are illiterate in their own language, never mind English, that's right, correct?
[01:11:22.901 --> 01:11:28.284]  Well, two-thirds of the Syrian refugees who reach Europe are illiterate in their own language.
[01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:34.668]  And recently, I think it was in Italy, Paul, they did a scan of the people pouring in across the boats, right?
[01:11:34.668 --> 01:11:47.815]  There's a lot of NGOs who set up this kind of Uber from hell ferry service to bring people from North Africa into Europe, which is exactly what Qaddafi warned about if he was going to be ousted by the Obama Hillary Clinton.
[01:11:48.195 --> 01:11:48.575]  I think?
[01:12:05.203 --> 01:12:16.389]  Significantly overpopulated Africa, which has partly resulted from massive amounts of food aid and other kinds of foreign aid that's been showered on the continent, setting off, you know, massive birth rates in an overpopulation crisis.
[01:12:16.389 --> 01:12:18.990]  And so again, we have this whole series of dominoes.
[01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:25.854]  Ill-thought-out, virtue-signaling, nonsense, destructive government programs just lead to more and more and more disastrous.
[01:12:25.854 --> 01:12:33.818]  And I don't think that the Trump administration is going to take all this very seriously, but it is not very comforting to hear this kind of talk going on.
[01:12:34.326 --> 01:12:49.338]  There was a report, I think it was out of Breitbart a few weeks ago, that showed that in a period of time since Trump, you know, got into the White House, the pace of refugees coming into America had doubled in comparison with the same time period under Obama.
[01:12:49.338 --> 01:12:50.659]  So that is of massive concern.
[01:12:50.659 --> 01:12:52.361]  The travel ban got shut down.
[01:12:52.361 --> 01:12:59.267]  The figures I were looking at earlier showed that, you know, even at the height of ISIS's control of territory in Iraq and Syria,
[01:12:59.887 --> 01:13:06.492]  They had about 3.7 million people living under them, of course under ISIS persecution.
[01:13:06.492 --> 01:13:08.734]  Now they've lost more than half of their territory.
[01:13:08.734 --> 01:13:12.056]  It's more like, to be generous, 2 million people.
[01:13:12.056 --> 01:13:16.499]  You know, Germany has already taken in almost 2 million people in the last two years.
[01:13:16.499 --> 01:13:18.981]  Those are actual refugees, which of course we can...
[01:13:20.382 --> 01:13:27.105]  Counter the idea that it's a good idea to bring them in in the first place with the illiteracy, with the problems with integration.
[01:13:27.105 --> 01:13:31.647]  But I mean, two million people, the people coming into Europe are not Syrian refugees.
[01:13:31.647 --> 01:13:33.647]  We've tried to make that point over and over again.
[01:13:33.647 --> 01:13:40.070]  Do you think people like Ivanka Trump, who are advising the president, and he's very impressionable, do you think
[01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:44.514]  As you said, they're just doing this out of virtue, signalling out of naivety.
[01:13:44.514 --> 01:13:53.201]  Or is this part of the concern that some people have got that neocons globalists are increasingly surrounding Trump and that the swamp is draining him?
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:55.761]  Well, that's a good question.
[01:13:55.761 --> 01:14:17.322]  Whether it is misguided altruism, that they want to do the right thing, they want to help people, or whether it is part of some sinister, destabilized Western civilization plan, I gotta tell you, I mean, initially I was like, well, it's well-meaning people, but, you know, they just don't have the facts, they just don't have all the data, they just don't understand the consequences of what they're advocating.
[01:14:17.962 --> 01:14:31.747]  But I tell you, Paul, since the information has been escalating and the disasters of this non-integration have been accumulating, it's really, really hard to ascribe these kinds of disastrous decisions and policies to mere naivete.
[01:14:31.747 --> 01:14:40.650]  When you see, of course, as we've talked about before, in France the second generation of Muslim immigrants tends to be more radicalized than the first generation.
[01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:40.930]  When you
[01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:46.252]  See this massive increase in migrant crime over 50% year over year in Germany.
[01:14:46.252 --> 01:14:56.597]  When you start to see the emergence of a genuine rape culture in Sweden, it's really, really hard to continue to say, well, they're just misguided because the facts are very, very clear.
[01:14:56.597 --> 01:14:58.858]  The challenges and the failures are very, very clear.
[01:14:58.858 --> 01:15:03.881]  So people who are continuing down this road, I'm beginning less and less to believe in any kind of purity of motive.
[01:15:04.878 --> 01:15:07.259]  Let's flash this headline up and I'll read part of it.
[01:15:07.259 --> 01:15:09.300]  This is out of Information Liberation.
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:13.241]  Neocon Paul Wolfowitz speaking privately with McMaster and Mattis.
[01:15:13.241 --> 01:15:20.584]  The article states, Neocon Paul Wolfowitz is now optimistic about President Trump and privately emailing H.R.
[01:15:20.584 --> 01:15:23.345]  McMaster and James Mattis to whore for more wars.
[01:15:23.345 --> 01:15:26.226]  That's the commentary in the article in the Middle East.
[01:15:26.226 --> 01:15:28.227]  We have a never-Trumper.
[01:15:28.227 --> 01:15:30.828]  Helen Ferry is now part of the White House.
[01:15:30.828 --> 01:15:33.009]  That came out in a Breitbart article this morning.
[01:15:33.689 --> 01:15:37.791]  We have Wolfowitz speaking privately with Mattis, with McMaster.
[01:15:37.791 --> 01:15:41.613]  We have Lindsey Graham saying he's the happiest dude ever.
[01:15:41.613 --> 01:15:46.416]  Stefan, this 4D chess game's really getting quite convoluted, isn't it?
[01:15:47.791 --> 01:15:55.233]  Well, I'm going to suggest that it's a marathon, not a sprint, which is kind of a cliche to say, but I think people need to remember that.
[01:15:55.233 --> 01:16:01.034]  There was no question in anyone's mind who studied this matter in any depth that the deep state was going to fight back.
[01:16:01.034 --> 01:16:10.496]  They weren't going to just roll over and say, well, you know, he got a whole bunch of electoral college votes, so let's just hand up over this drug called power and all of this money and all of this deference and all of this
[01:16:11.196 --> 01:16:11.977]  We're good to go.
[01:16:37.012 --> 01:16:45.430]  Then I'm going right back to abstract philosophy because political action will have proven itself to be thoroughly useless in practice and then we just have to hunker down and wait for the crash.
[01:16:46.385 --> 01:16:49.546]  And again, the point I make is, you know, Trump is very impressionable.
[01:16:49.546 --> 01:16:56.369]  He has different circles of people that surround him at different times, giving him different advice.
[01:16:56.369 --> 01:16:59.130]  You know, the deportations have increased, that's a positive.
[01:16:59.130 --> 01:17:01.111]  We do need to celebrate the positives.
[01:17:01.111 --> 01:17:03.332]  The wall seems like it's being delayed.
[01:17:03.332 --> 01:17:05.072]  But again, he's impressionable.
[01:17:05.072 --> 01:17:09.934]  We're not abandoning him, but by the same token, we're not being sycophants.
[01:17:09.934 --> 01:17:13.476]  It's credible and we maintain our credibility and our consistency.
[01:17:14.096 --> 01:17:25.781]  If we question him on these issues, like, if you send 59 Tomahawk missiles into Syria to help the people who are fighting ISIS, that's a policy I've opposed for, what, five, six years now.
[01:17:25.781 --> 01:17:27.782]  I'm still going to oppose that policy.
[01:17:27.782 --> 01:17:32.824]  I'm not going to just suddenly do a 180 just because, you know, Donald Trump's behind it.
[01:17:32.824 --> 01:17:36.105]  And that's your position, I guess, right, Stefan?
[01:17:36.105 --> 01:17:41.508]  Well, if I sort of were to look at this sort of global chess master move, Paul, I would say something like the following.
[01:17:42.532 --> 01:17:46.653]  The refugees are refugees because they want to go back.
[01:17:46.653 --> 01:17:53.536]  That's sort of the theory, that you escape when your house is on fire to a motel, and then when your house is rebuilt, you move back on.
[01:17:53.536 --> 01:18:11.822]  Whatever can contribute to any kind of political stability in Syria, in particular, also in Libya and other countries that have been smashed by leftists and globalists, whatever can contribute to that stability, whatever, in a sense, noses we have to hold in order to support somebody who can bring political stability to that region, then we find out.
[01:18:12.182 --> 01:18:18.785]  Whether it's refugees or economic migrants who are there to invade and potentially take over the culture, that's when we find out.
[01:18:18.785 --> 01:18:28.369]  Because if Syria is stabilized under Assad, which seems like the only reasonable approach at the moment, if Syria is stabilized, then of course what can happen is we can say, okay, house is out.
[01:18:29.049 --> 01:18:29.970]  Out of fire.
[01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:30.671]  Fire's out.
[01:18:30.671 --> 01:18:32.072]  House has been rebuilt.
[01:18:32.072 --> 01:18:32.873]  Off you go back.
[01:18:32.873 --> 01:18:41.081]  Now, if they're like, woof, thank you for putting us up while our house was on fire, we'd love to go back home, then I guess we can look at it one way.
[01:18:41.081 --> 01:18:48.347]  If, however, they vanish into the no-go zones and don't show up to go back home, then we can start to look at it quite another way.
[01:18:48.347 --> 01:18:54.293]  And it is actually my prediction that should stability come to Syria, it will be the latter that will happen to a lot of these migrants in Europe.
[01:18:55.629 --> 01:18:57.011]  Now I want to move on to France.
[01:18:57.011 --> 01:18:59.354]  Of course we had the big election on Sunday.
[01:18:59.354 --> 01:19:02.597]  We've got the second round coming up on May the 7th.
[01:19:02.597 --> 01:19:10.787]  The polls show that Marine Le Pen has basically got a mountain to climb to come back against Macron and overturn that deficit.
[01:19:11.528 --> 01:19:15.111]  Um, actually, we're gonna get into that after the break because we're running out of time on this segment.
[01:19:15.111 --> 01:19:32.364]  We're gonna go to a clip after the break where Macron visits, I think it's a warehouse or a factory, and within about 30 seconds he is absolutely pelted with cackles and boos and Marine Le Pen visits the same factory, I believe, or a different factory, but, you know, similar circumstance, big press scrum around her.
[01:19:33.044 --> 01:19:38.328]  Workers at the factory and the reaction to Marine Le Pen is quite different indeed.
[01:19:38.328 --> 01:19:44.412]  So we're going to play that clip after the break and go back to Stefan Molyneux of freedomainradio.com.
[01:19:44.412 --> 01:19:46.734]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[01:19:46.734 --> 01:19:49.296]  Breaking news at infowars.com.
[01:19:49.296 --> 01:19:50.356]  We'll be back.
[01:19:50.356 --> 01:19:50.897]  Don't go away.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.301]  Maybe not today.
[01:20:02.301 --> 01:20:03.601]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:20:03.601 --> 01:20:07.322]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:20:07.322 --> 01:20:08.423]  Forget bunkers.
[01:20:08.423 --> 01:20:10.243]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:20:10.243 --> 01:20:11.964]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:31.831]  It's called the Deep State.
[01:20:31.831 --> 01:20:36.614]  Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they want to stop President Trump.
[01:20:36.614 --> 01:20:40.696]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[01:20:40.696 --> 01:20:46.299]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.
[01:20:46.299 --> 01:20:50.622]  Newsmax, Lou Dobbs, Ann Coulter all say you must read Big Agenda.
[01:20:50.802 --> 01:20:51.243]  I think so.
[01:21:09.722 --> 01:21:20.887]  InfoWarsLife has set out to bring you formulations that are not only the highest quality out there, but formulas that you can use on a daily basis to give your body the natural herbs and extracts that our experts recommend.

[01:21:34.353 --> 01:21:35.113]  I'm good.
[01:21:59.778 --> 01:22:05.362]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's, in an epic battle of David versus Goliath.
[01:22:05.362 --> 01:22:07.744]  In the early 1980s, a child was born.
[01:22:07.744 --> 01:22:08.685]  Two of them, actually.
[01:22:08.685 --> 01:22:10.746]  Their names were Jeff and Andy.
[01:22:10.746 --> 01:22:15.089]  Time went by, they developed facial hair, and one day, something happened.
[01:22:15.089 --> 01:22:17.191]  Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors.
[01:22:17.671 --> 01:22:21.612]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all.
[01:22:21.612 --> 01:22:30.514]  They hired the best designers, they bought a 95-year-old German blade factory, and they started selling high-quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers.
[01:22:30.514 --> 01:22:32.854]  How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[01:22:32.854 --> 01:22:35.075]  By threatening to sue their pants off.
[01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:40.476]  Don't worry, Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to give all guys a great shave at a great price.
[01:22:41.216 --> 01:22:42.537]  Try Harry's free.

[01:22:59.564 --> 01:23:01.505]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:23:01.505 --> 01:23:06.829]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:23:06.829 --> 01:23:08.410]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:16.755]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:23:16.755 --> 01:23:22.459]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:23:22.619 --> 01:23:24.460]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:26.720]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:31.122]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:23:31.122 --> 01:23:33.302]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[01:23:33.302 --> 01:23:41.045]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:23:41.445 --> 01:23:42.006]  We're good to go.

[01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:15.410]  The media are waiting!

[01:24:37.079 --> 01:24:37.739]  The media are waiting!
[01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:38.279]  The media are waiting!
[01:24:38.279 --> 01:24:38.879]  The media are waiting!

[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:40.100]  The media are waiting!
[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:40.640]  The media are waiting!
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:50.684]  Those boos and whistles you heard in that clip were coming from workers at a Whirlpool factory in France, which was visited by the French presidential frontrunner Emmanuel Macron.
[01:24:50.684 --> 01:24:51.564]  You can cut that clip now.
[01:25:09.031 --> 01:25:12.193]  What's interesting about this is Marine Le Pen basically trolled him.
[01:25:12.193 --> 01:25:15.114]  She turned up at the same factory.
[01:25:15.114 --> 01:25:16.395]  All the workers rushed to her.
[01:25:16.395 --> 01:25:18.656]  They were all rushing around in adoration.
[01:25:18.656 --> 01:25:21.717]  You can see the photo if you scroll down the Westmonster article.
[01:25:21.717 --> 01:25:25.839]  French workers cheer Le Pen, heckle Macron.
[01:25:25.839 --> 01:25:29.201]  So he got absolute dog's abuse as soon as he arrived.
[01:25:29.201 --> 01:25:31.242]  Marine Le Pen got worshipped, basically.
[01:25:31.242 --> 01:25:33.763]  And this really crystallizes it for me, Stefan.
[01:25:33.763 --> 01:25:35.464]  You know, I read an article yesterday.
[01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:36.365]  I think it was The Telegraph.
[01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:42.747]  They were still billing Macron as a, quote, maverick outsider.
[01:25:42.747 --> 01:25:53.112]  You know, Stefan, how many people in the real world, how many maverick outsiders emerge from within a ruling bureaucracy having had their campaigns bankrolled by Rothschild and company?
[01:25:54.352 --> 01:25:58.893]  You can always tell an outsider by how often they've attended a Bilderberg conference.
[01:25:58.893 --> 01:26:01.033]  A Bilderberg conference, that is the way it goes.
[01:26:01.033 --> 01:26:02.754]  He is a vanity hologram.
[01:26:02.754 --> 01:26:04.834]  He's like Barack O'Blander.
[01:26:04.834 --> 01:26:08.295]  Because what he did, he's a marketing ghost.
[01:26:08.295 --> 01:26:09.355]  He's a Chauncey Gardner.
[01:26:09.355 --> 01:26:14.836]  Because before he announced his candidacy, this is taking his cue from the Obama campaign in 2008.
[01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:15.856]  What did he do?
[01:26:15.856 --> 01:26:18.457]  Well, he had a whole bunch of French voters surveyed.
[01:26:18.757 --> 01:26:27.984]  Twenty-five thousand, pretty in-depth interviews, and figured out exactly what they wanted, which cliches would wrestle the vote from their stony hearts.
[01:26:27.984 --> 01:26:29.505]  And so that's exactly what he did.
[01:26:29.505 --> 01:26:35.970]  He got all of this marketing material out there, he got all of what the voters want to hear, and he produces a ridiculously convoluted insult.
[01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:40.732]  Well, self-complicating, self-contradicting kind of campaign.
[01:26:40.732 --> 01:26:44.194]  And nobody knows what he's all about, because he's just this vanity mirror.
[01:26:44.194 --> 01:26:51.098]  According to a recent survey, only 31% of French voters have any kind of clear idea of what Macron is going to do when he gets office.
[01:26:51.098 --> 01:26:53.559]  And that's far below his rivals.
[01:26:53.559 --> 01:26:55.540]  And what is he going to do?
[01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:57.661]  Oh, he's going to cut taxes.
[01:26:57.661 --> 01:27:00.462]  But he's also going to increase spending on unemployment.
[01:27:00.462 --> 01:27:03.164]  And there's going to be a lot of spending on public infrastructure.
[01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:06.828]  And he's going to shift to renewable energy and so on.
[01:27:06.828 --> 01:27:14.376]  So yes, a lot more spending, but he's going to cut taxes, and I'm going to tell you whatever you want to hear, and I'm kind of pretty, and I have a skeletor for a wife.
[01:27:14.376 --> 01:27:22.385]  So how that adds up to a compelling candidate, one can only say, good job French public schools, you have completely stripped any critical thinking from your subjects.
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:25.742]  And with the renewable energy thing, they tried that in Spain.
[01:27:25.742 --> 01:27:27.844]  It was an absolute disaster!
[01:27:27.844 --> 01:27:32.949]  Youth unemployment shot through the roof, and that's one of the main reasons why young people are voting for Le Pen.
[01:27:32.949 --> 01:27:43.418]  They've got a 25% youth unemployment rate, and yet Macron, on the same token, says that, you know, immigration is desperately needed to keep the economy vibrant.
[01:27:43.418 --> 01:27:48.923]  How vibrant do you think that 25% youth unemployed feel about their economic future?
[01:27:49.784 --> 01:27:55.110]  Well, especially do migrants and especially if they're coming in from lower-rent districts in Africa.
[01:27:55.110 --> 01:28:01.918]  There's just no way in any conceivable time frame that they're going to be net contributors to the French economy as a whole.
[01:28:01.918 --> 01:28:03.159]  That is completely insane.
[01:28:03.159 --> 01:28:04.461]  Something's happened in the West, Paul.
[01:28:04.701 --> 01:28:06.002]  Completely incomprehensible.
[01:28:06.002 --> 01:28:08.123]  Like we've given up on the idea of just having babies.
[01:28:08.123 --> 01:28:10.505]  What's wrong with having sex and having babies?
[01:28:10.505 --> 01:28:13.927]  I believe the French are fairly proficient in the first part of that equation, at least.
[01:28:13.927 --> 01:28:15.148]  What's wrong with just having babies?
[01:28:15.148 --> 01:28:23.553]  Well, of course, what's wrong with having babies for the politicians, Paul, is that babies cost politicians money and don't give them instant leftist voting patterns, right?
[01:28:23.553 --> 01:28:30.698]  So, of course, immigrants, particularly from the third world, reliably vote for the left, which is why they constantly want to be drawn in by the left.
[01:28:31.158 --> 01:28:41.222]  And of course they can conceivably at least start contributing taxes if not votes, but if you have children, well you've got to supply them with education and health care and people need bigger houses and so on.
[01:28:41.222 --> 01:28:45.724]  So that costs politicians money and they only start paying taxes in about a quarter century or so.
[01:28:45.724 --> 01:28:53.167]  So what politician well worth his salt in vote buying in the here and now wants to wait a quarter century for a more babies policy to pay off with additional taxes?
[01:28:53.767 --> 01:29:03.233]  So this is part of the whole decline of the greed of the baby boomers who wanted everything for nothing and now we're all paying the price in potential collective cultural catastrophe.
[01:29:04.264 --> 01:29:09.128]  And on that same subject, and we're going to get more into this after the break, the immigration aspect of it.
[01:29:09.128 --> 01:29:21.236]  Six months after this guy ran down, mowed down 86 people, killed 86, injured over 400 in Nice, Macron came out and said that Europeans, quote, must get used to mass immigration.
[01:29:21.236 --> 01:29:24.859]  He did it again after the police officer was gunned down in Paris.
[01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:28.882]  He said police, uh, French people had to learn to live with terrorism.
[01:29:28.882 --> 01:29:30.063]  It seems there's some kind of a
[01:29:30.743 --> 01:29:39.150]  National psyche that dominates France, which is still based around total capitulation, given the current poll numbers, if we're to believe them.
[01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:44.374]  We'll get back into it more with Stefan Molyneux, freedomainradio.com, after the break.
[01:29:44.374 --> 01:29:47.156]  Also, Alex Jones will call in live.
[01:29:47.156 --> 01:29:49.878]  Don't go away, we'll be back.
[01:29:49.878 --> 01:29:53.821]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:56.503]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.988 --> 01:30:08.156]  North Korea continues to threaten the United States, this time saying they are ready to sink the U.S.
[01:30:08.156 --> 01:30:11.959]  aircraft carrier Carl Vinson with a single strike.
[01:30:11.959 --> 01:30:20.969]  They also claim that their military has the ability to reach the continental United States, and they are now in possession of a massive hydrogen bomb.
[01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:31.577]  Meanwhile, the White House held an emergency meeting over North Korea that included a phone call between President Trump and China over the escalating tensions in the region.
[01:30:31.577 --> 01:30:36.501]  And China says World War III is inevitable as North Korea prepares
[01:30:36.821 --> 01:30:37.622]  We're good to go.
[01:31:00.658 --> 01:31:02.539]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:31:02.539 --> 01:31:04.560]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.482]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:31:07.482 --> 01:31:13.545]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:31:13.545 --> 01:31:22.730]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:31:22.730 --> 01:31:27.593]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[01:31:27.813 --> 01:31:30.257]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:31:30.257 --> 01:31:38.291]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:31:38.291 --> 01:31:39.272]  The general public doesn't.
[01:31:40.473 --> 01:31:44.396]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:31:44.396 --> 01:31:47.979]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:31:47.979 --> 01:31:54.704]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:31:54.704 --> 01:31:58.787]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4wrestore.com.
[01:32:00.942 --> 01:32:08.927]  InfoWars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:08.927 --> 01:32:15.571]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[01:32:15.571 --> 01:32:23.856]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[01:32:24.136 --> 01:32:33.148]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[01:32:33.148 --> 01:32:38.896]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:32:39.236 --> 01:32:39.997]  It works!
[01:32:39.997 --> 01:32:48.322]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[01:32:48.322 --> 01:32:58.209]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the Globalists all at the same time.
[01:32:58.209 --> 01:32:58.729]  A total 360 win!
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.901]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[01:33:07.901 --> 01:33:14.225]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.225 --> 01:33:17.947]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:26.623]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show, talking to Stefan Molyneux of FreedomAimRadio.com.
[01:33:26.623 --> 01:33:38.091]  Of course, he's got the biggest philosophy show on YouTube, before they shut it down, as they're trying to do with everyone else's channel at the moment, and demonetization, which we're also going to dig into later on.
[01:33:39.031 --> 01:33:42.692]  Stefan, I was just mentioning before the break, again, the immigration issue.
[01:33:42.692 --> 01:33:47.294]  We have six jihadist attacks in Paris alone in the last three years.
[01:33:47.294 --> 01:33:52.135]  You know, 21 jihadist attacks in France since Charlie Hebdo.
[01:33:52.135 --> 01:34:03.098]  Yet, Manuel Valls, the Prime Minister of France, and Macron himself, on numerous occasions, have come out time and time again and said, this is something that we have to live with.
[01:34:03.098 --> 01:34:07.680]  Do you think it's, you know, part of the psyche, the national psyche of the French people
[01:34:09.173 --> 01:34:17.340]  That is, you know, centred around submission and capitulation, given their history, or is that just something that's specific to the left as a whole?
[01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:24.686]  This kind of Stockholm Syndrome, stick your head in the sand, identify with your captors, and just hope that it's all going to go away.
[01:34:26.471 --> 01:34:36.859]  Well, I mean, it has a whole history in French philosophy and across studied philosophy, which of course is very, very impressive to people not in France, although fairly common to France.
[01:34:36.859 --> 01:34:46.185]  And what's happened, of course, is that the left has dominated higher education and the media for, you know, at least 30 to 50 years in various Western countries.
[01:34:46.185 --> 01:34:47.907]  Now, 50 years ago, it was the left
[01:34:48.487 --> 01:34:50.608]  Who were very, very big on nationalism.
[01:34:50.608 --> 01:34:53.709]  Very, very big on national self-determination.
[01:34:53.709 --> 01:34:54.850]  In the third world!
[01:34:54.850 --> 01:35:03.934]  Because it was really, really bad to have all of these western powers in there dominating and bleeding dry the resources against the will of the people of those people in the third world.
[01:35:03.934 --> 01:35:08.076]  And they loved, you know, Sukarno, Cabral, Ho Chi Minh, and all these kinds of people.
[01:35:08.076 --> 01:35:09.537]  Because they were fighting to liberate.
[01:35:10.197 --> 01:35:14.841]  Their countries from external control and influence them to be nationalistic and patriotic.
[01:35:14.841 --> 01:35:16.963]  Now it's completely reversed.
[01:35:16.963 --> 01:35:36.799]  Now any country in Europe that wants to get out from under the globalism of the EU is called far-right because that's just a negative Nazi brand that you can attach to anyone, although Le Pen certainly economically is significantly left, but she's on the quote far-right as far as she respects the idea of nationalism and patriotism and has a respect
[01:35:37.299 --> 01:35:39.660]  For the domestic historical French culture.
[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:45.082]  So the left, of course, nobody seems to notice these serpentine twists and turns of leftist justifications.
[01:35:45.082 --> 01:35:56.087]  When Western countries go to third world countries and strip mine resources against the will of the domestic population, that's colonialism, that's exploitation, that's really bad, and the way to fight it is with nationalism.
[01:35:56.087 --> 01:36:05.971]  When third worlders come to Western countries and strip mine state resources against the will of the population through the welfare state, well that's multiculturalism and that's very positive and anyone who argues against it
[01:36:06.551 --> 01:36:10.173]  Is a bad, fascist, Nazi, racist, blah blah blah, whatever, right?
[01:36:10.173 --> 01:36:15.937]  These hypocrisies, at some point we're going to have to pick up on these twists and turns and fight back intellectually against this nonsense.
[01:36:16.638 --> 01:36:19.320]  And some countries are further along than others.
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:27.706]  I think her decision to step down as National Front Leader before this final round is part of that effort to, you know, detoxify the brand.
[01:36:27.706 --> 01:36:36.032]  The problem is, from what I hear, her father, who of course represents some of the worst aspects of the brand, he's set to give a speech on Sunday.
[01:36:36.032 --> 01:36:39.935]  That is not going to help her campaign, so we'll wait to see if that comes off.
[01:36:39.935 --> 01:36:42.336]  But another thing that you tweeted about yesterday, I think,
[01:36:43.197 --> 01:36:48.321]  Which was this bizarre relationship between Emmanuel Macron and his wife.
[01:36:48.321 --> 01:36:56.588]  You tweeted, quote, 15-year-old Emmanuel Macron kissing his 40-year-old married drama teacher, who later divorced and married him.
[01:36:56.588 --> 01:37:08.699]  Now, you know, Stefan, I understand that age gaps in relationships are perfectly natural and, you know, they can work within reasonable bounds, but a 25-year age gap, what does that tell us about Macron?
[01:37:09.733 --> 01:37:19.519]  Well, before everyone reacts with this, that's the similar, if not the same, as the gap between Ivanka, sorry, between Melania Trump and Donald Trump.
[01:37:19.519 --> 01:37:21.941]  But of course, she was 28 when they met.
[01:37:21.941 --> 01:37:27.204]  So yes, she was his teacher, 40 years old, and he was 15.
[01:37:27.204 --> 01:37:32.828]  Now the kiss is a more platonic kind of French style on the cheek kiss, but he very much wanted to pursue her.
[01:37:32.828 --> 01:37:33.949]  He suggested that they write
[01:37:34.469 --> 01:37:43.151]  A play together, I can only imagine it was entitled Evacuous Oedipal, but they wrote a play together and then she began to pursue him, he began to pursue her.
[01:37:43.151 --> 01:37:56.113]  His parents tried to move him away from her, but they continued their relationship and one of her daughters was his classmate while she was teaching him when she began to fixate upon him at the age of 15.
[01:37:56.113 --> 01:38:00.954]  Now the age of consent in France is 15 and they say that it's a secret when their relationship became physical.
[01:38:00.954 --> 01:38:03.355]  It's a secret, I imagine, for pretty obvious reasons.
[01:38:03.995 --> 01:38:11.379]  But I don't think she's allowed to have sexual relations with a student if she is in a position of power over him.
[01:38:11.379 --> 01:38:13.700]  And this is pretty horrendous stuff.
[01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:26.246]  And of course, we can just imagine if the situations were reversed and he was a 40-year-old teacher who began fixating on a 15-year-old teenage girl in his class and then pursued her and they ended up together.
[01:38:26.246 --> 01:38:29.147]  It's pretty messy and it's pretty ugly.
[01:38:29.147 --> 01:38:30.508]  But of course, it's France!
[01:38:30.828 --> 01:38:41.796]  I mean, you have, in France, politicians all the time having these kinds of weird and creepy things set up, and it actually sometimes even seems to help their cause in ways that pass my understanding completely.
[01:38:43.015 --> 01:38:49.137]  Well, the thing that ties into this, Stefan, is, you know, we've got the polls showing 20-25 points ahead for Macron.
[01:38:49.137 --> 01:38:55.198]  The only thing that could probably... and, you know, don't trust the polls, they say, but this is quite a big gap at this point.
[01:38:55.198 --> 01:39:00.600]  The only thing that could probably bring him down at this point within the next 10 days is a massive scandal.
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:05.501]  They've already set the narrative that if a scandal does emerge about Macron, that it's
[01:39:06.101 --> 01:39:08.064]  Russian hackers to blame once again.
[01:39:08.064 --> 01:39:21.424]  They actually had a New York Times article yesterday, if we can flash that up, I think we had it during the fourth hour, where they were saying again that Russian hackers had tried to penetrate Macron's party campaign emails, very similar to the DNC leak.
[01:39:22.085 --> 01:39:35.272]  There was actually another article which said that concerns about Muslim migration, there you see the New York Times article, there was another article which said concerns about Muslim migration were Vladimir Putin's fault.
[01:39:35.272 --> 01:39:46.739]  And that was Marine Le Pen's whole campaign, they said, was concerns about Muslim migration, but that was a narrative, a meme, that Vladimir Putin had inserted into the entire narrative.
[01:39:47.259 --> 01:39:50.262]  Now you've had 21 jihadist attacks in France.
[01:39:50.262 --> 01:39:56.547]  You've had, what, 230 plus people murdered by jihadists over the past two and a bit years.
[01:39:56.547 --> 01:39:59.930]  How on earth has that got anything to do with Vladimir Putin?
[01:39:59.930 --> 01:40:03.874]  That's obviously an organic, authentic, natural concern.
[01:40:04.454 --> 01:40:12.280]  Well, there is this terrible situation throughout the West as a whole, Paul, as you know, where you arm everyone, you invade everyone, you bomb everyone, and then you invite everyone.
[01:40:33.499 --> 01:40:45.167]  And this is such a disastrous, self-contradictory kind of policy that one, again, I'm, what we talked about earlier, I'm not sure I'm anywhere close to thinking that there's anything confused and positive and altruistic and benevolent.
[01:40:45.167 --> 01:41:03.419]  You couldn't design a system more or better tripwire to take down Western civilization than to spend massive amounts, to strip mine taxpayers for money, use it to buy arms, sell it to dictatorships all over the world, have very aggressive foreign policy, bomb people, invade people, and then invite all of the people into your country who you've been bombing and invading
[01:41:03.659 --> 01:41:10.634]  I mean, it's completely incomprehensible from any standpoint other than a canistipucu on the entire culture.
[01:41:11.812 --> 01:41:13.193]  It's just absolutely incredible.
[01:41:13.193 --> 01:41:15.654]  I mean, we say some countries are further along than others.
[01:41:15.654 --> 01:41:21.976]  I know there's big support in Sweden for the Sweden Democrats, which is actually surprising that they seem to be further ahead.
[01:41:21.976 --> 01:41:24.837]  AFD in Germany seems to be falling behind.
[01:41:24.837 --> 01:41:27.578]  They don't have great organisation behind their party.
[01:41:27.578 --> 01:41:36.342]  So we've had, you know, we've had gloat, populism is ebbing away after the situation in Holland with their election where Geert Wilders failed to win.
[01:41:36.342 --> 01:41:40.764]  Is it really ebbing away or are we just moving at different speeds in different countries?
[01:41:41.855 --> 01:41:46.561]  Well, the future belongs, Paul, to those who want it the most.
[01:41:46.561 --> 01:41:48.523]  That is the basic reality of history.
[01:41:48.523 --> 01:41:58.555]  And if the people who want to preserve their culture are willing to do what it takes intellectually and organizationally and politically, if they're willing to do what it takes to preserve their culture, why then they get to preserve their culture.
[01:41:59.236 --> 01:42:07.118]  And if they don't want to do it, and if the other side is more organized and more efficient and more willing to do what it takes, then they will lose their culture.
[01:42:07.118 --> 01:42:11.720]  And one of the great things that's happening in France at the moment is leftists are really being exposed.
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:16.761]  Because you have, of course, Marine Le Pen, a woman who could become the first female president of France.
[01:42:16.761 --> 01:42:19.762]  She's supported by a significant proportion of French women.
[01:42:19.762 --> 01:42:23.403]  So French women want to vote for a French candidate to break through the glass ceiling
[01:42:23.663 --> 01:42:24.003]  I think so.
[01:42:45.956 --> 01:42:57.481]  And the socialists don't care about them either, so the feminists don't care about women, and the socialists don't care about the poor, and that's all you need to know about the French election, as far as the takeaways for other countries go.
[01:42:57.481 --> 01:43:01.043]  And of course, Marine Le Pen will probably be back in five years' time.
[01:43:01.043 --> 01:43:05.605]  She's got a niece, Marion Le Pen, who is, in some senses, even more conservative than her.
[01:43:05.605 --> 01:43:13.349]  She's also got the most amount of votes from women, which people tend to forget, again, with these feminists protesting against her, literally trying to block people from voting for her.
[01:43:13.889 --> 01:43:15.710]  Let's move on, though, because we've got limited time.
[01:43:15.710 --> 01:43:16.851]  Let's talk about North Korea.
[01:43:16.851 --> 01:43:25.616]  Now, this is always a difficult one because, you know, Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un, they've been threatening to literally destroy the world for the best part of two decades now.
[01:43:25.616 --> 01:43:28.518]  You never know how much of it is alarmism.
[01:43:28.518 --> 01:43:33.461]  People in South Korea tend to roll their eyes at this point whenever these tensions build up again.
[01:43:33.461 --> 01:43:36.743]  That could be, you know, a normalcy bias going on with that.
[01:43:36.743 --> 01:43:41.246]  Obviously, they don't want to fear that annihilation is imminent, so they always reflect
[01:43:42.446 --> 01:43:44.127]  Go back to normalcy bias.
[01:43:44.127 --> 01:43:45.648]  So how much of it is alarmism?
[01:43:45.648 --> 01:43:53.011]  I mean we do have today Reuters reporting Trump has called all 100 senators to the White House for a meeting.
[01:43:53.011 --> 01:43:54.732]  They're calling it an unusual move.
[01:43:54.732 --> 01:43:56.533]  He's going to talk about North Korea.
[01:43:56.533 --> 01:44:03.296]  Some are speculating he's pushing for support from those senators for an actual declaration of war.
[01:44:03.296 --> 01:44:04.077]  Yet we've heard
[01:44:04.577 --> 01:44:12.684]  This same beating of the war drums, this same alarmism for decades now, just how alarmed should we be about the situation in North Korea right now?
[01:44:13.743 --> 01:44:14.924]  Oh, I think very alarmed.
[01:44:14.924 --> 01:44:31.418]  I think very alarmed, Paul, because if there is the idea that there's some kind of surgical strike that they can take out the North Korean leadership in some sort of single-strike decapitation, that's my great temptation, because history has shown that high IQ populations in the Koreans are among the highest IQ population in the world.
[01:44:31.418 --> 01:44:37.664]  High IQ populations do very well through regime change, and you can look at sort of post-Second World War Germany and Japan.
[01:44:38.144 --> 01:44:38.264]  Yes.
[01:44:55.951 --> 01:44:59.192]  I see that being a positive thing, sort of putting myself in their position.
[01:44:59.192 --> 01:45:03.954]  I mean, they're so starved, as I talked about on the show recently, Paul, they're so starved in North Korea.
[01:45:03.954 --> 01:45:07.936]  But even though they're genetically the same as South Koreans, they're four inches shorter.
[01:45:07.936 --> 01:45:10.817]  And so it is a monstrous open-air prison there.
[01:45:10.817 --> 01:45:16.239]  If some sort of surgical strike could go in to take out the leadership and replace it, unify the country, which is different.
[01:45:16.239 --> 01:45:21.281]  You know, unification of East and West Germany was a lot easier than trying to do regime change in Iraq.
[01:45:21.281 --> 01:45:22.802]  And so there is that possibility.
[01:45:22.802 --> 01:45:24.843]  If it's a ground war, though, I think it's a disaster.
[01:45:25.203 --> 01:45:27.024]  Because then they'll have enough warning.
[01:45:27.024 --> 01:45:29.166]  They will be able to launch their nuclear weapons.
[01:45:29.166 --> 01:45:30.947]  Seoul is just a stone's throw away.
[01:45:30.947 --> 01:45:33.069]  You've got millions and millions of people there.
[01:45:33.069 --> 01:45:36.091]  And that could be a true catastrophe for the region.
[01:45:36.091 --> 01:45:40.334]  The repercussions of which will be felt biologically, physically, radioactively for generations.
[01:45:41.388 --> 01:45:50.534]  It's difficult because China came out a few days ago and basically in their official Global Times mouthpiece and said, you know, we will not tolerate regime change in North Korea.
[01:45:50.534 --> 01:45:57.338]  But again, as you said, there is a temptation to be an interventionist in that sense because you know for a fact that it is.
[01:45:57.338 --> 01:46:01.961]  They've literally got 200,000 political dissidents in concentration camps.
[01:46:01.961 --> 01:46:03.402]  The figure's probably higher by now.
[01:46:04.002 --> 01:46:05.542]  It's also different to the Middle East.
[01:46:05.542 --> 01:46:13.024]  You know, you're not going to get a vacuum where a bunch of horrible jihadists, even worse than the dictatorship, rush in and take power.
[01:46:13.024 --> 01:46:16.145]  The tyranny that they're living under, I don't think people can grasp it.
[01:46:16.145 --> 01:46:21.005]  We have defectors, people who have escaped into Japan, into China, come out with these stories.
[01:46:21.005 --> 01:46:27.907]  I think one of my favourites, because it's based on the Prisoner series, which I'm a big fan of, and they copied it, basically.
[01:46:28.487 --> 01:46:39.738]  People in North Korea, they, by law, it's mandatory that they have a radio in their apartment broadcasting propaganda during daytime hours.
[01:46:39.738 --> 01:46:41.140]  They can't turn it off.
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:44.683]  They physically can't turn off the government propaganda.
[01:46:44.683 --> 01:46:46.765]  They can only lower the volume.
[01:46:46.765 --> 01:46:48.227]  So there is that temptation.
[01:46:48.607 --> 01:46:51.808]  Knowing the absolute terror that these people are placed under.
[01:46:51.808 --> 01:46:54.670]  You know, women have babies in these concentration camps.
[01:46:54.670 --> 01:46:55.970]  They rip the babies out.
[01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:57.411]  They strangle them.
[01:46:57.411 --> 01:46:59.192]  Absolutely horrific tales.
[01:46:59.192 --> 01:47:03.714]  Not coming out of the mainstream media, but coming directly from defectors.
[01:47:03.714 --> 01:47:08.376]  And numerous similar stories that they match up with each other.
[01:47:09.016 --> 01:47:19.660]  I mean, how can we make people grasp the tyranny that North Koreans are living under, given the... Well, you can't have a tough time with that, Paul, because of course it comes out of a communist history.
[01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:24.901]  Anything that comes out of a communist or socialist history is going to be downplayed by the mainstream media.
[01:47:24.901 --> 01:47:35.225]  You know, it's a real tragedy when you have world leaders or anybody reading 1984 not as a warning, but as an instruction manual, because, of course, you're reminded of the telescreens when you're talking about these radios.
[01:47:35.925 --> 01:47:56.052]  But if you look at what's going on in Venezuela, where on average people have lost 17 pounds over the last little while, where you've got death squads being sort of put together by the government to put down dissent, when you have starvation, when you've got people hunting pigeons and rats just to try and stay alive, well that comes out of socialist policies, therefore it's going to be under-reported on by the mainstream media.
[01:47:56.052 --> 01:48:01.634]  The fact that North Korea has evolved from the usual horror show, right, of the communist
[01:48:02.054 --> 01:48:07.179]  Central planning and central control of the economy into the inevitable style and style culture personality.
[01:48:07.179 --> 01:48:16.967]  They don't want to talk about it It's just some nameless dictatorship They never want to talk about how it came about which is the Soviets and the Chinese funding Communists to invade the north and take it over
[01:48:17.427 --> 01:48:21.548]  So, it's really, really hard to get the facts, other than some vague, nameless horror.
[01:48:21.548 --> 01:48:32.771]  No lessons are being learned about central planning, about centralized control, about socialism and communism, because that is the agenda of so much of the mainstream leftist media, that they simply won't talk about the history.
[01:48:32.771 --> 01:48:34.532]  You can't get any positive lessons.
[01:48:34.532 --> 01:48:39.413]  That's why people come to you and I, Paul, to get the actual lessons that people need to learn from these kinds of tragedies.
[01:48:39.713 --> 01:48:41.535]  Now you mentioned Venezuela there, Stefan.
[01:48:41.535 --> 01:48:46.360]  You have Maduro handing out firearms to 400,000 loyalists.
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:49.724]  We have this article, I think it's the SHTF one.
[01:48:49.724 --> 01:48:52.687]  They're giving guns to 400,000 loyalists.
[01:48:52.687 --> 01:48:54.569]  They've had these massive street protests.
[01:48:55.149 --> 01:49:04.895]  Isn't it interesting that they banned private ownership of firearms back in 2012, so they disarmed the population, armed the Loyalist Thug Brigade.
[01:49:04.895 --> 01:49:16.842]  I mean, Stefan, has there ever been a socialist experiment, not just talking about Venezuela, on any kind of scale that hasn't led to mass starvation and bloodshed as it looks like could happen now in Venezuela?
[01:49:18.152 --> 01:49:30.600]  Well, I can't think of any time in history where the central banking, the money printing, the buying of votes, the increasing control of the government over the economy, the setting of prices, the limiting of production...
[01:49:31.474 --> 01:49:43.942]  It always leads to, and it sounds so terribly cold and clinical because it is human lives at stake, but this misallocation of resources that the great economist von Mises talked about almost a hundred years ago in the 1920s.
[01:49:43.942 --> 01:49:45.003]  He talked about this.
[01:49:45.003 --> 01:49:52.067]  If you don't have a free market, if you don't have a price system, there's simply no conceivable way to efficiently allocate resources.
[01:49:52.067 --> 01:49:53.448]  Resources get wasted.
[01:49:53.448 --> 01:49:54.609]  Resources get squandered.
[01:49:54.609 --> 01:49:56.430]  You can think of France with their lakes
[01:49:56.710 --> 01:49:57.390]  I think so.
[01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:23.233]  Okay, we're going to leave it there for now.

[01:57:10.422 --> 01:57:15.887]  Those are all people who've got the product, happy with it, come back again and again and again.
[01:57:15.887 --> 01:57:17.408]  It is DNA Force.
[01:57:17.408 --> 01:57:21.352]  It's available right now at InfoWarsStore.com or it will be shortly.

[01:57:42.383 --> 01:57:45.044]  Information Liberation reports.
[01:57:45.044 --> 01:57:50.205]  America's first Somali lawmaker votes against ending life insurance payouts to terrorists.
[01:57:51.542 --> 01:58:07.235]  Elan Omar, America's first Somali lawmaker, who was hailed by the media last year for quote, making history, just voted against a Minnesota bill to deny life insurance payouts to terrorists and their beneficiaries.
[01:58:07.235 --> 01:58:17.223]  Now this is important because at least 42 Somali refugees have been confirmed by the FBI to have left the US to join overseas terrorist organizations.
[01:58:18.382 --> 01:58:23.524]  So she's voted against a bill that would strip them of insurance payouts.
[01:58:23.524 --> 01:58:24.685]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:58:24.685 --> 01:58:27.866]  This, of course, arose out of the San Bernardino situation.
[01:58:27.866 --> 01:58:31.968]  She's representing her community by actually voting against that.
[01:58:31.968 --> 01:58:36.669]  Absolutely incredible news, and we'll be back with more on the Alex Jones Show in the next segment.
[01:58:36.669 --> 01:58:37.890]  Breaking news!
[01:58:37.890 --> 01:58:38.730]  Infowars.com.
[01:58:38.730 --> 01:58:45.693]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.693 --> 01:58:47.754]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.954 --> 01:58:56.417]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:58:56.417 --> 01:58:58.498]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:58:58.498 --> 01:59:03.800]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:07.562]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants that
[01:59:07.642 --> 01:59:11.085]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:59:11.085 --> 01:59:14.268]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:59:14.268 --> 01:59:18.151]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:59:18.151 --> 01:59:25.337]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:59:25.337 --> 01:59:30.722]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[01:59:30.882 --> 01:59:32.202]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:07.892 --> 02:00:11.966]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:11.966 --> 02:00:13.631]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.391 --> 02:00:30.555]  We are into the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:30.555 --> 02:00:40.507]  We have James Wesley Rawls coming up with his hot take on Operation Gotham Shield, that huge nuclear bomb drill which is basically taking place across the East Coast today.
[02:00:41.468 --> 02:00:50.451]  Is that a routine exercise or are they preparing for something specific in mind given all the threats with North Korea that are building right now?
[02:00:50.451 --> 02:00:52.372]  We'll talk to James Wesley Rawls about that.
[02:00:52.372 --> 02:00:55.133]  We're going to dip into some news right now though.
[02:00:55.133 --> 02:01:00.575]  French mayor found guilty of incitement for saying 91% Muslim classrooms are a problem!
[02:01:01.235 --> 02:01:10.120]  He committed the thought crime of saying that 91% Muslim classrooms in a Western country, something not quite right about that.
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:11.781]  That's not integration.
[02:01:11.781 --> 02:01:13.782]  That's not multiculturalism.
[02:01:13.782 --> 02:01:15.303]  That's monoculture.
[02:01:15.303 --> 02:01:16.403]  That's a problem.
[02:01:16.403 --> 02:01:17.544]  No, can't say that.
[02:01:17.544 --> 02:01:18.524]  That's a thought crime.
[02:01:18.524 --> 02:01:19.925]  Now he's being charged.
[02:01:19.925 --> 02:01:26.829]  Right-wing mayor Robert Menard has been found guilty of a thought crime in France for saying schools with 91% Muslim students are a problem.
[02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:32.774]  A key advisor to Marine Le Pen has been found guilty, so they're trying to tie it into Le Pen.
[02:01:32.774 --> 02:01:35.597]  Inciting hatred against Muslims.
[02:01:35.597 --> 02:01:45.988]  So again, inciting hatred is pointing out the fact that 91% Muslim students is not integration, is not multiculturalism.
[02:01:47.008 --> 02:02:06.025]  He also posted a tweet, as part of his thought crime, comparing a school picture from the 1970s to one taken most recently, which he said proved the conspiracy theory of a Great Replacement, which claims Muslim immigrants are replacing the traditional French population, which is completely true in some areas of France.
[02:02:06.866 --> 02:02:08.947]  This is the ghettoization.
[02:02:08.947 --> 02:02:18.352]  These are the schools in which we've had cases in Britain, where they're actually being taught radical propaganda in these Muslim majority schools.
[02:02:18.352 --> 02:02:28.578]  That's why it's a problem, because they're actually creating that jihadist mindset at an incredibly early age, like they do in some of the madrasas, like they do in some of the mosques.
[02:02:29.218 --> 02:02:31.619]  But again, they don't get shut down for hate speech.
[02:02:31.619 --> 02:02:36.041]  Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, is more interested in mean comments on the internet.
[02:02:36.041 --> 02:02:41.563]  You have actual hate preachers preaching hate to terrorists who then carry out terrorist attacks.
[02:02:41.563 --> 02:02:42.843]  That's not a problem.
[02:02:42.843 --> 02:02:49.926]  This guy's a problem because he committed the thought crime of saying that 91% Muslim classrooms, that's not multiculturalism.
[02:02:49.926 --> 02:02:51.406]  And it's the same in Britain.
[02:02:51.406 --> 02:02:55.708]  You have entire schools in Birmingham and in the area where I live in London,
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:01.063]  Where you will see the kids go out and play in the park when they take them on trips.
[02:03:01.063 --> 02:03:05.126]  There's one white kid and 25 Arab kids.
[02:03:05.126 --> 02:03:07.108]  Okay, that's not integration!
[02:03:07.108 --> 02:03:08.609]  That's not multiculturalism!
[02:03:08.609 --> 02:03:09.870]  That's mono-culture!
[02:03:11.274 --> 02:03:13.135]  They don't even speak English, a lot of them.
[02:03:13.135 --> 02:03:14.336]  It's a problem.
[02:03:14.336 --> 02:03:16.037]  He simply noted it.
[02:03:16.037 --> 02:03:20.460]  Now he's being charged for inciting hatred against Muslims.
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:22.782]  That's the situation in France.
[02:03:22.782 --> 02:03:29.026]  While they're literally being mowed down on the street by Muslim migrants and Emmanuel Macron says, let's just invite more in and get used to it.
[02:03:29.026 --> 02:03:30.347]  Just get used to it.
[02:03:30.347 --> 02:03:31.808]  This is how we're going to live from now on.
[02:03:33.422 --> 02:03:38.085]  Breitbart reports thousands of former Taliban fighters may have entered Germany.
[02:03:38.085 --> 02:03:39.406]  Thanks, Angela Merkel.
[02:03:39.406 --> 02:03:52.215]  Germany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees has confessed it is dealing with a four-digit number of migrants with declared links to the Taliban, potentially endangering neighboring countries such as France.
[02:03:52.215 --> 02:03:54.136]  This is out of Der Spiegel.
[02:03:54.136 --> 02:04:01.641]  German federal prosecutors are currently investigating at least 70 Afghans, although it's unclear whether they are all suspected of links to the Islamist group.
[02:04:02.822 --> 02:04:17.895]  Six have actually been detained and cases are pending against several more, with Prosecutor General Peter Frank warning politicians that the authorities, which are now contending with suspected Islamic State sympathizers, have now reached, quote, the limits of their capacity.
[02:04:17.895 --> 02:04:23.840]  So now they're inviting in actual Taliban fighters on top of ISIS fighters, of course, Sweden.
[02:04:25.389 --> 02:04:28.731]  150 ISIS militants came back into Sweden.
[02:04:28.731 --> 02:04:31.992]  They let them back in because they felt sorry for them.
[02:04:31.992 --> 02:04:34.573]  After they were chopping people's heads off, they felt sorry for them.
[02:04:34.573 --> 02:04:37.994]  So they wanted to give them jobs, welfare, housing.
[02:04:37.994 --> 02:04:40.155]  That's how Sweden treated them.
[02:04:40.155 --> 02:04:41.536]  The Stockholm attack happened.
[02:04:42.446 --> 02:04:52.356]  Not long after that, this is what they're doing in Europe, actually inviting in Taliban, inviting in Islamic State with very little vetting whatsoever, and it's leading to huge problems.
[02:04:52.356 --> 02:04:57.360]  We'll be back with James Wesley Rawls on the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:57.781]  We'll be back.
[02:05:01.474 --> 02:05:06.780]  Google wants to save you from fake news.
[02:05:06.780 --> 02:05:15.311]  And they are rewriting their algorithm to bury misleading, false and offensive news articles.
[02:05:15.311 --> 02:05:18.114]  Google's parent company, Alphabet Incorporated,
[02:05:18.314 --> 02:05:28.002]  Recently announced a rare sweeping change to its search function and they have already declared Infowars as untrustworthy.
[02:05:28.002 --> 02:05:43.735]  Google claims the new changes are in response to the fake news outbreak of 2016 when the Russians infiltrated alternative and social media to defeat Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump win the presidential election.
[02:05:44.175 --> 02:05:52.045]  So far it remains unclear how the state of California was immune to the Russians' propaganda.
[02:05:52.045 --> 02:05:55.469]  I'm Darren McBreen and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com
[02:06:00.888 --> 02:06:02.729]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:06:02.729 --> 02:06:09.312]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:06:09.312 --> 02:06:12.473]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslive.com.
[02:06:12.473 --> 02:06:22.257]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[02:06:22.257 --> 02:06:23.098]  Caveman.
[02:06:23.098 --> 02:06:28.180]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:30.281]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:06:30.581 --> 02:06:33.723]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:06:33.723 --> 02:06:38.886]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:06:38.886 --> 02:06:47.031]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:06:47.031 --> 02:06:54.876]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:06:54.876 --> 02:06:59.619]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forestlife.com today.

[02:07:57.387 --> 02:07:58.688]  Check it out for yourself today.
[02:08:03.388 --> 02:08:10.078]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:10.078 --> 02:08:14.084]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:08:28.164 --> 02:08:33.607]  They're training as if a fake nuclear bomb has detonated in northern New Jersey.
[02:08:33.607 --> 02:08:42.853]  Hundreds of first responders, strike teams from across the region flooded MetLife Stadium to triage and treat thousands of pretend patients.
[02:08:42.853 --> 02:08:46.296]  They set up a field hospital and a mobile emergency room.
[02:08:46.696 --> 02:08:50.699]  As you can see, it's a basically 48 foot or so tractor trailer.
[02:08:50.699 --> 02:08:51.720]  This is a little higher.
[02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:53.481]  This is a little lower.
[02:08:53.481 --> 02:08:56.204]  Everything kind of collapses in on itself.
[02:08:56.204 --> 02:09:05.791]  Once it's closed up, we could drive anywhere and if we're on scene, I'd say within 30 to 45 minutes, we would be open and seeing patients.
[02:09:05.791 --> 02:09:07.973]  They can also check people for radiation.
[02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:17.816]  When a patient comes in, we would do a quick sweep of the patient with the Geiger counter to make sure that they truly are safe.
[02:09:17.816 --> 02:09:24.121]  The federal government is simultaneously performing a four-day nuclear training exercise led by FEMA.
[02:09:24.121 --> 02:09:28.844]  The Department of Defense, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office and others are participating.
[02:09:29.284 --> 02:09:33.610]  This exercise is separate but tacked on to what FEMA is doing today and tomorrow.
[02:09:33.610 --> 02:09:37.656]  Their training exercise is taking place entirely behind closed doors.
[02:09:37.656 --> 02:09:43.604]  They'll be focusing on communication and coordination in response to a simulated nuclear attack.
[02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:48.843]  That is Operation Gotham Shield, and we're going to talk about that with our guest now.
[02:09:48.843 --> 02:09:51.185]  He is James Wesley Rawls, former U.S.
[02:09:51.185 --> 02:09:55.269]  Army Intelligence Officer, author of the Patriots novel series.
[02:09:55.269 --> 02:10:00.052]  He is the founder and senior editor of SurvivalBlog.com.
[02:10:00.052 --> 02:10:02.554]  James, welcome back to the show.
[02:10:02.554 --> 02:10:04.216]  Thanks for having me on, Paul.
[02:10:04.216 --> 02:10:06.317]  Now, I just want to get into Operation Gotham Shield.
[02:10:06.317 --> 02:10:10.481]  This is a huge drill taking place in numerous different cities in the Northeast today.
[02:10:11.284 --> 02:10:15.888]  Absolutely massive drill, nuclear bomb drill, we heard the segment there.
[02:10:15.888 --> 02:10:20.532]  I mean, is this, do you think this is just routine training, or is it related to North Korea?
[02:10:20.532 --> 02:10:25.236]  Do they expect some kind of massive, you know, Paris-style massacre attack?
[02:10:25.236 --> 02:10:28.458]  Given the details of this drill, what do you think they're preparing for?
[02:10:28.458 --> 02:10:30.200]  Is it anything specific?
[02:10:31.243 --> 02:10:39.507]  Well, I suspect that this training was scheduled months in advance, so it's probably not in response to any really recent news from North Korea.
[02:10:39.507 --> 02:10:46.530]  But nuclear tensions are actually much higher now than they were during the Cold War.
[02:10:46.530 --> 02:10:49.232]  Just most people don't realize it.
[02:10:49.232 --> 02:10:55.775]  We have manifold threats out there, and of course North Korea is at the top of the list right now.
[02:10:57.230 --> 02:11:11.295]  And I suspect that the planners within FEMA and the other federal agencies are anticipating perhaps a coastal attack by North Korea.
[02:11:11.295 --> 02:11:24.179]  I don't believe that they have the launch capability, given the size of the nuclear bombs they have available, they don't have rockets that can carry them all the way trans-Pacific.
[02:11:25.362 --> 02:11:44.334]  But they certainly have fairly advanced submarine technology, so they could presumably drop off a nuclear device right at or near a coastline, somewhere in a literal area.
[02:11:44.334 --> 02:11:49.657]  And the other option, of course, would be to bring in a nuclear device on a cargo ship.
[02:11:50.933 --> 02:11:58.278]  The advantage of bringing them in by submarine, of course, is that they have the chance of being able to bring it in undetected.
[02:11:58.278 --> 02:12:09.985]  And of course, seawater, once you have more than 15 or 20 feet of seawater over a device, it's essentially undetectable because it makes fantastic shielding.
[02:12:09.985 --> 02:12:13.087]  Water makes actually quite good shielding for
[02:12:15.099 --> 02:12:18.220]  Both nuclear power plants and for nuclear weapons.
[02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:29.944]  In fact, that's why you can go visit a nuclear power plant and look down into the pool and see the actual nuclear pile just 20 feet away from you.
[02:12:29.944 --> 02:12:30.965]  In safety.
[02:12:30.965 --> 02:12:33.686]  Because it is such good shielding.
[02:12:33.686 --> 02:12:37.367]  Now I want to flash up this NBC headline because it relates to what you were just talking about.
[02:12:37.947 --> 02:12:39.108]  This is NBC Today.
[02:12:39.108 --> 02:12:41.770]  What should you do in case of a nuclear attack?
[02:12:41.770 --> 02:12:44.051]  Don't run, get inside.
[02:12:44.051 --> 02:12:48.234]  The article states, the simplest of the warnings is don't run, get inside.
[02:12:48.234 --> 02:12:56.380]  Sheltering in place beneath as many layers of protection as possible is the best way to avoid the radiation that would follow a nuclear detonation.
[02:12:56.380 --> 02:13:07.168]  So we have all these articles coming out about, you know, 1950s style preparation, duck and cover, that kind of thing, in the mainstream media, alongside the tensions with North Korea.
[02:13:07.748 --> 02:13:10.930]  James, I mean, this is a question I've wondered over and over again.
[02:13:10.930 --> 02:13:30.563]  You know, if a nuke did hit San Francisco, as you just described, if one was smuggled in, or if North Korea got the capability to do so, you know, given that a lot of millennials now get PTSD if you insult them on the internet, how would today's generation cope with a scenario of actual nuclear war?
[02:13:30.563 --> 02:13:35.727]  I just don't think they would even have the emotional stamina to face up to the reality of it.
[02:13:35.727 --> 02:13:37.408]  It would be absolute bedlam, right?
[02:13:38.568 --> 02:13:39.869]  I have to agree with you, Paul.
[02:13:39.869 --> 02:13:44.712]  I think that that generation is not very well prepared.
[02:13:44.712 --> 02:13:50.355]  They didn't grow up under the nuclear threat like folks in my generation did.
[02:13:50.355 --> 02:13:59.340]  The threat out there is real and it is actually prudent for families to prepare.
[02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:02.962]  Most importantly is you don't want to live right in a target area.
[02:14:04.273 --> 02:14:14.818]  And in the case of North Korea, I think most of their targets would be the west coast of the United States, would be the most likely target locations.
[02:14:14.818 --> 02:14:19.100]  And if you can relocate, I think it's wise to do so.
[02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:24.823]  It's wise to do so just for societal demographic reasons, if nothing else.
[02:14:24.823 --> 02:14:32.106]  But the nuclear threat is just one more reason to leave the major coastal cities and strategically relocate.
[02:14:33.746 --> 02:14:45.556]  And once you've relocated, it's wise to buy a house with a basement and to upgrade that basement to nuclear fallout shelter specifications.
[02:14:45.556 --> 02:14:47.158]  And it's not that difficult to do.
[02:14:47.158 --> 02:14:52.823]  All it takes is mass and an air pump and filtration system.
[02:14:52.823 --> 02:14:53.904]  It's not that difficult.
[02:14:55.692 --> 02:15:05.894]  You know, people need to be prepared to shelter in place for anywhere from three weeks to as much as six months.
[02:15:05.894 --> 02:15:14.156]  And for any preppers who read blogs like mine, they already have the food storage situation squared away.
[02:15:14.156 --> 02:15:20.498]  Hopefully they also have access to well water or spring water that they can pump manually.
[02:15:21.764 --> 02:15:24.825]  Any decent prepper will have already long since done that.
[02:15:24.825 --> 02:15:32.068]  And then it's just a matter of creating a fallout shelter and having the correct monitoring equipment.
[02:15:32.068 --> 02:15:38.910]  You'll need a dosimeter and a rate meter and a charger so that you can zero those two instruments.
[02:15:38.910 --> 02:15:50.574]  And of course, anyone who's under 50 years old should also have access to either potassium iodide or potassium iodate tablets.
[02:15:51.866 --> 02:16:12.953]  So that's what will protect your thyroid gland in the event of a nuclear attack because the thyroid gland naturally accumulates radioactive isotopes and what potassium iodide or potassium iodate will do is flush your thyroid gland to prevent thyroid damage.
[02:16:12.953 --> 02:16:17.274]  But there was a recent study done by Oak Ridge National Laboratory that showed that
[02:16:18.573 --> 02:16:27.083]  It's using that prophylactically is only advisable for people under the age of 50.
[02:16:27.083 --> 02:16:33.611]  Over 50, the risks outweigh the benefits of using potassium iodide.
[02:16:35.376 --> 02:16:43.843]  Now, I mean, sticking with North Korea and the whole nuclear tensions that are building up, I had a guest on on Monday who's actually French, but he lives in Seoul, South Korea.
[02:16:43.843 --> 02:16:48.166]  And he was saying that at this point, people living in Seoul basically roll their eyes.
[02:16:48.166 --> 02:16:50.388]  They're quite nonchalant about all these threats.
[02:16:50.388 --> 02:16:58.574]  They've been hearing them for probably over two decades now, the imminent threat of nuclear attack, that they've basically become quite blase about it.
[02:16:58.574 --> 02:17:00.556]  You know, they've got normalcy bias.
[02:17:00.996 --> 02:17:07.484]  But given the tensions, you know, we have Trump meeting today with a hundred senators on the issue of North Korea.
[02:17:07.484 --> 02:17:12.329]  There's suggestions he's going to try and get authorization for a military attack.
[02:17:12.329 --> 02:17:13.991]  I mean, how alarmed should we be?
[02:17:13.991 --> 02:17:21.480]  It seems people in South Korea, at least, have got this kind of normalcy bias whereby it hasn't happened before, so it's never going to happen in the future.
[02:17:23.479 --> 02:17:33.727]  Well, it's sad to see that they're getting blasé about it, because the nuclear threat from North Korea really didn't exist until about 17, 18 years ago.
[02:17:33.727 --> 02:17:35.209]  But now that it does exist...
[02:17:36.414 --> 02:17:37.996]  It is prudent.
[02:17:37.996 --> 02:17:40.298]  It is wise to prepare.
[02:17:40.298 --> 02:17:50.387]  Obviously, governments are wholly incapable of providing any kind of adequate civil defense for the civilian populace.
[02:17:50.387 --> 02:17:52.569]  It's just not going to happen.
[02:17:52.569 --> 02:17:53.530]  We had a
[02:17:55.712 --> 02:17:59.935]  Civil Defense Program here in the United States, but it's essentially moribund.
[02:17:59.935 --> 02:18:02.917]  It hasn't really been funded since the 1970s.
[02:18:02.917 --> 02:18:06.840]  There's still some designated fallout shelters, but they really aren't viable.
[02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:22.271]  It really comes down to family preparedness and for anyone here in the United States or for anyone in Japan or anyone in South Korea, I think it is wise to go ahead and make preparations.
[02:18:22.271 --> 02:18:24.713]  It's not that expensive and
[02:18:25.993 --> 02:18:35.758]  Although the actual threat may be fairly low in any given year, it's enough of a threat that it's wise to go ahead and prepare.
[02:18:37.608 --> 02:18:40.849]  There definitely is normalcy bias out there.
[02:18:40.849 --> 02:18:49.672]  We'll definitely see some panic reactions if there's actual mobilization on the part of North Korea.
[02:18:49.672 --> 02:18:57.314]  And at that point, anyone who thinks that they'll be able to order themselves a dosimeter, a rate meter,
[02:18:58.234 --> 02:19:00.496]  I have a friend who runs a preparedness company.
[02:19:00.496 --> 02:19:02.098]  He's one of my advertisers on my blog.
[02:19:02.098 --> 02:19:06.162]  He runs a company called Readymade Resources and he's fond of saying, panic now and avoid the rush.
[02:19:24.102 --> 02:19:25.944]  Exactly, that's what most people don't understand.
[02:19:25.944 --> 02:19:30.528]  I mean, a lot of our listeners have obviously got the storable food, but that's only part of it.
[02:19:30.528 --> 02:19:34.451]  I'm going to ask you after the break, actually, we're coming up on about a 30 second break here.
[02:19:34.451 --> 02:19:36.213]  What actually happened to the prepper market?
[02:19:36.213 --> 02:19:43.519]  Obviously we had this supposed crash after Donald Trump won, but now it's picking back up again, obviously accelerated under Obama.
[02:19:43.519 --> 02:19:44.800]  So I'm going to ask you about that.
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:48.403]  We will be back in the next segment with James Wesley Rawls.
[02:19:48.403 --> 02:19:50.104]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[02:19:50.104 --> 02:19:51.566]  Mike Cernovich also coming up.
[02:19:51.986 --> 02:19:55.381]  At the bottom of the hour, breaking news at Infowars.com.
[02:19:55.381 --> 02:19:56.124]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.550 --> 02:20:03.951]  Hiring is the most challenging part of my job.
[02:20:03.951 --> 02:20:04.852]  It's really hard.
[02:20:04.852 --> 02:20:06.973]  The searching, the sorting through resumes.
[02:20:06.973 --> 02:20:08.994]  Most people don't have the right experience.
[02:20:08.994 --> 02:20:12.375]  We started using ZipRecruiter about three months ago.
[02:20:12.375 --> 02:20:15.717]  Right from the start you could tell it was going to make hiring a lot easier.

[02:20:29.904 --> 02:20:32.066]  And I couldn't believe the number of great applicants we got.
[02:20:32.066 --> 02:20:34.527]  I had the person we needed within one week.
[02:20:34.527 --> 02:20:36.989]  I don't know how we hired before ZipRecruiter.

[02:23:29.865 --> 02:23:34.626]  Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they want to stop President Trump.
[02:23:34.626 --> 02:23:38.708]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[02:23:38.708 --> 02:23:44.310]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.

[02:25:17.012 --> 02:25:18.934]  Massive banner at the top there.

[02:25:48.037 --> 02:25:49.859]  We're under sustained attack.

[02:25:56.625 --> 02:25:57.906]  Really highly recommend that.
[02:25:59.678 --> 02:26:08.862]  The mental clarity that you get from taking Brain Force without any of that junkie feeling, any of that side effect that you get from something like coffee really comes through.
[02:26:08.862 --> 02:26:13.965]  You can see the five star reviews there for Brain Force Plus available at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:26:24.386 --> 02:26:33.271]  Now James Wesley Rawls, I was just mentioning it there before the break, you know, we had this huge surge in the prepper market when Barack Obama was in office.
[02:26:33.271 --> 02:26:36.273]  People said that would stagnate once Trump got in.
[02:26:36.273 --> 02:26:45.258]  I think it did for a short time, but still we have the elite buying their panic rooms, buying their land in remote locations like New Zealand.
[02:26:45.258 --> 02:26:51.142]  What's the state of the market right now at both ends, at the elite end and at the prepper end?
[02:26:52.523 --> 02:27:03.860]  Well, at the elite end, it's definitely a frantic market right now because people who never had any interest at all in preparedness are playing catch-up.
[02:27:03.860 --> 02:27:07.806]  At the middle-class prepper level,
[02:27:09.263 --> 02:27:17.650]  There was definitely a drop-off that took place immediately following the election, and it has bounced back.
[02:27:17.650 --> 02:27:29.719]  The only part of the market that's still fairly slow is in firearms and ammunition purchases, which are still fairly slow, simply because there was a huge anticipation that
[02:27:32.077 --> 02:27:37.641]  Clinton would be elected and that there would be additional gun restrictions.
[02:27:37.641 --> 02:27:43.565]  So people overbought before the election and now we're kind of in the in the rebound.
[02:27:43.565 --> 02:27:46.847]  But I think even that will come back probably after this summer.
[02:27:48.536 --> 02:27:49.617]  It's interesting, isn't it?
[02:27:49.617 --> 02:27:58.042]  I mean, we continue to hear stories about panic rooms, about them buying land in New Zealand, people buying entire reserves.
[02:27:58.042 --> 02:28:01.064]  They're preparing, so why shouldn't the people prepare?
[02:28:01.064 --> 02:28:02.225]  James, we've got about a minute left.
[02:28:02.225 --> 02:28:05.407]  Just tell us about Survivalblog.com.
[02:28:05.407 --> 02:28:05.947]  Sure.
[02:28:05.947 --> 02:28:08.369]  Survivalblog has been around for 11 years.
[02:28:08.369 --> 02:28:10.810]  It has very deep archives.
[02:28:10.810 --> 02:28:16.534]  There's a search box in the right-hand column, and if you use that search box, you can search on any topic.
[02:28:17.998 --> 02:28:20.800]  All of the blog archives are fully accessible.
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:24.323]  There's no super secret members only area.
[02:28:24.323 --> 02:28:32.530]  The archives are very deep, very diverse, very rich, and it's all free of charge.
[02:28:32.530 --> 02:28:37.353]  I highly recommend that your listeners and viewers take full advantage of what's there.
[02:28:38.234 --> 02:28:47.337]  Everything from food storage to nuclear, biological and chemical preparedness, small arms, you name it, it's all there, all free of charge.
[02:28:47.337 --> 02:28:49.917]  Again, it's survivalblog.com.
[02:28:49.917 --> 02:28:53.278]  Okay, everyone should go check that out right now, survivalblog.com.
[02:28:53.278 --> 02:28:54.799]  James, thanks for joining us today.
[02:28:55.731 --> 02:28:58.592]  Thank you for having me on, Paul, and God bless you and your listeners.
[02:28:58.592 --> 02:28:59.432]  Okay, it's a pleasure.
[02:28:59.432 --> 02:29:02.974]  There goes James Wesley Rawls of survivalblog.com.
[02:29:02.974 --> 02:29:06.295]  We're going to come back in the next segment with Mike Cernovich.
[02:29:06.295 --> 02:29:07.296]  45 seconds left in this.
[02:29:07.296 --> 02:29:11.457]  Let's go to a Max Lavo article on a similar topic we were just covering.
[02:29:11.457 --> 02:29:12.978]  Prepare for war!
[02:29:12.978 --> 02:29:17.560]  Trump asks all 100 US Senators to attend rare White House briefing on North Korea.
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:22.363]  They're saying that this is a highly unusual meeting.
[02:29:22.363 --> 02:29:33.890]  Is Donald Trump preparing to get senatorial, congressional authorization for a strike, an attack, an act of regime change against North Korea?
[02:29:33.890 --> 02:29:42.256]  And how will China react to that, given that they said just a couple of days ago they will not tolerate regime change in Pyongyang?
[02:29:42.256 --> 02:29:43.997]  Absolutely huge development.
[02:29:43.997 --> 02:29:47.960]  We'll be watching it and we'll be back after the break with Mike Cernovich, InfoWars.com.
[02:29:49.821 --> 02:29:53.744]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.744 --> 02:29:56.426]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.916 --> 02:30:08.083]  North Korea continues to threaten the United States, this time saying they are ready to sink the U.S.
[02:30:08.083 --> 02:30:11.906]  aircraft carrier Carl Vinson with a single strike.
[02:30:11.906 --> 02:30:20.935]  They also claim that their military has the ability to reach the continental United States, and they are now in possession of a massive hydrogen bomb.
[02:30:21.155 --> 02:30:31.509]  Meanwhile, the White House held an emergency meeting over North Korea that included a phone call between President Trump and China over the escalating tensions in the region.
[02:30:31.509 --> 02:30:36.436]  And China says World War III is inevitable as North Korea prepares
[02:30:36.836 --> 02:30:37.157]  I'm good.
[02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:09.088]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[02:31:09.088 --> 02:31:10.309]  A 360 win.
[02:31:10.309 --> 02:31:16.875]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[02:31:16.875 --> 02:31:24.402]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:31:24.782 --> 02:31:29.865]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:31:29.865 --> 02:31:35.949]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:31:35.949 --> 02:31:43.755]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:31:43.755 --> 02:31:50.959]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:31:50.959 --> 02:31:51.780]  10% off on auto ship.
[02:31:51.920 --> 02:31:54.341]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:54.341 --> 02:31:56.342]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[02:31:56.342 --> 02:32:00.583]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[02:32:00.583 --> 02:32:06.046]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Fluoride Toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:06.046 --> 02:32:08.126]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:32:08.126 --> 02:32:13.429]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:17.150]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[02:32:17.270 --> 02:32:20.712]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:32:20.712 --> 02:32:23.895]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:32:23.895 --> 02:32:27.777]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:32:27.777 --> 02:32:34.942]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:32:34.942 --> 02:32:40.346]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[02:32:40.606 --> 02:32:42.647]  Iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[02:32:42.647 --> 02:32:50.949]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue that is Spearmint-free.
[02:32:50.949 --> 02:32:59.251]  Learn more about the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[02:33:10.025 --> 02:33:17.054]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.054 --> 02:33:20.859]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:33:25.689 --> 02:33:27.930]  We are back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:27.930 --> 02:33:30.231]  We have Mike Cernovich waiting in the wings.
[02:33:30.231 --> 02:33:34.812]  We're going to go to him in a minute to talk about a big article he put out regarding Saudi Arabia.
[02:33:34.812 --> 02:33:38.354]  But first, I want to direct your attention to infowarsstore.com.
[02:33:38.354 --> 02:33:46.917]  Again, we don't take giant fat checks from George Soros like a lot of organizations do, including media organizations.
[02:33:47.577 --> 02:33:51.358]  We don't take money from Gulf State dictatorships like CNN does.
[02:33:51.358 --> 02:33:57.260]  We don't take money from giant pharmaceutical companies like most networks do these days.
[02:33:57.260 --> 02:34:01.322]  We're supported solely by you getting the products.
[02:34:01.322 --> 02:34:04.143]  That means we're only beholden to you.
[02:34:04.143 --> 02:34:07.404]  Our message is not controlled from above by anyone.
[02:34:07.404 --> 02:34:08.644]  That is key.
[02:34:08.644 --> 02:34:09.565]  That is critical.
[02:34:10.225 --> 02:34:18.133]  In maintaining independence and integrity, which is why we're so appreciative of you getting the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:34:18.133 --> 02:34:22.798]  We have our featured review of the day, which is about Survival Shield X2.
[02:34:22.798 --> 02:34:23.999]  It's from New York.
[02:34:23.999 --> 02:34:28.744]  It says, I take Survival Shield X2 on a daily basis as part of my supplemental support system.
[02:34:29.284 --> 02:34:33.226]  Just three drops a day, and the bottle feels like it lasts forever.
[02:34:33.226 --> 02:34:36.427]  I had a very mild detox when I began, but quickly settled in.
[02:34:36.427 --> 02:34:38.888]  Great product, Alex, and Infowars.
[02:34:38.888 --> 02:34:41.029]  Five-star review.
[02:34:41.029 --> 02:34:44.690]  I actually asked Anthony Gucciardi about these reviews earlier, you know.
[02:34:44.690 --> 02:34:47.311]  What happens if you get a dreadful one-star review?
[02:34:47.311 --> 02:34:48.072]  And he basically said...
[02:34:49.412 --> 02:34:50.853]  Hardly ever happens.
[02:34:50.853 --> 02:34:53.435]  These are authentic, original reviews.
[02:34:53.435 --> 02:34:56.518]  If we do get a 2-3 star review, we leave it up there.
[02:34:56.518 --> 02:34:57.959]  We don't take them down.
[02:34:57.959 --> 02:35:03.823]  But even with that, you see, virtually every product is 4.7, 4.8, 4.9.
[02:35:03.823 --> 02:35:15.473]  And in this instance, a 5 star review for Survival Shield X2, people are getting these products, feeling the benefits, coming back, getting that re-up option, which means they don't have to keep going back to the website.
[02:35:16.530 --> 02:35:20.693]  They don't have to remember to go back and the support is regular.
[02:35:20.693 --> 02:35:21.454]  It's routine.
[02:35:21.454 --> 02:35:22.675]  We really appreciate it.
[02:35:22.675 --> 02:35:32.102]  We got the 53% off Caveman True Paleo Formula now available for the first time ever at that price and it's not going to stick around at that price for long.
[02:35:32.102 --> 02:35:34.904]  Available right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:35:34.904 --> 02:35:36.466]  Get the products today!
[02:35:37.714 --> 02:35:42.418]  Mike Cernovich has a big article up, if you can get it up on screen there.
[02:35:42.418 --> 02:35:48.543]  Saudi Arabia to obtain arms, nuclear technology and McMaster orchestrated deal.
[02:35:48.543 --> 02:35:53.348]  Saudi Arabia will obtain a massive weapons arsenal and missile defence system in a deal.
[02:35:53.928 --> 02:35:54.889]  Proceed by H.R.
[02:35:54.889 --> 02:35:57.870]  McMaster, Gary Cohn and Dina Powell.
[02:35:57.870 --> 02:36:05.815]  Under this deal, which is set to be announced in May, Saudi Arabia will obtain technology to build civilian nuclear reactors.
[02:36:05.815 --> 02:36:13.579]  President Trump has expressed skepticism of this deal, despite continued pressure from McMaster, Cohn and Powell.
[02:36:14.676 --> 02:36:19.341]  Mike, I mean, Saudi Arabia, this is a country that had involvement in 9-11.
[02:36:19.341 --> 02:36:24.586]  Trump himself slammed Saudi Arabia for engaging in a brutal war against Yemen.
[02:36:24.586 --> 02:36:30.071]  Why is the Trump administration now moving closer to Saudi Arabia with this deal?
[02:36:31.058 --> 02:36:35.682]  Well, if you scroll in that article, you can see a picture that is quite revealing.
[02:36:35.682 --> 02:36:48.111]  You can see Dina Powell hanging out with the wife of the same Saudi prince who told Donald Trump that he was a disgrace, not only to the GOP, but to all Americans.
[02:36:48.111 --> 02:36:51.114]  So there you can see Dina's with Umar.
[02:36:51.114 --> 02:36:55.817]  She's with the Saudi princess, Arianna Huffington.
[02:36:56.878 --> 02:37:00.463]  It really says it all.
[02:37:00.463 --> 02:37:09.254]  Once KT McFarland is out, Dina Powell is actually one of two people who is going to be second in command at the National Security Council.
[02:37:09.254 --> 02:37:10.896]  She's working her way up.
[02:37:10.896 --> 02:37:14.200]  So she and globalist Gary, who both worked at Golden Sacks,
[02:37:14.700 --> 02:37:18.084]  And as you know, the Saudis give a lot of money to Goldman Sachs.
[02:37:18.084 --> 02:37:22.508]  Goldman Sachs will make a lot of money out of this deal, brokering this deal.
[02:37:22.508 --> 02:37:24.110]  That's ultimately what this is about.
[02:37:24.110 --> 02:37:26.633]  It is the coup that we talked about before.
[02:37:27.745 --> 02:37:36.210]  Where McMaster has been bringing in Goldman Sachs people, bringing in Deep State people, bringing in Never Trump people to take over the NSD.
[02:37:36.210 --> 02:37:38.432]  They worked hard to push out Bannon.
[02:37:38.432 --> 02:37:43.515]  Remember Bannon was on the NSD board for a while and they wanted to get him shuffled away.
[02:37:43.515 --> 02:37:47.057]  And I actually have another story too about what McMaster wants to do.
[02:37:47.057 --> 02:37:50.780]  And this is a story I haven't even had time to write up because I'm just developing it.
[02:37:50.780 --> 02:37:52.581]  So we can talk about the Saudi Arabia thing.
[02:37:53.081 --> 02:37:59.273]  And then I can break a brand new story that is in my note form because I haven't even had time to write it up yet.
[02:37:59.273 --> 02:38:01.356]  Go ahead, let's break that new story right now.
[02:38:01.356 --> 02:38:01.937]  Tell us about it.
[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:05.062]  All right, so McMaster has another plan.
[02:38:05.062 --> 02:38:10.207]  So as you know, McMaster wanted to do 150,000 ground trips in Syria.
[02:38:10.207 --> 02:38:11.048]  I reported that.
[02:38:11.048 --> 02:38:12.790]  People go, oh, that's fake.
[02:38:12.790 --> 02:38:16.554]  And then Bloomberg reports it, and they go, oh, well, Sternovich was wrong.
[02:38:16.554 --> 02:38:20.798]  McMaster only wants 50,000, you know, as if that changes anything.
[02:38:20.798 --> 02:38:25.703]  And as if, you know, 50,000, 150, once you have boots on the ground in that number.
[02:38:26.363 --> 02:38:28.083]  Now you're just fighting at the margins.
[02:38:28.083 --> 02:38:32.845]  So McMaster was rebuffed by that because Trump's people were furious about that.
[02:38:32.845 --> 02:38:41.547]  And that's why a lot of the media team actually really hates me because I'm breaking this kind of news and I'm disrupting global scary Dino Paul and all those people.
[02:38:41.547 --> 02:38:45.288]  And remember too, the head of Trump's media team is actually a never Trumper.
[02:38:46.008 --> 02:38:47.969]  So it really is mind-blowing.
[02:38:47.969 --> 02:39:00.313]  So McMaster presented a $35 billion plan for Afghanistan at a principals meeting, which was with the whole National Security Council minus the president was there.
[02:39:00.313 --> 02:39:09.497]  McMaster wants to spend $35 billion in Afghanistan and he faced a lot of resistance and pushback from various officials there.
[02:39:09.497 --> 02:39:12.198]  McMaster said, I quote, we will create
[02:39:13.018 --> 02:39:15.639]  An inclusive government.
[02:39:15.639 --> 02:39:23.363]  This strategy has not been presented to the President because even the people at the principals meeting think McMaster is out of his mind.
[02:39:23.363 --> 02:39:24.683]  They're saying, what are you talking about?
[02:39:24.683 --> 02:39:27.344]  You want to do $35 billion in Afghanistan?
[02:39:27.344 --> 02:39:28.465]  What is that going to look like?
[02:39:28.465 --> 02:39:31.126]  Are we talking troop surges, another surge?
[02:39:31.126 --> 02:39:35.288]  Now remember McMaster was a protege of David Petraeus and Petraeus is indeed
[02:39:36.008 --> 02:39:41.613]  Pulling the strings of McMaster and Petraeus was a big proponent of the search.
[02:39:41.613 --> 02:39:50.960]  So McMaster is now going to present another massive $35 billion plan to Donald Trump to create a new regime in Afghanistan.
[02:39:51.789 --> 02:39:53.190]  Now where's Bannon in all this?
[02:39:53.190 --> 02:39:58.334]  Because we know there were reports that he had spoke out against the Syria strike.
[02:39:58.334 --> 02:40:01.416]  There were separate reports that he had kind of faded off into the background.
[02:40:01.416 --> 02:40:04.639]  At one point it looked like he was hanging on by a thread.
[02:40:04.639 --> 02:40:06.080]  Where's his voice in all this?
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:13.506]  Why isn't Bannon being more vocal in telling Trump what a sheer disaster this is going to be, given the history of interventions in the region?
[02:40:14.352 --> 02:40:21.777]  Well, the media played a great psychological operation on Trump, and I actually had warned people about it because I knew it would work.
[02:40:21.777 --> 02:40:31.163]  What happened with Bannon is the media created a narrative which claimed that Bannon was violating one of the 48 laws of power, which is never outshine the master.
[02:40:31.163 --> 02:40:35.246]  The media made it look like Bannon was actually controlling Trump.
[02:40:35.246 --> 02:40:41.150]  That rattles Trump's ego because he's thinking, how dare anybody say that that's my strategist?
[02:40:41.150 --> 02:40:42.871]  Bannon was actually going to be out.
[02:40:43.551 --> 02:40:56.699]  Um, like as of 10 days ago, Bannon was gone, but he actually had to completely lay low and realizes that if he is too vocal, then Trump is going to have him out.
[02:40:56.699 --> 02:41:02.323]  Because what you don't see in the media, which I find interesting, is where the articles saying that Gary Cohn
[02:41:03.443 --> 02:41:08.185]  Is manipulating, controlling Trump, even though Gary Cohn is the one presenting these tax plans.
[02:41:08.185 --> 02:41:16.448]  So what the media is doing is they are trying to attack Trump and attack his ego by saying, look, Bannon really controls Trump.
[02:41:16.448 --> 02:41:17.788]  That's how they create drama.
[02:41:17.788 --> 02:41:19.309]  That's how they create strife.
[02:41:19.309 --> 02:41:22.190]  But the media is not saying anything about McMaster.
[02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:25.412]  Or Dina Powell or Gary Cohen.
[02:41:25.412 --> 02:41:33.678]  Even those are actually the real puppet masters because a lot of people are saying now that Trump doesn't want to go on this trip to Saudi Arabia.
[02:41:33.678 --> 02:41:42.724]  Trump was actually not sold on it, but he's getting a massive amount of pressure from Dina Powell, McMaster and from Cohen.
[02:41:42.724 --> 02:41:45.986]  So they're the people who have more or less taken over the National Security Council.
[02:41:45.986 --> 02:41:52.051]  And now the NSC is essentially becoming a puppet of Petraeus and a puppet of Goldman Sachs in Saudi Arabia.
[02:41:53.021 --> 02:42:02.804]  And as you said, the media isn't going to kick up a fuss about the fact that, you know, as I talked about months ago, literally half of the National Security Council were Council on Foreign Relations members.
[02:42:02.804 --> 02:42:04.044]  This was months ago!
[02:42:04.044 --> 02:42:08.745]  And you would expect some of them to be, but, you know, that swamp was filled pretty quickly.
[02:42:08.745 --> 02:42:12.066]  I want to get your take on this as well, Mike, because it ties into all this.
[02:42:12.066 --> 02:42:14.967]  Ivanka Trump, and let's get that clip ready again.
[02:42:14.967 --> 02:42:20.749]  Ivanka Trump saying that allowing Syrian refugees into the US needs to be part of the discussion.
[02:42:20.749 --> 02:42:21.609]  Let's roll the clip.
[02:42:22.875 --> 02:42:23.415]  I think there is...
[02:42:42.051 --> 02:42:48.455]  A global humanitarian crisis that's happening, and we have to come together, and we have to solve it.
[02:42:48.455 --> 02:42:52.838]  And, you know, refugees... Does that include opening the borders to Syrian refugees in the U.S.?
[02:42:52.838 --> 02:42:56.181]  That has to be part of the discussion, but that's not going to be enough in and of itself.
[02:42:56.809 --> 02:43:02.392]  Now Mike, she's hanging out with Angela Merkel, the pioneer of the disastrous migrant policy in Germany.
[02:43:02.392 --> 02:43:05.134]  She's hanging out with Christine Lagarde, you know, another globalist.
[02:43:05.134 --> 02:43:09.176]  She's writing op-eds in the Financial Times with the President of the World Bank.
[02:43:09.176 --> 02:43:12.918]  At best, she's a naive, misinformed, bleeding-heart liberal.
[02:43:12.918 --> 02:43:15.039]  At worst, she's an actual globalist.
[02:43:15.039 --> 02:43:20.823]  How concerned should we be that she's become this prominent within the Trump administration, given what we just heard?
[02:43:21.837 --> 02:43:30.003]  Paul, this is 4D Chess, and if you don't understand that this is really just 4D Chess, then you just don't understand what is really going on.
[02:43:30.003 --> 02:43:36.347]  This is all part of the Grand Master Plan, and anybody who can't understand that this is actually good.
[02:43:36.347 --> 02:43:43.412]  This actually means we won't have terrorists coming in, because something, something, something, 4D Chess, something, something, something.
[02:43:45.103 --> 02:43:47.424]  So at this point they're running out of excuses.
[02:43:47.424 --> 02:43:54.728]  We've got the very people expressing the policies Americans voted against, now pushing those policies.
[02:43:54.728 --> 02:43:56.669]  They're the people closest to Trump.
[02:43:56.669 --> 02:43:59.330]  It's the elephant in the room, that's why we're concerned about it.
[02:43:59.330 --> 02:44:01.632]  But, you know, we've still got the proviso at least.
[02:44:01.632 --> 02:44:03.252]  Hillary Clinton's not in there.
[02:44:03.252 --> 02:44:05.213]  Trump is still impressionable.
[02:44:05.213 --> 02:44:06.854]  He listens to a lot of people.
[02:44:06.854 --> 02:44:11.437]  Do we still have a chance to reach him and to try and drown out these globalist voices?
[02:44:12.173 --> 02:44:13.374]  Sure, and that's the point.
[02:44:13.374 --> 02:44:15.996]  I'm getting really tired of the morons.
[02:44:15.996 --> 02:44:19.298]  I don't mind the people who call me like a Nazi every day and lie about me.
[02:44:19.298 --> 02:44:20.299]  I'm so used to that.
[02:44:20.299 --> 02:44:26.823]  I'm tired of the morons who anytime we offer a critique or explain something, they go, you're anti-Trump now.
[02:44:26.823 --> 02:44:28.184]  You must hate Trump.
[02:44:28.184 --> 02:44:29.545]  Those people are so stupid.
[02:44:29.545 --> 02:44:31.046]  I don't know how they ever found me.
[02:44:31.046 --> 02:44:32.607]  I want them to unfollow me.
[02:44:32.607 --> 02:44:36.450]  I don't want them watching anything because, no, that is exactly not the point.
[02:44:36.830 --> 02:44:44.276]  As I've said, Hillary in office would be so much fundamentally worse than the little squabbles we're having now.
[02:44:44.276 --> 02:44:47.478]  The big picture is Hillary isn't in, I'm happy.
[02:44:47.478 --> 02:44:55.345]  As you can see in that fan artwork, you're on that, Alex Jones is in there, there's Alex, Roger Stone, you're up there, you know, great people.
[02:44:56.438 --> 02:44:59.623]  There's no question that it's a great thing that Trump won.
[02:44:59.623 --> 02:45:03.067]  There's also no question that you don't just vote for the guy.
[02:45:03.067 --> 02:45:07.112]  He goes in office and then you quit talking about issues that matter to you.
[02:45:07.112 --> 02:45:08.574]  I find it astounding.
[02:45:09.451 --> 02:45:12.073]  That Gary Cohn, Dino Powell, and H.R.
[02:45:12.073 --> 02:45:15.417]  McMaster, they're every day trying to get Trump's ear.
[02:45:15.417 --> 02:45:16.818]  They're trying to influence him.
[02:45:16.818 --> 02:45:18.539]  They're trying to persuade him.
[02:45:18.539 --> 02:45:30.430]  But the minute PJW, Paul the Great, Mike Cernovich, Roger Stone, Stefan Molyneux, Alex Jones, the minute any of us try to influence Trump, suddenly we're the bad guys.
[02:45:30.430 --> 02:45:31.912]  Suddenly we're not supposed to talk.
[02:45:33.092 --> 02:45:39.295]  I think though, judging by the Twitter reaction to this Ivanka Trump thing, which was, I mean, they absolutely decimated her.
[02:45:39.295 --> 02:45:44.357]  The argument is beginning to shift over to our side significantly, especially with her.
[02:45:44.357 --> 02:45:52.701]  Maybe not with Trump directly yet, but, you know, we'll continue to try to have an influence and maintain actual consistent principles rather than being sycophants.
[02:45:52.701 --> 02:45:55.382]  I want to move on to a bit of breaking news and get your take on it, Mike.
[02:45:55.922 --> 02:45:58.423]  And you can flash this up, this is out of Reuters.
[02:45:58.423 --> 02:46:01.403]  Ann Coulter cancels her speech at UC Berkeley.
[02:46:01.403 --> 02:46:11.925]  Conservative commentator Ann Coulter cancels her speech planned for this week at UC Berkeley after a dispute with university officials who feared violent protests over whether a safe venue could be found.
[02:46:11.925 --> 02:46:16.186]  There will be no speech, she wrote in an email to Reuters on Wednesday.
[02:46:16.186 --> 02:46:24.528]  That was basically after the police came out and said, we're going to stand down again and not arrest violent rioters, we're going to allow them to commit crimes.
[02:46:25.208 --> 02:46:35.524]  Mike, how ironic is it that, you know, UC Berkeley, the birthplace of the free speech movement, is now apparently the place where free speech has gone to die?
[02:46:36.630 --> 02:46:46.615]  Yeah, and I don't know if the producers can get to my Twitter, but I posted the tax return to the Young America's Foundation, which was supposed to sponsor this speech.
[02:46:46.615 --> 02:46:54.719]  They are making, in revenue, $35 million, not a typo, $35 million a year in contributions.
[02:46:54.719 --> 02:46:57.380]  They have net assets of $65 million.
[02:46:57.380 --> 02:46:58.561]  I tweeted that out earlier.
[02:46:58.561 --> 02:47:00.942]  I went through the tax returns of the Young America's Foundation.
[02:47:02.668 --> 02:47:06.471]  $35 million a year and they can't hire some Blackwater people?
[02:47:06.471 --> 02:47:17.259]  This just shows how feckless and ineffective and what a waste of money and I will say an outright fraud and scam these so-called conservative nonprofits are.
[02:47:17.659 --> 02:47:22.823]  Could you imagine if you or I had $35 million a year coming in, what we could do with that?
[02:47:22.823 --> 02:47:26.505]  They have $35 million and they say, oh, we can't do the Ann Coulter speech.
[02:47:26.505 --> 02:47:27.346]  Just can't do it.
[02:47:27.346 --> 02:47:33.610]  Oh, we have $65 million cash money in the bank account, but we can't hire some Blackwater people.
[02:47:33.610 --> 02:47:35.912]  We can't do any kind of security thing.
[02:47:35.912 --> 02:47:39.014]  I'm so done with traditional conservatives.
[02:47:39.014 --> 02:47:45.078]  You know, the way I put it on Twitter today is, to the left of me I have Antifa people who want to kill me.
[02:47:45.558 --> 02:47:54.121]  I have feckless conservatives who, despite making $35 million a year, can't figure out, hey, we can figure out a way to have this speech.
[02:47:54.121 --> 02:47:57.822]  And then to the right of me, I have idiots doing Nazi salutes and all that stuff.
[02:47:57.822 --> 02:48:04.825]  And it's just time to find out where actually the critical thinkers are, this big middle, and focus on them.
[02:48:04.825 --> 02:48:09.947]  The Young America Foundation, again, it just shows why conservatives lose.
[02:48:09.947 --> 02:48:12.948]  You have all that money, you have $65 million in the bank account.
[02:48:13.469 --> 02:48:18.504]  And you're not going to take a stand for free speech, make the speech happen.
[02:48:18.504 --> 02:48:18.926]  I'm done.
[02:48:18.926 --> 02:48:19.989]  I'm done with all these people.
[02:48:20.663 --> 02:48:24.326]  And I mean, the word cucked is kind of overused, but that's definitely what happened.
[02:48:24.326 --> 02:48:26.328]  The Y-A-F cucked out.
[02:48:26.328 --> 02:48:28.549]  The headlines out of Gateway punned it.
[02:48:28.549 --> 02:48:32.833]  Young American Foundation pulls support from Coulter event due to Berkeley Police stand down.
[02:48:32.833 --> 02:48:34.955]  We knew the police were going to stand down anyway.
[02:48:34.955 --> 02:48:36.816]  That's what they do every single time.
[02:48:36.816 --> 02:48:39.178]  So of course you have to hire your own security.
[02:48:39.178 --> 02:48:40.219]  They said they wouldn't.
[02:48:40.219 --> 02:48:41.520]  They pulled out immediately.
[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:45.503]  That is the ultimate cuck move, and you're rightly critical of them.
[02:48:45.503 --> 02:48:46.764]  We've got a couple of minutes left, though.
[02:48:46.764 --> 02:48:48.446]  I want to move on that and Coulter speeches.
[02:48:48.886 --> 02:48:50.407]  Not happening by the looks of it.
[02:48:50.407 --> 02:48:52.288]  I'm sure that will continue though.
[02:48:52.288 --> 02:48:55.510]  Christian Bale came out in an article, Mike.
[02:48:55.510 --> 02:48:59.172]  Of course he risked his Hollywood career by calling Trump a dictator.
[02:48:59.172 --> 02:49:00.113]  How edgy!
[02:49:00.113 --> 02:49:01.093]  How brave!
[02:49:01.093 --> 02:49:03.775]  But he also had something to say about you, correct?
[02:49:04.955 --> 02:49:06.837]  Yeah, so I got a good kick out of that.
[02:49:06.837 --> 02:49:15.866]  I wake up in the morning and Christian Bale apparently went for an interview where he should be talking about the Armenian Genocide is an issue near and dear to my heart.
[02:49:15.866 --> 02:49:17.167]  I have many Armenian friends.
[02:49:17.167 --> 02:49:19.730]  There's a strong Armenian community in L.A.
[02:49:19.730 --> 02:49:26.196]  So Christian Bale, there's finally going to be a movie in Hollywood about the Armenian Genocide and how the young Turks and people like Sinka,
[02:49:26.917 --> 02:49:33.002]  People like him, you know, he's his YouTube channel is named after a genocidal hate group.
[02:49:33.002 --> 02:49:37.266]  The Young Turks actually is the equivalent of the Nazi SS organization.
[02:49:37.266 --> 02:49:40.268]  And somehow he's mainstream, you know, we're the bad guys.
[02:49:40.268 --> 02:49:42.310]  So finally, there's going to be a story.
[02:49:42.310 --> 02:49:44.872]  Finally, a big blackbuster Hollywood movie doing it.
[02:49:44.872 --> 02:49:47.274]  Christian Bale goes into an interview.
[02:49:47.834 --> 02:49:49.315]  There's multiple layers to look at.
[02:49:49.315 --> 02:49:50.516]  The big picture is that
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:20.066]  These Hollywood people have lost their mind, and if you Google his name, all he's talking about is Trump, Alex Jones, and Cernovich.
[02:50:20.066 --> 02:50:22.888]  I don't even know what the guy's name is, the movie's called.
[02:50:22.888 --> 02:50:26.571]  Because instead of promoting this movie, this is their derangement syndrome.
[02:50:26.571 --> 02:50:32.276]  Their Trump derangement syndrome, their Putin derangement syndrome, their Alex Jones, their Mike Cernovich derangement syndrome.
[02:50:32.276 --> 02:50:35.879]  Where instead of focusing on this movie that cost $100 million for made,
[02:50:36.579 --> 02:50:38.260]  He's trying to throw shade on me.
[02:50:38.260 --> 02:50:45.342]  But this is why I tell the InfoWarriors, this is why every time I'm on this show, you guys matter.
[02:50:45.342 --> 02:50:46.462]  This is the impact.
[02:50:46.462 --> 02:50:48.303]  Alex Jones is making a difference.
[02:50:48.303 --> 02:50:52.384]  Everybody here who's sharing links to InfoWarriors.com and fighting back.
[02:50:52.384 --> 02:50:55.926]  A-list Hollywood actors cannot stop thinking about us.
[02:50:55.926 --> 02:50:57.426]  Alright, Mike, hold that thought.
[02:50:57.426 --> 02:50:59.027]  We'll be back in the next segment.
[02:50:59.027 --> 02:51:00.007]  Mike Cernovich coming up.
[02:51:00.327 --> 02:51:01.128]  Howdy, folks!
[02:51:01.128 --> 02:51:08.293]  Colonel Sanders here to announce that KFC's new Spicy Crispy Zinger Chicken Sandwich is now available on a $5.00 fill-up for a limited time.
[02:51:08.293 --> 02:51:08.733]  Why?
[02:51:08.733 --> 02:51:17.860]  Because who wants to spend $7.00 on a meal at a burger place when you could spend $5.00 on a hand-breaded Zinger Chicken Sandwich, wages, a cookie, and a drink at KFC?
[02:51:17.860 --> 02:51:19.721]  I mean, we specialize in chicken!
[02:51:19.721 --> 02:51:21.182]  You need another reason?
[02:51:21.182 --> 02:51:22.163]  I didn't think so.
[02:51:22.163 --> 02:51:25.025]  Try the Zinger and a $5.00 fill-up at KFC today.
[02:51:25.025 --> 02:51:25.806]  KFC.
[02:51:25.806 --> 02:51:26.987]  It's finger-lickin' good.
[02:51:26.987 --> 02:51:29.489]  Limited-time offer at participating KFC's TaxExtra.
[02:51:30.309 --> 02:51:35.173]  Did you know that 34% of Americans didn't use any of their vacation days last year?
[02:51:35.173 --> 02:51:36.434]  That is crazy!

[02:53:06.793 --> 02:53:08.395]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:53:08.395 --> 02:53:16.741]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:55:51.029 --> 02:55:53.071]  Support us today!
[02:55:53.071 --> 02:55:59.579]  Mike, just finishing up with your comments about Christian Bale and anything else on your radar here in the final few minutes.
[02:56:00.478 --> 02:56:00.738]  Right.
[02:56:00.738 --> 02:56:05.500]  I mean, that is really why everybody listening should feel so inspired.
[02:56:05.500 --> 02:56:09.161]  You know, Hollywood actors, they cannot stop thinking about us.
[02:56:09.161 --> 02:56:11.122]  They cannot stop talking about us.
[02:56:11.122 --> 02:56:13.322]  They can try to throw shade.
[02:56:13.322 --> 02:56:14.263]  That doesn't matter.
[02:56:14.263 --> 02:56:16.564]  That shows that the truth is getting out there.
[02:56:16.564 --> 02:56:20.185]  And that is why Google wants to shut down InfoWars, why they want to delist them.
[02:56:21.025 --> 02:56:24.426]  That's why Chobani and George Soros are trying to shut down Infowars.
[02:56:24.426 --> 02:56:26.047]  The globalists are after people.
[02:56:26.047 --> 02:56:29.989]  So that's why I tell people is buy the products, use the products.
[02:56:29.989 --> 02:56:30.729]  I don't get paid.
[02:56:30.729 --> 02:56:32.290]  I don't get endorsed.
[02:56:32.290 --> 02:56:36.531]  You know, just for anybody, if I were getting endorsed, I would say it because I believe in making money.
[02:56:36.531 --> 02:56:38.852]  So I would gladly say I'm paid to say this.
[02:56:38.852 --> 02:56:41.293]  I'm the pro guy if I'm pro money.
[02:56:41.293 --> 02:56:42.854]  I don't pretend that I don't like to make money.
[02:56:43.534 --> 02:56:47.458]  So, the message is getting out there and people should feel inspired.
[02:56:47.458 --> 02:56:53.603]  But must also know that you gotta share those links, you gotta spread the message, you have to stand up for what's right and what's true.
[02:56:53.603 --> 02:56:56.666]  Because, I mean, think about it, Paulie Gray.
[02:56:56.666 --> 02:56:59.728]  It's mind-blowing to me that I watched American Psycho.
[02:56:59.728 --> 02:57:01.129]  Like, I knew who Christian Bale was.
[02:57:01.129 --> 02:57:02.891]  He was like a big deal to me.
[02:57:02.891 --> 02:57:04.612]  And now, I don't even care who he is.
[02:57:05.453 --> 02:57:07.155]  I'm a big deal to him.
[02:57:07.155 --> 02:57:09.337]  So you know that Alex Jones is a big deal to him.
[02:57:09.337 --> 02:57:10.278]  You know that you are.
[02:57:10.278 --> 02:57:11.539]  You know that Stefan is.
[02:57:11.539 --> 02:57:14.662]  You know that all the Info Warriors are having an impact.
[02:57:14.662 --> 02:57:17.184]  To me, that is so inspiring.
[02:57:17.184 --> 02:57:19.987]  It really says it all.
[02:57:19.987 --> 02:57:21.888]  OK, Mike, we're going to leave it there.
[02:57:21.888 --> 02:57:25.852]  The blog is medium.com slash at Cernovich.
[02:57:25.852 --> 02:57:29.015]  And you can find Mike at Cernovich on Twitter.
[02:57:29.015 --> 02:57:29.856]  Mike, thanks again.
[02:57:30.751 --> 02:57:31.892]  Always a pleasure.
[02:57:31.892 --> 02:57:33.493]  Okay, we'll be sure to get you back soon.
[02:57:33.493 --> 02:57:34.554]  There goes Mike Cernovich.
[02:57:34.554 --> 02:57:36.195]  Got a final minute here in this segment.
[02:57:36.195 --> 02:57:38.496]  Let's go back to some of the news we have.
[02:57:38.496 --> 02:57:40.077]  SHTF plan reporting.
[02:57:40.077 --> 02:57:42.959]  Think Tank reports ISIS is falling apart.
[02:57:42.959 --> 02:57:47.302]  May actually lead to more terrorist attacks across the globe.
[02:57:47.302 --> 02:57:52.746]  This is RAND Corporation saying, as we know already, that ISIS is basically losing its territory.
[02:57:52.746 --> 02:57:59.531]  They've lost 57% of their territory and 73% of the population that they controlled
[02:58:00.171 --> 02:58:18.083]  That is on the way fast, but they're saying that the outcome, the upshot of that, could be increased terror attacks around the world as ISIS morphs back into a more traditional terrorist group in the mould of Al-Qaeda, not as an actual military fighting force.
[02:58:18.083 --> 02:58:21.885]  So, let's just open the borders even more, like Ivanka Trump says.
[02:58:21.885 --> 02:58:23.146]  Sounds like a great idea, right?
[02:58:23.146 --> 02:58:25.388]  After all, it worked so well in Germany.
[02:58:26.088 --> 02:58:27.148]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:58:27.148 --> 02:58:30.289]  We'll be back with another segment and more breaking news.
[02:58:30.289 --> 02:58:31.890]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live.
[02:58:31.890 --> 02:58:33.510]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:33.510 --> 02:58:35.331]  Don't go away.
[02:58:35.331 --> 02:58:37.251]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:37.251 --> 02:58:38.732]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.789 --> 02:58:52.391]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[02:59:20.954 --> 02:59:31.159]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:59:31.159 --> 02:59:33.201]  And this part is most important.
[02:59:33.201 --> 02:59:39.644]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:59:40.024 --> 02:59:41.445]  That means it's clean.
[02:59:41.445 --> 02:59:42.585]  That means it's pure.
[02:59:42.585 --> 02:59:45.467]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[02:59:45.467 --> 02:59:48.268]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:59:48.268 --> 02:59:53.210]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:59:53.210 --> 02:59:56.472]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:56.472 --> 03:00:05.596]  I've got a tiger in my tail!
[03:00:12.978 --> 03:00:15.222]  He never gives up.
[03:00:15.222 --> 03:00:17.205]  He's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.205 --> 03:00:20.389]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas.
[03:00:20.389 --> 03:00:20.950]  Worldwide.
[03:00:25.843 --> 03:00:30.744]  We're live into the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:30.744 --> 03:00:35.785]  Roger Stone is coming up with the rest of the fourth hour, but for the moment let's go on a news blitz.
[03:00:35.785 --> 03:00:42.486]  RT reports US to launch Minuteman ICBM to show nuclear capabilities amid North Korea tensions.
[03:00:42.486 --> 03:00:44.087]  That continues to build now.
[03:00:44.087 --> 03:00:50.748]  An unarmed intercontinental ballistic missile will be launched from a US Air Force base in California today.
[03:00:51.488 --> 03:00:54.270]  To ensure its effectiveness, readiness and accuracy.
[03:00:54.270 --> 03:00:57.492]  So the war drums continue to be on that.
[03:00:57.492 --> 03:01:02.116]  RT also reports US South Korea staged powerful military drills amid rising tensions.
[03:01:02.116 --> 03:01:06.559]  So they're responding to the North Korean drills that we saw yesterday.
[03:01:06.559 --> 03:01:11.222]  Again, China has said, we're not going to tolerate regime change in North Korea.
[03:01:11.222 --> 03:01:11.983]  They said that!
[03:01:12.603 --> 03:01:14.345]  Nobody seemed to pick it up at the time.
[03:01:14.345 --> 03:01:16.066]  That was absolutely huge.
[03:01:16.066 --> 03:01:16.907]  What's going to happen?
[03:01:16.907 --> 03:01:21.751]  Is there going to be some kind of attack on North Korea's nuclear reactors?
[03:01:21.751 --> 03:01:26.676]  Is there going to be some kind of SEAL Team 6 invasion force that tries to take out the leadership?
[03:01:26.676 --> 03:01:28.517]  And what will North Korea's reaction be?
[03:01:29.457 --> 03:01:31.898]  As I said, South Koreans seem pretty blase about it.
[03:01:31.898 --> 03:01:33.038]  They're used to it at this point.
[03:01:33.038 --> 03:01:34.598]  But could they have normalcy bias?
[03:01:34.598 --> 03:01:39.280]  We have Trump meeting today with 100 senators.
[03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:51.923]  Reuters calls it unusual in a meeting in which he could start to pitch, start to canvas support for senatorial, for congressional authorization for war on North Korea.
[03:01:51.923 --> 03:01:52.684]  Could that happen?
[03:01:52.684 --> 03:01:53.584]  And if so, how soon?
[03:01:54.344 --> 03:01:55.344]  Another report here.
[03:01:55.344 --> 03:02:00.366]  Twitter goes wild over reported death penalty for atheism in Saudi Arabia.
[03:02:00.366 --> 03:02:08.750]  So a bunch of people on Twitter are celebrating the fact that a man is going to be executed for not believing in something in Saudi Arabia.
[03:02:08.750 --> 03:02:10.110]  They're applauding.
[03:02:10.110 --> 03:02:11.651]  Absolutely insane story.
[03:02:11.651 --> 03:02:16.613]  11 year old amputee dies after numerous beatings at Islamic school in Malaysia.
[03:02:17.776 --> 03:02:25.918]  More from the religion of peace, a Malaysian boy who had both legs amputated after allegedly being repeatedly beaten by an assistant warden at a private religious school has died.
[03:02:25.918 --> 03:02:32.940]  Ahmed said the abuse was highlighted when her son begged her to remove him from the school as he could not take the punishment any longer.
[03:02:32.940 --> 03:02:43.122]  We've had the reports before out of other countries, Saudi Arabia, the women being whipped when they try to leave the classroom to go to their male guardian to drive them home, they can't even appear in public.
[03:02:44.878 --> 03:02:51.821]  That's the belief system that we're importing into the West right now and it only seems to be getting worse in terms of radicalization.
[03:02:51.821 --> 03:02:53.961]  It's not moderating.
[03:02:53.961 --> 03:02:55.762]  There's no reformation of Islam.
[03:02:55.762 --> 03:02:59.704]  It only seems to be sliding towards the worse extreme.
[03:02:59.704 --> 03:03:03.025]  We mentioned this story earlier out of the SHTF plan.
[03:03:03.025 --> 03:03:05.126]  Why we have a Second Amendment?
[03:03:05.126 --> 03:03:10.308]  Venezuela plans to give firearms to loyalists so they can purge growing resistance.
[03:03:10.308 --> 03:03:13.069]  So you have those huge street protests in Venezuela.
[03:03:13.729 --> 03:03:23.737]  Over the past couple of weeks, now after enduring shortages of food and medicine for years, as well as a total collapse of the currency, the people of Venezuela have had enough.
[03:03:23.737 --> 03:03:30.283]  They had the protests, now the dictator Maduro is arming his loyalists, 400,000 of them, with firearms.
[03:03:32.805 --> 03:03:36.706]  A gun for every militiaman he tried.
[03:03:36.706 --> 03:03:42.748]  The problem with that is that Venezuela disarmed everybody else back in 2012.
[03:03:42.748 --> 03:03:52.771]  So all those people who are out on the streets protesting against this communist dictatorship basically at this point are now under severe threat and it's never worked.
[03:03:52.771 --> 03:03:56.292]  Socialism on any kind of grand scale has never worked.
[03:03:56.292 --> 03:03:57.572]  Now they're under threat.
[03:03:57.572 --> 03:03:59.453]  We've seen the mass starvation.
[03:03:59.453 --> 03:04:02.314]  We've seen people eating zoo animals.
[03:04:02.754 --> 03:04:05.857]  Now there could be about to be a genocide of bloodbaths.
[03:04:05.857 --> 03:04:08.499]  Isn't socialism grand?
[03:04:08.499 --> 03:04:13.983]  RT reports one in three Europeans ready to dump cash ahead of digital future.
[03:04:13.983 --> 03:04:18.587]  Over a third of Europeans would be happy to abandon cash and rely on electronic payments if they could.
[03:04:19.187 --> 03:04:29.889]  According to a study by ING Bank, quote, a cashless society is not only possible, but could be accepted by at least part of the population in many European nations.
[03:04:29.889 --> 03:04:32.870]  They're ready to give up cash for convenience.
[03:04:32.870 --> 03:04:36.791]  Of course, that means that every single product and purchase can be tracked.
[03:04:36.791 --> 03:04:45.172]  It also means that if you're a bad boy, if you commit a series of thought crimes, they could withdraw permission for you to use that credit card.
[03:04:45.172 --> 03:04:47.093]  But Europe seems ready to embrace it.
[03:04:48.081 --> 03:04:50.946]  Roger Stone is coming up in the next segment.
[03:04:50.946 --> 03:04:53.850]  Alex Jones Show live, breaking news at infowars.com.
[03:04:53.850 --> 03:04:55.533]  Roger will be in studio.
[03:04:55.533 --> 03:04:56.094]  Don't go away.
[03:05:01.400 --> 03:05:06.727]  Google wants to save you from fake news.
[03:05:06.727 --> 03:05:15.239]  And they are rewriting their algorithm to bury misleading, false, and offensive news articles.
[03:05:15.239 --> 03:05:19.104]  Google's parent company, Alphabet Incorporated, recently announced
[03:05:19.304 --> 03:05:19.805]  We're good.
[03:05:44.107 --> 03:05:51.654]  So far, it remains unclear how the state of California was immune to the Russians' propaganda.
[03:05:51.654 --> 03:05:55.398]  I'm Darren McBreen, and you can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[03:06:01.232 --> 03:06:02.813]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:06:02.813 --> 03:06:08.715]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[03:06:08.715 --> 03:06:11.256]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[03:06:11.256 --> 03:06:17.058]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[03:06:17.058 --> 03:06:22.760]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[03:06:23.200 --> 03:06:26.162]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[03:06:26.162 --> 03:06:31.724]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[03:06:31.724 --> 03:06:38.748]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[03:06:38.748 --> 03:06:43.290]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[03:06:43.570 --> 03:06:46.874]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[03:06:46.874 --> 03:06:48.956]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[03:06:48.956 --> 03:06:54.682]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[03:06:54.682 --> 03:06:57.125]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[03:06:57.125 --> 03:06:58.807]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[03:07:00.433 --> 03:07:04.438]  A new shipment of Biotruth Selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:04.438 --> 03:07:05.920]  We've been sold out for months.
[03:07:05.920 --> 03:07:10.987]  Our one-of-a-kind Infowars Life Biotruth Selenium formula is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:10.987 --> 03:07:14.993]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[03:07:15.513 --> 03:07:19.636]  Every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[03:07:19.636 --> 03:07:24.799]  But bio-true selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[03:07:24.799 --> 03:07:28.261]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[03:07:28.261 --> 03:07:32.303]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[03:07:32.423 --> 03:07:40.506]  BioTruth Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield X2 Mason Iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[03:07:40.506 --> 03:07:45.407]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTruth Selenium before we sell it again.
[03:07:45.407 --> 03:07:53.730]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that not only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalists.
[03:07:53.730 --> 03:07:54.470]  A 360 win.
[03:07:54.470 --> 03:07:56.531]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[03:07:56.531 --> 03:07:58.051]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[03:07:58.051 --> 03:07:59.212]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:08:05.385 --> 03:08:09.748]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:08:09.748 --> 03:08:14.272]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:14.272 --> 03:08:17.434]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:08:27.257 --> 03:08:28.518]  Hi, I'm Roger Stone.
[03:08:28.518 --> 03:08:29.779]  Welcome to InfoWars.
[03:08:29.779 --> 03:08:34.642]  I am, of course, sitting in for Alex Jones as he is indisposed.
[03:08:34.642 --> 03:08:38.765]  Big breaking news out of Washington.
[03:08:38.765 --> 03:08:55.157]  An internal struggle inside the Trump White House between those who favored a complete analysis, pardon me, a complete emphasis on the Obamacare repeal and those who thought that Donald Trump's dynamic
[03:08:55.902 --> 03:09:01.665]  Pro-growth plan for tax reform should lead the way.
[03:09:01.665 --> 03:09:21.516]  I can report exclusively here at InfoWars that the President had what I thought was a compelling and perhaps even determinative telephone call with the supply-side economist and growth advocate Larry Kudlow last week.
[03:09:22.236 --> 03:09:37.301]  Kudlow, who continues to supply analysis for CNBC, urged the President to unveil his pro-growth tax reform agenda as soon as possible.
[03:09:37.301 --> 03:09:42.663]  And the White House has done that only about an hour and a half ago.
[03:09:42.663 --> 03:09:46.745]  Now here's a shock for Inside the Beltway Washington.
[03:09:47.452 --> 03:09:54.016]  Donald Trump has proposed exactly what he said he would propose in the campaign.
[03:09:54.016 --> 03:10:04.762]  That is a sweeping John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan type tax cut for all Americans because a rising tide lifts all boats.
[03:10:04.762 --> 03:10:12.246]  But also the entirely crucial, I would say vital, reduction on corporate income taxes.
[03:10:12.990 --> 03:10:27.181]  The reason China and Mexico and Japan are taking us to the cleaners on economic issues and on growth is because all of them have a corporate tax rate that is substantially lower than the United States.
[03:10:28.243 --> 03:10:37.394]  One can see why an American corporation would choose to do business in those venues because it is immediately more profitable.
[03:10:37.394 --> 03:10:47.465]  Donald Trump, who has threatened to use tariffs throughout his late political career, I have always argued that the tariffs that he mentions
[03:10:48.326 --> 03:10:55.288]  If the corporate tax rate in the United States was below that of China, Mexico, Japan and others, it would really be an inducement.
[03:11:11.403 --> 03:11:20.766]  For American companies to move back to the United States, to expand here, to hire here, to build new facilities here.
[03:11:20.766 --> 03:11:31.689]  And therefore, I have always believed that a pro-growth, dynamic economy is the absolute cornerstone of the Donald Trump reform agenda.
[03:11:32.509 --> 03:11:44.814]  Significant economic growth would buy the president both political time to address the country's other problems, but also could conceivably give him a bump in revenues.
[03:11:44.814 --> 03:11:56.358]  Now, there are some analysts who say that the president's plan, when looked at it in a static analysis, will cause a billions of dollars in revenue shortfall.
[03:11:57.247 --> 03:12:02.609]  But our history under President Ronald Reagan indicates otherwise.
[03:12:02.609 --> 03:12:13.812]  In fact, every year Reagan was president, federal revenues went up as a result of his pro-growth, supply-side oriented tax cuts.
[03:12:13.812 --> 03:12:20.594]  The problem we had in the Reagan years, indeed the problem we still have today, is a spending problem.
[03:12:21.320 --> 03:12:26.505]  We also have a strange sequence of events this week in Washington, where I'm sure many have seen that the
[03:12:42.737 --> 03:13:00.714]  The CIA director, Mr. Pompeo, has begun what appears to be a campaign of vilification and perhaps even a campaign to prosecute WikiLeaks founder and journalist Julian Assange.
[03:13:00.714 --> 03:13:05.218]  Let me go through this because it is something we've discussed a lot here.
[03:13:05.218 --> 03:13:07.561]  Assange is not a Russian asset.
[03:13:08.644 --> 03:13:21.756]  Our intelligence assets, pardon me, our intelligence agencies continue to insist that he is, but when pressed for proof, they say, well, that is our assessment.
[03:13:21.756 --> 03:13:23.598]  Listen for that code word, folks.
[03:13:23.598 --> 03:13:32.086]  When the intelligence agencies, when the CIA or the FBI tell them it is their assessment, that means they're guessing.
[03:13:32.958 --> 03:13:34.963]  Or that they're projecting.
[03:13:34.963 --> 03:13:37.168]  Assange is a journalist.
[03:13:37.168 --> 03:13:41.858]  And he has done this country a service by exposing massive corruption.
[03:13:42.617 --> 03:13:50.499]  We don't know that he has broken the law because we do not know the source of the documents that he has made public.
[03:13:50.499 --> 03:14:03.281]  The entire effort to vilify Assange as a foreign agent is an obvious attempt to distract Americans from the substance of what WikiLeaks has made public.
[03:14:03.281 --> 03:14:09.943]  And in fact, WikiLeaks proves in the documents that they did publish
[03:14:10.973 --> 03:14:16.897]  That Hillary Clinton herself was deeply involved in campaign dirty tricks.
[03:14:16.897 --> 03:14:27.504]  Something that they ran Richard Nixon out of office for, even though there was never any proof that he had knowledge in advance.
[03:14:28.715 --> 03:14:29.836]  Of course, of course.
[03:14:46.046 --> 03:14:50.330]  They proved corruption, in some cases treason.
[03:14:50.330 --> 03:15:01.201]  They proved the collusion between the mainstream media and the Clinton campaign to write the news narrative in a way that benefited Hillary.
[03:15:01.201 --> 03:15:06.547]  They exposed massive hypocrisy by the Clintons.
[03:15:06.547 --> 03:15:08.188]  The internals of their efforts
[03:15:08.789 --> 03:15:20.773]  To silence the various women assaulted by Bill and then later threatened, bullied, and intimidated by Hillary Clinton.
[03:15:20.773 --> 03:15:37.338]  Now would be a superb time to also mention the fact that InfoWars, along with other alternative media sites like Breitbart, Daily News, StoneColdTruth.com, StoneZone.com are under horrendous attack
[03:15:37.938 --> 03:15:40.059]  From the tech left.
[03:15:40.059 --> 03:15:41.180]  That's right, folks.
[03:15:41.180 --> 03:15:49.424]  Facebook, Google, Amazon, and others are conspiring to limit our reach to you.
[03:15:49.424 --> 03:15:53.165]  And that's why InfoWars needs your support.
[03:15:53.165 --> 03:16:04.271]  Now, you can have a win-win situation by going to the InfoWars.com store and ordering a number of the outstanding products there.
[03:16:05.211 --> 03:16:11.934]  I recently visited Austin, where I did some live appearances here on InfoWars.
[03:16:11.934 --> 03:16:18.397]  And while there, I actually managed to obtain a tube of the non-fluoride toothpaste.
[03:16:18.397 --> 03:16:23.579]  In this case, the peppermint flavor, which I found to be superior.
[03:16:23.579 --> 03:16:26.640]  I gave the bubblegum flavor to my grandchildren.
[03:16:27.492 --> 03:16:29.935]  This is the best toothpaste I have ever used.
[03:16:29.935 --> 03:16:38.544]  First of all, it is interesting that the tube is designed so that you use a minimum amount of it, stretching the life of your supply.
[03:16:38.544 --> 03:16:39.425]  There's no waste.
[03:16:39.425 --> 03:16:46.933]  But secondarily, better even than the dental strips you can buy in the drugstore or the whitening process at some dentists,
[03:16:47.614 --> 03:16:49.615]  This product really works.
[03:16:49.615 --> 03:16:59.417]  So let me urge you, go to the Infowars.com store and pick up your non-fluoride toothpaste, now available in two different flavors.
[03:16:59.417 --> 03:17:01.758]  I strongly, strongly recommend it.
[03:17:01.758 --> 03:17:09.760]  Big division in my family, some like the Super Blue, while others are hanging tough for the Pempermint flavor.
[03:17:11.451 --> 03:17:16.894]  Now, we are not only on the edge of our seats.
[03:17:16.894 --> 03:17:30.321]  This morning, my attorneys received a call from the House Intelligence Committee telling us that they would be sending us a letter shortly.
[03:17:30.321 --> 03:17:34.223]  We've been watching the facts, folks, but so far, no letter.
[03:17:35.183 --> 03:17:51.769]  I have expressed some skepticism that the House or Senate Intelligence Committee would have the cojones to call me because I will put the lie to this entire myth of Russian collusion with Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:17:51.769 --> 03:17:52.449]  That's right.
[03:17:52.449 --> 03:18:04.273]  I'm going to take the exact words of the Democrats on both committees and one Republican, John McCain, and demonstrate how they have been systematically false.
[03:18:04.993 --> 03:18:12.080]  And how they have included supposition, conjecture, and coincidence and tried to call it evidence.
[03:18:12.080 --> 03:18:14.483]  Evidence of crime.
[03:18:14.483 --> 03:18:18.407]  Evidence of a violation of our national security.
[03:18:18.407 --> 03:18:23.232]  Because of course, collusion with the Russians would constitute treason.
[03:18:24.266 --> 03:18:29.194]  Now, I recognize that some Democrats call me a dirty trickster.
[03:18:29.194 --> 03:18:32.138]  Most of them are Democrats that I have beaten.
[03:18:32.138 --> 03:18:34.662]  So I wear it as a badge.
[03:18:34.662 --> 03:18:39.249]  But as I have said before, there is one trick that is not in my bag.
[03:18:39.850 --> 03:18:40.850]  Treason.
[03:18:40.850 --> 03:18:44.111]  It's an insult, and it must be addressed.
[03:18:44.111 --> 03:18:47.351]  Thanks for tuning in with us today at InfoWars.
[03:18:47.351 --> 03:18:53.813]  Please, again, go to the InfoWars.com store and pick up some of these excellent products.
[03:18:53.813 --> 03:19:04.775]  You'll be glad you did, and you will help build our war chest, which is severely depleted, to fight the tech left as they attempt to strangle our free speech rights.
[03:19:04.775 --> 03:19:05.895]  I'll be right back.
[03:19:18.711 --> 03:19:21.173]  I'm sorry, we had a little programming issue there.
[03:19:21.173 --> 03:19:26.896]  Again, thanks for joining us on InfoWars, and I will be back sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:20:00.613 --> 03:20:03.556]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's.
[03:20:03.556 --> 03:20:08.561]  In an epic battle of David versus Goliath, in the early 1980s, a child was born.
[03:20:08.561 --> 03:20:09.502]  Two of them, actually.
[03:20:09.502 --> 03:20:11.564]  Their names were Jeff and Andy.
[03:20:11.564 --> 03:20:15.908]  Time went by, they developed facial hair, and one day, something happened.
[03:20:15.908 --> 03:20:18.030]  Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors.
[03:20:18.490 --> 03:20:22.434]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all.
[03:20:22.434 --> 03:20:31.342]  They hired the best designers, they bought a 95-year-old German blade factory, and they started selling high-quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers.
[03:20:31.342 --> 03:20:33.684]  How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[03:20:33.684 --> 03:20:35.206]  By threatening to sue their pants off.
[03:20:35.666 --> 03:20:42.029]  Don't worry, Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants, and a relentless dream to give all guys a great shave at a great price.
[03:20:42.029 --> 03:20:43.349]  Try Harry's free.
[03:20:43.349 --> 03:20:48.931]  They'll send you a razor with five German blades, foaming shave gel, and even a travel blade cover when you sign up.

[03:24:05.456 --> 03:24:07.857]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:24:07.857 --> 03:24:10.598]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:24:18.945 --> 03:24:20.667]  Welcome back.
[03:24:20.667 --> 03:24:29.697]  I'm Roger Stone here at InfoWars, recently called Trump's albino assassin by the comedian Bill Maher.
[03:24:29.697 --> 03:24:33.221]  It's now a title I wear as a badge of honor.
[03:24:34.159 --> 03:24:41.362]  The doings in Berkeley are deeply disturbing to anyone who believes in the First Amendment or free speech.
[03:24:41.362 --> 03:24:52.246]  You may recall that immediately after the election, Alex Jones warned that while the left was stunned, they would soon wake up and they would begin a national spasm.
[03:24:52.246 --> 03:24:58.488]  After the first few riots, Alex Jones correctly predicted that things were about to get much worse.
[03:24:58.488 --> 03:25:00.749]  Today, I join Alex Jones in warning you
[03:25:01.539 --> 03:25:04.481]  The worst is yet to come.
[03:25:04.481 --> 03:25:12.988]  Universities have become the new site for the war on free speech.
[03:25:12.988 --> 03:25:24.158]  How ironic that Berkeley, where the free speech movement was founded by the leftist radical Mario Savio, is now the site for this clash.
[03:25:25.003 --> 03:25:30.990]  The leftist spasm is making its way through the liberal run of cities as well as universities.
[03:25:30.990 --> 03:25:39.319]  The universities have become the centers for indoctrination where communists, anarchists, virulent socialists and their ilk
[03:25:40.040 --> 03:25:46.529]  Gather freely to plot to plan the demise of this great nation.
[03:25:46.529 --> 03:25:48.372]  They're no longer plotting, folks.
[03:25:48.372 --> 03:25:55.201]  They're now well-funded with insane Democrat money and evil wealthy oligarchs like George Soros.
[03:25:56.437 --> 03:26:00.460]  They're sponsoring, through their dollars, these actions in the streets.
[03:26:00.460 --> 03:26:14.149]  And since their money comes from the deep state and their corporate supporters, and they're following orders from the liberal elite to crush all dissent, well then, in TIFA, they are the fascists.
[03:26:14.149 --> 03:26:21.735]  My good friend Ann Coulter was courageously planning to go to Berkeley and confront the demonstrators.
[03:26:22.688 --> 03:26:27.571]  I sent her an email two days ago, fearing for her personal safety.
[03:26:27.571 --> 03:26:40.939]  And now, despite the fact that I dislike retreat in the face of these bullies, these cowards, my personal regard for Anne leads me to believe that she has made the right decision.
[03:26:40.939 --> 03:26:47.923]  She is too important a voice to be sacrificed to a bunch of punks, a bunch of hoodlums.
[03:26:48.783 --> 03:26:52.584]  Who have now incorporated the entire left tactic.
[03:26:52.584 --> 03:27:00.526]  You see, they can't compete with us in the battleground, or I should say the battlefield, of ideas.
[03:27:00.526 --> 03:27:03.307]  They can only silence us.
[03:27:03.307 --> 03:27:15.751]  You see it on the tech left attempt to manipulate the algorithms so that fewer of you will see InfoWars in your email box on the net.
[03:27:16.471 --> 03:27:24.139]  Yes, even the Google, pardon me, even the internet giants like Yahoo are in on this act.
[03:27:24.139 --> 03:27:35.371]  We at Stone Cold Truth have seen a substantial drop in the opens of our outgoing sign-up, white list, list of followers.
[03:27:36.452 --> 03:27:47.398]  It is not just the internet where we are being harassed, or I should say, not just the net-based sites, but it is also the function of our email.
[03:27:47.398 --> 03:27:49.179]  Where will this go?
[03:27:49.179 --> 03:27:58.385]  My idea is simply this, that the folks at Breitbart, at InfoWars, at Town Hall, at The Daily Caller,
[03:27:58.925 --> 03:28:18.742]  That they, perhaps led by Alex Jones, convene a meeting of all of those on the alternative media right to determine whether it is a petition to the Trump Antitrust Department of the Justice Department or whether it is a class action lawsuit.
[03:28:19.463 --> 03:28:24.268]  We cannot let the left put the toothpaste back in the tube.
[03:28:24.268 --> 03:28:35.380]  We simply cannot let the mainstream media, ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, and Fox regain their mainstream media
[03:28:36.633 --> 03:28:37.874]  We're good to go.
[03:28:57.148 --> 03:29:11.513]  It is ironic that the liberals are now using the tactics of Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler and other dictators who know the key to controlling the people is to cut off their flow of information.
[03:29:11.513 --> 03:29:25.718]  Help us in this vital fight by going to the Infowars.com store, get your Trump is my President t-shirt or any of the other great products because you can not only benefit yourself, you can help gird us financially for the battle ahead.
[03:29:26.359 --> 03:29:29.469]  I'm Roger Stone, and I'll be right back at InfoWars.
[03:29:49.850 --> 03:29:53.777]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.777 --> 03:29:56.462]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.831 --> 03:30:08.000]  North Korea continues to threaten the United States, this time saying they are ready to sink the U.S.
[03:30:08.000 --> 03:30:11.824]  aircraft carrier Carl Vinson with a single strike.
[03:30:11.824 --> 03:30:20.835]  They also claim that their military has the ability to reach the continental United States, and they are now in possession of a massive hydrogen bomb.
[03:30:21.075 --> 03:30:31.431]  Meanwhile, the White House held an emergency meeting over North Korea that included a phone call between President Trump and China over the escalating tensions in the region.
[03:30:31.431 --> 03:30:36.359]  And China says World War III is inevitable as North Korea prepares
[03:30:36.679 --> 03:30:37.040]  We're good.
[03:31:00.481 --> 03:31:01.302]  Hey, everyone!
[03:31:01.302 --> 03:31:07.446]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:31:07.446 --> 03:31:09.528]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:31:09.528 --> 03:31:19.796]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:31:19.796 --> 03:31:25.781]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:31:26.241 --> 03:31:41.169]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[03:31:41.189 --> 03:31:41.590]  I think so.
[03:32:00.458 --> 03:32:02.299]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[03:32:02.299 --> 03:32:08.902]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[03:32:08.902 --> 03:32:12.063]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:12.063 --> 03:32:21.847]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[03:32:21.847 --> 03:32:22.688]  Caveman.
[03:32:22.688 --> 03:32:27.750]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[03:32:27.750 --> 03:32:29.871]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[03:32:30.171 --> 03:32:33.312]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[03:32:33.312 --> 03:32:38.453]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[03:32:38.453 --> 03:32:46.594]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[03:32:46.594 --> 03:32:54.376]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[03:32:54.376 --> 03:32:59.197]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLife.com today.
[03:33:21.400 --> 03:33:25.201]  Well, as you can see and hear, I'm not Alex Jones.
[03:33:25.201 --> 03:33:29.283]  I'm Roger Stone, but I'm very proud to be sitting in for him today.
[03:33:29.283 --> 03:33:34.084]  You know, in the last election, if you had read my book, The Making of the President 2016,
[03:33:36.412 --> 03:33:54.980]  You know that Clinton's never recognized the power of the issue of Bill Clinton's systematic abuse through sexual assault and rape of literally dozens of women.
[03:33:55.925 --> 03:34:03.131]  Last week, Hillary Clinton came out and said that misogyny was the reason she lost the election.
[03:34:03.131 --> 03:34:07.034]  Well, this is the only time Hillary Clinton and I have agreed on anything.
[03:34:07.034 --> 03:34:08.855]  She's absolutely right.
[03:34:08.855 --> 03:34:25.169]  Her husband's misogyny against women is one of the key factors that allowed Donald Trump to get 53% of the vote among white women, something that no political pundit or pollster or the mainstream media saw coming.
[03:34:26.300 --> 03:34:29.744]  Is this issue going to be swept under the table?
[03:34:29.744 --> 03:34:35.189]  We have a special report that reminds us that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:34:35.189 --> 03:34:36.751]  Let's roll that.
[03:34:36.751 --> 03:34:41.876]  You're facing the greatest threat, not just the existence of info wars, but the free speech in this country.
[03:34:42.566 --> 03:34:56.012]  You've seen the mainstream news articles admitting Google and others plan to shut down the new right, libertarians, nationalists, not just here, but all over Europe and other parts of the world, who are standing up to the unelected authoritarian system of globalism.
[03:34:56.012 --> 03:34:57.033]  Can you do that?
[03:34:57.033 --> 03:34:59.494]  You can't do that!
[03:34:59.494 --> 03:35:01.255]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:35:01.255 --> 03:35:02.555]  He raped Monita Broderick.
[03:35:02.555 --> 03:35:04.096]  The media covered it up.
[03:35:04.096 --> 03:35:05.277]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:35:05.277 --> 03:35:07.758]  I want everybody to know Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:35:10.886 --> 03:35:11.366]  Public space!
[03:35:11.366 --> 03:35:13.467]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[03:35:13.467 --> 03:35:16.909]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[03:35:16.909 --> 03:35:18.730]  You don't call yourself a rapist!
[03:35:18.730 --> 03:35:20.190]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[03:35:20.190 --> 03:35:21.851]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[03:35:21.851 --> 03:35:23.192]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[03:35:23.192 --> 03:35:24.832]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[03:35:24.832 --> 03:35:26.813]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[03:35:26.813 --> 03:35:34.817]  Also the- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:35:34.817 --> 03:35:35.877]  No, don't be like them.
[03:35:35.877 --> 03:35:36.537]  Give them a hand.
[03:35:36.537 --> 03:35:37.518]  They've had a bad week.
[03:35:39.511 --> 03:35:45.855]  They've had a bad week.
[03:35:45.855 --> 03:35:53.020]  Now, moments later, right after this press conference, Donald Trump got up, walked out, and went straight to the debate.
[03:35:53.020 --> 03:35:54.641]  And guess who went with him?
[03:35:54.641 --> 03:35:55.502]  That's right.
[03:35:55.502 --> 03:36:00.785]  Right there in the audience were Bill Clinton's rape accusers.
[03:36:00.785 --> 03:36:03.707]  And then the gloves came off.
[03:36:03.707 --> 03:36:05.629]  If you look at Bill Clinton,
[03:36:06.509 --> 03:36:07.270]  Far worse.
[03:36:07.270 --> 03:36:09.532]  Minor words and his was action.
[03:36:09.532 --> 03:36:11.093]  His was what he's done to women.
[03:36:11.093 --> 03:36:17.638]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[03:36:17.638 --> 03:36:28.046]  Now, we can put on screen, Mike Cernovich has been around for years, but he's one of the top bloggers now in the world because he has such amazing sources inside the Trump administration and more.
[03:36:28.046 --> 03:36:29.807]  There it is from Fox News.
[03:36:29.807 --> 03:36:34.031]  Pro-Trump blogger Cernovich getting big scoops mainstream media attention.
[03:36:34.631 --> 03:36:37.514]  And they have to admit, okay, these are big scoops.
[03:36:37.514 --> 03:36:43.420]  She had a seizure and froze up walking into her motorcade.
[03:36:43.420 --> 03:36:44.762]  Well, she had pneumonia.
[03:36:44.762 --> 03:36:46.003]  How do you know?
[03:36:46.003 --> 03:36:46.824]  Who told you that?
[03:36:46.824 --> 03:36:48.505]  Well, the campaign told us that.
[03:36:48.505 --> 03:36:50.227]  Why would you trust the campaign?
[03:36:50.227 --> 03:36:54.772]  The point is, you didn't talk to anybody who'd ever examined Hillary Clinton.
[03:36:54.772 --> 03:36:57.154]  I don't take anything Hillary Clinton is going to say.
[03:36:58.689 --> 03:36:59.310]  At all.
[03:36:59.310 --> 03:36:59.730]  It's true.
[03:36:59.730 --> 03:37:01.572]  I'm not going to take her on her word.
[03:37:01.572 --> 03:37:04.294]  The media says we're not going to take Donald Trump on his word.
[03:37:04.294 --> 03:37:08.457]  And that's why we are in these different universes.
[03:37:08.457 --> 03:37:09.078]  That's right.
[03:37:09.078 --> 03:37:10.619]  And they didn't show it.
[03:37:10.619 --> 03:37:12.981]  She then fully falls down on her face.
[03:37:12.981 --> 03:37:15.884]  She repeated the same lie they've done over and over again.
[03:37:15.884 --> 03:37:17.205]  You can search engine on YouTube.
[03:37:19.780 --> 03:37:23.425]  TV host says Hillary didn't fall down.
[03:37:23.425 --> 03:37:30.354]  And then they show her where she wobbles and they grab her arm, not her falling on her face and being drug into the vehicle.
[03:37:30.354 --> 03:37:33.438]  Then they say we lied about that!
[03:37:33.438 --> 03:37:36.561]  Now, Cernovich came to Austin to visit with us.
[03:37:37.763 --> 03:37:50.457]  And we were doing a broadcast about censorship and he was sent by his Google insider of five years and I've seen the intel, I've seen the text messages, I've seen the basic identity to document this.
[03:37:50.457 --> 03:37:57.084]  The internal Google order and memorandum that represents absolute total fraud
[03:37:57.885 --> 03:37:58.866]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:38:11.645 --> 03:38:19.787]  They direct their contractors to go vote us down, and then they say, oh, but this is all free, fair, and open.
[03:38:19.787 --> 03:38:21.687]  Again, a total fraud on his face.
[03:38:21.687 --> 03:38:36.310]  They then misrepresent what we say and what we do, and say that we're not credible, playing clips of Ron Paul, Vladimir Putin, and Assad saying that the Syrian gas attack was probably a false flag.
[03:38:36.310 --> 03:38:40.691]  In our article they list, they say we give no proof, we list
[03:38:42.835 --> 03:38:49.011]  Sky Television and other mainstream news outlets with the interviews.
[03:38:49.011 --> 03:38:49.793]  So understand.
[03:38:50.783 --> 03:38:56.207]  We're being delisted and blocked and put into an electronic gulag that Matt Drudge warned about.
[03:38:56.207 --> 03:38:59.048]  They at 60 Minutes are so out of touch.
[03:38:59.048 --> 03:39:01.550]  They thought, boy, we got Cernovich now.
[03:39:01.550 --> 03:39:07.374]  We got the alternative media now because Hillary Clinton is clearly healthy because the campaign told us.
[03:39:07.374 --> 03:39:11.056]  In their world, that made us look bad.
[03:39:11.056 --> 03:39:11.997]  It's unbelievable.
[03:39:11.997 --> 03:39:14.618]  That really is how out of touch they are and how clueless they are.
[03:39:14.618 --> 03:39:17.080]  And that is why they want to censor us because
[03:39:17.720 --> 03:39:23.163]  They are so ineffective and so out of touch that people can't believe or trust them now.
[03:39:23.163 --> 03:39:27.065]  Even in an editing room with our full-time production staff.
[03:39:27.065 --> 03:39:28.565]  One-on-one, they cannot take us on.
[03:39:32.961 --> 03:39:36.364]  All right, that is the great Mike Cernovich.
[03:39:36.364 --> 03:39:37.384]  My hat's off to him.
[03:39:37.384 --> 03:39:42.988]  He is doing yeoman service to the country, breaking blockbuster stories like this.
[03:39:42.988 --> 03:39:58.340]  If you go back and look, you will see that Hillary Clinton's campaign issued a formal press release when the questions about her health first surfaced, blaming conspiracy theorists Roger Stone and Alex Jones for spreading disinformation.
[03:39:59.341 --> 03:40:01.382]  Why did we know she was sick?
[03:40:01.382 --> 03:40:03.824]  We saw it with our own two eyes.
[03:40:03.824 --> 03:40:05.225]  She had no stamina.
[03:40:05.225 --> 03:40:07.426]  She was constantly falling down.
[03:40:07.426 --> 03:40:11.649]  She needed help getting up one row of stairs.
[03:40:11.649 --> 03:40:17.853]  And she had a physician or probably a nurse's assistant with her at all times.
[03:40:17.853 --> 03:40:22.936]  I also noticed there was always an ambulance standing by at her public events.
[03:40:23.516 --> 03:40:31.001]  So my hat's off to Alex Jones and Cernovich for reminding the American people about the lies of the Clintons.
[03:40:31.001 --> 03:40:42.348]  I think it would be an excellent time to point out to you that there's 53% off on the caveman formula at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:40:42.348 --> 03:40:46.051]  Now this formula is a basic building block
[03:40:46.571 --> 03:41:00.439]  For nutrition, to promote health, strength of bones, clear skin, and addresses all in the most fundamental ways, the respiratory and circulatory systems.
[03:41:00.439 --> 03:41:02.280]  It boosts the immunity.
[03:41:02.280 --> 03:41:12.466]  This is going back to the absolutely best raw ingredients that scientists have known for years are fundamental to our health.
[03:41:13.246 --> 03:41:26.378]  Alex Jones and his crew spent a lot of time formulating Caveman and the special bone broth that is made this product so widely praised by those who have endorsed it.
[03:41:26.378 --> 03:41:28.600]  These are the actual users.
[03:41:28.980 --> 03:41:31.121]  You can look at the testimonials.
[03:41:31.121 --> 03:41:48.592]  So if you want to help the fight for freedom, if you want to crush those who want to crush the First Amendment, who would snuff out our right to free speech, go to TheInfoWarStore.com and get Caveman or any of the other fine products there.
[03:41:49.432 --> 03:41:54.235]  You can't buy these kinds of things in the local drugstore, folks.
[03:41:54.235 --> 03:42:10.303]  Sure, there are others who put forward claims, but Alex Jones and the people at InfoWars are absolutely stringent about finding the very best ingredients, testing it thoroughly before they offer it at the InfoWars store.
[03:42:11.392 --> 03:42:25.611]  The other thing I wanted to touch on today is the fact that I first became aware of Alex Jones and what was going on in Four Wars based on his courageous reporting on the globalist groups such as the Bilderbergs.
[03:42:26.192 --> 03:42:30.513]  The Club of Rome in the 1960s was a powerful consortium of international elites.
[03:42:30.513 --> 03:42:36.474]  Much of their private corporate meetings was declassified in the late 1990s in a congressional data dump.
[03:42:55.234 --> 03:42:55.575]  The first link.
[03:43:12.573 --> 03:43:38.053]  Goes to an article that came out in November of this year just a month ago at the World Economic Forum That is basically the mouthpiece of the private Bilderberg group and secretive Club of Rome the very same members attend this and they want a 100 trillion dollar global tax every decade that's paid out every year they want the state running your family they admit it all and the exhibits in the article
[03:43:39.125 --> 03:43:43.048]  In Snyder's article are again the establishment themselves.
[03:43:43.048 --> 03:43:51.494]  In this article alone, from the perspective of a woman, she basically admits she has Stockholm Syndrome, but says it's good.
[03:43:51.494 --> 03:43:53.355]  She's given up her free will.
[03:43:53.355 --> 03:43:55.376]  Everything she does is surveilled.
[03:43:55.376 --> 03:43:58.799]  AI computers read her mind in 2030.
[03:43:58.799 --> 03:44:00.280]  The robots shop for her food.
[03:44:00.600 --> 03:44:01.922]  She eats what she's told.
[03:44:01.922 --> 03:44:03.444]  She goes where she's told.
[03:44:03.444 --> 03:44:10.373]  She lives in a compact city, 200 square foot coffin apartment and it's so liberating and it's so good for the earth.
[03:44:10.373 --> 03:44:15.580]  But there are bad people that live out in collapsing old houses and hide from the government.
[03:44:16.141 --> 03:44:38.713]  Outside the new centralized megacities that I warned you about in Endgame, and she just doesn't like them because they're bad, they didn't trust the government, they were racist, and had to be dealt with, and she knows the AI computers read her mind and track everything she does, but the world's a better place, and she submits to it, and gives in to it, and just hopes they never use it against her.
[03:44:39.173 --> 03:44:49.737]  The Club of Rome, financed by the UN and others, said we want to promote that humans are bad and have a system to tax energy worldwide to fund a corporate world government.
[03:44:49.737 --> 03:44:53.898]  We also want to be able to stifle certain countries, corporations, individuals.
[03:44:55.424 --> 03:45:00.409]  From developing and using what we call disruptive technologies.
[03:45:00.409 --> 03:45:06.075]  Zero point energy and things like that that they knew were theoretically possible even in the 1960s.
[03:45:06.075 --> 03:45:10.139]  And of course, were discovered in the 80s and the media discredited all that in the 90s.
[03:45:10.139 --> 03:45:14.183]  It's been now proven everywhere, but you just never hear about it.
[03:45:14.183 --> 03:45:19.448]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:45:21.076 --> 03:45:25.500]  Once free nations are slaves to the will of a tiny elite.
[03:45:25.500 --> 03:45:29.143]  The dawn of a new dark age is upon mankind.
[03:45:29.143 --> 03:45:44.617]  But folks thought that it was like a science fiction dystopia film even though it was real quotes and real video of world leaders in the last 80 years calling for an authoritarian science-based global dictatorship.
[03:45:45.700 --> 03:45:55.146]  Fast forward to late 2016, and much of what we put in the film and predicted as near future developments has already happened.
[03:45:55.146 --> 03:45:58.688]  And the rest of it is now being publicly announced.
[03:45:58.688 --> 03:46:01.189]  A lot of people ask me, Alex, how did you know all of this?
[03:46:01.189 --> 03:46:02.530]  Are you psychic?
[03:46:02.530 --> 03:46:05.772]  And I explain to them again, have you watched the film?
[03:46:05.772 --> 03:46:09.334]  It's video clips, it's film clips, it's newsreels.
[03:46:09.334 --> 03:46:10.635]  Going back to the 20s and 30s,
[03:46:12.301 --> 03:46:15.642]  Where they were admitting all of this.
[03:46:15.642 --> 03:46:29.844]  Pre-Hitler, eugenics and this new science-based control of human procreation, compact cities, you name it, was accepted by the public because they believed anything scientific must be good.
[03:46:29.844 --> 03:46:35.565]  But there are hundreds of different types of advanced technologies that have been developed on energy, communications, you name it.
[03:46:35.565 --> 03:46:36.906]  They get shelved.
[03:46:36.906 --> 03:46:38.666]  That's incontrovertible, that's admitted.
[03:46:39.606 --> 03:46:40.488]  Here's the headline.
[03:46:40.488 --> 03:46:41.789]  Welcome to 2030.
[03:46:41.789 --> 03:46:46.815]  I own nothing, have no privacy, and life has never been better.
[03:46:46.815 --> 03:46:52.322]  And see, for someone awake, you're like, this is insulting, or this is written from the perspective of someone saying this is bad.
[03:46:52.322 --> 03:46:52.863]  No.
[03:46:52.863 --> 03:46:54.645]  They're pushing this.
[03:46:54.645 --> 03:46:55.125]  Officially.
[03:46:55.706 --> 03:47:02.892]  Taxes by the mile, not being able to have a car, only getting meat once a year, the government telling you by high school what you're going to be when you grow up.
[03:47:02.892 --> 03:47:04.634]  Total centralization.
[03:47:04.634 --> 03:47:08.557]  I'm V. I'm looking forward to showing you around Plandopolis today.
[03:47:08.557 --> 03:47:09.578]  Are you ready to go?
[03:47:09.578 --> 03:47:13.001]  Have you got your calorie card open on your smartphone?
[03:47:13.001 --> 03:47:15.564]  I registered your visit with Slick Travel Corp.
[03:47:15.564 --> 03:47:18.927]  the other day, so they've allotted you a journey time to match mine.
[03:47:18.927 --> 03:47:21.289]  It makes so much sense, doesn't it?
[03:47:28.612 --> 03:47:33.204]  Thank you very much to the folks at InfoWars for that terrific special report.
[03:47:34.461 --> 03:47:40.065]  The entire international community has all eyes on the nation of France.
[03:47:40.065 --> 03:47:46.689]  The French, as you may remember, were a key ally of the colonists in the American Revolution.
[03:47:46.689 --> 03:47:53.034]  And now, savvy folks know that the once great France is in deep, deep trouble.
[03:47:53.034 --> 03:47:57.597]  Paris, once the most vibrant and lively city, a center of the arts,
[03:47:58.177 --> 03:48:11.968]  has already fallen to the Islamic hordes of young men who rape and pillage and destroy public property in what can only be called a rampage.
[03:48:11.968 --> 03:48:18.773]  Just as Donald Trump was the last best choice to save this country, it is my personal view
[03:48:19.393 --> 03:48:27.535]  That Marie Le Pen, who is not her father, is the last best chance for the French people.
[03:48:27.535 --> 03:48:31.575]  The situation is very analogous to what we saw here in the United States.
[03:48:31.575 --> 03:48:43.558]  The pollsters and the pundits, the same who told us that Trump cannot win, who told us that the Brexit vote would fail, well now they're telling us that Le Pen cannot win.
[03:48:44.398 --> 03:48:50.323]  It's very easy to see why the liberal press would go all in for Emmanuel Macron.
[03:48:50.323 --> 03:48:58.590]  He could very well be a Rothschild puppet, having the potential to have been groomed for this job from an early age.
[03:48:58.590 --> 03:49:08.598]  He has a wife who is a well-known liberal, almost 25 years his senior, who began to woo him when he was a child and she was 40.
[03:49:10.279 --> 03:49:24.192]  He is also certainly groomed during the stint as a Rothschild banker where he worked and he went from updating financial spreadsheets in a junior capacity to being a full partner almost overnight.
[03:49:24.192 --> 03:49:33.121]  As a cap to this overwhelming success for someone so young, Macron was invited to attend the annual Bilderberg meeting in 2014.
[03:49:34.582 --> 03:49:41.846]  This is fairly conclusive when you're trying to figure out where his real loyalties lie.
[03:49:41.846 --> 03:49:56.595]  One more time, folks, you can aid the fight for liberty and the fact that the tech left, Google, Facebook, Amazon, they are seeking to throttle InfoWars.com.
[03:49:56.595 --> 03:50:02.779]  They are seeking to shut us down, to silence us, and to stifle the voice of freedom.
[03:50:03.399 --> 03:50:20.069]  The single best way you can help us, other than going to the InfoWars.com store, is by taking the links of these very segments, going to your Facebook, your Twitter feed, and let the world know what we're doing here at InfoWars.
[03:50:20.069 --> 03:50:31.336]  Indeed, InfoWars.com is the tip of the spear in the fight for a continued First Amendment and a vibrant, robust alternative media in America.
[03:50:32.642 --> 03:50:33.443]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:51:00.629 --> 03:51:03.172]  Don't become dependent on the medical system.
[03:51:03.172 --> 03:51:05.815]  Get and stay healthy naturally with XtendoVite.
[03:51:05.815 --> 03:51:09.799]  Metals in the liver cause peroxides to get dumped into the bloodstream.
[03:51:09.799 --> 03:51:20.772]  Peroxides do more damage than free radicals to the arteries, and the LDL has no protection from peroxides, causing the LDL to get stuck in the arteries, creating a potential blockage.
[03:51:21.172 --> 03:51:29.574]  Extendivite slowly chelates the metals away from the liver so it can dispose of what was meant to be a harmless process, peroxide.
[03:51:29.574 --> 03:51:34.535]  Extendivite's 7 herbs has a job to strengthen the organs and circulatory highway.
[03:51:34.535 --> 03:51:36.135]  Can you afford a heart attack?
[03:51:36.135 --> 03:51:41.636]  Extendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a 2 month supply.

[03:53:57.863 --> 03:53:58.626]  Effective.
[03:54:12.712 --> 03:54:14.413]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:54:14.413 --> 03:54:18.474]  I'm Roger Stone sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:54:18.474 --> 03:54:20.435]  Folks, let's be absolutely clear.
[03:54:20.435 --> 03:54:23.456]  Alex Jones is being targeted.
[03:54:23.456 --> 03:54:38.541]  We have the intelligence services leaking the disinformation that Alex Jones is a Russian asset and that the Russians have spent millions on computer bots pushing the links of InfoWars.
[03:54:39.281 --> 03:54:57.115]  It is a lie, a canard, a falsehood, a false flag to discredit perhaps one of the most influential journalists on the right and the distorted coverage of the child custody trial now going on in Austin, Texas.
[03:54:57.952 --> 03:55:03.034]  Courtroom, just another example of the attempts to smear Alex Jones.
[03:55:03.034 --> 03:55:24.340]  That's why your support for InfoWars is so vitally crucial to keep his strong voice and the voices of all the other men and women who work at InfoWars out there as a beacon for patriots who need to know the truth to utilize it in the war against those who would censor us.
[03:55:25.040 --> 03:55:33.127]  Now, I think it is pretty clear, when Donald Trump was elected, prospects for world peace never looked better.
[03:55:33.127 --> 03:55:46.397]  The neocons and the progressives, the extreme Bush types on the neocon right, and the progressives are literally slavering for World War III.
[03:55:47.398 --> 03:55:50.741]  Donald Trump so far has outwitted them.
[03:55:50.741 --> 03:55:58.887]  For those who want to say, well what are Trump's accomplishments in his first hundred days, I would argue that's pretty clear.
[03:55:59.707 --> 03:56:13.799]  For the first time, the communist Chinese are working with us to try to wrest the weapons of mass destruction being developed from the North Koreans from the international scene.
[03:56:13.799 --> 03:56:18.483]  This is a diplomatic breakthrough that the president is not getting credit for.
[03:56:19.244 --> 03:56:31.654]  Clearly the Chinese have determined, based on their meeting in Palm Beach with President Donald Trump, that it's time for them to join the international community of nations.
[03:56:31.654 --> 03:56:41.642]  It's time to give up the currency manipulation and the wholesale theft of our copyright secrets done through internet piracy.
[03:56:43.905 --> 03:56:51.469]  Donald Trump has been unfairly criticized for not putting those issues ahead of the North Korean threat.
[03:56:51.469 --> 03:56:55.711]  In this case, I think the president has done exactly the same thing.
[03:56:55.711 --> 03:57:06.296]  To claim that Trump has abandoned his goals when it comes to both currency manipulation and copyright theft is false.
[03:57:06.296 --> 03:57:11.719]  He has prioritized world peace for those economic issues.
[03:57:12.239 --> 03:57:24.451]  My hat's off now to President Donald Trump, who is, despite the hectoring of the neocons and the progressives, leading this country to a more peaceful world.
