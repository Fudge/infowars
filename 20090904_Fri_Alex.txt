[00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.653]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.653 --> 00:00:11.234]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:12.794]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.997]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.997 --> 00:00:24.841]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:30.844]  Very informative radio show lined up for you today on this September 4th, 2009 Friday edition.
[00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.906]  We'll also be live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:51.229]  with an abbreviated Sunday edition and then of course back on Monday and then on Tuesday just huge guest, huge developments, biggest ever here on the show.
[00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:58.470]  You'll want to be watching InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the morning coming up next Tuesday.
[00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.631]  Word to the wise is sufficient.
[00:01:02.364 --> 00:01:02.884]  You never know.
[00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:04.906]  I like to throw curveballs at the establishment.
[00:01:04.906 --> 00:01:06.227]  We might launch it today!
[00:01:06.227 --> 00:01:08.648]  We might launch it Saturday night!
[00:01:08.648 --> 00:01:17.314]  The guys in the control room don't know what it is, but we may nevertheless launch the operation.
[00:01:17.314 --> 00:01:18.054]  Who knows?
[00:01:18.054 --> 00:01:24.058]  We'll be walking through that door in studio with us.
[00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:26.800]  The establishment certainly knows.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.821]  And that's why you're seeing a lot of things you're seeing right now.
[00:01:33.644 --> 00:01:35.965]  Quite a countdown, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:40.708]  I know I'm on the edge of my seat.
[00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:53.096]  Dr. Len Horowitz is coming up in T-minus 14 minutes from now to give us his breakdown and boil down on the latest flu developments, what Dr. Horowitz thinks is really going on.
[00:01:59.637 --> 00:02:05.719]  And then we have Joe Berlinger coming on the transmission.
[00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:25.746]  He is an award-winning documentary filmmaker of the highest caliber, made some kind of monster about Metallica, Brothers Keeper, the famous film about upstate New York with the rural brothers, Paradise Lost, about falsely accused and convicted people in that whole murder case, and just a lot more.
[00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:33.221]  He's made a huge film called Crude about the oil companies in Latin America, in South America.
[00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:34.623]  Some harrowing tales.
[00:02:36.277 --> 00:02:40.961]  That he'll be breaking down coming up in the second hour today.
[00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:47.085]  And then for an hour and a half, we have Dr. Russell Blaylock, neurologist, brain surgeon, scientist.
[00:02:47.085 --> 00:02:48.266]  We're going to go over everything.
[00:02:48.266 --> 00:03:00.535]  MSG, aspartame, the flu, vaccines, the whole gamut of the eugenicist empire, the eugenics population reduction operation against free humanity.
[00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:02.116]  That is coming out in the last 30 minutes.
[00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:05.579]  I'll do a latest news recap and update.
[00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:12.584]  We will take some calls specifically for Dr. Len Horowitz on the flu.
[00:03:12.584 --> 00:03:16.848]  In fact, we can start your engines right now if you'd like.
[00:03:16.848 --> 00:03:20.812]  About to see the green flag here.
[00:03:20.812 --> 00:03:27.719]  Specifically only on the flu for Dr. Horowitz and the whole police state grid eugenics.
[00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.843]  That's a pretty wide area, but the phones will be open for him.
[00:03:32.553 --> 00:03:32.673]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:32.673 --> 00:03:40.980]  If you call in telling me you got a tractor for sale or saw a chubacabra in the cabbage patch, I'm going to hang up on you.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.081]  I love your calls.
[00:03:42.081 --> 00:03:54.873]  We normally have wide open phones that don't screen your calls, but when I have a guest on about a specific issue, like say if I have an astronaut on asking me anything about space and the space program, we're not going to ask them what they think of
[00:03:58.533 --> 00:04:02.614]  I don't know, fishing for flounder in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:04:02.614 --> 00:04:03.274]  So, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:03.274 --> 00:04:03.914]  800-259-9231.
[00:04:03.914 --> 00:04:16.616]  And we will get you up on the air on that front.
[00:04:16.616 --> 00:04:23.837]  When we come back after this quick break, I'm going to comment on the whole Van Jones situation and the PSYOP that's being run on that front.
[00:04:23.837 --> 00:04:25.998]  This is completely staged, there's no doubting that.
[00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:33.210]  We'll also tie that into Obama wanting to address the school children and people saying, what's the big deal with this?
[00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.931]  Well, he's enlisting their help.
[00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:41.252]  He's not just wanting to talk to them, he wants to enlist them as their Ugin.
[00:04:41.252 --> 00:04:42.413]  As the Hitler Ugin.
[00:04:42.413 --> 00:04:45.593]  And that's exactly what the White House has been setting up.
[00:04:45.593 --> 00:04:47.134]  And by the way, this predates Obama.
[00:04:47.134 --> 00:04:52.535]  He's just the latest frontman, the latest messianic El Presidente they're pushing on us.
[00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:56.388]  Very important transmission lined up today.
[00:04:56.388 --> 00:04:57.989]  You want the answers to the flu?
[00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:00.731]  Tell your friends and family to tune in now.
[00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:03.734]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.734 --> 00:05:09.078]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.078 --> 00:05:11.119]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:16.123]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.123 --> 00:05:17.044]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.284 --> 00:05:18.425]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:20.306]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.306 --> 00:05:21.367]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:23.568]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.568 --> 00:05:24.909]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.450]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.714]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.714 --> 00:05:35.296]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.296 --> 00:05:38.759]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:40.340]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.240]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.341]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:43.282]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.282 --> 00:05:44.362]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:47.424]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.424 --> 00:05:49.206]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:49.206 --> 00:05:50.106]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:03.022]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:06:03.022 --> 00:06:05.445]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:06:05.445 --> 00:06:08.068]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:09.250]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.972]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[00:06:10.972 --> 00:06:13.856]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:06:13.856 --> 00:06:17.500]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.134]  We have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:06:27.134 --> 00:06:33.040]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.401]  An inside job.
[00:06:35.786 --> 00:06:35.966]  Wow!
[00:07:04.292 --> 00:07:06.493]  All I can say is WOW!
[00:07:06.493 --> 00:07:08.775]  Times are changing fast!
[00:07:08.775 --> 00:07:10.095]  Scary needles!
[00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:15.118]  Laws changing until pretty soon it'll be against the law to grow a tomato plant!
[00:07:15.118 --> 00:07:17.039]  How does this fit into health care?
[00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:22.122]  I'm not sure, but I am sure that Life Change Tea will give attention to your health.
[00:07:22.122 --> 00:07:23.123]  Good health!
[00:07:23.123 --> 00:07:28.466]  Join the many that have made the change just by drinking our all-natural tea.

[00:07:43.434 --> 00:07:44.914]  It doesn't come any easier.
[00:07:44.914 --> 00:07:46.755]  GetTheTea.com.

[00:08:00.649 --> 00:08:06.056]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.056 --> 00:08:08.360]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:35.026]  Okay, we've got Dr. Leonard Horowitz joining us in about seven, eight minutes for the rest of the hour to break down the latest developments on the flu situation, the quarantines, the mass lockdowns, the martial law that the feds are openly saying they're planning to engage.
[00:08:35.026 --> 00:08:36.367]  Now, that's what they're saying.
[00:08:36.367 --> 00:08:37.568]  We're not saying it's going to happen.
[00:08:38.189 --> 00:08:39.911]  I believe it's going to fail.
[00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:41.733]  I believe we're going to back him off.
[00:08:41.733 --> 00:08:44.035]  Steve Quayle disagrees, and I respect Steve.
[00:08:44.035 --> 00:08:45.737]  We're going to get Dr. Horowitz's take on this.
[00:08:45.737 --> 00:08:52.644]  We're going to get Dr. Blalock's take on this, brain surgeon, coming up in the third and fourth hour today.
[00:08:54.198 --> 00:09:04.060]  And then in the last 30 minutes of the show, I'm going to get back into Obama's education takeover, and I'm going to get into the whole Van Jones situation with 9-11 Truth.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.381]  See, he comes out and admits he's a communist.
[00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:11.822]  He openly wants complete transfer of all wealth.
[00:09:11.822 --> 00:09:14.383]  Everyone living in work camps wearing gray uniforms.
[00:09:14.383 --> 00:09:15.683]  That's the Stalin model.
[00:09:16.463 --> 00:09:21.964]  And then fat cats in giant palaces with a hundred plus mistresses and giant villas.
[00:09:21.964 --> 00:09:23.584]  I mean, that's communism.
[00:09:23.584 --> 00:09:28.565]  Communism doesn't exist in the phony way it's pushed.
[00:09:28.565 --> 00:09:30.626]  It's always funded by big banks, big money.
[00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:32.906]  They want consolidation.
[00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:40.728]  And it's hardcore slavery, serfdom, feudalism, total consolidation of wealth, but they tell you it's redistribution.
[00:09:40.728 --> 00:09:44.589]  And that's why the Bank of England wrote up the plan and had Marx and Engels go out and push it.
[00:09:44.589 --> 00:09:45.549]  And that's on record now.
[00:09:46.345 --> 00:09:49.088]  That's why big money always funds it.
[00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:51.930]  It's really a form of crony capitalism.
[00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.795]  But again, they know how to run scams and mislabel things, so they fool people.
[00:09:56.795 --> 00:10:00.078]  And so we all debate the false left-right paradigm.
[00:10:00.078 --> 00:10:03.081]  They know Van Jones is extremely unpopular.
[00:10:03.081 --> 00:10:05.203]  They know that he called for the youth brigades.
[00:10:05.203 --> 00:10:10.007]  They know he said that the green jobs is to take over the economy and create communism.
[00:10:10.007 --> 00:10:10.748]  He's on record!
[00:10:10.748 --> 00:10:11.489]  That's what it is!
[00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.551]  That's what Club of Rome said in the 60s it is.
[00:10:15.551 --> 00:10:18.554]  That's what the head of the CFR, Richard N. Haas, wrote and said.
[00:10:18.554 --> 00:10:27.460]  It's a way to totally have eugenics, a one-child policy, and make you so poor you can't afford to even take care of your family.
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.001]  It is the state taking over, just as the
[00:10:31.042 --> 00:10:52.059]  Head of the Science Czar, John P. Holdren, wrote in Ecoscience, the government textbook, and we've now found more than 20 other textbooks he wrote or contributed to and huge papers he wrote that have come out this week that we've discovered where he worshipped eugenics itself using that term.
[00:10:52.059 --> 00:10:55.562]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is some deep water we're in.
[00:10:56.863 --> 00:10:58.745]  People think I exaggerate here.
[00:10:58.745 --> 00:11:03.430]  I can't describe to you how serious and how real this is.
[00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:15.822]  So, Fox News knew that Van Jones, part of his foundation left cover in Oakland, had had his name added by someone in his group to the 9-11 movement.
[00:11:18.973 --> 00:11:22.595]  Because that's a staple of the true left, down at the grassroots.
[00:11:22.595 --> 00:11:24.536]  These are good people on average.
[00:11:24.536 --> 00:11:29.199]  Even if I agree with a lot of their ideas, they legitimately think socialism and communism is good.
[00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:30.739]  They just don't know it's a con game.
[00:11:30.739 --> 00:11:33.381]  And they can look at the evidence and can tell that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:11:33.381 --> 00:11:37.383]  This isn't a left-wing, right-wing issue.
[00:11:37.383 --> 00:11:44.447]  But now having the right-wing decry 9-11 truth, and the left-wing run from him on this, when he was already a dead political creature,
[00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:53.229]  Over calling for communism, admitting green jobs is a way to hijack the economy.
[00:11:53.229 --> 00:12:02.593]  So now they bring in Van Jones and drop him in on the top of this as a cherry on top and claim that he's politically dead weight because of that.
[00:12:02.593 --> 00:12:05.994]  Fox News puts out a poll, 97% saying get rid of him.
[00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:09.469]  It works like a charm.
[00:12:09.469 --> 00:12:18.215]  You got all these TV shows on History, and on A&E, and on PBS, and on National Geographic coming out.
[00:12:18.215 --> 00:12:23.279]  The National Geographic one was funded by the Dubai government.
[00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:27.142]  A hundred million dollars they put into political films.
[00:12:27.142 --> 00:12:32.806]  And it's all complete lies, and we've got Professor Jones, Architects and Engineers founder,
[00:12:35.583 --> 00:12:36.784]  Gage coming on next week.
[00:12:36.784 --> 00:12:37.644]  We're going to be covering that.
[00:12:37.644 --> 00:12:57.093]  But the issue here is that the establishment knew that once Bush was out of office, he wouldn't have the political power and Cheney wouldn't have the political power to cover for the death squads and the torture squads and the fact that he wanted to stage terror attacks against U.S.
[00:12:57.093 --> 00:12:58.753]  ships and blame it on Iran.
[00:12:58.753 --> 00:12:59.834]  That's now all public.
[00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:19.413]  And so they're more scared of 9-11 now than ever, but they also knew that it would be depoliticized to a certain extent so that they could double back now and attack 9-11 truth and try to rewrite history when we have gained the high ground and 84% of Americans in a New York Times poll believe the government's lying about 9-11.
[00:13:19.413 --> 00:13:26.276]  Another CNN poll, 83% agree with Charlie Sheen that it's an inside job.
[00:13:26.276 --> 00:13:29.518]  They know that we continue to march and wake people up.
[00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:35.393]  And so they're trying to double back when they have someone highly politically unpopular.
[00:13:35.393 --> 00:13:45.403]  Obama is plunging, crashing in flames on his big government takeover of health care, on his eugenics care, on his green taxes, carbon taxes.
[00:13:45.403 --> 00:13:48.226]  And so everything is dumped on Van Jones.
[00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:59.697]  National attention is given to him being an open communist, admitting he wants to put you in work brigades and forced labor camps and National Compulsory Service.
[00:13:59.697 --> 00:14:01.098]  Obama's in deep trouble.
[00:14:01.098 --> 00:14:09.041]  I mean, his original press release, the Department of Education told schools, if you want federal funds, you will show this video.
[00:14:11.653 --> 00:14:12.293]  To the kids.
[00:14:12.293 --> 00:14:18.656]  You will have him enlist them to help him and write letters to themselves about how they're in league with him.
[00:14:18.656 --> 00:14:19.557]  It's fantasy world.
[00:14:19.557 --> 00:14:27.321]  It's like a little kid imagining he's Harry Potter or Luke Skywalker or Aragorn, you know, fighting Lord of the Rings.
[00:14:27.321 --> 00:14:28.061]  It's make-believe.
[00:14:28.061 --> 00:14:32.783]  They want to address little kids where he tells them he has a relationship with them.
[00:14:32.783 --> 00:14:33.804]  That's the point.
[00:14:33.804 --> 00:14:36.725]  That's what's Stalin-esque or Hitlerian and right out of 1984.
[00:14:38.613 --> 00:14:41.274]  Not, oh, the President just wants to address the nation.
[00:14:41.274 --> 00:14:45.857]  He harangues the country every day in press conferences and events and speeches.
[00:14:45.857 --> 00:14:47.838]  They show him constantly in school.
[00:14:47.838 --> 00:14:49.439]  They showed his inauguration.
[00:14:49.439 --> 00:14:53.721]  They're trying to make him a messianic leader to push him on the public.
[00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:59.324]  And then they knew it would also have a percentage of the public that become divided and don't want their kids to see it.
[00:14:59.324 --> 00:15:00.444]  And then they can say, what's wrong?
[00:15:00.444 --> 00:15:01.905]  We just want the President to be there.
[00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:29.295]  So I'm going to cover all that at the end of the show today in detail and break down what's really happening and go over some of the actual clips of Obama calling for youth for graves, Ron Emanuel, Van Jones, and explain how they're trying to couple that unpopular agenda of the greenhouse gas tax and all of that
[00:15:30.342 --> 00:15:31.523]  to 9-11 truth.
[00:15:31.523 --> 00:15:55.925]  Showing 9-11 truth is powerful and is growing and is hurting the establishment because now everybody knows that government staged terror and even if somebody doesn't completely believe that 9-11 was an inside job, they think about false flag terror now and they know about Operation Ajax, Gulf of Tonkin being staged, they know about Cheney being declassified wanting to stage terror attacks and so it means they have trouble staging terror attacks now
[00:15:57.597 --> 00:16:16.644]  And getting political power out of it because the public is wise and their DHS report came out documenting that veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, people that don't want to vaccinate, people that are against abortion, people that are against the private federal reserve, that we're all terrorists.
[00:16:16.644 --> 00:16:19.845]  The people now know the whole secret police system has been set up for us.
[00:16:24.645 --> 00:16:29.028]  So they're aware of all of this, and that's what the flu is.
[00:16:29.028 --> 00:16:38.154]  The flu is the false flag that isn't openly staged terror, that can be worldwide, that the UN can run, that makes everybody guilty until proven innocent.
[00:16:38.154 --> 00:16:40.496]  And now the quarantines are being announced, it's all happening.
[00:16:40.496 --> 00:16:48.802]  We're going to break in a moment, coming back for the rest of the hour with Dr. Leonard Horowitz, one of the main leading authorities on this, somebody I really respect.
[00:16:51.186 --> 00:16:53.047]  We're going to have him with us coming up in the next segment.
[00:16:53.047 --> 00:16:56.730]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up on a separate issue for about three minutes before we go to break here.
[00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.373]  Before we go to Dr. Horowitz.
[00:17:00.373 --> 00:17:01.894]  And that's Ted Anderson.
[00:17:01.894 --> 00:17:04.656]  Ted told you a month ago to buy gold when he was selling it at $905 an ounce.
[00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:07.278]  He still has gold he bought at $905, $911, $914, $915, and $916.
[00:17:07.278 --> 00:17:08.179]  And silver he bought at $14.
[00:17:08.179 --> 00:17:08.559]  It's now above $16.
[00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:21.502]  He can still sell you the gold and silver, but this is the absolute end.
[00:17:21.502 --> 00:17:25.023]  In fact, he told me he sold out of a lot of coins at that price yesterday.
[00:17:25.023 --> 00:17:35.466]  He has a few left in silver and gold at the price when gold was roughly $80 an ounce less than it is now, and silver was up to $2 less than it is now.
[00:17:35.466 --> 00:17:37.446]  You cannot beat this deal anywhere.
[00:17:37.446 --> 00:17:38.386]  We've got two minutes.
[00:17:38.386 --> 00:17:44.728]  Briefly tell folks the coins you've got left, most of it sold out, and the deal you've got for people now.
[00:17:45.228 --> 00:17:46.090]  Yeah, real fast.
[00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.712]  I'll let you know what went up first.
[00:17:47.712 --> 00:17:48.994]  The Franks went from 216 to 233.
[00:17:48.994 --> 00:17:53.221]  The British Sovereigns went from that 200, and I can't remember, it was like 220, 200, anyways, they're 288 right now.
[00:17:59.302 --> 00:18:04.087]  The Lakota Nation coin went from that $19.70, now they're $22.30.
[00:18:04.087 --> 00:18:20.624]  The two coins that I have left right now that are still priced at the same price that they were yesterday are the Walking Liberty halves, which are currently right now at $8.69, which is the same thing that I was offering when silver was down at that $13 level, and then the $10 Liberty right now.
[00:18:21.084 --> 00:18:27.688]  I have it at $818.50, which is the same price that it was the other day as well.
[00:18:27.688 --> 00:18:32.872]  So if you want to get involved in something with gold or silver, there still are some things that are left on behind.
[00:18:32.872 --> 00:18:33.912]  Gold is up today.
[00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:35.653]  Gold went up to $995.70 already today, $1628 silver.
[00:18:35.653 --> 00:18:37.274]  Ted, I want to be clear here.
[00:18:45.715 --> 00:18:47.655]  You bought gold back when it was $905, $915.
[00:18:47.655 --> 00:18:50.756]  You passed those savings on.
[00:18:50.756 --> 00:18:51.896]  That sold out.
[00:18:51.896 --> 00:18:56.817]  But you'd made other purchases when gold was what?
[00:18:56.817 --> 00:18:57.198]  $920, $935.
[00:18:57.198 --> 00:18:59.018]  Silver was $14 something.
[00:18:59.018 --> 00:19:02.179]  So the deals you've still got are how many?
[00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:02.899]  $30, $40, $50?
[00:19:02.899 --> 00:19:04.859]  Lower than the market?
[00:19:04.859 --> 00:19:11.301]  They're certainly priced closer to $100, I suppose, on the gold since gold is almost hitting $1,000 right now.
[00:19:11.301 --> 00:19:12.381]  And it was when gold was in the $9
[00:19:13.243 --> 00:19:14.104]  We're good.
[00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:39.061]  Okay, so people at a 940, so people are getting into a market at a 940 level when it's at 993 right now.
[00:19:39.061 --> 00:19:41.602]  So it's still an insane savings.
[00:19:41.602 --> 00:19:43.904]  800-686-2237.
[00:19:43.904 --> 00:19:45.205]  Get into gold now, folks.
[00:19:45.205 --> 00:19:48.207]  800-686-2237.
[00:19:48.207 --> 00:19:51.949]  Gold will quite likely reach 1,000 an ounce, if not today, in the next few weeks.
[00:19:51.949 --> 00:19:56.492]  CEO of metals consultancy firm GFMS, Paul Walker said.
[00:19:56.492 --> 00:19:56.532]  800-686-2237.
[00:20:00.851 --> 00:20:01.952]  Hi, Ed Schultz here.
[00:20:01.952 --> 00:20:05.937]  I want to tell you about BioGreenClean.com.
[00:20:05.937 --> 00:20:07.519]  BioGreenClean.
[00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:14.887]  It is absolutely the first heavy-duty, all-natural, multi-purpose cleaner that outperforms all competitive cleaners.
[00:20:14.887 --> 00:20:17.089]  BioGreenClean is the product.
[00:20:17.089 --> 00:20:20.013]  It's tough enough to take on virtually any cleaning challenge.
[00:20:20.333 --> 00:20:22.777]  Yet gentle enough for your baby's toys.
[00:20:22.777 --> 00:20:23.358]  That's right.
[00:20:23.358 --> 00:20:29.807]  BioGreen Clean is plant derived and contains no harmful chemicals, solvents and no annoying fragrances.
[00:20:29.807 --> 00:20:36.717]  If you want spectacular and unprecedented results from a revolutionary cleaning product, look no further.

[00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:44.343]  It's super and it's easy to order.
[00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:47.746]  Just go to www.biogreenclean.com.
[00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:51.269]  That's www.biogreenclean.com.
[00:20:51.269 --> 00:20:55.052]  B-I-O-G-R-E-E-N-C-L-E-A-N.com.
[00:20:55.052 --> 00:20:56.033]  Try it today.
[00:20:56.033 --> 00:20:57.414]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:20:57.414 --> 00:20:58.815]  BioGreenClean.
[00:20:58.815 --> 00:21:00.116]  It cleans anything.
[00:21:00.748 --> 00:21:02.769]  There are many guarantees in this world.
[00:21:02.769 --> 00:21:06.351]  The closest I can come to a guarantee is that the dollar is going to zero.
[00:21:06.351 --> 00:21:13.895]  During the great hyperinflation in Weimar, Germany, people who had worked all their lives and invested conservatively were wiped out, reduced to poverty.
[00:21:13.895 --> 00:21:16.697]  There are many parallels between the Weimar and the U.S.
[00:21:16.697 --> 00:21:17.197]  today.
[00:21:17.197 --> 00:21:18.078]  I'll send you a list.
[00:21:18.078 --> 00:21:27.123]  There are ways to protect yourself from hyperinflation, gold and silver, and legal and constitutional ways to avoid confiscation, which is becoming highly probable.
[00:21:27.123 --> 00:21:29.184]  I'm Bob Moss with Midas Resources.
[00:21:29.484 --> 00:21:34.670]  Many of the people I talked to today are aware of trouble coming, but haven't taken action to protect themselves.
[00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:39.735]  There is, in fact, a financial tsunami coming, and it could fall upon us quickly with little warning.
[00:21:39.735 --> 00:21:40.636]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:21:40.636 --> 00:21:41.557]  Protect yourself.
[00:21:41.557 --> 00:21:43.619]  Call me today, Bob Moss, at 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[00:21:47.984 --> 00:21:54.525]  That's Bob Moss, Midas Resources, 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[00:21:54.525 --> 00:22:01.107]  Again, that's Bob Moss, 800-686-2237, extension 111.
[00:22:01.107 --> 00:22:03.087]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:22:03.087 --> 00:22:06.708]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:22:06.708 --> 00:22:09.188]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:22:09.188 --> 00:22:12.249]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:22:12.249 --> 00:22:14.149]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[00:22:14.565 --> 00:22:15.085]  We're good to go.
[00:22:39.718 --> 00:22:43.859]  From tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[00:22:43.859 --> 00:22:48.741]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[00:22:48.741 --> 00:22:51.581]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[00:22:51.581 --> 00:22:53.662]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:53.662 --> 00:22:55.662]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[00:22:55.662 --> 00:22:57.803]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[00:22:57.803 --> 00:22:59.604]  Bring down the New World Order.
[00:22:59.604 --> 00:23:00.364]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:01.837 --> 00:23:03.878]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[00:23:03.878 --> 00:23:06.818]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[00:23:06.818 --> 00:23:09.059]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[00:23:09.059 --> 00:23:10.039]  Here's the story.
[00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:14.841]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[00:23:14.841 --> 00:23:16.101]  Now here's the bad news.
[00:23:16.101 --> 00:23:21.162]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[00:23:21.162 --> 00:23:23.023]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[00:23:23.283 --> 00:23:27.904]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[00:23:27.904 --> 00:23:33.405]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the health care services.
[00:23:33.405 --> 00:23:35.605]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[00:23:35.605 --> 00:23:44.607]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[00:23:44.607 --> 00:23:49.788]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[00:23:49.788 --> 00:23:51.948]  I recommend you visit this important new website at
[00:23:52.208 --> 00:23:53.888]  MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[00:23:53.888 --> 00:23:57.249]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:23:57.249 --> 00:24:11.453]  We're going to Dr. Horowitz here in a moment.
[00:24:11.453 --> 00:24:15.014]  I wanted to just briefly finish up explaining what Tevis is talking about.
[00:24:15.014 --> 00:24:17.314]  He bought gold at the 905 to 916 level.
[00:24:17.314 --> 00:24:17.874]  He sold it all.
[00:24:21.826 --> 00:24:21.926]  Yeah.
[00:24:52.626 --> 00:25:04.912]  He, of course, is a Harvard-degreed expert in so many fields, holds several doctorates as a former dentist and health industry entrepreneur and the author of a number of books, pamphlets, DVDs.
[00:25:04.912 --> 00:25:07.133]  This is just what Wikipedia is saying about him.
[00:25:07.133 --> 00:25:10.715]  Again, a Harvard degree, several other degrees.
[00:25:10.715 --> 00:25:13.857]  And we really appreciate him coming on with us.
[00:25:13.857 --> 00:25:15.377]  He's got a whole bunch of different websites.
[00:25:15.377 --> 00:25:16.058]  One of them is Doctor...
[00:25:16.818 --> 00:25:23.962]  Linhorowicz.com, tetrahedron.org, just a whole bunch of sites we'll give you before he leaves us today.
[00:25:23.962 --> 00:25:41.433]  But we've got all these virologists and neurologists coming out, Dr. Blalock's coming up later, saying, look, these flu shots before have caused Guillain-Barnes, neurological degenerative diseases, other flu vaccine trials in Europe have caused deaths with the bird flu.
[00:25:41.433 --> 00:25:45.316]  The Gardasil that Dr. Horowitz three years ago said was deadly, they now admit is deadly.
[00:25:46.465 --> 00:25:51.450]  What's really going on with this, Dr. Horowitz, all the new big developments that are happening?
[00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:59.999]  Well, number one, it's a psychological operation, which you know, and you do such a great job, Alex, preparing people for what's really coming down here.
[00:25:59.999 --> 00:26:09.248]  The poisoning, particularly of squalene and the ingredients in these vaccinations, is what's really the, I think, fundamental risk.
[00:26:09.884 --> 00:26:13.727]  That they're promoting it heavily as safe.
[00:26:13.727 --> 00:26:18.070]  There's no possible way they can do that because they're just now testing it.
[00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:22.753]  So that means that they can't have safety testing for more than six weeks because they're planning it.
[00:26:22.753 --> 00:26:24.295]  Some people are getting it right now.
[00:26:24.295 --> 00:26:34.342]  So it's really experimental and the toxic ingredients in these vaccines make it absolutely clear that this is a toxic soup and they're going to have a lot of people sick because of it.
[00:26:36.055 --> 00:26:48.926]  What I've read from the medical doctors out there that are looking at this is they're saying the chemicals they put in it to trigger an autoimmune response is causing many of the problems.
[00:26:50.009 --> 00:26:50.749]  Absolutely.
[00:26:50.749 --> 00:26:58.392]  And you know, when you look at squaling, first of all, you see what the United States Congress, when they investigated Gulf War Syndrome, said about it.
[00:26:58.392 --> 00:27:09.137]  It was heavily implicated as being the premier factor causing the chronic fatigue, immune dysfunction, fibromyalgia, the cancers associated with Gulf War Syndrome.
[00:27:09.657 --> 00:27:10.737]  So that's number one.
[00:27:10.737 --> 00:27:16.939]  Number two is if you read about it and you start to study what that active ingredient, actually it's a passive ingredient.
[00:27:16.939 --> 00:27:23.880]  The active ingredients are the foreign genetics, the foreign proteins from the sources of the microbe.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.621]  So H1N1, God knows what else they're putting in there.
[00:27:27.621 --> 00:27:32.202]  But the other aspect that's fascinating is if you go into the natural
[00:27:32.822 --> 00:27:33.582]  We're good to go.
[00:27:50.968 --> 00:27:51.468]  I don't
[00:28:07.778 --> 00:28:12.560]  And this is not just Dr. Horowitz Harvard trained saying this, this is London Telegraph, this is associated
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.121]  But then they still call us conspiracy theorists.
[00:28:38.121 --> 00:28:44.206]  Dr. Horwitz, I want to break down the PSYOP, where you see this going in the fall, what we know is in the five different vaccines.
[00:28:44.206 --> 00:28:46.768]  The news is reporting one is a DNA therapy.
[00:28:46.768 --> 00:29:03.842]  I don't quite understand that, but why are they admitting in all these major government and industry studies, now what you and others wrote over a decade ago, that all of this juvenile onset and early onset of different types of arthritis they found in rats and guinea pigs is caused by the vaccines.
[00:29:03.842 --> 00:29:04.623]  What's going on there?
[00:29:05.003 --> 00:29:12.766]  All right, let me explain that to you, and this really was what prompted me heavily to get involved in the vaccine risk awareness movement.
[00:29:12.766 --> 00:29:15.708]  You know my mother died of Guillain-Barre.
[00:29:15.708 --> 00:29:28.313]  She was one of the victims of the swine flu vaccine back in the 70s, and that when you look at what just came out a couple weeks ago in the press, not in the mainstream press at all, it was completely neglected.
[00:29:28.373 --> 00:29:29.294]  Well, tell you what, stay there.
[00:29:29.294 --> 00:29:30.575]  We're gonna come back and that's right.
[00:29:30.575 --> 00:29:38.040]  I remember first interviewing Dr. Horowitz like 13 years ago when he talked about his mother dying from the shot.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.501]  And now they're admitting this.
[00:29:39.501 --> 00:29:42.564]  Tens of thousands of people killed, hundreds of thousands maimed.
[00:29:42.564 --> 00:29:46.567]  And why are all these children getting arthritis?
[00:29:46.567 --> 00:29:48.088]  I mean, it's just, it's horrible.
[00:29:48.088 --> 00:29:51.050]  Stay with us, doctor.
[00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:52.431]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.431 --> 00:29:54.973]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.973 --> 00:29:57.675]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.418 --> 00:30:04.662]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:30:04.662 --> 00:30:06.664]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:30:06.664 --> 00:30:15.193]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:30:15.193 --> 00:30:20.738]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:30:20.738 --> 00:30:22.360]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:29.104]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:30:29.104 --> 00:30:40.171]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:40.631]  That's right.
[00:30:40.811 --> 00:30:44.132]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.402 --> 00:31:13.285]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.285 --> 00:31:19.748]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.748 --> 00:31:21.749]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.749 --> 00:31:24.211]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.211 --> 00:31:35.096]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.378 --> 00:31:39.058]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.058 --> 00:31:40.919]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:40.919 --> 00:31:47.820]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:56.082]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.082 --> 00:31:57.662]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.662 --> 00:32:02.703]  The people strike back.
[00:32:02.703 --> 00:32:05.304]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[00:32:05.788 --> 00:32:08.429]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[00:32:08.429 --> 00:32:12.170]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutroversal Foods.
[00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:18.852]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[00:32:18.852 --> 00:32:22.753]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[00:32:22.753 --> 00:32:27.115]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[00:32:27.115 --> 00:32:30.716]  Nutroversal Foods from eFoods Direct, your new comfort food.
[00:32:30.716 --> 00:32:33.477]  Incredible taste, easy to prepare, and a long shelf life.
[00:32:34.377 --> 00:32:35.138]  We're good to go!
[00:33:04.039 --> 00:33:07.043]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:33:07.043 --> 00:33:09.887]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:09.887 --> 00:33:14.293]  Okay, Dr. Horowitz, I want you to start back over with
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:41.173]  My question, dealing with, I remember you and many others publishing the medical findings and foreign studies about it causing all the massive onset of not just arthritis, but all these other joint problems.
[00:33:41.173 --> 00:33:45.637]  I'm going back from memory, but you were saying it was microplasms and other autoimmune responses.
[00:33:45.637 --> 00:33:46.798]  But now you've been proven right.
[00:33:46.798 --> 00:33:48.419]  That's now in all the medical literature.
[00:33:48.419 --> 00:33:49.420]  They're now admitting it.
[00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:56.612]  Talk about incredible liability, but I guess the government's saying there's liability protection, but continue with the wake up with them killing your mother.
[00:33:57.591 --> 00:33:59.733]  Well yes, from Gillian Bure.
[00:33:59.733 --> 00:34:18.911]  And so last week what you had was there was a leak from a British press that there had been a secret notice sent out by the government, the British government, to physicians, particularly neurologists, to beware that there's going to be a large increase in Gillian Bure.
[00:34:18.911 --> 00:34:20.593]  Now that's just an example
[00:34:21.153 --> 00:34:24.397]  Gillian Beret is one of numerous autoimmune diseases.
[00:34:24.397 --> 00:34:27.200]  Basically, here's how all of them happen.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:32.627]  It's a great example, and if you just understand this, you'll never want to take another vaccine again in your life.
[00:34:33.499 --> 00:34:41.503]  Because when you get injected with not just squalene, which is, again, it's not the active ingredient, but it whacks out the immune system, number one.
[00:34:41.503 --> 00:34:47.445]  But on top of that, you get injected with foreign RNA and foreign DNA and foreign proteins.
[00:34:47.445 --> 00:34:50.186]  From, let's say in this case, H1N1.
[00:34:50.186 --> 00:34:55.629]  That means now that these foreign proteins and genetic material is floating in your bloodstream.
[00:34:56.329 --> 00:35:00.153]  It lands on your own host cell protein.
[00:35:00.153 --> 00:35:06.278]  So it becomes what the immunologists call an antigenic complex.
[00:35:06.278 --> 00:35:09.801]  And very few physicians know anything about this, Alex.
[00:35:09.801 --> 00:35:11.402]  That's a disgrace.
[00:35:11.402 --> 00:35:16.727]  The fact of the matter is all the specialists know about it from the scientific literature.
[00:35:16.727 --> 00:35:18.589]  What is an antigenic complex?
[00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:22.272]  Very simply, it's a piece of your own and a piece of a foreign.
[00:35:23.351 --> 00:35:23.991]  Particle.
[00:35:23.991 --> 00:35:37.674]  Bacteria are viral, in this case it's H1N1 protein or genetic material, which then is causing your own white blood cell bodyguards to attack that complex.
[00:35:37.674 --> 00:35:47.976]  It reads the sequence, it then says to the rest of the lymphatic cells, all the T-cells, your whole army of white blood cell bodyguards, then gets alerted
[00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:53.596]  That says if you ever see this sequence, attack and destroy it.
[00:35:53.596 --> 00:35:59.646]  The problem is, it's giving your own body parts part of the message of attack and destroy.
[00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:01.231]  It's self.
[00:36:01.231 --> 00:36:03.072]  So that's autoimmune.
[00:36:03.072 --> 00:36:09.416]  It's self, your number one God-given gift, the immune system attacking and destroying you.
[00:36:09.416 --> 00:36:13.119]  That's where all of these new plagues have come from.
[00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:25.247]  Chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, lupus, MS, ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, chronic crippling rheumatoid arthritis you mentioned, diabetes, type 1 autoimmune diabetes.
[00:36:25.247 --> 00:36:29.029]  All exploding and it's in the government's own documents.
[00:36:29.029 --> 00:36:29.650]  Here's John P.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:40.978]  Holdren saying, we're going to inject you with things that sterilize you, but more than that, they cold-bloodedly know they're soft-killing everybody.
[00:36:40.978 --> 00:36:51.586]  The most expensive, profitable way, the most expensive for the consumer, the most expensive for the nation, for healthcare, it is basically a genocide.
[00:36:51.586 --> 00:36:53.367]  Look at the definition of genocide.
[00:36:53.367 --> 00:36:58.591]  Genocide is strictly defined in Webster's Dictionary as the mass killing or enslaving
[00:36:59.171 --> 00:37:02.714]  Of people for profit, politics and ideology.
[00:37:02.714 --> 00:37:08.979]  In this case, people are being enslaved to the chronic diseases that are most expensive to treat through the drugs.
[00:37:08.979 --> 00:37:24.291]  This is a complete genocidal operation, and what you're witnessing in the mainstream media is a psychological operation, virtually a military operation, to get people engaged in a biological warfare against humanity.
[00:37:26.127 --> 00:37:29.449]  Continue, you were going through all the health problems it causes.
[00:37:29.449 --> 00:37:43.077]  Yeah, so again, Gillian Bure in my mother's case, and this is what's so expected now again by the government of Britain, tells the healthcare professionals the great news, and I feel like we've won a major part of this battle.
[00:37:43.077 --> 00:37:45.719]  Half of the physicians in Hong Kong
[00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:49.061]  We'll not take this vaccine.
[00:37:49.061 --> 00:37:58.089]  More than that, nurses in the UK, more than that of nurses in New York State have already said that they're not going to take this because they're smart.
[00:37:58.089 --> 00:38:14.703]  They understand, like a disease like Guillain-Barre, what you've got is you've got your white blood cell bodyguards attacking the myelin sheath, the connective tissue surrounding your nerve fibers so that your nerves degenerate, and you no longer can do things like breathe.
[00:38:15.324 --> 00:38:16.767]  This is exactly what my mother said.
[00:38:16.767 --> 00:38:18.670]  Your body starts eating your brain stem.
[00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:23.968]  Yes, your immune system destroys you.
[00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.729]  That's essentially what this amount is.
[00:38:25.729 --> 00:38:28.551]  So it is bio... Antibiotic, you know?
[00:38:28.551 --> 00:38:35.776]  This is why I love OxyCobra, because you're not dealing with antibiotics, you're dealing with absolute pro-everything.
[00:38:35.776 --> 00:38:39.918]  You're dealing with the normal way that the body would want to protect itself.
[00:38:39.918 --> 00:38:45.142]  Everything from electromagnetically to biologically, you're working with the body.
[00:38:45.362 --> 00:38:48.725]  We've had medical doctors here that say they're really super nano.
[00:38:48.725 --> 00:38:51.327]  Silver certainly does up with bacteria and viruses.
[00:38:51.327 --> 00:38:54.430]  Dr. Horowitz expanding on this.
[00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:56.172]  It's in the literature.
[00:38:56.172 --> 00:39:00.455]  They admit and doctors are telling their own families don't take it.
[00:39:00.455 --> 00:39:05.120]  It can attack your brain cells, attack your spine, attack your entire body.
[00:39:06.388 --> 00:39:10.710]  They bragged that they put cancer viruses in the polio vaccines.
[00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:13.411]  They admit they're eugenicists.
[00:39:13.411 --> 00:39:16.772]  Politically, how do you see this plan rolling out?
[00:39:16.772 --> 00:39:21.514]  And let me give you one little hint here or clue.
[00:39:21.514 --> 00:39:23.035]  I'm sure you're already on this.
[00:39:23.035 --> 00:39:25.956]  Back in January, we were saying we're going to launch some type of flu
[00:39:27.418 --> 00:39:28.719]  Fear-mongering.
[00:39:28.719 --> 00:39:33.525]  Because we saw them getting ready with mass graves, telling emergency managers, get ready for millions dead.
[00:39:33.525 --> 00:39:36.868]  That it wasn't a question of if, but when it was going to happen this fall.
[00:39:38.154 --> 00:39:40.596]  We went on air and said, will it be bird flu?
[00:39:40.596 --> 00:39:41.516]  Will it be something else?
[00:39:41.516 --> 00:39:42.057]  We don't know.
[00:39:42.057 --> 00:39:43.758]  They're saying flu.
[00:39:43.758 --> 00:39:48.041]  They're training that militias are going to try to attack and steal the flu supply.
[00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:53.044]  This was going on in January, in February, in March, before all this happened.
[00:39:53.044 --> 00:40:01.950]  We know, we've confirmed, they've been running drills at colleges all over the country for the last eight, nine months, now accelerating for locking down colleges.
[00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:07.934]  And the first place they're doing forced quarantines is college dorms, kind of as a propaganda psyop
[00:40:08.374 --> 00:40:11.836]  To show people the image of people locked down in their homes.
[00:40:11.836 --> 00:40:16.520]  The UN admits they're running all of this under level 6.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.321]  How do you see them trying to roll it out?
[00:40:19.431 --> 00:40:24.856]  Well, that's a beautiful summary of the psychological operation and the genocidal agenda.
[00:40:24.856 --> 00:40:38.228]  And that's exactly what also would indicate to any reasonably intelligent person that they've planned this long ago, that they basically wanted to make this profitable.
[00:40:38.228 --> 00:40:40.270]  This is the most profitable operation.
[00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.690]  Think about it.
[00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:44.614]  You've got FEMA operating, you've got the healthcare industry
[00:40:45.874 --> 00:40:50.236]  You've got the pharmaceuticals being sold, stockpiled, billions and billions of dollars.
[00:40:50.236 --> 00:40:54.477]  See, in essence, they don't even have to do anything anymore.
[00:40:54.477 --> 00:40:59.939]  They've already sold the stuff, but the problem is they have a depopulation agenda.
[00:40:59.939 --> 00:41:05.061]  They literally want to take out at least half, maybe two-thirds of the world's population.
[00:41:05.061 --> 00:41:06.381]  So this is the great
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.588]  You know, travesty, it's total fascism, it is absolutely despicable.
[00:41:12.588 --> 00:41:21.320]  From my perspective, it has no semblance of being human, there's no empathy, there's no compassion, there's no love, and sensitivity.
[00:41:22.125 --> 00:41:37.615]  And the future of our civilization, our humanity, is literally at stake because when you lose these types of, not just chemicals that go into the groundwater, everything from mercury and all the toxic waste, the antibiotics, I mean, when you take anything,
[00:41:38.035 --> 00:41:43.357]  When you take a vaccine, the murky, you gotta, ultimately, if you're gonna get rid of it, you're gonna pee it out.
[00:41:43.357 --> 00:41:48.479]  If you're gonna take an antibiotic, what goes in comes down and goes out into the groundwater.
[00:41:48.479 --> 00:41:50.060]  We are water.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.081]  80% of our bodies is water.
[00:41:51.081 --> 00:41:52.561]  The groundwater that we drink.
[00:41:52.561 --> 00:41:53.882]  This has been on the news too.
[00:41:53.882 --> 00:41:59.044]  So that these people are not like doing humanity or this planet a favor.
[00:41:59.298 --> 00:42:05.422]  And that's why they make the joke in Dr. Strangelove saying you're General Jack T. Ripper, i.e.
[00:42:05.422 --> 00:42:17.770]  Colonel Slimay, wanting to nuke the world if you're worried about your precious bodily fluids, because the establishment is obsessed with putting toxins and poisons into us, so we're psychologically, spiritually
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.222]  Clouded and drugged.
[00:42:21.222 --> 00:42:22.203]  That's pharmakia.
[00:42:22.203 --> 00:42:31.713]  You know, we have these sorcerers of the New World Order getting us drunk on their poison just like they'd get people drunk before they cut their hearts out in Chichen Itza at the Aztec Pyramids.
[00:42:31.713 --> 00:42:36.178]  Now, Dr. Horowitz, you just said something and I want to go back over and have you expand on it.
[00:42:37.298 --> 00:42:39.199]  So it looks like we're concurring.
[00:42:39.199 --> 00:43:00.371]  They've already won, to a certain extent, fear-mongering, bringing more federal control in worldwide, expanding government control, testing federalization, having excuses to talk about 400,000 troops on the streets, NORTHCOM, as a beta test for future bioweapons releases, and then the organizing of carrying out that event.
[00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:06.716]  But we need to get the word out so they don't go hot with this flu and really wipe out a bunch of people.
[00:43:06.716 --> 00:43:10.899]  Now, will the soft kill weapons be in the flu vaccine?
[00:43:10.899 --> 00:43:15.243]  Or are they going to release something else and say that's the swine flu?
[00:43:15.243 --> 00:43:18.465]  If they go really hot with this, how do you see it unfolding?
[00:43:18.465 --> 00:43:20.087]  How bad do you think this flu is going to be?
[00:43:20.939 --> 00:43:28.354]  Well, if they went really hot with it, and it is a high likelihood, because they're going to have to, you know, not have a rerun of 1976.
[00:43:28.354 --> 00:43:28.635]  So basically...
[00:43:31.917 --> 00:43:36.880]  There's a good possibility that aerosolized weaponry will be activated.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:47.806]  You may have the black helicopters that come around, start to spray, and basically populations in, let's say, Los Angeles are highly at risk for this kind of thing.
[00:43:47.806 --> 00:43:57.592]  Around, you know, interestingly enough, October, the end of October, early November, if they play out the whole plan that they have the capability of doing,
[00:43:58.286 --> 00:43:59.947]  That's what they'll end up doing.
[00:43:59.947 --> 00:44:16.257]  They'll be spraying the population, and then they will initiate the outbreaks that they're going to decree are horrific, and then the mainstream media, and that's really all they need in order to, in every state of the nation, persuade people to adopt the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act.
[00:44:16.257 --> 00:44:20.620]  At the end of that, now you've got everybody incarcerated in FEMA camps.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:24.422]  Most profitable, most population controlling, and most devastating.
[00:44:26.542 --> 00:44:29.103]  But I always see them doing it in phases.
[00:44:29.103 --> 00:44:32.824]  This is maybe in five, six different phases.
[00:44:32.824 --> 00:44:45.828]  We're into phase three now, where they want to beta test, kill 20, 30, 40,000, 100,000, scare everybody, get everybody trained to do what they're told in the next phase when they kill 20 million.
[00:44:45.828 --> 00:44:53.991]  And then after that, the super mega death phase, where they kill the majority of the world's population, as the White House science chief has basically sworn to do.
[00:44:54.949 --> 00:44:58.592]  That's exactly the way I see it, too, from the psychological operation.
[00:44:58.592 --> 00:45:03.155]  Basically, you know, how you boil a frog is, you know, slowly.
[00:45:03.155 --> 00:45:04.476]  And that's what they're doing here.
[00:45:04.476 --> 00:45:07.078]  And that's exactly what, you know, you start with SARS.
[00:45:07.078 --> 00:45:18.767]  You saw SARS as a complete psychological operation to get the world to understand that the World Health Organization and the Rockefeller family were going to be controlling all of the emergency response and the biopreparedness.
[00:45:19.327 --> 00:45:28.753]  And so this is now, you know, a few years later, they have advanced the exact agenda you're talking about, and now people are prepared.
[00:45:28.753 --> 00:45:35.197]  They're prepared for even the event that I've been talking about as potentially the hottest one.
[00:45:35.197 --> 00:45:40.861]  That's how, in answer to your question, how the worst-case scenario could be played out.
[00:45:40.861 --> 00:45:42.102]  I would be looking at
[00:45:42.882 --> 00:45:55.374]  October or November, end of October, early November for somebody to lose something from some lab and ultimately that would then create a large media
[00:45:56.272 --> 00:45:57.353]  Let's do it.
[00:46:13.223 --> 00:46:14.764]  He always lies.
[00:46:14.764 --> 00:46:19.207]  If he came out and said it's going to be mandatory, then I would think it wouldn't be mandatory.
[00:46:19.207 --> 00:46:20.468]  He always lies.
[00:46:20.468 --> 00:46:22.550]  He always breaks his promises.
[00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:27.333]  And under level six, under the who, they say they can force-inoculate now.
[00:46:27.333 --> 00:46:30.895]  They've got the states all passing the laws to force-inoculate.
[00:46:30.895 --> 00:46:32.176]  That's in the news.
[00:46:32.176 --> 00:46:35.399]  So he has his surrogates out saying it's going to be mandatory.
[00:46:35.399 --> 00:46:37.780]  Then he plays the part of the conciliator.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.181]  He's going to make you feel good.
[00:46:39.181 --> 00:46:41.343]  He's going to pat you on the back on the conciliare.
[00:46:41.863 --> 00:46:48.686]  He's going to tell you everything's okay and notice he wants to address the kids starting next week.
[00:46:48.686 --> 00:47:08.094]  Every week the kids will be brought into jumbo screens and he's enlisting them to aid him and Rahm Emanuel saying a domestic force, a paramilitary, Van Jones is saying that they're going to use the green jobs to take over the entire economy and then Media Matters comes out and says I'm a liar, there's no plan for compulsory service.
[00:47:09.094 --> 00:47:12.055]  This is classic tyranny.
[00:47:12.055 --> 00:47:13.615]  Your comments on that, Dr. Horowitz?
[00:47:13.615 --> 00:47:16.376]  Yeah, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[00:47:16.376 --> 00:47:18.717]  Evidence for what you're saying is very clear.
[00:47:18.717 --> 00:47:21.357]  Go to Fluescam.com.
[00:47:21.357 --> 00:47:24.158]  It's the definitive website on this whole matter.
[00:47:24.158 --> 00:47:27.139]  Fluescam.com.
[00:47:27.139 --> 00:47:32.060]  There, one of many documents, including a PDF file from the World Health Organization,
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.964]  Actually laying out the agenda of exactly what you just talked about.
[00:47:36.964 --> 00:47:55.141]  How they encourage all this biopreparedness, this Model State Emergency Health Powers Act functioning, and ultimately they intimate that this is where we will have to go as this now pandemic expands into tyranny.
[00:47:56.249 --> 00:48:02.837]  And this is the cover to get the unpopular eugenics healthcare passed.
[00:48:02.837 --> 00:48:06.562]  This is the cover to get the whole bioethics system passed.
[00:48:06.562 --> 00:48:11.749]  This is the cover to get the Clean Water Restoration Act, total federalization of above and below ground water.
[00:48:11.749 --> 00:48:13.811]  Basically the entire United States has water under it.
[00:48:14.612 --> 00:48:21.200]  This is the cover to pass the anti-gun bills, the anti-free speech bills, that openly say you have no more free speech.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:27.807]  This is the cover to pass the Cybersecurity Act, where quote, the President can kill the Internet to save the Internet.
[00:48:27.807 --> 00:48:33.954]  This is the cover for people to not worry about him expanding the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan, they just announced.
[00:48:34.554 --> 00:48:41.640]  I see this, and now congressman Brown, Paul, and even Army, former Republican leader, has come out and said that.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:49.487]  So when you hear mainline Republicans like Brown and Army saying this is a cover for martial law, you better know it's serious.
[00:48:49.487 --> 00:48:50.949]  Your comments on that, Dr. Horowitz.
[00:48:51.269 --> 00:48:54.052]  Yes, and one additional thing that it's a cover for.
[00:48:54.052 --> 00:48:59.017]  Taking out people's access to the botanicals and the herbs and the natural healing remedies.
[00:48:59.017 --> 00:49:03.842]  They completely, hideously, gross criminal negligence.
[00:49:03.842 --> 00:49:11.810]  That's what they are doing with this whole concept that you've got to get vaccinated and intoxicated in order to defend yourself against the swine flu.
[00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:23.098]  There are so many wonderful natural healing methods that they should be telling people about, but because it's a drug cartel-influenced agenda, essentially you've got no mention.
[00:49:23.098 --> 00:49:34.507]  That is killing people, that is gross criminal negligence in and of itself, and it goes along with the Codex Elementarius legislation, where again, this is fascism strangling people.
[00:49:34.507 --> 00:49:35.368]  That's what they're about.
[00:49:36.874 --> 00:49:39.437]  The amazing thing is they've introduced the anti-gun bills.
[00:49:39.437 --> 00:49:41.039]  They've introduced the bills that ban speech.
[00:49:41.039 --> 00:49:42.441]  It's passed the House.
[00:49:42.441 --> 00:49:48.247]  They introduced bills to set up youth brigades and passed one setting up the federal body to carry it out.
[00:49:49.204 --> 00:49:56.510]  They, in Europe, in many countries, under the Codex Alimentarius, are making vitamin C and fish oil prescription.
[00:49:56.510 --> 00:50:00.533]  So instead of paying $10 for a bottle, they're literally paying $250.
[00:50:00.533 --> 00:50:13.084]  It's really happening, and they do this psy-op of denying, denying, denying, denying, denying, as they roll forward, just like the tanks at Waco, as they were shooting the people, were broadcasting, this is not an assault.
[00:50:14.082 --> 00:50:14.482]  Right.
[00:50:14.482 --> 00:50:26.545]  You know, the lie that they keep saying that this is safe, that these vaccines are tested, any, again, reasonably intelligent person would know that they can't possibly go long term.
[00:50:26.545 --> 00:50:30.525]  You know, if you get bitten by a snake, it doesn't, you don't die instantly.
[00:50:30.525 --> 00:50:33.706]  It takes a certain amount of time for the toxicity to build up.
[00:50:33.706 --> 00:50:39.627]  Likewise, when you get injected with foreign genetic material, it takes years, potentially, for cancers to come out.
[00:50:39.627 --> 00:50:43.768]  So the reality is that they absolutely are lying in your face.
[00:50:44.128 --> 00:50:51.374]  You know, what people should remember is what they told the Holocaust victims as they marched them into the concentration camp gas chambers.
[00:50:51.374 --> 00:50:55.697]  They told them they were going there for public health, for disinfection.
[00:50:55.697 --> 00:50:58.259]  Today they're telling people to go get vaccinated for the same reason.
[00:50:58.259 --> 00:50:58.940]  Stay there.
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:50:59.260]  Stay there.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:11.803]  Are you suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeats, clogged arteries?
[00:51:11.803 --> 00:51:13.863]  If so, you are not alone.
[00:51:13.863 --> 00:51:17.464]  Millions of people are suffering from one or more of these problems.
[00:51:17.464 --> 00:51:29.988]  If you'd like to live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy, and youthfulness, and experience your body healing itself, then this might be the most important message you'll
[00:51:30.208 --> 00:51:30.688]  I don't think so.
[00:52:00.959 --> 00:52:02.379]  It is a big idea.
[00:52:02.379 --> 00:52:05.200]  A New World Order.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:10.022]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:52:10.022 --> 00:52:12.923]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:52:12.923 --> 00:52:15.703]  Put their objective being world domination.
[00:52:15.703 --> 00:52:18.884]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:52:18.884 --> 00:52:26.186]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:52:29.229 --> 00:52:34.670]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:38.551]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:52:38.551 --> 00:52:41.111]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:52:41.111 --> 00:52:42.272]  Most people have no idea.
[00:52:42.272 --> 00:52:43.052]  They're not after money.
[00:52:43.052 --> 00:52:44.332]  They have all the money they need.
[00:52:44.332 --> 00:52:45.312]  They're after power.
[00:52:45.312 --> 00:52:46.472]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:53:00.098 --> 00:53:09.180]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:19.083]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.

[00:53:51.966 --> 00:53:54.648]  They railed against the crown Another ragtag band Declaring independence
[00:54:21.021 --> 00:54:28.044]  Dr. Horowitz is going to be with us for this segment and the next.
[00:54:28.044 --> 00:54:34.827]  We got Dr. Russell Blaylock, neurologist, brain surgeon, coming up to back up everything Horowitz has been talking about here today in great detail.
[00:54:36.602 --> 00:54:42.186]  Dr. Horowitz, I had psychology today viciously savage me.
[00:54:42.186 --> 00:54:49.271]  And they basically say I'm schizophrenic and imagined I was at a Bilderberg group meeting and imagined I was being followed.
[00:54:49.271 --> 00:54:52.414]  It didn't matter if Secret Service was there, it was on the news.
[00:54:52.414 --> 00:54:58.898]  They just say I'm completely, it was having basically a complete psychotic hallucination.
[00:54:58.898 --> 00:55:04.122]  Like I was on, you know, a thousand milligrams of pure LSD.
[00:55:05.203 --> 00:55:08.846]  This isn't going to work anymore, them just stonewalling.
[00:55:08.846 --> 00:55:13.589]  And I think about psychiatrists, psychologists, the Nazis first used them.
[00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:15.971]  The Soviets used them.
[00:55:15.971 --> 00:55:18.633]  They say we're crazy.
[00:55:18.633 --> 00:55:22.416]  They always use the medical system as their tyranny.
[00:55:22.416 --> 00:55:28.180]  The eugenics in this country, the family courts were set up, as you know, to carry out eugenics and sterilization.
[00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:31.923]  We still have these unconstitutional courts today that don't have due process.
[00:55:32.503 --> 00:55:38.748]  And we have state officials here in Texas when they were asked why 69% of school kids, foster kids, are on psychotropic drugs.
[00:55:38.748 --> 00:55:40.749]  They said, well, they have bad genes.
[00:55:40.749 --> 00:55:44.752]  So, this is really a murderous cult.
[00:55:44.752 --> 00:55:45.072]  Absolutely.
[00:55:45.072 --> 00:55:47.734]  You know, I want to say congratulations to you.
[00:55:47.734 --> 00:55:50.857]  You know, Bo Greitz, I know you know, he's a friend of ours.
[00:55:50.857 --> 00:55:56.421]  He always, always say to me, Len, you know, the flack never gets heavy until you're over the target.
[00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:12.360]  And so if you're getting whacked by psychology today, or all of us, you may all of us at the forefront, and I'm so happy you have Russell Blaylock on coming up, because again, we're all getting whacked because we're over the target.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.782]  And so, you know, just keep it up, Alex.
[00:56:15.964 --> 00:56:16.504]  Well, thank you.
[00:56:16.504 --> 00:56:18.245]  I know that's a great analogy, World War II.
[00:56:18.245 --> 00:56:25.126]  I think Bogart's dad actually died over Germany, and so that's why Bo likes that analogy, but it certainly isn't.
[00:56:25.126 --> 00:56:30.407]  When you're over the target, that's when you are going to be getting the flack, and we are dropping the big truth bombs on them.
[00:56:30.407 --> 00:56:33.328]  Okay, continuing, how do you see them rolling this out?
[00:56:33.328 --> 00:56:36.049]  I mean, you think they're going to go, may go hot with it?
[00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:38.649]  And B, what do we do to get the word out to stop them?
[00:56:38.649 --> 00:56:41.230]  I mean, is there anything in your educated opinion
[00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:42.313]  We can do it.
[00:56:42.313 --> 00:56:44.481]  It seems like they are losing some steam.
[00:56:44.481 --> 00:56:47.833]  They're out having to tell us that, oh yeah, we think the vaccine's safe.
[00:56:48.803 --> 00:57:03.435]  Well, again, it's really, gee whiz, I wish I had a crystal ball, you know, but the reality is the worst case scenario I've laid out, the other least problematic scenario would be that they've already done the harm.
[00:57:03.435 --> 00:57:13.004]  They've already purchased, they've stockpiled, they've already brainwashed, they've already gotten at least probably a third of the United States public to
[00:57:13.804 --> 00:57:15.905]  They intend to roll up their sleeves.
[00:57:15.905 --> 00:57:20.928]  The sheeple are going to go back to the slaughter and they've got a victory.
[00:57:20.928 --> 00:57:25.231]  They've got food for their pharmaceutical cartel.
[00:57:25.231 --> 00:57:27.352]  They've got to have all these people sick.
[00:57:27.352 --> 00:57:29.893]  They're going to have it during the economic collapse.
[00:57:29.893 --> 00:57:32.655]  They're going to be well cared for financially.
[00:57:32.655 --> 00:57:36.557]  And on top of that they're going to be reducing a lot of the population, which is their goal.
[00:57:36.977 --> 00:57:39.439]  And it's going to be soft-killing them for a long time.
[00:57:39.439 --> 00:57:44.823]  And you know, with these soft-kill weapons, God only knows, they're now admitting to Kim trailing on the news.
[00:57:44.823 --> 00:57:47.245]  Who knows what we've already, all of us, had implanted in us.
[00:57:48.311 --> 00:57:49.331]  Yeah, well, certainly.
[00:57:49.331 --> 00:57:59.695]  Look at just the fact that the chemtrails have aluminum, and aluminum, a heavy metal, has a resonance frequency, and it has its transmission attenuation capacities.
[00:57:59.695 --> 00:58:14.341]  So, you know, for all we know, and it's a very highly suspect, because when you look at vaccination mercury, and you look at the decimation, particularly of our children, this autistic spectrum that they've been covering up and lying about,
[00:58:14.941 --> 00:58:23.943]  You know, you've got to see that these people are totally about population reduction, population control, and spiritual energetic suppression.
[00:58:23.943 --> 00:58:36.406]  They just love the power trip that they write their textbooks how they're killing us and then they have John P Holdren on David Letterman saying how great he is.
[00:58:36.406 --> 00:58:38.867]  It's just, it's just all a big sick joke to them.
[00:58:38.867 --> 00:58:39.327]  Stay with us.

[00:58:50.358 --> 00:58:55.661]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:55.661 --> 00:59:00.203]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:02.464]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:59:02.464 --> 00:59:04.084]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:59:04.084 --> 00:59:05.125]  There is a solution.

[00:59:55.924 --> 01:00:05.250]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:06.550]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:08.311]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.311 --> 01:00:10.073]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:11.654]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.654 --> 01:00:13.215]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.215 --> 01:00:17.397]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.397 --> 01:00:21.460]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.637 --> 01:00:26.318]  Dr. Russell Blaylock coming up.
[01:00:26.318 --> 01:00:29.319]  Neurologist to back up everything Dr. Horowitz has been talking about.
[01:00:29.319 --> 01:00:35.662]  We've got a filmmaker shifting gears in the next 50 minutes covering a host of issues with the film Crude.
[01:00:35.662 --> 01:00:39.424]  About what the oil companies are doing in Latin America.
[01:00:39.424 --> 01:00:42.646]  Harrowing tales coming up with the filmmaker.
[01:00:43.866 --> 01:00:45.267]  Joe Bellinger.
[01:00:45.267 --> 01:00:50.951]  But in the four or five minutes we have left with Dr. Len Horowitz, FluScam.com is his website.
[01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:53.552]  We have links to it up at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:53.552 --> 01:01:01.258]  Dr. Horowitz, in closing, we are beginning though to really have people listen to us and wake up.
[01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:02.398]  And that's the good news.
[01:01:02.398 --> 01:01:10.764]  And so much of what you and others were lone voices in the wilderness were talking about is now being validated and verified and vindicated.
[01:01:12.253 --> 01:01:31.059]  But at the same time, it seems like there's 30, 40, 50% of people that are kind of awake now, but then that other half are getting deeper into denial, and we just see them dying, and people that are 10 years old with cancer everywhere, and neighbors dying, and young women dying everywhere, and men dying, and disease everywhere.
[01:01:31.059 --> 01:01:32.359]  I mean, this is a holocaust.
[01:01:32.359 --> 01:01:37.021]  When the hell are people going to really wake up and realize that psychopathic killers are running things?
[01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:44.675]  You know, I think that most of us who are intelligent have already awakened to that reality.
[01:01:44.675 --> 01:01:51.581]  Those who haven't, they're, unfortunately, they're going to be taken out, and they're going to be taken out most expensively.
[01:01:51.581 --> 01:02:05.013]  You know, I think that the opportunity that currently exists, if we marshal the half of us who have awakened to literally create a revolution in healthcare, I think we could take this whole
[01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:08.566]  Pharmaceutical cartel totally out.
[01:02:08.566 --> 01:02:10.247]  I think people are fed up with it.
[01:02:10.247 --> 01:02:11.548]  I think people see it.
[01:02:11.548 --> 01:02:20.152]  I think what we need to do is boycott the organization and institutions and focus on exposing the criminals.
[01:02:20.152 --> 01:02:31.097]  Continue to do that, but I think that the ultimate goal would be to establish a healthy world organization that literally has the power to overtake the World Health Organization.
[01:02:31.537 --> 01:02:44.440]  And focused instead of on toxicity, on all of the natural botanicals and herbs, all of God's bounty that we've been naturally given to protect ourselves and to remedy all of the diseases.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:50.861]  I'm looking forward to a world, Alex, you know me, I'm a humanitarian and a visionary and a positive thinker.
[01:02:50.861 --> 01:02:56.142]  I'm looking forward to a world where we literally can lie down with a lamb, we can
[01:02:56.622 --> 01:02:59.204]  Exists with H1N1, H5N1.
[01:02:59.204 --> 01:03:01.746]  We could blow it out with rice frequency generators.
[01:03:01.746 --> 01:03:07.992]  We could eliminate all of the problems with the botanicals and the herbs, the essential oils, the homeopathics.
[01:03:07.992 --> 01:03:18.561]  This is really where we should be, and we would be, just like we could drive around in cars that are running on water with no pollution.
[01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:24.726]  Likewise, we could take care of our bodies for minimal cost and absolute optimal efficacy.
[01:03:26.823 --> 01:03:31.210]  Well, as this develops, Dr. Horowitz, we'll continue to check in with you and...
[01:03:34.039 --> 01:03:56.378]  You know bad things happen and I know it's sad what happened to your mother and we're very sorry for your loss but I think through that journey and that happening that caused you as a doctor to look into these things and then save potentially tens of millions of people and so sometimes bad things that happen turn into blessings in the end and we just really hope that everybody out there listening researches the claims
[01:03:57.359 --> 01:04:05.972]  And looks at what we put out here so that their five-year-old isn't dying of cancer next year and and really realize that when we get up here and tell you the White House
[01:04:07.108 --> 01:04:11.069]  Science czar openly wants you and your family dead.
[01:04:11.069 --> 01:04:12.889]  We're not joking about this, okay?
[01:04:12.889 --> 01:04:14.430]  This is real.
[01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:17.031]  And tyranny and genocide is real.
[01:04:17.031 --> 01:04:18.731]  Tyranny and genocide is the norm.
[01:04:18.731 --> 01:04:20.591]  Freedom has been the exception.
[01:04:20.591 --> 01:04:23.212]  Fluscam.com is the website.
[01:04:23.212 --> 01:04:24.292]  Great information up there.
[01:04:24.292 --> 01:04:28.653]  Dr. Lynn Horowitz, always informative and enlightening to have you on.
[01:04:28.653 --> 01:04:29.594]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:04:29.594 --> 01:04:33.695]  I'd also recommend people check out OxySilver.com.
[01:04:33.695 --> 01:04:34.515]  Awesome protection.
[01:04:35.447 --> 01:04:36.327]  All right, God bless you.
[01:04:36.327 --> 01:04:37.408]  Appreciate you coming on with us.
[01:04:37.408 --> 01:04:38.909]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:42.510]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:47.792]  This radio show morphs into a television show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:47.792 --> 01:04:48.973]  Go up there and link in.

[01:04:55.156 --> 01:04:57.957]  Straight ahead with Dr. Russell Blaylock and a lot more.
[01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:05.777]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:05:30.814 --> 01:05:31.494]  We're good.
[01:06:01.087 --> 01:06:04.090]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:09.415]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:09.415 --> 01:06:11.476]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:11.476 --> 01:06:16.481]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:16.481 --> 01:06:17.382]  How much do you want?
[01:06:17.642 --> 01:06:18.763]  When do you want it?
[01:06:18.763 --> 01:06:20.644]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:21.725]  When will you need it?
[01:06:21.725 --> 01:06:23.926]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:23.926 --> 01:06:25.267]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:25.267 --> 01:06:26.788]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:26.788 --> 01:06:32.072]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:32.072 --> 01:06:35.654]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:35.654 --> 01:06:39.117]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:39.457 --> 01:06:40.678]  How much will you need?
[01:06:40.678 --> 01:06:41.598]  We don't know.
[01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:42.698]  How much do you want?
[01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:43.619]  All you can get.
[01:06:43.619 --> 01:06:44.719]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.719 --> 01:06:47.760]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:07:54.011 --> 01:07:55.472]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:57.193]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.672 --> 01:08:17.876]  Joe Berlinger is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[01:08:17.876 --> 01:08:21.259]  He's an award-winning filmmaker, journalist, and photographer.
[01:08:21.259 --> 01:08:30.027]  His films include landmark documentaries like Brother's Keeper, Paradise Lost, The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills, and Metallica's Some Kind of Monster.
[01:08:30.527 --> 01:08:38.877]  His most recent film, the multi-award-winning Crude, debuted at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and is scheduled for theatrical release in September.
[01:08:38.877 --> 01:08:39.998]  It is September.
[01:08:39.998 --> 01:08:45.204]  The inside story of the controversial 27 million Amazon Chernobyl case in Ecuador.
[01:08:46.417 --> 01:08:57.043]  And it goes on, Stephen Holden of the New York Times says, crude, rarely have such conflicts been examined with the depth and power that Joe has engaged in.
[01:08:57.043 --> 01:09:00.525]  So we've got him here with a documentary, crude, amazing film.
[01:09:00.525 --> 01:09:05.027]  We're going to be playing some clips, though there is some profanity in it because it's a documentary.
[01:09:05.027 --> 01:09:07.449]  So most of it will just be video in the background while Joe
[01:09:08.289 --> 01:09:30.794]  uh... is talking will play the trailer to coming up here on the radio slash tv show people tune in all the time i get emails why are you talking about video i'm listening to you on this radio station this is the twenty first century it's not just a document camera or a video cam like limbaugh has cameras all over the studio it's a tv studio now got document cam video clips
[01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:32.715]  Full production crew.
[01:09:32.715 --> 01:09:33.236]  It's great.
[01:09:33.236 --> 01:09:39.423]  You can watch it live if you're a PrisonPlanet.TV member.
[01:09:39.423 --> 01:09:42.406]  So Joe, it is great to have you on with us, my friend.
[01:09:42.406 --> 01:09:42.786]  Sure.
[01:09:42.786 --> 01:09:43.487]  It is a pleasure.
[01:09:43.487 --> 01:09:46.210]  I've missed you since we hung out a few years ago.
[01:09:47.253 --> 01:10:11.003]  Yeah, for people that don't know about that, and I guess it's probably the first time that you've talked about it, or at least publicly, that I know of, three point plus million dollar budget, biggest for Discovery Channel ever, you're an award-winning, top-tier documentary maker with your partner, you come out, interview me for several of the episodes, and tell folks what happened with that.
[01:10:11.003 --> 01:10:15.424]  Well, we had a series for Discovery called
[01:10:17.608 --> 01:10:30.192]  Well, I don't even remember what our, oh, Tribes of America was the name of the series, and a woman named Jane Root, who used to run the Discovery Network, loved our work and hired us to do the series about different kind of subcultures in America.
[01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:40.416]  And one of the subcultures we wanted to explore was the world of you and, you know, the clear-eyed kind of news you like to deliver, and we thought that would be an interesting show.
[01:10:40.416 --> 01:10:42.937]  You know, the so-called conspiracy theorists.
[01:10:44.077 --> 01:10:47.479]  And obviously, you know, what you guys think of yourselves.
[01:10:47.479 --> 01:10:51.221]  I should include myself amongst them.
[01:10:51.221 --> 01:10:59.265]  And, you know, we did a great episode with you and a couple other people in your community.
[01:10:59.265 --> 01:11:00.966]  You were, of course, the star of the show.
[01:11:00.966 --> 01:11:03.887]  We did a number of other episodes on different kinds of communities.
[01:11:05.983 --> 01:11:33.387]  Uh, and at the 12th hour, after $3 million had been spent on this television series, the woman who hired us, who was actually the head of the network, uh, ended up getting fired, replaced by another guy named John Ford, and of course, as is typical in corporate America at these, um, television places, and I guess I'm biting the hand that feeds me, but, uh, you know, all the projects that this woman had greenlit were thrown out the door, and a whole new set of programs
[01:11:34.477 --> 01:11:37.798]  But your project was shot very close to being done.
[01:11:37.798 --> 01:11:43.200]  That's what, you know, we did an episode on evangelical street preachers.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.381]  We did an episode on the New York Diamond community.
[01:11:46.381 --> 01:11:53.903]  We did an episode, actually, your episode was called Alternative Radio.
[01:11:53.903 --> 01:11:56.003]  And then one on robotics.
[01:11:56.003 --> 01:12:00.225]  One on robotics, one on this community in the desert.
[01:12:02.846 --> 01:12:06.007]  It was two years ago, so I've been so involved in the Amazon.
[01:12:06.007 --> 01:12:07.468]  It was Carnies!
[01:12:07.468 --> 01:12:14.591]  Yeah, we did one on Carnies, and then we did one on these people living in bunkers in the desert.
[01:12:14.591 --> 01:12:18.513]  That was a great series, and it was 99% shot.
[01:12:18.513 --> 01:12:20.014]  The money had been spent.
[01:12:20.014 --> 01:12:22.875]  We were in the final phase of the post-production.
[01:12:22.875 --> 01:12:24.856]  Your show in particular was fantastic.
[01:12:25.755 --> 01:12:30.277]  Yeah, you were there when I got arrested and they shoved Etienne with his $100,000 camera down for no reason.
[01:12:30.277 --> 01:12:30.977]  I mean, this was intense.
[01:12:47.739 --> 01:12:48.699]  It's a great episode.
[01:12:48.699 --> 01:12:58.905]  You know, the whole series was this kind of cinema verite exploration of these different groups of people who aren't your traditional kind of citizen.
[01:12:58.905 --> 01:13:05.408]  And, you know, at the 12th hour, the show was canceled and the stuff, you know, wasn't even aired.
[01:13:05.408 --> 01:13:16.734]  And, you know, I'd be the first one to say if the show stunk, you know, I understand why they didn't air them, but these were high quality documentaries made by, you know, very good documentary makers.
[01:13:17.205 --> 01:13:27.415]  And it's that they just fell victim to the usual thing, you know, like they'd rather waste $3 million worth of production than the new guy airing this stuff.
[01:13:27.415 --> 01:13:33.601]  And, you know, realizing they made a mistake in firing this person because the shows do well.
[01:13:33.601 --> 01:13:38.946]  So we had that and we had another TV series that they just buried called San Quentin Film School.
[01:13:38.946 --> 01:13:41.289]  So these two projects that had originated with
[01:13:42.509 --> 01:13:52.034]  With this woman who since moved on and was fired, the new regime just kind of just, you know, jettisoned all of this great work.
[01:13:52.034 --> 01:13:55.416]  Yeah, back to Pentagon programming, but also behind the scenes we were talking
[01:13:56.246 --> 01:13:58.246]  Yeah, because you really were doing a fair piece.
[01:13:58.246 --> 01:13:59.367]  It'd make us look like angels.
[01:13:59.367 --> 01:14:00.367]  It was what really happened.
[01:14:00.367 --> 01:14:00.827]  Yeah.
[01:14:00.827 --> 01:14:06.528]  They came to you, you said, and said that they were trying to put, you know, would I debate a neocon?
[01:14:06.528 --> 01:14:07.268]  Would I?
[01:14:07.268 --> 01:14:15.750]  And then, even though you were talking with me about, my God, they really are trying to manipulate this, then that wasn't even enough for them.
[01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:17.330]  They just threw the whole thing in the fire.
[01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:21.191]  Yeah, after, you know, and it's one thing to cancel a show or cancel a series.
[01:14:21.744 --> 01:14:32.027]  You know, at the development stage or at the early stage where a show is not yet shot, but here you have literally three million dollars worth of production.
[01:14:32.027 --> 01:14:39.030]  You'd think they'd at least err at some odd hour just to at least get some economic value out of it.
[01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:41.991]  This is like aborting a 17-year-old.
[01:14:41.991 --> 01:14:43.871]  Right when you're about to get him out of the house.
[01:14:43.871 --> 01:14:44.972]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:14:44.972 --> 01:14:47.693]  It was very heartbreaking and I was particularly disappointed.
[01:14:50.272 --> 01:14:53.374]  With your episode being cancelled, because I thought that was a lot of fun.
[01:14:53.374 --> 01:14:55.555]  It was very interesting.
[01:14:55.555 --> 01:14:57.496]  I forget, who was the guy?
[01:14:57.496 --> 01:14:57.956]  Rance?
[01:14:57.956 --> 01:14:59.157]  Jeff Rance?
[01:14:59.157 --> 01:15:01.178]  Yeah, Rance.
[01:15:01.178 --> 01:15:08.082]  He was profiled and another guy was profiled, but you were kind of the star of the episode and the stuff we shot of you in New York getting arrested.
[01:15:09.947 --> 01:15:10.608]  Yeah, it was.
[01:15:10.608 --> 01:15:12.709]  Well, I know you're here to talk about Crude.
[01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:21.636]  Tell us first, it's opening now, where people can see it, in what cities, amazing cinematography, really serious stuff.
[01:15:21.636 --> 01:15:31.144]  Yeah, no, it's a film that kind of changed my life and really opened my eyes up to some fundamental truths.
[01:15:31.144 --> 01:15:35.007]  Shot over a three-year period in the rainforests of Ecuador.
[01:15:36.077 --> 01:15:42.359]  Uh, you know, if you go to our website, www.crewedthemovie.com, you'll see all the places it's playing.
[01:15:42.359 --> 01:15:47.461]  You know, it's a small, you know, platform release, so we're rolling out city by city.
[01:15:47.461 --> 01:15:56.444]  It opens, uh, this week in, well, sorry, next week, September 9th in New York City at the Newark, uh, not the Newark, that's L.A.
[01:15:56.444 --> 01:16:00.825]  It opens at the IFC Center in New York on September 9th.
[01:16:00.825 --> 01:16:03.646]  It opens at the Newark in Los Angeles September 18th.
[01:16:04.642 --> 01:16:10.805]  The Lumiere in San Francisco on September 25th, and then we start adding cities like crazy.
[01:16:10.805 --> 01:16:17.448]  And I know you're based in Austin, so it's coming to the Dobie, you know, the landmark Dobie Theater October 9th.
[01:16:17.448 --> 01:16:21.570]  And hopefully I'm going to come down, but maybe you can come help me do a Q&A or something.
[01:16:22.472 --> 01:16:29.298]  Yeah, I'm going to be done with my film, Fall of the Republic, by then and it'll be getting printed up on DVD, so I'll kind of be over the hump.
[01:16:29.298 --> 01:16:32.680]  And I would love, Joe, to come see you again.
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:37.104]  And I'm just watching clips of the film, reminding me how well this film is done.
[01:16:37.104 --> 01:16:41.547]  I mean, this looks like film, but it was shot, I guess, in HD?
[01:16:41.547 --> 01:16:48.033]  Yeah, we use these little HD cameras, and you know, the technology is so good, you get a really nice look.
[01:16:48.713 --> 01:16:56.940]  And actually, for the theatrical release, we ended up transferring it to 35mm, you know, for theaters, and I'm surprised at how great it looked.
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:58.141]  It really held up nicely.
[01:16:58.141 --> 01:17:09.991]  You know, there's beautiful light down there that, of course, helped, and that beautiful light kind of, you know, put a spotlight on the disgusting and horrible pollution that is the subject of the film.
[01:17:14.204 --> 01:17:20.666]  Had roughly 15% higher wages than us, so most of their industry came down here in the 70s and 80s.
[01:17:20.666 --> 01:17:26.788]  NAFTA and GATT lowered the Mexican standard and the United States standard, that's clear now.
[01:17:26.788 --> 01:17:32.330]  I mean, most of Michigan looks like a third world war zone.
[01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:36.072]  And now as they continue the free, quote, fair trade, the race to the bottom,
[01:17:37.212 --> 01:17:43.693]  Uh, we need to look at what's going on in Ecuador and Mexico, because that's how we're going to be living now, or something closer to it.
[01:17:43.693 --> 01:17:48.694]  And your film investigates that, and you had to worry about kidnappings, you had to have armed guards.
[01:17:48.694 --> 01:17:53.135]  I mean, this was a journey into hearts of darkness, Joe.
[01:17:53.135 --> 01:17:55.696]  So when we come back, let's get into it.
[01:17:55.696 --> 01:18:02.317]  But let's start with the film and some of the adventures, and then some of the backstories, some of the things we won't see in the film.
[01:18:02.317 --> 01:18:04.177]  Okay, sounds good.
[01:18:04.177 --> 01:18:05.598]  Go ahead and start telling us about it.
[01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:06.698]  Oh, I thought you were queuing up for
[01:18:07.654 --> 01:18:08.637]  I'm saying we are coming.
[01:18:08.637 --> 01:18:09.279]  We got a few minutes.
[01:18:09.279 --> 01:18:09.660]  Go ahead.
[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:10.201]  Okay.
[01:18:10.201 --> 01:18:13.229]  Well, you know, I mean, basically, you know, I went, I'll just...
[01:18:13.806 --> 01:18:18.049]  Talking about how I got started, you know, I kind of got dragged into this film kicking and screaming.
[01:18:18.049 --> 01:18:30.518]  You know, the lawyer on behalf of these 30,000 plaintiffs, which are rainforest dwellers, indigenous people, came to me and told me about this pollution and said, you gotta make a film about it.
[01:18:30.518 --> 01:18:33.240]  It sounded preposterous.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:38.044]  I couldn't believe that what he was telling me was true, but I went down and looked at it for myself and there I saw
[01:18:38.664 --> 01:18:48.295]  An area the size of Rhode Island, a 1,700 square mile swath of the Amazon rainforest, completely despoiled through oil production.
[01:18:48.295 --> 01:18:58.526]  You know, for 30 years Texaco drilled oil, and when you drill for oil and the oil comes up out of the ground, you have to separate what's called formation water.
[01:18:59.817 --> 01:19:02.579]  Um, from, uh, the marketable crude.
[01:19:02.579 --> 01:19:10.424]  The crude goes off the market and then this water is, which is filled with toxins, is supposed to be re-injected back into the well cavity.
[01:19:10.424 --> 01:19:15.767]  Instead, for 30 years, they just pumped it into the rivers and streams that feed the Amazon River.
[01:19:15.767 --> 01:19:21.071]  That also has been the home of these five indi- well, actually six indigenous tribes.
[01:19:21.071 --> 01:19:23.192]  One of them has since become extinct.
[01:19:23.192 --> 01:19:27.715]  But the five indigenous tribes that are actually part of this lawsuit, this was their backyard.
[01:19:28.395 --> 01:19:38.160]  Um, and there are now skyrocketing rates of cancer, leukemia, uh, childhoods, uh, you know, 15 out of 20 children that are born have these terrible skin rashes.
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:40.401]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:53.408]  And in addition to releasing this toxic water directly into the rivers and streams that feed the Amazon River, you know, hundreds and hundreds of these giant unlined pits were carved out of the jungle, uh, and a lot of
[01:19:54.045 --> 01:19:56.327]  Joe Berlinger, stay there.
[01:19:56.327 --> 01:19:59.250]  Let's come back and talk about this on the other side.
[01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:01.413]  The new film is crude.
[01:20:01.413 --> 01:20:07.699]  eCigarettesNational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.

[01:21:01.281 --> 01:21:07.962]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:07.962 --> 01:21:16.064]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:16.064 --> 01:21:24.246]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:24.246 --> 01:21:28.987]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:29.327 --> 01:21:34.549]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:34.549 --> 01:21:38.911]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:38.911 --> 01:21:39.991]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:21:56.820 --> 01:22:07.067]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.067 --> 01:22:14.072]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:22:14.634 --> 01:22:21.218]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:21.218 --> 01:22:23.199]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:23.199 --> 01:22:25.700]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:36.666]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:37.279 --> 01:22:38.920]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.800]  It's about a one world government.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:47.703]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:24:07.059 --> 01:24:09.220]  Filmmaker Joe Berlinger is our guest.
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:10.460]  The film is Crude.
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:14.321]  We've been playing some clips for people watching us on the web.
[01:24:14.321 --> 01:24:20.382]  For radio listeners, you can visit the website of the film.
[01:24:20.382 --> 01:24:24.063]  Joe, where's the best place for people to go to find out more about Crude?
[01:24:24.063 --> 01:24:31.025]  Well, yeah, basically our website, www.crudethemovie.com, and we've got a whole set of
[01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:41.340]  Information about the film, clips, the trailer, links to other organizations, how you can see it, how you can get involved.
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:49.085]  Now, I want to get into what's happening to these native peoples there, but also just the adventure of being down there.
[01:24:49.085 --> 01:24:51.547]  I mean, are you worried about the oil companies coming after you?
[01:24:51.547 --> 01:24:52.968]  They do whatever they want in Latin America.
[01:24:53.257 --> 01:24:56.559]  Yeah, well, when I was down there, I was very nervous.
[01:24:56.559 --> 01:24:58.360]  You know, I did not make my presence known.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:07.066]  Luckily, there were a lot of NGOs, like Amazon Watch, monitoring the trial to make sure it took place.
[01:25:07.066 --> 01:25:13.029]  And so I just kind of, you know, had small cameras and a very small crew and did a lot of the shooting myself.
[01:25:13.029 --> 01:25:15.371]  So I just kind of slipped in with the local media.
[01:25:16.296 --> 01:25:19.141]  Uh, and the local, not the local, but the NGO people.
[01:25:19.141 --> 01:25:23.990]  Uh, and I did not go and knock on doors and get interviews.
[01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:26.194]  I was just there to film the trial because, you know,
[01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:41.804]  First of all, we were a mile and a half from the Colombian border at times, where the FARC in that particular part of Colombia and Ecuador, where the FARC, the guerrilla, anti-government guerrillas, are very active and they, you know, kidnap Americans for ransom.
[01:25:41.804 --> 01:25:44.066]  So that worried me.
[01:25:44.066 --> 01:25:48.030]  There was also an area where the drug runners were very active.
[01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:52.654]  So, you know, when I checked into my hotel, in quotation marks, my hotel in the little
[01:25:52.654 --> 01:25:53.515]  Yeah, I was a little nervous.
[01:26:14.054 --> 01:26:26.402]  You know, it was also a malaria zone, so we were covered head-to-toe with jungle gear and slathering ourselves up with industrial-strength beet spray to keep the mosquitoes at bay.
[01:26:26.402 --> 01:26:27.342]  Sounds hellish!
[01:26:27.342 --> 01:26:28.603]  It was terrible, actually.
[01:26:28.603 --> 01:26:34.607]  I mean, it was 120-degree equatorial heat, you know, because you're right at the equator.
[01:26:34.607 --> 01:26:38.489]  And the worst thing is you're standing in front of these massive pollution sites, these giant
[01:26:39.548 --> 01:26:41.230]  I don't think so.
[01:27:00.407 --> 01:27:09.957]  Which is anti-malarial preventative medication because you know the CDC indicates that this is a malaria zone and that stuff may be psychotic.
[01:27:09.957 --> 01:27:22.190]  Man, I had my first or second night in this hotel I felt like I was having my Martin Sheen apocalypse now hotel room moment because the stuff was
[01:27:23.916 --> 01:27:29.477]  Well, by the way, one squadron, as I'm sure you know, of Delta Force came home from Afghanistan on that.
[01:27:29.477 --> 01:27:30.278]  Yeah.
[01:27:30.278 --> 01:27:32.098]  And three groups killed their families.
[01:27:32.098 --> 01:27:33.438]  The other guy killed himself.
[01:27:33.438 --> 01:27:36.059]  So, yeah, that stuff's got to be taken off the market.
[01:27:36.059 --> 01:27:37.699]  Oh, without question.
[01:27:37.699 --> 01:27:42.540]  You know, I mean, it made me really queasy.
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:48.742]  Really, I was literally grabbing my bed and just praying that I'd get through the night.
[01:27:48.742 --> 01:27:52.803]  So, subsequent shoots, I stopped taking the Valoran and just wore heavy clothing.
[01:27:53.922 --> 01:27:57.323]  Covered myself up with, you know, the best bug spray money could buy.
[01:27:57.323 --> 01:28:00.003]  Um, you know, so it was not an easy assignment.
[01:28:00.003 --> 01:28:02.043]  And then you add to it the emotional toll.
[01:28:02.043 --> 01:28:05.304]  I mean, you're talking to native people whose lives have been destroyed.
[01:28:05.304 --> 01:28:07.865]  You know, this was a cultural genocide.
[01:28:07.865 --> 01:28:09.385]  Um, and they've been poisoned.
[01:28:09.385 --> 01:28:12.225]  There's no, there's no drinking water anywhere.
[01:28:12.225 --> 01:28:14.826]  Um, you walk around these, these villages.
[01:28:14.826 --> 01:28:21.407]  I mean, the thing that really made me want to make the film is, you know, is, you know, on my first scouting mission, I got out of the canoe.
[01:28:22.308 --> 01:28:32.555]  You know, we've taken a canoe down to one of these, uh, to the Kofan people, you know, you know, proud people who have lived there for millennia who live off the water, uh, use the water to bathe, to drink.
[01:28:32.555 --> 01:28:43.902]  You know, in this country we take it for granted, you go to the tap, there's water, but this is a place where the water has been completely polluted, and these are people who, you know, use the water for everything, transportation, bathing, drinking.
[01:28:43.902 --> 01:28:50.887]  Um, and I got out of the canoe and these people, you know, deep in the heart of the Amazon rainforest were, you know, preparing a meal using
[01:28:51.357 --> 01:29:09.130]  Industrial tuna, you know, the kind of canned tuna that you might get at Costco or something, you know, or a big restaurant supply company, you know, from another part of the world, deep in the heart of the rainforest, you know, these people were eating tuna because the fish in the river were either dead or deformed.
[01:29:09.130 --> 01:29:20.499]  And that kind of just, you know, was a real wake-up call for me about how, you know, I'm not smart enough to figure out whether Chevron should win or lose this trial, you know, as you'll see in the film.
[01:29:21.883 --> 01:29:25.525]  They've wrapped themselves up in enough legal arguments that who knows?
[01:29:25.525 --> 01:29:28.346]  Who knows if the justice system can prevail?
[01:29:28.346 --> 01:29:38.171]  But from a moral standpoint, it's just astounding that they would go into the backyard of these people and foul the place up.
[01:29:38.171 --> 01:29:46.015]  And you walk around these indigenous villages and what breaks your heart is, you know... Joe, stay there!
[01:29:46.015 --> 01:29:46.415]  Stay there!
[01:29:46.415 --> 01:29:48.156]  Tell us about that when we get back.
[01:29:48.156 --> 01:29:48.656]  Gotta break.
[01:29:51.556 --> 01:29:55.479]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.479 --> 01:30:00.503]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.503 --> 01:30:05.827]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:30:05.827 --> 01:30:10.351]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:30:10.351 --> 01:30:12.633]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:30:12.633 --> 01:30:14.254]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:30:14.254 --> 01:30:15.275]  There is a solution.
[01:30:15.515 --> 01:30:23.942]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:31:00.486 --> 01:31:04.708]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:31:04.708 --> 01:31:06.708]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:31:06.708 --> 01:31:15.231]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:31:15.231 --> 01:31:20.793]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:31:20.793 --> 01:31:22.414]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:31:22.654 --> 01:31:29.156]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:31:29.156 --> 01:31:40.219]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:31:40.219 --> 01:31:40.679]  That's right.
[01:31:40.979 --> 01:31:43.541]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:31:43.541 --> 01:31:45.362]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[01:31:45.362 --> 01:31:45.622]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:31:45.622 --> 01:31:48.183]  Or visit A Cola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:31:48.183 --> 01:31:48.824]  That's acolablue.com.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.860]  Are you constantly tired?
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:04.701]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[01:32:04.701 --> 01:32:08.002]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[01:32:08.002 --> 01:32:11.022]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[01:32:11.022 --> 01:32:17.664]  Liquid Zeolite, available only at RestoreYourHealthNow.com, captures toxins and physically carries them out of your body.
[01:32:17.664 --> 01:32:21.965]  This safe and effective way of detoxifying can easily remove heavy metals and contaminants.
[01:32:22.305 --> 01:32:30.895]  Studies show that liquid zeolite captures triggering antigens which cause allergies, migraines, and asthma, decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.
[01:32:30.895 --> 01:32:39.345]  Liquid zeolite is a tasteless and odorless liquid that, when taken daily, supports a healthy, happy, and active lifestyle in an increasingly toxic world.
[01:32:39.345 --> 01:32:42.068]  And liquid zeolite is so gentle that you won't even know you're taking it.
[01:32:42.108 --> 01:32:43.508]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[01:33:15.336 --> 01:33:24.745]  We're going to go back to the filmmaker of Crude, The Real Price of Oil, coming out in movie theaters, art houses across the country.
[01:33:24.745 --> 01:33:26.087]  Very important documentary.
[01:33:26.087 --> 01:33:31.953]  We'll give you that website as well before our guest leaves us, but we're going to go back to Joe in just a moment.
[01:33:31.953 --> 01:33:34.815]  I want to tell you about one of the sponsors who made this hour possible.
[01:33:34.815 --> 01:33:37.979]  That's acolablue.com, atmospheric water generator.
[01:33:38.519 --> 01:33:39.940]  Well, this would really help the folks down there.
[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:42.802]  They're in the middle of the Amazon but can't use their own water.
[01:33:42.802 --> 01:33:50.408]  It grabs the water out of the air and then puts it through a seven-stage filter including reverse osmosis and carbon and UV.
[01:33:52.659 --> 01:33:56.403]  Did you know you could be drinking fresh, clean water made right from the air you breathe?
[01:33:56.403 --> 01:33:58.085]  This isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[01:33:58.085 --> 01:34:02.430]  Our sponsor, Ecola Blue, with the Ecola Blue 28 machine, will allow you to do just that.
[01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:09.278]  Seven and a half gallons a day, they have bigger units if you want them, and it holds the water inside of the system in a stainless steel tank.
[01:34:09.278 --> 01:34:11.881]  It looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on type.
[01:34:12.561 --> 01:34:15.823]  It's acolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, or 1-800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, acolablue.com.
[01:34:15.823 --> 01:34:17.184]  And then also, don't forget that
[01:34:30.307 --> 01:34:46.903]  I'm also a documentary filmmaker and have authored a book and published another book and a lot of other great books and videos and materials that I think is the most important work out there that I've seen or read is all available at our online bookstore and video store at InfoWars.com and your purchase of books and videos
[01:34:47.483 --> 01:34:56.232]  Also makes what we do here possible because we are self-financed in all the material and information we bring you on this radio show and with the news sites and the films.
[01:34:56.232 --> 01:34:58.874]  I want to thank everybody for their continual support.
[01:34:58.874 --> 01:35:02.237]  My film, The Obama Deception, films like Endgame, Terror Storm.
[01:35:02.237 --> 01:35:05.020]  We've got Camp FEMA coming out in two weeks.
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:07.983]  You can pre-order that to be the first to get it at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:09.164 --> 01:35:16.726]  And we have the books and of course the t-shirts and ball caps and other materials, the gear, there at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:35:16.726 --> 01:35:17.106]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:35:17.106 --> 01:35:18.827]  You can also write to me at PO Box 19549.
[01:35:27.069 --> 01:35:29.790]  Austin, Texas 787-60.
[01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:34.973]  You can also call and ask the operators questions about combos, discounts, different films.
[01:35:34.973 --> 01:35:39.575]  Some of my documentaries are as inexpensive as $5.95 per DVD.
[01:35:39.575 --> 01:35:40.935]  So again, check that out.
[01:35:40.935 --> 01:35:41.215]  P.O.
[01:35:41.215 --> 01:35:42.956]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 787-60.
[01:35:42.956 --> 01:35:44.597]  Okay, going back to Joe Berlinger.
[01:35:50.019 --> 01:35:55.540]  And the film, Crude, the real price of oil.
[01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:57.821]  Again, I want to get off the oil system.
[01:35:57.821 --> 01:36:01.541]  It's been great for us, but it has all this toxic waste associated with it.
[01:36:01.541 --> 01:36:08.703]  The greenhouse gas carbon tax thing is a red herring, in my researched opinion, to put a tax on carbon dioxide.
[01:36:08.703 --> 01:36:12.624]  Instead of going after, that's why oil companies are now behind the greenhouse gas.
[01:36:12.624 --> 01:36:13.624]  It gets them off the hook.
[01:36:14.164 --> 01:36:17.527]  For the cracking of the oil, the refining of the oil, the extracting it.
[01:36:17.527 --> 01:36:21.470]  Joe, you went down to Ecuador 25 times.
[01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:28.876]  I mean, that is just yeoman's work in this malaria-infested equatorial region.
[01:36:28.876 --> 01:36:33.540]  Third world with, you know, kidnappings and police state.
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.842]  Instead of me asking questions, you've got the floor.
[01:36:35.842 --> 01:36:42.368]  Let's talk more about why there's toxic waste, what this toxic waste is, what's happening down there, where all this is going.
[01:36:43.072 --> 01:36:53.159]  Yeah, and let me just say, you know, I agree that we should be thinking about, more than thinking about, moving towards alternative energy for a host of reasons.
[01:36:53.159 --> 01:36:56.261]  But this film is not an anti-oil film.
[01:36:56.261 --> 01:36:59.042]  It's an anti-corporate irresponsibility film.
[01:36:59.042 --> 01:37:05.406]  I mean, I'd be a hypocrite right now to be making an anti-oil film because, you know, I fly to film festivals on airplanes.
[01:37:05.406 --> 01:37:06.467]  I heat my house with oil.
[01:37:06.467 --> 01:37:07.348]  I drive a car.
[01:37:07.348 --> 01:37:10.630]  You know, we're all kind of stuck in this system until it changes.
[01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:15.072]  Um, but it's an anti-corporate irresponsibility film.
[01:37:15.072 --> 01:37:20.415]  You know, there's responsible ways of drilling for oil and irresponsible ways of drilling for oil.
[01:37:20.415 --> 01:37:33.382]  And what happened in the jungle down there, uh, you know, Texaco, we, you know, we use Texaco and Chevron interchangeably just to explain to the audience, uh, the, you know, the operator and the, and the, and the perpetrator of, of
[01:37:35.069 --> 01:37:40.291]  What I'm talking about is the Texaco Petroleum Company, which was purchased by Chevron.
[01:37:40.291 --> 01:37:44.833]  They merged in 2001, so with that, Chevron inherited the lawsuit.
[01:37:44.833 --> 01:37:47.474]  So sometimes I say Texaco, sometimes I say Chevron.
[01:37:47.474 --> 01:37:51.135]  They're the same at this point.
[01:37:51.135 --> 01:37:57.677]  But Texaco discovered oil in the 60s, down in this Amazon rainforest, this pristine jungle environment.
[01:37:59.813 --> 01:38:08.701]  They say that one of the few places on Earth that survived the last ice age was the Ecuadorian part of the Amazon rainforest.
[01:38:08.701 --> 01:38:18.451]  You know, most of the Amazon rainforest is in Brazil, but the headwaters of the Amazon begin in Ecuador and the Ecuadorian part of the rainforest.
[01:38:19.031 --> 01:38:28.939]  They say it's one of the few places on Earth that survived the last Ice Age, and therefore, that is the reason it has such incredible, you know, biodiversity.
[01:38:28.939 --> 01:38:33.803]  Over a quarter of the world's species are in this little part of... It's super ancient!
[01:38:33.803 --> 01:38:39.907]  For those that don't know, the Ice Age hasn't run over it, killing whatever was originally there, or displacing it.
[01:38:39.907 --> 01:38:46.873]  This is one of the most ancient places on Earth where you have a continually developing system, is what you're saying.
[01:38:47.073 --> 01:38:54.918]  Exactly, and of course, it barely has survived now the last 40 years of oil production because of the way in which it was done.
[01:38:54.918 --> 01:39:00.282]  You know, Texaco discovered oil, came in, they set up a consortium with the government.
[01:39:00.282 --> 01:39:09.828]  You know, the government is not blameless in this situation, but Texaco was, you know, created and operated this system that, as the plaintiffs say, was designed to pollute.
[01:39:10.348 --> 01:39:14.850]  Basically, there were three levels of pollution down there.
[01:39:14.850 --> 01:39:23.193]  The first and most insidious level of pollution is that when the crude oil comes up from the ground where it's been, you know,
[01:39:24.481 --> 01:39:29.025]  You know, hanging out beneath the Earth's surface for millions of years.
[01:39:29.025 --> 01:39:30.947]  It's mixed with water.
[01:39:30.947 --> 01:39:38.234]  That water is called formation water because it's been mixed in with the crude for, you know, eons.
[01:39:38.234 --> 01:39:44.259]  There's a process of separation where the marketable crude is separated out from the water.
[01:39:44.259 --> 01:39:49.664]  The marketable crude goes by pipeline to a port and is sent off so that we can go get it refilled.
[01:39:49.704 --> 01:39:51.464]  I mean, here in Texas, a lot of oil industry
[01:40:19.953 --> 01:40:25.137]  If any of that gets into the water table, it's a huge lawsuit, huge event.
[01:40:25.137 --> 01:40:25.777]  Absolutely.
[01:40:25.777 --> 01:40:31.341]  If this stuff happened in the United States, these people would be in jail, is my opinion.
[01:40:31.341 --> 01:40:34.504]  Chevron disputes that and claims otherwise.
[01:40:34.504 --> 01:40:38.987]  One of the problems with this case is that the court has been overwhelmed with paper and disinformation.
[01:40:41.510 --> 01:41:03.892]  Well, like you said, you're not a petroleum geologist, I'm not a chemist, but watching the film, we've been playing clips of it here in the background, you're by a river and you see the oil and the gasoline, the shininess, where the people are bathing and drinking, it's coming by, you see the black oil pouring out into the water, you see, I mean, that they clearly
[01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:09.457]  Yeah, so let me just so the listeners understand.
[01:41:09.457 --> 01:41:14.485]  So the oil, you know, the water and the oil are separated in this separation process.
[01:41:14.485 --> 01:41:18.251]  The oil goes off to market, the water is supposed to be re-injected into these
[01:41:18.968 --> 01:41:19.808]  Into these wells.
[01:41:19.808 --> 01:41:29.131]  Instead, it was literally pumped into the rivers and streams that feed the Amazon River that are also the home to... It used to be six indigenous tribes.
[01:41:29.131 --> 01:41:31.452]  Now it's five indigenous tribes.
[01:41:31.452 --> 01:41:34.073]  And these people just drank the water and didn't know better.
[01:41:34.073 --> 01:41:46.137]  In fact, we heard stories, I can't verify it though it was not included in the film, but we heard stories that actually the early oil development people actually told the locals that that formation water was
[01:41:47.406 --> 01:41:50.187]  You know, had vitamins and minerals and was good for you.
[01:41:50.187 --> 01:41:51.787]  You know, these people didn't know better.
[01:41:51.787 --> 01:41:58.108]  They trusted the, you know, they had never had contact with white people until about 40 years ago.
[01:41:58.108 --> 01:42:04.449]  You know, and again, I'm not, I just want to say... Well, hell, they tell us that sodium fluoride, that's a catch-all for hundreds of chemicals.
[01:42:04.449 --> 01:42:06.570]  We've got a tour of the Austin facility.
[01:42:06.570 --> 01:42:13.831]  It's hundreds of chemicals they put from the byproduct of fertilizer manufacturing in our water, so they tell us it's minerals.
[01:42:13.831 --> 01:42:14.331]  That's true.
[01:42:14.431 --> 01:42:15.952]  That's true.
[01:42:15.952 --> 01:42:22.076]  You know, so one level of pollution was just the direct piping for three decades of formation water.
[01:42:22.076 --> 01:42:30.542]  The other level of pollution is that they carved out of the jungle, unlined, and they will claim it's lined because the jungle clay is not permeable.
[01:42:30.542 --> 01:42:33.825]  You know, we saw evidence to the contrary.
[01:42:33.825 --> 01:42:36.266]  They carved these giant unlined pits.
[01:42:36.266 --> 01:42:43.912]  When a well is first dug, the initial stuff that comes up is just full of, it's just kind of a toxic soup of stuff that gets
[01:42:44.413 --> 01:42:47.440]  Dumped into these, uh, into these pits.
[01:42:48.723 --> 01:42:52.544]  And then whenever they do maintenance on the wells, more stuff gets dumped into these pits.
[01:42:52.544 --> 01:42:57.545]  And these pits are, you know, it's not unusual to have pits, but they're supposed to be cleaned up.
[01:42:57.545 --> 01:43:00.346]  And these pits were just left in the jungle.
[01:43:00.346 --> 01:43:11.428]  And what was a little unusual in the jungle version of these pits is that because it rains so much in the Amazon rainforest, that's why it's called the rainforest, these pits would overflow from rain.
[01:43:11.428 --> 01:43:14.069]  So they installed these gooseneck pipes.
[01:43:14.887 --> 01:43:28.074]  Uh, that allowed the rainwater, which then had been mixing with the petroleum, to, uh, you know, leach into the, um, well, to go right into the rivers and streams.
[01:43:28.074 --> 01:43:35.097]  And then the third level of pollution, which is not their fault, but, uh, because this is standard, uh, in oil production.
[01:43:35.097 --> 01:43:38.198]  That's one of the reasons oil production is just a messy business.
[01:43:38.198 --> 01:43:41.160]  Uh, the other byproduct of, um, of,
[01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:44.950]  Oil production is natural gas that if is not
[01:43:45.686 --> 01:43:50.629]  Brought to market often in these kinds of regions where it's difficult to bring it to the market, they just burn it off.
[01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:54.471]  That's why at oil production facilities, you see a flare going off.
[01:43:54.471 --> 01:44:04.057]  So imagine in the jungle, thousands of these flares adding to a black rain environment to an already assaulted environment that was once pristine.
[01:44:04.057 --> 01:44:07.319]  I mean, it just, it breaks your heart walking around these villages.
[01:44:07.319 --> 01:44:11.582]  You know, these, these, these Amazonian Indians who, you know,
[01:44:13.383 --> 01:44:19.665]  Had a very nice lifestyle, you know, in harmony with nature for millennia.
[01:44:19.665 --> 01:44:27.688]  You know, we forced these people into a quasi-Western lifestyle by virtue of the fact that we take away their traditional means of sustenance.
[01:44:27.688 --> 01:44:32.250]  You know, the animal stocks are depleted from the pollution, the fish in the river are dead.
[01:44:32.250 --> 01:44:36.251]  Well, I think that's the key here, is that you're saying they know now.
[01:44:36.251 --> 01:44:41.413]  Because if people were putting an act on, they would still eat the fish, but you're saying they won't eat the fish now.
[01:44:41.769 --> 01:44:43.210]  Well, they have to.
[01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:50.474]  That's the sad thing, looking into mother's eyes knowing that they're giving their children poisonous water because there's no other water.
[01:44:50.474 --> 01:44:53.776]  Nobody has come to the aid of these people.
[01:44:53.776 --> 01:44:55.496]  Whatever fish they can get, they eat it.
[01:44:55.496 --> 01:45:01.300]  So it's a primitive area with no infrastructure, and they're just drinking the water right out of...
[01:45:02.333 --> 01:45:09.360]  The streams and rivers that are just a mile or less away from all these toxic chemicals being dumped.
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:18.790]  I mean, I know enough about the oil industry just growing up in and around here in Texas that they're not following any of the same procedures or rules in Ecuador.
[01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:22.274]  Just looking what's on the video, this is just outrageous.
[01:45:22.894 --> 01:45:38.160]  Chevron claims that they were following the standards of the day, and that they cleaned up their mess, and that any mess is due to the fact that they turned over the operation to the state-run oil company called Petro-Ecuador.
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:42.221]  And it is true that Petro-Ecuador, because, you know, Texaco left in 92.
[01:45:42.221 --> 01:45:45.762]  They didn't get a renewal of their life, their concession from the government.
[01:45:45.762 --> 01:45:46.683]  They split.
[01:45:46.683 --> 01:45:47.223]  They turned this
[01:45:48.191 --> 01:45:52.213]  polluting system over to the state-run oil company called Petro-Ecuador.
[01:45:52.213 --> 01:46:05.141]  And one of the complicating factors of the case, and one of Chevron's, you know, legal points, is that Petro-Ecuador continued to pollute for a number of, well, until today, they've gotten their act cleaned up a little bit.
[01:46:05.141 --> 01:46:17.929]  You know, so Chevron points the finger at Petro-Ecuador, but, you know, that is kind of obfuscating the original issue, which is, in 93, this lawsuit was originally filed in the United States.
[01:46:18.698 --> 01:46:23.353]  Shortly after their departure because everyone saw that there was a polluted mess there.
[01:46:24.292 --> 01:46:25.692]  Well, I want to be clear.
[01:46:25.692 --> 01:46:33.135]  On this show, I expose that the whole greenhouse gas tax system written up by Enron is clearly a fraud.
[01:46:33.135 --> 01:46:35.936]  But then people get confused and say, well, wait, you're not for the environment.
[01:46:35.936 --> 01:46:43.358]  No, I don't want my children drinking toxic waste in the water, breathing poisons in the air, eating GMO foods.
[01:46:43.358 --> 01:46:46.739]  And the evidence is all of that is bad and hurting all of us.
[01:46:46.739 --> 01:46:48.840]  And this is something clearly in the film
[01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:49.660]  Yes.
[01:47:05.555 --> 01:47:07.896]  I mean, he goes back to the jungle.
[01:47:07.896 --> 01:47:18.260]  You know, the book written over a hundred years ago about people falling into the sausage machines and the coal plants not having scrubbers and, you know, all the toxic waste here.
[01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:23.762]  There is good things about environmentalism we've done that we need to do and continue to do.
[01:47:23.762 --> 01:47:32.105]  The problem is you have all these opportunists and NGOs coupling their agenda of just getting control of the economy to this
[01:47:32.805 --> 01:47:33.065]  I don't
[01:47:53.522 --> 01:48:14.530]  Film that I know you're just hoping to even get your investment back is a great social investment you've made and I really respect you for what you've done because this is a film that most people wouldn't have the courage on multiple fronts being down there in that hellhole and also dealing with the oil companies so I really do commend your courage.
[01:48:14.810 --> 01:48:15.611]  Thank you.
[01:48:15.611 --> 01:48:36.764]  You know, I went down on this initial scouting mission and I just was embarrassed to be an American if it were true that an American company, whether it was legal or not, whether they protected themselves through legal, you know, releases, as they claim, and all sorts of whatever things that are beyond my training.
[01:48:36.764 --> 01:48:42.828]  You know, legal or not, to me, what has been done in this region, I feel, is morally bankrupt.
[01:48:43.635 --> 01:49:00.708]  You know, when I went back to my nice home in New York and, you know, tucked my two children in in their separate bedrooms and turned on my tap and had a, you know, drink of relatively clean water, I just felt like how could I turn my back on these people who have been screwed over, you know, by the system in a way
[01:49:07.099 --> 01:49:11.922]  You had to have armed guards while you were there because of the kidnapping or because of threats?
[01:49:11.922 --> 01:49:12.283]  Why?
[01:49:12.283 --> 01:49:14.344]  Well, we didn't really have armed guards.
[01:49:14.344 --> 01:49:17.927]  I don't know where, maybe that's where you got that from.
[01:49:17.927 --> 01:49:19.388]  Well, I was watching some of the video.
[01:49:19.388 --> 01:49:21.649]  I mean, you had a bodyguard with you, correct?
[01:49:21.649 --> 01:49:24.231]  Oh, no, those were, I mean, there were lots of soldiers there.
[01:49:24.231 --> 01:49:26.173]  I mean, we didn't, I didn't have armed guards.
[01:49:26.173 --> 01:49:27.994]  I didn't want to call attention to, I mean, we were,
[01:49:28.618 --> 01:49:37.924]  Very nervous and there were some occasions where we were followed and our hotel room was ransacked on one occasion.
[01:49:37.924 --> 01:49:42.728]  You know, I can't tell you if that was local punks, local drug runners, local affiliates of the oil company.
[01:49:42.728 --> 01:49:49.292]  I mean, I tried to fly way below the radar and I felt like if I came with armed guards... Okay, I must have gotten confused.
[01:49:51.525 --> 01:49:55.088]  Maybe you were talking about getting armed guards a couple years ago when I was talking to you.
[01:49:55.088 --> 01:49:56.329]  Oh, that's possible, that's possible.
[01:49:56.329 --> 01:50:05.858]  But I decided not to call attention to myself because I just wanted to get this thing in the can under the radar and then deal with it later.
[01:50:07.313 --> 01:50:07.993]  Absolutely.
[01:50:07.993 --> 01:50:12.955]  Chicanery is the use of tricks to deceive someone, usually to extract money from them.
[01:50:12.955 --> 01:50:14.635]  I think that's a good definition.
[01:50:14.635 --> 01:50:27.059]  I want to come back and play the trailer, audio for the radio listeners, video for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers right now, of the film, and it's up on the site, CrudeTheMovie.com.
[01:50:27.059 --> 01:50:32.781]  Now the only problem with playing the audio for listeners is they're not going to see the Spanish translation.
[01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:36.224]  That's okay, we have a big Spanish audience.
[01:50:36.224 --> 01:50:38.929]  It's only two minutes long.
[01:50:38.929 --> 01:50:41.012]  We'll play it for folks.
[01:50:41.012 --> 01:50:42.615]  Joe Berlinger is our guest.

[01:53:02.759 --> 01:53:05.681]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:53:05.681 --> 01:53:07.922]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:53:07.922 --> 01:53:09.482]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:53:09.482 --> 01:53:11.203]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[01:53:11.203 --> 01:53:14.085]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:53:14.085 --> 01:53:18.327]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:53:18.327 --> 01:53:27.371]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:53:27.371 --> 01:53:32.254]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:53:33.743 --> 01:53:36.045]  Inside, John.
[01:53:36.045 --> 01:53:38.666]  How dare you?
[01:53:38.666 --> 01:53:43.549]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:53:43.549 --> 01:53:46.451]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:53:46.451 --> 01:53:52.915]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:53:55.757 --> 01:53:58.038]  Or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[01:53:58.038 --> 01:54:00.520]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:54:04.551 --> 01:54:26.436]  Joe Berlinger's film premieres for two weeks only the IFC Center in New York City starting September 9th coming up next Wednesday then it opens September 18th Los Angeles Irvine it comes to September 25th to San Francisco Berkeley San Diego October 9th in Philadelphia and Austin Texas

[01:54:53.593 --> 01:54:55.774]  We have links up on infowars.com.
[01:54:55.774 --> 01:54:57.716]  You know, I said I'd play the trailer, but he's right.
[01:54:57.716 --> 01:55:01.218]  A lot of it's in Spanish and subtitles.
[01:55:01.218 --> 01:55:12.386]  So just go to the site and you can see it right there, them ladling the toxic chemicals right out of the... and burning down the rainforest.
[01:55:12.386 --> 01:55:14.828]  I guess they also had a lot of oil fires down there too, Joe.
[01:55:15.288 --> 01:55:18.751]  I mean, it's just, you know, legal, not legal.
[01:55:18.751 --> 01:55:26.078]  I'm not smart enough to figure out all that stuff, but it's certainly immoral, I think, to go into a region like that and just to spoil it.
[01:55:26.078 --> 01:55:34.346]  I mean, we also heard horrible stories of oil workers raping the local women, stuff that I didn't include in the film because we couldn't verify it.
[01:55:34.346 --> 01:55:40.392]  But even if it's a quarter true, I mean, some of the stories I heard, you know, made the
[01:55:41.457 --> 01:55:43.538]  Basically a Wild West free-for-all.
[01:55:43.538 --> 01:55:50.023]  A Wild West, with this colonial, arrogant prejudice towards indigenous people.
[01:55:50.023 --> 01:55:51.244]  That's really why I made the film.
[01:55:51.244 --> 01:55:57.848]  You know, we were talking between the break that, you know, I did find some money for this, but a lot of it was paid for by myself.
[01:55:57.848 --> 01:56:05.954]  And initially I was just paying for it myself because, you know, I just was angry and upset that, and it was like this, I felt guilty for being white, you know.
[01:56:05.954 --> 01:56:09.456]  There was this, you know,
[01:56:10.697 --> 01:56:16.782]  For 600 years, you know, white people have treated indigenous people horribly, including how we started this own country.
[01:56:16.782 --> 01:56:26.570]  You know, we all know somewhere in the back of our heads that the Denny's over there used to be a Cherokee village, like a real Cherokee village, not something at Disneyland.
[01:56:26.570 --> 01:56:33.536]  And, you know, I used to kind of just think about it from time to time and think, oh, well, that's in the distant past.
[01:56:33.536 --> 01:56:36.418]  But the reality is multinational behavior.
[01:56:37.199 --> 01:56:37.600]  I think so.
[01:56:42.763 --> 01:56:46.266]  Joe, I agree with you, but I think it's more than just white.
[01:56:46.266 --> 01:57:09.807]  Any powerful empire, whether it was the Japanese or whoever, or the Aztecs, they end up abusing the weaker group, and this multinational system is doing bad things to us in America, whether we're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, but certainly if we allow this to happen down there, it can certainly go on here, and that's why I salute you for making the film crude, and I'll definitely try to come
[01:57:10.607 --> 01:57:13.949]  Uh, to the event when you are here in Austin.
[01:57:13.949 --> 01:57:16.470]  In fact, I had that little card here in my hand.
[01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:18.411]  When is it coming to Austin?
[01:57:18.411 --> 01:57:22.053]  It's October 9th at the Dobie.
[01:57:22.053 --> 01:57:27.776]  October 9th at the Dobie, and it's running for a few weeks, I think, here in Austin, yes.
[01:57:27.776 --> 01:57:29.076]  Unfortunately, just for a week.
[01:57:29.076 --> 01:57:34.619]  You know, this is the type of movie that unless people show up that first weekend, it's gonna die a quick death, you know?
[01:57:34.619 --> 01:57:40.062]  It's not, uh... You know, people like it's entertainment, so hopefully people will show up.
[01:57:40.450 --> 01:57:42.891]  So, so two weeks in New York, but a week in the other cities.
[01:57:42.891 --> 01:57:43.151]  Yeah.
[01:57:43.151 --> 01:57:47.212]  Folks, you definitely need to get out to see Crude.
[01:57:47.212 --> 01:57:48.892]  Joe, set it up.
[01:57:48.892 --> 01:57:51.113]  Come in studio when you're here in town.
[01:57:51.113 --> 01:57:52.453]  Check out the new setup.
[01:57:52.453 --> 01:57:55.614]  And I just appreciate the great work that you're doing.
[01:57:55.614 --> 01:57:59.916]  You are a true humanitarian, and thanks to people like you, this planet may have a chance.
[01:57:59.916 --> 01:58:04.197]  Well, I thank you, and you keep up the good work.
[01:58:04.197 --> 01:58:06.437]  You're obviously doing incredibly important work.
[01:58:09.028 --> 01:58:11.690]  The truth will out, that's my opinion.
[01:58:11.690 --> 01:58:13.071]  Eventually.
[01:58:13.071 --> 01:58:13.771]  Absolutely.
[01:58:13.771 --> 01:58:17.334]  Okay, well it premieres next week in New York City, September 9th.
[01:58:17.334 --> 01:58:19.135]  Joe, take care of yourself.
[01:58:19.135 --> 01:58:19.636]  Thank you.
[01:58:19.636 --> 01:58:20.416]  Take care, Alex.
[01:58:20.416 --> 01:58:21.117]  Good to talk to you.
[01:58:21.973 --> 01:58:22.713]  Good talking to you.
[01:58:22.713 --> 01:58:24.934]  Joe Berlinger, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:58:27.274 --> 01:58:33.996]  Our websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, jonesreport.com, and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:58:33.996 --> 01:58:36.197]  And my newest film is The Obama Deception.
[01:58:36.197 --> 01:58:38.637]  You can pre-order Camp FEMA right now.
[01:58:38.637 --> 01:58:42.598]  It starts shipping in two weeks.
[01:58:42.598 --> 01:58:46.019]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.019 --> 01:58:48.020]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.087 --> 01:58:56.291]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:58:56.291 --> 01:59:00.314]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:59:00.314 --> 01:59:06.218]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:06.218 --> 01:59:06.859]  It's true.
[01:59:06.859 --> 01:59:11.282]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.282 --> 01:59:17.827]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:59:17.827 --> 01:59:21.049]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:59:21.269 --> 01:59:21.629]  We're good.
[01:59:53.911 --> 01:59:56.312]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.312 --> 02:00:01.435]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.435 --> 02:00:02.195]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.881 --> 02:00:08.643]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.643 --> 02:00:10.385]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.385 --> 02:00:11.986]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.986 --> 02:00:13.548]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.548 --> 02:00:17.752]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.752 --> 02:00:21.817]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.972 --> 02:00:29.853]  We will be taking calls.
[02:00:29.853 --> 02:00:32.534]  I ran out of time with Dr. Horowitz on earlier.
[02:00:32.534 --> 02:00:37.976]  We will be taking calls in the next hour and a half, hour and 40 minutes with Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[02:00:37.976 --> 02:00:49.159]  In the last 20 minutes of the show or so, I'm going to get into this Van Jones thing and Obama wanting to have all the kids, quote, serve him and he's going to enlist them.
[02:00:49.159 --> 02:00:51.280]  This is part of the National Compulsory Service.
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:53.161]  I'm going to go over some of that at the end of the show today.
[02:00:54.437 --> 02:01:01.182]  I really appreciate Dr. Russell Blaylock spending over an hour and a half with us lined up today.
[02:01:01.182 --> 02:01:04.544]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is a board-certified neurosurgeon, author, and lecturer.
[02:01:04.544 --> 02:01:16.572]  He attended the LSU School of Medicine in New Orleans and completed his general surgical internship as a neurosurgical residency at the Medical University of South Carolina at Charleston, South Carolina.
[02:01:16.572 --> 02:01:18.214]  During his residency, he ran the Neuro
[02:01:19.374 --> 02:01:25.535]  Neurology program for one year and did a fellowship in neurosurgery after his residency for the last 25 years.
[02:01:25.535 --> 02:01:29.816]  He has practiced neurosurgery in addition to having a nutritional practice.
[02:01:29.816 --> 02:01:34.817]  He recently retired from both practices and devoted full time to nutritional studies and research.
[02:01:34.817 --> 02:01:37.597]  Dr. Blaylock has written and illustrated three books.
[02:01:37.597 --> 02:01:43.258]  The first book was on the subject of excitotoxins, the taste that kills, and it just goes on and on.
[02:01:43.258 --> 02:01:47.839]  He developed a lot of widely used forms of procedures in brain surgery.
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:52.566]  And you just go to his website, BlaylockReport.com.
[02:01:52.566 --> 02:01:56.994]  That's Blaylock, B-L-A-Y-L-O-C-K, report.com.
[02:01:56.994 --> 02:01:58.938]  And he's here today to talk about...
[02:01:59.867 --> 02:02:23.936]  The flu first, the chemicals they put in there to create an autoimmune response, why the government's having to admit now NRATs causing neurodegenerative diseases, causing all sorts of joint problems, early onset of just all sorts of problems.
[02:02:23.936 --> 02:02:27.278]  Dr. Blaylock's going to go over that today, but also then
[02:02:28.206 --> 02:02:29.867]  What's happening with the excitotoxins?
[02:02:29.867 --> 02:02:31.648]  What's happening with MSG?
[02:02:31.648 --> 02:02:34.310]  What's happening with aspartame?
[02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:37.032]  And why he believes this is going on.
[02:02:37.032 --> 02:02:42.516]  So, Dr. Russell Blaylock with us today to go over this in great detail and take your phone calls.
[02:02:42.516 --> 02:02:47.840]  Dr. Blaylock, thanks for being here.
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:48.941]  Do we have Dr. Blaylock there?
[02:02:50.759 --> 02:02:53.040]  We may have lost his line.
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:59.223]  We've been having some phone systems go up and down today.
[02:02:59.223 --> 02:03:04.426]  So we will get the network to call him if we need to.
[02:03:04.426 --> 02:03:05.467]  Just give the number to Genesis.
[02:03:05.467 --> 02:03:08.388]  We'll do it that way.
[02:03:08.388 --> 02:03:14.471]  They're fiddling with the phone system.
[02:03:14.471 --> 02:03:15.272]  This is important.
[02:03:15.272 --> 02:03:17.373]  I mean, this is really going on.
[02:03:17.373 --> 02:03:19.134]  And now we have the medical report.
[02:03:21.417 --> 02:03:26.919]  That has been put out, internally leaked out of the CDC here in the U.S.
[02:03:26.919 --> 02:03:34.362]  and the British medical system in England, that it's causing these degenerative brain diseases.
[02:03:34.362 --> 02:03:36.643]  Dr. Blaylock, sorry we lost you there.
[02:03:36.643 --> 02:03:49.709]  I was bringing up, we're about to go to break, but I was bringing up these internal reports have now been leaked, saying exactly what you said years ago, that these vaccines are causing all sorts of brain disorders.
[02:03:49.709 --> 02:03:49.889]  Right.
[02:03:52.176 --> 02:04:04.163]  Well, you know, what we're looking at now, because of the new discovery of stealth viruses, this could be much greater than we know, because a lot of these neurological disorders are more immediate.
[02:04:04.163 --> 02:04:16.309]  But the stealth viruses, these hidden viruses and vaccines, could cause neurological disease decades later, which really makes it difficult to make that positive connection.
[02:04:16.309 --> 02:04:20.852]  And that's sort of what they depend on, is that the connections are to make, went through
[02:04:21.921 --> 02:04:22.261]  I think so.
[02:04:42.023 --> 02:04:47.310]  Not just the viruses and RNA in these vaccines, but what is the mercury doing?
[02:04:47.310 --> 02:04:49.753]  What is the squalene doing?
[02:04:49.753 --> 02:04:56.862]  Why do we see massive increases in all sorts of different diseases in the literature being associated with the vaccines?
[02:04:56.862 --> 02:04:57.924]  We're talking to Russell Blaylock.
[02:04:57.924 --> 02:04:58.565]  Please stay with us.
[02:05:01.377 --> 02:05:04.399]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:04.399 --> 02:05:09.722]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:09.722 --> 02:05:11.783]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:11.783 --> 02:05:16.766]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:16.766 --> 02:05:17.687]  How much do you want?
[02:05:17.947 --> 02:05:19.068]  When do you want it?
[02:05:19.068 --> 02:05:20.949]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:20.949 --> 02:05:22.030]  When will you need it?
[02:05:22.030 --> 02:05:24.232]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.232 --> 02:05:25.573]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:25.573 --> 02:05:27.114]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:27.114 --> 02:05:32.378]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.378 --> 02:05:35.961]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:35.961 --> 02:05:39.424]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:39.764 --> 02:05:40.984]  How much will you need?
[02:05:40.984 --> 02:05:41.885]  We don't know.
[02:05:41.885 --> 02:05:43.005]  How much do you want?
[02:05:43.005 --> 02:05:43.925]  All you can get.
[02:05:43.925 --> 02:05:45.025]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:45.025 --> 02:05:48.066]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:05:48.066 --> 02:05:49.846]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:49.846 --> 02:05:50.767]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:00.455 --> 02:06:04.679]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:06:04.679 --> 02:06:06.681]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:06:06.681 --> 02:06:15.210]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:06:15.210 --> 02:06:20.775]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:06:20.775 --> 02:06:22.397]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:06:22.617 --> 02:06:29.142]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:06:29.142 --> 02:06:40.191]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:06:40.191 --> 02:06:41.572]  That's right, clean water.
[02:06:41.872 --> 02:06:43.513]  Right from the air you breathe.
[02:06:43.513 --> 02:06:45.333]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[02:06:45.333 --> 02:06:45.633]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:06:45.633 --> 02:06:48.154]  Or visit A Cola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:06:48.154 --> 02:06:48.734]  That's acolablue.com.
[02:07:01.314 --> 02:07:02.996]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:07:02.996 --> 02:07:04.737]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:07:04.737 --> 02:07:12.562]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:07:12.562 --> 02:07:15.764]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[02:07:15.764 --> 02:07:19.206]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[02:07:19.645 --> 02:07:32.198]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[02:07:32.198 --> 02:07:34.220]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[02:07:34.220 --> 02:07:35.942]  I use one every day.
[02:07:35.942 --> 02:07:38.344]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[02:07:38.684 --> 02:07:39.204]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.444 --> 02:08:10.967]  mainstream media government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.967 --> 02:08:12.549]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.549 --> 02:08:14.110]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.110 --> 02:08:18.293]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.293 --> 02:08:24.179]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.179 --> 02:08:29.503]  Okay, Dr. Russell Blaylock has just joined us for stations that just tuned in or listeners.
[02:08:29.503 --> 02:08:31.205]  It's BlaylockReport.com.
[02:08:31.205 --> 02:08:33.567]  He is a brain surgeon, neurologist,
[02:08:34.614 --> 02:08:39.339]  For decades, speaking out against vaccines causing degenerative diseases.
[02:08:39.339 --> 02:08:53.172]  I had Dr. Horowitz on earlier, whose mother was killed by this Gilean, Bernay or Murray, where the body has an autoimmune response and starts eating the nerves.
[02:08:53.172 --> 02:08:55.154]  The media is admitting
[02:08:56.169 --> 02:08:57.230]  Well, just the vaccine itself.
[02:08:57.230 --> 02:09:01.893]  The problem they're always dealing with is trying to make the body react to the agent that you want to immunize against, for instance, flu.
[02:09:24.081 --> 02:09:31.367]  Trying to get the body to react intensely enough to give you immunity for a long period of time.
[02:09:31.367 --> 02:09:36.892]  Well, the whole basis of vaccination is unphysiological.
[02:09:36.892 --> 02:09:44.718]  Almost all the infections that enter the body go through either the nasal passages or the GI tract.
[02:09:44.718 --> 02:09:52.525]  Well, that's where 80% of your immune system exists, and it's designed to have the first exposure to these agents.
[02:09:53.603 --> 02:09:55.805]  And it's all carefully coordinated.
[02:09:55.805 --> 02:10:07.372]  Well, what you're doing with the vaccine, you're bypassing that, injecting it into deep muscle tissue, which is completely an abnormal entrance for this organism.
[02:10:07.372 --> 02:10:13.715]  And so you get an abnormal immune reaction, particularly in children, small babies, you get a very abnormal reaction.
[02:10:13.715 --> 02:10:18.078]  And that's been well documented in the scientific literature.
[02:10:18.078 --> 02:10:22.901]  But in order to try to make your body react, they add what's called immune adjuvants to it.
[02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:30.532]  Now these are various chemicals that cause your body to have a very intense immune reaction.
[02:10:30.532 --> 02:10:38.574]  The only adjuvant approved in the United States is the aluminum compound, primarily alum.
[02:10:38.574 --> 02:10:48.596]  They put that in there to make your immune system react and to cause the immune system to interact with the agent itself.
[02:10:48.596 --> 02:10:50.557]  For instance, measles, mumps, Ebola, whatever.
[02:10:51.620 --> 02:10:54.742]  Uh, the problem that we have is many-fold.
[02:10:54.742 --> 02:11:09.289]  The aluminum not only produces an abnormal, intense immune reaction that's prolonged, but the aluminum itself diffuses out into the body, including the brain, and accumulates, and it stays there for a lifetime.
[02:11:09.289 --> 02:11:13.051]  So each time you get a vaccination, you're getting a dose of aluminum.
[02:11:13.942 --> 02:11:24.345]  Now, the proof of that was done by a study in which they put a radioactive tag on the aluminum that was in a vaccine that's given to people.
[02:11:24.345 --> 02:11:28.146]  And they injected it and traced it to see where it would go.
[02:11:28.146 --> 02:11:32.668]  And they found out it disseminated all over the body, but also the brain.
[02:11:32.668 --> 02:11:34.688]  Well, that was a single vaccine.
[02:11:34.688 --> 02:11:39.510]  Today, children are getting about 40 some odd vaccines before they start school.
[02:11:40.216 --> 02:11:45.760]  Well, that's at least 35, 36 vaccines with aluminum in it.
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:52.846]  So they're getting 36 times the amount of aluminum that was in that study, and all of that goes to the brain.
[02:11:52.846 --> 02:11:59.971]  Over a lifetime, they're talking about giving people as many as 200, 250 vaccines.
[02:11:59.971 --> 02:12:02.133]  Sir, is that why I'm just interrupting Dr. Blaylock?
[02:12:03.047 --> 02:12:14.216]  Is that why I see the studies where you get a doubling or a tripling, depending on what study I look at, on people above 60 that get three or more flu shots of Alzheimer's?
[02:12:14.216 --> 02:12:14.896]  Well, yeah.
[02:12:14.896 --> 02:12:25.064]  Yeah, because not only does, for instance, the flu vaccine, not only will it contain the aluminum, but also contain a full dose of mercury.
[02:12:25.064 --> 02:12:31.749]  And we know that mercury and aluminum interact in the brain and produce a rather intense destructive reaction.
[02:12:32.412 --> 02:12:37.395]  And that the aluminum and mercury stay in the brain for decades, if not a lifetime.
[02:12:37.395 --> 02:12:39.316]  Very difficult to remove.
[02:12:39.316 --> 02:12:45.620]  And that while it's in the brain, it changes into a much more toxic form of mercury.
[02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:47.821]  The ionic mercury.
[02:12:47.821 --> 02:12:50.323]  All of this has been proven in the neuroscience literature.
[02:12:50.323 --> 02:12:53.645]  The problem is the people giving the vaccine.
[02:12:53.645 --> 02:12:57.707]  That is, your family doctor, your internist, your pediatrician.
[02:12:58.342 --> 02:13:00.109]  They're not aware of any of this literature.
[02:13:00.109 --> 02:13:01.394]  They don't read these things.
[02:13:01.394 --> 02:13:03.020]  They just read a pamphlet that comes to them.
[02:13:04.498 --> 02:13:28.658]  Yeah, that's what's crazy is that I can be at a family event talking to somebody in my family who's a pediatrician, and I'll go, well, I read the studies put out by a major university where it increases Alzheimer's to take the vaccines, and I have this study that Gardasil's killing people, and I have this study that in all the rat species they give vaccines, they see massive increases in
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:31.520]  Right.
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:38.122]  Well, you know, the first thing you have to realize is that when physicians go to medical school, when I went to medical school, there was a
[02:13:58.277 --> 02:14:00.978]  Virtually no instructions on vaccines.
[02:14:00.978 --> 02:14:04.440]  You took a two-week immunology course.
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:08.002]  You know, they're pretty intense, but it was just two weeks long.
[02:14:08.002 --> 02:14:10.983]  And that was your exposure to immunology.
[02:14:10.983 --> 02:14:16.606]  You hardly had any time to learn about the intricacies of vaccines.
[02:14:16.606 --> 02:14:19.067]  I doubt that there's much more instruction today.
[02:14:19.067 --> 02:14:25.910]  You learn a lot about the mechanism of immune reaction, but you're not taught about vaccines specifically.
[02:14:26.351 --> 02:14:36.399]  So, physicians generally don't know a lot about it, and they're not going to the scientific literature researching these things, looking at these things.
[02:14:36.399 --> 02:14:43.164]  And the vast majority of physicians know absolutely nothing about neuroscience.
[02:14:43.164 --> 02:14:50.609]  And so, when you start talking about microglia being activated in the excitotoxin-15 immune reaction in the brain,
[02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:54.521]  They really don't know what you're talking about.
[02:14:54.521 --> 02:14:56.562]  You know, that's not their specialty.
[02:14:56.562 --> 02:15:05.726]  Well, sir, I'm not a doctor, but I know if I eat a big bag of Doritos with MSG in it, I get a headache an hour later.
[02:15:05.726 --> 02:15:12.028]  And before I ever heard this stuff was bad, by the time I was a teenager, I started avoiding MSG.
[02:15:12.028 --> 02:15:14.809]  I didn't even know what MSG was.
[02:15:14.809 --> 02:15:17.851]  I just knew, don't eat Chinese food, don't eat Doritos.
[02:15:19.366 --> 02:15:24.829]  Well, you and millions of others made that observation, while the physicians were denying it.
[02:15:24.829 --> 02:15:33.014]  And for decades, all the big journals, like the Journal of Medicine, were denying there was any such thing as the Chinese restaurant syndrome.
[02:15:33.014 --> 02:15:44.361]  Well, now it's proven beyond all doubt, and we know that these exposures produce certain destructions of brain connections and the exact mechanism of what it does.
[02:15:44.361 --> 02:15:48.404]  For decades, they denied that monosodium glutamate entered the brain.
[02:15:48.951 --> 02:16:00.493]  Well, now we have absolutely proof it does enter the brain and produces these changes, particularly in the young during the most intense brain formation.
[02:16:00.493 --> 02:16:18.677]  One of the effects of repeated intense vaccination is that it activates these cells in the brain that release glutamate in high concentrations, producing the same effect, but even worse because there's an interaction of the immune reaction in the brain with the excite of toxicity
[02:16:19.289 --> 02:16:26.114]  That's something that I coined the term immunocytotoxicity, which is now in the medical literature.
[02:16:26.114 --> 02:16:37.483]  And this is a major mechanism for most of your neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Lou Gehrig, Guillain-Barre, and all of these things that we're now hearing about.
[02:16:37.483 --> 02:16:45.369]  Well, the interesting thing is the number of immunologic autoimmune diseases has increased, virtually exploded,
[02:16:46.655 --> 02:16:51.719]  The immunologists are all in a quandary trying to figure out why.
[02:16:51.719 --> 02:17:03.267]  What has happened in the last 30 years that's triggered this incredible increase in every type of autoimmune disease, particularly those affecting the brain?
[02:17:03.267 --> 02:17:05.548]  Well, they've toyed with environmental factors.
[02:17:05.548 --> 02:17:11.332]  They said, well, there must be chemicals in the air, exposure to nanoparticles of diesel
[02:17:12.882 --> 02:17:15.844]  Everything, but the most obvious, which is vaccines.
[02:17:15.844 --> 02:17:21.449]  The number of vaccines in the last 30 years has increased just astronomically.
[02:17:21.449 --> 02:17:30.256]  Because they can't point the finger back at... I mean, you look at these medical journals and reports, half the ads are drug ads and vaccine ads.
[02:17:30.256 --> 02:17:36.541]  But as this is ravaging their own families... Well, I know you're a brain scientist, a brain surgeon, a neurologist, but
[02:17:37.302 --> 02:17:40.845]  Why is it linked to the diabetes in the literature?
[02:17:40.845 --> 02:17:54.396]  Why is it linked, I mean, conclusively from what I've seen in other medical doctors we've had on, to, you know, teenagers and young people getting really serious disorders of the joints and the arthritis.
[02:17:54.396 --> 02:17:56.037]  I mean, how is it doing that?
[02:17:56.037 --> 02:17:58.619]  Well, it's the same autoimmune type reaction.
[02:17:58.619 --> 02:18:02.923]  Rather than the brain, it's attacking the cartilage in the joints.
[02:18:02.923 --> 02:18:03.943]  And it's attacking the
[02:18:05.134 --> 02:18:13.239]  beta cells in the pancreas producing diabetes and an autoimmune reaction in the lungs producing asthma.
[02:18:13.239 --> 02:18:29.709]  So all of these different diseases we know that are linked to these abnormal immune reactions are being connected to this immunization program in the countries that have periodically outlawed certain vaccines.
[02:18:29.709 --> 02:18:32.451]  The incidence of type 1 diabetes
[02:18:33.275 --> 02:18:36.397]  Uh, asthma has fallen precipitously.
[02:18:36.397 --> 02:18:42.341]  Uh, so we have very good circumstantial evidence, uh, of the connection to the vaccine policy.
[02:18:42.341 --> 02:18:46.684]  The problem is, as you say, they're advertising in all the medical journals.
[02:18:46.684 --> 02:18:53.348]  They contribute huge amounts of money for medical education, in support of medical schools.
[02:18:53.348 --> 02:18:56.490]  Uh, they wine and dine residents and interns.
[02:18:56.490 --> 02:19:02.494]  I'm talking about pharmaceutical companies, uh, so there's so much financial influence
[02:19:02.907 --> 02:19:17.976]  and financial influence throughout the media because of their heavy advertising on all the media that you can't get this story out despite the fact you have overwhelming hard scientific evidence of this happening.
[02:19:17.976 --> 02:19:20.678]  It's just like vaccine contamination.
[02:19:20.678 --> 02:19:27.642]  That is so well demonstrated, yet we just can't get that story out except through programs like yours.
[02:19:28.866 --> 02:19:35.072]  Uh, which is telling the people, uh, from the scientists and the scientific studies, what we're seeing.
[02:19:35.072 --> 02:19:39.235]  Uh, virtually every vaccine is contaminated.
[02:19:39.235 --> 02:19:50.926]  And the scary thing is contaminated with agents that can produce cancer and neurological diseases, uh, as, as long as two or three decades after and even be transmitted to your offspring.
[02:19:51.745 --> 02:19:52.786]  Doctor, stay there.
[02:19:52.786 --> 02:19:55.067]  That's incredible information.
[02:19:55.067 --> 02:20:00.250]  Medical doctor, literally trailblaze many of the modern medical terms being used.

[02:22:01.141 --> 02:22:05.207]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:22:05.207 --> 02:22:11.095]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:22:11.095 --> 02:22:12.217]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:22:12.217 --> 02:22:16.262]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:22:16.903 --> 02:22:30.709]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:22:30.709 --> 02:22:36.312]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:22:36.312 --> 02:22:42.195]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:02.291]  It is a big idea.
[02:23:02.291 --> 02:23:05.113]  A new world order.
[02:23:05.113 --> 02:23:09.377]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:23:13.352 --> 02:23:18.797]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[02:23:18.797 --> 02:23:26.103]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:23:29.144 --> 02:23:30.125]  Most people have no idea.
[02:23:30.125 --> 02:23:31.265]  They're not after money.
[02:23:31.265 --> 02:23:32.967]  They have all the money they need.
[02:23:32.967 --> 02:23:33.607]  They're after power.
[02:23:33.607 --> 02:23:35.628]  That's what they're after these years.
[02:24:01.045 --> 02:24:11.050]  We're going to continue discussing what Dr. Blaylock is documenting here, what the vaccines, what the cytotoxins that are in our foods are doing.
[02:24:29.144 --> 02:24:33.229]  What's in our water, what the fluoride's doing, and then why he believes they're doing it.
[02:24:33.229 --> 02:24:35.892]  He has massive evidence about the eugenics.
[02:24:35.892 --> 02:24:38.955]  And I just really appreciate Dr. Blaylock spending time with us.
[02:24:38.955 --> 02:24:41.979]  The website is BlaylockReport.com.
[02:24:41.979 --> 02:24:43.761]  BlaylockReport.com.
[02:24:43.761 --> 02:24:47.605]  A bunch of invaluable papers and documents and articles and books.
[02:24:48.346 --> 02:24:49.988]  I mean, this guy's the real deal.
[02:25:04.821 --> 02:25:29.384]  This is a short segment, long one coming up, to get into the contamination of vaccines, not just what they're putting in there that you and others have proven is very bad and causing autoimmune responses and toxicity and other problems, but what happens in the manufacturing of it and that a lot of these vaccines are grown on fetal retinas and caterpillar eggs and all sorts of other weird stuff.
[02:25:30.540 --> 02:25:37.044]  Well yeah, you know, in order to grow a virus you have to have living tissue.
[02:25:37.044 --> 02:25:43.929]  The classic tissue was monkey, kidney tissue, rhesus monkey was the beginning.
[02:25:43.929 --> 02:25:48.451]  And then they used the African green monkey and now they use other type cells.
[02:25:48.451 --> 02:25:53.775]  But all of these cells, if they're living, they're contaminated with other organisms.
[02:25:53.775 --> 02:25:58.978]  And they have inserted in their DNA carcinogenic viruses.
[02:25:58.978 --> 02:26:00.099]  They have mycoplasma.
[02:26:00.754 --> 02:26:14.680]  And a number of studies in which they took just vials of vaccines used for humans found a contamination rate varying between 30% and 60% for well-recognized organisms.
[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:26.165]  You have to realize that these kidney cells are contaminated with thousands of viruses, many of which have never been identified.
[02:26:26.165 --> 02:26:29.567]  So unless you're looking for a specific virus, you're not going to find it.
[02:26:30.573 --> 02:26:33.834]  We know that some of these viruses take a long time to culture out.
[02:26:33.834 --> 02:26:38.056]  You have to culture them for months to get this virus out.
[02:26:38.056 --> 02:26:48.280]  And one of the more recently recognized things is the stealth virus, which does not, cannot be determined by the usual detection mechanism.
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:53.523]  It takes a very complicated process to make these viruses show themselves.
[02:26:53.523 --> 02:26:59.205]  But the stealth viruses are being connected very strongly with cancer, neurodegenerative diseases,
[02:27:00.491 --> 02:27:09.797]  And a number of diseases that can come on decades after being exposed to them through the vaccines.
[02:27:09.797 --> 02:27:17.282]  So the potential of serious disease associated with vaccines is just enormous.
[02:27:17.282 --> 02:27:22.666]  Now they have conferences on this all the time, but most of the conferences are closed door.
[02:27:22.666 --> 02:27:24.647]  They don't invite the media.
[02:27:24.647 --> 02:27:27.329]  They never release the results of this to the media.
[02:27:28.538 --> 02:27:35.019]  Sometimes you'll see it in the science magazines, for instance, like Science or Nature.
[02:27:35.019 --> 02:27:47.581]  And one conference I read about said that they admitted that most of the vaccines were contaminated with DNA fragments and RNA fragments from viruses of various sorts.
[02:27:47.581 --> 02:27:53.542]  And they asked the virologist, well, do you think this is a danger to humans that you're injecting this?
[02:27:53.542 --> 02:27:56.783]  And they said, well, we don't really know.
[02:27:56.783 --> 02:27:57.363]  We hope not.
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:06.348]  Uh, but, you know, the scientific studies of DNA fragments show that they're inserted in the human genome.
[02:28:06.348 --> 02:28:14.496]  And so you can have a cancer-causing gene inserted into your gene that's passed on to your children.
[02:28:15.377 --> 02:28:20.062]  In fact, you wrote about this, I remember interviewing you five, six years ago, you were talking about it.
[02:28:20.062 --> 02:28:31.133]  Two days ago, the BBC admitted that these big study shows suddenly were mutating faster, and that scientists don't know why, when the answer's right in front of them.
[02:28:31.133 --> 02:28:37.339]  And if you pass the autoimmune defenses of the mouth, the nose, and the guts, and shoot stuff right into everybody,
[02:28:37.839 --> 02:28:48.562]  I mean, any mother knows puncture wounds are dangerous, much less injecting stuff grown on dead fetuses or dead monkeys.
[02:28:48.562 --> 02:28:57.804]  Sure, and if you're injecting a mycoplasma, for instance, well that mycoplasma is going to grow throughout the body and it's an intracellular organism.
[02:28:57.804 --> 02:29:01.465]  Very, very difficult to cure a mycoplasma infection.
[02:29:01.465 --> 02:29:04.966]  And we know that mycoplasma is associated with cancer, a number of cancers.
[02:29:06.122 --> 02:29:14.485]  So to inject these contaminated viruses and microplasma into people is just terrifying to me.
[02:29:14.485 --> 02:29:21.868]  That's one of the most terrifying aspects of these vaccines, is that they know they're contaminated with multiple agents.
[02:29:29.449 --> 02:29:38.934]  Let's talk about that when we come back, Dr. Blaylock, and then also some of the other things in our food and water, and the great research you've done on that, and then other areas that you think are important to get into.
[02:29:38.934 --> 02:29:48.539]  I also want to ask you what it was like when you awakened to this in your practice as a neurologist and as a brain surgeon.
[02:29:48.539 --> 02:29:50.220]  We'll be right back with Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[02:29:51.755 --> 02:29:55.678]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.678 --> 02:30:00.882]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.882 --> 02:30:06.186]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:30:06.186 --> 02:30:10.710]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:30:10.710 --> 02:30:12.992]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:30:12.992 --> 02:30:14.613]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:30:14.613 --> 02:30:15.654]  There is a solution.
[02:30:15.874 --> 02:30:24.297]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:31:01.189 --> 02:31:06.132]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:31:31.209 --> 02:31:31.489]  I think?
[02:32:01.755 --> 02:32:06.038]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[02:32:06.038 --> 02:32:09.301]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:32:09.301 --> 02:32:17.107]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[02:32:17.347 --> 02:32:19.589]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[02:32:19.589 --> 02:32:21.970]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[02:32:21.970 --> 02:32:28.774]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[02:32:28.774 --> 02:32:34.978]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[02:32:34.978 --> 02:32:37.560]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:44.945]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market, and numerous other high-quality health supplements.

[02:32:53.088 --> 02:32:53.148]  1-888-213-4338.
[02:33:14.332 --> 02:33:17.693]  We're going back to Dr. Russell Blaylock in a moment.
[02:33:17.693 --> 02:33:20.233]  We are going to open the phones up.
[02:33:20.233 --> 02:33:23.154]  Coming up in the next segment into the next hour.
[02:33:23.154 --> 02:33:28.054]  He'll be with us till about 40 after or so next hour.
[02:33:28.054 --> 02:33:30.495]  Close to two hours.
[02:33:30.495 --> 02:33:37.356]  I want to get into this whole youth brigade and Obama wanting to make all the kids pledge allegiance to him basically.
[02:33:37.356 --> 02:33:39.756]  And that's what they said in their press release last week.
[02:33:39.756 --> 02:33:41.877]  Now they're trying to spin it.
[02:33:41.877 --> 02:33:42.077]  So...
[02:33:43.353 --> 02:33:45.460]  We're going to discuss that coming up.
[02:33:45.460 --> 02:33:50.475]  I did want to let you the listeners know about a few of the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[02:33:52.944 --> 02:33:54.725]  Well, look at that headline.
[02:33:54.725 --> 02:34:02.489]  I'm looking at Infowars.com across the room and it says, Governor tells citizens they must take the shot patriotic duty.
[02:34:02.489 --> 02:34:06.911]  I mean, this is just getting so Orwellian, but that's coming up in a moment.
[02:34:06.911 --> 02:34:10.953]  I did want to tell the listeners about a new sponsor we have.
[02:34:10.953 --> 02:34:13.534]  You can go check it out and see the claims that they're making.
[02:34:15.009 --> 02:34:16.210]  It's Silver Lungs.
[02:34:16.210 --> 02:34:26.916]  Silver Lungs Generator is a highly cost-effective colloidal silver generator and lung delivery system that produces pure and endless colloidal silver and delivers the solution.
[02:34:26.916 --> 02:34:29.737]  And you can go check out again what they're saying at SilverLungs.com.
[02:34:32.526 --> 02:34:33.647]  And very, very interesting.
[02:34:33.647 --> 02:34:53.545]  We've had a lot of medical doctors and people on saying that nothing's a cure-all, nothing's perfect, but that nano-silver is good for viruses and bacteria, and certainly a lot better than the reports we're seeing about people taking antibiotics ahead of the flu outbreak, thinking it's going to protect them all over the world, when antibiotics don't even protect you from a virus.
[02:34:55.430 --> 02:34:57.031]  I guess from a secondary infection.
[02:34:57.031 --> 02:34:57.411]  Who knows?
[02:34:57.411 --> 02:35:02.913]  The point is, go find out more at SilverLungs.com.
[02:35:02.913 --> 02:35:05.353]  Again, SilverLungs.com.
[02:35:05.353 --> 02:35:10.075]  It's like an aerosolizer evaporator with the colloidal silver.
[02:35:10.075 --> 02:35:14.716]  It has a great colloidal silver making kit that it comes with.
[02:35:14.716 --> 02:35:15.697]  One other sponsor.
[02:35:16.457 --> 02:35:21.659]  That I want to let the listeners know about is efoodsdirect.com.
[02:35:21.659 --> 02:35:26.100]  In these crazy uncertain times, you need to have some storable foods.
[02:35:26.100 --> 02:35:28.641]  These things last 15-20 years in climate control.
[02:35:28.641 --> 02:35:32.522]  Now at my house, they're in the garage because I don't have room, so it'll last 10 years guaranteed.
[02:35:32.522 --> 02:35:35.703]  It was recently packed, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[02:35:35.703 --> 02:35:36.784]  They make this stuff every month.
[02:35:37.850 --> 02:35:45.876]  Triple enameled cams, super high quality, great price, no MSG, efoodsdirect.com, the letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[02:35:45.876 --> 02:35:54.903]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread, or 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:35:54.903 --> 02:35:56.104]  Okay, going back to Dr. Blaylock.
[02:35:56.104 --> 02:35:58.125]  Dr. Blaylock, you got interrupted by the break.
[02:35:58.125 --> 02:36:05.711]  You were trying to bring up the fact that they know this is in the vaccines, the contamination, but they continue to just go along with it,
[02:36:06.890 --> 02:36:24.456]  And as we see all the different diseases and autoimmune problems and toxicity being generated by this, we then see a compounding with the Aspartame in thousands of products, the MSG under new names in almost everything I try to buy at the store.
[02:36:24.456 --> 02:36:26.417]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:36:26.417 --> 02:36:33.599]  I know instantly, when I have ingested MSG, I feel within a few minutes or nearly instantly,
[02:36:35.310 --> 02:36:40.511]  The fluoride they're putting in the water, can you break down some of the things that are in our environment?
[02:36:40.511 --> 02:36:45.713]  And then, from your research, why this is happening?
[02:36:45.713 --> 02:36:56.735]  Well, the fluoride, for instance, it's interesting that there's such compelling evidence that fluoride added to water does not reduce cavities at all.
[02:36:56.735 --> 02:37:00.056]  Even the American Dental Association has admitted that.
[02:37:00.934 --> 02:37:07.277]  So you have to ask yourself, well, if it doesn't reduce cavities, what's the purpose of it?
[02:37:07.277 --> 02:37:14.901]  Their flimsy excuse was, well, as the water flows over your teeth, it may topically strengthen your teeth.
[02:37:14.901 --> 02:37:21.403]  Well, of course, that's silly nonsense that a fourth grader would see through.
[02:37:21.403 --> 02:37:26.706]  So there's no justification, but we do know, and the national research
[02:37:27.936 --> 02:37:43.528]  Institute did a very comprehensive study confirming what all the opponents of fluoridation have shown, and that is that fluoride is a powerful accumulative poison, meaning that it accumulates in the body and can stay there for a lifetime.
[02:37:43.528 --> 02:37:48.312]  It destroys bones, increases fractures, osteoporosis.
[02:37:48.312 --> 02:37:55.918]  It accumulates in the brain, combines with the aluminum, produces a very neurotoxic fluoraluminum compound.
[02:37:56.425 --> 02:37:59.526]  All of this is known, sir.
[02:37:59.526 --> 02:38:06.929]  Your anachrondria is so well, it doesn't even attain its objective.
[02:38:06.929 --> 02:38:09.430]  That is, reducing cavities.
[02:38:09.430 --> 02:38:11.351]  Everybody admits that.
[02:38:11.351 --> 02:38:13.431]  And it has all of these toxic effects.
[02:38:13.431 --> 02:38:18.093]  It even increases the budding of flu virus.
[02:38:18.093 --> 02:38:22.275]  That is, the spread of flu virus in your body.
[02:38:22.275 --> 02:38:23.075]  What is the purpose?
[02:38:23.075 --> 02:38:24.536]  What are you putting it in the water for?
[02:38:25.598 --> 02:38:33.562]  The government sent its agents to little small townships that vote not to fluoridate their water.
[02:38:33.562 --> 02:38:39.305]  Why do they use the expense to send government agents from Washington D.C.
[02:38:39.305 --> 02:38:48.909]  to pressure these people to vote it back in and use government granting to entice them to put fluoride back in the water?
[02:38:48.909 --> 02:38:49.689]  What's the purpose?
[02:38:51.505 --> 02:38:57.688]  We don't have hard evidence, but we know fluoride has a definite behavioral effect on the brain.
[02:38:57.688 --> 02:39:01.310]  It can produce an apathy-like syndrome.
[02:39:01.310 --> 02:39:03.851]  It can affect the ability to think clearly.
[02:39:03.851 --> 02:39:18.038]  So, is it a financial deal they have with the manufacturers of aluminum and the manufacturers of fertilizers to get rid of this waste product?
[02:39:18.038 --> 02:39:19.158]  What exactly is it?
[02:39:20.985 --> 02:39:23.447]  Use your imagination, but we know one thing.
[02:39:23.447 --> 02:39:28.070]  It has absolutely nothing to do with dental health.
[02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:36.677]  The MSG in the food, the research now is so compelling that it affected the formation and development of the brain.
[02:39:36.677 --> 02:39:46.404]  That it significantly can accelerate a number of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, migraine headaches,
[02:39:47.983 --> 02:39:53.667]  A number of things, particularly behavioral changes in children, anger, violence.
[02:39:53.667 --> 02:40:00.671]  It's strongly connected to depression, particularly pathologic severe depression.
[02:40:00.671 --> 02:40:14.880]  So now that we know all these things and our neuroscience are connected to glutamate, why is the food filled with a glutamate additive that we know can trigger these conditions, including suicide?
[02:40:17.037 --> 02:40:21.621]  And that there's an interaction between fluoride and glutamate.
[02:40:21.621 --> 02:40:27.305]  There's an interaction between fluoride, aluminum, glutamate, and vaccination.
[02:40:27.305 --> 02:40:37.372]  That we know if you vaccinate an animal and expose them, for instance, to mercury-aluminum, it dramatically increases the toxicity of those two elements.
[02:40:37.372 --> 02:40:43.557]  So with all this abundant, hard neuroscience showing these interactive toxicities,
[02:40:44.562 --> 02:41:00.733]  Why are the so-called protectors of the public, the EPA and the FDA, not getting these agents out of our food and halting this destructive and idiotic fluoridation water campaign?
[02:41:00.733 --> 02:41:07.437]  While they're even talking about making it a federal law that every water system in America must be fluoridated.
[02:41:08.018 --> 02:41:08.598]  Exactly.
[02:41:08.598 --> 02:41:18.280]  Now that the American people and the people of the world are fighting back and having it removed and they admit it doubles the chances of males, adolescent males, to get bone cancer.
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:19.380]  They just admit that.
[02:41:19.380 --> 02:41:30.643]  I've had the scientist that leads the EPA union on and 90 plus percent of their scientists signed a letter saying please take it out because
[02:41:31.776 --> 02:41:35.042]  We've gotten a tour of the Austin water supply and the people working there agreed with us.
[02:41:35.042 --> 02:41:37.987]  They said, yeah, we're told by the city to do this.
[02:41:37.987 --> 02:41:40.190]  We pay millions a year for it.
[02:41:40.190 --> 02:41:44.457]  And all it is is the toxic waste left over from fertilizer.
[02:41:45.768 --> 02:41:47.449]  Manufacturing.
[02:41:47.449 --> 02:41:56.495]  They mine the limestone and then remove the chemicals they want and then leave the toxic waste and it's over a hundred chemicals they put in our water under the name fluoride.
[02:41:56.495 --> 02:42:11.985]  That's just a... It's so insane though that the average person says there must be a reason for it even though the American Dental Association now says kids shouldn't brush their teeth with fluoride toothpaste because it gives them dental fluorosis and makes the teeth
[02:42:12.245 --> 02:42:17.327]  Well, we know that fluoride has a powerful effect on the reproductive system of both males and females and produces
[02:42:36.108 --> 02:42:38.970]  Uh, infertility and reduced fertility.
[02:42:38.970 --> 02:42:44.553]  We know mercury does the same thing, so you're injecting children with high doses of mercury.
[02:42:44.553 --> 02:42:51.657]  Uh, we know that that also, uh, has a, uh, damaging effect on the reproductive organs.
[02:42:51.657 --> 02:43:00.361]  Uh, we know that, uh, a number of these agents that we're being exposed to affect fertility.
[02:43:00.361 --> 02:43:05.284]  Now, either you have to conclude, well, the government is just made up of a bunch of buffoons
[02:43:05.987 --> 02:43:18.658]  Who choose to ignore the synergistic interaction of all these things that they're ordering into our food and water, and its effect on reproduction and fertility, or they're doing it on purpose.
[02:43:18.658 --> 02:43:34.451]  Now, if you talk to young people, and I've talked to my sons about this, I've said, I've noticed that there's just an explosion of fertility claims growing all over the country because young people are having such difficulty with their wives getting pregnant.
[02:43:35.405 --> 02:43:41.530]  And he said, yeah, a number of his friends have had that problem.
[02:43:41.530 --> 02:43:53.821]  Because, you know, you've either got to conclude, well, something else is in the air and the water and the food that's producing infertility for this sudden change in fertility of very young people.
[02:43:53.821 --> 02:43:59.185]  Or possibly, someone's doing this on purpose with this combination of fluoride, mercury,
[02:44:00.798 --> 02:44:01.659]  I don't know.
[02:44:19.762 --> 02:44:39.227]  Ecoscience, the textbook written by the White House Science Czar, John P. Holdren, about how they would implant us with devices to sterilize us, put drugs in the water to lower our libido and sterilize us, set up a planetary government to do this, eradicate the family using the educational system as the wedge to start that.
[02:44:40.316 --> 02:44:50.707]  And then since then all these other books he wrote and government textbooks have come out describing exactly what they're now doing and I have him in congressional hearings where
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:58.263]  Jay Rockefeller says, oh, you walk on water, oh, you're the master planner, oh, you're the great builder.
[02:44:58.263 --> 02:45:01.384]  It appears that they have adopted his plan.
[02:45:01.384 --> 02:45:12.469]  Now, we know there were previous ones that were similar, but it's like they treat him like a rock star when he's on Letterman, when he's before committees, and it appears that his plan from 1977, in this case, was adopted.
[02:45:17.028 --> 02:45:35.776]  Well, yeah, and as I told you on that previous program where we were talking about the Rockefeller Foundation and Carnegie Foundation and Ford, they were spending virtually millions, hundreds of millions of dollars on population control, eugenics, and sterilization.
[02:45:35.776 --> 02:45:42.859]  And if you read their literature, I'm talking about some of the most powerful, influential people in society in the 1910-1920 era,
[02:45:46.262 --> 02:45:56.770]  It was very open, this call for controlling a population and reducing the level of the unfit and people without social utility.
[02:45:56.770 --> 02:45:58.231]  They were quite open about it.
[02:45:58.231 --> 02:46:04.876]  Well, they're not quite as open about it, but they're still writing about these things in the literature.
[02:46:04.876 --> 02:46:11.641]  And these are people that are very influential, writing in prestigious journals and magazines.
[02:46:12.230 --> 02:46:38.280]  If you look at the group of papers collected by the Hastings Center, which Ezekiel Emanuel, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, the health czar for Obama, his papers are calling for this very thing, that we need to let the elderly die and stop giving them health care because they're an expense to the society and they have no right to live.
[02:46:39.935 --> 02:46:49.603]  A very similar thing that we heard in the 1910s and 20s being funded on a massive scale by the Rockefeller and Carnegie and Ford foundations.
[02:46:49.603 --> 02:46:58.950]  And at the same time in Germany, I'm talking about in 1910, long before Hitler came along, their society was just flooded with the same literature and so was Austria.
[02:47:00.216 --> 02:47:04.438]  Talking about the need to control the unfit.
[02:47:04.438 --> 02:47:05.919]  And we know who funded that.
[02:47:05.919 --> 02:47:09.001]  The Rockefellers again with the Kaiser-Vellheim Institute.
[02:47:09.001 --> 02:47:11.302]  Almost single-handedly bankrolled it.
[02:47:11.302 --> 02:47:13.903]  Along with Thomas Watson of IBM.
[02:47:13.903 --> 02:47:16.444]  And much of their literature came from the United States.
[02:47:16.444 --> 02:47:22.147]  They were quoting the literature that was produced by the Rockefellers and the Carnegies.
[02:47:22.147 --> 02:47:26.029]  So Hitler grew up in a society that openly was disgusting.
[02:47:26.556 --> 02:47:33.622]  The need to eliminate the unfit and the people that were disabled.
[02:47:33.622 --> 02:47:37.345]  That's right, Hitler thought the US and England were going to join him.
[02:47:37.345 --> 02:47:55.380]  And that's why the King of England, Edward VIII at the time was a Nazi and Hitler was on Time Magazine and man he's doing a great job sterilizing and killing the retarded kids and my god we need to have more of this here and we can drug the water and then they went underground and now they're doing it to us and the general public better wake up.
[02:47:56.328 --> 02:48:05.072]  Well, the problem with the average person is they're not reading what these people are writing, because they're openly writing about a lot of this now.
[02:48:05.072 --> 02:48:08.574]  The need to regulate and control society.
[02:48:08.574 --> 02:48:21.160]  If you read this health care bill, and I've read all 1,017 pages, and analyzed various sections of it in detail, it is designed to eliminate the unwanted people.
[02:48:22.375 --> 02:48:30.961]  And it conforms exactly to this Rockefeller idea that certain people are not fit to live in society and they have no right to be here.
[02:48:30.961 --> 02:48:36.724]  And that government should decide who has the right to live in the United States and who doesn't.
[02:48:36.724 --> 02:48:46.870]  I wrote a paper recently called, uh, Social Utility, uh, uh, who should, uh, should we let mom, uh, grandmother, and grandpa live?
[02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:49.752]  Well, that, uh, I go through all of... Well, that's the thing.
[02:48:49.752 --> 02:48:51.073]  I mean, I want you to comment on that, but...
[02:48:52.068 --> 02:48:56.551]  Dashiell wrote a book saying if you're 60 you don't get eye surgery, you don't get brain surgery.
[02:48:56.551 --> 02:48:59.454]  And that's what they do in the socialized healthcare system.
[02:48:59.454 --> 02:49:12.723]  But that's the thing is they write it, Emanuel's brother says it, the bill says we're going to do what this board recommends, and then you read what the board recommends and it's what you just said, and then they lie and say we're not doing this.
[02:49:13.484 --> 02:49:26.206]  Just like they have bills introduced for compulsory service and Obama wants it, and he's going to have the kids form up in front of him next week, literally with telescreens like 1984, and now he's saying, well, what's wrong with that?
[02:49:26.206 --> 02:49:35.708]  I mean, Dr. Blaylock, do you ever pinch yourself, even though you study this and expose it, that it's really happening, that these people really are in control?
[02:49:35.708 --> 02:49:39.949]  Well, it's happening so rapidly, you know, as I tell people, you go back 40 years,
[02:49:40.993 --> 02:49:45.536]  You had a hard time getting a politician admitting he's a liberal.
[02:49:45.536 --> 02:49:50.459]  Well, now they proudly not only say they're liberals, but that they're far left.
[02:49:50.459 --> 02:49:53.981]  You know, most of the time on TV they say we're from the left.
[02:49:53.981 --> 02:49:59.885]  Well, 40 years ago, 30 years ago, you would never hear a politician say he's from the left.
[02:49:59.885 --> 02:50:03.507]  Because that's admitting I'm a socialist or a communist.
[02:50:03.507 --> 02:50:05.809]  That I'm a collectivist.
[02:50:05.809 --> 02:50:10.472]  But they're proud of it now, and what happened when we got the Obama administration.
[02:50:11.767 --> 02:50:25.372]  Well look at Van Jones saying, hey the green jobs is to take the economy over for total redistribution of wealth.
[02:50:25.372 --> 02:50:28.073]  I mean these people mean business.
[02:50:30.393 --> 02:50:36.420]  And it's the idea that there's a group of wise people who tell the rest of society what their duty is.
[02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:42.708]  And this health corps, this corps of young people being drafted, is exactly that.
[02:50:42.708 --> 02:50:46.453]  You have a duty to do what your government tells you to do, and help us.
[02:50:47.935 --> 02:50:50.296]  You know, recruit other people into the government corps.
[02:50:50.296 --> 02:50:51.377]  Amazing.
[02:50:51.377 --> 02:50:51.877]  Amazing.
[02:50:51.877 --> 02:50:53.078]  Dr. Blaylock, stay there.
[02:50:53.078 --> 02:50:57.420]  When we come back, I want to get it more into the Eugenics Master Plan and then take phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:51:01.516 --> 02:51:07.498]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[02:51:07.498 --> 02:51:08.238]  Think about that.
[02:51:08.238 --> 02:51:11.359]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[02:51:11.359 --> 02:51:14.581]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[02:51:14.581 --> 02:51:24.364]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Choose for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables and antioxidants.
[02:51:24.824 --> 02:51:30.650]  Unlike hard-to-digest pills, Choose for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for better digestion.
[02:51:30.650 --> 02:51:31.831]  The choice is yours.
[02:51:31.831 --> 02:51:37.437]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[02:51:37.437 --> 02:51:42.522]  Choose for Health, the world's first superfruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant chewable.
[02:51:42.522 --> 02:51:44.985]  Whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.
[02:51:45.746 --> 02:51:49.089]  1-800-210-1922.

[02:52:04.412 --> 02:52:10.234]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:52:10.234 --> 02:52:17.877]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:52:18.564 --> 02:52:26.007]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:52:26.007 --> 02:52:37.752]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:37.752 --> 02:52:41.714]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:41.714 --> 02:52:43.975]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:43.975 --> 02:52:47.757]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:53:01.693 --> 02:53:07.198]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:53:07.198 --> 02:53:07.999]  and the world.
[02:53:07.999 --> 02:53:11.862]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:53:11.862 --> 02:53:18.348]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:53:18.348 --> 02:53:20.389]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:53:20.389 --> 02:53:25.614]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[02:53:25.814 --> 02:53:26.094]  I think so.
[02:53:43.757 --> 02:53:44.157]  I think so.
[02:54:11.280 --> 02:54:17.543]  All right, Dr. Blaylock will be with us 40 minutes to the next hour, then I'm getting into Van Jones, how they're trying to tie him into 9-11 Truth.
[02:54:17.543 --> 02:54:18.484]  Your call's coming up.
[02:54:18.484 --> 02:54:27.729]  We start the next hour in a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231, specifically on vaccines, excitotoxins, eugenics.
[02:54:27.729 --> 02:54:31.851]  That's a big area, but specifically for Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[02:54:31.851 --> 02:54:34.973]  Doctor, you said you just did a two-hour rundown
[02:54:36.357 --> 02:54:37.257]  We're good to go.
[02:55:02.351 --> 02:55:09.273]  Uh, if you look through the bill, you know, one of the first things to assure everybody, you'll be able to keep your insurance if you like it.
[02:55:09.273 --> 02:55:10.794]  That is an absolute lie.
[02:55:10.794 --> 02:55:20.917]  What you're going to be faced with, and your employer's going to be faced with, is that if you keep your private insurance, there are penalties you're going to have to pay.
[02:55:20.917 --> 02:55:30.460]  And of course, for the people covering your insurance, it's going to behoove them, in terms of finances, to move you forcibly into the public option.
[02:55:31.421 --> 02:55:36.886]  So you will lose the high quality coverage that you have at your business.
[02:55:36.886 --> 02:55:55.221]  Now for individual insured people, they tack on so many requirements, mandates, audits, financial things that have to be met by the insurance company and the insured person that you will no longer be able to pay your premiums.
[02:55:55.794 --> 02:56:04.696]  So this is a whole new bureaucracy where they fine you if you don't have insurance, and then like a new agency like the IRS come in and manage your life.
[02:56:04.696 --> 02:56:18.620]  Well not only that, you pay a 2.5% excise tax for not having insurance, and on top of that if you have higher income, say you make $250,000, $300,000 total worth, that's not your income but total worth,
[02:56:19.661 --> 02:56:34.986]  Then they tack on another percentage and it could go up to as much as 8.59% tax that you're going to pay above your other taxes because you didn't take the public option or you just choose to get a health savings account.
[02:56:34.986 --> 02:56:37.246]  You're going to be punished severely for that.
[02:56:37.246 --> 02:56:46.029]  So you will be forcibly moved into the public option unless you're just enormously rich and resistant.
[02:56:46.843 --> 02:56:51.125]  The really scary thing of this bill is that you read through it almost everywhere.
[02:56:51.125 --> 02:56:58.067]  It says things are left up to the discretion of the Secretary of HHS, Health and Human Services.
[02:56:58.067 --> 02:57:02.469]  So as you're reading the bill, you find that it's not actually spelled out.
[02:57:02.469 --> 02:57:13.612]  It says this will be determined 18 months later or this will be determined a year later by the Secretary of HHS coding criteria who will be included.
[02:57:13.612 --> 02:57:15.113]  All this will be determined later.
[02:57:15.865 --> 02:57:23.551]  Uh, so you're signing a bill, uh, in which there's, uh, very few specifics added in many of these sections.
[02:57:23.551 --> 02:57:28.414]  Well, that's what's happening with the cybersecurity, where they admit it so they can take the web over.
[02:57:28.414 --> 02:57:29.635]  That's what the gun bills do.
[02:57:29.635 --> 02:57:35.700]  They have a bill that says the Attorney General can ban any and all guns whenever he feels like it.
[02:57:35.700 --> 02:57:38.422]  They're openly setting up a dictatorship.
[02:57:38.422 --> 02:57:39.262]  Oh, yeah.
[02:57:39.262 --> 02:57:42.665]  I mean, as you read through this bill, you become more and more frightened.
[02:57:43.174 --> 02:58:10.582]  Because, for instance, it says all physicians are in the public option, whether they want to be or not, that they have to specifically apply to remove themselves from the public option, that is, being a federal doctor, and that the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary will decide the mechanism by which you're allowed to leave, which he could make it so difficult and so financially punishing.
[02:58:11.218 --> 02:58:14.819]  Uh, most doctors won't leave because they're going to need doctors.
[02:58:14.819 --> 02:58:16.400]  And they're not going to want them to live.
[02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:23.422]  It says that she has, uh, control over all payments to physicians, hospitals, nursing homes.
[02:58:23.422 --> 02:58:25.363]  Uh, it's at her discretion.
[02:58:26.389 --> 02:58:28.511]  Uh, as to what they'll be paid.
[02:58:28.511 --> 02:58:33.676]  And the incredible thing is most scary is I've read these sections you're talking about.
[02:58:33.676 --> 02:58:36.539]  When you bring them up, they just say you're a liar.
[02:58:36.539 --> 02:58:37.960]  It doesn't exist.
[02:58:37.960 --> 02:58:40.323]  Final hour, 70 seconds away.
[02:58:40.323 --> 02:58:42.885]  Stay with us.
[02:58:42.885 --> 02:58:44.327]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.327 --> 02:58:47.550]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.684 --> 02:58:54.686]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.686 --> 02:59:00.031]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:59:00.031 --> 02:59:02.072]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:02.072 --> 02:59:07.076]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:07.076 --> 02:59:07.997]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.257 --> 02:59:09.378]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.378 --> 02:59:11.259]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.259 --> 02:59:12.340]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.340 --> 02:59:14.542]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.542 --> 02:59:15.883]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:15.883 --> 02:59:17.404]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.404 --> 02:59:22.668]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.668 --> 02:59:26.271]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.271 --> 02:59:29.734]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:30.074 --> 02:59:31.295]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.295 --> 02:59:32.195]  We don't know.
[02:59:32.195 --> 02:59:33.316]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.316 --> 02:59:34.237]  All you can get.
[02:59:34.237 --> 02:59:35.337]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.337 --> 02:59:38.379]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.379 --> 02:59:38.899]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.899 --> 02:59:40.620]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.620 --> 02:59:41.601]  Again that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:41.601 --> 02:59:42.762]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.762 --> 02:59:44.623]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.690 --> 03:00:14.132]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is our guest for another 40 minutes.
[03:00:14.132 --> 03:00:22.779]  I'm going to get into Obama's big push to have the youth line up and become his friend and help him.
[03:00:22.779 --> 03:00:28.203]  You got Al Gore telling school kids all over the country on tape, don't do what your parents say.
[03:00:28.203 --> 03:00:29.845]  Global warming's real.
[03:00:29.845 --> 03:00:31.906]  Work with the government.
[03:00:31.906 --> 03:00:34.929]  Van Jones saying we are going to overthrow America.
[03:00:36.098 --> 03:00:40.621]  It's interesting, the other day I was watching TV and I had one of the leftist politicians saying
[03:01:04.190 --> 03:01:07.252]  Oh, there's absolutely no rationing in this bill.
[03:01:07.252 --> 03:01:10.174]  Virtually every page is rationing.
[03:01:10.174 --> 03:01:21.042]  And the penalties on physicians for just minor misinterpretation of rules or regulations, there's enormous civil penalties.
[03:01:21.042 --> 03:01:26.066]  And what we know in national health systems is with time they get further and further in debt.
[03:01:26.678 --> 03:01:35.804]  And in order to make up that loss, they start increasing the number of penalties and cutting physician pay.
[03:01:35.804 --> 03:01:46.071]  Well, after a while, a physician's pay is going to be so low that he's no longer going to be able to maintain his office, which means they're going to have to sell it to the federal government.
[03:01:46.071 --> 03:01:49.394]  The federal government will take over all physician's offices.
[03:01:49.394 --> 03:01:55.378]  Well, this happened where I used to practice in North Carolina, just under the Medicare and Medicaid and managed care.
[03:01:57.997 --> 03:02:00.138]  I warned the physicians it was coming.
[03:02:00.138 --> 03:02:02.138]  They chose not to list it.
[03:02:02.138 --> 03:02:04.219]  I left and moved to Mississippi.
[03:02:04.219 --> 03:02:12.282]  All of their offices were purchased by the regulatory agency and it ruined all of their practices.
[03:02:12.282 --> 03:02:15.003]  Well, this is going to be much, much work.
[03:02:15.003 --> 03:02:17.704]  We're going to federalize virtually every segment.
[03:02:18.334 --> 03:02:20.456]  That has anything to do with health care.
[03:02:20.456 --> 03:02:20.996]  Absolutely.
[03:02:44.762 --> 03:02:45.382]  Listen to this.
[03:02:45.382 --> 03:02:46.883]  This is a rating of physicians.
[03:02:46.883 --> 03:02:55.349]  One of the things they want to sell this bill is we're going to give you high quality health care and we have built into it quality measures.
[03:02:55.349 --> 03:03:12.821]  Well, on page 258, line 13 through 17, on evaluating physicians for quality medical care performance, it says the performance will be based on satisfactory submitting data
[03:03:13.777 --> 03:03:14.237]  I don't know.
[03:03:36.215 --> 03:03:47.023]  I mean, look at government offices falling apart, total lazy bureaucrats everywhere.
[03:03:47.023 --> 03:03:55.089]  Now they want to take health care over and they're going to be raiding people and going after people with political weapons.
[03:03:55.089 --> 03:03:55.829]  I mean, this is...
[03:03:56.926 --> 03:04:04.708]  This is just an amazing tyranny, and every time I see another piece of it, each piece by itself is enough for a revolution.
[03:04:04.708 --> 03:04:17.312]  But you put it all together, it's just, it's, the thing they have going for them is it's so bold that the government's gonna take over and tell you who's good and who isn't?
[03:04:17.312 --> 03:04:18.632]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:04:18.632 --> 03:04:23.914]  And then they, I go back to it, Dr. Blaylock, they then lie about it and say they're not doing this.
[03:04:24.790 --> 03:04:33.068]  Well, you know, one of the big things that really got people fired up was the idea of the advanced care planning, is the euphemistic term.
[03:04:33.866 --> 03:04:50.374]  Uh, which was the death panel, uh, where we have consultation with the elderly and the chronically ill and disabled to convince them that it'd probably be better if they just moved on into another, uh, uh, life and give up their life for the good of the state.
[03:04:50.374 --> 03:04:54.056]  Well, if you read this, it's exactly... Well, stay there, we gotta break.
[03:04:54.056 --> 03:04:56.337]  Come back with the death panels, break it down, and we're going to the calls.
[03:04:56.337 --> 03:04:57.738]  Dr. Russell Blaylock, stay with us.
[03:05:01.127 --> 03:05:06.434]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:05:06.434 --> 03:05:10.960]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:05:10.960 --> 03:05:13.243]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:05:13.243 --> 03:05:14.865]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:05:14.865 --> 03:05:15.887]  There is a solution.
[03:05:16.127 --> 03:05:24.551]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:06:01.704 --> 03:06:08.456]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:06:08.456 --> 03:06:10.119]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:06:11.092 --> 03:06:12.633]  But who is the enemy?
[03:06:12.633 --> 03:06:13.434]  Bin Laden.
[03:06:13.434 --> 03:06:14.454]  This is his M.O.
[03:06:14.454 --> 03:06:15.775]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:06:15.775 --> 03:06:17.797]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:06:17.797 --> 03:06:24.942]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:06:24.942 --> 03:06:25.422]  Some U.S.
[03:06:25.422 --> 03:06:31.787]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:06:31.787 --> 03:06:35.289]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:35.289 --> 03:06:37.411]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA.
[03:06:37.411 --> 03:06:38.912]  The hijacker's ties to the FBI.
[03:06:39.312 --> 03:06:41.333]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists!
[03:07:03.735 --> 03:07:06.817]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[03:07:06.817 --> 03:07:09.439]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[03:07:09.439 --> 03:07:13.222]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutraversal Foods.
[03:07:13.222 --> 03:07:19.906]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[03:07:19.906 --> 03:07:23.789]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[03:07:23.789 --> 03:07:26.871]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a
[03:07:29.872 --> 03:07:31.754]  That's right, your new comfort food.
[03:07:31.754 --> 03:07:34.859]  Incredible taste, easy to prepare and a long shelf life.
[03:07:34.859 --> 03:07:42.829]  New traversal foods, more fun while hunting and fishing, bigger tails around the campfire, and the food your kids will want when celebrating the win of a ball game.
[03:07:42.829 --> 03:07:47.295]  And if it's this great during the good times, imagine how reassuring it will be if times get tough.
[03:07:53.143 --> 03:07:56.906]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:07:56.906 --> 03:07:58.567]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.758 --> 03:08:17.719]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:08:17.719 --> 03:08:23.421]  Tony, Mike, Andrew, Jeremy, Pat, your calls are coming up momentarily.
[03:08:23.421 --> 03:08:29.984]  Again, Dr. Blaylock, we could have you back up in the next few weeks for another full show just on the health care plan.
[03:08:29.984 --> 03:08:31.165]  But I go back to this.
[03:08:31.165 --> 03:08:33.086]  I've read the same subsections you're reading.
[03:08:34.127 --> 03:08:37.550]  My dad's a physician, so growing up I know enough about how healthcare works.
[03:08:37.550 --> 03:08:48.020]  He's also been a medical care consultant to both hospitals and dental offices, so I can specifically read this and understand a lot of it, but I've seen what the experts have said as well, and I've read it.
[03:08:48.020 --> 03:08:49.341]  It's very clear.
[03:08:49.341 --> 03:08:55.647]  This is a total takeover of 20% of our economy, and the lying about it, but you were getting into the death panels.
[03:08:56.428 --> 03:08:57.729]  I mean, it's Dashiell.
[03:08:57.729 --> 03:08:59.229]  It's Rahm Emanuel's brother.
[03:08:59.229 --> 03:09:01.030]  It's the publications.
[03:09:01.030 --> 03:09:06.013]  At first, a few months ago, when they thought they had it, they were saying, yeah, you don't need these unnecessary tests and...
[03:09:07.037 --> 03:09:20.963]  I've watched House of Commons, back when Tony Blair was in, admitting people were waiting 16, 18 months for brain surgeries that were 95% successful if you got it within two months, but if you didn't, you were dead.
[03:09:20.963 --> 03:09:23.003]  And they admitted this!
[03:09:23.003 --> 03:09:27.005]  I mean, I've got two people that work for me in England, the Watson brothers.
[03:09:27.005 --> 03:09:28.646]  Their healthcare system's a nightmare!
[03:09:29.326 --> 03:09:35.630]  And they now are saying, if you've had a bad life, or you've smoked, or you've done this, we're not going to give you the health care.
[03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:41.674]  So, I keep going back to the lying when they attack Sarah Palin, who by the way, I don't like Sarah Palin.
[03:09:41.674 --> 03:09:43.215]  She was a fool to quit the governorship.
[03:09:43.215 --> 03:09:45.956]  You know, they put her in there as a ringer.
[03:09:45.956 --> 03:09:47.737]  But my point is, she's right.
[03:09:47.737 --> 03:09:51.520]  But instead they just say, oh, she's a liar, she's a dumb woman, she's an idiot.
[03:09:51.520 --> 03:09:52.981]  There's no death panels.
[03:09:52.981 --> 03:09:57.643]  When these bioethicist boards, I mean, these are death panels.
[03:09:57.643 --> 03:09:58.284]  Dr. Blaylock.
[03:09:59.093 --> 03:10:07.619]  Well, you see, they're clever not using the term death panels or end-of-life death panels or anything like that.
[03:10:07.619 --> 03:10:09.601]  What they do is they leave it open-ended.
[03:10:09.601 --> 03:10:14.845]  For instance, they talk about end-of-life services and support, palliative and hospice.
[03:10:14.845 --> 03:10:27.434]  Well, if you know about hospice, what they did to them is you're allowed to, or you're supposed to, transfer a patient to hospice if you think they'll die in six months, but physicians don't always know
[03:10:28.041 --> 03:10:29.041]  When someone would die.
[03:10:29.041 --> 03:10:31.943]  Some live a year or two years.
[03:10:31.943 --> 03:10:37.165]  Well, you have to take care of them and comfort them and give them their medication.
[03:10:37.165 --> 03:10:47.369]  Well, the government came in and said anybody living over six months will cut off all Medicare payments, too, so you're going to be stuck with the cost.
[03:10:47.369 --> 03:10:56.533]  Well, the hospice program said, well, we can't assume this cost, so they started injecting the patient with morphine so they would die within six months.
[03:10:57.695 --> 03:11:06.480]  And so the government policy pushed the high-speed system to start ending patients' lives sooner than they would normally.
[03:11:06.480 --> 03:11:08.661]  And now they're killing people in Europe.
[03:11:08.661 --> 03:11:11.543]  Even Newsweek admits this, but says it's beautiful and wonderful.
[03:11:11.543 --> 03:11:13.384]  I showed the article a few weeks ago.
[03:11:13.384 --> 03:11:16.865]  They're now killing people who are depressed, and the government will pay for that.
[03:11:16.865 --> 03:11:23.229]  But I know I interrupted you before you finished your full story along those whole lines, so go ahead.
[03:11:23.786 --> 03:11:31.148]  Well, in the bill itself, it talks about, you know, they say, well, it's not mandatory you have this counseling every five years.
[03:11:31.148 --> 03:11:34.169]  Well, that's a lie.
[03:11:34.169 --> 03:11:51.114]  Page 424 says that this is a part of routine medical care, and the individuals will have the consultations every five years, and that if they develop a change in their medical condition, that is an injury or anything that could potentially be life-threatening,
[03:11:51.913 --> 03:11:55.677]  Exactly, so this is total political indoctrination and
[03:12:15.762 --> 03:12:17.803]  Well yeah, and of course this is what happened in England.
[03:12:17.803 --> 03:12:23.406]  In England, for instance, one of the government studies on the quality of the National Health Service found that in one city.
[03:12:42.149 --> 03:12:48.034]  400 to 1,200 people died from what they described as appalling health care.
[03:12:48.034 --> 03:12:49.095]  That's just one city.
[03:12:49.095 --> 03:12:53.138]  400 to 1,200 in a year.
[03:12:53.138 --> 03:13:02.166]  Now you multiply that times the 60 million people in England, you're talking about 10,000, 20,000 more people dying every year from appalling care.
[03:13:02.166 --> 03:13:06.930]  There's even stories of patients starving to death in hospital wards.
[03:13:06.930 --> 03:13:09.052]  And I had a friend of mine who lives in Louisiana,
[03:13:09.728 --> 03:13:17.273]  And he told me the story of one of his close friends whose daughter was a medical student.
[03:13:17.273 --> 03:13:21.956]  She went to England to work in the National Health Care Service to see what it was like.
[03:13:21.956 --> 03:13:30.102]  She developed pneumonia, was admitted to a hospital, and for six days she never saw a physician and never received any medication.
[03:13:30.666 --> 03:13:34.309]  She was progressively getting worse and was afraid she was going to die.
[03:13:34.309 --> 03:13:35.710]  She called home to her mother.
[03:13:35.710 --> 03:13:42.376]  Her mother flew to England, picked her up, flew her back home to Louisiana and had an ambulance carry her to the hospital.
[03:13:42.376 --> 03:13:45.498]  Now that's how they treat the medical student.
[03:13:45.498 --> 03:13:48.220]  For six days she wasn't even seen by a physician.
[03:13:48.220 --> 03:13:48.961]  She could have died.
[03:13:49.608 --> 03:14:05.740]  Well, I mean, I watch the House of Commons, and for all you dumb, stupid, ignorant, gullible people out there who are watching this or listening who believe all these lies about how you're going to get free health care, the moon is not made of cheese and you're not getting free health care, and the government
[03:14:06.300 --> 03:14:20.306]  is working for big banks that want a new tax to pay off these tens of trillions they've stolen and they're just going to grab the health care, tax you, keep the money, and then give you an aspirin for a heart attack like they do in these other socialist countries.
[03:14:20.306 --> 03:14:22.106]  So you better figure that out.
[03:14:22.106 --> 03:14:28.349]  I want to go to calls, Dr. Blaylock, but have you, after we take some, hit some more of what's going on in the health care plan.
[03:14:28.349 --> 03:14:30.150]  But Rahm Emanuel's brother
[03:14:31.010 --> 03:14:33.031]  Who's now in the White House advising.
[03:14:33.031 --> 03:14:45.619]  Remember last week he said doctors shouldn't be so obsessed over their Hippocratic oath to do no harm from Hippocrates and for the what the last decade they haven't given the Hippocratic oath.
[03:14:45.619 --> 03:14:50.863]  I mean they really are taking our doctors and nurses and taking them from being great upstanding
[03:14:51.423 --> 03:14:59.291]  Well, the basis of the Hippocratic Oath was Hippocrates, and that was teaching physicians that you're to do everything you can for your patient, and you're never to take a life.
[03:15:15.906 --> 03:15:24.090]  Well, that, of course, was an attack on abortion, and so the left wing didn't like that at all.
[03:15:24.090 --> 03:15:26.732]  Physicians were not supposed to take lives.
[03:15:26.732 --> 03:15:34.796]  It also included euthanasia, meaning you're never to kill someone because you think they're a useless life.
[03:15:34.796 --> 03:15:43.020]  Well, they didn't like that either, so we have at least two things that were getting under the skin of the left as abortion and euthanasia.
[03:15:43.476 --> 03:15:46.557]  So they want the oath to be removed.
[03:15:46.557 --> 03:15:59.923]  Well now, with Ezekiel Emanuel, who's the physician, saying that this oath should be abandoned, and physicians are just too obsessed with the idea of saving lives, and we need to start letting these people go.
[03:15:59.923 --> 03:16:02.765]  They're just wasted effort.
[03:16:02.765 --> 03:16:05.406]  That they have no social utility.
[03:16:05.406 --> 03:16:08.327]  And of course, that would also include all disabled people.
[03:16:09.259 --> 03:16:14.981]  Because according to this lexicon, disabled people have no social utility.
[03:16:14.981 --> 03:16:16.662]  They have no purpose.
[03:16:16.662 --> 03:16:18.422]  And they're a drain on the economy.
[03:16:18.422 --> 03:16:20.723]  Therefore, we should just let them die.
[03:16:20.723 --> 03:16:31.847]  It even says in the Hastings Center that it has been a crazy idea to give dialysis to people because some are living 20 years on dialysis.
[03:16:31.847 --> 03:16:36.328]  And that we could have just let them go at the time that they develop renal failure.
[03:16:36.900 --> 03:16:41.083]  And they even, in one of the articles, said we should turn back the clock on medicine.
[03:16:41.083 --> 03:16:49.870]  Instead of practicing high technology medicine we have today, we should turn it back to the 1960s level and have that as our healthcare.
[03:16:49.870 --> 03:17:05.121]  Doctor, is there any doubt in your incredibly deep breadth of research that these are eugenicists, and we have a eugenicists' eugenics guild running our modern society, and that at the core,
[03:17:06.693 --> 03:17:11.176]  It's just a rationale to be sadistic control freaks who are on power trips.
[03:17:11.176 --> 03:17:15.460]  I mean, most of these hollow people, they don't even think they're doing good.
[03:17:15.460 --> 03:17:18.582]  These are really dark people.
[03:17:18.582 --> 03:17:20.383]  Well, yeah, I think it's a mixed group.
[03:17:20.383 --> 03:17:25.247]  I think there's some who, in their perverted way of thinking, think it's good.
[03:17:25.247 --> 03:17:30.010]  Some are just evil people from the core.
[03:17:30.010 --> 03:17:33.313]  But, you know, if you read their literature, they really think this is
[03:17:33.846 --> 03:17:38.909]  Something that's beneficial to society is to get rid of what they call the human weed.
[03:17:38.909 --> 03:17:42.651]  They said you weed a garden and get rid of the weed.
[03:17:42.651 --> 03:17:44.612]  Well, that's what we have to do in society.
[03:17:44.612 --> 03:17:53.798]  It's filled with all these unfit, these people who don't deserve life, and we should weed them out by whatever method we can.
[03:17:53.798 --> 03:18:02.263]  And they said, well, we know the public won't accept extermination camps, but if we could just deny them health care, they'll die off on their own.
[03:18:02.699 --> 03:18:04.440]  And that's what Margaret Sanger, of course, said.
[03:18:04.440 --> 03:18:06.662]  You're repeating her and then that's repeated.
[03:18:06.662 --> 03:18:13.447]  But really, the test of humanity is people that are more intelligent, stronger, we're meant to lift up the weak.
[03:18:13.447 --> 03:18:20.152]  At the moment, we delve into this, we let pure wickedness out of the bottle and societies collapse.
[03:18:20.950 --> 03:18:21.751]  Well, absolutely.
[03:18:21.751 --> 03:18:28.276]  I mean, when you start reading what some of the so-called elite write, it's quite frightening.
[03:18:28.276 --> 03:18:36.262]  Like I said, the stage was set for Adolf Hitler in the 1900s, the 1800s.
[03:18:36.262 --> 03:18:39.605]  People were writing things that he eventually implemented.
[03:18:39.605 --> 03:18:42.487]  Same thing with Lenin and Stalin and Mao Zedong.
[03:18:42.487 --> 03:18:45.789]  There were people who wrote quite eloquent
[03:18:46.914 --> 03:18:52.378]  Papers about controlling society and exterminating mass numbers of people.
[03:18:52.378 --> 03:18:56.362]  Well, along came a dictator strong enough to carry this out.
[03:18:56.362 --> 03:18:59.024]  What the average public sees is the dictator.
[03:18:59.024 --> 03:19:06.990]  They don't see the foundation that was set 50 or 100 years before by these elitists.
[03:19:06.990 --> 03:19:08.812]  One of the things that scares me is this bill.
[03:19:08.812 --> 03:19:14.096]  It describes taking over the entire medical education system.
[03:19:14.096 --> 03:19:16.438]  It talks about, in medical schools,
[03:19:16.892 --> 03:19:20.213]  Well, sir, that's what the cybersecurity bill says.
[03:19:20.213 --> 03:19:30.597]  If you're connected to any servers, any IT, the way it's written, everything, special federally certified cybersecurity people must be there, like it's a union,
[03:19:45.263 --> 03:19:54.729]  And you must serve them and they must certify you to be... I mean, if this passes to run this office, we're going to have federal goons in here.
[03:19:54.729 --> 03:19:56.210]  And that's what they're doing to medicine.
[03:19:56.210 --> 03:20:00.133]  I mean, folks, this is a control freak total takeover.
[03:20:00.133 --> 03:20:09.999]  Your phone calls, I promise, when we come back... With 2 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[03:20:10.339 --> 03:20:16.347]  At HempUSA.org we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[03:20:16.347 --> 03:20:22.815]  At HempUSA.org we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC free.
[03:20:23.436 --> 03:20:26.837]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[03:20:26.837 --> 03:20:29.278]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[03:20:29.278 --> 03:20:35.880]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[03:20:35.880 --> 03:20:39.401]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[03:20:39.401 --> 03:20:43.262]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[03:20:46.443 --> 03:20:49.608]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[03:20:49.608 --> 03:20:51.812]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[03:20:51.812 --> 03:20:55.478]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[03:20:55.478 --> 03:20:57.241]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[03:21:01.900 --> 03:21:09.425]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:21:09.425 --> 03:21:11.146]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:21:11.146 --> 03:21:14.027]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:21:14.027 --> 03:21:17.669]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:21:27.306 --> 03:21:33.463]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:21:33.463 --> 03:21:34.586]  An inside job.
[03:21:35.971 --> 03:21:37.452]  How dare you?
[03:21:37.452 --> 03:21:43.496]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:21:43.496 --> 03:21:46.377]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:21:46.377 --> 03:21:52.621]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[03:21:52.621 --> 03:21:55.723]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[03:21:55.723 --> 03:21:57.964]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:21:57.964 --> 03:22:00.426]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:22:00.939 --> 03:22:01.979]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[03:22:01.979 --> 03:22:06.941]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[03:22:06.941 --> 03:22:15.004]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[03:22:15.004 --> 03:22:20.346]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[03:22:20.566 --> 03:22:27.875]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[03:22:27.875 --> 03:22:33.461]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[03:22:33.461 --> 03:22:38.187]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation
[03:22:38.527 --> 03:22:46.456]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[03:22:46.456 --> 03:22:53.043]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[03:22:53.043 --> 03:22:54.285]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:54.285 --> 03:22:54.485]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:00.475 --> 03:23:01.776]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:23:01.776 --> 03:23:07.360]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:23:07.360 --> 03:23:12.383]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:23:12.383 --> 03:23:17.967]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:23:17.967 --> 03:23:22.650]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:23:23.168 --> 03:23:30.289]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:23:30.289 --> 03:23:31.409]  And here's the best part.
[03:23:31.409 --> 03:23:38.091]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:23:38.091 --> 03:23:41.291]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:23:41.291 --> 03:23:44.452]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:23:44.452 --> 03:23:44.652]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:23:53.217 --> 03:23:56.058]  Man, I wanted to get into things to protect yourself from this flu.
[03:23:56.058 --> 03:23:58.020]  Does Dr. Blaylock think it's all hype?
[03:24:21.075 --> 03:24:22.697]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[03:24:22.697 --> 03:24:23.698]  Dr. Glaylock, how are you doing?
[03:24:42.249 --> 03:24:51.097]  I have a couple of questions about the swine flu shot, also about the healthcare, but I'd like to make two comments if I may, Alex.
[03:24:51.097 --> 03:24:53.179]  Okay, that's two questions and two comments.
[03:24:53.179 --> 03:24:55.821]  Make it quick, please.
[03:24:55.821 --> 03:25:00.565]  Number one, I do have some very interesting things that I'd like to discuss with you at a later time.
[03:25:00.565 --> 03:25:01.586]  I have your number.
[03:25:01.586 --> 03:25:02.767]  I'll get in touch with you.
[03:25:02.767 --> 03:25:02.927]  Okay.
[03:25:05.914 --> 03:25:11.436]  I've never gone public with this, and Big Brother probably is not going to like it.
[03:25:11.436 --> 03:25:13.457]  In fact, I may even be in fear of my life.
[03:25:13.457 --> 03:25:14.618]  Tony, please.
[03:25:14.618 --> 03:25:15.658]  That's a big preface.
[03:25:15.658 --> 03:25:16.638]  Just tell us, sir.
[03:25:16.638 --> 03:25:18.339]  We don't have a lot of time.
[03:25:18.339 --> 03:25:20.000]  Okay.
[03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:22.621]  In 91, I tried to join the military.
[03:25:22.621 --> 03:25:27.663]  I went through the MEPS process, where, you know, it's the Military Entrance Process Center.
[03:25:28.773 --> 03:25:33.776]  Uh, where they give you shots and take your physical and all that stuff.
[03:25:33.776 --> 03:25:41.081]  Well, about two weeks afterwards, they called me into the office and told me that I had the AIDS virus.
[03:25:41.081 --> 03:25:42.422]  I am not gay.
[03:25:42.422 --> 03:25:44.624]  I have never had a blood transfusion.
[03:25:44.624 --> 03:25:46.865]  I do not do drugs of any kind.
[03:25:46.865 --> 03:25:49.367]  Yeah, but about a third of the time they give you a false positive, sir.
[03:25:50.413 --> 03:25:50.733]  Right.
[03:25:50.733 --> 03:25:53.995]  Well, anyway, it turns out that that's what it is.
[03:25:53.995 --> 03:25:58.497]  And after research and everything, I know where I got it, you know.
[03:25:58.497 --> 03:26:10.122]  And so my question is, number one, with someone in that situation, how is the swine flu vaccine and the health care going to affect them?
[03:26:10.122 --> 03:26:12.923]  All right, listen, I appreciate your call.
[03:26:12.923 --> 03:26:15.564]  He's asking, he's saying he has an HIV virus.
[03:26:15.564 --> 03:26:16.785]  Well, what will this do?
[03:26:17.438 --> 03:26:21.239]  Well, if you have an HIV virus, you shouldn't have any vaccine.
[03:26:21.239 --> 03:26:22.420]  Number one, they don't work.
[03:26:22.420 --> 03:26:31.642]  Number two, if you have the vaccine and you're immunocompromised, you run a very high risk of developing autoimmune disease.
[03:26:31.642 --> 03:26:38.104]  So you're in a special category where it's most people's evaluation.
[03:26:38.104 --> 03:26:42.746]  You should not be vaccinated and it's not going to protect you.
[03:26:42.746 --> 03:26:43.466]  So that would be
[03:26:44.573 --> 03:26:50.937]  Doctor, what about this spin we hear that before you're not supposed to vaccinate pregnant women, but now, oh, that's the group that needs it first.
[03:26:50.937 --> 03:26:54.880]  Is that some attempt to make the vaccine look safe, or why?
[03:26:54.880 --> 03:26:57.242]  Why pregnant women first?
[03:26:57.242 --> 03:27:11.891]  Well, it was known some time ago that women who develop the flu during certain periods of their pregnancy have a very high incidence of their children becoming either autistic or developing schizophrenia when they get older.
[03:27:13.552 --> 03:27:18.655]  You know, the incidence rate is as high as 7 to 12 or higher.
[03:27:18.655 --> 03:27:24.099]  It was thought that that was due to the flu virus getting into the baby's nervous system.
[03:27:24.099 --> 03:27:26.761]  The studies have since shown that it's not that at all.
[03:27:26.761 --> 03:27:34.106]  It's the fact that the mother's immune system is activated and it's the immune cytokines that enter the baby that produce the damage.
[03:27:35.117 --> 03:27:39.299]  So the same information you discovered decades ago is now admitted in the medical journals?
[03:27:39.299 --> 03:27:40.120]  Sure.
[03:27:40.120 --> 03:27:58.269]  And when you do this vaccination process, what you're doing, you're repeating that, you're massively increasing the pregnant woman's immune system cytokine, raising her baby's risk of autism, or developing schizophrenia.
[03:27:58.269 --> 03:28:02.452]  And is that because the baby's own immune system attacks its nerves?
[03:28:03.243 --> 03:28:12.086]  Yeah, it activates the immune system in the baby's brain, the microglia, producing an immunoid cytotoxic reaction.
[03:28:12.086 --> 03:28:13.366]  But that's been well-demonstrated.
[03:28:13.366 --> 03:28:17.007]  They even know which cytokine does it.
[03:28:17.007 --> 03:28:22.649]  So they know this, they know this, and they're telling women to take it.
[03:28:22.649 --> 03:28:28.031]  I know, and to me it's just, you know, I think it's the most insane thing you could possibly do.
[03:28:29.257 --> 03:28:34.599]  You know, this has a very low communicability, this virus.
[03:28:34.599 --> 03:28:40.861]  And so a woman's chance during pregnancy, at that particular age, developing flu, is pretty small.
[03:28:40.861 --> 03:28:45.363]  But if you give them all the vaccine, then it's 100% they're all vaccinated.
[03:28:45.363 --> 03:28:55.346]  And the real dangerous thing about this vaccine, they talk about giving three vaccines in 21 days, which if you know neuroscience, that is particularly dangerous because the intent
[03:28:56.002 --> 03:29:03.368]  Immune activation in the brain, the immunocytotoxicity in the mother's brain, and particularly in the developing baby's brain.
[03:29:03.368 --> 03:29:06.191]  Is that called a cascade?
[03:29:06.191 --> 03:29:21.223]  Well, it's a cytokine cascade, and what happens is that these immune cells produce so many cytokines, these destructive immune chemicals, it starts destroying brain connections and making the brain develop abnormally.
[03:29:21.883 --> 03:29:24.103]  And they think that's what produces the autism.
[03:29:24.103 --> 03:29:31.565]  Which eugenicist Bertrand Russell said, we will give children injections to brain damage them to make them part of the servant class.
[03:29:31.565 --> 03:29:33.425]  But I bet the government's just idiots.
[03:29:33.425 --> 03:29:39.346]  They just so happen to want to target kids and women and people with something that brain damages them.
[03:29:39.346 --> 03:29:40.746]  I mean, this is just amazing.
[03:29:40.746 --> 03:29:43.487]  Mike, Andrew, Jeremy, Pat, we're good to all your calls.
[03:29:43.487 --> 03:29:46.107]  Final segment, Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[03:29:46.107 --> 03:29:48.067]  His website's BlaylockReport.com.
[03:29:48.067 --> 03:29:51.008]  He's got books, DVDs, everything available there.
[03:29:51.892 --> 03:29:55.819]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.819 --> 03:29:58.504]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.288 --> 03:30:05.529]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.529 --> 03:30:07.529]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.529 --> 03:30:16.051]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:16.051 --> 03:30:21.593]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.593 --> 03:30:23.213]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.473 --> 03:30:29.977]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.977 --> 03:30:41.044]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:41.044 --> 03:30:41.504]  That's right.
[03:30:41.784 --> 03:30:44.366]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[03:31:02.065 --> 03:31:04.047]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[03:31:04.047 --> 03:31:07.671]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:31:07.671 --> 03:31:09.753]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:31:09.753 --> 03:31:13.196]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:31:13.196 --> 03:31:18.982]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:31:18.982 --> 03:31:22.926]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[03:31:23.246 --> 03:31:28.469]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[03:33:06.716 --> 03:33:10.563]  There is no doubt that education, the medical system,
[03:33:12.396 --> 03:33:16.480]  Our industries, everything's being regulated, taken over, shut down.
[03:33:16.480 --> 03:33:20.043]  They've used the third world labor to shut down industry.
[03:33:20.043 --> 03:33:22.365]  Everything is about creating a monopoly.
[03:33:22.365 --> 03:33:29.712]  The government wants to wreck society so they can consolidate it, just like Mao and Lenin with their great leap forwards.
[03:33:29.712 --> 03:33:31.833]  This is a system of control.
[03:33:33.032 --> 03:33:34.493]  Order out of chaos.
[03:33:34.493 --> 03:33:36.174]  Dr. Russell Blaylock's our guest.
[03:33:36.174 --> 03:33:41.216]  I was given out the Newsmax.com newsletter that they have with Dr. Blaylock.
[03:33:41.216 --> 03:33:47.839]  His main site, the one to get the books, the videos, all the great materials, is RussellBlaylockMD.com.
[03:33:47.839 --> 03:33:52.181]  RussellBlaylockMD.com or just Google the name Russell Blaylock.
[03:33:52.181 --> 03:33:56.603]  We can find his writings and the materials all right there on the site.
[03:33:56.923 --> 03:34:09.574]  I do want to encourage everybody to also visit our online video bookstore, get our books and videos and t-shirts and materials, not just because they're great materials and wake people up when you share them, but because it also supports what we're doing here overall.
[03:34:09.574 --> 03:34:14.998]  This operation costs a lot of money to run and we also bring in all these guests who we then in turn support.
[03:34:14.998 --> 03:34:21.583]  This show is a huge platform for getting the truth out and I feel really good having doctors and scientists and neurologists on.
[03:34:22.344 --> 03:34:23.564]  Good afternoon Alex and Dr. Blaylock.
[03:34:23.564 --> 03:34:26.525]  About a few years ago I had an accident and I became disabled.
[03:34:26.525 --> 03:34:28.246]  I've got a spinal injury.
[03:34:50.705 --> 03:34:54.707]  I'm in the managed care system here in St.
[03:34:54.707 --> 03:34:59.971]  Louis, and I go to the medical school here.
[03:34:59.971 --> 03:35:06.415]  I've been taking the vaccinations that they give every year.
[03:35:06.415 --> 03:35:10.478]  I guess it's been seven or eight years now.
[03:35:10.478 --> 03:35:17.342]  I've developed arthritis, and I never had psoriasis before, and my question is,
[03:35:19.864 --> 03:35:28.147]  Your psoriasis, could that have come from the immunization that I've been getting?
[03:35:28.147 --> 03:35:35.249]  Well, it's possible because it is an autoimmune disease, but psoriasis is associated with arthritis.
[03:35:35.249 --> 03:35:40.951]  There is a rheumatoid arthritis syndrome associated with psoriasis.
[03:35:40.951 --> 03:35:46.133]  Now, whether or not you just spontaneously develop psoriasis or the vaccine, it's hard to tell.
[03:35:47.145 --> 03:35:51.407]  It is an autoimmune disease, and we're seeing a lot of psoriasis now.
[03:35:51.407 --> 03:35:55.690]  Like I said, all of the autoimmune diseases are increasing astronomically.
[03:35:55.690 --> 03:36:02.933]  Can I just add, sir, that if you'll search engine, vaccines, arthritis, this is not Dr. Blaylock or my opinion.
[03:36:02.933 --> 03:36:06.856]  They know, in all the studies with rodents, they get it.
[03:36:06.856 --> 03:36:09.297]  I mean, baby mice and rats get it.
[03:36:09.297 --> 03:36:11.558]  And you're having an autoimmune response in your joints.
[03:36:13.599 --> 03:36:15.299]  This is a more important question.
[03:36:15.299 --> 03:36:18.580]  Doctor, what can he do to detox?
[03:36:18.580 --> 03:36:21.200]  He's got his immune system all cranked up.
[03:36:21.200 --> 03:36:26.681]  What can he do before he gets diabetes, before he gets real brain damage?
[03:36:26.681 --> 03:36:31.462]  Is there something he can do to detox or to get the swelling down?
[03:36:31.462 --> 03:36:43.324]  Well, I can't give specific advice over the program, but just in general, what you want to do is if you're having an autoimmune reaction, you want to increase your omega-3 oil intake.
[03:36:44.005 --> 03:36:55.929]  There's a Norwegian oil that you can get that has a balance of EPA, DHA components that reduces this autoimmune reaction.
[03:36:55.929 --> 03:36:58.530]  Works very well for a lot of autoimmune diseases.
[03:36:58.530 --> 03:37:03.411]  You just take a teaspoon a day, every day.
[03:37:03.411 --> 03:37:06.672]  But vitamin D3 is the most important.
[03:37:06.672 --> 03:37:09.493]  It is an immune modulator.
[03:37:09.493 --> 03:37:13.014]  It prevents over-reactivity of the immune system.
[03:37:13.723 --> 03:37:23.412]  And there's good evidence that people who have rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or these other diseases have a deficiency in vitamin D3.
[03:37:23.412 --> 03:37:28.796]  You may have heard about multiple sclerosis and the connection to some experts.
[03:37:28.796 --> 03:37:38.745]  You can take vitamin D3 in a dose of 2,000 to 5,000 units a day and that can significantly reduce many of these autoimmune diseases.
[03:37:39.409 --> 03:37:46.654]  And that's a good way to prevent the flu from causing bad injury to you.
[03:37:46.654 --> 03:37:53.258]  Because when you take vitamin D3, it stimulates the body to produce what's called antimicrobial peptides.
[03:37:53.258 --> 03:37:57.401]  And they are very powerful at killing viruses, bacteria, fungi.
[03:37:57.401 --> 03:38:04.906]  And there's evidence that people who have high vitamin D levels rarely have any sort of bad effects from flu infections.
[03:38:06.574 --> 03:38:12.497]  And sir, isn't it showing that cancer rates go way down from people getting moderate sun every day?
[03:38:12.497 --> 03:38:24.582]  Yeah, with elevated vitamin D3 in the body, it's about a 50% reduction in the number of cancers, particularly breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer.
[03:38:24.582 --> 03:38:32.466]  And it's for the same reason, because all of these things are produced for chronic inflammation, and vitamin D3 reduces inflammation.
[03:38:32.466 --> 03:38:35.327]  Now, vitamin D3 is the functional form of the vitamin.
[03:38:35.928 --> 03:38:36.849]  I don't know.
[03:38:52.947 --> 03:39:08.340]  Well, I mean, this goes back to, and again, I'm not a biologist or a brain surgeon like you, but just reading medical text, I can get the essence of it, but that's why they call the British limeys, because their guys weren't collapsing on the deck 10,000 miles away from home, because they carried little limes with them.
[03:39:08.800 --> 03:39:16.087]  That kept their collagen up because the vitamin C was needed with the vitamin D absorption somehow at a metabolic level.
[03:39:16.087 --> 03:39:20.431]  I don't quite understand that, but I mean, look, a lot of America has scurvy.
[03:39:20.431 --> 03:39:21.492]  We're not getting sunlight.
[03:39:21.492 --> 03:39:22.973]  We're not eating good food.
[03:39:22.973 --> 03:39:24.615]  We're eating a bunch of crud.
[03:39:24.615 --> 03:39:26.957]  I mean, in layman's terms, is that good advice, doctor?
[03:39:26.957 --> 03:39:29.960]  Yeah, you know, all these vitamins interact.
[03:39:29.960 --> 03:39:33.483]  People don't generally, and a lot of nutritionists don't seem to understand that
[03:39:33.979 --> 03:39:40.100]  The vitamins have interactions that benefited the functional ability of the vitamins.
[03:39:40.100 --> 03:39:49.503]  So you take vitamin D, you take vitamin E, you take carotenoids, the other B vitamins, and selenium, and magnesium.
[03:39:49.503 --> 03:39:53.844]  All of these things drastically reduce autoimmune disorders.
[03:39:53.844 --> 03:40:00.285]  They stimulate your healthy immunity to help you resist virus, bacteria.
[03:40:00.285 --> 03:40:03.546]  People that are high on flu are generally immune-suppressed.
[03:40:04.161 --> 03:40:12.687]  Normal, healthy people with good immune systems rarely die or even get seriously ill from the flu.
[03:40:12.687 --> 03:40:23.193]  So when you see these teenagers, for instance, in the studies on this flu, 32% of the children that died had asthma, which is an immune disorder.
[03:40:23.193 --> 03:40:27.876]  Other ones have multiple illnesses, diabetes, heart disease, other inflammatory immune diseases.
[03:40:27.876 --> 03:40:30.078]  Well look at old folks who never get out and get sun!
[03:40:30.748 --> 03:40:38.072]  Well, and they also have difficulty converting the sunlight into vitamin D. So they need to take the supplement.
[03:40:38.072 --> 03:40:46.916]  And it's been shown that until you get above at least 1,000 units of vitamin D3, your blood levels really don't rise.
[03:40:46.916 --> 03:40:54.240]  When you're in the sun for 30 minutes, you're getting about 10,000, 20,000 units of vitamin D3 manufactured.
[03:40:54.240 --> 03:40:54.860]  Man, I love it.
[03:40:54.860 --> 03:40:59.543]  I can have a headache, be tired, go out 30 minutes in the sun in my backyard, and it's like...
[03:41:00.538 --> 03:41:01.279]  Energized.
[03:41:01.279 --> 03:41:05.565]  I mean, it's like a million times better than a cup of coffee.
[03:41:05.565 --> 03:41:07.667]  We gotta let the doctor go here in just a few minutes.
[03:41:07.667 --> 03:41:09.870]  Mike, I hope that answered your questions.
[03:41:09.870 --> 03:41:13.935]  Are they pushing vaccines on you when you go in to get medical care?
[03:41:13.935 --> 03:41:14.616]  He dropped off.
[03:41:14.616 --> 03:41:16.278]  I know they are pushing it now.
[03:41:16.278 --> 03:41:17.600]  Andrew in Toronto, Canada.
[03:41:17.600 --> 03:41:18.762]  You're on the air with Dr. Blaylock.
[03:41:21.169 --> 03:41:21.849]  Hello?
[03:41:21.849 --> 03:41:23.170]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[03:41:23.170 --> 03:41:29.994]  Yeah, I just wanted to make a comment and tell you about a new tool I've created for the InfoWar and ask a quick question.
[03:41:29.994 --> 03:41:38.159]  The question, in light of all the denial, the huge level of denial everywhere and where we are at in terms of the timing of everything,
[03:41:39.594 --> 03:41:46.238]  I mean, there's a lot of people that when you point them on to certain resources, they just shut off when they hear about similarities.
[03:41:46.238 --> 03:41:46.778]  I hear you.
[03:41:46.778 --> 03:41:47.658]  I gotta jump though.
[03:41:47.658 --> 03:41:48.619]  I can't get into other subjects.
[03:41:48.619 --> 03:41:50.360]  I want to jam in some more calls.
[03:41:50.360 --> 03:41:58.264]  Dr. Blaylock, what do you do when you, even as an eminent brain surgeon, neurologist, you know, your work's all over the medical literature, trailblazing.
[03:41:58.264 --> 03:42:00.845]  You don't really toot your horn on so many fronts.
[03:42:00.845 --> 03:42:04.087]  I mean, I would imagine you run into people that are just doubting.
[03:42:04.087 --> 03:42:06.789]  What do you say to people that just want to take shots every year?
[03:42:07.829 --> 03:42:12.051]  Well, that's it.
[03:42:12.051 --> 03:42:19.473]  You know, it's a free country, and if you want to do it, then you just have to accept the consequences.
[03:42:19.473 --> 03:42:22.354]  I'll present you with the evidence if you want it.
[03:42:22.354 --> 03:42:32.858]  You can look at it, you can take it or leave it, and you'll pay for ignoring it, but that's the benefit of a free country, or one of the effects of a free country.
[03:42:33.709 --> 03:42:34.069]  Absolutely.
[03:42:34.069 --> 03:42:35.990]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeremy in Texas.
[03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:37.351]  Jeremy, you're on the air.
[03:42:37.351 --> 03:42:38.571]  Yeah, Dr. Locke, Mr. Jones.
[03:42:58.504 --> 03:43:04.535]  Everything in Obamacare, everything having to do with the vaccine, is an extreme danger to life or property.
[03:43:04.535 --> 03:43:06.197]  And I wonder your opinion.
[03:43:06.197 --> 03:43:10.966]  And every time that we try to wake up somebody, it will not make the news.
[03:43:11.826 --> 03:43:20.350]  What if patriots across the United States begin flying the United States flag Union side down as a public display to try to wake people up?
[03:43:20.350 --> 03:43:25.833]  A lot of people are doing that, and then when neighbors ask why you're doing it, you can explain it's the country in distress.
[03:43:25.833 --> 03:43:34.357]  That's why we've had the poster contest that we're extending entries out until next Tuesday, where people put up posters of political ideas and then videotape it.
[03:43:34.357 --> 03:43:38.700]  The contest is you've got to videotape it and get that submission in to us.
[03:43:40.201 --> 03:43:42.263]  And it's having a great effect.
[03:43:42.263 --> 03:43:45.425]  Look what we did with the Obama Joker poster nationwide.
[03:43:45.425 --> 03:44:00.980]  That probably made it in, conservatively, that I've seen, 60, 70, 80, probably more, newspapers from Tokyo to Los Angeles, TV stations covering it.
[03:44:00.980 --> 03:44:02.501]  That's just what our listeners did.
[03:44:02.501 --> 03:44:05.323]  So, yes, we need to somehow
[03:44:06.277 --> 03:44:09.679]  Dr. Blaylock, I wanted to take medical questions for you.
[03:44:09.679 --> 03:44:11.080]  So many of these are on other subjects.
[03:44:11.080 --> 03:44:12.822]  Let's talk to Pat in Ohio.
[03:44:12.822 --> 03:44:15.483]  Pat, do you have a medical question for Dr. Blaylock?
[03:44:15.483 --> 03:44:15.824]  Yes.
[03:44:15.824 --> 03:44:17.925]  Hello, Alex and Dr. Blaylock.
[03:44:17.925 --> 03:44:20.587]  My mom, she suffers from Alzheimer's.
[03:44:20.587 --> 03:44:24.109]  In the past month, she's been really regressing.
[03:44:24.109 --> 03:44:30.434]  And I need to know, is there any type of modern-day technology that can help to improve her condition?
[03:44:30.434 --> 03:44:31.234]  Exercise?
[03:44:31.234 --> 03:44:32.455]  And a contact number.
[03:44:32.455 --> 03:44:33.696]  Well, I do exercise with her.
[03:44:34.246 --> 03:44:38.968]  She's gotten to the point where she won't even eat now unless I feed her or someone feeds her.
[03:44:38.968 --> 03:44:42.329]  She gets into a sleep, a stupor-like.
[03:44:42.329 --> 03:44:44.370]  And, um, that's what I need.
[03:44:44.370 --> 03:44:46.791]  I need a contact number also, a telephone number.
[03:44:46.791 --> 03:44:49.472]  A telephone number for who?
[03:44:49.472 --> 03:44:50.692]  Dr. Blalock.
[03:44:50.692 --> 03:44:53.393]  Oh, I don't see patients any longer.
[03:44:53.393 --> 03:44:58.375]  Um, well, you know, Alzheimer's disease is an inflammatory brain disease.
[03:44:58.375 --> 03:45:00.416]  It's a chronic brain inflammation.
[03:45:01.015 --> 03:45:02.736]  The elderly are getting really sleepy.
[03:45:02.736 --> 03:45:07.841]  It means their brain is more inflamed.
[03:45:07.841 --> 03:45:18.290]  And as the Alzheimer's patient reaches toward the end of the disease, there's a lot of loss of cells as well as connections.
[03:45:18.290 --> 03:45:27.898]  The only thing that I know that I generally recommend for people with Alzheimer's is drastically increase your vitamin D intake.
[03:45:28.527 --> 03:45:31.569]  Because that's the best way to reduce your brain inflammation.
[03:45:31.569 --> 03:45:35.052]  Magnesium, the fish oil, all in combination.
[03:45:35.052 --> 03:45:38.015]  Is your mother on magnesium and fish oil and vitamin D, ma'am?
[03:45:38.015 --> 03:45:48.904]  Yeah, she's an integrated medicine doctor and they put on omega-3 and fish oil and a variety of stuff.
[03:45:48.904 --> 03:45:52.206]  She's not drinking Diet Coke or eating... No, no, no, no.
[03:45:52.206 --> 03:45:55.169]  She drinks just juice, mainly water, a lot of water anymore.
[03:45:56.292 --> 03:45:59.435]  She doesn't drink pop, and of course she doesn't drink liquor.
[03:45:59.435 --> 03:46:00.716]  Is it chlorine?
[03:46:00.716 --> 03:46:02.137]  It's not tap water, is it?
[03:46:02.137 --> 03:46:03.138]  No, no, no.
[03:46:03.138 --> 03:46:03.738]  She's been off that.
[03:46:03.738 --> 03:46:05.900]  Well, again, I'm not practicing medicine here.
[03:46:05.900 --> 03:46:08.082]  I'm just going from what I've heard doctors say.
[03:46:08.082 --> 03:46:14.787]  At a point, doctor, isn't it just the brain loss is so great that it's a downward spiral?
[03:46:14.787 --> 03:46:22.253]  Yeah, when you see people who have Alzheimer's, their brain immune reaction sparks the normal aging.
[03:46:22.253 --> 03:46:25.836]  And as the disease progresses, the inflammatory reaction increases.
[03:46:26.798 --> 03:46:27.578]  I don't know.
[03:46:43.329 --> 03:46:46.692]  Uh, inflammation that you can look at on my website.
[03:47:04.898 --> 03:47:08.681]  Yeah, I mean, just look, they're getting people 35, 40 years old with Alzheimer's now.
[03:47:08.681 --> 03:47:11.143]  They're poisoning the hell out of us.
[03:47:11.143 --> 03:47:12.825]  And it's just a real shame.
[03:47:12.825 --> 03:47:16.307]  We've got to all watch it and take care of each other to get out of this.
[03:47:16.307 --> 03:47:17.268]  And God bless you, ma'am.
[03:47:17.268 --> 03:47:18.649]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[03:47:18.649 --> 03:47:21.592]  Dr. Blaylock, I've got to get you back on in the next month or so.
[03:47:21.592 --> 03:47:26.176]  We're very thankful for your time and very thankful for all you're doing.
[03:47:26.176 --> 03:47:30.439]  The books, the videos, the materials are all at RussellBlaylockMD.com.
[03:47:30.439 --> 03:47:32.101]  Thank you for spending time with us, sir.
[03:47:32.101 --> 03:47:32.841]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[03:47:32.841 --> 03:47:33.422]  God bless you.
[03:47:34.042 --> 03:47:35.663]  God bless you.
[03:47:35.663 --> 03:47:41.787]  Yeah, it's painful taking phone calls like that one.
[03:47:41.787 --> 03:47:49.651]  I want to come back and hit a little bit on the Van Jones thing, because they're trying to tie in the 9-11 truth, and I waited to go to calls.
[03:47:49.651 --> 03:47:58.457]  I'll have Blaylock back and do two hours just with calls, and I wasn't trying to be mean to callers I hung up on, but I just can't talk about other subjects when he's on, because I'm talking about the grain right now.
[03:48:00.171 --> 03:48:06.097]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up the next two minutes before we come back to the final segment, though, because I want to explain this.
[03:48:06.097 --> 03:48:07.338]  Ted has gold and silver.
[03:48:07.338 --> 03:48:14.885]  He sold out of the stuff he bought between 9.05 and 9.16, the gold, when gold was at that price.
[03:48:14.885 --> 03:48:17.687]  Now gold's right up at 1,000 today.
[03:48:17.687 --> 03:48:25.675]  He sold out of that, but he made more buys last week when it was at the 9.20 to 9.40 level, so you're already, you're still buying gold and silver.
[03:48:27.392 --> 03:48:28.493]  We're good to go.
[03:48:49.033 --> 03:48:55.899]  I mean, when Ted's normally selling this gold, you know, when the market didn't even up, there's a tiny, like, $4 markup on a $225 coin.
[03:48:55.899 --> 03:48:57.941]  I mean, I've seen that.
[03:48:57.941 --> 03:48:59.903]  Ted's already selling it super cheap.
[03:48:59.903 --> 03:49:05.127]  But when the market goes up, he's selling it to you from when he bought it at a lower price at the same price.
[03:49:05.127 --> 03:49:09.291]  But this gold and silver, he told me, will run out in the next day or two.
[03:49:09.291 --> 03:49:11.093]  So he's going to hold this deal through the weekend.
[03:49:11.753 --> 03:49:20.303]  Even though Ted told me he lost some money yesterday because he actually ran out of gold at the one price he had, but he's just selling you gold at a lower price than he even bought it.
[03:49:20.303 --> 03:49:23.667]  Now, Ted's had to quit that deal today, but it's still a super good deal.
[03:49:23.667 --> 03:49:25.248]  This deal's about to end.
[03:49:25.248 --> 03:49:27.411]  Ted, tell folks what you've got and give them the number.
[03:49:27.791 --> 03:49:36.737]  Yeah, the coins that I have, they're still priced at the lowest level that I picked up here recently, are the Walking Liberty half silver pieces.
[03:49:36.737 --> 03:49:38.358]  It's silver, but it's silver.
[03:49:38.358 --> 03:49:39.299]  It's still at a good buy.
[03:49:39.299 --> 03:49:39.319]  $8.69.
[03:49:39.319 --> 03:49:40.940]  I mean, silver's over $16 an ounce now.
[03:49:43.241 --> 03:49:47.925]  The goal that I have right now is the $10 Liberty, and they're at $8.18.
[03:49:47.925 --> 03:49:49.926]  The place to get in contact with us is 1-800-686-2237.
[03:49:49.926 --> 03:49:54.489]  And just a quick note for those of you who picked up the Franks yesterday at the price of $216, right now you're looking at $233.
[03:49:54.489 --> 03:49:56.591]  And those of you who picked up the British Sovereign coin,
[03:50:06.298 --> 03:50:10.280]  At the price of, let's see, right here it is $2.66.
[03:50:10.280 --> 03:50:11.981]  Right now they're at $2.88.
[03:50:11.981 --> 03:50:15.904]  So, nice going for you there.
[03:50:15.904 --> 03:50:19.346]  All I can say, Alex, right now is that gold is breaking upward.
[03:50:19.346 --> 03:50:21.267]  It's had a lot of resistance at that $9.40, $9.45 level.
[03:50:23.368 --> 03:50:27.613]  Everybody's looking for gold to break through $1,000 an ounce.
[03:50:27.613 --> 03:50:29.215]  I can't see how it won't do that.
[03:50:29.215 --> 03:50:33.820]  It may correct a little bit here and there, but it's holding at that high nine, so it's going to go up.
[03:50:33.820 --> 03:50:41.108]  I'd just call us at 1-800-686-2237 and take advantage of the few offers that I have left here before Labor Day.
[03:50:41.479 --> 03:50:41.999]  That's right.
[03:50:41.999 --> 03:50:45.040]  Some of the gold futures have gone above a thousand an ounce, folks.
[03:50:45.040 --> 03:50:45.160]  800-686-2237.
[03:50:45.160 --> 03:50:45.260]  800-686-2237.
[03:50:45.260 --> 03:50:45.680]  Ted is smart.
[03:50:45.680 --> 03:50:47.261]  He buys it when it's low.
[03:50:47.261 --> 03:50:49.561]  When it's high, he sells it to you at the low price.
[03:50:49.561 --> 03:50:50.501]  You cannot beat the deal.
[03:50:50.501 --> 03:50:50.562]  800-686-2237.
[03:50:50.562 --> 03:50:51.742]  We'll cover Van Jones.
[03:50:51.742 --> 03:50:52.902]  Most people know.
[03:51:03.305 --> 03:51:03.505]  I think?
[03:51:23.877 --> 03:51:31.761]  To help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy, simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[03:51:31.761 --> 03:51:37.784]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:51:37.784 --> 03:51:44.288]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[03:51:53.537 --> 03:51:57.822]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.426 --> 03:52:14.288]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.288 --> 03:52:20.830]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.830 --> 03:52:22.770]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.770 --> 03:52:25.231]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.231 --> 03:52:36.114]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.422 --> 03:52:40.083]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.083 --> 03:52:41.944]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.944 --> 03:52:48.849]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:52:57.114 --> 03:52:58.695]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.695 --> 03:52:59.876]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.789 --> 03:53:12.361]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[03:53:12.361 --> 03:53:13.782]  Garden in a Can.
[03:53:13.782 --> 03:53:17.927]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.

[03:53:32.378 --> 03:53:33.799]  Garden in a Can.
[03:53:33.799 --> 03:53:34.999]  It's that simple.
[03:53:34.999 --> 03:53:37.400]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[03:53:37.400 --> 03:53:41.742]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.

[03:53:53.406 --> 03:53:53.446]  866-598-7396.
[03:54:28.097 --> 03:54:32.658]  All right, I meant to spend more time on this and I will Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:54:32.658 --> 03:54:40.821]  We got Gage popping in to start debunking the thing the Arabs funded out of Mumbai.
[03:54:40.821 --> 03:54:44.703]  They're openly funding all of National Geographic.
[03:54:46.633 --> 03:54:52.359]  And Saudi Arabia and that whole Arab emerance over there is deeply involved with the globalists.
[03:54:52.359 --> 03:54:54.921]  So we're going to debunk the ridiculous debunking they did.
[03:54:54.921 --> 03:55:03.690]  I mean, they say the commission was unanimous, the official story has never changed, but the conspiracy theorist story has changed.
[03:55:03.690 --> 03:55:09.976]  We did an analysis and we noticed 7 of the 10 commission members said it was a fraud and a lie.
[03:55:11.186 --> 03:55:14.567]  I hope that's hardly anywhere in the media, but we found all their quotes.
[03:55:14.567 --> 03:55:16.248]  Seven of the ten say it's a fraud.
[03:55:16.248 --> 03:55:18.389]  Yeah, your story stayed the same.
[03:55:18.389 --> 03:55:23.490]  There's a key story up on PrisonPlanet.com that everybody needs to see.
[03:55:23.490 --> 03:55:27.692]  What they're doing is they're introducing National Compulsory Service to us by wearing us out.
[03:55:28.703 --> 03:55:31.845]  Yeah, the President's going to address the youth and ask for your help.
[03:55:31.845 --> 03:55:35.307]  Yeah, he's going to be on big telescreens in front of the kids.
[03:55:35.307 --> 03:55:38.989]  Yeah, he's going to ask them to write letters about how they can help him.
[03:55:38.989 --> 03:55:42.912]  And Al Gore is out saying, don't listen to your parents on global warming, they're idiots.
[03:55:42.912 --> 03:55:44.673]  We played those clips.
[03:55:44.673 --> 03:55:48.755]  And Obama's calling for compulsory service and speeches and his Rahm Emanuelism.
[03:55:48.755 --> 03:55:55.760]  Meanwhile, George Soros and Rockefeller-funded Media Matters, openly fund those groups, are saying we're liars, none of it exists.
[03:55:57.046 --> 03:55:59.308]  Insulting your intelligence, okay?
[03:55:59.308 --> 03:56:03.412]  When the bills are introduced and one bill passed to set up the federal boards.
[03:56:03.412 --> 03:56:14.182]  We have a whole bunch of videos here posted in this article, Paul Watson posted, where the kids are pledging allegiance to Obama, worshipping him, doing whatever he says.
[03:56:16.209 --> 03:56:21.112]  The Feds are taking over healthcare, manufacturing, industry.
[03:56:21.112 --> 03:56:25.855]  Van Jones, their green job czar, says we're going to do this incrementally.
[03:56:25.855 --> 03:56:27.336]  We played the clip yesterday.
[03:56:27.336 --> 03:56:29.837]  We're going to have total communism.
[03:56:29.837 --> 03:56:31.958]  We're going to have total collectivism.
[03:56:31.958 --> 03:56:36.561]  We're going to have total, total is the quote, redistribution of wealth.
[03:56:36.561 --> 03:56:38.602]  But that means into the elite bankers' hands.
[03:56:38.602 --> 03:56:39.643]  The bankers have created
[03:56:41.252 --> 03:56:43.234]  Not even with interest.
[03:56:43.234 --> 03:56:46.996]  $23.7 trillion and counting in 10 months of debt they say we owe.
[03:56:46.996 --> 03:56:52.581]  We give them the money and then we pay them interest on money we give them.
[03:56:52.581 --> 03:57:00.727]  So they've got to have total takeover of society and health care to get that tax money and you're not going to get the health care, you're going to get eugenics.
[03:57:01.929 --> 03:57:03.950]  We've gotta up our game against these people.
[03:57:03.950 --> 03:57:08.272]  We're having an effect, but I'm telling you, Obama is plunging and burning.
[03:57:08.272 --> 03:57:09.633]  He's gonna stage terror attacks.
[03:57:09.633 --> 03:57:11.774]  He's gonna stage something big, and maybe the flu.
[03:57:11.774 --> 03:57:14.556]  I'm not sure, but just look out.
[03:57:14.556 --> 03:57:17.677]  Keep your ears on, your eyes open, get ready.
[03:57:17.677 --> 03:57:21.900]  Because I'm telling you, the enemy's moving on every front, and they're in trouble.
[03:57:21.900 --> 03:57:23.060]  That makes them even more dangerous.
[03:57:23.060 --> 03:57:25.141]  But we can't lay down and let them run over us.
[03:57:25.141 --> 03:57:27.883]  We gotta head up, give them the fight 110%.
[03:57:27.883 --> 03:57:29.243]  Just commit to the fight.
[03:57:29.243 --> 03:57:30.084]  That's the end of it.
[03:57:31.536 --> 03:57:33.398]  Go all the way, don't stop.
[03:57:33.398 --> 03:57:44.026]  And notice they demonized Van Jones properly, he did deserve it, in conservative media, and then they turned around and said he's a 9-11 truther, which isn't really the case.
[03:57:44.026 --> 03:57:46.168]  Somebody just signed it up for him.
[03:57:46.168 --> 03:57:52.533]  That is to then take the anger of grassroots against big government and total communism for the bankers,
[03:57:53.524 --> 03:57:55.685]  And to then put it off on 9-11 Truth.
[03:57:55.685 --> 03:58:03.310]  And you're seeing all these hit pieces against 9-11 Truth right now because they realize it's the key to exposing just how criminal this elite is.
[03:58:03.310 --> 03:58:08.793]  And as long as we're exposing 9-11 as an inside job, they can't stage more terror attacks.
[03:58:08.793 --> 03:58:18.319]  So, we're going to be counter-striking against their lies coming up in the next week with Professor Jones, with Richard Gage.
[03:58:18.319 --> 03:58:19.560]  Let's get David Ray Griffin on.
[03:58:20.737 --> 03:58:22.719]  As well, I just thought to do that.
[03:58:22.719 --> 03:58:25.421]  And I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.

[03:58:51.752 --> 03:58:56.956]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:58:56.956 --> 03:59:00.979]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.979 --> 03:59:06.884]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:06.884 --> 03:59:11.967]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:11.967 --> 03:59:12.468]  Number three,
[03:59:12.868 --> 03:59:19.176]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:59:19.176 --> 03:59:22.080]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:59:22.080 --> 03:59:26.605]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:26.605 --> 03:59:30.210]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:59:30.430 --> 03:59:36.157]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
