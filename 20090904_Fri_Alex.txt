[08:27.160 --> 08:32.120]  situation the quarantines the mass lockdowns the martial law that the
[08:32.120 --> 08:35.880]  feds are openly saying they're planning to engage now that's what they're
[08:35.880 --> 08:39.520]  saying we're not saying it's gonna happen I believe it's gonna fail I
[08:39.520 --> 08:43.560]  believe we're gonna back them off Steve Quayle disagrees and I respect Steve
[08:43.560 --> 08:47.080]  we're gonna get other Horowitz's take on this we're gonna get Dr. Blalock's take
[08:47.080 --> 08:54.520]  on this brain surgeon coming up in the third and fourth hour today and then in
[08:54.520 --> 08:58.000]  the last 30 minutes the show I'm gonna get back into Obama's education take
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.200]  over and I'm gonna get into the whole Van Jones situation with 9-11 truth see
[09:04.200 --> 09:10.520]  he comes out admits he's a communist he openly wants complete transfer of all
[09:10.520 --> 09:14.760]  wealth everyone living in work camps wearing gray uniforms that's the
[09:14.760 --> 09:19.120]  Stalin model and then fat cats and giant palaces with a hundred plus
[09:19.120 --> 09:24.200]  mistresses and giant villas I mean that's that's communism communism doesn't
[09:24.200 --> 09:30.520]  exist in the phony way it's pushed it's always funded by big banks big money
[09:30.520 --> 09:36.760]  they want consolidation and it's hardcore slavery served them feudalism
[09:36.760 --> 09:40.960]  total consolidation of wealth but they tell you it's redistribution and that's
[09:40.960 --> 09:44.160]  why the Bank of England wrote up the plan and had marks and Ingalls go out
[09:44.160 --> 09:47.960]  and push it and that's on record now that's why big money always funds it
[09:47.960 --> 09:53.080]  it's it's it's a really a form of crony capitalism but again they they know how
[09:53.080 --> 09:57.680]  to run scams and mislabel things so they fool people and so we all debate the
[09:57.680 --> 10:03.440]  false left-right paradigm they know van jones is extremely unpopular they know
[10:03.440 --> 10:07.920]  that he called for the youth brigades they know he said that the green jobs is
[10:07.920 --> 10:11.200]  to take over the economy and create communism he's on record that's what it
[10:11.200 --> 10:16.160]  is that's what club of Rome said in the 60s it is that's what they had of the
[10:16.160 --> 10:22.480]  CFR Richard in Haas wrote and said it's a way to totally have eugenics a one
[10:22.480 --> 10:26.320]  child policy and make you so poor you can't afford to even take care of your
[10:26.320 --> 10:34.080]  family it is the state taking over just as the head of the science the science
[10:34.080 --> 10:38.400]  are john p. Holdren wrote in eco science the government textbook and we've now
[10:38.400 --> 10:44.260]  found more than 20 other textbooks he wrote or contributed to and huge papers
[10:44.260 --> 10:49.000]  he wrote that have come out this week that we discovered where he worshiped
[10:49.000 --> 10:54.560]  eugenics itself using that term I mean I mean ladies and gentlemen this is some
[10:54.560 --> 11:00.000]  deep water we're in I mean I people think I exaggerate here I can't describe to
[11:00.000 --> 11:07.960]  you how serious and how real this is so Fox News knew that van jones part of
[11:07.960 --> 11:14.240]  his foundation left cover in Oakland had had his name added by someone in his
[11:14.240 --> 11:21.440]  group to the 9-11 movement because that's a staple of the true left and
[11:21.440 --> 11:25.080]  out the grassroots these are good good people on average even if I agree with
[11:25.080 --> 11:28.080]  a lot of their ideas they they legitimately think socialism and
[11:28.080 --> 11:31.280]  communism is good they just don't know it's a con game and they could look at
[11:31.280 --> 11:34.240]  the evidence and can tell that 9-11 was an inside job this isn't a left-wing
[11:34.240 --> 11:39.800]  right-wing issue but now having the right wing to cry 9-11 truth and the
[11:39.800 --> 11:45.400]  left wing run from him on this when he was already a dead political creature
[11:45.400 --> 11:52.480]  over calling for communism admitting green jobs as a way to hijack the economy
[11:52.480 --> 11:58.720]  so now they bring in van jones and drop him in on the top of this as a cherry on
[11:58.720 --> 12:03.320]  top and claim that he's politically dead weight because of that Fox News puts
[12:03.320 --> 12:10.120]  out a poll 97% saying get rid of him it works like a charm you got all these
[12:10.120 --> 12:17.680]  TV shows on history and on A&E and on PBS and on National Geographic coming out
[12:17.680 --> 12:24.160]  the National Geographic almost funded by the Dubai government a hundred million
[12:24.160 --> 12:29.080]  dollars they put into political films and it's all complete lies and we've got
[12:29.080 --> 12:36.880]  professor Jones architecture engineers founder gauge coming on next week we're
[12:36.880 --> 12:45.280]  going to be covering that but the issue here is that the establishment knew that
[12:45.280 --> 12:50.160]  once bush was out of office he wouldn't have the political power and chain he
[12:50.160 --> 12:52.640]  wouldn't have the political power to cover for the death squads and the
[12:52.640 --> 12:56.640]  torture squads and when the fact that he wanted to stage terror attacks against
[12:56.640 --> 13:02.120]  US ships and blaming on Iran that's now all public and so they're more scared of
[13:02.120 --> 13:06.560]  9-11 now than ever and but they also knew that it would be depoliticized to a
[13:06.560 --> 13:11.960]  certain extent so that they could double back now and attack 9-11 truth and try to
[13:11.960 --> 13:16.920]  rewrite history when we have gained the high ground and 84% of Americans in a
[13:16.920 --> 13:21.560]  New York Times poll believe the government's lying about 9-11 now they're
[13:21.560 --> 13:26.920]  seeing in pull 83% agree with Charlie Sheen that it's an inside job they know
[13:26.920 --> 13:32.480]  that we continue to march and wake people up and so they're trying to double
[13:32.480 --> 13:36.560]  back when they have someone highly politically unpopular Obama is plunging
[13:36.560 --> 13:41.120]  crashing in flames on his big government takeover of health care on his eugenics
[13:41.120 --> 13:47.560]  care on his green taxes carbon taxes and so everything is dumped on van
[13:47.560 --> 13:54.200]  Jones national attention is given to him being an open communist admitting he
[13:54.200 --> 13:58.200]  wants to put you in work brigades and forced labor camps and and national
[13:58.200 --> 14:02.560]  compulsory service Obama's in deep trouble I mean his original press release
[14:02.560 --> 14:08.360]  the Department of Education told schools if you want federal funds you will show
[14:08.360 --> 14:15.920]  this video to the kids you will have him enlist them to help him and write
[14:15.920 --> 14:19.440]  letters to themselves about how they're in league with him it's fantasy world
[14:19.440 --> 14:24.640]  it's like a little kid imagining he's Harry Potter or Luke Skywalker or
[14:24.640 --> 14:28.400]  Aragorn you know fighting Lord of the Rings it's make-believe they want to
[14:28.400 --> 14:32.920]  address little kids where he tells him he has a relationship with them that's
[14:32.920 --> 14:39.040]  the point that's what Stalin asked or hit Larry in and right out of 1984 not oh
[14:39.040 --> 14:42.920]  the president just wants to address the nation he harangues the country every day
[14:42.920 --> 14:47.080]  and press conferences and events and speeches they show him constantly in
[14:47.080 --> 14:51.040]  school they showed as inauguration they're trying to make him a messianic
[14:51.040 --> 14:55.120]  leader to push him on the public and then they knew it would also have a
[14:55.120 --> 14:58.840]  percentage of the public that become divided and don't want their kids to see
[14:58.840 --> 15:08.760]  it and then they can say what's wrong we just want the president to be there so
[15:08.760 --> 15:14.320]  I'm gonna cover all that at the end of the show today in detail and and and
[15:14.320 --> 15:18.640]  break down what's really happening and go over some of the actual clips of
[15:18.640 --> 15:23.880]  Obama calling for youth for graves Ron Emanuel Van Jones and explain how they
[15:23.880 --> 15:28.680]  are trying to couple that unpopular agenda of the greenhouse gas tax and
[15:28.680 --> 15:35.360]  all of that to 9-11 truth showing 9-11 truth is powerful and is growing and is
[15:35.360 --> 15:39.400]  hurting the establishment because now everybody knows that government stage
[15:39.400 --> 15:42.520]  terror and even if somebody doesn't completely believe that 9-11 was an
[15:42.520 --> 15:46.280]  inside job they think about false flag terror now and they know about
[15:46.280 --> 15:50.440]  Operation Ajax Gulf of Tonkin Ming stage they know about Cheney it being
[15:50.440 --> 15:53.800]  declassified wanting to stage terror attacks and so it means they have
[15:53.800 --> 15:59.560]  trouble staging terror attacks now and getting political power out of it because
[15:59.560 --> 16:07.920]  the public is wise and their DHS report came out documenting that veterans gun
[16:07.920 --> 16:11.560]  owners conservatives libertarians people that don't want to vaccinate people
[16:11.560 --> 16:14.920]  that are against abortion people that are against the private federal reserve
[16:14.920 --> 16:18.600]  that we're all terrorist the people now know the whole secret police system has
[16:18.600 --> 16:28.880]  been set up for us so they're aware of all of this and that's what the flu is
[16:28.880 --> 16:33.440]  the flu is the false flag that isn't openly stage terror that can be
[16:33.440 --> 16:38.080]  worldwide at the UN can run that makes everybody guilty until proven innocent
[16:38.080 --> 16:40.560]  and now the quarantines are being announced it's all happening we're
[16:40.560 --> 16:44.160]  going to break in a moment coming back for the rest of the hour with dr Leonard
[16:44.160 --> 16:48.360]  Horowitz one of the main leading authorities on this somebody I really
[16:48.360 --> 16:53.280]  respect we're gonna have him with us coming up in the next segment I wanted
[16:53.280 --> 16:56.040]  to bring Ted Anderson up on a separate issue for about three minutes before we
[16:56.040 --> 17:02.040]  go to break here before we go to dr Horowitz and that's Ted Anderson Ted
[17:02.040 --> 17:05.120]  told you a month ago to buy gold when he was selling it at nine hundred and five
[17:05.120 --> 17:09.240]  dollars an ounce he still has gold he bought at nine hundred and five nine
[17:09.240 --> 17:17.960]  hundred and eleven nine hundred and fourteen nine hundred and fifteen and nine hundred and sixteen and silver he bought at fourteen it's now above sixteen he
[17:17.960 --> 17:22.160]  can still sell you the gold and silver but this is the absolute end but he told
[17:22.160 --> 17:26.720]  me he sold out of a lot of coins at that price yesterday he has a few left in
[17:26.720 --> 17:31.720]  silver and gold at the price when gold was roughly eighty dollars an ounce less
[17:31.720 --> 17:36.200]  than it is now in silver was up to two dollars less than it is now you cannot
[17:36.200 --> 17:39.920]  beat this deal anymore tell me got two minutes briefly tell folks the coins
[17:39.920 --> 17:45.320]  you've got left most of it sold out and the deal you've got for people now yeah
[17:45.320 --> 17:49.320]  real fast I'll let you know what went up first the Franks one from two hundred and
[17:49.320 --> 17:53.880]  sixteen to two thirty three the British sovereigns one from that two hundred and
[17:53.880 --> 17:57.680]  I can't remember is like two hundred twenty two hundred anyways are two eighty
[17:57.680 --> 18:03.200]  eight right now the Lakota Nation coin went from that nineteen seventy now
[18:03.200 --> 18:07.120]  they're twenty two thirty the two coins that I have left right now they're still
[18:07.120 --> 18:11.760]  priced at the same price that they were yesterday are the walking Liberty halves
[18:11.760 --> 18:15.120]  which are currently right now at eight sixty nine which is the same thing that
[18:15.120 --> 18:19.360]  I was offering when silver was down at that thirteen dollar level and then the
[18:19.360 --> 18:24.400]  ten dollar Liberty right now I have it eight hundred and eighteen fifty which
[18:24.400 --> 18:28.400]  is the same price that it was the other day as well so if you want to get
[18:28.400 --> 18:31.480]  involved in something with gold or silver there still are some things that are
[18:31.480 --> 18:37.760]  left on behind gold is up today gold one that gold one up to nine ninety five
[18:37.760 --> 18:42.520]  seventy already today sixteen twenty eight silver so that I want to be clear
[18:42.520 --> 18:47.320]  though Ted Ted I want to be clear here you bought gold back when it was nine
[18:47.320 --> 18:51.320]  hundred and five nine hundred and fifteen you pass those savings on that sold
[18:51.320 --> 18:56.600]  out but you'd made other purchases when gold was what nine twenty nine thirty five
[18:56.600 --> 19:02.360]  silver was fourteen something so the deals you've still got are how many thirty
[19:02.360 --> 19:06.920]  forty fifty dollars lower than the market they're certainly priced closer to
[19:06.920 --> 19:10.640]  one hundred I suppose on the gold since gold is almost hitting a thousand right
[19:10.640 --> 19:15.800]  now and it was when gold is in the nine nine twenty nine fifteen range so I guess
[19:15.800 --> 19:19.200]  you could say eighty bucks when I'm asking you as the latest purchase you
[19:19.200 --> 19:23.120]  made when gold and silver was lower and you're passing those savings on when did
[19:23.120 --> 19:26.400]  you buy into gold in the market for the current prices you're selling well I
[19:26.400 --> 19:30.280] 've been cost averaging in between nine forty five and that nine thirteen level
[19:30.280 --> 19:34.360]  for about the past two three weeks right now okay so people at a nine forty so
[19:34.360 --> 19:37.880]  people are getting into a market at a nine forty level when it's at nine ninety
[19:37.880 --> 19:42.760]  three right now so it's still an insane savings eight hundred six eight six two
[19:42.760 --> 19:47.520]  two three seven get into gold now folks eight hundred six eight six two two three
[19:47.520 --> 19:51.240]  seven gold will quite likely breach one thousand an ounce of not today in the next
[19:51.240 --> 19:57.800]  few weeks CEO of metals consultancy firm gfms all walker said eight hundred six

[24:13.080 --> 24:18.800]  explaining what Kevin is talking about we bought gold at the 905 to 916 level
[24:18.800 --> 24:24.160]  he sold it all in the last few days when it was at the higher price for the
[24:24.160 --> 24:30.120]  lower price he's now got gold priced in 920 to 940 bought different groups of
[24:30.120 --> 24:33.600]  the different prices so that's what you're buying now is gold and silver
[24:33.600 --> 24:38.080]  still from the lower price while it's more now and he can hold that deal
[24:38.080 --> 24:45.880]  through the weekend so be sure and call 800-686-2237-800-686-2237
[24:45.880 --> 24:49.600]  okay this is a short segment long segment coming up but I want to go to
[24:49.600 --> 24:57.160]  Dr. Leonard Horowitz he of course is a Harvard degree expert in so many fields
[24:57.160 --> 25:01.280]  hold several doctorates as a former dentist and health industry
[25:01.280 --> 25:05.480]  entrepreneur and the author of a number of books pamphlets DVDs is just what
[25:05.480 --> 25:09.360]  Wikipedia is saying about him again a Harvard Harvard degree several other
[25:09.360 --> 25:14.440]  degrees and we really appreciate him coming on with us he's got a whole bunch
[25:14.440 --> 25:19.160]  of different websites one of them is Dr. Lynn Horowitz dot com tetrahedron
[25:19.160 --> 25:24.080]  dot org just a whole bunch of sites will give you before he leaves us today but
[25:24.080 --> 25:27.480]  we've got all these virologist and neurologist coming out Dr. Blalock's
[25:27.480 --> 25:31.920]  coming up later saying look these flu shots before have caused Gilean
[25:31.920 --> 25:37.480]  Bernays neurological degenerative diseases other flu vaccine trials in
[25:37.480 --> 25:42.960]  Europe have caused deaths with the bird flu the Gardasil the Dr. Horowitz three
[25:42.960 --> 25:47.600]  years ago said was deadly they now admit is deadly what's really going on with
[25:47.600 --> 25:51.640]  this Dr. Horowitz all the new big developments that are happening well
[25:51.640 --> 25:56.040]  number one the psychological operation which you know when you do such a great
[25:56.040 --> 26:00.680]  job Alex preparing people for what's really coming down here the poisoning
[26:00.680 --> 26:05.080]  particularly of squailing in the ingredients in these vaccinations is
[26:05.080 --> 26:12.800]  what's really the I think fundamental risk that they're promoting it heavily
[26:12.800 --> 26:17.200]  as safe there's no possible way they can do that because they're just now
[26:17.200 --> 26:21.280]  testing it so that means that they can't have safety testing for more than six
[26:21.280 --> 26:24.520]  weeks because they're planning it some people are getting it right now so it's
[26:24.520 --> 26:28.520]  really experimental and the toxic ingredients in these vaccines make it
[26:28.520 --> 26:32.800]  absolutely clear that this is a toxic soup and they're gonna have a lot of
[26:32.800 --> 26:38.560]  people sick because of it what I've read from the medical doctors out there
[26:38.560 --> 26:42.360]  that are looking at this is they're saying the the chemicals they put in it
[26:42.360 --> 26:50.600]  to trigger an autoimmune response is is causing many of the problems absolutely
[26:50.600 --> 26:54.120]  and you know when you look at the squaling first of all you see with the
[26:54.120 --> 26:57.720]  United States Congress when they investigated Gulf War syndrome said
[26:57.720 --> 27:03.560]  about it it was heavily implicated as being the premier factor causing the
[27:03.560 --> 27:08.200]  chronic fatigue immune dysfunction, fibromyalgia, the cancers associated with
[27:08.200 --> 27:12.640]  Gulf War syndrome so that's number one number two is if you read about it and
[27:12.640 --> 27:16.400]  you start to study what that active ingredient actually it's a passive
[27:16.400 --> 27:20.600]  ingredient the active ingredients are the foreign genetics the foreign proteins
[27:20.600 --> 27:26.720]  from the you know sources of the microbe so H1N1 God knows what else they're
[27:26.720 --> 27:31.680]  putting in there but the other aspect that's fascinating is if you go into the
[27:31.680 --> 27:37.040]  natural research natural healing alternative health care literature you
[27:37.040 --> 27:41.920]  find vitamin D is an outstanding preventative and squaling actually is
[27:41.920 --> 27:48.720]  engaged in the synthesis in the normal human body of vitamin D except that when
[27:48.720 --> 27:54.480]  you add a foreign oil and you foreign chemical because it's really a mass
[27:54.480 --> 27:58.560]  produced chemical the body then attacks it and now you can't get the vitamin D
[27:58.560 --> 28:03.920]  you need which is what stops you from down in the flu exactly and add to that
[28:03.920 --> 28:09.800]  the fact that this is associated this whole kind of oils that are associated
[28:09.800 --> 28:16.000]  with the synthesis of squaling in the body normal is associated with all of
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.680]  the oils that are very important the steroids associated with immunity so
[28:21.680 --> 28:26.080]  we're gonna whack out the human immune system big time with the swine flu
[28:26.080 --> 28:31.840]  vaccine and this is not just Dr. Horowitz Harvard Train saying this this is
[28:31.840 --> 28:37.120]  London Telegraph this is associated press but then they still call us
[28:37.120 --> 28:40.840]  conspiracy theorist Dr. Horowitz I want to break down the Psiop where you see
[28:40.840 --> 28:44.440]  this going in the fall what we know is in the five different vaccines the news
[28:44.440 --> 28:48.920]  is reporting one is a DNA therapy I don't quite understand that but why are
[28:48.920 --> 28:52.240]  they admitting in all these major government and industry studies now
[28:52.240 --> 28:57.040]  what you and others wrote over a decade ago that all of this juvenile onset and
[28:57.040 --> 29:01.320]  early onset of different types of arthritis they found in rats and guinea
[29:01.320 --> 29:05.400]  pigs he is caused by the vaccines what's going on there all right let me
[29:05.400 --> 29:09.680]  explain that to you and this really was what prompted me heavily to get involved
[29:09.680 --> 29:14.560]  in the vaccine risk awareness movement you know my mother died of Gillian
[29:14.560 --> 29:19.520]  Beret she was one of the victims of the swine flu vaccine back in the 70s and
[29:19.520 --> 29:25.920]  that when you look at what just came out a couple weeks ago in the prep not in
[29:25.920 --> 29:29.040]  the mainstream press at all was completely neglected well tell us stay
[29:29.040 --> 29:31.840]  there we're gonna come back and that's right remember first interviewing Dr.
[29:31.840 --> 29:36.760]  Horowitz like 13 years ago when he talked about his mother dying from the
[29:36.760 --> 29:41.600]  shot and now they're admitting this tens of thousands of people killed hundreds
[29:41.600 --> 29:46.600]  of thousands maimed and and why are all these children getting arthritis I
[29:46.600 --> 29:50.240]  mean it's just it's horrible stay with us doctor
[29:50.240 --> 29:57.120]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[30:12.320 --> 30:16.240]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water many of these chemicals are
[30:16.240 --> 30:19.840]  directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental system

[33:10.720 --> 33:18.480]  into a burning ring of fire I went down down down the flames went higher okay
[33:18.480 --> 33:26.560]  dr. Horowitz I want you to start back over with my question dealing with I
[33:26.560 --> 33:30.840]  remember you and many others publishing the medical findings and foreign
[33:30.840 --> 33:37.960]  studies about it causing all the massive onset of not just arthritis but all
[33:37.960 --> 33:42.120]  these other joint problems and then and then I'm going back from memory but you
[33:42.120 --> 33:46.120]  were saying was micro plasms and other autoimmune responses but but now you've
[33:46.120 --> 33:48.640]  been proven right that's now in all the medical literature they're now
[33:48.640 --> 33:52.480]  admitting it talk about incredible liability but I guess the government
[33:52.480 --> 33:55.880]  saying there's liability protection but continue with the wake up with them
[33:55.880 --> 34:02.160]  killing your mother well yes from Gillian beret and so last week what you had was
[34:02.160 --> 34:09.040]  there was a leak from a British press that there had been a secret notice sent
[34:09.040 --> 34:12.880]  out by the government the British government to physicians particularly
[34:12.880 --> 34:17.920]  neurologists to be aware that there's going to be a large increase in Gillian
[34:17.920 --> 34:23.360]  beret now that's just an example Gillian beret is one of numerous autoimmune
[34:23.360 --> 34:28.720]  diseases it's basically here's how all of them happen it's a great example and if
[34:28.720 --> 34:32.120]  you just understand this you'll never want to take another vaccine again in
[34:32.120 --> 34:37.440]  your life because when you get injected with not just squaling which is again
[34:37.440 --> 34:41.040]  it's not the active ingredient but it waxed out the immune system number one
[34:41.040 --> 34:46.200]  and on top of that you get injected with foreign RNA and foreign DNA and foreign
[34:46.200 --> 34:51.920]  protein from let's say in this case H1N1 that means now that these foreign
[34:51.920 --> 34:57.120]  proteins and genetic material is floating in your bloodstream it lands on
[34:57.120 --> 35:03.440]  your own host cell protein so it becomes what the immunologists call an
[35:03.440 --> 35:09.760]  antigenic complex and very few physicians know anything about this Alex
[35:09.760 --> 35:14.360]  that's a disgrace the fact of the matter is all of the the specialists know
[35:14.360 --> 35:18.720]  about it from the scientific literature what is an antigenic complex very
[35:18.720 --> 35:24.840]  simply it's a piece of your own and a piece of a foreign particle bacteria or
[35:24.840 --> 35:31.800]  viral in this case it's H1N1 protein or genetic material which then is causing
[35:31.800 --> 35:38.360]  your own white blood cell bodyguards to attack that complex it reads the
[35:38.360 --> 35:44.560]  sequence it then says to the rest of the lymphatic cells all the T cells your
[35:44.560 --> 35:49.360]  whole army of white blood cell bodyguards then gets alerted that says if
[35:49.360 --> 35:55.360]  you ever see this sequence attack and destroy it the problem is it's giving
[35:55.360 --> 36:01.360]  your own body parts part of the message of attack and destroy to itself so
[36:01.360 --> 36:06.880]  that's autoimmune it's self your number one God-given gift the immune system
[36:06.880 --> 36:12.520]  attacking and destroying you that's where all of these new plagues have come
[36:12.520 --> 36:18.360]  from chronic fatigue fibromyalgia lupus MS ALS and Lou Gehrig disease
[36:18.360 --> 36:23.960]  chronic crippling rheumatoid arthritis you mentioned diabetes adult type 1
[36:23.960 --> 36:27.880]  autoimmune diabetes exploding and Utah and it's in the government's own
[36:27.880 --> 36:33.480]  documents here's John P. Holdren saying we're gonna inject you with things that
[36:33.480 --> 36:39.480]  sterilize you but more than that they cold bloodedly know they're soft killing
[36:39.480 --> 36:45.360]  everybody the most expensive profitable way the most expensive for the
[36:45.360 --> 36:50.640]  consumer the most expensive for the nation for healthcare it is basically a
[36:50.640 --> 36:54.960]  genocide look at the definition of genocide genocide is strictly defined
[36:54.960 --> 36:59.920]  in Webster's dictionary as the mass killing or enslaving of people for
[36:59.920 --> 37:05.040]  profit politics and ideology in this case people are being enslaved to the
[37:05.040 --> 37:09.720]  chronic diseases that are most expensive to treat through the drugs this is a
[37:09.720 --> 37:14.280]  complete genocidal operation and what you're witnessing in the mainstream media
[37:14.280 --> 37:20.280]  is a psychological operation virtually a military operation to get people
[37:20.280 --> 37:27.080]  engaged in a biological warfare against humanity continue you were going
[37:27.080 --> 37:31.520]  through all the health problems it causes yeah so again Gillian Beret in my
[37:31.520 --> 37:36.000]  mother's case and this is what's so expected now again by the government of
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.720]  Britain tells its healthcare professionals the great news and I feel
[37:39.720 --> 37:45.680]  like we've won a major part of this battle half of the physicians in Hong
[37:45.680 --> 37:52.640]  Kong will not take this vaccine more than that in nurses in the UK more than
[37:52.640 --> 37:56.320]  that of nurses in New York State have already said that they're not going to
[37:56.320 --> 37:59.960]  take this because they're smart they understand like a disease like Gillian
[37:59.960 --> 38:04.960]  Beret what you've got is you've got your white blood cell bodyguards attacking
[38:04.960 --> 38:09.960]  the myelin sheet the connective tissue surrounding your nerve fibers so that
[38:09.960 --> 38:15.600]  your nerves degenerate and you no longer can do things like breathe this is
[38:15.600 --> 38:21.520]  exactly what my body starts eating your brainstem your yes your immune system
[38:21.520 --> 38:26.720]  destroys you that's essentially what this amount is so it is but you know
[38:26.720 --> 38:30.520]  look antibiotic you know this is why I love oxy sober because you're not
[38:30.520 --> 38:35.920]  dealing with antibiotic you're dealing with absolute pro everything you're
[38:35.920 --> 38:39.440]  dealing with the normal way that the body would want to protect itself
[38:39.440 --> 38:45.640]  everything from electromagnetically to biologically we have medical we've had
[38:45.640 --> 38:49.720]  medical doctors here that say they're really super nano silver certainly does
[38:49.720 --> 38:55.040]  double bacteria and viruses dr. Horowitz expanding on this it's in the
[38:55.040 --> 39:00.240]  literature they admit and doctors are telling their own families don't take
[39:00.240 --> 39:05.480]  it it can attack your brain cells attack your spine attack your entire body
[39:05.480 --> 39:12.040]  they brag that they put cancer viruses in the polio vaccines they admit their
[39:12.040 --> 39:17.560]  eugenicist politically how do you see this plan rolling out and let me give
[39:17.560 --> 39:22.440]  you one little little hint here or or or clue I'm sure you're already on this
[39:22.440 --> 39:27.560]  back in January we were saying they're gonna launch some type of flu fear
[39:27.560 --> 39:31.480]  mongering because we saw them getting ready with mass graves telling emergency
[39:31.480 --> 39:35.480]  managers get ready for millions dead that it wasn't a question of if but when
[39:35.480 --> 39:40.440]  it was going to happen this fall we went on air and said will it be bird flu
[39:40.440 --> 39:44.440]  will it be something else we don't know they're saying flu they're training that
[39:44.440 --> 39:48.800]  militias are going to try to attack and steal the flu supply this was going on
[39:48.800 --> 39:53.480]  in January in February in March before all this happened we know we've
[39:53.480 --> 39:57.320]  confirmed they've been running drills at colleges all over the country for the
[39:57.320 --> 40:02.400]  last eight nine months now accelerating for locking down colleges and the first
[40:02.400 --> 40:07.280]  place they're doing force quarantines is college dorms kind of is a propaganda
[40:07.280 --> 40:12.320]  psyop to show people the image of people locked down in their homes the UN
[40:12.320 --> 40:17.800]  admits they're running all of this under level six how do you see them trying to
[40:17.800 --> 40:22.880]  roll it out well that's a beautiful summary of the psychological operation
[40:22.880 --> 40:28.160]  and the genocidal agenda and that's exactly what also would indicate to any
[40:28.160 --> 40:33.680]  reasonably intelligent person that they've planned this long ago that they
[40:33.680 --> 40:38.760]  basically want to make this the profit total profitable this is the most
[40:38.760 --> 40:43.280]  profitable operation think about it you've got FEMA operating you've got the
[40:43.280 --> 40:48.120]  healthcare industry burgeoning you've got the pharmaceuticals being sold stock
[40:48.120 --> 40:53.600]  piled billions and billions of us see in essence they don't even have to do
[40:53.600 --> 40:57.720]  anything anymore they've already sold the stuff but the problem is they have a
[40:57.720 --> 41:02.880]  depopulation agenda they literally want to take out at least half maybe two
[41:02.880 --> 41:08.000]  thirds of the world's population so this is the great you know travesty it's
[41:08.000 --> 41:14.240]  total fascism it is absolutely despicable it from my perspective it has no
[41:14.240 --> 41:18.560]  semblance of being human there's no empathy there's no compassion there's no
[41:18.560 --> 41:25.640]  love and sensitivity and the future of our of our civilization our humanity is
[41:25.640 --> 41:30.760]  literally at stake because when you lose these types of not just chemicals that
[41:30.760 --> 41:35.040]  go into the groundwater everything from mercury and all the toxic waste the
[41:35.040 --> 41:39.160]  antibiotics I mean when you take anything when you take a vaccine the
[41:39.160 --> 41:42.600]  murky you're gonna ultimately if you're gonna get rid of it you're gonna pee it
[41:42.600 --> 41:47.240]  out if you're gonna take an antibiotic what goes in comes down and goes out
[41:47.240 --> 41:51.160]  into the groundwater we are water eighty percent of our bodies is watered the
[41:51.160 --> 41:55.040]  groundwater that we drink this has been on the news to so that these people are
[41:55.040 --> 42:00.720]  not like doing humanity or this planet a favor and that's why they make the joke
[42:00.720 --> 42:07.000]  in Dr. Strangelove saying your general Jack T. Ripper i.e. Curtis LeMay wanting
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.800]  to nuke the world if you're worried about your precious bodily fluids because
[42:10.800 --> 42:16.000]  the establishment is obsessed with putting toxins and poisons into us so
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.520]  we're psychologically spiritually clouded and drugged that's Pharmakia you
[42:22.520 --> 42:26.080]  know we have the sorcerers of the New World Order getting us drunk on their
[42:26.080 --> 42:29.880]  poison just like they'd get people drunk before they cut their hearts out in
[42:29.880 --> 42:34.200]  Chichen Itza at the Aztec pyramids now Dr. Horowitz you just said something and
[42:34.200 --> 42:37.920]  I want to go back over and have you expand on it and that's so it looks
[42:37.920 --> 42:42.160]  like we're concurring they've already won to a certain extent fear mongering
[42:42.160 --> 42:46.520]  bringing more federal control in worldwide expanding government control
[42:46.520 --> 42:50.920]  testing federalization having excuses to talk about four hundred thousand troops
[42:50.920 --> 42:57.120]  on the streets at North com as a beta test for future bio weapons releases and
[42:57.120 --> 43:02.880]  then the organizing of carrying out that event but we need to get the word out so
[43:02.880 --> 43:06.800]  they don't go hot with this flu and really wipe out a bunch of people now
[43:06.800 --> 43:11.360]  will will the soft kill weapons be in the in the flu vaccine or are they going
[43:11.360 --> 43:16.320]  to release something else and say that's the swine flu if they go really hot
[43:16.320 --> 43:19.880]  with this how do you see it unfolding how bad do you think this flu is going
[43:19.880 --> 43:25.000]  to be well if they went really hot with it and it is a high likelihood because
[43:25.000 --> 43:32.080]  they're going to have to you know not have a rerun of 1976 so basically there's
[43:32.080 --> 43:37.440]  a good possibility that aerosolized weaponry will be activated you may have
[43:37.440 --> 43:43.320]  the black helicopters that come around starts to spray and basically populations
[43:43.320 --> 43:48.880]  in let's say Los Angeles or highly at risk for this kind of thing around you
[43:48.880 --> 43:53.560]  know interestingly enough October the end of October early November if they
[43:53.560 --> 43:58.720]  play out the whole plan that they have the capability of doing that's what
[43:58.720 --> 44:02.920]  they'll end up doing they'll be spraying the population and then they will
[44:02.920 --> 44:07.760]  initiate the outbreaks that they're going to decree are horrific and then the
[44:07.760 --> 44:11.640]  mainstream media and that's really all they need in order to in every state of
[44:11.640 --> 44:16.040]  the nation persuade people to adopt the model state emergency health powers act
[44:16.040 --> 44:20.120]  at the end of that now you've got everybody incarcerated in FEMA camps
[44:20.120 --> 44:26.760]  most profitable most population controlling and most devastating but I
[44:26.760 --> 44:32.760]  always see them doing it in phases this is maybe in five six different phases
[44:32.760 --> 44:37.960]  we're into phase three now where they want to beta test kill up 20 30 40
[44:37.960 --> 44:42.440]  thousand 100 thousand scare everybody get everybody trained to do what they're
[44:42.440 --> 44:47.120]  told in the next phase when they kill 20 million and then after that the super
[44:47.120 --> 44:50.440]  mega death phase where they kill the majority of the world's population as
[44:50.440 --> 44:55.480]  the White House science chief is basically sworn to do that's exactly
[44:55.480 --> 44:59.160]  what the way I see it to from the psychological operation basically you
[44:59.160 --> 45:04.040]  know how you boil a frog is you know slowly and that's what they're doing
[45:04.040 --> 45:07.960]  here and that's exactly what you know you started with SARS you saw SARS as a
[45:07.960 --> 45:12.360]  complete psychological operation to get the world to understand that the world
[45:12.360 --> 45:16.240]  health organization and the Rockefeller family were going to be controlling all
[45:16.240 --> 45:21.120]  of the emergency response to the bio preparedness and so this is now you know
[45:21.120 --> 45:26.160]  a few years later they have advanced the exact agenda you're talking about and
[45:26.160 --> 45:31.960]  now people are prepared they're prepared for even the event that I've been
[45:31.960 --> 45:36.800]  talking about as potentially the hot hottest one that's how in answer to
[45:36.800 --> 45:41.280]  your question how the worst case scenario could be played out I would be
[45:41.280 --> 45:48.080]  looking at October or November end of October early November for somebody to
[45:48.080 --> 45:52.760]  lose something from some lab and ultimately that would then create a
[45:52.760 --> 46:00.360]  large media blitz and a lot of hospitalizations and that is going to
[46:00.360 --> 46:04.080]  cause the model state emergency health powers act to kick in and then the
[46:04.080 --> 46:08.760]  mandatory vaccinations the mandatory quarantine even though Barack Obama has
[46:08.760 --> 46:14.000]  said it's gonna be voluntary how many presidents can you trust he always lies
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.040]  if he came out and said it's gonna be mandatory then I would think it wouldn't
[46:18.040 --> 46:23.200]  be mandatory he always lies he always breaks his promises and under level
[46:23.200 --> 46:27.760]  six under the who they say they can force inoculate now they've got the
[46:27.760 --> 46:32.760]  states all passing the laws to force inoculate that's in the news so he has
[46:32.760 --> 46:36.640]  his surrogates out saying it's gonna be mandatory then he plays the part of the
[46:36.640 --> 46:40.440]  conciliator he's gonna make you feel good he's gonna pat you on the back on
[46:40.440 --> 46:44.400]  the conciliary he's gonna tell you everything's okay and notice he wants
[46:44.400 --> 46:50.400]  to address the kids starting next week every week the kids will be brought into
[46:50.400 --> 46:55.560]  jumbo screens and he's enlisting them to aid him and Rahm Emanuel saying a
[46:55.560 --> 47:01.080]  domestic force paramilitary Van Jones is saying that they're gonna use the
[47:01.080 --> 47:05.400]  green jobs to take over the entire economy and then media matters comes out
[47:05.400 --> 47:10.640]  and says I'm a liar there's no plan for compulsory service this is classic
[47:10.640 --> 47:15.120]  tyranny your comments on that other worlds you know Alex you're absolutely
[47:15.120 --> 47:19.280]  right you know you if evidence for what you're saying is very clear go to flu
[47:19.280 --> 47:26.560]  scam dot com it's the definitive website on this whole matter flu scam dot com
[47:26.560 --> 47:31.280]  there one of many documents including a pdf file from the World Health
[47:31.280 --> 47:36.120]  Organization actually laying out the agenda of exactly what you just talked
[47:36.120 --> 47:41.720]  about how they encourage all this bio preparedness this model state emergency
[47:41.720 --> 47:47.840]  health powers act functioning and ultimately they in they intimate that
[47:47.840 --> 47:55.680]  this is where we will have to go as this now pandemic expands into tyranny and
[47:55.680 --> 48:03.440]  this is the cover to get the unpopular eugenics healthcare passed this is the
[48:03.440 --> 48:07.480]  cover to get the whole bioethics system passed this is the cover to get the
[48:07.480 --> 48:11.040]  clean water restoration act total federalization of above and below ground
[48:11.040 --> 48:15.760]  water basically the entire united states is water under it this is the cover to
[48:15.760 --> 48:20.120]  pass the anti-gun bills the anti-free speech bills that openly say you have
[48:20.120 --> 48:24.520]  no more free speech this is the cover to pass the cyber security act we're
[48:24.520 --> 48:28.320]  quote the president can kill the internet to save the internet this is the
[48:28.320 --> 48:32.680]  cover for people to not worry about him expanding the war in Afghanistan and
[48:32.680 --> 48:37.920]  Pakistan they just announced I see this and now congressman brown paul and even
[48:37.920 --> 48:42.640]  army former republican leader has come out and said that so when you hear main
[48:42.640 --> 48:46.880]  line republicans like brown and army saying this is a cover for martial law
[48:46.880 --> 48:51.680]  you better know it's serious your comments on that dr. Horowitz yes and
[48:51.680 --> 48:55.840]  one additional thing that it's a cover for taking out people's access to the
[48:55.840 --> 49:00.080]  botanicals and the herbs and the natural healing remedies they completely
[49:00.080 --> 49:05.840]  hideously gross criminal negligence that's what they do are doing with this
[49:05.840 --> 49:10.240]  whole concept that you've got to get vaccinated and intoxicated in order to
[49:10.240 --> 49:14.800]  defend yourself against the swine flu there are so many wonderful natural
[49:14.800 --> 49:18.240]  healing methods that they should be telling people about but because it's a
[49:18.240 --> 49:23.480]  drug cartel influenced agenda essentially you've got no mention that is
[49:23.480 --> 49:27.720]  killing people that is gross criminal negligence in and of itself and it goes
[49:27.720 --> 49:32.920]  along with the codex element areas legislation where again this the fascism
[49:32.920 --> 49:38.040]  strangling people that's what they're about the amazing thing is they've
[49:38.040 --> 49:41.120]  introduced the anti-gun bills they've introduced the bills that ban speech it's
[49:41.120 --> 49:46.120]  passed the house they introduced bills to set up youth brigades and pass one

[54:09.600 --> 54:29.080]  Dr. Horowitz is going to be with us for this segment the next we got Dr. Russell
[54:29.080 --> 54:33.320]  Blalock neurologist brain surgeon coming up to back up everything Horowitz has
[54:33.320 --> 54:35.560]  been talking about her today in great detail
[54:35.560 --> 54:42.640]  Dr. Horowitz I had psychology today viciously savage me and they basically
[54:42.640 --> 54:47.080]  say I'm schizophrenic and imagined I was at a Bilderberg group meeting and
[54:47.080 --> 54:51.120]  imagined I was being followed it didn't matter if Secret Service was there it was
[54:51.120 --> 54:54.920]  on the news they they just say I'm completely it was having basically a
[54:54.920 --> 55:02.760]  complete psychotic hallucination like I was on you know a thousand milligrams of
[55:02.760 --> 55:09.840]  pure LSD this isn't gonna work anymore them just stonewalling and I think about
[55:09.840 --> 55:16.000]  psychiatrists psychologists the Nazis first use them the Soviets use them they
[55:16.000 --> 55:22.440]  say we're crazy they they always use the medical system as their tyranny the
[55:22.440 --> 55:26.400]  eugenics in this country the family courts were set up as you know to carry
[55:26.400 --> 55:29.880]  out eugenics and sterilization we still have these unconstitutional courts
[55:29.880 --> 55:34.200]  today that don't have due process and we have state officials here in Texas when
[55:34.200 --> 55:38.640]  they were asked why 69% of school kids foster kids are on psychotropic drugs
[55:38.640 --> 55:43.840]  they said well they have bad genes so this is really a murderous cult
[55:43.840 --> 55:48.440]  absolutely you know I would say congratulations to you you know both
[55:48.440 --> 55:53.040]  rights I know you know he's a friend of ours and you always say to me Len you
[55:53.040 --> 55:58.240]  know the flak never gets heavy until you're over the target and so if you're
[55:58.240 --> 56:03.600]  getting whacked by psychology today or all of us but you may all of us that
[56:03.600 --> 56:08.480]  the forefront and I'm so happy you have Russell playlock on coming up because
[56:08.480 --> 56:13.480]  again we're all getting whacked because we're over the target and so you know
[56:13.480 --> 56:18.200]  just keep it up Alex well thank you know that's a great analogy World War two
[56:18.200 --> 56:22.640]  I think Bo Gratz dad actually died over Germany and so that's why Bo likes that
[56:22.640 --> 56:26.800]  analogy but it certainly isn't when you're over the target that's when you
[56:26.800 --> 56:29.920]  are gonna be getting the flak and we are dropping the big truth bombs on them
[56:29.920 --> 56:34.000]  okay continuing how do you see them rolling this out I mean you think they're
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.640]  gonna go may go hot with it and be what do we do to get the word out to stop them
[56:38.640 --> 56:42.800]  I mean is there anything in your educated opinion we can do it it seems
[56:42.800 --> 56:46.720]  like they are losing some steam they're out having to tell us that oh yeah we
[56:46.720 --> 56:52.600]  think the vaccine safe well again it's really too with I wish I had a crystal
[56:52.600 --> 56:57.280]  ball you know but the reality is the worst-case scenario I've laid out the
[56:57.280 --> 57:03.200]  other least problematic scenario would be that they've already done the harm
[57:03.200 --> 57:08.240]  they've already purchased it they've stockpiled they've already brainwashed
[57:08.240 --> 57:13.400]  they've already gotten at least probably a third of the United States public to
[57:13.400 --> 57:18.560]  intend to roll up their sleeves the sheeple are gonna go back to the slaughter
[57:18.560 --> 57:24.040]  and they there they've got a victory they've got food for their pharmaceutical
[57:24.040 --> 57:28.520]  cartel they've got to have all these people sick they're gonna have it during
[57:28.520 --> 57:33.400]  the economic collapse they're gonna be well cared for financially and on top
[57:33.400 --> 57:36.520]  of that they're gonna be reducing a lot of the population which is their goal
[57:36.520 --> 57:40.120]  and it's gonna be soft killing them for a long time and you know with these
[57:40.120 --> 57:43.920]  soft-kill weapons guy only knows that they're now admitting the Kim trailing
[57:43.920 --> 57:48.640]  on the news who knows what we've already all of us had implanted in us yeah well
[57:48.640 --> 57:52.760]  certainly look at just the fact that the chemtrails have aluminum and aluminum
[57:52.760 --> 57:58.800]  heavy metal has a resonance frequency and it has its transmission attenuation
[57:58.800 --> 58:04.080]  capacity so you know for all we know and it's a very highly suspect because when
[58:04.080 --> 58:10.080]  you you look at vaccination mercury and you look at the decimation particularly
[58:10.080 --> 58:13.920]  of our children this autistic spectrum that they've been covering up and lying
[58:13.920 --> 58:19.080]  about you know you gotta see that these people are totally about population
[58:19.080 --> 58:24.240]  reduction population control and spiritual energetic suppression they just
[58:24.240 --> 58:28.520]  love the power trip that they write their textbooks how they're killing us and
[58:28.520 --> 58:36.520]  then they have John P. Holdren on David Letterman saying how great he is it's
[58:36.520 --> 58:40.240]  just it's just all a big sick joke to them stay with us

[1:00:28.400 --> 1:00:32.200]  the world's been talking about got a filmmaker shifting gears in the next
[1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:37.520]  50 minutes covering a host of issues with the film crude about what the oil
[1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:42.080]  companies are doing in Latin America harrowing tales coming up with the
[1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:47.360]  filmmaker Joe Bellinger but in the four or five minutes we have left with Dr.
[1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:52.040]  Lynn Horowitz flu scam.com is his website with links to it up at info
[1:00:52.040 --> 1:00:59.280]  wars.com Dr. Horowitz in closing we are beginning though to really have people
[1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:03.160]  listen to us and wake up and and that's the good news and so much of what you
[1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:07.840]  and others were alone voices in the wilderness we're talking about is now
[1:01:07.840 --> 1:01:13.160]  being validated and verified and vindicated but at the same time it
[1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:17.120]  seems like there's 30 40 50 percent of people that are kind of awake now but
[1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:21.840]  then that other half are getting deeper into denial and you we just see them
[1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:26.080]  dying and and people that are 10 years old with cancer everywhere and
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:30.080]  neighbors dying and young women dying everywhere and men dying and disease
[1:01:30.080 --> 1:01:33.560]  everywhere I mean this is a holocaust when the hell are people gonna really
[1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:38.600]  wake up and realize that psychopathic killers are running things you know I
[1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:43.360]  think that most of us who are intelligent have already awakened to that
[1:01:43.360 --> 1:01:48.280]  reality those who haven't there unfortunately they're going to be
[1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:53.080]  taken out and they're gonna be taken out most expensively you know I think
[1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:58.680]  that the opportunity that it currently exists if we marshal the half of us who
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:04.280]  have awakened to literally create a revolution in healthcare I think we
[1:02:04.280 --> 1:02:09.320]  could take this whole pharmaceutical cartel totally out I think people are
[1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:13.920]  fed up with it I think people see it I think what we need to do is boycott the
[1:02:13.920 --> 1:02:20.760]  organization and institutions and focus on exposing the criminals continue to
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:25.400]  do that but I think that the ultimate goal would be to establish a healthy
[1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:30.200]  world organization that literally has the power to overtake the world health
[1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:35.560]  organization and focus instead of on toxicity on all of the natural
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:40.520]  botanicals and herbs all of God's bounty that we've been naturally given to
[1:02:40.520 --> 1:02:45.640]  protect ourselves and to remedy all of the diseases I'm looking forward to a
[1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:49.720]  world Alex you know me I'm a humanitarian and a visionary and a
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:55.040]  positive thinker I'm looking forward to a world where we literally can lie down
[1:02:55.040 --> 1:03:00.240]  with the lamb we can exist with H1N1 H5N1 we could blow it out with
[1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:04.640]  right frequency generators we can eliminate all of the problems with the
[1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:09.000]  botanicals and the herbs the essential oils the homeopathic this is really
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:14.600]  where we should be and we would be just like we could drive around in cars that
[1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:19.760]  are running on on water with no pollution likewise we could take care of
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:27.360]  our bodies for minimal cost and absolute optimal efficacy well as this
[1:03:27.360 --> 1:03:35.240]  develops Dr. Horowitz will continue to check in with you and the bad things
[1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:38.680]  happen and I know it's sad what happened to your mother and we're very sorry for
[1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:42.000]  your loss but I think through that journey and that happening that caused
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:47.320]  you as a doctor to look into these things and then save potentially tens of
[1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:52.120]  millions of people and so sometimes bad things that happen turn into blessings
[1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:55.080]  in the end and we just really hope that everybody out there listening
[1:03:55.080 --> 1:04:00.360]  researches the claims and and looks at what we put out here so that their five
[1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:04.800]  year old isn't dying of cancer next year and and really realize that when we get

[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:49.880]  hung out a few years ago yeah for people that don't know about then I guess
[1:09:49.880 --> 1:09:54.040]  it's probably the first time that you've talked about or at least publicly that I
[1:09:54.040 --> 1:10:00.360]  know of three point plus million dollar budget biggest for Discovery Channel
[1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:05.560]  ever you're an award-winning top tier documentary maker with your partner you
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:10.280]  come out interview me for several of the episodes and tell folks what happened
[1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:18.720]  with that well we we had a series for Discovery called well I don't remember
[1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:22.760]  what our tribes of America was the name of the series and a woman named Jane
[1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:26.360]  Root who used to run the Discovery Network loved our work and hired us to do
[1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:31.040]  the series about different kind of subcultures in America and one of the
[1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:36.720]  subcultures we wanted to explore was the world of you and you know the clear
[1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:39.640]  eyes kind of news you like to deliver and we thought that would be an
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:45.400]  interesting show you know the so-called conspiracy theorists and obviously you
[1:10:45.400 --> 1:10:49.360]  know what you guys think of yourself I should I should include myself amongst
[1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:55.560]  them and and you know we did a great episode with you and a couple other
[1:10:55.560 --> 1:11:00.720]  people in your in your in your community you were of course the star of the show
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:04.360]  we did a number of other episodes on different you know different kinds of
[1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:09.600]  communities and at the 12th hour after three million dollars had been spent on
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:13.280]  television series the woman who hired us who was actually the head of the
[1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:19.040]  network ended up getting fired replaced by another guy named John Ford and of
[1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:24.440]  course as is typical in corporate America at these television places and I
[1:11:24.440 --> 1:11:29.320]  guess I'm biting the hand that feeds me but you know all the all the projects
[1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:33.160]  that this woman had greenlit were thrown out the door and a whole new set of
[1:11:33.160 --> 1:11:36.640]  programming was brought in but your project was shot very close to being
[1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:42.440]  done that's what you know we did an episode on on evangelical street
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:48.600]  preachers we did an episode on the New York Diamond community we did a episode
[1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:54.640]  actually the episode your episode was was called alternative radio and then
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:12:01.440]  one on robotics one on robotics one on this community in the desert
[1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:06.720]  you know it was so it's two years ago so I've been so involved in the Amazon it was
[1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:10.200]  carnage you know yeah we did it one on carnage and then we did one on this
[1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:14.160]  desert in this these bunker keep people people living in bunkers in the desert
[1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:20.960]  as a great series and it was 99% shot the money had been spent we were in the
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:26.560]  final phase of the post-production your show in particular was fantastic you
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:30.240]  know we spent some time together following you both down in Austin and
[1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:34.120]  that you know we want you the premiere of your work in progress of your last
[1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:38.480]  movie and then for 9-11 activities we followed you around in New York is
[1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:42.000]  really a great episode you were there when I got arrested and they they shoved
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.960]  Etienne with his $100,000 camera down for for no reason I mean this was
[1:12:45.960 --> 1:12:51.040]  intense yeah it was a great episode you know it's you know the whole series was
[1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:55.560]  this kind of cinema verite exploration of these different groups of people who
[1:12:55.560 --> 1:13:01.640]  aren't your traditional kind of citizen and you know at the 12th hour the show
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:06.680]  was cancelled and the stuff you know wasn't even aired and you know it I'd
[1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:09.840]  be the first one to say if the show's stunk you know I understand why they
[1:13:09.840 --> 1:13:13.680]  didn't air them but these were high-quality documentaries made by
[1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:18.760]  you know very good documentary makers and it's if they just fell victim to the
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:22.600]  usual thing you know like they'd rather waste three million dollars worth of
[1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:30.400]  production than the new guy airing this stuff and you know realizing they made
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:34.600]  a mistake in firing this person because the shows do well so we had that we had
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:39.240]  another TV series that they just buried called San Quentin Film School so these
[1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:45.440]  two projects that had originated with with this woman who since moved on and
[1:13:45.440 --> 1:13:51.840]  was fired the new regime just kind of just you know jettisoned all of this
[1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:55.440]  got back to Pentagon programming but also behind the scenes we were talking
[1:13:55.440 --> 1:13:59.440]  yeah because you really were doing a fair piece it make us look like angels it
[1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:02.880]  was what really happened yeah they came to you you said and said that they were
[1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:08.800]  trying to put you know would I debate a neocon would I and then even though you
[1:14:08.800 --> 1:14:13.600]  were talking with me about my god they really are trying to manipulate this
[1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:17.000]  then that wasn't even enough for them they just threw the whole thing in the
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:21.880]  fire yeah after you know it's one thing to cancel a show or cancel a series you
[1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:27.120]  know at the development stage or at the early stage where a show is not yet
[1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:32.120]  shot but here you have literally three million dollars worth of production you
[1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:38.080]  think they'd at least air at some odd hour just at least get them economic
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:42.760]  value out of this is like a boarding a 17-year-old right when you're about to
[1:14:42.760 --> 1:14:46.200]  get him out of the house exactly exactly so very heartbreaking I was
[1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:51.920]  particularly disappointed with with with with your episode being cancelled
[1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:55.640]  because I thought that was a lot of fun it was very interesting you know I'm
[1:14:55.640 --> 1:15:00.400]  forget who is the guy is it ramps Jeff ramp that is yeah yeah rents rent yeah
[1:15:00.400 --> 1:15:04.040]  he was he was profiled and another guy was profiled but you were kind of a
[1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:07.640]  star of the of the episode and the stuff we shot of you in New York getting
[1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:11.520]  arrested was was priceless yeah it was well I know you're here to talk about
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:16.600]  crude yeah tell us first why it's opening now where people can see it in
[1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:22.400]  what city's amazing cinematography yeah really serious stuff yeah no it's a
[1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:26.840]  it's a film that kind of changed my life and really opened my eyes up to some
[1:15:26.840 --> 1:15:34.480]  fundamental truth shot over a three-year period in the rainforest of
[1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:41.000]  Ecuador it you know if you go to our website www.crudethemovie.com you'll

[1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:24.760]  Q&A or something yeah I'm gonna be done with my film fall the Republic by then
[1:16:24.760 --> 1:16:29.480]  it'll be getting a print up on DVD so I'll kind of be over the hump and I
[1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:35.240]  would love Joe to come see you again and I'm just watching clips of the film
[1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:40.160]  reminding me how well this film is done I mean this this looks like film but it
[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:45.640]  was shot I guess in HD yeah we use these little HD cameras and you know the
[1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:49.320]  technology is so good you get a really nice look and and actually for the
[1:16:49.320 --> 1:16:53.520]  theatrical release we ended up transferring it to 35 millimeter you
[1:16:53.520 --> 1:16:57.560]  know for theaters and I'm surprised at how great it looks it really held up
[1:16:57.560 --> 1:17:01.920]  nicely you know there's beautiful light down there that that of course helped
[1:17:01.920 --> 1:17:05.920]  and that beautiful light kind of you know put a spotlight on the disgusting
[1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:14.280]  and horrible pollution that the that is the subject of the film and Canada had
[1:17:14.280 --> 1:17:18.560]  roughly 15% higher wages than us so most of their industry came down here in the
[1:17:18.560 --> 1:17:25.560]  70s and 80s NAFTA and GATT lowered the Mexican standard and the United States
[1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:30.480]  standard that's clear now I mean most of Michigan looks like a third world war
[1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:37.680]  zone and now as they continue the free quote fair trade the race the bottom we
[1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:40.480]  need to look at what's going on in Ecuador and Mexico because that's how
[1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:44.520]  we're going to be living now or something closer to it and your film
[1:17:44.520 --> 1:17:47.880]  investigates that and you had to worry about kidnappings you had to have armed
[1:17:47.880 --> 1:17:53.960]  guards I mean this was a journey into hearts of darkness Joe so when we come
[1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:57.840]  back let's get into it but but let's I mean let's start with the film and and
[1:17:57.840 --> 1:18:00.960]  some of the adventures and then some of the back story some of the things we
[1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:04.960]  won't see in the film okay that was good start go ahead and start telling us
[1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:07.960]  about it oh I thought you were queuing up for a commercial break now I'm saying
[1:18:07.960 --> 1:18:11.200]  we are coming we got a few minutes go ahead okay well you know I mean basically
[1:18:11.200 --> 1:18:16.000]  you know I went I'll just talk about how I got started you know I kind of got
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:19.520]  dragged into this film kicking and screaming you know the lawyer on behalf
[1:18:19.520 --> 1:18:25.680]  of these 30,000 plaintiffs which are rainforest dwellers indigenous people
[1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:29.680]  came to me and told me about this pollution and said you got to make a
[1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:34.560]  film about it it sounded preposterous I couldn't believe that what he was
[1:18:34.560 --> 1:18:38.000]  telling me was true but I went down and looked at it for myself and there I saw
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:44.320]  an area the size of Rhode Island a 1700 square mile swath of the Amazon
[1:18:44.320 --> 1:18:50.240]  rainforest completely despoiled through oil production you know for 30 years
[1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:54.960]  Texaco drilled oil and when you when you drill for oil and the oil comes up
[1:18:54.960 --> 1:19:01.360]  out of the ground you have to separate what's called formation water from the
[1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:05.640]  marketable crude the crude goes off the market and then this water is which is
[1:19:05.640 --> 1:19:09.960]  filled with toxins that supposed to be re-injected back into the well cavity
[1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:14.320]  instead for 30 years they just pumped it into the rivers and streams that feed
[1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:19.760]  the Amazon River that also has been the home of these five and well actually
[1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:23.680]  six indigenous tribes one of them has since become extinct but the five
[1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:27.640]  indigenous tribes that are actually part of this lawsuit this was their backyard
[1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:34.600]  and there are now skyrocketing rates of cancer leukemia childhoods you know
[1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:38.680]  15 out of 20 children that are born of these terrible skin rashes I mean it's
[1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:44.200]  just unbelievable and in addition to releasing this toxic water directly into
[1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:47.680]  the rivers and streams that feed the Amazon River you know hundreds and
[1:19:47.680 --> 1:19:53.360]  hundreds of these giant online pits were carved out of the jungle and a lot of
[1:19:53.360 --> 1:19:58.480]  oily talk Joe Barlinger stay there let's come back and talk about this on the
[1:19:58.480 --> 1:20:03.360]  other side the new film is crude e-cigarettes national calm would like
[1:20:03.360 --> 1:20:07.880]  to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners
[1:20:07.880 --> 1:20:12.920]  it's called the e-cigarette it looks feels tastes and delivers nicotine like
[1:20:12.920 --> 1:20:17.200]  a regular cigarette but because this is not a cigarette you don't have to worry

[1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:42.560]  organizations how you can see it how you can get involved now I want to
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:47.400]  get into what's happening to these native peoples there but also just the
[1:24:47.400 --> 1:24:50.880]  adventure of being down there yeah I mean are you worried about the oil companies
[1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:53.800]  coming after you they do whatever they want in Latin America yeah well that
[1:24:53.800 --> 1:24:57.480]  when I was down there I was I was very nervous I you know I did not make my
[1:24:57.480 --> 1:25:03.240]  presence known luckily there were a lot of NGOs like Amazon watch monitoring the
[1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:09.600]  trial to make sure it took place and so I just kind of you know had small
[1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:13.440]  cameras on a very small crew and did a lot of the shooting myself so I just
[1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:18.600]  kind of slipped in with the local media and the local not the local but the NGO
[1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:24.600]  people and I did not go and knock on doors and get interviews I was just there
[1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:28.880]  to film the trial because you know first of all we were a mile and a half from
[1:25:28.880 --> 1:25:32.880]  the Colombian border at times where the FARC in that particular part of
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:38.120]  Colombia and Ecuador where the FARC the guerrilla anti-government guerrillas are
[1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:43.160]  very active and they you know kidnap Americans for ransom so that worried me
[1:25:43.160 --> 1:25:48.920]  there was also an area where the drug runners were very active so you know when
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:53.320]  I checked into my hotel in quotation marks my hotel in the little this little
[1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:59.120]  jungle wild west town you know on my first trip I mean I literally would step
[1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:01.960]  through a crime scene because somebody had just been murdered in front of the
[1:26:01.960 --> 1:26:09.240]  hotel so I was a little nervous you know it was a far less cushy than my my
[1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:12.680]  previous assignment of hanging out with a heavy metal band for three years on the
[1:26:12.680 --> 1:26:17.840]  Metallica film I mean I was it was also a malaria zone so we were covered head to
[1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:22.960]  toe with jungle gear and slathering ourselves up with industrial strength
[1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:28.040]  deep spray to keep the mosquitoes at bay sounds hellish it was terrible
[1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:32.480]  actually I mean it was it was 120 degree equatorial heat you know because
[1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:36.200]  you're right at the equator and the worst thing is you're standing in front of
[1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:41.960]  these massive pollution sites the giant jungle pits you know cut out of the
[1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:47.680]  jungle filled with tar and petroleum and you know you holding a camera in this
[1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:52.760]  kind of heat and you know by the end of the day I had a massive headache you
[1:26:52.760 --> 1:26:57.800]  know it's funny the first the first trip down that my doctor advised me to take
[1:26:57.800 --> 1:27:03.560]  Mal around which is a which is a anti-malarial preventative medication
[1:27:03.560 --> 1:27:08.880]  because you know the CDC indicates that this is a malaria zone and that stuff
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:15.840]  made me psychotic man I had my the first second night in this hotel I felt like
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:22.200]  I was having my martin sheen apocalypse now hotel room moment because it was
[1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:26.920]  making me want to jump out the window by the way one squadron is I'm sure you
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:30.680]  know of Delta Force came home from Afghanistan on that yeah and three
[1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:34.640]  groups killed their families the other guy killed himself so yeah that stuff's
[1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:40.440]  got to be taken off the mark oh without question you know I mean it it it made
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:47.160]  me really queasy you know really I was literally grabbing my bed and just
[1:27:47.160 --> 1:27:51.200]  praying that I'd get through the night so subsequent shoes I stopped taking the
[1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:55.720]  Mal around and just wore heavy clothing and covered myself up with you know the
[1:27:55.720 --> 1:28:00.240]  best bug spray money could buy you know so it's not an easy assignment and then
[1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:03.920]  you add to it the emotional toll I mean you're talking to native people whose
[1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:08.320]  lives have been destroyed you know this was a cultural genocide and they've
[1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:12.920]  been poisoned you know there's no there's no drinking water anywhere you
[1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:16.240]  walk around these these villages I mean the thing that really made me want to
[1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:20.760]  make the film as you know is you know I'm my first scouting mission I got out
[1:28:20.760 --> 1:28:24.680]  of the canoe that you know we're taking a canoe down to one of these so the
[1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:28.800]  Kofan people you know you know proud people have lived there for millennia
[1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:33.440]  who live off the water I use the water to bathe at the drink you know in this
[1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:36.600]  country we take it for granny go to the tap there's water but this is a place
[1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:40.000]  where the water has been completely polluted and these are people who you
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:44.560]  know use the water for everything transportation bathing drinking and I
[1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:47.600]  got out of the canoe and these people you know deep in the heart of the Amazon
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:53.040]  rainforest we're you know preparing a meal using industrial tuna you know the
[1:28:53.040 --> 1:28:57.960]  kind of can tuna that you might get at Costco or something you know or a big
[1:28:57.960 --> 1:29:02.240]  restaurant supply company you know from another part of the world deep in the
[1:29:02.240 --> 1:29:05.640]  heart of the rainforest you know these people were eating tuna because the
[1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:10.400]  fish in the river were either dead or or deformed and that kind of just you know
[1:29:10.400 --> 1:29:14.920]  was a real wake-up call for me about how you know I'm not smart enough to
[1:29:14.920 --> 1:29:19.960]  figure out whether Chevron should win or lose this trial you know as you'll see
[1:29:19.960 --> 1:29:24.720]  in the film they've wrapped themselves up in enough legal arguments that who
[1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:28.760]  knows I you know who knows if the justice system can prevail but from a
[1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:33.680]  moral standpoint it's just uh it's just astounding that they would that they
[1:29:33.680 --> 1:29:38.280]  would go into the backyard of these people and and and foul the place up and
[1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:41.400]  you walk around these indigenous villages and what broke breaks your

[1:35:30.480 --> 1:35:35.120]  and ask the operators questions about combos discounts different films some
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:40.520]  of my documentaries are as inexpensive as $5.95 per DVD so again check that out
[1:35:40.520 --> 1:35:50.560]  P.O. Box 19549 Austin Texas 78760 okay going back to Joe Berlinger and the film
[1:35:50.560 --> 1:35:57.880]  crude the real price of oil where again I want to get off the oil system it's
[1:35:57.880 --> 1:36:01.600]  been great for us but it has all this toxic waste associated with it the
[1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:06.920]  greenhouse gas carbon tax thing is a red herring in my research opinion to put
[1:36:06.920 --> 1:36:11.240]  a tax on carbon dioxide instead of going after that's why all companies are now
[1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:15.000]  behind the greenhouse gas it gets them off the hook for the cracking of the
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:19.240]  oil the refining of the oil the extracting it Joe you you went down to
[1:36:19.240 --> 1:36:25.960]  Ecuador 25 times I mean that is just yeoman's work in this malaria infested
[1:36:25.960 --> 1:36:33.560]  equatorial region third world with you know kidnappings and police state you
[1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:36.840]  said to me asking questions you've got the floor let's talk more about why
[1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:41.360]  there's toxic waste what this toxic waste is what's happening down there
[1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:46.640]  where all this is going yeah and let me just say you know I I agree that we
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:50.320]  should be thinking about more than thinking about moving towards alternative
[1:36:50.320 --> 1:36:56.440]  energy for a host of reasons but this film is not an anti-oil film it's an
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:37:00.440]  anti-corporate your responsibility film I mean I'd be a hypocrite right now to
[1:37:00.440 --> 1:37:04.200]  be making an anti-oil film because you know I fly to film festivals on
[1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:08.200]  airplanes I heat my house with oil I drive a car you know we're all kind of
[1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:13.520]  stuck in this system until until it changes but it's an anti-corporate
[1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:17.200]  your responsibility film you know there's responsible ways of drilling for
[1:37:17.200 --> 1:37:21.760]  oil and irresponsible ways of drilling for oil and what happened in the jungle
[1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:25.800]  down there you know texaco we know we use texaco and chevron
[1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:30.200]  interchangeably just to explain to the audience but you know the operator and
[1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:36.400]  the and the and the and the perpetrator of of what I'm talking about is the
[1:37:36.400 --> 1:37:40.400]  texaco petroleum company which was purchased by chevron you know they
[1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:45.440]  merged in 2001 so with that chevron inherited the lawsuit so sometimes I
[1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:50.080]  think texaco sometimes they say chevron it's you know so they're the same at
[1:37:50.080 --> 1:37:55.680]  this point but texaco discovered oil in the 60s down in this Amazon rainforest
[1:37:55.680 --> 1:38:01.560]  this pristine jungle environment in fact you know they say that one of the few
[1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:07.640]  places on earth that survived the last ice age was the Ecuadorian part of the
[1:38:07.640 --> 1:38:11.080]  Amazon rainforest you know most of the Amazon rainforests in Brazil but the
[1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:17.840]  headwaters of the Amazon begin in Ecuador and the Ecuadorian part of the
[1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:22.440]  rainforest they say is one of the few places on earth that survived the last
[1:38:22.440 --> 1:38:27.480]  ice age and therefore that is the reason it has such incredible you know
[1:38:27.480 --> 1:38:32.280]  biodiversity over a quarter of the world species are in this little part of it's
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:37.000]  super ancient for those that don't know the ice age hasn't run over it killing
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:41.080]  whatever was originally there or displacing it this is one of the most
[1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:46.480]  ancient places on earth where you have a continually developing system is what
[1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:50.760]  you're saying exactly and of course it barely has survived now the last 40
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:55.120]  years of oil production because of the way in which it was done you know
[1:38:55.120 --> 1:39:00.360]  texaco discovered oil came in they set up a consortium with the government you
[1:39:00.360 --> 1:39:04.960]  know the government is not blameless in this situation but texaco was you know
[1:39:04.960 --> 1:39:09.760]  created and operated the system that as the plaintiff say was designed to pollute
[1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:15.840]  basically there were three levels of pollution down there the first and most
[1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:21.640]  insidious level of pollution is that when the crude oil comes up from the
[1:39:21.640 --> 1:39:26.840]  ground where it's been you know you know hanging out at a bump beneath the earth
[1:39:26.840 --> 1:39:31.920]  surface for millions of years it's mixed with water that water is called
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:38.400]  formation water because it's been mixed in with the crude for you know eon there's
[1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:43.080]  a process of separation where the marketable crude is separated out from
[1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:48.400]  the water the marketable crude goes by pipeline to a port and it's sent off so
[1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:52.880]  that we can go get it refined and have lots of gasoline in this country the
[1:39:52.880 --> 1:39:57.440]  water is supposed to be the standard operating practice of the day although
[1:39:57.440 --> 1:40:01.560]  chevron will claim otherwise the standard operating practice of the day is to
[1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:08.440]  re-inject that water into dormant wells so that it goes back into the earth out
[1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:13.520]  of the you know way below the water table that's an expensive process
[1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:18.280]  relatively speaking so the planning but I mean here in Texas a lot of oil
[1:40:18.280 --> 1:40:24.560]  industry if any of that gets into the water table it's a huge lawsuit huge event
[1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:28.440]  absolutely if any of this stuff happened in the United States these people would
[1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:32.840]  be in jail is my opinion you know Chevron disputes that and claims
[1:40:32.840 --> 1:40:36.320]  otherwise they clean other one of the problems with this case is that the court
[1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:40.080]  has been overwhelmed with paper and disinformation and misinformation and
[1:40:40.080 --> 1:40:43.280]  counterclaims your head will spin like you said you're not a petroleum
[1:40:43.280 --> 1:40:49.400]  geologist yeah I'm not a chemist but watching the film we've been playing
[1:40:49.400 --> 1:40:53.600]  clips of it here in the background you're by a river and you see the oil and the
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:57.720]  gasoline the shininess where the people are bathing and drinking it's coming by
[1:40:57.720 --> 1:41:03.240]  you see the black oil pouring out into the water you see I mean that they
[1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:09.040]  clearly yeah yeah so let me just just over the listeners understand though
[1:41:09.040 --> 1:41:14.000]  so the oil you know the water and the oil are separated in this separation
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.080]  process oil goes off to market the water is supposed to be re-injected into
[1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:22.760]  these into these wells instead it was literally pumped into the rivers and
[1:41:22.760 --> 1:41:27.680]  streams that feed the Amazon River that are also the home to it used to be
[1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:32.320]  six indigenous tribes now it's five indigenous tribes and these people just
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:35.720]  drink the water and didn't know better and in fact we heard stories I can't
[1:41:35.720 --> 1:41:40.040]  verify it though it was not included in the film but we heard stories that
[1:41:40.040 --> 1:41:44.680]  actually the early oil development people actually told the locals that
[1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:49.360]  that formation water was dumb you know had vitamins and minerals and was good
[1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:52.880]  for you I mean are these people didn't know better they trusted the you know
[1:41:52.880 --> 1:41:56.760]  they had never had never had contact with white people until about 40 years
[1:41:56.760 --> 1:42:01.520]  ago you know and again I'm not I just want to hell they tell us that sodium
[1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:05.240]  fluoride that's a catch y'all for hundreds of chemicals we've got a tour of
[1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:09.720]  the Austin facility it's hundreds of chemicals they put from the byproduct of
[1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:14.280]  fertilizer manufacturing in our water so they tell us it's minerals that's true
[1:42:14.280 --> 1:42:19.040]  that's true you know so that with the so one level of pollution was just the
[1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:22.840]  direct piping for three decades of formation water the other level of
[1:42:22.840 --> 1:42:27.000]  pollution is that they carved out of the jungle unlined and they will claim
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:31.680]  it's blind because the jungle clay is not permeable you know we saw evidence the
[1:42:31.680 --> 1:42:37.560]  contrary they they carved these giant unlined pits when a well is first dug
[1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:42.960]  the initial stuff that comes up is just full of it's just kind of a toxic soup
[1:42:42.960 --> 1:42:49.480]  of stuff that gets dumped into these into these pits and then whenever they do
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:52.680]  maintenance on the wells more stuff gets dumped into these pits and these
[1:42:52.680 --> 1:42:56.800]  pits are so you know it's not unusual to have pits but they're supposed to be
[1:42:56.800 --> 1:43:01.400]  cleaned up and these pits were just left in the jungle and what was a little
[1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:05.440]  unusual in the jungle version of these pits is that because it rains so much in
[1:43:05.440 --> 1:43:10.000]  the Amazon rain forest that's why it's called the rain forest these pits would
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:15.760]  overflow from rain so they installed these gooseneck pipes that allowed the
[1:43:15.760 --> 1:43:21.800]  rain water which then has been mixing with the petroleum to you know leach into
[1:43:21.800 --> 1:43:29.040]  the well to go right into the rivers and streams and then the third level of
[1:43:29.040 --> 1:43:34.480]  pollution which is not their fault but because this is standard in oil
[1:43:34.480 --> 1:43:37.720]  production that's one of the reasons oil production is just the besty business
[1:43:37.720 --> 1:43:44.920]  the other byproduct of oil production is natural gas that if is not
[1:43:44.920 --> 1:43:49.000]  brought to market often in these kinds of reasons where it's difficult to bring
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:52.640]  it to the market they just burn it off that's why at oil production facilities
[1:43:52.640 --> 1:43:56.920]  you see a flare going off so imagine in the jungle thousands of these flares
[1:43:56.920 --> 1:44:03.000]  adding to a black rain environment to an already assaulted environment that was
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:06.240]  once pristine I mean it just it breaks your heart walking around these
[1:44:06.240 --> 1:44:13.480]  villages you know these these these these Amazonian Indians who you know had had a
[1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:20.080]  very nice lifestyle you know in harmony with nature for millennia you know we
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:25.240]  force these people into a quasi-western lifestyle by virtue of the fact that we
[1:44:25.240 --> 1:44:28.520]  take away their traditional means of sustenance there that you know the animal
[1:44:28.520 --> 1:44:32.400]  stocks are depleted from the pollution the fish and the river are dead well I
[1:44:32.400 --> 1:44:36.880]  think that's the key here is that you're saying they know now because the people
[1:44:36.880 --> 1:44:40.480]  are putting an act on they would still eat the fish but you're saying they
[1:44:40.480 --> 1:44:44.280]  won't eat the fish now well they they they have to they'd be that's the sad
[1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:46.960]  thing is these people you know looking into mother's eyes knowing that they're
[1:44:46.960 --> 1:44:50.800]  giving their children poison this water because there's no other water nobody
[1:44:50.800 --> 1:44:54.920]  has come to the aid of these people you know they whatever fish they can get
[1:44:54.920 --> 1:44:58.400]  they eat it but you know it's a primitive area with no infrastructure and
[1:44:58.400 --> 1:45:03.760]  they're just drinking the water right out of the streams and rivers that are
[1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:09.640]  just a mile or less away from all these toxic chemicals being dumped I mean I
[1:45:09.640 --> 1:45:13.400]  know enough about the oil industry just growing up and around here in Texas that
[1:45:13.400 --> 1:45:18.920]  they're not following any of the same procedures or rules in Ecuador just just
[1:45:18.920 --> 1:45:24.080]  looking what's on the video this is just outrageous there was Chevron Chevron claims
[1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:27.440]  that they were following the standards of the day and that they cleaned up their
[1:45:27.440 --> 1:45:35.480]  math and that any math is due to the fact that they turned over the operation
[1:45:35.480 --> 1:45:39.280]  to the state-run oil company called Petro Ecuador and it is true that Petro
[1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:43.560]  Ecuador you know Texaco left in 92 they didn't get a renewal of their life
[1:45:43.560 --> 1:45:48.600]  their concession from the government they split they turned this polluting
[1:45:48.600 --> 1:45:52.640]  system over to the state-run oil company called Petro Ecuador and one of the
[1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:56.560]  complicating factors of the case and one of Chevron you know legal points is
[1:45:56.560 --> 1:46:02.240]  that Petro Ecuador continued to pollute for a number of well until today there
[1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:06.480]  they've gotten their act cleaned up a little bit you know so Chevron points
[1:46:06.480 --> 1:46:11.360]  the finger at Petro Ecuador but you know that is kind of obfuscating the
[1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:17.480]  original issue which is in 93 this lawsuit was originally filed in the United
[1:46:17.480 --> 1:46:21.800]  States shortly after their departure because everyone saw that there was a
[1:46:21.800 --> 1:46:27.200]  polluted mess there well I want to be clear on the show I exposed the whole
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:33.600]  greenhouse gas tax system written up by Enron is clearly a fraud but then people
[1:46:33.600 --> 1:46:36.440]  get confused and say well wait you're not for the environment no I don't want
[1:46:36.440 --> 1:46:41.120]  my children drinking toxic waste in the water breathing poisons in the air
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:46.160]  eating GMO foods and the evidence is all of that is bad and hurting all of us
[1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:50.960]  and this is something clearly in the film and the stories that we see around
[1:46:50.960 --> 1:46:55.480]  the world where if we demand change we will get it and it looks like that the
[1:46:55.480 --> 1:46:58.800]  pressure you and others have put on them is starting to have some effect now
[1:46:58.800 --> 1:47:04.920]  that the state-owned oil monopoly is starting to clean up its act because I
[1:47:04.920 --> 1:47:10.080]  mean he goes back to the jungle you know the book written over a hundred years
[1:47:10.080 --> 1:47:15.160]  ago about people falling into the sausage machines and the coal plants not
[1:47:15.160 --> 1:47:19.120]  having scrubbers and you know all the toxic waste here there is good things
[1:47:19.120 --> 1:47:23.840]  about environmentalism we've done that we need to do and continue to do the
[1:47:23.840 --> 1:47:27.840]  problem is you have all these opportunists and NGOs coupling their
[1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:33.480]  agenda of just getting control of the economy to this so it's kind of like
[1:47:33.480 --> 1:47:36.680]  getting the mafia for help and you end up with something even worse so it's a
[1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:43.240]  very sophisticated situation from my point of view but Joe I know that you
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:47.560]  have been offered top documentaries TV shows and you have done a lot of those
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:51.840]  and I know traveling down there 25 times and spending year after year of
[1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:57.280]  several years on this film that I know you're just hoping to even get your
[1:47:57.280 --> 1:48:01.680]  investment back is a great social investment you've made and I really
[1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:06.400]  respect you for what you've done because this is a film that most people
[1:48:06.400 --> 1:48:10.000]  wouldn't have the courage on multiple fronts being down there in that hell
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:14.200]  hole and also dealing with the oil companies so I really do commend your
[1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:19.000]  courage thank you it was you know it was I went down on this initial scouting
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:22.440]  mission and I just was embarrassed to be an American if it were true that an
[1:48:22.440 --> 1:48:25.920]  American company whether it was legal or not whether they protected themselves
[1:48:25.920 --> 1:48:31.440]  through legal you know releases as they claim and all sorts of whatever things
[1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:38.480]  that are beyond my training you know what you know legal or not to me what
[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:43.800]  what has been done in this region but I feel is morally bankrupt and you know
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:48.600]  when I went back to my nice home in in New York and you know tucked my two
[1:48:48.600 --> 1:48:52.680]  children in in their separate bedrooms and turned on my tap and had a you know
[1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:56.480]  drink of relatively clean water I just felt like how could I turn my back on
[1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:01.120]  these people who have been screwed over you know by the system in a way that
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:07.320]  people can't even believe unless you go down there and look at the place you had
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:10.840]  to have armed guards while you were there because of the kidnapping or because
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:14.560]  of threats why we didn't we didn't really have armed guards I don't know
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:19.240]  where maybe that's where you got that from I was watching some of the video
[1:49:19.240 --> 1:49:22.840]  but I mean you had a bodyguard with you correct those were sold I mean there
[1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:25.920]  were lots of soldiers there I mean we didn't I didn't have armed guards or
[1:49:25.920 --> 1:49:29.560]  I don't want to call attention to I mean we were very nervous and there were
[1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:34.200]  some occasions where we were followed and our hotel room was ran around back
[1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:40.200]  the on one occasion you know I can't tell you if that was local punks local
[1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:44.240]  drug runners local affiliates of the oil company I mean I tried to fly way
[1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:48.280]  below the radar and I felt like if I came with armed guards okay I must have
[1:49:48.280 --> 1:49:51.920]  gotten confused there was a big military presence there maybe you were
[1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:54.840]  talking about getting armed guards a couple years ago when I was talking to
[1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:58.720]  you that's possible that's possible but I decided not I decided not to call
[1:49:58.720 --> 1:50:03.280]  attention to myself because I just wanted to get this thing in the can under
[1:50:03.280 --> 1:50:08.680]  the radar and then deal you know deal with it later absolutely chicanery is
[1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:12.760]  the use of tricks to deceive someone you lose to extract money from them I
[1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:17.440]  think that's a good definition I want to come back and play the trailer audio for
[1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:20.920]  the radio listeners video for prisonplanet.tv viewers right now of
[1:50:20.920 --> 1:50:28.760]  the film and it's up on the site crudethemovie.com now the only problem
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:32.200]  with playing the audio for listeners is we're not going to see the Spanish
[1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:37.280]  translation that's okay we have a big Spanish audience only two minutes long

[1:54:53.800 --> 1:54:58.200]  links up on infowars.com you know I said I'd play the trailer but he's right a lot
[1:54:58.200 --> 1:55:04.000]  of it's in Spanish and subtitles so just go to the site and you can you can see
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:10.160]  it right there them ladling the toxic chemicals right out of the and burning
[1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:14.480]  down the rainforest and I guess they also had a lot of oil fires down there too
[1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:20.040]  Joe. I mean it's just you know legal not legal I'm not smart enough to figure out
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:23.840]  all that stuff but it's certainly immoral I think to go into a region like
[1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:29.640]  that and and just to spoil it I mean I mean we also heard horrible stories of
[1:55:29.640 --> 1:55:33.000]  oil workers raping the local women stuff that I didn't include in the film
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:37.200]  because we couldn't verify it but even if even if even if it's a quarter true I
[1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:41.280]  mean but some of the stories I heard you know made made the hairs stand up
[1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:47.880]  basically a Wild West free-for-all a Wild West with this colonial arrogant
[1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:51.320]  prejudice towards indigenous people that's really why I made the film you
[1:55:51.320 --> 1:55:54.880]  know we were talking between the break that you know I did find some money for
[1:55:54.880 --> 1:55:58.800]  this but a lot of it was paid for by myself and then initially I was just
[1:55:58.800 --> 1:56:03.360]  paying for it myself because I just was angry and upset that that and it was
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:11.320]  like this I felt guilty for being white you know there was a you know for 600
[1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:15.000]  years we've you know white people have treated indigenous people horribly
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:18.480]  including how we started this own country you know we all know somewhere in the
[1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:23.640]  back of our heads that the Denny's over there used to be a Cherokee village like
[1:56:23.640 --> 1:56:27.640]  a real Cherokee village not not something at Disneyland and you know I
[1:56:27.640 --> 1:56:31.640]  used to kind of just think about it from time to time and think oh well that's
[1:56:31.640 --> 1:56:35.840]  in the way that's in the distant past but the reality is multinational
[1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:40.680]  behavior in the in these third world countries yeah it's just the modern day
[1:56:40.680 --> 1:56:44.400]  continuation of this terrible but Joe I mean I agree with you but I think it's
[1:56:44.400 --> 1:56:49.360]  more than just white any powerful empire whether it was the Japanese or
[1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:53.720]  whoever or the Aztecs they end up abusing the weaker group and this
[1:56:53.720 --> 1:56:58.000]  multinational system is doing bad things to us in America whether we're black
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:02.920]  white Hispanic Asian but certainly if we allow this to happen down there it
[1:57:02.920 --> 1:57:07.040]  could certainly go on here and that's why I salute you for making the film
[1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:13.920]  crude and I'll definitely try to come to the event when you are here in Austin
[1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:17.960]  in fact I had that little card here in my hand when is it when is it coming to
[1:57:17.960 --> 1:57:24.560]  Austin October 9th at the Adobe October 9th at the Adobe and it's running for a
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:29.200]  few weeks I think here in Austin yes unfortunately just for a week you know
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:32.720]  this is the type of movie that unless people show up that first weekend it's
[1:57:32.720 --> 1:57:38.880]  gonna die a quick death you know it's not you know people like entertainment so

[1:58:54.600 --> 1:58:58.280]  solar power generator this summer number one new climate legislation could
[1:58:58.280 --> 1:59:02.160]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:59:02.160 --> 1:59:06.240]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:59:06.240 --> 1:59:09.960]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:59:09.960 --> 1:59:14.280]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:59:14.280 --> 1:59:17.600]  dangerously overloaded especially with the high-demand summer months ahead
[1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:21.560]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every

[2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:08.920]  create an autoimmune response why they why the government's having to admit now
[2:02:08.920 --> 2:02:17.440]  in rats causing neurodegenerative diseases causing all sorts of joint
[2:02:17.440 --> 2:02:24.920]  problems early onset of just all sorts of problems Dr. Blalock is going to go
[2:02:24.920 --> 2:02:30.040]  over that today but also then what's happening with the excitotoxins what's
[2:02:30.040 --> 2:02:35.640]  happening with MSG what's happening with aspartame and why he believes this is
[2:02:35.640 --> 2:02:41.400]  going on so Dr. Russell Blalock with us today to go over this in great detail and
[2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:48.720]  take your phone calls Dr. Blalock thanks for being here do we have Dr. Blalock
[2:02:48.720 --> 2:02:57.160]  there we may have lost his line we've been having some phone systems go up and
[2:02:57.160 --> 2:03:04.560]  down today so we will we will get the network to call him if we need to just
[2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:09.520]  give the number to Genesis we'll do it that way they're over there fiddling with
[2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:17.880]  the phone system so this is important I mean this is really going on and now we
[2:03:17.880 --> 2:03:25.840]  have the medical report that has been put out internally leaked out of the CDC
[2:03:25.840 --> 2:03:31.680]  here in the US and the British Medical System in England that it's causing
[2:03:31.680 --> 2:03:36.840]  these degenerative brain diseases Dr. Blalock sorry we lost you there I was
[2:03:36.840 --> 2:03:41.600]  I was bringing up we're about to go to break but I was bringing up these
[2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:45.280]  internal reports have now been leaked saying exactly what you've said years
[2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:52.800]  ago that these vaccines are causing all sorts of brain disorders right well you
[2:03:52.800 --> 2:03:58.600]  know what we're looking at now because of the new discovery of self-viruses this
[2:03:58.600 --> 2:04:02.240]  could be much greater than we know because a lot of these neurological
[2:04:02.240 --> 2:04:07.680]  disorders are more immediate but the self-viruses are the hidden viruses in
[2:04:07.680 --> 2:04:13.480]  vaccine to cause neurological disease decades later which really makes it
[2:04:13.480 --> 2:04:17.040]  difficult to make that positive connection and that's sort of what they
[2:04:17.040 --> 2:04:22.520]  depend on it that the connection or to make went through that with the excited
[2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:28.600]  talk to food because it's different than at the time of exposure and parents of
[2:04:28.600 --> 2:04:34.120]  the neurologic disorder but we have much better evidence now than we had before
[2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:38.360]  okay we're gonna go break long segment coming up I'm gonna try to just sit back
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:46.080]  and have you go through not just the viruses and RNA in these vaccines but
[2:04:46.080 --> 2:04:50.880]  what is the mercury doing what is the squalene doing why do we see massive
[2:04:50.880 --> 2:04:55.120]  increases in all sorts of different diseases in the literature being
[2:04:55.120 --> 2:05:00.440]  associated with the vaccines with Dr. Russell Blalock please stay with us
[2:05:00.440 --> 2:05:04.880]  hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions if you're going
[2:05:04.880 --> 2:05:09.040]  into a battle and they give you a rifle in a sidearm how much ammunition do you
[2:05:09.040 --> 2:05:13.880]  want my answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of
[2:05:13.880 --> 2:05:18.080]  your loved ones food is your only ammunition how much do you want when
[2:05:18.080 --> 2:05:22.600]  do you want it now or after the battle starts when will you need it can you buy
[2:05:22.600 --> 2:05:26.160]  it without proper identification will there be any food will it make your
[2:05:26.160 --> 2:05:30.040]  children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself will you go
[2:05:30.040 --> 2:05:34.320]  to the gathering center and be immunized you wipe out all these problems if you
[2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:38.880]  have a good food supply food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and
[2:05:38.880 --> 2:05:43.480]  your life how much will you need we don't know how much do you want all you can

[2:06:06.840 --> 2:06:10.880]  recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor they found that
[2:06:10.880 --> 2:06:15.360]  over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water many
[2:06:15.360 --> 2:06:18.960]  of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and
[2:06:18.960 --> 2:06:22.720]  developmental system diseases now what are you going to do about it the

[2:08:13.080 --> 2:08:20.600]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:08:20.600 --> 2:08:27.880]  alex jones okay dr. Russell Blalock has just joined us for stations that just
[2:08:27.880 --> 2:08:33.840]  tuned in our listeners Blalock report.com he is a brain surgeon neurologist
[2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:39.520]  for decades speaking out against vaccines causing degenerative diseases I had
[2:08:39.520 --> 2:08:45.560]  dr. Horowitz on earlier whose mother was killed by this Gillian Bernay or
[2:08:45.560 --> 2:08:51.920]  Moray where the body has an autoimmune response and first eating the the the
[2:08:51.920 --> 2:09:00.120]  nerves the media is admitting that it can kill you the media is now having to
[2:09:00.120 --> 2:09:06.520]  admit that Gardasil's killing people dr. Blalock why do the vaccines attack the
[2:09:06.520 --> 2:09:13.720]  nerves in the body well just the the vaccine itself the trick that they're
[2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:17.880]  always or the problem they're always dealing with is trying to make the body
[2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:24.640]  react to the the agent that you want to immunize against blue trying to get the
[2:09:24.640 --> 2:09:30.160]  body to react intensely enough to give you immunity for a long period of time
[2:09:30.160 --> 2:09:37.560]  whether the whole basis of vaccination is unphysiological almost all the
[2:09:37.560 --> 2:09:42.800]  infections that enter the body go through either the nasal passages or the
[2:09:42.800 --> 2:09:49.720]  geotrack well that's where 80% of your immune system exists and it's designed
[2:09:49.720 --> 2:09:54.840]  to have the first exposure to these agents and it's all carefully
[2:09:54.840 --> 2:09:58.680]  coordinated well what you're doing with a vaccine you're bypassing that
[2:09:58.680 --> 2:10:04.960]  injecting it into deep muscle tissue which is completely an abnormal entrance
[2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:10.160]  for this organism and so you get an abnormal immune reaction particularly
[2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:14.320]  in children small babies you get a very abnormal reaction and that's been well
[2:10:14.320 --> 2:10:19.920]  documented in the scientific literature but in order to try to make your body
[2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:24.960]  react the ad was called immune adjuvant to it now these are various chemicals
[2:10:24.960 --> 2:10:30.600]  that cause your body to have a very intense immune reaction some of the
[2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:36.120]  the only adjuvant approved the United States is aluminum compound primarily
[2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:44.040]  alum they put that in there to make your immune system react and to cause the
[2:10:44.040 --> 2:10:49.720]  immune system to interact with the agent itself for instance these mumps
[2:10:49.720 --> 2:10:56.560]  well whatever the problem that we have is many foals the aluminum not only
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:11:01.400]  produces an abnormal intense immune reaction that's prolonged but the
[2:11:01.400 --> 2:11:06.680]  aluminum itself diffuses out into the body including the brain and accumulates
[2:11:06.680 --> 2:11:11.680]  and it stays there for a lifetime so each time you get a vaccination you're
[2:11:11.680 --> 2:11:17.680]  getting a dose of aluminum now the proof of that was done by a study in which
[2:11:17.680 --> 2:11:23.000]  they put a radioactive tag on the aluminum that was in a vaccine that's
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:28.320]  given to people and they injected it and traced it to see where it go and they
[2:11:28.320 --> 2:11:33.120]  found out it disseminated all over the body but also the brain well that was a
[2:11:33.120 --> 2:11:38.640]  single vaccine today children are getting about 40 some odd vaccines before
[2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:46.000]  they start school well that's at least 35 36 vaccines with aluminum in it so
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:50.880]  they're getting 36 time the amount of aluminum that was in that study and all
[2:11:50.880 --> 2:11:55.160]  of that goes to the brain over a lifetime they're talking about giving
[2:11:55.160 --> 2:12:01.680]  people as many as 200 250 vaccine sir is that why just interrupting Dr.
[2:12:01.680 --> 2:12:06.440]  Blaylock is that why I see the studies where you get a doubling or a tripling
[2:12:06.440 --> 2:12:11.120]  depending on what study I look at on people above 60 that get three or more
[2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:18.240]  flu shots of Alzheimer's well yeah yeah because not only does for instance the
[2:12:18.240 --> 2:12:23.680]  flu vaccine not only will it contain the aluminum but also contain a full dose
[2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:27.880]  of mercury and we know that mercury and aluminum interact in the brain and
[2:12:27.880 --> 2:12:32.840]  produce the rather intense the destructive reaction and that the
[2:12:32.840 --> 2:12:37.520]  aluminum mercury stay in the brain for decades it's not a lifetime very
[2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:42.320]  difficult to move and that while it's in the brain it changes into a much more
[2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:49.120]  toxic form of mercury the ionic mark all of this has been proven of the
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:54.080]  neuroscience literature problem is people giving the vaccine that is your
[2:12:54.080 --> 2:12:59.280]  family doctor your your intern is pediatrician they're not aware of any
[2:12:59.280 --> 2:13:02.720]  of this literature they don't read these things they just read a pamphlet that
[2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:08.520]  comes the CDC or from there yeah that's what's crazy is that I can be at a
[2:13:08.520 --> 2:13:12.680]  family event talking to somebody in my family who's a pediatrician and I'll
[2:13:12.680 --> 2:13:17.040]  go well I read the studies put out by major university where it increases
[2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:21.160]  Alzheimer's to take the vaccines and and I have this study that Gardasil's
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:25.560]  killing people and I have this study that in all the rat species they give
[2:13:25.560 --> 2:13:34.520]  vaccines they see massive increases in really debilitating arthritis and that
[2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:38.560]  these chemicals that are causing autoimmune response are burning out
[2:13:38.560 --> 2:13:42.000]  all these different and they're like well you're not a doctor and I'm like
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:47.040]  I'm not a doctor I'm saying the doctors are saying this and they they look at me
[2:13:47.040 --> 2:13:52.320]  like I'm crazy right well you know the first thing you have to realize is that
[2:13:52.320 --> 2:13:57.760]  when physicians go to medical school when I went to medical school there was
[2:13:57.760 --> 2:14:04.520]  virtually no instruction so vaccine you took a two-week immunology course you
[2:14:04.520 --> 2:14:08.960]  know they're pretty intense but it was just two weeks long and that was your
[2:14:08.960 --> 2:14:13.240]  exposure to the immunology part of the head any time to learn about the
[2:14:13.240 --> 2:14:19.080]  intricacies of vaccine I doubt that there's much more instruction today you
[2:14:19.080 --> 2:14:24.000]  learn a lot about the mechanism of reaction but you're not taught about
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:30.640]  vaccines so position generally don't know a lot about it and they're not
[2:14:30.640 --> 2:14:34.560]  going to the scientific literature researching these things looking at
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:39.680]  these things and the vast majority of physicians know absolutely nothing
[2:14:39.680 --> 2:14:46.920]  about neuroscience and so when you start talking about microglia being activated
[2:14:46.920 --> 2:14:52.800]  in the site of toxicity and reaction and the brain they really don't know what
[2:14:52.800 --> 2:14:57.360]  you're talking about you know that's not their special thing sir I'm not a
[2:14:57.360 --> 2:15:04.680]  doctor but I know if I eat a big bag of Doritos with MSG in it I get a headache
[2:15:04.680 --> 2:15:09.440]  an hour later and before I ever heard this stuff was bad I start by the time
[2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:14.480]  I was a teenager I started avoiding MSG not I didn't even know what MSG was I
[2:15:14.480 --> 2:15:20.480]  just knew don't eat Chinese food don't eat Doritos right well you and millions
[2:15:20.480 --> 2:15:25.280]  of others made that observation while the physicians were denying it and for
[2:15:25.280 --> 2:15:29.360]  decades all the big journals in the Journal of Medicine was denying there
[2:15:29.360 --> 2:15:33.560]  was any such thing as the Chinese restaurant syndrome well now it's
[2:15:33.560 --> 2:15:38.120]  proven beyond all doubt and we know that these exposures produce certain
[2:15:38.120 --> 2:15:44.480]  structures of brain connection to the exact mechanism of what it does for
[2:15:44.480 --> 2:15:49.400]  decades they deny that the bona fide glutamate enters the brain well now we
[2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:54.120]  have absolutely proof it does enter the brain and produces these changes
[2:15:54.120 --> 2:16:00.880]  particularly at the young during the most intense brain formation one of the
[2:16:00.880 --> 2:16:07.720]  effects of repeated intense vaginomation is that it activates these cells in the
[2:16:07.720 --> 2:16:12.120]  brain that release glutamate in high concentration producing the same effect
[2:16:12.120 --> 2:16:16.600]  but even worse because there's an interaction of the immune reaction at
[2:16:16.600 --> 2:16:20.720]  the brain with the excited toxicity that's something that I coined the term
[2:16:20.720 --> 2:16:26.920]  immunoexcitability which is now the medical literature and this is a major
[2:16:26.920 --> 2:16:30.480]  mechanism for most your neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's
[2:16:30.480 --> 2:16:35.360]  Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's and Guillain-Barre and all of these things that
[2:16:35.360 --> 2:16:39.760]  we're now hearing about well the interesting thing is the number of
[2:16:39.760 --> 2:16:46.760]  immunologic autoimmune diseases has increased virtually exploded the
[2:16:46.760 --> 2:16:51.960]  immunologists are all in a quandary is trying to figure out why what has
[2:16:51.960 --> 2:16:57.920]  happened in the last 30 years that's triggered this incredible increase in
[2:16:57.920 --> 2:17:02.440]  every type of autoimmune disease particularly those affecting the brain
[2:17:02.440 --> 2:17:06.520]  well they've toyed with environmental factors they said well there must be
[2:17:06.520 --> 2:17:13.280]  chemicals in the air or exposure to nanoparticles of diesel fuel everything
[2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:17.680]  but the most obvious which is vaccine the number of vaccines in the last 30
[2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:23.000]  years has increased just astronomical because they can't point the finger back
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:28.680]  at me look at these medical journals and and reports half the ads are drug ads
[2:17:28.680 --> 2:17:33.160]  and vaccine ads but as this is ravaging their own families well but I know you're
[2:17:33.160 --> 2:17:38.880]  a brain scientist a brain surgeon a neurologist but why why is it linked to
[2:17:38.880 --> 2:17:43.200]  the diabetes in the literature why is it linked I mean conclusively from what
[2:17:43.200 --> 2:17:48.360]  I've seen other medical doctors we've had on to you know teenagers and young
[2:17:48.360 --> 2:17:54.520]  people getting really serious disorders of the joints and the arthritis I mean
[2:17:54.520 --> 2:17:59.080]  how is it doing that well it's the same autoimmune type reaction rather the
[2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:05.280]  brain is attacking the cartilage in the joint and it's attacking the the beta
[2:18:05.280 --> 2:18:11.320]  cells of the pancreas producing diabetes and it's autoimmune reaction at the
[2:18:11.320 --> 2:18:15.520]  lung due to asthma so all of these different diseases we know that are
[2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:22.720]  linked to these abnormal immune reactions are being connected to this
[2:18:22.720 --> 2:18:29.240]  immunization program in the countries that have periodically outlawed certain
[2:18:29.240 --> 2:18:36.960]  vaccines the incidence of type 1 diabetes asthma has fallen precipitously so we
[2:18:36.960 --> 2:18:42.280]  have very good circumstantial evidence of the connection to the vaccine policy
[2:18:42.280 --> 2:18:46.640]  the problem is as you say they're advertising and all the medical journals
[2:18:46.640 --> 2:18:51.960]  they contribute huge amounts of money for medical education for the medical
[2:18:51.960 --> 2:18:57.760]  school they whine and dine residents and interns I'm talking about for them to
[2:18:57.760 --> 2:19:03.760]  come like her so there's so much financial influence and financial
[2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:08.480]  influence throughout the media because they're heavy advertising on all the
[2:19:08.480 --> 2:19:14.800]  media that you can't get this story out despite the fact you have overwhelming
[2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:18.840]  hard scientific evidence of this happening it's just like vaccine
[2:19:18.840 --> 2:19:24.280]  contamination that is so well demonstrated yet we just can't get
[2:19:24.280 --> 2:19:30.240]  that story out except through programs like yours which is telling the people
[2:19:30.240 --> 2:19:36.960]  from the scientists and the scientific study what we're seeing virtually every
[2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:41.960]  vaccine is contaminated and the scary thing is contaminated with agents that
[2:19:41.960 --> 2:19:47.520]  could produce cancer and neurological diseases as long as through a three
[2:19:47.520 --> 2:19:52.880]  decades after it even be transmitted to girl all right doctor stay there that

[2:23:53.000 --> 2:24:21.160]  prisonplanet.tv we're gonna continue discussing what dr. blalock is
[2:24:21.160 --> 2:24:27.440]  documenting here what the vaccines what the excitotoxins that are in our foods
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:32.320]  are doing what's in our water what the fluoride is doing and then why he
[2:24:32.320 --> 2:24:36.040]  believes they're doing and he has massive evidence about the eugenics and I
[2:24:36.040 --> 2:24:39.640]  just really appreciate dr. blalock spending time with us the website is
[2:24:39.640 --> 2:24:45.400]  blalockreport.com blalockreport.com a bunch of invaluable papers and
[2:24:45.400 --> 2:24:50.560]  documents and articles and books available and a special reports you can
[2:24:50.560 --> 2:24:55.680]  sign up for I mean this guy's the real deal and you know again I was reading
[2:24:55.680 --> 2:24:59.760]  stuff he wrote 10 15 years ago as he was saying is now in the major medical
[2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:05.080]  journals the terms he invented dr. blalock you were starting this is a
[2:25:05.080 --> 2:25:09.720]  short segment long one coming up to get into the contamination of vaccines not
[2:25:09.720 --> 2:25:13.320]  just what they're putting in there that you and others have proven is very bad
[2:25:13.320 --> 2:25:18.680]  and causing autoimmune responses and toxicity and other problems but what
[2:25:18.680 --> 2:25:22.680]  happens in the manufacturing of it and that a lot of these vaccines are grown
[2:25:22.680 --> 2:25:30.680]  on fetal retinas and caterpillar eggs and all sorts of other weird stuff well
[2:25:30.680 --> 2:25:37.400]  yeah you know in order to grow a virus you have to have living tissue the
[2:25:37.400 --> 2:25:43.960]  classic tissue was monkey kidney tissue reaches monkey was the beginning and
[2:25:43.960 --> 2:25:48.560]  then they use the African green monkey and now they use other types of cells but
[2:25:48.560 --> 2:25:52.400]  all of these cells if they're living they're contaminated with other
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:59.240]  organisms and they have inserted in their DNA carcinogenic viruses they have
[2:25:59.240 --> 2:26:03.600]  mycoplasma and a number of studies in which they took just bottles of
[2:26:03.600 --> 2:26:09.920]  vaccines used for humans found a contamination rate varying between 30%
[2:26:09.920 --> 2:26:17.360]  and 60% for well-recognized organisms and you have to realize that these the
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:24.200]  kidney cells are contaminated with thousands of viruses in which it's
[2:26:24.200 --> 2:26:28.640]  never been identified so unless you're looking for a specific virus you're
[2:26:28.640 --> 2:26:33.080]  not going to find it we know that some of these viruses take a long time to
[2:26:33.080 --> 2:26:38.480]  culture out you have to culture for months to get this virus out and one of
[2:26:38.480 --> 2:26:45.720]  the more recently recognized thing is the stealth virus which does not cannot be
[2:26:45.720 --> 2:26:50.560]  determined the usual detection mechanism it takes a very complicated process to
[2:26:50.560 --> 2:26:55.600]  make these viruses show themselves but the stealth viruses are being connected
[2:26:55.600 --> 2:27:01.120]  very strongly with cancer neurodegenerative diseases and a number of
[2:27:01.120 --> 2:27:07.680]  diseases that can come on decades after being exposed to them through the
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:16.080]  vaccine so that the potential of serious disease associated with vaccines is just
[2:27:16.080 --> 2:27:20.220]  enormous now they have conferences on this all the time but most of the
[2:27:20.220 --> 2:27:25.040]  conferences are closed or they they don't invite the media they never
[2:27:25.040 --> 2:27:30.280]  release the results of this to the media and sometimes you'll see it in the
[2:27:30.280 --> 2:27:36.120]  science magazine for instance like science or nature and one conference I
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:41.000]  read about said that they admitted that most of the vaccines were
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:46.400]  contaminated with DNA fragments and RNA fragments from viruses of various
[2:27:46.400 --> 2:27:51.200]  sorts and they asked the virologist whether you think this is a danger to
[2:27:51.200 --> 2:27:57.080]  humans that you're injecting it and they said well we don't really know we hope
[2:27:57.080 --> 2:28:03.080]  not but you know the scientific studies of DNA fragments shows that they're
[2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:11.680]  inserted in the human genome and so you can have a cancer-causing gene inserted
[2:28:11.680 --> 2:28:17.000]  into your gene that passed on to your children in fact in fact you wrote about
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:20.160]  this remember interviewing you five six years ago you were talking about it two
[2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:25.400]  days ago the BBC admitted that said that these big studies show suddenly we're
[2:28:25.400 --> 2:28:30.560]  mutating faster and that scientists don't know why when the answers right in
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:34.480]  front of them and if you pass the autoimmune defenses of the mouth the
[2:28:34.480 --> 2:28:39.040]  nose and the guts and shoot stuff right into everybody I mean any you know any
[2:28:39.040 --> 2:28:46.080]  mother-nose puncture wounds are dangerous much less injecting stuff grown on dead
[2:28:46.080 --> 2:28:52.240]  fetuses or dead monkeys sure and if you're injecting a mycoplasma for instance
[2:28:52.240 --> 2:28:55.760]  that mycoplasma is going to grow throughout the body and it's an
[2:28:55.760 --> 2:29:00.800]  intercellular organism very very difficult to cure a mycoplasma infection
[2:29:00.800 --> 2:29:07.440]  and we know that mycoplasma is associated with cancer a number of cancer so to inject
[2:29:07.440 --> 2:29:14.120]  these contaminated viruses that mycoplasma into people is just terrifying
[2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:19.360]  to me that's one of the most terrifying aspects of these vaccines is that they
[2:29:19.360 --> 2:29:24.280]  know they're contaminated with fossil agent and they continue to vaccinate
[2:29:24.280 --> 2:29:30.240]  people just like they did with ST-40 that was a polio virus let's talk about that
[2:29:30.240 --> 2:29:33.080]  when we come back Dr. Blalock and then also some of the other things in our
[2:29:33.080 --> 2:29:37.520]  food and water and the great research you've done on that and then other areas
[2:29:37.520 --> 2:29:40.840]  that you think are important to get into also want to ask you what it was like
[2:29:40.840 --> 2:29:47.560]  when you awaken to this in your practice as a neurologist and as a brain
[2:29:47.560 --> 2:29:51.000]  surgeon we'll be right back with Dr. Russell Blalock

[2:33:16.320 --> 2:33:22.040]  moment we are going to open the phones up coming up the next segment into the
[2:33:22.040 --> 2:33:28.560]  next hour he'll be with us till about 40 after or so next hour close to two
[2:33:28.560 --> 2:33:34.640]  hours I want to get into this whole youth brigade and Obama wanting to make
[2:33:34.640 --> 2:33:38.240]  all the kids pledge allegiance to him basically and that's what they said in
[2:33:38.240 --> 2:33:43.560]  their press release last week now they're trying to spin it so we're gonna
[2:33:43.560 --> 2:33:47.640]  discuss that coming up I did want to let you the listeners know about a few of
[2:33:47.640 --> 2:33:54.680]  the sponsors that make this radio show possible well look at that headline I'm
[2:33:54.680 --> 2:34:00.360]  looking at infowars.com across the room and it says governor tells citizens they
[2:34:00.360 --> 2:34:04.280]  must take the shot patriotic duty I mean this is just getting so
[2:34:04.280 --> 2:34:07.920]  Orwellian but that's coming up in a moment I did want to tell a lot of the
[2:34:07.920 --> 2:34:12.560]  listeners about a new sponsor we have you can go check it out and see the
[2:34:12.560 --> 2:34:17.840]  claims that they're making it's a silver lungs silver lungs generator is a
[2:34:17.840 --> 2:34:22.640]  highly cost-effective colloidal silver generator and lung delivery system that
[2:34:22.640 --> 2:34:27.120]  produces pure and endless colloidal silver and delivers the solution and you
[2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:33.000]  can go check out again what they're saying at silver lungs dot com and very
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:35.600]  very interesting we've had a lot of medical doctors and people on saying
[2:34:35.600 --> 2:34:39.680]  that nothing's a cure all nothing's perfect but that nano silver is good for
[2:34:39.680 --> 2:34:44.600]  viruses and bacteria and certainly a lot better than the reports we're seeing
[2:34:44.600 --> 2:34:49.560]  about people taking antibiotics ahead of the flu outbreak thinking it's gonna
[2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:53.080]  protect them all over the world when antibiotics don't even protect you from
[2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:58.240]  a virus but I guess from a secondary infection who knows the point is go find
[2:34:58.240 --> 2:35:05.680]  out more at silver lungs dot com again silver lungs dot com it's like an
[2:35:05.680 --> 2:35:11.160]  aerosolizer evaporator with the colloidal silver and also it has a great
[2:35:11.160 --> 2:35:17.440]  colloidal silver making kit that it comes with one other sponsor that I want
[2:35:17.440 --> 2:35:22.240]  to let the listeners know about is eFoodsDirect.com in these crazy
[2:35:22.240 --> 2:35:27.320]  uncertain times you need to have some storeable foods these things last 15-20
[2:35:27.320 --> 2:35:31.200]  years in climate control now at my house they're in the garage don't have room so
[2:35:31.200 --> 2:35:35.800]  last ten years guaranteed it was recently packed non-gmo non-hybrid they
[2:35:35.800 --> 2:35:40.480]  make the stuff every month triple enameled cams super high quality great
[2:35:40.480 --> 2:35:46.200]  price no MSG eFoodsDirect.com the letter eFoodsDirect.com you'll never
[2:35:46.200 --> 2:35:49.920]  stand on a bread line if you have your own bread or 1-800-409-5633
[2:35:49.920 --> 2:35:56.040]  1-800-409-5633 eFoodsDirect.com okay going back to Dr. Blaylock
[2:35:56.040 --> 2:35:59.160]  Dr. Blaylock you got interrupted by the break you were trying to bring up the
[2:35:59.160 --> 2:36:03.960]  fact that they know this is in the vaccines the contamination but they
[2:36:03.960 --> 2:36:10.440]  continue to just go along with it and as we see all the different diseases and
[2:36:10.440 --> 2:36:15.640]  autoimmune problems and toxicity being generated by this we then see a
[2:36:15.640 --> 2:36:21.000]  compounding with the aspartame in thousands of products the MSG under new
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:25.760]  names in almost everything I try to buy at the store I mean it's ridiculous I
[2:36:25.760 --> 2:36:33.040]  know instantly when I have ingested MSG I I feel within a few minutes or nearly
[2:36:33.040 --> 2:36:38.680]  instantly the fluoride they're putting in the water can you break down the
[2:36:38.680 --> 2:36:43.840]  things that are in our environment and then from your research why this is
[2:36:43.840 --> 2:36:51.040]  happening well the fluoride for instance it's interesting that there's such
[2:36:51.040 --> 2:36:56.200]  compelling evidence that fluoride added to water does not reduce cavities at all
[2:36:56.200 --> 2:37:02.000]  and even the American Dill Association has admitted that so you have to ask
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:06.480]  yourself well if it doesn't reduce cavities what's the purpose of it
[2:37:06.480 --> 2:37:12.880]  their flimsy excuse was well as the water flows over your teeth it may
[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:17.360]  topically strengthen your teeth of course that's that's silly nonsense that a
[2:37:17.360 --> 2:37:24.200]  fourth grader would see through so there's no justification but we do know
[2:37:24.200 --> 2:37:30.440]  and then the National Research Institute are a very comprehensive study
[2:37:30.440 --> 2:37:34.840]  confirming what all the opponents of fluoridation have shown and that is that
[2:37:34.840 --> 2:37:40.720]  fluoride is a powerful acupoint that means meaning that it accumulates in the
[2:37:40.720 --> 2:37:46.400]  body and can stay there for a lifetime it destroys bone increases fractures
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:52.320]  osteoporosis it accumulates in the brain combined with the aluminum produces a
[2:37:52.320 --> 2:38:00.680]  very neurotoxic fluorolumines compound all of this is known so you're in a
[2:38:00.680 --> 2:38:08.120]  quandary as to well if it doesn't even attain its objective that is reducing
[2:38:08.120 --> 2:38:13.160]  cavities and you're everybody admits that and it has all of these toxic effects
[2:38:13.160 --> 2:38:19.440]  it even increases the the budding of flu virus that is the spread of flu virus
[2:38:19.440 --> 2:38:24.840]  in your body what is the purpose what are you putting it in the water for why
[2:38:24.840 --> 2:38:30.480]  does the government send its agents to little small townships that the boat
[2:38:30.480 --> 2:38:36.280]  does not to fluoridate their water why do they use the expense to send
[2:38:36.280 --> 2:38:41.760]  government agents from Washington DC to pressure these people to vote it back
[2:38:41.760 --> 2:38:48.720]  in and use government granting to entice them to put fluoride back in the water
[2:38:48.720 --> 2:38:54.280]  with the purpose well we don't have hard evidence but we know fluoride has a
[2:38:54.280 --> 2:38:59.400]  definite behavioral effect on the brain it can produce in the apathy like
[2:38:59.400 --> 2:39:07.760]  syndrome it can affect the ability to think clearly so is it a financial deal
[2:39:07.760 --> 2:39:14.120]  they have with the manufacturers of aluminum and the manufacturers of
[2:39:14.120 --> 2:39:19.680]  fertilizers to get rid of this place product what exactly is it well you
[2:39:19.680 --> 2:39:24.280]  know you can use your imagination but we know one thing it has absolutely
[2:39:24.280 --> 2:39:31.360]  nothing to do with dental health the MSG in the food the research now is so
[2:39:31.360 --> 2:39:35.920]  compelling that it affects the formation and development of the brain
[2:39:35.920 --> 2:39:42.360]  that it significantly can accelerate a number of dirty dirty diseases like
[2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:48.760]  Alzheimer's Parkinson's may allow the migraine headache a number of things
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:54.320]  particularly behavioral changes in children anger violence is strongly
[2:39:54.320 --> 2:40:01.480]  connected to depression particularly pathologic severe depression so now
[2:40:01.480 --> 2:40:06.960]  that we know all these things and our neuroscience are connected to glutamate
[2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:12.800]  why is the food filled with a glutamate attitude that we know can trigger these
[2:40:12.800 --> 2:40:19.320]  conditions including suicide and that there's an interaction between fluoride
[2:40:19.320 --> 2:40:24.760]  and glutamate there's the internet interaction between fluoride aluminum
[2:40:24.760 --> 2:40:30.320]  glutamate and vaccination that we know if you vaccinate an animal and expose
[2:40:30.320 --> 2:40:35.280]  them for instance to mercury aluminum it dramatically increases the toxicity of
[2:40:35.280 --> 2:40:41.800]  two elements so with all this abundant hard neuroscience showing these
[2:40:41.800 --> 2:40:47.960]  interactive toxicities why is the the so-called protectors of the public the
[2:40:47.960 --> 2:40:55.440]  EPA and FDA not getting these agents out of our food and halting this
[2:40:55.440 --> 2:41:01.760]  destructive and idiotic fluoridation water campaign while they're even talking
[2:41:01.760 --> 2:41:06.720]  about it making it a federal law that every water system in America must be
[2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:10.840]  fluoridated exactly now that the American people and the people the world are
[2:41:10.840 --> 2:41:14.880]  fighting back and having it removed and they admit it doubles the chances of
[2:41:14.880 --> 2:41:20.520]  males adolescent males to get bone cancer they just admit that I've had the
[2:41:20.520 --> 2:41:27.720]  scientists that leads the EPA Union on and 90 plus percent of their scientists
[2:41:27.720 --> 2:41:32.400]  signed a letter saying please take it out because when we've gotten a tour of
[2:41:32.400 --> 2:41:35.280]  the Austin water supply and the people working there agree with us they said
[2:41:35.280 --> 2:41:39.640]  yeah we're told said by the city to do this we pay millions a year for it and
[2:41:39.640 --> 2:41:47.520]  all it is is the toxic waste left over from fertilizer manufacturing they
[2:41:47.520 --> 2:41:50.640]  mine the limestone and then remove the chemicals they want and then leave the
[2:41:50.640 --> 2:41:54.720]  toxic waste and it's over a hundred chemicals they put in our water under
[2:41:54.720 --> 2:42:01.800]  the name fluoride that's just a cat so it's it's it's so insane though that the
[2:42:01.800 --> 2:42:04.720]  average person says there must be a reason for it even though the American
[2:42:04.720 --> 2:42:08.720]  Dental Association now says kids shouldn't brush their teeth with fluoride
[2:42:08.720 --> 2:42:13.000]  toothpaste as it gives them dental fluorosis and makes the teeth shatter my
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:16.800]  dad's a dentist he now understands that but people once fluoride he'll still
[2:42:16.800 --> 2:42:23.520]  give it to him but I mean it's just it's just amazing that this is going on and
[2:42:23.520 --> 2:42:29.040]  we know from the literature that this is part of eugenics well we know that
[2:42:29.040 --> 2:42:33.960]  fluoride has a powerful effect on the reproductive system of both males and
[2:42:33.960 --> 2:42:40.000]  females that produces infertility and reduce fertility we know mercury does
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:44.880]  the same thing so you're injecting children with high doses of mercury we
[2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:52.880]  know that that also has a damaging effect on the reproductive organ we know
[2:42:52.880 --> 2:43:00.400]  that a number of these agents that were being exposed to affect fertility now
[2:43:00.400 --> 2:43:04.720]  easy you you have to conclude what the government has just made up of a bunch of
[2:43:04.720 --> 2:43:10.360]  buffoons who choose to ignore the synergistic interaction of all these
[2:43:10.360 --> 2:43:14.640]  things that they're ordering into our food and water and its effect on
[2:43:14.640 --> 2:43:19.680]  reproduction and fertility or they're doing it on purpose now if you talk to
[2:43:19.680 --> 2:43:24.560]  young people and I've talked to my sons about this I said I've noticed that
[2:43:24.560 --> 2:43:29.120]  there's just an explosion of fertility claims growing all over the country
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:33.960]  because young people having such difficulty with the wives getting
[2:43:33.960 --> 2:43:41.640]  pregnant and he said yeah a number of his friends have had that problem but
[2:43:41.640 --> 2:43:46.520]  cause you know you've either got to conclude with something else is in the
[2:43:46.520 --> 2:43:50.880]  air and the water and the food that's producing infertility for this sudden
[2:43:50.880 --> 2:43:57.080]  change infertility very young people or possibly someone doing this on purpose
[2:43:57.080 --> 2:44:03.320]  this combination fluoride mercury factimages exposure and glutamate
[2:44:03.320 --> 2:44:08.080]  exposure to fertility but I mean Dr. Blalock you in the past on this show
[2:44:08.080 --> 2:44:12.000]  have read amazing quotes by the Rockefellers and in their own textbooks
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:15.480]  and documents where they admit their eugenicist and wanted to create a
[2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:19.160]  medical tyranny to reduce the population and then just recently
[2:44:19.160 --> 2:44:23.680]  eco science the textbook written by the White House science are John P. Holdren
[2:44:23.680 --> 2:44:27.760]  about how they would implant us with devices to sterilize us put drugs in the
[2:44:27.760 --> 2:44:32.960]  water lower our libido and sterilize us set up a planetary government to do
[2:44:32.960 --> 2:44:38.880]  this eradicate the family using the educational system as the wedge to start
[2:44:38.880 --> 2:44:43.440]  that and then since then all these other books he wrote and government
[2:44:43.440 --> 2:44:48.800]  textbooks have come out describing exactly what they're now doing and I
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:53.880]  have him in congressional hearings where J. Rockefeller says oh you walk on
[2:44:53.880 --> 2:44:59.200]  water oh you're the master planner oh you're the great builder it appears that
[2:44:59.200 --> 2:45:03.200]  they have adopted his plan now we know there were previous ones that were similar
[2:45:03.200 --> 2:45:07.720]  but it's like they treat him like a rock star when he's on Letterman when he's
[2:45:07.720 --> 2:45:14.920]  before committees and I it appears that his plan from 1977 in this case was
[2:45:14.920 --> 2:45:20.560]  adopted well yeah and as I told you on that previous program when we were
[2:45:20.560 --> 2:45:25.840]  talking about the Rockefeller Foundation and Carnegie Foundation and Ford they
[2:45:25.840 --> 2:45:29.920]  were spending virtually millions hundreds of millions of dollars of
[2:45:29.920 --> 2:45:36.840]  population control eugenics and sterilization and if you read their
[2:45:36.840 --> 2:45:41.320]  literature I'm talking about some of the most powerful influential people in
[2:45:41.320 --> 2:45:50.200]  society in the 1910-1920 era it was very open this call for controlling a
[2:45:50.200 --> 2:45:55.240]  population and reducing the level of the unfit and people without social
[2:45:55.240 --> 2:46:00.880]  utility they were quite open about it well they're not quite as open about it
[2:46:00.880 --> 2:46:05.280]  but they're still writing about these things in the literature and these are
[2:46:05.280 --> 2:46:11.600]  people that are very influential writing and prestigious journals and magazines
[2:46:11.600 --> 2:46:17.760]  if you look at the the group of papers collected by the Hastings Center which
[2:46:17.760 --> 2:46:24.840]  Ezekiel Emanuel Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel the health czar for Obama his papers are
[2:46:24.840 --> 2:46:30.080]  calling for this very thing that we need to let the elderly die and stop giving
[2:46:30.080 --> 2:46:37.200]  them health care because they're an expense to the the society and they
[2:46:37.200 --> 2:46:42.280]  have no right to live well this was a very similar thing that we heard in the
[2:46:42.280 --> 2:46:47.800]  1910-20 being funded on a massive scale by the Rockefeller and Carnegie and
[2:46:47.800 --> 2:46:53.240]  Ford Foundation and at the same time in Germany I'm talking about in 1910 long
[2:46:53.240 --> 2:46:58.000]  before Hitler came along their society was just flooded with the same literature
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:03.480]  and so with Austria talking about the need to control the unfit and the
[2:47:03.480 --> 2:47:07.400]  control and we know who funded that the Rockefellers again with the Kaiser
[2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:12.160]  Velhelm Institute single-handedly bankrolled it along with Thomas
[2:47:12.160 --> 2:47:16.280]  Watson of IBM and much of their literature came from the United States
[2:47:16.280 --> 2:47:20.360]  they were quoting the literature that was produced by the the Rockefellers and
[2:47:20.360 --> 2:47:26.600]  the Carnegie so Hitler grew up in a society that openly was discussing the
[2:47:26.600 --> 2:47:33.720]  need to eliminate the unfit and the people that were disabled well that's
[2:47:33.720 --> 2:47:37.920]  right we thought the US and England were going to join him and that's why the
[2:47:37.920 --> 2:47:42.200]  king of England Edward the 8th of the time was a Nazi and Hitler was on time
[2:47:42.200 --> 2:47:45.960]  magazine and a man he's doing a great job sterilizing and killing the retarded
[2:47:45.960 --> 2:47:50.080]  kids and my god we need to have more of this here and we can drug the water and
[2:47:50.080 --> 2:47:54.160]  then they went underground and now they're doing it to us and the general
[2:47:54.160 --> 2:47:59.000]  public better wake up well they're the problem with the average person is
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:02.760]  they're not reading what these people are writing because they're openly
[2:48:02.760 --> 2:48:08.800]  writing about a lot of this now the need to to regulate control society if you
[2:48:08.800 --> 2:48:13.840]  read this healthcare bill I've read all thousand seventy pages and analyze
[2:48:13.840 --> 2:48:20.800]  various sections of it in detail it is designed to eliminate the unwanted
[2:48:20.800 --> 2:48:27.360]  people and it conforms exactly to this Rockefell idea that certain people are
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:31.840]  not fit to live in society and have no right to be here and that government
[2:48:31.840 --> 2:48:36.960]  should decide who has the right to live in the United States who doesn't I wrote
[2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:44.240]  a paper recently called social utility who should that should we let mom
[2:48:44.240 --> 2:48:50.320]  grandfather and grandpa live well that I go that's the thing I want you to
[2:48:50.320 --> 2:48:54.760]  comment on that but Dashel wrote a book saying if you're 60 you don't get eye
[2:48:54.760 --> 2:48:58.080]  surgery you don't get brain surgery and that's what they do in the socialized
[2:48:58.080 --> 2:49:01.360]  healthcare system but but that's the thing is they write it
[2:49:01.360 --> 2:49:07.200]  Emanuel's brother says it the bill says we're gonna do with this board recommends
[2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:10.320]  and then you read with the board recommends and it's what you just said
[2:49:10.320 --> 2:49:14.400]  and then they lie and say we're not doing this just like they have bills
[2:49:14.400 --> 2:49:17.920]  introduced for compulsory service and Obama wants it and he's gonna have the
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:23.360]  kids form up in front of him next week literally with telescreens like 1984
[2:49:23.360 --> 2:49:26.880]  and then now and now he's saying well what's wrong with that I mean
[2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:31.680]  dr. Boylock do you ever pinch yourself even though you study this and expose it
[2:49:31.680 --> 2:49:35.520]  that it's really happening that these people really are in control
[2:49:35.520 --> 2:49:40.000]  well it's happening so rapidly you know they as I tell people you go back 40
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:44.960]  years you had a hard time getting a politician admitted to the liberal
[2:49:44.960 --> 2:49:48.880]  uh well now they proudly not only say they're liberals but that they're far
[2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:52.560]  left uh you know most of the time on tv they say
[2:49:52.560 --> 2:49:58.160]  from the left well uh 40 years ago 30 years ago you would never hear a politician
[2:49:58.160 --> 2:50:01.760]  say from the left because that's admitting i'm a socialist or a
[2:50:01.760 --> 2:50:07.360]  communist uh that i'm a collectivist but they're proud of it now and what
[2:50:07.360 --> 2:50:11.920]  happened when we got the Obama administration if they felt well the
[2:50:11.920 --> 2:50:16.560]  people won't collectivist and therefore we can move ahead full speed
[2:50:16.560 --> 2:50:21.920]  well look at van jones saying hey the green jobs is to take the economy over
[2:50:21.920 --> 2:50:25.200]  for total redistribution of wealth
[2:50:25.200 --> 2:50:29.760]  i mean these people mean business that's collectivist
[2:50:29.760 --> 2:50:34.160]  uh and and it's the idea that there's a group of wise people who tell the rest
[2:50:34.160 --> 2:50:37.520]  society what their duty is and their health core
[2:50:37.520 --> 2:50:42.560]  is uh a core of young people uh being drafted is exactly that
[2:50:42.560 --> 2:50:45.760]  you have a duty to do what your government tells you to do
[2:50:45.760 --> 2:50:50.160]  and help them you know recruit other people into the
[2:50:50.160 --> 2:50:54.320]  amazing amazing dr blalox stay there when we come back
[2:50:54.320 --> 2:50:57.280]  i want to get it more into the eugenics master plan than take phone calls at

[2:54:29.920 --> 2:54:34.320]  russell blalock uh doctor you said you just did a two hour
[2:54:34.320 --> 2:54:40.000]  rundown program on the health care bill you read the whole thing
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:43.440]  i've scanned through it we have your report social utility
[2:54:43.440 --> 2:54:47.440]  how much are grandpa and grandma worth and well we've got
[2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:52.880]  that linked up on info wars.com it's also at blalock report.com
[2:54:52.880 --> 2:54:56.960]  run through what's really in the bill as a medical doctor
[2:54:56.960 --> 2:55:01.920]  as a brain surgeon as a neurologist what this really does
[2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:05.760]  uh if you look through the bill you know one of the first things they're sure
[2:55:05.760 --> 2:55:09.120]  everybody you'll be able to keep your insurance if you like it
[2:55:09.120 --> 2:55:12.000]  that is an absolute lie what you're going to be
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:15.680]  faced with and your employer's going to be faced with
[2:55:15.680 --> 2:55:19.440]  is that if you keep your private insurance their penalties you're going to
[2:55:19.440 --> 2:55:23.040]  have to pay and of course for the people covering your
[2:55:23.040 --> 2:55:26.800]  insurance it's going to behoove them in terms of finances
[2:55:26.800 --> 2:55:34.080]  to move you forcibly into the public option so you will lose the high quality
[2:55:34.080 --> 2:55:37.360]  coverage that you have as your business now for
[2:55:37.360 --> 2:55:41.920]  individual insured people they tack on so many requirements
[2:55:41.920 --> 2:55:48.560]  mandates all the financial things that have to be
[2:55:48.560 --> 2:55:53.200]  met by the insurance company and the insured person that you will feel no
[2:55:53.200 --> 2:55:57.520]  longer be able to pay your premium. So this is a whole new bureaucracy where
[2:55:57.520 --> 2:56:01.280]  they find you if you don't have insurance and then like a new agency like
[2:56:01.280 --> 2:56:06.560]  the IRS come in and manage your life. Well not only do you pay a 2.5
[2:56:06.560 --> 2:56:11.360]  percent excise tax for not having insurance and on top of that if you
[2:56:11.360 --> 2:56:15.360]  have higher income say you make 253 or 1000
[2:56:15.360 --> 2:56:19.520]  total work that's not your income but total work
[2:56:19.520 --> 2:56:23.680]  then they tack on another percentage and it could go up to as much as
[2:56:23.680 --> 2:56:29.440]  8.59 percent tax that you're going to pay above your other taxes
[2:56:29.440 --> 2:56:33.920]  because you didn't take the public option or you just choose to get a health
[2:56:33.920 --> 2:56:37.040]  savings account you're going to be punish severely for that
[2:56:37.040 --> 2:56:44.160]  so you will be forcibly moved into the public option unless you just
[2:56:44.160 --> 2:56:49.120]  enormously rich in resistance. The really scary thing of this bill is that
[2:56:49.120 --> 2:56:52.720]  you read through it almost everywhere it says things are left up to the
[2:56:52.720 --> 2:56:56.480]  discretion of the secretary of HHS health and human
[2:56:56.480 --> 2:57:00.400]  service. So as you're reading the bill you find
[2:57:00.400 --> 2:57:04.640]  that it's not actually spelled out it says this will be determined 18 months
[2:57:04.640 --> 2:57:09.440]  later or this will be determined a year later by the secretary of HHS
[2:57:09.440 --> 2:57:15.680]  coding criteria who will be included all this will be determined later
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:20.880]  so you're signing a bill in which there's very few
[2:57:20.880 --> 2:57:24.400]  specifics added in the many of these sections. Well that's what's happening
[2:57:24.400 --> 2:57:28.240]  with the cyber security where they admit it so they can take the web over
[2:57:28.240 --> 2:57:32.080]  that's what the gun bills do they have a bill that says the attorney general
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:36.000]  can ban any and all guns whenever he feels like it they're
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:40.720]  openly setting up a dictatorship. Oh yeah I mean as you read through this
[2:57:40.720 --> 2:57:45.040]  bill you become more and more frightened because for instance it says all
[2:57:45.040 --> 2:57:50.240]  physicians are in the public option whether they want to be or not that
[2:57:50.240 --> 2:57:55.680]  they have to specifically apply to remove themselves
[2:57:55.680 --> 2:57:59.520]  from the public option that is being a federal doctor
[2:57:59.520 --> 2:58:03.040]  and that the department of health and human services secretary
[2:58:03.040 --> 2:58:06.800]  will decide the mechanism by which you're allowed to leave
[2:58:06.800 --> 2:58:10.960]  uh which you could make it so difficult and so financially punishing
[2:58:10.960 --> 2:58:14.640]  uh most doctors won't leave because they're going to need doctors
[2:58:14.640 --> 2:58:18.080]  and they're not going to want them to live it says that she has
[2:58:18.080 --> 2:58:21.760]  a control over all payments to positions possible
[2:58:21.760 --> 2:58:28.240]  earth accounts uh is that her discretion uh as to what they'll be paid
[2:58:28.240 --> 2:58:32.320]  and the incredible thing is most scary is I've read these sections you're
[2:58:32.320 --> 2:58:36.320]  talking about when you bring them up they just say you're a liar
[2:58:36.320 --> 2:58:42.800]  it doesn't exist final hour 70 seconds away stay with us

[3:00:11.360 --> 3:00:15.360]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is our guest for another 40 minutes I'm gonna get into
[3:00:15.360 --> 3:00:20.640]  Obama's big push to have the youth line up and
[3:00:20.640 --> 3:00:25.280]  become his friend and help him you got Al Gore telling school kids all over the
[3:00:25.280 --> 3:00:28.080]  country on tape don't do what your parents say
[3:00:28.080 --> 3:00:31.760]  global warming is real work with the government
[3:00:31.760 --> 3:00:35.840]  Van Jones saying we are gonna overthrow America
[3:00:35.840 --> 3:00:39.440]  and they try to hook him up with 9-11 truth we'll break that down coming up
[3:00:39.440 --> 3:00:42.320]  Dr. Russell Blaylock's our guest okay next segment I'm gonna start going to your
[3:00:42.320 --> 3:00:45.760]  phone calls Dr. Blaylock was just running through some
[3:00:45.760 --> 3:00:52.800]  of the total dictatorial blank check takeover and that's everything Obama's
[3:00:52.800 --> 3:00:56.400]  doing is just at our discretion in our discretion
[3:00:56.400 --> 3:01:00.800]  and go ahead it's interesting the other day I was watching tv and I had one of
[3:01:00.800 --> 3:01:04.560]  the the leftist politicians saying oh there's
[3:01:04.560 --> 3:01:10.160]  absolutely no rationing in this bill virtually every page is rationing and
[3:01:10.160 --> 3:01:15.920]  the penalties on positions for just minor misinterpretation
[3:01:15.920 --> 3:01:20.880]  of rules or regulations there's enormous civil penalty
[3:01:20.880 --> 3:01:24.640]  and what we know and and and national health systems with time they get
[3:01:24.640 --> 3:01:28.080]  further and further in debt and in order to make up that
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:33.280]  that that loss they start increasing the number of penalties
[3:01:33.280 --> 3:01:37.680]  and cutting position pay well after a while a position
[3:01:37.680 --> 3:01:41.760]  pay is going to be so low that he's no longer going to be able to maintain his
[3:01:41.760 --> 3:01:43.760]  office which means they're going to have to
[3:01:43.760 --> 3:01:47.600]  sell it to the federal government the federal government will take over all
[3:01:47.600 --> 3:01:50.800]  positions off well this happened where I used to
[3:01:50.800 --> 3:01:54.560]  practice in North Carolina just under the Medicare Medicaid and
[3:01:54.560 --> 3:01:58.560]  managed care uh uh system I warned the
[3:01:58.560 --> 3:02:01.840]  physicians it was coming they chose not to list
[3:02:01.840 --> 3:02:06.320]  I left and moved to Mississippi all of their offices were purchased by the
[3:02:06.320 --> 3:02:11.440]  the regulatory agency and it ruined all of their practices
[3:02:11.440 --> 3:02:14.880]  uh well this is going to be much much work
[3:02:14.880 --> 3:02:18.160]  we're going to federalize virtually every segment
[3:02:18.160 --> 3:02:22.400]  that has anything to do with health care but look at it the roads are being
[3:02:22.400 --> 3:02:25.520]  grabbed the auto industries are being bankrupted and
[3:02:25.520 --> 3:02:30.080]  the the bailout money goes to build the factories in China Europe and Brazil
[3:02:30.080 --> 3:02:34.960]  this is corporate receivership where these foreign banks use the government
[3:02:34.960 --> 3:02:38.160]  to come in and now they're even taking over the essential
[3:02:38.160 --> 3:02:42.080]  services this is the total state
[3:02:42.080 --> 3:02:48.000]  absolutely this is the rating of position one thing they want to sell
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:52.000]  this bill is we're going to give you high quality health care
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:56.240]  and we have built into a quality measure well uh
[3:02:56.240 --> 3:03:04.400]  on page 258 line 13 through 17 on uh evaluating positions for quality
[3:03:04.400 --> 3:03:08.320]  medical care performance it says the performance
[3:03:08.320 --> 3:03:12.400]  will be uh based on satisfactory submitting
[3:03:12.400 --> 3:03:16.080]  data on the quality measure that the word
[3:03:16.080 --> 3:03:19.440]  it's not the actual quality that we're measuring
[3:03:19.440 --> 3:03:22.960]  it's how well the physicians do what we tell them
[3:03:22.960 --> 3:03:27.520]  in terms of submitting form and paperwork to the federal government
[3:03:27.520 --> 3:03:31.920]  if you're a good little boy and a good little girl and you submit your paperwork
[3:03:31.920 --> 3:03:35.360]  on time and you do all the paperwork they demand
[3:03:35.360 --> 3:03:38.800]  then you're qualified as a very high quality
[3:03:38.800 --> 3:03:43.040]  medical care facility well sir i mean i mean i mean look at government
[3:03:43.040 --> 3:03:46.880]  offices falling apart total lazy bureaucrats everywhere
[3:03:46.880 --> 3:03:52.320]  now they want to take health care over and they're going to be rating people
[3:03:52.320 --> 3:03:56.800]  and going after people with political weapons i mean this is
[3:03:56.800 --> 3:04:01.280]  this is just an amazing tyranny and and every time i see another piece of it
[3:04:01.280 --> 3:04:04.560]  each piece by itself is enough for a revolution
[3:04:04.560 --> 3:04:08.880]  but you put it all together it's just it's
[3:04:08.880 --> 3:04:12.720]  the thing they have going for them is it's so bold
[3:04:12.720 --> 3:04:17.200]  that the government's going to take over and tell you who's good and who isn't
[3:04:17.200 --> 3:04:21.120]  i mean this is insane and then they i go back to it dr blalock
[3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:24.720]  they then lie about it and say they're not doing this
[3:04:24.720 --> 3:04:28.880]  well you know one of the big things that really got people fired up with the
[3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:33.600]  idea of the the advanced care planning is the euphemistic term
[3:04:33.600 --> 3:04:36.720]  uh which was the death panel where we have
[3:04:36.720 --> 3:04:40.400]  consultation with the elderly and the chronically ill that it's able
[3:04:40.400 --> 3:04:44.000]  to convince them that it'd probably be better if they just move down into
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:48.320]  another uh uh life and and and give up their
[3:04:48.320 --> 3:04:52.800]  life for the good of the state well if you read this it's exactly stay there
[3:04:52.800 --> 3:04:55.840]  we gotta break come back with the death panels break it down and we're going to
[3:04:55.840 --> 3:05:00.960]  the calls dr russell blalock stay with us
[3:05:00.960 --> 3:05:04.000]  the illusion created by the power elite is a lie

[3:08:22.240 --> 3:08:25.120]  momentarily again uh dr blalock we could have
[3:08:25.120 --> 3:08:27.920]  you back up the next few weeks for another full show just on
[3:08:27.920 --> 3:08:32.480]  the health care plan but i go back to this i've read the same subsections
[3:08:32.480 --> 3:08:37.040]  you're reading my dad's a physician so growing up i know enough about how health care
[3:08:37.040 --> 3:08:40.240]  works he's also been a medical care consultant
[3:08:40.240 --> 3:08:44.320]  both hospitals and dental offices so i i can specifically read this and
[3:08:44.320 --> 3:08:47.360]  understand a lot of it but i've seen what the experts have said as well and
[3:08:47.360 --> 3:08:52.880]  i've read it it's very clear this is a total takeover of 20 of our economy
[3:08:52.880 --> 3:08:56.240]  and the lying about it but you were getting into the death panels
[3:08:56.240 --> 3:08:59.840]  i mean it's dashel it's rama manual's brother it's
[3:08:59.840 --> 3:09:03.120]  the publications at first a few months ago when they thought they had it they
[3:09:03.120 --> 3:09:06.880]  were saying yeah you don't need these unnecessary tests and
[3:09:06.880 --> 3:09:10.560]  i've watched house of commons back when tony blair was in admitting people were
[3:09:10.560 --> 3:09:15.440]  waiting 16 18 months for brain surgeries that were
[3:09:15.440 --> 3:09:18.880]  95 successful if you got it within two months but
[3:09:18.880 --> 3:09:24.240]  if you didn't you were dead and they admitted this i mean i've got two people
[3:09:24.240 --> 3:09:27.440]  that work for me in england the watson brothers they their health care
[3:09:27.440 --> 3:09:30.560]  systems a nightmare and they now are saying
[3:09:30.560 --> 3:09:33.840]  if you've had a bad life where you've smoked or you've done this we're not
[3:09:33.840 --> 3:09:38.720]  going to give you the health care so i keep going back to the lying
[3:09:38.720 --> 3:09:41.920]  when they attack sarah palin who by the way i don't like sarah palin she was a
[3:09:41.920 --> 3:09:45.760]  fool to quit the governorship you know they put her in there as a ringer
[3:09:45.760 --> 3:09:49.680]  but my point is she's right but instead they just say oh she's a liar she's a
[3:09:49.680 --> 3:09:54.560]  dumb woman she's an idiot there's no death panels when these bioethicist
[3:09:54.560 --> 3:09:58.960]  boards i mean these are death panels dr blalock
[3:09:58.960 --> 3:10:02.640]  well you see they're clever not using the term death panel
[3:10:02.640 --> 3:10:07.040]  third or uh end of life uh death panel anything
[3:10:07.040 --> 3:10:09.440]  like that what they do is they leave it open ended
[3:10:09.440 --> 3:10:12.720]  rather than talk about end of life services for it
[3:10:12.720 --> 3:10:18.800]  how did even a hot feet well if you know about hot feet what they did to them
[3:10:18.800 --> 3:10:23.440]  is you're allowed to or you're supposed to transfer a patient to hot feet if you
[3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:27.920]  think they'll die in six months but physicians don't always know
[3:10:27.920 --> 3:10:31.840]  when someone would die so some live a year or two years
[3:10:31.840 --> 3:10:35.520]  well you have to take care of them and comfort them and give them
[3:10:35.520 --> 3:10:40.400]  their medication well the government came in and said anybody living over six
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:45.440]  months will cut off all uh uh Medicare payments to the you're
[3:10:45.440 --> 3:10:49.760]  going to be stuck with the cost well the hot feet program said well we came
[3:10:49.760 --> 3:10:53.280]  uh soon this calls so they started injecting the patient
[3:10:53.280 --> 3:10:57.280]  morphing so they would die within six months
[3:10:57.280 --> 3:11:00.800]  uh and so the government policy pushed the
[3:11:00.800 --> 3:11:05.440]  the hot feet system uh to start ending patients life sooner than they
[3:11:05.440 --> 3:11:08.400]  they would normally and now they're killing people in europe on
[3:11:08.400 --> 3:11:11.840]  i mean newsweek admits this but says it's beautiful and wonderful i showed the
[3:11:11.840 --> 3:11:15.520]  article a few weeks ago they're now killing people who were depressed
[3:11:15.520 --> 3:11:18.880]  and the government will pay for that but i i know i interrupted before you
[3:11:18.880 --> 3:11:23.680]  finish your your your full story uh along those whole lines so go ahead
[3:11:23.680 --> 3:11:27.920]  well in the in the uh bill itself it talks about you know they say well
[3:11:27.920 --> 3:11:31.440]  it's not mandatory you have this counseling every five years well that's
[3:11:31.440 --> 3:11:36.160]  a lot uh page two uh 424 says uh that this is
[3:11:36.160 --> 3:11:40.000]  a part of routine medical care and the individual
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:44.720]  will have the consultation every five years and that if they develop a change
[3:11:44.720 --> 3:11:48.480]  in their medical condition uh that is an injury or
[3:11:48.480 --> 3:11:51.600]  anything that could potentially be like a
[3:11:51.600 --> 3:11:56.640]  uh life ending which is virtually anything uh that'd be a consultation
[3:11:56.640 --> 3:11:59.360]  with her more often and they'll be updated
[3:11:59.360 --> 3:12:02.560]  it also says that you will be referred to special
[3:12:02.560 --> 3:12:06.800]  a national state and uh community-based organization
[3:12:06.800 --> 3:12:09.920]  who will do the counseling well that includes acorn
[3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:13.680]  uh exactly so this is total political indoctrination
[3:12:13.680 --> 3:12:18.240]  and the horror stories of hospice and it's different
[3:12:18.240 --> 3:12:21.680]  different different facilities are different but the wall street journal
[3:12:21.680 --> 3:12:25.760]  with wesley smith had a whole series of articles about people in government
[3:12:25.760 --> 3:12:29.760]  custody who were paralyzed next day a neck down begging
[3:12:29.760 --> 3:12:34.080]  for food and water and being killed well yeah and of course this is what
[3:12:34.080 --> 3:12:36.880]  happened in england in england for instance one of the government
[3:12:36.880 --> 3:12:40.960]  studies on the quality of the national health service found that in one
[3:12:40.960 --> 3:12:44.960]  city 400 to a thousand 200 people died from what they
[3:12:44.960 --> 3:12:50.320]  described as appalling health care uh that's just one city 400 to a thousand
[3:12:50.320 --> 3:12:54.800]  200 in a year uh now you multiply that down to 60
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:12:58.080]  million people in england uh you're talking about 10 000
[3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:02.160]  20 000 more people dying every year from appalling care the
[3:13:02.160 --> 3:13:05.920]  deepest stories of patients starving to death uh in hospital
[3:13:05.920 --> 3:13:08.240]  war and i had a friend of mine who lives in
[3:13:08.240 --> 3:13:15.280]  Louisiana and he uh told me the story of uh one of his close friends daughter
[3:13:15.280 --> 3:13:18.800]  was a medical student she went to england to work in the
[3:13:18.800 --> 3:13:21.840]  national health care service to see what it was like
[3:13:21.840 --> 3:13:26.240]  she developed pneumonia was admitted to a hospital and for six days she never
[3:13:26.240 --> 3:13:30.480]  saw a a physician and never received any medication
[3:13:30.480 --> 3:13:34.160]  she is progressively getting worse she was afraid she's gonna die
[3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:38.320]  she called home to her mother her mother flew to england picked her up
[3:13:38.320 --> 3:13:42.240]  flew her back home to louis vienna and had an ambulance here at the hospital
[3:13:42.240 --> 3:13:47.040]  now that's how they treat the medical student uh for six days she wasn't even
[3:13:47.040 --> 3:13:51.600]  seen by physicians she could have died well i mean i i watched the house of
[3:13:51.600 --> 3:13:56.160]  commons and for all you dumb stupid ignorant gullible people out there who
[3:13:56.160 --> 3:14:00.320]  are watching this or listening who believe all these lies about how you're
[3:14:00.320 --> 3:14:03.680]  going to get free health care the moon is not made of cheese and you're not
[3:14:03.680 --> 3:14:07.760]  getting free health care and the government is working for big banks
[3:14:07.760 --> 3:14:11.200]  that want a new tax to pay off these tens of trillions they've stolen
[3:14:11.200 --> 3:14:14.320]  and they're just going to grab the health care tax you
[3:14:14.320 --> 3:14:17.600]  keep the money and then give you an aspirin for a heart attack
[3:14:17.600 --> 3:14:21.360]  like they do uh in these other socialist countries so you better
[3:14:21.360 --> 3:14:24.480]  figure that out i want to go to calls dr blalock but have you
[3:14:24.480 --> 3:14:28.240]  after we take some hits some more of what's going on in the health care plan
[3:14:28.240 --> 3:14:32.960]  but ron manuals brother who's now in the white house advising
[3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:37.280]  remember last week he said doctors shouldn't be so obsessed over their
[3:14:37.280 --> 3:14:41.440]  Hippocratic oath to do no harm from Hippocrates
[3:14:41.440 --> 3:14:45.440]  and for the what the last decade they haven't given the Hippocratic oath
[3:14:45.440 --> 3:14:48.480]  i mean they really are taking our doctors and nurses
[3:14:48.480 --> 3:14:53.120]  and taking them from being great upstanding people guardians of human
[3:14:53.120 --> 3:14:56.400]  dignity and turning them into little Nazi ghouls
[3:14:56.400 --> 3:15:01.120]  can you speak to the Hippocratic oath and Emmanuel's brother having the nerve
[3:15:01.120 --> 3:15:04.400]  to say well you shouldn't take it serious
[3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:08.880]  well the basis of the Hippocratic oath was hypocrite and that was teaching
[3:15:08.880 --> 3:15:12.640]  physicians that you're to do everything you can for your
[3:15:12.640 --> 3:15:17.920]  patient and you're never to take a life uh well that uh of course was an
[3:15:17.920 --> 3:15:23.120]  attack on abortion and so the the left wing didn't like that at all
[3:15:23.120 --> 3:15:26.560]  for physicians were not supposed to take a lot
[3:15:26.560 --> 3:15:29.760]  it also included euthanasia meaning you're never
[3:15:29.760 --> 3:15:34.640]  to kill someone uh because you think they're they're a useless life
[3:15:34.640 --> 3:15:39.600]  well they didn't like that either so we have at least two things that
[3:15:39.600 --> 3:15:43.360]  was getting under the skin of the lab that's abortion and euthanasia
[3:15:43.360 --> 3:15:47.280]  so they want the the oath to be removed well now
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:51.280]  with the uh uh executive Emmanuel who's the physician
[3:15:51.280 --> 3:15:54.880]  saying that this oath should be abandoned and physicians are just
[3:15:54.880 --> 3:15:59.200]  too obsessed with the idea of saving lives and we need to start letting these
[3:15:59.200 --> 3:16:05.200]  people go they're just wasted uh effort uh that they have no social utility
[3:16:05.200 --> 3:16:08.880]  and of course that would also include all disabled people
[3:16:08.880 --> 3:16:14.320]  uh because according to the dyslexicon uh disabled people have no social
[3:16:14.320 --> 3:16:18.320]  utility they have no purpose uh and they're drain on the economy
[3:16:18.320 --> 3:16:23.120]  therefore we should just let them die it even says in the Hastings Center
[3:16:23.120 --> 3:16:26.640]  that uh it has been a crazy idea to give
[3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:30.480]  dialysis to people because some are living 20 years
[3:16:30.480 --> 3:16:33.520]  on dialysis and that we could have just let them go
[3:16:33.520 --> 3:16:37.920]  uh at the time that they develop renal failure and they even in one of the
[3:16:37.920 --> 3:16:40.800]  articles said we should turn back the clock on medicine
[3:16:40.800 --> 3:16:44.560]  instead of practicing high technology medicine we have today
[3:16:44.560 --> 3:16:49.760]  we should turn it back to the 1960s level and have that as our healthcare
[3:16:49.760 --> 3:16:53.920]  doctor is there any doubt in your incredibly
[3:16:53.920 --> 3:16:59.840]  deep breadth of research that these are eugenicists and we have a eugenicist
[3:16:59.840 --> 3:17:06.480]  eugenics guild running our modern society and that at the core
[3:17:06.480 --> 3:17:09.600]  it's just a rationale to be sadistic control freaks
[3:17:09.600 --> 3:17:13.280]  who are on power trips i mean most of these hollow people
[3:17:13.280 --> 3:17:18.400]  they don't even think they're doing good these are really dark people
[3:17:18.400 --> 3:17:21.840]  well yeah i think it's a mixed group i think there's some who and their
[3:17:21.840 --> 3:17:25.280]  perverted way of thinking think it's good
[3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:29.840]  some are just the evil people from the core
[3:17:29.840 --> 3:17:33.680]  but if you read their literature they really think this is
[3:17:33.680 --> 3:17:37.760]  something that's beneficial to society is to get rid of what they call
[3:17:37.760 --> 3:17:42.480]  the human weed they said weed a garden and get rid of the weed
[3:17:42.480 --> 3:17:46.080]  well that's what we have to do in society it's filled with all these
[3:17:46.080 --> 3:17:50.400]  unfit these people who don't deserve life
[3:17:50.400 --> 3:17:55.360]  and we should weed them out by whatever methods we can and they said well we know
[3:17:55.360 --> 3:17:58.880]  this public won't accept extermination camps
[3:17:58.880 --> 3:18:02.560]  but if we could just deny them healthcare they'll die off on their own
[3:18:02.560 --> 3:18:05.280]  and that's what margaret sanger of course said you're repeating her and then
[3:18:05.280 --> 3:18:09.040]  that's repeated but really the test of humanity is people
[3:18:09.040 --> 3:18:13.280]  that are more intelligent stronger we're meant to lift up the week
[3:18:13.280 --> 3:18:19.040]  at the moment we delve into this we let pure wickedness out of the bottle and
[3:18:19.040 --> 3:18:22.480]  society's collapse well absolutely i mean
[3:18:22.480 --> 3:18:26.560]  you when you start reading what some of the so-called elite right
[3:18:26.560 --> 3:18:30.720]  it's quite frightening and like i said is the stage was set for
[3:18:30.720 --> 3:18:35.920]  for adolf helmer uh... in the nineteen hundred to eighteen hundred
[3:18:35.920 --> 3:18:39.520]  of people writing things that he eventually implemented
[3:18:39.520 --> 3:18:44.160]  same thing with lennon and solid mouth they talk there were people who wrote
[3:18:44.160 --> 3:18:49.440]  uh... quite eloquent uh... papers about uh... controlling society and
[3:18:49.440 --> 3:18:54.080]  exterminating mass numbers of people uh... well along came a dictator strong
[3:18:54.080 --> 3:18:57.760]  enough to carry this out uh... what does the average public
[3:18:57.760 --> 3:19:00.800]  sees the dictator they don't see the foundation
[3:19:00.800 --> 3:19:04.240]  that was that uh... fifty a hundred years before
[3:19:04.240 --> 3:19:08.640]  uh... by these these elitists one of the things that scares me is bill
[3:19:08.640 --> 3:19:11.840]  their type it describes taking over the entire medical
[3:19:11.840 --> 3:19:15.920]  education uh... it talks about uh... in medical

[3:21:18.480 --> 3:21:22.560]  we sit down and shout out the day that we stop asking questions
[3:21:22.560 --> 3:21:27.200]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door
[3:21:27.200 --> 3:21:33.280]  seven years after the attacks of september 11 a global awakening has taken place
[3:21:33.280 --> 3:21:40.000]  an inside job how dare you
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:42.640]  if you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for
[3:21:42.640 --> 3:21:45.360]  treason yourself oh hell it's breaking loose on
[3:21:45.360 --> 3:21:47.920]  sixth avenue and if the government has not told the
[3:21:47.920 --> 3:21:51.680]  truth in five years we will be here on the tenth anniversary of

[3:21:59.760 --> 3:22:02.400]  next level hello ted anderson listeners of the
[3:22:02.400 --> 3:22:05.680]  network are familiar with the federal reserve note and understand the risks
[3:22:05.680 --> 3:22:08.800]  of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it
[3:22:08.800 --> 3:22:12.160]  comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the
[3:22:12.160 --> 3:22:14.800]  amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts
[3:22:14.800 --> 3:22:18.720]  a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held
[3:22:18.720 --> 3:22:22.160]  in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through
[3:22:22.160 --> 3:22:25.920]  fdic if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run
[3:22:25.920 --> 3:22:29.760]  followed by a depressed economy a current effort is underway by the fed
[3:22:29.760 --> 3:22:33.280]  along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors
[3:22:33.280 --> 3:22:37.040]  however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity
[3:22:37.040 --> 3:22:40.560]  can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability
[3:22:40.560 --> 3:22:44.320]  i recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly
[3:22:44.320 --> 3:22:48.240]  repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been
[3:22:48.240 --> 3:22:51.680]  driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over

[3:23:00.320 --> 3:23:03.840]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[3:23:03.840 --> 3:23:07.200]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[3:23:07.200 --> 3:23:10.560]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[3:23:10.560 --> 3:23:13.600]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed
[3:23:13.600 --> 3:23:16.640]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could
[3:23:16.640 --> 3:23:19.360]  even happen again so our friends at solutions from
[3:23:19.360 --> 3:23:23.040]  science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[3:23:23.040 --> 3:23:27.680]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of

[3:23:31.280 --> 3:23:34.240]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[3:23:34.240 --> 3:23:37.920]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden

[3:23:47.920 --> 3:23:56.960]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item

[3:24:12.320 --> 3:24:17.440]  man i wanted to get into things to protect yourself from this flu
[3:24:17.440 --> 3:24:22.720]  does dr. blalock think it's all high does this flu does the vaccine
[3:24:22.720 --> 3:24:28.000]  cause a hemorrhagic response do you get more sun to get vitamin d is that the
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:31.440]  answer and and well right before he leaves us
[3:24:31.440 --> 3:24:33.840]  we'll ask him that briefly but let's go to calls
[3:24:33.840 --> 3:24:38.320]  tony in jersey you're on the air tony good afternoon alex
[3:24:38.320 --> 3:24:44.240]  dr. glalock how are you doing hello um i have um i have a couple of questions
[3:24:44.240 --> 3:24:47.760]  about the swine flu shot also um you know about the health
[3:24:47.760 --> 3:24:50.960]  care but i'd like to make two comments if i may alex
[3:24:50.960 --> 3:24:54.560]  okay that's that's two questions and two comments make it quick please
[3:24:54.560 --> 3:24:59.040]  hey uh number one i i do have some very interesting things that i'd like to
[3:24:59.040 --> 3:25:02.560]  discuss with you at a later time i have your number i'll get in touch with you
[3:25:02.560 --> 3:25:07.840]  okay okay i can um i've never gone public with this
[3:25:07.840 --> 3:25:11.280]  and big brother probably is not going to like it
[3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:15.760]  in fact i may even be in fear of my life tony please that's a big preface just
[3:25:15.760 --> 3:25:18.240]  just tell us sir we don't have a lot of time
[3:25:18.240 --> 3:25:22.400]  okay up in 91 i tried to join the military
[3:25:22.400 --> 3:25:26.880]  i went through the meps uh process where you know it's the military entrance
[3:25:26.880 --> 3:25:30.160]  process center uh where to give you shots
[3:25:30.160 --> 3:25:33.680]  and take your physical and all the all that stuff
[3:25:33.680 --> 3:25:37.680]  well about two weeks afterwards they called me into the office
[3:25:37.680 --> 3:25:42.240]  and told me that i had the AIDS virus i am not gay
[3:25:42.240 --> 3:25:47.040]  i have never had a blood transfusion i do not do drugs of any kind yeah but
[3:25:47.040 --> 3:25:50.320]  about a third of the time they give you a false positive sir
[3:25:50.320 --> 3:25:53.840]  right well anyway it turns out that that's what it is
[3:25:53.840 --> 3:25:57.760]  and after research and everything i know where i got it
[3:25:57.760 --> 3:26:05.360]  you know and um so my question is number one with someone in that situation
[3:26:05.360 --> 3:26:09.920]  how is the swine flu vaccine and the healthcare going to affect them
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:14.160]  all right let's not appreciate your call um he's as he's saying if he has an
[3:26:14.160 --> 3:26:17.280]  hiv virus well well what will this do
[3:26:17.280 --> 3:26:20.880]  well if you have an hiv virus you shouldn't have any vaccine
[3:26:20.880 --> 3:26:24.000]  uh number one they don't work number two is that you
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:27.200]  have the vaccine and you're an immunocompromised
[3:26:27.200 --> 3:26:30.960]  you run a very high risk developed autoimmune disease
[3:26:30.960 --> 3:26:36.800]  uh so you're in a special category where it's uh most people
[3:26:36.800 --> 3:26:41.760]  uh evaluation you should not be vaccinated and it's not going to protect
[3:26:41.760 --> 3:26:46.400]  uh so that that would be my opinion doctor what about this spin we hear that
[3:26:46.400 --> 3:26:49.040]  before you're not supposed to vaccinate pregnant women but now
[3:26:49.040 --> 3:26:52.640]  oh that's the group that needs it first is that some attempt to make the
[3:26:52.640 --> 3:26:57.120]  vaccine look safe or why why pregnant women first
[3:26:57.120 --> 3:27:02.160]  well it was it was known some time ago that uh women who developed the flu
[3:27:02.160 --> 3:27:06.240]  during certain periods of their pregnancy have a very high incidence of
[3:27:06.240 --> 3:27:11.360]  their children becoming either autistic or developing schizophrenia when they
[3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:14.960]  get older uh you know the incidence rate is
[3:27:14.960 --> 3:27:19.280]  high as uh seven to twelve fold higher it was
[3:27:19.280 --> 3:27:22.880]  thought that that was due to the flu virus getting into the baby's nervous
[3:27:22.880 --> 3:27:26.080]  system the studies have since shown that it's not
[3:27:26.080 --> 3:27:30.160]  that at all it's the fact that mother's immune system is activated
[3:27:30.160 --> 3:27:34.960]  and the immune cytokine that enters the baby that produce the damage
[3:27:34.960 --> 3:27:38.320]  well the same information you discovered decades ago is now admitted in the
[3:27:38.320 --> 3:27:42.560]  medical journals sure and when you when you do this vaccination
[3:27:42.560 --> 3:27:46.160]  process what you're doing you're repeating that you're massively
[3:27:46.160 --> 3:27:50.640]  increasing uh the pregnant woman's uh immune
[3:27:50.640 --> 3:27:56.080]  system cytokine uh raising her baby's risk of autism or
[3:27:56.080 --> 3:28:00.000]  or uh developing uh is that because the baby
[3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:05.440]  uh own immune system attacks its nerves or yeah it activates the immune system
[3:28:05.440 --> 3:28:10.480]  in the baby's brain the micro glia uh producing a seemingly excited
[3:28:10.480 --> 3:28:14.640]  reaction uh but that's been well demonstrated even though which cytokine
[3:28:14.640 --> 3:28:19.200]  does it can look safe so they know this they
[3:28:19.200 --> 3:28:22.480]  know this and they're telling women take it
[3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:27.040]  i know and to me it's just uh you know i think it's much the same thing you
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:31.040]  could possibly do uh you know this has a very low
[3:28:31.040 --> 3:28:35.840]  communicability this this virus uh and so a woman's chance
[3:28:35.840 --> 3:28:38.400]  during pregnancy that took their age developing
[3:28:38.400 --> 3:28:41.760]  flu uh is pretty small but if you give them all the
[3:28:41.760 --> 3:28:45.200]  vaccine then it's 100 percent they're all vaccinated
[3:28:45.200 --> 3:28:48.560]  and the real dangerous thing about this vaccine they talk about giving
[3:28:48.560 --> 3:28:53.520]  free vaccines 21 days which if you know neuroscience that is particularly
[3:28:53.520 --> 3:28:57.760]  dangerous because the intent of immune activation in the brain the
[3:28:57.760 --> 3:29:02.000]  immunocytok toxicity in the mother's brain and particularly in the
[3:29:02.000 --> 3:29:05.840]  developing baby's brain is that called a cascade
[3:29:05.840 --> 3:29:10.000]  uh well it's a cytokine cascade and what happens is
[3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:14.080]  these immune cells produce so many cytokines these
[3:29:14.080 --> 3:29:19.200]  destructive immune chemicals they start destroying brain connections that
[3:29:19.200 --> 3:29:23.200]  are making the brain develop abnormally and they think that's what produces
[3:29:23.200 --> 3:29:26.800]  the autism which eugenesis birch and russell said we will give
[3:29:26.800 --> 3:29:30.080]  children injections to brain damage them to make them part of the
[3:29:30.080 --> 3:29:32.880]  servant class but i bet the government's just
[3:29:32.880 --> 3:29:36.880]  idiots they just so happen to want to target kids and women and
[3:29:36.880 --> 3:29:40.640]  people with something that brain damages them i mean this is just amazing

[3:30:12.720 --> 3:30:15.920]  chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water
[3:30:15.920 --> 3:30:19.600]  many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune
[3:30:19.600 --> 3:30:23.280]  and developmental system diseases now what are you going to do about it

[3:34:34.000 --> 3:34:37.920]  calls mike in missouri or on the air with dr blalock go ahead
[3:34:37.920 --> 3:34:42.560]  uh good afternoon alex and dr blalock
[3:34:42.560 --> 3:34:46.160]  uh... about a few years ago i had an accident
[3:34:46.160 --> 3:34:49.680]  and i became disabled i've got a spinal injury
[3:34:49.680 --> 3:34:53.440]  uh i'm in the managed care system
[3:34:53.440 --> 3:35:00.560]  uh here in st louis and i go to the uh to the med to the medical school here
[3:35:00.560 --> 3:35:06.960]  uh i've been uh taking the uh the vaccinations that they give every year
[3:35:06.960 --> 3:35:10.320]  i guess uh it's been seven or eight years now
[3:35:10.320 --> 3:35:15.440]  i've developed arthritis and i never had psoriasis before
[3:35:15.440 --> 3:35:23.360]  and my uh my question is uh psoriasis uh could could that have come from the
[3:35:23.360 --> 3:35:28.000]  uh the uh the immunization that i've been getting
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:32.080]  well it's possible because it is an autoimmune disease but psoriasis is
[3:35:32.080 --> 3:35:38.960]  associated with arthritis there is a rheumatoid arthritis syndrome
[3:35:38.960 --> 3:35:42.240]  associated with psoriasis now whether or not you just
[3:35:42.240 --> 3:35:46.960]  spontaneously develop psoriasis or the factings it's hard to tell but
[3:35:46.960 --> 3:35:51.200]  it is an autoimmune disease and we're seeing a lot of psoriasis now
[3:35:51.200 --> 3:35:55.520]  like i said all of the autoimmune diseases are increasing astronomically
[3:35:55.520 --> 3:35:58.320]  can i just add sir that if you'll search engine
[3:35:58.320 --> 3:36:02.800]  vaccines arthritis this is not dr blalock or my opinion
[3:36:02.800 --> 3:36:06.000]  they know in all the studies with rodents
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:09.040]  they get it i mean you know baby mice and rats get it
[3:36:09.040 --> 3:36:12.000]  and you're having an autoimmune response in your joints
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:17.760]  it uh this is a more important question doctor what can he do to detox
[3:36:17.760 --> 3:36:22.240]  and to he's got his immune system all cranked up uh what can he do
[3:36:22.240 --> 3:36:25.840]  before he gets diabetes before he gets real brain damage
[3:36:25.840 --> 3:36:29.600]  before i mean i mean is there something he can do to detox or to get the
[3:36:29.600 --> 3:36:33.280]  swelling down well i can't get a specific advice
[3:36:33.280 --> 3:36:37.680]  the program but just in general what you want to do is if you're having an
[3:36:37.680 --> 3:36:42.400]  autoimmune reaction you want to increase your omega-3
[3:36:42.400 --> 3:36:50.000]  oil intake there's a Norwegian oil that you can get that has a
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:53.600]  balance of the epa pha component that reduces
[3:36:53.600 --> 3:36:58.560]  this autoimmune reaction works very well for a lot of autoimmune diseases you
[3:36:58.560 --> 3:37:03.280]  just take a piece of it a day uh every day um
[3:37:03.280 --> 3:37:09.280]  but uh vitamin d3 is the most important it is an immune modulator
[3:37:09.280 --> 3:37:13.520]  it prevents uh over reactivity of the immune system
[3:37:13.520 --> 3:37:17.520]  and there's good evidence that people who have rheumatoid arthritis or
[3:37:17.520 --> 3:37:23.680]  or lupus or these other diseases uh have a deficiency in vitamin d3 you may
[3:37:23.680 --> 3:37:28.640]  have heard about multiple sclerosis and the connection to sun exposure
[3:37:28.640 --> 3:37:32.080]  you could take vitamin d3 and a dose of uh
[3:37:32.080 --> 3:37:37.120]  2000 to 5000 units a day and that can significantly reduce
[3:37:37.120 --> 3:37:42.480]  many of these autoimmune diseases and i that's a good way to prevent the
[3:37:42.480 --> 3:37:48.800]  flu uh from causing bad entry to you because when you take vitamin d3 it
[3:37:48.800 --> 3:37:51.920]  stimulates the body to produce what's called antimicrobial
[3:37:51.920 --> 3:37:56.160]  peptide and they're very powerful killing viruses bacteria
[3:37:56.160 --> 3:38:01.360]  fungi and there's evidence that people who have high vitamin d level
[3:38:01.360 --> 3:38:05.680]  rarely have any sort of bad effects from flu infections
[3:38:05.680 --> 3:38:09.920]  other types and sir isn't it showing that cancer rates go way down from people
[3:38:09.920 --> 3:38:15.360]  getting moderate sun every day yeah it's uh with elevated vitamin d3 in the
[3:38:15.360 --> 3:38:18.960]  body it's about a 50 percent reduction of a number of
[3:38:18.960 --> 3:38:23.600]  cancers particularly breast cancer prostate cancer lumb cancer
[3:38:23.600 --> 3:38:27.680]  uh and it's for the same reason because all of these things are produced for
[3:38:27.680 --> 3:38:32.320]  chronic inflammation and vitamin d3 reduces inflammation
[3:38:32.320 --> 3:38:36.720]  now vitamin d3 is the functional form of the vitamin you can buy it as
[3:38:36.720 --> 3:38:40.640]  vitamin d3 but the recommendation now is by the health
[3:38:40.640 --> 3:38:45.360]  authorities is 2000 units vitamin d3 for everybody even
[3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:49.520]  children every day and if you give it to your children you'll find they rarely
[3:38:49.520 --> 3:38:52.560]  get infections they get over their cold
[3:38:52.560 --> 3:38:56.640]  flu well i mean this goes back to and i get i'm not a biologist or a brain
[3:38:56.640 --> 3:38:58.960]  surgeon like you but just reading medical text
[3:38:58.960 --> 3:39:02.800]  i can get the essence of it but that's why they call the british limies
[3:39:02.800 --> 3:39:06.640]  because their guys weren't collapsing on the deck 10 000 miles away from home
[3:39:06.640 --> 3:39:10.960]  because they carry little limes with them that kept their collagen up because
[3:39:10.960 --> 3:39:14.640]  the vitamin c was needed with the vitamin d absorption somehow
[3:39:14.640 --> 3:39:17.680]  at a metabolic level i don't quite understand that but
[3:39:17.680 --> 3:39:21.520]  but i mean look a lot of america has scurvy we're not getting sunlight we're
[3:39:21.520 --> 3:39:24.480]  not eating good food we're eating a bunch of crud
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:27.840]  i mean in layman's terms is that good advice doctor
[3:39:27.840 --> 3:39:31.200]  yeah you know all of these vitamins interact people don't generally and a
[3:39:31.200 --> 3:39:33.920]  lot of nutritionists don't seem to understand that
[3:39:33.920 --> 3:39:37.600]  the vitamins have interactions that benefited uh
[3:39:37.600 --> 3:39:41.840]  the uh functional ability of the vitamin you take vitamin d you take vitamin
[3:39:41.840 --> 3:39:47.840]  e you take carotenoids the other b vitamin and uh selenium
[3:39:47.840 --> 3:39:52.320]  and magnesium all of these things drastically reduce all the immune
[3:39:52.320 --> 3:39:57.360]  disorders they stimulate your your healthy immunity
[3:39:57.360 --> 3:40:01.920]  to help you resist uh bacteria people that die of flu
[3:40:01.920 --> 3:40:05.920]  are generally immune suppress normal healthy
[3:40:05.920 --> 3:40:11.120]  people with good immune system uh rarely die or even get seriously ill from the
[3:40:11.120 --> 3:40:14.160]  flu uh so when you see these teenagers
[3:40:14.160 --> 3:40:17.840]  friends in the studies on this flu 32 percent of the
[3:40:17.840 --> 3:40:22.560]  children that died had asthma uh which is an immune disorder
[3:40:22.560 --> 3:40:25.760]  uh other ones have multiple illnesses diabetes
[3:40:25.760 --> 3:40:29.440]  heart disease other inflammatory but look at old folks who never get out and
[3:40:29.440 --> 3:40:33.040]  get sun well and they also have difficulty converting the
[3:40:33.040 --> 3:40:36.240]  sunlight at the vitamin d so they need to take
[3:40:36.240 --> 3:40:40.800]  uh the supplement and it's been shown that until you get above
[3:40:40.800 --> 3:40:45.440]  at least a thousand units of vitamin d three your blood levels really don't
[3:40:45.440 --> 3:40:48.880]  run uh when you're in the sun for 30 minutes
[3:40:48.880 --> 3:40:53.120]  you're getting about 10,000 20,000 units of vitamin d three
[3:40:53.120 --> 3:40:56.560]  manufactured man i love it i can have a headache be tired
[3:40:56.560 --> 3:41:00.400]  go out 30 minutes in the sun in my backyard and it's like
[3:41:00.400 --> 3:41:05.360]  energized i mean it's like a million times better than a cup of coffee
[3:41:05.360 --> 3:41:08.960]  we gotta let the doctor go here in just a few minutes mike i hope that answered
[3:41:08.960 --> 3:41:12.080]  your questions are they pushing vaccines on you when you go in to get
[3:41:12.080 --> 3:41:15.040]  medical care he dropped off i know they are
[3:41:15.040 --> 3:41:18.240]  pushing it now andrew and toronto canada you're on the air without your
[3:41:18.240 --> 3:41:21.040]  playlock
[3:41:21.040 --> 3:41:24.400]  hello yes or go ahead uh yeah i just wanted to uh
[3:41:24.400 --> 3:41:28.720]  make a comment and i tell you about a new tool i've created for the info war
[3:41:28.720 --> 3:41:32.480]  and ask a quick question the question uh in light of all the
[3:41:32.480 --> 3:41:35.920]  the denial the huge level of denial everywhere um and
[3:41:35.920 --> 3:41:39.440]  where we are at in terms of the timing of everything um
[3:41:39.440 --> 3:41:42.560]  i mean there's a lot of people that when you when you point them on to certain
[3:41:42.560 --> 3:41:46.160]  resources they just they shut off when they hear about similarities to not
[3:41:46.160 --> 3:41:49.120]  hear you i gotta jump though i can't get another service i want to jam in
[3:41:49.120 --> 3:41:52.960]  some more calls dr playlock what do you do when you even as a
[3:41:52.960 --> 3:41:56.480]  imminent brain surgeon neurologist you know your works all over the medical
[3:41:56.480 --> 3:42:00.640]  literature trailblazing you don't really to your horn on so many fronts
[3:42:00.640 --> 3:42:03.920]  i mean i i would imagine you run into people that are just doubting
[3:42:03.920 --> 3:42:07.360]  what do you say to people that just want to take shots every year
[3:42:07.360 --> 3:42:10.640]  you know want to be unhealthy want to drink aspartame
[3:42:10.640 --> 3:42:15.040]  what do you do move on to folks you can warn well that that's it you know it's
[3:42:15.040 --> 3:42:18.560]  a free country and if you want to do it then you just have to accept the
[3:42:18.560 --> 3:42:21.840]  consequences i'll present you with the evidence if you want it
[3:42:21.840 --> 3:42:25.200]  uh you can look at it you can take it or leave it and you'll
[3:42:25.200 --> 3:42:31.280]  you'll pay for ignoring it but that's the uh the benefit of a free country or
[3:42:31.280 --> 3:42:34.800]  one of the effects of a free country you know the government's the one that
[3:42:34.800 --> 3:42:38.080]  wants to force people to do things but if you want to eat hamburgers and french
[3:42:38.080 --> 3:42:43.040]  fries every day then so be it i've warned you
[3:42:43.040 --> 3:42:46.400]  so when you have your heart attack you're stroke then uh
[3:42:46.400 --> 3:42:51.600]  you can't say you weren't warned absolutely uh let's go ahead and talk
[3:42:51.600 --> 3:42:55.120]  to uh jeremy in texas jeremy you're on the air
[3:42:55.120 --> 3:43:00.000]  yeah uh dr lawton mr dunes uh everything in obama care everything
[3:43:00.000 --> 3:43:04.320]  with heaven and do with the vaccine is an extreme danger to life of property
[3:43:04.320 --> 3:43:09.520]  and i wonder your opinion and every time that we try to wake up somebody
[3:43:09.520 --> 3:43:14.720]  it will not make the news what if uh patriots across the united states begin
[3:43:14.720 --> 3:43:19.680]  flying the united states flag e inside down as a public display try to wake
[3:43:19.680 --> 3:43:22.800]  people up a lot of people are doing that and then when neighbors ask why you're
[3:43:22.800 --> 3:43:26.400]  doing it you can explain it's a country in distress that's why we've had the
[3:43:26.400 --> 3:43:30.160]  poster contest that we're extending entries out till next tuesday
[3:43:30.160 --> 3:43:34.880]  where people put up posters of political ideas and then videotape it the contest
[3:43:34.880 --> 3:43:39.440]  is you got a videotape it and and get that submission into us
[3:43:39.440 --> 3:43:44.000]  uh and uh it's having a great effect look what we did with the obama joker
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:47.680]  poster nationwide that probably made it in
[3:43:47.680 --> 3:43:54.400]  conservatively that i've seen 60 70 80 probably more newspapers
[3:43:54.400 --> 3:44:00.480]  uh from tokyo to los angeles tv stations covering it
[3:44:00.480 --> 3:44:03.600]  uh that's just what our listeners did so yes
[3:44:03.600 --> 3:44:09.440]  uh we need to somehow dr blalock uh i wanted to take medical questions for
[3:44:09.440 --> 3:44:11.920]  you so many of these are on other subjects let's let's talk to pat in
[3:44:11.920 --> 3:44:15.360]  ohio pat do you have a medical question for dr blalock
[3:44:15.360 --> 3:44:20.720]  yes hello ellison dr blalock uh my mom she suffers from alzheimer and in the
[3:44:20.720 --> 3:44:25.520]  past month she's been really regressing and need to know is there any top of
[3:44:25.520 --> 3:44:30.000]  martin day technology that can can help to improve her condition
[3:44:30.000 --> 3:44:34.080]  and i just realized in the contact number i do exercise with her but
[3:44:34.080 --> 3:44:37.440]  she's gotten to the point where she won't even eat now unless i feed her or
[3:44:37.440 --> 3:44:42.080]  someone feeds her she gets into a sleep a stupor like
[3:44:42.080 --> 3:44:47.520]  and um that's what i need i need a contact number also telephone number
[3:44:47.520 --> 3:44:53.120]  a telephone number for her dr blalock oh i don't see patients any longer
[3:44:53.120 --> 3:44:58.640]  um well you know alzheimer's disease is a an inflammatory brain disease is the
[3:44:58.640 --> 3:45:02.800]  chronic brain inflammation when the elderly are getting really sleepy it
[3:45:02.800 --> 3:45:07.120]  means their the brain is more in frame
[3:45:07.680 --> 3:45:11.040]  and as they as the alzheimer patient reaches toward the
[3:45:11.040 --> 3:45:16.640]  the end of the of the disease uh there's a lot of loss of cells as well as
[3:45:16.640 --> 3:45:22.000]  connection that the only thing that i know uh that i
[3:45:22.000 --> 3:45:25.360]  generally recommend for people with alzheimer's
[3:45:25.360 --> 3:45:29.680]  drastically increase your vitamin d and take because that's the best way to
[3:45:29.680 --> 3:45:33.840]  reduce your brain inflammation magnesium the fish oil
[3:45:33.840 --> 3:45:38.000]  uh all your mother on magnesium and fish oil and vitamin d ma'am

[3:45:44.080 --> 3:45:49.600]  and fish it fish oil and uh uh there's a variety of stuff um she's not drinking
[3:45:49.600 --> 3:45:54.640]  diet coke or eating no no no she drinks just juice mainly water a lot of water

[3:46:06.000 --> 3:46:10.080]  going from what i've heard doctors say at a point
[3:46:10.080 --> 3:46:14.640]  doctored isn't it just the brain loss is so great that it's a downward spiral
[3:46:14.640 --> 3:46:18.640]  yeah when you see people who have alzheimer's their their brain immune
[3:46:18.640 --> 3:46:23.920]  reaction far exceed normal age and as the disease progresses the
[3:46:23.920 --> 3:46:28.720]  inflammatory reaction increases uh and the glutamate in the brain
[3:46:28.720 --> 3:46:32.560]  starts elevating and and uh brain becomes more sensitive
[3:46:32.560 --> 3:46:37.040]  for anything to reduce brain inflammation is the main thing
[3:46:37.040 --> 3:46:41.600]  uh you know i don't want to hold my supplement but i have this supplement

[3:47:35.520 --> 3:47:40.800]  yeah it's painful taking phone calls like that one um
[3:47:40.800 --> 3:47:45.120]  i want to i want to come back and hit a little bit on the van jones thing
[3:47:45.120 --> 3:47:49.440]  because they're trying to tie in the 9-11 truth and i waited to go to calls
[3:47:49.440 --> 3:47:52.640]  i'll have blaylock back into two hours just with calls
[3:47:52.640 --> 3:47:55.120]  and i wasn't trying to be mean to callers i hung up on but i just can't talk
[3:47:55.120 --> 3:47:58.240]  about other subjects when he's on because i'm talking about the brain right
[3:47:58.240 --> 3:48:01.280]  now i wanted to bring Ted Anderson up the
[3:48:01.280 --> 3:48:04.080]  next two minutes before we come back to the final segment though and
[3:48:04.080 --> 3:48:08.080]  because i want to explain this Ted has gold and silver
[3:48:08.080 --> 3:48:14.000]  he sold out of the stuff he bought between 905 and 916 the gold when gold
[3:48:14.000 --> 3:48:17.520]  was at that price now gold's right up at 1,000 today
[3:48:17.520 --> 3:48:21.760]  he sold out of that but he made more buys last week when it was at the 9
[3:48:21.760 --> 3:48:27.280]  20 to 940 level so you're already you're still buying gold and silver
[3:48:27.280 --> 3:48:30.880]  when at a cheaper price and it's currently selling i mean i want to explain
[3:48:30.880 --> 3:48:34.880]  this is a super good deal that's why we're offering this right now
[3:48:34.880 --> 3:48:39.440]  because the gold market is ultra hot i was watching cnbc this morning they were
[3:48:39.440 --> 3:48:42.080]  saying oh my gosh gold's just gonna explode now
[3:48:42.080 --> 3:48:45.840]  that makes me think it may not because they're saying it but the point is
[3:48:45.840 --> 3:48:51.280]  is that you win win win win win i mean when Ted's normally selling this gold
[3:48:51.280 --> 3:48:54.800]  you know uh when the market didn't even up there's a tiny like four dollar
[3:48:54.800 --> 3:48:58.320]  markup on a 225 dollar coin i mean i've seen that Ted's already
[3:48:58.320 --> 3:49:01.280]  selling it super cheap but when the market goes up
[3:49:01.280 --> 3:49:04.720]  he's selling it to you from when he bought it at a lower price at the same
[3:49:04.720 --> 3:49:07.520]  price but this gold and silver he told me will
[3:49:07.520 --> 3:49:10.560]  run out in the next day or two so he's going to hold this deal through the
[3:49:10.560 --> 3:49:13.120]  weekend even though Ted told me he lost some money
[3:49:13.120 --> 3:49:16.240]  yesterday because he actually ran out of gold at the one price he had but he's
[3:49:16.240 --> 3:49:20.160]  just selling you gold at a lower price that he even bought it
[3:49:20.160 --> 3:49:23.520]  now Ted's had to quit that deal today but it's still a super good deal
[3:49:23.520 --> 3:49:27.120]  this deal's about to end Ted tell folks what you've got and give them the
[3:49:27.120 --> 3:49:30.000]  number yeah the coins that i have they're still
[3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:33.360]  priced at the lowest level that i picked up here recently
[3:49:33.360 --> 3:49:37.120]  are the are the walking liberty half silver pieces
[3:49:37.120 --> 3:49:41.280]  it's silver but it's silver it's still at a good buy 869 i mean silver's over
[3:49:41.280 --> 3:49:44.960]  16 dollars an ounce now the goal that i have right now is the 10
[3:49:44.960 --> 3:49:49.760]  dollar liberty and they're at 818 the place to get in contact with this is

[3:50:14.320 --> 3:50:19.200]  and all i can say alex right now is that gold is breaking upward
[3:50:19.200 --> 3:50:23.200]  it's had a lot of resistance at that 940 945 level
[3:50:23.200 --> 3:50:27.440]  everybody's looking for gold to break through a thousand dollars an ounce
[3:50:27.440 --> 3:50:31.280]  i can't see how it won't do that it may correct a little bit here and there

[3:54:32.480 --> 3:54:37.120]  we got gauge popping in to start debunking the
[3:54:37.120 --> 3:54:43.600]  thing the Arabs funded out of Mumbai they're openly funding all of uh
[3:54:43.600 --> 3:54:48.240]  nasa geographic and saudi arabia and that whole
[3:54:48.240 --> 3:54:52.160]  Arab Emirates over there is deeply involved with the globalist
[3:54:52.160 --> 3:54:56.000]  so we're going to debunk the ridiculous debunking they did i mean
[3:54:56.000 --> 3:55:00.480]  they say the commission was unanimous the official story has never changed
[3:55:00.480 --> 3:55:04.560]  but the conspiracy theorist story has changed we just we
[3:55:04.560 --> 3:55:08.480]  had did an analysis and we noticed seven of the 10 commission members
[3:55:08.480 --> 3:55:12.800]  said it was a fraud and a lie but that's hardly anywhere in the media but we
[3:55:12.800 --> 3:55:16.160]  found all their quotes seven of the 10 say it's a fraud
[3:55:16.160 --> 3:55:19.760]  yeah your story stayed the same there's a key story up on
[3:55:19.760 --> 3:55:23.520]  prisonplanet.com that everybody needs to see what
[3:55:23.520 --> 3:55:26.960]  they're doing is they're introducing national compulsory service to us by
[3:55:26.960 --> 3:55:30.000]  wearing us out yeah the president's going to address
[3:55:30.000 --> 3:55:33.680]  the youth and ask for your help yeah he's going to be on big telescreens in
[3:55:33.680 --> 3:55:36.560]  front of the kids yeah he's going to ask him to write
[3:55:36.560 --> 3:55:40.560]  letters about how they can help him and al gore is out saying
[3:55:40.560 --> 3:55:43.280]  don't listen to your parents on global warming they're idiots and we played
[3:55:43.280 --> 3:55:46.080]  those clips and obama's calling for compulsory
[3:55:46.080 --> 3:55:50.080]  service and speeches and his rama manual is a meanwhile george soros
[3:55:50.080 --> 3:55:53.600]  and Rockefeller funded media matters openly fund those groups
[3:55:53.600 --> 3:55:59.360]  are saying we're liars none of it exists insulting your intelligence okay when
[3:55:59.360 --> 3:56:03.280]  the bills are introduced and one bill passed to set up the federal boards
[3:56:03.280 --> 3:56:07.200]  we have a whole bunch of videos here posted in this article
[3:56:07.200 --> 3:56:10.880]  paul watson posted where the kids are pledging allegiance to obama
[3:56:10.880 --> 3:56:16.080]  worshiping him doing whatever he says
[3:56:16.080 --> 3:56:21.920]  the feds are taking over health care manufacturing industry van jones their
[3:56:21.920 --> 3:56:25.200]  green jobs are says we're going to do this
[3:56:25.200 --> 3:56:28.720]  incrementally we played the clip yesterday we're going to have total
[3:56:28.720 --> 3:56:31.840]  communism we're going to have total collectivism
[3:56:31.840 --> 3:56:34.960]  we're going to have total total is the quote
[3:56:34.960 --> 3:56:38.640]  redistribution of wealth but that means into the elite bankers hands the
[3:56:38.640 --> 3:56:42.400]  bankers have created not even with interest
[3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:47.280]  23.7 trillion and counting in in 10 months of debt they say we owe we give
[3:56:47.280 --> 3:56:52.480]  them the money and then we pay them interest on money we give them
[3:56:52.480 --> 3:56:56.160]  so they've got to have total takeover of society
[3:56:56.160 --> 3:56:59.440]  and health care to get that tax money and you're not going to get the health
[3:56:59.440 --> 3:57:03.840]  care you're going to get eugenics we've got to up our game against these people
[3:57:03.840 --> 3:57:06.160]  we're having an effect but i'm telling you
[3:57:06.160 --> 3:57:09.920]  obama is plunging and burning he's going to stage terror attacks he's going to
[3:57:09.920 --> 3:57:14.400]  stage something big and maybe the flu i'm not sure but just look out
[3:57:14.400 --> 3:57:19.040]  keep your ears on your eyes open get ready because i'm telling you the
[3:57:19.040 --> 3:57:21.760]  enemies moving on every front and they're in trouble
[3:57:21.760 --> 3:57:24.960]  that makes them even more dangerous but we can't lay down let them run over us
[3:57:24.960 --> 3:57:29.120]  we got a head up give them the fight 110 percent just commit to the fight
[3:57:29.120 --> 3:57:33.840]  that's the end of it go all the way don't stop and
[3:57:33.840 --> 3:57:39.120]  notice they demonize van jones properly he did deserve it
