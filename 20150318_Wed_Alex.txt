[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he

[00:20.760 --> 00:35.200]  welcome my friends welcome to this live worldwide broadcast Wednesday the 18th day
[00:35.200 --> 00:41.160]  of March 2015 I'm your host Alex Jones William Benny the highest level NSA
[00:41.160 --> 00:49.920]  whistleblower ever who was SWAT team rated after he spoke to Congress and who
[00:49.920 --> 00:56.760]  has since vindicated will be joining us in studio here in Austin Texas today
[00:57.240 --> 01:01.960]  we're also going to be talking to the head of the organic consumers
[01:01.960 --> 01:07.160]  Association Catherine Paul their organization was set to speak at a major
[01:07.160 --> 01:12.760]  event about food quality and safety of South by Southwest but big pharma and
[01:12.760 --> 01:19.600]  big biotech Monsanto connected groups had anyone not just their organization
[01:19.600 --> 01:25.320]  that was already set six months ago to speak banned gene giant kicks OCA off
[01:25.320 --> 01:32.840]  South by Southwest food panel discussion so the shows what a totalitarian
[01:32.840 --> 01:38.440]  sanitized anti-human event this is and why I've been going after it every day
[01:38.440 --> 01:42.680]  here as it's a showcase of how the globalist propagandize and try to shape
[01:42.680 --> 01:48.600]  culture that said we knew this was coming when they kept the FCC
[01:48.600 --> 01:53.720]  regulation secret when they wouldn't testify before Congress and now we've
[01:53.720 --> 02:00.040]  got the 400 pages FCC chairman concedes and there's video that future internet
[02:00.040 --> 02:06.000]  taxes possible after all and the FCC's proposed those before the FCC's try to
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.280]  take over the internet before they've proposed things but they want cable all
[02:11.280 --> 02:17.200]  telecommunications and they got big back lashes but then when they came forward
[02:17.200 --> 02:22.480]  as the saviors and George Soros funded 196 million all the fake leftist groups
[02:22.480 --> 02:26.680]  why then it was racist literally according to them if you didn't hand over
[02:26.680 --> 02:31.160]  the internet to the government and the corporations that control it the
[02:31.160 --> 02:37.720]  ultimate Trojan horsey that's just some of the news a backyard burger and wiener
[02:37.720 --> 02:42.920]  roast targeted by EPA told you they're banning fireplaces and outdoor roast in
[02:42.920 --> 02:47.000]  Europe now it's happening in the United States also EPA wants to monitor how
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.120]  long hotel guests spend in the shower make that up
[02:54.760 --> 03:00.400]  meanwhile Detroit businesses face water shutoffs even if you try to pay for it
[03:00.400 --> 03:04.480]  this is this is all part of the deindustrialization program there'll
[03:04.480 --> 03:09.240]  be no shortage of cream and other goodies up in the globalist command
[03:09.240 --> 03:17.200]  centers continuing white privilege conference workshop pushes grade school
[03:17.200 --> 03:24.080]  that's K through fifth grade lessons about gender queer transgender and gender
[03:24.080 --> 03:31.480]  fluids and try let's teach the first graders about things I can't even say
[03:31.480 --> 03:37.080]  on the air and wouldn't want to say on air and then we've got just more police
[03:37.080 --> 03:42.040]  videos being released this one of a woman already being tortured begging for
[03:42.040 --> 03:46.760]  help so the so the sergeant starts choking her and then they did
[03:46.760 --> 03:51.720]  investigation and said he acted admirably this is a society breaking down
[03:51.720 --> 03:57.360]  when they defend this type of torture that they call pain compliance and you
[03:57.360 --> 04:02.880]  watch the video the cops are all getting off on it these are bad people in my
[04:02.880 --> 04:08.320]  view very shameful and defending it if you're a cop will help bring down the
[04:08.320 --> 04:12.440]  country which is part of the globalist larger plan in really big economic news
[04:12.440 --> 04:17.000]  again I'm to detail all the things I mentioned when we come back China
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.520]  gaining Western allies as development bank partners a blow to US efforts and

[08:51.360 --> 08:54.880]  whatever you understand you're living in a science fiction I'm living in the
[08:54.880 --> 08:58.160]  government has just approved the use of a computer chip that would be implanted
[08:58.160 --> 09:03.040]  under your skin when complete everyone will have a unique 12-digit identity

[09:14.000 --> 09:17.440]  will this makes my head explode that your television could be e-dropping on
[09:17.440 --> 09:22.000]  your conversations and then sharing it over the web all the cars now have
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.520]  tracker boxes that can remote control your vehicle in them the Justice
[09:25.520 --> 09:29.520]  Department is building a national database to track in real-time the
[09:29.520 --> 09:33.240]  movement of vehicles around the US storing hundreds of millions of
[09:33.240 --> 09:36.720]  records about motorists it's like the elite are space aliens or something
[09:36.720 --> 09:41.080]  with a master plan it's so evil it's so sadistic no it's the devil I mean
[09:41.080 --> 09:47.200]  that's it this galactic force of destruction that's animating people to
[09:47.200 --> 09:58.160]  do this the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[09:58.960 --> 10:03.720]  ladies and gentlemen we are live broadcasting worldwide from Austin
[10:03.720 --> 10:10.040]  Texas it is Wednesday the 18th day of March 2015 I'm your host Alex Jones the
[10:10.040 --> 10:17.120]  highest level whistleblower pretty much ever not just from the NSA but
[10:17.120 --> 10:22.600]  from the federal government in the last hundred years in my summation is William
[10:22.600 --> 10:29.240]  Benny was one of the top guys at the National Security Agency directed much
[10:29.240 --> 10:34.400]  of their technology systems he of course in the last decade quietly tried to
[10:34.400 --> 10:38.640]  warn Congress and others within the system got SWAT team got attacked you
[10:38.640 --> 10:43.240]  name it he is here in Austin Texas he was here for South by Southwest he
[10:43.240 --> 10:45.840]  agreed to stay an extra day to be in studio with us we're going to be
[10:45.840 --> 10:50.240]  interviewing him for some documentary reports we're putting together and live
[10:50.240 --> 10:54.160]  in studio in the third hour in fact maybe we should do a document cam or a
[10:54.160 --> 10:58.720]  studio cam shot for TV viewers and show folks William Benny in there in the
[10:58.720 --> 11:04.120]  control room watching the show right now and again he'll be in studio with us
[11:04.120 --> 11:11.440]  coming up in the third hour today so I am extremely excited about that there's
[11:11.440 --> 11:14.640]  William Benny right there we can punch him up him a little bit of a round of
[11:14.640 --> 11:20.920]  applause if you are a radio listener you can go to info wars.com forward slash
[11:20.920 --> 11:26.880]  show to see the free video feeds right there to add another dimension to the
[11:26.880 --> 11:30.520]  radio broadcast but this is a radio broadcast first and foremost probably
[11:30.520 --> 11:37.960]  90% of our audience is terrestrial AM and FM radio but we have a large audience
[11:37.960 --> 11:42.240]  as well watching over the internet and some cable and TV systems around the
[11:42.240 --> 11:45.480]  United States and it adds another dimension to it because our radio
[11:45.480 --> 11:50.960]  listeners can then go actually see what we're talking about here on air when we
[11:50.960 --> 11:56.680]  deploy reporters to Europe or to Asia or to Latin America or to right here in
[11:56.680 --> 12:01.480]  Austin Texas to be covering the different developments here at South by
[12:01.480 --> 12:06.600]  Southwest we've already seen a protest against the rise of AI systems
[12:06.600 --> 12:11.000]  suppressing humanity that story went national we covered over the weekend and
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.800]  we're also of course covering the fact that it's not just the NSA illegally
[12:14.800 --> 12:18.440]  spying on people it's Google it's Microsoft it's all the big companies
[12:18.440 --> 12:22.200]  have been caught doing it and they don't get in trouble and that's because it's
[12:22.200 --> 12:28.760]  part of a revolution a a a overall culture of corruption to just change the
[12:28.760 --> 12:34.560]  way this planet operates and I'm not so much worried myself about artificial
[12:34.560 --> 12:39.200]  intelligence coming after us at this time I'm worried about the fact that human
[12:39.200 --> 12:44.920]  intelligence is what is controlling and basically pulling the strings on the
[12:44.920 --> 12:50.120]  Panopticon surveillance grid they've got all these movies coming out robo
[12:50.120 --> 12:57.120]  apocalypse if we have the rider on I think Friday where it's basically a
[12:57.120 --> 13:01.840]  expansion of maximum overdrive where the appliances and the cars start killing
[13:01.840 --> 13:04.920]  everybody well I'm not really worried about that I'm worried about the fact
[13:04.920 --> 13:08.920]  of the appliance the cars the smart meters the cell phones the Hertz rent a
[13:08.920 --> 13:15.960]  car the Samsung TVs admit that they're watching and listening to us this is
[13:15.960 --> 13:22.120]  just a hidden in plain view revolution against privacy and the data being
[13:22.120 --> 13:27.320]  gathered can be used to manipulate mass markets and mass human movements because
[13:27.320 --> 13:31.080]  if you can surveil everything you can also add stimulus and then control
[13:31.080 --> 13:35.920]  everything including predicting the future to a great extent and Google
[13:35.920 --> 13:40.120]  admits that that's its main mission is to predict the future and be an AI system
[13:40.120 --> 13:44.920]  so we're going to talk to William Benny about this in detail we're going to put
[13:44.920 --> 13:50.000]  out a hashtag in the next few minutes I haven't given what that hashtag is yet
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.160]  we were developing that right before the show started so you can tweet your
[13:54.160 --> 13:58.360]  questions at real Alex Jones and so that we have those questions ahead of time
[13:58.360 --> 14:03.720]  before mr. Benny joins us in studio so tweet your questions at real Alex Jones
[14:03.720 --> 14:07.440]  won't give him will put a hashtag out on that site here in the next few minutes
[14:07.440 --> 14:12.560]  so everybody can do that but there's the info wars comm crew and go to that
[14:12.560 --> 14:17.760]  wide shot there I'm in here directing today and so folks can see our hard
[14:17.760 --> 14:23.480]  working information warfare elves in there and quietly in the back William
[14:23.480 --> 14:29.320]  Benny a very very exciting to have him here in the info wars news studios
[14:29.320 --> 14:37.080]  Keth Green Paul will be joining us she's the head of organic consumers org one
[14:37.080 --> 14:43.120]  of the largest organizations reporting on and doing studies on and organizing
[14:43.120 --> 14:47.760]  for the organic choices in this country they've been set up for months to speak
[14:47.760 --> 14:54.580]  at South by Southwest and with Whole Foods but big pharma and big agra did
[14:54.580 --> 14:58.560]  not want that so they've been banned we'll talk about what our presentation was
[14:58.560 --> 15:02.600]  going to be and what their organizations presentation was going to be before
[15:02.600 --> 15:06.960]  they were banned and exactly who banned them that story is up on info wars comm
[15:06.960 --> 15:14.000]  gene giant kicks OCA off South by Southwest food panel discussion and the
[15:14.000 --> 15:20.000]  new push by the FDA and the EPA is to not label anything and even remove drug
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.720]  labels and vaccine labels so that we can't hold up an MMR vaccine label when
[15:25.720 --> 15:28.880]  they say it's safe and effective and show you where it says it can give you
[15:28.880 --> 15:33.640]  epilepsy narcolepsy cancer where it says it could kill you where it says it
[15:33.640 --> 15:38.140]  could cause a pancreatitis and then diabetes it actually says that and we
[15:38.140 --> 15:42.240]  showed that a lot the last few weeks that will no longer be available under
[15:42.240 --> 15:49.120]  the new legislation so there's a major push to shut down information and then
[15:49.120 --> 15:53.960]  to persecute people like William Benny who left the NSA back in 2001 when they
[15:53.960 --> 15:57.600]  started illegal spying against the American people and non-terror related
[15:57.600 --> 16:04.040]  operations and he quietly worked through the system but it just didn't matter
[16:04.040 --> 16:07.640]  they still came after him but he defeated that others have not many people are
[16:07.640 --> 16:11.880]  languishing including journalists in jail right now for telling the public
[16:11.880 --> 16:16.600]  things that they had a duty to tell us because they were illegal but we've
[16:16.600 --> 16:21.080]  gone from them under George Bush in 2005 or so denying that they spied on
[16:21.080 --> 16:25.080]  anybody illegally to now just throwing it in our face so where is this
[16:25.080 --> 16:30.360]  revolution against privacy going we'll be discussing that okay here's some of
[16:30.360 --> 16:36.600]  the other news up on info wars dot com you can't make this up the story is from
[16:36.600 --> 16:41.960]  raw story a Democratic Party-run organization leftist media claims if
[16:41.960 --> 16:47.160]  you support second amendment you support rape the headline actually says more
[16:47.160 --> 16:52.120]  guns on campus means rapist can rape women more no guns on campus would mean
[16:52.120 --> 16:56.560]  women would shoot rapist in areas where concealed carry goes in rape and robbery
[16:56.560 --> 17:01.280]  and things like carjacking go down massively in fact just show people the
[17:01.280 --> 17:06.840]  FBI headlines and the LA Times headline gun crime drops but perception is
[17:06.840 --> 17:12.200]  there's more it's dropped by 52% according to the unified crime statistics of
[17:12.200 --> 17:16.520]  the Justice Department since 1992 rapes have dropped in every state where gun
[17:16.520 --> 17:20.760]  ownership is proliferated women carrying guns and fanny packs in Florida
[17:20.760 --> 17:24.160]  they've had major articles there has caused basically women being raped in
[17:24.160 --> 17:30.920]  parks to go down to almost zero but they say that no don't want Obamacare you

[24:12.840 --> 24:16.560]  the show with William Benny in there biggest government whistleblower pretty
[24:16.560 --> 24:22.360]  much of all time and all all these questions were coming up with to discuss
[24:22.360 --> 24:26.720]  once he's in here in studio with us it's really exciting what's happening he's
[24:26.720 --> 24:31.040]  seeing a lot of people finally get it a huge awakening taking place he was just
[24:31.040 --> 24:36.000]  in Munich Germany with Oliver Stone who is going to do an interview with Snowden
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.080]  for an upcoming huge film he was just here at South by Southwest giving
[24:41.080 --> 24:45.120]  speeches and saw a huge response so there's a lot of positive things happening
[24:45.120 --> 24:49.320]  they tried to put him in prison they tried to shut him down but he's here
[24:49.320 --> 24:54.680]  taking action and that is so exciting that's the best part about having this
[24:54.680 --> 24:59.680]  job is that I get to be around such amazing people such amazing heroes you
[24:59.680 --> 25:05.080]  know the average person would get around Kobe Bryant or LeBron James or Brett
[25:05.080 --> 25:09.920]  Farve or somebody and start shaking in their shoes I could care less great you
[25:09.920 --> 25:14.480]  throw a basketball and a hoop you can play football wonderful but people that
[25:14.480 --> 25:18.320]  face prison people that go through persecution people that give up you
[25:18.320 --> 25:22.760]  know directorships and a whole section of the NSA to tell the truth and then the
[25:22.760 --> 25:26.560]  system tries to suppress them and tries to keep them from the public view and
[25:26.560 --> 25:35.600]  then the system fails that is just incredibly incredibly exciting on so
[25:35.600 --> 25:41.840]  many fronts and so we're here today to shoot a little mini documentary with
[25:41.840 --> 25:46.680]  Mr. Benny and then again we're gonna have him live in studio with us but
[25:46.680 --> 25:53.160]  before we go any further let me just say that I'm also going to be opening the
[25:53.160 --> 26:01.360]  phones up in the next segment specifically on this piece of news
[26:01.360 --> 26:06.240]  Pentagon loses track I mentioned this in the last segment of 500 million in
[26:06.240 --> 26:10.000]  weapons equipment given to Yemen the Washington Post reports it's the same
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.160]  story over and over again oh we lost track in Iraq oh we lost track in Saudi
[26:13.160 --> 26:17.360]  Arabia oh we lost track in Qatar oh we lost track in Yemen oh we lost track oh
[26:17.360 --> 26:22.400]  oh Turkey's giving artillery support to this free Syrian army which is really
[26:22.400 --> 26:28.680]  al-Qaeda and ISIS oh but now we're buddies with Assad and want to defeat
[26:28.680 --> 26:35.880]  them and our buddies with Iran and that leads us to the next story Iran
[26:35.880 --> 26:41.160]  Hezbollah this is out of our team it's posted on infowars.com Iran and Hezbollah
[26:41.160 --> 26:46.560]  Hezbollah is their militia worldwide fighting force Iran Hezbollah left us
[26:46.560 --> 26:54.720]  off US terror threat listing so Iran and Hezbollah have been left off US terror
[26:54.720 --> 26:59.360]  threat listing now listen I don't want war with Iran I don't support some of
[26:59.360 --> 27:04.120]  those moves to do that but the same time if you're going to list conservative
[27:04.120 --> 27:07.280]  libertarian groups as extremists and with terrorists if you're gonna train the
[27:07.280 --> 27:12.000]  Pentagon to take on land rights activists if you're set up Homeland
[27:12.000 --> 27:19.280]  Security supposedly deal with Hezbollah and Hamas who do target civilians you
[27:19.280 --> 27:22.920]  could argue that they are in the terrorist class but to remove the big
[27:22.920 --> 27:29.200]  enchilada Hezbollah from the list shows just how bizarre all of this has
[27:29.200 --> 27:34.600]  really gotten but don't worry their FBI task forces nationwide harassing gun
[27:34.600 --> 27:38.520]  shows with the ATF trying to find out of an old guy goes and sells sort of his
[27:38.520 --> 27:42.320]  guns to raise money I see these cases all the time it's almost always some 75
[27:42.320 --> 27:47.080]  80 year old guy his wife's died in one case we covered he's he's going bankrupt
[27:47.080 --> 27:51.240]  he's got to have surgery he goes in to sell eight nine guns he's had for decades
[27:51.240 --> 27:54.680]  he's not a federal firearms dealer it's legal for him to sell him because he's
[27:54.680 --> 27:58.240]  not a dealer he's just getting rid of personal guns and they arresting they
[27:58.240 --> 28:02.720]  railroad them they and died of and have a federal kangaroo jury send them to
[28:02.720 --> 28:10.520]  prison and they die in prison but Hezbollah is not terrorist and oh we
[28:10.520 --> 28:15.880]  can come up missing 500 million dollars in weapons in Yemen and I've seen this
[28:15.880 --> 28:19.760]  type of story no exaggeration 500 times or more this is a judicial watch
[28:19.760 --> 28:24.240]  judicial watch gets records that show al-qaeda terrorist may have been
[28:24.240 --> 28:28.480]  government source judicial watches obtained records at the Florida
[28:28.480 --> 28:31.920]  Department of law enforcement that indicate al-qaeda terrorists who help
[28:31.920 --> 28:35.440]  plan several US attacks including plots to blow up Oprah Winfrey studios and
[28:35.440 --> 28:39.640]  detonate nuclear devices in multiple US cities was a confidential source
[28:39.640 --> 28:43.400]  informant for the government well of course most of these guys are and
[28:43.400 --> 28:46.440]  probably never planned any of this they just burned him I mean you really
[28:46.440 --> 28:50.840]  believe this guy had nukes come out in the New York Times and almost every
[28:50.840 --> 28:56.000]  terror attack that they've cooked up has been with a mentally ill person or some
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.880]  patsy who was an informant who they say yeah take the bomb over here and then
[28:59.880 --> 29:04.960]  they they set them up I'm not saying there aren't radical Islamists or
[29:04.960 --> 29:09.560]  terrorists oh there are and they're under the employ the West the West works
[29:09.560 --> 29:14.240]  with them to destabilize and and they use their threat as a way to take
[29:14.240 --> 29:19.280]  liberties and promote illegal spying but when it comes to people they bust they
[29:19.280 --> 29:23.040]  don't throw away good terrorists they could be used they only bust patsy's and
[29:23.040 --> 29:27.240]  chumps and fools so listen if you're an Arab American or Muslim American or
[29:27.240 --> 29:32.080]  Brit or whatever I've seen this literally hundreds of times if you get
[29:32.080 --> 29:36.800]  approached to be part of a drill of Muslims bombing something do not be
[29:36.800 --> 29:40.560]  part of it because believe me you're gonna end up in the Supermax prison so

[34:51.520 --> 35:00.520]  universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act and again William Benny
[35:00.520 --> 35:05.520]  biggest whistleblower in modern history not just biggest NSA whistleblower is here
[35:05.520 --> 35:08.520]  and he was in the control room of great gentlemen but I had even moved to the
[35:08.520 --> 35:11.520]  conference room because it was so distracting to me but look at the monitor
[35:11.520 --> 35:15.520]  and see William Benny in there plus the crew I mean this is like having a movie
[35:15.520 --> 35:19.520]  star here for us you know we've had a lot of movie stars on the show they're
[35:19.520 --> 35:22.520]  great people a lot of them are patriots we've had on using their celebrity to
[35:22.520 --> 35:26.520]  expose tyranny but I'm a lot more excited about William Benny being here
[35:26.520 --> 35:31.520]  than some of the top celebrity stars I've gotten to know over the years because
[35:31.520 --> 35:37.520]  this guy they tried to put him in prison they tried to ruin his life he basically
[35:37.520 --> 35:40.520]  resigned because they wouldn't stop illegal spying he tried for a decade in the
[35:40.520 --> 35:44.520]  system to get him to stop it and then they came after him when he was doing
[35:44.520 --> 35:49.520]  it inside the system so this is a tyranny and if William Benny can be
[35:49.520 --> 35:53.520]  destroyed we can all be destroyed but if he can be vindicated which he has been
[35:53.520 --> 35:59.520]  and not be stopped from getting his message out it is a huge battle of
[35:59.520 --> 36:04.520]  Trenton level victory when we got to UN documents five years ago that the
[36:04.520 --> 36:08.520]  carbon tax was a plan to shut down the third world in the first world and only
[36:08.520 --> 36:12.520]  let's select corporations operate we got the secret treaty and it became
[36:12.520 --> 36:18.520]  national news we had Lord Moncton on that was a huge critical death star
[36:18.520 --> 36:24.520]  destroying event well people like William Benny and Snowden going public is
[36:24.520 --> 36:29.520]  another potential death star event to use a Star Wars allegory where you blow
[36:29.520 --> 36:35.520]  up a major criminal operation and degrade and frustrate criminal forces
[36:35.520 --> 36:41.520]  in government and corporations that want to use ubiquitous spying to
[36:41.520 --> 36:46.520]  dominate markets but also protect themselves from criminal prosecution to
[36:46.520 --> 36:50.520]  be aware of what other areas and other agencies are doing we've now learned
[36:50.520 --> 36:53.520]  that the parliament and the congress and the senate and the president and
[36:53.520 --> 36:59.520]  they're all spying on each other it's a it's a panopticonic big brother arms
[36:59.520 --> 37:04.520]  race that we're in the middle of right now that's being deployed against the
[37:04.520 --> 37:09.520]  people and it's wrong so again I go off into that subject because it's so
[37:09.520 --> 37:15.520]  important and I just read to you three different mainstream news articles
[37:15.520 --> 37:19.520]  where our government and other groups are funding and protecting known
[37:19.520 --> 37:27.520]  terrorist from al Qaeda to the Iranian Hezbollah to other organizations why
[37:27.520 --> 37:37.520]  are they doing it all the NSA spine all the illegal garbage we still had 9-11
[37:37.520 --> 37:40.520]  that we learned the NSA was actually tracking them legally in that case
[37:40.520 --> 37:43.520]  because they were foreigners and that nothing was done with it the FBI knew
[37:43.520 --> 37:48.520]  was ordered to stand down I've interviewed colonel Schaefer and others
[37:48.520 --> 37:52.520]  listen to colonel Schaefer who was there and watch the communication saw the
[37:52.520 --> 37:57.520]  same stuff that Siebel Edmonds another FBI translator whistleblowing on NSA
[37:57.520 --> 38:03.520]  information where our government was in command at higher levels basically of
[38:03.520 --> 38:07.520]  al Qaeda and protecting them and giving them arms and laundering money
[38:07.520 --> 38:12.520]  everything she first broke her gag order on this show five six years ago and
[38:12.520 --> 38:19.520]  on other shows that she was attacked for is now passe so now we've reached that
[38:19.520 --> 38:25.520]  Rubicon moment where it's out in the open what do we do I'm gonna ask
[38:25.520 --> 38:29.520]  William Benny about this coming up the third hour what is this paradox like
[38:29.520 --> 38:32.520]  to have them years ago deny this was happening when he knew good and well
[38:32.520 --> 38:36.520]  it was he was there at the highest level seeing it and then to now have them go
[38:36.520 --> 38:40.520]  okay we're doing it but we're gonna reform it by legalizing we're gonna
[38:40.520 --> 38:44.520]  retroactively go back and say it's okay that we committed these crimes I mean
[38:44.520 --> 38:49.520]  Obama yesterday put out a directive not a law president can't make law saying
[38:49.520 --> 38:53.520]  we're now exempt from all four year request period really that's the
[38:53.520 --> 38:59.520]  National Security Act of 47 and they dovetailed whether the open records act
[38:59.520 --> 39:04.520]  so that if you're gonna have secret stuff it's got to be kept on record to be
[39:04.520 --> 39:08.520]  released later so that people don't commit crimes now thinking they've got a
[39:08.520 --> 39:13.520]  blank check well we've now entered that sector they want to take the drug label
[39:13.520 --> 39:18.520]  off they want to take the food labels off they want to shut down people's
[39:18.520 --> 39:23.520]  speech at South by Southwest on GMO or NSA they they're moving on every front
[39:23.520 --> 39:27.520]  to not let us have the information and now the FCC has power grabbed the
[39:27.520 --> 39:32.520]  internet from the outside Comcast threat of wanting to take over the web oh the
[39:32.520 --> 39:36.520]  FCC will come in and save it when they've said before they want to control it
[39:36.520 --> 39:41.520]  and now FCC chairman concedes future internet tax is possible after all
[39:41.520 --> 39:49.520]  that's a CNS news so just because one plans bad by Comcast and others does it
[39:49.520 --> 39:55.520]  mean the solution to that plan is good classic bait and switch I want to hit
[39:55.520 --> 40:00.520]  this financial news and go to your calls here's the toll-free number on this
[40:00.520 --> 40:08.520]  worldwide Wednesday edition 800 259 9231 here's the only catch first time
[40:08.520 --> 40:11.520]  callers today it'll be that for William Benny as well give you a chance to get
[40:11.520 --> 40:16.520]  involved and it's it's on one of the subjects I just raised here I've raised
[40:16.520 --> 40:20.520]  a lot of subjects I want you to chime in on criminal elements of the government
[40:20.520 --> 40:25.520]  financing protecting terrorists to menace us into submission FCC documents now
[40:25.520 --> 40:29.520]  out talks about taxing authority applying the same powers they've done to
[40:29.520 --> 40:36.520]  broadcast radio and TV to all telecoms I mean this is a nightmare we're also
[40:36.520 --> 40:42.520]  going to get into some of the other power grabs that are taking place but
[40:42.520 --> 40:51.520]  before we do that again the number for first time callers is 800 259 9231
[40:51.520 --> 40:57.520]  and we will get you up and on the air on this live Wednesday edition 800 259 9231
[40:57.520 --> 41:03.520]  I'm going to get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts former chief editor of the Wall Street
[41:03.520 --> 41:09.520]  Journal father of ergonomics on probably tomorrow the next day maybe Sunday we
[41:09.520 --> 41:14.520]  can't get him the next two days on the Sunday broadcast 4 to 6 p.m. China
[41:14.520 --> 41:20.520]  gaining Western allies as development bank partners a blow to U.S. efforts and
[41:20.520 --> 41:26.520]  so China's created this new global development bank and again I'm not saying
[41:26.520 --> 41:31.520]  the Communist Chinese are laudable or great people their leadership but it is
[41:31.520 --> 41:36.520]  a separate power group to Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan that control the central
[41:36.520 --> 41:40.520]  banks of Europe the United States the private Federal Reserve so it is
[41:40.520 --> 41:44.520]  competition of a sort and between the Rockefeller's and others investing
[41:44.520 --> 41:50.520]  tens of billions the last year in this Chinese investment run bank kind of a
[41:50.520 --> 41:55.520]  challenge of the IMF for World Bank so that shows a creeping towards the exits
[41:55.520 --> 42:03.520]  a a a hedging of the bets while Western powers accelerate global currency
[42:03.520 --> 42:10.520]  devaluations in a currency devaluation war and yes the world reserve currency is
[42:10.520 --> 42:16.520]  still the dollar but when it goes belly up it will have seismic effects and
[42:16.520 --> 42:20.520]  we're already seeing deflation in some areas because of recessionary and
[42:20.520 --> 42:25.520]  depressionary elements in select areas of the economy but it's but it's
[42:25.520 --> 42:29.520]  unbalanced some people are depression others are in a recession others are in
[42:29.520 --> 42:33.520]  high cotton in this managed stage managed economy which Rolling Stone two
[42:33.520 --> 42:37.520]  years ago the headline everything is rigged interest rates the globalists get
[42:37.520 --> 42:41.520]  free money the public gets it at you know five six seven eight percent I mean
[42:41.520 --> 42:44.520]  you're told it's down there near zero but that's not what the general public
[42:44.520 --> 42:47.520]  gets I've got perfect credit went and checked about getting some credit last
[42:47.520 --> 42:52.520]  week and then I mean I'm near perfect credit we're like five percent people
[42:52.520 --> 42:58.520]  like well that sounds great no it's not the banks get it at zero so I should
[42:58.520 --> 43:03.520]  have access to something at one or two percent just the rate for them make a
[43:03.520 --> 43:10.520]  profit for processing but that's the type of stuff that's going on and it's
[43:10.520 --> 43:15.520]  very discriminatory and the world sees this and they're scared so they're not
[43:15.520 --> 43:19.520]  moving away from dollar hegemon because they want to bring down the United
[43:19.520 --> 43:23.520]  States it's like cancer that's in your heart or something you cut it out you
[43:23.520 --> 43:28.520]  die nobody really wants the US to go under globally because if it does it'll
[43:28.520 --> 43:33.520]  cause a worldwide depression of biblical proportions there aren't any
[43:33.520 --> 43:40.520]  economists that disagree with that but they're now using globalization and
[43:40.520 --> 43:45.520]  that we're all interconnected as a way to abuse everyone and make everyone accept
[43:45.520 --> 43:49.520]  dollar devaluation so we're seeing recession and depression in some cost
[43:49.520 --> 43:55.520]  but in a lot of cost restaurants a lot of other commodities you name it
[43:55.520 --> 44:00.520]  education I mean just hundreds of other areas we're seeing major inflation
[44:00.520 --> 44:08.520]  major major major I mean just last year for St. Patty's Day at the same store
[44:08.520 --> 44:14.520]  I bought a package of the same organic corned beef for it was nine dollars
[44:14.520 --> 44:19.520]  memory serves guess how much the same package of corned beef was for a party I
[44:19.520 --> 44:22.520]  have with friends and family last night guess how much each package was last
[44:22.520 --> 44:26.520]  night same amount same corned beef excellent corned beef I'm not swattering
[44:26.520 --> 44:36.520]  it was $19 and change basically double what it was 12 months ago now that is an
[44:36.520 --> 44:42.520]  inflation I don't know what is here's another headline cracks in Washington's
[44:42.520 --> 44:47.520]  Empire Washington's EU vassals might be finer backbone England Germany France
[44:47.520 --> 44:54.520]  and Italy have all invested with Japan Switzerland Luxembourg South Korea and
[44:54.520 --> 44:59.520]  others Australia you name it in the new Chinese led Asian investment bank
[44:59.520 --> 45:06.520]  neither Republicans nor Democrats are even making this an issue China gaining
[45:06.520 --> 45:10.520]  Western allies is development bank partners a blow to US efforts so with
[45:10.520 --> 45:15.520]  plan to join Chinese led bank Britain opens door for others that's New York
[45:15.520 --> 45:22.520]  Times that's the kind of stuff that's important another hero nothing
[45:22.520 --> 45:27.520]  compared to William Benny who brought out a lot of stuff that actually threatened
[45:27.520 --> 45:34.520]  the entire system but he's won two Nobel prizes and that's of course Joseph
[45:34.520 --> 45:40.520]  Stiglitz and he was the head economist at the World Bank and he's come out and
[45:40.520 --> 45:43.520]  said basically everything I've said that's been on the show five or six times
[45:43.520 --> 45:47.520]  over the years so it's not just Alex Jones up here waving his arms around
[45:47.520 --> 45:53.520]  saying this this is a fact this is going on and worldwide governments aren't
[45:53.520 --> 45:58.520]  trying to reform this or stabilize things they think totalitarianism is
[45:58.520 --> 46:02.520]  going to somehow at the barrel of a gun and the barrel of Big Brother
[46:02.520 --> 46:08.520]  surveillance glue all this tyranny and this inequity together meanwhile
[46:08.520 --> 46:12.520]  they're involved in a bunch of balkanization racial balkanization
[46:12.520 --> 46:16.520]  hyping up racial differences cultural differences in the name of bringing
[46:16.520 --> 46:20.520]  unity but we know it's bringing division and it's come out in government
[46:20.520 --> 46:24.520]  documents we've covered but the plan is to divide the people against each other
[46:24.520 --> 46:28.520]  so the establishment the crony capitalist who are not free market can loot
[46:28.520 --> 46:34.520]  the living daylights out of us so that's all coming up I want to go to Daniel
[46:34.520 --> 46:42.520]  Hugh Jerry Matt Mariah and others here in a moment but before we do that please
[46:42.520 --> 46:47.520]  don't forget that this one of a kind truly independent libertarian
[46:47.520 --> 46:53.520]  Americana not left or right but freedom-based operation reaching

[47:15.520 --> 47:20.520]  better job than I do we have serious reporting comedy satire we're trying

[52:00.520 --> 52:05.520]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply
[52:05.520 --> 52:08.520]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[52:08.520 --> 52:10.520]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[52:10.520 --> 52:13.520]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck
[52:13.520 --> 52:18.520]  deciding to take action a company run by patriots for patriots was born
[52:18.520 --> 52:22.520]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding
[52:22.520 --> 52:25.520]  they now operate two distribution facilities and employ
[52:25.520 --> 52:28.520]  over 50 hard-working American men and women
[52:28.520 --> 52:31.520]  it is rare to find companies who practice what they preach
[52:31.520 --> 52:35.520]  and that's why I stock MyPantry with high quality storeable foods
[52:35.520 --> 52:39.520]  from MyPatriotSupply go to mypatriotsupply.com
[52:39.520 --> 52:42.520]  or special offers on emergency food storage
[52:42.520 --> 52:48.520]  or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927
[52:48.520 --> 52:51.520]  that's 866-229-0927

[54:09.520 --> 54:11.520]  I hurt myself today
[54:11.520 --> 54:15.520]  I hurt myself today
[54:15.520 --> 54:18.520]  alright I'm gonna cut off the legendary Johnny Cash to go to your calls
[54:18.520 --> 54:21.520]  but I was just back there during the three minute break
[54:21.520 --> 54:24.520]  while they're interviewing William Benny for a documentary that I'm making
[54:24.520 --> 54:27.520]  documentary piece
[54:27.520 --> 54:29.520]  and
[54:29.520 --> 54:31.520]  it just hit me
[54:31.520 --> 54:32.520]  praise God
[54:32.520 --> 54:34.520]  I get to know Ron Paul
[54:34.520 --> 54:35.520]  Rand Paul
[54:35.520 --> 54:36.520]  I get to know William Benny
[54:36.520 --> 54:39.520]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts the former
[54:39.520 --> 54:42.520]  head of Reagan's economic operation
[54:42.520 --> 54:44.520]  just an icon of economist
[54:44.520 --> 54:47.520]  and I was just, it was popping in my head the rush
[54:47.520 --> 54:50.520]  of hundreds and hundreds of patriots
[54:50.520 --> 54:53.520]  that are fighting the New World Order that I know
[54:53.520 --> 54:55.520]  who are extremely prominent and are prominent
[54:55.520 --> 54:58.520]  and the millions of you out there fighting tyranny
[54:58.520 --> 54:59.520]  were all just as important
[54:59.520 --> 55:02.520]  and I was thinking how many good men and women there are
[55:02.520 --> 55:05.520]  and how people are rising up and fighting the tyrants
[55:05.520 --> 55:07.520]  they just don't let the general public know that
[55:07.520 --> 55:12.520]  because other people would know we're starting to win
[55:12.520 --> 55:17.520]  and what matters is in the end we win the hearts and minds
[55:17.520 --> 55:19.520]  because we're gonna go through some health folks
[55:19.520 --> 55:22.520]  what's important is in the end the New World Order falls
[55:22.520 --> 55:26.520]  and we're building the opposition that was a seed
[55:26.520 --> 55:30.520]  it is now a grove
[55:30.520 --> 55:33.520]  and we can take those seeds and plant those
[55:33.520 --> 55:37.520]  and literally repopulate the planet with liberty
[55:37.520 --> 55:39.520]  to use that allegory
[55:39.520 --> 55:42.520]  it's exponential we've gone way past the mustard seed point
[55:42.520 --> 55:44.520]  to the huge mustard tree
[55:44.520 --> 55:46.520]  to now mustard seeds planted all over the world
[55:46.520 --> 55:48.520]  I mean the globalists are in trouble they're scared
[55:48.520 --> 55:50.520]  and they should be
[55:50.520 --> 55:54.520]  because their plan is so evil so anti-human
[55:54.520 --> 55:56.520]  and once humanity wakes up to something
[55:56.520 --> 55:58.520]  change is fast
[55:58.520 --> 56:00.520]  so New World Order
[56:00.520 --> 56:04.520]  the battle is joined
[56:04.520 --> 56:08.520]  and I'm humbled to be in the company continually
[56:08.520 --> 56:10.520]  of such amazing people
[56:10.520 --> 56:12.520]  like the lady we have coming up in the next hour
[56:12.520 --> 56:14.520]  let's go to Jerry in New Jersey
[56:14.520 --> 56:16.520]  then Jackie, Don, Hugh and Adam
[56:16.520 --> 56:18.520]  and Jerry you're on the air
[56:18.520 --> 56:21.520]  Alex, my brother, God bless you
[56:21.520 --> 56:23.520]  and thank you for all that you do
[56:23.520 --> 56:25.520]  please don't
[56:25.520 --> 56:27.520]  couldn't help myself
[56:27.520 --> 56:30.520]  total agreement with the full onslaught of tyranny
[56:30.520 --> 56:32.520]  that's coming in all the different angles
[56:32.520 --> 56:34.520]  and I do tell people
[56:34.520 --> 56:37.520]  I start up conversations with total strangers
[56:37.520 --> 56:39.520]  and I wanted to ask you about
[56:39.520 --> 56:41.520]  where I really hit the wall
[56:41.520 --> 56:44.520]  and argumentively as a tactic
[56:44.520 --> 56:46.520]  you do when you hit this
[56:46.520 --> 56:48.520]  I think that I can convince people
[56:48.520 --> 56:50.520]  of what's being done
[56:50.520 --> 56:52.520]  where I hit the wall with people
[56:52.520 --> 56:54.520]  is intention
[56:54.520 --> 56:56.520]  you ask, you get
[56:56.520 --> 56:58.520]  you talk to Republicans in particular
[56:58.520 --> 57:00.520]  because it's their party that's supposed to
[57:00.520 --> 57:02.520]  actually have some standards
[57:02.520 --> 57:04.520]  I don't think the Democrats have any at all
[57:04.520 --> 57:06.520]  other than pure communism
[57:06.520 --> 57:08.520]  but it gets to where they say
[57:08.520 --> 57:10.520]  how can these Republicans be so gutless
[57:10.520 --> 57:12.520]  and so stupid
[57:12.520 --> 57:14.520]  and I try to say no, it's not stupid
[57:14.520 --> 57:16.520]  it's not gutless
[57:16.520 --> 57:18.520]  gutless means they have good intentions
[57:18.520 --> 57:20.520]  but don't have the guts to actually follow through
[57:20.520 --> 57:22.520]  here's how it works
[57:22.520 --> 57:24.520]  the last 50 years or so they put a committee system in
[57:24.520 --> 57:26.520]  they always had committees
[57:26.520 --> 57:28.520]  but they've got it where it's a leadership position
[57:28.520 --> 57:30.520]  where you get power the longer you're in
[57:30.520 --> 57:32.520]  and so all they've got to do is control
[57:32.520 --> 57:34.520]  maybe two dozen Republicans
[57:34.520 --> 57:36.520]  in the House and Senate
[57:36.520 --> 57:38.520]  total over those key committees
[57:38.520 --> 57:40.520]  and chairmanship
[57:40.520 --> 57:42.520]  and so no matter what
[57:42.520 --> 57:44.520]  the Republican grassroots does
[57:44.520 --> 57:46.520]  that are pretty good people on average
[57:46.520 --> 57:48.520]  you can never change it
[57:48.520 --> 57:50.520]  because John Banner blocks it all
[57:50.520 --> 57:52.520]  and so
[57:52.520 --> 57:54.520]  if you can't convince them
[57:54.520 --> 57:56.520]  then you can't convince them of the sun coming up in the morning
[57:56.520 --> 57:58.520]  because it's all right
[57:58.520 --> 58:00.520]  they're happening in front of their eyeballs
[58:00.520 --> 58:02.520]  every single day
[58:02.520 --> 58:04.520]  so that's how they're doing that
[58:04.520 --> 58:06.520]  that's how they're getting that job done Jerry
[58:06.520 --> 58:08.520]  is that they have
[58:08.520 --> 58:10.520]  successfully
[58:10.520 --> 58:12.520]  taken the senators away from the states
[58:12.520 --> 58:14.520]  I mean until 1913 senators
[58:14.520 --> 58:16.520]  were elected by the legislatures
[58:16.520 --> 58:18.520]  so they were creatures of the state
[58:18.520 --> 58:20.520]  well now they're their own imperial gods
[58:20.520 --> 58:22.520]  up there on Capitol Hill so that's a big problem
[58:22.520 --> 58:24.520]  get the senators back to the states
[58:24.520 --> 58:26.520]  do things like that
[58:26.520 --> 58:28.520]  and you'll turn the corner anything else Jerry?
[58:28.520 --> 58:30.520]  yeah no that's
[58:30.520 --> 58:32.520]  that's an excellent point
[58:32.520 --> 58:34.520]  I guess I'm actually heading for a town hall
[58:34.520 --> 58:36.520]  tonight with a state representative
[58:36.520 --> 58:38.520]  well great job brother keep it up
[58:38.520 --> 58:40.520]  talk to them tell them that you know
[58:40.520 --> 58:42.520]  we're gonna lose everything if they don't get going
[58:42.520 --> 58:44.520]  people are looking for leadership
[58:44.520 --> 58:46.520]  more calls coming up back in 60 seconds
[58:46.520 --> 58:48.520]  you you're up next
[58:48.520 --> 58:50.520]  Alex Jones here
[58:50.520 --> 58:52.520]  for the last two years I've been working with top doctors

[58:54.520 --> 58:56.520]  to design a nutraceutical formulation
[58:56.520 --> 58:58.520]  that has truly life changing health
[58:58.520 --> 59:00.520]  benefits so many other formulations out there
[59:00.520 --> 59:02.520]  contain toxic ingredients
[59:02.520 --> 59:04.520]  synthetic additives and even GMOs
[59:04.520 --> 59:06.520]  introducing the all-new

[59:30.520 --> 59:32.520]  of combining over 14

[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.520]  by the globalists to try to shut down
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.520]  all sorts of information getting out
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.520]  former top NSA

[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.520]  Hi Alex, Hugh Collins from Toledo, Ohio
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.520]  I have a question for you
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.520]  Rodney Stitch is one of my heroes
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.520]  I've never heard you mention him
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.520]  my question is
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.520]  what do you think of his work
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.520]  and why hasn't he been more influential?
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.520]  okay I gotta be honest with you
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.520]  I'm having one of those moments
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.520]  I've known him a lot over the years
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.520]  I think I know who he is but I can't remember
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.520]  I'm getting old
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.520]  I'm not as sharp as I used to be when it comes to memory
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.520]  who is Rodney Stitch?
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.520]  well he started as an FAA
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.520]  inspector and he wrote the book
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.520]  Unfriendly Skies
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.520]  all about Kim Trails
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.520]  yeah
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.520]  you know I think he might have been on
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.520]  my show or the news years ago
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.520]  but I do want to get him on
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.520]  so stuff just falls to the cracks
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.520]  you should just show tips
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.520]  tell us who you want to hear on the show
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.520]  well he would be great
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.520]  and if you can get him there
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:52.520]  he's a pretty old guy now
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.520]  he's written a lot of books
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.520]  one is called Defrauding America
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.520]  and there's another one called Drugging America
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.520]  his output is voluminous
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.520]  yeah I think he's been on the show now that you say it
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.520]  it would be great if you could get him
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.520]  what else are you calling about brother?
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.520]  that's really all I have right now Alex
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.520]  a big fan of your show

[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.520]  your questions for William Benny
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.520]  that way I don't know
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.520]  I tend to do that once the guest is on
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.520]  and then we rush to the end and I only get the questions at the end
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.520]  if you want to get your questions into William Benny
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.520]  please send them now

[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.520]  Don on Oklahoma
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.520]  Alex it's my opinion
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.520]  what I should be doing
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.520]  is concentrating on my county
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.520]  constitutional sheriffs, new councilmen
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.520]  commissioners and so forth
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.520]  my question to the guest is
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.520]  what he might could share
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.520]  or let me help me look for
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.520]  on a county level
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.520]  that's my question thank you
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.520]  that's a great question I'll ask William Benny
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.520]  that when you come up later
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.520]  or when he comes up later on the broadcast
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.520]  when your question comes up
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.520]  I should write that down what do you look for
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.520]  for government spying on a local level
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.520]  but you look for cell towers that are smaller
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:24.520]  in my experience
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.520]  that are not
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.520]  connected to the telephone company those will be
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.520]  basically stingray platforms
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.520]  to steal your data they're totally illegal
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.520]  the police and feds denied them for years
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.520]  we were covering a decade ago now it's mainstream news
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.520]  again they got caught lying to us
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.520]  the threat fusion centers
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.520]  give police these tools
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.520]  and teach them how to engage in illegal activity
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.520]  and they get the cops in
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.520]  and tell them it's all legal
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.520]  and see who will go along with it
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.520]  who is influenceable, who can be federalized
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.520]  who can be given an extra paycheck
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.520]  as an auxiliary fed
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.520]  as a deputy fed
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.520]  as a federalization that's going on
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.520]  right now
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.520]  and that's why we're battling
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:08.520]  that as hard as we can
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.520]  Jackie
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.520]  and Adam and Matt
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.520]  and Mariah and many others first-time callers
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.520]  today 800-259-9231
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.520]  we're going to have our guest on
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.520]  for a couple segments dealing with censorship
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.520]  and then we're going to
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.520]  come back
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.520]  to your phone calls at the bottom of the hour

[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.520]  and
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.520]  gender fluids
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.520]  that's what they want to teach first graders
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.520]  this is a teacher training seminar
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.520]  paid for by the feds
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.520]  in conservative areas
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.520]  like Louisville, Kentucky

[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.520]  rights to own and purchase firearms
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.520]  can you put two and two together

[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.520]  I want that Washington Post from Monday
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.520]  please where they said
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.520]  that the feds are moving to not have
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.520]  labels on drugs and vaccines
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.520]  there is a move because you're waking up
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.520]  we're waking up we're winning
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.520]  to shut everything down
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.520]  and that ties in with FCC chairman
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.520]  concedes there's a video
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.520]  on info wars.com from cns news
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.520]  FCC chairman concedes future internet
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:48.520]  tax is possible after all
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.520]  now that we got the actual
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.520]  regulations not law
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.520]  we don't get law from congress now we get it from
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.520]  Obama appointees
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.520]  even though most of the commission didn't like it
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.520]  you know he's the boss he's a little dictator
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.520]  and so
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.520]  they talk about taxing
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.520]  to fund enforcement
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.520]  and they said they're going to follow the model that they've used
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.520]  with the FCC on broadcast
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.520]  AMFM UHFVHF television
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:14.520]  so
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.520]  everybody better
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.520]  be grabbing their backside and protecting it
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.520]  because here comes the FCC
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.520]  it'll take a few years and they'll
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.520]  have congress debate it and they'll change some of it
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.520]  it'll be on a big lobbying chopping block
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.520]  fighting over the future of everything on the internet
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.520]  but it's here so I hope
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.520]  all you snot nose soros idiots
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.520]  that ran around
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.520]  bludgeoning me on the head
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:38.520]  and attacking me in publications and national tv
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.520]  saying I'm against net neutrality
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.520]  I'm against internet freedom
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.520]  I hope you're pleased with what happens
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.520]  I hope you're happy
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.520]  with taxing and regulating the internet
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.520]  because here it comes
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.520]  I hope you're really proud of yourselves
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.520]  you're totalitarians
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.520]  it is so sad George Soros
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.520]  $196 million
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.520]  to fake leftist organizations
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.520]  in the last year
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:08.520]  to run around saying protect the internet
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.520]  from Comcast
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.520]  Comcast now has a federal agency
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.520]  that it's manipulated in the past
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.520]  that's let them consolidate control
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.520]  with the other bigs
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.520]  oh please don't throw me in the briar patch
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.520]  Comcast said oh please don't pass this net neutrality
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.520]  see Comcast is against it
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.520]  that's how they pass the federal reserve
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.520]  that's come out mainstream news decades ago
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.520]  congressional hearings the big bank
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.520]  associations got together
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.520]  said oh we don't want a federal
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.520]  reserve to reign us in
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.520]  don't do it
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.520]  when they are the private shareholders
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.520]  oh don't do it please don't
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.520]  reverse psychology works very well
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.520]  on childlike brains
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.520]  so that's coming up we've got unprecedented
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.520]  starbucks
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.520]  every time you go on starbucks I will not go on starbucks
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.520]  I'm officially boycotting starbucks
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:00.520]  for their anti-gun stance everything else
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.520]  they'll chat up about
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.520]  you know you got white privilege
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.520]  black I'm sorry about your oppression
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.520]  this is turning everything into a giant reeducation camp
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:12.520]  a giant
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.520]  sensitivity training
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.520]  system starbucks employees
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.520]  to discuss race relations
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.520]  with customers info wars dot com
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.520]  that dovetails with white privilege conference
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.520]  workshop pushes grade school
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.520]  children age 5
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:28.520]  a lesson about gender queer this is
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.520]  quote transgender folks
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:32.520]  lecturing elementary school age children
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.520]  lesbian and transgender issues
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.520]  and about gender
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.520]  fluid and how to share your gender
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.520]  fluids
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.520]  you can't again make this up
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.520]  I'm going to be covering that coming up
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.520]  some of the next hour and the EPA tyranny
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.520]  as a record cold as
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.520]  ice jams you know rec
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.520]  apartment buildings and more
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.520]  backyard burger and
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.520]  wiener roast targeted by EPA
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.520]  has the potential for global
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.520]  application
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.520]  the U.N.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.520]  looks to us for their global tyranny
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.520]  EPA wants to monitor how long hotel
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.520]  guests spend in the shower
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.520]  that's just some of what's coming up
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.520]  and again I just mentioned this
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.520]  White House exempts itself from FOIA
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:16.520]  requests see everything's going secret
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.520]  and
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.520]  pretty soon I'll have to have old
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:22.520]  MMR shot if this legislation
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:24.520]  passes they say they may just do it
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.520]  regulatory who needs legislation
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.520]  anymore where the MMR
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.520]  will not have an insert or tell you
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:32.520]  the adverse reactions or any other drug
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.520]  they'll have drug ads now not telling you
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.520]  where they talk for 30 seconds how great it is
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.520]  and then 30 seconds that'll kill you dead in a hammer
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.520]  make you have a heart attack or go crazy
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.520]  or murder your kids or
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.520]  you hear all those ads
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.520]  not anymore if they have their way
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.520]  I mean they're making a totalitarian
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.520]  move because confidence in them
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.520]  is collapsing and you don't have to believe Alex Jones
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.520]  Congress has a seven to nine percent
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.520]  approval rating depending on which national poll
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.520]  this is really good news because this isn't our
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.520]  government at the highest
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.520]  levels
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.520]  all right let's go to your phone calls
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.520]  let's talk to Adam in California
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.520]  or California as the gubernator would
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:14.520]  say you're on the air Adam welcome
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.520]  hi Alex
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.520]  I'm here auxiliary reporter
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.520]  that did the Comedy Central bit
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.520]  of them attacking your website
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:24.520]  yeah you caught him in the subliminal
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.520]  message good job what's your name
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.520]  Adam well good job brother
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:30.520]  yeah
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.520]  have you seen the epic rap battle
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.520]  where you rap against Ray Kurzweil
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.520]  we have seen that I never aired it
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.520]  there's just so much of this stuff
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.520]  I mean I thought that was actually a fairer piece
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.520]  what did you think it was
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.520]  they gave you a lot of respect I mean just the fact
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.520]  that you're debating against a head
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.520]  of DARPA and one of the smartest inventors
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.520]  and geniuses
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.520]  of our generation
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.520]  gives you respect right there and you said a lot
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:58.520]  of good stuff in it
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.520]  well they actually pretty much took my quotes
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.520]  and they had an actor
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.520]  engage in them we should play that on air
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.520]  that came out a while back a few months ago
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.520]  but listen
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.520]  the only reason I'm on a global platform
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.520]  actually RT aired that but it came out of
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.520]  I think
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.520]  the US first but they aired it
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.520]  the reason that's happening
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.520]  is scientists and government people
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.520]  hear me
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.520]  insiders hear me and they know
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.520]  wow that guy actually knows what he's talking about
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.520]  I'm not bragging but William Benny's been on the show many times
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.520]  and he goes wow you really know about all the angles
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.520]  of this other people don't understand this
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.520]  even people he worked with didn't get it
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.520]  because they all just want to do their little job
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.520]  and go play golf
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.520]  now I really want to know how all this works
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.520]  but it shows the power of the individual
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.520]  that now in publications
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.520]  and in major TV
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:48.520]  shows
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.520]  I'm seen as the opposition
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.520]  well it's only because I was willing to fight
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.520]  and that's a testament to all of you
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.520]  there are people more articulate
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.520]  smarter than I
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.520]  who need to take action
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:02.520]  but even if you're not more articulate
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:04.520]  than I or don't have as much energy as I
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.520]  write a book, write a newsletter
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.520]  talk to your police chief
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.520]  visit your sheriff, put my films
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.520]  in the library
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.520]  if everybody starts doing a little bit
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.520]  many hands make light work
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.520]  and we can defeat the global
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.520]  let's go ahead
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.520]  I've been listening to you for eight years through the app
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.520]  I haven't missed the episode
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.520]  I've purchased a lot of your products
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:28.520]  they're all great and you motivated me to make a movie
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.520]  and I appreciate you plugging my movie
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.520]  the conspiracy theory documentary
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.520]  when you aired the comedy central
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.520]  that was really nice of you
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.520]  brother
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.520]  I hope that we can
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.520]  nurture and basically garden
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.520]  with all these great sprouts
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.520]  like you out there
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.520]  who will grow up to be much mightier oaks than I
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.520]  that's what a real leader does
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.520]  is they try to
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.520]  bring other people along
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.520]  they try to mentor
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.520]  that's what real civilization is all about
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:00.520]  and so of course
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.520]  if you're doing auxiliary reporting
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.520]  and everybody
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.520]  can be an info wars reporter
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.520]  you just say you are unofficial
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:10.520]  because then we could have set up folks
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.520]  say they work for us and do bad things in our name
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.520]  those false flags that's been tried before
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.520]  but if people do legitimate real reporting
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.520]  we'll link to it, we'll promote it
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.520]  and then we'll promote
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.520]  when we can whatever
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.520]  separately you're doing because
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.520]  we're all going to hang together or hang separate
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.520]  to quote Benjamin Franklin my friend
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.520]  I mean this is a war
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.520]  I'm looking for soldiers in the info war
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.520]  I'm looking to win
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.520]  and the video you produced was comedy central show
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:38.520]  chides info wars with clone website
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.520]  segment features main character
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.520]  browsing conspiracy wars site
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.520]  with crazy headline using our
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.520]  header Michael Jackson

[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:52.520]  headline well god bless you
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.520]  anything else Adam?
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.520]  a lot of people made fun of me
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.520]  my friends made fun of me saying oh you're just making something out of nothing
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.520]  but then the very next week with the David Cross
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.520]  movie I showed that to him too
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.520]  and then I show him the Bill O'Reilly
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.520]  and the Rachel Maddow and they finally start to get it
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.520]  I'm trying to put together all the clips to make a documentary
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.520]  about that also
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.520]  but you and Joyce Riley mentioned the
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.520]  lawyer at the Boston bombing trial
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.520]  how she's connected to the Missawi trial
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.520]  and the other the Unabomber
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.520]  they did release video of the
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.520]  younger brother running away from the scene
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.520]  and you can clearly see he has no back pack
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.520]  so I've been with you the whole way
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:28.520]  with the boy stage
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.520]  the older brother was CIA on record
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.520]  and they just burned their two guys
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.520]  the younger brothers probably did
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:36.520]  and I've talked to the family
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:38.520]  and they go on and they get death red
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.520]  okay let me tell you
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.520]  that Boston bombing was a $3 bill
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.520]  pictures of him
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.520]  since the boat
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.520]  and the friend in the courtroom on the first day
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.520]  said that it didn't sound like him
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.520]  he said it wasn't him
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.520]  they cut his throat out
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.520]  he had not been shot in the throat
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.520]  they cut his larynx out basically
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.520]  to shut him up
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:02.520]  they shot the boat full of hundreds of holes and didn't kill him
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.520]  they're totally framing him
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.520]  this is sick
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.520]  appreciate your call God bless you Adam
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.520]  Adam take action
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.520]  make films expose things and exactly
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.520]  Mark Twain said it best
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:16.520]  in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.520]  hated, feared, and scorned
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.520]  but in time when his cause succeeds
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.520]  the timid joined him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:26.520]  your friends will laugh at you up first
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.520]  up front because they're insecure
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.520]  and they feel bad inside that they're ignorant
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.520]  but as they see that you're right
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.520]  and as they see things are happening
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.520]  they'll remember those seeds you planted
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:38.520]  and many times they sprout
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.520]  I mean I was dumb as a box of rocks
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.520]  back when I was 15 I knew history
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.520]  but I didn't know it was repeating
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.520]  but later those seeds sprouted
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.520]  and here we are today
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.520]  and so my mission is not to be a one mighty oak
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.520]  in the media landscape
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.520]  with grasslands around us
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.520]  I want a thousand oaks
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.520]  ten thousand oaks, a million oaks
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.520]  Silver has always been nature's

[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.520]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.520]  What would you do if you
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.520]  knew all the things we knew
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.520]  would you stand up but you
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.520]  would you turn away too
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:14.520]  and then what if you saw
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.520]  all of the things that's wrong
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:19.520]  would you stand tall and strong
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.520]  or would you turn and walk away
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.520]  What would you do if you
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.520]  knew all the things we knew
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.520]  would you stand up for truth
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.520]  The big theme I see emerging
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:34.520]  just tracking the news the last few months
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.520]  is massive attacks on free speech
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.520]  but not just the whistleblowers or insiders
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.520]  exposing crime
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:42.520]  but independent media itself
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.520]  the internet that's its main platform
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.520]  launch point
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.520]  it's Ether
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.520]  it's format
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:53.520]  but also the data itself
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.520]  and that's coming up in the next segment
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.520]  this affects everybody big time
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.520]  it's the surest sign
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.520]  of accelerating despotism
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:03.520]  and a totalitarian atmosphere
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.520]  but that's happening because they
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:07.520]  push the totalitarian takeover
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:10.520]  people woke up the old American instincts kicked in
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:13.520]  the old western instincts kicked in
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:15.520]  Renaissance started to kick in
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.520]  and now they're trying to accelerate
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:19.520]  and triple down and it is like
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.520]  adding nitrous oxide
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.520]  to an internal combustion engine
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:26.520]  it is doing nothing but accelerating liberty
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:28.520]  that said though the car can fly off the road
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:31.520]  and hurt everybody this is a very dangerous time
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:34.520]  that's why we deescalate with the police
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:37.520]  deescalate with the system
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:39.520]  because even though they're doing a lot of bad things
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.520]  they don't know they work for the new old order
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.520]  they're starting to figure it out
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:46.520]  starting to get the big picture they're not the enemy
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:49.520]  I'll say it again I found being around feds
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.520]  being around local police being around military
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:54.520]  being around NSA people
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:57.520]  being around you name it from
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.520]  top retired generals recently retired
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:01.520]  to top NSA people
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.520]  right down to police chiefs around the country
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:05.520]  and sheriffs they are the most
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.520]  await group they're either evil
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:10.520]  and serving the system or they're good
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:12.520]  and awake and don't know what to do
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:14.520]  and say I wish the people would wake up
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.520]  and support us the globalists know
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.520]  if we start getting together with local government
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.520]  and good people in the federal government
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:22.520]  we can form a coalition that's legitimate
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:24.520]  that's strong with people like
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.520]  William Benny and Ron Paul and others
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:30.520]  and we can legitimately have reform
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:32.520]  but the globalists don't want that
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:34.520]  they want a race war they want division
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:36.520]  they want balkanization ahead of that
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:39.520]  and that's why they're pulling out the stops
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:42.520]  I mean you know the new black panther party
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:44.520]  all over the country
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.520]  marching around saying kill police
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.520]  shoot police oink oink bang bang
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.520]  kill a pig here in Austin just two days ago
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.520]  we played the video yesterday
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:54.520]  you know if a libertarian group
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:56.520]  not that we never even do that or want to do that
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:58.520]  you know if a conservative group did that
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.520]  we'd be arrested you know that's a terrorist threat
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:04.520]  you know that's organization to do murder
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.520]  that's cap that's planning in my view
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.520]  legally capital murder
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:10.520]  to march around saying we want to kill
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.520]  we want to kill 20 cops
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.520]  we want to shoot them we want to take them out
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.520]  armed in an organized group
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.520]  I mean I'll say that if 20 people are marching
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:20.520]  towards me with guns saying we want to kill Alex Jones
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:22.520]  I legally and lawfully have the right
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.520]  to get in the stance on the ground open fire
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.520]  now what I'd actually just try to get out of there
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.520]  I'm not looking for trouble but
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.520]  you know this is just a joke ladies and gentlemen
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.520]  this is all federally financed
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:34.520]  these are useful idiots
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:36.520]  let's go to another call Maria
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.520]  in California you're on the air
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:40.520]  go ahead
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:42.520]  hi there Alex I'm so happy to talk with you today
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.520]  thank you
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:46.520]  you know when I first started listening to you
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.520]  I used to just
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.520]  I used to love to listen to you because of
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.520]  your rants that you would do
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.520]  and your little mimicking voices and stuff
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:56.520]  used to really make me smile
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:58.520]  even though a lot of bad things were going on
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:00.520]  at least I could hear you and I could feel
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.520]  what you were going through at the same time
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.520]  I lost contact with you
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:06.520]  about this time last year and then
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.520]  regain contact
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.520]  again the end of this year and try to get
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.520]  some information through to you
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.520]  and other people
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.520]  try to get some information out there
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.520]  but it seems like everything I do gets blocked
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.520]  well you're on the air get the info out
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:22.520]  I mean one of the biggest frustrations for listeners is
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.520]  they can't get us stuff
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:26.520]  sometimes they do sometimes we don't cover it
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.520]  because we're like a one-legged man
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.520]  in a butt kicking contest around here
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.520]  so if you can't get it through to us
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.520]  put it out on YouTube put it out on Facebook
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:36.520]  use enemy platforms
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.520]  to jam the system go ahead
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.520]  well it's hard to do that
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:42.520]  but okay sure but
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.520]  what I wanted to talk about is you know a lot of this information
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.520]  there's a lot of information out there
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.520]  and a lot of things that now it just seems like
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.520]  it's just you're just bombarded with though
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.520]  with all kinds of information
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.520]  but what I want to talk about is what's going on
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.520]  in where I'm living
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.520]  in my city I live
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.520]  in a military type area
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.520]  where they do a lot of weapons testing
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.520]  and things like that here
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.520]  and a lot of what's going on
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.520]  on a worldwide scale
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:10.520]  there are things that are going on right here
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.520]  in our city I mean everything from
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.520]  the education system to the medical
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.520]  to the police to the
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.520]  to the social services to all that
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.520]  are going on in this one
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.520]  in our city
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:24.520]  which I believe is going on in probably a lot of cities all over
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:26.520]  yeah what they're doing is they're merging
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.520]  the military with the local threat fusion centers
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.520]  and the police and everything
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.520]  under federalized control
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.520]  with centralized codes
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:36.520]  centralized dispatch and then that's being
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:38.520]  centralized globally
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.520]  all into one huge computer system
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.520]  attract and control everything
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:44.520]  it is not a good situation
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:46.520]  plus GPS is based on satellites
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:48.520]  what if there's a big solar flare
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.520]  we're on the march the empire's
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.520]  on the run
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.520]  another major health threat
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.520]  this one in Toledo Ohio
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:00.520]  where everybody in the entire city
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.520]  has been told not to drink the water
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:04.520]  Ohio's governor declaring
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.520]  a state of emergency
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.520]  did you know that the average person
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.520]  uses about 80 to 100 gallons
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.520]  of water at home
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.520]  every single day
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.520]  if there's a water emergency
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.520]  will you be prepared
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.520]  panicked residents forming long lines
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:22.520]  throughout the day
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.520]  in Toledo you can see the shells empty
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.520]  where water once was
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:28.520]  to stay safe and healthy during a crisis

[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:29.000]  It's not about food. It's about keeping those ants in line
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:40.720]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.120]  Well, he's definitely a bigger
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.120]  whistleblower
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:53.040]  Then Daniel Ellsberg
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:56.040]  And I've had Daniel Ellsberg on the broadcast the Pentagon Papers
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:59.000]  He's certainly much higher level
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.400]  than
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:05.600]  Snowden and he's just been in Germany making a film with
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:08.600]  Oliver Stone
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:10.600]  about the NSA
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:12.720]  William Benny was
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:18.040]  Number three at the NSA depending on which news article you read he directed their technological development systems
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:23.480]  So he actually knows the entire grid and infrastructure and he saw
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:30.120]  Criminal spine of I live the law in 2001. He told Congress quietly so they swat team rated him
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:34.400]  He followed the law and here he is 15 years later
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.360]  exposing the system and
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:45.480]  He will be joining us in about 35 minutes from now in studio. He's here with us in Austin, Texas, William Benny and
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:47.080]  And
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.640]  The reason I mentioned that is our next guest
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:51.800]  Catherine Paul
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:56.360]  associate director of organic consumers association organic consumers dot org
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:05.120]  Probably the leading group watchdog of other organic certifiers and writing articles about what's happening at state level federal level and international level
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:13.960]  Just a cornucopia pun intended a vital information for people that don't want to eat pesticide laden food don't want to eat GMO I
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:18.960]  Want to know what true organic food is part of this revolution. That's beginning to win
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:22.240]  With McDonald's and all these big companies saying no more
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:27.040]  Bovine growth hormone. We're gonna start phasing out the pesticides. We're gonna
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.560]  We're seeing some big victories here
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:35.800]  But the establishment is striking back by going and creating fake PR
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:41.960]  Organizations that come out and go oh sugar and high fructose is good. Oh, there are good GMOs
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:46.320]  And I've got a stack of news articles breaking this down
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:54.000]  But they were banned even though they set it up months ago for being part of this big whole food sponsored
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:01.120]  Event headline gene giants kick OCA off South by Southwest food panel
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:08.720]  Discussion and I wanted to just show TV viewers and read this for radio listeners. Just the news the last three days
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:16.040]  From Monday to today just a few articles I grabbed out of the stack here
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:20.840]  US sets new record for denying censoring government files AP
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:24.480]  AP president says that it's totalitarian
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:32.520]  What a William Benny told the Guardian a few months ago. He said it is a total totalitarian takeover close quote. What is AP now say?
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:37.840]  It is a totalitarian takeover. That's AP. It didn't Alex Jones anymore using words like that folks
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:44.800]  You look out your window and your neighbor's house has fire shooting out of the windows. It's on fire. That's an alarmist statement
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.800]  It's on fire
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:53.360]  Oh, that guy's alarmist he's upset. What's wrong with him? Well, people weren't paying attention. Of course. I was yelling. It's creaming
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:58.640]  Foreign corporations of hijacked the country. They own both parties. We're in trouble
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.280]  Just one headline. Here's another one FOI four-year access of information
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.440]  scoring 2015
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:13.920]  State Department gets an F. Here's another headline. Why house exempts itself from foyer request totally as of Tuesday
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:18.880]  The Office of Administration will no longer have to heed foyer request according to RT
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:24.120]  They just say they don't have to that that violates the Open Records Act National Security Act. That's a felony
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:27.080]  They're just announcing it though
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:32.520]  Everyone Cheney said he was above the law and that the vice president was more important than the president
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:38.760]  Remember Nixon saying it's not illegal. Can we find that clip when Nixon said it's not illegal when the
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:41.240]  president does it
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:45.240]  It's okay when the president does it
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:49.000]  So continuing here's another article FDA
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:55.400]  Proposes to let drug companies undermine official safety warnings
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.080]  Look at that headline right there
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:05.640]  So they want to just get rid of even letting you know what they admittedly what these drugs can do to you
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:11.480]  Here's no one Coca-Cola caught paying health leaders to say soda is healthy snack
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.800]  Yeah, this is how they operate
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:21.240]  I'm gonna stop right there and go to Catherine Paul whose organization has been banned from South by Southwest and we even know who
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:27.560]  Said ban it and who they follow their orders from folks need to understand that the people
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:34.720]  That are running South by Southwest are extremely Toletarians and have been messing with me for 20 years
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.200]  Trying to jack with this radio show and TV show. So they're really bad guys
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:43.200]  And I've been telling you this for a long time. It's becoming more and more evident
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:50.280]  Catherine I wanted to do five six minutes of background. So it's not just you that this is happening to they had the police ticket
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:53.360]  Us for using a sound device downtown warning about GMOs
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:39:01.360]  In McDonald's, but they were letting everybody else use sound devices including the petty cabs and other grips and they've let me march many times
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.720]  With a bullhorn and they've lost lawsuits over it
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:09.880]  But still they ticketed us and shut us down because McDonald's ordered them to I guess they're the boss, but not for long
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:13.240]  Catherine Paul. Thank you for coming on with us today
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:20.480]  My pleasure. Thank you for having me on you just heard that background. Can you comment on that and then tell us what's happened to your organization?
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:30.480]  Well, none of what you say really surprises me and and we've seen this, you know, my focus has been for the past few years on on
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:37.480]  the biotech industry corporations and the we call them the junk food manufacturers and
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:41.480]  they're not only, you know
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:45.480]  propaganda programs and the millions of dollars that they
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:52.480]  Spend to sort of spin the truth, but also their obvious manipulation of the federal government from the FDA
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:56.480]  Right down to state and local politicians
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:58.480]  So
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:01.480]  What happened with us as you say is I
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:07.480]  One of the organizers of a panel a session there at South by Southwest
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:12.480]  Contact me if I'd be available to participate on a panel
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:23.480]  With Kathleen and right the executive VP of the biotech industry organization and I said sure would be happy to sit there and have a discussion with her
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:31.480]  But when there was no follow-up with confirmation and I finally, you know reached out and said what's up. I was told well
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:34.480]  Kathleen and right had said
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:37.480]  We were not allowed to be
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:39.480]  On the panel
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:41.480]  So they basically uninvited me
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:50.480]  So the biotech industry is literally running the so-called panel on safe and healthy food in the future of food here in the trendy so-called liberal city
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:56.480]  Of Austin where Whole Foods is based Whole Foods is a sponsor heavily involved
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:02.480]  And so what we have is a Don King boxing match a fake debate with a bunch of hand-picked people
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:09.480]  That won't actually engage in any real discussion, but we have this perception management
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:18.480]  Exactly and and you know I picked up the phone and I called Kathleen and right and I said is this true you really
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:21.480]  Did you really?
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:28.480]  Uninvite me from this panel and she said it was absolutely true because they didn't want to she figured that if I showed up there was going to be a
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:33.480]  Debate about the health and safety of GMOs and she said that that debate is over don't want that
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:37.480]  That's not the conversation she wanted to have
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:41.480]  Notice the same corporate tactic the debate is over
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:48.480]  Exactly that's what the Borg say in Star Trek. We will assimilate you the debate is over you will submit
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:50.480]  I don't think so
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:56.480]  I think the debates over for them with the thousands of studies coming out that a lot of GMOs are very dangerous
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:02.480]  And certainly we have a right to choose they're trying to block labeling so they're clearly the bad guys here
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:15.480]  Well, you know we love we look at these companies and all their resources and they they talk this great story about sustainable agriculture and helping farmers and cheating the world
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:27.480]  We'd love to invite them to do exactly that but the way to do that is not by dumping millions of pounds of glyphosate and other toxic chemicals into our soils and onto our food
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:34.480]  So it's a shame that with all their power and all their resources they couldn't put it to better use
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:48.480]  But the reality is and as everyone knows this genetically engineered crop were never intended as a means of solving world hunger
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:43:01.480]  GMOs soy and GMO corn and GMO canola oil and all of those things either go to junk food or the vast percentage of that goes to make ethanol for your gas tanks
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:04.480]  Or to feed animals in feedlot
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:10.480]  Sure it's all about profit and monopoly in Monsanto and others own prospectus and corporate speeches
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:15.480]  You're a bigger expert on this than I but I've seen the South by Southwest announcements has been on TV
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:21.480]  South by Southwest to help the earth with clean healthy sustainable food to feed the Africans
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:34.480]  And in reality from India to Africa GMO is creating disaster zones and in India linked to massive farmer suicides and here to breast cancer and every other nightmare you can imagine
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:37.480]  I mean these are the folks that brought us Agent Orange
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:46.480]  And these crops are not feeding the world we're not feeding human beings starting human beings a bunch of GMO soy and corn
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:57.480]  That's not where those crops are going and the argument that genetic engineering can create drought resistant crops and all of these is baloney
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:08.480]  Because 99% of GMO crops are engineered for one reason and one reason only and that's to withstand massive doses of pesticides or herbicides
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:14.480]  And that's what Monsanto and the rest of them are selling and that's where their profits are
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:24.480]  They can't make a profit genetically engineering a drought resistant crop unless that drought resistant crop requires some toxic chemical
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:26.480]  Because that's what they sell
[01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:35.480]  Let's explain that the big four companies globally there's a bunch of other smaller ones but the big four have mostly the spectrum of business
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:44.480]  They could come out with very clean one genetic trait studied things that that that use less water have higher yield
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:48.480]  There might still be side effects that should all be debated and researched properly
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:59.480]  But instead they've got hardcore pharmacological crops producing live viruses chemicals you name an open air where they program the crops to produce whatever they want
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:09.480]  Folks I know it sounds buck Rogers look it up yourself look up HIV virus grown in protogen corn associated press in 2002
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:16.480]  I mean you cannot make this stuff up thousands of these crops being tested and they just say safe and effective debate is over
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:26.480]  And then all their engineering are these BT crops and other systems that are designed to resist these deadly pesticides that that that we know
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:34.480]  I mean another two studies came out last week as you know where glyphosates are linked directly to five-fold increase in kidney failure
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:44.480]  Well I mean look at the kidneys failing everywhere I mean it's just a it is not a suicide pact to go along with Monsanto especially with their long history
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:54.480]  And I'm sorry to be ranting here it just makes me so mad to watch the so-called liberals here in Austin Lewis Black and South by Southwest
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:46:09.480]  Because it's not just kicking you out and you know putting up Monsanto like they're saving the earth and our liberals it's that it's that it's the whole the whole thing is a censored authoritarian fraud
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:11.480]  I'm sorry I'm ranting go ahead
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:25.480]  No no and I mean I couldn't agree more and and the fact that they they can't even allow someone like myself to be there because they they don't they don't want to admit that there still is a debate
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:40.480]  The fact that they're spending millions and millions of dollars to show up at these places to get articles in publications all over the world written by people who on the surface look like they're scholars or
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:48.480]  or scientists but when you dig deep into their background actually have deep ties industry
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:54.480]  I would do on your show to read a couple of recent things that have come out
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:02.480]  There are three things on my radar everybody ought to read one of them is a book that just came out by Stephen Drucker
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:10.480]  He wrote a book called altered genes twisted truth how to venture to genetically engineer our food
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:13.480]  He's coming on in two weeks he's coming on two weeks plug the book again
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:26.480]  It's altered genes twisted truth it's how how the venture to genetically engineer our food has subverted science corrupted government and systematically deceived the public
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:36.480]  Great book 15 years of research went into this and let's go further as you know they've got two different or three different big studies just came out even one from the US government
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:45.480]  We now know GMO crops are going through the cell wall and are actually the cell membrane in a in a in a human not wall wall via plan
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:52.480]  They're going through the cell membrane and changing our DNA and mitochondria and mutating us just like they do lab rats
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:48:09.480]  Exactly and we have never ever subjected these to long term human health studies and I love it. I just love it when when the Monsanto folks and and all of their front group and phony
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:22.480]  bought and paid for scientists say there's just no proof that anybody's ever died from eating a GMO food or you know we can't trace any illnesses back to GMO food
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:29.480]  Well we can't because nobody knows where that stuff is there's no real traceability but scientists are tracing it back
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:38.480]  And and this idea that if you eat something if you eat something and you don't drop over dead immediately means it must be safe is ridiculous
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:40.480]  Well then cigarettes must be good
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:42.480]  Pardon?
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:44.480]  I mean you don't drop dead from your first cigarette so they must be good
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:59.480]  Exactly exactly I mean we have an epidemic of infertility in in the younger generation why is everybody having to go to the doctor to get pregnant
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:10.480]  Oh it's also real funny that in a bunch of rodent studies they never do them in humans as you said they can do them quicker in rodents that it causes infertility in them to eat these BT crops
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:13.480]  Funny
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:27.480]  Yeah I mean it's it's rampant but the seed is rampant it's a logic is ridiculous and what I think I think that people are beginning more and more to make the connection between the fact that
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:39.480]  There are two issues here there's there's the issue well there are actually way more than two issues but when it comes to human health there's the issue of is genetic modification
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:47.480]  It's self creating a product that is itself dangerous and causing us illness and there are plenty of studies that suggest yes
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:56.480]  But also you can't have those foods without using massive amounts of toxic poisonous chemicals
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:58.480]  Well it's clearly both
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:07.480]  Chemicals right and those chemicals not only are on your food they're in your water they're in your soil they're in your and they're everywhere
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:17.480]  And and it's just common sense I think and I think we we see it it's evidenced by the fact that the junk food companies are all in trouble
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:27.480]  And the organics are in farmers markets whether they're organic or not local food that we know where it came from without pesticides
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:33.480]  Sales of those are growing like crazy because people are just putting two and two together
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:39.480]  And Catherine you said you had three things everybody should read and interrupt you going back to the book come back and tell us those two things and
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:49.480]  Clearly we're starting to gain momentum it transcends left right it's common sense not having your kids die of cancer when they're 20 this is serious we know that
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:57.480]  That that the worm is starting to turn I want to know how you think they're going to strike back as awareness explodes stay with us

[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:34.480]  You promote basic liberty final segment with Catherine Paul and go back to your calls and huge amounts of news social engineering news attempts to disarm us attempts to balkanize I'm going to break down all of it coming up the next hour in your calls Catherine Paul from organic consumers.org excellent site amazing news amazing information she's the associate director she was banned and then I guess her group after that from being part of South by Southwest
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:36.480]  even though they were approached and put on the panels
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:53.480]  this I think is the enemy striking back to answer my question to her but I want her to elaborate trying to shut down debate trying to create fake debates but I just don't see it working it's like a tidal wave of awakening is taking place
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:55:00.480]  so what's the rest of the story where do you see all this going now how will they strike back and then what were the other two points you were going to make
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:17.480]  Well I wanted to direct people to read a couple of other things just just just have fully to help get more background and really the depth of the conspiracy to deceive consumers because it really has been a conspiracy and a part of corporations
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:45.480]  there's a new nonprofit called US right to know that recently published a report called CD business what big food is hiding with its slick PR campaign on GMOs great deal of good information on their outlining very specifically to what length these corporations have gone to manipulate government policy and manipulate the message
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:56:01.480]  and also another new book out and I think this is just a sign I mean that there's there's so much being put out there right now a book called poison spring the secret history of pollution and the EPA
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:19.480]  somebody who worked for the EPA for 15 years inside talking about how the EPA has chosen to ignore its own scientists on the issues of pesticides like glyphosate and Panda instead of corporations
[01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:40.480]  How do you see them striking back and in a battle briefly where are we right now in the battle I think we're I think we are side is getting pretty close to a tipping point we've heard from insiders and general mills they're absolutely panic that's why they're buying up organic companies
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:57.480]  we see Kellogg is in trouble we see McDonald's is in trouble corporation after corporation in the food industry are beginning to see that that maybe being in bed with the biotech industry wasn't such a great idea after all
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:03.480]  even Chuck Norris is coming out against Monsanto I mean I mean that states the end for them
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:20.480]  it does so there's there's a battle on that level consumers and and they're interested in their own personal health that's what's really been driving this for the past few years and we've seen it with it with the battle to label GMOs and the length
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:36.480]  to which biotech industry have gone to defeat those laws and they won those battles but they lost those wars and the backlash is incredible I want to have you back up for a full hour in the near future amazing work God bless you organic consumers

[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:33.480]  okay good okay the EPA Agenda 21 Salt Lake City Utah just passed an ordinance in the city council that says that they're banning as of January 2016 they're going to be banning wood stove usage
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:37.480]  okay that was actually an article back run on the local fox affiliate
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:46.480]  no no yeah so you know that goes along with the stuff that you're talking about with Agenda 21 it goes along with the EPA saying you know
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:57.480]  folks if you watch the Obama deception made six years ago I tell everybody this it's in the documents they're going to shut down all human activity that isn't corporate we are in trouble

[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:44.480]  William Benny is with us for the hour William Edward Benny is the former technical leader for intelligence with the NSA before becoming a whistleblower
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:51.480]  in late 2001 after more than 30 years of the agency Benny has been described as one of the best analysts and code breakers in NSA history
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:57.480]  they basically shut up a lot of what was going on so he knew they were doing illegal stuff Benny continues to speak out
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:03.480]  he's been swat teamed he's been attacked he's been demonized but it's failed they've tried to silence him
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:13.480]  and other whistleblowers exposed facts dot org is a site where you can read some of his analysis and material I hope he writes a book soon
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:20.480]  he came down here on his own dime basically a South by Southwest to speak got a pretty good reception we'll get his take on that
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:26.480]  he wants to go through some of the snow in the slides today for TV viewers radio listeners can go to info wars dot com

[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:51.480]  William thanks for coming in thanks for having me I don't know where to start we could recap your story what's happening
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:55.480]  get into the exciting stuff about you coming back from Germany you've been talking to parliaments over there
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:04.480]  you've been talking to the EU people the British parliament big national headlines where you say it's a totalitarian takeover in the guardian
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:13.480]  but here it's starting to come out in the news as well I guess they failed to silence you we can talk about you working with Oliver Stone now
[02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:20.480]  on the new Snowden documentary we could get into the slides and break down the fact that it is going on from an expert
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:29.480]  showing us not what's classified but what's already been leaked so you don't get in trouble we're here with the former technical director of the NSA
[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:33.480]  the guy that actually ran it William Benny so you've got the floor sir
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:43.480]  okay but yeah there's so much here it's really hard to know where to start because it's really been over time it's been our government has moved into
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:52.480]  basically sliding down the totalitarian slope taking massive amounts of data on our citizens then working around and doing it across the world
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:58.480]  so it's basically they're doing this for everybody in the planet and the process started here in the NSA
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:06.480]  and it started to spread around the world to the five eyes countries the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:18.480]  and then to other countries like in Germany and Switzerland and Sweden and Israel so the process of data collection
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:26.480]  and now the Russians are doing it I just read an article where they're starting this kind of operation so now the Russians are following our lead in this spying business
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:28.480]  it's a big brother race
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:37.480]  this is when I first started in October 2001 it was very clear to me that this was a process that we were adopting in the United States
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:46.480]  it was really a Soviet attempt or a Stasi attempt in East Germany to assemble all the information on their populations
[02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:54.480]  why? it's because they wanted to control their populations that was the whole point of the totalitarian states that has been down through history
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:59.480]  I mean this is nothing new this has been repeated so many times in Caesar Augustus
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:07.480]  it was so clear right up front but I mean you can ask anybody in the Tea Party who's been denied access to 501C3
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:14.480]  you can look at the IRS use of the data look at the law enforcement
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:17.480]  DEA with a parallel construction?
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:23.480]  a parallel construction I mean that's spread around the world to other police organizations around the world to anybody with an organization
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:30.480]  or police organization that has a relationship with the FBI or the DEA around the world is subject to getting this kind of information
[02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:38.480]  but they'll never be given the original data from the NSA collection because it's not admissible in a court of law because it wasn't acquired by a warrant
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:42.480]  and they don't want to with foreigners compromise the fact that they have the ability to collect them
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:50.480]  and don't they then fence it and wash it and they've been caught adding disinformation and it's a perfect way to put into the global data stream frame ups
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:59.480]  they did that kind of framing with us they did that even with us the Department of Justice did that they framed us they tempted to
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:04.480]  speak a little bit about that I think that gives people a window into how totalitarian this is
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:14.480]  well for example in the case the only case that went to court was Tom Drake's case and they took him to court because he was still working for NSA at the time
[02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:21.480]  this was in 2007 when they raided us initially and then they raided Tom Drake about three months later
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:31.480]  but his case didn't get the court till about 2010 well 2010 they charged him in 2011 in that frame they wanted to take him to court
[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:38.480]  and what they did was they took information that he had at his house that was marked unclassified
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:47.480]  and they changed that they drew a line through that and then stamped it classified secret or top secret then charged him with having classified material
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:54.480]  that's like retroactively classifying something so you can charge somebody with having classified material that's framing him ok
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:57.480]  it's a forgery it's a fraud it's a major felony
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:14:06.480]  right and the problem with it is that they didn't know what they had done they had released most of that material themselves NSA did into the public domain unclassified
[02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:08.480]  and that's what Jim Bamford found
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:12.480]  because Drake wasn't stupid he didn't want to go to prison he was only bringing out was already out there
[02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:18.480]  well first of all it was unclassified by NSA regulations that was the way they stamped it
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:28.480]  so I had the former director of Star Wars on he died a few years ago Dr. Bob Bowman and he talked about some of the space planes once and then they called him and came to his house and kind of threatened him
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:39.480]  and he said hey here's where it was released on C-span and here's where you guys in your own propaganda a decade ago released it and then they couldn't go after him but that's the type of stuff they pulled
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:45.480]  right it's total it's a total fabrication of evidence to put people in jail that's our department of justice doing it
[02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:47.480]  the bible calls it bearing false witness
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:59.480]  yes I call it perjury and felony and these people should be charged and given a chance to explain what they did and tell folks what happened to you before we get into the NSA itself
[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:09.480]  well for me in my case I mean I was kind of prominent you know complaining to senators and representatives and various other people as was Tom Drake
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:11.480]  let's be clear you guys were doing this internally
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:20.480]  we were internal in terms of the government yes we were going to the inspector we even Kirk Wiebe and I even went to talk to the department of justice inspector general
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:27.480]  and of course they couldn't say anything to us but we made it clear what the problem was with this domestic spying
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:43.480]  but for me and all four of us we were the four who were first rated in July of 2007 we were rated because we were the ones who signed the DODIG complaint against NSA charging them with corruption, fraud, waste and abuse
[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:56.480]  and that caused the DODIG investigation of NSA that all verified what we were saying and that was published but redacted because it was even the unclassified embarrassing parts were redacted
[02:15:57.480 --> 02:15:59.480]  which is a violation of the NSA regular the government
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:01.480]  open records
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:04.480]  well it's a violation of government classification regulations too
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:17.480]  in other words executive order 13526 section 1.7 says you can't classify something or keep it classified or not declassified if it's evidence of a crime or evidence of that embarrasses an agency or
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:20.480]  you can't use the national security act to cover up criminal activity
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:32.480]  exactly exactly and that's basically what the NSA and the DOJ and the DOD with that investigative report that's what they were doing
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:35.480]  they were redacting and hiding it from congress and hiding it from everybody else
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:38.480]  so they're covering up what they're doing
[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:49.480]  and for us they attempted after the raid by the way the DODIG's office was the one that gave our names as the ones who submitted that complaint against NSA
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:51.480]  they gave our names to the FBI
[02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:54.480]  and that was against their regulations
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:55.480]  okay
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:16:58.480]  so they're all breaking the law while accusing you of doing it
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:05.480]  and all you're doing is going to congressional committees and inspector generals whose job it is to have oversight and telling them how they're breaking the law
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:13.480]  yes and also it's the committees who are supposed to the intelligence committees in the house and senate and also the FISA court
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:19.480]  were established after the church committee investigation of NSA, CIA and FBI in the in the 70s
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:25.480]  and one of the main persons they were spying on back in the minaret program was senator church
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:27.480]  that's right
[02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:34.480]  and that was only came out recently and the reason they didn't of course was because they are spying on people who have power over them
[02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:39.480]  and let's be clear because the fake conservative argument and the fake liberal argument is the same
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:42.480]  we're protecting you from al-qaeda and drug dealers and all this other stuff
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:45.480]  but then as more of this gets leaked and comes out
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:49.480]  they're spying on parliament, they're spying on congress, they're spying on other agencies
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:54.480]  and there's so much spying going on and you've explained this the back when you were really spying on the Russians
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:58.480]  really spying on radical Islamists legally and lawfully
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:06.480]  that was already legal and lawful, it's the domestic stuff that's illegal but they confuse people and say let us protect you from al-qaeda
[02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:14.480]  but actually they're doing the opposite, they're letting all these groups operate because they're too busy spying on their boyfriends and their girlfriends in the congressman
[02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:22.480]  and that's one of the cases that came out was what they called an NSA love-int, love-intelligence
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:32.480]  that's where the analysts were looking into the data to see whether or not their better parts or their spouses or girlfriends were cheating on them
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:38.480]  well you don't do that first of all, you don't do that America, you do not do that with metadata, you do that with content
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:45.480]  and that's what they've been trying to hide that they've been collecting content all along since 2002 at least
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:51.480]  and that content is stored in Utah, San Antonio and various other storage facilities
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:56.480]  and there should have been a dun dun dun, we're going to skip this network break, this is so important right now, William Benning
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:18:59.480]  the former director of the technical division of the NSA
[02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:06.480]  I've seen the news say you were the number two, number three, number four, what position were you in the NSA, what that position, what level is that?
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:14.480]  well I was a senior executive grade, if you get in military ranks that'd be like a 1.5 star general
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:21.480]  but I was the technical director of the world geopolitical military analysis and reporting shop
[02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:24.480]  that was about 6,000 analysts and reporters
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:28.480]  how high is your IQ, because they say you've got like a mathematical brain
[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:30.480]  come on, be sure it was about 180
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:35.480]  no, no, I think it was 143 or something like that, but you know I'm just a basic country
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:38.480]  but you've got a genius for numbers and code cracking
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:48.480]  I had a real event for that doing that, yes, it's just a talent that you have to be able to look at patterns and see patterns in data
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:53.480]  and when you can do that, that's the kind of thing you need to be able to break things and solve problems
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:20:01.480]  sometimes I want to have you on just about you, I mean I know most of it's classified, but I mean you've battled the Russians, the Chinese, everybody, right?
[02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:06.480]  most of the Warsaw Pact, Europe, European, communist countries and the Soviets
[02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:12.480]  and you've said before it upset you to go from really going spying after serious folks to like spying on congressmen
[02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:17.480]  yes, I mean in every US citizen in the country, yeah, no one was exempt
[02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:27.480]  I mean everybody was taken in, I mean even Senator Rockefeller when he was addressed in January on CNN I think it was
[02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:32.480]  he addressed it, he said they've got data on, they've probably even got data on me
[02:20:33.480 --> 02:20:39.480]  well, I mean what he's saying was right, I mean they're collecting all the data content and metadata on everybody in the country
[02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:45.480]  explain those lies for folks, they claim oh it's just metadata, just you know basically when you didn't call like a phone bill, no, no, no
[02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:47.480]  explain what they're really doing
[02:20:48.480 --> 02:20:52.480]  well, Mark Klein kind of exposed that too and it's in court record in Mark Klein's case where he laid out the wiring for all the
[02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:57.480]  for the NSA room in the AT&T facility in San Francisco
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:20:58.480]  sure
[02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:07.480]  and on that, let's think of room 641B, what they did was they put a prism type of fare or a splitter, what's called a splitter or Y connector
[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:12.480]  where you have a fiber coming in and it duplicates and sends it down two paths
[02:21:12.480 --> 02:21:17.480]  one path went to the NSA room and the other path went to the normal distribution of communications
[02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:23.480]  in the NSA room, all the diagramming showed all the nearest devices they had in there where they
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:30.480]  push the fiber optic networks into the nearest device, what that did was recompile everything on the line and sessionize it
[02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:37.480]  meaning reassemble all the data, like if you send an email it goes out in packets, it will pull all its packets back together
[02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:41.480]  and say here's the email you just sent and then they would pass that on to NSA for storage
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:48.480]  and that's what that device did, it did content collection, not just metadata, but content
[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:54.480]  and then now we know those hubs are everywhere and in front of us they're building giant huge complexes to store it all
[02:21:55.480 --> 02:22:03.480]  yes, the latest one that they've just submitted an environmental impact statement for is a 2.8 million square foot facility on Fort Mead
[02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:06.480]  at taking up basically the golf course at Fort Mead
[02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:11.480]  that 2.8 million is about three times the size of Buffdale
[02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:16.480]  just about three times, that's a million square feet, this is 2.8
[02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:20.480]  but I love about the NSA, we've had reporters in San Antonio and in Utah
[02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:26.480]  and you just get there at the Walmart parking lot and start videotaping, they run up, the police go, how dare you videotape us
[02:22:26.480 --> 02:22:33.480]  it's just a public, I mean it's publicly known, it's there, meanwhile they're stealing all of our data but oh you can't aim a camera at us
[02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:39.480]  yeah right, it's kind of, they're hypocritical about this, I mean it's all, they're all hypocrites
[02:22:40.480 --> 02:22:44.480]  I mean they're violating the Constitution, they say they're not everything that's legal, well that's rectoactively passing laws
[02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:50.480]  the problem with that is, the laws that they pass have to abide to the Constitution
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:55.480]  and when you violate the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't matter what kind of law you pass that says it's okay to do that
[02:22:56.480 --> 02:22:58.480]  it's a violation of the Fourth Amendment that constitutes, and it's not constitutional
[02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:02.480]  and they've said all the Constitution's dead, you ignore it, it won't be a problem
[02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:05.480]  but now we see the President saying I'm going to open the borders without even an order
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:09.480]  not even Congress, not even an order from Obama, I'm going to come up with your guns without an order
[02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:15.480]  or without a law, they don't even do the fake orders now, they just do it, Obama announced yesterday
[02:23:15.480 --> 02:23:19.480]  no more four years for the White House, we're just not going to follow the law
[02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:26.480]  I mean this is dictatorship, not of Obama himself but of the system in my view
[02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:29.480]  how would you describe this slide?
[02:23:30.480 --> 02:23:37.480]  it's a slide into totalitarianism and an imperial presidency and control of population process
[02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:43.480]  I mean that's what they're doing, I mean they kept everybody in the dark so he had no informed electorate
[02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:47.480]  to make a decision about who to vote for about these issues or even raising these issues
[02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:51.480]  they're all avoiding this issue, and they have an uninformed Congress
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:58.480]  because that's why representatives of Amos and Connors got a group together of coalition of Republicans and Democrats
[02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:02.480]  to try to unfund NSA because they realized that they were being lied to by the agencies
[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:07.480]  and by the intelligence committees and by the administration about what was going on
[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:12.480]  so I mean they had an uninformed Congress and an uninformed electorate by design
[02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:18.480]  and that's basically what the Soviet Union, the Germans, that's basically what they did
[02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:23.480]  I got a lot of questions coming up for you William Benning and I want you to be able to speak on other topics you want to get into
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:27.480]  and go through some slides you gave us that Snowden leaked so you can break this down for people
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:31.480]  to kind of give us a roadmap of what's going on but my big question is
[02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:36.480]  as best you know not being there in 15 years but what's leaked and what people said
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:43.480]  how many people really have access to the big master files to go in and send an order in
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:51.480]  and then get all my emails from a year ago or go and see a file, a text file of a phone call I had last night
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:57.480]  how many people have access to this because if Snowden could really get access to all of this
[02:24:57.480 --> 02:25:01.480]  that means governments and spies could as well so even if we had good people in government
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:08.480]  which we know at the top we don't, they built this fraud, they've built something that could be taken over or hacked
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:13.480]  and thus compromise everything, you build something that spies on everything
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:18.480]  you've just built something that corporations, spies, private corporate criminals
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:22.480]  anybody can get into and exploit and sell and with government's history
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:26.480]  of selling driver's license, selling uranium, whatever the case is
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:31.480]  this looks like it's a giant bizarre of information that they've just opened up
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:38.480]  yes and internally in NSA they have no monitoring of the network as to what's going on and who's using it
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:41.480]  my estimate in terms of, I mean some of the numbers I've seen say that
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:45.480]  let's stop there, I don't mean to interrupt you, we monitor our network to see what people are doing around here
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:48.480]  we monitor to see if they're downloading stuff that's illegal, we have to liability
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:51.480]  the NSA doesn't monitor their own network
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:56.480]  that's right, in fact we had proposed in the SARC, the second automation research center
[02:25:57.480 --> 02:26:02.480]  we had proposed a program we called Well Grounded that said we wanted to monitor the entire worldwide network of NSA
[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:06.480]  who was on it, when they were on it, what they were doing, when they were there as they did it
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:10.480]  and it would be a matter of monitoring the network log like you probably do here
[02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:15.480]  the same principle, it's the idea where anybody on the network sends data down the line
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:17.480]  you can see what they're doing and it's recorded in the log
[02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:21.480]  so you can analyze that log with software and that's what we intended and proposed to do
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:26.480]  we had two groups opposing that, one were all the analysts saying you will be able to see everything I'm doing
[02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:28.480]  I don't want you monitoring
[02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:32.480]  but they're working in a secret government operation, they're the ones that should have a record
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:37.480]  plus plus that people could just sell their code and let anybody in
[02:26:38.480 --> 02:26:42.480]  I mean if I was a spy running America I would want there to be no monitoring
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:46.480]  yeah, well that's exactly what the analysts said
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:49.480]  but the real opposers of it were the managers
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:53.480]  and the reason they didn't want that happening was we could watch the movement of all the money
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:56.480]  we could see all the money being spent on every program
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:00.480]  to return on investment of every program, whether or not they were successful or not
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:03.480]  what companies were competing for to all of that kind of thing
[02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:07.480]  so they didn't want any oversight, so basically it's a giant looting operation
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:11.480]  exactly, in fact there is no oversight, there's no auditing of NSAID by Congress
[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:16.480]  Congress does not audit NSAID, this is a setup for corruption
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:21.480]  listen, I've had hundreds of employees over the years, we have 50 plus now, best career I've ever had, hands down
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:27.480]  but I've turned pretty much any employee loose to whatever they want in almost every case
[02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:30.480]  they end up going off the reservation causing problems
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:38.480]  I mean, the recipe of just leaving home to your 14 year old son for a year
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:42.480]  you'd come back, I mean it'd be a disaster, imagine a government agency
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:46.480]  with billions of dollars a month to spend and there's no oversight
[02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:49.480]  right, and they have no way of oversight
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:53.480]  I mean even the intelligence committees, all they can do is come out and get a briefing from the people at NSAID
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:56.480]  and all they hear is what they want to tell them
[02:27:56.480 --> 02:28:02.480]  and the same is true with the FISA court, the FISA court has no way of checking or verifying or validating what they're being told
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:06.480]  that was one of the main things we suggested to the president is how to fix NSAID
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:10.480]  is to have a technical group that would make sure that what they're telling them is true
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:16.480]  being very simply put, I suggest the hackers in the United States, they're the ones who want to find things and solve problems
[02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:21.480]  take these hackers, give them clearances and give them the authority to go into any agency
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:25.480]  in any intelligence community agency in the government
[02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:30.480]  sit at any terminal, look at any database, monitor every program they have and what their analysts are doing at any time
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:32.480]  basically auditors
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:35.480]  yes, and that would verify, be able to verify what they're being told is true
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:40.480]  right now there is no government in the world that can trust any intelligence agency they've created
[02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:47.480]  I was at Martin Springs last year on a sunny day with two guys and two women next to me on their towels
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:51.480]  and they were all police going to finish up degrees
[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:55.480]  two of them had just finished up to go work at the NSA in San Antonio
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:00.480]  they were bragging like they were James Bond and just blabbering classified stuff right next to me
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:05.480]  I looked at them and I said, you know, when we take this country back, you're going to be known as like the Nazis
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:09.480]  even if you think this is cute, you shouldn't be laying around in the grass blabbering about it
[02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:15.480]  yeah, see that's what my wife said to me right after we were raided by the FBI
[02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:17.480]  she said she wanted to leave the country
[02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:21.480]  because she thought this was basically the Gestapo coming in
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:22.480]  I mean they came in
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:28.480]  stay there sir, this is incredible and I'm going to have to shut up, I'm jumping in a lot because this is just so epic what you're breaking down
[02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:32.480]  William Benny, former technical director of the National Security Agency is with us
[02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:36.480]  he's going to get into whatever topics he wants to cover, break down where all this is going
[02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:42.480]  the awakening he sees happening, his meetings with Oliver Stone, Snowden Info and more
[02:29:42.480 --> 02:29:46.480]  straight ahead, we'll have to go into some overdrive if you've got the energy because this is epic information
[02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:50.480]  we're on the march, the Empire's on the run
[02:29:50.480 --> 02:30:12.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:30:20.480 --> 02:30:26.480]  William Benny, former technical director of the National Security Agency is with us

[02:32:57.480 --> 02:33:07.480]  you can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential
[02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:14.480]  program run amuck but when you actually look at the details
[02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:17.480]  then I think we've struck the right balance
[02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:22.480]  and if people can't trust not only the executive branch but also don't trust Congress
[02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:28.480]  and don't trust federal judges to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution
[02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:32.480]  due process and rule of law then we're going to have some problems
[02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:39.480]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war on or your mind
[02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:46.480]  all the evil men in charge seem to flourish as the good men and women do nothing
[02:33:47.480 --> 02:33:49.480]  things Edmund Burke said that British statesman
[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:53.480]  there are good people in the government the government's not our enemy
[02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:57.480]  the big corporations are doing as much spying as the NSA in certain areas
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:01.480]  it is the fact that we have let government corporations get out of control
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:05.480]  now there's no oversight they're doing whatever they want it's crazy
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:09.480]  William Benny former technical director of the national security agency
[02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:12.480]  one of the most high level whistleblowers of all time
[02:34:13.480 --> 02:34:16.480]  I mean he has exposed Benedict Arnold level primes
[02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:18.480]  they tried to put him in prison and failed
[02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:21.480]  they have successfully put other patriots in prison
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:23.480]  they put journalists in prison
[02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:26.480]  but for people in the government
[02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:30.480]  better choose a side because this is classic totalitarianism
[02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:33.480]  every top constitutional lawyer whether they're liberal or conservative
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:36.480]  has come out and said we're going over the edge this is scary
[02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:42.480]  even Congress is saying that but there's no oversight so it's just all out of control now
[02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:45.480]  now there are centralized groups that have a lot of power
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:49.480]  but the scariest thing is if this was a centralized system
[02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:51.480]  we could probably fix it a lot better
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:55.480]  William Benny and I'm going to give you the floor to cover a bunch of topics you want to get into
[02:34:56.480 --> 02:34:58.480]  and go over some of these graphics from Snowden
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:02.480]  am I right from your expert opinion that it's worse
[02:35:03.480 --> 02:35:06.480]  that there's not even oversight because there's all these many empires
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:10.480]  and God knows what's going on with just unlimited spying happening
[02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:12.480]  and Congress doesn't know what to do
[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:16.480]  I mean this is just crazy sounding is that worse
[02:35:17.480 --> 02:35:19.480]  than just having one centralized group running it
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:21.480]  because we could remove them
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:24.480]  I mean how do you ever get rid of something that's metastasized like this
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:30.480]  well that's one of the things that we put into suggestions of the presidents in January of last year
[02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:34.480]  we sent in 21 recommendations on how to fix NSA
[02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:38.480]  one of them was to have our group of technical people be able to monitor everything
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:41.480]  and we had another one to have focused collection of data
[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:47.480]  that's only that kind of data is what's pulled into the NSA
[02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:49.480]  not this bulk acquisition
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:52.480]  that removes the possibility of them even querying that data
[02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:55.480]  because now they can't even access it because it doesn't exist
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:00.480]  so if you did a focused attack like we did with our program Thin Thread back in the 90s
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:03.480]  that would have eliminated this bulk acquisition
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:05.480]  it couldn't do what they're doing
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:07.480]  no one could do love in it NSA
[02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:12.480]  the FBI and CIA can't get into this data to do whatever they want to like they can now
[02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:14.480]  because it wouldn't be there
[02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:16.480]  they can't alter the data because they can't get to it
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:18.480]  they can now
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:22.480]  but because under the Thin Thread program
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:24.480]  the data wouldn't even be stored there
[02:36:25.480 --> 02:36:26.480]  they wouldn't have it
[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:28.480]  so they wouldn't be able to do anything with it
[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:33.480]  that was the point we had a way of filtering out all domestic communications
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:34.480]  metadata, content, everything
[02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:37.480]  if it was domestic it didn't it just passed right by
[02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:41.480]  we could recognize it was domestic and not even take it in
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:43.480]  so we never even acquired it
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:45.480]  so it couldn't be stored in any NSA database
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:49.480]  it couldn't be accessed by any NSA analyst or anybody in the CIA
[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:53.480]  and so when you were there the NSA was truly spying on foreign adversaries
[02:36:54.480 --> 02:36:55.480]  yes but that
[02:36:56.480 --> 02:36:57.480]  but at General Hayden when he was director
[02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:02.480]  and it was Bush, Cheney, Hayden and Tenet that decided to spy on everybody
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:07.480]  that was to expand the authority of an NSA to go into in secret by the way
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:12.480]  to spy and collect data on every US citizen and everybody on the planet
[02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:14.480]  and so when they did that
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:16.480]  that's when I first saw that coming in
[02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:18.480]  that was when I had to wash my hands of NSA
[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:20.480]  I couldn't be a part of that
[02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:22.480]  I had to leave because that was just a
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:24.480]  I couldn't participate or even be associated with those crimes
[02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:27.480]  what did they say to you when you went into your superior's office
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:29.480]  I guess that'd be the head of the NSA
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:31.480]  what did you say?
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:33.480]  actually I didn't go to them at all
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:36.480]  I went directly to the House and Senate intelligence committees
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:39.480]  the reason was I knew very simply put
[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:42.480]  that everybody had been co-opted in the hierarchy of NSA
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:44.480]  they had committed the crime
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:47.480]  yes they had been, they were all a party to it
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:52.480]  all the lawyers, all of the senior managers in NSA had all followed orders from the White House
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:54.480]  from Cheney and Bush to do this
[02:37:55.480 --> 02:37:56.480]  and that's what Hayden directed them to say
[02:37:57.480 --> 02:37:59.480]  that this direction was coming from the White House
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:01.480]  therefore we're going to do it, it's lawful and we do it
[02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:03.480]  but to talk about what a hero and how much courage you've got
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:05.480]  I mean you know how serious people are in this government
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:08.480]  but they do worldwide how corrupted, gotten at that point
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:11.480]  you had the will to march into Congress
[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:13.480]  and to tell them what was going on
[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:16.480]  the first guy, I mean that's ten times bigger than Snowden internally
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:19.480]  and to really start this whole internal debate
[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:21.480]  and this avalanche of understanding now
[02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:24.480]  I mean you were really one of the first people to ring the bell
[02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:28.480]  to warn folks that the country as we knew it was being dismantled
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:30.480]  yes and in order to do that
[02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:32.480]  I had to meet with one of the staffers of the House Intelligence Committee
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:34.480]  Diane Rourke that I knew
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:36.480]  so I met with her at her house
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:38.480]  because we couldn't trust the House Intelligence Committee
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:40.480]  because they were a part of it
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:42.480]  and we also couldn't trust anybody in NSA
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:44.480]  so the only place that we'd find
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:48.480]  we could have a conversation or even talk about this
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:50.480]  was her house
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:52.480]  there was no other place that was secure
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:54.480]  in the supposed free country of America
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:38:56.480]  and then you get SWAT team, tell folks about that
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:38:58.480]  well yeah after that
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:00.480]  and after talking to other members of Congress
[02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:02.480]  and it was actually the morning of the second day
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:05.480]  after Attorney General Gonzalez's testimony
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:07.480]  to the Senate Judiciary Committee
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:09.480]  on the terrorist surveillance program
[02:39:10.480 --> 02:39:11.480]  where he only talked about the warrantless wiretap program
[02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:13.480]  that was the part that was exposed
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:15.480]  and claimed it was for al-Qaeda
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:17.480]  yeah right, that's right
[02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:19.480]  but that was only a smidgen of what they were doing
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:21.480]  I mean that was like an infinitesimal
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:23.480]  what they were really taking in
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:25.480]  at that time it must have been
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:27.480]  a lower percentage of phone calls
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:29.480]  but a vast majority of emails
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:31.480]  inside the United States as well as worldwide
[02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:33.480]  which I estimated to be now
[02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:35.480]  at least 80% of the phones calls
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:37.480]  in the United States are now being recorded somewhere
[02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:39.480]  that's how Tim Clemente could say that
[02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:40.480]  after the Boston bombing
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:42.480]  we can get back to what was said in a phone call
[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:44.480]  between one of the Sarnaya brothers
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:46.480]  and his wife before the bombing
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:48.480]  let's be clear they're saying it on television
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:50.480]  that they're recording all the calls
[02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:52.480]  but then denying it out of the next breath
[02:39:53.480 --> 02:39:54.480]  that was CNN
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:39:56.480]  also Dr. Mueller of the FBI
[02:39:57.480 --> 02:39:58.480]  in his Senate Judiciary testimony
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:00.480]  in 30th of March of 2011
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:02.480]  said that he got together with the Department of Defense
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:04.480]  and set up a database
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:06.480]  where he and the FBI could make one query
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:07.480]  and get all pass and all future emails on a person
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:09.480]  now that tells you that
[02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:11.480]  that's coming out of Bluffdale by the way
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:13.480]  all the data is being collected
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:15.480]  and stored
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:17.480]  and so it's not just phone calls
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:19.480]  it's emails it's everything else
[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:21.480]  and of course some of the recent publications
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:23.480]  show credit card use
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:25.480]  is being stored also
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:27.480]  how many people in the NSA
[02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:29.480]  how many people have a high enough clearance
[02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:31.480]  in government agencies period
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:33.480]  be able to go in and hear
[02:40:33.480 --> 02:40:35.480]  my phone calls Shay to my dad yesterday
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:37.480]  I believe the figures I've seen
[02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:40.480]  at least so it's been published
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:42.480]  is probably on the order of about 3,000
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:44.480]  government employees
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:46.480]  now that doesn't count contractors
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:48.480]  who are managing the data
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:50.480]  that's the real rub
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:52.480]  you have all these contractors
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:54.480]  who manage the communications
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:56.480]  the computers, the data stories
[02:40:57.480 --> 02:40:58.480]  the query programs
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:00.480]  and the communications back and forth
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:02.480]  and the level breach if they want
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:04.480]  because they don't have any monitoring system
[02:41:05.480 --> 02:41:06.480]  of them
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:08.480]  anybody with a system administrator
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:10.480]  or a super user case
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:12.480]  which is what he had
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:14.480]  people say there's no way Snowden could do it
[02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:16.480]  no it's like it's designed to bring the country down
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:18.480]  it's like it's designed to end our national security
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:20.480]  and then they're selling it as national security
[02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:22.480]  all that gets back to that program
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:24.480]  we wanted to put in place in 1991 or 92
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:26.480]  which was well grounded to monitor this
[02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:28.480]  and we were opposed by the analysts
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:29.480]  because of all the materiality exposed
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:31.480]  that they were doing
[02:41:32.480 --> 02:41:33.480]  but that meant that they left the entire network
[02:41:34.480 --> 02:41:35.480]  with no monitoring system at all
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:37.480]  that's why they can't tell what Snowden took
[02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:39.480]  they don't have any idea
[02:41:40.480 --> 02:41:41.480]  they're guessing 1.7 million
[02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:43.480]  what's behind an open border
[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:45.480]  what's behind an open NSA
[02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:47.480]  what's behind at the end of the day
[02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:49.480]  what do you think the different power elites
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:51.480]  are thinking
[02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:54.480]  I basically see us moving to a controlled society
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:41:55.480]  a totalitarian state
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:41:57.480]  where it is
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:41:59.480]  the government wants to be in charge
[02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:01.480]  I mean when Reagan said
[02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:03.480]  we're a country with a government
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:05.480]  I think we're now a government with a country
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:07.480]  and all of the things that are happening
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:09.480]  are only tightening that control on the people
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:11.480]  they're going to manipulate them
[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:13.480]  and as long as they can keep them
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:15.480]  uninformed
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:17.480]  and nobody realizes what's going on
[02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:19.480]  or they don't see the threat
[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:21.480]  if they say you have nothing
[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:23.480]  if you've done nothing wrong you have nothing to hide
[02:42:24.480 --> 02:42:25.480]  first of all that's a great quote
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:27.480]  from Joseph Goebbels
[02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:29.480]  and secondly that's totally irrelevant
[02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:31.480]  yeah they're actually quoting Joseph Goebbels
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:33.480]  on a routine basis
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:35.480]  it's like satire
[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:37.480]  it's like the lies they keep saying
[02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:39.480]  that's right out of Hitler's playbook
[02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:41.480]  if you're going to tell a lie
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:43.480]  make it a big one and tell it frequently
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:45.480]  till it's believed
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:47.480]  and that's what's going on here
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:49.480]  and we're assuming that we trust our government
[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:50.480]  well that's just wrong
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:52.480]  it's just a bunch of corporations
[02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:54.480]  and private contractors screwing us over
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:42:56.480]  for money, yes
[02:42:57.480 --> 02:42:58.480]  I've been basically said what they did
[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:00.480]  after 9-11 was trade the security
[02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:02.480]  of the people of the United States
[02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:04.480]  and of the world for money
[02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:06.480]  because it was all about money
[02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:08.480]  it wasn't about solving the problem
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:10.480]  in fact I originally had
[02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:12.480]  because of this problem
[02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:14.480]  the contractors not really solving the problem
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:16.480]  I kept thinking well their vision statement
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:18.480]  aimed low and miss you know
[02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:20.480]  sure that was what I thought originally
[02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:22.480]  but really in the end it's keep the problem
[02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:24.480]  going so the money keeps flowing
[02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:26.480]  that's the real issue
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:28.480]  their problem is getting the next contract
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:30.480]  if you solve the problem you don't have the problem
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:32.480]  to get money
[02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:34.480]  that's their philosophy
[02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:36.480]  and that's why they've had a lot of top geopolitical
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:38.480]  analysts admit now that
[02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:40.480]  that's why we have such a corrupt global elite
[02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:42.480]  is because they don't ever want to fix any problems
[02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:44.480]  because they're getting contracts
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:45.480]  they're getting worse
[02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:47.480]  but if they end up destabilizing the whole planet
[02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:49.480]  and bringing down civilization
[02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:51.480]  then all their Swiss bank money
[02:43:52.480 --> 02:43:53.480]  isn't going to buy Jack's quad
[02:43:54.480 --> 02:43:55.480]  that's another problem with the programs
[02:43:56.480 --> 02:43:57.480]  that they've been doing
[02:43:58.480 --> 02:43:59.480]  like recognizing weaknesses
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:01.480]  and firewalls and operating systems
[02:44:02.480 --> 02:44:03.480]  and weakening encryption systems
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:05.480]  with the bull run program for example
[02:44:06.480 --> 02:44:07.480]  for out of NSA
[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:09.480]  that's weakening all those things
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:11.480]  around the world for everybody
[02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:13.480]  there's back doors and things like that
[02:44:14.480 --> 02:44:15.480]  they're building back doors
[02:44:16.480 --> 02:44:17.480]  and being sappers
[02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:19.480]  for real criminals in groups out there
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:21.480]  but also weakening encryption systems
[02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:23.480]  so that you can penetrate them and read them
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:25.480]  so the point is that
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:27.480]  NSA has no monopoly on smart people
[02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:29.480]  people around the world
[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:31.480]  hackers and people in Russia
[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:33.480]  and China and so on all around the world
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:35.480]  also have smart people
[02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:37.480]  and they can go in and hack into systems
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:39.480]  and recognize these weaknesses in the firewalls
[02:44:39.480 --> 02:44:40.480]  and operating systems
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:42.480]  and the encryption systems
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:44.480]  so they can penetrate everything too
[02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:46.480]  I mean the point is
[02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:48.480]  if you keep those things weak
[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:50.480]  which is what the operational side
[02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:52.480]  of NSA wants to do
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:54.480]  because then that allows them to see
[02:44:55.480 --> 02:44:56.480]  into what you're doing
[02:44:57.480 --> 02:44:58.480]  that can penetrate
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:00.480]  that's like saying we want the average
[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:02.480]  American to have a 70 IQ
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:04.480]  because that makes us more manageable
[02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:06.480]  will just then be a nation of
[02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:08.480]  technology like that
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:10.480]  but it's like make us totally wide open
[02:45:11.480 --> 02:45:12.480]  so we can spy on you
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:14.480]  not seeing the fact that it just opens
[02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:16.480]  the world up to all these data breaches
[02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:18.480]  every day
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:20.480]  Bank of America or this or Google
[02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:22.480]  losing millions of this millions of that
[02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:24.480]  credit cards not working
[02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:26.480]  my bank accounts
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:28.480]  constantly having people doing stuff
[02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:30.480]  I mean it's just a mess
[02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:32.480]  and there's another
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:34.480]  contradictory point here too
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:35.480]  I think it is supposed to secure
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:37.480]  communications within the United States
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:39.480]  for the government and for anybody else
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:41.480]  they're supposed to share technology
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:43.480]  so they can improve the security of their
[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:45.480]  networks
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:47.480]  well that's working against the
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:49.480]  operational side that wants to penetrate
[02:45:50.480 --> 02:45:51.480]  those networks
[02:45:52.480 --> 02:45:53.480]  so on the one side you're trying to defend
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:55.480]  them and the other you're trying to attack
[02:45:56.480 --> 02:45:57.480]  them so the point is
[02:45:58.480 --> 02:45:59.480]  when I was in operations
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:01.480]  I had solved the system I thought was
[02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:03.480]  well the IAD people also do that
[02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:05.480]  for our side so I would go over and talk
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:07.480]  to them about what I've just solved
[02:46:08.480 --> 02:46:09.480]  from the other side the operations
[02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:11.480]  side and tell them here's the solution
[02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:13.480]  on the bad guys and is this very
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:15.480]  similar isn't this very similar to
[02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:17.480]  what you do for ours and shouldn't
[02:46:18.480 --> 02:46:19.480]  you watch for these kind of penetrations
[02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:21.480]  that I can do over here
[02:46:22.480 --> 02:46:23.480]  and they wouldn't talk to me about
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:25.480]  there's well we have hackers that call
[02:46:26.480 --> 02:46:27.480]  us some famous ones and they tell us
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:29.480]  holes and stuff we've got they help
[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:30.480]  that didn't well they didn't want to
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:32.480]  communicate and share that kind of
[02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:34.480]  knowledge but I told them my side so
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:36.480]  they can use it defensively but I'm
[02:46:37.480 --> 02:46:38.480]  but by doing the things they're doing
[02:46:39.480 --> 02:46:40.480]  the operation side seeing all the
[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:42.480]  weakness isn't telling the defensive
[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:44.480]  side that they wow so these agencies
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:46.480]  you always hear this but they really
[02:46:47.480 --> 02:46:48.480]  are their own little fiefdoms waging
[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:50.480]  war against each other and that
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:52.480]  doesn't count going to CIA and the
[02:46:53.480 --> 02:46:54.480]  the conflicts between CIA and NSA
[02:46:55.480 --> 02:46:56.480]  is like a competition who has the
[02:46:56.480 --> 02:46:58.480]  power to stop some people say I don't
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:00.480]  know if it's true or not you've talked
[02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:02.480]  Oliver Stone he's talking to Snowden
[02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:04.480]  that Snowden could be a CIA
[02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:06.480]  operative in a dirty war about taking
[02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:08.480]  some of the power away from NSA
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:10.480]  I think that's basically an effort
[02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:12.480]  that deflect what it what Snowden
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:14.480]  is compromised and sent and get to
[02:47:15.480 --> 02:47:16.480]  get published about what's going on
[02:47:17.480 --> 02:47:18.480]  it's a it's a side issue they try to
[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:20.480]  deflect the narrative to something
[02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:22.480]  else because CIA is a part of this
[02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:24.480]  CIA and in some of the materials
[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:25.480]  that Snowden has released it shows
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:27.480]  the NS the CIA connection into the
[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:29.480]  NSA databases which exposes all that
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:32.480]  data to CIA as well as the FBI
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:34.480]  and that's how they do the parallel
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:36.480]  constructed first go in and get the
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:38.480]  data from NSA and then they have to
[02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:40.480]  do a parallel construction that's
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:42.480]  how the FBI and DEA do it and they
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:44.480]  have that direct or almost direct
[02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:46.480]  access into those databases.
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:48.480]  It is surreal that I'm 41 years old
[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:50.480]  and I'm sitting here reaching
[02:47:51.480 --> 02:47:52.480]  millions of people with William
[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:53.480]  Benny the former technical director
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:55.480]  of the NSA who ran warfare operations
[02:47:56.480 --> 02:47:57.480]  against all these other governments
[02:47:58.480 --> 02:47:59.480]  and you're here telling me that we're
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:01.480]  going into a total tyranny.
[02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:03.480]  I've got all these questions these
[02:48:04.480 --> 02:48:05.480]  Twitter questions that was one of them
[02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:07.480]  we've got all these open phones
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:09.480]  I'll give the number out for a couple
[02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:11.480]  calls 800-259-9231-800-2599-231
[02:48:15.480 --> 02:48:16.480]  we're going to break here in a few
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:18.480]  minutes we'll do a little bit overdrive
[02:48:19.480 --> 02:48:20.480]  and then I'm just so thankful to
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:21.480]  have you here.
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:24.480]  What else are key tidbits you'd
[02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:26.480]  like to impart to the listeners and
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:28.480]  viewers out there about what we're
[02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:30.480]  dealing with and how you think we
[02:48:31.480 --> 02:48:32.480]  may be able to change it and then
[02:48:33.480 --> 02:48:34.480]  separately you said you think there
[02:48:35.480 --> 02:48:36.480]  is an awakening happening.
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:38.480]  I believe there is one of the major
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:40.480]  aspects though that I wanted to
[02:48:41.480 --> 02:48:42.480]  point out here and that's I have it
[02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:44.480]  in some of the slides.
[02:48:45.480 --> 02:48:46.480]  It was a program called the
[02:48:47.480 --> 02:48:48.480]  treasure map and the objective
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:49.480]  advice is in the world on the
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:51.480]  network.
[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:53.480]  Every computer, every phone, every
[02:48:54.480 --> 02:48:55.480]  mobile are fixed and monitor them
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:48:57.480]  every minute of every day.
[02:48:58.480 --> 02:48:59.480]  So that's keeping a constant track
[02:49:00.480 --> 02:49:01.480]  on where you are and where you're
[02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:03.480]  moving and where you've been at
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:05.480]  what time.
[02:49:06.480 --> 02:49:07.480]  And that paired up with the content
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:09.480]  collection and metadata collection
[02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:11.480]  shows them who you are, who you're
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:13.480]  talking to, what you're talking
[02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:15.480]  about and perhaps even why you're
[02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:17.480]  trying to do it.
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:19.480]  And then you pair that up with the
[02:49:20.480 --> 02:49:21.480]  treasure map type approach getting
[02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:23.480]  you the when, when you are somewhere
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:25.480]  and where you are when you're doing
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:27.480]  this.
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:29.480]  That gives you all the components of
[02:49:30.480 --> 02:49:31.480]  a story of your life.
[02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:33.480]  And that's what they're really doing
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:35.480]  they're pulling all of this data
[02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:37.480]  together to get an entire picture
[02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:39.480]  of your life, of everybody on the
[02:49:40.480 --> 02:49:41.480]  planet.
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:43.480]  At least the objective seems to be
[02:49:43.480 --> 02:49:45.480]  four billion people and
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:47.480]  monitoring them where they are
[02:49:48.480 --> 02:49:49.480]  constantly throughout the day.
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:51.480]  And we're showing some of the
[02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:53.480]  Snowden documents here as you speak.
[02:49:54.480 --> 02:49:55.480]  Yes.
[02:49:57.480 --> 02:49:58.480]  If you want to back up one.
[02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:00.480]  Yeah, that slide shows all of the
[02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:02.480]  programs internally in NSA and how
[02:50:03.480 --> 02:50:04.480]  CIA and FBI access them.
[02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:06.480]  Skip this break too guys, this is
[02:50:07.480 --> 02:50:08.480]  too important.
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:10.480]  So they go into these programs,
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:12.480]  the programs on the right basically
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:14.480]  index the metadata.
[02:50:15.480 --> 02:50:16.480]  They build the social networks for
[02:50:17.480 --> 02:50:18.480]  that's Mainway and Marina.
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:20.480]  All of this was denied, all of this
[02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:22.480]  illegal.
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:24.480]  Right.
[02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:26.480]  But it also is storing the content
[02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:28.480]  in pinwheel or the digital network
[02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:30.480]  and the voices in the nucleon.
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:32.480]  That's where the content is stored
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:34.480]  and it's indexed against the
[02:50:35.480 --> 02:50:36.480]  relationships that are built in
[02:50:37.480 --> 02:50:38.480]  the graphs in Mainway and Marina
[02:50:38.480 --> 02:50:39.480]  and then they say, okay, give me all
[02:50:40.480 --> 02:50:41.480]  the content that goes with it and
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:43.480]  it gets pulled out from those two
[02:50:44.480 --> 02:50:45.480]  databases.
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:47.480]  So they go through and see the
[02:50:48.480 --> 02:50:49.480]  metadata, see the key things that
[02:50:50.480 --> 02:50:51.480]  the algorithm picks that they think
[02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:53.480]  might be important, then they can
[02:50:54.480 --> 02:50:55.480]  drill down and hear you having
[02:50:56.480 --> 02:50:57.480]  phone sex with your wife.
[02:50:58.480 --> 02:50:59.480]  Exactly.
[02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:01.480]  And it's also true of CIA and FBI
[02:51:02.480 --> 02:51:03.480]  they've got access to that too.
[02:51:04.480 --> 02:51:05.480]  So that's how they do the research
[02:51:05.480 --> 02:51:07.480]  and that's where they're in your
[02:51:08.480 --> 02:51:09.480]  file.
[02:51:10.480 --> 02:51:11.480]  Right, exactly.
[02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:13.480]  And they've been caught, as you
[02:51:14.480 --> 02:51:15.480]  know, as you said, even when
[02:51:16.480 --> 02:51:17.480]  yourself, just making stuff up
[02:51:18.480 --> 02:51:19.480]  too.
[02:51:20.480 --> 02:51:21.480]  They can just add stuff in there.
[02:51:22.480 --> 02:51:23.480]  Yes, that gives them the opportunity
[02:51:24.480 --> 02:51:25.480]  to go in and modify anything they
[02:51:26.480 --> 02:51:27.480]  have.
[02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:29.480]  And they now with voice print
[02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:31.480]  analysis for a long time can take
[02:51:32.480 --> 02:51:33.480]  a recording of your voice with
[02:51:33.480 --> 02:51:34.480]  voice print analysis.
[02:51:35.480 --> 02:51:36.480]  And the public doesn't know they
[02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:38.480]  can manipulate DNA, they can
[02:51:39.480 --> 02:51:40.480]  manipulate biometrics, they can
[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:42.480]  manipulate voice.
[02:51:43.480 --> 02:51:44.480]  Well, even some of the metrics
[02:51:45.480 --> 02:51:46.480]  that they're using in terms of
[02:51:47.480 --> 02:51:48.480]  biometrics, that's kind of within
[02:51:49.480 --> 02:51:50.480]  a range of probabilities.
[02:51:51.480 --> 02:51:52.480]  So that's still when they claim
[02:51:53.480 --> 02:51:54.480]  if they claim they have a match
[02:51:55.480 --> 02:51:56.480]  that's not necessarily a match,
[02:51:57.480 --> 02:51:58.480]  but they can claim it based on
[02:51:59.480 --> 02:52:00.480]  the probabilities that they're
[02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:01.480]  using.
[02:52:02.480 --> 02:52:03.480]  Right, those things are only
[02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:05.480]  accurate up to a degree and they
[02:52:06.480 --> 02:52:07.480]  won't tell you that that's true
[02:52:08.480 --> 02:52:09.480]  because it weakens their argument.
[02:52:10.480 --> 02:52:11.480]  Can you imagine if Stalin or
[02:52:12.480 --> 02:52:13.480]  Hitler would add stuff like this?
[02:52:14.480 --> 02:52:15.480]  Well, just think back in the
[02:52:16.480 --> 02:52:17.480]  revolution, Washington and the
[02:52:18.480 --> 02:52:19.480]  Continental Congress would have
[02:52:20.480 --> 02:52:21.480]  been erased immediately.
[02:52:22.480 --> 02:52:23.480]  And they used codes themselves.
[02:52:24.480 --> 02:52:25.480]  Yeah.
[02:52:26.480 --> 02:52:27.480]  But I mean, they wouldn't have had
[02:52:27.480 --> 02:52:29.480]  that. And then this will just allow
[02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:31.480]  tyranny to get the biggest, fattest
[02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:33.480]  and most evil it ever has.
[02:52:34.480 --> 02:52:35.480]  Yes.
[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:37.480]  I think we're in for some serious
[02:52:38.480 --> 02:52:39.480]  times.
[02:52:40.480 --> 02:52:41.480]  Yes, we are.
[02:52:42.480 --> 02:52:43.480]  A lot of folks are just going to
[02:52:44.480 --> 02:52:45.480]  surrender, but his history shows
[02:52:46.480 --> 02:52:47.480]  you surrender to tyrants, it gets
[02:52:48.480 --> 02:52:49.480]  really bad.
[02:52:50.480 --> 02:52:51.480]  Yes.
[02:52:52.480 --> 02:52:53.480]  Unfortunately, and when they say
[02:52:54.480 --> 02:52:55.480]  they don't collect content or
[02:52:55.480 --> 02:52:56.480]  it's not random, it's directed.
[02:52:57.480 --> 02:52:58.480]  It's based at convergent points
[02:52:59.480 --> 02:53:00.480]  where fibers converge, where they
[02:53:01.480 --> 02:53:02.480]  put collection devices where it
[02:53:02.480 --> 02:53:03.480]  gives them a...
[02:53:04.480 --> 02:53:05.480]  Sure, the key hops.
[02:53:06.480 --> 02:53:07.480]  There it is.
[02:53:08.480 --> 02:53:09.480]  That's worldwide.
[02:53:10.480 --> 02:53:11.480]  That's it, right there.
[02:53:12.480 --> 02:53:13.480]  And it's basically following the
[02:53:14.480 --> 02:53:15.480]  distribution of the population of
[02:53:16.480 --> 02:53:17.480]  the United States.
[02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:19.480]  And also, as they claim, they were
[02:53:20.480 --> 02:53:21.480]  only after foreign communications.
[02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:23.480]  If they were only after foreign
[02:53:23.480 --> 02:53:24.480]  communications, the only sites they
[02:53:25.480 --> 02:53:26.480]  would need would be along the coast
[02:53:27.480 --> 02:53:28.480]  with a trans-oceanic cable surface.
[02:53:29.480 --> 02:53:30.480]  Sure.
[02:53:31.480 --> 02:53:32.480]  Otherwise, all the other collection
[02:53:32.480 --> 02:53:33.480]  points in there are domestic.
[02:53:34.480 --> 02:53:35.480]  And there's 80 to 100 taps.
[02:53:36.480 --> 02:53:37.480]  And those are the major points for
[02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:39.480]  major sites for...
[02:53:40.480 --> 02:53:41.480]  And we have these Death Star plans
[02:53:42.480 --> 02:53:43.480]  because of Snowden.
[02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:45.480]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:53:46.480 --> 02:53:47.480]  Many boffins die to get us this
[02:53:48.480 --> 02:53:49.480]  information.
[02:53:50.480 --> 02:53:51.480]  I mean, this to me is the crime.
[02:53:51.480 --> 02:53:52.480]  It's a domestic spying on a crime.
[02:53:53.480 --> 02:53:54.480]  And we have them and they flip it
[02:53:55.480 --> 02:53:56.480]  around on Snowden.
[02:53:57.480 --> 02:53:58.480]  Right.
[02:53:59.480 --> 02:54:00.480]  Well, you have to...
[02:54:00.480 --> 02:54:01.480]  When he's exposing a crime.
[02:54:02.480 --> 02:54:03.480]  You have to change the narrative.
[02:54:04.480 --> 02:54:05.480]  I mean, this is illegal.
[02:54:06.480 --> 02:54:07.480]  Yes.
[02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:09.480]  But so is Obama saying the border
[02:54:10.480 --> 02:54:11.480]  is going to be wide open
[02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:13.480]  or he can ban Green Tip Ammo.
[02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:15.480]  What we have is a government that's
[02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:17.480]  above the law.
[02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:19.480]  Only we are subjected to the law
[02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:20.480]  that real Alex Jones.
[02:54:21.480 --> 02:54:22.480]  Why haven't we begun impeachment
[02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:24.480]  recall process for the feds
[02:54:25.480 --> 02:54:26.480]  funding, I got examples of them
[02:54:27.480 --> 02:54:28.480]  funding terrorists and spying the
[02:54:29.480 --> 02:54:30.480]  blackmail public officials?
[02:54:31.480 --> 02:54:32.480]  Why haven't we?
[02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:34.480]  I think it's just a continuation
[02:54:35.480 --> 02:54:36.480]  of their doing what they want to
[02:54:37.480 --> 02:54:38.480]  do and they feel they're above the
[02:54:39.480 --> 02:54:40.480]  law.
[02:54:41.480 --> 02:54:42.480]  For example, when Nancy Pelosi,
[02:54:43.480 --> 02:54:44.480]  when she was Speaker of the House
[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:46.480]  said impeaching George Bush is off
[02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:48.480]  to impeach George Bush, George could
[02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:50.480]  say to her, you have to impeach
[02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:52.480]  yourself as you're a part of this.
[02:54:53.480 --> 02:54:54.480]  That's how Julius Caesar, who you
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:54:56.480]  mentioned earlier, got control as
[02:54:57.480 --> 02:54:58.480]  he corrupted the patrician families
[02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:00.480]  so they were part of it.
[02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:02.480]  This was all done in secret too,
[02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:04.480]  by the way.
[02:55:05.480 --> 02:55:06.480]  They were given secret briefings.
[02:55:07.480 --> 02:55:08.480]  They couldn't talk about it.
[02:55:09.480 --> 02:55:10.480]  Rockefeller talked in his letter to
[02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:12.480]  Cheney about this, that I'm not a
[02:55:13.480 --> 02:55:14.480]  technician, I'm not a legal person
[02:55:14.480 --> 02:55:15.480]  and it was all they had to do at
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:17.480]  that point was say anybody from the
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:19.480]  House should have stood up and said
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:21.480]  look, this is obviously unconstitutional.
[02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:23.480]  If you don't stop this, I'm going
[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:25.480]  to introduce impeachment procedures
[02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:27.480]  against you and the House.
[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:29.480]  And now the Cheney's out of the
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:31.480]  bottle and the Russians and everybody
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:33.480]  else are doing it?
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:35.480]  Yes.
[02:55:36.480 --> 02:55:37.480]  And then they argue, well, they're
[02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:39.480]  doing it, we've got to do it.
[02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:41.480]  This is a disaster.
[02:55:41.480 --> 02:55:43.480]  They don't get all the actual data.
[02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:45.480]  I mean, they've lied about it so much
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:47.480]  they're recording everything.
[02:55:48.480 --> 02:55:49.480]  Oh my gosh.
[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:53.480]  There's so many things to get to in
[02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:55.480]  these questions.
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:55:57.480]  Over and over again they ask,
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:55:59.480]  how do we throw off this tyranny?
[02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:01.480]  What can we do?
[02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:03.480]  Well, I mean the two, I mean the
[02:56:04.480 --> 02:56:05.480]  main approach right now I think is
[02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:07.480]  you have to hammer your representatives
[02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:09.480]  and senators and not just with
[02:56:09.480 --> 02:56:10.480]  files or Twitter or phone calls,
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:12.480]  but also when they come to public
[02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:14.480]  forums with the public town
[02:56:15.480 --> 02:56:16.480]  meetings, get up and embarrass them
[02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:18.480]  with asking questions of why aren't
[02:56:19.480 --> 02:56:20.480]  you living up to your office,
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:22.480]  oath of office to defend the
[02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:24.480]  Constitution because under this
[02:56:25.480 --> 02:56:26.480]  spying they're violating all our
[02:56:27.480 --> 02:56:28.480]  constitutional rights of privacy.
[02:56:29.480 --> 02:56:30.480]  And we know they're using it to
[02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:32.480]  frame people.
[02:56:33.480 --> 02:56:34.480]  I want to go to some phone calls
[02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:36.480]  but what about Google and Facebook
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:38.480]  they're engaged in spying, I mean,
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:40.480]  Hertz is putting cameras in the cars.
[02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:42.480]  That's mainstream news.
[02:56:43.480 --> 02:56:44.480]  Samsung admits their TVs are
[02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:46.480]  recording and watching you.
[02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:48.480]  They're now putting the terms and
[02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:50.480]  conditions of iPhones and droids.
[02:56:51.480 --> 02:56:52.480]  Yes, we're actually recording your
[02:56:53.480 --> 02:56:54.480]  voice.
[02:56:55.480 --> 02:56:56.480]  I mean, I guess they're trying to
[02:56:57.480 --> 02:56:58.480]  cover their butts now and they're
[02:56:59.480 --> 02:57:00.480]  doing it too.
[02:57:01.480 --> 02:57:02.480]  Yes, and I think all of this should
[02:57:03.480 --> 02:57:04.480]  be declared unconstitutional or
[02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:05.480]  unconstitutional.
[02:57:06.480 --> 02:57:07.480]  I mean, I think that's the point
[02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:09.480]  that's the point.
[02:57:10.480 --> 02:57:11.480]  I mean, if you're weak in systems
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:13.480]  everybody can get in.
[02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:15.480]  So, and the other point is very
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:17.480]  simple that by when these
[02:57:18.480 --> 02:57:19.480]  companies are doing this, this is
[02:57:20.480 --> 02:57:21.480]  a rich environment for NSA and CIA
[02:57:22.480 --> 02:57:23.480]  to mine and the FBI.
[02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:25.480]  And they say, OK, now this
[02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:27.480]  environment we want and we
[02:57:28.480 --> 02:57:29.480]  require you to give it to us.
[02:57:30.480 --> 02:57:31.480]  If you don't give it to us, we
[02:57:31.480 --> 02:57:33.480]  don't have the money for it.
[02:57:34.480 --> 02:57:35.480]  We don't have the money for it.
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:37.480]  We don't have the money for
[02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:39.480]  the terms that you use to pass
[02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:41.480]  the data and we'll get it all
[02:57:42.480 --> 02:57:43.480]  anyway.
[02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:45.480]  And then there's a payment.
[02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:47.480]  Sometimes they pay for it as well.
[02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:49.480]  There's a schedule for paying for
[02:57:50.480 --> 02:57:51.480]  it.
[02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:53.480]  But now they're bypassing with
[02:57:54.480 --> 02:57:55.480]  all these shelves, towers and
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:57:57.480]  stingrays, they're just building
[02:57:58.480 --> 02:57:59.480]  their own networks to spy on us.
[02:57:59.480 --> 02:58:00.480]  And then there's a schedule in
[02:58:01.480 --> 02:58:02.480]  plan that says I want everything
[02:58:03.480 --> 02:58:04.480]  you do.
[02:58:05.480 --> 02:58:06.480]  I can't believe we're coming
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:08.480]  towards the end of the interview.
[02:58:09.480 --> 02:58:10.480]  We got a little bit of overdrive
[02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:12.480]  coming up.
[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:14.480]  I want to go to Brian, John,
[02:58:15.480 --> 02:58:16.480]  Scottie, Matthew and a few others
[02:58:17.480 --> 02:58:18.480]  on the other side.
[02:58:19.480 --> 02:58:20.480]  My head is spinning.
[02:58:21.480 --> 02:58:22.480]  William Benny is our guest.
[02:58:23.480 --> 02:58:24.480]  Please financially support this
[02:58:25.480 --> 02:58:26.480]  show.
[02:58:26.480 --> 02:58:28.480]  This is the final day of the

[02:58:31.480 --> 02:58:32.480]  FullWarsLife.com.

[02:58:35.480 --> 02:58:36.480]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:41.480 --> 02:58:42.480]  This is GCN, the Genesis
[02:58:43.480 --> 02:58:44.480]  Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:48.480 --> 02:58:49.480]  Another major health threat.
[02:58:50.480 --> 02:58:51.480]  This one in Toledo, Ohio where
[02:58:52.480 --> 02:58:53.480]  everybody in the entire city has
[02:58:53.480 --> 02:58:55.480]  been told not to drink the water.
[02:58:56.480 --> 02:58:57.480]  Ohio Governor declaring a state
[02:58:58.480 --> 02:58:59.480]  of emergency.
[02:59:00.480 --> 02:59:01.480]  Did you know that the average
[02:59:02.480 --> 02:59:03.480]  person uses about 80 to 100 gallons
[02:59:04.480 --> 02:59:05.480]  of water at home every single day?
[02:59:06.480 --> 02:59:07.480]  If there's a water emergency,
[02:59:08.480 --> 02:59:09.480]  will you be prepared?
[02:59:10.480 --> 02:59:11.480]  Panicked residents forming long
[02:59:12.480 --> 02:59:13.480]  lines throughout the day.
[02:59:14.480 --> 02:59:15.480]  We're here at a supermarket in
[02:59:16.480 --> 02:59:17.480]  Toledo, you can see the shelves
[02:59:18.480 --> 02:59:19.480]  empty where water once was.
[02:59:20.480 --> 02:59:21.480]  To stay safe and healthy during
[02:59:21.480 --> 02:59:22.480]  an emergency, go to
[02:59:23.480 --> 02:59:24.480]  water which will not be available
[02:59:25.480 --> 02:59:26.480]  at your local grocery store.
[02:59:27.480 --> 02:59:28.480]  There's a mad dash on right now
[02:59:29.480 --> 02:59:30.480]  to stock up on supplies.

[02:59:51.480 --> 02:59:52.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:53.480 --> 02:59:54.480]  show.
[02:59:59.480 --> 03:00:00.480]  The Genesis Communications Radio
[03:00:01.480 --> 03:00:02.480]  Network proudly presents the
[03:00:03.480 --> 03:00:04.480]  Alex Jones show because
[03:00:05.480 --> 03:00:06.480]  there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:14.480 --> 03:00:15.480]  Well, it's epic, ladies and
[03:00:16.480 --> 03:00:17.480]  gentlemen.
[03:00:17.480 --> 03:00:18.480]  William Benny is here with us
[03:00:19.480 --> 03:00:20.480]  right now, former technical
[03:00:21.480 --> 03:00:22.480]  director of the National
[03:00:23.480 --> 03:00:24.480]  Security Agency, just exposing
[03:00:25.480 --> 03:00:26.480]  mass crime and a criminal
[03:00:27.480 --> 03:00:28.480]  conspiracy of arrogance and
[03:00:29.480 --> 03:00:30.480]  fraud that destroys our national
[03:00:31.480 --> 03:00:32.480]  security, destroys our children's
[03:00:33.480 --> 03:00:34.480]  futures, and is openly used to
[03:00:35.480 --> 03:00:36.480]  just rape our basic liberties.
[03:00:37.480 --> 03:00:38.480]  Brian, in Florida, you're on the
[03:00:39.480 --> 03:00:40.480]  year with William Benny, go ahead.
[03:00:41.480 --> 03:00:42.480]  Yes, Mr. Benny.
[03:00:43.480 --> 03:00:44.480]  I have a question.
[03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:46.480]  I'm a retired CT from the Navy,
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:48.480]  so you probably know what they are.
[03:00:49.480 --> 03:00:51.480]  But the way I look at everything,
[03:00:52.480 --> 03:00:53.480]  there is probably no way 100%
[03:00:54.480 --> 03:00:55.480]  you could ever secure your
[03:00:56.480 --> 03:00:57.480]  information. Is that correct?
[03:00:58.480 --> 03:00:59.480]  Yeah, that's pretty much correct.
[03:01:00.480 --> 03:01:01.480]  The way things stand right now.
[03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:03.480]  Yeah, that's what I was figuring.
[03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:05.480]  While other callers come on,
[03:01:06.480 --> 03:01:07.480]  when God bless you for what you're doing.
[03:01:08.480 --> 03:01:09.480]  Thank you.
[03:01:10.480 --> 03:01:11.480]  Go ahead, callers, sorry. Go ahead.
[03:01:11.480 --> 03:01:13.480]  No, sir.
[03:01:14.480 --> 03:01:15.480]  Thank you so much.
[03:01:16.480 --> 03:01:18.480]  William, isn't it surreal
[03:01:19.480 --> 03:01:21.480]  to know we really became,
[03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:23.480]  when it comes to surveillance,
[03:01:24.480 --> 03:01:26.480]  1,000 light years ahead of 1984?
[03:01:27.480 --> 03:01:28.480]  Yes, and in fact,
[03:01:29.480 --> 03:01:31.480]  I would only quote Wolfgang Schmidt,
[03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:33.480]  a former Lieutenant Colonel
[03:01:34.480 --> 03:01:35.480]  in the East German Stasi.
[03:01:36.480 --> 03:01:37.480]  When he was talking about the NSA
[03:01:38.480 --> 03:01:39.480]  spying data, he said to us,
[03:01:39.480 --> 03:01:40.480]  this would have been a dream come true.
[03:01:41.480 --> 03:01:42.480]  Because they had to work really hard
[03:01:43.480 --> 03:01:44.480]  to get what they got.
[03:01:45.480 --> 03:01:46.480]  They had hundreds of thousands of files
[03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:48.480]  on everybody in East Germany.
[03:01:49.480 --> 03:01:50.480]  It was handwritten files,
[03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:52.480]  so it was less efficient,
[03:01:53.480 --> 03:01:54.480]  less up-to-date, less consolidated,
[03:01:55.480 --> 03:01:56.480]  less interactive, less in,
[03:01:57.480 --> 03:01:58.480]  you couldn't query it like you can today
[03:01:59.480 --> 03:02:00.480]  with the electronic stuff.
[03:02:01.480 --> 03:02:02.480]  That's why he said this is a dream come true.
[03:02:03.480 --> 03:02:04.480]  That's why the former KGB,
[03:02:05.480 --> 03:02:06.480]  now the FSB in Germany,
[03:02:06.480 --> 03:02:08.480]  they're picking up on this too, it's the way to do it.
[03:02:09.480 --> 03:02:10.480]  We are the world leader in evil.
[03:02:11.480 --> 03:02:12.480]  Yes, I mean,
[03:02:13.480 --> 03:02:14.480]  they started the kind of spying
[03:02:15.480 --> 03:02:16.480]  on their own populations,
[03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:18.480]  and now we have adopted that procedure
[03:02:19.480 --> 03:02:20.480]  and gone n degrees further.
[03:02:21.480 --> 03:02:22.480]  Yeah, when I first heard this 15 years ago,
[03:02:23.480 --> 03:02:24.480]  I didn't believe it, but they actually hired
[03:02:25.480 --> 03:02:26.480]  Marcus Wolfe, the former head of the Stasi
[03:02:27.480 --> 03:02:28.480]  as a consultant, and they're setting up
[03:02:29.480 --> 03:02:30.480]  the Humat Homeland Security Infra-Guard
[03:02:31.480 --> 03:02:32.480]  squads, and basically setting up
[03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:34.480]  on-the-ground intelligence as well,
[03:02:34.480 --> 03:02:35.480]  and it's all political.
[03:02:36.480 --> 03:02:37.480]  Man, this country's in trouble.
[03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:39.480]  Yes, we are.
[03:02:40.480 --> 03:02:41.480]  Man, I mean, it's like,
[03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:43.480]  we've got like stage four tyranny cancer.
[03:02:44.480 --> 03:02:45.480]  That's why I called it the greatest threat
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:47.480]  to our democracy since our Civil War.
[03:02:48.480 --> 03:02:49.480]  It is.
[03:02:50.480 --> 03:02:51.480]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:53.480]  John and Georgia, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:02:54.480 --> 03:02:55.480]  Yes, Alex.
[03:02:56.480 --> 03:02:57.480]  What I'd like to ask is,
[03:02:58.480 --> 03:02:59.480]  these programs,
[03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:01.480]  the only way that I can see them being operational
[03:03:01.480 --> 03:03:03.480]  would be using people's taxes.
[03:03:04.480 --> 03:03:05.480]  And why is it that there's someone calling
[03:03:06.480 --> 03:03:08.480]  for a repeal of, is it the 15th Amendment
[03:03:09.480 --> 03:03:10.480]  or the 16th Amendment to try to cut off
[03:03:11.480 --> 03:03:12.480]  the head of the snake, so to speak,
[03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:14.480]  so they can't get the funding?
[03:03:15.480 --> 03:03:16.480]  Sure, when the government's gone rogue,
[03:03:17.480 --> 03:03:18.480]  it does get to the point of saying,
[03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:20.480]  we better not pay our taxes.
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:22.480]  The problem is they'll just issue more bonds
[03:03:23.480 --> 03:03:24.480]  to themselves.
[03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:26.480]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[03:03:27.480 --> 03:03:28.480]  It's reached cuckoo level where they have
[03:03:28.480 --> 03:03:29.480]  to pay their taxes.
[03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:31.480]  I think that's absolutely right.
[03:03:32.480 --> 03:03:33.480]  I mean, they would just take more debt on
[03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:35.480]  and that's put back on the people anyway.
[03:03:36.480 --> 03:03:37.480]  I don't think it can stop in that way.
[03:03:38.480 --> 03:03:39.480]  You have to get laws passed that will,
[03:03:40.480 --> 03:03:41.480]  in Congress, that's supposed to control
[03:03:42.480 --> 03:03:43.480]  the purse to cut the spending.
[03:03:44.480 --> 03:03:45.480]  Sure.
[03:03:46.480 --> 03:03:47.480]  And when it comes to taxes, if you're going bankrupt
[03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:49.480]  because of unerous taxes and you're a hard-working
[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:51.480]  guy and you can't feed yourself,
[03:03:52.480 --> 03:03:53.480]  I mean, I wouldn't pay them.
[03:03:54.480 --> 03:03:55.480]  And I'm not telling you don't pay them,
[03:03:55.480 --> 03:03:57.480]  but I'm telling you, the system is getting so bad
[03:03:58.480 --> 03:03:59.480]  that you can't blame and thank you so much,
[03:04:00.480 --> 03:04:01.480]  Collar, God bless you.
[03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:03.480]  William Benny, what about the issue of having
[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:05.480]  a lawless government?
[03:04:06.480 --> 03:04:07.480]  Won't that encourage everybody else to become lawless?
[03:04:08.480 --> 03:04:09.480]  Well, I know there's, I mean,
[03:04:10.480 --> 03:04:11.480]  I'm hearing from my brother and others in Virginia
[03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:13.480]  where they're thinking, Jesus, this looks like
[03:04:14.480 --> 03:04:15.480]  we need another revolution.
[03:04:16.480 --> 03:04:17.480]  I wouldn't advocate it.
[03:04:18.480 --> 03:04:19.480]  I think we have ways and means of doing it right now,
[03:04:20.480 --> 03:04:21.480]  but it's putting pressure on, I mean,
[03:04:22.480 --> 03:04:23.480]  if we have to, we have to fire everyone
[03:04:23.480 --> 03:04:24.480]  and get rid of them because they're,
[03:04:25.480 --> 03:04:26.480]  I was even recommending a new,
[03:04:27.480 --> 03:04:28.480]  having our article five convention
[03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:30.480]  to set up a new way of electing people.
[03:04:31.480 --> 03:04:32.480]  That's by randomly picking from the phone book.
[03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:34.480]  We certainly can't do any worse than what we've got now.
[03:04:35.480 --> 03:04:38.480]  William Benny, I, this is incredible.
[03:04:39.480 --> 03:04:40.480]  I'm going to talk to you in the break
[03:04:41.480 --> 03:04:42.480]  and see if you want to do this.
[03:04:43.480 --> 03:04:44.480]  I have to go to a meeting.
[03:04:45.480 --> 03:04:46.480]  We're going to get together tonight again.
[03:04:47.480 --> 03:04:48.480]  I would like you, you're very confident person.
[03:04:49.480 --> 03:04:50.480]  You'll hear the musical fade in and fade out.
[03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:52.480]  I've been here and have the floor give a 10 minute speech
[03:04:53.480 --> 03:04:54.480]  and ended that way.
[03:04:55.480 --> 03:04:56.480]  I can say William Benny posted my show.
[03:04:57.480 --> 03:04:58.480]  We're going to come back and do that.
[03:04:59.480 --> 03:05:00.480]  Thank you so much.
[03:05:01.480 --> 03:05:02.480]  Thank you.
[03:05:03.480 --> 03:05:04.480]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years
[03:05:05.480 --> 03:05:06.480]  hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[03:05:07.480 --> 03:05:08.480]  and live out their golden years.
[03:05:09.480 --> 03:05:10.480]  Unfortunately with taxation,
[03:05:11.480 --> 03:05:12.480]  the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical,
[03:05:13.480 --> 03:05:14.480]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:05:15.480 --> 03:05:16.480]  Is this a flaw free enterprise
[03:05:17.480 --> 03:05:18.480]  or is our monetary unit,
[03:05:18.480 --> 03:05:19.480]  forcing us into perpetual debt,
[03:05:20.480 --> 03:05:21.480]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:05:22.480 --> 03:05:23.480]  These questions and more can be answered
[03:05:24.480 --> 03:05:25.480]  by reading G. Edward Griffin's book
[03:05:26.480 --> 03:05:27.480]  The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:05:28.480 --> 03:05:29.480]  Congressman Ron Paul states
[03:05:30.480 --> 03:05:31.480]  it's what every American needs to know
[03:05:32.480 --> 03:05:33.480]  about central bank power.
[03:05:34.480 --> 03:05:35.480]  A gripping adventure into the secret world
[03:05:36.480 --> 03:05:37.480]  of international banking cartel.
[03:05:38.480 --> 03:05:39.480]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:05:40.480 --> 03:05:41.480]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s
[03:05:42.480 --> 03:05:43.480]  to anyone who purchases this book.

[03:05:48.480 --> 03:05:49.480]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[03:05:52.480 --> 03:05:53.480]  at 1-800-686-2237.

[03:06:58.480 --> 03:06:59.480]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough,
[03:07:00.480 --> 03:07:01.480]  now they're adding ammonia?
[03:07:02.480 --> 03:07:03.480]  It's true.
[03:07:04.480 --> 03:07:05.480]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine
[03:07:06.480 --> 03:07:07.480]  to your water supply.
[03:07:08.480 --> 03:07:09.480]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[03:07:10.480 --> 03:07:11.480]  But with a trusted big Berkey water filter,
[03:07:12.480 --> 03:07:13.480]  you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[03:07:14.480 --> 03:07:16.480]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests
[03:07:17.480 --> 03:07:19.480]  show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines,
[03:07:20.480 --> 03:07:21.480]  pharmaceuticals, BPA,
[03:07:21.480 --> 03:07:23.480]  pesticides, bacteria and viruses,
[03:07:24.480 --> 03:07:26.480]  all forms of fluoride and much more.
[03:07:27.480 --> 03:07:28.480]  Big Berkey water filters are the original
[03:07:29.480 --> 03:07:30.480]  and most trusted on the market.
[03:07:31.480 --> 03:07:32.480]  The gold standard in water purification
[03:07:33.480 --> 03:07:34.480]  and our filters last for years
[03:07:35.480 --> 03:07:36.480]  at less than two cents per gallon.
[03:07:37.480 --> 03:07:39.480]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough
[03:07:40.480 --> 03:07:41.480]  to purify stagnant pond water.
[03:07:42.480 --> 03:07:43.480]  Get your Big Berkey today.

[03:07:48.480 --> 03:07:52.480]  That's 1-877-99 BERKEY.
[03:07:53.480 --> 03:07:56.480]  Big Berkey water filters for the love of clean water.
[03:08:00.480 --> 03:08:02.480]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:03.480 --> 03:08:05.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:10.480 --> 03:08:12.480]  This is Bill Finney sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:08:13.480 --> 03:08:15.480]  He's given me a segment here to state my concerns
[03:08:15.480 --> 03:08:17.480]  about to you, the American public,
[03:08:18.480 --> 03:08:19.480]  about what I feel we need to do
[03:08:20.480 --> 03:08:21.480]  in terms of combating
[03:08:22.480 --> 03:08:23.480]  and changing the course that our government's taken.
[03:08:24.480 --> 03:08:28.480]  And from the arguments the government puts forward,
[03:08:29.480 --> 03:08:30.480]  they say they're doing this for security
[03:08:31.480 --> 03:08:32.480]  of the people of the United States
[03:08:33.480 --> 03:08:34.480]  and they're doing it for terrorism,
[03:08:35.480 --> 03:08:36.480]  to try to prevent it,
[03:08:37.480 --> 03:08:38.480]  and you have to give up your privacy
[03:08:39.480 --> 03:08:40.480]  for them to be able to do that
[03:08:41.480 --> 03:08:42.480]  and that's just an outright lie, first of all.
[03:08:42.480 --> 03:08:44.480]  It's really happening by taking in this bulk data.
[03:08:45.480 --> 03:08:47.480]  It's really overburdening their analysts
[03:08:48.480 --> 03:08:49.480]  and NSA, CIA, all of the world.
[03:08:50.480 --> 03:08:53.480]  And so they can't really stop these events of terrorism
[03:08:54.480 --> 03:08:55.480]  like the bombings in Boston
[03:08:56.480 --> 03:08:57.480]  or the shooting in Paris
[03:08:58.480 --> 03:08:59.480]  or in Copenhagen
[03:09:00.480 --> 03:09:01.480]  or the Fort Hood shooter or any of that
[03:09:02.480 --> 03:09:03.480]  because their analysts are so burdened with data
[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:06.480]  they use a dictionary select type approach
[03:09:07.480 --> 03:09:08.480]  which is fundamentally a Google approach.
[03:09:09.480 --> 03:09:10.480]  That means that when they do their daily polls
[03:09:10.480 --> 03:09:11.480]  they use their dictionary select
[03:09:12.480 --> 03:09:13.480]  and they get like a Google return.
[03:09:14.480 --> 03:09:15.480]  Well, that's hundreds of thousands
[03:09:16.480 --> 03:09:17.480]  or even a million returns.
[03:09:18.480 --> 03:09:19.480]  No analyst could make it through all that data
[03:09:20.480 --> 03:09:21.480]  in any day and the next day
[03:09:22.480 --> 03:09:23.480]  they get an equivalent amount.
[03:09:24.480 --> 03:09:25.480]  So that means they're making themselves totally dysfunctional
[03:09:26.480 --> 03:09:27.480]  and that's just not true for NSA.
[03:09:28.480 --> 03:09:29.480]  That's also true in GCHQ and around the world
[03:09:30.480 --> 03:09:31.480]  because all these governments are adopting
[03:09:32.480 --> 03:09:34.480]  the same procedures instead of taking a focused approach
[03:09:35.480 --> 03:09:36.480]  which would make a rich environment of content
[03:09:37.480 --> 03:09:38.480]  to be able to manage and analyze.
[03:09:38.480 --> 03:09:39.480]  So that would make them successful.
[03:09:40.480 --> 03:09:41.480]  So fundamentally they're exposing people
[03:09:42.480 --> 03:09:43.480]  to more risk.
[03:09:44.480 --> 03:09:45.480]  They're not actually protecting you.
[03:09:46.480 --> 03:09:47.480]  They're making it more risky for you.
[03:09:49.480 --> 03:09:50.480]  You're losing security because of this procedure
[03:09:51.480 --> 03:09:52.480]  they've adopted.
[03:09:53.480 --> 03:09:54.480]  So the point is from my perspective
[03:09:55.480 --> 03:09:56.480]  I keep arguing and other NSA whistleblowers
[03:09:57.480 --> 03:09:58.480]  and I have made suggestions
[03:09:59.480 --> 03:10:00.480]  on how to do this to the government
[03:10:01.480 --> 03:10:02.480]  but the president has not adopted those techniques
[03:10:03.480 --> 03:10:04.480]  and nor have I made any suggestions
[03:10:05.480 --> 03:10:06.480]  about how to do this to the government
[03:10:06.480 --> 03:10:07.480]  and has not adopted those techniques
[03:10:08.480 --> 03:10:09.480]  and nor have any of the intelligence agencies
[03:10:10.480 --> 03:10:12.480]  simply because there is too much money
[03:10:13.480 --> 03:10:14.480]  in this process of doing bulk acquisition of data.
[03:10:15.480 --> 03:10:16.480]  That's their motive
[03:10:17.480 --> 03:10:18.480]  to keep having the money flow
[03:10:19.480 --> 03:10:20.480]  and keep that going.
[03:10:21.480 --> 03:10:25.480]  So changing that particular procedure
[03:10:26.480 --> 03:10:27.480]  is rather difficult even within government
[03:10:28.480 --> 03:10:29.480]  because this money comes out
[03:10:30.480 --> 03:10:31.480]  and goes to corporations
[03:10:32.480 --> 03:10:33.480]  that are in the constituent areas
[03:10:33.480 --> 03:10:35.480]  and the representatives and senators.
[03:10:36.480 --> 03:10:37.480]  So they have a vested interest
[03:10:38.480 --> 03:10:39.480]  in also keeping this going.
[03:10:40.480 --> 03:10:41.480]  So the only way to do it is to raise up as a public.
[03:10:42.480 --> 03:10:43.480]  We have to start standing up as Americans.
[03:10:44.480 --> 03:10:45.480]  Americans aren't supposed to sit back
[03:10:46.480 --> 03:10:47.480]  and let things happen and let government do
[03:10:48.480 --> 03:10:49.480]  what it does.
[03:10:50.480 --> 03:10:51.480]  We're supposed to be out there challenging.
[03:10:52.480 --> 03:10:53.480]  We have to be participating in our democracy
[03:10:54.480 --> 03:10:55.480]  and republic.
[03:10:56.480 --> 03:10:57.480]  We cannot sit by and let these things happen
[03:10:58.480 --> 03:10:59.480]  and be quiet.
[03:11:00.480 --> 03:11:01.480]  If we do we're going to get this totalitarian state
[03:11:01.480 --> 03:11:02.480]  toward right now.
[03:11:03.480 --> 03:11:04.480]  So that's really the basic issue
[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:06.480]  that I have to convey to you
[03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:08.480]  that you need to stand up.
[03:11:09.480 --> 03:11:10.480]  How could you do that?
[03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:12.480]  You can't sit there and say you don't have any power.
[03:11:13.480 --> 03:11:14.480]  You really do have power
[03:11:15.480 --> 03:11:17.480]  and the power is to talk to your representatives
[03:11:19.480 --> 03:11:20.480]  and senators and complain to them
[03:11:21.480 --> 03:11:22.480]  and make sure that this is a major concern to you.
[03:11:24.480 --> 03:11:25.480]  And when they come around to give you town meetings
[03:11:27.480 --> 03:11:28.480]  and talk to you and get your vote
[03:11:28.480 --> 03:11:30.480]  stand up and address them
[03:11:31.480 --> 03:11:32.480]  and make them publicly come out
[03:11:33.480 --> 03:11:34.480]  with a statement of their position on this issue.
[03:11:35.480 --> 03:11:36.480]  If you don't,
[03:11:37.480 --> 03:11:38.480]  I mean they're going to continue doing what
[03:11:39.480 --> 03:11:40.480]  they are doing right now.
[03:11:41.480 --> 03:11:42.480]  They simply say they're assuming
[03:11:43.480 --> 03:11:44.480]  because now if you're not complaining
[03:11:45.480 --> 03:11:46.480]  they're assuming that you're okay
[03:11:47.480 --> 03:11:48.480]  with everything they do
[03:11:49.480 --> 03:11:50.480]  or they feel they can do anything
[03:11:51.480 --> 03:11:52.480]  and the country will accept it
[03:11:53.480 --> 03:11:54.480]  and as long as they keep saying things
[03:11:55.480 --> 03:11:56.480]  and not telling the truth
[03:11:56.480 --> 03:11:57.480]  and exposing what's really going on
[03:11:58.480 --> 03:11:59.480]  they can keep you in the dark
[03:12:00.480 --> 03:12:01.480]  and you'll never know.
[03:12:02.480 --> 03:12:03.480]  So that's why you have to get up, stand up,
[03:12:04.480 --> 03:12:05.480]  challenge them.
[03:12:06.480 --> 03:12:07.480]  I mean after all they're even addressing
[03:12:08.480 --> 03:12:09.480]  the free press we're supposed to have
[03:12:10.480 --> 03:12:11.480]  like with Jim Risen and Jim Rosen
[03:12:12.480 --> 03:12:13.480]  the AP and various other
[03:12:14.480 --> 03:12:15.480]  investigative journals.
[03:12:16.480 --> 03:12:17.480]  They're shutting down their sources
[03:12:18.480 --> 03:12:19.480]  and information and keeping them quiet.
[03:12:20.480 --> 03:12:21.480]  Well that's destroying a free press
[03:12:22.480 --> 03:12:23.480]  so that free press is supposed to be interrogating
[03:12:23.480 --> 03:12:25.480]  the government to see what they're doing
[03:12:26.480 --> 03:12:27.480]  so they can inform the public
[03:12:28.480 --> 03:12:29.480]  what the government is after
[03:12:30.480 --> 03:12:31.480]  and what they're really doing.
[03:12:32.480 --> 03:12:33.480]  Well that's falling totally apart.
[03:12:34.480 --> 03:12:35.480]  I mean look at Jim Rosen in his case
[03:12:36.480 --> 03:12:37.480]  they had him under subpoena
[03:12:38.480 --> 03:12:39.480]  for any number of years
[03:12:40.480 --> 03:12:41.480]  trying to get him to tell the source
[03:12:42.480 --> 03:12:43.480]  of the information in the books
[03:12:44.480 --> 03:12:45.480]  and things he's published.
[03:12:46.480 --> 03:12:47.480]  Well under the press rules
[03:12:48.480 --> 03:12:49.480]  he had the right to keep the sources
[03:12:50.480 --> 03:12:51.480]  confidential.
[03:12:51.480 --> 03:12:52.480]  He had the right to step in going
[03:12:53.480 --> 03:12:54.480]  to a totalitarian state.
[03:12:55.480 --> 03:12:56.480]  So if we don't stand up Americans
[03:12:57.480 --> 03:12:58.480]  we're going to lose our country
[03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:00.480]  we're going to lose the process that we
[03:13:01.480 --> 03:13:02.480]  hold dear that at least the Republic
[03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:04.480]  I've had when I grew up
[03:13:05.480 --> 03:13:06.480]  and that my father and his father
[03:13:07.480 --> 03:13:08.480]  before him had.
[03:13:09.480 --> 03:13:10.480]  I mean we're going to lose it
[03:13:11.480 --> 03:13:12.480]  because we can't trust the government
[03:13:13.480 --> 03:13:14.480]  and what they're saying.
[03:13:15.480 --> 03:13:16.480]  They in fact have been deliberately
[03:13:17.480 --> 03:13:18.480]  keeping us in the dark as to what's going
[03:13:18.480 --> 03:13:20.480]  on in the dark.
[03:13:21.480 --> 03:13:22.480]  So by doing this complaining to
[03:13:23.480 --> 03:13:24.480]  the Congress you have at least
[03:13:25.480 --> 03:13:26.480]  an opportunity to change the process
[03:13:27.480 --> 03:13:28.480]  and the sequence of things and where
[03:13:29.480 --> 03:13:30.480]  it's headed.
[03:13:31.480 --> 03:13:32.480]  A short of that I mean
[03:13:33.480 --> 03:13:34.480]  you have to fire everybody in Congress
[03:13:35.480 --> 03:13:36.480]  that's the only way to get rid of
[03:13:37.480 --> 03:13:38.480]  you have to get rid of the bombs
[03:13:39.480 --> 03:13:40.480]  because they're not living up to
[03:13:41.480 --> 03:13:42.480]  their oath of office which is to
[03:13:43.480 --> 03:13:44.480]  protect and defend the Constitution.
[03:13:45.480 --> 03:13:46.480]  The President of course has the
[03:13:46.480 --> 03:13:47.480]  responsibility under his oath of
[03:13:48.480 --> 03:13:49.480]  office to preserve the Constitution
[03:13:50.480 --> 03:13:51.480]  as to preserve, protect and defend
[03:13:52.480 --> 03:13:53.480]  the others like when I was in
[03:13:54.480 --> 03:13:55.480]  government I had to protect and
[03:13:56.480 --> 03:13:57.480]  defend the Constitution that's why
[03:13:58.480 --> 03:13:59.480]  I felt that what I was doing was
[03:14:00.480 --> 03:14:01.480]  consistent with my oath of office
[03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:03.480]  also consistent with being a
[03:14:04.480 --> 03:14:05.480]  citizen of the United States of
[03:14:06.480 --> 03:14:07.480]  actively getting and participating
[03:14:08.480 --> 03:14:09.480]  in this democracy that we have is
[03:14:10.480 --> 03:14:11.480]  getting up there and standing up
[03:14:12.480 --> 03:14:13.480]  and defending that Constitution
[03:14:13.480 --> 03:14:15.480]  that's something that our representatives
[03:14:16.480 --> 03:14:17.480]  in Washington are not doing and
[03:14:18.480 --> 03:14:19.480]  that's something we have to call them
[03:14:20.480 --> 03:14:21.480]  on we have to make sure as the
[03:14:22.480 --> 03:14:23.480]  citizens that we stand up and say
[03:14:24.480 --> 03:14:25.480]  look you're in office and we voted
[03:14:26.480 --> 03:14:27.480]  you there and your oath of office is
[03:14:28.480 --> 03:14:29.480]  to do this to protect our rights
[03:14:30.480 --> 03:14:31.480]  and you're not doing that and
[03:14:32.480 --> 03:14:33.480]  put them on the spot publicly
[03:14:34.480 --> 03:14:35.480]  this is the only way to do it
[03:14:36.480 --> 03:14:37.480]  sunlight is the only cure and
[03:14:38.480 --> 03:14:39.480]  that's why Edward Snowden has
[03:14:40.480 --> 03:14:41.480]  really been has really performed
[03:14:41.480 --> 03:14:44.480]  a huge public service by exposing
[03:14:45.480 --> 03:14:47.480]  these programs that have been
[03:14:48.480 --> 03:14:50.480]  in place and put in place since 9-11
[03:14:51.480 --> 03:14:52.480]  to spy on everybody in the United
[03:14:53.480 --> 03:14:54.480]  States and accumulate information
[03:14:55.480 --> 03:14:56.480]  on everybody. It's one thing for
[03:14:57.480 --> 03:14:59.480]  companies to do it which I also
[03:15:00.480 --> 03:15:01.480]  disagree with they shouldn't be
[03:15:02.480 --> 03:15:03.480]  allowed to do that but if they're
[03:15:04.480 --> 03:15:05.480]  doing it for the purpose of
[03:15:06.480 --> 03:15:07.480]  advertising and making money the
[03:15:08.480 --> 03:15:09.480]  government's doing it for the
[03:15:09.480 --> 03:15:10.480]  national activity and also being
[03:15:11.480 --> 03:15:12.480]  able to control the population
[03:15:13.480 --> 03:15:14.480]  that's really what's happening
[03:15:15.480 --> 03:15:16.480]  I mean you could see it in the
[03:15:17.480 --> 03:15:18.480]  militarization of your local police
[03:15:19.480 --> 03:15:21.480]  and the spread of the Department
[03:15:22.480 --> 03:15:23.480]  of Homeland Security and their
[03:15:24.480 --> 03:15:25.480]  equipment worldwide and the buying
[03:15:26.480 --> 03:15:27.480]  of the bullets and so on they're
[03:15:28.480 --> 03:15:29.480]  all leading to the state of
[03:15:30.480 --> 03:15:31.480]  basically being able to control
[03:15:32.480 --> 03:15:33.480]  the population and that's
[03:15:34.480 --> 03:15:35.480]  fundamentally what I've been
[03:15:36.480 --> 03:15:37.480]  that's what I testified to in
[03:15:37.480 --> 03:15:38.480]  Germany when I gave testimony to
[03:15:39.480 --> 03:15:40.480]  the Bundestag that the entire
[03:15:41.480 --> 03:15:42.480]  process that it was adopted by
[03:15:43.480 --> 03:15:44.480]  NSA and has been spread around
[03:15:45.480 --> 03:15:46.480]  the world through all the
[03:15:47.480 --> 03:15:48.480]  intelligence agencies is one of
[03:15:49.480 --> 03:15:50.480]  controlling and assembling
[03:15:51.480 --> 03:15:52.480]  information to be able to control
[03:15:53.480 --> 03:15:54.480]  the population not just in the
[03:15:55.480 --> 03:15:56.480]  United States but around the
[03:15:57.480 --> 03:15:58.480]  world. So this is not just
[03:15:59.480 --> 03:16:00.480]  threatening us in our democracy
[03:16:01.480 --> 03:16:02.480]  it's a world where we're destroying
[03:16:03.480 --> 03:16:04.480]  democracy around the world and in
[03:16:04.480 --> 03:16:06.480]  Russia and others what we used to
[03:16:06.480 --> 03:16:07.480]  call totalitarian states are now
[03:16:08.480 --> 03:16:09.480]  adopting the procedures that we've
[03:16:10.480 --> 03:16:11.480]  implemented and this basically
[03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:13.480]  tells you that we're on the wrong
[03:16:14.480 --> 03:16:15.480]  path our government since Dick
[03:16:16.480 --> 03:16:18.480]  Cheney said publicly on
[03:16:19.480 --> 03:16:20.480]  television that we had to go to the
[03:16:21.480 --> 03:16:22.480]  dark side well that meant we went
[03:16:23.480 --> 03:16:24.480]  to the dark side for rendering
[03:16:25.480 --> 03:16:27.480]  torture, murder, drone strikes
[03:16:28.480 --> 03:16:30.480]  spying on everybody all of this
[03:16:31.480 --> 03:16:32.480]  is the dark side well that's
[03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:34.480]  that's not that's not American
[03:16:35.480 --> 03:16:36.480]  and that's certainly not consistent
[03:16:37.480 --> 03:16:38.480]  with the founding principles of
[03:16:39.480 --> 03:16:40.480]  this government. We were founded
[03:16:41.480 --> 03:16:42.480]  on the principles of human rights
[03:16:43.480 --> 03:16:45.480]  and what these about the processes
[03:16:46.480 --> 03:16:47.480]  that are putting in place now are
[03:16:48.480 --> 03:16:49.480]  in fact taking those rights away.
[03:16:50.480 --> 03:16:51.480]  So the only way we can change this
[03:16:52.480 --> 03:16:53.480]  is to stand up we have to get active
[03:16:54.480 --> 03:16:56.480]  say something I don't care what it
[03:16:57.480 --> 03:16:58.480]  is you say or how you say it but
[03:16:59.480 --> 03:17:00.480]  get up and participate in this
[03:17:00.480 --> 03:17:02.480]  if you oppose this move towards
[03:17:03.480 --> 03:17:04.480]  totalitarianism you need to speak up
[03:17:05.480 --> 03:17:06.480]  and say something you can't be quiet
[03:17:07.480 --> 03:17:08.480]  you have to get out there and
[03:17:09.480 --> 03:17:10.480]  participate and that's that's really
[03:17:11.480 --> 03:17:12.480]  the theme of what what I what I
[03:17:13.480 --> 03:17:14.480]  would like to say to everybody in
[03:17:15.480 --> 03:17:16.480]  America and that's what that's
[03:17:17.480 --> 03:17:18.480]  the only way now to do it is to
[03:17:19.480 --> 03:17:20.480]  to do to address your representatives
[03:17:21.480 --> 03:17:22.480]  and senators and make sure that
[03:17:23.480 --> 03:17:24.480]  you push that on them and keep
[03:17:25.480 --> 03:17:26.480]  keep pushing that if they don't
[03:17:27.480 --> 03:17:28.480]  start saying them just tell them
[03:17:28.480 --> 03:17:29.480]  you're going to fire them by
[03:17:30.480 --> 03:17:31.480]  voting against them the next time
[03:17:32.480 --> 03:17:33.480]  that will get their attention
[03:17:34.480 --> 03:17:35.480]  because that's really what they
[03:17:36.480 --> 03:17:37.480]  want to do they want to stay in
[03:17:38.480 --> 03:17:39.480]  Congress and be and be there for
[03:17:40.480 --> 03:17:41.480]  years and that's part of our
[03:17:42.480 --> 03:17:43.480]  problem we don't have term limits
[03:17:44.480 --> 03:17:45.480]  so we end up with what I call
[03:17:46.480 --> 03:17:47.480]  petrified politicians in place
[03:17:48.480 --> 03:17:49.480]  Washington they they've been
[03:17:50.480 --> 03:17:51.480]  there for so long that it's it's
[03:17:52.480 --> 03:17:53.480]  never ending career for them.
[03:17:54.480 --> 03:17:55.480]  Well when you do that with
[03:17:55.480 --> 03:17:57.480]  they know better than anybody else
[03:17:58.480 --> 03:17:59.480]  and that they don't have they
[03:18:00.480 --> 03:18:01.480]  don't they believe that they can
[03:18:02.480 --> 03:18:03.480]  make the decisions that are right
[03:18:04.480 --> 03:18:05.480]  for the country whether or not
[03:18:06.480 --> 03:18:07.480]  the public in in in the United
[03:18:08.480 --> 03:18:09.480]  States would agree or not or even
[03:18:10.480 --> 03:18:11.480]  if they disagree that doesn't
[03:18:12.480 --> 03:18:13.480]  matter if their opinion says let's
[03:18:14.480 --> 03:18:15.480]  go another way then that's what
[03:18:16.480 --> 03:18:17.480]  they do so that that's where we
[03:18:18.480 --> 03:18:19.480]  have to stand up as a group and
[03:18:20.480 --> 03:18:21.480]  you have to do this as a group
[03:18:22.480 --> 03:18:23.480]  and make sure that that the wave
[03:18:23.480 --> 03:18:24.480]  opinion hits them in a place that
[03:18:25.480 --> 03:18:26.480]  it hurts them and that's at the
[03:18:27.480 --> 03:18:28.480]  voting vote if you vote against
[03:18:29.480 --> 03:18:30.480]  them and fire them they'll get
[03:18:31.480 --> 03:18:32.480]  that will get their attention
[03:18:33.480 --> 03:18:34.480]  that's the big thing that I would
[03:18:35.480 --> 03:18:36.480]  say fire the bombs get rid of
[03:18:37.480 --> 03:18:38.480]  them and I would say if the if
[03:18:39.480 --> 03:18:40.480]  there's a if there's an incumbent
[03:18:41.480 --> 03:18:42.480]  list if there's a word incumbent
[03:18:43.480 --> 03:18:44.480]  after somebody you're in the
[03:18:45.480 --> 03:18:46.480]  voting booth I would say more than
[03:18:47.480 --> 03:18:48.480]  likely is better to vote against
[03:18:49.480 --> 03:18:50.480]  them like I said earlier the
[03:18:50.480 --> 03:18:52.480]  way I would see to do it is to
[03:18:53.480 --> 03:18:54.480]  randomly select people from the
[03:18:55.480 --> 03:18:56.480]  phone book as and and give them
[03:18:57.480 --> 03:18:58.480]  every two years a chance to get
[03:18:59.480 --> 03:19:00.480]  into into office that way
[03:19:01.480 --> 03:19:02.480]  think about that for a minute
[03:19:03.480 --> 03:19:04.480]  that would mean you get mostly
[03:19:05.480 --> 03:19:06.480]  people who would want to be
[03:19:07.480 --> 03:19:08.480]  honest that's certainly a change
[03:19:09.480 --> 03:19:10.480]  from what we've got and you get
[03:19:11.480 --> 03:19:12.480]  the people who would like to be
[03:19:13.480 --> 03:19:14.480]  who would like to balance a
[03:19:15.480 --> 03:19:16.480]  budget that's certainly new I
[03:19:17.480 --> 03:19:18.480]  mean we're going to reduce the
[03:19:18.480 --> 03:19:19.480]  people who would like to
[03:19:20.480 --> 03:19:21.480]  cooperate to solve a problem
[03:19:22.480 --> 03:19:23.480]  that certainly is new too so and
[03:19:24.480 --> 03:19:25.480]  the other benefits think about
[03:19:26.480 --> 03:19:27.480]  the political parties would be
[03:19:28.480 --> 03:19:29.480]  gone you wouldn't have to you
[03:19:30.480 --> 03:19:31.480]  wouldn't have to do you wouldn't
[03:19:32.480 --> 03:19:34.480]  have to do campaigns or any of
[03:19:35.480 --> 03:19:36.480]  that you wouldn't have all this
[03:19:37.480 --> 03:19:38.480]  vested interest in lobbyist going
[03:19:39.480 --> 03:19:40.480]  on so you you you could end you
[03:19:41.480 --> 03:19:42.480]  could end up getting all these
[03:19:43.480 --> 03:19:44.480]  positive effects by randomly
[03:19:45.480 --> 03:19:46.480]  selecting from the phone book
[03:19:46.480 --> 03:19:47.480]  from us that we're saying
[03:19:48.480 --> 03:19:49.480]  that's a better way to do it
[03:19:50.480 --> 03:19:51.480]  than what we've got now
[03:19:53.480 --> 03:19:54.480]  so thank you very much for your
[03:19:54.480 --> 03:20:15.480]  time and listening.
