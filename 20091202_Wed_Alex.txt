[00:22.600 --> 00:27.640]  and gentlemen welcome I am Jason Burmese sitting in for Alex Jones Alex Jones on assignment
[00:27.640 --> 00:36.320]  in Dallas it is Wednesday December 2 2009 2009 almost on its way out folks flying by
[00:36.320 --> 00:41.840]  we have a power packed show three guests today big guess we've got Catherine Austin
[00:41.840 --> 00:49.400]  fits on in the final hour we're going to be talking about the entire economic meltdown
[00:49.400 --> 00:53.840]  worldwide worldwide Dubai going under hedges against the dollar she's going to break it
[00:53.840 --> 00:58.180]  down for us in the final hour in the second hour we're going to have Gary Lackman who
[00:58.180 --> 01:03.440]  wrote the book politics and the occult that should be an exciting one for anybody who
[01:03.440 --> 01:09.120]  follows kind of what the religion is of the elite and why do we have all this symbology
[01:09.120 --> 01:12.400]  many of them pose as Christian conservatives but are they really so we're going to get
[01:12.400 --> 01:19.120]  deep into that as well and former Navy SEAL Jim O'Neill has written an article it's up
[01:19.120 --> 01:24.600]  on info wars dot com all about climate heat the latest news on climate heat Penn State
[01:24.600 --> 01:31.240]  is investigating people are stepping down in Australia they could not pass their new
[01:31.240 --> 01:36.560]  omissions trading standard that went under the fraud is being exposed and perhaps the
[01:36.560 --> 01:43.120]  biggest story arming Goldman with pistols against public Alice Schroeder that's right
[01:43.120 --> 01:47.800]  Goldman Sachs is so worried about some kind of an insurrection or somebody stepping up
[01:47.800 --> 01:53.360]  to the plate and doing something that I don't encourage but they're so worried about people
[01:53.360 --> 01:58.120]  stepping in that they're now arming their employees do you understand why the bankers
[01:58.120 --> 02:03.360]  have been trying to take away our gun rights say the second amendment just doesn't exist
[02:03.360 --> 02:07.160]  put limitations on what you're allowed to have because they're blowing out the economy
[02:07.160 --> 02:12.120]  and they know the masses will not stand for it Alex is also going to be calling in from
[02:12.120 --> 02:17.160]  Dallas on assignment maybe he'll let you in on what he's doing very exciting stuff let
[02:17.160 --> 02:22.680]  me just read this I just wrote my first reference for a gun permit this is at a Bloomberg by
[02:22.680 --> 02:27.400]  the way said a friend who told me of swearing to the good character of a Goldman Sachs
[02:27.400 --> 02:34.120]  group incorporated banker who applied to local police for a permit to buy a pistol see they
[02:34.120 --> 02:39.480]  know that the dollar doesn't have long they know that they've stolen publicly now according
[02:39.480 --> 02:44.600]  to the same publication almost 30 trillion dollars and that was months ago it's probably
[02:44.600 --> 02:51.000]  well past that the official number I believe was 27 trillion dollars let that sink in yet
[02:51.000 --> 02:58.920]  we are at record unemployment all over Detroit looks like a war zone we do you see the footage
[02:58.920 --> 03:04.000]  that our guys got there it's unbelievable it worked it looks worse than Katrina then
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.560]  New Orleans and that's coming all around the country as the dollar becomes destitute and
[03:10.560 --> 03:16.080]  gold hits a new high yet again it doesn't seem like there's going to be a roof on this thing
[03:16.080 --> 03:22.000]  it could hit 1500 folks again when I when I was listening to Alex Jones back in 2003 you
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.880]  could get an ounce of gold for under 300 dollars and people were telling me then oh it's a scam
[03:27.840 --> 03:33.520]  gold will never go up oh no it's all only tripled plus in value tell me one other investment out
[03:33.520 --> 03:39.200]  there one other honest investment that's done the same and there isn't one and hard currency
[03:39.200 --> 03:43.200]  like gold and silver is what you need to be into as the dollar declines even further
[03:44.400 --> 03:50.160]  they say all over the place they're bailing out Dubai and guess what the war gets escalated in
[03:50.160 --> 03:55.760]  the Middle East we've been talking about a redistribution of forces since the inception
[03:55.760 --> 04:01.040]  of the Obama administration it doesn't matter that it comes out in the New York Times that
[04:01.040 --> 04:06.320]  Karzai's brother has been on a CIA payroll for the last eight years under two separate administrations
[04:06.320 --> 04:10.320]  even though they're one of the same remember Robert Gates just comes in at the end of the
[04:10.320 --> 04:15.280]  Bush administration and stays over for the Obama administration this is a guy who was heavily
[04:15.280 --> 04:21.280]  embroiled in the Iran-Contra scandal and then it comes out for eight years this CIA has been paying
[04:21.280 --> 04:30.240]  Karzai's brother who is a warlord who runs opium who runs opium and then I have to sit there
[04:30.240 --> 04:37.520]  and watch our president our talking puppet up in front of West Point say that we're not an
[04:37.520 --> 04:42.400]  imperialist nation and we've never tried for world domination and we would never go into another
[04:42.400 --> 04:48.960]  nation to take its resources as we do it as he escalates the war with his false left cover
[04:48.960 --> 04:53.200]  we'll be back after this it's the Alex Jones show I am Jason Burma sitting at info wars.com

[06:04.240 --> 06:09.440]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[06:09.440 --> 06:14.320]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[06:14.320 --> 06:19.920]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[06:19.920 --> 06:24.960]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[06:24.960 --> 06:30.080]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[06:30.080 --> 06:34.240]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[06:34.240 --> 06:38.960]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[06:38.960 --> 06:43.360]  insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[08:08.880 --> 08:13.520]  we are back it's the alex joneshow i am jason bermas sitting in alex on assignment in dallas
[08:13.520 --> 08:18.720]  he'll be joining us later on in the program three power packed guests former navy seal
[08:18.720 --> 08:23.600]  jim o'neill coming up at the top of the next hour gary lackman actually the founding
[08:23.600 --> 08:30.160]  a founding member and guitar player for blondie author of politics and the occult and of course
[08:30.160 --> 08:34.480]  kathryn austin fits a lot of people have been emailing and calling in trying to get her on
[08:34.480 --> 08:40.320]  talk about the financial meltdown that is happening right now but i want to go to a story
[08:40.320 --> 08:46.960]  that really is a nexus point for that as the economy collapses as they have to show their true
[08:46.960 --> 08:51.760]  cards because it doesn't matter that all these climate gate emails come out guess what went
[08:51.760 --> 08:56.480]  up 2 percent the carbon trading market that supposedly doesn't exist or is just here to
[08:56.480 --> 09:00.880]  protect us it's not here to bring us world government but then kevin rudd who's the prime
[09:00.880 --> 09:06.880]  minister over in australia clearly said it is about world government we need world government
[09:06.880 --> 09:12.800]  in order to combat climate change yet we had another great victory for humanity yesterday
[09:12.800 --> 09:18.960]  when the ets the emissions trading standard did not pass let me say it again did not pass
[09:18.960 --> 09:23.600]  pass so the bankers feel like well if we blow out this economy anymore if we take away any
[09:23.600 --> 09:28.400]  more jobs i mean the real unemployment as bob chatman and others will tell you people like
[09:28.400 --> 09:35.840]  webster tarpley is almost 20 percent almost 20 percent in the late great united states of america
[09:36.800 --> 09:42.000]  so now the goldman sacks bankers are getting a little bit worried and they are applying
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.720]  for pistol permits while they tell the public that guns are dangerous and we should just hand
[09:46.720 --> 09:51.920]  them over let's be a society like a malice china after all we celebrate it in this country now
[09:52.480 --> 09:57.520]  china's our new best buddy it's a joke on saturday night live when obama goes over there
[09:57.520 --> 10:04.640]  and we owe them trillions and we have to work with them meanwhile as the dollar gets blown out
[10:04.640 --> 10:10.240]  they slowly but surely boost up the special drawing rights unit which is the real global
[10:10.240 --> 10:18.480]  currency which is the real international monetary fund scam out there as it just soaked up the sec
[10:18.480 --> 10:23.760]  and the federal reserve they announce it to you at these g20 meetings and you're sucking your thumb
[10:23.760 --> 10:27.040]  you don't even understand what's going on most people will tell me there isn't even a global
[10:27.040 --> 10:32.240]  currency it doesn't matter if the following g8 that they show you a model and by they i'm talking
[10:32.240 --> 10:38.480]  about the prime minister of russia medved shows you a model for this global currency in a hard form
[10:38.480 --> 10:43.200]  so the bankers are starting to get a little worried in this country because seriously folks we've
[10:43.200 --> 10:47.920]  had it too good for too long everybody asked me why haven't we stood up why aren't there people in
[10:47.920 --> 10:51.760]  the streets well number one the elite are smart and they play us off against each other they give
[10:51.760 --> 10:57.200]  you that false left right paradigm they make it look like a clown like glenn beck is telling you
[10:57.200 --> 11:02.000]  the truth you realize i watched a show the other day i was in the coffee room do you realize the
[11:02.000 --> 11:09.040]  man is talking to an entire nation of adults like children why else would he stand up in front of a
[11:09.040 --> 11:13.760]  chalkboard he's talking to you like you're eight and you're listening people are being suckered
[11:13.760 --> 11:18.800]  in by this guy and unfortunately he is probably telling a little bit more of the truth and the
[11:18.800 --> 11:22.640]  rest of the mainstream media but then he distorts it like he's going to be a savior and tells you
[11:22.640 --> 11:27.840]  that fema camps don't exist don't really worry about these myac reports let's not mention 9 11
[11:27.840 --> 11:33.840]  truth except in the excerpt that they will help al-qaeda to bring down america all this disinformation
[11:33.840 --> 11:41.520]  flowing at you and now bankers are being encouraged to pack heat to pack pistols because they don't
[11:41.520 --> 11:46.480]  know when somebody's going to go over the edge after they lost their house their wife their car
[11:47.440 --> 11:53.840]  to these banksters that again have openly stolen openly stolen over 27 trillion dollars let that
[11:53.840 --> 12:01.120]  roll through your mind for a moment 27 trillion it's not even a real number at this point to most
[12:01.120 --> 12:05.360]  people people just nod their head they're like don't worry the economy's coming obama tells me
[12:05.360 --> 12:10.800]  everything's okay it doesn't matter if they're talking about a war tax that's the newest big
[12:10.800 --> 12:15.920]  hilarity out there they're going to keep taxing you and now they said we're just going to tax the
[12:15.920 --> 12:21.280]  rich for the war you know because the rich are the ones that pay the taxes in this country laugh
[12:21.280 --> 12:28.320]  out loud no if we tax the rich that will give the rich another excuse to raise prices on us and
[12:28.320 --> 12:33.520]  giving us yet another invisible tax besides the inflation we already have besides the gutting of
[12:33.520 --> 12:41.360]  the dollar and again folks record highs for gold yet again today so let me read some more of this
[12:41.360 --> 12:47.920]  i called goldman specs uh a golden sacks spokeswoman uh or i'm sorry spokesperson lucas van prog to
[12:47.920 --> 12:52.800]  ask whether it's true that golden partners feel they need handguns to protect themselves from the
[12:52.800 --> 12:58.000]  angry angry proletariat he didn't call me back the new york police department has told me that
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.760]  is a preliminary matter it believes some of the bankers i inquired about do have pistol permits
[13:03.760 --> 13:09.040]  oh you know how hard it is by the way in new york to get a pistol permit i can't tell you how
[13:09.040 --> 13:16.800]  difficult it is okay my buddy went over to iraq he went over to iraq he served i believe two tours
[13:16.800 --> 13:21.840]  over in iraq as a national guardsman okay he was a national guardsman before that he tried to get
[13:21.840 --> 13:28.000]  his carry and conceal pistol permit in new york state they didn't give it to him do you know how
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.240]  difficult it is to get a carry pistol you basically have to be in law enforcement at the time or you
[13:34.240 --> 13:40.400]  have to be i mean some kind of a super military guy you need all sorts of people to be calling the
[13:40.400 --> 13:45.040]  police department saying yes he's a good person you need a judge you need some insiders well that's
[13:45.040 --> 13:51.440]  what bankers have they are truly the puppeteers so now they can arm themselves in new york but they
[13:51.440 --> 13:57.200]  tell everybody else in new york that guns are bad they make them look illegal on tv they do
[13:57.200 --> 14:02.400]  knock in talks oh how you doing we're just checking to make sure that everybody's guns are legal
[14:02.400 --> 14:07.200]  mind if we come in they've been doing it for years and years and years and years
[14:07.200 --> 14:15.600]  and now the bankers need pistols while we wait goldman has wrapped itself in the flag of war
[14:15.600 --> 14:20.240]  and buffet with whom it jointly donate 500 million see they actually pose them as like the savers
[14:20.240 --> 14:27.040]  oh without goldman sex the sun won't shine we wouldn't have jobs they're too big to fail
[14:28.560 --> 14:35.040]  since when are these large institutions in a true capitalist system and it's never been
[14:35.040 --> 14:39.600]  a true capitalist system too big to fail no they should go under they should be prosecuted
[14:39.600 --> 14:47.040]  for their crimes they want to convert this market into a carbon trading system and that's why they
[14:47.040 --> 14:53.760]  keep pushing forward that's why the white house press secretary robert gibbs said about climate
[14:53.760 --> 14:59.440]  change and climate gait that it doesn't matter because most people still believe in global warming
[14:59.440 --> 15:05.680]  it doesn't matter that right in front of me right in front of me client a climate scientist at
[15:05.680 --> 15:10.080]  center of email controversy to step down this is washington post and this is the guy we've
[15:10.080 --> 15:15.040]  been telling you about phil jones the guy who was blatantly caught manipulating information
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.320]  if you listen to the weekend programs you know they actually dumped the raw data they threw it
[15:20.320 --> 15:26.800]  away why would you throw away the raw climate data if it proved your point if it proved your point
[15:26.800 --> 15:32.720]  your point beyond a reasonable doubt of course you would not throw away the data and dump it
[15:33.680 --> 15:38.800]  so now this guy right here phil jones is stepping down and by the way we're going to get to the
[15:38.800 --> 15:44.880]  story about enhoff as asking barba boxer to uh investigate possible scientific conspiracy
[15:44.880 --> 15:51.200]  in climate gait of course it's a conspiracy listen to lord christopher montan if you
[15:51.200 --> 15:54.640]  missed that interview with alex jones you really need to hear that that happened last friday he
[15:54.640 --> 15:59.360]  laid it out he laid it out they were trying to bring in global government by stealth alex
[16:00.720 --> 16:09.280]  and we get up here and we read the document the copenhagen treaty it's the second six days from
[16:09.280 --> 16:14.160]  now i believe it's either six or seven days from now they are going to get together in copenhagen
[16:14.160 --> 16:20.240]  and start this conference as though climate gait doesn't even exist as if these emails don't prove
[16:20.240 --> 16:26.240]  that the people that we're saying man made global warming is real and you need to pay a carbon tax
[16:26.240 --> 16:31.520]  and you should only have a two-child policy and yes we write books like eco science where we say
[16:31.520 --> 16:38.480]  we'll put sterilins in the water and we actually put out press releases that climate change is
[16:38.480 --> 16:42.560]  increasing prostitution in third world nations it's pulling more people i have that headline over
[16:42.560 --> 16:51.040]  here we'll get to that later the guy steps down we may have an investigation in congress the emails
[16:51.040 --> 16:57.440]  are real and they're still going you read that document the word government appears over two
[16:57.440 --> 17:03.440]  dozen times whether it be government or intergovernmental and remember one of the pillars of this
[17:03.440 --> 17:10.880]  document is a new global government then the word tax appears at least a dozen times people will
[17:10.880 --> 17:15.920]  tell me oh you work the leftist out there they're they're admitting that the emails are real they're
[17:15.920 --> 17:22.400]  admitting it's a problem george munbayot being one of them out of the guardian huge globalist wrote
[17:22.400 --> 17:29.120]  a book called the new world order by the way won't talk about 911 truth except in a derogatory manner
[17:29.120 --> 17:35.280]  now this guy is a piece of work he writes a piece and he says yes we have to acknowledge that the
[17:35.280 --> 17:41.360]  emails are real but we also have to acknowledge that people won't understand why they said the
[17:41.360 --> 17:47.760]  things they did and climate change is still real and he uses the term climate change denier trying
[17:47.760 --> 17:53.920]  to associate anybody that is a skeptic of manmade global warming and they've changed the definition
[17:53.920 --> 17:57.840]  many many times and remember there was supposed to be global cooling back when my parents were in
[17:57.840 --> 18:02.400]  school then when i was in school they taught us that global warming was happening because there
[18:02.400 --> 18:09.280]  was a hole in the ozone layer from our chlorofluorocarbons cfcs spray paints hairspray killing
[18:09.280 --> 18:14.160]  the earth that way then when that didn't stand up to the data when that was a big joke they changed
[18:14.160 --> 18:19.680]  the terminology against semantical word games and they said no we'll call it climate change
[18:19.680 --> 18:25.120]  we'll call it manmade climate change and then we'll figure out a way to tax people for carbon
[18:25.120 --> 18:30.640]  it doesn't matter that nobody can see carbon during the regular day and most of the populace is so
[18:30.640 --> 18:35.520]  dumbed down they have no idea what carbon dioxide is see that'll work in our favor they'll think it's
[18:35.520 --> 18:43.760]  a harmful pollutant meanwhile it's a life-giving gas and part of the natural structure it's what
[18:43.760 --> 18:49.040]  plants breathe and we'll put a guy named al gore on the cover of newsweek with a green apple we'll
[18:49.040 --> 18:55.280]  start this whole green thing and he'll make billions but we'll make trillions see he's the front man
[18:55.280 --> 19:01.360]  man so again getting getting back to this climate scientist at center of email controversy to step
[19:01.360 --> 19:06.320]  down a scientist who is one of the central figures in the controversy over hacked emails from the
[19:06.320 --> 19:11.600]  university of east angilia's climate research unit announced tuesday that he is stepping down
[19:11.600 --> 19:16.240]  while the university investigates the incident remember these emails said things we're going to
[19:16.240 --> 19:23.120]  use tricks we had to hide the data we can't show you the global cooling trend of the last eight to
[19:23.120 --> 19:30.000]  nine years unbelievable climate skeptics have seized on several emails several
[19:31.120 --> 19:35.200]  several thousand emails are out there from phil jones as well are the documents but you

[25:34.880 --> 25:38.400]  popular mechanics they called them out a little bit and we're going to call them out further
[25:38.400 --> 25:43.040]  later in the program play some clips there play a clip at john farmer saying that the nine 11

[26:18.640 --> 26:24.080]  from the israeli operatives to the pakistanis that funded the operation to the saudi arabians that
[26:24.080 --> 26:28.800]  were really a cia front group giving visas to these hijackers while they were trained at us
[26:28.800 --> 26:34.240]  military bases and the shadow government the e four b's are actually caught on video during
[26:34.240 --> 26:38.640]  the war games on the morning of nine 11 at the site of the attacks get fabled enemies
[26:38.640 --> 26:44.160]  all right let's get back into this climate heat because it is so important to understand
[26:44.800 --> 26:53.120]  this scientist bill jones is now stepping down stepping down penn state is going to do an
[26:53.120 --> 26:59.200]  investigation and let's read this one right here because this is big penn state will investigate
[26:59.200 --> 27:04.320]  climate heat among other things the watergate scandal of the 1970s gave us great naming convention
[27:04.320 --> 27:11.200]  for future scandals take climate gate at penn state that's what people are calling the controversy
[27:11.200 --> 27:16.080]  surrounding leaked emails among climate change researchers that climate change opponents they
[27:16.080 --> 27:25.600]  expose the researchers falsification of data which it does again you don't dump the raw data
[27:26.640 --> 27:32.400]  if it actually makes your case they hid this data for years they dumped it after the fact
[27:32.400 --> 27:38.560]  because they knew how bad that would be and luckily we either had an inside whistleblower
[27:38.560 --> 27:42.640]  or somebody handy with a computer who has exposed the truth on this and remember the leftist want
[27:42.640 --> 27:48.080]  to focus on oh these emails were hacked we need more cyber security let's pass that act let's
[27:48.080 --> 27:54.080]  pass the cyber bullying act we need more draconian laws so we can bring in our world government of
[27:54.080 --> 28:04.080]  peace meanwhile their leftist puppet just announced again 34 000 more troops in afghanistan it doesn't
[28:04.080 --> 28:08.560]  matter on the campaign trail he said if i'm elected president we will start bringing troops home
[28:08.560 --> 28:15.360]  immediately now he says we're going to put 34 000 more in there and they've already been escalating
[28:15.360 --> 28:21.200]  this slowly but surely since his inception two thousand here three thousand there four thousand
[28:21.200 --> 28:26.640]  there seven thousand here and we've been reporting on it here at info wars.com on the alex joneshow
[28:27.200 --> 28:32.800]  on the info warrior with jason bermus telling you the truth we knew he was a warmonger we knew
[28:32.800 --> 28:41.520]  he worked for the elite we knew that he would just continue the same same policies both foreign
[28:41.520 --> 28:46.400]  and domestic of the bush administration see they start blowing out the economy at the end of the
[28:46.400 --> 28:51.920]  bush administration he makes a slight apology obama comes to the people and he says well we need to
[28:51.920 --> 28:57.360]  pass these bailouts we need to do all these things that are also going to gut the economy
[28:57.360 --> 29:02.080]  meanwhile we'll stay in the wars as i tell you no we'll withdraw the troops immediately now he's
[29:02.080 --> 29:11.280]  putting 34 000 more but with the spin that in 18 months he'll start bringing troops home no actual
[29:11.280 --> 29:18.480]  plan no actual numbers but now they're saying oh we have an actual plan eight years later
[29:19.440 --> 29:28.960]  in afghanistan how wild is that and the suckers out there are buying it what happened to code pink

[33:25.040 --> 33:30.320]  who's written a great piece on how to take these bastards on how to sue for climb a gate how to
[33:30.320 --> 33:35.680]  actually prosecute these people and we're going to get into that in a moment in hoff is asking
[33:35.680 --> 33:40.160]  barba boxer to investigate possible scientific conspiracy and climb a gate what do you mean

[33:49.120 --> 33:55.200]  on god's green earth don't you understand what this is about again the dumb down populace is
[33:55.200 --> 34:01.920]  buying into carbon dioxide as a taxable substance something they can't see something they can't feel
[34:01.920 --> 34:08.560]  it almost feels like an episode of the twilight zone and none of their science proves their quote
[34:08.560 --> 34:15.120]  unquote theory it's not a theory it's a way to shake you down and again penn state will investigate
[34:15.120 --> 34:19.920]  climate gate the penn state administration plans to investigate climate gate and determine if it
[34:19.920 --> 34:25.200]  needs to take further action the daily collision reports a little more than a week ago emails
[34:25.200 --> 34:30.080]  exchanged among english universities climate change researchers were illegally obtained
[34:30.080 --> 34:35.680]  from a server and posted online the report says oh the bad hackers exposed the truth
[34:35.680 --> 34:40.080]  they were only going to tax the entire world population oh wait they're still going to the
[34:40.080 --> 34:48.240]  kopenhagen summit they're still going to try to do this robert gibbs says they don't matter because
[34:48.240 --> 34:54.080]  most people still believe in climate change in man-made climate change that's taxable
[34:55.360 --> 34:58.880]  that's the real deal and we're going to play some of the obama speech from last night in
[34:58.880 --> 35:04.560]  afghanistan coming up and it's towards the end i'm only going to play a minute or so of it but
[35:04.560 --> 35:11.280]  he kind of reveals himself and then just uses a big fat lie to drum it up he starts talking about
[35:11.280 --> 35:16.160]  how the united states is really broad in globalization talks about the united nations and the world
[35:16.160 --> 35:21.600]  bank and then he says well we haven't always been thanked for our efforts and then he says but unlike
[35:21.600 --> 35:30.640]  the powers of the past we have never saw world domination is that a joke you right now are
[35:30.640 --> 35:37.440]  assisting the globalists militarily by the way and not by you you're the front group that's
[35:37.440 --> 35:43.520]  not my military out there killing brown people for their resources for their opium for their oil
[35:43.520 --> 35:53.440]  for eurasian union they will plan to build out of that that's not my america and he says that
[35:53.440 --> 35:59.200]  we've never done this we've never taken another nation's resources i mean i couldn't believe
[35:59.200 --> 36:03.040]  this so we're going to play that for you in a moment let's finish up with this penn state will
[36:03.040 --> 36:08.960]  investigate climate gate climate change opponents say the emails indicate the climate change
[36:08.960 --> 36:14.960]  researchers including penn state professor michael man exaggerated or fabricated global warming data
[36:14.960 --> 36:19.200]  and according to the report some emails indicate that the director of the research unit in question
[36:19.200 --> 36:24.880]  may have contacted researchers and asked them to delete certain emails of course they did
[36:24.880 --> 36:29.520]  penn state officials who will not discuss the matter are investigating the controversy if
[36:29.520 --> 36:34.400]  anything requires further inspection the school handle it a spokesman tells the daily collision
[36:34.400 --> 36:39.680]  well i sure hope so a panel will read every email leaked and determined if climate change critics
[36:39.680 --> 36:44.160]  have any ground for their accusations the report says i would be disappointed if the university
[36:44.160 --> 36:50.160]  wasn't doing all it can to get as much information as possible about the controversy man tells the
[36:50.160 --> 36:57.760]  daily Copenhagen see man's trying to play the victim oh they stole my emails they stole my emails
[36:57.760 --> 37:07.040]  well let's hope it gets taken a step further a step up in hoff asks boxer to investigate
[37:07.040 --> 37:13.040]  possible scientific conspiracy in climate gate senator james and hoff at oklahoma ranking
[37:13.040 --> 37:17.920]  member of the senate committee on environment and public works is calling on chairman barbara
[37:17.920 --> 37:22.320]  boxer to conduct hearings on a possible conspiracy between some of the world's most
[37:22.320 --> 37:28.000]  prominent climatologists to among other things manipulate data on so-called global warming
[37:28.560 --> 37:32.560]  in hoff said the recent disclosure of emails between several prominent climatologists
[37:32.560 --> 37:39.360]  reveal possible deceitful manipulation of important data and research used by the us global change
[37:40.240 --> 37:48.160]  research program and the un's here it is the un's ipcc which is the intergovernmental panel
[37:48.160 --> 37:57.920]  on climate change it is about global government and once again thank thank you australia thank you
[37:58.480 --> 38:04.400]  for voting down the ets the emissions trading standard over there thank you for dealing
[38:04.400 --> 38:08.480]  another blow to the globalist you think kevin rudd's not going to go to the Copenhagen treaty
[38:09.040 --> 38:13.920]  oh he's going and he's signing on it doesn't matter that these emails are out there to the
[38:13.920 --> 38:19.280]  elitists to the globalist they're going to try to push forward that's why we have to put pressure
[38:19.280 --> 38:25.280]  on our local representatives our state officials and say no we are not going to stand for this
[38:25.280 --> 38:29.760]  these people need to be investigated and prosecuted to the full extent of the law
[38:29.760 --> 38:35.600]  and we're going to be discussing that big time with jim o'neill former us navy seal his article
[38:35.600 --> 38:42.560]  up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv right now we are now going to go to alex jones
[38:42.560 --> 38:48.640]  who's on assignment out in dallas alex how are you today i'm great jason how am i coming into you
[38:48.640 --> 38:54.560]  from downtown dallas loud and clear sir good if i drive around a little bit colder here than it is
[38:54.560 --> 39:01.280]  an awesome well several issues to discuss obviously i wanted to chime in today with the situation with
[39:01.280 --> 39:09.200]  obama's uh troop uh surge for central asia in afghanistan but first i wanted to get into climate
[39:09.200 --> 39:17.040]  gate you were just discussing climate gate one a week and a half ago when i literally popped champagne
[39:17.040 --> 39:22.160]  on the radio show on on the sunday broadcast i knew that that was the equivalent of getting
[39:22.160 --> 39:28.640]  the death star plans now the death star has blown up but the empire is still there but this is a
[39:28.640 --> 39:35.200]  major morale booster for everybody that loves truth of liberty and integrity and it is literally the
[39:35.200 --> 39:42.400]  beginning of the end of the new world order if we all do our part in educating everyone about this
[39:42.400 --> 39:49.440]  fraud that's part of the world government system according to the head of the u.n. ban kai moon
[39:49.440 --> 39:56.400]  ban ranghui all of them is this global carbon tax system and that's only one element but the
[39:56.400 --> 40:03.680]  overall fraud that global warming or climate change period is caused by man for years uh
[40:03.680 --> 40:09.120]  scientists and research laboratories would compile their own data and it didn't show uh
[40:09.120 --> 40:14.480]  since the 60s what at the time the u.n. was saying the earth was going into an ice age
[40:14.480 --> 40:20.720]  when they said no it's actually cool warming and then by the 90s they said okay it's it's
[40:20.720 --> 40:25.840]  eating because we were in a eating friend and the scientists said yes but that's not man made
[40:25.840 --> 40:33.760]  that's the sun and other factors and then uh in the last nine years it's been dramatically cooling
[40:33.760 --> 40:39.520]  according to all the major weather stations that actually have put the devices the thermometers
[40:39.520 --> 40:46.480]  and other devices uh to uh keep computerized records and so for those that don't know yesterday
[40:46.480 --> 40:52.080]  bill jones the head climatologist for the u.n. this is the this is the research lab where all
[40:52.080 --> 40:57.600]  the world's data was collated by the u.n. and where it was cooked everyone knows we have their
[40:57.600 --> 41:02.800]  internal emails we have their internal computer programs they use with notes by the programmers
[41:02.800 --> 41:07.760]  in the programs for future programmers that have problems how to carry out the fraud
[41:07.760 --> 41:12.320]  how to persecute scientists how to persecute peer reviewed journals how to get people fired
[41:13.040 --> 41:17.120]  so that's a whole other criminal area right there not just hiding the decline
[41:17.120 --> 41:23.120]  uh fixing the data manipulating it and hiding the fact that the world was getting colder
[41:23.760 --> 41:30.800]  for the last nine to ten years as they began to panic well now bill jones the head ringleader
[41:30.800 --> 41:35.520]  of the scientist who was recruited by the united nations we now have those internal documents it's
[41:35.520 --> 41:42.480]  more and more spills out to to go out and recruit others for fraud he is now stepping down first it
[41:42.480 --> 41:49.200]  was three members of the number two party in australia now it's five members have resigned
[41:49.200 --> 41:53.680]  others are stepping down and discussed over what their own party's been pushing with the climate
[41:53.680 --> 41:59.680]  tax they've already passed over there that hooked into the u.n. system their investigations into
[41:59.680 --> 42:05.360]  zealand in canada in the u.s. with all the major national weather services caught integrating the
[42:05.360 --> 42:11.920]  fraud fixing their data on their end in line with the climate research center in east anglia
[42:11.920 --> 42:18.640]  england so it's this is only the beginning just like when the police pull somebody over for speeding
[42:18.640 --> 42:23.040]  and there's blood in the back seats they pop the trunk and they find a woman with her head severed
[42:23.040 --> 42:29.360]  in the back that was climategate that was finding that that was the documents being leaked by it's
[42:29.360 --> 42:35.120]  clear now inside staffers who didn't want to be part of the fraud then they go to the farmhouse
[42:35.840 --> 42:40.320]  uh and that's what's happening now and they're digging up hundreds of bodies and so new bodies
[42:40.320 --> 42:46.880]  are popping up every day new crimes evidence of the crimes are coming out and this is exploding
[42:46.880 --> 42:51.040]  in their face even more spectacularly than i thought again i thought it might take months and
[42:51.040 --> 42:56.000]  months or years to blow up the death star again that's my star wars analogy but no the plan's
[42:56.000 --> 43:01.200]  got stolen the death star the day start blew up yesterday but again we still got super star
[43:01.200 --> 43:05.840]  destroyers to deal with we've still got the main imperial force to deal with they're still garrison
[43:05.840 --> 43:11.120]  in all our towns all our cities al gore admits it's a religious cult which the humans said in the
[43:11.120 --> 43:16.080]  70s they were going to use and again in 96 in their biological diversity assessment that man likes
[43:16.080 --> 43:21.920]  religions they would package a neo eugenical religion around exterminating humans and restricting
[43:21.920 --> 43:30.160]  our our numbers and and and and one child policies so literally they are burning to the ground they
[43:30.160 --> 43:35.920]  tried to ignore it they tried to spin it but the emails the computer programs the documents the
[43:35.920 --> 43:42.000]  university investigations going on in canada england australian new zealand germany are so
[43:42.000 --> 43:48.560]  devastating a whole bunch of different professors are about to be kicked out they're about to lose
[43:48.560 --> 43:53.680]  their tenure that's happening in pennsylvania that's happening in toronto it's happening in
[43:53.680 --> 44:01.200]  london it's happening at first uh it's happening literally everywhere as the rats leave the
[44:01.200 --> 44:05.120]  sinking ship and guaranteed that's already happening more leaks are going to happen more
[44:05.120 --> 44:09.360]  documents are going to come out more evidence more whistleblowers more people that don't want to go
[44:09.360 --> 44:14.640]  to prison because this is criminal are now starting to blow the whistle because you're talking about a
[44:14.640 --> 44:19.600]  global human program and their documents came out two days ago where they've orchestrated this for
[44:19.600 --> 44:26.080]  world government for global governance and as a world tax so everyone should rejoice at this right
[44:26.080 --> 44:32.560]  ahead of covenhagen uh but at the same time not just rejoice at what's happening but redouble and
[44:32.560 --> 44:37.200]  then redouble and then redouble and then redouble and then redouble because we've been given a
[44:37.200 --> 44:42.640]  spirit of weakness we've been given a spirit of not having been given a mindset an idea an outlook
[44:42.640 --> 44:47.360]  that were powerless the globalists have always drove us into our heads because they know we are
[44:47.360 --> 44:55.360]  incredibly powerful incredibly dynamic when we have truth on our side which we do and so this
[44:55.360 --> 45:00.800]  is a wondrous thing that is happening but this is only the beginning lord montan next funding
[45:00.800 --> 45:05.760]  in tuesday is going to be reporting live we just confirmed this morning uh talking to his wife he
[45:05.760 --> 45:11.040]  should be reporting to us live next week from the covenhagen denmark global government global
[45:11.040 --> 45:15.680]  tax treaty where they admit they take over all the banking all the systems give it all to the
[45:15.680 --> 45:19.840]  imf this couldn't have come out of the better time and it turns out six and a half weeks ago at
[45:19.840 --> 45:25.920]  east anglia researchers there were very upset that's some of the emails saying you can't hide this
[45:25.920 --> 45:33.520]  for you can't lie we shouldn't have done this and uh now all the smart money is on the fact that uh
[45:33.520 --> 45:39.280]  junior researchers and scientists and doctors and climatologists at that huge center are the ones
[45:39.280 --> 45:45.120]  that released this that it was directly quote stolen what is the people's data uh out of the system
[45:45.120 --> 45:50.000]  also in the emails they're talking to different government officials in england and the us about
[45:50.000 --> 45:55.040]  how to block four years the freedom information act request they have in the england and in the
[45:55.040 --> 46:01.760]  united states so this is only the beginning we are winning keep drumming keep beating the drum of
[46:01.760 --> 46:06.080]  truth keep emailing everyone keep getting the stories from info wars dot com and prison planet
[46:06.080 --> 46:11.120]  dot com we have links up there to lord montan's climate gate breakdown paper he's written that
[46:11.120 --> 46:16.240]  it's stunningly powerful and convinces everything he's barely even been sleeping i'm told to have
[46:16.240 --> 46:22.400]  put this together this compendium of the latest fraud and the history of their fraud we are witnessing
[46:22.400 --> 46:29.040]  history right now is the Stalinistic it larian malistic whole potish people are being routed
[46:29.040 --> 46:33.440]  this was their pretext to grab control of all resources on on the planet and vertically
[46:33.440 --> 46:38.000]  integrate them into the hands of the bankers i know you have a guest coming up next hour on
[46:38.000 --> 46:44.000]  that front so this is just a gigantic victory case absolutely alex and we have more victories than
[46:44.000 --> 46:50.320]  that uh penn state will investigate climate gate in hoff asks boxer to start an investigation
[46:50.320 --> 46:55.200]  on possible scientific conspiracy and climate gate and just yesterday the australia carbon
[46:55.200 --> 47:01.680]  laws failed the emissions trading scheme went down in parliament people are waking up yet our
[47:01.680 --> 47:07.200]  leaders still are marching towards this treaty as if nothing nothing is happening gives his saying
[47:07.200 --> 47:11.920]  in the press room that's the uh president's secretary his press secretary he's saying
[47:11.920 --> 47:16.880]  that it doesn't matter because most people still believe in climate change alex well notice
[47:16.880 --> 47:21.920]  that's a fraud hidden in plain p right there first it was global freezing in the sixties
[47:21.920 --> 47:26.640]  then by the eighties and nineties it was global warming now uh what six months ago the new
[47:26.640 --> 47:31.200]  work times their own memos came out with the white house was saying now say climate change
[47:31.200 --> 47:36.320]  the terror hitting atmosphere the oceans are going to turn to acid by you know basically chicken
[47:36.320 --> 47:43.760]  little they are caught red-handed this is a this is the equivalent of 20 high-powered torpedoes
[47:43.760 --> 47:47.920]  hitting their aircraft carrier their aircraft carrier magazine where all the armaments are
[47:47.920 --> 47:54.000]  stored just blew up like a fireworks factory and uh this is just absolutely devastating now here's
[47:54.000 --> 48:01.120]  the badness washington state's already taxing business owners they have to track their employees
[48:01.120 --> 48:06.320]  or they take the train the bus of the car if they they tax them depending on what they take the
[48:06.320 --> 48:11.920]  federal government and multiple states including texas are moving to put tracker systems in all
[48:11.920 --> 48:16.960]  our cars and taxes by the miles of carbon tax schwarzenegger his band big television he's putting
[48:16.960 --> 48:23.200]  a tax but the legislature didn't pass a law he just had a denerty commission the bureaucracy do it
[48:23.200 --> 48:28.080]  many i mean there are so many hundreds when i say hundreds i mean hundreds of different carbon
[48:28.080 --> 48:32.480]  taxes and environmental taxes that are nothing to do with the environment nothing to do with
[48:32.480 --> 48:36.960]  real environmental issues we have like toxic waste genetic engineering cross species that
[48:36.960 --> 48:42.160]  things we talk about so much it's also a big diversion from all of that so in the un documents
[48:42.160 --> 48:46.960]  that came out two days ago that paul watson's written about they brag we've taken over the
[48:46.960 --> 48:52.320]  children we're brainwashing their children uh the kids are coming home paddling on their parents
[48:52.320 --> 48:56.800]  riding a mock ticket they're giving the kids uniforms worldwide they are literally taking
[48:56.800 --> 49:02.560]  over our children we are simply winning a major battle right now but the war is on
[49:03.200 --> 49:07.440]  and we have to root them out of the school district we have to root them out of the colleges
[49:07.440 --> 49:11.760]  we have to shout these frauds down everywhere that's why it's so beautiful uh we've got them on
[49:11.760 --> 49:17.120]  demora what we are change chicago did when they did the best job i've ever seen of exposing him
[49:17.120 --> 49:21.600]  face to face uh in front of all the media for climate change and alan gordon getting red in
[49:21.600 --> 49:29.120]  the face this is now happening everywhere they go this is just so amazing to see people taking
[49:29.120 --> 49:34.400]  action getting involved and standing up against this corruption but the battle is now on the
[49:34.400 --> 49:39.760]  the royal rumble is now on and we're gonna go to break i'm gonna come back for five minutes and talk
[49:39.760 --> 49:43.840]  about how gamma stand and then let jason do his next guest i appreciate you sitting in on fort
[49:43.840 --> 49:49.120]  notice jason but i also want to put a plug in for fall of the republic fall of the republic
[49:49.120 --> 49:55.440]  an hour of the two hour 24 minute film is about the climate fraud how it's really eugenics
[49:55.440 --> 49:59.040]  and how people are noticing that michael prighton wrote a big s-name before he died
[49:59.040 --> 50:05.440]  about how climate uh uh cult is really a eugenics cult anybody who's a researcher
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.360]  from the left right it doesn't matter is now discovering this and and our listeners are
[50:11.360 --> 50:17.040]  getting the word out about this and so by exposing climate gate their entire eugenics global
[50:17.040 --> 50:23.360]  population reduction scheme has been blown sky high there's a chain reaction ladies and gentlemen
[50:23.360 --> 50:28.000]  everyone could feel the victory the spirit of liberty the spirit of proof of integrity
[50:28.000 --> 50:34.560]  literally in the air absolutely alex the emails speak for themselves the fact that these scientists
[50:34.560 --> 50:39.760]  dumped the raw data speaks for itself if the data proved what they said they would have kept that
[50:39.760 --> 50:44.960]  data no they had to keep it out of the hands of the truth this is the alex joneshow i am jason

[54:07.200 --> 54:13.680]  we have spilled american blood in many countries on multiple continents we have spent our revenue
[54:13.680 --> 54:19.840]  to help others rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies we have joined with others
[54:19.840 --> 54:25.120]  to develop an architecture of institutions from the united nations to nato to the world bank
[54:25.120 --> 54:28.480]  that provide for the common security and prosperity of human beings
[54:31.520 --> 54:36.480]  we have not always been thanked for these efforts and we have at times made mistakes
[54:38.400 --> 54:44.080]  but more than any other nation the united states of america has underwritten global security for
[54:44.080 --> 54:52.160]  over six decades a time that for all its problems has seen walls come down and markets open and
[54:52.160 --> 54:58.800]  billions lifted from poverty unparalleled scientific progress and advancing frontiers of human liberty
[55:00.880 --> 55:08.080]  for unlike the great powers of old we have not sought world domination our union was founded
[55:08.080 --> 55:15.840]  in resistance to oppression we do not seek to occupy other nations we will not claim another
[55:15.840 --> 55:21.600]  nation's resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity is different
[55:21.600 --> 55:25.920]  there he is just spouting his propaganda it's the alex joneshow on jason bermas sitting in and
[55:25.920 --> 55:33.440]  what do you think about that alex well it's off the guard uh i mean the united states that is the
[55:33.440 --> 55:39.360]  banks of high tech is the 1913 and 1945 created the united nations the presidio naval station
[55:39.920 --> 55:45.440]  in san francisco our government created the world bank and runs it our government created nato
[55:45.440 --> 55:50.240]  it's used as part of the global imperium we have hundreds of internal pentagon documents
[55:50.240 --> 55:55.840]  the peanut documents written by dick cheney saying we're an empire saying we're here for global
[55:55.840 --> 56:00.880]  domination Henry Kissinger is the big number density the main advisors on foreign policy to
[56:00.880 --> 56:05.200]  barack obama admit we're an empire in multiple books that he's written like the grand chess
[56:05.200 --> 56:10.240]  board and others and countless speeches uh he says we're not a tool of global domination
[56:10.800 --> 56:16.960]  but he plays that mind game of going clear angry with the u n and the world bank and nato
[56:16.960 --> 56:21.760]  because they don't appreciate us so the average american goes yeah he does lock the u n this
[56:21.760 --> 56:26.640]  is the guy who's still currently the only sitting president to ever be the head of the u n security
[56:26.640 --> 56:32.080]  council this is the guy allowing their foreign corporate creation they built the u n as an
[56:32.080 --> 56:37.840]  offshore corporate crime syndicate to then come in and hijack the united states that built to begin
[56:37.840 --> 56:43.680]  with the federal reserve has created its own international government so we can see the
[56:43.680 --> 56:49.840]  authority directly to a government that's illicit that it created obviously we're occupying iraq
[56:49.840 --> 56:54.240]  obviously the globalists are using american muscle and blood and money uh in afghanistan
[56:54.240 --> 56:59.040]  and bankrupting us in the process you know i said months ago not that i'm smart i know the pentagon
[56:59.040 --> 57:03.840]  game oh we're gonna be in iraq six months oh then two years and we'll look at it oh we increase the
[57:03.840 --> 57:07.760]  troops and in other two years we'll remove those troops but keep the original troops and then he
[57:07.760 --> 57:13.840]  said again oh in two years i'll look at removing the additional 30 plus thousand but we're always
[57:13.840 --> 57:19.360]  going to stay there so it's the exact same pentagon line greeting on the pentagon teleprompter
[57:19.360 --> 57:24.960]  everything is written for him just like george bush they put obama in to get the left to stand
[57:24.960 --> 57:30.800]  down against the war and i noticed i was watching cnn last night they admitted well actually obama
[57:30.800 --> 57:36.960]  sent 80 000 troops this will be 80 000 that's right i mean he already sent 40 something thousand
[57:36.960 --> 57:41.680]  in the last 11 months that no one discussed because the big distraction of oh will he have a
[57:41.680 --> 57:47.520]  third what will he do on the war oh you know to give him left cover they had the fake right
[57:47.520 --> 57:52.880]  in this song and dance come out and say oh he won't beat up the troops when they needed
[57:52.880 --> 57:58.880]  when he already escalated it with nato troops un troops and 40 000 plus us troops found additional
[57:58.880 --> 58:05.440]  30 plus thousand and in three years you watch they're going to send even more and by the way
[58:05.440 --> 58:10.880]  afghanistan is a great success it is it's not there for democracy it's not there for freedom
[58:10.880 --> 58:16.560]  it's there to have wars with the opium wars over the 500 million a year in opium it's over the

[1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:36.000]  obama administration for the past eight years the cia has been running drugs with carzai's brother

[1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:47.040]  afghanistan with another 34 000 troops it's the alex jones show i'm jason bermas sitting in alex
[1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:52.320]  what do you think about that well it came out in the early 70s congressional testimony the cia was
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:59.200]  shipping most the opium out of southeast asia this is declassified the 1996 uh cia inspector
[1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:03.920]  kenrault that's five before congress i have it on date saw on c span that the cia shipped in most
[1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:09.440]  the cocaine this is an open secret and they now admit oh our troops guard the poppies so the
[1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:17.360]  tautobahn won't get it there's over 13 fold pre 9 11 amount of opium world records have been broken
[1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:22.720]  three times over 80 plus almost 90 percent of world opium that turned into heroin and other
[1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:29.760]  opiate drugs pouring out of afghanistan uh this is a war over the 500 billion dollars that they
[1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:35.840]  begin they can leverage in the banks to over five trillion a year again devastating success
[1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:41.120]  total precision by the pentagon they turned america into a police state obama in his speech
[1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:45.520]  was talking about where this beacon of light and hope and freedom really were worse than china
[1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:50.720]  on many fronts g20 they would sound cannon young children out walking their dog or playing football
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:54.480]  in their front yard they'd go on the university at night they'd know as well on the streets
[1:01:54.480 --> 1:01:59.520]  and beat women they were on bicycles with clubs and attack old women with police dogs coming out
[1:01:59.520 --> 1:02:06.240]  of grocery stores all on video i mean this is a sick joke america has been captured by the
[1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:11.520]  same offshore banks that publicly fund the carbon tax takeover and enclosing on the carbon
[1:02:11.520 --> 1:02:16.160]  tax takeover with your next guest coming up let's not forget hundreds of billions of
[1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:21.440]  the spent the last two decades setting up this this this environment cult built around these
[1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:26.400]  taxes that has nothing to do with the environment they candy coated reasonable things like electric
[1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:30.480]  cars and windmills has nothing to do with any of that it's about taxing and regulating and
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:35.360]  tracking and pricing everything you do with carbon rations there's no more debate no more
[1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:40.480]  denial they are not going to give up without one hell of a fight but if we never shut up about
[1:02:40.480 --> 1:02:44.960]  climate change if more and more comes out which it is and if we keep pointing out you're just a
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:49.840]  bunch of fraud criminals and quit debating them i mean let's say put cars ian they probably
[1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:54.720]  meant with fake elections then our government complains about it to have the illusion that
[1:02:54.720 --> 1:02:59.760]  that he's not in control about a criminal globalist it's all theater it's all state
[1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:05.200]  obama and bush work together they're just mid-level puppets Kissinger and brzezinski and rockfeller
[1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:11.360]  and senator j rockfeller are many levels above them in the pyramid and that's what we expose
[1:03:11.360 --> 1:03:16.000]  in the obama deception and fall of a republic that's why they want to get it and make copies

[1:10:00.480 --> 1:10:11.200]  demolition team 21 and shield team two back in the early 70s and the reason why i'm trying to be
[1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:18.800]  on top of this whole climate gait thing is once i heard about these files being leaked or hacked
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:27.840]  from east anglia i just i knew this was it this was the achilles heel and as alex said just
[1:10:27.840 --> 1:10:34.960]  redouble and redouble and redouble efforts to bring this out keep it out put it on the front
[1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:42.400]  burner and and keep it on the front burner just uh this is it man we we gotta go after this and
[1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:49.440]  impound that absolutely and with these world leaders just to continue with their operation
[1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:54.800]  to not say oh my god this has been exposed as a fraud we shouldn't go to this copenhagen treaty
[1:10:54.800 --> 1:11:01.200]  i mean i've got headlines out of reuters right now that the carbon market out of the european
[1:11:01.200 --> 1:11:07.120]  union yet another step towards global governance is up to percent today how is that possible
[1:11:07.120 --> 1:11:13.600]  now that we have exposed that man-made climate change as they call it is nothing but a fraud
[1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:19.760]  let's go over uh some of the some of the highlights of your article attention lawyers make millions
[1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:25.120]  off of climate gait crooks let's let's talk about this what do you think are some of the the
[1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:36.880]  hot points of this well i i love the idea of going after them uh in in a legal way um yeah there's
[1:11:36.880 --> 1:11:44.160]  no tort reform in the healthcare bill because there's so many lawyers on the left and we need
[1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:51.200]  to switch that around there are a number a great number of patriotic conservative lawyers and if
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:59.520]  they start suing uh the various agencies and individuals involved in climate gait i i think
[1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:05.600]  well that number one that'll keep it on the front burner and number two they're going to make a lot
[1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:13.440]  of money and number three it'll bring it out to the public's awareness absolutely and this isn't
[1:12:13.440 --> 1:12:19.680]  really a new idea the co-founder of the weather channel john colman i believe it was last summer
[1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:26.160]  actually said you know we should go after al gore and his minions and supporters and sue them for
[1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:32.480]  fraud this was before these emails came out let's not forget these emails were leaked to the mainstream
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:39.520]  press i believe it was something like six weeks before they actually hit the net and bloggers
[1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:44.400]  started to pick up on it and then they could not ignore that these emails were actually real
[1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:51.680]  obviously the media and the elite have a vested interest in suppressing this information so lawyers
[1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:56.480]  don't do what you just said they should do and let's go after these criminals and make a pretty
[1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:03.760]  penny doing so absolutely the media has painted themselves into a corner and they they can't get
[1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:11.280]  out of it without getting egg all over their face it's it's unbelievable how what a big cover-up
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:20.560]  up is going on is the biggest news story in world history and they're like oh well whatever
[1:13:21.120 --> 1:13:28.000]  exactly i mean you have the press secretary gibbs getting up on television when he's asked
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:32.800]  about climate kate he says well that doesn't really matter because most people still believe
[1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:37.040]  in man-made climate change and it doesn't matter barack obama is still going to go to
[1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:42.400]  this copenhagen treaty let's hope that he doesn't sign some kind of a treaty or a referendum or
[1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:47.680]  they put out a communique in which he pledges us to cut our carbon emissions and it's not cutting
[1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:53.600]  our carbon carbon emissions it's taxing everybody for living and breathing let me read some of this
[1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:59.200]  article which is up over at info wars dot com right now idiots crooks and criminals there are only
[1:13:59.200 --> 1:14:03.760]  around two dozen individuals directly involved in the criminal fraud committed by climatology
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:09.520]  scientists did you hear that folks only around two dozen these people or as lord montan calls them
[1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:14.880]  idiots crooks and criminals should be tried in an international court for crimes against humanity
[1:14:14.880 --> 1:14:19.920]  agreed these people are already responsible for the deaths of millions of people worldwide let's
[1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:25.440]  stop right there and discuss that because as they subsidize things like corn for ethanol
[1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:30.240]  they are taking away food from third world nations and people are literally starving to death yes
[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:38.480]  absolutely uh the far left has historically uh been very enamored of population control
[1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:46.560]  and they don't some people will say that's that's why they banned dbt uh but but regardless that
[1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:54.240]  they they want to cut down on the world's population and they've discussed various ways
[1:14:54.240 --> 1:15:00.560]  of doing this and no doubt starvation is one of them and it's one of the reasons the other being
[1:15:00.560 --> 1:15:07.680]  that they want to wipe out the middle class but is what population control is is one of the reasons
[1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:14.800]  why why they're cutting back on america's food production absolutely and let's not forget people
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:20.480]  like kissinger and institutes like the united nations have talked about using food as a weapon
[1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:26.320]  that's right food as a weapon let's read some more of this article uh their insistent loud
[1:15:26.320 --> 1:15:31.360]  hysteric calls for co2 reduction or else have resulted in the implementation of laws that
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:37.280]  have built to taxpayers corporations and entire countries out of billions of dollars and not to
[1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:44.320]  mention really put another arm in their command and control cashless society control grid you look
[1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:50.800]  at the netherlands they have passed laws now that by 2011 each car will be taxed by the
[1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:57.520]  mile and they'll do this by installing a gps device in each vehicle and taxing you by the
[1:15:57.520 --> 1:16:05.840]  kilometer by the kilometer think about how crazy that is they're using carbon as an excuse not
[1:16:05.840 --> 1:16:11.760]  only to tax you but track trace and database you daily as you're in your vehicle this is wild stuff
[1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:16.240]  jim did you ever think that this would be being being implemented globally i mean when you see it
[1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:21.760]  coming to the united states and you are a veteran you have served for this country doesn't it just
[1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:29.200]  turn your stomach oh it's uh it's unbelievable to me but at the same time you gotta believe it
[1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:37.120]  it's happening it's uh but fortunately many many people are waking up to what's going on
[1:16:37.120 --> 1:16:42.800]  and i think that this i know that this climate gate is going to wake a lot of people there's
[1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:48.720]  going to be a huge upheaval well i certainly hope so i i hope that the listeners out there are just
[1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:55.120]  seeing this as a beginning when penn state says it will investigate climate gate when uh in hawth
[1:16:55.120 --> 1:17:00.560]  is asking barbara boxer to start a congressional investigation into the possible and it's not
[1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:07.280]  possible and it's not probable it's the proven conspiracy in climate gate when the man has to
[1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:14.720]  step down okay when he has to step down from his position as a university professor when these ghouls
[1:17:14.720 --> 1:17:20.880]  have to destroy all the original data and find a way to get away from freedom of information
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:25.040]  act requests i mean that's like having not only the blood on their hands but spattered all over
[1:17:25.040 --> 1:17:32.560]  their body as well yep and the mass media is like well what problem i mean we don't see it well when
[1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:37.120]  you see the leftist out there the globalist leftist such as george moonbay on i keep bringing him up
[1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:42.960]  because he is an unapologetic globalist who has called for global governance who has written a book
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:48.240]  called the new world order who now has pieces out there saying look we can't ignore climate gate and
[1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:54.000]  we can't act like these emails exist but we have to point out that most people are misinterpreting
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:59.520]  what the emails mean and they're just too dumb to understand that climate change is real and then
[1:17:59.520 --> 1:18:06.080]  he uses what i consider a disgusting term for anybody who questions man made climate change
[1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:12.800]  which is nothing more than a hoax a proven hoax folks he calls them climate change deniers trying
[1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:19.200]  to associate us with holocaust denial and that again is beyond repulsive it's the the whole
[1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:27.280]  term climate change it's just yeah it's so generic what does it mean well they they can mean anything
[1:18:27.280 --> 1:18:32.560]  they want it to me you know that as you have pointed out they started with global cooling
[1:18:32.560 --> 1:18:38.560]  then they went to global warming now it's climate change which yeah of course the climate changes
[1:18:38.560 --> 1:18:46.080]  it can cover anything they want it to cover but once you this this whole climate gate thing should
[1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:54.160]  awaken people to the fact that they've been scammed and it's fraud it's racketeering on an
[1:18:54.160 --> 1:19:01.760]  international level and it yeah you how much money are you going to be willing to put out
[1:19:01.760 --> 1:19:08.880]  paying in taxes individually in state tax it's a national tax for something that doesn't exist
[1:19:08.880 --> 1:19:16.560]  it it is it's incredible it is incredible to me that the general populace out there the the people
[1:19:16.560 --> 1:19:21.920]  who are you know know nothing do-gooders you know people who are being used by the system they think
[1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:26.480]  they're helping the system they're like well we got to save the world and you know climate change
[1:19:26.480 --> 1:19:32.560]  is going to kill us all they've tricked them into thinking co2 something that is invisible to them
[1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:37.760]  virtually invisible to them is a taxable substance something that can't really be measured
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:43.040]  but they can guilt you into having a lot into saying oh you have a large home you have a nice car
[1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:47.760]  you put out too much garbage we need the climate cops the climate police we'll be back after this

[1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:16.960]  we are back at the Alan Jones show i'm jason bermas sitting in we're discussing climate gate with
[1:24:16.960 --> 1:24:23.760]  former navy seal jim o'neill let me read some of this article for you co2 is not a danger and it
[1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:29.680]  never has been all of this toxic greenhouse gas nonsense is a load of rubbish scientists are
[1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:35.680]  familiar with the cambrian explosion a period in the earth's distant past when in a relatively
[1:24:35.680 --> 1:24:41.040]  brief period of time new forms of life burst into being around the globe during the cambrian
[1:24:41.040 --> 1:24:47.840]  explosion co2 levels were approximately 20 times higher than they are today that hardly qualifies
[1:24:47.840 --> 1:24:53.760]  co2 as some sort of life-threatening toxin or a man-made toxic gas for that matter at periods
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:24:59.120]  in the earth's past co2 levels have been up to 10 000 times higher than they are today i'm not
[1:24:59.120 --> 1:25:03.920]  saying that such extreme levels are healthy i'm just pointing out to the auto industry for example
[1:25:03.920 --> 1:25:09.760]  most assuredly had nothing to do with the extreme levels of co2 millions of years ago when mother
[1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:16.560]  nature feels like it she can leave one huge carbon footprint so why do you think the public has
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:24.960]  been so duped jim why can't people look at this understand that co2 has been at levels of 10 000
[1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:31.360]  times according to mainline science what they are today yet we're willing to give our sovereignty
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:38.880]  over over to global governance and a carbon tax well excuse me i would say that the mainstream
[1:25:38.880 --> 1:25:46.560]  media is a large part of it and hollywood of course and academia and they're all in cahoots
[1:25:46.560 --> 1:25:53.760]  to push this agenda and some for greed but mostly i think for political reasons for they have a
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:26:02.160]  political agenda and this is a way to topple the industrialized nations but by making it so expensive
[1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:10.720]  to build plants and manufacturing plants and power plants and for food production
[1:26:10.720 --> 1:26:19.200]  and it's on several different levels you know this this is agenda 21 this is the population
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:26.320]  control this is the spreading the wealth uh sustainable development which is another word for
[1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:32.640]  that really uh it's it's communism or marxism if you will it's just wearing new clothes
[1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:38.800]  and and they've been at this game for quite a while now and and it's it's at the point now
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:46.240]  where they believe that they can take off the mask and and you know but people are waking up now
[1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:54.000]  and i'd hopefully uh obama jumped the gun a bit and and there's still enough time
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:02.400]  where we can stop this and then go on a different path i wouldn't say reverse it i i don't want to
[1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:11.040]  go back but the status quo is no longer acceptable and we need to go we we need to think outside
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:18.560]  the box and go in a conservative direction but in a new direction why don't for the listeners
[1:27:18.560 --> 1:27:23.840]  you give just a quick overview of how we should pursue these lawsuits against the criminals
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:31.040]  sure i i would say is on an individual basis you could sue people like michael man
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:40.480]  at penn state you you can sue uh the state uh the different epa uh sustainable development
[1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:47.760]  agencies every county in the country has one now uh all the all the departments in the u.s
[1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:55.680]  government have their agenda 21 protocols in place i think there's almost it's almost an
[1:27:55.680 --> 1:28:03.120]  infinite list of places you could go to sue for being defrauded of your money i mean it's stealing
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:10.800]  if they're using these facts and figures which are not based on reality to to steal money from you
[1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:18.160]  that's fraud and and international fraud and it's local fraud and and also not not to mention
[1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:27.920]  is also emotional distress caused by all of this and i see a number of reasons to sue and an almost
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:33.280]  infinite number of places to sue do you have an email or a website we could give out where people
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:40.080]  could contact you and discuss this further well uh at this at this point really uh go go to

[1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:12.240]  hackers and illegal emails and you don't understand what this data means and again the press secretary
[1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:18.160]  of the white house is saying it doesn't matter because most people still believe in man-made
[1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:23.440]  climate change what do you expect is going to come out of this Copenhagen treaty in about 20 seconds
[1:29:25.040 --> 1:29:34.080]  well i i hope not but knowing oh uh obama he'll sign it i mean the man seems just not to care
[1:29:34.080 --> 1:29:42.080]  about what the people want he just cares about his far left agenda so i i fully expect him to sign

[1:33:22.720 --> 1:33:28.240]  we got a couple more guests coming up for you at the top of the next hour gary lackman
[1:33:29.200 --> 1:33:34.560]  former founding member and guitarist of blondie on his book politics and the occult and of course
[1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:40.320]  catherine austin fits for all the news financial but right now we have bob chatman popping in for
[1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:46.480]  about 10 minutes or so to discuss you know this surge of gold again it's hitting record highs
[1:33:46.480 --> 1:33:52.400]  and the global economic meltdown and how that relates to the dubai situation that is now hitting
[1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:59.600]  the mainstream media how you doing bob pretty good nice to be back again we get gold at 1213
[1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:07.520]  that's $1,213 as we're trading right now in the february market and all the shares are up all the
[1:34:07.520 --> 1:34:14.960]  coins are up exactly as ted adison and myself and alex said they would be and we got a long
[1:34:14.960 --> 1:34:22.080]  long way to go yet and i think in fact dubai is probably in some ways affecting this expediting
[1:34:22.080 --> 1:34:31.760]  it i have an interim number here of 1325 a pullback of 50 to 100 dollars and then another
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:39.680]  rally up to 1680 by the big beginning of april and then by the end of the year 2500 to 3000
[1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:45.680]  in the following year if things work out the way i think they will it'll go much higher
[1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:53.120]  so you're telling me within a year's time you expect gold to hit 2500 to 3000 or 3000 dollars
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:59.600]  an ounce when only a year ago around a year ago it was trading around 800 and back in 2003 it was
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:07.920]  below 300 that's right and they listen to this program and alex and ted and everybody has
[1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:12.400]  been buying and they're all making money well at least they're offsetting the losses that the
[1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:17.600]  doll is taking because it's under pressure all the time and we're going to come out solve it in
[1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:22.480]  the end and we're going to be able to do a lot of good things what alex and i have been talking
[1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:31.520]  about on the air is uh is uh what now major uh programs are talking about in fact yesterday
[1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:39.120]  uh if you can believe this rush limbaugh was talking about uh the fed in the in the 1207
[1:35:39.120 --> 1:35:44.880]  and he put a little tape on on ron paul and then he put one of mine on from some show i don't know
[1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:52.560]  but it shows you that they're being drawn into this whether they like it or not and so uh i
[1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:57.920]  imagine that alex's ratings probably are going through the roof as well but anyway getting on
[1:35:57.920 --> 1:36:06.720]  to dubai we only got 10 minutes here and um it was not a coincidence that the bad information
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:12.480]  was released on thanksgiving it was done deliberately to take gold and silver and commodities down
[1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:18.320]  and keep the market from going down 500 points and what happened was the market didn't go down
[1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:24.880]  500 or 100 or down 150 and a little bit more the following day the goal went down 50 and came back
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:30.560]  to a minus 12 and went up the next few days and the same with silver so they really didn't
[1:36:30.560 --> 1:36:37.120]  accomplish very much but as far as what this is going to mean in the future is if you take all
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:45.040]  of their off uh off balance sheet items there in dubai you're going to find that the debt is
[1:36:45.040 --> 1:36:53.120]  probably somewhere between 60 and 120 billion dollars and part of it will be picked up by avodabi
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:58.080]  and part of it will be picked up by european and us banks and they'll paper it over it'll take two
[1:36:58.080 --> 1:37:04.800]  or three years to do it uh probably one to two is more likely uh it's not a good event and it's part
[1:37:04.800 --> 1:37:11.600]  of what is causing gold to go up gold is not going up because of inflation gold is going up because
[1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:19.600]  sophisticated investors professionals people with money they are saying to themselves we don't
[1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:28.880]  believe what the central banks in the the top eight and ten nations of the world are saying we've
[1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:35.040]  lost confidence and trust in them and we want gold because we know they're not telling us the truth
[1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:41.760]  and that's where this is all going well i'm looking at the mainstream networks now when i'm on msnbc
[1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:48.480]  when i'm on fox news when i'm on cnbc all's i'm seeing now are advertisements either cash for
[1:37:48.480 --> 1:37:54.800]  gold or how you need to invest in gold gold is the new big investment i mean when the commercials
[1:37:54.800 --> 1:38:00.320]  are admitting that in under 10 years time gold has more than tripled in its value there are
[1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:06.400]  literally no other investments that i can think of at least honest ones that have done that you're
[1:38:06.400 --> 1:38:11.920]  absolutely right and we've been in the forefront for the last 10 years and everybody who's been
[1:38:11.920 --> 1:38:18.720]  been a subscriber has made money uh some of them made gogogs of money and if you look at the ratings
[1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:27.680]  i'm sure you're familiar with them uh the ratings on uh on the talk shows which is talk stream live
[1:38:28.880 --> 1:38:36.800]  have you ever seen that yeah and shellcast yeah i they had me uh first oh wow this week
[1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:43.280]  above hannity beck donahue laura i get the charts right in front of me here and so why am i telling
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:48.800]  you that i'm telling you that because like alex and i have talked about so many times on the program
[1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:56.880]  and that is we got them on the run and i love it where do you you know when you talk about gold
[1:38:56.880 --> 1:39:02.960]  in 12 months time and again 12 months ago was around 1800 or i'm sorry 800 and now we're at a
[1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:10.080]  record of 1200 when you talk about it at 2500 to 3000 a year from now what does the u.s economy even
[1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:16.080]  look like well uh it all depends on whether they have another stimulus and it all depends on whether
[1:39:16.640 --> 1:39:22.400]  uh the federal reserve removes 1.5 trillion dollars from the economy they want to because
[1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:27.680]  they don't want hyperinflation but if they pull the 1.5 trillion out part of which would come from
[1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:33.680]  tarp money coming back in again which banks are using to gamble in the stock market with uh
[1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:40.000]  if they if they don't take the money out and there's another stimulus program
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:46.960]  that will go sideways in the economy but that won't affect gold at all and if they do pull the money
[1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:53.440]  out 1.5 trillion we're going to head downward even if there was a stimulus package of say
[1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:58.240]  400 billion dollars i mean the dam that they do and dam that they don't there's no way out for
[1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:03.760]  these people they're in a cage and they can't get out they're like wild animals they're believing
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:09.520]  in their minds that's where they're going i mean when you have a blank fine uh who's the head of uh
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:18.000]  goldman sax say we're doing god's work i mean you've got to be kidding uh their god is not the
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:23.600]  same as mayan their god is lucifer and they are not doing the work of the american people
[1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:28.960]  or anybody else they're enriching themselves and they're trying to ensconce more power into their
[1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:38.160]  hands the international forecaster dot com is the website briefly before you go uh bob where are we
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:42.960]  in terms of unemployment and where do you see us in terms of unemployment in six months to a year
[1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:50.320]  it depends upon the package if there's no package the figures that have been declining
[1:40:51.440 --> 1:40:56.880]  from the bad levels they were at we'll start back going back up again so we'll go from 22.2
[1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:05.600]  percent during next year to 25 percent maybe 30 percent if they have a stimulus package and they
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:12.160]  increase lending to the business and public uh it'll stay relatively in the same area it all
[1:41:12.160 --> 1:41:17.520]  depends on what they do all right bob thank you so much tell people where they can get the newsletter
[1:41:19.040 --> 1:41:27.760]  the international forecaster dot com and where's that number i can't find it right now

[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:46.240]  seven nine eight one seven eight and uh hello ted and i hope you have a wonderful day all right
[1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:53.360]  thank you so much for joining us bob let's go now to gcn founder ted anderson and mitis resources
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:42:00.640]  ted again another record setting day today you know all i can say is get follow the republic
[1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:05.520]  and watch that thing and you'll be able to tell why this is happening uh we just i mean we're watching
[1:42:05.520 --> 1:42:10.080]  the dollar crumble in front of our eyes as a matter of fact it's not happening in front of our eyes
[1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:14.480]  because their clothes were sleeping when it's happening foreigners are pushing the market up
[1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:20.880]  i was watching gold last night i was working here till about 9 30 and i'm every now and then
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:28.160]  peeking into the uh asian market to see what's going on and gold had run up from the the the 1190
[1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:33.520]  level which it was here in the new york market when it closed over 1200 it was training right
[1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:39.120]  around 1200 and 10 and i'm walking around my brokers i said you watch this gold will be opening up
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:46.160]  around that 1220 range and sure enough it did i mean today it's hit a high uh currently right now
[1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:54.080]  it's the highest 200 to 1200 17 but that is so close to that 1220 that's what's going on i mean
[1:42:54.080 --> 1:42:58.400]  that the the foreigners want to get out of this stuff just like bob said they no longer trust
[1:42:58.400 --> 1:43:03.520]  the central banks and why would you each one of them have a printing press and every time there's
[1:43:03.520 --> 1:43:08.560]  a problem they just turn it on and start liquefying the value of the currencies that they're
[1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:13.760]  representing in their case it's the federal reserve system you know we have a we have a
[1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:20.240]  runaway spending government that has to depend upon people lending them money in order to operate
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:24.640]  and uh they they're not getting it anymore they're not getting earned money from foreigners to buy
[1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:29.600]  us government treasuries which is a loan to the government and so they have to turn to the fed
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:35.120]  which turns on the printing press and wamo you have rising gold prices and falling dollar
[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:42.400]  surprise surprise um yeah it's it's been just a very interesting very rocky topsy turvy market
[1:43:42.400 --> 1:43:49.200]  it's just all i can say is that the handwriting is on the wall i i do believe bob is right i was
[1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:54.960]  completely surprised to see gold jump over 1200 so soon as it did i was expecting it to sort of
[1:43:54.960 --> 1:44:00.000]  dabble around in that 1180 range but it just jumped right over that which just tells me
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:07.200]  that 1300 dollars an ounce is very close as well so uh it just you know the us meant had to stop
[1:44:07.200 --> 1:44:13.040]  mining or stop producing us eagles and silver eagles because they're running out of plan chats
[1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:16.960]  they've got too many back orders and what they already have so they put a stop to it they're
[1:44:16.960 --> 1:44:21.600]  not they didn't even say when they're going to start producing them again and the premiums on
[1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:26.560]  silver eagles and us eagles are skyrocketing right now because of it you know this is the
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:31.120]  kind of thing that i had going on just a couple years ago when gold and silver was running up
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:37.040]  like it was and i and i just need to say if you're not willing to at least take a look if you have
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:45.040]  your money socked away into a bank or if you're sitting on a 401k plan or an ira or if you have
[1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:49.760]  your money in annuities there's just a whole long line of various different investments
[1:44:49.760 --> 1:44:56.000]  that you could be in that right now are seriously looking at big trouble with the kind of economy
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:02.320]  that we have and i darn well seriously think you should take a look at that and maybe move at least
[1:45:02.320 --> 1:45:08.880]  20 to 25 percent of those assets into physical gold and i can tell you right now we have about
[1:45:08.880 --> 1:45:13.440]  five percent of the people into gold at this particular point and the percentage of money
[1:45:13.440 --> 1:45:18.720]  is that they're they're putting such a small little sliver in that if we've got to 25 percent
[1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:22.320]  for the rent for the whole public there just wouldn't be enough to go around prices would
[1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:26.960]  skyrocket and that's when you're talking about the six seven eight thousand dollars an ounce gold
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:33.280]  very comfortably we could see twenty six hundred dollar gold just because of you and just for the
[1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:39.440]  the inflation since 1980 where it hit its market high of eight hundred twenty six hundred dollars
[1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:47.760]  would be just basically saying that gold is valued the same as it was back in 1980 right now it's
[1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:53.120]  still at a discount based upon what the dollar's done but the market prices are going up i still
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:58.080]  have a few items left for those of you who picked up the walking liberty halves like i recommended
[1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:03.680]  yesterday at at that eight sixty nine price well very much congratulations to you they're now at
[1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:09.840]  ten dollars and sixty nine cents i still have the Lakota coin right now at twenty four dollars and
[1:46:09.840 --> 1:46:15.440]  fifty one cents i have the montana silver round at twenty two dollars and sixty three cents those
[1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:20.480]  are going to increase too the francs are going to be going up there they're still at two sixty three
[1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:26.400]  which is the same price that i offered for them offered you to them for offered them for you to
[1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:32.000]  you uh just a week ago and the british sovereign at three hundred and twenty five exactly the same
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:36.880]  price but you know i can't hold those prices forever markets are going up gold just jumped over
[1:46:36.880 --> 1:46:41.760]  twelve hundred dollars an ounce my goodness i was buying this stuff at eleven hundred and thirty
[1:46:41.760 --> 1:46:46.800]  eleven hundred and twenty five thinking you know wow this is like a new high peak if i could get
[1:46:46.800 --> 1:46:51.680]  gold again at eleven hundred and twenty five i would think i'd be just getting one of the greatest
[1:46:51.680 --> 1:46:56.800]  buys ever and that was the high price just about a week ago so you know do the math i mean i don't
[1:46:56.800 --> 1:47:00.560]  know where you're standing on on your portfolios at this time or what you're doing with your
[1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:05.680]  investments but give us a call we have a few items around here we even have the us eagles which are
[1:47:05.680 --> 1:47:12.320]  no longer in production give us a call at one eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:17.920]  because i don't want people missing out on this market i mean it isn't necessarily for the sake
[1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:22.960]  of making tons of money like bob was talking about but just for the sake of holding on to what you
[1:47:22.960 --> 1:47:27.440]  have i mean look at what do you think it's going to be worth if you're sitting in paper two years
[1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:32.560]  from now you know it's there there's just the united states government is deep in debt way
[1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:38.160]  beyond what it can pay and it's using a printing press to finance its troubles away it's like the
[1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:44.480]  we'll buy my republic we got problems here and we should stay away from that particular uh you
[1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:49.200]  know we got we got to get into gold and silver we got to get into something that's honest absolutely
[1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:54.560]  uh you know hard assets like gold and silver are the ones that are maintaining their value
[1:47:54.560 --> 1:48:00.320]  and going up again this time last year gold was around eight hundred dollars now it's passing the
[1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:05.520]  twelve hundred dollar point and it doesn't seem to have a roof on it i wouldn't be surprised if one
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:09.600]  or two months from now we did see it hit fifteen hundred dollars that's not out of the question
[1:48:09.600 --> 1:48:15.360]  at this point ed well it isn't and the only way that this is going to be turned around and stopped
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:20.480]  is if the united states government says sorry we're just going to have to default on the debts
[1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:25.520]  that we have and we're going to have to come back to the to our grassroots and get into some
[1:48:25.520 --> 1:48:30.960]  constitutional money like ron paul has been calling for but that is the exact you know what's going
[1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:37.120]  on now is the exact opposite of that the right now the government is still talking about stimulating
[1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:41.600]  the economy where do you think they're coming up with the money for this and where do you think
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:46.240]  they're going to raise the money for this new government health care system that they're putting
[1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:52.480]  together when medicare is already breaking their back they're gonna have to turn to you know to
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:58.800]  to use the sale of us government bonds notes and bills and nobody wants them now so they have to
[1:48:58.800 --> 1:49:03.120]  turn and sell them to the federal reserve the federal reserve if they didn't step in and buy
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:08.960]  these treasury notes bonds or bills the demand for loans would go up and push the interest rates up
[1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:14.160]  and stale out the economy and they don't want that either so that they're choosing to to print
[1:49:14.160 --> 1:49:20.560]  money to keep the interest rates low to try to affect you know the the economy bring down unemployment
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:25.440]  like bob was saying stimulate the economy if they do you know if they put more stimulus money in the
[1:49:25.440 --> 1:49:32.160]  economy it'll it'll solve the unemployment figures temporarily but in you know the the offset to that
[1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:37.600]  is is the value the currency is going to be worth less and that's why gold and silver will be worth
[1:49:37.600 --> 1:49:45.920]  more absolutely minus resources.com is the website 1-800-686-2237 get into gold and silver while you
[1:49:45.920 --> 1:49:50.080]  still can i'm not sure there's a lot of people out there that could afford gold at three thousand
[1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:55.760]  dollars an ounce possibly a year from now remember last year at this time at 800 it's already at 1200
[1:49:55.760 --> 1:50:00.720]  in 2003 when i started listening to the alex joneshow you can get an ounce of gold for under
[1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:07.840]  300 dollars and i challenge anybody out there to show me an investment that you got into in 2002
[1:50:07.840 --> 1:50:13.280]  or 2003 that has more than tripled in value like i said i don't believe there's an honest one
[1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:19.360]  out there outside of gold well i mean that's that's why people go to gold i mean it takes labor to
[1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:24.640]  create an ounce of gold people have to actually dig it up out of the ground it's a process where
[1:50:24.640 --> 1:50:29.200]  they take the ore from the ground they put it on a leaching pad after they pulverize the rock
[1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:33.600]  and they sprinkle cyanide over it and then they get a little bit of gold from that about three
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:40.000]  ounces per ton you know it's it's it's such a small money to mount anyways minus resources
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:47.440]  1-800-686-2237 is their number we have a lot of great buys now the market is moving i would get this
[1:50:47.440 --> 1:50:51.760]  this inventory i have before i have to buy new stuff because it will be higher we'll be back

[1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:06.560]  greg in washington greg you're online hey jason i always enjoy it when you take over the show
[1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:12.720]  you hear a nice calm voice i like that uh... what i i would like to address uh... is
[1:56:13.440 --> 1:56:17.360]  the two issues that were really being distracted from and and not addressing
[1:56:18.160 --> 1:56:22.560]  the first one and it's been on other aspects of the the radio network is
[1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:27.680]  the book they own it all including you by means of toxic currency by ronald mcdonald and and
[1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:38.480]  robert ron are you familiar with that are you there we must have you know i have no i have
[1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:43.040]  not seen the book okay what they're pointing out is that we're dealing in in the currency of the
[1:56:43.040 --> 1:56:48.400]  federal reserve note and that note itself is a lien against everything that is bought and sold
[1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:54.320]  and in that case we're being distracted from what we call dollars which is in the constitution
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:58.560]  gold a certain amount of gold and silver minted by by the government or at least weighed and
[1:56:58.560 --> 1:57:04.640]  measured by the government and where we're dealing in paper the second issue is is based on a book
[1:57:04.640 --> 1:57:12.080]  of or just covered in a book of u.s of a versus u.s by richard kegley and tj henderson and that
[1:57:12.080 --> 1:57:17.280]  says that we have voluntarily become corporate citizens you can look on your birth certificate
[1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:23.280]  your ssn card and or your driver's license it's all capital letters we're corporate citizens
[1:57:23.280 --> 1:57:30.880]  we essentially have volunteered to enter corporate status and become under admiralty and maritime
[1:57:30.880 --> 1:57:36.960]  law all right let me stop you right there greg you know we have covered common law before on this
[1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:42.160]  program on my program i encourage people to go check out america freedom to fascism which really
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:47.200]  breaks down what the federal reserve system is how it's a private organization also breaks down the
[1:57:47.200 --> 1:57:53.120]  illegality of the income tax but we have to pick and choose our battles i've seen people out there
[1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:58.720]  try to you know go by common law and say that they've done all these things and guess what they're
[1:57:58.720 --> 1:58:03.440]  still subject to the same laws that the elite impose on all of us is it a critical criminal
[1:58:03.440 --> 1:58:08.400]  system outside of constitutional government absolutely but i think the main purpose that
[1:58:08.400 --> 1:58:13.840]  discussing that is is to wake people up to that fact and the tyranny of the federal reserve that's
[1:58:13.840 --> 1:58:21.120]  why we're behind 1207 audit the fed go after them expose their lives we're gonna have gary lockman
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:26.880]  coming up right after this to discuss politics and the occult his latest book and i've got a

[1:59:00.240 --> 1:59:05.120]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[1:59:05.120 --> 1:59:10.720]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:59:10.720 --> 1:59:15.760]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[1:59:15.760 --> 1:59:20.880]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[1:59:20.880 --> 1:59:25.040]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[1:59:25.040 --> 1:59:30.400]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and

[2:00:57.280 --> 2:01:02.400]  but politics and how they intertwine well it's something that i've been interested in for a
[2:01:02.400 --> 2:01:09.360]  while um there were well there's quite a few books written about it but mostly from um the
[2:01:09.360 --> 2:01:18.480]  perspective of uh hitler and the nazis uh rather uh to me rather sensational sort of books and um
[2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:24.880]  generally the attitude towards it is that uh any sort of encounter between uh politics and
[2:01:25.440 --> 2:01:32.240]  and the occult or mysticism or the esoteric tends to be on the on the right the far right
[2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:41.120]  of the spectrum and it tends to give um esotericism or any interest in the occult or occultism
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:48.000]  a kind of bad uh a bad reputation from uh you know from from from one point of view and uh
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:52.720]  what i wanted to do was to show that uh while there is that that's certainly a part of it
[2:01:52.720 --> 2:01:59.440]  that doesn't cover all the bases uh there's actually uh a progressive uh you could call a left
[2:01:59.440 --> 2:02:08.000]  or liberal um sort of uh connection between uh politics and the occult and um i wanted to show
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:13.200]  that that was the case and and also another sort of uh thing that i wanted to point out was that
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:20.000]  both sides uh say the far left and the far right they actually come together in their detestation
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:28.400]  of modernity of the modern world both of them uh abhor modernity uh almost for the same reasons
[2:02:28.400 --> 2:02:32.240]  they're very different um approaches of how to deal with it but they they seem to me so that
[2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:39.200]  struck me as a very ironic uh uh thing well before we get into the left right and their
[2:02:39.200 --> 2:02:46.000]  different flavors of the occult you mentioned hitler and the nazis and hitler really did believe
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:52.480]  that symbols like the ss logo and the swastika which was really a sun symbol which he adopted
[2:02:52.480 --> 2:02:58.720]  and put into a white red and black color scheme did give his political power or his political
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:04.640]  party power as well as his his you know warmongering well i mean swastika had been around for quite
[2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:11.680]  some time it's an ancient ancient symbol it goes back to neolithic times uh there's cave uh paintings
[2:03:11.680 --> 2:03:17.200]  with it and cave etchings and uh there's a long-standing myth that um if it's turned in the
[2:03:17.200 --> 2:03:20.960]  clockwise direction it's good and if it's turned in the opposite i forget which it is but there's
[2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:25.840]  you know this too it turns up going both ways clockwise and anti-clockwise and the myth was
[2:03:25.840 --> 2:03:30.240]  that hitler had taken it the anti-clockwise way which was the evil way but that again that that's
[2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:38.320]  sort of a myth no i think it was very astute about uh the power that symbols and myth uh have over
[2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:43.360]  people and how they can reach down below the you know the critical conscious uh the conscious mind
[2:03:43.360 --> 2:03:49.360]  and and sort of just get you you know down in your gut and also uh into vienna uh hitler's early
[2:03:49.360 --> 2:03:54.640]  days before he became uh the chancellor of of germany and in the early thirties and he was a
[2:03:54.640 --> 2:04:02.320]  starting artist in um in vienna there was a magazine called astara if i recall correctly that was a
[2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:08.720]  anti-semitic um anti-marxist anti-democratic you know pretty much anti everything except sort of
[2:04:08.720 --> 2:04:17.760]  white um conservatives v&es um you know culture uh and it used uh swastika as its symbol so it's
[2:04:17.760 --> 2:04:22.640]  something that was around i mean you find it in a lot of different contexts and in many ways it's uh
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:29.360]  uh a sad thing that it's it's it's so completely associated with uh hitler and the nazis now that
[2:04:29.360 --> 2:04:34.880]  it's it's completely unredeemable absolutely i mean that's what everybody that i know would
[2:04:34.880 --> 2:04:39.920]  associate the swastika with a lot of people don't understand it was used by native americans and
[2:04:39.920 --> 2:04:46.320]  many other cultures again as a son said well when we come back i want to discuss the right wing
[2:04:46.320 --> 2:04:52.400]  flavor of the occult and then get into the left wing flavor but really how these people don't present
[2:04:52.400 --> 2:04:57.040]  themselves to the public as occultists and they really hide their true religion we'll be back after
[2:04:57.040 --> 2:05:03.280]  this it's the alex jones show i'm jason bermas sitting in hello folks this is alex jones and i

[2:08:18.320 --> 2:08:25.200]  being broadcast with all our great affiliates across the nation gary lachman is our guest
[2:08:25.200 --> 2:08:30.800]  his book politics in the occult the right the left and the radically unseen we just discussed
[2:08:30.800 --> 2:08:36.960]  hitler and the nazis use of the ss symbols the swastika and their belief in the occult
[2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:42.480]  let's take it to the united states not only the united states but kind of european leaders also go
[2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:49.440]  to places like the bohemian grove and really the white anglo-saxon crowd is recruited in
[2:08:49.440 --> 2:08:55.040]  colleges like yale and others with groups like book and snake and of course the infamous skull
[2:08:55.040 --> 2:09:01.600]  and bones what have you i mean you look at bohemian grove they seem to have this owl as a mascot some
[2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:07.760]  people interpreted as mo-molec others don't but they also have a buddha or a matreya figure there
[2:09:07.760 --> 2:09:13.600]  they have st john of maple knock what do you think they're doing up there in the grove well to tell
[2:09:13.600 --> 2:09:18.000]  you the truth um i know about bohemian grove i've read a bit about it but i don't really cover it
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:24.320]  in the book so it's not really my patch so um to tell you the truth i don't i haven't the slightest
[2:09:24.320 --> 2:09:28.960]  idea so would you consider but you would you consider that stuff the the right-wing aspect
[2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:34.960]  i mean that's where you know bush his father go yeah well i mean right i mean traditionally the
[2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:43.440]  right-wing aspect of um sort of politics in your cult is it's linked to tradition and it's a response
[2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:51.120]  to the rise of modern world which uh mostly means uh in the rise of democracy or the rise of some
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:10:00.800]  form of socialism of left kind of thinking um which uh generally is a form of leveling it levels out
[2:10:00.800 --> 2:10:07.120]  sort of the social hierarchies that it you know gets rid of the aristocracy it gets rid of the
[2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:12.320]  you know the monarchy it gets rid of the king the queen and all those people that are um you know
[2:10:12.320 --> 2:10:17.920]  in a in a hierarchical um higher level than than than than the common the common person
[2:10:17.920 --> 2:10:26.400]  and uh this was something that was completely uh feared by many um traditional uh thinking people
[2:10:26.400 --> 2:10:31.360]  in in in europe that's the area um uh that i i i cover in the book mostly and again as i said
[2:10:31.360 --> 2:10:36.720]  this is a response uh it even though it it's happened throughout the last you know a few
[2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:41.760]  centuries i i started in the early 1600s with the appearance of uh well the non-appearance
[2:10:41.760 --> 2:10:46.480]  actually of a group called the rose accrucian and they're an example of progressive kind of what
[2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:53.520]  we would call sort of left um um uh a cult political thinking but um with the rise of the modern world
[2:10:53.520 --> 2:10:59.760]  with the the breakdown of the hierarchy the the loss of religion as a very strong element in society
[2:11:00.720 --> 2:11:08.720]  many groups uh reacted to that and uh they reacted in the way that uh they saw different forms of
[2:11:08.720 --> 2:11:14.080]  esotericism different forms of sort of mysticism or or cult thinking this this was a place where
[2:11:14.080 --> 2:11:19.920]  that notion of tradition was still alive and it was still it was still viable and so uh they they
[2:11:19.920 --> 2:11:25.520]  they sort of took elements from that and again this is you know this this is i'm not i'm not i
[2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:29.440]  don't really do conspiracy theories and i don't really do the kind of what's going on in the
[2:11:29.440 --> 2:11:34.560]  back room sort of thing i basically looked at history upfront history that's available you know
[2:11:34.560 --> 2:11:41.360]  in books uh that you can get and and uh you can find it you can find the influence or you can find
[2:11:41.360 --> 2:11:49.360]  where people uh with a an occult bent um were involved in politics or we are a certain occultist
[2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:55.280]  there are certain people that were esoteric thinkers tried to um take their ideas and to put
[2:11:55.280 --> 2:12:01.600]  them into practice in in in politics or social theory and again this is this is a response to
[2:12:01.600 --> 2:12:06.880]  this is a response to the modern world they they they're it's a anti-gallitarian anti-democratic
[2:12:06.880 --> 2:12:14.480]  anti you know socialist or communist or anything that uh is sort of supporting the idea of getting
[2:12:14.480 --> 2:12:21.920]  rid of the hierarchy um so that's you know in many ways i you know i i i don't you know i i don't
[2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:26.000]  know if that's what's going on in the whole peeming grove or you know galling bones and all
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:29.920]  that sort of thing but i wouldn't be surprised although i would say it wouldn't necessarily
[2:12:29.920 --> 2:12:34.960]  be a religious one it would probably be more you know the economic one a financial one what are
[2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:39.280]  some of these modern examples maintain their position in power well what what are some of
[2:12:39.280 --> 2:12:44.080]  these modern examples then of what you consider the left and the occult some of the organizations
[2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:47.840]  are the people well it's not something i mean it's again it's historical if you look at somebody
[2:12:47.840 --> 2:12:53.760]  like um uh the the the the the theosophical society which was started in 1875 by helena
[2:12:53.760 --> 2:13:00.480]  petrovna belatsky this wild eccentric russian woman who uh after a crazy life you know packed with
[2:13:00.480 --> 2:13:09.040]  you know uh enough life for a dozen people wound up in in new york in 1875 um she herself was um
[2:13:10.560 --> 2:13:15.200]  it she she herself wasn't so much directly involved with this but her successor a woman
[2:13:15.200 --> 2:13:20.640]  named annie basant who was in england a major socialist uh she was a fabian they were the
[2:13:20.640 --> 2:13:28.400]  fabians were a um early socialist uh think tank more or less in in uh late 19th early 20th century
[2:13:28.400 --> 2:13:33.600]  england and annie basant was one of those she was for women's rights she was for you know free love
[2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:40.000]  she was for uh better working conditions for um working people there was a famous
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:43.520]  strike called a match girl strike that she was involved in that she was put into jail for and
[2:13:43.520 --> 2:13:51.360]  all that um she got involved with theosophy and uh really threw herself into it and theosophy as
[2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:57.280]  you probably know it gets a great deal of its philosophy its ideas from from india from from
[2:13:57.280 --> 2:14:03.280]  indian thought from to the mystic east and so she she went to india and she became actually
[2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:10.880]  you know hands-on uh involved in indian independence uh you know getting rid of the raj
[2:14:10.880 --> 2:14:17.120]  um india india for india and also uh involved with that was reintroducing to the indian people
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:21.760]  a great deal of their heritage that had been um lost while they were under the british rule things
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:27.280]  like uh the Bhagavad Gita or the Upanishads all these great works of indian hindu mysticism
[2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:32.160]  and spirituality that the indian people of the time were more or less ignorant of those because
[2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:36.000]  they've been brought up under british rule and she reintroduced that to them so they have an example
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:42.320]  of someone you know uh working for uh the national identity of of an indigenous people which is very
[2:14:42.320 --> 2:14:48.480]  progressive left sort of idea and also uh their independence so again this is something that was
[2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:54.000]  called you know really uh it was there wasn't hidden it wasn't secret it was something that was
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:58.960]  you know right up front and that even fascinates me more because i mean i i i tend not to go down
[2:14:58.960 --> 2:15:03.760]  the conspiracy theory really because it's such a can of worms you know once you open them up
[2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:09.520]  once you open that door there's lots of other doors to open and i feel you can get lost in it
[2:15:09.520 --> 2:15:14.000]  and you never quite arrive anywhere so i decided the beginning okay i'm not going to go that way
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:20.560]  but i'm just going to show you can you can trace in history where there have been um times when uh
[2:15:20.560 --> 2:15:24.400]  i keep saying a cold politics but in many ways it's you know it's a religious it's a spiritual
[2:15:24.400 --> 2:15:30.000]  it's a politics that that's motivated by sort of high ideals rather than say the utilitarian
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:34.880]  politics of you know okay economy and making sure everybody's got enough to eat and you know the
[2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:39.760]  you know the sort of more pragmatic politics that that that we you know we're more familiar with
[2:15:39.760 --> 2:15:44.560]  this a cold politics has to do with this kind of transcendental view of of human nature and how
[2:15:44.560 --> 2:15:51.120]  you know your society uh should be motivated by these high ideals and um in both sides of the
[2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:55.120]  fence both the left and the right there have been different groups who have tried to in uh in you
[2:15:55.120 --> 2:15:58.880]  know introduce that you know there's people that say like you know the states the united states
[2:15:58.880 --> 2:16:04.240]  themselves i mean i i live in london now but i you know group in the states um you know the founding
[2:16:04.240 --> 2:16:10.960]  fathers role mason's and and there was a whole masonic um set of ideas that was involved in in
[2:16:11.600 --> 2:16:16.320]  in the in the origin of the states and there's even books written about how washington dc is
[2:16:16.320 --> 2:16:21.760]  you know laid out according to these sort of astrological masonic ideas and again um it's
[2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:26.400]  true i mean the the whole idea is about the brotherhood of man a certain kind of egalitarianism
[2:16:26.880 --> 2:16:32.960]  uh a certain sense of of um you know people helping each other and and personal freedom
[2:16:32.960 --> 2:16:39.760]  and religious tolerance these were all ideas that were in the air as it were uh in let me stop
[2:16:39.760 --> 2:16:44.800]  you you keep saying you know this is all about individual uh freedoms and really the betterment
[2:16:44.800 --> 2:16:49.840]  of humanity through through this whole thing if that is the case then why don't these people come
[2:16:49.840 --> 2:16:55.120]  out as a cultist why is it that they pose as christian conservatives they they are out i'm
[2:16:55.120 --> 2:16:59.280]  saying that i mean i'm i'm sure other books probably deal with the guys in the back room
[2:16:59.280 --> 2:17:02.960]  you know with the shape you keep saying conspire hold on me so let me stop you for a second let me
[2:17:02.960 --> 2:17:08.240]  let me let me stop you because you keep saying conspiracy theories and people in the back room
[2:17:08.240 --> 2:17:13.680]  you know i'm holding their own annals i can name the members i mean they've taken pictures with the
[2:17:13.680 --> 2:17:19.200]  organization they're openly members people like newt gingrich who propose themselves as christian
[2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:24.800]  conservatives are members of the occult i'm sure you've come across uh dozens if not hundreds of
[2:17:24.800 --> 2:17:29.200]  names what do you mean by members of the occult you call well don't you wouldn't you consider hold on hold
[2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:35.760]  on hold on yeah but wouldn't you consider a society that openly does rituals to their deity and owl
[2:17:35.760 --> 2:17:40.640]  and again this is inscribed as i said and i i basically i said this when your producer got
[2:17:40.640 --> 2:17:45.200]  in touch with me i said i don't do conspiracy theories but you keep saying hold on you keep
[2:17:45.200 --> 2:17:49.360]  saying conspiracy theory hold on hold on you keep saying conspiracy theory gary you keep saying
[2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:54.560]  conspiracy theory i'm showing their pictures in their own books with their own words so where
[2:17:54.560 --> 2:17:58.960]  is that but where is the conspiracy theory in that i mean you turn to black i don't know how
[2:17:58.960 --> 2:18:03.360]  that's different than you quoting blotsky well look i'm not gonna have a shouting that twisted
[2:18:03.360 --> 2:18:08.320]  you know i'm i'm giving up an evening to do this you know i'm happy to watch the news uh the thing
[2:18:08.320 --> 2:18:13.280]  is that i i don't know anything about it so you can ask me questions about them and i can't give
[2:18:13.280 --> 2:18:17.600]  you an intelligent but you're you're saying that all these people are openly occultists if you read
[2:18:17.600 --> 2:18:21.200]  the book if you look at the book you know what i talked about and i'm happy to talk about well i
[2:18:21.200 --> 2:18:25.440]  would be happy to read the book i'm sorry i'm substituting on the show today and i just got
[2:18:25.440 --> 2:18:28.800]  thrown you i didn't realize that so i mean the book i'm happy to talk about anything in the book
[2:18:28.800 --> 2:18:32.240]  but i don't want to talk about something i don't know anything about all right yeah but again you're
[2:18:32.240 --> 2:18:36.240]  saying that all these people are out in the open isn't hold on you're saying that all these people
[2:18:36.960 --> 2:18:41.680]  but but gary you're you're saying in your own words that all these people are out in the open
[2:18:41.680 --> 2:18:46.880]  when the very hold on when the very meaning of the term occult is hidden is it not it's hidden but
[2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:52.320]  it's hidden in the same way that uh you know when when when the when the earth passes between um
[2:18:53.200 --> 2:18:58.800]  the rays of the sun and the moon uh the moon is eclipsed it's it's it's occluded so i mean you
[2:18:58.800 --> 2:19:03.840]  could take you could you could take out any you know book on you know the history of of the
[2:19:03.840 --> 2:19:09.360]  office and you can read or any biography of any basant and you'll you'll find this out about her
[2:19:09.360 --> 2:19:15.920]  just like uh you can find out about um someone like uh someone named julius ebbola who was an italian
[2:19:15.920 --> 2:19:25.040]  an occultist and as a terrorist in the uh 20s 30s and 40s uh who uh wrote books about a variety of
[2:19:25.040 --> 2:19:31.600]  different esoteric ideas and he tried to influence first miscellany and and then hitler and he had
[2:19:31.600 --> 2:19:37.280]  certain ideas about the spiritual kind of elite and a spiritual aristocracy and how society should
[2:19:37.280 --> 2:19:41.760]  be based on that and so on and so on so he's he's out he's out in the open i mean these these things
[2:19:41.760 --> 2:19:45.600]  are there i i just i mean the sense out in the open is that you do the research you'll you'll find
[2:19:45.600 --> 2:19:49.840]  well you know i'm pretty well versed in people like manly p hall that have written about this
[2:19:49.840 --> 2:19:54.160]  nicholas roerich they are definitely out in the open but i find more often than not those
[2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:59.040]  involved in the modern occult are not so i want to get into what you think their end game is after

[2:24:21.120 --> 2:24:25.840]  i am jason bermus sitting in the websites our info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv
[2:24:25.840 --> 2:24:30.000]  our guest is gary lockman he's the author of politics and the occult the right the left and
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:37.280]  the radically unseen i guess i want to ask you gary you keep talking about a progressive elite
[2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:41.600]  that are into the occult if they get their way what does the world look like what are they working
[2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:53.280]  towards i give a variety of different examples of a more left oriented or progressive uh
[2:24:53.280 --> 2:24:57.600]  interest in the occult that that was you know linked up with politics and i gave you one there
[2:24:57.600 --> 2:25:02.240]  is any but on to it yeah but in the beginning you said me i'm your question sure maybe one
[2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:06.960]  any any but thought he was involved in being independent uh it's it's a historical book it's
[2:25:06.960 --> 2:25:11.440]  about it's about history i say i start in the 1600s i go up to you know just sort of i mean the last
[2:25:11.440 --> 2:25:16.640]  people i talk about are the you know the christian fundamentalist involved in the left behind series
[2:25:16.640 --> 2:25:21.040]  of okay in the states that are big you know best dollars and all that but um you know if you look
[2:25:21.040 --> 2:25:28.560]  at something like um early 20th century england where i just talked about the baby and you had
[2:25:28.560 --> 2:25:34.720]  you had you had a whole just before world war one you had a whole slew of sort of ideas that would
[2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:39.520]  later become you know rediscovered in the 1960s which when everybody thinks you know mysticism
[2:25:39.520 --> 2:25:45.040]  and yoga and uh you know a variety of different kind of uh occult or esoteric practices were
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:49.440]  discovered i mean people were doing those uh in the 19th century they were doing them in the early
[2:25:49.440 --> 2:25:53.280]  20th century but when they were doing early 20th century especially here in england you know when
[2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:58.160]  living out they were associated with these very progressive ideas like free love was one of them
[2:25:58.160 --> 2:26:07.040]  um wide education um religious tolerance uh social tolerance uh a breakdown of the class system
[2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:12.400]  and and and but if you want to go to certain i mean uh those people involved that they there
[2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:17.120]  wasn't like one group who had an agenda to go in you know sort of you know pursue in politics but
[2:26:17.120 --> 2:26:24.320]  if you go earlier say um in the late 18th century which is sort of the heyday of a freemasonry uh
[2:26:24.320 --> 2:26:30.720]  when um especially in in central central europe in in the german speaking countries you you had
[2:26:30.720 --> 2:26:34.480]  this is you know with the luminati come out of that time especially to do with the film with
[2:26:34.480 --> 2:26:41.120]  tom hanks um but um you have you have famous people like moatstar you have people like the
[2:26:41.120 --> 2:26:48.640]  german poet dirta and many other very influential thinkers and writers who were really involved
[2:26:48.640 --> 2:26:56.400]  in this masonic notion of again of of religious tolerance uh racial tolerance of uh sexual
[2:26:56.400 --> 2:27:01.360]  tolerance they were uh that's when you started to have masonic groups that allowed women in
[2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:06.320]  they allowed jew jews and christians who'd sit side by side at these masonic meetings and there
[2:27:06.320 --> 2:27:12.320]  was an idea that if these these notions of these ideas of the brotherhood of man and and this kind
[2:27:12.320 --> 2:27:17.440]  of uh you know individual freedom and and social tolerance were they to spread there would be a
[2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:23.920]  new age um in in europe now unfortunately what happened is a lot of those ideas got fed into
[2:27:23.920 --> 2:27:30.960]  a lot of the radical groups involved um at the beginning of the french revolution and uh it
[2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:35.680]  went completely out the window you know it went from this fantastic dawn of a new age to you know
[2:27:35.680 --> 2:27:39.520]  to the terror when you know the you know people getting you know their heads chopped off left
[2:27:39.520 --> 2:27:44.400]  and right all over paris and all those hopes were dashed they they they did this kind of people
[2:27:44.400 --> 2:27:48.160]  just they just said oh this is turned into a nightmare and then out of it you get you get
[2:27:48.160 --> 2:27:54.800]  you get a new right wing uh sort of masonic um sensibility coming up as a reaction to sort of
[2:27:54.800 --> 2:28:01.040]  you know the the the terror as a reaction to the revolutionary sensibility so i i i i mean
[2:28:01.040 --> 2:28:06.960]  and i if i wanted to pocket it in two different ways i would say the progressive people uh that
[2:28:06.960 --> 2:28:10.560]  you know that are brought as a terrific ideas into politics they're trying they they want to
[2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:16.320]  do basically with what they'd like to do is create the kind of as they say socially religious
[2:28:17.200 --> 2:28:20.960]  gender tolerant society that we give a lot of mouth you know we give a lot of lip service
[2:28:20.960 --> 2:28:25.200]  to these days but you know the pluralistic we only have about 90 seconds left gary in the
[2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:31.600]  beginning of the interview you said that the left and the right seem to converge on this same idea
[2:28:31.600 --> 2:28:35.520]  is this the one that you're you're talking about basically left and right they come together because
[2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:42.640]  they both hate the modern world they both find them the modern world um uh evil for for for
[2:28:42.640 --> 2:28:46.800]  different reasons uh but are they pushing for different things as i'm asking from the right
[2:28:46.800 --> 2:28:51.520]  point of view it's it's the complete loss of tradition it's the it's the leveling of society
[2:28:51.520 --> 2:28:55.920]  it's the whole loss of any kind of hierarchy it's the loss of any kind of order of rank
[2:28:55.920 --> 2:29:01.840]  where anything goes you know uh and from the left position it it's um the rise of capitalism
[2:29:01.840 --> 2:29:08.080]  it's the rise of laissez-faire it's the rise of um um you know basically every man out for himself
[2:29:08.640 --> 2:29:15.440]  um which you know uh and the the duping of of of the of the masses through things like the culture
[2:29:15.440 --> 2:29:19.680]  industry and you know television and popular entertainment and all that sort of thing so
[2:29:19.680 --> 2:29:25.920]  both of them both both sides um gary gary let me let me just stop you just for a second one last

[2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:46.960]  admitted to it but he thinks it's all a good thing and he's a philosopher apparently i wouldn't be

[2:36:40.640 --> 2:36:45.440]  fact that they are in the occult that they do want one world government that they do want to call
[2:36:45.440 --> 2:36:51.600]  a massive percentage of us that they do want to tax us for breathing with a carbon tax that they
[2:36:51.600 --> 2:37:01.040]  have been doing this openly openly in government documents in books in speeches for well over
[2:37:01.040 --> 2:37:08.720]  a hundred years hitler talked about a new world order george bush senior talked about a new world
[2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:15.600]  order gordon brown and tony blair talked about a new world order all right i said i take your calls
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:19.840]  let's jump to the callers they've been holding a long time let's go to randy in georgia randy your
[2:37:19.840 --> 2:37:30.640]  line hi jason how are you doing i'm good um well actually i am um seven months pregnant and um i know

[2:37:39.440 --> 2:37:46.320]  so um i decided to you know because i never read over like the privacy practices and all those things
[2:37:46.320 --> 2:37:50.880]  so i decided to read it this time because now they're doing the research like we've done
[2:37:50.880 --> 2:37:55.840]  dr sherry tim penny and you know listening in about the vaccines and all those other things
[2:37:55.840 --> 2:38:01.200]  so i really don't want to get my second child vaccinated so um but i was reading in the party
[2:38:01.200 --> 2:38:08.800]  practices basically what they're saying is um that they have from a to zero and the call
[2:38:08.800 --> 2:38:14.800]  i mean a to zero a to o in their policies that they can send out your information without even
[2:38:14.800 --> 2:38:20.000]  your consent so and i just thought that was really funny and i called up to the hospital
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:26.640]  to see if i can get a waiver i got i was um got to run around like eight times and still
[2:38:26.640 --> 2:38:32.480]  haven't been able to talk to anybody and um i just thought that was pretty interesting well they do
[2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:36.800]  this across the board randy i mean you look at australia they had to come clean a couple years
[2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:42.800]  ago that they had been you know database and everybody's dna since the 70s you look at the
[2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:46.960]  police in this country you're supposed to give up your fingerprints but if you're not convicted
[2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:51.360]  of anything you're supposed to get those back those are in the database somewhere they openly
[2:38:51.360 --> 2:38:56.160]  want to create a medical database under this health care bill they're coming for you and
[2:38:56.160 --> 2:39:01.040]  they will give you the run around they don't want you to have any kind of personal privacy they
[2:39:01.040 --> 2:39:04.400]  they want to take your humanity away from you i thank you for the call let's jump to our next
[2:39:04.400 --> 2:39:09.440]  caller let's go to chris in florida chris you're on the line well jason this climate
[2:39:09.440 --> 2:39:15.120]  get being investigated by penn state uh... it's one of the university that's involved with the
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:20.160]  department of energy the atmospheric science program just google that and you'll see that uh
[2:39:20.160 --> 2:39:25.120]  they last updated in november 12th as it says in the very first paragraph up top that their primary
[2:39:25.120 --> 2:39:33.120]  goal is the quote aerosol radiative forcing of the climate and so uh and that's a quote and so penn
[2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:37.920]  state is among the university is involved in contracting the department of energy to cause
[2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:42.800]  global warming and counteract the cooling and uh that article i'm the article they're on prison
[2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:46.960]  planted i know so chris what are you what are you saying you think that this penn state investigation
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:51.760]  is going to be a show trial that in fact this investigation is going to be a whitewash and
[2:39:51.760 --> 2:39:54.720]  it's actually going to prove the opposite they're going to try to prove the opposite so they can
[2:39:54.720 --> 2:40:00.800]  maintain their funding and the global warming fraud well not if we keep these academics on
[2:40:00.800 --> 2:40:05.840]  the run i mean that's it's great news that they're on their toes now and these witch hunters of
[2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:10.880]  humanity are in retreat but uh you know where the climate gate and the troop escalations and more
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:15.600]  war and murder they're the ones who are threatening to make this world even even more of a hell and
[2:40:15.600 --> 2:40:21.680]  you know this it's like another as they admit another religion they're seeking to uh to recruit
[2:40:21.680 --> 2:40:27.760]  those who are going to be feel guilty for for not obeying a penalty of burning and their
[2:40:27.760 --> 2:40:32.400]  planet's going to be turned into a hell and that's what they'll do and if they don't get their way so
[2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:36.960]  you know we got them on the run right now and that's the way we got to keep them and exposing
[2:40:36.960 --> 2:40:41.600]  these facts uh you know bringing the false left and false right to walk through these gates off
[2:40:41.600 --> 2:40:46.800]  the reservation and maybe we'll accomplish something absolutely chris we do have to keep them
[2:40:46.800 --> 2:40:50.960]  true to their word we have to demand not only an investigation but a prosecution
[2:40:50.960 --> 2:40:56.080]  and then punishment as well i appreciate the phone call let's go to chris in i'd hope chris are online
[2:40:56.640 --> 2:41:01.360]  jason uh i just want to say thanks i appreciate everything you and alex are doing for the freedom
[2:41:01.360 --> 2:41:08.560]  front and uh we will win this fight um i just wanted back to what your guest was talking about uh
[2:41:09.200 --> 2:41:12.080]  you know you guys call it the occult and everything i mean why don't you just
[2:41:12.560 --> 2:41:17.120]  say what these people are they're luciferian worshipers you know but that doesn't fit into
[2:41:17.120 --> 2:41:21.920]  his paradigm you know he'll never mention that a lot of these quote unquote paganists
[2:41:21.920 --> 2:41:27.360]  and these occultists even though occult obviously means hidden knowledge would have anything to do
[2:41:27.360 --> 2:41:33.040]  with lucifer unless lucifer is being portrayed as the light and knowledge and then maybe he would
[2:41:33.040 --> 2:41:40.080]  talk about it but not as an entity that is encouraging people to do as thou wilt well uh
[2:41:40.080 --> 2:41:43.920]  you know i like what he said where you know people obviously don't like to talk about things that
[2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:49.040]  they don't know about so you know that's pretty open minded but anyway you know there's a i've
[2:41:49.040 --> 2:41:54.720]  done research on this started with the n w o and the illuminati and you know one world government
[2:41:54.720 --> 2:42:00.480]  it led me to the occult side and and all that in the free mason's and it's just confusing to anyone
[2:42:00.480 --> 2:42:06.480]  who tries to to pick pick apart the pieces and you know i encourage people to go check out the book
[2:42:07.040 --> 2:42:13.360]  uh called uh which one is it we carry it here it's von john robison and it really tells an
[2:42:13.360 --> 2:42:20.400]  insider's view of the illuminati he's an unapologetic mason but he sees this group infiltrating the
[2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:26.800]  masonic lodges in europe and really blows the lid off of wisopt and his sect of the illuminati we
[2:42:26.800 --> 2:42:32.000]  carry it over here at info wars dot com go check it out it's by john robison i thank you for the
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:35.680]  call i want to shift gears for a moment here we'll go back to your calls in a moment we have
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:41.280]  kathryn austin fits coming up in the final hour to discuss the economy but i want to show these
[2:42:41.280 --> 2:42:48.880]  clips off of the cbc's fifth estate regarding really what was the fairest mainstream piece
[2:42:48.880 --> 2:42:55.920]  the fairest mainstream piece for 911 truth yet and then show you some documents further debunking
[2:42:55.920 --> 2:43:01.920]  people like jimmy mags entertainment weekly superstar turned popular mechanics editor
[2:43:02.880 --> 2:43:08.960]  being proven wrong again and again and again and again so if we could start off with that that
[2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:13.360]  clip where we have the two clips it starts at the one minute marker and then the eight minute marker
[2:43:13.360 --> 2:43:19.440]  we've got john farmer admitting admitting that the 911 commission was a whitewash we've got
[2:43:19.440 --> 2:43:25.200]  jimmy mags being called out on the fact that air defense does train for hijackings and much more
[2:43:25.200 --> 2:43:33.600]  so let's hit the clip and senior counsel john farmer established the timeline that day he says
[2:43:33.600 --> 2:43:39.120]  by misleading the public to hide incompetence on september 11th the u.s. government unwittingly
[2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:46.080]  triggered the truth movements i tell you where i have a degree of empathy and that is i think when
[2:43:46.080 --> 2:43:50.960]  you have a situation as we had here where the where the official government version of what
[2:43:50.960 --> 2:43:57.600]  happened doesn't square with reality and and leaves people scratching their heads then people's
[2:43:57.600 --> 2:44:02.080]  minds were run crazy all right let's stop it right there in degrees varying degrees and they
[2:44:02.080 --> 2:44:06.640]  start saying how controlled demolition is not a possibility now let's focus on what he did just
[2:44:06.640 --> 2:44:15.440]  say he just said that the official government version of 911 does not square with reality
[2:44:15.440 --> 2:44:21.920]  is it time for a new investigation yet is it time for the mainstream media to stop slandering 911
[2:44:21.920 --> 2:44:28.640]  truth yet when john farmer the man who put together the timeline admits it's a lie it's a whitewash
[2:44:28.640 --> 2:44:35.200]  we played segments of fabled enemies my latest film on 911 on the sunday show where max cleland
[2:44:35.200 --> 2:44:42.000]  was forced to resign he had to resign because they wouldn't even let him see the documents this was a
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:48.800]  commissioner on the 911 report he had to leave john farmer admits it it's a lie the two co-chairs
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:54.000]  as they laugh also in fabled enemies thomas keen and lee hamilton write a book together called
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:59.840]  without precedent where they talk about indictments of the fbi and others and they're joking about
[2:44:59.840 --> 2:45:05.280]  it it's hilarious oh yeah of course they lied to us all right let's go to this next clip in in that
[2:45:05.280 --> 2:45:10.000]  one right there can we uh can we hit that next clip this is the cbc bob mcqueen who does a lot
[2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:15.120]  of journalism here in the united states did a really fair piece called the unofficial story
[2:45:15.120 --> 2:45:21.680]  so check this out cell phone or seatback phone he went back and forth but he's you guys are a
[2:45:21.680 --> 2:45:26.160]  minute off it's a minute before that it's eight it's eight minutes eight minutes sorry about
[2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:30.800]  that folks that's uh that right there he's describing the barba olson phone calls now
[2:45:30.800 --> 2:45:36.000]  what do we know about the barba olson phone calls barba olson was a commentator on cnn
[2:45:36.720 --> 2:45:40.480]  she supposedly called her husband who was the solicitor general at the time
[2:45:40.480 --> 2:45:46.480]  twice from her cell phone where she was the one that talked about hijackers with box cutters
[2:45:46.480 --> 2:45:53.520]  that's where the only information comes out so let's hit the clip uh oh okay now does he
[2:45:53.520 --> 2:45:58.720]  usually say that to his mother probably not according to duny it was a slip up and clear
[2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:04.560]  proof the call wasn't from her son have you been in touch with his mother no her name is alice
[2:46:04.560 --> 2:46:11.200]  hoaglin and she says in fact that was one of the things that they would do on the phone just kidding
[2:46:11.200 --> 2:46:15.280]  because he was the up and coming young businessman and they called her she says
[2:46:16.480 --> 2:46:20.240]  that's the way he sometimes introduced himself well then that just means that they've done a
[2:46:20.240 --> 2:46:25.920]  better job but here too there are unanswered questions for instance what's perhaps the most
[2:46:25.920 --> 2:46:32.160]  famous call that day from television commentator barba olson on board american flight 77 headed to
[2:46:32.160 --> 2:46:40.880]  the pentagon to her husband ted olson then solicitor general of the us he told cnn that she
[2:46:40.880 --> 2:46:48.320]  had called him that morning from flight 77 called him twice talked to him for about a minute each
[2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:54.960]  time he was uncertain whether his cell phone or seatback phone he went back and forth but
[2:46:54.960 --> 2:47:01.280]  he said she reported that there were hijackers on the plane and uh they were armed with knives and
[2:47:02.160 --> 2:47:10.640]  box cuts the only reported call that mentioned box cutters so that shows you how important these
[2:47:10.640 --> 2:47:17.520]  calls from barba olson were because everybody knows the hijackers had box cutters all right
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:22.000]  let's stop it right there unresolved issue you know he looks at it and he says well that's true
[2:47:22.640 --> 2:47:27.600]  that's true she never did make those calls in fact play it right from there show him right now
[2:47:27.600 --> 2:47:31.200]  again the fbi confirms those calls were never made hit it
[2:47:34.480 --> 2:47:40.480]  can we hit that spot ted olson told the fbi his wife phoned twice that morning calls lasting
[2:47:40.480 --> 2:47:47.200]  about a minute a piece but in a 9-11 court case fbi evidence was that barba olson attempted
[2:47:47.200 --> 2:47:54.400]  just one phone call from flight 77 which lasted zero seconds you've only got two choices either
[2:47:55.600 --> 2:48:02.400]  ted olson was duped by fake calls or he just made it up he lied either way
[2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:11.680]  the official story is based on a lie and thus far we have been unable to get a single newspaper or
[2:48:11.680 --> 2:48:21.200]  magazine or tv station in the united states to report this which the fbi reported in 2006
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:25.520]  all right let's pull that clip now the next point we're going to be making we're going to
[2:48:25.520 --> 2:48:29.760]  show you jim mags of popular mechanics all the quote unquote debunkers are those who
[2:48:29.760 --> 2:48:35.360]  refuse to look at 9 11 truth always cite popular mechanics debunked that years ago it doesn't
[2:48:35.360 --> 2:48:41.600]  matter if i went on national radio and television and debated the popular mechanics guys on the
[2:48:41.600 --> 2:48:49.040]  fifth anniversary of 9 11 own them for an hour disproved their lies they're sticking to their
[2:48:49.040 --> 2:48:53.280]  stories they're going to continue with their propaganda in fact i was supposed to be on
[2:48:53.280 --> 2:48:58.800]  later that day against them on glenn beck we've been booked for over two weeks of course we got
[2:48:58.800 --> 2:49:04.880]  canceled and glenn beck let jim mags propagate his lies so let's go to this portion of the clip
[2:49:04.880 --> 2:49:12.000]  from the cbc with popular mechanics and jim mags but nothing more daunting than 9 11 and
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:21.200]  questions like where was the air force it is hard for mere layman to understand how the biggest
[2:49:21.920 --> 2:49:29.280]  most extensive military in the world could not have got fighters in the air that morning faster
[2:49:29.280 --> 2:49:35.200]  than it did you know it's really interesting the conspiracy theorist one of the very common mistakes
[2:49:35.200 --> 2:49:41.040]  they make is what i call the myth of hyper competence they've seen too many movies they have this idea
[2:49:41.040 --> 2:49:45.760]  that the minute a plane goes off course three you know fighter jets are scrambled on its tail
[2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:50.160]  within seconds it doesn't actually work that way they're assuming that the air defenses were competent
[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:54.960]  to fight this kind of threat they weren't they should have been better prepared for it they should
[2:49:54.960 --> 2:49:59.680]  have thought about it they should have trained for it but they do train for it that's all that's
[2:49:59.680 --> 2:50:06.400]  all they train for not for planes originating inside the us the air defense system was set up
[2:50:06.400 --> 2:50:11.280]  for outside threats plane coming planes or missiles or other things coming in from overseas
[2:50:11.280 --> 2:50:15.440]  all right let's just stop them right there bob mcqueen should have stopped him and said that
[2:50:15.440 --> 2:50:20.800]  is a lie in my hands and hopefully you can zoom in on the document cam in the final moments of
[2:50:20.800 --> 2:50:27.840]  this segment you can see clearly that on 10 21 2000 they had an inside hijacking it's right there
[2:50:28.480 --> 2:50:34.720]  amalgam Virgo had an inside hijacking right there these aren't outside threats these originated
[2:50:34.720 --> 2:50:39.840]  in our country yet another lie from popular mechanics doesn't matter that they have the drill
[2:50:39.840 --> 2:50:46.800]  amalgam Virgo with bin laden on the cover and they're running a suicide mission to ram that plane
[2:50:46.800 --> 2:50:51.040]  into the capitol building we'll be back after this it's the alex joneshow alex out on the

[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:23.840]  in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us
[2:52:23.840 --> 2:52:29.520]  as american citizens to pay attention full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[2:52:29.520 --> 2:52:35.520]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing

[2:52:58.240 --> 2:53:04.400]  at prison planet dot tv hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now
[2:53:04.400 --> 2:53:09.120]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a
[2:53:09.120 --> 2:53:14.000]  real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:17.760]  have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[2:53:17.760 --> 2:53:22.560]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[2:53:22.560 --> 2:53:28.640]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of
[2:53:28.640 --> 2:53:33.200]  nutrient dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[2:53:33.200 --> 2:53:38.960]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden
[2:53:38.960 --> 2:53:44.880]  so visit them today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give them a
[2:53:44.880 --> 2:53:51.440]  call at eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five that's eight seven seven three two seven
[2:53:51.440 --> 2:53:57.920]  zero three six five remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[2:53:57.920 --> 2:54:10.160]  this is alex jones for survival seed bank dot com finishing up on the nine eleven points i just
[2:54:10.160 --> 2:54:16.000]  want to point out once again as these guys almost five years ago now set out to quote
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:24.400]  unquote debunk nine eleven truth their lies are stale and unproven we look at this document from
[2:54:24.400 --> 2:54:31.440]  team eight of the fbi and you can clearly see that we drilled inside hijackings hitting inside
[2:54:31.440 --> 2:54:37.680]  targets with suicide missions then on the day before nine eleven and the day before that
[2:54:37.680 --> 2:54:43.600]  they're running hijackings out of new york city it's the alex joneshow i'm jason bermas sitting in
[2:54:43.600 --> 2:54:48.880]  i also want to mention that if you don't think you were track traced and database prior to nine
[2:54:48.880 --> 2:54:57.120]  eleven prior to nine eleven how about wiki leaks releasing all sorts of pager and cell phone documents
[2:54:57.120 --> 2:55:06.400]  from text messages on from the morning nine eleven itself three a.m to three a.m 24 hours of texts
[2:55:06.400 --> 2:55:12.640]  that again predate the supposed police state that was brought in via the patriot act via the military
[2:55:12.640 --> 2:55:21.120]  commissions act via the lies and the pretext of nine eleven yet somehow all of these private emails
[2:55:21.120 --> 2:55:27.680]  texts and pager data are available how would that be possible without some kind of a tracking
[2:55:27.680 --> 2:55:34.720]  tracing and database system being set up before nine eleven now congress may actually probe over
[2:55:34.720 --> 2:55:40.080]  this wiki leaks real release because they know that it may hurt them all right let's take a couple
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:45.040]  other callers then we have kathryn austin fits on the program for an entire hour to discuss
[2:55:46.240 --> 2:55:51.920]  the global economic meltdown i mean it is here full force gold hitting record prices today go to
[2:55:51.920 --> 2:55:57.280]  mitus resources dot com right now before it's too late it's over twelve hundred dollars
[2:55:57.280 --> 2:56:03.360]  an ounce folks only twelve months ago it sat around eight hundred i urged my stepfather
[2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:08.160]  and my mother to get into gold i said this is the one investment that you can count on
[2:56:08.160 --> 2:56:14.160]  it all right let's go to steven in texas steven you're online yeah hey good afternoon jason
[2:56:14.160 --> 2:56:20.000]  hey uh aren't you basking in the global warming today yeah it's so warm here in texas is actually
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:25.280]  cool enough it's around 45 50 degrees so it's not it's it's still quite a step up from new york
[2:56:25.280 --> 2:56:30.640]  but let's face it steven the documents show it they lied we have the lead scientists stepping
[2:56:30.640 --> 2:56:35.680]  down we have investigations going on at penn state and a possible congressional investigation
[2:56:35.680 --> 2:56:43.680]  being proposed by james enhoff asking barbara boxer who is a total globalist and an unapologetic
[2:56:43.680 --> 2:56:49.120]  you know climate change promoter we're the evil ones let's see if she does it let's see if she
[2:56:49.120 --> 2:56:54.240]  steps up to her up to the plate what we need to do is focus on going after our state officials
[2:56:54.240 --> 2:56:58.720]  our federal representatives and saying we're not going to stand for it the lie has been exposed
[2:56:59.840 --> 2:57:04.640]  yeah i just wanted to follow up on what i called you by you're on your show the other day uh the
[2:57:04.640 --> 2:57:11.040]  sunday evening uh i did have a confirmed yeah i was terminated by that one insurance company
[2:57:11.040 --> 2:57:17.760]  because of the email i sent to this customer about obama uh you know i don't know what uh
[2:57:17.760 --> 2:57:22.480]  you know that has to do with business since i never said anything about business but you
[2:57:22.480 --> 2:57:28.480]  know that's the way it is uh the odd thing is remember i brought up about how uh the federal
[2:57:28.480 --> 2:57:35.200]  reserve board and the u.s treasury are overseeing the anti-money money laundering laws mm-hmm well
[2:57:35.200 --> 2:57:41.440]  the thing is this is tied into drug running now think about this who's the number one importer
[2:57:41.440 --> 2:57:48.720]  of drugs into the united states unfortunately it's our own shadow government apparatus as exposed
[2:57:48.720 --> 2:57:55.840]  in the iran contra scandal and as proven today as we give warlord and karzai's brother millions of
[2:57:55.840 --> 2:58:02.320]  dollars over the last eight years to support the opium trade and that here the same shadow
[2:58:02.320 --> 2:58:07.360]  government is saying we're going to go after the people that are running the drugs yeah right
[2:58:07.920 --> 2:58:13.120]  it's absolutely laughable steven i thank you for the call again we have kathryn austin fits
[2:58:13.120 --> 2:58:18.320]  coming on i know a lot of you are excited out there got a lot of emails a lot of phone calls

[2:58:58.960 --> 2:59:04.000]  are now available from solutions from science in toms in illinois these emergency backup systems
[2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:09.120]  provide lifesaving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator
[2:59:09.120 --> 2:59:14.560]  runs quietly emits no fumes and produces electricity for free it's like having an electric power plant
[2:59:14.560 --> 2:59:20.640]  running quietly in your own home run some pumps shortwave radios computers and even keep food from
[2:59:20.640 --> 2:59:25.760]  spoiling whether it's hurricanes ice storms brownouts or blackouts you'll never have to

[2:59:31.120 --> 2:59:37.360]  power generator from solutions from science go to my solar backup dot com and get off the grid
[2:59:37.360 --> 2:59:50.320]  today that's my solar backup dot com or call 877-327-0365 877-327-0365 don't wait call today

[3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:17.600]  we are back at the alex jones show alex out on the simon in dallas i'm jason bermas sitting in
[3:00:17.600 --> 3:00:23.360]  and we are now joined by katherine austin fits oh no we don't have her on yet
[3:00:24.800 --> 3:00:31.760]  all right she'll be on in just a moment she is the founder and managing member of solari investment
[3:00:31.760 --> 3:00:39.200]  advisories llc she is a former assistant secretary of housing for the federal housing commissioner
[3:00:39.200 --> 3:00:44.240]  under the first bush administration she was the president of the hamilton securities group investment
[3:00:44.240 --> 3:00:51.200]  bank and financial software developer and a wall street insider so we are going to get her take
[3:00:51.200 --> 3:00:58.640]  on the devaluing dollar on gold hitting a record high on what's really going on in dubai
[3:01:00.480 --> 3:01:05.600]  and how this is going to affect us not only in the united states but globally how are you katherine
[3:01:05.600 --> 3:01:13.440]  hi i'm fine so let's just get right into it we're seeing record numbers for gold today the dollar
[3:01:13.440 --> 3:01:20.400]  continues to decline and we're talking bailouts in dubai what does this all mean for us here at home
[3:01:21.440 --> 3:01:27.040]  well what it means is um our expenses are going to rise and our income is going to fall
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:35.760]  it's that simple and and we're going through a structural change economically as a society
[3:01:35.760 --> 3:01:46.080]  we have for the last 15 to 20 years moved abroad many of the high paying uh manufacturing and other
[3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:53.520]  jobs and done it in a way that significantly weakened the unions and and anything that would
[3:01:53.520 --> 3:01:59.440]  protect the value of labor so we're watching a fundamental shift between the value of labor
[3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:06.080]  and the value of capital worldwide and um it's it's an integral part of the way that globalization
[3:02:06.080 --> 3:02:15.520]  is being achieved and so we're just the the round with dubai is sort of the latest um the latest
[3:02:15.520 --> 3:02:22.320]  sort of crisis does your related to what happens when you print lots and lots of of financial
[3:02:22.320 --> 3:02:29.600]  paper whether it's currency or bonds or debt securities but you don't uh you don't build
[3:02:29.600 --> 3:02:36.400]  up an equivalent amount of real wealth in the real economy so we're watching a a back and
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:41.680]  forth between all the paper that we've printed and the bubbles that we've engineered globally
[3:02:42.320 --> 3:02:47.120]  and the real economy and and the precious metals is really just the real economy saying
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:53.200]  hey wait a minute we don't want your paper we're worth a lot more in terms of your paper and and
[3:02:53.200 --> 3:02:58.720]  the challenge for many of us is where many of us are just holding the paper well you just discussed
[3:02:58.720 --> 3:03:05.280]  briefly how this country has essentially been gutted from making anything we don't really have
[3:03:05.280 --> 3:03:10.720]  an industry that creates and exports anything in fact i think our leading export at this point
[3:03:10.720 --> 3:03:16.480]  is garbage ideas and promises that really aren't there i mean how did this happen how did we
[3:03:16.480 --> 3:03:25.440]  allow ourselves to stop manufacturing any physical materials whatsoever well in the 1990s we
[3:03:25.440 --> 3:03:33.600]  implemented uh the gap urogui round and created in 1995 the wto the world trade organization
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:41.440]  which radically changed the rules you know it's like any any game when you blow whistle and change
[3:03:41.440 --> 3:03:46.800]  all the rules the whole game changes and what the what the world trade organization in the
[3:03:46.800 --> 3:03:56.480]  gat round set is we are now free to move capital in and out of any place and uh and basically shift
[3:03:56.480 --> 3:04:03.920]  jobs locally uh globally in a way where we can you know play labor off against each other around
[3:04:03.920 --> 3:04:08.960]  the world and that's happening at the same time when you're instituting lots of new powerful
[3:04:08.960 --> 3:04:14.160]  technology because a lot of this is made possible by telecommunications and satellite technology
[3:04:14.160 --> 3:04:21.840]  and digital technology um you're you're instituting it where you're it's possible to radically reduce
[3:04:21.840 --> 3:04:28.080]  the number of people you need to do manufacturing so literally we're seeing new plans come up around
[3:04:28.080 --> 3:04:33.680]  the world where everything is done by robotics and computers and you need very few people or once
[3:04:33.680 --> 3:04:40.880]  you needed 2000 people to do everything you need to so so part of this is simply um who gets the
[3:04:40.880 --> 3:04:46.480]  blessings of new technology and what we're saying is that's gonna we're gonna take all those blessings
[3:04:46.480 --> 3:04:51.920]  and productivity and centralize it into the wealth of the few and and pull it out of the the well
[3:04:51.920 --> 3:04:56.880]  being of the many it's the alex jones so we'll be back after this with catherine austin fits

[3:08:23.680 --> 3:08:28.720]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome i am jason bermas sitting in for alex jones who's on assignment
[3:08:28.720 --> 3:08:34.800]  in dallas we're with catherine austin fits and you were talking about really the restructuring
[3:08:34.800 --> 3:08:42.240]  of the global economy and the economy here at home how do you feel the sdr or special drawing
[3:08:42.240 --> 3:08:48.800]  rights unit that the imf is now really issuing fervently fits into all that is this the global
[3:08:48.800 --> 3:08:53.200]  currency that they plan to replace the dollar with because there's all this talk that the dollar can
[3:08:53.200 --> 3:08:58.160]  no longer be the world reserve currency and it would seem that although this hasn't taken a physical
[3:08:58.160 --> 3:09:03.840]  form yet that may be the next step well there are a couple things happening at once jason the first
[3:09:03.840 --> 3:09:10.640]  is there is tremendous tension between the financial really speculative economy and the
[3:09:10.640 --> 3:09:15.680]  real economy and if you look at the countries and the organizations trying to implement trade
[3:09:16.320 --> 3:09:23.040]  around the world it's very painful to be trying to to you know move bananas from here to there
[3:09:23.040 --> 3:09:29.120]  when um the currency or securities you're operating with to manage a real business
[3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:35.120]  have become really a tool of financial speculation and an economic warfare so we see tremendous
[3:09:35.120 --> 3:09:41.760]  demands by countries that are focused on real export and real trade trying to find a way to
[3:09:41.760 --> 3:09:48.480]  transact and manage reserves um in a way that's good for their their real economy and get away
[3:09:48.480 --> 3:09:56.560]  from the from the financial speculation so so there's a demand for a global currency that's
[3:09:56.560 --> 3:10:02.880]  outside the global speculation system that's one number two there's no doubt there's a desire
[3:10:02.880 --> 3:10:08.480]  also to get off the dollar because the dollar's in a long-term decline and what the dollar has
[3:10:08.480 --> 3:10:14.240]  become is uh in one sense is a form of global taxation through the balance sheets so countries
[3:10:14.240 --> 3:10:22.000]  around the world buy dollars they go down in value and literally it's a taxation system so um uh
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:27.520]  there's a real desire for something one that's global that's two that's outside of the speculation
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:33.360]  and three is not going down in value and and that's part of what you're seeing with the FDRs and
[3:10:33.360 --> 3:10:38.800]  and the movement to a global currency um you know but the other thing what we're seeing is we're
[3:10:38.800 --> 3:10:42.720]  just seeing a desire for people to have something that's not going down which is part of what's
[3:10:42.720 --> 3:10:47.520]  pushing the price of gold and silver and the precious metals up a lot in the last couple months
[3:10:48.320 --> 3:10:54.160]  so what does the united states look like once the dollar is dumped as the world reserve currency
[3:10:54.160 --> 3:10:58.560]  is this literally the death of the dollar and we would need some kind of other currency
[3:10:58.560 --> 3:11:04.000]  in the united states with this trigger even a deeper depression i know that obama's talking
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:09.280]  about a double dip recession which to me is just a semantical word game to say hey things aren't
[3:11:09.280 --> 3:11:16.160]  going to get any better they dare not use the term depression but if the dollar is taken away as the
[3:11:16.160 --> 3:11:21.600]  global reserve currency does it survive and what happens here in the united states well i i don't
[3:11:21.600 --> 3:11:26.320]  think we're going through a depression or recession i think we're going through i call it a financial
[3:11:26.320 --> 3:11:34.800]  coup d'etat so i think what you're watching is a fundamental re-engineering of how the world is
[3:11:34.800 --> 3:11:43.120]  governed and it's intentional and it's planned um now it happens in organic ways it's not you
[3:11:43.120 --> 3:11:48.880]  know it's not as though it's perfectly scripted but we're going through a fundamental change and
[3:11:48.880 --> 3:11:58.640]  the decision to basically reduce the middle class to a much more uh uh you know to a much lower
[3:11:58.640 --> 3:12:05.120]  income with much less political power lifestyle was an intentional decision made in the 90s
[3:12:05.840 --> 3:12:11.520]  and uh essentially what has happened is you have one or two generations in the united states have
[3:12:11.520 --> 3:12:18.320]  built up huge wealth over their lifetime and what we saw was that wealth transferred out of the
[3:12:18.320 --> 3:12:23.440]  economy and abroad during the 90s sort of hidden behind the bubble but that's an intentional thing
[3:12:23.440 --> 3:12:27.600]  and so when we talk about this in terms of depression and recession we're talking about
[3:12:27.600 --> 3:12:32.720]  business cycles and that's not really the traditional we're not watching a traditional
[3:12:32.720 --> 3:12:38.480]  business cycle we're watching a fundamental re-engineering of and and centralization of
[3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:44.320]  economic and political control and it's very much global and very planned out um let me give you
[3:12:44.320 --> 3:12:53.280]  an example i was um in in london in uh 2002 to give a paper on it's called the myth of the rule of
[3:12:53.280 --> 3:12:59.040]  law about the sort of how the process of privatization was working here in the united states
[3:12:59.040 --> 3:13:04.640]  and how things were you know basically criminal enterprises being used to centralize all sorts
[3:13:04.640 --> 3:13:11.680]  of ownership and control in real estate into a relatively small group of of people and i gave
[3:13:11.680 --> 3:13:15.920]  the paper and the and following me there was a former reporter from the wall street journal
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:22.880]  giving a paper about the sort of economic warfare in russia during the 90s and then followed by
[3:13:22.880 --> 3:13:27.920]  a wonderful reporter in london who gave one on eastern europe and we were all in a state of shock
[3:13:27.920 --> 3:13:35.440]  because we realized it was the same companies the same banks same hedge funds same um defense
[3:13:35.440 --> 3:13:41.600]  contractors operating as syndicate in all three places we just didn't you know we hadn't seen the
[3:13:41.600 --> 3:13:46.640]  game because we thought it was just north america or russia or eastern europe and what we didn't see
[3:13:46.640 --> 3:13:53.680]  was there was a global process going on of of buying up and controlling um all sorts of land in
[3:13:53.680 --> 3:13:59.760]  real estate and enterprises and and was very much part of a process of economic warfare that was
[3:13:59.760 --> 3:14:05.520]  going on globally well when these elitists talk about redistribution of wealth what they really
[3:14:05.520 --> 3:14:10.320]  mean is that their goal is to take the united states and take us from our first world nation
[3:14:10.320 --> 3:14:16.960]  status and delve us into this second world nation status as they consolidate power as they gain
[3:14:16.960 --> 3:14:23.680]  more power and i see this system being implemented with this cap and trade scam and now being exposed
[3:14:23.680 --> 3:14:29.840]  in climate gate i mean that's why they created these carbon markets and carbon prices i mean that
[3:14:29.840 --> 3:14:35.360]  they the e you openly trades european union this is about globalization and i i think that this is
[3:14:35.360 --> 3:14:42.240]  the next step in this redistribution of how the global economy works yes well here here's let's
[3:14:42.240 --> 3:14:48.640]  look at the let's look at the challenge you know whether whether it's what i could i'll i'll just
[3:14:48.640 --> 3:14:54.320]  call a metaphor for the people running the economy globally so whether you're mr global or whether
[3:14:54.320 --> 3:15:00.000]  you're you know you're you're you're jason and catherine and the and the people listening to this
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:08.640]  call the question is how do we go from being a world of uh where where resources are very much
[3:15:09.680 --> 3:15:17.760]  um uh used by the few and not by the many um and a world where we're having incredible sort of
[3:15:17.760 --> 3:15:24.640]  damage uh from growth in population to the environment on the planet how do we go to a world
[3:15:24.640 --> 3:15:29.760]  where we're living in alignment with each other and with the environment so how do we go from
[3:15:29.760 --> 3:15:37.360]  an unhealthy model to a much more healthy model and and here's the challenge the the question is how
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:44.080]  do you incentivize people to do what's good for the environment and do what's much more equitable
[3:15:44.080 --> 3:15:50.080]  in terms of sharing of resources and there are positive systems you can use to do that jason
[3:15:50.080 --> 3:15:56.400]  the the salaried model says okay why don't we finance communities with equity and then people
[3:15:56.400 --> 3:16:03.040]  can make money and and get financial wealth from reducing consumption the notion that we need
[3:16:03.040 --> 3:16:08.720]  consumption to grow to get the stock market to go up as absurd that's the corporate model but in
[3:16:08.720 --> 3:16:13.920]  fact if you finance places with equity there's enormous financial incentives for all of us to
[3:16:14.480 --> 3:16:20.080]  dramatically reduce our consumption in a way that aligns us you know and our finances with the
[3:16:20.080 --> 3:16:26.240]  with the environment um cap and trade is it is a very different kind of system it's a taxation
[3:16:26.240 --> 3:16:32.080]  system and it says you know you can't trust people to do the right things so rather than
[3:16:32.080 --> 3:16:36.240]  and incentivize them with positive what we're going to do is we're just going to make it very
[3:16:36.240 --> 3:16:42.480]  painful and expensive for them to not lower their footprint but we're going to do it in a way that
[3:16:42.480 --> 3:16:47.920]  one gives us central control and two where we can game the system so i've always said if you think
[3:16:47.920 --> 3:16:51.680]  you know that the cap and trade would make derivatives look like it was something that mother
[3:16:51.680 --> 3:16:59.120]  teresa came up with um because what you're seeing in cap and trade is is the worst polluters on the
[3:16:59.120 --> 3:17:05.760]  in the planet being given a get out of jail free card in exchange for making it much more expensive
[3:17:05.760 --> 3:17:11.040]  for the least polluting people so for example democracy now just had a great description
[3:17:11.040 --> 3:17:17.760]  description um about a month ago of general motors uh purchasing of carbon credits in brazil and
[3:17:17.760 --> 3:17:23.920]  basically you know general motors is free to pollute because because the folks in in brazil
[3:17:23.920 --> 3:17:28.960]  can no longer hunt or do all sorts of things with land that they've been using for generations
[3:17:29.680 --> 3:17:36.720]  so so you literally have a system that allows the the most polluting to to continue to pollute
[3:17:36.720 --> 3:17:41.760]  and and get a get out of jail free card by making life miserable for the people who have the lowest
[3:17:41.760 --> 3:17:48.240]  footprint and exactly even though they're going to buy these carbon credits those fees those costs
[3:17:48.240 --> 3:17:53.920]  will then be implemented on the lower class by what they cost they'll just increase their price and
[3:17:53.920 --> 3:18:00.160]  in fact now you're seeing around gas stations that if cap and trade is passed yes gas will go up 75
[3:18:00.160 --> 3:18:06.240]  cents or a dollar and then the left cover is oh you must work for the oil industry that's why
[3:18:06.240 --> 3:18:10.960]  you're against cap and trade that's why again you're against a carbon tax yet these headlines
[3:18:10.960 --> 3:18:15.440]  i have next to me uh out of bloomberg shell calls for global expansion of cap and trade
[3:18:15.440 --> 3:18:21.200]  co2 programs and then we have an exon executive calling for the same things these are the people
[3:18:21.200 --> 3:18:27.920]  that are actually behind this carbon tax system well let's talk about what we need the the first
[3:18:27.920 --> 3:18:34.160]  thing that we need whether it's you know if you're the american people or you're in land america
[3:18:34.160 --> 3:18:38.800]  or any continent around the world what we all need is transparency about what's going on what
[3:18:38.800 --> 3:18:45.120]  climate gauge shows is that the quote unquote science around uh the need to have any kind of
[3:18:45.120 --> 3:18:53.440]  system is bogus and you know it's very hard for most people to believe that that the concept of
[3:18:53.440 --> 3:18:59.920]  global warming could get this far and we have this kind of sort of bogus science going on
[3:18:59.920 --> 3:19:07.120]  and and so the first thing that's needed jason is transparency about where is climate change coming
[3:19:07.120 --> 3:19:13.040]  from why and what are the things that we can do you know what does the human race control that we
[3:19:13.040 --> 3:19:19.680]  can change that can improve our circumstances for whatever reason and i think that you know i'm
[3:19:19.680 --> 3:19:24.400]  someone who spends a huge amount of time trying to understand what's happening and why and i still
[3:19:24.400 --> 3:19:32.640]  feel absolutely no confidence that i know why or can explain you know why climate change is happening
[3:19:32.640 --> 3:19:38.800]  because i think uh i think there's so much disinformation and it's it's a perfect example
[3:19:38.800 --> 3:19:45.120]  of how disinformation is used to bring about bad policy and control when what we need is the real
[3:19:45.120 --> 3:19:50.160]  honest conversation about what's going to happen and what can we do well the bottom line is if the
[3:19:50.160 --> 3:19:54.800]  data said what they said it showed they wouldn't have destroyed it and they would have allowed it to
[3:19:54.800 --> 3:19:59.600]  be peer reviewed unless except for you know they didn't and they hadn't fallen to the dark abyss
[3:19:59.600 --> 3:20:04.400]  it's the alex joneshow back after this hi this is steve shank alex and i have talked about food

[3:21:20.480 --> 3:21:26.000]  even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose
[3:21:26.000 --> 3:21:31.600]  value or that your retirement would be secure if all looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy

[3:24:05.040 --> 3:24:15.040]  day after day alone on a hill the man with the foolish grin is keeping
[3:24:15.040 --> 3:24:21.680]  her she's called the current economic situation a financial data it's the alex joneshow i'm jason
[3:24:21.680 --> 3:24:30.560]  bermas sitting in i want to move on to what's going on in kopenhagen in just i think it's six
[3:24:30.560 --> 3:24:37.840]  or seven days it begins this kopenhagen treaty where one of the quote unquote three pillars
[3:24:37.840 --> 3:24:44.880]  is global government and the term taxation and tax appears over a dozen times they're trying to get
[3:24:44.880 --> 3:24:51.360]  this cap in the trade scheme global i mean all the way around so that we sign on to a treaty and
[3:24:51.360 --> 3:24:56.800]  of course the united states is the quote unquote worst polluter so we're going to be hit the hardest
[3:24:56.800 --> 3:25:01.600]  what do you see coming out of this this climate treaty this meeting i don't know what's going
[3:25:01.600 --> 3:25:07.920]  to come out of kopenhagen because um i think the there's been a there's a real effort going on
[3:25:07.920 --> 3:25:12.160]  behind the scenes to make sure that the united states doesn't commit or commits as little as
[3:25:12.160 --> 3:25:18.240]  possible and we don't know how it's going to play out the the question behind all of this is
[3:25:18.240 --> 3:25:25.120]  really uh goes back to are we going to have a democracy or are we going to have uh be part of
[3:25:25.120 --> 3:25:32.320]  a system where invisible forces control top down through these unbelievably complex systems a lot
[3:25:32.320 --> 3:25:37.120]  of which are being engineered by using the environmental environmental issues in the
[3:25:37.120 --> 3:25:44.800]  environmental sort of community i think in many respects they're unknowing about it but uh you
[3:25:44.800 --> 3:25:49.680]  know it's it's i don't know what's going to come out jason i think we just have to wait to see but
[3:25:49.680 --> 3:25:56.080]  it's it's part of a long-term trend to try and engineer top-down control in a way that literally
[3:25:56.080 --> 3:26:02.800]  takes uh any kind of accountability out of the of the hands of the people who live in a place so
[3:26:02.800 --> 3:26:08.160]  if you live in a county in the united states and the united states breaks down to just about 3100
[3:26:08.800 --> 3:26:13.200]  counties who's in control in that county is it the world trade organization is it
[3:26:13.760 --> 3:26:19.680]  is it rule set in a place like kopenhagen is it um is it the federal government or is it
[3:26:19.680 --> 3:26:25.520]  your local sheriff and town council and that's that's where the rubber's going to meet the road
[3:26:25.520 --> 3:26:31.280]  if you're a farmer do you own and control the water on your property or is somebody in uh you
[3:26:31.280 --> 3:26:37.280]  know at the world trade organization to determine what happens with it so where do you see all this
[3:26:37.280 --> 3:26:42.880]  going in the united states what are we going to look like in six months in a year is the dollar
[3:26:42.880 --> 3:26:47.760]  going to continue decline is gold going to continue to go up and then how can people really hedge
[3:26:47.760 --> 3:26:54.000]  their bets and protect themselves from this really economic takeover to the tune of an admitted over
[3:26:54.000 --> 3:27:01.840]  27 trillion dollars in bailouts well the first thing you want to do is you you know we so i'm
[3:27:01.840 --> 3:27:05.840]  not a profit so there are many different things that can happen there are many different scenarios
[3:27:05.840 --> 3:27:11.200]  that can play out but the one thing we do know is that there's certain long-term trends and what
[3:27:11.200 --> 3:27:16.480]  you want to do is make sure you align yourself with the long-term trend so the first long-term
[3:27:16.480 --> 3:27:21.920]  trend is we're having a shift of resources out of financial assets and what i call sort of
[3:27:21.920 --> 3:27:29.440]  bubble economics and into real things and what that means is we need to the average person the
[3:27:29.440 --> 3:27:34.400]  average household needs to demonetize so for example i once had a friend who was constantly
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:39.200]  complaining about how the yields in her stock market portfolio were falling and her water bill
[3:27:39.200 --> 3:27:43.680]  was going up and i said well you know this is really easy why don't you just sell some stock
[3:27:43.680 --> 3:27:50.880]  and build a well um and and so that's a perfect example where we put our money into corporate
[3:27:50.880 --> 3:27:55.360]  securities and then we get a yield on our corporate securities and then we go into the market and buy
[3:27:55.360 --> 3:28:00.560]  from those same corporations the goods and services that we need so we've been intermediated and
[3:28:00.560 --> 3:28:08.560]  demonetization is really about saying okay where can i start investing my time in my resources so
[3:28:08.560 --> 3:28:14.480]  that i permanently lower my overhead because it makes sense to you know to go back to the way my
[3:28:14.480 --> 3:28:18.960]  grandparents or great-grandparents did it the economics are changing because we're in a bull
[3:28:18.960 --> 3:28:26.640]  market for tangibles so for example the more i can reduce my dependency in terms of my energy
[3:28:26.640 --> 3:28:33.200]  my food uh you know on on unreliable players you want to get unreliable players out of your life
[3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:40.880]  so um so i you know one of the questions i always ask people is who's your farmer who's your bank
[3:28:40.880 --> 3:28:47.120]  or where is your money um with general uh with with with genetically modified food there's a
[3:28:47.120 --> 3:28:53.040]  reason we all want to start getting to know our farmers again and finding ways of you know maybe
[3:28:53.040 --> 3:29:01.200]  investing in farmland that help make sure you have a you know a wonderful supply of food um you
[3:29:01.200 --> 3:29:08.240]  know so demonetization about about about that the second thing is um where where are you putting
[3:29:08.240 --> 3:29:15.200]  your money and how does that relate to to making sure you're advantaged i always give the example
[3:29:15.200 --> 3:29:21.360]  of uh three women i was sitting with a group of three women who are very close friends and i got
[3:29:21.360 --> 3:29:26.000]  them talking about how their money worked and what we discovered is that one had her money in a
[3:29:26.000 --> 3:29:30.640]  local bank that was sending uh their money into their correspondent bank in new york
[3:29:31.280 --> 3:29:34.880]  this is a large new york bank and they were getting about four percent at the time
[3:29:36.080 --> 3:29:41.200]  on their money and when when we come back i'll finish the story sounds good we're with kathryn
[3:29:41.200 --> 3:29:46.720]  austin fits it's the alex jones show i'm jason vermess sitting in go check out all of our films

[3:30:19.040 --> 3:30:24.320]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[3:30:24.320 --> 3:30:29.600]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[3:30:29.600 --> 3:30:34.720]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[3:30:34.720 --> 3:30:39.280]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[3:30:39.280 --> 3:30:43.840]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators

[3:33:55.600 --> 3:33:59.920]  talking about how you should really know your farmer and then you were getting into how you
[3:33:59.920 --> 3:34:05.040]  should really know your banker yes absolutely so these three women were sitting around all good
[3:34:05.040 --> 3:34:09.840]  friends one had her money in a local bank that was shipping its money to the correspondent
[3:34:09.840 --> 3:34:14.240]  large new york bank she was getting about four percent on her money at the time yields were
[3:34:14.240 --> 3:34:22.640]  much higher the second woman had her uh 401k ira it's both 401k and ira and she had her money
[3:34:22.640 --> 3:34:28.560]  in the in the stock of the same new york bank and their third friend and remember i'm getting
[3:34:28.560 --> 3:34:33.840]  them talking about their money it turns out that their friend was borrowing on her credit card she
[3:34:33.840 --> 3:34:38.560]  started a business using her credit card right after that it was a credit card of the same new
[3:34:38.560 --> 3:34:44.320]  york bank um the bank checked the rate up to 23 percent the first two women are making about five
[3:34:44.320 --> 3:34:51.280]  percent and uh providing their capital their life savings to this bank and one of their best
[3:34:51.280 --> 3:34:56.560]  friends is borrowing it back at 23 percent now what's wrong with that picture why did we why do we
[3:34:56.560 --> 3:35:02.160]  need a bank thousands of miles away or over a thousand miles away to get in between three friends
[3:35:02.160 --> 3:35:08.800]  in a way that's raking off huge and hideous profits well that's an opportunity and um in fact there
[3:35:08.800 --> 3:35:14.880]  was one website that got started prosper.com which was allowing allowing or set up to help people
[3:35:14.880 --> 3:35:22.160]  loan directly to each other and of course you know the boys shut it down so so another question
[3:35:22.160 --> 3:35:28.880]  is where is the opportunity to not be intermediated by the big institutions and find ways of making
[3:35:28.880 --> 3:35:36.000]  more money and keeping the cash flow in either our networks or our neighborhood um let's say we
[3:35:36.000 --> 3:35:43.120]  did everything jason we could we you know we demonetized we bought our generator we started
[3:35:43.120 --> 3:35:47.360]  loaning to our you know let's say we did everything we could do just ourselves and our
[3:35:47.360 --> 3:35:52.320]  networks then the question comes down to okay now how do we start taking political action
[3:35:53.200 --> 3:35:59.040]  and um in addition to who's your farmer and who's your banker a very important question in the
[3:35:59.040 --> 3:36:05.760]  2010 uh election is going to be who's your sheriff because in fact if you look at the legal
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:13.920]  construct upon which the republic was founded the most powerful person in your county is not the
[3:36:13.920 --> 3:36:18.960]  president of the united states and it's not even your governor it's the sheriff and and literally
[3:36:18.960 --> 3:36:24.960]  the federal government cannot do anything outside or against the constitution if your sheriff says
[3:36:24.960 --> 3:36:31.840]  no you may not they they're the ultimate word within that jurisdiction and um we're going to
[3:36:31.840 --> 3:36:36.800]  have richard mac i don't know if you've ever had richard mac on the on info wars but uh we're going
[3:36:36.800 --> 3:36:42.240]  to have richard mac who's a retired sheriff in arizona has written a lot about this question and in
[3:36:42.240 --> 3:36:47.760]  fact took the federal government to court went all the way to the supreme court and won uh he's
[3:36:47.760 --> 3:36:54.640]  going to be on the salaried report in january and so so i'm i just cringe when i see people spend
[3:36:54.640 --> 3:37:00.480]  money and time uh on the presidential elections when they're completely ignoring who is their sheriff
[3:37:00.480 --> 3:37:05.760]  and their political representation in their own local area you know and they're well i always tell
[3:37:05.760 --> 3:37:10.000]  people that they need to start locally and if they truly do want to change the system perhaps
[3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:14.640]  it's time for them to run for city council or state senator or even a congressional spot but
[3:37:14.640 --> 3:37:19.840]  of course the sheriff is a very very powerful position and an electable one so if you don't
[3:37:19.840 --> 3:37:24.080]  like what's going on in your county it's time for you to run for sheriff well but the other thing
[3:37:24.080 --> 3:37:29.040]  is you know the sheriff can do an awful lot if people will support them and that and a lot of
[3:37:29.040 --> 3:37:34.080]  the politics comes down to the fed throws a lot of money the more dependent we get on federal money
[3:37:34.080 --> 3:37:38.960]  and the more the feds control the cash flow locally the more everybody won't support their
[3:37:38.960 --> 3:37:43.520]  sheriff and standing up and that's why it's got to be battled out in the cash flow the next place
[3:37:43.520 --> 3:37:48.880]  you need to go after who's your sheriff is to look at okay let's look at where the where the
[3:37:48.880 --> 3:37:54.720]  governmental money is going we're paying taxes and that tax money is going someplace is that money
[3:37:54.720 --> 3:38:00.080]  circulating into the businesses that create employment and opportunities for us that we are
[3:38:00.080 --> 3:38:05.440]  neighbor zone and i i just want to use an example of what's been happening because if you look if
[3:38:05.440 --> 3:38:11.600]  you dig in and you look at the federal state and local governmental flows all resources not just
[3:38:11.600 --> 3:38:16.960]  contracts or expenditures within a place what you discover is there's enormous opportunity
[3:38:17.600 --> 3:38:22.240]  to lower the burden to taxpayers in a way that creates much more income locally
[3:38:22.240 --> 3:38:28.560]  for us and let me give you a perfect example i live in tennessee we have about 20 of the
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:34.880]  population now on food stamps huge part of the of the federal flow through in the tennessee state
[3:38:34.880 --> 3:38:41.920]  budget it's over a billion dollars now so 20 of the people on food stamps in a state where we have
[3:38:41.920 --> 3:38:49.920]  fabulous farmland beautiful farmland that's just sitting not doing anything it turns out jason
[3:38:49.920 --> 3:38:56.000]  that we are outsourcing the data servicing and customer support work on the food stamp contract
[3:38:56.000 --> 3:39:02.480]  in tennessee it's true in florida other states too are you ready for this jp morgan chase in india
[3:39:02.480 --> 3:39:10.160]  oh how lovely now we have we have counting is in tennessee where we have 25 unemployment so
[3:39:10.160 --> 3:39:17.520]  so the federal and state governments are paying people to not work and and paying for their food
[3:39:17.520 --> 3:39:23.600]  stamps when they are also paying jp morgan chase to do jobs that these people could do
[3:39:25.040 --> 3:39:29.040]  well that's why those arguments never stand up that oh they don't want to take these jobs no
[3:39:29.040 --> 3:39:34.160]  you're not offering them to people you're moving them overseas and making it impossible for them
[3:39:34.160 --> 3:39:40.720]  to do this work well in fact data servicing jobs are wonderful jobs for many people if you are
[3:39:40.720 --> 3:39:46.320]  someone who has responsibilities for caring for children or for elderly parents or both
[3:39:46.320 --> 3:39:51.680]  both data servicing jobs can be beamed in you know you can you can beam them out to lots
[3:39:51.680 --> 3:39:57.360]  of different sites locally um and they can be done in flexible hours so you can get very high
[3:39:57.360 --> 3:40:04.640]  productivity uh with flexible hours in in sites that are closer to home even residential so in
[3:40:04.640 --> 3:40:10.080]  fact it doesn't make any sense to beam those jobs to india because there is a way to do them here
[3:40:10.080 --> 3:40:16.000]  which is enormously wonderful for a workforce that literally cannot get in a car and commute an
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:23.440]  hour into nashville or noxville or you know tampa or olando because they have to take care of
[3:40:23.440 --> 3:40:29.680]  of and it's certainly much more economic for society to have them care for their family members
[3:40:29.680 --> 3:40:34.800]  than to try and institutionalize that so if you if you look at the fundamental economics you'll see
[3:40:34.800 --> 3:40:40.400]  again and again and i saw this i was i searched as the assistant secretary of housing and i would
[3:40:40.400 --> 3:40:46.560]  often see communities where we were spending two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per unit to
[3:40:46.560 --> 3:40:52.240]  construct public housing when fifty thousand would buy and rehab a single family home so we were
[3:40:52.800 --> 3:40:58.560]  we were paying five times per unit of what we needed to and in fact in the clinton administration
[3:40:58.560 --> 3:41:04.640]  i took that example uh was in fact it was new orleans where this situation the fact pattern
[3:41:04.640 --> 3:41:10.800]  was just outrageous um i had first seen it in chicago i took it to the assistant of the person
[3:41:10.800 --> 3:41:15.600]  who ran that program at HUD and i said look if we just re-engineered the money we could get five
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:20.480]  homes for the price of one the person turned bright red looked at me and said but how could we generate
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:26.400]  fees for our friends so when there's a bubble going on jason everybody's happy to generate fees
[3:41:26.400 --> 3:41:32.160]  for their our friends you know when when you turn to people and say your children can't have
[3:41:32.160 --> 3:41:38.160]  health care because there's not enough money it's time to look at 50 years of accumulated
[3:41:38.160 --> 3:41:45.280]  fees for our friends and say you know maybe we need to re-engineer how things work because we had
[3:41:45.280 --> 3:41:50.880]  we've had decades of computers and new technology and yet the overhead costs of fundamental
[3:41:50.880 --> 3:41:58.160]  government projects have have skyrocketed exponentially and that's because we are subsidizing
[3:41:58.160 --> 3:42:04.240]  a huge infrastructure the the biggest piece of which is these big corporations because you give
[3:42:04.240 --> 3:42:10.240]  a big corporation a government contract and you drive their stock up so there's real you know
[3:42:10.240 --> 3:42:14.640]  capital gains on stock market real estate is the primary source of political contributions
[3:42:15.280 --> 3:42:21.440]  and and it starts though in your own county saying okay let me get control of my local
[3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:27.360]  representatives whether it's my sheriff or town council or state representative make sure we have
[3:42:27.360 --> 3:42:32.320]  excellent people in office but then let's look at the money and let's look at where we're paying
[3:42:32.320 --> 3:42:39.600]  five times for you know of what is needed and where we cannot re-engineer the money to get a
[3:42:39.600 --> 3:42:45.920]  much better result in terms of expenses down and income up for the people here in a way that reduces
[3:42:45.920 --> 3:42:50.640]  the load to taxpayer and I tell you those those opportunities are absolutely there
[3:42:51.920 --> 3:42:55.760]  we're going to open up the phone lines for catherine austin fits in just a moment
[3:42:55.760 --> 3:43:00.240]  but first I want to get your take on gold being at a record high today where is the roof on this
[3:43:00.240 --> 3:43:06.720]  thing are are we going to see it go up above 1300 1400 maybe even hit 1500 where do you see
[3:43:06.720 --> 3:43:15.840]  gold and precious metals going if you if you go back and you look at the um at the high in 1980
[3:43:15.840 --> 3:43:24.240]  before the current high and you say okay you know gold traded at 800 even above but you know the
[3:43:24.240 --> 3:43:31.920]  close was 800 so so gold traded at 800 in 1980 if we were going to say okay how much was that in
[3:43:31.920 --> 3:43:37.680]  inflation in just a dollars because we've had enormous inflation from 1980 until now so it's
[3:43:37.680 --> 3:43:45.280]  over 30 years of inflation but in current dollars what was that 800 um depending on who calculates
[3:43:45.280 --> 3:43:50.960]  it and what series they use do they use a government series or for example john William
[3:43:50.960 --> 3:43:58.240]  shadow stats has redone the government numbers um so do we use the the you know more reliable
[3:43:58.240 --> 3:44:05.120]  numbers like john's for the for the cpi in the inflation what would 800 dollars be in current
[3:44:05.120 --> 3:44:13.920]  dollars you get um you get estimates of anywhere from 2500 to 7500 and so what we're looking at
[3:44:13.920 --> 3:44:20.000]  today with the price of approximately 1200 is something that is less than 50 percent of where
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:26.800]  the high was in 1980 so on an inflation adjusted basis jason we're nowhere near the high that's
[3:44:26.800 --> 3:44:35.200]  number one number two the challenge we have with precious metals is that it's a very tiny market
[3:44:35.200 --> 3:44:41.440]  relative to the global stock or bond markets and i mean the global bond market is huge and then you
[3:44:41.440 --> 3:44:47.920]  add derivatives so if a tiny bit of money decides it wants to shift into precious metals you're
[3:44:47.920 --> 3:44:54.720]  talking about enormous pressure to drive the price up now we've seen over the last 15 years
[3:44:55.520 --> 3:45:00.640]  real intervention by the central banks and government treasuries to drive and manage the
[3:45:00.640 --> 3:45:06.880]  price down as really a way to protect the bond bond market and sort of the inflated values of
[3:45:06.880 --> 3:45:12.800]  of global currencies particularly the dollar more and more investors are beginning to understand
[3:45:12.800 --> 3:45:18.560]  that game one of the one of the things that has always threatened the market was the overhang of
[3:45:18.560 --> 3:45:25.280]  of gold that the imf has said that it was willing to sell um the imf is beginning instead of just
[3:45:25.280 --> 3:45:31.600]  threatening sales they they have approved sales but that that overhang is going very quickly into
[3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:37.760]  into central banks which are snapping it up and if you say to yourself look if if central banks
[3:45:37.760 --> 3:45:43.280]  and institutional investors and retail investors are going to start to move into this very very
[3:45:43.280 --> 3:45:49.920]  thin market it doesn't take much incremental change in percentage of market share to drive
[3:45:49.920 --> 3:45:57.040]  the price through the roof so the long-term fundamentals on precious metals are very very
[3:45:57.040 --> 3:46:05.200]  strong uh number one and number two um it is very important to remember that this is an extremely
[3:46:05.200 --> 3:46:11.360]  political market and a very uh you know there's an economic war going on in the middle of this
[3:46:11.360 --> 3:46:18.960]  market so we're looking at prices that are extremely volatile and it's very important um to recognize
[3:46:18.960 --> 3:46:25.040]  yes we have a long-term bull market my guess is that there is a great distance to go this is only
[3:46:25.040 --> 3:46:30.400]  just begun um but you have to be very careful because in the short term we're going to get
[3:46:30.400 --> 3:46:36.320]  wild swings and it's important for a retail investor to not do anything in this market
[3:46:36.320 --> 3:46:41.040]  where they could get they could caught get caught by that you know by those swings so
[3:46:41.040 --> 3:46:46.160]  before anybody sort of tiptoes into these waters just make sure you understand what
[3:46:46.160 --> 3:46:51.040]  what you've got going and be prepared to stick in it for the long haul now when does it end
[3:46:51.760 --> 3:46:58.400]  one of the things that could end all of this is is when a new global currency it goes into effect
[3:46:58.400 --> 3:47:06.400]  and it's really working and that will diminish the need for um for uh using precious metals as
[3:47:06.400 --> 3:47:12.880]  sort of a a global currency this reflects not only that need but the need the distrust that
[3:47:12.880 --> 3:47:19.440]  everybody has in government so we're really watching a deterioration in the quality of sovereign
[3:47:19.440 --> 3:47:24.480]  government credits worldwide so i think this goes on for a long time you just want to be
[3:47:24.480 --> 3:47:29.440]  really careful because we're talking about something that will be will price in very
[3:47:29.440 --> 3:47:34.000]  volatile ways against your local currency all right let's go to the phone lines let's go to
[3:47:34.000 --> 3:47:40.960]  betty in texas betty what's on your mind catrin thank you so much for allowing me to speak to you
[3:47:40.960 --> 3:47:47.520]  i'm so thrilled with everything that you say um however i would like to add in something about
[3:47:47.520 --> 3:47:55.040]  the uh copenhagen uh treaty uh one obama still hasn't produced his birth certificate and he's
[3:47:55.040 --> 3:48:02.400]  being sued over that by philburg i believe and two he cannot set as the head of the security
[3:48:02.400 --> 3:48:09.680]  council of the united nations while he's being president of the united states and so have you
[3:48:09.680 --> 3:48:16.640]  heard anything about whether or not philberg has filed an injunction to keep obama from going
[3:48:16.640 --> 3:48:25.360]  and signing the copenhagen treaty and what do you think about it i i don't know um i don't know
[3:48:26.240 --> 3:48:31.040]  i i'm just an ignorant of the status that lost it occasionally you know i'll like anybody i'll
[3:48:31.040 --> 3:48:36.480]  read things on the internet but i really am not current um and i don't think that there's anything
[3:48:36.480 --> 3:48:40.880]  actually going on in regards to the copenhagen treaty due to that i thank you for the call betty
[3:48:40.880 --> 3:48:48.160]  let's go to chris in new mexico chris you're online thanks jason hi uh catherine hi jason
[3:48:49.120 --> 3:48:54.960]  no that that was jason i'm chris oh i'm sorry chris okay oh chris what do you got for us uh
[3:48:54.960 --> 3:48:59.440]  catherine nice to hear you and uh in the daytime instead of the middle of the night uh would you
[3:48:59.440 --> 3:49:04.960]  spend a few minutes talking about uh one of the alternative currencies you know i i think that's
[3:49:04.960 --> 3:49:09.040]  the only way that we're going to get out of this mess something like along the lines of
[3:49:09.040 --> 3:49:14.080]  if the hours or you know some of the others that have been established and i i know you know a
[3:49:14.080 --> 3:49:22.240]  little bit about that so maybe can you um address that sure i i think there are uh a number of ways
[3:49:22.240 --> 3:49:29.200]  that we can start to transact both locally and in our networks and the important thing to understand
[3:49:29.200 --> 3:49:36.080]  is it needs to be built in a very granular way which gives energy to the people in the short
[3:49:36.080 --> 3:49:42.800]  short term within a community one of the challenges of community currencies is that um
[3:49:44.240 --> 3:49:49.200]  if you organize them as a sort of new legal structure and make them complicated they can
[3:49:49.200 --> 3:49:56.240]  be very expensive and time-consuming and i'm a believer in the just do it method um and i would
[3:49:56.240 --> 3:50:02.080]  look at several things one is the idea of doing of using your gold the silver coins as as just
[3:50:02.080 --> 3:50:08.800]  uh a medium of exchange if you go to our website at salieri.com Franklin Sanders as the money changer
[3:50:08.800 --> 3:50:15.680]  and i have uh created a little application which we're about to redevelop and roll out a new one
[3:50:15.680 --> 3:50:20.960]  in 2010 called the gold and silver payment calculator and it allows you to translate back
[3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:26.400]  and forth between dollars you know let's say you want to pay somebody a hundred dollars
[3:50:26.400 --> 3:50:31.600]  you can use the calculator to very quickly calculate in silver and gold coins what it
[3:50:31.600 --> 3:50:37.200]  would take to to pay that amount so um the first thing they're going i'm going to suggest three
[3:50:37.200 --> 3:50:42.640]  things but the first is just start using your gold and silver coins to transact just do it
[3:50:43.440 --> 3:50:47.760]  let's let's talk about those other two things on the other side it's the alex joneshow i'm jason

[3:52:19.520 --> 3:52:25.520]  they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens

[3:54:10.080 --> 3:54:15.440]  final segment of the alex joneshow he's out on the simon in dalis i'm jason vermis sitting in if
[3:54:15.440 --> 3:54:20.080]  you missed any of the program remember following the broadcast the podcast is available at info
[3:54:20.080 --> 3:54:26.160]  wars dot com three great guests a jim o'neill gary lachman kathryn austin fits and of course alex
[3:54:26.160 --> 3:54:31.920]  jones joined us for the better part of an hour kathryn you were just talking about what currencies
[3:54:31.920 --> 3:54:36.880]  you could get into you said you know use your silver and gold coins as currencies but you had
[3:54:36.880 --> 3:54:41.360]  two other points you want to make sure and and this is the you know how do we start currencies
[3:54:41.360 --> 3:54:46.320]  by the just do it method the second is there's a wonderful association called urdo it's the
[3:54:46.320 --> 3:54:52.880]  international association related to barter networks in your community it is likely that you
[3:54:52.880 --> 3:54:58.640]  already have a barter network set up that could use some support and there is a great deal that
[3:54:58.640 --> 3:55:04.320]  can be done through barter networks both locally and their network globally so you know you can
[3:55:04.320 --> 3:55:11.360]  end up getting your your tour package to scotland for for the holidays um through your local barter
[3:55:11.360 --> 3:55:17.600]  network so so check out the urdo website and find the local barter network or networks in your place
[3:55:17.600 --> 3:55:21.360]  and start to see if there aren't ways you can use it a lot of times you'll find
[3:55:21.360 --> 3:55:29.120]  businesses report as much as the 10 increase in sales uh that come about by their use of of barter
[3:55:29.120 --> 3:55:34.480]  so there's a lot of opportunities but we need to start just build from the infrastructure that's
[3:55:34.480 --> 3:55:44.240]  there finally there's um there's a real opportunity as chris said to to explore uh exchanging or
[3:55:44.240 --> 3:55:51.760]  trading or using hours um just using hours among neighbors and friends and and businesses
[3:55:51.760 --> 3:55:57.840]  but then going to a more formal system of trading our time and trading hours um that makes an awful
[3:55:57.840 --> 3:56:03.360]  lot of sense sense to explore it starts with really talking to other people in your community
[3:56:03.360 --> 3:56:07.760]  whether it's your neighbor or other small businesses about how you can help each other
[3:56:07.760 --> 3:56:13.200]  save time or lower your expenses so it really starts with socializing and communication and
[3:56:13.200 --> 3:56:19.360]  just exploring the ideas if you can start to have more reciprocal relationships and connections
[3:56:19.360 --> 3:56:23.920]  then you can move to a a system of really trading hours and there's lots of information
[3:56:24.560 --> 3:56:30.320]  on the website now i will i will say one of the most interesting statistics jason is during the
[3:56:30.320 --> 3:56:36.720]  great depression there were over 3200 local currencies in america do you think there'll be
[3:56:36.720 --> 3:56:43.760]  a revival in 30 100 counties so so this is something uh that we're gonna we're gonna go
[3:56:43.760 --> 3:56:50.160]  we're gonna return and be doing this again and so it absolutely makes sense to spend time
[3:56:50.160 --> 3:56:54.000]  but start with what you know whether it's your gold and silver coins barter networks in your
[3:56:54.000 --> 3:56:58.800]  community just getting to know more people in your neighborhood and seeing where you can't trade time
[3:56:58.800 --> 3:57:04.240]  uh you know just where i live in a very rural community so we're always uh offering to help
[3:57:04.240 --> 3:57:10.240]  each other i'm going into town what can i pick up for you all right final caller noel in illinois
