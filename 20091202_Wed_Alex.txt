[00:00:04.932 --> 00:00:06.233]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:07.994]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.994 --> 00:00:09.756]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.756 --> 00:00:11.337]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.337 --> 00:00:12.118]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.902 --> 00:00:17.086]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:22.030]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.131]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:23.572]  Welcome.
[00:00:23.572 --> 00:00:26.354]  I am Jason Burmess, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.354 --> 00:00:28.496]  Alex Jones on assignment in Dallas.
[00:00:28.496 --> 00:00:32.659]  It is Wednesday, December 2nd, 2009.
[00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.842]  Almost on its way out, folks.
[00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:36.503]  Flying by.
[00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.144]  We have a power-packed show.
[00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:40.087]  Three guests today.
[00:00:40.087 --> 00:00:40.568]  Big guests.
[00:00:40.568 --> 00:00:44.314]  We've got Catherine Austin Fitz on in the final hour.
[00:00:44.314 --> 00:00:47.459]  We're going to be talking about the entire economic
[00:00:48.627 --> 00:00:50.347]  Meltdown worldwide.
[00:00:50.347 --> 00:00:50.867]  Worldwide.
[00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:52.028]  Dubai going under.
[00:00:52.028 --> 00:00:53.268]  Hedges against the dollar.
[00:00:53.268 --> 00:00:55.528]  She's going to break it down for us in the final hour.
[00:00:55.528 --> 00:01:01.289]  In the second hour, we're going to have Gary Lackmann, who wrote the book, Politics and the Occult.
[00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.870]  That should be an exciting one for anybody who follows kind of what the religion is of the elite.
[00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.231]  And why do we have all this symbology?
[00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:11.971]  Many of them pose as Christian conservatives, but are they really?
[00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.192]  So we're going to get deep into that as well.
[00:01:14.192 --> 00:01:15.772]  And former Navy SEAL,
[00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:23.898]  Jim O'Neill has written an article, it's up on Infowars.com, all about Climacate, the latest news on Climacate.
[00:01:23.898 --> 00:01:25.599]  Penn State is investigating.
[00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:27.720]  People are stepping down.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.284]  In Australia, they could not pass their new emissions trading standard.
[00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:34.124]  That went under.
[00:01:34.124 --> 00:01:37.467]  The fraud is being exposed, and perhaps the biggest story
[00:01:38.903 --> 00:01:42.226]  Arming Goldman with pistols against public Alice Schroeder.
[00:01:42.226 --> 00:01:43.207]  That's right.
[00:01:43.207 --> 00:01:51.716]  Goldman Sachs is so worried about some kind of an insurrection or somebody stepping up to the plate and doing something that I don't encourage.
[00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:56.520]  But they're so worried about people stepping in that they're now arming their employees.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.105]  Do you understand why the bankers have been trying to take away our gun rights?
[00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:02.786]  Say the Second Amendment just doesn't exist?
[00:02:03.447 --> 00:02:10.609]  Put limitations on what you're allowed to have because they're blowing out the economy and they know the masses will not stand for it.
[00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:14.070]  Alex is also going to be calling in from Dallas on assignment.
[00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.390]  Maybe he'll let you in on what he's doing.
[00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.131]  Very exciting stuff.
[00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:18.291]  Let me just read this.
[00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:21.512]  I just wrote my first reference for a gun permit.
[00:02:21.512 --> 00:02:23.252]  This is out of Bloomberg, by the way.
[00:02:23.252 --> 00:02:32.735]  Said a friend who told me of swearing to the good character of a Goldman Sachs Group Incorporated banker who applied to the local police for a permit to buy a pistol.
[00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:36.220]  See, they know that the dollar doesn't have long.
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.867]  They know that they've stolen publicly now, according to this same publication!
[00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.209]  Almost 30 trillion dollars, and that was months ago.
[00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.630]  It's probably well past that.
[00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.150]  The official number, I believe, was 27 trillion dollars.
[00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.851]  Let that sink in!
[00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:54.191]  Yet we are at record unemployment all over.
[00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:57.932]  Detroit looks like a war zone!
[00:02:57.932 --> 00:03:00.132]  Where do you see the footage that our guys got there?
[00:03:00.132 --> 00:03:02.073]  It's unbelievable.
[00:03:02.073 --> 00:03:05.774]  It looks worse than Katrina, than New Orleans.
[00:03:05.774 --> 00:03:07.854]  And that's coming all around the country.
[00:03:09.028 --> 00:03:13.832]  As the dollar becomes destitute and gold hits a new high yet again.
[00:03:13.832 --> 00:03:16.274]  It doesn't seem like there's going to be a roof on this thing.
[00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:18.576]  It could hit $1,500, folks.
[00:03:18.576 --> 00:03:24.141]  Again, when I was listening to Alex Jones back in 2003, you could get an ounce of gold for under $300.
[00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:28.004]  And people were telling me then, oh, it's a scam.
[00:03:28.004 --> 00:03:29.346]  Gold will never go up.
[00:03:29.346 --> 00:03:31.828]  Oh no, it's only tripled plus in value.
[00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:36.672]  You tell me one other investment out there, one other honest investment, that's done the same and there isn't one.
[00:03:38.206 --> 00:03:43.282]  And hard currency like gold and silver is what you need to be into as the dollar declines even further?
[00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:47.826]  They say all over the place they're bailing out Dubai, and guess what?
[00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:50.928]  The war gets escalated in the Middle East.
[00:03:50.928 --> 00:03:57.391]  We've been talking about a redistribution of forces since the inception of the Obama administration.
[00:03:57.391 --> 00:04:07.535]  It doesn't matter that it comes out in the New York Times that Karzai's brother has been on a CIA payroll for the last eight years under two separate administrations, even though they're one and the same.
[00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:13.998]  Remember, Robert Gates just comes in at the end of the Bush administration and stays over for the Obama administration.
[00:04:14.338 --> 00:04:18.040]  This is a guy who was heavily embroiled in the Iran-Contra scandal.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:26.104]  And then it comes out for eight years this CIA has been paying Karzai's brother who is a warlord who runs opium.
[00:04:26.104 --> 00:04:28.865]  Who runs opium.
[00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:31.907]  And then I have to sit there and watch our president
[00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:44.154]  Our talking puppet, up in front of West Point, say that we're not an imperialist nation, and we've never tried for world domination, and we would never go into another nation to take its resources.
[00:04:44.154 --> 00:04:49.076]  As we do it, as he escalates the war with his false left cover.
[00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:49.877]  We'll be back after this.
[00:04:49.877 --> 00:04:51.057]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:53.939]  I am Jason Verma, sitting at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:00.046 --> 00:05:04.149]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:07.010]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.112]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:05:09.112 --> 00:05:11.353]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.014]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:05:13.014 --> 00:05:17.337]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:20.038]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:05:20.038 --> 00:05:26.060]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecolablue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.842]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:05:30.842 --> 00:05:33.683]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:05:33.683 --> 00:05:36.403]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:43.566]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:47.588]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[00:05:47.588 --> 00:05:47.848]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:49.769]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:05:59.858 --> 00:06:04.422]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.422 --> 00:06:05.322]  Number one.
[00:06:05.322 --> 00:06:08.745]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.745 --> 00:06:09.606]  Number two.
[00:06:09.606 --> 00:06:14.510]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.250]  It's true.
[00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.794]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.114 --> 00:06:20.935]  Number 3.
[00:06:20.935 --> 00:06:24.517]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:28.440]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.241]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:32.002]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.002 --> 00:06:35.685]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.685 --> 00:06:36.466]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:40.609]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:45.372]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.652 --> 00:06:49.836]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.836 --> 00:06:51.618]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.618 --> 00:06:53.880]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.222]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:00.606 --> 00:07:06.189]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.
[00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:20.636]  If you suffer from chronic or recurring pain, or if you take prescription drugs for pain, then you owe it to yourself to visit TPR20info.com and get TPR20, the effective pain relief cream, without the harmful side effects of prescription drugs.
[00:07:21.036 --> 00:07:25.120]  I use TPR-20 for arthritis in my hand and it works great.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.624]  It relieves the pain fast and fights the inflammation to keep the pain away longer.
[00:07:29.624 --> 00:07:38.793]  On TPR20info.com, you can read about the many uses of TPR-20, like arthritis, fibromyalgia, sports injuries, back pain, sore muscles, and much, much more.

[00:07:54.606 --> 00:08:01.032]  That's tpr20info.com.
[00:08:01.032 --> 00:08:06.617]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.013 --> 00:08:09.713]  We are back!
[00:08:09.713 --> 00:08:10.534]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:10.534 --> 00:08:11.915]  I am Jason Vermas sitting in.
[00:08:11.915 --> 00:08:13.636]  Alex on assignment in Dallas.
[00:08:13.636 --> 00:08:16.117]  He'll be joining us later on in the program.
[00:08:16.117 --> 00:08:17.658]  Three power-packed guests.
[00:08:17.658 --> 00:08:21.140]  Former Navy SEAL Jim O'Neill coming up at the top of the next hour.
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.683]  Gary Lackman, actually the founding member and guitar player for Blondie.
[00:08:27.763 --> 00:08:31.446]  Author of Politics and the Occult, and then of course, Katherine Austin Fitz.
[00:08:31.446 --> 00:08:38.612]  A lot of people have been emailing and calling in, trying to get her on, talk about the financial meltdown that is happening right now.
[00:08:38.612 --> 00:08:42.655]  But I want to go to a story that really is a nexus point for that.
[00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:47.539]  As the economy collapses, as they have to show their true cards,
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.223]  Because it doesn't matter that all these Climategate emails come out.
[00:08:51.223 --> 00:08:52.584]  Guess what went up 2%?
[00:08:52.584 --> 00:08:54.025]  The carbon trading market!
[00:08:54.025 --> 00:08:57.148]  That supposedly doesn't exist or is just here to protect us.
[00:08:57.148 --> 00:08:58.989]  It's not here to bring us world government.
[00:08:58.989 --> 00:09:02.973]  But then Kevin Rudd, who's the Prime Minister over in Australia,
[00:09:03.573 --> 00:09:17.017]  Clearly said it is about world government, we need world government in order to combat climate change, yet we had another great victory for humanity yesterday when the ETS, the Emissions Trading Standard, did not pass.
[00:09:17.017 --> 00:09:19.777]  Let me say it again, did not pass.
[00:09:19.777 --> 00:09:29.240]  So the bankers feel like, well if we blow out this economy anymore, if we take away any more jobs, I mean the real unemployment, as Bob Chapman and others will tell you, people like Webster Tarpley,
[00:09:30.768 --> 00:09:32.189]  Is almost 20%.
[00:09:32.189 --> 00:09:36.910]  Almost 20% in the late great United States of America.
[00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:47.554]  So now the Goldman Sachs bankers are getting a little bit worried and they are applying for pistol permits while they tell the public that guns are dangerous and we should just hand them over.
[00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:50.195]  Let's be a society like a Maoist China.
[00:09:50.195 --> 00:09:52.616]  After all, we celebrate it in this country now.
[00:09:52.616 --> 00:09:54.316]  China's our new best buddy.
[00:09:54.316 --> 00:09:58.818]  It's a joke on Saturday Night Live when Obama goes over there and we owe them trillions.
[00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.692]  And we have to work with them.
[00:10:02.692 --> 00:10:20.023]  Meanwhile, as the dollar gets blown out, they slowly but surely boost up the Special Drawing Rights Unit, which is the real global currency, which is the real international monetary fund scam out there, as it just soaked up the SEC and the Federal Reserve.
[00:10:20.023 --> 00:10:23.965]  They announce it to you at these G20 meetings, and you're sucking your thumb.
[00:10:23.965 --> 00:10:25.486]  You don't even understand what's going on.
[00:10:25.486 --> 00:10:27.528]  Most people will tell me there isn't even a global currency.
[00:10:28.308 --> 00:10:39.275]  It doesn't matter if the following G8 that they show you a model, and by they I'm talking about the Prime Minister of Russia, Medved, shows you a model for this global currency in a hard form.
[00:10:39.275 --> 00:10:45.279]  So the bankers are starting to get a little worried in this country because, seriously folks, we've had it too good for too long.
[00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:47.120]  Everybody asks me, why haven't we stood up?
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.021]  Why aren't there people in the streets?
[00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:51.622]  Well, number one, the elite are smart and they play us off against each other.
[00:10:51.622 --> 00:10:53.424]  They give you that false left-right paradigm.
[00:10:54.366 --> 00:10:57.548]  They make it look like a clown, like Glenn Beck is telling you the truth.
[00:10:57.548 --> 00:10:58.609]  Do you realize?
[00:10:58.609 --> 00:11:00.029]  I watched his show the other day.
[00:11:00.029 --> 00:11:01.310]  I was in the coffee room.
[00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:06.813]  Do you realize the man is talking to an entire nation of adults like children?
[00:11:06.813 --> 00:11:09.935]  Why else would he stand up in front of a chalkboard?
[00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:12.697]  He's talking to you like you're 8 and you're listening!
[00:11:12.697 --> 00:11:14.878]  People are being suckered in by this guy!
[00:11:14.878 --> 00:11:15.779]  And unfortunately,
[00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:32.706]  He is probably telling a little bit more of the truth than the rest of the mainstream media, but then he distorts it like he's going to be a savior and tells you that FEMA camps don't exist, don't really worry about these MIAC reports, let's not mention 9-11 truth except in the excerpt that they will help Al-Qaeda to bring down America.
[00:11:32.706 --> 00:11:35.447]  All this disinformation flowing at you.
[00:11:35.447 --> 00:11:39.729]  And now bankers are being encouraged to pack heat, to pack pistols.
[00:11:40.981 --> 00:11:50.371]  Because they don't know when somebody's going to go over the edge after they lost their house, their wife, their car to these banksters that, again, have openly stolen.
[00:11:50.371 --> 00:11:53.555]  Openly stolen over $27 trillion.
[00:11:53.555 --> 00:11:55.136]  Let that roll through your mind for a moment.
[00:11:55.136 --> 00:11:55.777]  $27 trillion.
[00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.970]  27 trillion.
[00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.791]  It's not even a real number at this point to most people.
[00:12:01.791 --> 00:12:02.591]  People just nod their head.
[00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:04.712]  They're like, don't worry, the economy's coming.
[00:12:04.712 --> 00:12:06.812]  Obama tells me everything's okay.
[00:12:06.812 --> 00:12:09.753]  It doesn't matter if they're talking about a war tax.
[00:12:09.753 --> 00:12:11.873]  That's the newest big hilarity out there.
[00:12:11.873 --> 00:12:14.054]  They're going to keep taxing you.
[00:12:14.054 --> 00:12:17.395]  And now they said, we're just going to tax the rich for the war.
[00:12:17.395 --> 00:12:21.156]  You know, because the rich are the ones that pay the taxes in this country.
[00:12:21.156 --> 00:12:21.776]  Laugh out loud.
[00:12:22.921 --> 00:12:35.214]  No, if we tax the rich, that will give the rich another excuse to raise prices on us and giving us yet another invisible tax besides the inflation we already have, besides the gutting of the dollar.
[00:12:35.214 --> 00:12:39.018]  And again, folks, record highs for gold yet again today.
[00:12:40.438 --> 00:12:41.339]  So let me read some more of this.
[00:13:01.574 --> 00:13:03.975]  I inquired about do have pistol permits.
[00:13:03.975 --> 00:13:04.815]  Oh!
[00:13:04.815 --> 00:13:08.217]  You know how hard it is, by the way, in New York to get a pistol permit?
[00:13:08.217 --> 00:13:10.438]  I can't tell you how difficult it is.
[00:13:10.438 --> 00:13:10.878]  Okay?
[00:13:10.878 --> 00:13:13.099]  My buddy went over to Iraq.
[00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:14.139]  He went over to Iraq.
[00:13:14.139 --> 00:13:19.141]  He served, I believe, two tours over in Iraq as a National Guardsman.
[00:13:19.141 --> 00:13:19.461]  Okay?
[00:13:19.461 --> 00:13:21.222]  He was a National Guardsman before that.
[00:13:21.222 --> 00:13:25.683]  He tried to get his carry and conceal pistol permit in New York State.
[00:13:25.683 --> 00:13:26.644]  They didn't give it to him.
[00:13:27.554 --> 00:13:30.737]  Do you know how difficult it is to get a carry pistol?
[00:13:30.737 --> 00:13:38.245]  You basically have to be in law enforcement at the time, or you have to be, I mean, some kind of a super military guy.
[00:13:38.245 --> 00:13:44.853]  You need all sorts of people to be calling to the police department saying, yes, he's a good person, you need a judge, you need some insiders.
[00:13:44.853 --> 00:13:45.994]  Well, that's what bankers have.
[00:13:47.128 --> 00:13:48.329]  They are truly the puppeteer.
[00:13:48.329 --> 00:13:54.652]  So now they can arm themselves in New York, but they tell everybody else in New York that guns are bad.
[00:13:54.652 --> 00:13:56.813]  They make them look illegal on TV.
[00:13:56.813 --> 00:13:58.994]  They do knock-in talks.
[00:13:58.994 --> 00:13:59.674]  Oh, how you doing?
[00:13:59.674 --> 00:14:02.576]  We're just checking to make sure that everybody's guns are legal.
[00:14:02.576 --> 00:14:03.937]  Mind if we come in?
[00:14:03.937 --> 00:14:10.180]  They've been doing it for years and years and years and years.
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.061]  And now the bankers need pistols.
[00:14:13.206 --> 00:14:18.068]  While we wait, Goldman has wrapped itself in the flag of Warren Buffett, with whom it jointly donate 500 million.
[00:14:18.068 --> 00:14:20.450]  See, they actually pose them as like the saviors.
[00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:25.032]  Oh, without Goldman Sachs, the sun won't shine.
[00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:26.032]  We wouldn't have jobs.
[00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:28.714]  They're too big to fail.
[00:14:28.714 --> 00:14:34.537]  Since when are these large institutions in a true capitalist system?
[00:14:34.537 --> 00:14:36.398]  And it's never been a true capitalist system.
[00:14:36.398 --> 00:14:37.298]  Too big to fail.
[00:14:37.298 --> 00:14:38.198]  No, they should go under.
[00:14:38.198 --> 00:14:40.680]  They should be prosecuted for their crimes.
[00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:46.524]  They want to convert this market into a carbon trading system.
[00:14:46.524 --> 00:14:47.968]  And that's why they keep pushing forward.
[00:14:47.968 --> 00:14:48.470]  That's why...
[00:14:49.551 --> 00:15:00.335]  The White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, said about climate change and climate gate that it doesn't matter because most people still believe in global warming.
[00:15:00.335 --> 00:15:08.198]  It doesn't matter that right in front of me, right in front of me, a climate scientist at center of email controversy to step down.
[00:15:08.198 --> 00:15:09.379]  This is Washington Post.
[00:15:09.379 --> 00:15:15.101]  And this is the guy we've been telling you about, Phil Jones, the guy who was blatantly caught manipulating information.
[00:15:16.223 --> 00:15:19.926]  If you listen to the weekend programs, you know they actually dumped the raw data.
[00:15:19.926 --> 00:15:21.207]  They threw it away!
[00:15:21.207 --> 00:15:25.870]  Why would you throw away the raw climate data if it proved your point?
[00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:33.915]  If it proved your point, beyond a reasonable doubt, of course you would not throw away the data and dump it.
[00:15:33.915 --> 00:15:37.878]  So now this guy right here, Phil Jones, is stepping down.
[00:15:37.878 --> 00:15:45.764]  And by the way, we're going to get to the story about Enhoff asking Barbara Boxer to investigate possible scientific conspiracy in Climategate.
[00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.753]  Of course it's a conspiracy!
[00:15:49.753 --> 00:15:51.134]  Listen to Lord Christopher Montan.
[00:15:51.134 --> 00:15:53.436]  If you missed that interview with Alex Jones, you really need to hear that.
[00:15:53.436 --> 00:15:54.477]  That happened last Friday.
[00:15:54.477 --> 00:15:55.498]  He laid it out.
[00:15:55.498 --> 00:15:56.179]  He laid it out.
[00:15:56.179 --> 00:16:00.963]  They were trying to bring in global government by stealth, Alex.
[00:16:00.963 --> 00:16:05.087]  And we get up here and we read the document.
[00:16:05.087 --> 00:16:07.009]  The Copenhagen Treaty.
[00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:08.711]  It's the second.
[00:16:08.711 --> 00:16:09.932]  Six days from now, I believe.
[00:16:09.932 --> 00:16:11.313]  It's either six or seven days from now.
[00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:18.333]  They are going to get together in Copenhagen and start this conference as though Climategate doesn't even exist.
[00:16:18.333 --> 00:16:33.019]  As if these emails don't prove that the people that were saying man-made global warming is real and you need to pay a carbon tax and you should only have a two-child policy, and yes, we write books like Ecoscience, where we say we'll put sterilants in the water,
[00:16:34.534 --> 00:16:41.160]  And we actually put out press releases that climate change is increasing prostitution in third world nations.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.900]  It's pulling more people.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.841]  I have that headline over here.
[00:16:42.841 --> 00:16:44.743]  We'll get to that later.
[00:16:44.743 --> 00:16:46.464]  The guy steps down.
[00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:50.528]  We may have an investigation in Congress.
[00:16:50.528 --> 00:16:53.931]  The emails are real and they're still going.
[00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:55.612]  You read that document?
[00:16:55.612 --> 00:17:00.837]  The word government appears over two dozen times, whether it be government or intergovernmental.
[00:17:01.823 --> 00:17:08.070]  And remember, one of the pillars of this document is a new global government.
[00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:10.592]  Then the word tax appears at least a dozen times.
[00:17:10.592 --> 00:17:13.756]  People will tell me, oh, you work the leftists out there.
[00:17:13.756 --> 00:17:15.878]  They're admitting that the emails are real.
[00:17:15.878 --> 00:17:17.039]  They're admitting it's a problem.
[00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:19.241]  George Moonbyat being one of them.
[00:17:19.241 --> 00:17:20.943]  Out of The Guardian.
[00:17:20.943 --> 00:17:22.325]  Huge globalist.
[00:17:22.325 --> 00:17:24.427]  Wrote a book called The New World Order, by the way.
[00:17:26.223 --> 00:17:29.304]  Won't talk about 9-11 truth except in a derogatory manner.
[00:17:29.304 --> 00:17:31.726]  Now this guy is a piece of work.
[00:17:31.726 --> 00:17:44.552]  He writes a piece and he says, yes, we have to acknowledge that the emails are real, but we also have to acknowledge that people won't understand why they said the things they did and climate change is still real.
[00:17:44.552 --> 00:17:50.535]  And he uses the term climate change denier, trying to associate anybody that is a skeptic
[00:17:51.295 --> 00:17:52.397]  Of man-made global warming.
[00:17:52.397 --> 00:17:54.940]  And they've changed the definition many, many times.
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.626]  And remember, there was supposed to be global cooling back when my parents were in school.
[00:17:58.626 --> 00:18:06.377]  Then when I was in school, they taught us that global warming was happening because there was a hole in the ozone layer from our chlorofluorocarbons.
[00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:06.917]  CFCs.
[00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.330]  Spray paints, hairspray, killing the earth that way.
[00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:15.311]  Then when that didn't stand up to the data, when that was a big joke, they changed the terminology again.
[00:18:15.311 --> 00:18:17.352]  Semantical word games.
[00:18:17.352 --> 00:18:19.852]  And they said, no, we'll call it climate change.
[00:18:19.852 --> 00:18:21.832]  We'll call it man-made climate change.
[00:18:21.832 --> 00:18:25.333]  And then we'll figure out a way to tax people for carbon.
[00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:33.194]  It doesn't matter that nobody can see carbon during the regular day and most of the populace is so dumbed down they have no idea what carbon dioxide is.
[00:18:33.194 --> 00:18:34.975]  See, that'll work in our favor.
[00:18:34.975 --> 00:18:36.075]  They'll think it's a harmful
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.821]  Pollutant!
[00:18:37.821 --> 00:18:43.466]  Meanwhile, it's a life-giving gas and part of the natural structure.
[00:18:43.466 --> 00:18:45.588]  It's what plants breathe.
[00:18:45.588 --> 00:18:51.093]  And we'll put a guy named Al Gore on the cover of Newsweek with a green apple and we'll start this whole green thing.
[00:18:51.093 --> 00:18:54.376]  And he'll make billions, but we'll make trillions.
[00:18:54.376 --> 00:18:55.297]  See, he's the front man.
[00:18:56.325 --> 00:19:02.448]  So getting back to this, Climate Scientist at Center of Email Controversy to Step Down.
[00:19:02.448 --> 00:19:14.393]  A scientist who is one of the central figures in the controversy over hacked emails from the University of East Angelia's Climate Research Unit announced Tuesday that he is stepping down while the university investigates the incident.
[00:19:14.393 --> 00:19:23.838]  Remember these emails said things, we're going to use tricks, we had to hide the data, we can't show you the global cooling trend of the last eight to nine years.
[00:19:25.785 --> 00:19:27.446]  Unbelievable.
[00:19:27.446 --> 00:19:35.152]  Climate skeptics have seized on several emails, several, several thousand emails are out there from Phil Jones, as well are the documents.
[00:19:35.152 --> 00:19:36.073]  But you know what's not there?
[00:19:36.073 --> 00:19:38.555]  The raw data because they dumped it.
[00:19:38.555 --> 00:19:42.998]  They couldn't let anybody see the raw data that proved that this was bunk.
[00:19:42.998 --> 00:19:46.441]  They want their world government by hook or by crook.
[00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:47.381]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:47.381 --> 00:19:50.344]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:20:00.464 --> 00:20:01.124]  Hello!
[00:20:01.124 --> 00:20:05.887]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:20:05.887 --> 00:20:10.709]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:15.772]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:20:15.772 --> 00:20:20.434]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[00:20:20.434 --> 00:20:24.536]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[00:20:24.636 --> 00:20:29.019]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:33.582]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[00:20:33.582 --> 00:20:35.644]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[00:20:35.644 --> 00:20:37.805]  I can't say enough about this book.
[00:20:37.805 --> 00:20:39.726]  Blessings to you and your family.
[00:20:39.726 --> 00:20:45.450]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.833]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:20:48.833 --> 00:20:51.575]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.

[00:21:00.447 --> 00:21:02.629]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.629 --> 00:21:03.469]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.469 --> 00:21:03.809]  Yeah.
[00:21:03.809 --> 00:21:08.853]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:08.853 --> 00:21:10.474]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.474 --> 00:21:11.214]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.214 --> 00:21:11.635]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.635 --> 00:21:12.735]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:12.735 --> 00:21:15.697]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.697 --> 00:21:19.580]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.

[00:21:22.702 --> 00:21:25.324]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.324 --> 00:21:26.906]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:26.906 --> 00:21:27.206]  Right!

[00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:31.089]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:32.450]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:36.314]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.314 --> 00:21:40.097]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[00:21:40.097 --> 00:21:45.241]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.

[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:07.325]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:15.430]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:23.596]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:23.596 --> 00:22:28.359]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.679 --> 00:22:33.902]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.902 --> 00:22:38.264]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:38.264 --> 00:22:39.344]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:39.344 --> 00:22:43.366]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:43.846 --> 00:22:48.748]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:48.748 --> 00:22:51.729]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:51.729 --> 00:22:53.509]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.509 --> 00:22:53.749]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.946 --> 00:23:01.828]  How would you feel with normal blood pressure?
[00:23:01.828 --> 00:23:05.071]  How would you feel with a normal cholesterol reading without the drugs?
[00:23:05.071 --> 00:23:06.953]  What if you could avoid bypass surgery?
[00:23:06.953 --> 00:23:09.495]  Would it not be nice to have your heartbeat regularly again?
[00:23:09.495 --> 00:23:11.017]  To have a sex life again?
[00:23:11.017 --> 00:23:16.402]  All these benefits and more can be yours when your body heals itself with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.

[00:24:22.907 --> 00:24:25.010]  We are back live at the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.554]  I am Jason Burmess, sitting in Alex on assignment in Dallas.
[00:24:28.554 --> 00:24:29.575]  He'll be calling in later.
[00:24:29.575 --> 00:24:33.380]  We got three power-packed guests, but I want to remind people in this short segment...
[00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:43.364]  That we are documentary filmmakers here, that we do have specials right now at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV, especially PrisonPlanet.TV for only $40.
[00:24:43.364 --> 00:24:50.847]  You get 12 full months of this program, of my program that airs 6 to 9 on Sundays, in video.
[00:24:50.847 --> 00:24:52.867]  You get all of our documentary films.
[00:24:52.867 --> 00:24:55.668]  I've got a new film coming out soon called Invisible Empire.
[00:24:55.668 --> 00:24:56.329]  Very proud of that.
[00:24:56.329 --> 00:25:00.070]  You get the latest Fall of the Republic, The Obama Deception.
[00:25:01.383 --> 00:25:03.290]  Nothing bigger on the web, folks.
[00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:04.515]  You get them in high quality.
[00:25:05.473 --> 00:25:07.554]  And you can get the DVDs right now.
[00:25:07.554 --> 00:25:14.238]  You can get four of the biggest DVDs that InfoWars offers, including 9-11 Chronicles, Endgame, Obama Deception, and Fall of the Republic.
[00:25:14.238 --> 00:25:19.322]  Comes with a free t-shirt for only $44.95 if you ask for the special.
[00:25:19.322 --> 00:25:21.083]  We've got other great specials out there.
[00:25:21.083 --> 00:25:23.344]  In fact, we're going to get into 9-11 Truth a little bit later.
[00:25:23.344 --> 00:25:30.769]  Talk about that CBC Fifth Estate program, which is really the fairest piece on 9-11 Truth that I've seen out of the mainstream.
[00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:32.370]  That's the Canadian Broadcasting Company.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.861]  And they did not worship popular mechanics.
[00:25:35.861 --> 00:25:39.422]  They called him out a little bit, and we're going to call them out further later in the program.
[00:25:39.422 --> 00:25:40.702]  Play some clips there.
[00:25:40.702 --> 00:25:44.283]  Play a clip of John Farmer saying that the 9-11 Commission was a farce.
[00:25:44.283 --> 00:25:48.024]  He's like, well, I do empathize with 9-11 truth a little bit.
[00:25:48.024 --> 00:25:53.486]  I mean, we didn't tell something that was the truth, but then he won't even get into the, uh, controlled demolition argument.
[00:25:53.486 --> 00:25:55.766]  All those are conspiracy theories.
[00:25:55.766 --> 00:25:59.427]  But if you want to know what really happened on 9-11, you can do so for only five dollars.
[00:25:59.427 --> 00:26:00.628]  Five dollars.
[00:26:01.408 --> 00:26:07.194]  Over at Infowars.com right now, you can get Loose Change Final Cut, the definitive movie in the Loose Change series.
[00:26:07.194 --> 00:26:09.916]  Over two hours, we've got extras in there.
[00:26:09.916 --> 00:26:12.358]  This one really goes through the physical anomalies.
[00:26:12.358 --> 00:26:19.865]  And if you want to see the International Intelligence Organization that carried out 9-11, if you want to see who was arrested on that day from the Israeli operatives,
[00:26:20.566 --> 00:26:23.009]  To the Pakistanis that funded the operation.
[00:26:23.009 --> 00:26:30.076]  To the Saudi Arabians that were really a CIA front group giving visas to these hijackers while they were trained at US military bases.
[00:26:30.076 --> 00:26:37.784]  And the shadow government, the E4Bs, are actually caught on video during the war games on the morning of 9-11 at the site of the attacks.
[00:26:37.784 --> 00:26:38.665]  Get fabled enemies.
[00:26:40.106 --> 00:26:44.908]  All right, let's get back into this climate gate because it is so important to understand.
[00:26:44.908 --> 00:26:50.150]  This scientist, Bill Jones, is now stepping down, stepping down.
[00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:53.951]  Penn State is going to do an investigation.
[00:26:53.951 --> 00:26:58.093]  And let's read this one right here because this is big.
[00:26:58.093 --> 00:27:00.714]  Penn State will investigate climate gate.
[00:27:00.714 --> 00:27:06.396]  Among other things, the Watergate scandal of the 1970s gave us great naming convention for future scandals.
[00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:09.451]  Take ClimateGate at Penn State.
[00:27:09.451 --> 00:27:19.015]  That's what people are calling the controversy surrounding leaked emails among climate change researchers that climate change opponents say exposed the researchers' falsification of data.
[00:27:19.015 --> 00:27:23.017]  Which it does!
[00:27:23.017 --> 00:27:29.260]  Again, you don't dump the raw data if it actually makes your case.
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.940]  They hid this data for years.
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.222]  They dumped it after the fact because they knew how bad that would be.
[00:27:35.782 --> 00:27:41.747]  And luckily, we either had an inside whistleblower or somebody handy with a computer who has exposed the truth on this.
[00:27:41.747 --> 00:27:47.952]  And remember, the leftists want to focus on, oh, these emails were hacked, we need more cyber security, let's pass that act.
[00:27:47.952 --> 00:27:49.613]  Let's pass the Cyber Bullying Act.
[00:27:49.613 --> 00:27:55.118]  We need more draconian laws so we can bring in our world government of peace.
[00:27:55.118 --> 00:27:58.460]  Meanwhile, their leftist puppet just announced, again,
[00:27:59.601 --> 00:28:03.825]  34,000 more troops in Afghanistan.
[00:28:03.825 --> 00:28:05.627]  It doesn't matter on the campaign trail.
[00:28:05.627 --> 00:28:10.712]  He said, if I'm elected president, we will start bringing troops home immediately.
[00:28:10.712 --> 00:28:18.599]  Now he says, we're going to put 34,000 more in there, and they've already been escalating this slowly but surely since his inception.
[00:28:18.599 --> 00:28:20.100]  2,000 here, 3,000 there, 4,000 there, 7,000 here.
[00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:30.272]  And we've been reporting on it here at Infowars.com, on the Alex Jones Show, on the Infowarrior with Jason Bermas, telling you the truth.
[00:28:30.272 --> 00:28:32.433]  We knew he was a warmonger.
[00:28:32.433 --> 00:28:35.114]  We knew he worked for the elite.
[00:28:35.114 --> 00:28:43.297]  We knew that he would just continue the same, same policies, both foreign and domestic, of the Bush administration.
[00:28:43.973 --> 00:28:47.554]  See, they start blowing out the economy at the end of the Bush administration.
[00:28:47.554 --> 00:28:50.195]  He makes a slight apology.
[00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:53.476]  Obama comes to the people and he says, well, we need to pass these bailouts.
[00:28:53.476 --> 00:28:57.518]  We need to do all these things that are also going to gut the economy.
[00:28:57.518 --> 00:28:59.338]  Meanwhile, we'll stay in the wars, as I tell you.
[00:28:59.338 --> 00:29:01.799]  No, we'll withdraw the troops immediately.
[00:29:01.799 --> 00:29:04.260]  Now he's putting 34,000 more, but with the spin that in 18 months,
[00:29:08.493 --> 00:29:10.574]  He'll start bringing troops home.
[00:29:10.574 --> 00:29:12.115]  No actual plan.
[00:29:12.115 --> 00:29:14.156]  No actual numbers.
[00:29:14.156 --> 00:29:21.699]  But now they're saying, oh, we have an actual plan eight years later in Afghanistan.
[00:29:21.699 --> 00:29:23.961]  How wild is that?
[00:29:23.961 --> 00:29:26.562]  And the suckers out there are buying it.
[00:29:27.748 --> 00:29:29.109]  What happened to Code Pink?
[00:29:29.109 --> 00:29:30.831]  What happened to MoveOn.org?
[00:29:30.831 --> 00:29:32.833]  What happened to the anti-war movement?
[00:29:32.833 --> 00:29:39.559]  The only person I see of any substance that came out of that, that can see through the lies of the left and the right, is Cindy Sheehan!
[00:29:39.559 --> 00:29:40.920]  We'll be back after this.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.801]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:42.802]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[00:29:42.802 --> 00:29:44.003]  Alex, coming up.
[00:29:44.003 --> 00:29:51.089]  PrisonPlan.TV, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:52.490]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.992]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.984 --> 00:30:01.468]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.468 --> 00:30:05.491]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.491 --> 00:30:08.733]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:08.733 --> 00:30:13.536]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:30:13.536 --> 00:30:19.920]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.162]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:22.702 --> 00:30:24.102]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:30:24.102 --> 00:30:24.843]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:24.843 --> 00:30:26.963]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:41.587 --> 00:30:48.875]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:30:48.875 --> 00:30:58.004]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:31:00.006 --> 00:31:09.155]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[00:31:09.155 --> 00:31:12.539]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[00:31:12.539 --> 00:31:18.404]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[00:31:18.404 --> 00:31:22.889]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[00:31:23.169 --> 00:31:34.995]  Oxysilver safely electrocutes pathogens, oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[00:31:34.995 --> 00:31:40.537]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[00:31:40.537 --> 00:31:42.378]  Help others and earn extra income!
[00:31:42.398 --> 00:31:42.618]  I think so.
[00:32:00.643 --> 00:32:03.665]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:03.665 --> 00:32:08.990]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:11.051]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:11.051 --> 00:32:16.055]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:16.055 --> 00:32:16.956]  How much do you want?
[00:32:17.216 --> 00:32:18.337]  When do you want it?
[00:32:18.337 --> 00:32:20.218]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:20.218 --> 00:32:21.299]  When will you need it?
[00:32:21.299 --> 00:32:23.500]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.841]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:24.841 --> 00:32:26.362]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:26.362 --> 00:32:31.646]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:31.646 --> 00:32:35.228]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:35.228 --> 00:32:38.691]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:39.031 --> 00:32:40.272]  How much will you need?
[00:32:40.272 --> 00:32:41.172]  We don't know.
[00:32:41.172 --> 00:32:42.273]  How much do you want?
[00:32:42.273 --> 00:32:43.194]  All you can get.
[00:32:43.194 --> 00:32:44.294]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:44.294 --> 00:32:47.336]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:47.336 --> 00:32:50.198]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:50.198 --> 00:32:51.018]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:51.018 --> 00:32:54.500]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:07.503 --> 00:33:16.125]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:16.125 --> 00:33:17.225]  We are back live.
[00:33:17.225 --> 00:33:18.185]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.185 --> 00:33:19.406]  I am Jason Verma sitting in.
[00:33:19.406 --> 00:33:20.266]  Alex on assignment.
[00:33:20.266 --> 00:33:22.466]  He'll be calling in shortly at the top of the hour.
[00:33:22.466 --> 00:33:32.268]  We have former Navy SEAL Jim O'Neill, who's written a great piece on how to take these bastards on, how to sue for climategate, how to actually prosecute these people.
[00:33:32.268 --> 00:33:33.949]  And we're going to get into that in a moment.
[00:33:33.949 --> 00:33:34.409]  Inhofe
[00:33:35.049 --> 00:33:39.790]  Is asking Barbara Boxer to investigate possible scientific conspiracy and climate change.
[00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:40.991]  What do you mean possible?
[00:33:40.991 --> 00:33:42.951]  The data speaks for itself.
[00:33:42.951 --> 00:33:44.712]  They are liars.
[00:33:44.712 --> 00:33:51.234]  They want to tax you for breathing, for being here on God's green earth.
[00:33:51.234 --> 00:33:53.374]  Don't you understand what this is about?
[00:33:53.374 --> 00:33:59.596]  Again, the dumbed-down populace is buying into carbon dioxide as a taxable substance.
[00:33:59.596 --> 00:34:01.997]  Something they can't see, something they can't feel.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:06.664]  It almost feels like an episode of The Twilight Zone.
[00:34:06.664 --> 00:34:09.948]  And none of their science proves their quote-unquote theory.
[00:34:09.948 --> 00:34:11.170]  It's not a theory.
[00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:13.212]  It's a way to shake you down.
[00:34:13.212 --> 00:34:16.136]  And again, Penn State will investigate Climategate.
[00:34:16.136 --> 00:34:21.342]  The Penn State administration plans to investigate Climategate and determine if it needs to take further action.
[00:34:21.342 --> 00:34:23.164]  The Daily Collision reports.
[00:34:24.025 --> 00:34:31.589]  A little more than a week ago, emails exchanged among English University's climate change researchers were illegally obtained from a server and posted online.
[00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:35.812]  The report says, Oh, the bad hackers exposed the truth.
[00:34:35.812 --> 00:34:39.074]  They were only going to tax the entire world population.
[00:34:39.074 --> 00:34:41.855]  Oh, wait, they're still going to the Copenhagen summit.
[00:34:41.855 --> 00:34:44.097]  They're still going to try to do this.
[00:34:45.891 --> 00:34:55.545]  Robert Gibbs says they don't matter because most people still believe in climate change, in man-made climate change that's taxable.
[00:34:55.545 --> 00:34:56.807]  That's the real deal.
[00:34:56.807 --> 00:35:00.192]  And we're going to play some of the Obama speech from last night in Afghanistan coming up.
[00:35:01.684 --> 00:35:10.511]  And it's towards the end, I'm only going to play a minute or so of it, but he kind of reveals himself and then just uses a big, fat lie to drum it up.
[00:35:10.511 --> 00:35:16.976]  He starts talking about how the United States has really brought in globalization, talks about the United Nations and the World Bank.
[00:35:16.976 --> 00:35:20.459]  And then he says, well, we haven't always been thanked for our efforts.
[00:35:20.459 --> 00:35:27.525]  And then he says, but unlike the powers of the past, we have never sought world domination.
[00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:28.326]  Is that a joke?
[00:35:29.505 --> 00:35:37.307]  You right now are assisting the globalists, militarily by the way, and not by, you're the front group!
[00:35:37.307 --> 00:35:50.910]  That's not my military out there killing brown people for their resources, for their opium, for their oil, for Eurasian Union they will plan to build out of that.
[00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:52.751]  That's not my America.
[00:35:52.751 --> 00:35:56.992]  And he says that we've never done this, we've never taken another nation's resources.
[00:35:58.219 --> 00:35:59.483]  I mean, I couldn't believe this.
[00:35:59.483 --> 00:36:01.611]  So we're going to play that for you in a moment.
[00:36:01.611 --> 00:36:04.199]  Let's finish up with this Penn State will investigate climategate.
[00:36:06.479 --> 00:36:15.206]  Climate change opponents say the emails indicate that climate change researchers, including Penn State professor Michael Mann, exaggerated or fabricated global warming data.
[00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:24.174]  And according to the report, some emails indicate that the director of the research unit in question may have contacted researchers and asked them to delete certain emails.
[00:36:24.174 --> 00:36:25.034]  Of course they did.
[00:36:25.034 --> 00:36:29.258]  Penn State officials, who will not discuss the matter, are investigating the controversy.
[00:36:29.258 --> 00:36:34.582]  If anything requires further inspection, the school will handle it, a spokesman tells the Daily Collision.
[00:36:34.582 --> 00:36:35.323]  Well, I sure hope so.
[00:36:35.603 --> 00:36:42.667]  A panel will read every email leaked and determine if climate change critics have any ground for their accusations, the report says.
[00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:51.352]  I would be disappointed if the university wasn't doing all it can to get as much information as possible about the controversy, man tells the Daily Copenhagen.
[00:36:51.352 --> 00:36:53.313]  See, man's trying to play the victim.
[00:36:53.313 --> 00:36:56.194]  Oh, they stole my emails!
[00:36:56.194 --> 00:36:59.056]  They stole my emails!
[00:36:59.056 --> 00:37:02.118]  Well, let's hope it gets taken a step further.
[00:37:02.118 --> 00:37:02.718]  A step up.
[00:37:04.514 --> 00:37:10.342]  Inhofe asks Boxer to investigate possible scientific conspiracy in Climategate.
[00:37:10.342 --> 00:37:15.710]  Senator James Inhofe, out of Oklahoma, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works,
[00:37:16.644 --> 00:37:28.788]  He's calling on Chairman Barbara Boxer to conduct hearings on a possible conspiracy between some of the world's most prominent climatologists to, among other things, manipulate data on so-called global warming.
[00:37:28.788 --> 00:37:38.791]  Inhofe said the recent disclosure of emails between several prominent climatologists reveal possible deceitful manipulation of important data and research used by the U.S.
[00:37:38.791 --> 00:37:39.451]  Global Change
[00:37:40.682 --> 00:37:51.373]  And the UN's, here it is, the UN's IPCC, which is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
[00:37:51.373 --> 00:37:54.676]  It is about global government.
[00:37:54.676 --> 00:37:57.579]  And once again, thank you Australia.
[00:37:57.579 --> 00:37:59.561]  Thank you for voting down.
[00:38:00.475 --> 00:38:02.978]  The ETS, the Emissions Trading Standard over there.
[00:38:02.978 --> 00:38:06.381]  Thank you for dealing another blow to the globalists.
[00:38:06.381 --> 00:38:09.304]  You think Kevin Rudd's not going to go to the Copenhagen Treaty?
[00:38:09.304 --> 00:38:10.325]  Oh, he's going.
[00:38:10.325 --> 00:38:12.047]  And he's signing on.
[00:38:12.047 --> 00:38:15.310]  It doesn't matter that these emails are out there to the elitists, to the globalists.
[00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:16.871]  They're going to try to push forward.
[00:38:17.796 --> 00:38:25.378]  That's why we have to put pressure on our local representatives, our state officials, and say, no, we are not going to stand for this.
[00:38:25.378 --> 00:38:29.979]  These people need to be investigated and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
[00:38:29.979 --> 00:38:34.481]  And we're going to be discussing that big time with Jim O'Neill, former U.S.
[00:38:34.481 --> 00:38:35.161]  Navy SEAL.
[00:38:35.161 --> 00:38:40.622]  His article up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:38:40.622 --> 00:38:45.104]  We are now going to go to Alex Jones, who's on assignment out in Dallas.
[00:38:45.104 --> 00:38:45.824]  Alex, how are you today?
[00:38:47.739 --> 00:38:50.601]  How am I coming in to you from downtown Dallas?
[00:38:50.601 --> 00:38:51.822]  Loud and clear, sir.
[00:38:51.822 --> 00:38:52.962]  Good, as I drive around.
[00:38:52.962 --> 00:38:55.944]  A little bit colder here than it is in Austin.
[00:38:55.944 --> 00:38:58.085]  Well, several issues to discuss.
[00:38:58.085 --> 00:39:07.911]  Obviously, I wanted to chime in today with the situation with Obama's troop surge for Central Asia and Afghanistan.
[00:39:07.911 --> 00:39:09.632]  But first, I wanted to get into Climategate.
[00:39:09.632 --> 00:39:12.454]  You were just discussing Climategate.
[00:39:14.068 --> 00:39:24.232]  A week and a half ago, when I literally popped champagne on the radio show, on the Sunday broadcast, I knew that that was the equivalent of getting the Death Star planned.
[00:39:24.232 --> 00:39:42.839]  Now, the Death Star has blown up, but the Empire is still there, but this is a major morale booster for everybody that loves truth and liberty and integrity, and it is literally the beginning of the end of the New World Order if we all do our part in educating everyone about this fraud.
[00:39:44.953 --> 00:39:47.055]  of the world government system.
[00:39:47.055 --> 00:39:55.220]  According to the head of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, Van Rompuy, all of them, is this global carbon tax system.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:40:02.866]  And that's only one element, but the overall fraud that global warming or climate change period is caused by man.
[00:40:02.866 --> 00:40:10.631]  For years, scientists and research laboratories would compile their own data and it didn't show, since the 60s, what
[00:40:11.491 --> 00:40:12.832]  At the time, the U.N.
[00:40:12.832 --> 00:40:17.714]  was saying the Earth was going into an ice age, when they said, no, it's actually warming.
[00:40:17.714 --> 00:40:23.397]  And then by the 90s, they said, OK, it's heating, because we were in a heating trend.
[00:40:23.397 --> 00:40:25.978]  And the scientists said, yes, but that's not man-made.
[00:40:25.978 --> 00:40:27.479]  That's the sun and other factors.
[00:40:28.673 --> 00:40:44.083]  And then in the last nine years, it's been dramatically cooling, according to all the major weather stations that actually have the devices, thermometers and other devices, to keep computerized records.
[00:40:44.083 --> 00:40:56.231]  And so for those that don't know, yesterday Bill Jones, the head climatologist for the UN, this is the research lab where all the world's data was collated by the UN and where it was cooked.
[00:40:56.798 --> 00:41:13.244]  Everyone knows we have their internal emails, we have their internal computer programs they use with notes by the programmers in the programs for future programmers that have problems, how to carry out the fraud, how to persecute scientists, how to persecute peer-reviewed journals, how to get people fired.
[00:41:13.244 --> 00:41:23.167]  So that's a whole other criminal area right there, not just hiding the decline, fixing the data, manipulating it, and hiding the fact that the world's been getting colder.
[00:41:23.925 --> 00:41:26.908]  For the last nine to ten years, they began to panic.
[00:41:26.908 --> 00:41:35.497]  Well now, Bill Jones, the head ringleader of the scientists, who was recruited by the United Nations, we now have those internal documents.
[00:41:35.497 --> 00:41:39.041]  It's more and more spills out to go out and recruit others for fraud.
[00:41:40.347 --> 00:41:42.250]  He is now stepping down.
[00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:46.976]  First, it was three members of the number two party in Australia.
[00:41:46.976 --> 00:41:49.360]  Now it's five members who have resigned.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:54.928]  Others are stepping down in disgust over what their own party's been pushing with the climate tax they've already passed.
[00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.431]  Over there, that hooks into the U.N.
[00:41:57.431 --> 00:41:58.291]  system.
[00:41:58.291 --> 00:42:13.174]  There are investigations in New Zealand, in Canada, in the U.S., with all the major national weather services caught integrating the fraud, fixing their data on their end, in line with the Climate Research Center in East Anglia, England.
[00:42:13.174 --> 00:42:15.675]  So, this is only the beginning.
[00:42:15.675 --> 00:42:23.477]  Just like when the police pull somebody over for speeding, and there's blood in the backseat, so they pop the trunk, and they find a woman with her head severed in the back,
[00:42:24.557 --> 00:42:25.698]  That was Climategate.
[00:42:25.698 --> 00:42:32.742]  That was the documents being leaked by, it's clear now, inside staffers who didn't want to be part of the fraud.
[00:42:32.742 --> 00:42:39.606]  Then they go to the farmhouse, and that's what's happening now, and they're digging up hundreds of bodies.
[00:42:39.606 --> 00:42:44.129]  And so new bodies are popping up every day, new crimes, evidence of the crimes.
[00:42:45.416 --> 00:42:45.656]  Are you?
[00:43:08.158 --> 00:43:16.705]  Al Gore admits it's a religious cult, which the humans said in the 70s they were going to use, and again in 96 in their biological diversity assessment, that man likes religions.
[00:43:16.705 --> 00:43:26.272]  They would package a neo-eugenical religion around exterminating humans and restricting our numbers and one-child policies.
[00:43:26.272 --> 00:43:30.155]  So, literally, they are burning to the ground.
[00:43:30.155 --> 00:43:34.999]  They tried to ignore it, they tried to spin it, but the emails, the computer programs, the documents,
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:42.984]  The university investigations going on in Canada, England, Australia, New Zealand, Germany are so devastating.
[00:43:42.984 --> 00:43:47.987]  A whole bunch of different professors are about to be kicked out.
[00:43:47.987 --> 00:43:49.769]  They're about to lose their tenure.
[00:43:49.769 --> 00:43:52.030]  That's happening in Pennsylvania.
[00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:53.231]  That's happening in Toronto.
[00:43:53.231 --> 00:43:54.571]  It's happening in London.
[00:43:54.571 --> 00:43:56.493]  It's happening in Perth.
[00:43:56.493 --> 00:43:57.013]  It's happening
[00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:27.155]  Literally everywhere, as the rats leave the sinking ship, and guaranteed, it's already happening, more leaks are going to happen, more documents are going to come out, more evidence, more whistleblowers, more people that don't want to go to prison, because it's criminal, are now starting to blow the whistle, because you're talking about a global human program, and their documents came out two days ago, where they've orchestrated this for world government, for global government, and as a world pact, so everyone should rejoice at this, right ahead of Copenhagen,
[00:44:28.198 --> 00:44:36.061]  But at the same time, not just rejoice at what's happening, but redouble, and then redouble, and then redouble, and then redouble, and then redouble.
[00:44:36.061 --> 00:44:38.062]  Because we've been given a spirit of weakness.
[00:44:38.062 --> 00:44:40.303]  We've been given a spirit of not having victory.
[00:44:40.303 --> 00:44:43.944]  We've been given a mindset, an idea, an outlook that we're powerless.
[00:44:43.944 --> 00:44:50.787]  The globalists have always drilled us into our heads because they know we are incredibly powerful, incredibly dynamic.
[00:44:51.915 --> 00:44:58.240]  When we have truth on our side, which we do, and so this is a wondrous thing that is happening.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.481]  This is only the beginning.
[00:44:59.481 --> 00:45:02.504]  Lord Monckton, next Monday and Tuesday, he's going to be reporting live.
[00:45:02.504 --> 00:45:05.667]  We just confirmed this morning, talking to his wife.
[00:45:05.667 --> 00:45:16.636]  He's going to be reporting to us live next week from the Copenhagen-Denmark Global Government-Global Tax Treaty, where they admit they took over all the banking, all the systems, give it all to the IMF.
[00:45:16.636 --> 00:45:20.559]  This couldn't have come out at a better time, and it turns out six and a half weeks ago at East Anglia,
[00:45:21.804 --> 00:45:23.606]  Researchers there were very upset.
[00:45:23.606 --> 00:45:26.448]  That's in some of the emails, saying, you can't hide this for you.
[00:45:26.448 --> 00:45:27.609]  You can't lie.
[00:45:27.609 --> 00:45:29.230]  We shouldn't have done this.
[00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:42.341]  And now all the smart money is on the fact that junior researchers and scientists and doctors and climatologists at that huge center are the ones that released this, that it was directly, quote, stolen.
[00:45:42.341 --> 00:45:45.323]  What is the people's data out of the system?
[00:45:45.323 --> 00:45:49.947]  Also, in the emails, they're talking to different government officials in England and the U.S.
[00:45:49.947 --> 00:45:50.668]  about how to block
[00:45:51.758 --> 00:45:52.139]  We're good.
[00:45:59.377 --> 00:46:07.099]  Keep drumming, keep beating the drum of truth, keep emailing everyone, keep getting the stories from InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com.
[00:46:07.099 --> 00:46:10.740]  We have links up there to Lord Monckton's Climategate breakdown paper.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.181]  He's written that it's stunningly powerful and condenses everything.
[00:46:14.181 --> 00:46:21.663]  He's barely even been sleeping, I'm told, to put this together, this compendium of the latest fraud and the history of their fraud.
[00:46:21.663 --> 00:46:26.224]  We are witnessing history right now as the Stalinistic, Hitlerian, Maoistic,
[00:46:26.744 --> 00:46:27.305]  We're good.
[00:46:41.767 --> 00:46:44.909]  Absolutely, Alex, and we have more victories than that.
[00:46:44.909 --> 00:46:47.110]  Penn State will investigate Climategate.
[00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:52.994]  Inhofe asks Boxer to start an investigation on possible scientific conspiracy in Climategate.
[00:46:52.994 --> 00:46:56.716]  And just yesterday, the Australia carbon laws failed.
[00:46:56.716 --> 00:46:59.938]  The emissions trading scheme went down in Parliament.
[00:46:59.938 --> 00:47:06.182]  People are waking up, yet our leaders still are marching towards this treaty as if nothing is happening.
[00:47:06.182 --> 00:47:11.165]  Gibbs is saying in the press room, that's the president's secretary, his press secretary,
[00:47:11.465 --> 00:47:16.308]  He's saying that it doesn't matter because most people still believe in climate change, Alex.
[00:47:16.308 --> 00:47:19.610]  Well, notice, that's a fraud hidden in plain view right there.
[00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:22.071]  First, it was global freezing in the 60s.
[00:47:22.071 --> 00:47:24.873]  Then, by the 80s and 90s, it was global warming.
[00:47:24.873 --> 00:47:35.199]  Now, what, six months ago in the New York Times, their own demos came out where the White House was saying, now say climate change, deteriorating atmosphere, the oceans are going to turn to acid.
[00:47:35.199 --> 00:47:37.441]  You know, basically Chicken Little.
[00:47:37.441 --> 00:47:39.022]  They are caught red-handed.
[00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:40.723]  This is the equivalent of 20
[00:47:42.219 --> 00:47:45.481]  High-powered torpedoes hitting their aircraft carrier.
[00:47:45.481 --> 00:47:51.406]  Their aircraft carrier magazine, where all the armaments are stored, just blew up like a fireworks factory.
[00:47:51.406 --> 00:47:53.768]  And this is just absolutely devastating.
[00:47:53.768 --> 00:47:56.450]  Now, here's the bad news.
[00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:58.952]  Washington state's already taxing business owners.
[00:47:58.952 --> 00:48:01.433]  They have to track their employees.
[00:48:01.433 --> 00:48:03.975]  They take the train, the bus, or the car.
[00:48:03.975 --> 00:48:06.337]  They tax them depending on what they take.
[00:48:06.337 --> 00:48:08.839]  The federal government and multiple states, including Texas,
[00:48:09.688 --> 00:48:10.188]  I think so.
[00:48:27.136 --> 00:48:27.576]  We're good to go.
[00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:50.271]  We're brainwashing their children.
[00:48:50.271 --> 00:48:53.473]  The kids are coming home, paddling on their parents, riding a mock ticket.
[00:48:53.473 --> 00:48:54.773]  They're giving the kids uniforms.
[00:48:54.773 --> 00:48:58.395]  Worldwide, they are literally taking over our children.
[00:48:58.395 --> 00:49:02.198]  We are simply winning a major battle right now, but the war is on.
[00:49:03.434 --> 00:49:05.855]  And we have to root them out of the school district.
[00:49:05.855 --> 00:49:07.576]  We have to root them out of the colleges.
[00:49:07.576 --> 00:49:09.317]  We have to shout these frauds down everywhere.
[00:49:09.317 --> 00:49:11.418]  That's why it's so beautiful.
[00:49:11.418 --> 00:49:12.619]  We've got them on tomorrow.
[00:49:12.619 --> 00:49:22.463]  What We Are Change Chicago did when they did the best job I've ever seen of exposing him face-to-face in front of all the media for Climategate and Al Gore getting red in the face.
[00:49:22.463 --> 00:49:25.825]  This is now happening everywhere they go.
[00:49:25.825 --> 00:49:27.806]  This is just so amazing.
[00:49:28.186 --> 00:49:32.752]  To see people taking action, getting involved, and standing up against this corruption.
[00:49:32.752 --> 00:49:34.314]  But the battle is now on!
[00:49:34.314 --> 00:49:35.516]  The royal...
[00:49:36.405 --> 00:49:37.806]  Rumble is now on.
[00:49:37.806 --> 00:49:38.487]  We're going to go to break.
[00:49:38.487 --> 00:49:42.629]  I'm going to come back for five minutes and talk about Afghanistan, and then let Jason do his next guest.
[00:49:42.629 --> 00:49:45.471]  I appreciate you sitting in on Fort Notice, Jason.
[00:49:45.471 --> 00:49:47.873]  But I also want to put a plug in for Fall of the Republic.
[00:49:47.873 --> 00:50:03.364]  Fall of the Republic, an hour of the two-hour, 24-minute film, is about the climate fraud, how it's really eugenics, and how people are noticing that Michael Crichton wrote a big essay before he died about how climate cult is really a eugenics cult.
[00:50:04.048 --> 00:50:10.253]  Anybody who's a researcher, from the left, right, it doesn't matter, is now discovering this.
[00:50:10.253 --> 00:50:12.756]  And our listeners are getting the word out about this.
[00:50:12.756 --> 00:50:20.602]  And so by exposing Climategate, their entire eugenics, global population reduction scheme has been blown sky high.
[00:50:20.602 --> 00:50:23.525]  It is a chain reaction, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:23.525 --> 00:50:28.609]  Everyone could feel the victory, the spirit of liberty, the spirit of truth and integrity, literally and
[00:50:29.975 --> 00:50:30.916]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:50:30.916 --> 00:50:32.977]  The emails speak for themselves.
[00:50:32.977 --> 00:50:37.519]  The fact that these scientists dumped the raw data speaks for itself.
[00:50:37.519 --> 00:50:40.341]  If the data proved what they said, they would have kept that data.
[00:50:40.341 --> 00:50:43.383]  No, they had to keep it out of the hands of the truth.
[00:50:43.383 --> 00:50:44.604]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:44.604 --> 00:50:47.565]  I am Jason Burma, sitting in Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:01.104 --> 00:51:03.207]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:51:03.207 --> 00:51:09.074]  More than half the world's doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:51:09.074 --> 00:51:18.084]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations, especially this flu season.
[00:51:18.084 --> 00:51:19.967]  Rely on OxySilver instead.
[00:51:20.931 --> 00:51:26.774]  OxySilver's broad spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[00:51:26.774 --> 00:51:30.056]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol.
[00:51:30.056 --> 00:51:32.438]  Far safer than colloidal silvers.
[00:51:32.438 --> 00:51:37.321]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[00:51:37.321 --> 00:51:41.063]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[00:51:41.063 --> 00:51:43.304]  So get it while you still can.
[00:51:43.304 --> 00:51:46.086]  Order OxySilver online at OxySilver.com.
[00:51:47.196 --> 00:51:50.799]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[00:51:50.799 --> 00:51:53.922]  Call toll-free 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:51:53.922 --> 00:51:56.564]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:51:56.564 --> 00:51:58.265]  Order OxySilver today.
[00:51:58.265 --> 00:52:01.889]  This call could save your life.
[00:52:01.889 --> 00:52:05.572]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.572 --> 00:52:09.155]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.155 --> 00:52:10.556]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.449 --> 00:52:13.930]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:20.332]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.332 --> 00:52:25.854]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.854 --> 00:52:35.498]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.618 --> 00:52:37.959]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:37.959 --> 00:52:39.560]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.021]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.021 --> 00:52:44.142]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.142 --> 00:52:49.285]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.285 --> 00:52:54.287]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:53:00.495 --> 00:53:04.036]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:53:04.036 --> 00:53:06.317]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:53:06.317 --> 00:53:07.197]  Don't!
[00:53:07.197 --> 00:53:10.639]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:53:10.639 --> 00:53:17.761]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:53:17.741 --> 00:53:19.722]  's number one debt secret.
[00:53:19.722 --> 00:53:23.383]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:53:23.783 --> 00:53:26.925]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:53:26.925 --> 00:53:34.288]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:53:34.288 --> 00:53:35.489]  Herb K was right.
[00:53:35.489 --> 00:53:38.670]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:40.031]  What have you got to lose?
[00:53:40.031 --> 00:53:43.733]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[00:53:43.733 --> 00:53:47.675]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[00:53:47.675 --> 00:53:48.035]  Call 888-352-7726.
[00:53:52.117 --> 00:53:58.000]  That's 888-352-7726.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.502]  888-352-7726.
[00:54:02.502 --> 00:54:07.404]  Our country has borne a special burden in global affairs.
[00:54:07.404 --> 00:54:12.867]  We have spilled American blood in many countries on multiple continents.
[00:54:12.867 --> 00:54:17.189]  We have spent our revenue to help others rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies.
[00:54:18.999 --> 00:54:31.751]  We have joined with others to develop an architecture of institutions from the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank that provide for the common security and prosperity of human beings.
[00:54:31.751 --> 00:54:34.893]  We have not always been thanked for these efforts.
[00:54:34.893 --> 00:54:38.617]  And we have at times made mistakes.
[00:54:38.617 --> 00:54:45.223]  But more than any other nation, the United States of America has underwritten global security for over six decades.
[00:54:47.248 --> 00:55:01.072]  A time that for all its problems has seen walls come down, and markets open, and billions lifted from poverty, unparalleled scientific progress, and advancing frontiers of human liberty.
[00:55:01.072 --> 00:55:07.134]  For unlike the great powers of old, we have not sought world domination.
[00:55:07.134 --> 00:55:11.815]  Our union was founded in resistance to oppression.
[00:55:11.815 --> 00:55:13.776]  We do not seek to occupy other nations.
[00:55:14.884 --> 00:55:21.770]  We will not claim another nation's resources or target other people's because their faith or ethnicity is different.
[00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:23.851]  There he is just spouting his propaganda.
[00:55:23.851 --> 00:55:24.732]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:55:24.732 --> 00:55:26.013]  I'm Jason Burmas sitting in.
[00:55:26.013 --> 00:55:28.675]  And what did you think about that, Alex?
[00:55:28.675 --> 00:55:30.657]  Well, it's off the charts.
[00:55:30.657 --> 00:55:37.382]  I mean, the United States that is the banks that hijacked us in 1913 and 1945 created the United Nations, the Presidio Naval Station.
[00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:43.752]  In San Francisco, our government created the World Bank and runs it.
[00:55:43.752 --> 00:55:45.673]  Our government created NACO.
[00:55:45.673 --> 00:55:47.794]  It's used as part of the global imperium.
[00:55:47.794 --> 00:55:57.041]  We have hundreds of internal Pentagon documents, the PNAC documents written by Nick Cheney, saying we're an empire, saying we're here for global domination.
[00:55:57.041 --> 00:56:06.808]  Henry Kissinger, the big name resentee, the main advisors on foreign policy to Barack Obama admit we're an empire in multiple books that he's written, like the Grand Chess Board and others, and countless speeches.
[00:56:07.598 --> 00:56:11.061]  Uh, he sits there and says, we're not a tool of global domination.
[00:56:11.061 --> 00:56:14.564]  And he plays that mind game of going, we're angry with the UN.
[00:56:15.257 --> 00:56:18.558]  And the World Bank and NATO, because they don't appreciate us.
[00:56:18.558 --> 00:56:21.698]  So the average American goes, yeah, he doesn't like the UN.
[00:56:21.698 --> 00:56:27.520]  This is the guy who's still currently the only sitting president to ever be the head of the UN Security Council.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:30.940]  This is the guy allowing their foreign corporate creation.
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:38.122]  They built the UN as an offshore corporate crime syndicate to then come in and hijack the United States that built it to begin with.
[00:56:39.085 --> 00:56:47.538]  The Federal Reserve has created its own international government so it can cede authority directly to a government that's illegitimate that it created.
[00:56:48.195 --> 00:56:50.035]  Obviously we're occupying Iraq.
[00:56:50.035 --> 00:56:55.856]  Obviously the globalists are using American muscle and blood and money in Afghanistan and bankrupting us in the process.
[00:56:55.856 --> 00:56:59.357]  You know, I said months ago, not that I'm smart, I know the Pentagon game.
[00:56:59.357 --> 00:57:01.197]  Oh, we're going to be in Iraq six months.
[00:57:01.197 --> 00:57:03.178]  Oh, then two years and we'll look at it.
[00:57:03.178 --> 00:57:07.559]  Oh, we increase the troops and in another two years we'll remove those troops, but keep the original troops.
[00:57:07.559 --> 00:57:14.620]  And then he said again, oh, in two years I'll look at removing the additional 30-plus thousand, but we're always going to stay there.
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:19.482]  So it's the exact same Pentagon line greeting on the Pentagon teleprompter.
[00:57:19.482 --> 00:57:22.544]  Everything is written for him, just like George Bush.
[00:57:22.544 --> 00:57:26.846]  They put Obama in to get the left to stand down against the war.
[00:57:26.846 --> 00:57:32.710]  And notice I was watching CNN last night and they admitted, well actually Obama sent 80,000 troops, this will be 80,000.
[00:57:34.025 --> 00:57:34.946]  That's right.
[00:57:34.946 --> 00:57:42.610]  I mean, he already sent 40-something thousand in the last 11 months that no one's discussed, because the big distraction of, oh, will he have a third?
[00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:43.970]  What will he do on the war?
[00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:57.778]  Oh, you know, to give him left cover, they had the fake right in this song and dance come out and say, oh, he won't beef up the troops when they need it, when he already escalated it with NATO troops, UN troops, and 40,000-plus U.S.
[00:57:57.778 --> 00:58:00.059]  troops, now an additional 30-plus thousand.
[00:58:01.122 --> 00:58:04.283]  In three years, you watch, they're going to send even more.
[00:58:04.283 --> 00:58:07.503]  And by the way, Afghanistan is a great success.
[00:58:07.503 --> 00:58:08.723]  It is.
[00:58:08.723 --> 00:58:09.904]  It's not there for democracy.
[00:58:09.904 --> 00:58:10.984]  It's not there for freedom.
[00:58:10.984 --> 00:58:16.205]  It's there to have wars with the opium lords over the 500 million a year in opium.
[00:58:16.205 --> 00:58:18.085]  It's over the Unicole Pipeline.
[00:58:18.085 --> 00:58:20.266]  It's over the no-bid weapons contracts.
[00:58:20.266 --> 00:58:22.986]  This is a war on drugs, more drugs, more people in prison.
[00:58:22.986 --> 00:58:23.966]  Great success.
[00:58:23.966 --> 00:58:24.966]  It's meant to put you in prison.
[00:58:24.966 --> 00:58:28.267]  It's meant to keep drugs illegal so they can launder the proceeds.
[00:58:29.147 --> 00:58:30.988]  And now they're discussing a war tax.
[00:58:30.988 --> 00:58:32.369]  We'll be back after this.
[00:58:32.369 --> 00:58:42.614]  It's the Alex Jones Show, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[00:58:42.614 --> 00:58:45.235]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:57.304 --> 00:58:59.386]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[00:59:53.415 --> 00:59:55.816]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.816 --> 00:59:58.579]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.205 --> 01:00:06.527]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.527 --> 01:00:08.290]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:10.052]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.052 --> 01:00:11.634]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.634 --> 01:00:12.536]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.536 --> 01:00:17.383]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.383 --> 01:00:21.428]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.458 --> 01:00:26.760]  Clinton says Karzai must meet words with action, the same old rhetoric.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:36.185]  It doesn't matter that in the Bush administration, into the Obama administration for the past eight years, the CIA has been running drugs with Karzai's brother.
[01:00:36.185 --> 01:00:40.027]  That's right, running drugs with Karzai's brother on the opium market.
[01:00:40.027 --> 01:00:44.229]  Now we're getting tough in Afghanistan with another 34,000 troops.
[01:00:44.229 --> 01:00:45.510]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:46.950]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:47.991]  Alex, what do you think about that?
[01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:50.793]  I think so.
[01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:11.150]  So the Taliban won't get it.
[01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:15.791]  There's over a 13-fold pre-911 amount of opium.
[01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:18.372]  World records have been broken three times over.
[01:01:18.372 --> 01:01:27.034]  80-plus, almost 90% of world opium that turned into heroin and other opiate drugs pouring out of Afghanistan.
[01:01:27.034 --> 01:01:33.016]  This is a war over the $500 billion that, again, they could leverage in the banks to over $5 trillion a year.
[01:01:33.983 --> 01:01:37.984]  Again, devastating success, total precision by the Pentagon.
[01:01:37.984 --> 01:01:40.205]  They turned America into a police state.
[01:01:40.205 --> 01:01:46.487]  Obama, in his speech, was talking about where this beacon of light and hope and freedom really were worse than China on many fronts.
[01:01:46.487 --> 01:01:51.809]  G20, they would sound cannon young children out walking their dog or playing football in their front yard.
[01:01:51.809 --> 01:02:02.193]  They'd go on the university at night, spend no one's while on the streets, and beat women who were on bicycles with clubs and attack old women with police dogs coming out of grocery stores, all on video.
[01:02:02.193 --> 01:02:03.253]  I mean, this is a sick,
[01:02:03.866 --> 01:02:12.351]  Joe, America has been captured by the same offshore banks that publicly fund the carbon tax takeover and in closing on the carbon tax takeover...
[01:02:13.024 --> 01:02:23.750]  With your next guest coming up, let's not forget, hundreds of billions have been spent in the last two decades shutting up this environment cult built around these taxes that have nothing to do with the environment.
[01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:27.792]  They candy-coated reasonable things like electric cars and windmills.
[01:02:27.792 --> 01:02:29.133]  It has nothing to do with any of that.
[01:02:29.133 --> 01:02:34.036]  It's about taxing and regulating and tracking and pricing everything you do with carbon rations.
[01:02:34.036 --> 01:02:35.977]  There's no more debate, no more denial.
[01:02:36.761 --> 01:02:39.202]  They are not going to give up without one hell of a fight.
[01:02:39.202 --> 01:02:47.945]  But if we never shut up about climate change, if more and more comes out, which it is, and if we keep pointing out, you're just a bunch of fraud and criminals, and quit debating them.
[01:02:47.945 --> 01:02:49.485]  I mean, look, they put Karzai in.
[01:02:49.485 --> 01:02:51.306]  They're probing them with fake elections.
[01:02:51.306 --> 01:02:56.948]  Then our government complains about it to have the illusion that he's not controlled by the criminal globalists.
[01:02:56.948 --> 01:02:58.528]  It's all theater.
[01:02:58.528 --> 01:02:59.949]  It's all staged.
[01:02:59.949 --> 01:03:01.510]  Obama and Bush work together.
[01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:02.710]  They're just mid-level puppets.
[01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:08.517]  Kissinger and Brzezinski and Rockefeller and Senator Jay Rockefeller are many levels above them.
[01:03:09.548 --> 01:03:19.894]  In the pyramid, and that's what we expose in the Obama description and for all the republic, that's why people have to get it and make copies and give it to everyone, because people are now ready to hear the truth.
[01:03:19.894 --> 01:03:22.195]  We as hardcore patriots know the truth.
[01:03:22.195 --> 01:03:27.418]  It's old to us, it's new to everybody else, and people aren't listening.
[01:03:27.418 --> 01:03:33.782]  Like a man who is thirsting to death, dying of thirst in the desert, and we're sitting here on a
[01:03:34.202 --> 01:03:38.265]  You know, a million gallons of ice water, thinking that he doesn't want it.
[01:03:38.265 --> 01:03:39.366]  They want it.
[01:03:39.366 --> 01:03:40.467]  They're ready.
[01:03:40.467 --> 01:03:43.610]  Teach people the basics, and I just keep plugging my films.
[01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:50.095]  Endgame, Terrorist Storm, Obama Deception, Ball of the Republic, your film, Fabled Enemy, your film coming up, and it's so incredible.
[01:03:50.095 --> 01:03:55.439]  I mean, the level that we're taking everything to with Invisible Empire coming out in February.
[01:03:55.439 --> 01:03:59.562]  Folks, we're on the march, and you are carrying the ball with the listeners and the activists.
[01:03:59.562 --> 01:04:00.523]  I salute you.
[01:04:00.523 --> 01:04:01.504]  And the guy coming up next,
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.261]  Great idea.
[01:04:03.261 --> 01:04:10.228]  Not just criminal charges which are forthcoming and people getting kicked out of the universities, losing their tenure.
[01:04:10.228 --> 01:04:15.414]  We need everybody who's been preyed on by these criminals and all these professors they got fired.
[01:04:16.115 --> 01:04:25.826]  We need all of them to sue these bastards, because at Discovery, everything will come out, ladies and gentlemen, and everything is coming out.
[01:04:25.826 --> 01:04:26.687]  So, Jason, keep it up.
[01:04:26.687 --> 01:04:31.993]  I know you've got a bunch of other big guests, including Katherine Austen-Fitz, get her take on climate change and global government.
[01:04:32.413 --> 01:04:33.933]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:33.933 --> 01:04:36.114]  We'll be back after this with ex-Navy SEAL Jim O'Neill.
[01:05:01.305 --> 01:05:06.887]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.
[01:05:06.887 --> 01:05:21.353]  If you suffer from chronic or recurring pain, or if you take prescription drugs for pain, then you owe it to yourself to visit TPR20info.com and get TPR20, the effective pain relief cream, without the harmful side effects of prescription drugs.
[01:05:21.753 --> 01:05:25.837]  I use TPR-20 for arthritis in my hand and it works great.
[01:05:25.837 --> 01:05:30.341]  It relieves the pain fast and fights the inflammation to keep the pain away longer.
[01:05:30.341 --> 01:05:39.510]  On TPR20info.com, you can read about the many uses of TPR-20, like arthritis, fibromyalgia, sports injuries, back pain, sore muscles, and much, much more.
[01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:45.237]  Visit tpr20info.com and give yourself and those you love the gift of pain relief.

[01:05:55.311 --> 01:05:56.052]  That's tpr20info.com.
[01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:05.396]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:06:05.396 --> 01:06:09.922]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:06:09.922 --> 01:06:12.205]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:06:12.205 --> 01:06:13.827]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:06:13.827 --> 01:06:14.849]  There is a solution.
[01:06:15.089 --> 01:06:23.511]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:06:23.511 --> 01:06:30.972]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:42.575]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:06:43.015 --> 01:06:47.159]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[01:07:00.066 --> 01:07:09.191]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:12.572]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:07:12.572 --> 01:07:18.435]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:07:18.435 --> 01:07:23.218]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:07:23.218 --> 01:07:25.559]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:07:25.759 --> 01:07:26.039]  Thank you.
[01:07:44.676 --> 01:07:48.377]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[01:07:48.377 --> 01:07:50.578]  That's O-X-Y-Silver.net.
[01:07:50.578 --> 01:07:57.101]  Or call about OxySilver, Zeolife, and GI Flora Pro toll-free at 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:07:57.101 --> 01:07:59.281]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:07:59.281 --> 01:08:00.962]  Do it now.
[01:08:00.962 --> 01:08:06.364]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.364 --> 01:08:08.625]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:12.017 --> 01:08:12.918]  We are back!
[01:08:12.918 --> 01:08:13.878]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:13.878 --> 01:08:23.604]  I'm Jason Burmas sitting and we have former Navy SEAL Jim O'Neill coming up to discuss his latest article up at InfoWars.com on the climate gate situation.
[01:08:23.604 --> 01:08:29.367]  We're going to be covering that full spectrum in just a moment, but I want to thank some of our great sponsors that make this show possible.
[01:08:30.047 --> 01:08:32.408]  www.EcolaBlue.com.
[01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:34.690]  That's EcolaBlue.com.
[01:08:34.690 --> 01:08:35.650]  Folks, what can I say?
[01:08:35.650 --> 01:08:37.871]  It pulls water out of the air.
[01:08:37.871 --> 01:08:39.452]  Reverse osmosis.
[01:08:39.452 --> 01:08:40.353]  None of the toxins.
[01:08:40.353 --> 01:08:41.433]  None of the fluoride.
[01:08:41.433 --> 01:08:42.394]  All of the good times.
[01:08:42.394 --> 01:08:42.834]  1-800-691-6043.
[01:08:42.834 --> 01:08:42.874]  1-800-691.
[01:08:49.075 --> 01:08:53.517]  6-0-4-3 or go to acolablue.com.
[01:08:53.517 --> 01:08:55.258]  Let me tell you, the water is delicious.
[01:08:55.258 --> 01:08:58.819]  And again, you don't need to hook this up to a sink or any kind of filtration system.
[01:08:58.819 --> 01:09:01.840]  It pulls it from the air, acolablue.com.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.121]  And I'd also like to thank Ecuador Central.
[01:09:04.121 --> 01:09:08.443]  Ecuadorcentral.com believes we all have a duty to protect our families and our wealth.
[01:09:08.843 --> 01:09:18.207]  If you are considering a new life somewhere else, want a second home outside of the U.S., or if you want to invest in a growing economy, Ecuador Central can help you.
[01:09:18.207 --> 01:09:21.789]  Go check them out at EcuadorCentral.com.
[01:09:21.789 --> 01:09:25.671]  E-C-U-A-D-O-R Central dot com.
[01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:29.232]  All right, I am pleased to have our next guest on.
[01:09:29.232 --> 01:09:44.516]  He's a former military man and he is standing up to the climate change debacle, the lie that's out there, the modus operandi for these people to get world government and a carbon tax for every global citizen, as they call them.
[01:09:44.516 --> 01:09:45.737]  How you doing today, Jim?
[01:09:45.737 --> 01:09:47.877]  I'm doing great, Jason.
[01:09:47.877 --> 01:09:55.860]  So why don't you, just for the listeners, go over an overview of your past military experience and why you've taken an interest in the climate gate situation.
[01:09:56.701 --> 01:09:57.582]  Sure.
[01:09:57.582 --> 01:10:06.268]  Just briefly, I was in the Underwater Demolition Team 21 and SEAL Team 2 back in the early 70s.
[01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:22.541]  And the reason why I'm trying to be on top of this whole ClimateGate thing is once I heard about these files being leaked or hacked from East Anglia, I knew this was it.
[01:10:22.541 --> 01:10:24.783]  This was the Achilles heel.
[01:10:24.783 --> 01:10:26.504]  And as Alex said,
[01:10:27.239 --> 01:10:39.691]  Just redouble and redouble and redouble efforts to bring this out, keep it out, put it on the front burner, and keep it on the front burner.
[01:10:39.691 --> 01:10:40.872]  This is it, man.
[01:10:40.872 --> 01:10:43.375]  We gotta go after this and pound at it.
[01:10:44.378 --> 01:10:54.986]  Absolutely, and with these world leaders just to continue with their operation, to not say, oh my god, this has been exposed as a fraud, we shouldn't go to this Copenhagen Treaty.
[01:10:54.986 --> 01:11:04.853]  I mean, I've got headlines out of Reuters right now that the carbon market out of the European Union, yet another step towards global governance, is up 2% today.
[01:11:05.754 --> 01:11:13.741]  How is that possible now that we have exposed that man-made climate change, as they call it, is nothing but a fraud?
[01:11:13.741 --> 01:11:22.167]  Let's go over some of the highlights of your article, Attention Lawyers Make Millions Off of Climategate Crooks.
[01:11:22.167 --> 01:11:23.669]  Let's talk about this.
[01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:27.272]  What do you think are some of the hot points of this?
[01:11:27.272 --> 01:11:32.856]  Well, I love the idea of going after them in a legal way.
[01:11:35.034 --> 01:11:43.339]  Yeah, there's no tort reform in the health care bill because there's so many lawyers on the left.
[01:11:43.339 --> 01:11:45.780]  And we need to switch that around.
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:50.884]  There are a number, a great number, of patriotic, conservative lawyers.
[01:11:50.884 --> 01:11:59.629]  And if they start suing the various agencies and individuals involved in Climategate, I think
[01:12:00.595 --> 01:12:03.796]  Well, number one, that'll keep it on the front burner.
[01:12:03.796 --> 01:12:06.717]  And number two, they're going to make a lot of money.
[01:12:06.717 --> 01:12:12.299]  And number three, it'll bring it out to the public's awareness.
[01:12:12.299 --> 01:12:13.040]  Absolutely.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.121]  And this isn't really a new idea.
[01:12:15.121 --> 01:12:26.805]  The co-founder of the Weather Channel, John Coleman, I believe it was last summer, actually said, you know, we should go after Al Gore and his minions and supporters and sue them for fraud.
[01:12:27.165 --> 01:12:29.346]  This was before these emails came out.
[01:12:47.031 --> 01:12:47.411]  Absolutely.
[01:12:47.411 --> 01:12:52.834]  The media has painted themselves into a corner and they can't get out of it without getting egg all over their face.
[01:12:52.834 --> 01:12:54.895]  It's unbelievable what a big cover-up is going on.
[01:13:14.796 --> 01:13:17.540]  It's the biggest news story in world history.
[01:13:25.592 --> 01:13:35.518]  Getting up on television when he's asked about climate change, he says, well that doesn't really matter because most people still believe in man-made climate change and it doesn't matter.
[01:13:35.518 --> 01:13:38.520]  Barack Obama is still going to go to this Copenhagen treaty.
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:44.564]  Let's hope that he doesn't sign some kind of a treaty or a referendum or they put out a communique in which he pledges
[01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:45.725]  We're good to go!
[01:14:04.605 --> 01:14:05.445]  Did you hear that, folks?
[01:14:05.445 --> 01:14:07.286]  Only around two dozen.
[01:14:07.286 --> 01:14:14.991]  These people, or as Lord Monckton calls them, idiots, crooks and criminals, should be tried in an international court for crimes against humanity.
[01:14:14.991 --> 01:14:15.751]  Agreed.
[01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:19.813]  These people are already responsible for the deaths of millions of people worldwide.
[01:14:19.813 --> 01:14:22.134]  Let's stop right there and discuss that.
[01:14:22.134 --> 01:14:28.398]  Because as they subsidize things like corn for ethanol, they are taking away food from third world nations.
[01:14:28.398 --> 01:14:30.299]  And people are literally starving to death, yes?
[01:14:31.119 --> 01:14:32.339]  Absolutely.
[01:14:32.339 --> 01:14:39.241]  The far left has historically been very enamored of population control.
[01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:44.642]  And some people will say that's why they banned DDT.
[01:14:44.642 --> 01:14:52.304]  But regardless, they want to cut down on the world's population.
[01:14:52.304 --> 01:14:57.605]  And they've discussed various ways of doing this, and no doubt starvation is one of them.
[01:14:58.251 --> 01:15:04.221]  And it's one of the reasons, the other being that they want to wipe out the middle class.
[01:15:04.221 --> 01:15:12.133]  Population control is one of the reasons why they're cutting back on America's food production.
[01:15:13.388 --> 01:15:20.612]  Absolutely, and let's not forget, people like Kissinger and institutes like the United Nations have talked about using food as a weapon.
[01:15:20.612 --> 01:15:23.333]  That's right, food as a weapon.
[01:15:23.333 --> 01:15:25.174]  Let's read some more of this article.
[01:15:25.174 --> 01:15:41.063]  Their insistent, loud, hysteric calls for CO2 reduction, or else, have resulted in the implementation of laws that have built taxpayers, corporations, and entire countries out of billions of dollars, and not to mention, really put another arm in their command and control
[01:15:41.883 --> 01:15:44.004]  Cashless Society Control Grid.
[01:15:44.004 --> 01:15:45.284]  You look at the Netherlands.
[01:15:45.284 --> 01:15:58.848]  They have passed laws now that by 2011 each car will be taxed by the mile and they'll do this by installing a GPS device in each vehicle and taxing you by the kilometer.
[01:15:58.848 --> 01:16:00.589]  By the kilometer!
[01:16:01.269 --> 01:16:02.870]  Think about how crazy that is.
[01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:10.653]  They're using carbon as an excuse not only to tax you, but track, trace, and database you daily as you're in your vehicle.
[01:16:10.653 --> 01:16:12.273]  This is wild stuff, Jim.
[01:16:12.273 --> 01:16:15.455]  Did you ever think that this would be being implemented globally?
[01:16:15.455 --> 01:16:23.938]  I mean, when you see it coming to the United States, and you are a veteran, you have served for this country, doesn't it just turn your stomach?
[01:16:23.938 --> 01:16:26.919]  Oh, it's unbelievable to me.
[01:16:26.919 --> 01:16:28.680]  But at the same time, you gotta believe it.
[01:16:29.641 --> 01:16:31.823]  It's happening.
[01:16:31.823 --> 01:16:37.328]  But fortunately, many, many people are waking up to what's going on.
[01:16:37.328 --> 01:16:42.713]  And I think that this, I know that this climate gate is going to wake a lot of people.
[01:16:42.713 --> 01:16:44.294]  There's going to be a huge upheaval.
[01:16:45.643 --> 01:16:46.724]  Well, I certainly hope so.
[01:16:46.724 --> 01:17:00.162]  I hope that the listeners out there are just seeing this as a beginning when Penn State says it will investigate Climategate, when Inhofe is asking Barbara Boxer to start a congressional investigation into the possible.
[01:17:00.162 --> 01:17:00.523]  And it's not
[01:17:00.863 --> 01:17:03.685]  Yep, and the mass media is like, what problem?
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:32.440]  We don't see it.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:53.819]  Well, when you see the leftists out there, the globalist leftists such as George Moonbaat, and I keep bringing him up because he is an unapologetic globalist who has called for global governance, who has written a book called The New World Order, who now has pieces out there saying, look, we can't ignore Climategate and we can't act like these emails exist, but we have to point out that most people are misinterpreting
[01:17:54.259 --> 01:17:55.219]  It's the whole term, climate change.
[01:18:22.997 --> 01:18:24.898]  Yeah, it's so generic.
[01:18:24.898 --> 01:18:25.979]  What does it mean?
[01:18:25.979 --> 01:18:29.142]  Well, it can mean anything they want it to mean.
[01:18:29.142 --> 01:18:36.609]  As you have pointed out, they started with global cooling, then they went to global warming, now it's climate change.
[01:18:36.609 --> 01:18:38.850]  Yeah, of course it's climate change.
[01:18:38.850 --> 01:18:41.593]  It can cover anything they want it to cover.
[01:18:41.593 --> 01:18:49.900]  This whole climate gate thing should awaken people to the fact that they've been scammed.
[01:18:50.405 --> 01:18:52.365]  And it's fraud.
[01:18:52.365 --> 01:18:58.247]  It's racketeering on an international level.
[01:18:58.247 --> 01:19:10.790]  How much money are you going to be willing to put out, paying in taxes individually, in state taxes, national taxes, for something that doesn't exist?
[01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:11.510]  It's incredible.
[01:19:12.699 --> 01:19:23.207]  It is incredible to me that the general populace out there, the people who are, you know, know-nothing do-gooders, you know, people who are being used by the system, they think they're helping the system.
[01:19:23.207 --> 01:19:27.511]  They're like, well, we gotta save the world and, you know, climate change is gonna kill us all.
[01:19:27.511 --> 01:19:36.317]  They've tricked them into thinking CO2, something that is invisible to them, virtually invisible to them, is a taxable substance.
[01:19:36.317 --> 01:19:37.819]  Something that can't really be measured.
[01:19:38.519 --> 01:19:41.882]  But they can guilt you into saying, oh, you have a large home.
[01:19:41.882 --> 01:19:43.203]  You have a nice car.
[01:19:43.203 --> 01:19:44.464]  You put out too much garbage.
[01:19:44.464 --> 01:19:46.265]  We need the climate cops.
[01:19:46.265 --> 01:19:47.005]  The climate police.
[01:19:47.005 --> 01:19:47.886]  We'll be back after this.
[01:19:47.886 --> 01:19:48.827]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:48.827 --> 01:19:50.148]  I'm Jason Burmas setting in.
[01:19:50.148 --> 01:20:02.177]  More with Jim O'Neill.
[01:20:02.177 --> 01:20:05.119]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:20:07.039 --> 01:20:07.319]  I think so.
[01:20:22.159 --> 01:20:28.320]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:33.161]  From the smallest to the largest systems, BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com has what you need.

[01:22:02.068 --> 01:22:02.849]  Gold.
[01:22:02.849 --> 01:22:04.411]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:22:04.411 --> 01:22:10.677]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:22:10.677 --> 01:22:14.861]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:22:14.861 --> 01:22:16.803]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:22:16.803 --> 01:22:19.046]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:22:19.326 --> 01:22:19.786]  We're good.
[01:22:40.762 --> 01:22:41.743]  We're good to go.
[01:23:01.624 --> 01:23:04.786]  Do you want to get away from additives and preservatives in your food?
[01:23:04.786 --> 01:23:07.427]  Need alternatives to conventional food preparation?
[01:23:07.427 --> 01:23:10.028]  Do you want to save the fruits of your gardening labor?
[01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:12.369]  And are you looking for an excellent gift idea?
[01:23:12.369 --> 01:23:14.570]  Then check out the Excalibur Dehydrator.
[01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:19.273]  Dehydration is one of the healthiest, most cost-effective, and fun ways to feed yourself and your family.
[01:23:19.273 --> 01:23:21.734]  Make healthy snacks like fruit roll-ups and beef jerky.
[01:23:22.034 --> 01:23:22.314]  I think so.
[01:23:37.765 --> 01:23:38.145]  I think so.
[01:24:11.864 --> 01:24:13.625]  We are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:13.625 --> 01:24:14.726]  I'm Jason Burmas sitting in.
[01:24:14.726 --> 01:24:20.271]  We're discussing ClimateGate with former Navy SEAL Jim O'Neill.
[01:24:20.271 --> 01:24:21.592]  Let me read some of this article for you.
[01:24:21.592 --> 01:24:24.995]  CO2 is not a danger and it never has been.
[01:24:24.995 --> 01:24:28.819]  All of this toxic greenhouse gas nonsense is a load of rubbish.
[01:24:29.199 --> 01:24:40.168]  Scientists are familiar with the Cambrian Explosion, a period in the Earth's distant past when, in a relatively brief period of time, new forms of life burst into being around the globe.
[01:24:40.168 --> 01:24:46.853]  During the Cambrian Explosion, CO2 levels were approximately 20 times higher than they are today.
[01:24:46.853 --> 01:24:53.459]  That hardly qualifies CO2 as some sort of life-threatening toxin or a man-made toxic gas, for that matter.
[01:24:53.459 --> 01:24:58.563]  At periods in the Earth's past, CO2 levels have been up to 10,000 times higher than they are today.
[01:24:58.883 --> 01:25:01.444]  I'm not saying that such extreme levels are healthy.
[01:25:01.444 --> 01:25:09.426]  I'm just pointing out to the auto industry, for example, most assuredly had nothing to do with the extreme levels of CO2 millions of years ago.
[01:25:09.426 --> 01:25:14.948]  When Mother Nature feels like it, she can leave one huge carbon footprint.
[01:25:14.948 --> 01:25:18.449]  So why do you think the public has been so duped, Jim?
[01:25:18.449 --> 01:25:23.611]  Why can't people look at this, understand that CO2 has been at levels of
[01:25:23.851 --> 01:25:28.533]  Well, excuse me, I would say that the lamestream media is a large part of it, and Hollywood, of course, and academia.
[01:25:44.958 --> 01:25:53.441]  And they're all in cahoots to push this agenda, some for greed, but mostly, I think, for political reasons.
[01:25:53.441 --> 01:26:10.287]  They have a political agenda, and this is a way to topple the industrialized nations by making it so expensive to build plants, manufacturing plants, and power plants, and for food production.
[01:26:12.037 --> 01:26:14.339]  On several different levels.
[01:26:14.339 --> 01:26:17.121]  This is Agenda 21.
[01:26:17.121 --> 01:26:20.163]  This is the population control.
[01:26:20.163 --> 01:26:23.445]  This is the spreading the wealth.
[01:26:23.445 --> 01:26:25.307]  Sustainable development.
[01:26:25.307 --> 01:26:28.169]  Which is another word for that, really.
[01:26:28.169 --> 01:26:31.071]  It's communism or Marxism, if you will.
[01:26:31.071 --> 01:26:33.452]  It's just wearing new clothes.
[01:26:33.452 --> 01:26:37.175]  And they've been at this game for quite a while now.
[01:26:37.175 --> 01:26:39.977]  And it's at the point now where they believe
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:42.921]  They can take off the mask.
[01:26:42.921 --> 01:26:46.381]  And, you know, but people are waking up now.
[01:26:46.381 --> 01:26:52.243]  And hopefully, Obama jumped the gun a bit.
[01:26:52.243 --> 01:27:00.545]  And there's still enough time where we can stop this and then go on a different path.
[01:27:00.545 --> 01:27:01.825]  I wouldn't say reverse it.
[01:27:01.825 --> 01:27:03.626]  I don't want to go back.
[01:27:03.626 --> 01:27:07.246]  The status quo is no longer acceptable.
[01:27:07.246 --> 01:27:08.467]  And we need to go.
[01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:17.807]  We need to think outside the box, and go in a conservative direction, but in a new direction.
[01:27:17.807 --> 01:27:24.833]  Why don't, for the listeners, you give just a quick overview of how we should pursue these lawsuits against the criminals?
[01:27:24.833 --> 01:27:26.294]  Sure.
[01:27:26.294 --> 01:27:33.621]  I would say, on an individual basis, you could sue people like Michael Mann at Penn State.
[01:27:33.621 --> 01:27:36.223]  You can sue the state.
[01:27:37.243 --> 01:27:45.827]  The different EPA, Sustainable Development Agencies, every county in the country has one now.
[01:27:45.827 --> 01:27:47.908]  All the departments in the U.S.
[01:27:47.908 --> 01:27:55.091]  government have their Agenda 21 protocols in place.
[01:27:55.091 --> 01:28:02.015]  It's almost an infinite list of places you could go to sue for being defrauded of your money.
[01:28:02.015 --> 01:28:02.755]  I mean, it's stealing.
[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:12.087]  If they're using these facts and figures which are not based on reality to steal money from you, that's fraud.
[01:28:12.087 --> 01:28:16.450]  And it's international fraud and it's local fraud.
[01:28:16.450 --> 01:28:22.455]  And also, not to mention, there's also emotional distress caused by all of this.
[01:28:22.455 --> 01:28:29.701]  And I see a number of reasons to sue and an almost infinite number of places to sue.
[01:28:30.967 --> 01:28:36.112]  Do you have an email or a website we could give out where people could contact you and discuss this further?
[01:28:36.112 --> 01:28:45.301]  Well, at this point, really, go to Canada Free Press and comment on my article section.
[01:28:46.303 --> 01:28:46.764]  Absolutely.
[01:28:46.764 --> 01:28:50.628]  We have that same article over at Infowars.com right now.
[01:28:50.628 --> 01:29:00.700]  If we don't step up, if we don't take action, if we don't go after them where it hurts, and that's their pocketbooks, how else are we supposed to expose this fraud?
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:05.165]  After all, the mainstream media again wants to spin Climacate.
[01:29:05.165 --> 01:29:05.986]  They want to make it about
[01:29:06.386 --> 01:29:06.947]  Well, I hope not.
[01:29:06.947 --> 01:29:07.927]  But knowing Obama, he'll sign it.
[01:29:07.927 --> 01:29:10.089]  I mean, the man seems just not to care about what the people want.
[01:29:36.372 --> 01:29:38.975]  He just cares about his far left agenda.
[01:29:38.975 --> 01:29:42.118]  So I fully expect him to sign.
[01:29:42.118 --> 01:29:44.180]  He truly serves his globalist masters.
[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:45.161]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:45.161 --> 01:29:46.162]  We'll be back after this.
[01:29:46.162 --> 01:29:47.343]  I'm Jason Burma setting in.
[01:29:47.343 --> 01:29:51.467]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:29:51.467 --> 01:29:52.848]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.848 --> 01:29:55.390]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:58.073]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:03.857]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:30:03.857 --> 01:30:07.479]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:30:07.479 --> 01:30:12.061]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:30:12.061 --> 01:30:17.664]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:30:17.944 --> 01:30:22.729]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:30:22.729 --> 01:30:26.332]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:30:26.332 --> 01:30:31.157]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:30:31.157 --> 01:30:37.724]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:30:37.724 --> 01:30:39.686]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:30:40.146 --> 01:30:43.348]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:30:43.348 --> 01:30:47.852]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[01:30:47.852 --> 01:30:50.093]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:30:50.093 --> 01:30:50.394]  877-327-0365.
[01:30:50.394 --> 01:30:51.114]  Don't wait, call today!
[01:31:01.138 --> 01:31:04.140]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:09.484]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.484 --> 01:31:11.526]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.526 --> 01:31:16.529]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.529 --> 01:31:17.710]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.710 --> 01:31:18.831]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.831 --> 01:31:20.712]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.712 --> 01:31:21.793]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.793 --> 01:31:23.995]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.995 --> 01:31:25.336]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.336 --> 01:31:26.637]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.857 --> 01:31:32.121]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:32.121 --> 01:31:35.703]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.703 --> 01:31:39.526]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.526 --> 01:31:40.747]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.747 --> 01:31:41.648]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.648 --> 01:31:42.749]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.749 --> 01:31:43.509]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.509 --> 01:31:44.490]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.770 --> 01:31:47.832]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.832 --> 01:31:49.594]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.594 --> 01:31:50.514]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:00.154 --> 01:32:05.461]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:32:05.461 --> 01:32:09.987]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:32:09.987 --> 01:32:12.270]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:32:12.270 --> 01:32:13.892]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:32:13.892 --> 01:32:14.934]  There is a solution.
[01:32:15.154 --> 01:32:23.579]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:32:37.066 --> 01:32:43.093]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[01:33:01.426 --> 01:33:17.240]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.000]  We are back!
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.342]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.342 --> 01:33:21.463]  Alex is out on assignment in Dallas.
[01:33:21.463 --> 01:33:22.845]  He may call in yet again.
[01:33:22.845 --> 01:33:25.927]  We've got a couple more guests coming up for you.
[01:33:25.927 --> 01:33:28.329]  At the top of the next hour, Gary Lachman.
[01:33:29.383 --> 01:33:30.023]  Pretty good.
[01:33:30.023 --> 01:33:30.763]  Nice to be back again.
[01:33:57.965 --> 01:33:59.085]  We got gold at $1213.
[01:33:59.085 --> 01:34:05.707]  That's $1,213 is where it's trading right now in the February market.
[01:34:05.707 --> 01:34:13.850]  And all the shares are up, all the coins are up, exactly as Ted Anderson and myself and Alex said they would be.
[01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:16.990]  And we got a long, long way to go yet.
[01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:22.292]  And I think, in fact, Dubai is probably in some ways affecting this, expediting it.
[01:34:23.961 --> 01:34:36.974]  I have an interim number here of $1,325, a pullback of $50 to $100, and then another rally up to $1,680 by the beginning of April.
[01:34:36.974 --> 01:34:39.676]  And then by the end of the year, $2,500 to $3,000.
[01:34:39.676 --> 01:34:45.743]  And the following year, if things work out the way I think they will, it'll go much higher.
[01:34:46.471 --> 01:35:00.298]  So you're telling me within a year's time, you expect gold to hit $2,500 to $3,000 an ounce, when only a year ago, around a year ago, it was trading around $800, and back in 2003, it was below $300.
[01:35:00.298 --> 01:35:14.945]  That's right, and they listened to this program, and Alex, and Ted, and everybody has been buying, and they're all making money, or at least they're offsetting the losses that the dollar's taking, because it's under pressure all the time.
[01:35:15.914 --> 01:35:21.119]  And we're going to come out solvent in the end, and we're going to be able to do a lot of good things.
[01:35:21.119 --> 01:35:30.308]  What Alex and I have been talking about on the air is what now major programs are talking about.
[01:35:30.308 --> 01:35:36.574]  In fact, yesterday, if you can believe this, Rush Limbaugh was talking about the Fed and
[01:35:37.532 --> 01:35:43.837]  And the 1207, and he put a little tape on on Ron Paul, and then he put one of mine on from some show.
[01:35:43.837 --> 01:35:50.883]  I don't know, but it shows you that they're being drawn into this, whether they like it or not.
[01:35:50.883 --> 01:35:57.108]  And so I imagine Alex's ratings probably going through the roof as well.
[01:35:57.108 --> 01:36:04.134]  But anyway, getting on to Dubai, we only got 10 minutes here, and it was not a coincidence
[01:36:05.188 --> 01:36:08.671]  That the bad information was released on Thanksgiving.
[01:36:08.671 --> 01:36:16.218]  It was done deliberately to take gold and silver and commodities down and keep the market from going down 500 points.
[01:36:16.218 --> 01:36:23.244]  And what happened was the market didn't go down 500, it went down 150 and a little bit more the following day.
[01:36:23.244 --> 01:36:27.807]  The gold went down 50 and came back to a minus 12 and went up the next few days.
[01:36:27.807 --> 01:36:29.269]  And the same with silver.
[01:36:29.269 --> 01:36:31.711]  So, they really didn't accomplish very much.
[01:36:32.401 --> 01:36:48.688]  But as far as what this is going to mean in the future is, if you take all of their off-balance sheet items there in Dubai, you're going to find that the debt is probably somewhere between $60 and $120 billion.
[01:36:48.688 --> 01:36:55.971]  And part of it will be picked up by Abu Dhabi, and part of it will be picked up by European and U.S.
[01:36:55.971 --> 01:36:57.691]  banks, and they'll paper it over.
[01:36:57.691 --> 01:37:00.072]  It'll take two or three years to do it.
[01:37:00.072 --> 01:37:01.973]  Probably one to two is more likely.
[01:37:03.094 --> 01:37:07.437]  It's not a good event, and it's part of what is causing gold to go up.
[01:37:07.437 --> 01:37:10.339]  Gold is not going up because of inflation.
[01:37:10.339 --> 01:37:27.971]  Gold is going up because sophisticated investors, professionals, people with money, they are saying to themselves, we don't believe what the central banks in the top eight and ten nations of the world are saying.
[01:37:28.752 --> 01:37:35.237]  We've lost confidence and trust in them, and we want gold because we know they're not telling us the truth.
[01:37:35.237 --> 01:37:36.498]  And that's where this is all going.
[01:37:38.117 --> 01:37:40.338]  Well, I'm looking at the mainstream networks now.
[01:37:40.338 --> 01:37:51.541]  When I'm on MSNBC, when I'm on Fox News, when I'm on CNBC, all's I'm seeing now are advertisements either cash for gold or how you need to invest in gold.
[01:37:51.541 --> 01:37:54.122]  Gold is the new big investment.
[01:37:54.122 --> 01:38:05.246]  I mean, when the commercials are admitting that in under 10 years' time, gold has more than tripled in its value, there are literally no other investments that I can think of, at least honest ones, that have done that.
[01:38:06.272 --> 01:38:15.234]  You're absolutely right, and we've been in the forefront for the last 10 years, and everybody who's been a subscriber has made money.
[01:38:15.234 --> 01:38:17.334]  Some of them made goo gobs of money.
[01:38:17.334 --> 01:38:27.756]  And if you look at the ratings, I'm sure you're familiar with the ratings on the talk shows, which is TalkStream Live.
[01:38:27.756 --> 01:38:30.056]  Have you ever seen that?
[01:38:30.056 --> 01:38:32.677]  Yeah, and ShowCast.
[01:38:32.677 --> 01:38:34.737]  Yeah, they had me first.
[01:38:35.464 --> 01:38:36.065]  Oh wow.
[01:38:36.065 --> 01:38:39.930]  This week above Hannity, Beck, Donahue, Laura.
[01:38:39.930 --> 01:38:42.113]  I get the charts right in front of me here.
[01:38:42.113 --> 01:38:43.695]  And so why am I telling you that?
[01:38:43.695 --> 01:38:51.705]  I'm telling you that because like Alex and I have talked about so many times on the program and that is we got them on the run and I love it.
[01:38:53.999 --> 01:38:57.602]  Well, it all depends on whether they have another stimulus, and it all depends on whether
[01:39:17.276 --> 01:39:21.437]  The Federal Reserve removes $1.5 trillion from the economy.
[01:39:21.437 --> 01:39:23.998]  They want to, because they don't want hyperinflation.
[01:39:23.998 --> 01:39:43.924]  But if they pull the $1.5 trillion out, part of which would come from TARP money coming back in again, which banks are using to gamble in the stock market with, if they don't take the money out and there's another stimulus program, then we'll go sideways in the economy, but that won't affect gold at all.
[01:39:44.973 --> 01:39:55.682]  And if they do pull the money out, $1.5 trillion, we're going to head downward, even if there was a stimulus package of, say, $400 billion.
[01:39:55.682 --> 01:39:59.606]  I mean, the damn that they do and damn that they don't, there's no way out for these people.
[01:39:59.606 --> 01:40:01.247]  They're in a cage and they can't get out.
[01:40:01.247 --> 01:40:03.269]  They're like wild animals.
[01:40:03.269 --> 01:40:05.831]  They're believing in their minds, that's where they're going.
[01:40:05.831 --> 01:40:11.296]  I mean, when you have a blank fine, as the head of Goldman Sachs said,
[01:40:13.376 --> 01:40:14.777]  We're doing God's work.
[01:40:14.777 --> 01:40:17.019]  I mean, you've got to be kidding.
[01:40:17.019 --> 01:40:19.500]  Their God is not the same as mine.
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.622]  Their God is Lucifer.
[01:40:21.622 --> 01:40:25.004]  And they are not doing the work of the American people or anybody else.
[01:40:25.004 --> 01:40:30.528]  They're enriching themselves, and they're trying to ensconce more power into their hands.
[01:40:30.528 --> 01:40:34.251]  The InternationalForecaster.com is the website.
[01:40:34.251 --> 01:40:42.997]  Briefly before you go, Bob, where are we in terms of unemployment, and where do you see us in terms of unemployment in six months to a year?
[01:40:45.327 --> 01:40:46.648]  It depends upon the package.
[01:40:46.648 --> 01:40:55.491]  If there's no package, the figures that have been declining from the bad levels they were at will start going back up again.
[01:40:55.491 --> 01:41:01.854]  So we'll go from 22.2% during next year to 25%, maybe 30%.
[01:41:01.854 --> 01:41:12.058]  If they have a stimulus package and they increase lending to the business and public, it'll stay relatively in the same area.
[01:41:12.058 --> 01:41:13.159]  It all depends on what they do.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:16.300]  Alright, Bob, thank you so much.
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:19.141]  Tell people where they can get the newsletter.
[01:41:19.141 --> 01:41:22.462]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:41:22.462 --> 01:41:25.182]  And... Where is that number?
[01:41:25.182 --> 01:41:28.623]  I can't find it right now.
[01:41:28.623 --> 01:41:29.123]  Where is it?
[01:41:29.123 --> 01:41:30.583]  Where is it?
[01:41:30.583 --> 01:41:32.204]  Well, we've got Ted Anderson coming up.
[01:41:32.204 --> 01:41:32.804]  What, you got the number?
[01:41:32.804 --> 01:41:33.064]  Go ahead.
[01:41:33.064 --> 01:41:33.704]  877-479-8178.
[01:41:33.704 --> 01:41:34.304]  That's toll-free.
[01:41:34.304 --> 01:41:34.344]  877-479-8178.
[01:41:43.061 --> 01:41:45.641]  And hello, Ted, and I hope you have a wonderful day.
[01:41:45.641 --> 01:41:47.902]  All right, thank you so much for joining us, Bob.
[01:41:47.902 --> 01:41:54.123]  Let's go now to GCN founder Ted Anderson and Midas Resources.
[01:41:54.123 --> 01:41:57.583]  Ted, again, another record-setting day today.
[01:41:57.583 --> 01:42:04.465]  You know, all I can say is get Follow the Republic and watch that thing, and you'll be able to tell why this is happening.
[01:42:04.465 --> 01:42:08.025]  We just, I mean, we're watching the dollar crumble in front of our eyes.
[01:42:08.025 --> 01:42:10.926]  As a matter of fact, it's not happening in front of our eyes because they're closed.
[01:42:10.926 --> 01:42:12.206]  We're sleeping when it's happening.
[01:42:12.813 --> 01:42:15.255]  Foreigners are pushing the market up.
[01:42:15.255 --> 01:42:16.776]  I was watching gold last night.
[01:42:16.776 --> 01:42:24.481]  I was working here till about 930, and I'm every now and then peeking into the Asian market to see what's going on.
[01:42:24.481 --> 01:42:32.827]  And gold had run up from the 1190 level, which it was here in the New York market when it closed, over 1200.
[01:42:32.827 --> 01:42:34.449]  It was trading right around 1210.
[01:42:34.449 --> 01:42:36.790]  And I'm walking around to my brokers.
[01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:38.211]  I said, you watch this.
[01:42:38.211 --> 01:42:39.833]  Gold will be opening up around that 1220 range.
[01:42:42.094 --> 01:42:43.335]  And sure enough, it did.
[01:42:43.335 --> 01:42:45.417]  I mean, today it's hit a high.
[01:42:45.417 --> 01:42:49.740]  Currently, right now, it's the highest, 1,217.
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:52.842]  But that is so close to that 1,220.
[01:42:52.842 --> 01:42:54.003]  That's what's going on.
[01:42:54.003 --> 01:42:56.745]  I mean, the foreigners want to get out of this stuff.
[01:42:56.745 --> 01:42:59.668]  Just like Bob said, they no longer trust the central banks.
[01:42:59.668 --> 01:43:00.969]  And why would you?
[01:43:00.969 --> 01:43:09.615]  Each one of them have a printing press, and every time there's a problem, they just turn it on and start liquefying the value of the currencies that they're representing.
[01:43:09.615 --> 01:43:11.577]  In their case, it's the Federal Reserve System.
[01:43:12.057 --> 01:43:22.486]  You know, we have a runaway spending government that has to depend upon people lending them money in order to operate, and they're not getting it anymore.
[01:43:22.486 --> 01:43:25.108]  They're not getting earned money from foreigners to buy U.S.
[01:43:25.108 --> 01:43:27.670]  government treasuries, which is a loan to the government.
[01:43:28.230 --> 01:43:35.255]  And so they have to turn to the Fed, which turns on the printing press, and whammo, you have rising gold prices and falling dollar.
[01:43:35.255 --> 01:43:37.057]  Surprise, surprise.
[01:43:37.057 --> 01:43:42.501]  Yeah, it's been just a very interesting, very rocky, topsy-turvy market.
[01:43:42.501 --> 01:43:46.484]  It's just, all I can say is that the hand ready is on the wall.
[01:43:47.425 --> 01:43:48.646]  I do believe Bob is right.
[01:43:48.646 --> 01:43:53.611]  I was completely surprised to see gold jump over $1,200 so soon as it did.
[01:43:53.611 --> 01:44:01.780]  I was expecting it to sort of dabble around in that $1,180 range, but it just jumped right over that, which just tells me that $1,300 an ounce is very close as well.
[01:44:04.603 --> 01:44:06.244]  It just, you know, the U.S.
[01:44:06.244 --> 01:44:10.068]  Mint had to stop mining, or stop producing U.S.
[01:44:10.068 --> 01:44:16.935]  Eagles and Silver Eagles because they're running out of planchettes, they've got too many back orders on what they already have, so they put a stop to it.
[01:44:16.935 --> 01:44:23.021]  They're not, they didn't even say when they're going to start producing them again, and the premiums on Silver Eagles and U.S.
[01:44:23.021 --> 01:44:25.924]  Eagles are skyrocketing right now because of it.
[01:44:25.924 --> 01:44:26.605]  You know, this is the
[01:44:27.225 --> 01:44:32.390]  Kind of thing that I had going on just a couple years ago when gold and silver was running up like it was.
[01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:52.027]  And I just need to say, if you're not willing to at least take a look, if you have your money socked away into a bank, or if you're sitting on a 401k plan, or an IRA, or if you have your money in annuities, there's just a whole long line of various different investments that you could be in that right now are
[01:44:52.891 --> 01:45:05.753]  Seriously looking at big trouble with the kind of economy that we have and I darn well seriously think you should take a look at that and maybe move at least 20 to 25 percent of those assets into physical gold.
[01:45:06.556 --> 01:45:12.140]  And I can tell you right now, we have about 5% of the people into gold at this particular point.
[01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:21.866]  And the percentage of money is, they're putting such a small little sliver in, that if we've got to 25% for the whole public, there just wouldn't be enough to go around.
[01:45:21.866 --> 01:45:23.387]  Prices would skyrocket.
[01:45:23.387 --> 01:45:25.369]  And that's when you're talking about the $6,000, $7,000, $8,000 an ounce gold.
[01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:31.292]  Very comfortably, we could see $2,600 gold.
[01:45:31.292 --> 01:45:45.778]  Just because if you adjust for the inflation since 1980, where it hit its market high of $800, $2,600 would be just basically saying that gold is valued the same as it was back in 1980.
[01:45:47.359 --> 01:45:50.702]  Right now it's still at a discount, based upon what the dollar's done.
[01:45:50.702 --> 01:45:52.824]  But the market prices are going up.
[01:45:52.824 --> 01:45:54.946]  I still have a few items left.
[01:45:54.946 --> 01:46:03.314]  For those of you who picked up the Walking Liberty halves like I recommended yesterday at that $8.69 price, well, very much congratulations to you.
[01:46:03.314 --> 01:46:03.874]  They're now at $10.69.
[01:46:03.874 --> 01:46:04.795]  I still have the Lakota.
[01:46:08.078 --> 01:46:11.101]  Coin right now at $24.51.
[01:46:11.101 --> 01:46:13.183]  I have the Montana Silver Round at $22.63.
[01:46:13.183 --> 01:46:17.066]  Those are going to increase, too.
[01:46:17.066 --> 01:46:18.547]  The francs are going to be going up.
[01:46:18.547 --> 01:46:23.852]  They're still at $2.63, which is the same price that I offered them to you just a week ago.
[01:46:23.852 --> 01:46:27.435]  And the British Sovereign at $325, exactly the same price.
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:35.002]  But, you know, I can't hold those prices forever.
[01:46:35.002 --> 01:46:36.043]  Markets are going up.
[01:46:36.043 --> 01:46:38.566]  Gold just jumped over $1,200 an ounce.
[01:46:38.566 --> 01:46:42.770]  My goodness, I was buying this stuff at $1,130, $1,125 thinking, you know, wow, this is like a new high peak.
[01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:44.852]  If I could get gold again at $1,125,
[01:46:49.634 --> 01:46:55.316]  I would think I'd be just getting one of the greatest buys ever, and that was the high price just about a week ago.
[01:46:55.316 --> 01:46:56.516]  So, you know, do the math.
[01:46:56.516 --> 01:47:02.798]  I mean, I know where you're standing on your portfolios at this time, or what you're doing with your investments, but give us a call.
[01:47:02.798 --> 01:47:04.238]  We have a few items around here.
[01:47:04.238 --> 01:47:05.178]  We even have the U.S.
[01:47:05.178 --> 01:47:06.819]  Eagles, which are no longer in production.
[01:47:07.739 --> 01:47:16.044]  Give us a call at 1-800-686-2237 because I don't want people missing out on this market.
[01:47:16.044 --> 01:47:23.869]  I mean, it isn't necessarily for the sake of making tons of money like Bob was talking about, but just for the sake of holding on to what you have.
[01:47:23.869 --> 01:47:27.831]  I mean, what do you think it's going to be worth if you're sitting in paper two years from now?
[01:47:28.612 --> 01:47:37.814]  You know, the United States government is deep in debt, way beyond what it can pay, and it's using a printing press to finance its troubles away.
[01:47:37.814 --> 01:47:39.415]  It's like the Weimar Republic.
[01:47:39.415 --> 01:47:46.617]  We've got problems here, and we should stay away from that particular, you know, we've got to get into gold and silver.
[01:47:46.617 --> 01:47:47.957]  We've got to get into something that's honest.
[01:47:48.678 --> 01:47:49.459]  Absolutely.
[01:47:49.459 --> 01:47:55.745]  You know, hard assets like gold and silver are the ones that are maintaining their value and going up.
[01:47:55.745 --> 01:47:58.988]  Again, this time last year, gold was around $800.
[01:47:58.988 --> 01:48:04.234]  Now it's passing the $1,200 point, and it doesn't seem to have a roof on it.
[01:48:04.234 --> 01:48:08.618]  I wouldn't be surprised if one or two months from now we did see it hit $1,500.
[01:48:08.618 --> 01:48:10.340]  That's not out of the question at this point, Ted.
[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:26.734]  Well, it isn't, and the only way that this is going to be turned around and stopped is if the United States government says, sorry, we're just going to have to default on the debts that we have and we're going to have to come back to our grassroots and get into some constitutional money
[01:48:27.094 --> 01:48:33.858]  Like Ron Paul has been calling for, but that is the exact, you know, what's going on now is the exact opposite of that.
[01:48:33.858 --> 01:48:38.561]  Right now, the government is still talking about stimulating the economy.
[01:48:38.561 --> 01:48:41.162]  Where do you think they're coming up with the money for this?
[01:48:41.162 --> 01:48:49.387]  Where do you think they're going to raise the money for this new government health care system that they're putting together when Medicare is already breaking their back?
[01:48:49.387 --> 01:48:50.568]  They're going to have to turn
[01:48:51.008 --> 01:48:52.729]  We're good to go.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:23.164]  And they don't want that either, so they're choosing to print money to keep the interest rates low, to try to affect the economy, bring down unemployment like Bob was saying, stimulate the economy.
[01:49:23.164 --> 01:49:30.166]  If they put more stimulus money in the economy, it'll solve the unemployment figures temporarily.
[01:49:30.166 --> 01:49:35.887]  But the offset to that is the value of the currency is going to be worth less.
[01:49:35.887 --> 01:49:37.948]  And that's why gold and silver will be worth more.
[01:49:38.678 --> 01:49:39.159]  Absolutely.
[01:49:39.159 --> 01:49:42.983]  MidasResources.com is the website.
[01:49:42.983 --> 01:49:44.145]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:49:44.145 --> 01:49:46.828]  Get into gold and silver while you still can.
[01:49:46.828 --> 01:49:52.334]  I'm not sure there's a lot of people out there that could afford gold at $3,000 an ounce possibly a year from now.
[01:49:52.334 --> 01:49:53.716]  Remember, last year at this time,
[01:49:53.976 --> 01:49:56.457]  At $800, it's already at $1,200.
[01:49:56.457 --> 01:50:10.963]  In 2003, when I started listening to the Alex Jones Show, you can get an ounce of gold for under $300, and I challenge anybody out there to show me an investment that you got into in 2002 or 2003 that has more than tripled in value.
[01:50:10.963 --> 01:50:15.925]  Like I said, I don't believe there's an honest one out there outside of gold.
[01:50:15.925 --> 01:50:18.146]  Well, I mean, that's why people go to gold.
[01:50:18.146 --> 01:50:20.847]  I mean, it takes labor to create an ounce of gold.
[01:50:20.847 --> 01:50:23.088]  People have to actually dig it up out of the ground.
[01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:35.613]  It's a process where they take the ore from the ground, they put it on a leaching pad after they've pulverized the rock, and they sprinkle cyanide over it, and then they get a little bit of gold from that, about three ounces per ton.
[01:50:35.613 --> 01:50:37.574]  You know, it's such a small, minute amount.
[01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:43.933]  Anyways, minus resources 1-800-686-2237 is our number.
[01:50:43.933 --> 01:50:45.393]  We have a lot of great buys now.
[01:50:45.393 --> 01:50:46.814]  The market is moving.
[01:50:46.814 --> 01:50:51.376]  I would get this inventory I have before I have to buy new stuff, because it will be higher.
[01:50:51.376 --> 01:50:52.216]  We'll be back after this.
[01:50:52.216 --> 01:50:53.157]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:53.157 --> 01:50:54.297]  I am Jason Verma sitting in.

[01:51:12.133 --> 01:51:13.256]  The answer is simple.

[01:52:08.075 --> 01:52:13.098]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?

[01:54:40.824 --> 01:54:42.266]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in.

[01:54:47.388 --> 01:54:52.832]  We have Gary Lachman coming up at the top of the hour to discuss his book, Politics and the Occult.
[01:54:52.832 --> 01:54:56.115]  But I want to thank some of our sponsors that make this show possible.
[01:54:56.115 --> 01:54:59.117]  Without them, we wouldn't have an InfoWars.com.
[01:54:59.117 --> 01:55:03.081]  We wouldn't be able to put out 20 or 30 articles a day.
[01:55:03.081 --> 01:55:08.425]  We wouldn't be able to do a four-hour radio show with two hours of video.
[01:55:08.425 --> 01:55:11.468]  But thanks to these sponsors, we are able to bring you all of this
[01:55:12.088 --> 01:55:13.408]  The truth, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:56:01.459 --> 01:56:03.000]  Let's go to Greg in Washington.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.500]  Greg, you're on the line.
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:04.920]  Hey, Jason.
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:06.721]  I always enjoy it when you take over the show.
[01:56:06.721 --> 01:56:08.342]  You hear a nice calm voice.
[01:56:08.342 --> 01:56:08.782]  I like that.
[01:56:10.613 --> 01:56:18.355]  What I would like to address is the two issues that we're really being distracted from and not addressing.
[01:56:18.355 --> 01:56:28.498]  The first one, and it's been on other aspects of the radio network, is the book They Own It All, Including You by Means of Toxic Currency by Ronald McDonald and Robert Rowan.
[01:56:28.498 --> 01:56:30.299]  Are you familiar with that?
[01:56:30.299 --> 01:56:35.740]  Are you there?
[01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:38.301]  We must have dropped him?
[01:56:38.301 --> 01:56:39.101]  No, I have not seen the book.
[01:56:39.665 --> 01:56:44.668]  Okay, what they're pointing out is that we're dealing in the currency of the Federal Reserve note.
[01:56:44.668 --> 01:56:49.151]  And that note itself is a lien against everything that is bought and sold.
[01:56:49.151 --> 01:57:00.198]  And in that case, we're being distracted from what we call dollars, which is in the Constitution, a certain amount of gold and silver minted by the government, or at least weighed and measured by the government.
[01:57:00.198 --> 01:57:02.179]  And we're dealing in paper.
[01:57:02.179 --> 01:57:06.502]  The second issue is based on a book of, or just covered in a book of U.S.
[01:57:07.452 --> 01:57:07.692]  Okay.
[01:57:28.996 --> 01:57:31.378]  And become under Admiralty and Maritime Law.
[01:57:31.378 --> 01:57:33.159]  All right, let me stop you right there, Greg.
[01:57:33.159 --> 01:57:38.643]  You know, we have covered common law before on this program, on my program.
[01:57:38.643 --> 01:57:49.811]  I encourage people to go check out America Freedom to Fascism, which really breaks down what the Federal Reserve System is, how it's a private organization, also breaks down the illegality of the income tax.
[01:57:49.811 --> 01:57:51.852]  But we have to pick and choose our battles.
[01:57:51.852 --> 01:57:54.855]  I've seen people out there try to, you know, go by
[01:57:55.535 --> 01:58:02.620]  Common law and say they've done all these things and guess what they're still subject to the same laws that the elite Impose on all of us.
[01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:06.002]  Is it a criminal system outside of constitutional government?
[01:58:06.002 --> 01:58:20.912]  Absolutely, but I think the main purpose that Discussing that is is to wake people up to that fact and the tyranny of the Federal Reserve That's why we're behind 1207 audit the Fed go after them expose their lies We're gonna have Gary Lachman
[01:58:21.232 --> 01:58:23.313]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:23.313 --> 01:58:25.493]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:55.171]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.171 --> 01:58:56.091]  Number one.
[01:58:56.091 --> 01:58:59.512]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.512 --> 01:59:00.372]  Number two.
[01:59:00.372 --> 01:59:05.254]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.254 --> 01:59:06.014]  It's true.
[01:59:06.014 --> 01:59:10.556]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.876 --> 01:59:11.697]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.697 --> 01:59:15.280]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:19.203]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.203 --> 01:59:20.004]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.004 --> 01:59:22.766]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.

[02:00:17.737 --> 02:00:21.782]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.877 --> 02:00:24.937]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:24.937 --> 02:00:25.578]  We are back.
[02:00:25.578 --> 02:00:27.158]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:27.158 --> 02:00:29.139]  Alex is on assignment out in Dallas.
[02:00:29.139 --> 02:00:31.440]  He may be calling in later in the program.
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:32.900]  I am Jason Burmess sitting in.
[02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:39.622]  And now we go to our latest guest, Gary Lachman, who's actually a musician turned writer.
[02:00:39.622 --> 02:00:43.184]  He is one of the founding members of Blondie, one of the guitar players there.
[02:00:43.184 --> 02:00:49.226]  His latest book is Politics and the Occult, The Right, the Left, and the Radically Unseen.
[02:00:49.226 --> 02:00:50.066]  How are you today, Gary?
[02:00:50.586 --> 02:00:51.006]  I'm fine.
[02:00:51.006 --> 02:00:51.847]  How are you?
[02:00:51.847 --> 02:00:52.507]  Good.
[02:00:52.507 --> 02:00:54.828]  So why do you choose this subject matter?
[02:00:54.828 --> 02:01:00.470]  Why do you start going into not only the occult, but politics and how they intertwine?
[02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:03.812]  Well, it's something that I've been interested in for a while.
[02:01:03.812 --> 02:01:13.276]  There were, well, there's quite a few books written about it, but mostly from the perspective of Hitler and the Nazis, rather.
[02:01:14.814 --> 02:01:17.755]  To me, rather sensational sort of book.
[02:01:17.755 --> 02:01:34.520]  And generally the attitude towards it is that any sort of encounter between politics and the occult or mysticism or the esoteric tends to be on the far right of the spectrum.
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:42.762]  And it tends to give esotericism or any interest in the occult or occultism a kind of bad
[02:01:43.772 --> 02:01:47.416]  A bad reputation from one point of view.
[02:01:47.416 --> 02:01:54.843]  And what I wanted to do was to show that while there is that, that's certainly a part of it, that doesn't cover all the bases.
[02:01:54.843 --> 02:02:00.169]  There's actually a progressive, you could call a left, or a liberal,
[02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:02.731]  We're good to go.
[02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:24.352]  I don't know.
[02:02:37.076 --> 02:02:44.022]  Well, before we get into the left, right, and their different flavors of the occult, you mentioned Hitler and the Nazis.
[02:02:44.022 --> 02:03:02.237]  And Hitler really did believe that symbols like the SS logo and the swastika, which was really a sun symbol, which he adopted and put into a white, red, and black color scheme, did give his political party power as well as his, you know, warmongering.
[02:03:03.058 --> 02:03:05.279]  Well, I mean, it's been around for quite some time.
[02:03:05.279 --> 02:03:07.279]  It's an ancient symbol.
[02:03:07.279 --> 02:03:09.640]  It goes back to Neolithic times.
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:13.361]  There's cave paintings with it, and cave etchings.
[02:03:13.361 --> 02:03:20.722]  And there's a long-standing myth that if it's turned in the clockwise direction, it's good, and if it's turned in the opposite, I forget which it is.
[02:03:20.722 --> 02:03:22.883]  But it turns up going both ways.
[02:03:23.463 --> 02:03:25.246]  Clockwise and anticlockwise.
[02:03:25.246 --> 02:03:29.411]  And the myth was that Hitler had taken it the anticlockwise way, which is the evil way.
[02:03:29.411 --> 02:03:31.193]  But again, that's sort of a myth.
[02:03:31.193 --> 02:03:36.540]  No, I think Hitler was very astute about the power that symbols and myths...
[02:03:37.564 --> 02:03:38.205]  I don't know.
[02:03:57.185 --> 02:04:15.096]  There was a magazine called Astara, if I recall correctly, that was a anti-Semitic, anti-Marxist, anti-Democratic, you know, pretty much anti-everything, except sort of white, conservative, Viennese, you know, culture.
[02:04:15.096 --> 02:04:17.578]  And it used a swastika as its symbol.
[02:04:17.578 --> 02:04:18.898]  So it was something that was around.
[02:04:18.898 --> 02:04:22.501]  I mean, you find it in a lot of different contexts, and in many ways it's
[02:04:24.499 --> 02:04:31.046]  A sad thing that it's so completely associated with Hitler and the Nazis now that it's completely unredeemable.
[02:04:32.003 --> 02:04:32.644]  Absolutely.
[02:04:32.644 --> 02:04:37.087]  I mean, that's what everybody that I know would associate the swastika with.
[02:04:37.087 --> 02:04:43.193]  A lot of people don't understand it was used by Native Americans and many other cultures, again, as a symbol.
[02:04:43.193 --> 02:04:56.284]  When we come back, I want to discuss the right-wing flavor of the occult and then get into the left-wing flavor, but really how these people don't present themselves to the public as occultists and they really hide their true religion.
[02:04:56.284 --> 02:04:57.885]  We'll be back after this.
[02:04:57.885 --> 02:04:58.746]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:58.746 --> 02:04:59.587]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.

[02:06:05.805 --> 02:06:09.048]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:09.048 --> 02:06:13.852]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:13.852 --> 02:06:20.258]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.258 --> 02:06:22.481]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:23.001 --> 02:06:23.321]  Tim Geithner?
[02:06:23.321 --> 02:06:23.842]  Bernanke?
[02:06:23.842 --> 02:06:24.622]  They're arsonists!
[02:06:24.622 --> 02:06:25.783]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:25.783 --> 02:06:28.024]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:41.914 --> 02:06:49.202]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:06:49.202 --> 02:06:58.313]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:07:01.087 --> 02:07:04.090]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.090 --> 02:07:09.415]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.415 --> 02:07:11.476]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.476 --> 02:07:16.481]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.481 --> 02:07:17.382]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.642 --> 02:07:18.763]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.763 --> 02:07:20.664]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.664 --> 02:07:21.725]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.725 --> 02:07:23.926]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.926 --> 02:07:25.267]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.267 --> 02:07:26.808]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.808 --> 02:07:32.072]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.072 --> 02:07:35.654]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.654 --> 02:07:39.117]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.477 --> 02:07:40.697]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.697 --> 02:07:41.597]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.597 --> 02:07:42.698]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.698 --> 02:07:43.638]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.638 --> 02:07:44.718]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.718 --> 02:07:47.779]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.779 --> 02:07:49.979]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.979 --> 02:07:51.079]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:51.079 --> 02:07:54.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:14.421]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:14.421 --> 02:08:22.945]  We're streaming on PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com, being broadcast with all our great affiliates across the nation.
[02:08:22.945 --> 02:08:25.346]  Gary Lachman is our guest.
[02:08:25.346 --> 02:08:29.507]  His book, Politics and the Occult, The Right, The Left, and the Radically Unseen.
[02:08:29.507 --> 02:08:34.430]  We just discussed Hitler and the Nazis' use of the SS symbols, the swastika.
[02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:35.630]  I mean,
[02:08:57.774 --> 02:09:01.537]  You look at Bohemian Grove, they seem to have this owl as a mascot.
[02:09:01.537 --> 02:09:04.540]  Some people interpret it as Moloch, others don't.
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:07.923]  But they also have a Buddha or a Maitreya figure there.
[02:09:07.923 --> 02:09:10.925]  They have Saint John of Maplenuk.
[02:09:10.925 --> 02:09:13.287]  What do you think they're doing up there in the Grove?
[02:09:13.287 --> 02:09:16.550]  Well, to tell you the truth, I know about Bohemian Grove.
[02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:18.632]  I've read a bit about it, but I don't really cover it in the book.
[02:09:18.632 --> 02:09:20.454]  So it's not really my patch.
[02:09:20.454 --> 02:09:23.456]  So to tell you the truth, I don't.
[02:09:23.456 --> 02:09:24.477]  I haven't a slightest idea.
[02:09:25.950 --> 02:09:29.111]  So would you consider that stuff, the right-wing aspect?
[02:09:29.111 --> 02:09:42.313]  I mean, that's where, you know, Bush, his father go... Yeah, well, I mean, traditionally the right-wing aspect of politics and the occult is, it's linked to tradition.
[02:09:42.313 --> 02:09:53.875]  And it's a response to the rise of the modern world, which mostly means the rise of democracy, or the rise of some form of socialism of left.
[02:09:54.951 --> 02:09:55.431]  I think so.
[02:10:09.417 --> 02:10:18.182]  The king, the queen, and all those people that are, you know, in a hierarchical, higher level than the common person.
[02:10:18.182 --> 02:10:27.628]  And this was something that was completely feared by many traditional thinking people in Europe.
[02:10:27.628 --> 02:10:30.810]  That's the area that I cover in the book mostly.
[02:10:30.810 --> 02:10:32.270]  And again, as I said, this is a response.
[02:10:35.296 --> 02:10:51.083]  Throughout the last few centuries, I started in the early 1600s with the appearance of, well, the non-appearance, actually, of a group called the Rosicrucians, and they're an example of progressive, kind of what we would call sort of left occult political thinking.
[02:10:51.083 --> 02:10:59.827]  But with the rise of the modern world, with the breakdown of the hierarchy, the loss of religion as a very strong element in society,
[02:11:00.668 --> 02:11:06.499]  Uh, many groups reacted to that and they reacted in a way that they saw.
[02:11:07.578 --> 02:11:12.459]  Different forms of esotericism, different forms of sort of mysticism or cult thinking.
[02:11:12.459 --> 02:11:18.380]  This was a place where that notion of tradition was still alive and it was still viable.
[02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:23.101]  And so they sort of took elements from that.
[02:11:23.101 --> 02:11:30.922]  And again, this is, you know, I don't really do conspiracy theories and I don't really do the kind of what's going on in the back room sort of thing.
[02:11:30.922 --> 02:11:35.263]  I basically looked at history, upfront history that's available, you know, in books.
[02:11:35.824 --> 02:11:36.065]  I'm good.
[02:11:42.344 --> 02:11:59.748]  People with an occult bent were involved in politics, or where certain occultists or certain people that were esoteric thinkers tried to take their ideas and to put them into practice in politics or social theory.
[02:11:59.748 --> 02:12:03.249]  And again, this is a response to the modern world.
[02:12:03.249 --> 02:12:06.950]  It's an anti-egalitarian, anti-democratic,
[02:12:07.623 --> 02:12:15.881]  Anti-socialist or communist or anything that is supporting the idea of getting rid of the hierarchy.
[02:12:16.876 --> 02:12:31.024]  Um, so that's, you know, in many ways, you know, I don't know if that's what's going on in the whole bohemian grove or, you know, skull and bones and all that sort of thing, but I wouldn't be surprised, although I would say it wouldn't necessarily be a religious one.
[02:12:31.024 --> 02:12:34.126]  It would probably be more, you know, of an economic one, a financial one.
[02:12:34.126 --> 02:12:36.607]  Well, what are some of these modern examples?
[02:12:38.984 --> 02:12:43.067]  What are some of these modern examples, then, of what you consider the left and the occult?
[02:12:43.067 --> 02:12:45.209]  Some of the organizations or the people?
[02:12:45.209 --> 02:12:47.110]  Well, again, it's historical.
[02:12:47.110 --> 02:13:03.843]  If you look at somebody like the Theosophy, the Theosophical Society, which was started in 1875 by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, this wild, eccentric Russian woman who, after a crazy life, packed with enough life for a dozen people, wound up in New York in 1875.
[02:13:07.435 --> 02:13:15.630]  She herself wasn't so much directly involved in this, but her successor, a woman named Annie
[02:13:16.781 --> 02:13:19.442]  Who was, in England, a major socialist.
[02:13:19.442 --> 02:13:20.282]  She was a Fabian.
[02:13:20.282 --> 02:13:29.146]  The Fabians were an early socialist think-tank, more or less, in late 19th, early 20th century England.
[02:13:29.146 --> 02:13:30.467]  And Annie MacFarlane was one of those.
[02:13:30.467 --> 02:13:39.110]  She was for women's rights, she was for free love, she was for better working conditions, for working people.
[02:13:39.110 --> 02:13:43.872]  There was a famous strike called the Match Girl Strike that she was involved in that she was put into jail for and all that.
[02:13:44.873 --> 02:13:49.477]  She got involved with Theosophy and really threw herself into it.
[02:13:49.477 --> 02:13:59.967]  And Theosophy, as you probably know, gets a great deal of its philosophy's ideas from India, from Indian thought, from the mystic East.
[02:13:59.967 --> 02:14:07.835]  And so she went to India and she became actually, you know, hands-on involved in Indian independence.
[02:14:08.896 --> 02:14:13.518]  Uh, you know, getting rid of the Raj, um, India, India for India.
[02:14:13.518 --> 02:14:21.640]  And also, uh, involved with that was reintroducing to the Indian people a great deal of their heritage that had been, um, lost while they were under the British rule.
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:28.202]  Things like, uh, the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, all these great works of Indian Hindu mysticism and spirituality.
[02:14:28.662 --> 02:14:35.187]  The Indian people of the time were more or less ignorant of those because they've been brought up under British rule, and she reintroduced that to them.
[02:14:35.187 --> 02:14:47.457]  So there you have an example of someone, you know, working for the national identity of an indigenous people, which is a very progressive left sort of idea, and also their independence.
[02:14:47.457 --> 02:14:49.339]  So again, this is something that was, you know, really
[02:14:50.437 --> 02:14:51.578]  Uh, it was there.
[02:14:51.578 --> 02:14:52.298]  It wasn't hidden.
[02:14:52.298 --> 02:14:53.219]  It wasn't secret.
[02:14:53.219 --> 02:14:55.440]  It was something that was, you know, right up front.
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:59.723]  And that even fascinates me more because, I mean, I tend not to go down to conspiracy.
[02:15:00.675 --> 02:15:02.836]  Uh, theory, really, because it's such a can of worms.
[02:15:02.836 --> 02:15:07.817]  You know, once you open them up, once you open that door, there's lots of other doors to open.
[02:15:07.817 --> 02:15:10.879]  And I feel you can get lost in it, and you never quite arrive anywhere.
[02:15:10.879 --> 02:15:26.904]  So, uh, I decided at the beginning that I'm not going to go that way, but I'm just going to show, you can, you can trace in history where there have been, um, times when, uh, I keep saying it's called politics, but in many ways it's, you know, it's a religious, it's a spiritual, it's a politics that's motivated by,
[02:15:27.464 --> 02:15:27.944]  We're good to go.
[02:15:49.495 --> 02:15:56.498]  And, um, in both sides of the fence, both the left and the right, there have been different groups who have tried to, you know, introduce that.
[02:15:56.498 --> 02:16:03.662]  You know, there's people that say, like, you know, the States, the United States themselves, I mean, I live in London now, but I, you know, grew up in the States.
[02:16:03.662 --> 02:16:16.247]  You know, the Founding Fathers were all Masons, and there was a whole Masonic set of ideas that was involved in the origin of the States, and there's even books written about how Washington, D.C.
[02:16:16.247 --> 02:16:17.788]  is, you know, laid out according to these
[02:16:18.308 --> 02:16:18.528]  It's true.
[02:16:36.801 --> 02:16:37.722]  In the air, as it were.
[02:16:56.321 --> 02:17:02.886]  I mean, I'm sure other books probably deal with the guys in the back room, you know, with the shape of their arms... But you keep saying conspir... Hold on, let me stop you for a second.
[02:17:02.886 --> 02:17:08.010]  Let me stop you, because you keep saying conspiracy theories and people in the back room.
[02:17:08.010 --> 02:17:11.372]  You know, I'm holding their own annals.
[02:17:11.372 --> 02:17:12.433]  I can name the members.
[02:17:12.433 --> 02:17:14.815]  I mean, they've taken pictures with the organization.
[02:17:14.815 --> 02:17:16.056]  They're openly members.
[02:17:16.056 --> 02:17:21.740]  People like Newt Gingrich, who proposed themselves as Christian conservatives, are members of the occult.
[02:17:21.740 --> 02:17:25.243]  I'm sure you've come across dozens, if not hundreds of names.
[02:17:27.174 --> 02:17:30.238]  Well, don't you, wouldn't you consider, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[02:17:30.238 --> 02:17:41.589]  Yeah, but wouldn't you consider a society that openly does rituals to their deity, an owl, and again, this is inscribed in the... As I said, and I basically said this when your producer got in touch with me, I said,
[02:17:42.270 --> 02:17:43.811]  I don't do conspiracy theories.
[02:17:43.811 --> 02:17:46.613]  Yeah, but you keep saying, hold on, you keep saying conspiracy theory.
[02:17:46.613 --> 02:17:47.033]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:17:47.033 --> 02:17:49.054]  You keep saying conspiracy theory, Gary.
[02:17:49.054 --> 02:17:50.595]  You keep saying conspiracy theory.
[02:17:50.595 --> 02:17:54.398]  I'm showing their pictures in their own books with their own words.
[02:17:54.398 --> 02:17:57.280]  So where is the, well, where is the conspiracy theory in that?
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:17:58.520]  I mean, you turned to Blaski.
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:01.322]  I don't know how that's different than you quoting Blaski.
[02:18:01.322 --> 02:18:04.224]  Well, look, I'm not going to be shouting that to you, you know.
[02:18:04.224 --> 02:18:06.165]  I've given up an evening to do this, you know.
[02:18:06.165 --> 02:18:08.026]  I'm happy to watch the news.
[02:18:08.026 --> 02:18:08.907]  The thing is that
[02:18:09.970 --> 02:18:11.191]  I don't know anything about it.
[02:18:11.191 --> 02:18:14.293]  So you can ask me questions about them, and I can't give you an intelligent answer.
[02:18:14.293 --> 02:18:17.355]  But you're saying that all these people are openly occultists?
[02:18:17.355 --> 02:18:19.936]  If you read the book, if you looked at the book, you'd know what I talked about.
[02:18:19.936 --> 02:18:22.578]  Well, I would be happy to read the book.
[02:18:22.578 --> 02:18:26.240]  I'm sorry, I'm substituting on the show today, and I just got thrown you.
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:27.641]  I didn't realize that.
[02:18:27.641 --> 02:18:30.943]  I'm happy to talk about anything in the book, but I don't want to talk about something I don't know anything about.
[02:18:31.617 --> 02:18:46.131]  Yeah, but again, you're saying that all these people are out in the open... Hold on, you're saying that all these people... But Gary, you're saying, in your own words, that all these people are out in the open when the very meaning of the term occult is hidden, is it not?
[02:18:46.131 --> 02:18:51.916]  It's hidden, but it's hidden in the same way that, you know, when the earth passes between
[02:18:53.357 --> 02:18:54.718]  The rays of the sun and the moon.
[02:18:54.718 --> 02:18:56.918]  The moon is eclipsed.
[02:18:56.918 --> 02:18:58.099]  It's occluded.
[02:18:58.099 --> 02:19:09.503]  So, I mean, you could take out any book on, you know, history of theosophy, and you can read, or any biography of Annie de Saint, and you'll find this out about her.
[02:19:09.503 --> 02:19:18.546]  Just like you can find out about someone like a fellow named Julius Ebola, who was an Italian occultist and esotericist in the
[02:19:19.706 --> 02:19:31.376]  20s, 30s, and 40s, who wrote books about a variety of different esoteric ideas, and he tried to influence first Mussolini, and then Hitler.
[02:19:31.376 --> 02:19:39.202]  And he had certain ideas about a spiritual kind of elite, and a spiritual aristocracy, and how society should be based on that, and so on and so on.
[02:19:39.202 --> 02:19:41.084]  So he's out in the open.
[02:19:41.084 --> 02:19:42.425]  I mean, these things are there.
[02:19:42.425 --> 02:19:44.847]  I mean, the fact that he's out in the open is if you do the research,
[02:19:45.707 --> 02:19:50.850]  Well, you know, I'm pretty well versed in people like Manly P. Hall that have written about this, Nicholas Rorick.
[02:19:50.850 --> 02:19:56.272]  They are definitely out in the open, but I find more often than not, those involved in the modern occult are not.
[02:19:56.272 --> 02:19:59.513]  So I want to get into what you think their endgame is after this.
[02:19:59.513 --> 02:20:00.334]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:01.516 --> 02:20:03.937]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[02:20:03.937 --> 02:20:05.818]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?

[02:20:07.678 --> 02:20:09.099]  We paid off all of our bills.

[02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:17.542]  With NoMoreMortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[02:20:17.542 --> 02:20:19.223]  Even have more money left over each month?
[02:20:19.223 --> 02:20:21.884]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[02:20:21.884 --> 02:20:22.284]  NoMoreMortgage.
[02:20:24.325 --> 02:20:25.605]  Where have they been all of our life?
[02:20:25.605 --> 02:20:28.106]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.

[02:22:02.102 --> 02:22:03.142]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:03.142 --> 02:22:08.665]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:08.665 --> 02:22:09.205]  I get it.
[02:22:09.205 --> 02:22:18.829]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:18.829 --> 02:22:19.969]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:20.229 --> 02:22:28.717]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:22:28.717 --> 02:22:32.100]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:36.384]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:36.384 --> 02:22:37.985]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:37.985 --> 02:22:41.388]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:41.388 --> 02:22:45.532]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:45.732 --> 02:22:46.633]  You should too.
[02:22:46.633 --> 02:22:47.794]  Find out what they know.
[02:22:47.794 --> 02:22:50.717]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.

[02:22:50.837 --> 02:22:51.197]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.627 --> 02:23:09.377]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.

[02:23:34.378 --> 02:23:36.459]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:23:36.459 --> 02:23:38.199]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:23:38.199 --> 02:23:40.740]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:23:40.740 --> 02:23:45.461]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:23:45.461 --> 02:23:49.163]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:23:49.163 --> 02:23:52.284]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:23:52.284 --> 02:23:54.184]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:23:54.184 --> 02:23:56.305]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:24:19.783 --> 02:24:21.244]  We are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:21.244 --> 02:24:22.745]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in.
[02:24:22.745 --> 02:24:26.027]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:24:26.027 --> 02:24:27.509]  Our guest is Gary Lockman.
[02:24:27.509 --> 02:24:31.872]  He's the author of Politics and the Occult, The Right, The Left, and the Radically Unseen.
[02:24:33.499 --> 02:24:38.806]  I guess I want to ask you, Gary, you keep talking about a progressive elite that are into the occult.
[02:24:38.806 --> 02:24:41.109]  If they get their way, what does the world look like?
[02:24:41.109 --> 02:24:42.410]  What are they working towards?
[02:24:42.410 --> 02:24:43.972]  Well, there isn't a they.
[02:24:43.972 --> 02:24:46.556]  It's not like there's one group.
[02:24:46.556 --> 02:24:51.983]  I give a variety of different examples of a more left-oriented or progressive
[02:24:53.177 --> 02:24:56.459]  Uh, interest in the occult, that is, you know, linked up with politics.
[02:24:56.459 --> 02:24:59.100]  And I gave you one, there you go, Annie Vasantu.
[02:24:59.100 --> 02:25:01.781]  Yeah, but in the beginning you said... Let me answer your question.
[02:25:01.781 --> 02:25:01.941]  Sure.
[02:25:01.941 --> 02:25:05.243]  I gave you one, Annie Vasantu, involved in Indian independence.
[02:25:05.243 --> 02:25:06.923]  Uh, it's a historical book.
[02:25:06.923 --> 02:25:08.084]  It's about history.
[02:25:08.084 --> 02:25:19.729]  I start in the 1600s, I go up to, you know, just sort of... I mean, a lot of people talk about it, you know, the Christian fundamentalists involved in the left-behind theory of the Western states, that are big, you know, bestsellers and all that.
[02:25:20.209 --> 02:25:33.039]  You know, if you look at something like early 20th century England, where I just talked about the Babians, you had a whole, just before World War I, you had a whole slew of sort of
[02:25:33.943 --> 02:25:34.243]  I think?
[02:25:50.450 --> 02:26:06.593]  But when they were doing it in other 20 countries, especially here in England where I'm living now, they were associated with these very progressive ideas, like free love was one of them, white education, religious tolerance, social tolerance, a breakdown of the class system.
[02:26:07.335 --> 02:26:17.189]  And, but if you want to go to, I mean, those people involved, there wasn't like one group who had an agenda to go and, you know, sort of, you know, pursue in politics.
[02:26:17.189 --> 02:26:23.338]  But if you go earlier, say, in the late 18th century, which is sort of the heyday of Freemasonry,
[02:26:24.265 --> 02:26:32.892]  Uh, when, um, especially in Central Europe and in German-speaking countries, you had, uh, this is, you know, the Illuminati come out of that time.
[02:26:32.892 --> 02:26:36.355]  It's got nothing to do with the film with Tom Hanks.
[02:26:36.355 --> 02:26:52.308]  But, um, you have famous people like Mozart, you have people like the German poet Goethe, and many other very influential thinkers and writers who were really involved in this platonic notion of, again, of religious tolerance,
[02:26:53.007 --> 02:26:57.388]  of racial tolerance, of sexual tolerance.
[02:26:57.388 --> 02:27:01.489]  That's when you started to have Masonic groups that allowed women in.
[02:27:01.489 --> 02:27:06.231]  They allowed Jews and Christians who stood side by side at these Masonic meetings.
[02:27:06.231 --> 02:27:10.772]  And there was an idea that if these nations, if these ideas of the Brotherhood of Man
[02:27:11.472 --> 02:27:20.155]  And this kind of individual freedom and social tolerance, were they to spread, there would be a new age in Europe.
[02:27:20.155 --> 02:27:29.259]  Now, unfortunately what happened is a lot of those ideas got fed into a lot of the radical groups involved at the beginning of the French Revolution.
[02:27:30.199 --> 02:27:42.488]  And, uh, it went completely out the window, you know, it went from this fantastic dawn of a new age to, you know, to the terror, when, you know, people were getting, you know, their heads chopped off left and right all over Paris, and all their hopes were dashed.
[02:27:42.488 --> 02:27:47.072]  They, they, they, they just kind of, people just, they just, they just turned into a nightmare.
[02:27:47.072 --> 02:27:55.758]  And then out of it you get, you get, you get a new right wing, uh, sort of masonic, um, sensibility coming up, as a reaction to, sort of, you know, the, the,
[02:27:56.707 --> 02:27:59.850]  The terror, as a reaction to the revolutionary sensibility.
[02:27:59.850 --> 02:28:22.650]  If I wanted to pocket it in two different ways, I would say the progressive people that have brought esoteric ideas into politics, they're trying, they want to, basically what they'd like to do is create the kind of socially religious, gender tolerant society that we give a lot of mouth, we give a lot of lip service to these days, the pluralistic
[02:28:23.189 --> 02:28:25.150]  We only have about 90 seconds left, Gary.
[02:28:25.150 --> 02:28:31.751]  In the beginning of the interview, you said that the left and the right seem to converge on this same idea.
[02:28:31.751 --> 02:28:33.812]  Is this the one that you're talking about, basically?
[02:28:33.812 --> 02:28:33.992]  No, no, no.
[02:28:33.992 --> 02:28:37.813]  The left and the right, they come together because they both hate the modern world.
[02:28:37.813 --> 02:28:39.794]  They both find the modern world...
[02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:43.521]  Uh, evil, for different reasons.
[02:28:43.521 --> 02:28:46.482]  But are they pushing for different things, is I'm asking?
[02:28:46.482 --> 02:28:49.383]  From the right point of view, it's a complete loss of tradition.
[02:28:49.383 --> 02:28:51.663]  It's the leveling of society.
[02:28:51.663 --> 02:28:53.604]  It's the whole loss of any kind of hierarchy.
[02:28:53.604 --> 02:28:58.006]  It's the loss of any kind of order of rank, where anything goes, you know.
[02:28:58.006 --> 02:29:02.027]  And from the left position, it's the rise of capitalism.
[02:29:02.027 --> 02:29:03.607]  It's the rise of laissez-faire.
[02:29:03.607 --> 02:29:04.468]  It's the rise of
[02:29:06.273 --> 02:29:09.055]  Um, you know, basically every man out for himself.
[02:29:09.055 --> 02:29:19.680]  Um, which, you know, uh, and the duping of the masses through things like the culture industry and, you know, television, popular entertainment, and all that sort of thing.
[02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:25.583]  So both of them, both sides, um... Gary, Gary, let me just stop you just for a second.
[02:29:25.583 --> 02:29:27.304]  One last question, one last question.
[02:29:27.304 --> 02:29:28.245]  I mean, thank you for your time.
[02:29:28.245 --> 02:29:29.785]  Gary, are you an occultist?
[02:29:29.785 --> 02:29:31.346]  No, I don't practice anything.
[02:29:31.346 --> 02:29:32.627]  I'm a historian and a philosopher.
[02:29:33.311 --> 02:29:34.412]  Okay, thank you very much.
[02:29:34.412 --> 02:29:39.015]  The book is Politics and the Cult, The Right, the Left, and the Radically Unseen.
[02:29:39.015 --> 02:29:39.916]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:39.916 --> 02:29:40.796]  We'll be back after this.
[02:29:40.796 --> 02:29:51.724]  I'm Jason Bermas, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[02:29:51.724 --> 02:29:53.105]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.105 --> 02:29:55.647]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.647 --> 02:29:58.329]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.865 --> 02:30:04.966]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:30:04.966 --> 02:30:07.847]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[02:32:00.416 --> 02:32:05.723]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:32:05.723 --> 02:32:10.249]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:32:10.249 --> 02:32:12.532]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:32:12.532 --> 02:32:14.154]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:32:14.154 --> 02:32:15.196]  There is a solution.

[02:33:06.892 --> 02:33:07.802]  This is the end.
[02:33:09.827 --> 02:33:13.789]  We are back, streaming live over at PrisonPlan.TV and InfoWars.com.
[02:33:13.789 --> 02:33:16.170]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.170 --> 02:33:17.651]  Alex out on assignment.
[02:33:17.651 --> 02:33:19.812]  What a guest right there.
[02:33:19.812 --> 02:33:21.253]  Gary Lachman.
[02:33:21.253 --> 02:33:23.934]  I would have had him on for longer, but he kept cutting me off.
[02:33:23.934 --> 02:33:26.015]  He wouldn't let me ask questions.
[02:33:26.015 --> 02:33:26.436]  Okay?
[02:33:26.436 --> 02:33:30.778]  He was giving this self-righteous attitude that I was bringing up conspiracy theories.
[02:33:30.778 --> 02:33:34.360]  Now, if we can get to the document cam, and I'll read this for the viewers over here.
[02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:38.542]  I'd like them to see that this anal of the Bohemian Club that I got off of eBay,
[02:33:39.810 --> 02:33:50.286]  Clearly states in its inscription right here, by the way, William Randolph Hearst, a member, just occult things all over his property, to our tutelary deity.
[02:33:50.286 --> 02:33:50.967]  Can we not get that?
[02:33:50.967 --> 02:33:51.788]  There we go.
[02:33:51.788 --> 02:33:52.349]  The owl.
[02:33:53.297 --> 02:33:57.839]  This book is a reverently and affectionately inscribed.
[02:33:57.839 --> 02:33:58.899]  Their deity.
[02:33:58.899 --> 02:33:59.920]  Please look at that.
[02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:01.561]  Now you look through this book.
[02:34:01.561 --> 02:34:02.901]  I'm just going to thumb through it really quick.
[02:34:02.901 --> 02:34:09.884]  I'm going to try to find the Montezuma play where they actually do mock human sacrifices.
[02:34:09.884 --> 02:34:12.305]  Now that's not the cremation of care ceremony.
[02:34:12.305 --> 02:34:13.526]  This is separate.
[02:34:13.526 --> 02:34:16.367]  This is, there's the old man in the tree.
[02:34:16.367 --> 02:34:20.149]  See, they have rituals and they have quote-unquote plays.
[02:34:21.052 --> 02:34:21.532]  That they do.
[02:34:21.532 --> 02:34:24.275]  And remember, it's an all-male club, so they get dressed up.
[02:34:24.275 --> 02:34:25.796]  Here it is right here.
[02:34:25.796 --> 02:34:27.197]  They get dressed up in drag.
[02:34:27.197 --> 02:34:36.045]  Now, what you see here is three separate gentlemen holding down a sacrifice as the high priest with a sun symbol on his head.
[02:34:36.045 --> 02:34:37.186]  Notice that there.
[02:34:37.186 --> 02:34:39.448]  And remember, this guy's talking about earth worship.
[02:34:39.448 --> 02:34:40.709]  He's talking about sun worship.
[02:34:40.709 --> 02:34:46.353]  But then he denies that anybody in the occult actually hides the fact that they are in the occult.
[02:34:47.054 --> 02:34:49.696]  And he keeps talking about this modern progressive society.
[02:34:49.696 --> 02:34:51.016]  I got news for you, folks.
[02:34:51.016 --> 02:34:55.259]  When people are talking about a new age, that's globalization.
[02:34:55.259 --> 02:34:57.920]  That's new world order.
[02:34:57.920 --> 02:35:04.684]  And they always try to wrap it in, oh, it's going to be better for humanity, we're going to be more tolerant, we're going to be a better society.
[02:35:04.684 --> 02:35:10.728]  No, what it really means is consolidation of power by psychopathic elitists.
[02:35:10.728 --> 02:35:15.351]  They've been doing this for hundreds of years, if not thousands.
[02:35:16.497 --> 02:35:18.999]  And, you know, the Theosophic Society.
[02:35:18.999 --> 02:35:21.261]  You want to know about the Theosophic Society, folks?
[02:35:21.261 --> 02:35:22.022]  This is what you do.
[02:35:22.022 --> 02:35:27.226]  You go to InfoWars.com and you get the America's Secret Beginnings series.
[02:35:27.226 --> 02:35:31.489]  Now, he admitted in the interview that, yes, Washington, D.C.
[02:35:31.489 --> 02:35:36.153]  is laid out by the occult, by occultic symbols.
[02:35:37.577 --> 02:35:40.798]  Yet, most mainline Masons will still deny that to this day.
[02:35:40.798 --> 02:35:46.539]  Now, he admitted to it, but he thinks it's all a good thing, and he's a philosopher, apparently.
[02:35:46.539 --> 02:35:51.521]  I wouldn't be surprised if he's taken part in what I would call pagan rituals.
[02:35:51.521 --> 02:35:55.562]  So, get to Infowars.com, get the entire America's Secret Beginning series.
[02:35:55.562 --> 02:35:56.742]  I think you can get all three for $44.95.
[02:35:56.742 --> 02:36:03.324]  You can go to Infowars.com right now and get Truth Rising, Endgame, The Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic,
[02:36:03.784 --> 02:36:22.589]  And a free t-shirt, either the one I'm wearing here, which is, I believe, the End the Fed t-shirt, which is a great one, or the Obama Info Wars t-shirt, all for $44.95, and for even less, for $39.95, you get 12 months of PrisonPlanet.tv, all of the broadcasts, all the podcasts, all of our movies.
[02:36:22.589 --> 02:36:25.610]  Remember, I've got a movie coming out in February, Invisible Empire.
[02:36:25.610 --> 02:36:26.790]  Go check out the trailer.
[02:36:28.154 --> 02:36:29.875]  That one's due out February 12th.
[02:36:29.875 --> 02:36:31.136]  I'm really excited about this picture.
[02:36:31.136 --> 02:36:39.263]  That one is really the killer of this notion that these people are our friends, that they're trying to build a better society.
[02:36:39.263 --> 02:36:54.915]  No, my movie exposes the fact that they are into the occult, that they do want one world government, that they do want to cull a massive percentage of us, that they do want to tax us for breathing with a carbon tax, that they have been doing this openly, openly,
[02:36:55.735 --> 02:37:06.042]  In government documents, in books, in speeches, for well over a hundred years, Hitler talked about a new world order.
[02:37:06.042 --> 02:37:09.764]  George Bush Senior talked about a new world order.
[02:37:09.764 --> 02:37:14.267]  Gordon Brown and Tony Blair talk about a new world order.
[02:37:14.267 --> 02:37:15.708]  All right, I said I'd take your calls.
[02:37:15.708 --> 02:37:16.949]  Let's jump to the callers.
[02:37:16.949 --> 02:37:17.829]  They've been home a long time.
[02:37:17.829 --> 02:37:19.530]  Let's go to Randy in Georgia.
[02:37:19.530 --> 02:37:21.292]  Randy, you're online.
[02:37:21.292 --> 02:37:21.912]  Hi, Jason.
[02:37:21.912 --> 02:37:23.373]  How are you doing?
[02:37:24.381 --> 02:37:25.582]  I'm good.
[02:37:25.582 --> 02:37:38.714]  Well, actually, I am seven months pregnant and I know Alex Jones said in Texas that the state kept the blood in the blood bank from the newborn.
[02:37:38.714 --> 02:37:48.623]  So I decided to, you know, because I never read over like the privacy practices and all those things, so I decided to read it this time because
[02:37:49.156 --> 02:37:59.398]  I've been doing the research, like with Dr. Sherry Pinpenny and, you know, listening in about the vaccines and all those other things, so I really don't want to get my second child vaccinated.
[02:37:59.398 --> 02:38:15.542]  So, um, but I was reading in the privacy practices, basically what they're saying is, um, that they have from A to zero, I mean A to zero, A to O in their policies, that they can send out your information without leaving your consent.
[02:38:16.653 --> 02:38:21.675]  So, and I just thought that was really funny and I called up to the hospital to see if I can get a waiver.
[02:38:21.675 --> 02:38:28.577]  I got, I was, um, got to run around like eight times and still haven't been able to talk to anybody.
[02:38:28.577 --> 02:38:31.918]  And, um, I just thought that was pretty interesting.
[02:38:31.918 --> 02:38:34.159]  Well, they do this across the board, Randy.
[02:38:34.159 --> 02:38:41.961]  I mean, you look at Australia, they had to come clean a couple of years ago that they had been, you know, databasing everybody's DNA since the seventies.
[02:38:41.961 --> 02:38:44.282]  You look at the police in this country.
[02:38:44.502 --> 02:38:48.746]  You're supposed to give up your fingerprints, but if you're not convicted of anything, you're supposed to get those back.
[02:38:48.746 --> 02:38:50.628]  Those are in a database somewhere.
[02:38:50.628 --> 02:38:55.233]  They openly want to create a medical database under this health care bill.
[02:38:55.233 --> 02:38:57.415]  They're coming for you, and they will give you the runaround.
[02:38:57.415 --> 02:39:00.859]  They don't want you to have any kind of personal privacy.
[02:39:00.859 --> 02:39:02.620]  They want to take your humanity away from you.
[02:39:02.620 --> 02:39:03.722]  I thank you for the call.
[02:39:03.722 --> 02:39:04.803]  Let's jump to our next caller.
[02:39:04.803 --> 02:39:06.284]  Let's go to Chris in Florida.
[02:39:06.284 --> 02:39:06.925]  Chris, you're on the line.
[02:39:08.347 --> 02:39:36.842]  Well, Jason, this climate gate being investigated by Penn State, one of those universities that's involved with the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Science Program, just Google that, and you'll see that they last updated it November 12th, and it says in the very first paragraph up top that their primary goal is the, quote, aerosol radiative forcing of the climate, and so, and that's a quote, and so Penn State is among the universities involved in contracting with the Department of Energy,
[02:39:37.342 --> 02:39:44.930]  So Chris, what are you saying?
[02:39:44.930 --> 02:39:49.134]  You think that this Penn State investigation is going to be a show trial?
[02:39:49.134 --> 02:39:53.379]  That in fact, this investigation is going to be a whitewash and it's actually going to prove the opposite?
[02:39:53.379 --> 02:39:57.243]  They're going to try to prove the opposite so they can maintain their funding and the global warming fraud?
[02:39:58.223 --> 02:40:01.345]  Well, not if we keep these quackademics on the run.
[02:40:01.345 --> 02:40:07.369]  I mean, it's great news that they're on their toes now, and these witch hunters of humanity are in retreat.
[02:40:07.369 --> 02:40:15.515]  But, you know, with this climate gate and the troop escalations and more war and murder, they're the ones who are threatening to make this world even more of a hell.
[02:40:15.515 --> 02:40:18.517]  And, you know, it's like another, as they admit, another religion.
[02:40:19.097 --> 02:40:31.806]  They're seeking to recruit those who are going to feel guilty for not obeying a penalty of burning, and their planet's going to be turned into hell, and that's what they'll do if they don't get their way.
[02:40:31.806 --> 02:40:44.214]  So, you know, we've got them on the run right now, and that's the way we've got to keep them, and exposing these facts, you know, bringing the false left and false right to walk through these gates off the reservation, and maybe we'll accomplish something.
[02:40:44.756 --> 02:40:45.557]  Absolutely, Chris.
[02:40:45.557 --> 02:40:47.759]  We do have to keep them true to their word.
[02:40:47.759 --> 02:40:52.563]  We have to demand not only an investigation, but a prosecution and then punishment as well.
[02:40:52.563 --> 02:40:53.584]  I appreciate the phone call.
[02:40:53.584 --> 02:40:55.505]  Let's go to Chris in Idaho.
[02:40:55.505 --> 02:40:57.027]  Chris, you're on the line.
[02:40:57.027 --> 02:40:57.607]  Hi, Jason.
[02:40:57.607 --> 02:40:58.828]  I just want to say thanks.
[02:40:58.828 --> 02:41:06.095]  I appreciate everything you and Alex are doing for the Freedom Front and we will win this fight.
[02:41:06.095 --> 02:41:08.317]  I just wanted back to what your guest was talking about.
[02:41:09.355 --> 02:41:11.336]  You know, you guys call it the occult and everything.
[02:41:11.336 --> 02:41:14.036]  I mean, why don't you just say what these people are?
[02:41:14.036 --> 02:41:16.297]  They're Luciferian worshippers, you know?
[02:41:16.297 --> 02:41:18.098]  But that doesn't fit into his paradigm.
[02:41:18.098 --> 02:41:32.142]  You know, he'll never mention that a lot of these quote-unquote paganists and these occultists, even though occult obviously means hidden knowledge, would have anything to do with Lucifer unless Lucifer is being portrayed as the light and knowledge.
[02:41:32.142 --> 02:41:38.164]  And then maybe he would talk about it, but not as an entity that is encouraging people to do as thou wilt.
[02:41:39.653 --> 02:41:44.955]  Well, uh, you know, I like what he said where, you know, people obviously don't like to talk about things that they don't know about.
[02:41:44.955 --> 02:41:46.956]  So, you know, that's pretty open-minded.
[02:41:46.956 --> 02:41:56.779]  But anyway, you know, there's, uh, I've done research on this, started with the NWO and the Illuminati and, you know, one world government, and it led me to the occult side.
[02:41:57.668 --> 02:42:03.673]  And all that, and the Freemasons, and it's just confusing to anyone who tries to pick apart the pieces.
[02:42:03.673 --> 02:42:08.978]  And you know, I encourage people to go check out the book called, which one is it?
[02:42:08.978 --> 02:42:09.659]  We carry it here.
[02:42:09.659 --> 02:42:15.664]  It's by John Robison, and it really tells an insider's view of the Illuminati.
[02:42:15.664 --> 02:42:23.011]  He's an unapologetic Mason, but he sees this group infiltrating the Masonic lodges in Europe, and really
[02:42:23.291 --> 02:42:26.813]  Blows the lid off of Weisshaupt and his sect of the Illuminati.
[02:42:26.813 --> 02:42:29.635]  We carry it over here at Infowars.com.
[02:42:29.635 --> 02:42:30.176]  Go check it out.
[02:42:30.176 --> 02:42:31.517]  It's by John Robison.
[02:42:31.517 --> 02:42:32.557]  I thank you for the call.
[02:42:32.557 --> 02:42:34.299]  I want to shift gears for a moment here.
[02:42:34.299 --> 02:42:35.499]  We'll go back to your calls in a moment.
[02:42:35.499 --> 02:42:41.704]  We have Catherine Austin Fitz coming up in the final hour to discuss the economy, but I want to show these clips.
[02:42:42.848 --> 02:43:01.946]  Off of the CBC's Fifth Estate, regarding really what was the fairest mainstream piece, the fairest mainstream piece for 9-11 truth yet, and then show you some documents further debunking people like Jimmy Meggs, Entertainment Weekly superstar turned Popular Mechanics editor.
[02:43:03.004 --> 02:43:07.325]  Being proven wrong again and again and again and again.
[02:43:07.325 --> 02:43:10.546]  So if we could start off with that clip where we have the two clips.
[02:43:10.546 --> 02:43:13.507]  It starts at the one minute marker and then the eight minute marker.
[02:43:13.507 --> 02:43:19.069]  We've got John Farmer admitting, admitting that the 9-11 Commission was a whitewash.
[02:43:19.069 --> 02:43:25.351]  We've got Jimmy Meggs being called out on the fact that Air Defense does train for hijackings and much more.
[02:43:25.351 --> 02:43:26.091]  So let's hit the clip.
[02:43:29.395 --> 02:43:33.404]  Senior Counsel John Farmer established the timeline that day.
[02:43:33.404 --> 02:43:38.053]  He says by misleading the public to hide incompetence on September 11th, the U.S.
[02:43:38.053 --> 02:43:40.518]  government unwittingly triggered the truth movement.
[02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:59.099]  I tell you where I have a degree of empathy, and that is, I think when you have a situation as we had here, where the official government version of what happened doesn't square with reality and leaves people scratching their heads, then people's minds run crazy.
[02:43:59.099 --> 02:44:00.240]  Alright, let's stop it right there.
[02:44:01.340 --> 02:44:04.902]  Varying degrees and then he starts saying how controlled demolition is not a possibility.
[02:44:04.902 --> 02:44:07.483]  Now let's focus on what he did just say.
[02:44:07.483 --> 02:44:15.606]  He just said that the official government version of 9-11 does not square with reality.
[02:44:15.606 --> 02:44:17.407]  Is it time for a new investigation yet?
[02:44:18.067 --> 02:44:27.575]  Is it time for the mainstream media to stop slandering 9-11 truth yet, when John Farmer, the man who put together the timeline, admits it's a lie.
[02:44:27.575 --> 02:44:28.756]  It's a whitewash.
[02:44:28.756 --> 02:44:37.204]  We played segments of Fabled Enemies, my latest film on 9-11, on the Sunday show, where Max Cleland was forced to resign!
[02:44:37.204 --> 02:44:41.508]  He had to resign because they wouldn't even let him see the documents.
[02:44:41.508 --> 02:44:42.749]  This was a commissioner!
[02:44:43.985 --> 02:44:45.726]  On the 9-11 report, he had to leave.
[02:44:45.726 --> 02:44:47.847]  John Farmer admits it's a lie.
[02:44:47.847 --> 02:45:00.054]  The two co-chairs, as they laugh, also in Fabled Enemies, Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton, write a book together called Without Precedent, where they talk about indictments of the FBI and others, and they're joking about it!
[02:45:00.054 --> 02:45:00.775]  It's hilarious!
[02:45:00.775 --> 02:45:01.916]  Oh yeah, of course they lied to us!
[02:45:02.896 --> 02:45:06.417]  Alright, let's go to this next clip in that one right there.
[02:45:06.417 --> 02:45:07.658]  Can we hit that next clip?
[02:45:07.658 --> 02:45:08.678]  This is the CBC.
[02:45:08.678 --> 02:45:15.261]  Bob McEwen, who does a lot of journalism here in the United States, did a really fair piece called The Unofficial Story.
[02:45:15.261 --> 02:45:16.921]  So check this out.
[02:45:16.921 --> 02:45:18.662]  Cell phone or seat back phone.
[02:45:18.662 --> 02:45:20.843]  He went back and forth.
[02:45:20.843 --> 02:45:22.523]  You guys are a minute off.
[02:45:22.523 --> 02:45:23.283]  It's a minute before that.
[02:45:23.283 --> 02:45:23.604]  It's 8 minutes.
[02:45:25.512 --> 02:45:25.872]  Eight minutes.
[02:45:25.872 --> 02:45:27.674]  Sorry about that, folks.
[02:45:27.674 --> 02:45:30.737]  That right there, he's describing the Barbara Olson phone calls.
[02:45:30.737 --> 02:45:32.859]  Now, what do we know about the Barbara Olson phone calls?
[02:45:32.859 --> 02:45:36.903]  Barbara Olson was a commentator on CNN.
[02:45:36.903 --> 02:45:46.613]  She supposedly called her husband, who was the Solicitor General at the time, twice from her cell phone, where she was the one that talked about hijackers with box cutters.
[02:45:46.613 --> 02:45:48.755]  That's where the only information comes out.
[02:45:48.755 --> 02:45:49.476]  So let's hit the clip.
[02:45:51.537 --> 02:45:53.240]  Uh, oh, okay.
[02:45:53.240 --> 02:45:55.204]  Now, does he used to say that to his mother?
[02:45:55.204 --> 02:45:56.226]  Probably not.
[02:45:56.226 --> 02:46:00.414]  According to Doodney, it was a slip-up and clear proof the call wasn't from her son.
[02:46:01.604 --> 02:46:02.745]  Have you been in touch with his mother?
[02:46:02.745 --> 02:46:03.965]  No.
[02:46:03.965 --> 02:46:05.747]  Her name's Alice Hoagland.
[02:46:05.747 --> 02:46:10.509]  And she says, in fact, that was one of the things that they would do on the phone.
[02:46:10.509 --> 02:46:11.370]  Just kidding.
[02:46:11.370 --> 02:46:13.671]  Because he was the up-and-coming young businessman.
[02:46:13.671 --> 02:46:18.634]  And when he called her, she says, that's the way he sometimes introduced himself.
[02:46:18.634 --> 02:46:20.896]  Well, that just means that they've done a better job.
[02:46:21.696 --> 02:46:24.539]  But here, too, there are unanswered questions.
[02:46:24.539 --> 02:46:27.682]  For instance, what's perhaps the most famous call that day?
[02:46:27.682 --> 02:46:38.734]  From television commentator Barbara Olson on board American Flight 77, headed to the Pentagon, to her husband Ted Olson, then Solicitor General of the U.S.
[02:46:38.734 --> 02:46:43.239]  He told CNN that she had called him that morning from Flight 77.
[02:46:45.424 --> 02:46:46.664]  Call him twice.
[02:46:46.664 --> 02:46:49.425]  Talk to him about a minute each time.
[02:46:49.425 --> 02:46:52.546]  He was uncertain whether it was cell phone or seat back phone.
[02:46:52.546 --> 02:46:54.706]  He went back and forth.
[02:46:54.706 --> 02:47:03.909]  But he said she reported that there were hijackers on the planes and they were armed with knives and box cutters.
[02:47:03.909 --> 02:47:04.609]  The only
[02:47:05.785 --> 02:47:08.667]  He looks at it and he says, well that's true.
[02:47:08.667 --> 02:47:09.187]  That's true!
[02:47:09.187 --> 02:47:11.089]  She never did make those calls.
[02:47:11.089 --> 02:47:12.890]  In fact, play it right from there.
[02:47:12.890 --> 02:47:13.970]  Show them right now.
[02:47:13.970 --> 02:47:17.553]  Again, the FBI confirms those calls were never made.
[02:47:17.553 --> 02:47:17.773]  Hit it.
[02:47:34.770 --> 02:47:36.091]  Can we hit that spot?
[02:47:36.091 --> 02:47:39.873]  Ted Olsen told the FBI his wife phoned twice that morning.
[02:47:39.873 --> 02:47:43.015]  Calls lasting about a minute apiece.
[02:47:43.015 --> 02:47:52.841]  But in a 9-11 court case, FBI evidence was that Barbara Olsen attempted just one phone call from Flight 77, which lasted zero seconds.
[02:47:52.841 --> 02:47:54.202]  You've only got two choices.
[02:47:54.202 --> 02:48:01.546]  Either Ted Olsen was duped by fake calls, or he just made it up.
[02:48:01.546 --> 02:48:02.007]  He lied.
[02:48:02.007 --> 02:48:02.467]  Either way,
[02:48:03.712 --> 02:48:06.114]  The official story is based on a lie.
[02:48:06.114 --> 02:48:20.249]  And thus far, we have been unable to get a single newspaper or magazine or TV station in the United States to report this, which the FBI reported in 2006.
[02:48:22.213 --> 02:48:23.855]  All right, let's pull that clip.
[02:48:23.855 --> 02:48:28.080]  Now, the next point we're going to be making, we're going to show you Jim Meggs of Popular Mechanics.
[02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:35.087]  All the quote-unquote debunkers or those who refuse to look at 9-11 truth always cite Popular Mechanics debunked that years ago.
[02:48:35.087 --> 02:48:38.591]  It doesn't matter if I went on national radio and television.
[02:48:39.312 --> 02:48:43.836]  And debated the Popular Mechanics guys on the fifth anniversary of 9-11.
[02:48:43.836 --> 02:48:45.437]  Owned them for an hour.
[02:48:45.437 --> 02:48:47.559]  Disproved their lies.
[02:48:47.559 --> 02:48:49.821]  They're sticking to their stories.
[02:48:49.821 --> 02:48:52.043]  They're going to continue with their propaganda.
[02:48:52.043 --> 02:48:55.505]  In fact, I was supposed to be on later that day against them on Glenn Beck.
[02:48:55.505 --> 02:48:57.127]  We'd been booked for over two weeks.
[02:48:57.127 --> 02:49:03.232]  Of course, we got cancelled and Glenn Beck let Jim Meggs propagate his lies.
[02:49:03.232 --> 02:49:08.136]  So let's go to this portion of the clip from the CBC with Popular Mechanics and Jim Meggs.
[02:49:09.482 --> 02:49:11.965]  But nothing more daunting than 9-11.
[02:49:11.965 --> 02:49:15.708]  And questions like, where was the Air Force?
[02:49:15.708 --> 02:49:29.863]  It is hard for mere laymen to understand how the biggest, most extensive military in the world could not have got fighters in the air that morning faster than it did.
[02:49:30.711 --> 02:49:31.731]  You know, it's really interesting.
[02:49:31.731 --> 02:49:37.973]  The conspiracy theorists, one of the very common mistakes they make is what I call the myth of hyper-competence.
[02:49:37.973 --> 02:49:40.253]  They've seen too many movies.
[02:49:40.253 --> 02:49:46.795]  They have this idea that the minute a plane goes off course, three fighter jets are scrambled on its tail within seconds.
[02:49:46.795 --> 02:49:47.895]  It doesn't actually work that way.
[02:49:47.895 --> 02:49:50.236]  They're assuming that the air defenses were competent.
[02:49:51.095 --> 02:49:52.236]  To fight this kind of threat?
[02:49:52.236 --> 02:49:53.076]  They weren't.
[02:49:53.076 --> 02:49:54.677]  They should have been better prepared for it.
[02:49:54.677 --> 02:49:56.037]  They should have thought about it.
[02:49:56.037 --> 02:49:57.178]  They should have trained for it.
[02:49:57.178 --> 02:49:58.959]  But they do train for it.
[02:49:58.959 --> 02:50:00.980]  That's all they train for.
[02:50:00.980 --> 02:50:05.002]  Not for planes originating inside the U.S.
[02:50:05.002 --> 02:50:07.503]  The air defense system was set up for outside threats.
[02:50:07.503 --> 02:50:11.025]  Planes or missiles or other things coming in from overseas.
[02:50:11.525 --> 02:50:13.528]  Alright, let's just stop him right there.
[02:50:13.528 --> 02:50:16.211]  Bob McEwen should have stopped him and said, that is a lie.
[02:50:16.211 --> 02:50:24.882]  In my hands, and hopefully you can zoom in on the document cam in the final moments of this segment, you can see clearly that on 10-21-2000 they had an inside hijacking.
[02:50:24.882 --> 02:50:25.443]  It's right there.
[02:50:28.667 --> 02:50:32.369]  Amalgam Virgo had an inside hijacking right there.
[02:50:32.369 --> 02:50:33.770]  These aren't outside threats.
[02:50:33.770 --> 02:50:35.931]  These originated in our country.
[02:50:35.931 --> 02:50:38.893]  Yet another lie from Popular Mechanics!
[02:50:38.893 --> 02:50:42.635]  Doesn't matter that they have the drill Amalgam Virgo with Bin Laden on the cover.
[02:50:42.635 --> 02:50:48.419]  And they're running a suicide mission to ram that plane into the Capitol building.
[02:50:48.419 --> 02:50:49.499]  We'll be back after this.
[02:50:49.499 --> 02:50:50.600]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:51.481]  Alex out on assignment.
[02:50:51.481 --> 02:50:52.521]  I'm Jason Burmess.
[02:50:52.521 --> 02:50:55.323]  PrisonPlanet.com InfoWars.net
[02:51:01.553 --> 02:51:05.655]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:51:05.655 --> 02:51:08.537]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:51:08.537 --> 02:51:10.618]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:51:10.618 --> 02:51:12.859]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:51:12.859 --> 02:51:14.520]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:18.822]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:52:02.728 --> 02:52:06.755]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.755 --> 02:52:10.001]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:10.001 --> 02:52:11.424]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:12.122 --> 02:52:14.803]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.803 --> 02:52:21.184]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.184 --> 02:52:26.726]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.726 --> 02:52:29.646]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:52:29.646 --> 02:52:36.368]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.488 --> 02:52:38.830]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.830 --> 02:52:40.411]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.411 --> 02:52:42.874]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.874 --> 02:52:45.015]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:45.015 --> 02:52:50.160]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:50.160 --> 02:52:55.164]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:55.164 --> 02:52:59.268]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:01.434 --> 02:53:02.754]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:53:02.754 --> 02:53:08.336]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:53:08.336 --> 02:53:13.357]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:53:13.357 --> 02:53:18.918]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:53:18.918 --> 02:53:23.599]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:53:24.139 --> 02:53:31.264]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:53:31.264 --> 02:53:32.385]  And here's the best part.
[02:53:32.385 --> 02:53:39.070]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:53:39.070 --> 02:53:42.272]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:53:42.272 --> 02:53:44.494]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:53:44.494 --> 02:53:45.415]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:53:49.059 --> 02:53:53.281]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:53:53.281 --> 02:53:58.124]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:53:58.124 --> 02:54:00.505]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:54:07.489 --> 02:54:20.123]  Finishing up on the 9-11 points, I just want to point out once again, as these guys almost five years ago now set out to quote-unquote debunk 9-11 truth, their lies are stale.
[02:54:21.471 --> 02:54:22.992]  And unproven!
[02:54:22.992 --> 02:54:33.622]  We look at this document from Team 8 of the FBI, and you can clearly see that we drilled inside hijackings, hitting inside targets with suicide missions.
[02:54:33.622 --> 02:54:40.408]  Then, on the day before 9-11, and the day before that, they're running hijackings out of New York City.
[02:54:40.408 --> 02:54:41.769]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:41.769 --> 02:54:43.791]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[02:54:43.791 --> 02:54:47.414]  I also want to mention that if you don't think you were track-traced and data-based,
[02:54:47.774 --> 02:54:58.645]  Prior to 9-11, prior to 9-11, how about Wikileaks releasing all sorts of pager and cell phone documents from text messages on
[02:55:01.220 --> 02:55:03.602]  From the morning of 9-11 itself, 3 a.m.
[02:55:03.602 --> 02:55:17.413]  to 3 a.m., 24 hours of texts that, again, predate the supposed police state that was brought in via the Patriot Act, via the Military Commissions Act, via the lies and the pretext of 9-11.
[02:55:17.413 --> 02:55:23.659]  Yet, somehow, all of these private emails, texts, and pager data are available.
[02:55:24.119 --> 02:55:31.861]  How would that be possible without some kind of a tracking, tracing, and database system being set up before 9-11?
[02:55:31.861 --> 02:55:39.383]  And now Congress may actually probe over this WikiLeaks release because they know that it may hurt them.
[02:55:39.383 --> 02:55:40.624]  Alright, let's take a couple other callers.
[02:55:40.624 --> 02:55:45.145]  Then we have Kathryn Austin Fitz on the program for an entire hour to discuss
[02:55:46.434 --> 02:55:47.774]  The global economic meltdown.
[02:55:47.774 --> 02:55:51.655]  I mean, it is here, full force, gold hitting record prices today.
[02:55:51.655 --> 02:55:55.296]  Go to MidasResources.com right now before it's too late.
[02:55:55.296 --> 02:55:58.416]  It's over $1,200 an ounce, folks.
[02:55:58.416 --> 02:56:00.697]  Only 12 months ago, it sat around $800.
[02:56:00.697 --> 02:56:05.118]  I urged my stepfather and my mother to get into gold.
[02:56:05.118 --> 02:56:09.258]  I said, this is the one investment that you can count on.
[02:56:09.258 --> 02:56:11.159]  All right, let's go to Steven in Texas.
[02:56:11.159 --> 02:56:11.759]  Steven, you're online.
[02:56:12.731 --> 02:56:14.232]  Yeah, hey, good afternoon, Jason.
[02:56:14.232 --> 02:56:18.113]  Hey, uh, aren't you basking in the global warming today?
[02:56:18.113 --> 02:56:19.654]  Yeah, it's so warm here in Texas.
[02:56:19.654 --> 02:56:20.554]  It's actually cooling off.
[02:56:20.554 --> 02:56:27.938]  It's around 45, 50 degrees, so it's not, it's still quite a step up from New York, but let's face it, Stephen, the documents show it.
[02:56:27.938 --> 02:56:28.618]  They lied.
[02:56:28.618 --> 02:56:31.039]  We have the lead scientists stepping down.
[02:56:31.039 --> 02:56:37.922]  We have investigations going on at Penn State and a possible congressional investigation being proposed by James Inhofe.
[02:56:38.582 --> 02:56:46.688]  Asking Barbara Boxer, who is a total globalist and an unapologetic, you know, climate change promoter.
[02:56:46.688 --> 02:56:48.009]  We're the evil ones.
[02:56:48.009 --> 02:56:48.849]  Let's see if she does it.
[02:56:48.849 --> 02:56:50.670]  Let's see if she steps up to the plate.
[02:56:50.670 --> 02:56:57.375]  What we need to do is focus on going after our state officials, our federal representatives, and saying we're not going to stand for it.
[02:56:57.375 --> 02:56:58.796]  The lie has been exposed.
[02:57:00.017 --> 02:57:06.385]  Yeah, I just wanted to follow up on what I called you about here on your show the other day, the Sunday evening.
[02:57:06.385 --> 02:57:15.136]  I did have it confirmed, yeah, I was terminated by that one insurance company because of the email I sent to this customer about Obama.
[02:57:16.182 --> 02:57:23.746]  You know, I don't know what that has to do with business, since I never said anything about business, but you know, that's the way it is.
[02:57:23.746 --> 02:57:30.029]  The other thing is, remember I brought up about how the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S.
[02:57:30.029 --> 02:57:34.671]  Treasury are overseeing the anti-money laundering laws?
[02:57:34.671 --> 02:57:39.073]  Well, the thing is, this is tied into drug running.
[02:57:39.073 --> 02:57:40.133]  Now think about this.
[02:57:40.133 --> 02:57:43.275]  Who's the number one importer of drugs into the United States?
[02:57:44.389 --> 02:58:00.096]  Unfortunately, it's our own shadow government apparatus as exposed in the Iran-Contra scandal, and as proven today, as we give Warlord and Karzai's brother millions of dollars over the last eight years to support the opium trade.
[02:58:00.096 --> 02:58:06.959]  And yet, here, the same shadow government is saying, we're going to go after the people that are running the drugs.
[02:58:06.959 --> 02:58:07.479]  Yeah, right.
[02:58:08.106 --> 02:58:11.368]  It's absolutely laughable, Steve, and I thank you for the call.
[02:58:11.368 --> 02:58:13.770]  Again, we have Catherine Austin Fitz coming on.
[02:58:13.770 --> 02:58:15.251]  I know a lot of you are excited out there.
[02:58:15.251 --> 02:58:20.495]  We've got a lot of emails, a lot of phone calls asking her to come on to this program.
[02:58:20.495 --> 02:58:24.978]  So we're going to break down the entire global economic market with her.
[02:58:24.978 --> 02:58:29.942]  Over the next hour, we're going to talk Dubai, we're going to talk the dollar, we're going to talk gold.
[02:58:29.942 --> 02:58:32.184]  And again, it's record numbers today.
[02:58:32.184 --> 02:58:35.666]  It's the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:41.571 --> 02:58:47.195]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:47.195 --> 02:58:50.918]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:50.918 --> 02:58:54.300]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:58:54.300 --> 02:58:57.923]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:58:57.923 --> 02:59:02.486]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:59:02.486 --> 02:59:03.907]  These emergency backup systems
[02:59:04.147 --> 02:59:07.029]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:59:07.029 --> 02:59:13.154]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:59:13.154 --> 02:59:16.776]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:16.776 --> 02:59:21.580]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:59:21.580 --> 02:59:28.144]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:28.144 --> 02:59:30.086]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:59:30.566 --> 02:59:33.788]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:59:33.788 --> 02:59:38.270]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:59:38.270 --> 02:59:40.071]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:59:40.071 --> 02:59:40.451]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.451 --> 02:59:40.511]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.511 --> 02:59:41.052]  Don't wait.
[02:59:41.052 --> 02:59:41.672]  Call today.
[02:59:41.672 --> 02:59:42.713]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.713 --> 02:59:43.993]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:12.139 --> 03:00:12.919]  We are back.
[03:00:12.919 --> 03:00:14.139]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:14.139 --> 03:00:15.900]  Alex out on assignment in Dallas.
[03:00:15.900 --> 03:00:18.881]  I'm Jason Burmess sitting in.
[03:00:18.881 --> 03:00:22.361]  And we are now joined by Kathryn Austin-Fitz.
[03:00:22.361 --> 03:00:25.202]  Oh no, we don't have her on yet?
[03:00:25.202 --> 03:00:28.303]  She'll be on in just a moment.
[03:00:28.303 --> 03:00:32.964]  She is the founder and managing member of Solari Investment Advisories LLC.
[03:00:34.815 --> 03:00:41.720]  She is a former assistant secretary of housing for the Federal Housing Commissioner under the first Bush administration.
[03:00:41.720 --> 03:00:49.325]  She was the president of the Hamilton Securities Group Investment Bank and financial software developer and a Wall Street insider.
[03:00:49.325 --> 03:00:58.711]  So we are going to get her take on the devaluing dollar, on gold hitting a record high, on what's really going on in Dubai.
[03:01:00.700 --> 03:01:04.543]  And how this is going to affect us, not only in the United States, but globally.
[03:01:04.543 --> 03:01:05.704]  How are you, Katherine?
[03:01:05.704 --> 03:01:08.106]  Hi, I'm fine!
[03:01:08.106 --> 03:01:10.127]  So let's just get right into it.
[03:01:10.127 --> 03:01:12.909]  We're seeing record numbers for gold today.
[03:01:12.909 --> 03:01:17.893]  The dollar continues to decline and we're talking bailouts in Dubai.
[03:01:17.893 --> 03:01:21.575]  What does this all mean for us here at home?
[03:01:21.575 --> 03:01:28.220]  Well, what it means is our expenses are going to rise and our income is going to fall.
[03:01:28.220 --> 03:01:28.961]  It's that simple.
[03:01:30.234 --> 03:01:36.679]  And we're going through a structural change economically as a society.
[03:01:36.679 --> 03:01:55.056]  We have, for the last 15 to 20 years, moved abroad many of the high-paying manufacturing and other jobs and done it in a way that significantly weakened the unions and anything that would protect the value of labor.
[03:01:55.056 --> 03:01:56.077]  So we're watching
[03:01:56.869 --> 03:02:02.271]  It's a fundamental shift between the value of labor and the value of capital worldwide.
[03:02:02.271 --> 03:02:07.672]  And it's an integral part of the way that globalization is being achieved.
[03:02:07.672 --> 03:02:22.877]  And so we're just at a round with Dubai as sort of the latest sort of crisis du jour related to what happens when you print lots and lots of financial paper.
[03:02:23.635 --> 03:02:27.457]  Whether it's currency or bonds or debt securities.
[03:02:27.457 --> 03:02:33.921]  But you don't build up an equivalent amount of real wealth in the real economy.
[03:02:33.921 --> 03:02:43.627]  So we're watching a back and forth between all the paper that we've printed and the bubbles that we've engineered globally and the real economy.
[03:02:43.627 --> 03:02:48.970]  And the precious metals is really just the real economy saying, hey, wait a minute.
[03:02:48.970 --> 03:02:50.231]  We don't want your paper.
[03:02:50.231 --> 03:02:52.192]  We're worth a lot more in terms of your paper.
[03:02:53.885 --> 03:03:03.867]  Well, you just discussed briefly how this country has essentially been gutted from making anything.
[03:03:03.867 --> 03:03:08.548]  We don't really have an industry that creates and exports anything.
[03:03:08.548 --> 03:03:14.929]  In fact, I think our leading export at this point is garbage ideas and promises that really aren't there.
[03:03:14.929 --> 03:03:16.030]  I mean, how did this happen?
[03:03:16.030 --> 03:03:22.231]  How did we allow ourselves to stop manufacturing any physical materials whatsoever?
[03:03:23.413 --> 03:03:36.617]  Well, in the 1990s, we implemented the GATT Uruguay Round and created in 1995 the WTO, the World Trade Organization, which radically changed the rules.
[03:03:36.617 --> 03:03:44.040]  You know, it's like any game, when you blow a whistle and change all the rules, the whole game changes.
[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:52.743]  And what the World Trade Organization and the GATT Round said is, we are now free to move capital in and out of any place.
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:04:05.209]  And basically shift jobs locally, globally, in a way where we can, you know, play labor off against each other around the world.
[03:04:05.209 --> 03:04:16.137]  And that's happening at the same time when you're instituting lots of new powerful technology, because a lot of this is made possible by telecommunications and satellite technology and digital technology.
[03:04:16.137 --> 03:04:23.483]  You're instituting it where it's possible to radically reduce the number of people you need
[03:04:24.372 --> 03:04:36.495]  To do manufacturing, so literally we're seeing new plants come up around the world where everything is done by robotics and computers and you need very few people, where once you needed 2,000 people to do everything you need to.
[03:04:36.495 --> 03:04:52.780]  So part of this is simply who gets the blessings of new technology and what we're saying is we're going to take all those blessings and productivity and centralize it into the wealth of the few and pull it out of the well-being of the many.
[03:04:53.467 --> 03:04:54.413]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:54.413 --> 03:04:56.948]  We'll be back after this with Katherine Austin-Fitz.
[03:05:01.636 --> 03:05:04.638]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.638 --> 03:05:09.960]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.960 --> 03:05:12.021]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.021 --> 03:05:17.024]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.024 --> 03:05:18.205]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.205 --> 03:05:19.325]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.325 --> 03:05:21.206]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.206 --> 03:05:22.287]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.287 --> 03:05:24.488]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.488 --> 03:05:25.829]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.829 --> 03:05:27.349]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.349 --> 03:05:28.410]  If there's a quarantine,
[03:05:28.550 --> 03:05:29.892]  And you can't feed yourself?
[03:05:29.892 --> 03:05:32.614]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.614 --> 03:05:36.198]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.198 --> 03:05:40.022]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.022 --> 03:05:41.244]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.244 --> 03:05:42.145]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.145 --> 03:05:43.246]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.246 --> 03:05:44.007]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.007 --> 03:05:44.988]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.268 --> 03:05:48.312]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:05:50.094 --> 03:05:51.015]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.566 --> 03:06:05.873]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:05.873 --> 03:06:10.419]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.419 --> 03:06:12.682]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:12.682 --> 03:06:14.304]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.304 --> 03:06:15.346]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.566 --> 03:06:23.991]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:08:09.409 --> 03:08:11.170]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:11.170 --> 03:08:12.752]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.752 --> 03:08:13.692]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:13.692 --> 03:08:18.516]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.516 --> 03:08:23.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:23.880 --> 03:08:25.821]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[03:08:25.821 --> 03:08:29.924]  I am Jason Burness, sitting in for Alex Jones, who's on assignment in Dallas.
[03:08:29.924 --> 03:08:32.086]  We're with Katherine Austin Fitz.
[03:08:32.086 --> 03:08:38.211]  And you were talking about, really, the restructuring of the global economy and the economy here at home.
[03:08:38.931 --> 03:08:47.595]  How do you feel the SDR, or Special Drawing Rights Unit, that the IMF is now really issuing fervently, fits into all that?
[03:08:47.595 --> 03:08:51.417]  Is this the global currency that they plan to replace the dollar with?
[03:08:51.417 --> 03:09:00.921]  Because there's all this talk that the dollar can no longer be the world reserve currency, and it would seem that although this hasn't taken a physical form yet, that may be the next step.
[03:09:00.921 --> 03:09:02.962]  Well, there are a couple things happening at once, Jason.
[03:09:02.962 --> 03:09:07.704]  The first is, there is tremendous tension between the financial
[03:09:09.199 --> 03:09:11.741]  Really speculative economy in the real economy.
[03:09:11.741 --> 03:09:33.832]  And if you look at the countries and the organizations trying to implement trade around the world, it's very painful to be trying to, you know, move bananas from here to there when the currency or securities you're operating with to manage a real business have become really a tool of financial speculation and economic warfare.
[03:09:33.832 --> 03:09:35.673]  So we see tremendous demand
[03:09:36.434 --> 03:09:51.298]  By countries that are focused on real export and real trade, trying to find a way to transact and manage reserves in a way that's good for their real economy and get away from the financial speculation.
[03:09:52.278 --> 03:09:59.161]  So there's a demand for a global currency that's outside the global speculation system.
[03:09:59.161 --> 03:10:00.182]  That's one.
[03:10:00.182 --> 03:10:07.225]  Number two, there's no doubt there's a desire also to get off the dollar, because the dollar's in a long-term decline.
[03:10:07.225 --> 03:10:13.668]  And what the dollar has become is, in one sense, is a form of global taxation to the balance sheets.
[03:10:13.668 --> 03:10:19.871]  So countries around the world buy dollars, they go down in value, and literally it's a taxation system.
[03:10:20.612 --> 03:10:30.379]  So, there's a real desire for something, one, that's global, that's two, that's outside of the speculation, and three, it's not going down in value.
[03:10:30.379 --> 03:10:36.983]  And that's part of what you're seeing with the FDRs and the movement to a global currency.
[03:10:36.983 --> 03:10:47.630]  But the other thing, what we're seeing is we're just seeing a desire for people to have something that's not going down, which is part of what's pushing the price of gold and silver and the precious metals up a lot in the last couple months.
[03:10:48.478 --> 03:10:54.263]  So what does the United States look like once the dollar is dumped as the world reserve currency?
[03:10:54.263 --> 03:10:59.627]  Is this literally the death of the dollar and we would need some kind of other currency in the United States?
[03:10:59.627 --> 03:11:02.549]  Would this trigger even a deeper depression?
[03:11:02.549 --> 03:11:03.850]  I know that Obama's talking
[03:11:04.110 --> 03:11:06.010]  Well, I don't think we're going through a depression or recession.
[03:11:06.010 --> 03:11:08.191]  I think we're going through, I call it a financial coup d'etat.
[03:11:08.191 --> 03:11:10.051]  So I think what you're watching is a fundamental re-engineering of how
[03:11:34.269 --> 03:11:40.393]  The world is governed, and it's intentional, and it's planned.
[03:11:40.393 --> 03:11:43.456]  Now, it happens in organic ways.
[03:11:43.456 --> 03:11:46.658]  It's not as though it's perfectly scripted.
[03:11:46.658 --> 03:11:57.906]  But we're going through a fundamental change, and the decision to basically reduce the middle class to a much lower income, with much less political power lifestyle,
[03:12:03.058 --> 03:12:03.358]  I think so.
[03:12:18.118 --> 03:12:22.140]  Out of the economy and abroad during the 90s, sort of hidden behind a bubble.
[03:12:22.140 --> 03:12:23.581]  But that's an intentional thing.
[03:12:23.581 --> 03:12:28.783]  And so when we talk about this in terms of depression and recession, we're talking about business cycles.
[03:12:28.783 --> 03:12:33.945]  And that's not really the traditional... We're not watching a traditional business cycle.
[03:12:33.945 --> 03:12:40.828]  We're watching a fundamental re-engineering of and centralization of economic and political control.
[03:12:40.828 --> 03:12:44.010]  And it's very much global and very planned out.
[03:12:44.010 --> 03:12:44.970]  Let me give you an example.
[03:12:47.278 --> 03:13:10.738]  In London in 2002 to give a paper on, it's called The Myth of the Rule of Law, about sort of how the process of privatization was working here in the United States and how things were, you know, basically criminal enterprises being used to centralize all sorts of ownership and control and real estate into a relatively small group of people.
[03:13:11.334 --> 03:13:26.600]  And I gave the paper, and following me there was a former reporter from the Wall Street Journal giving a paper about the economic warfare in Russia during the 90s, and then followed by a wonderful reporter in London who gave one on Eastern Europe.
[03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:33.283]  And we were all in a state of shock because we realized it was the same companies, the same banks, same hedge funds.
[03:13:33.943 --> 03:13:39.405]  Same defense contractors operating as syndicate in all three places.
[03:13:39.405 --> 03:14:00.673]  We just didn't, you know, we hadn't seen the game because we thought it was just North America or Russia or Eastern Europe, and what we didn't see was there was a global process going on of buying up and controlling all sorts of land and real estate and enterprises, and was very much part of a process of economic warfare that was going on globally.
[03:14:01.527 --> 03:14:17.913]  Well, when these elitists talk about redistribution of wealth, what they really mean is that their goal is to take the United States and take us from our first world nation status and delve us into this second world nation status as they consolidate power, as they gain more power.
[03:14:17.913 --> 03:14:24.776]  And I see this system being implemented with this cap-and-trade scam and now being exposed in Climategate.
[03:14:25.316 --> 03:14:29.637]  I mean, that's why they created these carbon markets and carbon prices.
[03:14:29.637 --> 03:14:32.699]  I mean, the EU openly trades European Union.
[03:14:32.699 --> 03:14:41.081]  This is about globalization and I think that this is the next step in this redistribution of how the global economy works, yes?
[03:14:41.081 --> 03:14:51.625]  Well, let's look at the challenge, you know, whether it's what I'll just call a metaphor for the people running the economy globally.
[03:14:51.625 --> 03:14:54.706]  So, whether you're Mr. Global or whether you're
[03:14:55.580 --> 03:15:00.401]  You know, you're Jason and Catherine and the people listening to this call.
[03:15:00.401 --> 03:15:22.445]  The question is, how do we go from being a world where resources are very much used by the few and not by the many, and a world where we're having incredible damage from growth in population to the environment on the planet,
[03:15:23.488 --> 03:15:28.891]  How do we go to a world where we are living in alignment with each other and with the environment?
[03:15:28.891 --> 03:15:34.035]  So, how do we go from an unhealthy model to a much more healthy model?
[03:15:34.035 --> 03:15:36.636]  And here's the challenge.
[03:15:36.636 --> 03:15:46.582]  The question is, how do you incentivize people to do what's good for the environment and do what's much more equitable in terms of sharing of resources?
[03:15:46.582 --> 03:15:49.404]  And there are positive systems you can use to do that.
[03:15:51.263 --> 03:16:02.051]  The Solari model says, okay, why don't we finance communities with equity, and then people can make money and get financial wealth from reducing consumption.
[03:16:02.051 --> 03:16:07.435]  The notion that we need consumption to grow to get the stock market to go up is absurd.
[03:16:07.435 --> 03:16:08.495]  That's the corporate model.
[03:16:08.495 --> 03:16:19.904]  But in fact, if you finance places with equity, there's enormous financial incentives for all of us to dramatically reduce our consumption in a way that aligns us and our finances with
[03:16:20.757 --> 03:16:22.759]  With the environment.
[03:16:22.759 --> 03:16:25.341]  Cap and trade is a very different kind of system.
[03:16:25.341 --> 03:16:27.563]  It's a taxation system.
[03:16:27.563 --> 03:16:31.126]  And it says, you know, you can't trust people to do the right thing.
[03:16:31.126 --> 03:16:41.234]  So rather than incentivize them with positive, what we're going to do is we're just going to make it very painful and expensive for them to not lower their footprint.
[03:16:41.234 --> 03:16:46.519]  But we're going to do it in a way that, one, gives us central control, and two, where we can game the system.
[03:16:46.519 --> 03:16:47.940]  So I've always said, if you think
[03:16:48.629 --> 03:16:54.951]  You know, that cap-and-trade would make derivatives look like it was something that Mother Teresa came up with.
[03:16:54.951 --> 03:17:08.714]  Because what you're seeing in cap-and-trade is the worst polluters on the planet being given a get-out-of-jail-free card in exchange for making it much more expensive for the least polluting people.
[03:17:08.714 --> 03:17:10.175]  So, for example, Democracy Now!
[03:17:10.175 --> 03:17:14.516]  just had a great description about a month ago of General Motors
[03:17:15.751 --> 03:17:30.199]  Purchasing of carbon credits in Brazil and basically, you know, General Motors is free to pollute because the folks in Brazil can no longer hunt or do all sorts of things with land that they've been using for generations.
[03:17:30.199 --> 03:17:42.326]  So you literally have a system that allows the most polluting to continue to pollute and get a get-out-of-jail-free card by making life miserable for the people who have the lowest footprint.
[03:17:42.648 --> 03:17:52.394]  And exactly, even though they're going to buy these carbon credits, those fees, those costs will then be implemented on the lower class by what they cost.
[03:17:52.394 --> 03:17:53.834]  They'll just increase their price.
[03:17:53.834 --> 03:18:01.619]  And in fact, now you're seeing around gas stations that if cap-and-trade is passed, yes, gas will go up 75 cents or a dollar.
[03:18:01.619 --> 03:18:10.084]  And then the left cover is, oh, you must work for the oil industry, that's why you're against cap-and-trade, that's why you're against a carbon tax.
[03:18:10.084 --> 03:18:11.885]  Yet, these headlines I have next to me,
[03:18:12.305 --> 03:18:14.167]  Well, let's talk about what we need.
[03:18:14.167 --> 03:18:23.995]  The first thing that we need, whether it's, you know, if you're the American people or you're in Latin America or any continent around the world, what we all need is transparency about what's going on, what ClimateGate shows,
[03:18:40.706 --> 03:18:47.851]  ...is that the quote-unquote science around the need to have any kind of system is bogus.
[03:18:47.851 --> 03:19:00.840]  And, you know, it's very hard for most people to believe that the concept of global warming could get this far, and we have this kind of sort of bogus science going on.
[03:19:00.840 --> 03:19:07.485]  And so the first thing that's needed, Jason, is transparency about where is climate change coming from
[03:19:08.206 --> 03:19:10.707]  Why and what are the things that we can do?
[03:19:10.707 --> 03:19:17.489]  You know, what does the human race control that we can change that can improve our circumstances for whatever reason?
[03:19:17.489 --> 03:19:23.631]  And I think that, you know, I'm someone who spent a huge amount of time trying to understand what's happening and why.
[03:19:23.631 --> 03:19:32.774]  And I still feel absolutely no confidence that I know why or can explain, you know, why climate change is happening.
[03:19:32.774 --> 03:19:36.635]  Because I think I think there's so much disinformation.
[03:19:37.256 --> 03:19:48.511]  And it's a perfect example of how disinformation is used to bring about bad policy and control when what we need is a real, honest conversation about what's going to happen and what can we do.
[03:19:49.022 --> 03:19:59.732]  Well, the bottom line is, if the data said what they said it showed, they wouldn't have destroyed it, and they would have allowed it to be peer-reviewed unless... Except for, you know, they didn't, and they had it fall into the dark abyss.
[03:19:59.732 --> 03:20:01.714]  It's the Alex Jones Show, back after this.
[03:20:01.714 --> 03:20:03.116]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[03:20:03.116 --> 03:20:06.759]  Alex and I have talked about food security for your family for years.
[03:20:06.759 --> 03:20:08.361]  Now we're into the holiday season.
[03:20:08.761 --> 03:20:15.162]  The happy time of year when friends and family come together and food is always the expression of our shared love and caring.
[03:20:15.162 --> 03:20:16.583]  Here's an exciting announcement.
[03:20:16.583 --> 03:20:23.924]  From now until December 15th, all products that eFoodsDirect provides are listed at 10% off the regular price.
[03:20:23.924 --> 03:20:27.545]  The holiday season is the time for peace, happiness, and security.
[03:20:27.545 --> 03:20:33.126]  What better way to ensure fearless hope for the future of our families than to have as much good food in our homes
[03:20:35.265 --> 03:20:35.505]  I think so.
[03:21:02.105 --> 03:21:03.126]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:21:03.126 --> 03:21:08.651]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:21:08.651 --> 03:21:09.212]  I get it.
[03:21:09.212 --> 03:21:18.821]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:21:18.821 --> 03:21:19.982]  That's not what's happening.
[03:21:20.222 --> 03:21:28.707]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:21:28.707 --> 03:21:32.089]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:21:32.089 --> 03:21:36.372]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:21:36.372 --> 03:21:37.952]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:21:37.952 --> 03:21:41.374]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[03:21:41.374 --> 03:21:45.537]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:21:45.717 --> 03:21:46.638]  You should, too.
[03:21:46.638 --> 03:21:47.779]  Find out what they know.
[03:21:47.779 --> 03:21:51.101]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[03:21:51.101 --> 03:21:51.161]  800-686-2237.
[03:21:51.161 --> 03:21:51.402]  800-686-2237.
[03:21:51.402 --> 03:21:51.642]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:21:51.642 --> 03:21:54.224]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:54.224 --> 03:21:55.905]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:55.905 --> 03:21:57.406]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:22:12.156 --> 03:22:15.197]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:15.197 --> 03:22:21.218]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:21.218 --> 03:22:26.400]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.400 --> 03:22:29.680]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:22:29.680 --> 03:22:36.402]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.522 --> 03:22:38.863]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:38.863 --> 03:22:40.443]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.443 --> 03:22:42.904]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:42.904 --> 03:22:45.025]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:45.025 --> 03:22:50.186]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:50.186 --> 03:22:59.289]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:23:02.000 --> 03:23:09.526]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:23:09.526 --> 03:23:14.030]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:23:14.030 --> 03:23:19.194]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[03:23:19.194 --> 03:23:26.660]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:23:26.660 --> 03:23:31.024]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[03:23:31.324 --> 03:23:37.348]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:23:37.348 --> 03:23:44.292]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[03:23:44.292 --> 03:23:49.795]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[03:23:49.795 --> 03:23:52.957]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com or call 269-409-1776.
[03:23:52.957 --> 03:23:53.257]  269-409-1776 today!
[03:24:13.479 --> 03:24:20.208]  She's called the current economic situation a financial coup d'etat.
[03:24:20.208 --> 03:24:21.369]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:21.369 --> 03:24:23.232]  I'm Jason Burmess, sitting in.
[03:24:25.117 --> 03:24:46.500]  I want to move on to what's going on in Copenhagen in just I think it's six or seven days it begins this Copenhagen treaty where one of the quote-unquote three pillars is global government and the term taxation and tax appears over a dozen times they're trying to get this cap and trade scheme
[03:24:47.611 --> 03:24:48.692]  Global!
[03:24:48.692 --> 03:24:56.919]  I mean all the way around so that we sign on to a treaty and of course the United States is the quote-unquote worst polluter so we're going to be hit the hardest.
[03:24:56.919 --> 03:25:00.963]  What do you see coming out of this climate treaty, this meeting?
[03:25:00.963 --> 03:25:15.255]  I don't know what's going to come out of Copenhagen because I think there's a real effort going on behind the scenes to make sure that the United States doesn't commit or commits as little as possible and we don't know how it's going to play out.
[03:25:16.467 --> 03:25:40.493]  The question behind all of this really goes back to, are we going to have a democracy, or are we going to be part of a system where invisible forces control top-down through these unbelievably complex systems, a lot of which are being engineered by using the environmental issues in the environmental community.
[03:25:40.493 --> 03:25:43.134]  I think in many respects they're unknowing about it.
[03:25:44.787 --> 03:25:48.169]  You know, I don't know what's going to come out, Jason.
[03:25:48.169 --> 03:26:02.780]  I think we just have to wait to see, but it's part of a long-term trend to try and engineer top-down control in a way that literally takes any kind of accountability out of the hands of the people who live in a place.
[03:26:02.780 --> 03:26:11.085]  So if you live in a county in the United States, and the United States breaks down to just about 3,100 counties, who's in control in that county?
[03:26:11.085 --> 03:26:12.847]  Is it the World Trade Organization?
[03:26:13.914 --> 03:26:16.455]  Is it rule set in a place like Copenhagen?
[03:26:16.455 --> 03:26:22.558]  Is it the federal government or is it your local sheriff and town council?
[03:26:22.558 --> 03:26:25.700]  And that's where the rubber's going to meet the road.
[03:26:25.700 --> 03:26:28.981]  If you're a farmer, do you own and control the water on your property?
[03:26:28.981 --> 03:26:34.564]  Or is it somebody in the World Trade Organization to determine what happens with it?
[03:26:36.021 --> 03:26:38.842]  So where do you see all this going in the United States?
[03:26:38.842 --> 03:26:42.263]  What are we going to look like in six months, in a year?
[03:26:42.263 --> 03:26:44.344]  Is the dollar going to continue to decline?
[03:26:44.344 --> 03:26:46.285]  Is gold going to continue to go up?
[03:26:46.285 --> 03:26:57.309]  And then how can people really hedge their bets and protect themselves from this really economic takeover to the tune of an admitted over 27 trillion dollars in bailouts?
[03:26:57.309 --> 03:26:59.870]  Well, the first thing you want to do is, you know,
[03:27:01.849 --> 03:27:04.851]  I'm not a prophet, so there are many different things that can happen.
[03:27:04.851 --> 03:27:07.313]  There are many different scenarios that can play out.
[03:27:07.313 --> 03:27:14.598]  But the one thing we do know is that there are certain long-term trends, and what you want to do is make sure you align yourself with the long-term trends.
[03:27:14.598 --> 03:27:25.326]  So, the first long-term trend is we're having a shift of resources out of financial assets and what I call sort of bubble economics and into real things.
[03:27:26.067 --> 03:27:32.332]  And what that means is we need to, the average person, the average household, needs to demonetize.
[03:27:32.332 --> 03:27:39.997]  So, for example, I once had a friend who was constantly complaining about how the yields in her stock market portfolio were falling and her water bill was going up.
[03:27:39.997 --> 03:27:42.239]  And I said, well, you know, this is really easy.
[03:27:42.239 --> 03:27:46.682]  Why don't you just sell some stock and build a well?
[03:27:46.682 --> 03:27:48.904]  And so that's a perfect example where
[03:27:49.522 --> 03:27:59.184]  We put our money into corporate securities and then we get a yield on our corporate securities and then we go into the market and buy from those same corporations the goods and services that we need.
[03:27:59.184 --> 03:28:16.629]  So we've been intermediated and demonetization is really about saying, okay, where can I start investing my time and my resources so that I permanently lower my overhead because it makes sense to, you know, to go back to the way my grandparents or great-grandparents did it.
[03:28:17.045 --> 03:28:20.867]  The economics are changing because we're in a bull market for tangibles.
[03:28:20.867 --> 03:28:30.911]  So, for example, the more I can reduce my dependency in terms of my energy, my food, you know, on unreliable players.
[03:28:30.911 --> 03:28:33.992]  You want to get unreliable players out of your life.
[03:28:33.992 --> 03:28:40.235]  So, one of the questions I always ask people is, who's your farmer?
[03:28:40.235 --> 03:28:41.176]  Who's your banker?
[03:28:41.176 --> 03:28:41.996]  Where's your money?
[03:28:43.360 --> 03:29:01.252]  With genetically modified food, there's a reason we all want to start getting to know our farmers again and finding ways of, you know, maybe investing in farmland that help make sure you have, you know, a wonderful supply of food.
[03:29:01.252 --> 03:29:04.335]  You know, so demonetization about that.
[03:29:04.335 --> 03:29:10.139]  The second thing is, where are you putting your money and how does that relate?
[03:29:10.854 --> 03:29:13.796]  To making sure you're advantaged.
[03:29:13.796 --> 03:29:17.738]  I always give the example of three women.
[03:29:17.738 --> 03:29:23.080]  I was sitting with a group of three women who were very close friends, and I got them talking about how their money worked.
[03:29:23.080 --> 03:29:31.365]  And what we discovered is that one had her money in a local bank that was sending their money into their correspondent bank in New York.
[03:29:31.365 --> 03:29:36.888]  It was a large New York bank, and they were getting about 4% of the time on their money.
[03:29:36.888 --> 03:29:39.129]  And when we come back, I'll finish the story.
[03:29:39.676 --> 03:29:40.297]  Sounds good.
[03:29:40.297 --> 03:29:42.139]  We're with Kathryn Austin Fitz.
[03:29:42.139 --> 03:29:43.200]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:43.200 --> 03:29:44.442]  I'm Jason Burmess.
[03:29:44.442 --> 03:29:45.003]  Sitting in.
[03:29:45.003 --> 03:29:51.711]  Go check out all of our films, all of our programs over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:29:51.711 --> 03:29:53.093]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.093 --> 03:29:54.715]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.715 --> 03:29:58.299]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.138 --> 03:30:05.700]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:30:05.700 --> 03:30:06.601]  Number one.
[03:30:06.601 --> 03:30:10.022]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:30:10.022 --> 03:30:10.883]  Number two.
[03:30:10.883 --> 03:30:15.785]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:30:15.785 --> 03:30:16.526]  It's true.
[03:30:16.526 --> 03:30:21.068]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:30:21.388 --> 03:30:22.209]  Number 3.
[03:30:22.209 --> 03:30:25.792]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:30:25.792 --> 03:30:29.716]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:30:29.716 --> 03:30:30.517]  Number 4.
[03:30:30.517 --> 03:30:33.279]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:30:33.279 --> 03:30:36.963]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:30:36.963 --> 03:30:37.743]  Number 5.
[03:30:37.743 --> 03:30:41.887]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:30:41.887 --> 03:30:46.652]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:30:46.932 --> 03:30:51.116]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:30:51.116 --> 03:30:52.898]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[03:32:01.986 --> 03:32:06.008]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:32:06.008 --> 03:32:09.249]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:32:09.249 --> 03:32:14.051]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:32:14.051 --> 03:32:20.433]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:32:20.433 --> 03:32:22.694]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:32:23.214 --> 03:32:23.534]  Tim Geithner?
[03:32:23.534 --> 03:32:24.035]  Bernanke?
[03:32:24.035 --> 03:32:24.696]  They're arsonists!
[03:32:24.696 --> 03:32:25.997]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:32:25.997 --> 03:32:28.240]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:32:42.116 --> 03:32:44.258]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:32:44.258 --> 03:32:49.404]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:32:49.404 --> 03:32:58.514]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:33:07.415 --> 03:33:08.956]  We are back live.
[03:33:08.956 --> 03:33:10.116]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:10.116 --> 03:33:11.877]  We have Katherine Austin Fitz with us.
[03:33:11.877 --> 03:33:13.698]  I'm Jason Burmess sitting.
[03:33:13.698 --> 03:33:19.940]  And before we go back to her, I want to remind people that there are holiday specials up over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:33:19.940 --> 03:33:23.302]  You can get an entire year subscription to PrisonPlanet.TV.

[03:33:34.546 --> 03:33:35.567]  That is the deal.
[03:33:35.567 --> 03:33:35.767]  Only $5.
[03:33:36.707 --> 03:33:37.308]  No, you're a banker.
[03:34:01.989 --> 03:34:02.910]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:34:02.910 --> 03:34:05.772]  So these three women were sitting around, all good friends.
[03:34:05.772 --> 03:34:09.975]  One had her money in a local bank that was shipping its money to the correspondent.
[03:34:09.975 --> 03:34:11.036]  Large New York bank.
[03:34:11.036 --> 03:34:13.758]  She was getting about 4% on her money at the time.
[03:34:13.758 --> 03:34:15.379]  Yields were much higher.
[03:34:15.379 --> 03:34:26.367]  The second woman had her 401k IRA, both 401k and IRA, and she had her money in the stock of the same New York bank.
[03:34:26.367 --> 03:34:31.071]  And their third friend, and remember I'm getting them talking about their money, it turns out their third friend
[03:34:31.880 --> 03:34:33.622]  ...was borrowing on her credit card.
[03:34:33.622 --> 03:34:36.724]  She started a business using her credit card right after that.
[03:34:36.724 --> 03:34:40.027]  It was a credit card of the same New York bank.
[03:34:40.027 --> 03:34:42.189]  The bank jacked the rate up to 23%.
[03:34:42.189 --> 03:34:50.456]  The first two women are making about 5% and providing their capital, their life savings, to this bank.
[03:34:50.456 --> 03:34:53.518]  And one of their best friends is borrowing it back at 23%.
[03:34:53.518 --> 03:34:55.640]  Now, what's wrong with that picture?
[03:34:55.640 --> 03:35:00.224]  Why do we need a bank thousands of miles away, or over a thousand miles away,
[03:35:00.751 --> 03:35:05.634]  To get in between three friends in a way that's raking off huge and hideous profits.
[03:35:05.634 --> 03:35:07.655]  Well, that's an opportunity.
[03:35:07.655 --> 03:35:16.339]  And, in fact, there was one website that got started, Prosper.com, which was allowing or set up to help people loan directly to each other.
[03:35:16.339 --> 03:35:20.422]  And, of course, you know the boys shut it down.
[03:35:20.422 --> 03:35:29.967]  So, another question is, where is the opportunity to not be intermediated by the big institutions and find ways of making more money and keeping
[03:35:30.666 --> 03:35:35.430]  The cash flow in either our networks or our neighborhood.
[03:35:35.430 --> 03:35:37.612]  Let's say we did everything, Jason, we could.
[03:35:37.612 --> 03:35:47.980]  We, you know, we demonetized, we bought our generator, we started loaning to our... You know, let's say we did everything we could do just ourselves and our networks.
[03:35:47.980 --> 03:35:53.444]  Then the question comes down to, okay, now how do we start taking political action?
[03:35:53.444 --> 03:35:57.007]  And in addition to who's your farmer and who's your banker,
[03:35:57.586 --> 03:36:03.749]  A very important question in the 2010 election is going to be, who's your sheriff?
[03:36:03.749 --> 03:36:18.475]  Because, in fact, if you look at the legal construct upon which the Republic was founded, the most powerful person in your county is not the President of the United States, and it's not even your governor, it's the sheriff.
[03:36:18.475 --> 03:36:24.978]  And literally, the federal government cannot do anything outside or against the Constitution if your sheriff says no.
[03:36:26.461 --> 03:36:27.742]  You may not.
[03:36:27.742 --> 03:36:30.844]  They're the ultimate word within that jurisdiction.
[03:36:30.844 --> 03:36:46.932]  And we're going to have Richard Mack, I don't know if you've ever had Richard Mack on InfoWars, but we're going to have Richard Mack, who's a retired sheriff in Arizona, has written a lot about this question, and in fact took the federal government to court, went all the way to the Supreme Court and won.
[03:36:46.932 --> 03:36:55.497]  He's going to be on the Hilaria Report in January, and so I just cringe when I see people spend money and time
[03:36:59.344 --> 03:37:23.102]  I always tell people that they need to start locally and if they truly do want to change the system perhaps it's time for them to run for city council or state senator or even a congressional spot but of course the sheriff is a very very powerful position and an electable one so if you don't like what's going on in your county it's time for you to run for sheriff
[03:37:23.507 --> 03:37:28.090]  Well, but the other thing is, you know, the sheriffs can do an awful lot if people will support them.
[03:37:28.090 --> 03:37:40.298]  And a lot of the politics comes down to the Fed throws a lot of money, the more dependent we get on federal money, and the more the Feds control the cash flow locally, the more everybody won't support their sheriff in standing up.
[03:37:40.298 --> 03:37:43.020]  And that's why it's got to be battled out in the cash flow.
[03:37:43.020 --> 03:37:50.545]  The next place you need to go after who's your sheriff is to look at, okay, let's look at where the governmental money is going.
[03:37:50.545 --> 03:37:51.606]  We're paying taxes.
[03:37:52.188 --> 03:37:54.149]  And that tax money is going someplace.
[03:37:54.149 --> 03:38:01.412]  It's that money circulating into the businesses that create employment and opportunities for us so that we are neighbor-zoned.
[03:38:01.412 --> 03:38:16.998]  And I just want to use an example of what's been happening, because if you look, if you dig in and you look at the federal, state, and local governmental flows, all resources, not just contracts or expenditures within a place, what you discover is there's enormous opportunity
[03:38:17.699 --> 03:38:24.102]  To lower the burden to taxpayers in a way that creates much more income locally for us.
[03:38:24.102 --> 03:38:25.683]  Let me give you a perfect example.
[03:38:25.683 --> 03:38:27.244]  I live in Tennessee.
[03:38:27.244 --> 03:38:30.365]  We have about 20% of the population now on food stamps.
[03:38:30.365 --> 03:38:36.288]  Huge part of the federal flow-through in the Tennessee state budget.
[03:38:36.288 --> 03:38:38.769]  It's over a billion dollars now.
[03:38:38.769 --> 03:38:46.993]  So 20% of the people on food stamps in a state where we have fabulous farmland, beautiful farmland, that's just sitting not doing anything.
[03:38:48.432 --> 03:38:56.736]  It turns out, Jason, that we are outsourcing the data servicing and customer support work on the food stamp contract in Tennessee.
[03:38:56.736 --> 03:38:59.358]  It's true in Florida, other states, too.
[03:38:59.358 --> 03:39:00.358]  Are you ready for this?
[03:39:00.358 --> 03:39:02.660]  JPMorgan Chase in India.
[03:39:02.660 --> 03:39:03.500]  Oh, how lovely!
[03:39:03.500 --> 03:39:10.284]  Now, we have counties in Tennessee where we have 25% unemployment.
[03:39:10.284 --> 03:39:14.967]  So, the federal and state governments are paying people to not work
[03:39:15.845 --> 03:39:23.750]  And paying for their food stamps when they are also paying JPMorgan Chase to do jobs that these people could do.
[03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:29.073]  Well, that's why those arguments never stand up that, oh, they don't want to take these jobs.
[03:39:29.073 --> 03:39:30.814]  No, you're not offering them to people.
[03:39:30.814 --> 03:39:35.377]  You're moving them overseas and making it impossible for them to do this work.
[03:39:35.377 --> 03:39:40.180]  Well, in fact, data servicing jobs are wonderful jobs for many people.
[03:39:40.180 --> 03:39:44.163]  If you are someone who has responsibilities for caring for children,
[03:39:44.801 --> 03:39:47.081]  Or for elderly parents or both.
[03:39:47.081 --> 03:39:56.343]  Data servicing jobs can be beamed in, you know, you can beam them out to lots of different sites locally, and they can be done in flexible hours.
[03:39:56.343 --> 03:40:04.165]  So you can get very high productivity with flexible hours in sites that are closer to home, even residential.
[03:40:04.165 --> 03:40:13.387]  So, in fact, it doesn't make any sense to beam those jobs to India because there is a way to do them here, which is enormously wonderful for a workforce
[03:40:13.820 --> 03:40:31.888]  But literally cannot get in a car and commute an hour into Nashville or Knoxville or, you know, Tampa or Orlando because they have to take care of, and it's certainly much more economic for society to have them care for their family members than to try and institutionalize them.
[03:40:31.888 --> 03:40:39.271]  So if you look at the fundamental economics, you'll see again and again, and I saw this, I was, I served as the Assistant Secretary of Housing,
[03:40:39.818 --> 03:40:51.721]  And I would often see communities where we were spending $250,000 per unit to construct public housing, when $50,000 would buy and rehab a single-family home.
[03:40:51.721 --> 03:40:56.562]  So we were paying five times per unit of what we needed to.
[03:40:56.562 --> 03:41:00.523]  And in fact, in the Clinton administration, I took that example.
[03:41:00.523 --> 03:41:05.984]  In fact, it was New Orleans where this situation, the fact pattern, was just outrageous.
[03:41:07.651 --> 03:41:09.012]  I had first seen it in Chicago.
[03:41:09.012 --> 03:41:17.577]  I took it to the assistant of the person who ran that program at HUD, and I said, look, if we just re-engineered the money, we could get five homes for the price of one.
[03:41:17.577 --> 03:41:22.600]  The person turned bright red and looked at me and said, but how could we generate fees for our friends?
[03:41:22.600 --> 03:41:28.284]  So, when there's a bubble going on, Jason, everybody's happy to generate fees for our friends.
[03:41:28.284 --> 03:41:34.948]  You know, when you turn to people and say, your children can't have health care because there's not enough money,
[03:41:35.532 --> 03:42:00.110]  It's time to look at 50 years of accumulated fees for our friends and say, you know, maybe we need to re-engineer how things work, because we've had decades of computers and new technology, and yet the overhead costs of fundamental government projects have skyrocketed exponentially, and that's because we are subsidizing a huge infrastructure
[03:42:00.700 --> 03:42:08.321]  The biggest piece of which is these big corporations, because you give a big corporation a government contract, and you drive their stock up.
[03:42:08.321 --> 03:42:15.903]  So there's real, you know, capital gains on stock market real estate is the primary source of political contribution.
[03:42:15.903 --> 03:42:30.045]  And it starts, though, in your own county saying, okay, let me get control of my local representatives, whether it's my sheriff or town council or state representative, make sure we have excellent people in office, but then let's look at the money
[03:42:30.757 --> 03:42:47.515]  And let's look at where we're paying five times of what is needed and where we cannot re-engineer the money to get a much better result in terms of expenses down and income up for the people here in a way that reduces the load to taxpayer.
[03:42:47.515 --> 03:42:50.679]  And I tell you, those opportunities are absolutely there.
[03:42:52.090 --> 03:42:59.194]  We're going to open up the phone lines for Catherine Austin Fitz in just a moment, but first I want to get your take on gold being at a record high today.
[03:42:59.194 --> 03:43:00.814]  Where is the roof on this thing?
[03:43:00.814 --> 03:43:06.197]  Are we going to see it go up above $1,300, $1,400, maybe even hit $1,500?
[03:43:06.197 --> 03:43:09.199]  Where do you see gold and precious metals going?
[03:43:09.199 --> 03:43:20.565]  If you go back and you look at the high in 1980 before the current high, and you say, okay, you know, gold traded at $800.
[03:43:22.026 --> 03:43:26.029]  Even above, but, you know, the close was $800.
[03:43:26.029 --> 03:43:29.171]  So, gold traded at $800 in 1980.
[03:43:29.171 --> 03:43:33.534]  If we were going to say, okay, how much was that in inflation in just the dollars?
[03:43:33.534 --> 03:43:39.978]  Because we've had enormous inflation from 1980 until now, so it's over 30 years of inflation.
[03:43:39.978 --> 03:43:42.820]  But in current dollars, what was that?
[03:43:42.820 --> 03:43:43.880]  $800?
[03:43:43.880 --> 03:43:47.323]  Depending on who calculates it and what series they use.
[03:43:47.323 --> 03:43:48.784]  Do they use a government series or
[03:43:49.656 --> 03:43:55.057]  For example, John William's Shadow Stats has redone the government numbers.
[03:43:55.057 --> 03:44:03.119]  So do we use the more reliable numbers like John's for the CPI and the inflation?
[03:44:03.119 --> 03:44:04.400]  What would $800 be in current dollars?
[03:44:04.400 --> 03:44:06.020]  You get estimates of anywhere from $2,500 to $7,500.
[03:44:06.020 --> 03:44:08.901]  And so what we're looking at today with a price of approximately $1,200,
[03:44:17.259 --> 03:44:22.422]  It's something that is less than 50% of where the high was in 1980.
[03:44:22.422 --> 03:44:26.624]  So on an inflation-adjusted basis, Jason, we're nowhere near the high.
[03:44:26.624 --> 03:44:28.165]  That's number one.
[03:44:28.165 --> 03:44:38.951]  Number two, the challenge we have with precious metals is that it's a very tiny market relative to the global stock or bond markets.
[03:44:38.951 --> 03:44:42.333]  I mean, the global bond market is huge, and then you add derivatives.
[03:44:43.263 --> 03:44:52.445]  If a tiny bit of money decides it wants to shift into precious metals, you're talking about enormous pressure to drive the price up.
[03:44:52.445 --> 03:45:09.149]  Now, we've seen over the last 15 years real intervention by the central banks and government treasuries to drive and manage the price down as really a way to protect the bond market and sort of the inflated values of global currencies, particularly the dollar.
[03:45:10.516 --> 03:45:13.778]  More and more investors are beginning to understand that game.
[03:45:13.778 --> 03:45:23.584]  One of the things that has always threatened the market was the overhang of gold that the IMF has said that it was willing to sell.
[03:45:23.584 --> 03:45:28.367]  The IMF is beginning, instead of just threatening sales, they have approved sales.
[03:45:28.367 --> 03:45:34.651]  But that overhang is going very quickly into central banks, which are snapping it up.
[03:45:34.651 --> 03:45:39.294]  And if you say to yourself, look, if central banks and institutional investors
[03:45:39.944 --> 03:45:44.768]  And retail investors are going to start to move into this very, very thin market.
[03:45:44.768 --> 03:45:51.134]  It doesn't take much incremental change in percentage of market share to drive the price through the roof.
[03:45:51.134 --> 03:45:59.542]  So, the long-term fundamentals on precious metals are very, very strong, number one.
[03:45:59.542 --> 03:46:06.288]  And number two, it is very important to remember that this is an extremely political market.
[03:46:06.897 --> 03:46:12.400]  And a very, you know, there's an economic war going on in the middle of this market.
[03:46:12.400 --> 03:46:16.182]  So we're looking at prices that are extremely volatile.
[03:46:16.182 --> 03:46:21.545]  And it's very important to recognize, yes, we have a long-term bull market.
[03:46:21.545 --> 03:46:24.547]  My guess is that there is a great distance to go.
[03:46:24.547 --> 03:46:27.309]  This has only just begun.
[03:46:27.309 --> 03:46:31.971]  But you have to be very careful, because in the short term, we're going to get wild swings.
[03:46:31.971 --> 03:46:34.533]  And it's important for a retail investor to not
[03:46:35.188 --> 03:46:40.450]  Do anything in this market where they could get caught by those swings.
[03:46:40.450 --> 03:46:49.894]  So, before anybody sort of tiptoes into these waters, just make sure you understand what you've got going and be prepared to stick in it for the long haul.
[03:46:49.894 --> 03:46:51.975]  Now, when does it end?
[03:46:51.975 --> 03:47:00.418]  One of the things that could end all of this is when a new global currency goes into effect and is really working.
[03:47:00.418 --> 03:47:02.579]  And that will diminish the need for
[03:47:04.170 --> 03:47:08.553]  For using precious metals as sort of a global currency.
[03:47:08.553 --> 03:47:14.977]  This reflects not only that need, but the distrust that everybody has in government.
[03:47:14.977 --> 03:47:21.381]  So, we're really watching a deterioration in the quality of sovereign government credits worldwide.
[03:47:21.381 --> 03:47:23.902]  So, I think this goes on for a long time.
[03:47:23.902 --> 03:47:31.507]  You just want to be really careful because we're talking about something that will price in very volatile ways against your local currency.
[03:47:32.222 --> 03:47:33.443]  Alright, let's go to the phone lines.
[03:47:33.443 --> 03:47:35.184]  Let's go to Betty in Texas.
[03:47:35.184 --> 03:47:37.225]  Betty, what's on your mind?
[03:47:37.225 --> 03:47:41.148]  Catherine, thank you so much for allowing me to speak to you.
[03:47:41.148 --> 03:47:43.189]  I'm so thrilled with everything that you say.
[03:47:43.189 --> 03:47:50.934]  However, I would like to add in something about the Copenhagen Treaty.
[03:47:50.934 --> 03:47:57.599]  One, Obama still hasn't produced his birth certificate, and he's being sued over that by Phil Berg, I believe.
[03:47:58.309 --> 03:48:09.018]  And two, he cannot sit as the head of the Security Council of the United Nations while he's being President of the United States.
[03:48:09.018 --> 03:48:20.247]  And so, have you heard anything about whether or not Filberg has filed an injunction to keep Obama from going and signing the Copenhagen Treaty?
[03:48:20.247 --> 03:48:22.568]  And what do you think about it?
[03:48:22.568 --> 03:48:23.269]  I don't know.
[03:48:26.957 --> 03:48:35.384]  I'm just ignorant of the status of the lawsuit occasionally, you know, like anybody I'll read things on the internet, but I really am not current.
[03:48:35.384 --> 03:48:40.008]  And I don't think that there's anything actually going on in regards to the Copenhagen Treaty due to that.
[03:48:40.008 --> 03:48:40.968]  I thank you for the call, Betty.
[03:48:40.968 --> 03:48:42.850]  Let's go to Chris in New Mexico.
[03:48:42.850 --> 03:48:45.532]  Chris, you're on the line.
[03:48:45.532 --> 03:48:46.333]  Thanks, Jason.
[03:48:46.333 --> 03:48:47.393]  Hi, Catherine.
[03:48:47.393 --> 03:48:49.335]  Hi, Jason.
[03:48:49.335 --> 03:48:50.296]  No, that was Jason.
[03:48:50.296 --> 03:48:50.556]  I'm Chris.
[03:48:51.923 --> 03:48:55.124]  Chris, what do you got for us?
[03:48:55.124 --> 03:48:59.166]  Catherine, nice to hear you in the daytime instead of the middle of the night.
[03:48:59.166 --> 03:49:04.207]  Would you spend a few minutes talking about one of the alternative currencies?
[03:49:04.207 --> 03:49:07.189]  I think that's the only way that we're going to get out of this mess.
[03:49:07.189 --> 03:49:12.991]  Something like along the lines of Ithaca Hours or some of the others that have been established.
[03:49:12.991 --> 03:49:16.512]  I know you know a little bit about that, so can you address that?
[03:49:17.626 --> 03:49:27.150]  Sure, I think there are a number of ways that we can start to transact both locally and in our networks.
[03:49:27.150 --> 03:49:38.555]  And the important thing to understand is it needs to be built in a very granular way which gives energy to the people in the short term within a community.
[03:49:38.555 --> 03:49:42.357]  One of the challenges of community currencies is that
[03:49:44.410 --> 03:49:52.035]  If you organize them as a sort of new legal structure and make them complicated, they can be very expensive and time-consuming.
[03:49:52.035 --> 03:49:58.000]  And I'm a believer in the just-do-it method, and I would look at several things.
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:04.745]  One is the idea of using your gold and silver coins as just a medium of exchange.
[03:50:04.745 --> 03:50:09.149]  If you go to our website at solari.com, Franklin Sanders of The Money Changer and I
[03:50:09.867 --> 03:50:23.515]  Have created a little application, which we're about to redevelop and roll out a new one in 2010, called the Gold and Silver Payment Calculator, and it allows you to translate back and forth between dollars.
[03:50:23.515 --> 03:50:26.576]  You know, let's say you want to pay somebody $100.
[03:50:26.576 --> 03:50:33.680]  You can use the calculator to very quickly calculate in silver and gold coins what it would take to pay that amount.
[03:50:33.680 --> 03:50:38.383]  So the first thing, I'm going to suggest three things, but the first is
[03:50:39.249 --> 03:50:42.031]  Just start using your gold and silver coins to transact.
[03:50:42.031 --> 03:50:43.612]  Just do it.
[03:50:43.612 --> 03:50:45.854]  Let's talk about those other two things on the other side.
[03:50:45.854 --> 03:50:47.435]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:47.435 --> 03:50:49.116]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[03:50:49.116 --> 03:50:52.558]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlan.tv, and Catherine's website, Solari.com.
[03:50:52.558 --> 03:50:53.359]  S-O-L-A-R-I.com.
[03:51:02.372 --> 03:51:06.655]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[03:51:06.655 --> 03:51:09.936]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[03:51:09.936 --> 03:51:17.721]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy if we the people
[03:51:17.981 --> 03:51:20.222]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[03:51:20.222 --> 03:51:22.603]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[03:51:22.603 --> 03:51:29.405]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[03:51:29.405 --> 03:51:35.147]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[03:51:35.587 --> 03:51:38.189]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[03:51:38.189 --> 03:51:45.954]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market and numerous other high-quality health supplements.

[03:51:48.456 --> 03:51:52.418]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A, utopiasilver.com.

[03:51:53.699 --> 03:51:53.759]  1-888-213-4338.
[03:52:02.916 --> 03:52:06.943]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:06.943 --> 03:52:10.189]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.189 --> 03:52:11.612]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:12.313 --> 03:52:14.994]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:14.994 --> 03:52:21.375]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.375 --> 03:52:26.916]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.916 --> 03:52:36.538]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.658 --> 03:52:39.019]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.019 --> 03:52:40.599]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.599 --> 03:52:43.060]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.060 --> 03:52:45.180]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.180 --> 03:52:50.322]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.322 --> 03:53:02.465]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:02.465 --> 03:53:03.805]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[03:53:04.184 --> 03:53:07.985]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[03:53:07.985 --> 03:53:12.847]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[03:53:12.847 --> 03:53:18.528]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[03:53:18.528 --> 03:53:20.989]  Patriotfood.com.
[03:53:20.989 --> 03:53:26.091]  135 pounds of long-lasting dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[03:53:26.091 --> 03:53:31.852]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[03:53:31.852 --> 03:53:33.653]  And survivalseeds.com.
[03:53:34.525 --> 03:53:38.208]  Where I just released my best offer ever.
[03:53:38.208 --> 03:53:42.251]  7,000 heirloom vegetable seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[03:53:42.251 --> 03:53:48.637]  That's over 4 pounds of seed, and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[03:53:48.637 --> 03:53:52.960]  And now, you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[03:53:52.960 --> 03:53:57.284]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[03:53:57.284 --> 03:53:59.826]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[03:54:10.199 --> 03:54:12.340]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:12.340 --> 03:54:13.761]  He's out on assignment in Dallas.
[03:54:13.761 --> 03:54:15.462]  I'm Jason Burmess sitting in.
[03:54:15.462 --> 03:54:18.424]  If you missed any of the program, remember following the broadcast.
[03:54:18.424 --> 03:54:21.166]  The podcast is available at InfoWars.com.
[03:54:21.166 --> 03:54:29.631]  Three great guests today, Jim O'Neill, Gary Lachman, Catherine Austin-Fitz, and of course Alex Jones joined us for the better part of an hour.
[03:54:29.631 --> 03:54:32.954]  Catherine, you were just talking about what currencies you could get into.
[03:54:32.954 --> 03:54:38.077]  You said, you know, use your silver and gold coins as currencies, but you had two other points you wanted to make.
[03:54:38.390 --> 03:54:43.214]  Sure, and this is the, you know, how do we start currencies by the just do it method.
[03:54:43.214 --> 03:54:45.976]  The second is, there's a wonderful association called IRDA.
[03:54:45.976 --> 03:54:50.399]  It's the International Association Related to Barter Networks.
[03:54:50.399 --> 03:54:57.224]  In your community, it is likely that you already have a barter network set up that could use some support.
[03:54:57.224 --> 03:55:03.569]  And there is a great deal that can be done through barter networks, both locally and their network globally.
[03:55:03.569 --> 03:55:05.210]  So, you know, you can end up getting your
[03:55:05.868 --> 03:55:12.373]  Your tour package to Scotland for the holidays through your local barter network.
[03:55:12.373 --> 03:55:19.938]  So check out the IRDA website and find the local barter network or networks in your place and start to see if there aren't ways you can use it.
[03:55:19.938 --> 03:55:29.285]  A lot of times you'll find businesses report as much as a 10% increase in sales that come about by their use of barter.
[03:55:29.285 --> 03:55:34.769]  So there's a lot of opportunities, but we need to start, just build from the infrastructure that's there.
[03:55:35.447 --> 03:55:59.985]  Finally, there's a real opportunity, as Chris said, to explore exchanging or trading or using hours, just using hours among neighbors and friends and businesses, but then going to a more formal system of trading our time and trading hours that makes an awful lot of sense to explore.
[03:56:00.515 --> 03:56:10.244]  It starts with really talking to other people in your community, whether it's your neighbor or other small businesses, about how you can help each other save time or lower your expenses.
[03:56:10.244 --> 03:56:15.369]  So it really starts with socializing and communication and just exploring the ideas.
[03:56:15.369 --> 03:56:25.599]  If you can start to have more reciprocal relationships and connections, then you can move to a system of really training hours, and there's lots of information on the website now.
[03:56:26.269 --> 03:56:34.951]  I will say one of the most interesting statistics, Jason, is during the Great Depression, there were over 3,200 local currencies in America.
[03:56:34.951 --> 03:56:38.072]  Do you think there'll be a revival in that?
[03:56:38.072 --> 03:56:40.212]  Over 3,100 counties.
[03:56:40.212 --> 03:56:46.113]  So this is something that we're going to return and be doing this again.
[03:56:46.113 --> 03:56:54.615]  And so it absolutely makes sense to spend time, but start with what you know, whether it's your gold and silver coins, barter networks in your community.
[03:56:55.089 --> 03:56:59.832]  Just getting to know more people in your neighborhood and seeing where you can't trade time.
[03:56:59.832 --> 03:57:04.856]  You know, just where I live in a very rural community, so we're always offering to help each other.
[03:57:04.856 --> 03:57:08.138]  I'm going into town, what can I pick up for you?
[03:57:08.138 --> 03:57:10.320]  Alright, final caller, Noel in Illinois.
[03:57:10.320 --> 03:57:11.841]  You're on the air.
[03:57:11.841 --> 03:57:12.582]  Yes, hi Jason.
[03:57:12.582 --> 03:57:18.826]  Fable Enemies was unbelievable, and I have a quick question in terms of the Climategate scandal.
[03:57:18.826 --> 03:57:21.148]  Have any of you guys talked about, there's a
[03:57:22.068 --> 03:57:25.312]  A newsletter from Earth Government March 27, 2003 which talks about how
[03:57:28.601 --> 03:57:36.346]  We needed a Earth government, in terms of like a one-world government, to help, you know... I have seen that document, Noel.
[03:57:36.346 --> 03:57:37.406]  I have seen that document.
[03:57:37.406 --> 03:57:40.788]  I have not discussed it on the program, but that's purely oversight.
[03:57:40.788 --> 03:57:43.750]  The only thing about that document is it's not an actual email.
[03:57:43.750 --> 03:57:53.116]  It was something that was being emailed to other people as kind of like this precursor, I guess, to the global government they were going to try to get past in the Copenhagen Treaty.
[03:57:53.376 --> 03:58:03.058]  Very pro-One World Government, very pro-New World Order, but after all, that is where this all seems to be headed as they are trying to promote a global currency.
[03:58:03.058 --> 03:58:06.339]  Catherine Austin Fitz's website is solari.com.
[03:58:06.339 --> 03:58:08.179]  That's S-O-L-A-R-I.
[03:58:08.179 --> 03:58:15.921]  If you missed any of the program, we got the podcast coming to you at infowars.com in just a few moments, and the rebroadcast right after this.
[03:58:15.921 --> 03:58:17.061]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:17.061 --> 03:58:18.722]  I'm Jason Burmess, sitting in.
[03:58:18.722 --> 03:58:19.242]  Thank you all.
[03:58:43.193 --> 03:58:44.594]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:44.594 --> 03:58:48.675]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.994 --> 03:58:54.995]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:58:54.995 --> 03:59:00.318]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:59:00.318 --> 03:59:02.378]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:59:02.378 --> 03:59:07.361]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:59:07.361 --> 03:59:08.561]  How much do you want?
[03:59:08.561 --> 03:59:09.682]  When do you want it?
[03:59:09.682 --> 03:59:11.562]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:59:11.562 --> 03:59:12.643]  When will you need it?
[03:59:12.643 --> 03:59:14.844]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:59:14.844 --> 03:59:16.184]  Will there be any food?
[03:59:16.184 --> 03:59:17.485]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:59:17.705 --> 03:59:22.971]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:59:22.971 --> 03:59:26.556]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:59:26.556 --> 03:59:30.380]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:59:30.380 --> 03:59:31.601]  How much will you need?
[03:59:31.601 --> 03:59:32.503]  We don't know.
[03:59:32.503 --> 03:59:33.604]  How much do you want?
[03:59:33.604 --> 03:59:34.365]  All you can get.
[03:59:34.365 --> 03:59:35.346]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:59:35.626 --> 03:59:38.669]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:59:38.669 --> 03:59:40.451]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:59:40.451 --> 03:59:41.532]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:59:41.532 --> 03:59:45.635]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
