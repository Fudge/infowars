[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:40.240]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.240 --> 00:45.040]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this 12th day of
[00:45.040 --> 00:53.240]  January 2016 we're going to be live here for the next four hours because we've
[00:53.240 --> 00:56.000]  expanded the broadcast of four hours a day and then of course the one hour
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.560]  nightly news seven o'clock central so that's five hours of transmission a day
[01:01.560 --> 01:06.280]  four of it live and then of course many times the nightly news itself is live and
[01:06.280 --> 01:11.480]  expanded and upwards of six to eight hours long when we're covering elections
[01:11.480 --> 01:17.160]  debates or other major events we'll be covering the first presidential Republican
[01:17.160 --> 01:23.040]  debate of 2016 from Fox Business Channel we'll be analyzing the pundits and of
[01:23.040 --> 01:29.120]  course the candidates and more both at the kitty table debate and the big kid
[01:29.120 --> 01:36.560]  debate obviously huge economic unravelings continuing today as the world
[01:36.560 --> 01:41.800]  hurdles into the financial abyss we couldn't hurdle towards the financial
[01:41.800 --> 01:46.040]  abyss if we had an economy based on goods and services but more and more it
[01:46.040 --> 01:54.920]  is based not on mining not on farming not on commerce based on actual material
[01:54.920 --> 02:00.280]  or ideas it's based on derivatives which are counterfeit frauds which the
[02:00.280 --> 02:05.280]  establishment has created thousands of trillions of the last 30 years to take
[02:05.280 --> 02:10.600]  over and buy up the world with fraudulent paper and that's why as long as we
[02:10.600 --> 02:16.280]  defend that system we give them total political power over us the insiders we
[02:16.280 --> 02:22.200]  let them pick the winners and losers and it's untenable and so they're telling us
[02:22.200 --> 02:26.440]  get ready for austerity and to be poor and to live in 200 square foot coffin
[02:26.440 --> 02:31.640]  apartments so we can pay more taxes and more rent to the owners you're gonna
[02:31.640 --> 02:35.320]  pay more for the 200 square foot apartment you're not gonna be able to
[02:35.320 --> 02:39.920]  get a thousand square foot apartment is the point all the yuppies think oh I'm
[02:39.920 --> 02:44.480]  gonna get a cheaper apartment save money no you're not it's designed to take
[02:44.480 --> 02:48.600]  everything you've got and make it to where you can never become self-sufficient
[02:48.600 --> 02:54.880]  that's the name of the game on a reservation with Native Americans stuck
[02:54.880 --> 03:08.640]  on it or a British concentration camp you say in Georgia in 1779 you never let
[03:08.640 --> 03:13.720]  the occupied population be anywhere self-sufficient that's how you control
[03:13.720 --> 03:18.720]  them and I know I'm stating incredibly obvious simple things here but it's
[03:18.720 --> 03:25.520]  amazing big developments on Syria big developments on the campaign trail with
[03:25.520 --> 03:29.720]  Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire surging 14 points ahead of Clinton more more
[03:29.720 --> 03:33.360]  mainstream media begins to turn on Clinton and she's got a lot of inside
[03:33.360 --> 03:38.720]  power though so who knows what's really going to happen I mean it's hard to bring
[03:38.720 --> 03:43.760]  her down rumors of her demise have been exaggerated to quote Mark Twain but the
[03:43.760 --> 03:48.920]  bigger they are the harder they fall and she's close to it she's hanging on by
[03:48.920 --> 03:54.160]  her fingernails but the witch is a flying monkey and so the wings don't
[03:54.160 --> 03:57.880]  really let her fly but they help keep her up and keep some of the weight off so
[03:57.880 --> 04:00.640]  you know she's not just holding on by our fingernails she's got those little
[04:00.640 --> 04:05.680]  those little little flying monkey wings being sarcastic obviously before the
[04:05.680 --> 04:12.120]  New York Times puts out a report I believe Hillary Clinton has monkey wings
[04:12.120 --> 04:17.920]  flying monkey wings this morning I got up and I saw drudgereport.com we can
[04:17.920 --> 04:25.520]  show folks a shot of that and it says ex files goes Alex Jones and I'll just be
[04:25.520 --> 04:30.720]  honest with you I'm used to seeing so many articles about me every day I
[04:30.720 --> 04:34.480]  didn't even really read it because I was so busy looking at financial news world
[04:34.480 --> 04:41.720]  news and other stuff but as I began to read you know deeper into the news today
[04:41.720 --> 04:46.600]  I couldn't help myself but actually read the article and it's got the creator of
[04:46.600 --> 04:51.960]  the ex files admitting that the new season the relaunch is going to be
[04:51.960 --> 04:58.400]  based basically around this show and he even admits it it's pretty amazing

[09:21.760 --> 09:30.760]  now to foment Palestinian uprising for political gain again this follows the
[09:30.760 --> 09:34.560]  pattern of knowing there's an Arab spring coming knowing there's a lot of real
[09:34.560 --> 09:40.400]  beefs knowing there's a lot of real progressive liberal movements towards
[09:40.400 --> 09:46.840]  women having freedom lower taxes less regulations thomas jefferson liberal
[09:46.840 --> 09:51.880]  stuff they want to head that off at the past five years ago so they detonate the
[09:51.880 --> 09:56.600]  muslim brotherhood operations to flood the middle east and africa and take
[09:56.600 --> 10:03.560]  over with radical jihad and it's in her emails i mean we have them ladies and
[10:03.560 --> 10:11.480]  gentlemen we know their battle plan and shame on us if we don't stand up against
[10:11.480 --> 10:17.080]  it that's just some of the news that's up on info wars dot com and prison
[10:17.080 --> 10:24.320]  planet dot com we've got more attacks in europe the u.s. and canada they're
[10:24.320 --> 10:29.480]  almost daily now with people going into nightclubs police stations you name it
[10:29.480 --> 10:35.480]  and and shooting at people shooting people suicide vest attacking shooting
[10:35.480 --> 10:42.920]  police and it's really not even the news that it's an islamic jihad attack i
[10:42.920 --> 10:51.600]  mean you thought it was bad what just happened in san Bernadino a month ago and
[10:51.600 --> 10:55.400]  it took him two and a half days to even admit that it was an islamic attack
[10:55.400 --> 10:59.280]  obviously it was a radical islamic attack they've been trained overseas the
[10:59.280 --> 11:07.160]  fbi was on them two years ago in the mosque and they sent the justice
[11:07.160 --> 11:11.440]  department down to basically engage in a criminal investigation for civil rights
[11:11.440 --> 11:14.920]  violations and ordered the fbi and homeland security to leave the mosque
[11:14.920 --> 11:22.680]  alone and out of the entire mosque of over 500 people they were targeting those
[11:22.680 --> 11:28.200]  two and look what happened so you wonder why the fbi can't stop these people it's
[11:28.200 --> 11:33.640]  because they're not allowed to and it's because when the attacks happen the
[11:33.640 --> 11:36.880]  establishment comes and takes our rights and our liberties and i want to be a
[11:36.880 --> 11:42.560]  hundred percent clear about something there have been times in islam for
[11:42.560 --> 11:46.560]  several hundred years lord moctins talked about this when they innovated
[11:46.560 --> 11:52.440]  they invented science and they were not as barbaric as europe was it's just a
[11:52.440 --> 11:57.160]  fact but in its first phase of islam and now this latter phase not the middle
[11:57.160 --> 12:02.560]  section but the third act of islam is probably the most barbarous we've ever
[12:02.560 --> 12:09.480]  seen and it is a radical expansionist political system now not religious
[12:09.480 --> 12:16.680]  religion is being used for political control and people could say look islam
[12:16.680 --> 12:21.520]  is not a religion of peace obviously in the modern sense it's not obviously in
[12:21.520 --> 12:26.560]  its founding it's not obviously it's like saying up is down down is up left is
[12:26.560 --> 12:32.560]  right two plus two equals ten but at the same time you could argue christianity
[12:32.560 --> 12:36.720]  is not a religion of peace with periods of its history and some of the things
[12:36.720 --> 12:41.640]  that are in the old testament and other areas taken out of context and being
[12:41.640 --> 12:47.400]  applied i mean there's genocidal stuff in the old testament because if one
[12:47.400 --> 12:52.760]  tribe came and took over the israelites they would kill all the men and take the
[12:52.760 --> 12:57.120]  women and children that's what tribes did it's what the romans did but before
[12:57.120 --> 13:03.280]  the romans came along and after the israelites had left and gotten out of
[13:03.280 --> 13:08.360]  Egypt they basically just started adopting many of the policies that they'd
[13:08.360 --> 13:12.680]  been under with Pharaoh i mean isn't that how it is you you complain about the old
[13:12.680 --> 13:16.880]  boss but as soon as you're the new boss you engage in that same behavior so i'm
[13:16.880 --> 13:22.960]  not going to sit here and be dishonest to earn political points and say that
[13:22.960 --> 13:27.200]  only islam is running around bloodthirsty murdering people in history
[13:27.200 --> 13:34.160]  under different phases of every culture whether it was zin buddhist japanese or
[13:34.160 --> 13:42.440]  the 12 tribes in israel juda only being one of them i mean the tribes were
[13:42.440 --> 13:46.000]  fighting each other in israel to use an old testament example constantly and one
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.840]  tribe would be good and would become prosperous the other tribe would become
[13:48.840 --> 13:53.480]  corrupt and would collapse and go into bondage i mean it's a history book
[13:53.480 --> 13:58.080]  really to show you the cycles we go through but whether it's the muslims
[13:58.080 --> 14:02.680]  whether it's the orthodox christians whether it's evangelical christians
[14:02.680 --> 14:06.720]  whether it's been the catholics you've had warlike popes you've had anti-war
[14:06.720 --> 14:13.000]  popes there's been different periods in culture but here's the fact there's a
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.680]  billion two hundred million muslims they're being dominated and run by
[14:16.680 --> 14:22.200]  radical groups now and so islam itself is being completely radicalized in this
[14:22.200 --> 14:27.920]  period and is a dangerous bloodthirsty political cult intimidating and
[14:27.920 --> 14:32.800]  radicalizing its own people to the most bizarre extremes because when you become
[14:32.800 --> 14:37.120]  a cult the most radical of the group whether it be third wave feminist
[14:37.120 --> 14:42.880]  whether it be black lives matter whether it be radical islam whether it be
[14:42.880 --> 14:49.720]  second amendment groups whoever is the most radical will end up in an
[14:49.720 --> 14:56.560]  orthodoxy being the dominant and that's why under leftism they try to be so
[14:56.560 --> 15:01.480]  radical mothers and fathers are bad he and she is bad your purple penguins
[15:01.480 --> 15:05.960]  brown bags are racist oh my gosh they're serving chinese food at the college on
[15:05.960 --> 15:11.040]  tuesdays that's racist oh my gosh the halls called lynch don't hang us we're
[15:11.040 --> 15:15.800]  scared you're like that doesn't make any sense that's crazy oh really they run
[15:15.800 --> 15:19.600]  everything they're taking over they're the most radical demanding full
[15:19.600 --> 15:24.440]  political control and then we acquiesce to it I mean if you'll stop saying
[15:24.440 --> 15:28.920]  mother and father you'll do anything these cultists tell you to do and it's
[15:28.920 --> 15:36.080]  all over the world these are power-tripping nuts they are cult leaders
[15:36.080 --> 15:41.720]  by every historical yardstick and there is a rebellion against it worldwide and
[15:41.720 --> 15:47.520]  they want to make that rebellion right wing versus left wing and and and the
[15:47.520 --> 15:51.600]  main vehicle of the takeover is left wing but if we just fight it as we're
[15:51.600 --> 15:55.520]  fighting left wingism we're gonna lose because they've got the controlled
[15:55.520 --> 15:59.760]  opposition of the republican and the Tory leadership in England and the
[15:59.760 --> 16:03.960]  conservative leadership in Europe they've got those people on a very short
[16:03.960 --> 16:09.920]  leash financed blackmailed bribed controlled intimidated into submission
[16:09.920 --> 16:14.520]  and if you don't submit night like Nigel Farage your airplane blows up or
[16:14.520 --> 16:19.800]  crashes and then the wheels are unbolted on your car so the wheels come off and
[16:19.800 --> 16:25.800]  you almost die last week or you're arrested like Marie Le Pen the leader
[16:25.800 --> 16:33.160]  in the presidential race that's starting up in France if you're real they come
[16:33.160 --> 16:38.480]  after you and I've had them come after me obviously in the press the media
[16:38.480 --> 16:44.440]  physically as well so folks need to understand that the totalitarians
[16:44.440 --> 16:49.400]  masquerading as the left are making a move teamed up with radical Islam to
[16:49.400 --> 16:53.800]  actually take over the world they're not going to install Sharia law this year
[16:53.800 --> 16:56.760]  even 10 years from now in the United States though it's now happening in
[16:56.760 --> 16:59.920]  Paris it's now happening in Frankfurt it's now happening in
[16:59.920 --> 17:08.160]  Berlin it's now happening in many of these European cities but what is going
[17:08.160 --> 17:15.280]  to come in is leftist police and bureaucracies and South African style
[17:15.280 --> 17:20.320]  truth and reconciliation commissions under the UN strong cities initiative
[17:20.320 --> 17:25.360]  this is their announcement to bully local governments bully local police into
[17:25.360 --> 17:29.640]  submitting to their whole political system and their whole political view or
[17:29.640 --> 17:35.280]  they'll be destroyed in the media it's a bunch of intimidation and then ending
[17:35.280 --> 17:45.040]  free speech if it quote offends any outside group like the Muslims but then
[17:45.040 --> 17:51.120]  classical libertarian or conservative ideas Americana ideas family ideas will
[17:51.120 --> 17:57.880]  not be accepted or condoned so it's the classic animal farm where you know they
[17:57.880 --> 18:02.360]  tell you up front all animals are equal but then by the end the pigs go no we're
[18:02.360 --> 18:07.200]  more equal than you and two legs good four legs bad you know at first you the
[18:07.200 --> 18:10.680]  humans are bad we got a revolt against them in the allegory because they're on

[22:05.840 --> 22:09.400]  electronic pick pocketing ten years ago I created a way to protect my own cards

[22:12.280 --> 22:16.600]  a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID I felt having to
[22:16.600 --> 22:20.840]  broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy soon after it was
[22:20.840 --> 22:25.080]  also announced that credit cards debit cards us passports hotel room keys and
[22:25.080 --> 22:29.440]  even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID it was then I formed

[24:18.280 --> 24:23.960]  the revenant the Leonardo DiCaprio and it was better than I thought it be it is
[24:23.960 --> 24:33.920]  a very avant-garde film but depressing by the end so it definitely a new height
[24:33.920 --> 24:38.600]  in cinema and I can tell you what the bear really does so spoiler alert
[24:38.600 --> 24:43.480]  straight ahead does it really rape him well we'll talk about that coming up
[24:43.480 --> 24:48.160]  just because it's interesting to look at culture and to see how it affects people
[24:48.160 --> 24:52.520]  versus reality this is one of my big subjects I wish they'd make movies
[24:52.520 --> 24:57.720]  about the Indian Wars as they were called from say 1800 to 1840 in the
[24:57.720 --> 25:04.600]  Midwest that's the real wars that's the you know hardcore stuff and this film
[25:04.600 --> 25:08.880]  actually touches on it so that's coming up we're not about entertainment we are
[25:08.880 --> 25:16.440]  about history and I will get into how this broadcast is affecting culture I've
[25:16.440 --> 25:25.740]  known that most big Hollywood films now like The Last Captain America and so
[25:25.740 --> 25:30.880]  many others action-adventure films thriller films you name it that the
[25:30.880 --> 25:35.160]  directors and writers gather a lot of information directly from this show and
[25:35.160 --> 25:38.640]  I've been told that by Hollywood folks as well and I can just see it quotes I've
[25:38.640 --> 25:46.920]  made you know in major films and I know there's some other big films being
[25:46.920 --> 25:52.800]  produced in things where they want the rights to actually have an Alex Jones type
[25:52.800 --> 25:57.320]  character but they want to use my actual quotes so I've been reached out to and
[25:57.320 --> 26:01.240]  in several big films that are about to go into production where there is an
[26:01.240 --> 26:05.880]  Alex Jones character but I got up this morning and I'll cover this more in the
[26:05.880 --> 26:10.360]  next segment because it ties into how successful the info or is and Chris
[26:10.360 --> 26:15.720]  Carter of the X files is in an entertainment weekly story it's linked
[26:15.720 --> 26:19.960]  right in the middle of drudge report comm it's also up on info wars comm X
[26:19.960 --> 26:29.120]  files reveal has controversial new theories Chris Carter on his hit Fox
[26:29.120 --> 26:35.400]  Return which warns of you and takeover and links to 9-11 and other things Kim
[26:35.400 --> 26:42.680]  Charles you name it and then they just go on to say that it's based on Alex
[26:42.680 --> 26:48.880]  Jones and then it goes on to say that the topics are but also the talk show
[26:48.880 --> 26:52.440]  host character and they say well we're gonna have a right winger on the show
[26:52.440 --> 26:55.880]  these as well as Jones really isn't a right winger he's a libertarian so I've
[26:55.880 --> 27:00.920]  never talked to Chris Carter I know Dean Haglin one of the characters in the X
[27:00.920 --> 27:04.920]  files and also the spinoff alone gunman is a listener and he said that Carter
[27:04.920 --> 27:08.440]  was familiar and did follow the show I was told that about seven eight years
[27:08.440 --> 27:12.560]  ago but we never even really reached out to Carter kind of already covering this
[27:12.560 --> 27:19.800]  now but I'll cover more later but the main reason was the CIA approached Carter
[27:19.800 --> 27:26.800]  and implanted with him topics they wanted covered on the show and one of
[27:26.800 --> 27:30.560]  them was a group hijacking a jumbo jet by remote control to fly in the World
[27:30.560 --> 27:38.520]  Trade Center to blame Afghanistan and bring in martial law in America and I
[27:38.520 --> 27:43.000]  know Carter was reportedly freaked out about it but then well I did reach out
[27:43.000 --> 27:48.280]  to Carter through a publicist but now I think about but no response back but I
[27:48.280 --> 27:53.080]  think if they're basing on the new series they say on topics I cover and
[27:53.080 --> 27:57.200]  basically Alex Jones and somewhat Glenn Beck will Glenn Beck bases himself on
[27:57.200 --> 28:00.920]  me and that's well known I've talked to former Beck insiders where they when he
[28:00.920 --> 28:04.320]  was at CNN and Fox they would have like five people listening and watching the
[28:04.320 --> 28:09.280]  show and then taking the material which is fine I just don't want to be attacked
[28:09.280 --> 28:14.200]  on top of it then by the guy that takes everything I do and basically twisted
[28:14.200 --> 28:17.720]  around a little bit I mean I don't care I want to just beat the globalist the
[28:17.720 --> 28:22.760]  most sincere form of flattering is imitation and I just want to beat the
[28:22.760 --> 28:27.520]  globalist and if folks have a better delivery than I or a different delivery
[28:27.520 --> 28:32.600]  then you can take everything I say and do folks if your other talk show host I
[28:32.600 --> 28:37.040]  don't care but so many people want to one up it and say Alex Jones is bad
[28:37.040 --> 28:41.120]  because that's like mounting a big head on their wall in fantasy land it's a
[28:41.120 --> 28:44.680]  plastic head it's not my head but they imagine that they've mounted my head on
[28:44.680 --> 28:52.000]  the wall and all it does is make us more successful I'll be honest with you
[28:52.000 --> 28:57.720]  though there are some downsides to becoming so successful and popular that
[28:57.720 --> 29:03.600]  you that you get mainstreamed you know I told Politico years ago when when
[29:03.600 --> 29:07.240]  Rand Paul won the Senate I said he won because he was an underdog and
[29:07.240 --> 29:10.920]  anti-establishment the only way he won't be successful is if he becomes
[29:10.920 --> 29:15.840]  establishment or if you're even more sophisticated and if the media embraces
[29:15.840 --> 29:23.400]  him you are so discredited that will destroy Rand Paul and Rand Paul still
[29:23.400 --> 29:28.160]  does great things still tells the truth I respecting he's he does a great job but
[29:28.160 --> 29:32.840]  in rhetoric he's embraced the mainstream and been so gentlemanly and gone after
[29:32.840 --> 29:38.680]  Trump and things that people have taken him now as establishment and he's in
[29:38.680 --> 29:43.880]  trouble because he listens to his beltway advisors that are dumbasses see
[29:43.880 --> 29:47.520]  we're changing the culture here in info wars you're following the fake culture
[29:47.520 --> 29:56.360]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.360 --> 30:03.520]  the Arizona Senate is poised to pass a bill that will outlaw citizens from
[30:03.520 --> 30:11.520]  taking videos of police even on their own private property SB 1054 reads it is
[30:11.520 --> 30:15.720]  unlawful for a person to knowingly make a video recording of law enforcement
[30:15.720 --> 30:19.680]  activity if the person making the recording does not have the permission
[30:19.680 --> 30:23.880]  of the law enforcement officer and it's within 20 feet of where the law
[30:23.880 --> 30:28.840]  enforcement activity is occurring which is to say if you were involved in a
[30:28.840 --> 30:33.120]  traffic stop you cannot film the encounter without the express permission
[30:33.120 --> 30:38.160]  of the officer the legislation represents another encroachment on private
[30:38.160 --> 30:42.960]  property by the state if police can tell you what to do on your own property
[30:42.960 --> 30:48.240]  you no longer have property rights and we've previously seen people arrested
[30:48.240 --> 30:52.160]  or worse in other parts of the country for filming their encounters with law
[30:52.160 --> 30:59.280]  enforcement you can find more reports on info wars dot com again ladies and

[33:37.680 --> 33:41.640]  just here but across the Western world from Australia to the United States from
[33:41.640 --> 33:47.280]  Canada to Germany to Balkanize and break up society Hillary and other
[33:47.280 --> 33:52.240]  Democrats are out all over the news I mean I see several clips a day now I
[33:52.240 --> 33:57.000]  don't even play them most days saying white terrorist white people are the
[33:57.000 --> 34:03.440]  problem just out of a clear blue sky I mean we say radical Islamists we don't
[34:03.440 --> 34:08.480]  say brown people that happen to be Arab are the problem it's incredibly racist
[34:08.480 --> 34:13.760]  but that's where this agenda is going and then we'll tie it in the latest on
[34:13.760 --> 34:18.040]  Syria and so much more and then get into what's happening in the culture wars
[34:18.040 --> 34:25.120]  but you've got the Thursday debate on Fox business coming up with Trump in the
[34:25.120 --> 34:33.240]  first place Cruz in second place on down to people like Jebus in sixth place so
[34:33.240 --> 34:39.720]  the field is narrowing Rand Paul was going to be number one at the junior
[34:39.720 --> 34:45.000]  debate or the kid table debate as it's called by the media and like at
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.760]  Thanksgiving at the big adult table and then there's not enough room for the
[34:47.760 --> 34:50.600]  kids so they're they're all over there throwing food at each other or whatever
[34:50.600 --> 34:54.400]  they're doing at the smaller table or begging to go outside and play football
[34:54.400 --> 34:57.600]  I guess that was when I was a kid now they want to go watch TV or play video
[34:57.600 --> 35:05.320]  games and Rand Paul came out and said hey please sign a petition to get me in
[35:05.320 --> 35:09.160]  the main debate and I think the things he's saying the things he's doing the
[35:09.160 --> 35:13.160]  polls he's shown and the fact that he was the frontrunner previously says that
[35:13.160 --> 35:20.280]  they should take Jebus out and put him in so he's skipping the debate which
[35:20.280 --> 35:23.560]  might be a good move to then make it a big deal that he's not there and then
[35:23.560 --> 35:27.840]  he gets more attention than if he did I'm not judging that it might be a good
[35:27.840 --> 35:32.880]  move what was not a good move and I say this because I've known Rand Paul 20
[35:32.880 --> 35:37.360]  years I know his father well I respect him I believe you make a great president
[35:37.360 --> 35:43.560]  but I know for a fact he's got people at his senatorial office who do not like
[35:43.560 --> 35:47.120]  me do not like the libertarian movement who tell him he needs to distance
[35:47.120 --> 35:51.040]  himself from his father and that tell him he needs to act like a Kentucky
[35:51.040 --> 36:01.600]  gentleman all day and that's just not working I mean you notice Donald Trump's
[36:01.600 --> 36:06.640]  main advisor that's helping him win and stay at the front for six months under
[36:06.640 --> 36:12.440]  withering attacks is saying come on my show a line with Alex Jones talk about
[36:12.440 --> 36:18.460]  9-11 and the stand-down with Bush to go after Jeb talk about Hillary and
[36:18.460 --> 36:23.480]  Benghazi talk about Hillary and Obama creating al-Qaeda and ISIS these are
[36:23.480 --> 36:27.600]  things I was saying two years ago with ISIS five years ago with Syria with
[36:27.600 --> 36:33.080]  al-Qaeda it's coming out of Donald Trump's mouth and he's winning and I'm
[36:33.080 --> 36:37.880]  not taking the credit for that but but but certainly that's the spectrum in
[36:37.880 --> 36:45.560]  which we swim telling the truth and it brings people together because they're
[36:45.560 --> 36:50.560]  sick of being lied to and so Rand Paul is good on so many fronts but I wish he
[36:50.560 --> 37:00.440]  was in the lead I know he's a good guy I know I can trust him but he's not just
[37:00.440 --> 37:04.760]  like two or three debates ago Donald Trump looked at him and he said hey
[37:04.760 --> 37:08.000]  you're in it shouldn't even be up here with 3% and soon you're gonna be off
[37:08.000 --> 37:16.520]  the stage because Donald Trump sharp folks sharp like a fox sharp like a big
[37:16.520 --> 37:23.880]  old blonde headed wolf and he knows what it takes to win he knows what America
[37:23.880 --> 37:27.560]  wants America wants our borders controlled when we got terrorist
[37:27.560 --> 37:33.640]  attack in us flooding in you shut that down until they're vetted he says these
[37:33.640 --> 37:39.240]  trillion dollar companies like Goldman Sachs that have hundreds of trillions
[37:39.240 --> 37:43.280]  derivatives themselves that are tax exempt and Google and General Electric
[37:43.280 --> 37:49.640]  you're gonna bring that money back here in America and you're gonna pay a small
[37:49.640 --> 37:54.920]  tax on it but just bringing the money back is gonna make the economy explode
[37:54.920 --> 37:58.560]  because then they'll spend it on factories and jobs and infrastructure
[37:58.560 --> 38:07.520]  here they're not doing that everything he's saying is anathema to the globalist
[38:07.520 --> 38:12.480]  that want a monopoly capitalist system not a capitalist system Goldman Sachs
[38:12.480 --> 38:21.800]  JP Morgan Wells Fargo Berkshire Hathaway you go to the Violence Policy
[38:21.800 --> 38:26.240]  Center handgun control incorporated the Nature Conservancy the Sierra Club the
[38:26.240 --> 38:31.880]  UN groups every major organization Mecha la Raza the Black Lives Matter Soros
[38:31.880 --> 38:36.320]  groups they're the enemy folks they're the number one number two number three
[38:36.320 --> 38:40.800]  number four those big six hedge funds mega banks companies it's all them at
[38:40.800 --> 38:46.600]  the top giving all the money to to finance mom and dad is a bad word your
[38:46.600 --> 38:53.640]  purple penguins white men are racist and evil raised taxes on the rich which
[38:53.640 --> 38:57.000]  means a hundred thousand dollars a year
[38:57.440 --> 39:01.560]  exempting themselves I mean when you're informed and you watch Warren Buffett
[39:01.560 --> 39:05.520]  all over TV every year saying raise taxes on the rich I don't pay taxes it's
[39:05.520 --> 39:09.640]  not fair and then he lobbies hundreds of millions of dollars the last decade to
[39:09.640 --> 39:16.960]  be exempt I mean it makes you get high blood pressure there's no debating it's
[39:16.960 --> 39:25.720]  sick there's no debating it's out of control there's no debating but see he
[39:25.720 --> 39:31.000]  placed tennis and owns dairy Queen eats ice cream he's a friendly little man
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.960]  yeah there's lots of friendly guys in suits that drive around yellow volts
[39:34.960 --> 39:41.800]  wagons like Ted Bundy or John Wayne Gacy dressed up like a clown nothing
[39:41.800 --> 39:44.520]  threatening about that
[39:47.040 --> 39:51.080]  every time you see a psycho there were in a suit and tie and driving a non
[39:51.080 --> 39:57.760]  threatening car because they want to be under the radar like a predator and the
[39:57.760 --> 40:04.360]  predator class plays the lottery ticket culture like a fiddle I mean that's what
[40:04.360 --> 40:10.840]  the lottery is and gambling is a tax on the poor you know if Vegas targeted rich
[40:10.840 --> 40:14.840]  people I wouldn't have an issue with it and look they've got their right free
[40:14.840 --> 40:19.000]  country I'm a libertarian but man you you know you go to Vegas and I've been
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.040]  there for video shoots films you name it Hollywood shoots a lot of stuff there
[40:22.040 --> 40:26.040]  because it's cheap and man I see these poor people I see these family people I
[40:26.040 --> 40:30.400]  see folks desperate dumping everything they've got house mortgage their whole
[40:30.400 --> 40:37.000]  future into some big glistening stinking parasitic system so some mobsters
[40:37.000 --> 40:44.080]  can have more mistresses and bigger faster private jets it's sick but that
[40:44.080 --> 40:50.160]  con game is nothing compared to the big con games of the private Federal Reserve
[40:50.160 --> 40:53.680]  it calls itself federal all right I'm gonna get into all this news it's just
[40:53.680 --> 41:01.160]  that it's very very frustrating to see the public
[41:01.160 --> 41:05.640]  gamed to think they're intellectuals to see so-called liberals who are pseudo
[41:05.640 --> 41:11.160]  intellectuals and you start talking to them and they're so ignorant they're not
[41:11.160 --> 41:18.280]  even stupid they're good at social stuff and good at fantasy land and good at
[41:18.280 --> 41:24.120]  playing along with the system they're good at being delusional but they're not
[41:24.120 --> 41:29.560]  real enough for themselves to admit they don't have a future on average and
[41:29.560 --> 41:34.840]  that we're going into a system based on austerity to make you poor and
[41:34.840 --> 41:49.520]  controllable it's a hundred percent but I've said this hundreds of times and I'm
[41:49.520 --> 41:55.520]  gonna say it again if we seduce and seduce is connected to the seven deadly
[41:55.520 --> 41:59.320]  sins and that's a bad connotation but I don't know a better term for it if we
[41:59.320 --> 42:10.560]  sell the cultural intelligentsia the artist the writers the poets the
[42:10.560 --> 42:16.800]  filmmakers the cinematographers the sports icons the actors the people that
[42:16.800 --> 42:23.000]  lead the fake world the fake strata the fake haze that we're not supposed to
[42:23.000 --> 42:27.320]  rise up above and see the elites building their Elysium up on the mountain
[42:27.320 --> 42:32.760]  top their golden fields of advanced technology life extension I'm about
[42:32.760 --> 42:38.920]  rising above that cloud rising above the haze but what is Hollywood what is the
[42:38.920 --> 42:46.560]  fake culture it is that artificial haze put there to obstruct what's above it
[42:46.560 --> 42:50.600]  and they tell the elites in Hollywood they tell the big directors they tell
[42:50.600 --> 42:55.120]  the big producers play ball and you'll be part of the future but then when they
[42:55.120 --> 43:02.360]  get deeper into it it's so horrific most of them run to rural areas of Europe
[43:02.360 --> 43:13.240]  or to New Zealand or to the Appalachians or to the Ozarks because it's so
[43:13.240 --> 43:18.680]  scary and I've met with and talked to a lot of those people off record and they
[43:18.680 --> 43:22.600]  tell me almost everyone they talked to in Hollywood I've been telling this about
[43:22.600 --> 43:27.640]  three four years is awake and doesn't want to be liberal doesn't want to be
[43:27.640 --> 43:34.280]  conservative wants to be libertarian wants to be 1776 once private property
[43:34.280 --> 43:39.120]  and freedom and family back and they're liberal and if you want to be gay or you
[43:39.120 --> 43:43.000]  want to have an abortion whatever they're still liberal in that sense but
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.120]  they know vaccines are dangerous they've seen it for themselves they know
[43:46.120 --> 43:49.440]  there's a global government they know the CIA tries to make them write scripts
[43:49.440 --> 43:52.880]  a certain way they know their secret blacklist they know people get
[43:52.880 --> 43:58.320]  intimidated and they're tired of it and they want to not have to be cogs of the
[43:58.320 --> 44:00.600]  machine
[44:04.800 --> 44:11.160]  and if this last shred of collapses because the average person in Hollywood
[44:11.160 --> 44:16.000]  or the average person in media is not evil they're compartmentalized they're
[44:16.000 --> 44:20.320]  scared they're trying to go along with the system with whatever cues or whatever
[44:20.320 --> 44:28.440]  signals they get that will make them be elevated but as they go further down this
[44:28.440 --> 44:34.560]  road they see the tyranny they see how naked it is they see how I and many
[44:34.560 --> 44:40.400]  others broke down exactly what was happening 20 years ago and now it's all
[44:40.400 --> 44:44.920]  admitted and they hear me saying what the next phase is and they see the next
[44:44.920 --> 44:48.840]  phase beginning to be implemented and they realize oh my gosh this guy knows
[44:48.840 --> 44:53.840]  what he's talking about we better look out we better listen to him and they
[44:53.840 --> 44:58.080]  have battles with the big producers
[44:59.120 --> 45:03.480]  battles where the White House calls people up the one story I can tell
[45:03.480 --> 45:08.560]  because it wasn't off record and it came out in the New York Times call up Mark
[45:08.560 --> 45:12.800]  Cuban you're gonna make a film with Alex Jones you're gonna put loose change to
[45:12.800 --> 45:19.000]  that he produced in theaters nationwide we're going to indict you next week for
[45:19.000 --> 45:24.480]  insider trading marks like I didn't insider failure we don't care you son of
[45:24.480 --> 45:30.520]  a bitch this is on the phone we're putting you in jail Cuban comes out and
[45:30.520 --> 45:36.560]  says whoa I'm done guys I'm not putting that out I'm sitting there listening to
[45:36.560 --> 45:39.680]  him talking to the other people on the speakerphone he goes I'm out I'm out you
[45:39.680 --> 45:42.520]  know I wanted to put out avant-garde stuff and free speech and I don't even
[45:42.520 --> 45:45.280]  totally agree with your guys views but it's a riveting film and I know it would
[45:45.280 --> 45:50.040]  make a lot of money and I was put on a thousand screens but yeah I know it's
[45:50.040 --> 45:52.240]  already been downloaded a hundred million times for free I want to put this
[45:52.240 --> 45:56.120]  out but I'm dumb and the and then they didn't care they still indicted him he
[45:56.120 --> 46:00.920]  beat him when it came out in court they sent emails to saying we're going to
[46:00.920 --> 46:06.040]  indict you for your speech that's how arrogant they were they said we're going
[46:06.040 --> 46:10.800]  to indict you for your speech I had Lionel Chetwin who was the right-wing
[46:10.800 --> 46:15.520]  leader of the president Bush's film commission
[46:16.200 --> 46:23.720]  walk into a bathroom changing room I was in going on the conspiracy zone a show
[46:23.720 --> 46:28.240]  that was on television I know ten years ago twelve years ago and he walks in an
[46:28.240 --> 46:35.120]  LA into the bathroom and he says you're Alex Jones and it was like a gangster in
[46:35.120 --> 46:38.800]  a movie while I'm at the urinal he stands there looking at me intimidating
[46:38.800 --> 46:42.480]  look at I don't care okay I keep going yeah yeah so I went out and debated him
[46:42.480 --> 46:46.720]  right after that tore him up I try to find that somewhere online he goes
[46:46.720 --> 46:52.760]  we're gonna kill you did this thing on his teeth and I said really and somebody
[46:52.760 --> 46:56.400]  one of the aids comes walking in you know wanting to get us out there I go
[46:56.400 --> 46:59.200]  you're gonna kill me why'd you say that because I'm already thinking I'm gonna
[46:59.200 --> 47:01.720]  say he just threatened to kill me but he thinks we're alone he'll threaten to
[47:01.720 --> 47:05.880]  sue me instantly boom I go why'd you threaten to kill me he looks at the
[47:05.880 --> 47:10.160]  person goes oh I was just joking I go on air say he threatened to kill me his
[47:10.160 --> 47:14.280]  lawyers call send letters I send a letter back going I've got the witness
[47:14.280 --> 47:20.920]  that he said it go ahead and sue the head of the president's commission walked
[47:20.920 --> 47:26.440]  into a bathroom and said we're going to kill you and he works for the president
[47:26.440 --> 47:32.400]  of the United States how's that for a real ex files for you boys and girls
[47:32.400 --> 47:37.120]  you think it intimidates me then I'm standing at a urinal you get my space
[47:37.120 --> 47:40.080]  and start looking down at what I'm doing you think you think I'm that big of a
[47:40.080 --> 47:45.840]  wimp I'm ashamed of something you think you think I'm afraid you think oh my
[47:45.840 --> 47:49.880]  gosh you get my space I'm so scared oh you threaten to kill me I'm so scared I
[47:49.880 --> 47:56.880]  know what I'm doing boys I'm not a coward like you I don't run in packs I
[47:56.880 --> 48:02.800]  don't run in gangs I don't run to the biggest evil thing I can find and cozy
[48:02.800 --> 48:06.920]  up to it because I think it's gonna get me a head life I do what I think is
[48:06.920 --> 48:12.240]  right and I stand up for honor period and you can't beat ideas like that you
[48:12.240 --> 48:16.600]  can cut down my flesh but you can't cut down those ideas no matter how many lines
[48:16.600 --> 48:20.640]  you put out no matter how much you weaponize the media and to have Chris
[48:20.640 --> 48:25.160]  Carter come out and say Alex Jones in right wing he's a libertarian a lot of
[48:25.160 --> 48:28.600]  what he's saying come true I think there is a danger of a world government
[48:28.600 --> 48:33.960]  takeover that's in entertainment weekly folks we're gonna address this from a
[48:33.960 --> 48:40.320]  positive position but also look at the other side go read the article an Alex
[48:40.320 --> 48:47.680]  Jones character based on Alex Jones what's that smell like smells like
[48:47.680 --> 48:56.400]  victory I love the smell of napalm in the morning Charlie don't serve I love
[48:56.400 --> 49:03.480]  Robert DeVall I'm digressing it's not a power trip for me to see things like
[49:03.480 --> 49:07.160]  this going on because I already knew it was going on the fact that they're
[49:07.160 --> 49:15.560]  saying it is a hat tip and shows that the system knows they can't cover this up
[49:15.560 --> 49:19.440]  anymore and they can't stop Hollywood chomping at the bit to want to come out
[49:19.440 --> 49:22.360]  with all this and I know for a fact because I was told this by members of
[49:22.360 --> 49:25.960]  the cast and I'm gonna get Carter on I hope to talk about it all a lot of us
[49:25.960 --> 49:29.680]  contractually blocked that he didn't do a new ex files because they wouldn't let
[49:29.680 --> 49:35.120]  him do these topics a decade ago and then he did loan government to try to do
[49:35.120 --> 49:38.760]  these topics and still was controlled so the only reason he's coming back with
[49:38.760 --> 49:44.760]  the ex files is because they're gonna let him make what he wants now because
[49:44.760 --> 49:51.080]  that's really the big secret is that ten years ago shows like loan government
[49:51.080 --> 49:55.600]  were greatly based on this show and it's not bragging when I told people years
[49:55.600 --> 50:00.520]  ago oh I've gone out hanging out with Mike judge of King of the Hill he was
[50:00.520 --> 50:09.120]  in but had so much more idiocracy extract I mean the office space it just
[50:09.120 --> 50:14.720]  shows the power of what you could have done I was on access TV in 95 96 and 97
[50:14.720 --> 50:21.520]  and then he came on the show and said this and then I am the composite with
[50:21.520 --> 50:29.320]  two other people of Hank Hill and Gribble people said you liar then he comes on
[50:29.320 --> 50:34.160]  the show and says it I'm not lying the point is that's the power you have what
[50:34.160 --> 50:37.320]  would have happened if you would have gotten on access television if you would
[50:37.320 --> 50:42.200]  have spoken out and again that's just the power of influence all of us have
[50:42.200 --> 50:45.320]  power this is not me up here tooting my horn oh look the new ex files gonna be
[50:45.320 --> 50:48.880]  based on me you know with 30 million viewers a night or whatever it shows
[50:48.880 --> 50:53.600]  how culturally we're having victories ladies and gentlemen and yeah the
[50:53.600 --> 50:57.920]  system's gonna try to co-opt it see now if I don't kind of join with this the
[50:57.920 --> 51:01.600]  real knives come out you prepared to bug out infidel body armor and an army

[54:08.120 --> 54:14.120]  I'm the face that you have to face, mirroring your stare
[54:14.120 --> 54:18.120]  I'm what's left, I'm what's right, I'm the enemy
[54:18.120 --> 54:20.120]  So who are you?
[54:20.120 --> 54:24.120]  I'm the enemy to take you down, and you to your...
[54:24.120 --> 54:25.120]  So who are you?
[54:25.120 --> 54:27.120]  So who are you?
[54:27.120 --> 54:29.120]  Who are you?
[54:29.120 --> 54:32.120]  Are you just gonna go along with the establishment dribble?
[54:32.120 --> 54:35.120]  No, I know our general audience isn't
[54:35.120 --> 54:41.120]  But I'm talking about the countless millions every week
[54:41.120 --> 54:45.120]  That tune in for entertainment or come across something we're talking about and think
[54:45.120 --> 54:49.120]  Oh, this guy claims they're growing humanoids inside cows
[54:49.120 --> 54:52.120]  Yeah, and I'm holding up an MIT news article about it
[54:52.120 --> 54:58.120]  That's what's so frustrating is that most of what I've been talking about for 21 years
[54:58.120 --> 55:00.120]  21 years in April
[55:00.120 --> 55:04.120]  is stuff that was in white papers and government documents
[55:04.120 --> 55:08.120]  Now it's in the news because it's so far along
[55:08.120 --> 55:12.120]  What about the rights of these creatures?
[55:12.120 --> 55:15.120]  Oh, there's no rights for unborn babies, so now there's no rights for old people
[55:15.120 --> 55:18.120]  Now there's death panels. See how that works?
[55:18.120 --> 55:22.120]  We have a very dark force in control
[55:22.120 --> 55:26.120]  We have a globalist force taking control of humanity
[55:26.120 --> 55:33.120]  So yeah, it's fun to go see a documentary
[55:33.120 --> 55:37.120]  about Gorba Dahl and William F. Buckley in the movie Ends with a clip of Alex Jones
[55:37.120 --> 55:43.120]  It's fun to get up and hear the new X-Files is based in great part around what you cover and do
[55:43.120 --> 55:46.120]  But really, it's not
[55:46.120 --> 55:51.120]  It was a hundred times more satisfying to see top generals come out and say
[55:51.120 --> 55:55.120]  Our government ordered us to help create ISIS. It's horrible. We should stop it
[55:55.120 --> 55:58.120]  It was way more satisfying to have Cy Hirsch come on
[55:58.120 --> 56:00.120]  It was way more satisfying to have Matt Drudge in studio
[56:00.120 --> 56:03.120]  It was way more satisfying to have Donald Trump on
[56:03.120 --> 56:05.120]  Or to get an interview with Lewis Farrakhan
[56:05.120 --> 56:08.120]  Because that's the real world, folks
[56:08.120 --> 56:11.120]  We're fighting against stuff that's world-ending
[56:11.120 --> 56:14.120]  This TV stuff is fantasy land
[56:14.120 --> 56:21.120]  That's a reflection that we're doing a good job in the real world informing people
[56:21.120 --> 56:30.120]  That the fantasy land is now being influenced by what we do and more reality is being brought to it
[56:30.120 --> 56:37.120]  And who deserves credit for helping info wars explode?
[56:37.120 --> 56:40.120]  I mean, when I say 28 million people a week now, you know, it was 20 million a few months ago
[56:40.120 --> 56:44.120]  That's conservative
[56:44.120 --> 56:48.120]  And then it bounces around the information and causes all these chain reactions
[56:48.120 --> 56:51.120]  So I'm not Gonzo journalism where I report on myself
[56:51.120 --> 56:53.120]  It's though we are now the story
[56:53.120 --> 56:55.120]  Who do you think for it?
[56:55.120 --> 56:59.120]  George Norrie taking coast-to-coast AM 12, 13 years ago, whatever it was
[56:59.120 --> 57:02.120]  From 90% UFO in goblins and ghosts
[57:02.120 --> 57:05.120]  Which is interesting and entertaining and fine and wonderful
[57:05.120 --> 57:06.120]  Not judging anybody
[57:06.120 --> 57:11.120]  To 60% new world order, vaccines, checkpoints, police state
[57:11.120 --> 57:13.120]  What the ex files is doing
[57:13.120 --> 57:17.120]  So George Norrie deserves huge credit for his courage
[57:17.120 --> 57:21.120]  I know he had to really put himself on the line with premier networks
[57:21.120 --> 57:24.120]  And I'm not going to get into the inside baseball
[57:24.120 --> 57:26.120]  He put everything on the line to put me on
[57:26.120 --> 57:28.120]  That's how much credibility that guy's got
[57:28.120 --> 57:38.120]  He is super Americana, super manly, super confident, super patriot
[57:38.120 --> 57:44.120]  I mean, 14 years ago when he first had me on there talking to 16 million people a night
[57:44.120 --> 57:49.120]  They said, your job is in your hands, buddy, if something goes wrong with this
[57:49.120 --> 57:53.120]  Some of the producers and people were hyperventilating about putting him
[57:53.120 --> 57:56.120]  It was on national news the next day that he'd had me on
[57:56.120 --> 57:59.120]  Phone calls were made, everything else, but they couldn't stop the signal
[57:59.120 --> 58:02.120]  Because a bunch of executives above that are sick of what's happening too
[58:02.120 --> 58:03.120]  And realize what's happening
[58:03.120 --> 58:05.120]  There's rebellions going on at every level
[58:05.120 --> 58:07.120]  Highest level, lowest level, you name it
[58:07.120 --> 58:09.120]  And then who deserves the credit after that?
[58:09.120 --> 58:11.120]  In an even bigger way
[58:11.120 --> 58:14.120]  George Norrie helped launch us an even bigger platform, we were already huge
[58:14.120 --> 58:16.120]  But he helped it go even larger
[58:16.120 --> 58:18.120]  And then Matt Drudge took that
[58:18.120 --> 58:22.120]  Another order of magnitude and expanded it
[58:22.120 --> 58:25.120]  So DrudgeReport.com, CostaCostaAM.com
[58:25.120 --> 58:27.120]  Great jobs and what they've done
[58:27.120 --> 58:30.120]  Because the topics shifting away from UFOs on X-Files
[58:30.120 --> 58:34.120]  To chemtrails, checkpoints, FEMA camps, world government
[58:34.120 --> 58:39.120]  That's a big deal, folks, because it's all being announced now in the real world
[58:39.120 --> 58:41.120]  It shows they've collapsed
[58:41.120 --> 58:43.120]  They can't hold it back anymore
[58:43.120 --> 58:45.120]  This is a devastating victory
[58:45.120 --> 59:10.120]  To just hold any audience, they now have to join us
[59:16.120 --> 59:21.120]  And you're able to promote the products to friends and family and neighbors in your community
[59:21.120 --> 59:24.120]  And make money while helping people at the same time
[59:24.120 --> 59:25.120]  Another win-win
[59:25.120 --> 59:29.120]  That's why I'm a member of the young Jebedee team at infowarsteam.com

[59:39.120 --> 59:41.120]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me
[59:41.120 --> 59:45.120]  How young Jebedee and the products at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives
[59:45.120 --> 01:00:11.120]  Check it out for yourself today
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.120]  This is getting into the state of the Matrix propaganda system
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.120]  And the fact that the Matrix has got a lot of glitches in it
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.120]  And the global awakening is expanding exponentially
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.120]  Trump is one manifestation of that
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:26.120]  Whether he's good or bad, he is a manifestation of the uprising
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.120]  The rebellion
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.120]  The awakening where, oh, every mainstream media outlet
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.120]  And all the Republicans' attack even say is a demon
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.120]  The RNC puts all this money against him
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.120]  He must be great
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.120]  What a huge manifestation
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.120]  That's what I was getting into earlier with Chris Carter
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:48.120]  Coming out and saying the new X-Files is basically
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.120]  Gotta be based around a lot of the things I cover
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.120]  And the character around myself
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.120]  And Glenn Beck is a character based around me
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.120]  I'm a real person, he's a character based around me
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.120]  So now there's a TV show based on it
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.120]  It's very weird to have Glenn Beck
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.120]  Try to become me, but with his own flavor
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.120]  And then try to destroy me on top of it
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.120]  But I guess if you're like a pod person
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.120]  In body snatchers, you know, they get rid of the old body
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:18.120]  Or I guess the pod grows over you
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.120]  No, no, that's right, they put the pod beside you
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.120]  And then it basically absorbs you
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.120]  So, but I mean, the pod wasn't ever able to absorb me
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.120]  So now it doesn't look quite like me
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.120]  It either doesn't quite talk like me either
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.120]  But it's there
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.120]  And so they go, well, our show's based on Alex Jones
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.120]  And we think he's a pretty good guy
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.120]  And a lot of this stuff's coming true
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.120]  And the pod, because, you know, it mentions the pod
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.120]  And then says something bad about Bill O'Reilly
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.120]  So it's a weird feeling
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.120]  Now, I'm not going to get into this anymore
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.120]  Until our guest leaves us in about 35, 40 minutes
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.120]  And then I'm going to get into the trailer for the new X-Files
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.120]  That again, looks just like the intros to the TV show
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.120]  The radio show
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.120]  The promos that Darren McBrain makes
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.120]  Maybe Darren Mc... Darren, maybe we'll get Chris Carter on
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.120]  And you can make the new intro for the X-Files
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.120]  Or Jacarie Jackson
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.120]  We don't just have talented reporters
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:11.120]  They're just amazing artists when it comes to putting together the material
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:15.120]  And I want, from their unique perspectives
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.120]  Liberty-based optics
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.120]  To be super successful as well
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:27.120]  I mean, I don't want Jacarie Jackson to be the black Alex Jones
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.120]  I want him to be the Jacarie Jackson of the Liberty Movement
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:35.120]  I don't want Darren McBrain to be the Irish Alex Jones
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.120]  I want him to be the Darren McBrain of Liberty Movement
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.120]  I would love to hire a reporter or a crew member or a writer
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.120]  That ends up being more successful than me
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.120]  I mean, I made Paul Watson go on big TV radio shows
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.120]  I make him come on TV
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.120]  He's very calm, very mild mannered
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.120]  He doesn't like attention
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.120]  At least 15 years ago
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.120]  Now he likes it
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.120]  Now he does a great job
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.120]  And now he is his own person
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.120]  Out there is his own character
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.120]  In the real world
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:11.120]  But still, the whole world is a stage and each of us players upon it
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.120]  So I'm kind of getting into some of the inside stuff around info wars
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.120]  But I, you know, the problem is I want patriots that love Liberty
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:24.120]  Who want to fight tyranny and who want to be a personality
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:27.120]  To use the power of personality to promote freedom
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:33.120]  Not to promote being an egomaniac narcissist
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.120]  You see, people take my aggression, my confidence, my anger as narcissism
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.120]  But it's the opposite
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.120]  Narcissists don't tip, narcissists don't care about other people
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:46.120]  Narcissists don't give their crew members big bonuses
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.120]  Narcissists wouldn't hire a bunch of people around them
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.120]  And try to give them their platform
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.120]  I'm building a weapon system
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.120]  I'm trying to build a crew
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:04.120]  I'm trying to train and educate and lift people up
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:10.120]  So that they can go out and fight the globalist and expose what they're doing
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.120]  And you do that not just with the information
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.120]  But you also do that with your own humanity and your personality
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.120]  That people then resonate with out there
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.120]  And that's what's happening
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.120]  And you the viewers, you the listeners have incredible power
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.120]  Take action, get involved
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:35.120]  The great animating contest of Liberty and the future of humanity is being set right now
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.120]  Now there's so much on Hillary corruption
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:40.120]  Could we be about to witness the fall of Hillary Clinton?
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:47.120]  We're going to talk to one of the top folks over at Breitbart on the other side
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.120]  About what's unfolding
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.120]  Breitbart's in the news today, Twitter got rid of their Twitter account
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:58.120]  I'm basically in censorship saying they were unverified after the Breitbart editor
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:05.120]  The latest Gallup poll finds loyalty to Democrats and Republicans is at or near historic lows
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.120]  Reports U.S. News
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:13.120]  In 2015, for the fifth straight year, at least 4 in 10 U.S. adults identified as political independence
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.120]  42% said that they were independent last year
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:21.120]  43% listed themselves that way in 2014, reflecting little change
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:26.120]  29% said that they were Republicans and 26% said that they were Democrats
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:32.120]  The Democrats' share was the lowest for the party in the Gallup's 65 years of asking about party identification
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:36.120]  The previous Democratic low was 30% in 2014
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:44.120]  The 26% who identified with the GOP was just 1% higher than the historic Gallup low of 25%
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:47.120]  Self-identified Republicans in 2013
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:53.120]  Gallup found the big reason for the increase in independence was frustration with political gridlock

[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:21.120]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:28.120]  Our friends, three hours are left live before us. Peter Schweitzer is going to be with us to the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:33.120]  He is the editor-at-large of Breitbart.com and the president of the Government Accountability Institute
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:42.120]  And best-selling author of his new book is Extortion How Politics Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:47.120]  He's also been featured in 60 Minutes Documentaries The New York Times, Foreign Affairs
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:53.120]  I'm not going to go any further. The point is he is a major investigative journalist
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:57.120]  And the reason this is so important is look at Hillary with the emails
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:02.120]  Lying about him being caught in classified ones and she still hasn't gotten in trouble. Will they go after her?
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.120]  Or does she have too much blackmail on other people?
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.120]  How deep does the corruption go? Who is the most corrupt in Congress?
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:16.120]  And why does it seem like if you're super corrupt, you're almost too big to fail?
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:20.120]  And then when he leaves us at the bottom of the hour, we're going to get into the latest on Syria
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:27.120]  Putin says that Assad can be given asylum there. That looks like Assad made flee or something
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:33.120]  Also, integrated Muslim migrants say Germans are disgusting. They should all disappear in a new video
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:39.120]  A big article that's red linked to an infowars.com, Great Depression 2.0, Sell Everything
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:46.120]  2016, Cataclysmic Gear for Stocks, Warns RBS
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.120]  That's not infowars saying that. We're reporting on what mainstream news is reporting
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:55.120]  What governments, what major financial institutions are saying
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:03.120]  Peter, thank you so much for coming on. A big fan of the work that you and others are doing over at www.rightbark.com
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:10.120]  It just seems like so many of the things that were in the conspiracy realm years ago are now out in the open
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:15.120]  So have we reached a paradox where so much is out in the open but people don't get in trouble?
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:18.120]  I mean, are things worse or is it we just no more?
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:26.120]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex. I think we know more. I think that when you talk about financial corruption in Washington, DC
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:31.120]  It's always been a problem, but as government has gotten larger and more powerful
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:38.120]  You can start to add zeros to the back of those dollar amounts and so corruption's become a lot more lucrative
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:44.120]  What before might have been, you know, a $10,000 or $20,000 transaction for the benefit of a congressman
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:49.120]  Now is a $200 or maybe $2 million transaction and they hide it very, very effectively
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.120]  But more and more of it's coming out and it's both political parties
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:11:00.120]  And we have a permanent political class in Washington, DC that is enriching itself at our expense
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:07.120]  Break down the book. Why it's so important because I haven't read it yet but it's gotten amazing reviews
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:11.120]  And I've talked to a lot of insiders. They say that they learn things from the book
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:20.120]  Yeah, it was interesting. Several members of Congress have come to me after extortion was published and said, you know, that's exactly what goes on
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:27.120]  And really what the book extortion is about, Alex, is that we have thought about money and politics
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:34.120]  I think almost exactly wrong. The model that most of us have in mind, and of course this does happen in Washington
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:38.120]  Is it's kind of like that old Jimmy Stewart movie, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:44.120]  You've got these innocent people that go to Washington, they want to serve their communities in Congress or in the Senate
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:51.120]  And they slowly get corrupted by these outside forces and then they just can't resist it anymore and they become corrupt
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:12:00.120]  That certainly happens, but I think what is much more common is people that get attracted to government service are themselves
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:11.120]  Sort of corrupt to begin with. Many of them are. And so the model is not so much one of bribery where an earnest politician is getting bribed by money interest
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:23.120]  I think more often what's happening is politicians are extorting businessmen and people in their community and forcing them to in a sense become political contributors
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:31.120]  Even when they don't want to because the fear is if they don't, Alex, that bad things are going to happen to them. This is what the mafia does
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:39.120]  It's an extortive process and I think this is the reason you have an unprecedented flow of money coming to Washington, D.C.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:44.120]  Most people in business, not all, but most of them basically want to be left alone
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:54.120]  But the government's not going to let you be alone. They're going to force you to basically pay protection money so that bad things don't happen to you and your family
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:13:10.120]  And of course you've also got the book coming out, Clinton Cash, and I wanted to ask you from your research who are the kingpins, who are at the top of the corruption racket, but what really concerns me is we all know about Harry Truman and getting money for highways in Missouri or whatever
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:22.120]  And that's terrible, but there's always boss hog stuff in some areas and you try to keep it to a minimum, but now Saudi Arabian money, Chinese money, telling what films can produce
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:35.120]  When movies can come out, we've got the Clinton Foundation and billions of dollars from foreign countries with dictators and then suddenly she lets the State Department sign an agreement to ship them weapons
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:48.120]  It's so naked, it's so brazen that I wonder if they get away with this, what's next? I mean, I read about African dictators and stuff in Equatorial New Guinea and you think it's bad
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:14:01.120]  It's nothing compared to our leaders now, I mean, possibly could they be some of the most corrupt people ever making the Ameldo Marcus look like a good lady?
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:20.120]  Well, you know, as I point out in Clinton Cash, what the Clintons have done is figure out a unique way to get around laws that are designed to prevent foreign influence. You know, the Supreme Court heard a case in 2012, Alex, where two Canadian citizens challenged the
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:38.120]  constitutionality of a law that says, only if you are a US citizen, permanent resident, can you actually give to a political campaign? The Supreme Court heard the case from these two Canadians, they came back 9 to 0 and said, no, this law makes complete sense, we don't want foreign influence flowing into our elections
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:42.120]  When was the last time the Supreme Court agreed 9 to nothing on anything?
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:15:00.120]  Well, so the Clintons have figured out a way, they set up this foundation, the Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton hits the lecture circuit, and this is a way to circumvent that, so they can't get African dictators, they can't get corrupt people that are international fugitives to give money to their campaigns,
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:14.120]  but they can get those people to give to their foundation, and they can get those people to give Bill Clinton inflated speaking fees as a conduit for bribery, as opposed to giving to their political campaigns, and that's what they've done.
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:26.120]  And the level of corruption that involves the Russians, it involves organized crime, it involves African warlords, the people that the Clintons have taken money from is staggering and frightening.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:34.120]  And what I chart in the book is the connection between the flow of money and an action that Hillary Clinton takes as a statutory estate.
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:44.120]  And when you see this pattern repeated over and over again, the only conclusion you can come to is these events are connected and these are in effect bribes.
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:16:04.120]  And of course, the Associated Press and others are now reporting FBI Clinton probe expands to public corruption track with all the corruption, the cattle futures, the scams, the dead bodies, the mafia, the cocaine kingpins getting pardons.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:23.120]  I mean, there's no doubt in my view that the Clintons are organized crime. And is that why they're still in power? Because they're just too big to fail that you just can't arrest the president, the former president and the former first lady, because it would just be too painful, kind of like they let Nixon scamper off into the darkness.
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:30.120]  The difference is Nixon didn't do anything near this, and he went off into the darkness. The Clintons are still there running things.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:44.120]  Well, you know, Alex, look at the recent public corruption cases that we've had, you know, Senator, I'm sorry, Congressman, Governor McDonald in Virginia or Senator Menendez in New Jersey, or you have the governor of Oregon, Kitsaber, who resigned.
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:56.120]  In all of those cases, you had, you know, a few examples where they took money that they legally could take, but they took favorable actions for the benefit of the donor.
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:05.120]  You've got the governor of Virginia, former governor, who's in jail because of that. You've got Menendez facing charges. And I think these individuals should have been charged.
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:15.120]  But my point is that what they did, the scale of what they did, is small, very small, in comparison to the widespread pattern of conduct that the Clintons have done.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:25.120]  The dollar amounts are bigger. The people that they're taking the money from are far more nefarious. The favorable actions that Hillary took as Secretary of State are far worse.
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:43.120]  One of the cases that I highlighted in the book and that the New York Times of all people has confirmed in a 4,000-word front-page piece is the Clintons got $145 million from the shareholders in a small uranium company that wanted to sell their assets to the Russian government.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:56.120]  Hillary Clinton State Department was required to sign off on that deal, and they did. So literally, Hillary Clinton State Department gave about 20% of U.S. uranium assets in the United States to the Russian government.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.120]  Unbelievable.
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:02.120]  The Clinton Foundation got $145 million from the shareholders.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:25.120]  I remember seeing that at Breitbart, and then Congress talked about it some, but it wasn't even a big deal, though. None of the other media picks it up. Think about that, folks. A foreign power getting our strategic uranium supply, if that isn't treason, if that isn't sedition, if that isn't espionage, if that isn't just industrial-level espionage, I don't know what is.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:40.120]  Yeah, I mean, it's remarkable, and sort of the list goes on. I mean, you've got international fugitives. You've got a guy who was business partners with Mark Rich. You remember Mark Rich. He was the international fugitive that Bill Clinton pardoned on his last day in office.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:57.120]  Mark Rich, of course, his ex-wife gave a million dollars to the Clinton Foundation and the Democratic Party. Bill Clinton pardons him. Well, that business partner of Mark Rich, a guy named Mark Shagori, is a very corrupt individual who lives in Nigeria.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:14.120]  Now, he was convicted in 2000 of money laundering and aiding, abetting a criminal enterprise in Europe because he was helping the dictator of Nigeria literally smuggle billions of dollars out of the country and put them in Swiss bank accounts for his benefit.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:31.120]  This is a guy that the Clintons have embraced. He's pledged a billion dollars, that's with a B, to the Clinton Global Initiative. He's helped arrange speeches for Bill Clinton. He's given to the Clinton Foundation. In fact, when one of his sons got married, Bill Clinton showed up at the wedding.
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:44.120]  These are the kinds of people that are throwing cash at the Clintons and are getting favorable access and got favorable access while she was Secretary of State. They're not getting their money, Alex, from an insurance company in Great Britain.
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:57.120]  They're getting it from people who do mining deals with warlords in the Congo. They're doing it with people like Gilbert Shagori. They're doing it with individuals involved in this Russian uranium deal. These are bad corrupt individuals.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:01.120]  That's what people don't realize about the Clintons.
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:42.120]  This is just 100% dead on and could really, if the American people read about it, if journalists read about it and followed the leads in it that are confirmed, this could really put a dent in the corruption like the church committee hearings or others did in the 70s.
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:52.120]  I mean, there's got to be some point in the cycle where we just dial back corruption. Instead, there's this attitude that, oh, it's always going to be there. They always lie, go along with it.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:21:03.120]  Now, China says, you know, again, what movie is going to come out? I see Chinese government communist propaganda and like everything from the Martian to the new Red Dawn.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:18.120]  I see it in the news, the political correctness, the funding, the Chinese government financing where they keep energy prices high here, where they put the carbon restrictions in, ensuring our jobs go to China,
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:24.120]  China lobbying that carbon restrictions be put on India at the UN, and they are. Again, they're not just doing it to us.
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:34.120]  I mean, when Donald Trump says, man, we make bad deals, he's simplifying it. Our elites are literally like we're a boat with the engine going.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:42.120]  They've got a chain to the dock telling us they really want us to be able to go out on the lake. No, they've chained us up to the dock. It's time to take the chain off.
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:49.120]  It's just crazy. So let me ask you this. How do we stop this, sir? And where is it going from your deep research if we don't stop it?
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:22:00.120]  Because I've been on there 20 years. It seems like corruption's doubled in the magnitude since then, maybe tripled. Hey, how much worse has it gotten? How do we stop it? Where is it all going?
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:07.120]  Well, it's a great question, Alex. And you're right. Walter Jones is one of those guys on Capitol Hill who's really trying to fight these issues.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:14.120]  And there are good people. I get frustrated when people say there's nobody good up there. Nobody's fighting it. They're all corrupt.
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:22.120]  That's simply not true. And to me, that's a cop-out. And you're exactly right. There's an opportunity here we have to try to take our government back.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:31.120]  And here's what people need to know. There's an international organization called Transparency International that looks at corruption and perceives corruption.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:44.120]  They survey businessmen around the world and say, how corrupt are certain countries? When Barack Obama became president in 2009, the United States was in the middle of advanced industrialized countries and perceived corruption.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:53.120]  By 2012, at the end of his first term, we are now at the bottom. We are seen as the most corrupt of advanced industrialized countries in the world.
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:23:05.120]  That was as of 2012. And I'm sure it's gotten worse. And the problem is, as government gets bigger, as they take more of our money, but as they expand their power and their reach, whether it's our health care or something else,
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:12.120]  it gives them more opportunities to put the screws to us and to extract benefits and to extort money.
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:21.120]  So what do we need to do? Number one, we need to have transparency. People need to be informed and look at what their elected officials are doing.
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:27.120]  And we have to have a zero-tolerance policy, Alex. We can't say, well, he's our guy, so it's okay that he's doing it.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:31.120]  We have to have a zero-tolerance policy for self-enrichment and cronyism.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:39.120]  And number two, we have to fight any efforts to expand the size and scope of government, because that is the breeding ground for corruption.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:47.120]  If these guys don't have the power and the control over our lives, they are not going to have the levers with which they can enrich the world.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:54.120]  That's right. Dial back the regulations. What do you think of Governor Abbott's move to have a concon to try to block what's going on?
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:24:01.120]  I mean, I've never been a supporter of a concon because they could change the Constitution Bill of Rights, but they're already doing it by executive power.
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:11.120]  Congress isn't blocking it. The courts are certifying it, so it's a desperate move. But for the first time in my life, I mean, the House is already burning down.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.120]  What do you think?
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:21.120]  Well, it's a great question. I'm certainly not a constitutional historian, but what I would say is, look, the family fathers recognize that the states have a unique role,
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:32.120]  and the federal government has clearly gone well beyond the scope of what it was designed. And if it takes a convention, a convention of the states or a constitutional convention,
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:39.120]  to deal with that, that may be the only mechanism left. I do think there are people in Washington. We can elect better people in Washington.
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:49.120]  We can move the ball down the field. But ultimately, something needs to be done as far as the encroachment, because otherwise, we are simply going to see more self-enrichment and more wealth creation.
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:25:01.120]  Think about this for a second, Alex. Of the 10 wealthiest counties in the entire United States, the 10 wealthiest counties, seven of them, seven of them are counties that border Washington, D.C.
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:04.120]  And D.C. is the richest place in the world.
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:05.120]  That's right.
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:16.120]  They just passed Silicon Valley a couple years ago for per capita income. Per capita income is now higher in Washington, D.C. than it is in Silicon Valley in California.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:25.120]  If folks want to know the disconnect, I'm only in D.C. maybe once a year covering things. And even when you're not in the super nice areas or the nice areas, there's armored limos, diplomats,
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:35.120]  foreign secret service getting in your face, treating tourists and families like Crud. And then almost every restaurant I go in, there are the most beautiful women I've ever seen.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:46.120]  The cream of America literally getting in the limos with the politicians in the limos with the lobbyists. You know, the hookers are more ubiquitous than water fountains.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:59.120]  And the point is, it's just, it's like Rome. It's so decadent. And now at the University of Texas in Austin, they've had U.N. advisors there. And U.N. comes and investigates the governor and the border in New Mexico, Texas and Arizona.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:12.120]  And Breitbart broke months ago. I couldn't believe when I read it. I went to the U.N. documents. There it was. A strong cities initiative opening U.N. offices to watch our local governments and work with the feds.
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:22.120]  And you can really see the arrogant takeover. And now the U.N. wants to extend diplomatic immunity to hedge funds. You can see the new royalty is what I'm saying.
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:36.120]  An above the law group whose main business is shelling off American supremacy, shelling off American industry, making deals with other countries in interest to shut down sectors to transfer it to them.
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:44.120]  They've sold the country out and they are just in their own world knee-deep in hookers. I mean, I'm sorry, sir, but that's what I see.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:52.120]  Well, you know, Alex, here's a story that I think really captures it. A couple of years ago, I did a special for Fox News called Boomtown.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:27:00.120]  And it was on Washington, D.C. And in that special, we actually interviewed a guy who was a salesman for Ferrari of Washington, D.C.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:10.120]  And he told us on camera, Alex, that the people at headquarters of Ferrari were kind of frustrated with Ferrari of Washington, D.C.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:19.120]  And we said, well, why is that? Is it because you're not selling enough cars? And he said, no, it's because Ferrari in Beverly Hills, California and Ferrari in South Beach, Florida,
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:25.120]  when people come in to buy Ferraris, they're financing their purchases. And the headquarters wants that.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:36.120]  In Ferrari of Washington, D.C., too many people are paying cash. So we have a situation where Ferrari actually sells more cars in Washington, D.C.
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:42.120]  than they do in Beverly Hills or South Beach. And people are paying cash. They're not even bothering to finance their deals.
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:46.120]  That tells you how out of control the self-enrichment and the corruption.
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:56.120]  And they're doing it at the expense of the country's whole future. I mean, even smart crooks should care about their kids and only skim enough to not collapse the society.
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:28:03.120]  And of course, I'm against corruption completely. But it just seems like they're killing the golden goose right in front of us.
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:13.120]  That's exactly right. If you view government and government extracting money from the country as kind of like a parasite, just think of an animal.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:20.120]  At some point, the parasite becomes so big that the animal loses its health and eventually loses its life.
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:27.120]  And if you look through the history of great civilizations of the past, whether it's the Roman Empire, whether it's the Spanish Empire,
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:38.120]  you have these situations where the capital or, for example, in France, Versailles, the capital or the seat of power becomes so corrupt, so self-enriched
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:46.120]  at the expense of the rest of the country, the civilization just collapses. I believe we have time to turn things around.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:51.120]  I think we have times to improve the future of our country, but the trend lines right now are not good.
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:57.120]  And what I encourage people to do is not just simply give up and say nothing can happen.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:03.120]  There is something that can happen, and that is that people can rise up. They can vote for people who are going to do the right thing.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:11.120]  They can make their views be heard, make corruption a central issue. Don't just speak to your elected officials about what you want or what you don't want.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:14.120]  Talk to them about corruption and dealing with it.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:37.120]  Peter Schweizer, thank you. Breitbart.com, g-a-i.org. Folks, get involved. Get this out to your local talk show hosts and others. Tell them to interview Peter and to get the word out and get the book extortion.
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:46.120]  Folks, we'll be back with tons of news, a special video clip, and the whole X-Files show to be based around Info Wars, basically. We've got the trailer.
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:17.120]  Once again, for Political Science Theater 3K. The stage will be getting smaller with only six candidates making the cut. Maybe seven if they let John Kasich slip in through the back door.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:23.120]  Coverage starts at 7 p.m. central on the Info Wars Nightly News, and then the debate kicks off at 8 p.m. central.
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:26.120]  Join us for analysis that cuts through the lies in real time.
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:32.120]  When's the next Democratic debate, you ask? Well, it's on a Sunday during the NFL playoffs, because that's when most people want to watch it.
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:39.120]  It does not appear that Rand Paul is going to make the cut in this primetime debate, but John Kasich is? What is this world coming to?
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:46.120]  Just a little side note here. The majority of Americans polled think that Hillary Clinton should continue to run if she is indicted under this new email scandal.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:51.120]  Join us this Thursday, 7 p.m. central for Political Science Theater 3K.
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:55.120]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:31:10.120]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in. No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:18.120]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies. You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:28.120]  We now have the synergistic solution. Secure your DNA force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:36.120]  Brain force is here. Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months. You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of brain force.
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:43.120]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives. Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:49.120]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree. It doesn't have stimulus. It doesn't have garbage in it. It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:32:15.120]  You will find brain force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:24.120]  It's a platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system to shut down.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:31.120]  PrisonPlanet.tv, we put out the daily radio show free with a video and audio feed at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:45.120]  But it is the members that are paying it forward and helping so many other people see the truth and it's PrisonPlanet.tv that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew, the reporters.
[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:51.120]  You get exclusive HD, higher quality, get it first and then you can download it, share it with friends and family.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:55.120]  It's a win-win and then you're helping finance to put it out for free to everybody.
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:59.120]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:17.120]  We have gangsters running this country. Criminals gangsters.
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:21.120]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose.
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:26.120]  We have a fog that is descended on our entire nation.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:29.120]  The globalists are going to blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:31.120]  Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:36.120]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to unfold in triplicate spades.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:38.120]  This is real as a gift.
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:41.120]  They had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:43.120]  I said, man, it's over for you.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:46.120]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law. You're out of there.
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:56.120]  You want it, baby? You're about to get it.
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:04.120]  We just meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve teeth, be tolerant and see how many guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:09.120]  We met them at Concord Bridge and we blew their punk-ass brains out.
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:20.120]  Info Wars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation, blow the criminal cover of operatives more than any other institution out there of freedom.
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:22.120]  And I'm so proud of that.
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:25.120]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women.
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:30.120]  No, Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:38.120]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that,
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:40.120]  you're shining on to the other side.
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:43.120]  These people are of the devil.
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.120]  Let's be very blunt about this.
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:48.120]  Raise hell and demand accountability.
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:56.120]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate criminal government in American history.
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:02.120]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:09.120]  The police have been telling everybody they're going to shoot if we don't move back.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:15.120]  Their defeat will be ultimately a crushing one.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:18.120]  Another amazing intro that Darren McBreen put together.
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:21.120]  In a few minutes, I'm going to play the new X-Files trailer.
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.120]  They're bringing the super hit TV show.
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:26.120]  Some X-Files had 50 million viewers a night.
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.120]  The Super Bowl 70 million.
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:35.120]  One of the most popular TV shows in world history, syndicated around the world, reaching billions of people.
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:37.120]  The show made billions of dollars.
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:44.120]  The new X-Files to be based in great part around a character based on Alex Jones.
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:51.120]  And Chris Carter says a bunch of positive things about the worldview.
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:54.120]  And that he does think a world government takeover is a real threat.
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:58.120]  And that it's going to be pretty much a positive perspective a lot of time.
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:00.120]  But with one of the characters disagreeing.
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:03.120]  The fact that they ring so honest about it is a big hat tip.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.120]  Normally they don't.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.120]  Whether they're negative or positive with one of these characters.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:11.120]  They have movies where the child molester killers named Alex Jones.
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:14.120]  And they have other movies where they say, I hate black people and hate Jews.
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:15.120]  And say the n-word.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:18.120]  And then they say, I learned it from Alex Jones.
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:21.120]  They were like, let's not exaggerate.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:24.120]  Ten movies or more the last few years doing that.
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:27.120]  And a lot of it's subliminal now too.
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:29.120]  There's a lot more than ten of you count those.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:33.120]  It'll just say some horrible thing real fast on screen with Alex Jones.
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:36.120]  For a tenth of a second.
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:38.120]  Or a second or five seconds.
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:40.120]  Sometimes it's not subliminal, but it's so quick.
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:43.120]  It's near subliminal because people are in suspended disbelief.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:46.120]  You know, sitting around drinking beer and they just kind of pick up that idea
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:50.120]  as they try to inoculate people psychologically against info wars.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:53.120]  And then I'm going to get into integrated Muslim migrants.
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:54.120]  Germans are disgusting.
[01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:55.120]  They should all disappear.
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:58.120]  We're going to get into great depression 2.0.
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:01.120]  Sell everything 2016 cataclysmic year for stocks.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:03.120]  That's what the big insiders are saying.
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:07.120]  The Kit Daniels has a big boil down article that's red linked on info wars.com.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:13.120]  But first, speaking of depression, info wars absolutely excels.
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:21.120]  My reporters, our writers, our investigative journalists, our crew, myself at going viral.
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:23.120]  We are exponentially growing.
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:28.120]  Our audiences are explosive, but we do not focus or target around making money.
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:31.120]  Most of the money you hear about is the network ads that pays for the network.
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:34.120]  Radio network, come on.
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:37.120]  But that said, I didn't plug any last hour.
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:38.120]  I skipped a break this hour.
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:39.120]  I must stop doing it.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:45.120]  And I must plug twice an hour to finance our operation.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:51.120]  We carry the very best products that we can get, which are the best, whether it's
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:56.120]  nutraceuticals, whether it's shower filters, whether it's water filters, drinking water filters,
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:03.120]  whether it's non GMO, heirloom seeds, books, videos, liberty based apparel to spread the word
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.120]  and meet like minded people.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:11.120]  You have a commitment that this is the very best we can bring you and the money is financing
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:17.120]  a hard core operation that's having huge impact and huge effect.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:22.120]  We are under massive media demonization campaigns and attack.
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:29.120]  We are under constant barrage of all sorts of dirty tricks is the best word for it.
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.120]  And I'm not going to get into it because that goes with the territory.
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.120]  And I'm not here to whine about stuff.
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.120]  I expect it.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:39.120]  I'm a soldier in Info War promoting human liberty and freedom in the future for our species.
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:41.120]  I expect anything and everything.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:43.120]  I'm not crying to mama.
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:46.120]  And I'm not going to blame God if bad stuff happens to me.
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:51.120]  And because a lot of people on the inside see what we're doing, they're touched by our will,
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:56.120]  by our courage, and other people's will and courage, and they're deciding to join us.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:59.120]  So don't just expect everybody in mainstream media to be the enemy.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:04.120]  When stuff starts getting really bad, people you think are your friends may turn on you.
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:09.120]  People you think are your friends may be even better friends.
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:13.120]  But people that you think are your enemy or who have been your enemy will come over
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:19.120]  because they'll have that shawl of Tarsus on the road to Damascus moment.
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:23.120]  And we've all had those moments in certain parts of our lives.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:32.120]  I think about some of the things I said, some of the things I did 10, 15 years ago, and I'm embarrassed of it.
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.120]  But my intention was true.
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:37.120]  My heart was right, and that's what matters.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:41.120]  But I'm telling you, it's not just Hollywood that's awake.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:45.120]  It's not just a lot of mainstream media that's awake but are on a short leash.
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:52.120]  Not just the police, not just the military, it's the general public, and it's exponential.
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:58.120]  I went to a movie theater last night to see The Revenant, which is an excellent film.
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:01.120]  We'll talk about it a little bit later in the next hour or five time.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:07.120]  And there was a little restaurant there at this boutique theater downtown, and there were probably 30, 40 people in there.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:14.120]  We went in to just order a little bit of dinner and sit for about 30 months before the movie started, just a snack.
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:21.120]  Every person in there was pointing and staring, going, there's Alex Jones, and women were waving at me and smiling and saying, I love the show.
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:25.120]  And these were young, you know, good-looking, trendy people.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:31.120]  And you know when you've got them waking up, you are really accelerating towards victory.
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:37.120]  Now, that said, the globalists are in trouble.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:43.120]  And so they're going to strike back, and false flags, demonization campaigns, God knows what.
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:45.120]  And it won't be against Alex Jones so much.
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:47.120]  They'll build straw men and attack myself.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:49.120]  They'll lie about drudge.
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:57.120]  They have perennial dirty tricks like, you go to M4 Wars or Drudge Report, it gives you a virus, and it's not true.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:01.120]  But you link through to some CNN story in one case, and then it's got a virus.
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:03.120]  But links aren't the virus.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:10.120]  See, they play these games, or they'll have different software you get, you know, that's nanny safe or whatever they call it.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:14.120]  Municipal computers, military computer networks, you name it.
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:16.120]  Oh, you can't go to M4 Wars.
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:22.120]  They started doing that about 15 years ago, and all it did was make the whole military want to go check out M4 Wars.
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:24.120]  Sometimes you've got to worry about the psychology.
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:28.120]  I remember like 18 years ago, I made a film about the Marines training to take guns under Clinton.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:35.120]  It wasn't anti-marines, it was just anti-martial law, and it made your bases like Pendleton and others.
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:42.120]  As it came out in the news, they would say, there's a film, Police State 2000 circulating by Alex Jones.
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:46.120]  You will be given PT, you will be run, you may even be written up.
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:51.120]  If we catch you with this film, do not watch it.
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:59.120]  In another case, another Marine Corp base, it was the, whatever the head sergeant is, and I forget in that case,
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:05.120]  says, I've been ordered to tell you this, and I've been ordered to tell you not to watch it, but I'm leaving it right here.
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:07.120]  Have a good weekend.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:15.120]  I was told that by a Marine who was the son of the head sales manager who had come into town.
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:20.120]  He only been in the Marines like a year, and he's like, your show's on here, I don't know who you are,
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:27.120]  but they said we're not allowed to watch you, but then, you know, my sergeant left the DVD for us, and we all watched it.
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:32.120]  He was just a young kid, like 19 or whatever he was.
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:39.120]  So again, what I'm getting at here is the globalists don't have all the power.
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:41.120]  They're not invincible.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:44.120]  They can be stopped, but you have to believe that you have strength.
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:46.120]  You have to get involved.
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:49.120]  And again, as I was saying, I can't even plug when I try to.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:56.120]  We have a lot of great products, and we need to sell a lot of them to fund reporters and crew and servers.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:02.120]  We have one of the biggest, least expensive, best video, audio server companies.
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:04.120]  We have a backup one as well.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:09.120]  Usually the bandwidth builds about $50,000 a month.
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:16.120]  It's $50,000, $56,000 last month, just for the video stream we put out for free.
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:23.120]  And the accountant came in and said, you're losing money in the last month from about the 16th till now.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:26.120]  You need to stop skipping breaks and you need to start plugging.
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:27.120]  And I looked at the numbers.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.120]  I'm just telling you what's going on around here.
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:31.120]  I'm so wild, folks.
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:35.120]  I cut breaks out every day that I make money on.
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:37.120]  I just can't stand it. I can't help it.
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:42.120]  So I just want to be on air fighting these people, but I do need your support.
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:48.120]  When you support GC and the network, that's also good as well, because we haven't gone bankrupt like two or three of the other big networks,
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:53.120]  while others are getting ready to go bankrupt, or basically bankrupt already, that's a bit of the news,
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:56.120]  because we're in a depression and it's getting worse.
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:58.120]  And I've got news on that I'm going to get to in a moment.
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.120]  So we need your support, especially middle class and wealthy people.
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:05.120]  It's always little widows or poor people that are saying, oh, I bought a bottle of X tubes.
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.120]  I want to support you.
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:12.120]  Buy it because you got money and it's so good for your health and it's such a game changer.
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:15.120]  Buy the oxy powder because it's so good to flush out your guts.
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:23.120]  Buy a Hillary for President t-shirt. I mean, I love how many wealthy people sit on their hands like they're smart because they're on the sidelines.
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:27.120]  But then I've run to billionaires that go, I might want to help you out with some money.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:28.120]  I just don't really ask for it.
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:30.120]  So I'm going to go down that road, but I might down the road.
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:32.120]  It might be might be easier.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:39.120]  The point is we need you to buy the products at infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, and we have a bunch of them right now.

[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:26.120]  And lastly, and then I'm going to shift gears into all the news.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:30.120]  Ropeure is an amazing company that we've been carrying for four years.
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:38.120]  I didn't carry water filtration for a couple of years because I couldn't find really good gravity fed filters.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:42.120]  That we're actually up to the specs and that our listeners want it.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:50.120]  Now we carry what four different companies and there's the Alexa pure pro is just incredible faster flow rate really amazing.
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:53.120]  We have those in infowarsstore.com.
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:46:01.120]  But pro pure has come out with the best the specs are up on the site shower filter I've ever seen.
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:11.120]  This actually knocks out the fluoride the glyphosates 99% 98% I mean no filter out there doesn't 100% of it's almost impossible.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:16.120]  Others just barely reduced it some of the bad smell some of the bad taste that's still a big deal.
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:21.120]  This filter massively cuts it out removes a lot of stuff completely.
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:29.120]  The all new pro max four stage shower filter by pro pure is now available exclusively at infowarsstore.com in a limited first run.
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:39.120]  Development for years and testing it pro max reduces and removes over 200 contaminants from shower water including heavy metals VOCs pesticides fluoride chlorine pharmaceuticals and odors.
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:47.120]  Pro max is made from BPA free plastic is easy to install you screw it on and has a filtration capacity of up to nine months.
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:52.120]  We looked at hundreds of different shower filters and this is the best we could find for the lowest price as well.
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:47:00.120]  Visit infowarsstore.com and get the new pro max shower filter before a limited first run cells out we are so proud of it.
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:11.120]  And in closing here's the biggest point about the all new pro pure pro max four stage filter it's four stages.
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:18.120]  And it's fast flow because I've had other ones before where you know you don't want your kids breathing all this absorbing it.
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:22.120]  And then it's a terrible shower and you catch them taking a bath because it fills up faster.
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:26.120]  And you're like hey you know don't do that around the shower till it fills up I don't want to wait 20 minutes.
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:33.120]  I get it these babies just came in last week they're going in my house tonight.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:39.120]  I don't like oh when they brought in I said oh I forgot we've had that warehouse for a week why aren't I plugging it so it just went up in the shopping cart yesterday.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:51.120]  The pro pure pro max available it really is amazing it's $69.95 for nine months because I mean one big place you get is drinking it obviously.
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:56.120]  But folks absorbing it and breathing it is just as bad infowarsstore.com.
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:48:03.120]  Okay I'm done plugging I'm done talking about that kind of condensed not doing three four plugs last hour and a half into that one.
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:13.120]  Please support our local affiliates as well please become a local sponsor as well of those stations and please keep spreading the word about the transmission that's how we're really having the biggest effect.
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:24.120]  Now I'm not going to talk about this anymore I already spoke about it but here is the new X Files trailer of the hit show that's been gone for a decade.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:35.120]  And it's coming back roaring back and the creator of the X Files Chris Carter says that you can read it in the article of entertainment weekly on Alex Jones character.
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:43.120]  And he goes on to basically they're going to talk about how they are concerned quote the UN takeover threat however is something Carter suggests is credible.
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:47.120]  The idea of a new world order is relevant.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:55.120]  Carter says when we suggested the show is embracing right wing theories Carter counters it's not necessarily that I don't see Alex Jones is right wing I seem as libertarian.
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:49:06.120]  And the characters you know based around that it goes through it all and drudge has the headline up on drudgereport.com that they are now basically becoming Alex Jones.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:12.120]  Let me give you the exact quote here so I don't get that wrong Fox X Files goes Alex Jones.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:25.120]  But then after the break we're going to really serious news and that's what's happening with the economy so stay with us but here's the new X Files trailer to premiere on Fox.
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:29.120]  It'll probably start on a Friday.
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:32.120]  Well we'll seem like an attack on America.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:35.120]  By terrorists or Russia.
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:46.120]  Driven by a well oiled well armed and multinational group of elites using alien technology that governments have been hiding for 70 years.
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:52.120]  Like yourself I'm a true believer.
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:57.120]  What I need is your expertise.
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:03.120]  You said if I ever put the pieces together that you would confirm and have you.
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:05.120]  I've seen something.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.120]  You're nearly there.
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.120]  You're close.
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:13.120]  I can't do this alone.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:21.120]  Yeah.
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:26.120]  I'm here.
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:34.120]  They police us and spy on us. Tell us that makes us safer.
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:39.120]  Never been in more danger and do something about it.
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.120]  I have seen this before.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:46.120]  You're on fire believing that you're on to some truth that you can save the world.
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:47.120]  This is my life.
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:53.120]  This is everything I believe in.
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:56.120]  You are on dangerous ground here.
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:58.120]  I know what I'm doing.
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:11.120]  We have a small problem.
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:19.120]  So there you go, folks.
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:21.120]  Very, very interesting.
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:26.120]  And the reason the establishment allows this is they can't hide it anymore.
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:29.120]  They have to have revelation of the method and it'll just be made entertainment.
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:31.120]  And because people are awake, they'll watch it.
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:33.120]  It'll be successful.
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:37.120]  And it shows how successful we've been, but this is now how the system counters.
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:41.120]  And I don't think Chris Carter is part of it because I was visited by Dean Haglin.
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:42.120]  We did the interview.
[01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:43.120]  He said a lot.
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:46.120]  He said even more outside of the interview.
[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:57.120]  Of course, he was in the X files and the lone gunman that Carter and others were approached by the CIA and given scripts, things they wanted in the script.
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:05.120]  Like the episode of the lone gunman six months before 9 11 that aired on Fox for the criminal group in the government.
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:08.120]  Hijacks a jumbo jet by remote control.
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:15.120]  A passenger plane claims it's been hijacked by Al Qaeda and flies it into the world's trade center or tries to to blame it on Afghanistan.
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:20.120]  Kick off a giant war and bring tyranny to the rest of the West.
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:24.120]  Now, why was the CIA group warning?
[01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:26.120]  So that being a script.
[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:29.120]  So when it happened, people would know it was an inside job.
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:33.120]  That's one thing I was told a few years ago by a big producer, famous producer.
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:37.120]  He goes, Alex, you don't know how many good people there are in Hollywood that sneak stuff through.
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:41.120]  You were all saying that was them revelation of the method throwing it in people's faces.
[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:47.120]  No, things like that are put in there because no one at the TV level is paying attention to a conspiracy show.
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:53.120]  Even if it's popular and then it can come out and people are leaving breadcrumbs so you know it was staged.
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:55.120]  And I said, Oh, is that what you were told?
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:57.120]  He goes, No, that's my view.
[01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:59.120]  But that's how a lot of this is done.
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:02.120]  People leave clues when they're not able.
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:07.120]  You know, prisoners trying to sneak each other notes.
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:11.120]  But regardless, they're going to mix aliens into it.
[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:18.120]  But they deal with chemtrails, geoengineering, world government, carbon taxes and plantable microchips.
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:20.120]  And I want to say something right now.
[01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:23.120]  It is alien technology.
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:31.120]  Some newspapers, left wing groups, Soros connected organizations came out and said Alex Jones believes in aliens
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:33.120]  and thinks aliens run the conspiracy.
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:35.120]  No.
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:38.120]  I purposely never got into aliens.
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:45.120]  Was balls Aldrin's on talking about it because I don't want to be put into the stuff you can't prove one way or another.
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:47.120]  I can prove the emergency centers.
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:48.120]  I can prove the checkpoints.
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:51.120]  I can prove the plan to sign us on the derivatives and bankrupt us.
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:55.120]  I can prove the open borders and people still aren't denial about that.
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:54:03.120]  What I said is with these new genetically engineered Chimeras.
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:08.120]  That are part human part animal that were in MIT magazine yesterday.
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:10.120]  That they admit they've been doing for decades.
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:13.120]  They've created new creatures that are alien to this world.
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:20.120]  There's never been a splice between an insect and a human or an or an insect or an arachnid and a goat.
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:29.120]  Or a jellyfish and a Reese's monkey. The zoological viruses and bacteria and micro plasms that mutate out of this are incredibly dangerous.
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:35.120]  There's the headline human animal Chimeras are gestating on US research farms.
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:41.120]  Then they harvest the organs out of the humanoids they grow that are part animal so they're not rejected.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:46.120]  This has been going on for 30 years they admit but now they're rolling it out.
[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:53.120]  And I said the elite believe they're a new species of inbred psychopaths who are going to merge with machines and become a new species.
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:58.120]  Google, Ray Kurzweil, Bill Joy, all of them. Some good some bad.
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:04.120]  That's an attempt to build a breakaway civilization and what humans envision they've usually done.
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:08.120]  They're making aliens.
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:14.120]  AI computers that are truly artificially intelligent and conscious will be a new species on this planet.
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:18.120]  It will be alien. Not of this world.
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:22.120]  Do you understand what that means media matters and right wing watch in the White House?
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:24.120]  Of course you do.
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:28.120]  And you think if you go along with it all you're going to be given the life extension technology.
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:33.120]  Talk about discrimination. Talk about jerks. I don't want to fight with black people.
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:40.120]  And women I want the life extension for everybody. The population gets too big off world colonies.
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:46.120]  I want the technology. I want the medicine. I want the innovations. I want them now.
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:50.120]  Humans developed it. Our ancestors built it. It doesn't belong to you.
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:55.120]  You got us fighting over the word mom and dad while you're stealing the whole future from us.
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:57.120]  You piece of crap.
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:00.120]  Excuse me. Excuse me.
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:05.120]  I get so frustrated by the idiots out there that have been taught to fight over mindless crud.
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:09.120]  And the jihadis running around.
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:15.120]  When they're done radicalizing the Muslims and getting them to run around and burn down half of Europe
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:19.120]  they're going to release a really specific bio weapon to wipe out almost every Arab on earth.
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:21.120]  And I'm not for that by the way.
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:24.120]  Even though they're trying to hype them up to be my enemy.
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:28.120]  Because I see the whole game. And if you don't know about that look at the PNAC document.
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:33.120]  2000 Dick Cheney talks about the legitimizing the use of race specific bio weapons.
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:38.120]  The Austin American statesman reported on it.
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:41.120]  I can see the whole plan from start to finish.
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:44.120]  Because it's a well worked plan. I've been studying it.
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:47.120]  I've read their white papers. It's pretty much public.
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:51.120]  They just don't say the last one half of one percent.
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:53.120]  But then they even say that.
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:56.120]  They've told us the whole battle plan.
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:57:04.120]  They've told their elites that it is a cosmology and yes for all intents and purposes their aliens.
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:07.120]  They didn't come from a distant star.
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:11.120]  They are a guild of twisted humans of every race color and creed.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:17.120]  Bound by hatred of humanity and greed and hate wanting everything for themselves.
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:21.120]  They are the enemy.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:24.120]  They're not fans of humanity. They don't like you doing well.
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:27.120]  They want you out of their way. They want to steal the future.
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:31.120]  They want to steal the brain trust. They want to become gods.
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:36.120]  They must be stopped.
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:40.120]  We are living in a science fiction movie ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:43.120]  You're here. It's 2016. It's going on.
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:47.120]  Robots that replace humans in combat, manufacturing, everything.
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:51.120]  And the first waves are all friendly and nice to get you to buy into it.
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:53.120]  It's admitted they're doing that.
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:58.120]  Deeper into this you will lose your humanity.
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:02.120]  And so many people are serving this because they're cowardly.
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:05.120]  They're scared and they think if they go along with it they're going to be okay.
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:10.120]  No. This road ends in rack and ruin.
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:15.120]  All right. When we return, Great Depression 2.0 sell everything.
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:20.120]  2016 had a glissom year for stocks. My review of the Revenant.
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:25.120]  It's history. I want to get into it. Larry Pratt joins us for 30 minutes to break down
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:29.120]  the biggest assault on the Second Amendment since before it was born.
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:33.120]  The biggest attempt to take our guns since Lexington and Concord.
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:37.120]  It's all coming up in hour number three.
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:59:02.120]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.

[01:59:51.120 --> 02:00:02.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:13.120]  Coming up, Bernie Sanders gets endorsement from Soros.
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:37.120]  That really shows Hillary is in deep manure, produced by her, of course.
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:44.120]  Back of America admits that rail traffic's the lowest it's been in eight years.
[02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:47.120]  That's a main indicator of what's really happening in America.
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:50.120]  I haven't gotten to the clips of the radical Muslims, what they're up to,
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:54.120]  and then clips of the supposed liberal Muslims saying Germans are disgusting and bad
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:01:00.120]  and want them to disappear. See, the left teaches most minorities, by the way, rejected,
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:07.120]  by who, the majority. But for some reason the radical Muslims have already been told to hate the West,
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:13.120]  even though the West is, at least the people of the West have done nothing to them.
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:16.120]  And then the governments that have actually attacked their countries, they're teamed up with them.
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:18.120]  It's simply amazing that's coming up.
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:22.120]  But I wanted to get into this article ahead of Larry Pratt coming on at 8 after,
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:30.120]  he's gone on the rest of America. Great Depression 2.0, sell everything, 2016,
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:35.120]  cataclysmic year for stocks, warrants RBS.
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:41.120]  Saudis freak out over collapsing oil price while Chinese economy, no different than Ponzi scheme.
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:49.120]  And yes, Saudi Arabia and OPEC have kept prices low to bankrupt U.S. shale oil fracking production.
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:52.120]  And also the West went along with that, some of the elites to bankrupt Russia,
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:56.120]  but now even Saudi Arabia is in trouble.
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:02:03.120]  The Royal Bank of Scotland warned its clients to sell everything and exit the stock market as soon as possible.
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:13.120]  That's like Rothschild in 1815, you know, saying sell everything and then five hours later buying everything.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:15.120]  Wow, what an incredible statement.
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:20.120]  Anyway, that's up on DrudgeReport.com, infowars.com, mainstream newspapers are quoting this.
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:24.120]  I know it's an infowars story and people trust that, but understand this is in mainstream newspapers now.
[02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:26.120]  The general public is reading this.
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:29.120]  Sell everything, it almost makes me not want to sell anything.
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:33.120]  I don't own any stocks, but if they're saying sell it, maybe you shouldn't.
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:35.120]  That's liars, but no, no.
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:38.120]  When they get to this point, you know, they want to act like they warned you.
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:44.120]  So, oh, give them a bullet surprise, they warned a month before the total collapse that it was going to happen.
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:49.120]  But those evil conspiracy theorists told you exactly how it happened 10 years ago.
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:53.120]  Sell everything except high quality bonds warned Andrew Roberts.
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:56.120]  Well, that's exactly what Mr. Dent said here last Friday.
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:03:03.120]  The bank's research chief for European economies and rates, we think investors should be afraid.
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:05.120]  Yeah, no kidding.
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:09.120]  He said the collapsing price of oil, the impending destruction of the Chinese markets,
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:17.120]  and the ever-exploding debts all within the first week of January were significant red flags revealing the cataclysmic gear ahead.
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:24.120]  I should have just led the show with all this, but again, it's that sick blind spot I've got, and I really apologize.
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:32.120]  Niko, as producer, I know I ask you to help me when I get off track because there really is no program director here.
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:42.120]  But I am out of control. I mean, we've known this engineer collapse is coming for so long that now that the wave is 100 yards away,
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:46.120]  not 100 miles away when we first told everybody about it, I'm not even covering it.
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:53.120]  And that's a real blind spot I've got, is that we just get here for so long, way ahead of time,
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:59.120]  that when the public comes out and announces world government, global carbon taxes, microchips to buy and sell,
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:03.120]  I just go, oh yeah, Margaret The Beast told you about that.
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:12.120]  And again, I'm not bragging that we told you about it so long ago, but notice you don't hear Christian churches and people saying diddly squat about this.
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:20.120]  They all think they're going to get teleported up to the USS Enterprise and that Scotty's up there and Captain Kirk and Spock,
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:28.120]  you know, and it's all just going to be, you know, rainbows and colors and everything's going to be happy, happy, you know, lucky, and that ain't it.
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:34.120]  And so what's going to happen is when the elite bring in this biblical system,
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:41.120]  whether you believe that Revelations is prophetic or the elite are using it as a blueprint because it's great literature from that perspective,
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:50.120]  they're going to bow to the world leader of the Antichrist and do everything he says because it couldn't be the Antichrist because they're supposed to be teleported out of here.
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:55.120]  I mean, you talk about mind control, this rapture stuff didn't get taught till 200 years ago.
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:58.120]  I mean, there is no teleportation device.
[02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:06.120]  The latest Gallup poll finds loyalty to Democrats and Republicans is at or near historic lows, reports US News.
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:13.120]  In 2015, for the fifth straight year, at least four in 10 US adults identified as political independence.
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:16.120]  42% said that they were independent last year.
[02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:21.120]  43% listed themselves that way in 2014, reflecting little change.
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:26.120]  29% said that they were Republicans and 26% said that they were Democrats.
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:32.120]  The Democrats share was the lowest for the party in the Gallup 65 years of asking about party identification.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:36.120]  The previous Democratic low was 30% in 2014.
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:47.120]  The 26% who identified with the GOP was just one percentage point higher than the historic Gallup low of 25% self-identified Republicans in 2013.
[02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:53.120]  Gallup found the big reason for the increase in independence was frustration with political gridlock.

[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:49.120]  that states, civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state and therefore must be abridged and abolished.
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:52.120]  I've memorized what it says.
[02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:59.120]  Obama gets up there, they sign the treaty, he says, nobody wants your guns, but the cities they run, they've taken all the guns.
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:08.120]  And they've really had that collapse in confidence moment when Obama gets up in his press conference, then on CNN, and says, nobody wants your guns.
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:12.120]  When everybody who's got a brain knows they're coming for our guns.
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:22.120]  The problem is they're doing it outside of law, executive order itself is a major issue, and he's doing it with so many other issues as well.
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:32.120]  Now, Newsweek, The Daily Beast, other publications, CNN come out with stories saying, let's just ban guns.
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:38.120]  Let's just have a civil emergency, close quote, that was last week, and just take them.
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:42.120]  And then other articles say, well, that'll start a civil war, and they're like, good.
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:48.120]  He'll be the new Lincoln, let's just, I mean, folks, these people are power mad, and it doesn't mean they're going to do it.
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:53.120]  Doesn't mean they'd get away with it, but they're certainly looking at it, and they got Obamacare in.
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:10:00.120]  They've got the borders open outside of law with Obama bringing the illegals in, completing the smuggling process.
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:09.120]  We've been winning the war for the Second Amendment, but the Empire's about to strike back, and we've got the top general in the fight for the Second Amendment,
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:16.120]  Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America, gunowners.org, the group that really has helped reform the NRA,
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:22.120]  the time of the brain of the NRA, and we've even had, again, one of the NRA board members on Ted Nuget to say that.
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:27.120]  I mean, I said years ago, I said, don't you agree that Gun Owners of America has helped really reform the NRA,
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:32.120]  get it to be more hardcore, and thank God for the GOA, and he said absolutely, Larry Pratt's the best without him.
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:35.120]  We couldn't have done all this, and he doesn't want the credit, he's very mild manner.
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:39.120]  He's not alarmist, though, Paul Revere was, I'm not knocking for that.
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:45.120]  He's very gentlemanly, and I guess I could be the young wild man, but I got to say this has got me a little bit hysterical.
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:48.120]  I mean, this is more brazen than I thought it would be.
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:54.120]  Doctors have immunity to say you're nuts and take your guns, put you on no fly list and no buy list.
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:57.120]  He's the expert to the bottom of the hour, just two short segments.
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:01.120]  Then I'll get into all the other news, what's happening, the economy that's so important, and more.
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:08.120]  But with top economists in the financial times of London and others coming out and saying, you know,
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:15.120]  shell everything, total panic, Royal Bank of Scotland says, shell everything, total panic, great depression is coming.
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:20.120]  We had Harry Denon last week, he said the same thing, former top bane strategist.
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:24.120]  I mean, I'm not saying that's common, they're saying it.
[02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:28.120]  And so we need our guns during any type of craziness like this.
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:33.120]  Now, I hope it's not as bad as they're saying, but I tell you, I can feel it in my gut, I've been saying it for six months.
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:38.120]  Big stuff is afoot, Obama's crazy enough to be funding Al Qaeda.
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:41.120]  And I just think God, Donald Trump's come out and expose that.
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:48.120]  Larry Prett, I tell you, there is not a dole, you know, mind in the house.
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:55.120]  I mean, is this not one of the most epic times you've ever seen in the battle for liberty, where we're so strong, they're so strong.
[02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:57.120]  So much is happening on a daily basis.
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:02.120]  Am I wrong in saying, in my 21 years, this is the craziest ever.
[02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:08.120]  In your 50 years, for 45 years of fighting tyranny, is this the craziest you've ever seen, Larry Prett?
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:10.120]  It almost certainly is.
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:15.120]  I'd have to really think hard to think what was further over the top.
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:22.120]  And we're dealing with a guy who, from birth, was brought up as a communist.
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:29.120]  Barack Obama's mama, his teachers at Columbia, Harvard.
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:42.120]  This guy, and then, of course, somehow he ends up going from the east over to Chicago, which is really left-wing central of the United States, as far as I can tell.
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:47.120]  Every single left-wing group has a foundation, a think tank.
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:13:02.120]  Financier's Valerie Jarrett, his number one advisor, comes from a family that's buku-wealthy from their crony capitalism, and they hail from Chicago.
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:07.120]  So it shows that they're not necessarily anti-business.
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:09.120]  They're just anti-free enterprise.
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:14.120]  And along comes us unwashed, and Obama doesn't like it.
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:21.120]  And my guess is that in his last year, we're going to see what we've called the full Obama.
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:25.120]  He doesn't have any more elections to deal with for himself.
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:29.120]  His party doesn't really have to carry his baggage so much anymore.
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:35.120]  So he's going to go in for the full socialist monty.
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:38.120]  He's going for it all.
[02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:39.120]  That's what I've been saying.
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:40.120]  This is it, boys.
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:44.120]  If folks want to be involved in the battle for the republic, it's so historic.
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:54.120]  And it's such an honor to be alive now with people like yourself and others working with fellow patriots to preserve liberty and to try to live up to at least a shadow of our founders.
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:58.120]  What would our founders think about what's happening currently, sir?
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:03.120]  Well, Paul Revere probably would have been writing before now.
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:15.120]  They had a tax that I've forgotten the numbers, but I think it was possibly threatening to go above 5% of their GNP or GDP.
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:20.120]  And, of course, for us, that's hardly a month.
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:28.120]  So we've gotten used to so much tyranny that you wonder kind of what our flashpoint might be.
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:33.120]  It looks as if, though, maybe Mr. Obama has found it.
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:36.120]  He has continually poked us in the eye.
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:40.120]  And I think he's finally made a bunch of folks mad.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:57.120]  And one of the canaries in the mine shaft that I would suggest that we look at is the loss of Eric Cantor in the last election cycle to a college professor, David Bratt, taking down the number two Republican in the House of Representatives.
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:13.120]  People got to be really fed up, especially among Republicans, to go after one of the most influential Republicans in the city of Washington, their guy, if you will, and they went and took him out.
[02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:16.120]  You got to be pretty mad to do something like that.
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:20.120]  No more Benny is going to come from Eric Cantor to that district.
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:23.120]  All of that has been cut off.
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:29.120]  Looking at his executive order, looking at his announcements, it's like Obamacare.
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:34.120]  It just says, advisory, and then we'll just tell agencies what to do, a blank check.
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:36.120]  People say, well, that's not that bad.
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:40.120]  But look at what he's done, advisory, telling the border patrol to open the border and ship people in.
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:46.120]  Look at what he's done, advisory, bringing in the refugees and keeping it secret.
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:54.120]  This is advisory dictatorship. Talk about the raft of gun grabbing, what we can do to block it, sir, what you're doing on Capitol Hill.
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:16:03.120]  Well, his executive order, I guess it's an executive order action, whatever, is to expand the background check.
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:06.120]  Now, the background check has never been about fighting crime.
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:15.120]  In the last year of record, there were some 11 million background checks conducted, 14 prosecutions resulted.
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:21.120]  They're not after prosecutions because that's kind of a nothing burger type of offense.
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:22.120]  They're registering.
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:24.120]  They are registering.
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:33.120]  Hey, if they're not supposed to listen in when Aunt Mary calls cousin Susie, and yet the NSA gets it all,
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:42.120]  I think something even more worrisome to them, namely our guns, is going to really tempt them to break the law.
[02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:47.120]  They're not allowed to keep the background check info for over 24 hours.
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:52.120]  Anybody that believes that, I'm sorry, I'm not sure what I can say.
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:55.120]  But they've obviously shown they can't be trusted.
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:17:09.120]  The IRS abusing its powers, Lois Lerner and her jihad against conservatives and others that just weren't part of the regime friendly group that they wanted to work with.
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:12.120]  Anybody else was getting savaged.
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:16.120]  That's the kind of Chicago thuggery that we've been experiencing.
[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:26.120]  And now we've got 11 more months, and unless we can light enough fires under the Republican Party, they're not going to do a thing.
[02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:28.120]  They're going to sit there and watch.
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:29.120]  That was my next question.
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:31.120]  Where is the Speaker of the House going?
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:35.120]  Crazy for impeachment hearings or at least passing mills to block this.
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:39.120]  They could gain so many points just as politicians, much less statesmen.
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:41.120]  Why won't they stand up?
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:45.120]  Well, they give some good speeches about what he's doing is so wrong.
[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:47.120]  Isn't that good enough?
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:49.120]  No, we don't think so with gun owners.
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:52.120]  But they seem to think we're going to say, oh, gee, thanks a lot.
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:54.120]  That was really a great speech.
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:56.120]  I guess everything will be okay.
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:57.120]  It really won't.
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:02.120]  And we need to be looking for the opponents to these guys.
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:08.120]  A guy by the name of Castleman's running against Senator Bozeman I just learned in Arkansas.
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:09.120]  That would be an upgrade.
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:13.120]  Bozeman was a pretty good guy when he first came to Congress.
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:16.120]  He's so comfortable now as part of the establishment.
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:23.120]  These are the kind of people that need to go if we're ever going to make any headway in Washington.
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:28.120]  Because most of the Republicans have lied to us.
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:30.120]  They said they were going to get rid of Obamacare.
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:35.120]  And they have it within their hands the power to do it.
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:38.120]  Of course, Obama might shut down some of the government functions.
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:40.120]  And they say, oh, we can't do that.
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:42.120]  That would be an electoral disaster.
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:44.120]  But Obamacare is shutting the country down, as you know.
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:46.120]  It's bankrupting us.
[02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:48.120]  And it's all predicated on a false premise.
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:51.120]  Because these guys should know better than the rest of us.
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:52.120]  Wait a minute.
[02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:56.120]  The last time Obama partially shut down the government,
[02:18:56.120 --> 02:19:00.120]  and I refuse to say shut it all down, that's just not true.
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:03.120]  But the last time there was a partial shutdown,
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:09.120]  the result was six new Republican senators were elected.
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:12.120]  Net new Republican senators.
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:14.120]  What kind of wipeout is that?
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:19.120]  Man, if the Democrats have any more victories like that, they won't even be a party.
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:22.120]  Well, Gallup, as you know, I'll tell you about this when we come back
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:26.120]  and then talk about other strategies, what listeners can do to help defend the Second Amendment.
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:28.120]  Because this is obviously the big assault.
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:34.120]  Gallup's come out and said the lowest level of people ever identify as Democrats.
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:38.120]  Trump's got a 20% victory with Hillary,
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:41.120]  with 20% of her people coming over to him in polls.
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:45.120]  I want to ask you what you think of Trump, Larry Pratt, gunowners.org.
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:50.120]  Folks, you can go there and sign up for the free alerts or become a member.
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:54.120]  And by the way, you're insane if you're not a member of Governors of America.
[02:19:54.120 --> 02:19:57.120]  I mean, if you're not a member, you're not defending the Second Amendment,
[02:19:57.120 --> 02:20:20.120]  you're basically a red coat in my view.
[02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:32.120]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs,
[02:20:32.120 --> 02:20:35.120]  so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:39.120]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey purified water.
[02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:44.120]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size
[02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:48.120]  for incredibly delicious water now and in an emergency.

[02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:28.120]  I recently went from a desk job to a manual labor job.
[02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:31.120]  Normally I'm worn out with Energy Enhanced One World Way.
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:35.120]  I now recover so quickly that I can perform very hard work all day long.
[02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:38.120]  I use Energy Enhanced One World Way for breakfast and lunch
[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:40.120]  and I experience less hunger throughout the day.
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:43.120]  I have a 30% increase in energy and I just feel better.
[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:47.120]  I plan to make Energy Enhanced One World Way a permanent part of my life.

[02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:16.120]  Mark Kelly, the astronaut husband of Gabby Giffords, the congresswoman,
[02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:20.120]  said, you know, we've all heard these conspiracy theories about,
[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:22.120]  I've got the clip we could play it about,
[02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:24.120]  registration, confiscation, then comes tyranny,
[02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:27.120]  and then Obama's like, oh, oh, ridiculous, oh, oh.
[02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:29.120]  Next we'll say Obamacare isn't free.
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:32.120]  I mean, they have no credibility and the more they give speeches,
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:34.120]  the more unpopular they get,
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:36.120]  then we have the Austin Mayor Proteum saying,
[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:38.120]  we're going to confiscate once we register.
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:40.120]  I mean, that's their admitted goal.
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:43.120]  So they have a problem because their own publications like Newsweek
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:46.120]  and CNN say, yes, we want to ban guns, period.
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:49.120]  But then they get up and say, we don't want your guns.
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:51.120]  Is that part of their problem?
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:53.120]  Is that with one hand they tell the truth,
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:55.120]  the other hand they lie?
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:25:00.120]  They're assuming perhaps that the Democrat media,
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:03.120]  the old line media, the major networks,
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:06.120]  that used to be the major networks,
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:09.120]  can somehow protect them from what you're pointing to.
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:13.120]  The fact of the matter is, we don't trust them anymore.
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:17.120]  And when Obama says, oh, I'm not going to take your guns,
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:20.120]  well, it tells me I better go buy another safe.
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:23.120]  It tells me that that's what he has in mind.
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:26.120]  He said you can keep your doctor right.
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:27.120]  How'd that work out?
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:28.120]  Keep your plan.
[02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:30.120]  Yeah, that too, right.
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:31.120]  That was a good one.
[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:35.120]  And now he's saying he doesn't have any idea about taking our guns.
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:40.120]  Listen, when he even refers to the Australian model,
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:43.120]  and Hillary Clinton did as well.
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:44.120]  That's incredible.
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:46.120]  That's registration confiscation buyback.
[02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:49.120]  Right there, a forced buyback.
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:51.120]  You must sell to the government.
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:55.120]  We are confiscating all your semi-automatic firearms.
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:57.120]  Period paragraph.
[02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:02.120]  And that's supposed to be acceptable in the United States.
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:08.120]  I think if they want to get it on, if they want to see, you know,
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:10.120]  Connecticut should have told them something.
[02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:15.120]  If in Connecticut, a liberal state, people said,
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:17.120]  I'm not re-registering my guns.
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:18.120]  You already have it once.
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:20.120]  I'm not going to do it again.
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:22.120]  And they did it publicly.
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:26.120]  And something like what, we figure 95% maybe, never registered.
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:31.120]  In Washington state, it was something similar to Obama's executive order.
[02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:34.120]  All private sales must be registered and so forth.
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:36.120]  So the good news, the public's waking up.
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:39.120]  The liberal media keeps acting like we're cooks and no one's listening to us.
[02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:41.120]  But that's the emperor's new clothes.
[02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:44.120]  Really, they're being caught with their pants down.
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:45.120]  But they're not going to stop.
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:46.120]  They never do, in my view.
[02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:47.120]  Crep me if I'm wrong.
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:49.120]  How are they going to keep coming at us?
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:50.120]  How do we block this?
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:54.120]  I know you say get folks elected, put for impeachment, hearings, whatever.
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:56.120]  And then what do you think about Donald Trump?
[02:26:56.120 --> 02:26:59.120]  Who do you think is the best candidate right now in the lead?
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:05.120]  Well, the more they push for gun control, the more they are going to stir up.
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:10.120]  I know members of gun owners of America are just absolutely beside themselves with concern.
[02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:12.120]  That's what they should be.
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:16.120]  And a lot of other Americans are equally concerned.
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:19.120]  And so the more Obama prances around saying,
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:25.120]  I know you guys are just silly, we're not thinking of anything like that, nobody believes them anymore at all.
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:34.120]  And that's why even though we would endorse Ted Cruz, I will say the reason Donald Trump is doing as well as he is,
[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:39.120]  because he's very effectively tapping into that, I'm finished with you guys.
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:41.120]  I don't believe a word you're saying.
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:43.120]  And I want to push back.
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:49.120]  And Donald Trump has made himself available as a tool for pushing back.
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:53.120]  Let me say, I think, because you're a one issue,
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:59.120]  you obviously defend the whole Bill of Rights, but a gun rights organization, Cruz would be the best.
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:01.120]  He does have the best voting record, no compromise.
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:04.120]  Trump has done some questionable things, said some bad things in the past.
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:06.120]  I hopefully can trust him.
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:09.120]  I think he's better than Hillary, but I agree.
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:11.120]  I like Ted Cruz.
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:13.120]  In fact, I'd like to see if Ted Cruz doesn't get the nomination.
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:16.120]  I'd like to see him as vice president.
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:21.120]  That's at least a possibility, even though we fairly close to him.
[02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:25.120]  Our chairman is up in New Hampshire right now campaigning with him.
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:26.120]  Bless his heart.
[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:28.120]  He must be frozen stiff.
[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:32.120]  I just don't know what all is going to happen that far down the road,
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:39.120]  but it does look as if Cruz has a very decent chance of pulling off a victory in Iowa.
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:44.120]  That alone could influence how people vote in New Hampshire.
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:49.120]  Right now, Cruz is probably somewhere given on the polls, second, third, fourth.
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:51.120]  That could all change.
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:52.120]  He's number two, yeah.
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:54.120]  Shoot up to the top, yeah.
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:56.120]  That could well be a game changer.
[02:28:56.120 --> 02:28:59.120]  Sure. I mean, Cruz is a clear second now to Trump,
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:02.120]  and I got to say, I love this because I'll be happy either one.
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:03.120]  Exactly.
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:05.120]  But I mean, Cruz is more of a constitutionalist.
[02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:08.120]  He is politically smarter than Trump.
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:11.120]  Trump is better, I think, in business ways.
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:14.120]  But I mean, either way, it's better than Hillary.
[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:16.120]  Oh, by a long shot.
[02:29:16.120 --> 02:29:17.120]  Yeah, you're right about Cruz.
[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:21.120]  He's smarter than all of us, and probably all of our listeners combined.
[02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:24.120]  The guy is unbelievably smart.
[02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:28.120]  He's going to run circles around whoever the Democrats have as a nominee.
[02:29:28.120 --> 02:29:31.120]  May not be Hillary unless they can run somebody from jail.
[02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:33.120]  All right, gunowners.org.
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:36.120]  Give us that number too, sir, if folks want to call and join.
[02:29:36.120 --> 02:29:38.120]  Triple eight, double eight, six guns.
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:41.120]  888-886-GUNS.
[02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:43.120]  Larry Pratt, what a hero.
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:45.120]  George Washington in our lifetime.
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:30:07.120]  Thank you, sir.
[02:30:15.120 --> 02:30:20.120]  Because many of them were unions and other groups that pressured the public to support the socialist program.
[02:30:20.120 --> 02:30:24.120]  Once these groups realized just how bad Obamacare really was,
[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:29.120]  they wanted exemptions from the very same law they forced on everyone else, which Obama gave them.
[02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:34.120]  President Obama also had the IRS grant special illegal favors for his brother's so-called charity.
[02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:40.120]  The Daily Caller reported the IRS had taken the unprecedented step of approving a nonprofit application
[02:30:40.120 --> 02:30:43.120]  within just one month from the Barrick H. Obama Foundation.
[02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:48.120]  Additionally, the IRS illegally gave retroactive approval for the organization's tax-as-imp status.
[02:30:48.120 --> 02:30:55.120]  You can find out more from the article on infowars.com entitled 75 Times Obama Broke Law During Presidency.
[02:30:55.120 --> 02:31:24.120]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:51.120]  Thank you.
[02:31:51.120 --> 02:32:16.120]  Thank you.
[02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:28.120]  Thank you.
[02:32:28.120 --> 02:32:57.120]  Thank you.
[02:32:59.120 --> 02:33:11.120]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[02:33:11.120 --> 02:33:16.120]  He is Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:18.120]  Well, you can tell I'm not writing these new liners.
[02:33:18.120 --> 02:33:22.120]  They're very nice, but it's like he's an egomaniac and has all the answers.
[02:33:22.120 --> 02:33:24.120]  Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:26.120]  But I guess there's a good liner.
[02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:32.120]  There's a lot of questions they don't want you to ask, and Alex Jones is asking those exact same questions
[02:33:32.120 --> 02:33:38.120]  and doing the best job he can with his team of investigative journalists and top experts from around the world
[02:33:38.120 --> 02:33:43.120]  to find out exactly what's happening and how to respond to the criminal activity.
[02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:48.120]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:52.120]  Now we want to get government under our thumb that crank it up.
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:54.120]  Thank you.
[02:33:54.120 --> 02:33:58.120]  The government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:00.120]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:07.120]  Thomas Jefferson needs to be under our thumb.
[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:16.120]  The way she walks, the way she talks to me.
[02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:19.120]  Under my thumb.
[02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:23.120]  And that's where it needs to be, not under the foreign Chinese or other governments.
[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:33.120]  Running our whole country, running into the ground.
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:36.120]  Okay, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:34:36.120 --> 02:34:38.120]  Am I looking at camera four or camera one?
[02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:40.120]  They've changed the cameras around. They look better.
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:43.120]  I'm just getting my bearings and getting used to it here.
[02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:47.120]  David Knight is hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:54.120]  I just want to say that the people who are watching this show,
[02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:58.120]  progressive and other insurers push surveillance chips to monitor drivers is this in the future you want.
[02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:01.120]  Meanwhile, robot cars, driverless and suicide bombers,
[02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:05.120]  Pentagon brags about surveillance of all humanity,
[02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:09.120]  civilian and contractor personnel, lumping whistleblowers, like Thomas Drake,
[02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:11.120]  in with violent terrorists.
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:13.120]  Get no pressure release.
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:15.120]  People say good, get tough on the terrorists.
[02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:18.120]  Get them out of there. Then release them to go command ISIS.
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:20.120]  And then folks that are innocent get tortured for no reason.
[02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:24.120]  It's just a big exercise in breaking the law.
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:28.120]  How about our government doesn't fund ISIS in Al Qaeda for 30 years?
[02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:31.120]  How about we stop funding radical Islam?
[02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:33.120]  How about we stop shipping them in here?
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:35.120]  That's a good start.
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:37.120]  There's a lot of right wingers are like, I like it.
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:39.120]  Well, Obama better not shut it down.
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:41.120]  What are you going to do?
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:49.120]  Police go back and kill again because they're being released on purpose.
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:53.120]  Because when they go attack again, then they've got the terror attacks they need to take our freedoms.
[02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:56.120]  You're like, well, then should you keep them or let them go?
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:00.120]  Or you shouldn't have financed them to begin with.
[02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:04.120]  And they should let the police profile these groups.
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:08.120]  They block inner pole and the FBI from tracking these groups.
[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:11.120]  Congress has reported it's come out.
[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:19.120]  It came out with the San Bernardino situation.
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:30.120]  Speaking of that, let me get to a clip of Gabrielle Giffords husband, Mr. Kelly, at the CNN thing Friday.
[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:38.120]  And they're there blabbering and talking about conspiracy theories that confiscation.
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:41.120]  The registration confiscation tyranny.
[02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:46.120]  And then I want to play for you mayor pro team who heads up.
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:50.120]  The safe cities initiative that ties into the strong cities initiative of the UN.
[02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:53.120]  He heads it up for the mayor of Austin.
[02:36:53.120 --> 02:37:02.120]  This is him two years ago, they're trying to pass gun registration, banning gun shows and banning private transfer firearms, even the family and a bunch of other crud.
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:04.120]  Magazine restrictions.
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:11.120]  There was a whole bunch of stuff at the state level and he gets up to a guy with a sign saying no gun ban with a stop sign.
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:13.120]  A sign looks like a stop sign for radio listeners.
[02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:16.120]  Obviously TV viewers will be able to see it.
[02:37:16.120 --> 02:37:21.120]  And Martinez says, let me just say something that's fell out here in the crowd with that sign.
[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:27.120]  Not yet, but after we do this, we're going to do what's on your side.
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:32.120]  Nationwide gun confiscation is the goal of mayors against illegal guns.
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:36.120]  And they changed the name of it to the safe cities.
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:41.120]  And there is democratic official admits plan to confiscate guns.
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:44.120]  And then they actually had the police chief here.
[02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:46.120]  I had him on about other issues and he's a nice guy.
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:51.120]  I mean, he has, I think, made the police department better in many ways.
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:54.120]  I mean, done some bad stuff too.
[02:37:54.120 --> 02:37:57.120]  But the point is he's like, Mike Martinez didn't really mean that.
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:37:59.120]  There was a guy was cussing in the crowd.
[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:00.120]  We went back to the video.
[02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:02.120]  It was their people attacking and cussing.
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:05.120]  And he acted like Martinez was responding to that and not saying it.
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:07.120]  I mean, come on, Ace Veta.
[02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:08.120]  I'm not stupid.
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:13.120]  Don't talk to me like I'm a five year old.
[02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:17.120]  I mean, don't try jet on mine tricks on me telling me it's not the droids we're looking for.
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:18.120]  It's the same stuff Obama does.
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:22.120]  And I don't mean to go off on some jagging and say, so Veta, I'd love to get him in studio again.
[02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:28.120]  In fact, I think we just asked him last week, we'll see we'll come in, but he's a busy guy.
[02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:33.120]  But I mean, his dad was in the Cuban resistance, the CIA, the whole nine yards.
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:38.120]  I've met his dad on St. Patrick's Day.
[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:42.120]  I was down with the whole police area downtown where they put up these big tents and stuff.
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:45.120]  As they, you know, got a lot of cool food and stuff over there.
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:48.120]  I was over there talking to cops and there he was with his dad.
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:50.120]  I was out with friends and saw the event went over there.
[02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:51.120]  And of course I know about his dad.
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:55.120]  I've read some stuff about him and he just couldn't believe it.
[02:38:55.120 --> 02:38:59.120]  It's like people don't know who like something like Chuck Yeager is who's real famous, but old.
[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:04.120]  And certainly just some guy, you know, mentioned in a few books and the Cuban resistance, nobody would know it, but I knew it.
[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:05.120]  He was so blown away.
[02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:10.120]  And I was just like, are you proud of your son coming after, you know, the fourth amendment and stuff?
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:14.120]  And the point is Ace of Edas always like, don't call me a communist.
[02:39:14.120 --> 02:39:16.120]  I hate communists and I don't want tyranny.
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:19.120]  Okay, well, then don't go along with Obama's agenda.
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:21.120]  Don't be advised by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:24.120]  I mean, at a certain point you got to decide which side you're on.
[02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:27.120]  I get you want to be on both sides and be Mr. Friendly and all.
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:33.120]  And I'm just picking Ace of Edas out, Art Ace of Edas as an example of police everywhere.
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:36.120]  I mean, this country is being screwed over right now.
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:41.120]  Real tyranny is coming in, we need more than lip service.
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:49.120]  But anyways, I just see Mike Martinez and the attempts that he's engaged in to take our guns.
[02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:52.120]  And it's just why I don't want to dislike him.
[02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:53.120]  I don't want to hate him.
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:56.120]  It's like the last mayor we had, Lee Leffingwell, would get up and flip people off.
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:59.120]  We have it on video.
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:02.120]  A nice old man, former airline pilot.
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:07.120]  We have doctors up there, medical doctors about fluoride with Harvard studies about brain damage.
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:09.120]  And he just starts scratching his head with his middle finger,
[02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:12.120]  clearly flipping everyone off, laughing at everyone.
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:14.120]  Excuse me, I got to get up and go during this.
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:17.120]  Just so rude, so hateful.
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:21.120]  Being perched on by people like this.
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:24.120]  Anyways, let's go ahead and go to the clip.
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:25.120]  Here it is.
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:30.120]  Often what you hear in the debate of expanding background checks to more gun sales,
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:37.120]  and as you know, Gabby and I are 100% behind the concept of somebody getting a background check before buying a gun.
[02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:42.120]  But when we testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:47.120]  we heard not only from the gun lobby, but from United States senators,
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:54.120]  that expanding background checks will, not may, will lead to a registry which will lead to confiscation.
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:55.120]  Always does.
[02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:58.120]  Which will lead to a tyrannical government.
[02:40:58.120 --> 02:41:09.120]  So I would like you to explain with 350 million guns in 65 million places, households,
[02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:12.120]  from Key West to Alaska.
[02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:13.120]  350 million.
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:16.120]  Can you explain a plan of persecution of gun owners?
[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:18.120]  And incarceration over a long period of time.
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:21.120]  To confiscate those objects, how would they do that?
[02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:22.120]  It's their way to persecute.
[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:25.120]  What I think Mark is alluding to is what I said earlier.
[02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:33.120]  This notion of a conspiracy out there, and it gets wrapped up in concerns about the federal government.
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:35.120]  Now, there's a long history of that.
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:37.120]  That's in our DNA.
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:44.120]  The United States was born suspicious of some distant authority.
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:46.120]  Suspicious of a distant authority.
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:50.120]  Like the world government being set up for the TPP that's beyond King George III.
[02:41:50.120 --> 02:41:53.120]  At least we knew who he was and could read his proclamations.
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:58.120]  The TPPs were secret while they were getting it rammed through.
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:41:59.120]  These outrages are happening.
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:04.120]  Now, here's Martinez pointing at the sign that says no gunband.
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:06.120]  He says, sir, your sign right there.
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:10.120]  We're going to make that a reality.
[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:17.120]  Austin City Council Member, Mike Martinez.
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:19.120]  Thank you so much.
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:23.120]  I've got a proclamation on the African American City Council that we want to present.
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:26.120]  I want to say a couple of words, and I'll be brief.
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:29.120]  First of all, to the gentleman who's dying for attention,
[02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:33.120]  someone needs to inform them that there is no gunband currently.
[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:41.120]  But because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make your sign legitimate shortly.
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:45.120]  So we will make that a reality.
[02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:49.120]  So again, I've got so many clips I haven't gotten to.
[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:51.120]  I don't play something from last week for lack of clips.
[02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:55.120]  It's just really important to remember the main mission.
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:43:01.120]  And time and time again, when we would get up there, the Austin Mayor,
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:03.120]  we just showed footage of it would flip us off.
[02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:05.120]  We're polite, we're nice.
[02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:09.120]  We fly in like top toxicologists, university, top department heads.
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:13.120]  And it's just all big and funny.
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:18.120]  What a hateful, un-American pud.
[02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:23.120]  I mean, at a certain point, it's just, they hate us.
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:28.120]  And they love to just sneak around, and yeah, we at the registration,
[02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:30.120]  we're going to make that sound reality, but not yet.
[02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:34.120]  Just gloating how they're coming for us.
[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:36.120]  And secret recordings of Obama.
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:41.120]  Don't worry, I'll beat these bitter clingers.
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:44.120]  Now let's go to this next clip.
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:49.120]  Integrated Muslim migrants, Germans are disgusting.
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:50.120]  They should all disappear.
[02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:53.120]  Then I'm going to go to the Marine Corps General
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:56.120]  about how women in frontline combat is just ruining things.
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:43:58.120]  Really?
[02:43:58.120 --> 02:44:03.120]  Folks, I might be able when I was 20 or something,
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:05.120]  because I could run six, seven miles and lift weights and stuff,
[02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:08.120]  but it's still, I mean, I went on hikes for 10 miles with a backpack.
[02:44:08.120 --> 02:44:09.120]  I feel like I was going to die.
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:12.120]  I could have passed the Marine Corps Army Boot Camp,
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:15.120]  but I wasn't in that kind of shape.
[02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:18.120]  Most men I know couldn't do it, and most women I know couldn't do it,
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:21.120]  so they are reducing the pack sizes like we knew.
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:27.120]  They are going to, oh, you just have to do two pull-ups, not 20 now.
[02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:29.120]  The standards, the standard.
[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:30.120]  I mean, what are they going to say?
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:33.120]  Women in the NFL, and so now they're going to put braces on the men
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:35.120]  so they can't run too fast.
[02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:39.120]  It's out of a science fiction book, but it's happening.
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:41.120]  Oh, some people don't have moms and dads,
[02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:43.120]  so you can't use that word now.
[02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:44.120]  They're telling five-year-olds that.
[02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:46.120]  You want to screw them up?
[02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:48.120]  You want to create gender confusion?
[02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:50.120]  Who would let people mentally abuse their children like this?
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:52.120]  I'm sorry, but here it is.
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:53.120]  Integrated Muslim migrants.
[02:44:53.120 --> 02:44:55.120]  These are the sweet ones, the liberal ones.
[02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:57.120]  Germans are disgusting.
[02:44:57.120 --> 02:45:00.120]  They should all just disappear, close quote.
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:05.120]  Shock video, infowars.com, highlights attitudes of migrants
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:07.120]  towards host population.
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:12.120]  Video shot in German school shows integrated migrants, Muslims,
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:14.120]  speaking about how they find Germans disgusting,
[02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:19.120]  and the country would be better off if they all disappeared.
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:23.120]  Boy, the clip shows a woman speaking to migrant teenagers in school.
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:25.120]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:28.120]  It's up on infowars.com.
[02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:32.120]  Have you ever heard of the word integration?
[02:45:32.120 --> 02:45:34.120]  Yeah, what does integration mean?
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:36.120]  It means you exclude others, right?
[02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:38.120]  No, that's precisely what it is.
[02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:40.120]  Who of you has German friends?
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:42.120]  German friends?
[02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:47.120]  You, not me, not a single one.
[02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:49.120]  You don't have German friends? Let's be honest.
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:51.120]  Do you have German friends? No.
[02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:53.120]  Well, wait, don't lie, sure.
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:55.120]  Do you have German friends? No.
[02:45:55.120 --> 02:45:57.120]  Why don't you have German friends?
[02:45:57.120 --> 02:45:59.120]  Because they don't belong to us.
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:04.120]  I cannot be like them.
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:06.120]  It's like this, if you hang out with Germans,
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:08.120]  they do different things than you.
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:11.120]  For example, eating pork, I'm disgusted by them, to be honest.
[02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:15.120]  If I see this, I'm absolutely disgusted.
[02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:18.120]  Look, all the migrants stay in Germany,
[02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:20.120]  and all the Germans would disappear for just a single day
[02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:22.120]  and nobody would notice.
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:25.120]  Really, I notice you don't have to wear a headdress,
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:27.120]  or a suit, I notice you get to wear earrings,
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:29.120]  and that's the thing, they're not on average
[02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:33.120]  taking the freedom and enjoying it.
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:35.120]  They're getting upset by it,
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:39.120]  but merging with like gangster rap and communism.
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:42.120]  I mean, it's, ugh.
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:45.120]  And that's what I see now in Austin,
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:47.120]  downtown Austin now, two years ago,
[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:49.120]  didn't look like this, I mean, a lot of days,
[02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:52.120]  it looks like in areas, I mean, that you are in
[02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:54.120]  a third world Middle Eastern country.
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:56.120]  I mean, you'll be driving, it's just like,
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:46:58.120]  Muslim dress, Muslim dress, Muslim dress, Muslim dress,
[02:46:58.120 --> 02:47:00.120]  Muslim women, everywhere with babies,
[02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:03.120]  and all the trendy white, black, Hispanic women out there.
[02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:05.120]  They're not having kids, and it's just like,
[02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:07.120]  okay, if the Muslims wanted to integrate
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:09.120]  and whatever, it wouldn't be an issue.
[02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:11.120]  But it's like the anger, the upsetness,
[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:14.120]  and I'd be downtown now, and there's Saudi Arabians
[02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:16.120]  and folks walking around, and when you're walking,
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:18.120]  even if you try to get out of their way,
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:19.120]  they know people don't like them,
[02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:21.120]  they know they're from another culture,
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:23.120]  and they're looking at you like they want to kill you.
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:25.120]  It's like I'm in a Bugs Bunny cartoon or something,
[02:47:25.120 --> 02:47:28.120]  and they're going to go, a sun chop!
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:31.120]  You know, how did I get to this point?
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:38.120]  And suddenly, Fox, CNN, MSNBC, there's women
[02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:42.120]  in hijabs, hijabs, all over TV, you know, as the pundits.
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:44.120]  Talking about the racist whites, in fact,
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:46.120]  let's go to that, I never played these clips,
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:48.120]  I had to play this at the first of the show.
[02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:50.120]  This is Hillary.
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:54.120]  Clip after clip.
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:56.120]  This is her at a fusion forum,
[02:47:56.120 --> 02:47:58.120]  poses questions to Hillary on white terrorism,
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:00.120]  white privilege, and reparations,
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:02.120]  and then there's another clip.
[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:05.120]  Travis Smiley on Obama's legacy
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:07.120]  for black America and his own.
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:09.120]  Students taught most U.S. territories
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:11.120]  terrorists are conservative white men.
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:14.120]  That's what the college fixed with Dr. Rosa Avila
[02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:17.120]  at the University of California.
[02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:19.120]  I mean, it's just every day, that's the new thing.
[02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:21.120]  Whites are terrorists, whites are bad,
[02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:24.120]  whites are evil, whites are the source of all problems.
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:26.120]  I mean, this is like Hitler against the Jews,
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:28.120]  but the opposite, and it's being taught
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:30.120]  all over the world, folks.
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:33.120]  It's so whacked out, it's all over MSNBC,
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:36.120]  all over CNN, I play the clips almost every day.
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:40.120]  These are evil people, folks,
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:41.120]  Anderson Cooper.
[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:44.120]  Let's go ahead and play the Hillary clip.
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:47.120]  All of the Democratic presidential candidates
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:49.120]  have said that black lives matter,
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:51.120]  even if they didn't at first.
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:54.120]  But how will your administration specifically prove that?
[02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:56.120]  The danger of ISIS is clearly a major threat
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:58.120]  to American safety.
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:00.120]  But personally, I know many minorities
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:03.120]  who are much more concerned with racist attacks
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:06.120]  at the local level than radical Islamists.
[02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:07.120]  Almost over.
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:09.120]  A question to put it plainly,
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:12.120]  since often issues of racism tiptoed.
[02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:15.120]  Do you believe that white terrorism and extremism
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:17.120]  is as much a threat to some in this country
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:18.120]  as something like ISIS?
[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:20.120]  As Alicia mentioned,
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:21.120]  my name is Taliangeta,
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:23.120]  and I'm a junior here at Drake University,
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:25.120]  and my question is for you,
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:26.120]  and it is the following.
[02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:28.120]  White privilege is a term that more people
[02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:30.120]  are talking openly about these days.
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:33.120]  Certainly people like me have long understood
[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:34.120]  what it means.
[02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:36.120]  Secretary Clinton, can you tell us
[02:49:36.120 --> 02:49:39.120]  what the term white privilege means to you,
[02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:41.120]  and can you give me an example from your life
[02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:44.120]  or career when you think you have benefited from it?
[02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:46.120]  Do you think 2016 is the year
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:48.120]  kind of on the federal level
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:50.120]  we should start studying reparations?
[02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:54.120]  That's all that's talked about in these colleges.
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:56.120]  That's all that's talked about in the public schools
[02:49:56.120 --> 02:49:58.120]  pretty much now, other than entertainment.
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:00.120]  I mean, totally dumbed down people,
[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:03.120]  unaware of what's going on in the real world.
[02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:06.120]  Where every movie you go see,
[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:08.120]  the Native Americans are perfect angels
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:10.120]  and the settlers are the devil.
[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:12.120]  That's just not how it was.
[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:15.120]  Settlers showed up and Native tribes came to them
[02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:17.120]  and said, you will help us kill the other tribe
[02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:19.120]  or we're going to kill you.
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:21.120]  And that's because they were just like we were.
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:23.120]  They just were in a more barbaric state
[02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:26.120]  than Europe had been from a thousand plus years of war.
[02:50:26.120 --> 02:50:27.120]  It had stabilized.
[02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:28.120]  Humans are just humans,
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:32.120]  and it's just the craziest, craziest thing,
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:34.120]  the chip on the shoulder kids from these college,
[02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:38.120]  these young adults who have been cheated.
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:39.120]  There's not going to be jobs.
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:41.120]  There's not going to be a future under globalism.
[02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:43.120]  There's an engineer global depression.
[02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:46.120]  And just all they can think about is all this new speak
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:47.120]  and political correctness.
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:49.120]  They are handicapped.
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:50.120]  They are mentally ill.
[02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:52.120]  They are screwballs.
[02:50:52.120 --> 02:51:21.120]  They are chip on the shoulder, ruined people.
[02:51:22.120 --> 02:51:29.120]  That's just not how it was.
[02:51:53.120 --> 02:51:57.120]  877-886-3653
[02:51:57.120 --> 02:52:23.120]  As your body ages, there's a 10% decline in your ability to repair
[02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:47.120]  yourself.

[03:33:01.120 --> 03:33:06.120]  We are on the March. The Empire is on the Run.
[03:33:06.120 --> 03:33:11.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:11.120 --> 03:33:14.120]  We're living on the air.
[03:33:14.120 --> 03:33:16.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight.
[03:33:16.120 --> 03:33:18.120]  Your host is the rest of this fourth hour.
[03:33:18.120 --> 03:33:20.120]  And as I was saying before we went to break,
[03:33:20.120 --> 03:33:24.120]  I want to talk about what's really going to be going on with driverless cars.
[03:33:24.120 --> 03:33:27.120]  And of course, they're not driverless cars.
[03:33:27.120 --> 03:33:29.120]  Truth is, they're robot cars.
[03:33:29.120 --> 03:33:31.120]  Driven by humans.
[03:33:31.120 --> 03:33:34.120]  It's just humans who are operating through software that they wrote.
[03:33:34.120 --> 03:33:36.120]  Do you see a problem there? I do.
[03:33:36.120 --> 03:33:39.120]  They're also going to be controlled and monitored by the government.
[03:33:39.120 --> 03:33:41.120]  I see a big problem with that as well.
[03:33:41.120 --> 03:33:43.120]  Let me tell you how this is going to roll out.
[03:33:43.120 --> 03:33:45.120]  We've been saying this for a very long time.
[03:33:45.120 --> 03:33:48.120]  We've been talking about this for, well, at least since I've been here.
[03:33:48.120 --> 03:33:51.120]  And Alex was talking about that before I got here.
[03:33:51.120 --> 03:33:54.120]  We've been talking about exactly how this is going to roll out.
[03:33:54.120 --> 03:33:58.120]  You're going to be pushed out of your car with insurance rates.
[03:33:58.120 --> 03:34:00.120]  That's the way they're going to come after you.
[03:34:00.120 --> 03:34:02.120]  And that's what this article is about.
[03:34:02.120 --> 03:34:05.120]  And of course, this has been the dream of the government for a very long time.
[03:34:05.120 --> 03:34:07.120]  They want to control everything about your life,
[03:34:07.120 --> 03:34:10.120]  make you dependent on them, your housing, your food,
[03:34:10.120 --> 03:34:12.120]  especially your transportation.
[03:34:12.120 --> 03:34:15.120]  Look at all of these ridiculous projects that come up.
[03:34:15.120 --> 03:34:19.120]  All these monorail systems and subway systems in American cities
[03:34:19.120 --> 03:34:22.120]  where you don't have the population density that comes anywhere close
[03:34:22.120 --> 03:34:25.120]  to being able to need that or to support that.
[03:34:25.120 --> 03:34:28.120]  Of course, they want to concentrate people into the cities.
[03:34:28.120 --> 03:34:30.120]  That's what's going on with the BLM.
[03:34:30.120 --> 03:34:33.120]  They're cutting edge of pushing people off of the land.
[03:34:33.120 --> 03:34:36.120]  They're making it so that people can't make a living off the land.
[03:34:36.120 --> 03:34:40.120]  They're making it so that when they don't allow people to do any lumbering,
[03:34:40.120 --> 03:34:44.120]  taking off standing deadwood in the forest or removing trees that have fallen,
[03:34:44.120 --> 03:34:49.120]  then what they do is they make it possible for millions of acres to burn.
[03:34:49.120 --> 03:34:52.120]  Just in Oregon, there were millions of acres that burned.
[03:34:52.120 --> 03:34:55.120]  The same year, they came after that family for saying,
[03:34:55.120 --> 03:34:58.120]  well, you burned 139 acres.
[03:34:58.120 --> 03:35:01.120]  They had 3.4 million acres that burned in Oregon that year.
[03:35:01.120 --> 03:35:05.120]  And a lot of that was due to mismanagement by the BLM.
[03:35:05.120 --> 03:35:09.120]  But of course, the BLM lights its own backfires to try to control wildfires.
[03:35:09.120 --> 03:35:11.120]  And they do damage to private property.
[03:35:11.120 --> 03:35:12.120]  Nobody ever does anything to them.
[03:35:12.120 --> 03:35:15.120]  We also have a story from Hillary Clinton saying,
[03:35:15.120 --> 03:35:19.120]  we need to arrest these protesters in Oregon.
[03:35:19.120 --> 03:35:23.120]  I think we need to take the line that Rand Paul said when you've got all these people
[03:35:23.120 --> 03:35:26.120]  calling for the arrest and imprisonment of Ed Snowden.
[03:35:26.120 --> 03:35:28.120]  He says, well, maybe he broke some laws.
[03:35:28.120 --> 03:35:33.120]  But we can imprison Ed Snowden when we imprison the people like Michael Hayden
[03:35:33.120 --> 03:35:38.120]  and Clapper, James Clapper, who lied to us, who broke the law as well.
[03:35:38.120 --> 03:35:40.120]  They broke a much more serious law.
[03:35:40.120 --> 03:35:42.120]  He was trying to expose what they were doing.
[03:35:42.120 --> 03:35:44.120]  And so of course, Rand Paul says, yeah, okay, fine.
[03:35:44.120 --> 03:35:47.120]  Lock up Snowden, but lock those guys up too.
[03:35:47.120 --> 03:35:50.120]  Oh, okay, you want to go after these guys who engage in civil disobedience
[03:35:50.120 --> 03:35:51.120]  like Occupy Wall Street?
[03:35:51.120 --> 03:35:53.120]  You never called for them to be in prison, did you?
[03:35:53.120 --> 03:35:54.120]  Hillary.
[03:35:54.120 --> 03:35:57.120]  Well, then fine, let's look at your crimes.
[03:35:57.120 --> 03:36:01.120]  Let's send you to jail for the things that you've gotten away with.
[03:36:01.120 --> 03:36:02.120]  But let's get back to the cars.
[03:36:02.120 --> 03:36:04.120]  I want to talk about that first.
[03:36:04.120 --> 03:36:06.120]  This is a Wall Street Journal article now.
[03:36:06.120 --> 03:36:08.120]  The mainstream media is talking about this quite a bit.
[03:36:08.120 --> 03:36:10.120]  And of course, this is the financial angle.
[03:36:10.120 --> 03:36:14.120]  Let's say car insurers find tracking devices are a tough sell.
[03:36:14.120 --> 03:36:15.120]  Oh, really?
[03:36:15.120 --> 03:36:16.120]  Really?
[03:36:16.120 --> 03:36:21.120]  I mean, really, you don't want the car company, the insurance company,
[03:36:21.120 --> 03:36:25.120]  setting their monitoring your every move and adjusting your insurance rates accordingly.
[03:36:25.120 --> 03:36:27.120]  As many people say, it just creeps me out.
[03:36:27.120 --> 03:36:31.120]  They say, in a lab at Progressive Corporations Suburban Headquarters,
[03:36:31.120 --> 03:36:35.120]  you've got technicians looking at a colleague driving from his home into the city.
[03:36:35.120 --> 03:36:39.120]  And they've got a dot on a computer screen that's moving along with a map,
[03:36:39.120 --> 03:36:40.120]  overlaid with speed limits.
[03:36:40.120 --> 03:36:44.120]  And whenever he goes over the speed limit, the little dot turns red.
[03:36:44.120 --> 03:36:47.120]  And then they will eventually have something that's going to record that,
[03:36:47.120 --> 03:36:52.120]  report that to the insurance company, report that to the police so they can find you accordingly.
[03:36:52.120 --> 03:36:53.120]  Guess what?
[03:36:53.120 --> 03:36:56.120]  You're not going to be driving a car very long under those circumstances.
[03:36:56.120 --> 03:37:01.120]  And already, the Federal Department of Transportation has mandated what they call V2V,
[03:37:01.120 --> 03:37:03.120]  vehicle-to-vehicle communication.
[03:37:03.120 --> 03:37:07.120]  Or, like they like to put it, when they came to South by Southwest, they said,
[03:37:07.120 --> 03:37:10.120]  talking cars, because that sounds so cool.
[03:37:10.120 --> 03:37:12.120]  It sounds like something out of Pixar's cars.
[03:37:12.120 --> 03:37:13.120]  But no, it's not.
[03:37:13.120 --> 03:37:16.120]  They're going to be talking, and they're going to be talking about you.
[03:37:16.120 --> 03:37:18.120]  They're going to say, he drives too fast.
[03:37:18.120 --> 03:37:20.120]  He breaks too quickly.
[03:37:20.120 --> 03:37:21.120]  He corners too hard.
[03:37:21.120 --> 03:37:22.120]  Okay?
[03:37:22.120 --> 03:37:25.120]  All this nanny government literally in your car.
[03:37:25.120 --> 03:37:29.120]  Maybe we should use a third amendment to shut this down, huh?
[03:37:29.120 --> 03:37:32.120]  Yeah, I don't want the government as my co-pilot.
[03:37:32.120 --> 03:37:35.120]  Or the God ferment, as I guess that's what they're like.
[03:37:35.120 --> 03:37:39.120]  Using devices installed in the customer's cars, Progressive and other auto insurers
[03:37:39.120 --> 03:37:42.120]  are tracking things like how far their customers drive.
[03:37:42.120 --> 03:37:44.120]  How often they slam on the brakes.
[03:37:44.120 --> 03:37:47.120]  And as one person says, they say, well, you have to hide.
[03:37:47.120 --> 03:37:52.120]  But I don't want big business or big brother being involved in my personal life.
[03:37:52.120 --> 03:37:54.120]  It creeps me out.
[03:37:54.120 --> 03:37:56.120]  A person after my own heart.
[03:37:56.120 --> 03:38:01.120]  They say this involves Progressive, Allstate, State Farm, Mutual, Automobile,
[03:38:01.120 --> 03:38:05.120]  Insurance companies are all promoting plug-in devices and or smartphone apps.
[03:38:05.120 --> 03:38:06.120]  I think I have an app for that.
[03:38:06.120 --> 03:38:08.120]  You don't even have to stick the hardware in there.
[03:38:08.120 --> 03:38:11.120]  They can just put the app on your smartphone.
[03:38:11.120 --> 03:38:17.120]  As well as cutting deals to piggyback on automakers in car computers.
[03:38:17.120 --> 03:38:18.120]  There you go.
[03:38:18.120 --> 03:38:19.120]  Cutting deals with them.
[03:38:19.120 --> 03:38:22.120]  And who do you think is cutting deals with the insurance companies and the car companies
[03:38:22.120 --> 03:38:23.120]  to put all this stuff in?
[03:38:23.120 --> 03:38:24.120]  It's the government.
[03:38:24.120 --> 03:38:25.120]  It's the government.
[03:38:25.120 --> 03:38:31.120]  They want to play nice with the government because that has some benefits for them, of course.
[03:38:31.120 --> 03:38:34.120]  Because when they can do, they can throw you under the bus.
[03:38:34.120 --> 03:38:38.120]  And of course, the solution that they want to tell us is that we're going to have driverless
[03:38:38.120 --> 03:38:45.120]  taxis like Uber or Lyft that you won't need to own a car because all the cars will be
[03:38:45.120 --> 03:38:50.120]  owned by one corporation that works hand in glove with the government.
[03:38:50.120 --> 03:38:52.120]  That's called fascism, folks.
[03:38:52.120 --> 03:38:53.120]  It's called crony capitalism.
[03:38:53.120 --> 03:38:54.120]  It's called corruption.
[03:38:54.120 --> 03:38:56.120]  It's called the loss of freedom.
[03:38:56.120 --> 03:38:58.120]  I grew up in the 20th century.
[03:38:58.120 --> 03:39:01.120]  I am a man of the 20th century.
[03:39:01.120 --> 03:39:06.120]  And in the 20th century, we looked at cars as a very expression of our freedom.
[03:39:06.120 --> 03:39:10.120]  Go where you wanted to go, when you wanted to go, and in the style that you wanted to
[03:39:10.120 --> 03:39:11.120]  go.
[03:39:11.120 --> 03:39:14.120]  I mean, you could get something like a pinto or you could get a muscle car.
[03:39:14.120 --> 03:39:16.120]  You could get a luxury car, whatever.
[03:39:16.120 --> 03:39:19.120]  You had that freedom to spend what you wanted to spend on the car.
[03:39:19.120 --> 03:39:22.120]  Go in the manner that you wanted to go whenever you wanted to go.
[03:39:22.120 --> 03:39:25.120]  That was a major selling point of Chevrolet.
[03:39:25.120 --> 03:39:28.120]  Remember, see the USA and a Chevrolet?
[03:39:28.120 --> 03:39:30.120]  They were selling freedom.
[03:39:30.120 --> 03:39:32.120]  Now what they're selling is control.
[03:39:32.120 --> 03:39:38.120]  Now what they're selling is the fact that you can just disengage and put yourself in
[03:39:38.120 --> 03:39:39.120]  the matrix of Facebook.
[03:39:39.120 --> 03:39:45.120]  You can sit there and tweet and do postings on Facebook and just disconnect from the real
[03:39:45.120 --> 03:39:46.120]  world.
[03:39:46.120 --> 03:39:49.120]  Just be a chauffeur along in your little car.
[03:39:49.120 --> 03:39:55.120]  They say early company surveys, though, of people's interest in these usage-based insurance
[03:39:55.120 --> 03:40:01.120]  plans reveal that only about 40% of the people had a viewpoint that 40% of the people had
[03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:05.120]  a viewpoint that was some variation on no way in hell.
[03:40:05.120 --> 03:40:08.120]  I'm surprised that it is that small.
[03:40:08.120 --> 03:40:12.120]  That's what really concerns me is that only 40% of the people see a problem with this.
[03:40:12.120 --> 03:40:14.120]  They went through and they looked at some of the data.
[03:40:14.120 --> 03:40:20.120]  They found that drivers who slam on brakes more than eight times every 500 miles are 73%
[03:40:20.120 --> 03:40:22.120]  more likely to get into an accident in a given year.
[03:40:22.120 --> 03:40:28.120]  Oh, you mean like the Google car that has accident rates that are four to five times
[03:40:28.120 --> 03:40:32.120]  what the average car owner has is slamming on brakes all the time?
[03:40:32.120 --> 03:40:36.120]  Of course, if you slam on the brakes and somebody hits you from behind, you're not charged with
[03:40:36.120 --> 03:40:37.120]  the accident.
[03:40:37.120 --> 03:40:40.120]  The Google car is not charged with the accident, but isn't it interesting?
[03:40:40.120 --> 03:40:45.120]  I wonder if the Google car could get insurance on this basis.
[03:40:45.120 --> 03:40:50.120]  Then they talk about how even if the companies want to be nice and they don't want to get
[03:40:50.120 --> 03:40:56.120]  into this big brother scenario, they're saying they're going to have an adverse selection.
[03:40:56.120 --> 03:41:01.120]  In other words, they say companies that don't offer a usage-based program could be impacted
[03:41:01.120 --> 03:41:03.120]  by an adverse selection.
[03:41:03.120 --> 03:41:06.120]  In other words, they could be stuck with bad drivers.
[03:41:06.120 --> 03:41:12.120]  They're assuming that if you don't want to be monitored 24-7 by the government, you're a bad driver.
[03:41:12.120 --> 03:41:18.120]  No, I am not a terrorist because I don't want the government listening and recording my every movement.
[03:41:18.120 --> 03:41:24.120]  And I'm not a bad driver because I don't want the insurance company looking for every possible excuse
[03:41:24.120 --> 03:41:25.120]  to raise my insurance rates.
[03:41:25.120 --> 03:41:30.120]  And if you sign on to this thing, you are selling out your future.
[03:41:30.120 --> 03:41:31.120]  This is not the future I want.
[03:41:31.120 --> 03:41:33.120]  It's not the future I want for me.
[03:41:33.120 --> 03:41:36.120]  It's not the future I want for my children or grandchildren.
[03:41:36.120 --> 03:41:42.120]  And if you sign on to this, just understand you are just signing away your freedom to move about.
[03:41:42.120 --> 03:41:47.120]  But of course, ISIS has now got a driverless car bomb.
[03:41:47.120 --> 03:41:50.120]  And understand that DARPA is very first challenge.
[03:41:50.120 --> 03:41:56.120]  Remember a year or two ago, they had the robot that they said that they were setting up.
[03:41:56.120 --> 03:41:59.120]  So it would save people from a Fukushima-type of accident.
[03:41:59.120 --> 03:42:03.120]  Look, DARPA is about creating weapons, okay?
[03:42:03.120 --> 03:42:06.120]  They're the Defense Advanced Research Project.
[03:42:06.120 --> 03:42:08.120]  They're about creating weapons.
[03:42:08.120 --> 03:42:15.120]  They're the very first machine they made, or the very first competition, I should say, was in 2003.
[03:42:15.120 --> 03:42:22.120]  They challenged inventors to make a machine that could by itself navigate a 300-mile stretch between LA and Vegas.
[03:42:22.120 --> 03:42:24.120]  So this is their first challenge.
[03:42:24.120 --> 03:42:26.120]  They've done many challenges since then.
[03:42:26.120 --> 03:42:30.120]  But they envisioned this as something's going to be used by the military from the very beginning.
[03:42:30.120 --> 03:42:32.120]  They envisioned it as a weapon.
[03:42:32.120 --> 03:42:37.120]  And now we're being told that somehow, ISIS, you know, those people who are given American weapons,
[03:42:37.120 --> 03:42:44.120]  those people who are transported to the area from Chechnya so they can stop fighting the Russians
[03:42:44.120 --> 03:42:47.120]  in Chechnya and the southern parts of Russia.
[03:42:47.120 --> 03:42:49.120]  Now they can fight the Russians in Syria.
[03:42:49.120 --> 03:42:57.120]  You know, those same people, the Pentagon and the CIA, those people who have been equipping and training and funding ISIS,
[03:42:57.120 --> 03:43:01.120]  now they're saying, oh, now they've got a driverless car bomb.
[03:43:01.120 --> 03:43:03.120]  They say driverless cars.
[03:43:03.120 --> 03:43:10.120]  This is popular science because, and it's interesting because popular science is usually very G-Wiz and supportive of any technology.
[03:43:10.120 --> 03:43:19.120]  But even they say driverless cars are supposed to be a sign of a tranquil future where pleasant machines cart relaxed guests around,
[03:43:19.120 --> 03:43:22.120]  handling all the messiness of automobile travel.
[03:43:22.120 --> 03:43:30.120]  Yeah, you know, it's just like Beauty and the Beast at Disney World, you know, be my guest, get into my car, right?
[03:43:30.120 --> 03:43:33.120]  Except it's a trap, folks, if you get into that.
[03:43:33.120 --> 03:43:38.120]  And of course, it's going to be a trap once we see these driverless car bombs.
[03:43:38.120 --> 03:43:43.120]  They're going to be used as weapons, but whether or not they're used as weapons, whether or not they're used as terrorist car bombs,
[03:43:43.120 --> 03:43:47.120]  they're going to be used as a weapon of control.
[03:43:47.120 --> 03:43:51.120]  Understand that our very interstate system was designed as a military device.
[03:43:51.120 --> 03:43:54.120]  That's why Hitler did the autobahn in Germany.
[03:43:54.120 --> 03:43:57.120]  Eisenhower saw it and said, we need that here.
[03:43:57.120 --> 03:44:01.120]  Not because he wanted you to be able to see the world in a Chevrolet.
[03:44:01.120 --> 03:44:05.120]  Okay, but because he wanted to be able to move the military very quickly from one spot to the other.
[03:44:05.120 --> 03:44:08.120]  He had already been involved in a project. We're in the Northeast.
[03:44:08.120 --> 03:44:14.120]  He had to move a division of equipment and he was appalled at how difficult it was.
[03:44:14.120 --> 03:44:16.120]  They couldn't get through the roads that were there.
[03:44:16.120 --> 03:44:22.120]  So they said, well, let's build this gigantic system called the interstate and have really wide lanes.
[03:44:22.120 --> 03:44:25.120]  And then if we need to, we can commandeer it for military use.
[03:44:25.120 --> 03:44:34.120]  But of course, what they wound up doing was commandeering it to enforce a 55-mph speed limit under Richard Nixon to take away your freedoms in that area.
[03:44:34.120 --> 03:44:36.120]  So it always comes back around.
[03:44:36.120 --> 03:44:38.120]  And one last article here, of course.
[03:44:38.120 --> 03:44:42.120]  This is, we have the Consumer Electronics Show that's going on in Las Vegas.
[03:44:42.120 --> 03:44:45.120]  It happens at the beginning of each year.
[03:44:45.120 --> 03:44:49.120]  The big things, again, at Consumer Electronics Show are driverless cars.
[03:44:49.120 --> 03:44:57.120]  And what's happening is you're seeing an alliance with Ford and possibly Ford and Google getting together to work on a car.
[03:44:57.120 --> 03:45:07.120]  And Ford now sees themselves not so much in the future as selling individual cars, but as selling mobility devices is what one of their executives said.
[03:45:07.120 --> 03:45:10.120]  So they're looking at how they can become the vendor.
[03:45:10.120 --> 03:45:25.120]  So it's going to be a situation where all of these billionaires or a few multinational corporations are going to be jockeying for a position to be the supplier to the government in terms of providing transportation that you don't have any control over,
[03:45:25.120 --> 03:45:29.120]  but that will control you, will be used as an instrument of control.
[03:45:29.120 --> 03:45:36.120]  And as we're looking at that, I saw this article that I mentioned briefly to Alex about Mike McCall.
[03:45:36.120 --> 03:45:38.120]  He's a Texas congressman.
[03:45:38.120 --> 03:45:42.120]  He's the chair of the House Homeland Security Committee.
[03:45:42.120 --> 03:45:46.120]  And he's written a book to scare you, to scare you.
[03:45:46.120 --> 03:45:54.120]  Because the definition of terrorism is the use of violence, intimidation, fear to achieve political goals.
[03:45:54.120 --> 03:46:06.120]  And that's been the mode of our government since September 11th, using violence, intimidation, and fear to achieve their political goals, to achieve their control.
[03:46:06.120 --> 03:46:08.120]  And so that's what Mike McCall is selling.
[03:46:08.120 --> 03:46:12.120]  And I think it is absolutely despicable what he is doing.
[03:46:12.120 --> 03:46:25.120]  Scaring people. I say the chairman of Homeland Security Committee is warning in a chilling new book that terrorists could easily hit Disney World, the Academy Awards, the Mall of America with killer biological attacks, killing thousands,
[03:46:25.120 --> 03:46:38.120]  sending the nation into a panic, at which point this James Bond villain would step out of his Homeland Security Committee, rubbing his hands like a praying mantis and announce the next step towards martial law.
[03:46:38.120 --> 03:46:39.120]  That's what they would love to do.
[03:46:39.120 --> 03:46:47.120]  But in the meantime, he wants to try to get you there saying, oh, could be a possible attack from Russian invasion of Eastern Europe.
[03:46:47.120 --> 03:46:53.120]  We're the ones who are aggressors in Russia as well as other places.
[03:46:53.120 --> 03:46:56.120]  We're the ones who restarted the Cold War.
[03:46:56.120 --> 03:47:01.120]  But of course, they turn everything around, spin it upside down.
[03:47:01.120 --> 03:47:03.120]  I think it's absolutely reprehensible.
[03:47:03.120 --> 03:47:09.120]  I had a friend from high school who joined the military and he was at the Pentagon.
[03:47:09.120 --> 03:47:13.120]  And I remember meeting with him about 20 years ago and asking him what he was doing.
[03:47:13.120 --> 03:47:15.120]  And they were working on things like this.
[03:47:15.120 --> 03:47:17.120]  They were working on scenarios.
[03:47:17.120 --> 03:47:19.120]  But he wouldn't tell me what the scenarios were.
[03:47:19.120 --> 03:47:28.120]  He said, well, that's something we really don't want to panic the public, something they don't need to know, something we don't want that information to get out to people who would possibly do that.
[03:47:28.120 --> 03:47:32.120]  But that's not the mode that they're working in now.
[03:47:32.120 --> 03:47:35.120]  Because, see, they're not really concerned about protecting you.
[03:47:35.120 --> 03:47:40.120]  They're concerned about the security state and maintaining that.
[03:47:40.120 --> 03:47:48.120]  That is their religion, which is what makes it so surprising that Hillary Clinton keeps getting a pass with all these violations.
[03:47:48.120 --> 03:47:55.120]  Over 1340 emails so far that were classified that she had on her private server.
[03:47:55.120 --> 03:48:00.120]  Even telling people to remove the classification so you can send this as a fact.
[03:48:00.120 --> 03:48:02.120]  You're having trouble faxing this.
[03:48:02.120 --> 03:48:05.120]  You can't get anybody to do this because they don't want to violate it.
[03:48:05.120 --> 03:48:11.120]  Well, okay, just take off the classification markings, violate the law that way.
[03:48:11.120 --> 03:48:22.120]  So here we've got this religion of state security that we have to sacrifice all of our safety, all of our liberty on the altar of that religion of state security.
[03:48:22.120 --> 03:48:29.120]  And then you've got this woman who comes along and violates it with impunity and nothing happens to her.
[03:48:29.120 --> 03:48:32.120]  Absolutely, absolutely amazing.
[03:48:32.120 --> 03:48:39.120]  Now, I had talked about Palantir and I want to play you a little excerpt from a video that I did back in December of 2013.
[03:48:39.120 --> 03:48:42.120]  Because there's an update to this that was on the Dredge Report, I believe.
[03:48:42.120 --> 03:48:49.120]  It's the CIA-backed startup that is taking over Palo Alto as an NBC story.
[03:48:49.120 --> 03:48:55.120]  But I want to play for you what we knew and what we reported way back in 2013.
[03:48:55.120 --> 03:48:57.120]  Here's a short clip of that report.
[03:48:57.120 --> 03:49:02.120]  Much has been said about the big tech companies that were implicated in this slide from Edward Snowden's documents.
[03:49:02.120 --> 03:49:06.120]  It's eroded confidence in their integrity and damaged their business.
[03:49:06.120 --> 03:49:12.120]  But what about the PRISM program itself, where people are profiled by data mining the intercepted digital communications?
[03:49:12.120 --> 03:49:16.120]  Some have suspected that the company behind PRISM is Palantir.
[03:49:16.120 --> 03:49:21.120]  I've often thought that the Palantir from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings were the perfect metaphor for the Internet.
[03:49:21.120 --> 03:49:27.120]  In the book, the Palantir were crystal balls that allowed the possessors to communicate and to see things.
[03:49:27.120 --> 03:49:30.120]  Eventually, they fell into the hands of the evil forces.
[03:49:30.120 --> 03:49:36.120]  And using a Palantir not only revealed you to the villain, Sauron, represented by the all-seeing eye,
[03:49:36.120 --> 03:49:41.120]  but also allowed him to learn where you were and look into your mind and your soul.
[03:49:41.120 --> 03:49:45.120]  A great metaphor for people who are trying to use the Internet for legitimate purposes
[03:49:45.120 --> 03:49:51.120]  and the government spooks who create profiles of people as they're using it.
[03:49:51.120 --> 03:49:57.120]  Although Palantir has a program called PRISM, and although its function is exactly like that shown in the slide,
[03:49:57.120 --> 03:49:59.120]  they have denied the allegations.
[03:49:59.120 --> 03:50:03.120]  The company, Palantir, was created with funding from Incutel,
[03:50:03.120 --> 03:50:09.120]  a venture capital company created by the CIA, and with funding from PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel.
[03:50:09.120 --> 03:50:13.120]  Palantir's CEO Alexander Karp is also from PayPal.
[03:50:13.120 --> 03:50:19.120]  Both Thiel and Karp were attendees at Bilderberg this year as they focused on big data.
[03:50:19.120 --> 03:50:24.120]  Palantir company profiles from the Wall Street Journal in 2009 and Business Week in 2011
[03:50:24.120 --> 03:50:31.120]  emphasized Palantir's connection to the military industrial complex and to data mining for terrorist profiling.
[03:50:31.120 --> 03:50:37.120]  Palantir self-consciously emphasizes to its employees its connection to Middle Earth mythology.
[03:50:37.120 --> 03:50:42.120]  Whether or not Palantir's PRISM program is THE PRISM program, Palantir was created by the CIA.
[03:50:42.120 --> 03:50:45.120]  OK, and you can see the rest of that report on YouTube.
[03:50:45.120 --> 03:50:51.120]  And again, the name of that report is PayPal's NSA involvement being covered up.
[03:50:51.120 --> 03:51:20.120]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back on the Alex Jones radio show.
[03:51:21.120 --> 03:51:23.120]  Thanks for watching.
[03:51:52.120 --> 03:51:58.120]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[03:51:58.120 --> 03:52:02.120]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[03:52:02.120 --> 03:52:06.120]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[03:52:06.120 --> 03:52:11.120]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks and head-to-head fitness tests.
[03:52:11.120 --> 03:52:13.120]  How is this even possible?
[03:52:13.120 --> 03:52:18.120]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor formula.
[03:52:18.120 --> 03:52:24.120]  The old guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated mountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[03:52:24.120 --> 03:52:32.120]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[03:52:32.120 --> 03:52:35.120]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[03:52:35.120 --> 03:52:43.120]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[03:52:43.120 --> 03:52:46.120]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[03:52:46.120 --> 03:52:52.120]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to greens75.com.
[03:52:52.120 --> 03:52:57.120]  That's greens75.com. Greens75.com.
[03:52:57.120 --> 03:53:05.120]  Are you tired of commuting to a job that makes someone else rich, working harder than ever, but getting nowhere?

[03:53:57.120 --> 03:54:16.120]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and in this last segment of the show, I want to illustrate for you how Chris Christie and Debbie Wasserman Schultz,
[03:54:16.120 --> 03:54:22.120]  the DNC chairwoman who is covering for Hillary Clinton, how they are exactly clones of each other.
[03:54:22.120 --> 03:54:29.120]  And I'll get to those quotes in just a moment. Before we do real quickly, let me tell you that we've got a sale going on right now.
[03:54:29.120 --> 03:54:36.120]  If you buy Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine, you can get Silver Bullet for 50% off and get a free calendar.

[03:55:06.120 --> 03:55:12.120]  And it is a limited first run. It removes over 200 contaminants from shower water, including things like heavy metal.
[03:55:12.120 --> 03:55:16.120]  You know the stuff that the EPA blew up out of the gold mine and went into the water three states.
[03:55:16.120 --> 03:55:18.120]  You can get that out of your water too.
[03:55:18.120 --> 03:55:23.120]  Remember fluoride that they dump in intentionally and charge you to dump in? You can get that out.
[03:55:23.120 --> 03:55:28.120]  Pesticides, VOCs, chlorine, pharmaceuticals, as well as odors.
[03:55:28.120 --> 03:55:33.120]  It has a filtration capacity of up to nine months. It is made from BPA-free plastic.
[03:55:33.120 --> 03:55:40.120]  Very easy to install, available exclusively for a limited time at infowarsstore.com.
[03:55:40.120 --> 03:55:46.120]  Now, just real quickly before I go to the story about Chris Christie and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[03:55:46.120 --> 03:55:51.120]  As I was talking about the Palantir thing, as you heard in that report, it just absolutely amazed me.
[03:55:51.120 --> 03:55:56.120]  When I looked at this, they're very, very self-conscious about their references to the Lord of the Rings.
[03:55:56.120 --> 03:56:02.120]  They have t-shirts, Save the Shire, the Palantir logo, which is that crystal ball.
[03:56:02.120 --> 03:56:12.120]  And, of course, they say that it is the biggest seller of anything there, and Palo Alto is driving out all the paraphernalia that's sold by companies like Patagonia.
[03:56:12.120 --> 03:56:14.120]  They have more stuff there from Palantir.
[03:56:14.120 --> 03:56:19.120]  And, of course, it's not just the souvenirs and the marketing stuff that's being driven out.
[03:56:19.120 --> 03:56:25.120]  It says that they're also driving out other startups in Palo Alto because they've got so much money.
[03:56:25.120 --> 03:56:30.120]  These people were started by the CIA, their venture capital firm Incutel.
[03:56:30.120 --> 03:56:39.120]  And, of course, it started up by some people who were there at the beginning of PayPal and people who are now regular Bilderberg attendees.
[03:56:39.120 --> 03:56:46.120]  And as I pointed out in that special report back in 2013, they were there at Bilderberg talking about big data.
[03:56:46.120 --> 03:56:52.120]  Well, they analyzed big data for people, and they also choke out other businesses.
[03:56:52.120 --> 03:56:54.120]  And that's what's happening to our country.
[03:56:54.120 --> 03:57:02.120]  So, how much money is being put into the defense-military-industrial complex that we are choking out productive investment?
[03:57:02.120 --> 03:57:07.120]  I saw elements of that even when I started as an engineer 35 years ago.
[03:57:07.120 --> 03:57:18.120]  I could see that it was a military spending that was choking out things that could have made us competitive with other countries, could have improved our standard of living, being poured into weapons to kill people.
[03:57:18.120 --> 03:57:22.120]  And, of course, you can say it could be used to defend people as well. I understand.
[03:57:22.120 --> 03:57:26.120]  There's a political dimension of it, though, whether it's being used to kill or defend.
[03:57:26.120 --> 03:57:32.120]  And I'm not happy with what I've seen the political convention for the last 35 years.
[03:57:32.120 --> 03:57:35.120]  Now, before I run out of time, I want to read you a couple of quotes here.
[03:57:35.120 --> 03:57:38.120]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz was called on the carpet by her supporters.
[03:57:38.120 --> 03:57:42.120]  She said she's still supporting the war on drugs attack against marijuana.
[03:57:42.120 --> 03:57:45.120]  They're not saying we want to get rid of prohibition completely.
[03:57:45.120 --> 03:57:51.120]  They just say, why are you still supporting throwing people in jail for marijuana usage?
[03:57:51.120 --> 03:57:54.120]  She says this. She says, I'm protective.
[03:57:54.120 --> 03:57:57.120]  Safety has been my top legislative priority.
[03:57:57.120 --> 03:58:01.120]  I'm driven by the idea that safety is the core function of government.
[03:58:01.120 --> 03:58:06.120]  And when they talk to Chris Christie about guns, he says, well, you know, I'm all about safety.
[03:58:06.120 --> 03:58:08.120]  I'm for public safety.
[03:58:08.120 --> 03:58:14.120]  When you sell your freedom for safety, you wind up an unsafe slave.
[03:58:14.120 --> 03:58:24.120]  That's what you need to understand. And people on the left and the right need to understand how they're being played in both the war against guns and the war against drugs.
[03:58:24.120 --> 03:58:25.120]  They're both phony folks.
[03:58:25.120 --> 03:58:45.120]  Join us tonight for the Info Wars Nightly News, 7 central 8 p.m. Eastern.
