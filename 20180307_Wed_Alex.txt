[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:12.160 --> 00:21.360]  the Info War and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:21.360 --> 00:25.680]  Absolutely huge breaking news today, stacks of news today.
[00:25.680 --> 00:32.760]  You've got Seattle going full libtard, a judge saying that your car is now your home
[00:32.760 --> 00:35.360]  so it can't be impounded, so just park it anywhere.
[00:35.360 --> 00:37.680]  They're confiscating guns in Seattle now.
[00:37.680 --> 00:43.720]  If somebody calls the cops and says you look weird, you've got a teenager in Utah who tried
[00:43.720 --> 00:50.840]  to detonate a bomb at Pineview School and you've got Attorney General Jeff Sessions
[00:50.840 --> 00:55.000]  with a pulse all of a sudden, somebody shocked him back to life and he's calling out sanctuary
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.400]  cities as they are now being sued with interference over immigration enforcement.
[01:01.400 --> 01:04.840]  Now Alex, you've got all of these stacks of news going on.
[01:04.840 --> 01:11.240]  Meanwhile, the fake news, CNN continues to desperately try to attack President Trump
[01:11.240 --> 01:12.240]  with lies.
[01:12.240 --> 01:17.000]  They bring some drunk on air to try to use him as a story maker.
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.360]  I mean, the desperation right now from the fake news and the deep state is really starting
[01:21.360 --> 01:22.360]  to show itself.
[01:22.360 --> 01:26.480]  Well, I've got to tell you, overall we're winning trying to bring prosperity and basic
[01:26.480 --> 01:32.000]  justice back, but drawing out the globalist and their minions really has made me sick
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.120]  and let me know that they're worse than I even thought they were and the disease that
[01:37.120 --> 01:41.880]  was in the head of the fish has now reached all the way down to the tail and we are just
[01:41.880 --> 01:44.480]  up against incredible times.
[01:44.480 --> 01:51.960]  If the Democrats think that these moderate trade sanctions are going to destroy Trump,
[01:51.960 --> 01:55.880]  well then they would be all for it and they wouldn't be breathlessly fighting it as hard
[01:55.880 --> 02:01.480]  as they could, but they know that Europe has unfair internal tariffs against us, regulatory
[02:01.480 --> 02:02.480]  tariffs.
[02:02.480 --> 02:05.080]  They know that China has them.
[02:05.080 --> 02:07.040]  They know that Japan has gotten better.
[02:07.040 --> 02:08.440]  They've made a lot of good deals in the US.
[02:08.440 --> 02:11.760]  They've moved a lot of big factories here because they understand that they need a market to
[02:11.760 --> 02:12.760]  trade with.
[02:12.760 --> 02:14.240]  The Japanese get it.
[02:14.240 --> 02:17.240]  China is being very, very adversarial.
[02:17.240 --> 02:23.800]  Mexico, these are all one-sided deals designed to galed, designed to castrate the United
[02:23.800 --> 02:24.800]  States.
[02:24.800 --> 02:30.240]  You've got Cohn leaving, well look, we got the tax cuts, that's done, he's gone, but
[02:30.240 --> 02:32.960]  they are trying to destabilize the White House, I think the White House.
[02:32.960 --> 02:37.240]  For the first time in 14, 15 months he is in crisis and we'll talk about some of that
[02:37.240 --> 02:42.440]  coming up with Stormy Daniels and all the things going on with that and with all the
[02:42.440 --> 02:48.880]  different moles that are inside there, but it is just a crazy time to be alive and to
[02:48.880 --> 02:56.240]  see CNN and to see all these Democratic party groups and all these organizations coming
[02:56.240 --> 03:02.160]  after free speech, trying to shut us down, it shows you what authoritarian they are and
[03:02.160 --> 03:08.120]  it's very, very sad that this is the awful truth that we face and then when they fail
[03:08.120 --> 03:11.720]  to remove our channel after four false strikes, there's still one on there that's frozen
[03:11.720 --> 03:14.520]  us being able to do live streams from that account.
[03:14.520 --> 03:19.640]  They then say it's all a hoax and they'll watch some posts and they say, Joe shot videos
[03:19.640 --> 03:24.640]  from his home to make it look like he couldn't work from the studio, but it's all fake, no
[03:24.640 --> 03:26.400]  one's trying to shut him down.
[03:26.400 --> 03:31.600]  With the lawsuits and CNN saying take down our channels and peppy the frog lawsuit and
[03:31.600 --> 03:37.880]  the real news situation and on and on and on, the Communist Party suing us, you cannot
[03:37.880 --> 03:42.200]  make this up for the listeners know that we're good, we're honest, we're decent, we're trying
[03:42.200 --> 03:46.280]  to build a better future just like they are and that's why we're all under attack, but
[03:46.280 --> 03:51.280]  realize we're under attack because we echo the sentiment of the American people who are
[03:51.280 --> 03:55.480]  basic good Christians or free market folks and that's why we're under attack.
[03:55.480 --> 03:58.720]  So I'm very, very honored with you on the rest of the crew to be in this position,
[03:58.720 --> 04:02.960]  but this is very, very serious situation and they are so angry, the economy's coming back.
[04:02.960 --> 04:10.680]  We have a record Democrat turnout in the primary and of course they're famous for having people
[04:10.680 --> 04:14.280]  vote in the names of dead people, so we've really, really got to watch coming up in the
[04:14.280 --> 04:18.720]  general election just like we saw with the situation in Alabama where they said that
[04:18.720 --> 04:22.880]  he was 15 points behind but only lost by a half point and we know they brought in Democrats
[04:22.880 --> 04:27.520]  from all over to vote off voter registration rolls, so if your grandmother or grandfather
[04:27.520 --> 04:32.360]  or father or mother or brother or sister recently died, you've got to go through the procedure
[04:32.360 --> 04:36.040]  to get them off the voting rolls, you've got to talk to the county, you've got to go make
[04:36.040 --> 04:40.480]  sure that no one votes in their name this year to see their names on the roll, now you've
[04:40.480 --> 04:44.320]  got to, I'm not saying Republicans should go vote in the name of their dead family member,
[04:44.320 --> 04:48.480]  I'm just saying the Democrats are having people vote on average, Project Veritas caught this
[04:48.480 --> 04:54.040]  ten times, they said on average that they would have people vote ten times, they caught
[04:54.040 --> 04:58.840]  them five times on tape, so this is massive news information, straight ahead on the other
[04:58.840 --> 05:00.880]  side I've got a whole raft of issues here.
[05:00.880 --> 05:07.240]  I'm so excited, the new product at infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled
[05:07.240 --> 05:14.400]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red bill, this is a heart and brain pill,
[05:14.400 --> 05:19.560]  a new tropic, it doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's
[05:19.560 --> 05:25.840]  beyond that, quite frankly I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to
[05:25.840 --> 05:30.960]  their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people a hundred, two
[05:30.960 --> 05:34.920]  hundred dollars for the formulae, and I came up with our own formulae working with some
[05:34.920 --> 05:41.800]  scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies
[05:41.800 --> 05:47.160]  and gentlemen, you add the preglenone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones
[05:47.160 --> 05:53.720]  that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands, it is amazing.
[05:53.720 --> 06:06.520]  Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[06:06.520 --> 06:15.280]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation, it's Olin Shroyer,
[06:15.280 --> 06:21.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:21.000 --> 06:26.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are literally in the fight for our lives right now.
[06:26.280 --> 06:31.520]  And when we overturned the tables and elected President Trump, who's not a member of the
[06:31.520 --> 06:37.120]  secret society, who's not out to get you, who's not out to destroy America, we forced
[06:37.120 --> 06:44.400]  the Democrats and the deep state and the globalist to go full bore and show their true colors
[06:44.400 --> 06:52.520]  as anti-American, open border, anti-white, anti-family, anti-Christian, liars, racists
[06:52.520 --> 06:54.200]  at the end of the day.
[06:54.200 --> 06:59.680]  And so here we are with all of these stacks of news to try to alert the American people
[06:59.680 --> 07:01.880]  about what's going on.
[07:01.880 --> 07:07.240]  But Alex, the desperation is really starting to show right now in the eyes of the globalist,
[07:07.240 --> 07:10.880]  in the eyes of the deep state, they're sending their minions out in the street, they're sending
[07:10.880 --> 07:13.720]  their minions out to vote.
[07:13.720 --> 07:17.240]  We are really in the fight for our lives right now, Alex, and I know you're on vacation,
[07:17.240 --> 07:21.360]  but you cannot take a break because this is truly just the most incredible time to be
[07:21.360 --> 07:22.360]  alive.
[07:22.360 --> 07:23.360]  Well, that's right.
[07:23.360 --> 07:26.240]  A lot of listeners have asked, Alex, if they're trying to shut down your channels and trying
[07:26.240 --> 07:29.440]  to kick you off the radio, and we see them all over the news, you're basically sitting
[07:29.440 --> 07:32.640]  at rest, you kill you, whatever, why'd you take off a weekend?
[07:32.640 --> 07:36.720]  I hardly ever take off, I promised my middle daughter, especially had never really seen
[07:36.720 --> 07:37.720]  real snow.
[07:37.720 --> 07:41.200]  You know, we see a little bit of ice on the ground here and there that I'd take her to
[07:41.200 --> 07:45.440]  Brata, so she could see snow, and boy, she'd get to see it, they've had record snow here
[07:45.440 --> 07:48.760]  in many areas this year, so it's like five feet on the ground where we're at.
[07:48.760 --> 07:54.280]  But I'm here fighting for my family, for my children, just like everybody else, and
[07:54.280 --> 08:01.960]  I cannot understate, I cannot overstate just how insane these people are and how bullying
[08:01.960 --> 08:06.480]  they are and how authoritarian they are and how deceptive they are.
[08:06.480 --> 08:08.680]  They are not leftist.
[08:08.680 --> 08:12.560]  They are gangsters, and when I look at the history of the United States and the world,
[08:12.560 --> 08:18.920]  if you had told me 10 years ago or 20 years ago that Info Wars would be one of the biggest
[08:18.920 --> 08:24.000]  radio shows in the world, one of the biggest news sites in the world, and that CNN would
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.880]  be lobbying to have you taken off the air, that CNN would be trying to get it shut down,
[08:28.880 --> 08:34.360]  trying to block books from being published, would be going and contacting sponsors individually
[08:34.360 --> 08:40.360]  harassing them in gangster techniques, just as Breitmark got it right and said, CNN goes
[08:40.360 --> 08:41.360]  full gangster.
[08:41.360 --> 08:48.040]  If you had told me that if we sold somebody's painting, that painted images of the campaign
[08:48.040 --> 08:55.560]  in 2016, and there was a frog filling up maybe 5% of the total poster, that I'd be sued and
[08:55.560 --> 09:02.600]  the Democratic Party would be funding it, or any of this, or just wild, fake EEOC complaints,
[09:02.600 --> 09:06.880]  all of it in one weekend, it's a total complete message to not us, they know we're not giving
[09:06.880 --> 09:11.400]  up, it's a message to all of you, they think you're cowards, and they think you'll see
[09:11.400 --> 09:15.920]  this happening to us, and go, hey, we better roll over to political correctness, they won't
[09:15.920 --> 09:21.640]  just call us racist, they won't just call us Russian spies, they will try to destroy
[09:21.640 --> 09:26.920]  us, folks, they're going to destroy you if you let them win, they've got your children
[09:26.920 --> 09:31.480]  in the schools, they've got the television, they've got the culture, but now we've forced
[09:31.480 --> 09:36.000]  them out, and Jimmy Kimmel said that mainstream media's ratings were plunging into the Netflix,
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.720]  Netflix is mainly mainstream media, Hollywood's imploding, the NFL's imploding, they went
[09:41.720 --> 09:45.840]  down 15 points with the Take a Knee thing this year and last year, that's what's killing
[09:45.840 --> 09:50.800]  them, is people are sick of the crud, it's the same numbers all over the world, every
[09:50.800 --> 09:58.600]  populist candidate has basically won the last three years globally against the centralized
[09:58.600 --> 10:05.800]  tyrants, and they even blamed Italy that elected 50 plus percent populist candidates
[10:05.800 --> 10:12.360]  in a parliamentary situation, that is a mega landslide, the Democratic Party was taken
[10:12.360 --> 10:16.840]  from dominant to one of the weakest parties out of eight major parties, more than 20 parties
[10:16.840 --> 10:23.320]  total, but eight major power parties, they were taken to the lowest room with basically
[10:23.320 --> 10:29.520]  no power, our media and Barack Obama came out and said that's Russian influence, and
[10:29.520 --> 10:35.800]  Obama surrogates, Samantha Powers the rest of them came out and said it is Russians,
[10:35.800 --> 10:39.720]  so the Russians are winning in Austria, the Russians are winning in Italy, the Russians
[10:39.720 --> 10:45.000]  are winning in Catalan, they're winning in Reykjavik, they're winning in Brazil, no,
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.640]  no ladies and gentlemen, it's not the Russians winning in the Czech Republic and Hungary
[10:48.640 --> 10:56.600]  and Romania, it's 10 million military H-men that have poured in the last six years, running
[10:56.600 --> 11:01.760]  around screaming Allah Akbar, raping, killing, bombing, and if the citizens say anything
[11:01.760 --> 11:05.880]  or the police say anything, they're arrested, so people understand this is a globalist take
[11:05.880 --> 11:11.840]  down of the west, and a pincer attack with the left on one side, and Jeff Bezos the richest
[11:11.840 --> 11:15.920]  man in the world, and Carlos Slim right behind him, and all the kingpins openly pushing the
[11:15.920 --> 11:21.800]  implosion of our borders, culture warfare, they're all tax-exempt and bringing in giant
[11:21.800 --> 11:26.400]  third world populations to drive down wages and complete our journey into abject slavers,
[11:26.400 --> 11:31.560]  so we're going to talk about all of this here today, and I'm going to go over some of the
[11:31.560 --> 11:35.840]  big news, the good news, the bad news, the ugly news, but I would say Trump is in crisis
[11:35.840 --> 11:40.920]  because Americans are instant gratification, and after 14, 15 months all the good things
[11:40.920 --> 11:46.320]  that have happened, numbers show a lot of conservatives and libertarians are going back to sleep. Right
[11:46.320 --> 11:50.680]  as the Democrat globalist counter-offensive is coming into full swing. Now, ladies and
[11:50.680 --> 11:54.640]  gentlemen, that said, before we go to all this news, I just mentioned, the good, the
[11:54.640 --> 12:01.000]  bad, the ugly, we are extending because support is critical right now. I've got a counter
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.560]  sue, at least five of these groups. I've got a lot of lawyers that are top lawyers,
[12:04.560 --> 12:08.080]  I'm going to do a pro bono, but I've got to pay for plane tickets, I've got to pay for
[12:08.080 --> 12:13.120]  people to take the transcripts, I've got to pay for the PIs, I've got to pay for all
[12:13.120 --> 12:18.680]  of it to very aggressively go after some of these groups and people. By the way, we have
[12:18.680 --> 12:23.960]  open and shut cases, but it will take a year to even begin to win these, but this is a
[12:23.960 --> 12:29.360]  lot of folks know, you follow a frivolous lawsuit on me. I'm counter suing you, and
[12:29.360 --> 12:33.760]  I'm coming after you. Everybody wants me to sue for years. You have my word, listeners,
[12:33.760 --> 12:38.000]  my word. We've just been letting these build up to get the very best ones. We have them
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.760]  now with a slapback provisions, everything. We have them, which my lawyers say shows
[12:42.760 --> 12:47.280]  how crazy the Democrats are because they admit the party's funding this and they don't even
[12:47.280 --> 12:52.560]  care if they lose. This is how maniac crazy these folks are. It doesn't matter though.
[12:52.560 --> 12:57.200]  I'm going to personally get these things thrown out and then I'm going to sue these individuals,
[12:57.200 --> 13:01.720]  the puppets, because that's who we've got to send a message to right afterwards. So
[13:01.720 --> 13:06.240]  it's on ladies and gentlemen, but we need the funding flood us with the donations by
[13:06.240 --> 13:10.520]  the products. You name it, we make it easy. We have the very best products, ladies and
[13:10.520 --> 13:15.040]  gentlemen, and we've got 30 to 80% off. We've never done 80% off sale before. The average
[13:15.040 --> 13:19.680]  product 50% off very close to loss leaders. We have store wide free shipping, whether
[13:19.680 --> 13:24.920]  it's brain force, the amazing new tropic, super male vitality, super female vitality,
[13:24.920 --> 13:31.320]  whether it is the new alpha power that is amazing, super blue toothpaste, a limited
[13:31.320 --> 13:34.840]  supply came in, a bigger supply is coming in about a month and a half, our Floyd's free
[13:34.840 --> 13:40.960]  toothpaste. That is all free shipping store wide and 30 to 80% off. If you have to understand
[13:40.960 --> 13:45.400]  at 80% off, those are complete and total loss leaders. We put out hundreds and hundreds
[13:45.400 --> 13:49.160]  of t-shirts. Most of them sell out. We've had a lot that look really great, but that
[13:49.160 --> 13:52.640]  folks just didn't notice or didn't see or didn't find because the shopping cart is
[13:52.640 --> 13:56.960]  so big and the online store is so big now and for store.com that a lot of these are
[13:56.960 --> 14:04.520]  really some of my favorite shirts that are below cost. When a t-shirt's 80% off, we're
[14:04.520 --> 14:08.000]  talking, I'm losing two or three bucks on those, so a great way to spread the word,
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.160]  free speech, every little bit you do stands against these people, but we have the best
[14:12.160 --> 14:18.160]  deals ever. We have a support button at infowarstore.com. Click on that. You can make donations.
[14:18.160 --> 14:21.240]  I want to thank all of you that have made donations. I want to thank you all for standing
[14:21.240 --> 14:26.400]  up for your own family, not just me, but I have been mobbed at the airport flying out
[14:26.400 --> 14:31.760]  of the airport in Denver and now at the little lodge we're staying at. Mobbed, but almost
[14:31.760 --> 14:35.960]  everybody we talk to listens a couple times a month or a couple times a week. They weren't
[14:35.960 --> 14:40.480]  even aware of the censorship. Once they heard it, they were shocked and amazed. That's the
[14:40.480 --> 14:45.200]  issue is most of our listeners are already awake. They already know what's going in.
[14:45.200 --> 14:50.600]  They tune in sometimes, but they just think we're a rock that's always going to be there.
[14:50.600 --> 14:54.800]  All of our freedoms are being eroded by these tyrants. Now is the time to get really aggressive
[14:54.800 --> 15:00.360]  and really upset and really angry and focused and we can completely turn the tide, but they're
[15:00.360 --> 15:04.720]  trying to break Trump. They're trying to break info wars. They're trying to destroy Drudge.
[15:04.720 --> 15:09.600]  Drudge is the only organization that stood up for us along with the listeners in the
[15:09.600 --> 15:13.680]  first week and a half of this attack, the sub-president attack that's on everybody, by the way, and
[15:13.680 --> 15:17.320]  that was not just us. They're using us as the poster child, but now Breitbart's doing
[15:17.320 --> 15:21.400]  the right thing and saying this is criminal racketeering. They've talked to their lawyers
[15:21.400 --> 15:28.000]  that CNN's involved in. This is it, folks. This is racketeering. Imagine the magnitude
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.120]  of what they're doing. When we come back, I'm going to cover some news, but it's now
[15:32.120 --> 15:37.280]  time to get aggressive or we'll lose everything. Every other nation has fallen into this communism,
[15:37.280 --> 15:42.320]  this socialism, this race-based politics. The president and vice president and defense
[15:42.320 --> 15:45.960]  minister of South Africa are now announcing they're going to take all in from whites and
[15:45.960 --> 15:49.840]  slaughter them. Just last week, they said we may slaughter them. This week, they said
[15:49.840 --> 15:55.200]  we will kill all the whites. It's happening all over Africa right now. And again, we'll
[15:55.200 --> 15:59.560]  be right back and Breit called us down.

[18:13.440 --> 18:17.960]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans. We have

[19:00.080 --> 19:06.400]  I want to plow into all of this. I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[19:06.400 --> 19:12.800]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[19:12.800 --> 19:20.720]  or videos or other material from InfowarsStore.com, you are funding the revolution. I cannot
[19:20.720 --> 19:25.800]  say it any clearer. And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfowarsStore.com.

[19:29.640 --> 19:34.800]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine. And you cannot beat that for

[19:46.400 --> 19:51.240]  products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists

[19:54.920 --> 20:03.560]  are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[20:03.560 --> 20:12.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:12.880 --> 20:29.080]  Well, it's a good thing that Infowars is now live 10 hours a day, because there's so much
[20:29.080 --> 20:34.760]  news it's impossible to do it in just four hours. Oh, and Troy, you're here filling in
[20:34.760 --> 20:38.320]  for Alex Jones. We've got Alex on the line with us. I mean, just to go over some of the
[20:38.320 --> 20:45.080]  stuff that you've got. You've got a Utah teenager attempts to detonate an explosive at a high
[20:45.080 --> 20:53.560]  school. You've got Seattle going left of Mao confiscating guns, saying you cannot impound
[20:53.560 --> 20:58.280]  a car that's parked illegally if it's considered a person's home. I mean, can you imagine the
[20:58.280 --> 21:03.320]  precedent that sets? You've got Jeff Sessions calling out California. And now the DOJ is
[21:03.320 --> 21:08.120]  going to sue California over interference with immigration enforcement. You've got sperm
[21:08.120 --> 21:13.480]  counts down. You've got Facebook about to release new robots. Meanwhile, rage against
[21:13.480 --> 21:17.440]  the machines. Humans are attacking driverless cars in California. I mean, it's all madness.
[21:17.440 --> 21:21.960]  It's all chaotic. Meanwhile, we're trying to restore the Republic, and the left is trying
[21:21.960 --> 21:27.800]  to stop that from happening. Alex, you've been dealing with this your entire 23 year
[21:27.800 --> 21:33.520]  career on air, but I mean, is it obviously the most intense attacks you've ever seen,
[21:33.520 --> 21:38.920]  the most focused? I mean, they're trying harder than ever to shut you down, to demonize us,
[21:38.920 --> 21:43.160]  to dehumanize you. Do you think this is the final push? I mean, how much can these people
[21:43.160 --> 21:44.160]  possibly have left?
[21:44.160 --> 21:49.360]  Well, they have a lot more left. I mean, they say all over the web and all over the place,
[21:49.360 --> 21:53.320]  they want to kill us. They want to kill Trump. They want to kill his family. They want to
[21:53.320 --> 21:57.640]  kill Baron. Trump is our champion. He went through living hell to get in there. He has
[21:57.640 --> 22:02.480]  basically delivered on 60 plus percent of what he said he would do in 14 months. So it's
[22:02.480 --> 22:09.200]  not about a worship fest for Trump. It's about thanking God and thanking our lucky stars
[22:09.200 --> 22:13.080]  for how far we've come. Imagine if Hillary Clinton was in there right now, it's about
[22:13.080 --> 22:18.360]  waking up and staying awake. And I know our audience is the most awake, most focused.
[22:18.360 --> 22:23.160]  That's why they are hated. They are who CNN and George Soros and the love of H. And I'm
[22:23.160 --> 22:28.560]  not just pat them on the back. It's when they call in and thank me, it's unbelievably ridiculous.
[22:28.560 --> 22:33.480]  We're all in this together. You're right beside me. You're behind me. You're in front of me.
[22:33.480 --> 22:37.080]  And they're here and they're doing it. And you know, if you go see a movie like FIFA
[22:37.080 --> 22:42.760]  Vendetta, that is kind of a fictional police state. It models it off some Soviet and slash
[22:42.760 --> 22:49.040]  fascist type deals where they're always trying to scare the public with all the scary news,
[22:49.040 --> 22:52.600]  but then tell them, don't worry, the government will protect you. Well, it's the opposite
[22:52.600 --> 22:58.400]  with Trump and us. Things really are out of control worldwide. Things are accelerating.
[22:58.400 --> 23:02.600]  Every major defense ministry agrees. You've got screen sickness. You've got the sperm
[23:02.600 --> 23:06.880]  counts continuing to plunge. You've got all the computers able to put out fake audio and
[23:06.880 --> 23:12.880]  fake video or they can mimic anybody they want to go next level fake news. You've got
[23:12.880 --> 23:17.840]  genetic engineering. You've got massive mutations, thousands of percentage higher than they were
[23:17.840 --> 23:22.480]  just 20 years ago. You've got radiation levels increasing all over the planet. You've got
[23:22.480 --> 23:30.640]  every major reactor leaking. CNN says 50 plus percent of the world. The UN atomic energy
[23:30.640 --> 23:38.760]  agency says 93%. The point is, it is insane because people don't care anymore. They've
[23:38.760 --> 23:44.160]  had it so good that a paradox begins where they've got it so good because people cared
[23:44.160 --> 23:50.680]  before them and were focused and hardworking and organized. And then the civilization built
[23:50.680 --> 23:54.960]  by the previous people begins to crumble. Then it goes into barbarism. Then it goes into
[23:54.960 --> 23:59.520]  oppression. Then it goes into conquest. And we're now entering that where I don't care
[23:59.520 --> 24:04.920]  of a kid's black, white, Hispanic, who they are. If they're raised in the West, if they're
[24:04.920 --> 24:11.120]  raised in these decadent cultures, they become hateful little spoiled rotten snobs who on
[24:11.120 --> 24:18.120]  average 50 plus percent of millennials want communism, want socialism. And when you say,
[24:18.120 --> 24:23.040]  well, go to Venezuela, go to North Korea, they go, FU, we're going to kill you, right
[24:23.040 --> 24:27.480]  winger. They don't even know that we're classical liberals. We're libertarians. We're the real
[24:27.480 --> 24:32.560]  liberals. All the terms are scrambled. None of it even means anything anymore. Trump is
[24:32.560 --> 24:37.160]  just a pragmatist that wants things good for business and wants a happy country without
[24:37.160 --> 24:43.080]  a bunch of dysfunction because he's super OCD when it comes to everything being running
[24:43.080 --> 24:46.640]  right and being nice and being focused. And that's a good thing. So that's why they're
[24:46.640 --> 24:50.440]  trying to destroy him. Listen, in the, how many years has it been since they found it
[24:50.440 --> 24:55.280]  in North Korea? 1949, 1950, the Communist Chinese through the North helped back them
[24:55.280 --> 25:01.520]  invading the U S with a MacArthur stops it. Here we are ceasefire. They've only had four
[25:01.520 --> 25:07.360]  meetings since then with a delegation from the South to the North, never in Kim Jong
[25:07.360 --> 25:12.640]  Un's lane. But the last what five, six years now, Trump has brought him to the table where
[25:12.640 --> 25:17.080]  he met with the head of intelligence from South Korea and others. Unprecedented. None
[25:17.080 --> 25:21.400]  of our media said Trump forced him to the table, our military forced him to the table.
[25:21.400 --> 25:26.160]  Well, just a few months ago, they were shooting, you know, ICBMs all over the place, threatening
[25:26.160 --> 25:31.200]  to preemptively attack us. So you've got that. The only folks being honest about Trump and
[25:31.200 --> 25:35.720]  his trade deals is Barclays. They've got top analysts saying, no, these are one sided
[25:35.720 --> 25:41.600]  deals with China, one sided deals with the EU. Yes, China is only 67% of the steel production,
[25:41.600 --> 25:47.120]  but they're ramping up to be 20, 30% in a year. It will kill what's left of us. So when
[25:47.120 --> 25:51.400]  Trump meets with the aluminum and steel manufacturers, when we are a shadow of what we were in the
[25:51.400 --> 25:58.000]  fifties or sixties, it is about survival for strategic national security. And the military
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.280]  told Trump this, that we keep some of those damn steel production facilities. Excuse
[26:03.280 --> 26:08.280]  me. I just, it makes me so angry at some aluminum. We're about to have nothing, nothing, nothing,
[26:08.280 --> 26:15.600]  nothing, nothing, nothing. Let's say it again, nothing, nothing. China is ramping up to totally
[26:15.600 --> 26:20.480]  deindustrialize us. And Trump is just, he's almost like a speed bump to the new world
[26:20.480 --> 26:24.640]  order. He's almost just kind of like a softer landing for us going into slavery. All the
[26:24.640 --> 26:28.960]  big corporations are already moving to China. They've gone 0% tax. Apple is merging with
[26:28.960 --> 26:35.400]  them to surveil the American people. Mainstream news, no one even cares. This is red level.
[26:35.400 --> 26:39.960]  China, if you don't work, kills you. These average leftists love it. They flop around
[26:39.960 --> 26:45.440]  lazily going, screw you, Alex Jones, screw you, Trump, screw you, America. But they
[26:45.440 --> 26:49.560]  love our honey. They love our milk and honey to quote Merle Haggard. Maybe we should come
[26:49.560 --> 26:54.040]  in with, walk it on the fight inside of me next segment, but that's what this comes down
[26:54.040 --> 26:58.680]  to. And then we should probably show some of this video from the CBS news report out
[26:58.680 --> 27:02.080]  of New York when we come back. I'll do a few more minutes with you. Fake TV, where they
[27:02.080 --> 27:07.720]  show Barack Obama's face in an example, which is computer programs anybody can buy now,
[27:07.720 --> 27:12.560]  saying things he never said. It would take Hollywood months to engineer that 20 years
[27:12.560 --> 27:18.360]  ago or 30 years ago for Forrest Gump. They can create fake video and fake audio. You
[27:18.360 --> 27:23.600]  can create fake video in hours that's undistinguishable from reality. You can create fake audio in
[27:23.600 --> 27:31.600]  minutes. You can buy it, the software for $5,000. So that's what I'm saying is, if mainstream
[27:31.600 --> 27:35.480]  media has already shown they're fake news kings and will lie about all this stuff, we're
[27:35.480 --> 27:40.480]  only weeks away, I think, from them having videos of us hiling Hitler, worshiping Satan,
[27:40.480 --> 27:45.120]  you name it, because they are so evil, they will put out fake videos on us and then say
[27:45.120 --> 27:49.160]  we did it and call for Lynch mobs to come after us. If you follow the continuum of force
[27:49.160 --> 27:53.680]  historically, they always do it like this. So when they build it up, they demonize, they
[27:53.680 --> 27:58.480]  lie about you, they sue you, they try to silence you, then they try to arrest you or have you
[27:58.480 --> 28:02.720]  killed. And when I say that, I am absolutely deadly serious, Owen Schreuer.
[28:02.720 --> 28:06.840]  Well, and the thing is, their minions, their street minions will buy anything. I mean,
[28:06.840 --> 28:10.400]  they believe this Russian collusion, they think Trump is Hitler, so they will believe
[28:10.400 --> 28:15.160]  anything. And you've already seen radical leftists go out in the streets, professors
[28:15.160 --> 28:19.880]  attacking people with bike locks, you had the man go down to the baseball practice,
[28:19.880 --> 28:25.280]  the GOP baseball practice and shoot that up. So you've got radical leftists getting more
[28:25.280 --> 28:28.640]  violent, getting more hate filled, that will believe anything.
[28:28.640 --> 28:32.680]  And leftist areas of Austin, they all look like their brain dead. They look like reanimated
[28:32.680 --> 28:36.960]  corpses. They're all completely bombed out of their brains on drugs. They're partying
[28:36.960 --> 28:39.920]  all the time. They don't know what planet they're on. And then they see you and it's
[28:39.920 --> 28:43.400]  like a video game. They think they're allowed to come over and get in your face. And as
[28:43.400 --> 28:46.800]  soon as you get back in their face, they get upset and say, how dare you? They're totally
[28:46.800 --> 28:52.240]  living in fantasy lands and they're dangerous, dangerous, dangerous people. And thank God,
[28:52.240 --> 28:57.440]  this is America, the only other country like Switzerland where our four bears brought us
[28:57.440 --> 28:59.840]  out of tyranny. We were born out of fighting tyranny.

[30:04.640 --> 30:07.600]  instead of going with those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced
[30:07.600 --> 30:12.320]  personally. From all the wives, tales and every culture, we know that the bones have
[30:12.320 --> 30:16.760]  the essence. We know chicken noodle soup. It's great for people that are sick. Again,
[30:16.760 --> 30:23.240]  in every culture, this has been reported because it works. And there's no way to quantify
[30:23.240 --> 30:28.360]  how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount
[30:28.360 --> 30:34.200]  of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[30:34.200 --> 30:38.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and
[30:38.040 --> 30:42.440]  your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and
[30:42.440 --> 30:50.240]  gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there. And it's amazing.
[30:50.240 --> 30:54.520]  Find out for yourself today at infowarsstore.com. What it can do for your family. And again,
[30:54.520 --> 31:00.320]  I want to thank you all for your support. You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[31:00.320 --> 31:04.640]  Infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. We have found extraordinary
[31:04.640 --> 31:09.880]  new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear
[31:09.880 --> 31:15.160]  nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
[31:15.160 --> 31:20.280]  This is pollen blood. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain
[31:20.280 --> 31:25.600]  quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny
[31:25.600 --> 31:31.560]  nose, itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus production. They began studying the effects
[31:31.560 --> 31:37.520]  in their published trials. Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable
[31:37.520 --> 31:43.480]  tablet, just two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen
[31:43.480 --> 31:48.920]  block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress. Enjoy the
[31:48.920 --> 31:55.000]  air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block available now at infowarslife.com

[32:07.400 --> 32:12.560]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially
[32:12.560 --> 32:19.200]  formulated prebiotic fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit and flax
[32:19.200 --> 32:25.960]  fiber. Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria,
[32:25.960 --> 32:32.480]  which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients and even support your immune system. Infowarslife's
[32:32.480 --> 32:39.000]  cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality, organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[32:39.000 --> 32:43.920]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium
[32:43.920 --> 32:50.840]  organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon
[32:50.840 --> 32:59.000]  for maximum prebiotic effect. Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[33:30.000 --> 33:36.000]  That's right. Oh, and in the studios, in the ATX, we've taken over here about five minutes.
[33:36.000 --> 33:39.720]  He's got a lot of breaking news, a lot of video clips, a lot of key things to get into,
[33:39.720 --> 33:45.840]  but here's the bottom line. We're witnessing massive historical things happen in positive
[33:45.840 --> 33:51.520]  ways, in very amazing ways, in miraculous ways. We're discovering the secrets of the
[33:51.520 --> 33:58.960]  universe. So many amazing things are happening, but at the same time, IQs are dropping, fertility
[33:58.960 --> 34:05.680]  is dropping, people are more lazy. Every metric shows that this civilization, just like space
[34:05.680 --> 34:10.800]  travel, no gravity, destroys the mind, destroys the body. And then you've got the globalists
[34:10.800 --> 34:15.400]  in all their major statements and white papers admitting they've given up on us, and that's
[34:15.400 --> 34:18.800]  putting it kindly. I don't think they've ever believed in us. And they're just saying,
[34:18.800 --> 34:23.200]  let's just exacerbate all this, let's accelerate the collapse, and then build a new civilization
[34:23.200 --> 34:27.760]  on top of it. But then I look at the globalists, they're the most inbred, hateful, twisted,
[34:27.760 --> 34:33.320]  evil people, the most selfish people I've ever seen, and they're the ones creating
[34:33.320 --> 34:38.720]  all the out-of-control, genetically engineered systems. They're the ones with all the leaking
[34:38.720 --> 34:43.320]  reactors. They're the ones that seem like they actually just want to destroy the planet.
[34:43.320 --> 34:46.680]  So their whole statement about building a world government to stop war and build this
[34:46.680 --> 34:52.920]  utopia, that's for the mid-level minions under them, the PhDs and others of academia
[34:52.920 --> 34:57.560]  at the highest level to actually man this system. That's why I'm so frustrated. This
[34:57.560 --> 35:02.960]  is an admitted breakaway civilization, a technocracy. I told people that 20 years ago because
[35:02.960 --> 35:08.200]  it was in their own reports. Now, about three years ago, they said from Davos, we're a technocracy.
[35:08.200 --> 35:12.400]  We believe in appointing presidents and prime ministers, and we believe in cutting off goods
[35:12.400 --> 35:16.800]  to the public. They're lazy and stupid, and we believe in austerity. Now, that's the
[35:16.800 --> 35:21.160]  statements they make publicly. You walk into a Whole Foods, they got magazines and stuff
[35:21.160 --> 35:25.000]  everywhere about austerity, how fun it is to be poor, but then it's owned by a guy that
[35:25.000 --> 35:29.600]  made $37 million last year, and the total globalists and rips everybody off and gets
[35:29.600 --> 35:34.400]  taxpayer money on every package he ships, and it's a total scammer. They're just making
[35:34.400 --> 35:39.240]  it cool to be slaves, cool to be failures, because the average leftist, he is a lazy,
[35:39.240 --> 35:43.880]  hateful, nihilistic loser. That's what happens when you're lazy and stupid and don't build
[35:43.880 --> 35:48.040]  your body or build your mind or achieve things. You turn into a spoiled brat, but you turn
[35:48.040 --> 35:52.400]  into a criminal and a psychopath. Almost all these serial killers are little spoiled rotten
[35:52.400 --> 35:57.800]  brats. We know historically what we're facing. We have created incredible prosperity, our
[35:57.800 --> 36:03.480]  forebears did, with all their ingenuity, all their science, all their commitment, everything.
[36:03.480 --> 36:07.560]  Then now, a bunch of spoiled rotten people have taken it over, and they look at those
[36:07.560 --> 36:12.200]  of us who aren't perfect compared to our ancestors, but are still strong and somewhat trying to
[36:12.200 --> 36:16.920]  be noble, at least we're trying to be honest and good and decent, and they see us not being
[36:16.920 --> 36:23.280]  nasty and being liars as weakness. All they think at a subconscious level of projection
[36:23.280 --> 36:28.120]  is they hate themselves. If the light could be extinguished, if they could pull us down,
[36:28.120 --> 36:31.960]  if they could defeat us, then somehow they might have been successful. If they could
[36:31.960 --> 36:40.160]  capture the civilization, if they could get control of it, they could then rule it, they
[36:40.160 --> 36:47.680]  could then be somebody, but only after we fall. They're anti-free market, they're anti-competition.
[36:47.680 --> 36:51.520]  The very worst souls have gotten control of human development, and that's why I call
[36:51.520 --> 36:58.800]  this the war for the future. I try to publish a book with one of the top writers live. He
[36:58.800 --> 37:01.880]  said what, four or five, number one, New York Times bestsellers, everything else he does
[37:01.880 --> 37:08.320]  is in the top ten. They call his publisher, they call his ad agency, they try to get him
[37:08.320 --> 37:12.120]  fired, they threaten everybody. He goes, my God, I've never even heard of something
[37:12.120 --> 37:18.520]  like this. We'll still get it published, but this is insane. Then they come after our sponsors,
[37:18.520 --> 37:22.640]  then they lie about us and try to destroy us. Then they have people on CNN saying, the
[37:22.640 --> 37:27.280]  guy that shots Khalees did a good job on with Walt Blitzer. Think about that. These people
[37:27.280 --> 37:32.280]  are wound up wimps, like Wolf Blitzer and everybody, and Phil Mudd, I'm not killing
[37:32.280 --> 37:37.200]  the president, but you know what? The bigger wimps is us. Putting up with them, like they're
[37:37.200 --> 37:41.840]  a joke or oh, they'll be contained. No, they won't. They will slit our throats so they
[37:41.840 --> 37:48.320]  get a chance, politically, economically, and then physically, because it's weak, disgusting,
[37:48.320 --> 37:54.320]  little globalist punks. They always gather together in history to take over and to rule,
[37:54.320 --> 37:58.240]  and of course, almost all of them get destroyed and killed by whoever they help come to power.
[37:58.240 --> 38:03.520]  That's the story of history, whether it was Lenin or Stalin or Hitler or Mao or Fidel
[38:03.520 --> 38:10.280]  Castro or Hugo Chavez or Pulp Pied. The list goes on and on. Julius Caesar, whoever helps
[38:10.280 --> 38:15.520]  somebody come to power, and Caesar wasn't as bad as them historically, whoever helps
[38:15.520 --> 38:19.120]  brings him out of power or when they brought Caesar down, especially almost everyone who
[38:19.120 --> 38:24.760]  was a coup plotter there, ended up being killed. So those of you that lower the drawbridge
[38:24.760 --> 38:28.760]  to think you're so cool, get money from the Communist Chinese and Soros and Saudi Arabia
[38:28.760 --> 38:33.640]  and the EU and this abomination pope that literally says Communist China is the essence
[38:33.640 --> 38:37.920]  of Christianity and will teach us all, they've all joined forces with a billion and a half
[38:37.920 --> 38:42.360]  people and the robot factories and the suicide factories, and they think they're going to
[38:42.360 --> 38:46.520]  win with that leveraging power between the banks and Hollywood and Communist China and
[38:46.520 --> 38:51.520]  the Vatican and the EU, but they're all trash the minute we realize they're globalists in
[38:51.520 --> 38:56.440]  their whole game and stop listening to their propaganda and organize with the United States
[38:56.440 --> 39:02.280]  and try to take Canada and Australia back and organize with the Brexit and absolutely
[39:02.280 --> 39:06.200]  Russia has pulled out of the globalist system. They're a natural ally. They're not collaborating
[39:06.200 --> 39:12.040]  with us yet. That needs to happen. That's why they're so incredibly scared. The real
[39:12.040 --> 39:15.640]  collaborators of globalism are afraid that we're going to start working with other Christian
[39:15.640 --> 39:22.040]  nations to stop radical Islam's takeover and that was the final piece. The globalist occupied
[39:22.040 --> 39:27.600]  Catholic Church, the Communist Chinese, radical Islam, the EU, Hollywood left us everywhere
[39:27.600 --> 39:32.920]  or all combined in a public conspiracy against the West and against free market to capture
[39:32.920 --> 39:37.040]  it and bring it down once and for all so that people will stop wanting to be prosperous
[39:37.040 --> 39:41.720]  and stop wanting to be free. This is an attack on the Renaissance, an attack on Christianity
[39:41.720 --> 39:46.440]  itself, an attack on anything that's upper really mobile. They want you alone and stupid
[39:46.440 --> 39:52.240]  and dumb, hateful, believing if somebody else falls you go ahead because then that causes
[39:52.240 --> 39:56.240]  an incremental and an accelerated implosion of the entire civilization.
[39:56.240 --> 40:02.400]  So history is happening right now. We are winning the culture war, but they're intensifying
[40:02.400 --> 40:06.400]  their efforts to intimidate everyone. We must know that it's not courage that makes us go
[40:06.400 --> 40:11.840]  on. We know that if we capitulate, we will go into the dark night. It will be the absolute
[40:11.840 --> 40:15.560]  nightmare and they will have their way with us and our families. Make no mistake, that
[40:15.560 --> 40:20.680]  is their absolute lust as little chicken necked cowardly pieces of trash who want to dominate
[40:20.680 --> 40:25.800]  real men and real women. This is what you're facing, people that lust after dominating
[40:25.800 --> 40:28.640]  you. As a noble person, you don't want to dominate other people. You want to be left
[40:28.640 --> 40:33.360]  alone and build your own systems and we have built the systems. They are lusting every
[40:33.360 --> 40:38.840]  minute over controlling you and over binding you and over running your life and running
[40:38.840 --> 40:42.840]  your children and pumping you full of chemicals and biological so you're sterile and just
[40:42.840 --> 40:47.440]  ruling over everything because of the nasty evil people they are that serve their father,
[40:47.440 --> 40:53.040]  Lucifer, the devil, the old serpent and it's all real and it's happening and it's going
[40:53.040 --> 40:59.200]  on right now. And so this is the great fight. This is it and I am so honored to be here.
[40:59.200 --> 41:03.320]  Other veterans and people have to fight and die to try to defend some idea of freedom,
[41:03.320 --> 41:07.040]  usually being misguided by globalists but still their heart was right. But we get to
[41:07.040 --> 41:11.240]  actually fight against the new world order, global government itself now out in the open.
[41:11.240 --> 41:14.600]  We get to actually change the world and change the future for better. We actually have a
[41:14.600 --> 41:20.520]  chance of beating this with God's help. So that's all we have. Lay out and be slaves
[41:20.520 --> 41:25.480]  or stand up and fight and have a chance to take this back. We will win but we must be
[41:25.480 --> 41:30.960]  serious. We must be focused and we must understand how serious the situation is. So many strong
[41:30.960 --> 41:35.800]  men I know are busy just at their own companies, their own businesses and they're too good
[41:35.800 --> 41:41.920]  to even involve themselves. Fighting the leftists and the other trash, you have to and it's
[41:41.920 --> 41:46.960]  going to be your fault if we lose this thing that so many men sat there and decided, well,
[41:46.960 --> 41:50.800]  I don't know how to do it. I don't want to stick my head up and I don't want to be involved.
[41:50.800 --> 41:55.160]  You've got to do it. You've got to get involved and the bare minimum you can do is spread
[41:55.160 --> 41:59.520]  the videos, spread the articles, spread the links, start your own website, start your
[41:59.520 --> 42:06.320]  own YouTube, share our videos, share our articles and buy the products 30 to 80% off, free shipping
[42:06.320 --> 42:10.600]  store-wide that they financially hate the fact. They've targeted our supplements, they've
[42:10.600 --> 42:14.880]  targeted our t-shirts, they've targeted posters we sell, they sue us at every level so we
[42:14.880 --> 42:19.320]  can't even provide products but we're still winning despite it because it's all frivolous
[42:19.320 --> 42:22.840]  and still despite the fact that our courts have problems, the stuff they're filing so
[42:22.840 --> 42:28.600]  frivolous it's being defeated easily but it takes money. So this is World War 4, a 21st
[42:28.600 --> 42:32.240]  century information and economic war. We're going to go to break and come back with Owen
[42:32.240 --> 42:35.200]  Troyer for the balance of the transmission. He's got so much to cover but whether you're
[42:35.200 --> 42:40.200]  listening to us on local stations, on AM and FM or TV or watching live feeds, tell folks
[42:40.200 --> 42:43.240]  about it right now and spread those links. We'll be right back because if you're watching
[42:43.240 --> 42:59.600]  this transmission or listening, you are the resistance.
[42:59.600 --> 43:05.040]  InfoWarsLife is launching its newest product. We're really, really proud of it. It's a best

[46:03.240 --> 46:08.520]  line developed exclusively by Info Wars Life. After years of research on the human microbiome
[46:08.520 --> 46:13.440]  not all probiotics are made the same. Fluorolife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery
[46:13.440 --> 46:19.520]  system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[46:19.520 --> 46:24.000]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics so if you don't have a targeted
[46:24.000 --> 46:29.080]  delivery probiotic then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet. Fluorolife supports
[46:29.080 --> 46:34.200]  your body's core where you need it most including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining
[46:34.200 --> 46:39.600]  and metabolism. Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?

[47:20.440 --> 47:28.360]  The infowars.com studios. You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host
[47:28.360 --> 47:42.520]  Owen Shroyer. I've got stacks of news to get to and I will get to it whether it be Seattle
[47:42.520 --> 47:51.360]  confiscating guns, making a dangerous precedent on a homeless man's truck being his home,
[47:51.360 --> 47:57.080]  whether it's an entire stack of news on what's going on right now, what the left is doing
[47:57.080 --> 48:04.040]  to endanger us. Another stack of news on what the left has already done that's blowing
[48:04.040 --> 48:12.720]  up in their face. So we've got all that going on. We're going to have updates on the teenager
[48:12.720 --> 48:21.640]  that tried to detonate an explosive at a high school in Utah. And I'm about to go to these
[48:21.640 --> 48:27.480]  clips of Jeff Sessions as he just spoke and this is on the heels of the DOJ suing California
[48:27.480 --> 48:33.280]  over interference with immigration enforcement. Of course, the mayor in Oakland, Libby Schaff,
[48:33.280 --> 48:43.120]  Shifty Schaff, she warned lawbreakers in California, the police were coming, that's obstruction
[48:43.120 --> 48:51.200]  of justice. And it turns out that some of the people that she let get away were people
[48:51.200 --> 48:59.320]  that had robbery convictions and sex conventions. So way to go Libby Schaff, you're now colluding
[48:59.320 --> 49:11.600]  with criminals. You need to be sued, you need to be locked up. See, these radical leftists
[49:11.600 --> 49:18.920]  belong in jail when they break the law, but they get away with it because it's virtuous.
[49:18.920 --> 49:23.960]  I'm just being virtuous to these non-citizens. Don't we feel bad for them? Really, you feel
[49:23.960 --> 49:29.240]  bad for the criminals that broke the law and then many of them had sex and robbery convictions.
[49:29.240 --> 49:35.480]  Now they're roaming the streets free, Shifty Schaff. So thanks a lot. But I want to just
[49:35.480 --> 49:41.600]  talk about something real quick. What is Alex talking about when he says the fall of America?
[49:41.600 --> 49:47.640]  What is the fall? What is the fall that the globalists want? Well, think about it. They'd
[49:47.640 --> 49:51.360]  like to confiscate the guns. They want to do a gun grab. They want to end the Second
[49:51.360 --> 49:56.040]  Amendment. That's going on now. They want to attack free speech. They want to censor
[49:56.040 --> 50:01.240]  free thinkers. They want to end the First Amendment. That's going on now. They have
[50:01.240 --> 50:10.200]  their Soviet-style, communist-style fake news, propaganda news on air, lying and deceiving
[50:10.200 --> 50:15.560]  the public. That's going on. They want to have no borders so that you don't actually
[50:15.560 --> 50:22.120]  have a nation state. Anybody can flood in. Criminals, terrorists, what have you, but
[50:22.120 --> 50:27.960]  it's all virtuous. It's all good. We feel bad even though there's no actual security
[50:27.960 --> 50:31.360]  there. So it's a wide open border. So you really don't even have a country. Then they
[50:31.360 --> 50:38.480]  can vote. You don't even have a real election. How about a culture that is poisoned, a culture
[50:38.480 --> 50:45.200]  that poisons the youth with just all kinds of trash on television, trash in the media,
[50:45.200 --> 50:50.040]  and then that gets flooded into the mainstream. So now you've poisoned the youth. Now you've
[50:50.040 --> 50:56.440]  poisoned the culture. How about not even being able to procreate. So now you've got chemicals
[50:56.440 --> 51:01.440]  in the food and water and everything that causes people to be homosexual or causes people
[51:01.440 --> 51:08.880]  to want to be transsexual. Or let's say that that's not an issue. It's causing males to
[51:08.880 --> 51:15.120]  be infertile. Okay. And then it's harder for women to even have kids. So there you go.
[51:15.120 --> 51:19.760]  So just destroy the ability to even have kids. How about the indoctrination of the youth
[51:19.760 --> 51:25.000]  in the education system? So now you have public education systems indoctrinating the youth
[51:25.000 --> 51:30.440]  into hating America, hating white people, being totally, oh, full liberal, even though
[51:30.440 --> 51:35.000]  it's not actually liberal. And then you see the hate that is sown in the public education
[51:35.000 --> 51:40.960]  system, specifically in the universities. How about the health? How about the culture
[51:40.960 --> 51:46.280]  of health where now cancer rates are soaring up. People are more mentally ill than ever.
[51:46.280 --> 51:50.200]  People are more obese than ever. So you've got the health. So the deteriorating health
[51:50.200 --> 51:54.040]  of the country. You've got a totally corrupt government. Who's going to deny that that
[51:54.040 --> 51:58.480]  the FBI is corrupt? No one's denying that the US government's totally been corrupt.
[51:58.480 --> 52:04.040]  So you've got that. And then the death cult with the violence in the streets, with the
[52:04.040 --> 52:10.040]  violence in the media, and then with abortion happening, just millions of babies aborted.
[52:10.040 --> 52:16.880]  I think one third of my generation was aborted. So you want to talk about gun control saving
[52:16.880 --> 52:24.320]  lives? How about abortion saving 33% of my generation?
[52:24.320 --> 52:28.960]  So that's the fall that Alex talks about that the globalists have been working on for decades
[52:28.960 --> 52:33.200]  and decades. And now we've reached the precipice where we're finally fighting back and saying,
[52:33.200 --> 52:37.760]  no, we're not going to fall. We're going to pick ourselves back up. We're going to reform
[52:37.760 --> 52:42.120]  this country and we're going to make America great again. They're trying to drown us. They're
[52:42.120 --> 52:47.440]  trying to put their boot on our head and drown us and stomp us out. That's the fall they
[52:47.440 --> 52:48.920]  need to bring in the global government.
[52:48.920 --> 52:55.120]  Now, let's go to Jeff Sessions. First, actually, let's go to Trump. This was from yesterday.
[52:55.120 --> 53:00.000]  The Swedish Prime Minister was in town and they did a press conference and Trump said
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.920]  right to his face. And this is, I mean, folks, what's happening in Sweden? It should be a
[53:03.920 --> 53:08.320]  national news story every day with what's happened with the open borders and the illegal
[53:08.320 --> 53:13.700]  immigration. They're just destroying Sweden. I mean, rape is up, terrorist attacks, police
[53:13.700 --> 53:18.480]  stations getting bombed. It's insane. It should be a huge story. Here's Trump saying
[53:18.480 --> 53:23.040]  to the Swedish Prime Minister that they have an immigration problem.
[53:23.040 --> 53:27.720]  Mr. President, I know that you follow the development in Sweden closely, especially
[53:27.720 --> 53:33.280]  when it comes to immigration politics. Now that you spend some time with our Prime Minister,
[53:33.280 --> 53:38.920]  how do you view Sweden in general? What is your take in and also on our immigration politics?
[53:38.920 --> 53:39.920]  Thank you.
[53:39.920 --> 53:44.640]  I think you have a wonderful Prime Minister, I have to say. We've gotten to know each other.
[53:44.640 --> 53:48.560]  Certainly you have a problem with the immigration. It's caused problems in Sweden. I was one
[53:48.560 --> 53:50.040]  of the first ones to say it.
[53:50.040 --> 53:52.560]  Yeah, they said it was fake news and then he was right.
[53:52.560 --> 53:56.600]  It was okay because I proved to be right. But you do have a problem.
[53:56.600 --> 53:57.600]  Remember that.
[53:57.600 --> 54:03.000]  And I know the problem will slowly disappear, hopefully rapidly disappear.
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.880]  And you just look at the news that comes out of Sweden. Again, police stations getting
[54:05.880 --> 54:11.480]  bombed. They have these schools for the migrants that come in and then five years later they're
[54:11.480 --> 54:16.320]  boarded up. They got barbed wire fences. I mean, it's just insane. Rape epidemics.
[54:16.320 --> 54:20.680]  So yeah, that's an immigration problem because it's dumb policy.
[54:20.680 --> 54:25.480]  Now let's go to Jeff Sessions calling out the liberals, calling out the Democrats for
[54:25.480 --> 54:29.240]  putting the lives of officers in danger.
[54:29.240 --> 54:37.040]  For example, the mayor of Oakland has actively been actively seeking to help illegal aliens
[54:37.040 --> 54:44.760]  avoid apprehension by ICE for action, support those who flaunt the law and boldly validates
[54:44.760 --> 54:52.000]  illegality. There's no other way to interpret those remarks to make matters worth. The elected
[54:52.000 --> 54:59.080]  lieutenant governor of the state praised her for doing so, bragging about and encouraging
[54:59.080 --> 55:05.320]  the obstruction of our law enforcement, gangsterism, and full on gangsters.
[55:05.320 --> 55:12.320]  The left are a bunch of lawless criminal thugs now led by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
[55:12.320 --> 55:14.480]  What do you think this is?
[55:14.480 --> 55:21.760]  Has said recently, quote, being a law enforcement officer is already dangerous enough. But to
[55:21.760 --> 55:27.600]  give the criminals a heads up, that we're coming in the next 24 hours increases that
[55:27.600 --> 55:28.600]  risk.
[55:28.600 --> 55:30.360]  Yeah, so lock her up.
[55:30.360 --> 55:33.640]  When she said her priority is the safety.
[55:33.640 --> 55:37.440]  You know what? Hold on. Just pause right there. Pause right there. I'll tell you what. I'll
[55:37.440 --> 55:43.120]  tell you what. This is what the people are sick of right here. Now, Jeff Sessions, it's
[55:43.120 --> 55:47.120]  nice to see that he's still alive and he has a pulse. But you know what? This is nothing.
[55:47.120 --> 55:52.360]  I'm sorry. This is, this is fluff. This is an embarrassment. If I'm standing on the
[55:52.360 --> 55:59.320]  street corner as a lookout for a gang and I, and I see the cops rolling up and I call
[55:59.320 --> 56:05.040]  the ganghouse and I say, you better roll out. The cops are coming. I'm going to jail. Okay.
[56:05.040 --> 56:08.400]  Why isn't Libby shaft going to jail?
[56:08.400 --> 56:13.160]  So I'm glad that the DOJ has decided to sue California over this. I'm glad the session
[56:13.160 --> 56:19.160]  decided to give the speech. You're still cooking. You're still a wuss. Libby shaft belongs in
[56:19.160 --> 56:24.760]  jail. She belongs in front of a judge. And until you do that, you're going to have the
[56:24.760 --> 56:33.160]  same mentality that politicians are above the law. Do you understand the problem here?
[56:33.160 --> 56:39.200]  That's the problem. Politicians being protected because of their politicians. Libby shaft belongs
[56:39.200 --> 56:45.240]  in jail. If any other citizen in California calls criminals to warn them the cops are
[56:45.240 --> 56:50.880]  coming, they're going to jail for aiding and abetting in a crime. But Libby shaft gets
[56:50.880 --> 56:53.600]  away with it.
[56:53.600 --> 56:54.600]  Finish the clip.
[56:54.600 --> 57:01.200]  He did have the exact opposite effect. Close quote. And I think that's a fair criticism
[57:01.200 --> 57:07.440]  and statement. According to acting director Holman, I failed to make 800 arrests that
[57:07.440 --> 57:16.240]  wouldn't have been made. Those are 800 wanted criminals that are not large in that community.
[57:16.240 --> 57:22.680]  800 wanted criminals that ICE will now have to pursue by other means with more difficulty
[57:22.680 --> 57:27.560]  in dangerous situations all because of one irresponsible action.
[57:27.560 --> 57:33.520]  Yeah, irresponsible. She knew exactly what she was doing.
[57:33.520 --> 57:38.920]  How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of our law enforcement officers to promote
[57:38.920 --> 57:42.280]  a radical open borders agenda.
[57:42.280 --> 57:47.080]  So lock her up. If any other citizen would have done what Libby shaft did, they'd be
[57:47.080 --> 57:49.760]  in jail.

[58:59.000 --> 59:03.560]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence. We

[59:46.200 --> 59:57.400]  You are funding the information war in 2018. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:57.400 --> 01:00:13.080]  See, here's the problem. Here's why Americans are so fed up because Hillary Clinton gets
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:16.960]  to break the law and nothing happens. Barack Obama gets to break the law and nothing happens.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:20.240]  Lois Lerner gets to break the law and nothing happens. Libby Schaff gets to break the law
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:27.560]  and nothing happens. And then I get lectured on how Trump is the bad guy. You say, well,
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:33.520]  okay, what has Trump done? He don't have anything. What do they say? Well, he colluded with Russia.
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:38.680]  What evidence do you have? Well, he's a racist. What evidence do you have? Well, he's got
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:43.200]  a potty mouth. Okay, well, what's wrong with having a potty mouth? I'm sure that, you know,
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.400]  you don't sometimes say everything that's politically correct. Oh, but then Hillary
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.760]  Clinton uses a Clinton foundation. They got all this money coming in. She's got multiple
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.120]  wings, multiple satellites. She's colluding with Saudi Arabia, colluding with China, you
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.920]  know, colluding with Russia. She's got wide open servers. People can just come in and
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:05.360]  steal secrets. They're classified documents. Oh, that's fine. Obama uses Lois Lerner and
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:11.160]  the IRS to target their political opposition. Oh, that's fine. Obama administration uses
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.640]  the FBI and the DOJ and the FISA, of course, to target their political opposition. Oh,
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:21.600]  that's fine. Libby Schaff warns all the criminals in Oakland that ICE is coming for them and
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:27.400]  then they get away. Oh, that's fine. Yeah, no problem. But shut info wars down because
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.360]  they might cover it.
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:36.560]  So here's more from Jeff Sessions, which again, wow, Jeff Sessions, he's got a pulse. He's
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:44.000]  finally arose. Great speech, Jeff. Put Libby Schaff in jail. If you want to stop these criminals,
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:51.080]  put them in jail. Like it's like common sense. So here's Jeff Sessions saying that the officials
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:56.360]  in California have boldly validated illegality.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:02.960]  Like California, we have a problem. A series of actions and events has occurred here that
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:09.160]  directly and adversely impact the work of our federal officers. For example, the mayor
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:16.560]  of Oakland has actively has been actively seeking to help illegal aliens avoid apprehension
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:25.400]  by ICE for action, support those who flaunt the law and boldly validates illegality. There's
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:31.240]  no other way to interpret those remarks to make matters worth. The elected lieutenant
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:38.640]  governor of the state praised her for doing so bragging about and encouraging the obstruction
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:46.800]  of our law enforcement. And the law isn't I'm afraid this is an embarrassment to the
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:52.200]  proud state of California, the proud state of California that Democrats have turned
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:59.800]  into a literal sh-hole. Well, remember the clean needle program enacted in California,
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:05.680]  the clean needle program? Yeah, you know where those clean needles are now? They're infected
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:15.200]  with hepatitis laying around in the streets. That's what the Democrats have done to California.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:21.400]  Here's another clip from Jeff Sessions saying that we have to have a lawful system of immigration.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.920]  See they say that we're anti-immigration. We're pro-immigration. They're anti-immigration.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:33.880]  They're open borders. They're anti-immigration. This is 1984, man. I'd just go to the clip.
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:39.480]  We are a strong, prosperous and orderly nation. California is a great state so important to
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:47.680]  America and such a nation, such a country as ours, must have a lawful system of immigration.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:53.680]  I'm not aware of any advanced nation who disagrees with that concept and let no one
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:01.240]  contend that we reject immigration and want to wall off America from all immigrants. President
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:07.240]  Trump and the American people know what's happening. We admit 1.1 million immigrants
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:13.680]  lawfully to permanent resident status in the United States with a clear path to citizenship,
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:19.680]  green card status every year. No nation comes close to that.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:25.120]  We take the most refugees too. So there's Jeff Sessions. The DOJ is suing California
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.680]  over interference with immigration enforcement. Sanctuary cities need to be made illegal
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.800]  and if you're in government and you allow those, you need to be probably put in jail.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:37.800]  But now the UN Rights Chief says that the EU and the US need to take in more migrants
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:42.880]  and more dreamers. Oh, the UN is telling me this, huh? Oh, it's the UN. So I guess the
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:48.960]  UN is in charge now and they're also forcing a tiny Irish town to increase its population
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.080]  by 33% with open borders and migrants that don't know anything about the language, anything
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.080]  about the culture, anything about the people. But we're the problem. They're destroying
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:01.920]  the earth, but we're the problem. The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.920]  for inflammatory support and joint support. Discover the power of ancient medicine with
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:12.520]  bodies. Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available. Turmeric has been
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:16.880]  used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today. It is well
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:22.080]  known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties. Our pure turmeric extract plus
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:26.360]  peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:32.440]  flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more. Regular turmeric
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:37.680]  root from the store only contains 1 to 5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:44.360]  extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients. Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:50.800]  such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:32.240]  We had the guests on that told you the deep state and the globalists and the radical left
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:38.280]  in response to the resurgence of America and the election of President Trump. They would
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:45.400]  target schools. They would target trains. And then that happened and they targeted trains.
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:49.920]  They targeted trains carrying conservatives. In fact, there was another train wreck yesterday.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:59.360]  It crashed into a tanker carrying hydraulic acid and you have the Florida shooting. Now
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:10.880]  you have a teenager who was inspired by ISIS who attempted to detonate a homemade bomb
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:22.440]  at Pine View High School. Now here's my initial reaction to this. I'm not even going to really
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:25.200]  get into the weirdness of the Florida shooting or the weirdness of the Vegas shooting or
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:31.960]  anything like that, but if you just look at this story and you just focus on this and
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:42.440]  you say, how does this teenager in Utah get quote unquote inspired by ISIS? And he spray
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:49.760]  paints on the school. ISIS is coming. Apparently he's an ISIS guy now because ISIS is victorious.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:57.760]  He pulls down the American flag at the school and then raises the ISIS flag. So how does
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:04.080]  an individual become inspired by ISIS? I mean, really think about this. How does this individual
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:09.240]  become brainwashed into saying ISIS is coming, ISIS is rising, ISIS is about to have their
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:18.360]  victory? Who is telling him this? Where is he getting this? Well, they say he's inspired
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:24.000]  on social media. Okay, well, maybe that's the case. So then where is Facebook? Where
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:32.160]  is Twitter? I mean, folks, they're watching us. Hi. Hi, Facebook. Hi, YouTube. Hi. We're
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:38.040]  still here. Hi. We're still not telling people to go out and bomb people as a part of Jihad.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:43.280]  That's not what we do here. But somebody is and while you're focused on us, somebody is
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:47.920]  out there inspiring people to try to blow up their schools. Others are out there talking
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.280]  about bragging about how they're going to be a school shooter and you're obsessed with
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:57.520]  us. Hi. Hi. Maybe you should focus on the next terrorist that might be warning people
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:03.000]  on your social media platforms right now. But nobody asked the question. I mean, seriously,
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:09.160]  how does this teenager have this thought? Who is telling him that ISIS is coming? Who
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:14.160]  is telling him that ISIS is about to have their victory? Who is feeding in this propaganda?
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:17.920]  And if it is coming on social media, why aren't they doing something about it? Why are they
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:24.560]  continuing to censor us and censor conservatives and censor Trump supporters and ignoring people
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:28.800]  that are being radicalized or radicalizing people or warning people they're going to
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:37.200]  be a school shooter? So the teenager inspired by ISIS makes an explosive device, says ISIS
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:42.120]  is coming, thinks he's on the team of victory with ISIS, and then tries to blow up his school.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:47.440]  Here is the authorities in Utah holding a brief press conference to update you on this
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:54.280]  situation. Today, just afternoon, a student was in a common area at Pine View High School
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:59.720]  and observed a suspicious item in that area, a backpack that was smoking. That student
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:04.360]  found a teacher and reported the observations to the teacher who then contacted the school
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:09.160]  resource officer that was on duty in the school. It happened that they contacted another
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:15.440]  SRO to respond to the scene right away, who is also a member of the regional bomb unit.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:21.320]  So he responded to evaluate the backpack as did the school resource officer supervisor.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:26.040]  Once they were able to look at the backpack and determine it, it was initially they evacuated
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:30.560]  that area. As soon as they realized that they were dealing with a larger issue and more
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:36.680]  potential for injury or damage, the decision was made to contact the principal of the school
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:42.800]  and the SRO supervisor coordinated an evacuation of the school with the principal. Students
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:48.000]  were escorted to the football stadium where they remained until the end of school day
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.720]  and arrangements were made to get them home.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:56.080]  And pause it right there. And let's just remember something here. This is not rhetoric. Pause
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:02.400]  it right there, guys. This is not rhetoric. The radical left in America has actually allied
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:09.240]  with ISIS. And you say, oh, that's absurd. That's crazy. Now you're, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:14.240]  Think about it. Who stands up for radical Islamic terrorists when they do a crime or
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:19.240]  when they kill people? The left every time. And they say it's your fault for reporting
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:23.560]  on it. It's your fault for saying it's happening. You're triggering them. That's them standing
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:30.880]  up. Who enables? Who enables ISIS? Well, who was it that flooded money and arms into the
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:35.280]  Middle East and help with the proxy wars? Well, that was the Obama administration. That
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:42.080]  was the Bush administration. Okay. And now who is enabling them by having open borders
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:46.800]  in this country? And then I guess if you want to take it a step further and say social media
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.440]  that's apparently watching everything conservatives are doing or just ignoring radical terrorism
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.960]  going on.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:12:00.480]  So yeah, if anyone is radical, if anyone is aligned with ISIS, the radical left and radical
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:05.920]  Islam is kind of merging right now. I mean, just look at Linda Sarsour. She's totally
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:10.480]  radical ISIS. She goes out and she gets a bunch of radical leftists to go out and protest
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.320]  with her.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.040]  And then they want to act like you're crazy because you report on Sweden. You show what's
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:23.240]  going on in Sweden. Then they say you're an Islamophobe and you say, oh, I'm an Islamophobe
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:28.080]  because I don't want rape to go up like a thousand percent in my country when you bring
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:34.840]  in a bunch of radical Islamist refugees that just don't know any better. That's where they
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.920]  come from. So they come into Sweden where there's actually a civilization and they
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.720]  just tear it to the ground because they don't know how to behave. They don't know any better.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.800]  That's what you get. And that's what the left is doing. Let's go back to the authorities
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.800]  in Utah.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:54.280]  PIO for the school district discussed those issues. And I'll get through it all and then
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:13:01.080]  we'll hit questions. Sorry. So in response to the observations made, the regional bomb
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:06.640]  unit was contacted to respond, as was the fire department. We had responses as well from
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:10.800]  federal partners to include the country.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:17.500]  We contacted IHC, who has a canine that's trained in detecting explosive or hazardous
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:24.400]  types devices. That employee was off duty, but still volunteered or came in to respond
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:32.680]  and provided resources to our department and the investigators. A person of interest has
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:37.600]  been identified at this point and is being interviewed to determine what the circumstance
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.600]  is.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:41.400]  Exactly. So pause it right there. The crew just comes to my ear. They're like, oh, so
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:46.800]  this is the opposite of Parkland. You actually did your job. You actually followed through.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:51.840]  They're in Coward County. They totally blew it. Yeah. Yeah. You had, I mean, folks, when
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:58.840]  you actually counted 66 different opportunities, the authorities had to stop Nicholas Cruz
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.760]  from doing this between the warnings, the school had, the FBI had, the police had, the
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.240]  families had, everybody had, you're counting at least 66 times. They could have done something
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.240]  about it.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:13.880]  Nobody did anything, at least the ones in authority that could have done something. And then here
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:17.200]  you have the situation in Utah and they're like, yeah, we responded. We did what we had
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:21.960]  to do. People put their lives in line to try to stop this explosive. Let's let them finish.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:28.640]  In the backpack that had the potential to injure persons or damage property. I won't
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:34.120]  be able to go into the nature of that item or any details at this point. Again, it is
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:41.640]  an ongoing investigation, but the units investigating that aspect of this incident have confirmed
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:48.960]  that there was an object in that backpack to cause that concern. I'd like to, before
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:53.480]  we go on to questions, there's been a lot of moving parts involved in this incident.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.880]  We've had responses again from Washington County Sheriff's Office that help support
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:02.640]  our patrol units. Our patrol units have been here, man. Okay. Let's, let's bring that down.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:08.480]  So again, there are the authorities out there in Utah addressing the media as to what happened
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:15.360]  with the backpack or in the attempted bombing of the school in Utah. And of course, what
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:21.240]  is, I mean, who, who does backpack bombings radical Islamic terrorists? I mean, those
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:25.640]  are the people that line backpacks with bombs and then detonate them, whether it be at concerts
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:31.040]  in the streets now at schools. But the question is why, why is this happening in my country?
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:34.280]  Why do we have shooters? Why do we have these people blowing people up? What, what is happening
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:41.280]  in this country? Why do we have people literally defecating on the streets, masturbating on
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:46.400]  the subway? Why, why is all this going on folks? It's a mental health issue. This country
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:51.800]  is mentally ill. It's mentally sick. We have to, we have to fix our mental health if we're
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.040]  going to be able to fix anything. We got a bunch of crazies running around. They're literally
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:02.160]  crazies tired of being censored by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Patreon. Well, now you

[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:26.800]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:53.600]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Owen Shroyer filling in for Alex today. We're going
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:58.240]  to be hearing from Alex in the next segment. Trump is speaking right now. He just delivered
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:03.960]  about a 20-minute speech and the crew is going through that figuring out what exactly he
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:11.560]  was addressing. But the main subject would be the lawsuit that was just announced against
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:18.640]  California for aiding and abetting criminals in sanctuary cities. Of course, the name that
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:26.440]  we think about now is Libby Schaff who, in my opinion, belongs in jail for aiding and
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:33.400]  abetting. It's so crazy. You also got now, in fact, if somebody would actually bring
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:37.920]  me that story, because this is actually important, so they're trying to pass this legislation
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:44.800]  in Florida now. Some of the bullet points include raising the age of purchasing. Is
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:51.400]  it just rifles or is it any firearms from the age of 18 to 21? You've also got the bump
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:56.920]  stop stock ban, which is actually worded anything that increases the rate of fire. So they'll
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:02.600]  come after triggers and scopes and handles and whatever else is next. They want to have
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:09.360]  a three-day waiting period. You know, here's my problem with a waiting period. I get it.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:12.480]  But if somebody's getting a weapon to try to just do mass murder or whatever, they'll
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:17.520]  wait three days. So I really only think, I don't think it serves any purpose, because
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:21.360]  think about it. Let's say you're in a situation where you feel maybe you need a gun tomorrow
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:28.480]  and you can't get it. So now you're screwed. I don't like this. I don't like this. But
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:33.600]  here's what they're going to do. They throw in the $400 million for mental health and
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:38.400]  so you have to sign it. That's how they're going to sell this thing. Oh, if you're not,
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:43.960]  if you don't sign this bill, you're stopping us from getting the necessary mental health
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:51.480]  measures here. So we'll look into some of these details. Again, though, the story, NPR
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:55.380]  is covering it. Florida State approves gun control package. Florida Senate approves gun
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:59.680]  control package. OK, is arming some school personnel. So yeah, if you're on campus but
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:06.480]  not a full-time teacher, you can carry concealed. So there's your, OK, let's protect the students.
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:12.280]  And then the $400 million. All right, let's, you know, let's do something for mental health.
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:17.480]  And then they want to do metal detectors in schools, bulletproof glass in schools. And
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:22.360]  you know, again, they talk about, you know, having crisis teams and school resource officers.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:26.480]  Folks, the authorities in Broward County, Coward County failed those students. They
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:31.800]  failed. So how do you know the next people aren't going to fail? And they think that
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:37.600]  this is going to pass. And I don't see anywhere in here that their mental health facilities,
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.600]  including opening mental health institutions. I mean, you need to put people in mental health
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:45.760]  institutions, folks. They closed them back in the 90s. We need them more than ever. I'm
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:55.240]  sorry. We just do. So the waiting period is for any gun three days. Sorry, folks, this
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:24:05.640]  bill is no good to me. Nope. This bill sets a bad precedent. Can't support it. And again,
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:12.720]  this isn't the answer. This is not the answer to what happened at the floor to shooting.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:23.800]  It's not even close. It's not even close because what happened was a failure of personnel.
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:29.360]  What happened was a failure at the FBI. What happened was a failure in local law enforcement.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:41.440]  What happened was a failure during the shooting. So this doesn't fix anything. But we have
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.360]  to do something. So that's what they do. So they have to do something. So then they just
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:51.600]  do something, even if it doesn't actually do anything. It's really unbelievable. But
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:25:01.320]  you know what? You've got other big news here. I mean, this is so bombshell. Look at some
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:07.800]  of the precedents that are being set in Seattle today. This is from zero hedge. Seattle police
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:13.360]  began gun confiscations, no laws broken, no warrant, no charges. You see, this is all
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:17.840]  about what Eric Holder talks about. This is all about what the Democrats talk about, brainwashing
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:22.240]  people into thinking differently about guns, brainwashing people to literally shake in
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:30.280]  their boots when they just see a gun or the thought of a gun comes up. So this individual,
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:35.120]  people call authorities on him because he just happens to conceal Kerry or he's apparently
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:40.680]  looking out his window at some shop across the street or something. And so authorities
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:47.440]  come and take his guns. Neighbors complained that the man had been staring at people through
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.680]  the storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm. So I don't know what that's all about.
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.720]  I mean, who knows? Maybe he's just standing out looking out his window, drinking a cup
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:04.320]  of coffee. Just has his firearm on his side. Oh, you're a danger. We got to take that firearm.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:10.560]  So who knows what the full story here is, but they confiscated his gun illegally. That's
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:17.560]  the story. I mean, so what's next? I'm telling you, folks, they've already brainwashed these
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:23.920]  people into being so afraid of guns. If they see a gun, they go crazy and they call authorities.
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:33.560]  Just if they see a gun, just if they see a gun, that's mental illness. That's the brainwashing
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:39.080]  that the Democrats have been trying to instill in this country saying that you have to brainwash
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:46.480]  people into thinking differently about guns. You have to brainwash weak-minded people. You
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:52.280]  have to brainwash weak-minded people into being so afraid of guns. The mere sight of
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:27:01.960]  a gun sends them into some sort of shock. And they have to do something. Oh, oh my gosh.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:08.640]  That man has a gun. Oh my gosh. Somebody call the authorities. And that's how their mind
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:12.720]  works. And they freak out and they go into a panic just at the sight of a gun. That's
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.840]  the brainwashing by the media. That's the brainwashing by Hollywood. That's the brainwashing
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:23.400]  by the Democratic Party that Eric Holder told you they were going to do. And so now they've
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:28.840]  done it. So then a mass shooting happens. They don't address any of the actual problems.
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:34.720]  They just signed gun control legislation because we have to do something. And in Seattle, oh
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:39.520]  my gosh, that man has a gun. And then the police come and say, sir, you've broken no
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:44.080]  laws. You haven't violated anything. We're taking your gun because this, this, this
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:48.620]  libtard over here just freaked out and called us. So we have to, we have to do something.
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:55.760]  So we have to do something. So now he loses his gun. And so now Seattle has set that precedent.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:59.040]  So now the next crazy liberal is going to call the police on their neighbor that has
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:02.200]  a gun. And then they're going to take that because the neighbor looked at them the wrong
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:08.840]  way. Oh my gosh. My neighbor came home drunk last night at one a.m. I know he's got a gun
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:12.760]  in there. I'm scared. And then they come up, sir, we heard that you were drinking late
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.560]  last night. You have a gun in here. He's like, well, yeah, okay, I was out drinking. I didn't
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:19.840]  take my gun with me. It's locked. Sir, we're going to have to confiscate that weapon. Your
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:25.480]  neighbor's scared. Then a Seattle judge, a homeless man in Seattle, Seattle's homeless
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:29.840]  problems out of control, just like everywhere else on the West Coast. Homeless man's truck
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:35.840]  gets impounded. He can't afford to get it out. He sues. The judge says that's your home.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.680]  Your home can't be impounded. Now he gets his truck back and he can park his truck anywhere
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:44.840]  he wants because it can't get impounded. Do you realize the precedent just set in Seattle?
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:48.480]  So now homeless people are going to park their cars and trucks wherever they want. And you
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:54.440]  can't do anything about it because they run the town. Noncitizens and homeless bums now
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:29:01.920]  run Seattle. Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon. I'm talking thick, meaty, center cut, presidential

[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:22.480]  that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:28.080]  symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus production. And against
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:33.320]  studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials, now we are introducing
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:38.840]  the fruit of the research, a fast acting chewable tablet, just two, two tablets at the first

[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:28.760]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:40.560]  Alex Jones here with an update for the viewers and listeners asking where I am during these
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:45.360]  huge political firestorms that are taking place and all the demonization of Infowars.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:49.680]  Well, I haven't taken off in about a year to take my family anywhere. So I'm enjoying
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:54.520]  some of the great freedoms of capitalism and all the incredible things it builds like
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:59.400]  here in the mountains of Vale in Colorado. So we can come out here at snowboard and ski
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:05.160]  and watch the world championships, snowboarders and also ride the tubes down the mountains.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:10.520]  We're having a great family time out here. And yes, we've had this frivolous lawsuit
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:15.480]  filed by Pepe the Frog creator. We've talked to our lawyers. They say 100% slap statutes
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:19.920]  are in. It's a fake lawsuit. You can even create the buster for a third party selling
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:24.360]  it. We can't believe that they're this reckless. It's like the EEOC false filings. Those are
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:30.720]  totally reckless. All of it's just completely insane and totally reckless. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:37.680]  we have been attacked for the term real news and have court cases against us. The people
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:43.200]  saying that's trademarked. It is amazing what's going on and what's unfolding. And
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:47.600]  we've gotten to the point with this Pepe the Frog situation and with all the other
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:51.840]  behavior that's going on where we're going to have to counter sue very aggressively
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:55.680]  and of course get attorney's fees and damages so that people know that, hey, we've been
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:02.320]  nice this long, but that has an end because the left everywhere is saying hashtag hunt
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:07.000]  Republicans. They are trying to shut down free speech. They are trying to shut down
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.200]  our channel. CNN is involved trying to get rid of our sponsors and have us banned off
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:17.480]  YouTube. So as you look out here, this amazing vista and we see what we've built in America.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:22.640]  They have mountains like this in North Korea, but there's nothing there because the people
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:34.160]  can't build anything. They can't even produce cars in North Korea or Venezuela and the people
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:40.920]  are starving to death. So this is real authoritarianism that's coming after us and we're going
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:44.080]  to have to fight back because you've been standing behind us. We're going to be able
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:50.720]  to defeat it, but it shows you where the globalists want to take us. It shows you what they want
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:55.560]  to do to us, give their successful and how they have our children captive in the public
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:59.400]  schools, how Hollywood is trying to bully everybody in the submission. But the good
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:04.520]  news is whether it's the NFL or whether it's Hollywood or whether it's the Oscars or any
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:08.600]  of this, they're all in free fall because the people aren't under their cultural control
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:13.560]  anymore. And I quite frankly am honored in this culture war as a libertarian just trying
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:18.360]  to promote real open free societies that a criminal like George Soros, a Nazi collaborator
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:23.640]  and CNN and media matters and MSNBC and all these other groups are piling on and finding
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.520]  useful idiots to help them attack me because we're fighting in the 21st century for the
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:32.840]  real restoration of this republic. And usually people have to fight and physically die to
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:38.040]  restore a country to freedom or to get freedom. And so I'm just having to be demonized and
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:45.200]  attacked and lied about and sued because they're trying to intimidate everybody else. This
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:49.600]  isn't about me. There's massive internet censorship expanding. Apple's outlawing with
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:54.160]  communist China. There's draconian attacks on free speech going on everywhere across
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:58.320]  the Western world. And so they think by picking me out, they can make you think, hey, if you're
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:01.800]  a populist, if you're a nationalist, if you're a conservative, if you're a constitutionalist,
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:07.600]  if you're a free market guy, you're going to be destroyed. The truth is capitalism built
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:13.320]  all of the technology and all of the theme parks and all the malls and all the medicine
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:17.400]  and all the science and the literature and the art. Nothing comes out of these communist
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:21.440]  regimes but hell and oppression because it's oppressors that run it and control it. They're
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:26.720]  systems of conquest, not systems of liberation and freedom. And that's just a fact. And so
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:31.400]  history is on my side and so we will win. But they have gone from a lawsuit a month
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.360]  to a lawsuit a week now because they're getting pissed because they're all getting thrown
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:40.280]  out of court. The Communist Party USA is suing me, saying I attacked some guy or had people
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:46.840]  attack him at the RNC and no such thing as the truth. It's just crazy. Everybody knows
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:52.320]  I'm free speech. I don't agree with burning the flag but you're right to do it. So I'm
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:56.920]  in good company in all this. People need to understand and need to know that family does
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:01.560]  come first in the end of the day. And I've been filing some reports from the road here,
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:06.680]  but not as many just because I'm confident no we're going to win because you're strong
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:11.080]  and you understand these attacks on free speech are attacks on you. They're attacks on your
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:15.640]  speech to shut down these platforms. And then when they filed four strikes on us last week
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:19.840]  to shut our YouTube down and YouTube didn't shut us down, they said they were fake strikes.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:25.480]  The Washington Post came out and said along with BuzzFeed that we made it up. You saw
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:29.960]  the thousands of channels deleted or blocked or frozen. You saw them freeze our channel.
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:34.560]  You saw show you the strikes. But again, that's how dumb they think you are. Like you have
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:39.360]  no memory. You've seen CNN going after our sponsors and CNN trying to get us banned and
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:44.600]  CNN trying to block the publishing of my book, The War for the Future with Neil Strauss.
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:49.480]  I mean, this is, if I heard something about this in another country on NPR about this
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:54.480]  much censorship against one person, I wouldn't believe it. But again, they attack and then
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:59.120]  they could joke out of their attacks on free speech that are the most epic and most draconian
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:05.360]  I've ever seen. I mean, this is concerted fraud. And so get ready for the offensive because
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:08.260]  our listeners have been supporting us. They've been spreading the word. We're getting record
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:13.440]  traffic info wars.com. You've been buying the products got huge sales going right now.
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:17.840]  And I just hope all these lawsuits doesn't affect our expansion on the TV and so many
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:20.920]  other places we're reaching so many people. And right now we're neck and neck with the
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:25.320]  donations and people buying products are coming in just enough to pay for the half million
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:29.200]  dollars I'm happy to have to spend. A lot of these lawyers are pro bono, but I got to
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:34.400]  pay for the lawsuits to be filed, the plane tickets, the hotels, the people that take
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:41.080]  the transcripts, the experts, all of it. So we're lining up five lawsuits right now about
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:47.560]  100,000 a piece, anti slapbacks, all of it for everybody. And so that's it. And a lot
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:50.600]  of lawyers are in major law sites saying the same thing. They're going, God, these, these
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:56.080]  lawsuits are fake. There's anti slap suit stuff. So these fake lawsuits, people pay for
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:01.040]  this, but they're being financed by big money. They don't even care. And that's the crazy
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:05.200]  part is these are so reckless. It tells you the globalists are willing to do anything.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.920]  Hell, they're on CNN saying they're going to kill the president. Anyway, check out that
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:26.240]  great snow cloud. But what you know is they're fighting to keep you from visiting info wars.com
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:30.360]  and news wars.com. Everything wholesome, everything good, everything true, everything
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:34.000]  productive is under attack by the globalist. And the fact that I'm one of the people most
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:39.080]  attacked, but I still live in this great free country and the memory of freedom we have is
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:43.000]  still holding them back. We're going to take that memory and plant that seed. And they thought
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.480]  they buried me, but they didn't, they didn't know I was a seed. I forget who said that
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:50.920]  they thought they buried me. They didn't know I was a seed. Thank you all. I'll be filing
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:55.240]  more live reports throughout the week and more tape reports and I'll be back Saturday
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:59.440]  with the family back in the ATX. But thank you all. We're just all in this together and
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:02.880]  I salute you and I thank you and we'll defeat these people trying to destroy our free speech
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.760]  trying to enslave our nation. God bless you all.
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:12.560]  And while Alex is out there in the snowy mountains of Colorado, I thought I would just
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:18.320]  mention that you've got Nor'easters brewing in New England and they're about to have a
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:26.240]  second wave of them. You also got huge snowstorms in the UK as well. So now you see why they
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:32.640]  quit crying global warming. Now you see why they quit saying man made global warming and
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:36.920]  simply changed it to man made climate change. Well, because they were wrong and their formulas
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:42.040]  were wrong about global warming. Sorry, they're wrong on global warming and climate change
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:47.680]  just like they're wrong on everything else and all their policies. But folks, we've got

[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.360]  and force Infowars to downsize. But thanks to your support, we can take on these lawsuits

[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:04.480]  probiotic line developed exclusively by Infowars life after years of research on the human
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:10.040]  microbiome. Not all probiotics are made the same. Floor life probiotics use a unique targeted
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:14.760]  delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines

[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:29.440]  your wallet. Floor life supports your body's core where you need it most, including digestion,

[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:39.680]  system is located in your gut? That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important

[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:04.360]  Introducing cell force by info wars life. Cell force focuses on mitochondria efficiency
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:10.280]  and protection. Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy. They are your body's cellular
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:16.280]  engines. Cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:21.600]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul because when your mitochondria don't run at 100%
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:27.000]  efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species. Top scientists agree that
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:33.760]  aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:38.800]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:43.600]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:51.440]  species and other free radicals. Boost, protect and adapt with cell force from info wars life.

[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:31.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Now,
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:41.800]  you know that establishment media is failing right now if you focus mainly on the ratings.
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:48.040]  Movie attendance is down, Super Bowl, NFL ratings down, Oscar ratings lows. Everything
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:53.560]  that the liberals have destroyed, everything that the liberals have conquered and then destroyed,
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:48:03.800]  the ratings are crashing. Late night television, you know, what have you. And Jimmy Kimmel,
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:09.440]  the walking knish, Jimmy Kimmel blames Netflix for record low Oscars ratings following Trump
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:14.240]  tweet. Now, I'll get into that theory in a second, but first let's actually go to Jimmy
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:20.000]  Kimmel here responding to Trump's tweet about the record low rating Oscars.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.200]  I got a little surprised this morning. I woke up, I brushed my teeth, I looked at my phone,
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:30.400]  I got a texting, look at Trump's Twitter account as if I wasn't going to do that anyway. That
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:36.280]  is what I do every morning. And so I did and this is what I see. Lowest rated Oscars in
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:43.840]  history problem is we don't have stars anymore, except your president. Just kidding, of course.
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:50.680]  He's not narcissistic, it's just Joe. No, neither are you, Jimmy. I love saying the ratings
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:55.880]  are down to insinuate that is a show of some kind of support for him. But the truth is,
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:59.960]  every year since Netflix happened, ratings are down for every big TV show. Did Super
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:05.600]  Bowl Grammys, Emmys Golden Globe, but Trump thinks he caused the ratings to go down. So
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:08.840]  since I was the host of the Oscars, I felt like that's not what he's saying, Jimmy.
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:14.360]  He called me to respond. So I tweeted him, thanks lowest rated president in history.
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:19.960]  Except that's not true. Oh, but wait a second. Wait a second, that's not true. Trump's ratings
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:27.240]  are actually going up and he's actually higher than Obama now. So, oh yeah. Puzzle right
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:32.240]  there. See, this is the funniest thing about these people. Jimmy Kimmel just says, it's
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:37.480]  like when President Obama says, at least I'll be president and Trump is the president,
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:40.760]  Obama thinks he'd get some big insult, at least I'll be the president. And then the
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:47.960]  crowd's like, oh, he got him there. And then Trump becomes president. And then Jimmy Kimmel
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:57.280]  goes, oh, really funny lowest rated president of all time. Except he's not the lowest rated
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:05.120]  president of all time. In fact, you had stories today, support rising for the GOP tax overhaul.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:10.720]  That's bipartisan. President Trump's approval rating is right on par, if not ahead of Obama's
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:16.640]  at this point of his first term. So sorry, Jimmy, not only are you not funny, you're
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:20.000]  also inaccurate. Let's go back to Kimmel.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.120]  Trump always has a problem with the Academy Awards, which is surprising because I really
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:28.720]  think he would love the best picture winner in the shape of water. It's the movie, if
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:32.360]  you haven't seen it, it's about a monster that has sex with a woman who can't talk about
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:40.640]  it. Basically, it's like his life story, as everyone's making up stories about Trump,
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:44.560]  like they can't talk about it. That's all the media ever talks about. You talk about
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:45.560]  it every night.
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:50.280]  DJ TJ Donald Trump, Jr. took a break from selling tickets to the White House to tweet
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:54.720]  about the Oscars to he retweeted. He retweeted this, raise your hand if you didn't watch
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:51:00.040]  the second the Oscars. And then he added an emoji of a raised hand to indicate that
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:04.240]  he didn't watch. And you know, if you look closely, you know that's an authentic Trump
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:10.880]  hand because it's gold and tiny.
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:15.800]  Nice laugh track. Now here's the thing about what Kimmel is insinuating. There is an element
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:22.160]  of truth. Yes, why are TV ratings down? Why is attendance at movies down? Yes, a lot of
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:27.760]  that does have to do with the new media being on the internet, the Netflix is the Hooloos
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:32.200]  and everything like that. I mean, even the info wars. I mean, why do you think that,
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:36.520]  you know, CNN's ratings are tanking like the Titanic? Well, people would rather watch info
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:42.200]  wars. Our ratings go up, their ratings go down. I mean, that's how this works.
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:48.760]  But there's a not a silver lining here. It's a it's a it's a I would say a gray lining
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:57.280]  here because here's another angle to this that Kimmel's not going to tell you. Yes,
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:02.120]  some of it have to do with new media and Netflix and everything. Sure. But that doesn't necessarily
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:06.680]  explain why NFL ratings are down. That doesn't necessarily explain why the Oscar ratings
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:12.920]  are down. You can't really go elsewhere to watch those programs where with movie theaters,
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:16.480]  you can say, yeah, okay, maybe people would rather stay at home and watch Netflix. But
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:20.200]  why would people stop watching the Oscars? Why would people stop watching the NFL usually
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:26.520]  the highest rated events on on any given time? Well, that's because you, Jimmy Kimmel and
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:33.560]  the rest of your liberal friends in Hollywood have destroyed people's interest. And that's
[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:39.440]  the truth. So while you can maybe say that the reason movie attendance is down is because
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:45.120]  of Netflix, people don't watch the the grand Hollywood celebrations because we're sick
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:49.960]  of you. Because we're sick of your liberal indoctrination. We're sick of your nonsense.
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:53.160]  We're sick of your lies. We're sick of your attacks on our president. We're sick of your
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:53:00.560]  attacks on our country. We're sick of your assault on reality and truth. But there's
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:07.600]  another angle to this too. There is it. See, Trump is actually right when he says problem
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:14.120]  is we don't have any stars anymore. He's 100% right. He is 100% accurate. You see, going
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:20.200]  to the theater, the only movies that actually really sell anymore are either the movies
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:25.160]  that already have tradition like Star Wars or something like that, or some movie that
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:33.040]  gets huge amounts of hype like the Black Panther. It used to be someone like Jennifer
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:38.480]  Lawrence would be considered a movie star. And then people would go watch her movies
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:44.400]  no matter what because they loved her work. But she's poisoned her audience with her liberalism.
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:49.360]  And so there's not that interest anymore. Nobody wants to go see Jennifer Lawrence anymore
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:54.480]  because they can't stand her. That's the angle they're not going to tell you. See, nobody
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:54:00.000]  wants to go watch Jennifer Lawrence on a big screen anymore because all they can think
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:05.560]  about is that dumbass liberal. Nobody can watch the NFL. I shouldn't say nobody. A lot
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:09.960]  of people can't watch the NFL anymore because they can't get that image of the players kneeling
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:14.080]  out of their head. So they watch the game and the whole thing is spoiled because all
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:18.320]  they can think about is the people protesting the national anthem. So they've poisoned
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:23.040]  their own brand. They've poisoned their own product. That's why movie theater attendance
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:29.320]  is down. Does Netflix have something to do with it? Yes, but do not be mistaking. People
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:35.240]  are sick of liberals in Hollywood telling us how to feel and telling us how to think.
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:38.360]  That is why people don't go to the movies anymore because they don't want to see people
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:47.920]  like Jennifer Lawrence. Now, you've got a student, Anthony Borges, 15, is suing the
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:51.760]  Broward County Sheriff's Office, the school district and the principal and resource officer
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:56.360]  at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He was shot five times using his body to shield
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:01.640]  others while they were fleeing. This young man is a hero and he's suing the people that
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:05.360]  actually failed. That's right. The Broward County Sheriff, the school district and the
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:13.480]  resource officer, etc. FBI should be in there too. But you notice he's not suing the gun.
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:21.560]  He's not suing the gun manufacturer. Huh? He's not suing the NRA. Isn't that interesting?
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:26.280]  Funny how liberals point the finger in all the wrong directions and then the actual hero
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:32.600]  victim is going after the actual people responsible for this. Then on Fox News last night, Kyle
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:38.600]  Kashuv, who they used to ignore, is calling out David Hogg for being hypocritical. Here's
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:44.560]  that clip from Fox News. I want to play David Hogg, who has been out there a lot. He's
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:49.440]  become, you know, sort of very familiar to Americans. Here he is speaking out for his,
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:54.720]  on his side. Watch this. I actually hung up on the White House the other day. They actually
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:58.320]  called me the day before the listening session and asked if we were going to come. And I
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:02.720]  said, I'm not coming because we expect President Trump to come to the CNN town hall. And I
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:06.800]  ended on this message with them. I said, President Trump, we don't need to listen to President
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:10.320]  Trump. President Trump needs to listen to the screams of the children and the screams
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:11.320]  of this nation.
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:15.320]  Now, pause it right there. Pause right there real quick. Now, this is something very important
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:21.680]  to understand. This is liberal arrogance. So now, unfortunately for David Hogg, he's
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:27.320]  been so indoctrinated by the liberals. He now has this sick, poisoned liberal arrogance.
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:30.920]  I'm high and mighty. I'm bigger than President Trump. I'm bigger than you. I'm bigger than
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:35.040]  everyone. I'm a liberal. I've got the high ground. I've got the moral high ground. I'm
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:39.240]  calling for taking the guns. You support the Second Amendment. You're the bad guy. I'm
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:44.280]  the good guy. I'm David Hogg. I'm bigger than the President. Yep. That's right. Oh, yeah.
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:48.280]  Go back to, go back to Fox News now.
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:52.800]  You know, I'm really trying to control my anger at what he said because, you know, the
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:56.800]  president calls you and it shows he wants to make a change and you're talking about partisan
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:01.720]  change and the one man who controls, who leads our nation, you know, comes to you and is
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:06.000]  like, look, let's do something. Let's make it happen. And you hang up the phone on him.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.680]  That's so hypocritical. You know, he was, David Hogg, but again, you can bring that
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:16.040]  down. But again, this, see, look, I feel bad for David Hogg. Now he is totally exuding
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:23.960]  all liberalism, all Lib Tardation, the arrogance, the high and mighty moral high ground arrogance,
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:29.600]  and then the double standard. And then the double standard. Just as Kyle points out,
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:33.120]  here's President Trump calling you to have the conversation you said you wanted to have
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:37.200]  and you ignore it like you're bigger than it. You don't actually want to solve the problem.
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:42.000]  See, again, that's a liberal in a nutshell, doesn't actually want to solve the problem
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.040]  and arrogantly thinks they have all the answers. That is the average liberal in a nutshell.
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:52.440]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida. Victor, you're calling. Go ahead.
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:58.040]  Yes. Hi, Alex first. I just want to mention if people just go and try the products, they
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:03.640]  will be ordering all the time. I've ordered several of the products over and over because
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:07.960]  it's amazing. In particular, silver bullet, I, as soon as I start to feel like I get a
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:12.600]  little stick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some silver
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:17.120]  bullet and it like, I'll still feel a little stick, but it won't last as long. And I just
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:20.200]  ordered the body, the alpha power and the pollen block.
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:24.480]  Well, let me just say something, Victor. It's people like you that then find the whole operation
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:28.720]  because a very small percentage of people buy products and a very small percentage of them
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:32.960]  buy a lot of the products. So thank you. But when you mention the silver bullet, colloidal
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:38.040]  silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review. It is our highest reviewed product
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:41.760]  because it is from the top lab in the country discounted high quality colloidal silver.
[01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:44.680]  And it's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver
[01:58:44.680 --> 01:59:08.520]  bullet.

[01:59:52.160 --> 02:00:09.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the
[02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:34.920]  Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Well, you had
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:44.720]  Jeff Sessions wake up from a coma and address the illegality and the issue with sanctuary
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:54.760]  cities. Then you had Trump also echo that in statements that he made. But now Jerry Brown,
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:01:03.240]  the governor of California is fighting back against this saying it's an act of war. Well,
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:13.440]  not wait a second. I tell you this is so 1984. It's like I just have to just like if you're
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:18.440]  at war. Okay. If you're at war, what is one of the things that happens? You get invaded.
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:26.040]  You get invaded by foreigners. That's what's happening in California. And Jerry Brown is
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:30.480]  endorsing it. So here's Jerry Brown actually endorsing what would be considered an act
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:36.360]  of war and invasion of foreign people and then destroying his state. I mean, the state
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:42.800]  of California has so much debt, feces on the streets, needles on the streets, drug epidemics,
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:48.440]  homeless epidemics, totally out of control, totally invaded by foreigners, an act of war
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:53.880]  on California. And then here comes the federal government like California, you're out of
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:58.800]  control. You're you're lawless. We have to do something about it. And then Jerry Brown
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:07.320]  says that's an act of war. Let's go to this clip from Jerry Brown, an act of war. You
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:14.920]  said that that's pretty strong. Oh, it's all a joke. It's all a joke. We're just breaking
[02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:22.480]  the law retaliates to what the federal government. No, we we're a state of laws. No, you're
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:30.160]  not. Observe the law and you ignore the law. Can you believe this basically from the gauntlet
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:36.800]  down and done it in a highly politicized way. This is never. Jerry, you have destroyed the
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:42.720]  state of California. So the attorney general is coming out here. He gives a speech. You
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:49.200]  are. You are a rat. You rat to Washington. What does that do? I mean, that's not creating
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:55.380]  the comedy that a state and the federal government needs. So yeah, this is a very aggressive
[02:02:55.380 --> 02:03:00.840]  act on the part of the Trump administration. And it's not right. You are. You are such
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:07.560]  a trader. As I say, I'm sure this lawsuit has more longevity than the Trump administration
[02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:18.600]  itself. Okay, so Jerry Brown has destroyed California destroyed. I mean, I'm I'm I'm
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:25.000]  struggling to even wrap my mind around this. California riddled with homelessness, riddled
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:32.720]  with disease, wide open borders, ridden with all illegal citizens, sanctuary cities, feces
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:37.520]  in the streets, needles in the streets, homeless epidemic, dizzy. I mean, just total destruction.
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:44.840]  I mean, California is just a nightmare. A liberal utopia, a total nightmare. So so here's
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:54.120]  comes Trump and the DOJ and say, look, you got to have a border. Okay. And then you cannot
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:04:00.680]  aid and abet criminals that are here illegally. You know, you have Kate Stineley get murdered
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:08.680]  and the illegal non citizen immigrant gets away with that. You got feces in the streets.
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:13.680]  Oh, I mean, you got all it's just total madness. Literally, California just collapsing, falling
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:18.800]  apart. Half of the state wants to wants to get out. The other half of state wants to
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:22.160]  form a new California. And so the federal government's trying to get it under control
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:27.480]  like, okay, just have a border. Stop protecting illegals. Stop protecting criminals. Just,
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:33.200]  you know, get yourselves under control. And then here's Jerry Brown like, how dare they
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:38.960]  I'm going to destroy the state of California. If President Trump thinks he can stop me from
[02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:43.880]  destroying the state of California, he's wrong. If Jeff Sessions thinks he can stop Libby
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:49.560]  chef from breaking the law and aiding and abetting criminals, they are wrong. I'm Jerry
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:57.240]  Brown. I'm going to see I'm going to destroy California and nobody's going to stop me.
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:03.520]  I'm so excited. The new product that m4warslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings filled
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:10.040]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red bill. This is a heart and brain
[02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:15.720]  pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it. But boy, does it stimulate because
[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:22.080]  it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:27.760]  to their patients, but it wasn't prescription. But they were charging people $100, $200 for
[02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:33.120]  the formulae. And I came up with our own formula working with scientists and developers, non
[02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:40.080]  GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:45.560]  to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:53.440]  hormones in your glands. It is amazing. Red pill now available at m4warsstore.com and your
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:54.880]  purchase fuzz the operation.
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:06:09.320]  You are listening to an info wars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:24.560]  you are the resistance. All right, so we just heard from Jerry Brown. He's going to continue
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:32.160]  to let California turn into a total hole and he's proud of it. He's going to continue
[02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:37.000]  to allow people like Libby Shaff and the other authorities in California break the law and
[02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.760]  aid and abet criminals and they're going to fight back against the federal government
[02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:46.000]  trying to get California out of under control, a totally out of control failed state turning
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.640]  into a third world nation.
[02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:54.120]  Folks, I've got friends in San Francisco. They work their tails off and they can barely
[02:06:54.120 --> 02:07:00.920]  even afford to live in a home that is one block outside of the feces zone. And I'm talking
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:04.480]  to them about it and they're just like, you know, oh yeah, that's just how San Francisco
[02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:08.720]  is. You know, oh yeah, I wish something would be done about it, but oh, you know, it's just
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:13.160]  what it is. Yeah, I walk outside and there's some, you know, some drug addict injecting
[02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:17.120]  heroin right there. It's a clean needle though. And then he walks down the street and takes
[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:21.480]  a, takes a, you know what, and it's all good, baby. It's just California free love, free
[02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:27.800]  love, baby. Yes, California wide open borders. Hey, come on into California. Yeah, shoot
[02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:32.880]  a citizen. Yeah, just shoot her dead. Oh, you'll walk free. Don't worry about that. The ACLU
[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:36.720]  will make sure if you murder an American citizen and you're a non-citizen that you get off
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:40.080]  without going to jail or anything like that. I mean, this is free love here in California.
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:43.240]  If you're an American citizen, you're a piece of trash. If you're a non-citizen, you're
[02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:48.640]  a hero and you can't do anything illegal unless you're Libby Shaft then and you're supporting
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:54.760]  the invasion, then, and you're aiding and abetting criminals, then you're good to go.
[02:07:54.760 --> 02:08:02.600]  But there's a future to California that they either want or they don't understand.
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:12.080]  But it goes from one level, then it goes to the next level. Now, you've already got dreamers.
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:17.920]  They protest in front of Pelosi's house. They protest in front of Schumer's house. They protest
[02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:22.640]  in front of the DNC now. They say the Democrats don't want the dreamers here. So Trump totally
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:33.720]  checkmated the Democrats on that. But the Democrats have enabled criminals, enabled lawbreakers
[02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:38.560]  so much to the point now where they go out in front of ICE headquarters. See, this is
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:43.800]  what happens when you have a mayor that is colluding with criminals, aiding and abetting
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:48.480]  crimes saying the ICE is coming for you. Make sure you hide. That's illegal. She belongs
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:53.480]  in jail. But now you have empowered these people. You've empowered lawbreakers to just
[02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:59.680]  flaunt it in front of authorities. So here's a video from New Jersey. Illegal citizens
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:05.360]  flaunting their unlawful status outside of ICE headquarters.
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:18.080]  Today, March 5th is the day that Trump decided to wind down DACA. Obviously, the courts rolled
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:22.880]  in our favor and said that he can't do that. He tried to make a DACA deal. The Democrats
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:26.800]  refused it. Dreamers are being deported every single day. Our families, our communities
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:30.040]  are being deported every single day. But March 5th is really the day that we're fighting
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:41.280]  back. That's not even true. Look at these people. These people are nuts, man.
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:51.880]  Why do you care about American people? You don't stand for American people.
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:59.920]  Same on you, Donald Trump. Same on you Republican Party. We will win. You will lose. America
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:03.280]  will be bigger than we are together. Thank you.
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:10.480]  So see, that's it. Victory for them is destroying America. Victory for them is killing America,
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:16.400]  destroying the borders. And then again, they say, Trump isn't doing anything to protect
[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:21.160]  us. It's all Trump's fault. Trump offered to give all you amnesty and the Democrats
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:28.960]  turned it down. But you're so illiterate and you're so brainwashed, you don't even see
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:38.280]  what's happening in front of your face. Now look, all of these people, if you're a DACA
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:44.040]  recipient, okay, whatever, you're being protected right now. But you've got non-citizens. This
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:49.200]  happens in Austin, Texas. Illegal immigrants, they march in the street. They have confidence.
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:57.360]  They run this country now. You're an American. You've had multiple generations of people
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:02.960]  serving in the military, multiple generations of American. You're a piece of trash. You're
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:11.640]  scum. We don't give a hoot about you. We've got 20 million illegal citizens here. They
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:15.960]  run the country now. That's why they march in the streets. That's why they go in front
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:20.360]  of ICE. That's why they brag about it. That's why Lyndon Sarsour brags about it. They run
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:28.160]  you now, buddy. This is the gangsterism of the left, MS-13, where MSNBC even admits to
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:34.120]  you they won't report on MS-13. If you watch MSNBC, you've never heard of MS-13, the violent
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:40.720]  gang. You only hear about that if you pay attention to conservative news. And then you
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:45.760]  hear it. This is victory for us. We're going to bring in all of the illegals. We're going
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:50.200]  to shut down the border. We're going to turn every state in the union into California a
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:58.760]  failed third world state. And that's victory. I'm Governor Jerry Brown. I'm going to destroy
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:03.240]  the state of California. And if the federal government tries to stop me from doing it,
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:08.160]  well, we're just going to fight back. I'll get all my MS-13 gang members from the sanctuary
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:13.040]  city to come out against ICE. We'll put them all in danger. And we'll have Libby Schaff
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:17.640]  make sure that they're all aware when ICE is coming for them because they're the gangsters
[02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:23.000]  and they run this state now. Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump think they can fix this state.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  Not under my watch. I'm Jerry Brown. I'm Governor Jerry Brown. I'm a gangster thug. And I'm
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.840]  going to destroy the state of California. You want to move to California? Oh, no, you
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:38.680]  don't. No, you don't. We're run by gangs here now. You're going to get stabbed. You walk
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:44.160]  around the streets. You might step in a pile of feces. Yeah, go ahead and move to California.
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:49.240]  You think you can afford to live here? You can't afford Jack unless you're me, Jerry
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:55.160]  Brown, unless you're Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters that live atop their big, big mansions.
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:13:00.440]  And then everyone else lives in swalls, poverty and the swalls of society. I'm Jerry Brown.
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:07.680]  I'm a thug. I run California now. But this is what happens when you have open borders.
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:13.040]  Look at what happens to a Christian Somali woman who goes into a no-go zone in Sweden,
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:18.040]  which they say doesn't exist. Really? Well, how does this happen then?
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:28.580]  So she left Islam, she ditches her hijab, and she becomes a Christian. Now she receives
[02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:37.880]  daily threats from the loving Islam radicalism. So now she goes to rinkbeat in one of the
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:44.520]  no-go zones in Sweden without her hijabs. And she immediately gains a crowd. People
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:53.000]  are following her. See, the gangsters run now. The thugs run
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:14:03.800]  it now. Now they tell her they cursed her. They spit at her. They're angry at her. They
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:10.720]  threaten her. So they have to leave because that's a no-go zone now. See, that's an invasion.
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:15.880]  You open your borders, the radical jihadis come in, and then they have a no-go zone.
[02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:22.280]  You're not allowed in because they're so loving and tolerant after all. I mean, it's just
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:31.600]  a disaster. And so that'll happen in California next. That'll happen in Minnesota, and it'll
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:37.040]  happen in California. And the liberals will say it's the most loving thing ever. And if
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:42.080]  you don't send your daughter down to the no-go zone, well, you're just hateful. I mean, you'd
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:47.120]  be lucky. You should be honored in Sweden if your daughter goes into the no-go zone and
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:52.680]  gets raped by a bunch of radical jihadists. That should be your honor. How dare you say
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:15:02.320]  anything negative about the invasion of an whole entire crowd of people from the Middle
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:09.840]  East that then bring their culture of swallower and filth into the beautiful country of Sweden.
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:15.080]  So now you can't even go out in the streets because it's a no-go zone, because they run
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:19.960]  it now. See, it's just like in California. The thugs run California now. Now you go
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:27.240]  to Sweden. We got hijabs on. We got our men. They run the women here, and they run everything.
[02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:32.840]  And if you go into that, now it's the Swedish stand. If you go into the Swedish stand, you're
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:37.960]  not even allowed in. You better have your hijab on, or we're going to spit on you, woman.
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:45.280]  Because just like in California, we, the Islamists, we run Sweden now. Just like the illegal criminals
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:51.440]  run California. The radical Islamists now run Sweden. But that's loving. That's liberal
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:55.680]  to destroy your culture. That is liberal.
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:16:00.280]  Here's a special message for those of you who owe the IRS at least 10,000 or more in
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:05.320]  back taxes. The IRS has special programs in place that could eliminate or reduce your
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:09.680]  tax debt by thousands of dollars. Call the federal tax management helpline that has
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:17.280]  been set up for you, 800-503-8625. Stop the wage garnishments, levies, and tax leans now.
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:21.600]  Once you've qualified and enrolled, the IRS will stop all the collection activities against
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:25.960]  you. These unique programs have been allocated to help the economy and significantly reduce
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:31.920]  or eliminate your tax burden. The IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements and other favorable
[02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:37.640]  programs. You may qualify for substantial savings, so get the help you need. If you
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:43.040]  owe more than 10,000 in taxes, call for free information and to see if you qualify. Take

[02:16:56.520 --> 02:17:01.560]  Ever since ID Stronghold created RFID Blocking Wallet Technology over 10 years ago, major
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:05.640]  designer brands have tried to create their own versions. But do they really work? We
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:11.120]  let real people test designer brand RFID Blocking Wallets using the same rigorous testing ID
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:15.520]  Stronghold Wallets go through. So how did the designer brands do? I expected notable brands
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:20.120]  to perform well, and I was pretty surprised to see that it was not fully protective. Wallets
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:24.640]  by those big brand names that I like and trust don't really do what they're advertising
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:28.880]  that they do. Get a Stronghold on your credit cards, license, and other critical data with
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:33.720]  ID Stronghold Wallets. Other RFID Blocking Wallets simply aren't the same. ID Stronghold
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:37.720]  Wallets just outperform them in every aspect. I would definitely recommend ID Stronghold
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:42.320]  Wallets to my friends and family. Check the label. If it doesn't say it's an ID Stronghold,
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:47.480]  it's not. I'm very impressed with the ID Stronghold Wallet. Get the most trusted brand in RFID
[02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:56.760]  Blocking Wallets and protect yourself from electronic pickpocketing. IDstronghold.com.
[02:17:56.760 --> 02:18:01.280]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from infowarslife.com. But instead
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:05.320]  of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:09.880]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence. We
[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:14.160]  know chicken noodle soup. It's great for people that are sick. Again, in every culture, this
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:20.840]  has been reported because it works. And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but
[02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:27.400]  the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:33.120]  force that is in this is incredible. Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints,
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:36.600]  whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:43.160]  for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth

[02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:32.560]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I am going to commit to just covering the rest of
[02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:37.400]  this news before I hand over the baton to Roger Stone, who's going to be hosting the
[02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:42.080]  fourth hour today. We may even have time to squeeze in some of your phone calls, but before
[02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:48.520]  I get off track with that, let me just go headlong into this news here. Again, some of
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:55.200]  the biggest stories today. A teenager in Utah tried to detonate a homemade bomb at Pine
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:21:01.160]  View High School, said to be inspired by ISIS, boasts about how ISIS is coming and will
[02:21:01.160 --> 02:21:06.520]  be victorious. One has to wonder how he gets that message into his head. Who is telling
[02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:11.840]  him that? And if it is via social media, why is YouTube, Facebook and Twitter so obsessed
[02:21:11.840 --> 02:21:17.480]  with shutting us down, but not stopping people that are actually trying to promote people
[02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:25.840]  to do terrorist attacks in the name of ISIS? So that situation happened. Again, another
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:33.840]  attack or what would have been an attack on a school. You have the Trump DOJ with sessions
[02:21:33.840 --> 02:21:39.040]  making a statement today suing California over interference with immigration enforcement.
[02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:43.760]  Maybe Shaft needs to be put in jail. I mean, it's like, what do you even do? California
[02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:49.480]  is so messed up. It's like, how do you even fix that? I mean, I'm serious. See, here's
[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:57.160]  the problem. You want to know what the actual problem is? And I just want to be clear. I'm
[02:21:57.160 --> 02:22:00.760]  not saying this is what I want. I'm not saying this is what should happen because this is
[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:07.640]  not what should happen in America. But honestly, the only way to fix California is an authoritarian.
[02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:14.240]  The only way to actually fix California is for a dictator to come in and probably either
[02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:22.960]  fire or jail all politicians out of California, at least those on the Democrat side. And again,
[02:22:22.960 --> 02:22:26.800]  I'm not saying that's what should happen. I'm saying that's actually probably the only
[02:22:26.800 --> 02:22:32.640]  hope that California would have. I mean, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Jerry Brown, Libby
[02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:37.760]  Shaft. I mean, these people have destroyed the state of California, folks. And who know?
[02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:45.520]  I mean, where are all the highway funds going? You know what I'm saying? So anyway, but California
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:49.000]  is not going to stop acting illegally. They're going to continue to do their sanctuary cities,
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:52.480]  continue to have open borders, continue to have illegal voting, continue to have feces
[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:56.460]  in the streets, continue to have needles in the streets, continue to have just rampant
[02:22:56.460 --> 02:23:03.840]  homelessness everywhere. That's the liberal fashion of California.
[02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:08.080]  More good news, even though there was a bit of a hiccup, actually, I think it probably
[02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:15.000]  recovered the stock market today, but private sector jobs grow by 235,000 in February. That's
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:21.520]  40,000 more than expected. So the job market continues to grow under President Trump, but
[02:23:21.520 --> 02:23:30.680]  somehow these bums can't find a job. Now, this is really one. Cable goes nuts for Nunberg.
[02:23:30.680 --> 02:23:38.320]  It's almost perfect. His name is Nunberg because it's a nun story. CNN spends nearly 75% of
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:44.640]  airtime on former Trump aide. CNN spent three hours and 50 minutes on Nunberg, an hour 23
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:49.920]  minutes on everything else. This was from 330 to 11. And then MSNBC pretty much the
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:54.360]  exact same story. And it turns out the guy, I mean, you know, I'm not trying to insult
[02:23:54.360 --> 02:24:00.840]  the guy, but the guy was a drunk. So, so think about it. The left has now been trolled by
[02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:07.800]  a drunk twice. Papadopoulos gets drunk and runs his mouth. And then Nunberg gets drunk
[02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:11.800]  and runs his mouth. And the liberals put him on, even though they knew they probably knew
[02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:16.880]  he was a drunk. I mean, heck, they're all drunk. And so they put him on. And then he
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:21.680]  embarrasses himself and embarrasses CNN. And then Aaron Burnett says, you sound and smell
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:26.920]  like you've had a few adult beverages. You knew that the whole time. And the only reason
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:32.520]  you called him out for that is because he didn't go along with your fake news narrative.
[02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:37.960]  Hilarious. The left can be trolled so easily right now. That's why CNN is sending a news
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:48.120]  crew to go cover an Instagram model in Thailand.
[02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:51.320]  Talk about election meddling. Nobody seems to have a problem with George Soros in the
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:55.600]  Democrat Party. They're too busy looking up each other's butts for Russian collusion.
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:24:59.760]  They're ignoring George Soros, who funds them all anyway. Soros chalks up another district
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:05.600]  attorney win after dropping nearly $1 million in Texas race. Soros poured $7 million into
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:11.040]  11 district attorney races across the country in 2015 to 2016. He's approaching like over
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:16.600]  $50 million when you look at the all the consortium of all of the local elections that he's been
[02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:21.960]  funding. Where's the Soros meddling? Where's the Soros influence on the election? Nobody
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:29.700]  cares about that. A Nazi collaborator admitted it. CIA warns of extensive Chinese operation
[02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:34.360]  to infiltrate American institutions. And then this has been a story for a long time. And
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:38.240]  then President Trump, so you've got the trade wars going on. China wants to do something
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:43.280]  about the $1 billion deficit, Trump says. Then Trump tweets out today talking about
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:50.000]  these, go to Trump's Twitter. Now he didn't mention China in this, if I'm recalling correctly.
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:54.640]  The United States needs to do something about the theft of intellectual property. Folks,
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:26:03.240]  that is China. And I don't think he mentioned China in the tweet, but that is 110% China.
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:10.760]  Who he's calling out with that? China is the one that's been stealing intellectual property
[02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:15.560]  from America. You've had cases covered in mainstream news. Trump calls out China on
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:19.480]  Twitter today to talk about that. This is in the middle of the trade war, in the middle
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:28.880]  of trying to fix the deficit with China. So that's pretty heavy stuff there from the president.
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:35.480]  All right, I will get to, I've got still two massive stacks of news that I need to get
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:44.320]  to. One on the failing of liberal policies, and then the other one on just the absolute
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:48.440]  nonsense of liberal policy. So we'll have both of those when we come back from this
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:55.480]  break, getting ready for Roger Stone to host the fourth hour. But folks, again, we are
[02:26:55.480 --> 02:27:02.160]  under attack lawsuits, censorship, DDoS attacks, pretty much everything that you can imagine
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:09.520]  here at InfoWars. So we are launching specials. Now, when we have popular products and when
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:17.440]  we are in demand for funding to fight these lawsuits or to expand our operation here,
[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:22.520]  we don't go with increasing prices or anything like that. We slash our prices. And so we've
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:28.160]  got major price slashing going on right now at InfoWarsStore.com. Like most of the store
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:33.480]  is about 50% off. A lot of the store is 30% off, up to 80% off some of the apparel right
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:38.120]  now. And then free shipping store-wide. So if you're looking at a big ticket item like
[02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:42.640]  emergency food supplies or a water filter or an air filter, free shipping is going to
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:49.320]  save you a lot of money on those products. But 50% off super mail and super female vitality,
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:58.880]  50% off the real red pill, 50% off biome defense 50, the probiotic, 50% off true-way protein.
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:06.520]  It's all at InfoWarsStore.com. And again, free shipping store-wide. So take advantage
[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:12.160]  of these specials, help fund the InfoWars. If you're watching CNN or MSNBC and you're
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:19.320]  like, man, what can I do to defeat Rachel Maddow, who just got the number one rating
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:24.920]  in prime time television for news? Rachel Maddow. Now, I theorize that's because it's
[02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:30.560]  like a circus. I mean, she's basically just like a three-ring circus up there. But she
[02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:35.760]  defeated Hannity in the ratings. But if that bothers you and you want to see someone replace
[02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:40.800]  that, you want to see real news, replace fake news, go to InfoWarsStore.com and support
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:46.800]  our expansion. You have our word to expand in the face of the censorship with your support

[02:28:50.960 --> 02:29:20.840]  other side of the Alex Jones show. Don't go anywhere.

[03:08:07.600 --> 03:08:14.000]  That's what they do all day long. Look at the Trump-Russia collusion theory. Nothing there.
[03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:19.520]  The radical left says that Trump colluded with Russia. Well, you look into it, it was actually
[03:08:19.520 --> 03:08:26.320]  Hillary Clinton that colluded with Russia. It was a fake dossier with Russian sources
[03:08:26.320 --> 03:08:31.040]  paid for opposition research by Hillary Clinton that was then used to illegally spy on President
[03:08:31.040 --> 03:08:39.520]  Trump. So the left is the one that colluded with Russia again. So they say we are violent.
[03:08:39.520 --> 03:08:43.360]  The political radical left says the right is violent. They're intolerant. Meanwhile,
[03:08:43.920 --> 03:08:49.520]  they're so violent and intolerant. If you just go out in the streets with a Trump hat on,
[03:08:49.520 --> 03:08:56.160]  they can't tolerate that. So they get violent with you or an infowars reporter goes onto a UT
[03:08:56.160 --> 03:09:00.400]  campus and just has an infowars mic flag just interviewing people and radical leftists show
[03:09:00.400 --> 03:09:05.760]  up and have to shut it down. And then, and then, and that's when you realize it. And this is the
[03:09:05.760 --> 03:09:15.840]  trick. It's so simple. It's so simple that it's almost impossible to comprehend. And it's all
[03:09:15.840 --> 03:09:22.640]  out of Saul Linsky's handbook. Everything that the political left right now, everything, literally
[03:09:23.200 --> 03:09:27.600]  everything that comes out of the Democrat Party, everything that comes out of the radical left,
[03:09:27.600 --> 03:09:35.680]  they're guilty of. Either these people are such criminals at the top, the Clintons, the Obamas,
[03:09:35.680 --> 03:09:43.280]  the Schumers, the Pelosi's, that they have to point in the mirror except pretend they're pointing
[03:09:43.280 --> 03:09:46.960]  at their political opposition and say everything they're guilty of, even though they know they're
[03:09:46.960 --> 03:09:53.360]  looking right in the mirror. So then their street urchins do the same thing. You're acting like
[03:09:53.360 --> 03:10:00.000]  a Nazi as they go out and chant and riot and protest and beat up the political opposition,
[03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:05.040]  burn cities to the ground like they did in Berkeley. Just burn everything, topple everything.
[03:10:05.040 --> 03:10:12.400]  You know, they do it in Berkeley. They do it in St. Louis, in Ferguson. They do it in Baltimore.
[03:10:12.400 --> 03:10:19.680]  They do it in, where was the other one? I can't even think of it now, but that's what they do.
[03:10:19.680 --> 03:10:27.040]  And then they say, we're violent. We're the Nazis. We're intolerant. We're against free speech.
[03:10:30.240 --> 03:10:39.920]  And this is what we deal with. So now, in Seattle, they're trying to set a precedent. If somebody
[03:10:39.920 --> 03:10:44.400]  sees you with a gun and gets triggered because you have a gun, and then they call it into police,
[03:10:44.400 --> 03:10:47.440]  and the police determine that you have a mental problem, well, then that you're going to take
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:53.840]  your gun. Now in Seattle, because homelessness isn't enough of an issue in Seattle. No, it's a huge
[03:10:53.840 --> 03:11:00.080]  issue. Now the homeless just got even more empowered by a liberal judge. A homeless man had his
[03:11:00.080 --> 03:11:06.400]  truck illegally parked for 72 hours. His truck was then impounded. And you know he's getting help
[03:11:06.400 --> 03:11:11.840]  from the ACLU or some legal defense fund here. A homeless man can't afford an attorney, right?
[03:11:11.840 --> 03:11:19.600]  Maybe he can. I don't know. And so, Seuss, because his truck gets impounded and the judge says,
[03:11:19.600 --> 03:11:25.760]  you cannot impound this man's truck. It's his home. So now, the homeless man is so empowered,
[03:11:25.760 --> 03:11:32.080]  he runs the city now. He can park his truck wherever the heck he wants, and it can't be impounded
[03:11:32.080 --> 03:11:37.280]  because it's considered his home, says a Seattle judge. So this is what they do in California.
[03:11:37.280 --> 03:11:44.800]  This is what they do in liberal cities. The most vagrant, vile, slovenly,
[03:11:44.800 --> 03:11:51.920]  bums run the city. The hardworking, average American that goes to work, punches it in,
[03:11:51.920 --> 03:11:57.520]  works hard, pays their rent, pays their taxes, busts their butt to try to have a career.
[03:11:57.520 --> 03:12:05.440]  You don't get jacked. You are scum. You have to pay for all of the non-citizens. You have to pay
[03:12:05.440 --> 03:12:10.880]  for all the homeless bums. That's why you work. See, if you live in California, and now they're
[03:12:10.880 --> 03:12:16.480]  trying to do it in Texas, if you live in California, you don't work to build a family. You don't work
[03:12:16.480 --> 03:12:20.480]  to build a career. Obama says you didn't even do that yourself. Someone else did that. You're
[03:12:20.480 --> 03:12:26.720]  not working to establish some financial security. You're not working so that you can have a home
[03:12:26.720 --> 03:12:32.320]  and have a family and have a future that you can then bestow to your lineage. No, no, no,
[03:12:32.320 --> 03:12:38.080]  in California, you're working so that all of the illegal citizens can come into California and live
[03:12:38.080 --> 03:12:44.560]  rent-free and live without being penalized for breaking the law. You're working your butt off
[03:12:44.560 --> 03:12:49.760]  so that every homeless person can run the city, take a dump in the streets, shoot up with heroin
[03:12:49.760 --> 03:12:57.840]  down the road, and then run the city. That's what you do now in California. And it's sick.
[03:12:57.840 --> 03:13:08.720]  And this brings us to the midterm elections, folks. Now, I don't know what's going to happen. You're
[03:13:08.720 --> 03:13:18.000]  seeing conflicting reports. If you believe the media during the entire 2016 presidential campaign,
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:22.560]  of course, you would have been totally bamboozled. And they were. And that's why you got all these
[03:13:22.560 --> 03:13:28.160]  video clips, all these compilations of liberal media just totally bamboozled at the results. Like,
[03:13:28.160 --> 03:13:32.880]  what? We reported the exact opposite. How did this come true? So now you're seeing all the reports.
[03:13:32.880 --> 03:13:38.480]  Texas may turn blue. Democrats having huge turnout, all this. So they're building up this narrative.
[03:13:39.520 --> 03:13:43.200]  Democrats are going to be victorious. Democrats are coming for the House. Democrats are coming
[03:13:43.200 --> 03:13:48.240]  for the Senate. Democrats are taking over. Everyone's voting Democrat. Is this another
[03:13:48.240 --> 03:13:54.640]  fake news buildup? Is this another fake news story that they're trying to push on the American people
[03:13:54.640 --> 03:14:02.080]  that's going to be totally proven wrong? I really don't know. I think it's hard to say at this point.
[03:14:02.960 --> 03:14:11.840]  But I will tell you this. In these midterm elections, if we don't do what we can to get
[03:14:11.840 --> 03:14:16.560]  a Congress that will get behind President Trump, get behind the Make America Great Again agenda,
[03:14:16.560 --> 03:14:23.200]  just get behind basic law and order, then we actually have a chance to save this country.
[03:14:24.240 --> 03:14:29.360]  But if the Democrats really do win Congress in the midterms and they get more radical liberals
[03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:33.360]  in there, they get more Trumpators in there, they get more open borders, they get more criminals in
[03:14:33.360 --> 03:14:40.080]  there, I just don't know. I don't know how we come back from this. I don't know how much more you
[03:14:40.080 --> 03:14:46.560]  can take the liberal nonsense, folks. I mean, the state of California, how can it survive?
[03:14:47.840 --> 03:14:53.440]  How can they survive? They can't survive. How can America survive? It won't survive. Democrats will
[03:14:53.440 --> 03:14:58.720]  destroy this country, just like they destroy every city that they get elected in. Now, I'm about to
[03:14:58.720 --> 03:15:04.720]  hand the reins over to Roger Stone here. Before I do, I have to remind you about the big specials
[03:15:04.720 --> 03:15:09.840]  at InfowarsStore.com. They're coming after us. They're trying to ban us on social media, block

[03:15:29.680 --> 03:15:36.800]  face of the globalist, of the Democrats, trying to shut us down. They hate free speech. They hate

[03:15:42.640 --> 03:15:48.240]  we will continue to grow free shipping store wide, massive specials at InfowarsStore.com.

[03:17:59.840 --> 03:18:04.560]  assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down
[03:18:04.560 --> 03:18:09.120]  foods into easily absorbable components. They also help prevent discomfort from a digestion
[03:18:09.120 --> 03:18:13.760]  caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut. Digestive enzyme production declines
[03:18:13.760 --> 03:18:18.320]  as we age. Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:18:19.040 --> 03:18:24.240]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again. You can eat protein-heavy foods now,

[03:18:33.920 --> 03:18:39.840]  amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles. Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help
[03:18:39.840 --> 03:18:45.360]  digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals. Don't let a meal go

[03:18:58.240 --> 03:19:03.680]  found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including
[03:19:03.680 --> 03:19:08.640]  promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways to eye comfort and respiratory health and normal
[03:19:08.640 --> 03:19:14.000]  breathing. This is pollen block. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who
[03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:19.600]  ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms
[03:19:19.600 --> 03:19:26.000]  like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production. They began studying the effects
[03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:30.800]  in published trials, in their published trials. Now we are introducing the fruit of the research,
[03:19:30.800 --> 03:19:36.640]  a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two, two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress,
[03:19:36.640 --> 03:19:42.000]  and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal
[03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:47.040]  distress. Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block available now

[03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:00.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:00.880 --> 03:20:17.040]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[03:20:17.040 --> 03:20:22.320]  you are the resistance. And now your host, Roger Stone.
[03:20:22.320 --> 03:20:34.000]  Welcome back. You're on the Alex Jones show and I'm your pinch-hitting host, Roger Stone.
[03:20:35.120 --> 03:20:40.960]  Well, for those of you who may think that we're crying wolf when we talk about
[03:20:41.760 --> 03:20:50.160]  internet censorship and the wide whole-scale effort by the tech left and the giants of Silicon
[03:20:50.160 --> 03:20:59.840]  Valley to shut us down, think again. Yesterday, I noticed for the first time that Donald Trump
[03:20:59.840 --> 03:21:08.000]  Jr. and Matt Drudge and the Drudge report are being censored. Links that they put up are
[03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:14.640]  blocked with a box that says this information has been blocked because it is potentially too
[03:21:14.640 --> 03:21:25.760]  sensitive. Says who? Snopes, a left-wing mom-and-pop shop that operates as the left-wing censors for
[03:21:25.760 --> 03:21:35.440]  Google and YouTube. There's a terrific piece in Breitbart yesterday which accuses the tech left
[03:21:35.440 --> 03:21:43.920]  of gangsterism. They correctly say you don't have to like Alex Jones to be concerned about the fact
[03:21:43.920 --> 03:21:52.240]  that they are attempting to censor Alex Jones and Infowars on YouTube. Now, this is kind of funny
[03:21:52.240 --> 03:22:00.720]  because yesterday when I appeared in a very contentious interview on MSNBC's Meet the Press,
[03:22:01.520 --> 03:22:10.000]  after my interview, one of the talking heads in some parallel universe that's hard to identify
[03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:19.600]  accused me of being a gangster. I'm not a gangster, I just dress like one. The real gangsters, however,
[03:22:19.600 --> 03:22:30.160]  are the folks at Google and YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. They operate just like Al Capone.
[03:22:30.880 --> 03:22:37.200]  Hey, nice Twitter feed you've got there. Sure would be a shame if anything happened to it.
[03:22:37.200 --> 03:22:45.840]  What they want us to do is adhere to their world view to only say things that they approve. Well,
[03:22:45.840 --> 03:22:53.920]  that's not what Infowars is all about. But for anyone who thinks that this is just the folks
[03:22:53.920 --> 03:23:02.000]  at Infowars crying wolf to try to drive people to the Infowars store, think again. The entire
[03:23:02.000 --> 03:23:09.360]  election and rise of Donald Trump would have been completely impossible without a vibrant and robust
[03:23:09.360 --> 03:23:17.680]  alternative media, without the rise of the forces of freedom on the Internet. And now,
[03:23:17.680 --> 03:23:26.080]  those who are still in shock over losing the 2016 election are now seeking to put the toothpaste
[03:23:26.080 --> 03:23:37.440]  back in the tube. And they play games. Infowars has one strike at YouTubes. Infowars has two strikes.
[03:23:37.440 --> 03:23:45.120]  Oh, that strike is removed. Now that strike is restored. Now it's gone again. Kind of reminds
[03:23:45.120 --> 03:23:51.920]  me of when they said, oh, we we knocked President Trump off of Twitter, but it was a mistake. He
[03:23:51.920 --> 03:23:59.680]  was only down for 11 minutes. Oh, we killed the Twitter feed of the journalist, Julian Assange.
[03:23:59.680 --> 03:24:07.520]  Oh, we took Sean Hannity's Twitter feed down. It was a mistake. Somebody must have spilled Coca
[03:24:07.520 --> 03:24:17.440]  Cola on the keyboard. Don't buy it. This is the most important fight of our time. Our prospects
[03:24:17.440 --> 03:24:27.120]  in 2018 and 2020 are nil, but do recognize that Infowars is the test case. They are singling
[03:24:27.120 --> 03:24:35.120]  us out for execution first. Why? Because we are the tip of the spear, because we are the most
[03:24:35.120 --> 03:24:44.160]  aggressive in exposing the foibles of the globalists and the neocons and others who have brought
[03:24:44.160 --> 03:24:52.160]  this country to its knees over the last eight years. It's a test case, folks. If we can cut
[03:24:52.160 --> 03:25:00.720]  Alex Jones and the people at Infowars off at the knees, who's next? As Mr. Nolte says, John
[03:25:00.720 --> 03:25:11.040]  Nolte at Breitbart, today it's Alex Jones. Tomorrow it's Breitbart. The following day, it's you.
[03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:18.880]  You make no mistake about their game plan. What can you do about it? Well, you can do several
[03:25:18.880 --> 03:25:28.880]  things. You can sign up at GAB and Mines and other social media platforms that don't censor ship
[03:25:28.880 --> 03:25:38.080]  thought, that welcome anyone who wants to contribute and express and exercise their first amendment
[03:25:38.080 --> 03:25:46.400]  rights. You can use Facebook but recognize that they too are now moving aggressively towards
[03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:54.960]  censorship. What they call it is them deciding what news you should see. The most important thing
[03:25:54.960 --> 03:26:03.120]  perhaps you can do is to gird us for the extraordinary fight ahead. Alex Jones and I

[03:27:50.560 --> 03:28:00.000]  to touch on this one again. Great whey protein, which I use as a meal replacement, is hard to find
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:08.000]  when it's palatable. It's expensive, but it's very effective. I used to mix it with soy milk
[03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:18.080]  until Rob do got me hip to the downside of too much soy. This product is on special today,
[03:28:18.080 --> 03:28:22.800]  the whey protein, and I recommend it without reservation.
[03:28:25.600 --> 03:28:34.800]  The other personal favorite is, of course, the immune wall. In this particular atmosphere,
[03:28:34.800 --> 03:28:41.200]  the flu season, it's the best of the best. So load up on these products now and help us defeat the
[03:28:41.200 --> 03:28:57.280]  sensors. It's an O-brainer. A big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period. You need a

[03:30:55.520 --> 03:30:59.120]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida. Victor, you're calling? Go ahead.
[03:30:59.120 --> 03:31:05.040]  Yes. Hi, Alex. First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products,
[03:31:05.040 --> 03:31:10.720]  they will be ordering all the time. I've ordered several of the products over and over because
[03:31:10.720 --> 03:31:15.360]  it's amazing. In particular, silver bullet, as soon as I start to feel like I get a little
[03:31:15.360 --> 03:31:21.600]  sick, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some silver bullet and I'll still feel
[03:31:21.600 --> 03:31:26.560]  a little sick, but it won't last as long. And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the
[03:31:26.560 --> 03:31:30.800]  pollen block. Well, let me just say something, Victor. It's people like you that then find the
[03:31:30.800 --> 03:31:35.200]  whole operation because a very small percentage of people buy products and a very small percentage of
[03:31:35.200 --> 03:31:39.840]  them buy a lot of the products. So thank you. But when you mention the silver bullet, colloidal
[03:31:39.840 --> 03:31:45.440]  silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review. It is our highest reviewed product because
[03:31:45.440 --> 03:31:49.680]  it is from the top lab in the country discounted high quality colloidal silver. It's not a silver
[03:31:49.680 --> 03:31:52.080]  bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[03:31:54.480 --> 03:31:59.520]  Electrify your day with Secret 12. It's like lightning in a bottle. We all have days in which

[03:32:57.760 --> 03:33:00.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:00.400 --> 03:33:21.600]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation. It's Roger Stone.
[03:33:21.600 --> 03:33:33.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm your host, Roger Stone. One of the things that I have found
[03:33:33.360 --> 03:33:43.520]  transcends left and right is our love of man's best friend, yes, our dogs. And we've talked here
[03:33:43.520 --> 03:33:51.520]  on the war room and on the Alex Jones show about the ongoing process in which the Veterans
[03:33:51.520 --> 03:34:01.600]  Administration in the Trump administration utilizes dogs and in some cases puppies as young as eight
[03:34:01.600 --> 03:34:10.880]  weeks in barbaric medical experiments that I really question the value of. We have examples
[03:34:10.880 --> 03:34:19.120]  of dogs being given crystal meth, dogs having holes drilled in their heads to see how long
[03:34:19.120 --> 03:34:28.480]  they can survive, inducing heart attacks in poor defenseless animals, collapsing the lungs of dogs.
[03:34:29.760 --> 03:34:37.680]  We are long past the time that any of this canine research can yield any valuable information.
[03:34:37.680 --> 03:34:46.720]  I have written on behalf of the Daily Caller and InfoWars, calling on the Veterans Administration
[03:34:46.720 --> 03:34:57.120]  Secretary David Shulkin to end these horrific barbaric practices. And what we got was a lie.
[03:34:57.680 --> 03:35:05.920]  What we were told that it was that experiments of dogs will now require a higher level of approval.
[03:35:05.920 --> 03:35:20.320]  Unacceptable. Please join me in emailing Secretary Shulkin now. Tell him to stop the bizarre,
[03:35:20.320 --> 03:35:30.000]  barbaric, inhumane medical experiments on man's best friend. We're going to put up his address,
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:44.160]  but you can reach him at david.shulkin at va.gov. That's david.shulkin, which is spelled H-U-L-K-I-N
[03:35:44.720 --> 03:35:58.240]  at va.gov. We must get the Veterans Administration in the Trump era to end these horrific experiments
[03:35:58.240 --> 03:36:06.880]  on dogs. They are yielding no useful medical information. They are outdated and bizarre.
[03:36:07.600 --> 03:36:15.280]  Now, it's very important to note that the American war veterans recently came out against this
[03:36:15.280 --> 03:36:23.040]  practice and urged Secretary Shulkin to end it. Don't tell us it will take a higher level of
[03:36:23.040 --> 03:36:29.760]  approval, because that means that bizarre experiments are still being conducted on poor,
[03:36:29.760 --> 03:36:40.480]  helpless, defenseless animals. Stop this process now. Let's put Secretary Shulkin's email up on the
[03:36:40.480 --> 03:36:48.160]  screen as soon as we can. We need you folks, the info warrior audience, to email the Secretary
[03:36:48.160 --> 03:36:56.880]  today. And in respectful terms, no name calling, not in all caps, but urge them to end medical
[03:36:56.880 --> 03:37:07.600]  experiments on dogs. God will bless you. Many thanks. Now joining me is Jacob Engels of the
[03:37:07.600 --> 03:37:16.560]  Central Florida Post. Jacob Engels had his own star turn on TV last week when he evaded the
[03:37:16.560 --> 03:37:24.240]  screeners at CNN and got into a panel in which there was a discussion of gun control. That was
[03:37:24.240 --> 03:37:32.560]  bad news for CNN because Jacob Engels is an articulate libertarian, a regular contributor
[03:37:32.560 --> 03:37:41.280]  here at Info Wars. Jacob, tell us what happened on CNN. Well, it's great to be on the program,
[03:37:41.280 --> 03:37:47.920]  and quite frankly, they deceptively edited parts of the interview that did not fit the narrative
[03:37:47.920 --> 03:37:54.400]  of gun grabbing and gun control. I brought up the point of how Nazi Germany systematically
[03:37:54.400 --> 03:37:59.920]  disarmed the citizenry, and we saw what happened there. I brought up the fact that in post-Civil
[03:37:59.920 --> 03:38:06.480]  War, all the way up through Jim Crow era, apartheid races south in the United States,
[03:38:06.480 --> 03:38:13.520]  had local state government systematically disarming African-Americans, and they didn't
[03:38:13.520 --> 03:38:17.920]  want to air that because it made the point that there is a legitimate reason still for us to
[03:38:17.920 --> 03:38:21.760]  exercise our second amendment right. They want to say that, oh, the government will never do
[03:38:21.760 --> 03:38:27.200]  anything wrong. The government has no history of using the citizenry, and that's just flat out false.
[03:38:27.200 --> 03:38:36.240]  This was riveting television to watch you. Now, moving on, you have written a piece
[03:38:37.040 --> 03:38:43.680]  about the journalist Mike Izikoff. Now, let me say at the top that Mike Izikoff did some
[03:38:43.680 --> 03:38:50.240]  extraordinary reporting, early reporting on corruption in the Clinton administration,
[03:38:50.240 --> 03:38:59.920]  and was one of the reporters who reported early on about the serial sexual assaults of Bill Clinton
[03:39:00.640 --> 03:39:08.720]  and Hillary Clinton's role in intimidating and bullying his victims. But more recently,
[03:39:08.720 --> 03:39:21.760]  Mr. Izikoff's name came up as the journalist who the FBI used to plant a story that hyped the phony
[03:39:21.760 --> 03:39:30.400]  dossier, then turning around and pointing to his story before the court as evidence that this was
[03:39:30.400 --> 03:39:38.640]  real. You see, yahoo.com is writing about it, Your Honor. Therefore, it must be true. Tell us
[03:39:38.640 --> 03:39:45.440]  about what you learned, Jacob. Well, we learned that in the investigation that Mr. Izikoff was
[03:39:45.440 --> 03:39:52.240]  basing his data off a dirty dossier, first and foremost, and that he put up this what can only
[03:39:52.240 --> 03:39:58.240]  be called an opinion piece. It's not factual. It's not based in reality. And yet the United
[03:39:58.240 --> 03:40:07.280]  States government used it as a reason to obtain a warrantless FISA spying application to spy on the
[03:40:07.280 --> 03:40:13.520]  Republican candidate for president of the United States. This is right out of Gestapo era tactics
[03:40:13.520 --> 03:40:18.640]  that they used in Nazi Germany to crush the opposition. It's no different. And Mr. Izikoff,
[03:40:18.640 --> 03:40:23.120]  quite frankly, should be ashamed of himself. He's not an investigative reporter because clearly he
[03:40:23.120 --> 03:40:28.080]  didn't investigate his own quote unquote facts that he's promoting. But this is all the deep
[03:40:28.080 --> 03:40:35.520]  state globalist military industrial complex narrative that Mr. Izikoff bought. And it's
[03:40:35.520 --> 03:40:40.720]  quite shameful. And he should have his journalism card revoked. I mean, he likes to talk about
[03:40:40.720 --> 03:40:46.400]  info wars and other organizations that are not mainstream, not being credible journalism. But
[03:40:46.400 --> 03:40:51.920]  Mr. Izikoff, you're not credible. You based your information on a dirty dossier. And because of that,
[03:40:51.920 --> 03:40:58.000]  illegal sublime and seditious activity occurred in the United States under your guise.
[03:40:59.360 --> 03:41:05.360]  And it's kind of interesting. I was on with Sean Hannity last night, and we talked about this.
[03:41:05.360 --> 03:41:12.320]  This entire new focus on WikiLeaks, the entire focus on rushing collusion,
[03:41:12.960 --> 03:41:21.760]  try to reinflate what is an uninflated narrative, is really an attempt to distract from the stunning
[03:41:21.760 --> 03:41:32.400]  fact that the Obama Department of Justice and the Obama FBI utilized a dossier created by a foreign
[03:41:32.400 --> 03:41:41.200]  agent, in this case Christopher Steele, working with Russians as the legal rationale for the widespread
[03:41:41.200 --> 03:41:47.760]  state surveillance of Donald Trump and his campaign. Try to get your head around that for
[03:41:47.760 --> 03:41:57.680]  just a moment. This is an egregious abuse of power, use of the surveillance authority of the state
[03:41:57.680 --> 03:42:05.360]  to spy on one of the two major candidates for president. As I told Sean Hannity last night
[03:42:05.360 --> 03:42:13.280]  on air, it makes Watergate look like small potatoes. And now the Democrats and their
[03:42:13.280 --> 03:42:20.320]  handmaidens in the mainstream media will do anything to distract attention from the fact
[03:42:20.320 --> 03:42:27.680]  that they are busted. I'm Roger Stone. Thanks to Jacob Engels with Essential Florida Post.
[03:42:27.680 --> 03:42:43.600]  You're on the Alex Jones show. We'll be right back.
[03:42:43.600 --> 03:43:00.160]  Introducing Cell Force by Info Wars Life. Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and
[03:43:00.160 --> 03:43:06.960]  protection. Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy. They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:43:06.960 --> 03:43:11.680]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria,
[03:43:11.680 --> 03:43:16.880]  much like a cellular engine overhaul. Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100%
[03:43:16.880 --> 03:43:23.040]  efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species. Top scientists agree that aging
[03:43:23.040 --> 03:43:28.320]  is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:43:29.200 --> 03:43:34.240]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:43:34.240 --> 03:43:39.280]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[03:43:39.280 --> 03:43:46.800]  species and other free radicals. Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from Info Wars Life.

[03:43:57.200 --> 03:44:02.880]  top organic firms in the country that if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm going to
[03:44:02.880 --> 03:44:08.400]  speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this.
[03:44:08.400 --> 03:44:13.840]  This is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year. But
[03:44:13.840 --> 03:44:19.200]  immune wall is incredible and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70-80.
[03:44:19.760 --> 03:44:25.920]  It's a great deal at $39. Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf, and so much more.
[03:44:25.920 --> 03:44:30.960]  It is concentrated. You need to go read what is in here. The mushroom blend of the most
[03:44:30.960 --> 03:44:36.240]  expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate. A citrus peel blend,
[03:44:36.240 --> 03:44:40.640]  I mean, this is the next level. It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, immune wall.
[03:44:40.640 --> 03:44:44.480]  I think it's beyond seasonal. Beta-glucan, olive leaf, and more.

[03:46:53.200 --> 03:47:10.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:10.880 --> 03:47:28.320]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Roger Stone.
[03:47:31.840 --> 03:47:39.520]  Welcome back. You're on Freedom Command Central. That's right. It's the Alex Jones show here on
[03:47:39.520 --> 03:47:49.360]  Info Wars. We are the news outlet that the tech left fears. We are the news organization that
[03:47:49.360 --> 03:47:58.080]  makes the globalists tremble. That's why they seek to censor us. Extraordinarily good news out of
[03:47:58.080 --> 03:48:06.880]  the Justice Department. The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit on behalf of a woman who claims
[03:48:06.880 --> 03:48:16.880]  that she was denied her right not to have a mandatory vaccination. Now we here at InfoWars
[03:48:16.880 --> 03:48:24.080]  have questioned the safety of vaccinations or more precisely questioned the safety of what's
[03:48:24.080 --> 03:48:33.440]  in vaccinations and incredibly this lawsuit by the Trump Justice Department has the potential
[03:48:33.440 --> 03:48:41.600]  to break this issue wide open. The state of California is ground zero in the mandatory
[03:48:41.600 --> 03:48:48.400]  vaccination movement. This is where they will not let you send your children to a public school
[03:48:48.960 --> 03:48:59.280]  unless they've had the state prescribed vaccinations. That is very, very scary. So kudos to the
[03:48:59.280 --> 03:49:09.680]  Trump Justice Department. The congressman from California Adam Schiff has actually sponsored
[03:49:09.680 --> 03:49:18.880]  a House resolution that declares vaccinations to be safe and denies that the United States
[03:49:18.880 --> 03:49:26.800]  government has ever paid out a penny to the lawsuit process to people who have been injured
[03:49:26.800 --> 03:49:35.840]  by supposedly safe vaccinations. In fact, the US government, we, the taxpayers, have paid out
[03:49:35.840 --> 03:49:47.280]  in excess of 3.5 billion dollars to individuals who were damaged by vaccinations. This is akin
[03:49:47.280 --> 03:49:55.440]  to sponsoring a resolution that says the Holocaust didn't happen or World War two
[03:49:55.440 --> 03:50:05.200]  didn't happen. It is a disgrace, but it's pandering for big pharma campaign dollars.
[03:50:05.200 --> 03:50:11.600]  Kudos for the Trump Trump Justice Department for filing this landmark suit.
[03:50:12.960 --> 03:50:22.400]  Now, I, as I said, appeared on MSNBC's Meet the Press yesterday and then later in the day
[03:50:22.400 --> 03:50:32.240]  with the great Sean Hannity. All of these were in the wake of the tragic meltdown of my former
[03:50:32.240 --> 03:50:41.280]  colleague in the Trump campaign, Sam Nunberg. Sam Nunberg is a brilliant researcher writer who very
[03:50:41.280 --> 03:50:49.600]  clearly is dealing with his demons. I made it clear on Meet the Press and with Sean Hannity
[03:50:49.600 --> 03:51:00.880]  that Mr. Nunberg is a man who marches to his own drummer and he is a man who is not speaking on my
[03:51:00.880 --> 03:51:11.040]  behalf or at my behest or based on my advice. In the wake of all of this, because Nunberg indicated
[03:51:11.040 --> 03:51:19.200]  that he was not of a mind to cooperate with a subpoena for document production that would
[03:51:19.200 --> 03:51:27.840]  theoretically include email traffic between he and I along with Corey Lewandowski, Hope Hicks,
[03:51:28.480 --> 03:51:39.280]  Steve Bannon, Steve Miller, Donald Trump and dozens of others. I was treated to a recycle
[03:51:39.280 --> 03:51:48.880]  by the mainstream media of the patented lie that I knew about the WikiLeaks disclosures,
[03:51:48.880 --> 03:51:57.600]  specifically the quote-unquote Russian hack of the DNC, that I received this information from
[03:51:57.600 --> 03:52:05.360]  WikiLeaks and that I shared it with the Trump campaign and Donald Trump. Let's be very clear
[03:52:05.360 --> 03:52:17.040]  yet again, I had no advance notice of the content source or exact timing of the WikiLeaks disclosures
[03:52:17.040 --> 03:52:24.720]  that so thoroughly wrenched the Hillary campaign. I received nothing whatsoever from
[03:52:24.720 --> 03:52:32.720]  info from WikiLeaks or from Julian Assange and you cannot pass on what you never had.
[03:52:32.720 --> 03:52:40.640]  I did have a confirming source who told me that when Assange said publicly that he had a catch
[03:52:40.640 --> 03:52:49.840]  of material on Hillary Clinton and that he would publish it, it was true. Now going even further,
[03:52:49.840 --> 03:53:00.720]  the Washington Post in a piece by Jennifer Rubin took a line from the Democrats memo authored by
[03:53:00.720 --> 03:53:08.080]  Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell and Congressman Himes from my home state of Connecticut and others,
[03:53:08.080 --> 03:53:17.280]  saying that the Russians gave hacked material to Trump insiders for review. Jennifer Rubin
[03:53:17.280 --> 03:53:23.440]  of the Washington Post said that was Roger Stone, the piece that can still be found online.
[03:53:23.440 --> 03:53:32.400]  When I raised this yesterday on the MSNBC Meet the Press discussion, Michelle Goldberg of the
[03:53:32.400 --> 03:53:40.160]  New York Times said that this piece didn't exist and that the Washington Post had never said this.
[03:53:40.160 --> 03:53:48.480]  Please, Michelle, get your fake news straight. The upshot of all of this, well it's not pleasant.
[03:53:48.480 --> 03:53:58.160]  The Washington Post, Salon, and Vice, all speculating that I will be indicted by special
[03:53:58.160 --> 03:54:06.160]  counsel Mueller specifically for the crime of getting information from info from WikiLeaks
[03:54:06.160 --> 03:54:12.880]  and passing it to Donald Trump and the Trump campaign. So one more time, I received no such
[03:54:12.880 --> 03:54:21.600]  information and the truth is I never discussed in any way, shape, or form the WikiLeaks disclosures
[03:54:21.600 --> 03:54:29.040]  regarding Hillary Clinton with candidate or President Donald Trump. There is no case here.
[03:54:29.040 --> 03:54:35.760]  Julian Assange himself has said accurately that I was able to predict what WikiLeaks would do
[03:54:35.760 --> 03:54:43.200]  by very carefully following his interviews and his tweets and repeating what I had learned.
[03:54:43.200 --> 03:54:52.480]  There's no secret here. What you do have is the wishful thinking of talking heads like Ari Melbour
[03:54:52.480 --> 03:55:00.800]  who don't know what they are talking about. It is mean-spirited and the epitome of fake news.
[03:55:00.800 --> 03:55:08.160]  There is no evidence whatsoever that I knew about and passed on anything from WikiLeaks
[03:55:08.160 --> 03:55:18.720]  or the Russians. The entire thing is bullshiff, made up, false, meant to damage and distract.
[03:55:19.280 --> 03:55:24.400]  What do they want to distract from? Well, my friend Sean Hannity said it best.
[03:55:24.400 --> 03:55:31.760]  What we have here is the greatest single scandal of political espionage in American history
[03:55:31.760 --> 03:55:38.240]  where they use the FBI in the Justice Department, use what they knew was fabricated evidence
[03:55:38.800 --> 03:55:45.200]  to justify the surveillance of Donald Trump and his campaign for president after he was
[03:55:45.200 --> 03:55:52.240]  the Republican nominee. That's why we want a full, full-throated discussion of WikiLeaks
[03:55:52.240 --> 03:55:59.120]  to distract from a crime for which people must go to jail. Coming up on the war room,
[03:55:59.120 --> 03:56:08.480]  we're going to be taking some of your questions. The phone number for that is 1-888-201-2244.
[03:56:08.480 --> 03:56:15.600]  If you have questions about internet censorship, questions about what transpired with WikiLeaks
[03:56:15.600 --> 03:56:24.560]  and these devastating DNC revelations, questions about vaccinations, questions about the Veterans
[03:56:24.560 --> 03:56:32.480]  Administration bizarre and inhumane experiments on dogs, or anything else you want to talk about,
[03:56:33.040 --> 03:56:43.200]  join us on the other side on the war room. That number again, 1-888-201-2244.

[03:56:58.640 --> 03:57:06.640]  YouTube and Google and others who would strangle the First Amendment, who want to silence info wars
