[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:25.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:25.000 --> 00:35.000]  We have Mike Rivera joining us for his monthly visit today on the 7th of October, 2008, Tuesday edition.
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.000]  Coming up in an hour, we're going to have a 30-minute visit, coming up in a half hour,
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  with Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster about what's happening in the markets.
[00:43.000 --> 00:52.000]  The markets, by the way, are down right now, 21 points after a huge plunge of around 400 points is what it closed at.
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  Yesterday, down from last Friday.
[00:56.000 --> 01:08.000]  So Bob Chapman, then we have, of course, joining us, Mike Rivera, then we have Richard C. Cook, the historian and economist, analyst,
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  and then Webster Tarpley popping in for an hour as well.
[01:15.000 --> 01:23.000]  There's a lot of financial news I want to cover today, obviously.
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.000]  On top of it, we have a poll by CNN.
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.000]  60% say depression is likely.
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.000]  So I'm sure that was aided by the president and every other major party leader running around saying,
[01:37.000 --> 01:45.000]  we're going to have a depression because they want to implode the market now and then loot what's left of the currency.
[01:45.000 --> 01:52.000]  Brazil, Argentina abandoned the U.S. dollar, completely dump it.
[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  There's also a report on CNBC that they believe gold prices to double on paper market default.
[01:59.000 --> 02:07.000]  We'll tell you about that. Fed considers planned to buy companies, unsecured debt, and states, unsecured debt.
[02:07.000 --> 02:19.000]  So you've only seen the beginning of the takeover where tax money buys securities, buys different assets,
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  and hands it over to other private interest.
[02:21.000 --> 02:31.000]  By the way, former head of Goldman Sachs has hired the vice president from Goldman Sachs to head up handing out the multi-trillions.
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  If you really read the bill, it's upwards of five trillion as we keep reporting, and we'll get into that as well.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  So this is a Goldman Sachs operation almost entirely.
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  So we'll go over some of that news.
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  Also, Delta Force officers says U.S. officials stop plans to kill bin Laden.
[02:51.000 --> 03:03.000]  That's up on infowars.com. We have a clip there from 60 Minutes where they admit what we told you in my first 9-11 film.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  Well, the first 9-11 film, period.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  9-11, the road to tyranny, put out just three months.
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  Well, the first version was put out two weeks after.
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.000]  The final version was put out about three months after 9-11.
[03:15.000 --> 03:23.000]  And we break down there that Delta Force was not allowed to capture or kill bin Laden, but that was only one case of hundreds.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  And so I want to go back over that.
[03:25.000 --> 03:36.000]  But here is the Delta Force commander saying exactly what we told you close to seven years ago.
[03:36.000 --> 03:49.000]  And, you know, in Illinois, Missouri, and other areas like Connecticut, people have been threatened with arrest if they quote, lie about Barack Obama.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  The police said they will come and charge you.
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  That was in the newscast.
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  Several of the newscast and news articles in the campaign confirmed that.
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  But still, people were in denial about it.
[04:01.000 --> 04:08.000]  And then the prosecutors and county sheriffs had to back off of that, at least publicly.
[04:08.000 --> 04:18.000]  And now John McCain is using that police state tactic as a campaign point in new attack ads against Barack Obama.
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.000]  Meanwhile, the Times of London reports Corsi detained deported from Kenyon.
[04:24.000 --> 04:33.000]  And the police told him when he arrived, he was going to meet with one of Barack Obama's brothers.
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  They told him, you're not allowed to come here and lie.
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  And so he was arrested, detained and thrown out of the country.
[04:43.000 --> 04:49.000]  And the local papers said it was being done on behalf of Lord Obama.
[04:49.000 --> 04:54.000]  So just amazing police state tactics.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  And look, I don't have a dog in this fight. I'm not for McCain or Obama. They're both in the world of order.
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.000]  This is very serious.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.000]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[05:10.000 --> 05:17.000]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized the contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  And from my desk with Webex.
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.000]  I just talked to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[06:00.000 --> 06:08.000]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Sierra and we knew what to do.
[06:08.000 --> 06:10.000]  Or at least we thought we did.
[06:10.000 --> 06:17.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[06:17.000 --> 06:26.000]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[06:26.000 --> 06:33.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[06:36.000 --> 06:42.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[06:42.000 --> 06:45.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[06:45.000 --> 06:51.000]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.000]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[06:54.000 --> 07:00.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[07:00.000 --> 07:08.000]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  But the symptoms are there.
[07:10.000 --> 07:18.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.000]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[07:34.000 --> 07:42.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[08:02.000 --> 08:08.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:12.000 --> 08:23.000]  We are steaming towards an interview in 22 minutes with Bob Chapman, then Mike Roberto,
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  then Richard C. Cook, and Webster Tarpley.
[08:27.000 --> 08:34.000]  So four guests today and predominantly on the economy, what's happening around the world, and the unfolding police state.
[08:34.000 --> 08:50.000]  On the Dr. Corsi issue, love him or hating, the mainstream media really won't attack Dr. Corsi on the claims he's made about Barack H. Obama.
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  And I have said over and over again that John McCain is pure evil, pure new world order.
[08:57.000 --> 09:04.000]  He wants to use the military on the streets of America for law enforcement, which just goes with the whole unfolding plan.
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  These guys are just frontmen and puppets, so they push the agenda.
[09:08.000 --> 09:17.000]  I actually went and pulled up the YouTube clips and writings and votes of Obama in the state Senate and in the U.S. Senate.
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.000]  He is probably more anti-gun than even Chuck Schumer.
[09:20.000 --> 09:27.000]  It really is true that he wants to ban 308 rounds, 223 rounds, he wants to ban many types of rifles.
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.000]  And I have not heard that from John McCain.
[09:32.000 --> 09:38.000]  And I try to control myself, I try to not get pulled into the left-right paradigm.
[09:38.000 --> 09:46.000]  I personally, just on the surface with public relations, their public relations, their propaganda,
[09:46.000 --> 09:55.000]  I have that deep-seated white guilt that I can't fully throw off, which we're all indoctrinated with,
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.000]  to where I'd like to have a black president and say, see, we don't care, I'd like to be able to support Barack Obama.
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  I'd like to be able to say he's a good guy, but he is a gun banner.
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  His dad is a Muslim.
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  He was raised in Muslim schools.
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  He was born in a foreign country.
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  They are engaging in police state tactics.
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  And Barack Obama will get mass support.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  That's what he has.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  And in Webster, Tarpley has been right about that.
[10:21.000 --> 10:24.000]  He has been right about that.
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  And by the way, Webster is not some, you know, right-winger.
[10:27.000 --> 10:39.000]  He's what I'd call a progressive classical leftist who's transcended the eugenics, social engineering arm of the Democratic Party.
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  He will admit it's pure evil and there for eugenics and there to break up the family and destroy things.
[10:44.000 --> 10:50.000]  He believes that you could have a big government, though, that was run by good people that would uplift humanity.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  It just doesn't work that way.
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  But the point is, is that he's not some right-winger with an axe to grind.
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.000]  In fact, he wrote the unauthorized biography of George Bush back in the early 90s, back in 1991,
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.000]  which is the definitive work on the Nazi connections that are now on the BBC and Associated Press,
[11:07.000 --> 11:12.000]  and is now admitted fact, and we've been to the National Archives and confirmed that more research has been added.
[11:12.000 --> 11:21.000]  We cover it in my 2005 film, 9-1-1, Marshall Law, 9-1-1 Rise the Police State.
[11:21.000 --> 11:27.000]  But the point here is, is that it is true that McCain has no grassroots real support.
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  He doesn't have mindless worshiping zombies.
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  Mainline conservatives don't trust him, don't like him.
[11:34.000 --> 11:40.000]  They know he's for open borders, they know he's for gun control, they know he's for carbon taxes and the rest of it.
[11:40.000 --> 11:46.000]  And so they are wise to him, but they're holding their nose thinking they're going to vote for him.
[11:46.000 --> 11:47.000]  Hey, it doesn't matter.
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  The electronic voting machines are going to put in who the establishment wants.
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000]  Now, they've only got about 40% of the country with the fraud systems that we can document that do steal elections.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  See, this is how it works.
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.000]  The Democrats think it's a partisan thing that George Bush was put in and that the Supreme Court appointed him,
[12:03.000 --> 12:14.000]  and that then the election was stolen in many states like Ohio and New Mexico in places.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  And it was proven and people went to jail, but still the election wasn't reversed.
[12:18.000 --> 12:24.000]  So yes, George Bush stole both elections, but that's only one level to it.
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  You've got to be sophisticated here, we're going to beat these people.
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  That was because we had eight years of Bill Clinton, they needed to pass the baton.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  The conservatives said, give us anything but, you know, another quote liberal and Bush comes in and gives you tripling the size of government,
[12:39.000 --> 12:52.000]  tripling the size of the BATF, doubling the size of the welfare agencies and of the CPS and just a reign of terror against liberty, voting with the Democrats.
[12:52.000 --> 13:05.000]  And so now they need to give you a fresh face, a handsome, smiling, brown face with shining eyes compared to McCain.
[13:05.000 --> 13:17.000]  I mean, Obama doesn't have that much fire or charisma compared to a white Baptist preacher or black Baptist preacher,
[13:17.000 --> 13:27.000]  but he's got a little bit of it. And that's a lot more than John McCain that individual over 90% of people die who get the type of cancer he had.
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  And even a lower percentage live more than 10 years, even after it's in remission.
[13:32.000 --> 13:40.000]  He is nine years after his lymphomas being removed, the lymph nodes being removed.
[13:40.000 --> 13:49.000]  Doesn't look good, but it's like Bob Dole, they ran a corpse against Bill Clinton in 1996.
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  And so that's what's happening right now.
[13:52.000 --> 14:02.000]  And they did arrest the individual that claims he was the gay lover of Barack Obama.
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  I have no doubt that it's probably true, Larry Sinclair.
[14:06.000 --> 14:14.000]  They did arrest him at the National Press Club and Joe Biden's son arrested him and admitted later it was trumped up and the charges were dropped.
[14:14.000 --> 14:21.000]  They are arresting and arresting and shutting down websites of people, especially Democrats that don't like Obama.
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.000]  And I mean, I have to call it what it is.
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  I have to call it what it is.
[14:28.000 --> 14:37.000]  And it's just like Margaret Sanger said, the elite had to go out and hire black leaders to sell eugenics and breaking up the family and getting blacks on welfare.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  And blacks weren't stupid.
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.000]  A lot of the real leaders said this is the government taking control, put this back on the reservation, the plantation.
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  This is just like they went to the Native Americans and said we're going to give you money and take care of you and move you over here.
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  It's the same system.
[14:51.000 --> 14:59.000]  But they sent in huge cores of black leaders paid off to lead the black community into destruction.
[14:59.000 --> 15:06.000]  And I don't agree with some of the things he says, but on the majority of the issues, Lewis Farrakhan is actually right about that.
[15:06.000 --> 15:14.000]  And he will tell you, but notice he's pulled into the hype and he knows it would politically destroy him if he didn't fall at the feet of Barack Obama.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  So he has.
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  This is about power.
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  And so let me just say you're not going to really have a choice on who gets elected.
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  Either way, we are in deep trouble.
[15:27.000 --> 15:40.000]  But Corsi, detained, deported from Kenya, the Times of London, a leading American neoconservative author, has been detained by immigration authorities in Kenya as he tried to launch a book smearing Barack Obama.
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  See how even the headline is leaning towards Corsi out of England.
[15:44.000 --> 15:54.000]  Jerome Corsi of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth fame was this morning being held after failing to reckon with Obama mania.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  It's like they're laughing in the newspaper.
[15:56.000 --> 16:12.000]  He had been planning to launch his book entitled The Obama Nation, left his politics and the cult of personality before traveling to one of the slums to donate money to the senator's half brother, George.
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  He was found living in a squalid condition two months ago.
[16:16.000 --> 16:23.000]  Yeah, you know, I have a little bit of family who doesn't do well financially and I don't have a lot of money, but I give them as much money as I can.
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  I can't imagine not trying to take care of your family.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  It's just another horrible thing.
[16:30.000 --> 16:38.000]  But officers swooped hours after Dr. Corsi was described as author of a smirkers saved by local newspapers.
[16:38.000 --> 16:43.000]  Immigration officials claim he had been detained because he did not have a work permit.
[16:43.000 --> 16:51.000]  However, one of Corsi's assistant says he was just answering some questions as a journalist to be there.
[16:51.000 --> 17:01.000]  That's what Canada said when they grabbed me and detained me for 15 hours and Aaron Dykes and Ryan Slickheiser threatened to put us in prison and laughed at us and cussed and screamed at us.
[17:01.000 --> 17:10.000]  And then they said you're here to cover the conference, aren't you, and started screaming at us that we weren't going to be allowed to cover Bilderberg and bleeping this and f-ing that.
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.000]  Until Jim Tucker showed up with the CBC.
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.000]  We were supposed to meet with Jim and they didn't confiscate one of our phones.
[17:19.000 --> 17:26.000]  They did confiscate two of them and the call got through in the holding area.
[17:26.000 --> 17:44.000]  We were able, when Tucker started calling us to go, oh, call Tucker and Tucker within an hour, drug his butt out of bed at 5am, went down to the CBC offices where he was meeting later that morning with a reporter.
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  He got there early when she showed up.
[17:46.000 --> 18:01.000]  They got with a camera crew and a radio crew and came down because the main offices are there in Ottawa, capital of Canada.
[18:01.000 --> 18:07.000]  And they showed up and got us out of there about, I don't know, five, six hours later, one o'clock in the afternoon.
[18:07.000 --> 18:10.000]  And they were so angry.
[18:10.000 --> 18:20.000]  And so I really can't ever go back to Canada. They told me I'm in their system and they leaned over and just basically told me that they'll never come back to Canada.
[18:20.000 --> 18:25.000]  Because next time you won't be so lucky.
[18:25.000 --> 18:34.000]  I remember laughing. We're going through all three of our laptops saying, we're going to find porn, we're going to find porn, you're going to go to prison, you're going to spend five years in a Canadian prison.
[18:34.000 --> 18:40.000]  You're going to spend years before you even go to trial because that's what they do. It's really tyrannical up there, but the public doesn't know about it.
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  Because the media doesn't cover it usually.
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  And I remember saying, what do you mean porn?
[18:46.000 --> 18:56.000]  And they said any porn, as much as a topless pinup picture, and that's transporting porn in here and thank God no one in the office had visited porn.
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  What office would you imagine to have three computers, nothing on it, by the grace of God?
[18:59.000 --> 19:03.000]  There was nothing on any of it, not so much as a swimsuit girl.
[19:03.000 --> 19:06.000]  And they were so angry.
[19:06.000 --> 19:15.000]  And they got the memory sticks out of our cameras and looked at them and, you know, they would grab the memory sticks out and say, what's on these?
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.000]  And I'd say, they're clean. They're empty.
[19:18.000 --> 19:24.000]  You effing liar, when I find photos on here, I'm charging you for lying to a federal official.
[19:24.000 --> 19:30.000]  And they'd pop them in and it'd be clear and he'd start breathing heavy, a little bastard in a black uniform.
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  They'd love to be able to taser me to death like they do people routinely in those facilities.
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  I'm lucky they didn't.
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  Well, they got Corsi in Africa right now.
[19:39.000 --> 19:45.000]  Went out and found him in the city, drug him in, read the details at infowars.com.
[19:45.000 --> 19:52.000]  Tell me about the Delta Force when we get back, reporting that they were told to stand down and not go after bin Laden.
[19:52.000 --> 19:58.000]  Of course, this is what we've always been telling you for seven years.
[19:58.000 --> 20:01.000]  Now it's on mainstream television.
[20:01.000 --> 20:06.000]  As a parent, your biggest fear is getting a phone call that your child has been attacked or worse.
[20:06.000 --> 20:11.000]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep these safety tips in mind.
[20:11.000 --> 20:16.000]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings. Walk on well that pass with friends or students.
[20:16.000 --> 20:19.000]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  Know how to reach campus security.
[20:21.000 --> 20:25.000]  Always tell someone where they're going and when to expect their return.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  And always carry a self-defense device.
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  This important message is brought to you by Pepperspray.com.

[21:00.000 --> 21:05.000]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[21:05.000 --> 21:10.000]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999,
[21:10.000 --> 21:18.000]  reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[21:32.000 --> 21:39.000]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[21:39.000 --> 21:42.000]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[21:42.000 --> 21:49.000]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[21:49.000 --> 21:53.000]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.

[22:00.000 --> 22:07.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  bin Laden. This is his ammo.
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[22:16.000 --> 22:23.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[22:23.000 --> 22:30.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[22:34.000 --> 22:41.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[22:41.000 --> 22:45.000]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[22:53.000 --> 23:00.000]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[23:00.000 --> 23:04.000]  Attention. This is an extremely urgent, self-reliant news bulletin.
[23:04.000 --> 23:11.000]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[23:11.000 --> 23:20.000]  Here is why. This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods
[23:20.000 --> 23:23.000]  in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.000]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S. this fall?
[23:29.000 --> 23:34.000]  Don't wait. Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.

[24:02.000 --> 24:06.000]  Finishing up with the attack on free speech by the Obama zombies.
[24:08.000 --> 24:13.000]  They mean well. They think carrying out tyranny will save us from the great evil of George Bush,
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  but it's both parties that are bought and paid for by the same interest.
[24:16.000 --> 24:21.000]  And when George Bush was having warrantless wiretaps and still is the American people,
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.000]  setting up this control grid and butchering the Bill of Rights, we were against it.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  We were against it when Bill Clinton did it.
[24:27.000 --> 24:31.000]  And now it looks like it'll probably be Barack H. Obama.
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  Who knows who's going to win? It doesn't matter.
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  And the final equation, the point is we have to say no to this tyranny.
[24:38.000 --> 24:48.000]  Now, CBS News is now reporting only a very small part of a larger important story that needs to be told.
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.000]  6,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda cream, as they were described by the Times of London,
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.000]  and other publications were flown out to safety in what's called the Airlift of Ebel
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  in the first two months of the Afghan invasion.
[25:00.000 --> 25:07.000]  You see, the Al-Qaeda and the Taliban leadership had been on the CIA payroll back since at least 1978.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  And so the real guys, they got out of the country.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  Then they would arrest a few religious leaders.
[25:12.000 --> 25:19.000]  In fact, the one big leader they arrested was the guy who, the cleric who offered to turn Bin Laden in,
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.000]  offered to try to help warn the U.S. in the weeks before because he heard the chatter,
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.000]  which of course was a setup, a story being planted.
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  So whoever waited and with open arms for the U.S., they got grabbed and sent to Gitmo.
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  But then the real Taliban and Al-Qaeda, they got flown out to safety.
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  And Special Forces would capture number two in Taliban, number four in Al-Qaeda.
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.000]  And they'd be ordered to release them, give them money, give them food, put them in trucks,
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.000]  escort them to the border of Pakistan, put them in C-130s.
[25:49.000 --> 25:56.000]  And there were Special Forces colonels in the San Francisco Chronicle and in all these articles.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  I mean, they were hopping mad.
[25:58.000 --> 26:04.000]  A few years later, that's what upset Pat Tillman so much.
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  Of course, we've had former Army folks, Rangers and others on who talk about staging,
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  you know, shootouts with Al-Qaeda and Taliban with CNN where they would just go to a base
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.000]  and then fire their weapons like they were fighting somebody.
[26:17.000 --> 26:27.000]  Now, Delta Force, no, patriotic guys, attached basically to the CIA and to the National Security Council,
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.000]  they get paired up with this Taliban leader who's supposedly going to help them hunt Bin Laden.
[26:32.000 --> 26:39.000]  And you hear the Delta Force commander on 60 minutes saying it was like it was staged.
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  It was like they would have these staged firefights with Bin Laden's people.
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  And then they would never help us.
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.000]  And this is who the CIA picked and paid to aid them.
[26:49.000 --> 26:56.000]  And then it turned out the CIA would pay $25,000 some cases more per head for 14-year-old innocent kids
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  to send to Gitmo and then release the real people.
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  So it's a long piece. It's up on infowars.com.
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  Now, but here's a few minutes of it.
[27:04.000 --> 27:11.000]  Shortly after 9-11, the Pentagon ordered a top secret team of American commandos into Afghanistan
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  with a single simple order, kill Osama Bin Laden.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  It was America's best chance to eliminate the leader of Al-Qaeda.
[27:20.000 --> 27:26.000]  The inside story of exactly what happened in that mission and how close it came to its objective
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  has never been told until tonight.
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  The man you're about to meet was the officer in command,
[27:32.000 --> 27:38.000]  leading a team from the U.S. Army's mysterious Delta Force, a unit so secret,
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  it's often said that Delta doesn't exist.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  But you're about to see Delta's operators in action.
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.000]  Why would the mission commander break his silence after seven years?
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000]  He told us that most everything he's read in the media is wrong.
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  And tonight, he wants to set the record straight.
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  Our job is to go find him, capture a killer.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  Hey, back that up. People, start conspiracy theories.
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  Recording that off the web at Bufford so there's a few breakups in this,
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.000]  but you can go watch it all for yourself again on infowars.com or at the CBS 60-minute site.
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  So back it up a few seconds and play it again.
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.000]  It's often said that Delta doesn't exist.
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.000]  But you're about to see Delta's operators in action.
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  Why would the mission commander break his silence after seven years?
[28:27.000 --> 28:32.000]  He told us that most everything he's read in the media is wrong.
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  And tonight, he wants to set the record straight.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  Our job is to go find him, capture a killer.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  And we knew the writing on the wall was really to kill him.
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.000]  No one wanted to bring a salmonella back to stand trial in the United States somewhere.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  In 2001, just 10 weeks after 9-11,
[28:49.000 --> 28:55.000]  he was a 37-year-old army major leading a team of America's most elite commandos.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  Even now, we can't tell you his name or show you his face.
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  We hired a theatrical makeup artist to take the former Delta officer
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.000]  through a series of transformations to create the man you see now.
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  He calls himself Dalton Fury.
[29:10.000 --> 29:14.000]  He's the author of Kill Bin Laden, a new book out this week.
[29:14.000 --> 29:19.000]  Dalton Fury is used to disguises, in fact, in 2001,
[29:19.000 --> 29:23.000]  his entire team transformed itself in Afghanistan.
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  Everybody has their beer grown.
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.000]  Everybody's wearing local Afghan clothing,
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  sometimes carrying the same weapons as them.
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  The idea was that if this all worked out,
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.000]  Osama bin Laden would be dead,
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  and no one would ever know that Delta Force was there.
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  All right, stay there, folks.
[29:41.000 --> 29:44.000]  I'll tell a little bit more of this and finish my comments on it.
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.000]  We'll go to Bob Chapman and the latest economic developments
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  with the stock market plunging as we speak.
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  Stay with us.
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  We're on the march.
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:55.000 --> 29:58.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.000]  Hi, gasoline prices got you down.
[30:03.000 --> 30:06.000]  Is your vehicle not getting the mileage it used to?

[30:09.000 --> 30:12.000]  makes your fuel injectors and slowly robs fuel economy.
[30:12.000 --> 30:15.000]  Mechanics charge up to $300 to clean your fuel system.

[31:00.000 --> 31:03.000]  It is a big idea.
[31:03.000 --> 31:05.000]  A new world order.
[31:05.000 --> 31:10.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[31:10.000 --> 31:13.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[31:13.000 --> 31:16.000]  Doesn't their objective be world domination?
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[31:19.000 --> 31:22.000]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[31:22.000 --> 31:27.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  For the first time in history,
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.000]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[31:34.000 --> 31:38.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[31:38.000 --> 31:41.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[31:41.000 --> 31:42.000]  Most people have no idea.
[31:42.000 --> 31:43.000]  They're not after money.
[31:43.000 --> 31:44.000]  They have all the money they need.
[31:44.000 --> 31:45.000]  They're after power.
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.000]  That's what they have to do to you.

[31:55.000 --> 31:57.000]  In-game, blueprint for global enslaved.
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  You have been warned.
[31:59.000 --> 32:04.000]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother
[32:04.000 --> 32:05.000]  at some length here recently.
[32:05.000 --> 32:07.000]  She was talking about the Great Depression.
[32:07.000 --> 32:09.000]  We were talking about the gas prices, the food prices.
[32:09.000 --> 32:13.000]  This economic uncertainty were in these really perilous times.
[32:13.000 --> 32:15.000]  No one knows where we're headed or where we might end up.
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.000]  She was reminded of the Great Depression
[32:17.000 --> 32:20.000]  and how in those days, folks who lived in the country did okay
[32:20.000 --> 32:21.000]  because they had chicken and eggs
[32:21.000 --> 32:23.000]  and they could grow gardens and can their food.
[32:23.000 --> 32:26.000]  But how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the cities
[32:26.000 --> 32:29.000]  because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how.
[32:29.000 --> 32:31.000]  They didn't have the chickens and the livestock.
[32:31.000 --> 32:32.000]  So it was a lot different for them.
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  Well, we know one thing's certain right now.
[32:34.000 --> 32:36.000]  We're headed into much higher prices on food
[32:36.000 --> 32:38.000]  and there is a global food shortage.
[32:38.000 --> 32:39.000]  Now, what can you do to prepare?
[32:39.000 --> 32:40.000]  Do what I did.
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.000]  Go to the J. Michael Stevens, efoodsdirect.com company.
[32:44.000 --> 32:46.000]  Get some food and put it away and be safe.
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.000]  Put a little security in your life.
[32:48.000 --> 32:49.000]  You deserve security.
[32:49.000 --> 32:54.000]  Go to efoodsdirect.com, efoodsdirect.com, 1-800-409-5633.
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  Put some food away. Do it now.
[32:56.000 --> 33:25.000]  1-800-409-5633.
[33:26.000 --> 33:46.000]  1-800-409-5633.
[33:46.000 --> 34:07.000]  1-800-409-5633.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  Bob Chapman is legendary for getting time zones mixed up.
[34:10.000 --> 34:11.000]  He'll probably call in.
[34:11.000 --> 34:12.000]  He always calls in earlier.
[34:12.000 --> 34:15.000]  He calls in during another section of the show.
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.000]  Probably when Rivera is on next hour, I predict he'll call in.
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  He'll call in any minute from now.
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.000]  I'm going to go over the economic news regardless here in a few minutes.
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.000]  We've got Mike Rivera coming up in about 27 minutes.
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  Webster Tarpley, then Richard C. Cook.
[34:30.000 --> 34:36.000]  On this 7th day of October, 2008.
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  So we're playing some excerpts from CBS News to analyze it and comment on it.
[34:40.000 --> 34:50.000]  Partica, they have this Delta Force commander who is describing how he's spoken up
[34:50.000 --> 34:56.000]  for seven years because it never, in his five years with Delta Force,
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  and that means many years previously, either with Army Special Forces,
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.000]  the Marines or the Navy SEALs, as they take from all those groups, the best,
[35:04.000 --> 35:10.000]  that he had never come up with an operational plan in the field and had the higher ups
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  then say no to it.
[35:12.000 --> 35:15.000]  Now, this story is being reported in a vacuum.
[35:15.000 --> 35:23.000]  You have more than 20 cases of Predator drones and others over who they said was
[35:23.000 --> 35:37.000]  bin Laden or other top al-Qaeda, LCI-ADA, and the CIA orders the Air Force not to bomb them.
[35:37.000 --> 35:44.000]  And again, you have the other just regular Army, regular Special Forces,
[35:44.000 --> 35:49.000]  the Green Berets, the Rangers below them would capture people and be ordered to release them
[35:49.000 --> 35:53.000]  over and over again. It was a staged war.
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.000]  What al-Qaeda did is they would go grab conscripts out of the cities
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  and they would put them on the front lines in three rings.
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.000]  And then the Northern Alliance would ask the U.S. why are, and the British troops
[36:06.000 --> 36:13.000]  alongside them in the north, why are we only shelling the first ring of defenses
[36:13.000 --> 36:20.000]  and not the second or third? Because it was only for 15, 16-year-olds to die.
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.000]  They'd been forced down out of the mountains from their goat herding
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  and been thrown a collision car. It was a staged intelligence operation
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.000]  in a country run by the New World Order.
[36:30.000 --> 36:33.000]  Boy, now look at opium production exploding.
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.000]  And it's come out, the British and U.S. troops guard the poppies.
[36:38.000 --> 36:43.000]  It's so evil and it's in your face.
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  And so when you hear about this, remember the airlift of evil,
[36:46.000 --> 36:51.000]  6,000 Taliban al-Qaeda in two-day period flown out to safety
[36:51.000 --> 36:54.000]  out of Kandahar, out of Kabul.
[36:54.000 --> 37:01.000]  So then they have to have this legendary story about bin Laden up in the hills
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  up on the Pakistan border in the high mountains
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  and satellites in infrared can't spot them, can't kill them,
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  but the truth is they did.
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  Quote, who they claimed was bin Laden,
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  and then they would always say no to killing him.
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  The info we've got is that he was dying right around that time in Dubai
[37:18.000 --> 37:22.000]  at the American hospital, it's called the American Hospital.
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.000]  And that was reported by mainstream press in Europe, in France, in the Middle East,
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  and in England.
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  And of course, bin Laden, the CIA asset going back until the early 1980s,
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  codenamed Tim Osman.
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.000]  And so the Delta forces sent in, and then over and over again,
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  they're told no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  because they needed to have the legend of bin Laden live on,
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  that, oh, we almost got him, but we couldn't.
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  And we covered this again, my film I made seven years ago,
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  or just shy of seven years ago, 9-11, the road to tyranny.
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  Let's finish up playing some of this.
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  And that always is when you're talking about Delta Force.
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  There was no mission more important to the United States.
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  We'll smoke him out of his cave, and we'll get him eventually.
[38:06.000 --> 38:11.000]  But the administration's strategy was to let Afghans do most of the fighting.
[38:11.000 --> 38:14.000]  Using radio intercepts and other intelligence,
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  the CIA pinpointed bin Laden in the mountains near the border of Pakistan.
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  Following the strategy of keeping an Afghan face on the war,
[38:23.000 --> 38:30.000]  Furey's Delta team joined the CIA and Afghan fighters and piled into pickup trucks.
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  They videotaped their journey to a place called Tora Bora.
[38:34.000 --> 38:40.000]  Furey told us his orders were to kill bin Laden and leave the body with the Afghans.
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  Right here, you're looking at basically the battlefield
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  from the last location that we had for him on the Samaritans location.
[38:47.000 --> 38:52.000]  This ridge line is at about 14,000 feet, and back this way toward me is Pakistan.
[38:52.000 --> 38:55.000]  At a scale of, say, 1 to 10, 10 being the toughest.
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  How tough a position is this to attack?
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  In my experience, it's a 10.
[39:01.000 --> 39:08.000]  Delta developed an audacious plan to come at bin Laden from the one direction he would never expect.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  We want to come in on the back door.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  You were going to come up over the tops of the peaks?
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  That's right. The original plan that we sent up to our higher headquarters,
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  Delta Force wants to come in over the mountain with oxygen,
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.000]  coming from the Pakistan side over the mountains and coming to get a drop on bin Laden from behind.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  Why didn't you do that?
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.000]  Disapproved at some level above us, whether that was a Central Command
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  or all the way up to the President of the United States, I'm not sure.
[39:33.000 --> 39:39.000]  The next option Delta wanted to employ was to drop hundreds of land mines in the mountain passes
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  that led to Pakistan, bin Laden's escape route.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  First guy blows his leg off, everybody else stops.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  That allows aircraft overhead to find them.
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  They see all these heat sources out there, okay, there's a big large group of al-Qaeda moving south.
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.000]  They can engage that.
[39:52.000 --> 39:53.000]  Why didn't you do that?
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  Disapproved.
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  Why was it not approved?
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  I have no idea.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  How often does Delta come up with a tactical plan that's disapproved by higher headquarters?
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  In my experience, in my five years at Delta, never before.
[40:08.000 --> 40:12.000]  The military wouldn't tell us who rejected the plans or why.
[40:12.000 --> 40:18.000]  Fury wasn't happy about it, but he pressed on with the only option he had left,
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  a frontal assault on bin Laden's dug-in al-Qaeda fighters.
[40:22.000 --> 40:30.000]  The Delta team had only about 50 men, so the mission would depend on the Afghan militia as guides and muscle.
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.000]  Their leader was a warlord, a self-styled general named Ali.
[40:35.000 --> 40:42.000]  Ali told us after about 30 seconds of discussion, he kind of listened to me ramble on, and then the first thing he said was,
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  I don't think you guys can handle it.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  You can't handle al-Qaeda in these mountains.
[40:46.000 --> 40:54.000]  Ali, second from the left, met with this CIA officer and accepted millions of dollars in cash from the agency.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  Alright, let's stop right here.
[40:56.000 --> 41:01.000]  Of course, you've got the CIA playing the Delta Force like complete fools here.
[41:01.000 --> 41:06.000]  And here you've got this well-meaning Delta Force commander, it's clear to, easy to assess.
[41:06.000 --> 41:11.000]  He believes he's exposing bad command, but here's the government allowing him to release the videos.
[41:11.000 --> 41:23.000]  Here is the sent com, the Pentagon, allowing all this to come out because it adds to the myth that bin Laden was even in those mountains.
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  Of course, they couldn't let him go in and kill him.
[41:25.000 --> 41:33.000]  Of course, they couldn't drop the big daisy cutters that would suck the air out of any cave or kill anybody for a mile around.
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  Of course, they wouldn't launch a real assault.
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.000]  It was totally staged.
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  And see, if you just watched this TV program, you wouldn't know that.
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  You would think, oh, this was just this one case.
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  No, it was everywhere.
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.000]  And then all the jail breaks, the staged jail breaks they've had to release al-Qaeda out of prisons in Saudi Arabia,
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  Afghanistan, Pakistan, Pakistani intelligence,
[41:54.000 --> 42:00.000]  handling al-Qaeda, sending them the money, meeting with, well, Joe Biden in a week before 9-11.
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  I mean, these people are sick.
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  It's disgusting.
[42:07.000 --> 42:13.000]  And then you've got this guy who is completely well-meaning, basically like a well-bred hunting dog,
[42:13.000 --> 42:19.000]  who is just something that they play games with in the CIA.
[42:19.000 --> 42:25.000]  And so here he is thinking he's a whistleblower with his book, Kilbin Laden, and it just plays into the larger fairytale.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  Until you have the other pieces of the puzzle.
[42:27.000 --> 42:30.000]  Continue with the Mineslave.
[42:30.000 --> 42:38.000]  Ali, second from the left, met with this CIA officer and accepted millions of dollars in cash from the agency.
[42:38.000 --> 42:43.000]  In short order, his Mujahideen fighters were escorting Delta Force into the mountains.
[42:43.000 --> 42:50.000]  Millions of dollars by the CIA to lead Delta Force on a wild goose chase and not support them.
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  Force into the mountains.
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.000]  Paint the picture for me of these Afghan Mujahideen troops.
[42:56.000 --> 43:03.000]  They range anywhere from maybe 14 up to maybe 80, various dress.
[43:03.000 --> 43:09.000]  Basically, we would probably consider it rags, the standard dress for a Mujahideen warrior.
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.000]  This is video of the top secret mission never seen by the public before.
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.000]  It was recorded by the Delta commandos themselves.
[43:17.000 --> 43:23.000]  Dressed like Afghans, the Americans maneuvered up the mountains, calling in airstrikes on al-Qaeda.
[43:23.000 --> 43:31.000]  By day they would advance, but at night they soon discovered that their Afghan allies went home.
[43:31.000 --> 43:41.000]  Well, I have to assume that if you started up the hills of Torobora and the Mujahideen took territory, they didn't abandon that at night.
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  Oh, yes, they did.
[43:43.000 --> 43:44.000]  They gave it up to the enemy?
[43:44.000 --> 43:51.000]  Absolutely. The Mujahideen would go up and get into a skirmish, a firefight, lose a guy or two, maybe kill an al-Qaeda guy or two, and then they leave.
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  It was almost like it was an agreement and understanding between the two forces fighting each other.
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  Almost put on a good show.
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  Oh, rewind that!
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.000]  A good show, yeah, but you're seeing into one level of it.
[44:03.000 --> 44:15.000]  Are you strong enough mentally to understand history, delta force, and understand just how big a pawn you really are?
[44:15.000 --> 44:23.000]  Up the hills of Torobora and the Mujahideen took territory, they didn't abandon that at night.
[44:23.000 --> 44:24.000]  Oh, yes, they did.
[44:24.000 --> 44:25.000]  They gave it up to the enemy?
[44:25.000 --> 44:32.000]  Absolutely. The Mujahideen would go up and get into a skirmish, a firefight, lose a guy or two, maybe kill an al-Qaeda guy or two, and then they leave.
[44:32.000 --> 44:36.000]  It was almost like it was an agreement and understanding between the two forces fighting each other.
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  Almost put on a good show and then leave.
[44:39.000 --> 44:46.000]  Four days after arriving in Torobora, Dalton Fury was faced with a fateful command decision.
[44:46.000 --> 44:56.000]  Three of his men were in trouble behind enemy lines, and at the same time, the CIA had been listening to Bin Laden's radio transmissions and had a breakthrough.
[44:56.000 --> 44:57.000]  Oh, give me a break.
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  This is where it gets complicated.
[44:59.000 --> 45:04.000]  At about the same time, the CIA, George, comes into our room and he says,
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  Guys, I got a location for Osama Bin Laden.
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.000]  That's probably the best location that we've had on Osama Bin Laden ever.
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.000]  It was night, so Fury was without his Afghan allies.
[45:14.000 --> 45:21.000]  Still, he managed to rescue his men and then found himself approaching Bin Laden's doorstep.
[45:21.000 --> 45:27.000]  We're about 2,000 meters away from where we think Bin Laden's at still from where we're at.
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  Now we have to make a decision.
[45:29.000 --> 45:36.000]  Fury had two choices, advance his small team with no Afghan support or return to camp and assault in the morning.
[45:36.000 --> 45:46.000]  He was under orders to make the Afghans take the lead and intelligence said there were more than 1,000 hardened fighters protecting Bin Laden.
[45:46.000 --> 45:58.000]  You write in the book, my decision to abort that effort to kill or capture Bin Laden when we might have been within 2,000 meters of him, about 2,000 yards, still bothers me.
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.000]  It leaves me with a feeling of somehow letting down our nation.
[46:02.000 --> 46:08.000]  Let me just stop. This goes against all military doctrine. This is pure bull.
[46:08.000 --> 46:14.000]  The 50 would have attacked from concealed positions and called in airstrikes against those 1,000.
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  That is pure bull.
[46:16.000 --> 46:27.000]  A 2-year-old who knows anything about any military strategy and modern military strategy knows that is absolute garbage.
[46:27.000 --> 46:37.000]  Two Rangers put in to radio and intelligence and calling airstrikes would have done that.
[46:37.000 --> 46:42.000]  This is pure bull. Let's go back to it.
[46:42.000 --> 46:51.000]  Had we gone up that ridge line towards that location, some Bin Laden might have been 500 meters away. We might have run right into him.
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.000]  So there's always that doubt that we might have run into him.
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  We also might have got up there.
[46:57.000 --> 47:04.000]  No, he was fighting for his life in Dubai, pal. Go ahead and rewind it back to the puppet.
[47:04.000 --> 47:09.000]  So there's always that doubt that we might have run into him.
[47:09.000 --> 47:16.000]  We also might have got up there and found nothing. It wasn't worth the risk at that particular moment to go up there and play cowboy.
[47:16.000 --> 47:22.000]  It was better to be cautious and go up there with the entire force the next day.
[47:22.000 --> 47:28.000]  You got somebody supposedly killed 3,000 Americans. He has this $50 million bounty on his head.
[47:28.000 --> 47:35.000]  You're the Delta Force and you are cautious. Give me a break.
[47:35.000 --> 47:38.000]  Now, you notice we're making it all about that event.
[47:38.000 --> 47:43.000]  There were the other times where they, quote, had him in their sights and couldn't call in airstrikes or weren't allowed to go in.
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  It just goes on and on and on.
[47:47.000 --> 47:50.000]  But forget this story. This is just more evidence.
[47:50.000 --> 47:57.000]  Research the airlift of evil. In fact, Steve Watson, Paul Watson, Aaron Dykes, Kurt Nemo, one of our writers,
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  we ought to go back and pull all those airlift of evil stories.
[48:00.000 --> 48:08.000]  And then the Special Forces Colonel that was in the papers in the U.S. saying we were ordered to stand down and how they flew him out to safety
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  and how it was all staged.
[48:10.000 --> 48:16.000]  And even the CIA commander who wrote Jobbreaker admits, like we had him on a few years ago,
[48:16.000 --> 48:22.000]  that they were told to just go grab innocent people and not get anybody real and fly them to Guantanamo Bay
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.000]  for a torture laboratory to test torture. That was one part.
[48:27.000 --> 48:33.000]  But also to show the public, look, it's men with beards. They did it.
[48:33.000 --> 48:40.000]  It's all about a show. It's all about theater for the public.
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.000]  That's all they're doing. It's that simple.
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  They come back, cover the economy.
[48:46.000 --> 48:52.000]  And Mike Rivera was going to be on with us in Webster Tarbley, Richard C. Cook.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  But the public doesn't know about this. They still don't know.
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  They saw Bush say bin Laden's our number one target a year later.
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.000]  Who's bin Laden? I don't care about bin Laden. I'm not looking for bin Laden.
[49:03.000 --> 49:06.000]  He actually said that. He said, but so what?
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  We're not really targeting him.
[49:08.000 --> 49:14.000]  Forget Bandar Bush is nicknamed the Saudi ambassador at that time and Larry King live.
[49:14.000 --> 49:21.000]  Best friends with the Bushes and Cheney and King was saying bin Laden's evil, bin Laden's horrible, bin Laden's bad, bin Laden's a piece of trash.
[49:21.000 --> 49:25.000]  And Bandar said, how dare you say that about him? He's a great and honorable man.
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  And he didn't even do 9-11.
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.000]  I mean, these are rock star in Saudi Arabia.
[49:33.000 --> 49:40.000]  See, who carried out the Afghan attack on the Russians starting in 79 to get the Russians to invade?
[49:40.000 --> 49:47.000]  It was the Saudis, the Israelis in the United States, matching funds and logistics to go in there and do that.
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  And then Pakistan in the operation in 2001.
[49:51.000 --> 49:58.000]  This is a team that's covered in fabled enemies by Jason Burmas, the new film I just produced that we hardly even plug.
[49:58.000 --> 50:03.000]  I should be getting it on DVD folks at infowars.com or seeing super high quality at present planet TV.
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.000]  People need to see this. They need to know this. They need to understand it.
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  Okay. They love far away places with big mountains.
[50:11.000 --> 50:16.000]  It's a nice backdrop, far away where they can control it and give you whatever fairytale they want.
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  Just like they told the famous painter Remington.
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.000]  Hearst Publishing did. They said, you supply the pitchers, I'll supply the war.
[50:23.000 --> 50:28.000]  Remington went down there and said, there's no massacres, no troops, nothing going on here.
[50:28.000 --> 50:36.000]  And he said, look, fake them, fake paintings that we can then put into the newspaper.
[50:36.000 --> 50:42.000]  You supply the pitchers, I'll supply the war. And that's it. A staged war.
[50:42.000 --> 50:47.000]  The only war going on in Afghanistan is warlords fighting over the opium.
[50:47.000 --> 50:54.000]  Just like the U.S. is running a war in Mexico to consolidate the drug trade. There's real casualties there. That's over drugs, money.
[50:54.000 --> 51:01.000]  Same thing in Afghanistan. It's just unbelievable. Stay with us.
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.000]  Would you walk around with your credit card number displayed on your back for anyone to read?
[51:05.000 --> 51:13.000]  Of course not. But if you have one of the 50 million new contactless credit and debit cards in circulation in your wallet, that's exactly what you're doing.
[51:13.000 --> 51:18.000]  I'm Wal Augustinowitz, founder of Identity Stronghold, and we think this is information you need to know.
[51:18.000 --> 51:23.000]  You may not even realize you already have one of these cards because they look physically just like the old card.
[51:23.000 --> 51:29.000]  The difference is an RFID chip hidden inside the card that makes radio communication with the card possible.
[51:29.000 --> 51:33.000]  Right through your wallet, purse, or pants pocket without you ever removing the card.
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.000]  Pickpockets no longer even have to touch you to get your information.
[51:36.000 --> 51:42.000]  Our company realizes the privacy danger this represents, and that's why we manufacture the secure sleeve.
[51:42.000 --> 51:49.000]  The secure sleeve is a patent pending card sleeve that contains a radio frequency barrier preventing radio signals from reaching your card.
[51:49.000 --> 51:54.000]  You can get more information and purchase the secure sleeve online at idstronghold.com.
[51:54.000 --> 52:00.000]  That's idstronghold.com, or call us at 800-610-2770.
[52:00.000 --> 52:07.000]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[52:07.000 --> 52:11.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  bin Laden. This is his MO.
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[52:16.000 --> 52:23.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[52:23.000 --> 52:30.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:34.000 --> 52:39.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[52:39.000 --> 52:44.000]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com.
[52:48.000 --> 52:53.000]  Or see it in Super High Quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[52:53.000 --> 53:00.000]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[53:04.000 --> 53:09.000]  Is a dismal growth rate or rampant inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings accounts?
[53:09.000 --> 53:15.000]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard earned savings?
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[53:17.000 --> 53:22.000]  Individual retirement accounts and most 401Ks, 403Bs, CEPs, and other retirement plans
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  can be rolled over into self-directed accounts using gold and silver.
[53:25.000 --> 53:30.000]  There are definitely some do's and don'ts with this rollover process, and that's where Midas Resources comes in.
[53:30.000 --> 53:36.000]  Call us at 1-866-323-5665, and we can help you with this process.
[53:36.000 --> 53:42.000]  History has shown that metals will maintain your buying power, even if other financial assets are failing.
[53:42.000 --> 53:47.000]  It's not a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio, it's a question of when.
[53:47.000 --> 53:52.000]  So whether you're planning for an economic rainy day or a Category 5 hurricane, the solution is the same.
[53:52.000 --> 54:00.000]  Call us today at 1-866-323-5665.
[54:22.000 --> 54:51.000]  You know, they say the proof is in the pudding, and if you go back and you listen to this radio show for the last 13 years, you will see stunning precision.
[54:51.000 --> 54:58.000]  But it's not hard. The master planners, much of their criminal operations are public.
[54:58.000 --> 55:05.000]  We know the tricks they play, we know the way they operate, we understand the enemies, modus operandi, or MO.
[55:05.000 --> 55:14.000]  What makes them tick, and how they play different segments of the government and the culture off against each other.
[55:14.000 --> 55:25.000]  But 9-11 was a complete and total fiction, the entire thing, and that is now coming out more and more.
[55:25.000 --> 55:35.000]  The public is now discovering the facts, and that is certainly the good news.
[55:35.000 --> 55:46.000]  All right, right now the stock market is plunging yet again. It is at 9,760 points.
[55:46.000 --> 55:51.000]  So the way this worked is it lost 800 points and gained about 400 back.
[55:51.000 --> 56:10.000]  Now it's lost about 200 points, or 195.14. So we're looking at a 600 point drop now in the last two days, and it's going straight down right now.
[56:10.000 --> 56:19.000]  All by design, they need to blow the economy out, and then they will take the dollar currency, they will buy up all the real assets while it still has a little bit of value,
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.000]  and then they will pass on the hyperinflation to the American people, people of the world.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  The dollar will die as the world reserve currents, they're going to set up a new global currency, and we told you they'd do that.
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.000]  Now they are announcing that that is indeed the plan.
[56:32.000 --> 56:53.000]  What does 60% say, depression is likely, poll find 6 out of 10 believe, depression is somewhat very likely, seeing 25% unemployment, and millions of homeless and hungry.
[56:53.000 --> 57:19.000]  The poll also found that 29% feel the depression is not very likely, 13% believe it's not likely at all.
[57:19.000 --> 57:27.000]  But economists, even many who feel current economic risk or dire generally don't believe that depression is likely.
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.000]  They'll just tell you it's not a depression as they get the third army ready to deal with the American people.
[57:33.000 --> 57:41.000]  But again, they're going to implode things so bad over the next few years when riots and things break out that you will beg for the military.
[57:41.000 --> 57:46.000]  They're not going to unfurl a black flag of death and announce we're the evil new old order.
[57:46.000 --> 57:52.000]  They've got to brainwash the troops, they've got to sell them on the mission.
[57:52.000 --> 57:57.000]  No, it'll be helping women, helping children, giving people hot meals.
[57:57.000 --> 58:05.000]  And of course, doing some intelligence ops, arresting militia terrorists who don't like what's happening.
[58:05.000 --> 58:12.000]  The militia terrorist, of course it'll be the government, will attack food convoys and steal it.
[58:12.000 --> 58:19.000]  The kindless public will swell up full of rage and then the mass arrests can start.
[58:19.000 --> 58:27.000]  The 26,000 preachers hired to teach their flocks to submit to tyranny can fully activate.
[58:27.000 --> 58:35.000]  And then they can have a national draft and use the US population as the Hessian merc force for New World Order Inc.
[58:35.000 --> 58:43.000]  It'll be right back with Mike Rivera. Let's go ahead and get him on the line from Hawaii.
[58:43.000 --> 58:51.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:51.000 --> 58:58.000]  May I have everybody's attention please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[58:58.000 --> 59:01.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[59:01.000 --> 59:08.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was the stage? It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[59:08.000 --> 59:17.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[59:17.000 --> 59:23.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[59:23.000 --> 59:27.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[59:27.000 --> 59:33.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:33.000 --> 59:36.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[59:36.000 --> 59:42.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[59:42.000 --> 59:48.000]  Please rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[59:48.000 --> 59:53.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[59:53.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  Well, they got a coffee cup over at whatreallyhappened.com that reads,
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  the last official act of a corrupt government is to loot the country.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  International Bank of Settlements stated two years ago that they were going to implode the US markets by design.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  Almost three years ago, we reported from Bilderberg that that was also the plan.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  And exactly as we laid it out is how it's now happening.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  Immunity for the crimes of the bankers, the power to shut down and take over other financial institutions
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  that are actually solving to then pay top dollar for them and give that to select groups.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  The vice president of Goldman Sachs is the one that's going to hand out the $700 billion
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  appointed by his former boss of Goldman Sachs in complete conflict of interest.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  Henry Paulson. We've got Mike Rivera with us for the next hour.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  He joins us once a month. Also a great GCN Radio talk show host.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  And of course, my website for those who's joining us. Websites are prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  We'll talk about the economy, the CBC and others as well as CBS reporting that,
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  oh, Delta Force is coming out and saying they weren't allowed to kill bin Laden.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  That's old news. We'll get his take on that.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Where he sees the election going and a lot more with Mike Rivera today.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  Mike, good to have you here with us.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  Well, thanks for having me on the show today.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  And boy, what an interesting time we are in right now, isn't it?
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  Absolutely. Let's get into the economy first. Give us your breakdown on that.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  Well, obviously the economy has reached a crisis point.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  And I think this really kind of shows the downside of this globalism idea in that,
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  you know, I have long maintained that national borders serve the same function for economies
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  and then for the earth that fireproof doors do for buildings and watertight bulkheads do for ships.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  And that is they contain an accident.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  And when you block open those fireproof doors or you well open the waterproof bulkheads
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  to make it easier to move around, it all looks like it's better for a little while
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  until you have an accident and then you can't keep things under control.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  I have readers writing in and saying, why when the banks go down does it affect our market?
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Why when we go down does it affect them?
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  Why is Europe in such trouble from all of the American problems?
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  And the reason is the globalists took down the normal barricades that exist on national borders.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  We have European Union banks that were basically taking pension funds and whatever and investing them in U.S.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  mortgage backed securities because they thought there was no way they could lose money on those.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  And then our government turns around and gives tax credits out to corporations to shift American jobs overseas
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  to those other countries that are investing in our mortgage backed securities
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  and all of a sudden payments start getting missed and the whole thing comes crashing down.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  Continue breaking it down.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  Well, the idea is I know that there are two schools of thought about what's going on right now.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  One is that the economic crash is intentionally planned to pave the way for the amaro
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  and I have no doubt that those who are pushing for a North American Union
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  and a single currency are planning on how they can exploit the current situation.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  And then there's the other school of thought which is that it's simply accidents,
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  stupidity and greed run rampant and everybody looking out for themselves until the whole system breaks down.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  And a lot of current American economic thought goes back to this guy named Adam Smith
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  who created this theory that if everybody was just looking out for their own greed,
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  they would somehow advance the system as a whole.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  And of course this theory was disproven by John Nash, the mathematician.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  But even though he disproved it, people still like it because it sort of justifies that Gordon Gekko
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  greed is good mentality. What's good for me is good for the country.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  Obviously what we see here right now though is that everybody looking out just for themselves
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  is ultimately very detrimental and destructive of the system as a whole.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  And the bottom line is that in our country we stopped making products for money
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  and we turned money into the product and Wall Street's major problem is that
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  instead of just offering ordinary people a piece of investment in companies,
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  they started playing all these little additional products and gambling games that got out of control.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  The derivatives are really what's doing the damage.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  There's no doubt about that. Mike Rivera is our guest.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  I want to get his take on how all this is going to unfold.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  The incredible insider trading and conflict of interest about who's running the banker takeover situation.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  They say you can't predict the stock market.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  If you trade on a regular basis, you've probably heard that lie.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  But what if I told you there's a way to know which way the market will go each week a whole week in advance?
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  Do you think you could benefit from this kind of information?
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  The guys over at eminiforecaster.com put out a weekly forecast line.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  They call it a G line, which forecasts the direction of the stock market a whole week in advance.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  Impossible?
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  Head over to eminiforecaster.com and check out their forecast history to see for yourself.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  Eminiforecaster.com predicts the market one whole week in advance.

[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  That's now.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  We had sources inside Bilderberg almost three years ago in the 2006 meeting,
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  and they said they were going to start a global implosion through the subprime mortgages and blaming on that,
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  which we know is a fraction of the larger derivatives problem.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  Then, of course, before that, we had the IMF and World Bank documents.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  When Joseph Sticklets left the World Bank with secret documents about how they get countries in debt by design and blow them out,
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  they want the economy to fully collapse when confidence is lost so they can consolidate.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  We know that the private shareholders of the Federal Reserve, they're only a small group of banks that control the regulators over the banks.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  We know that we saw the last two weeks, the White House, the both party leaders in the House and the Senate saying,
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  Depression, Depression, Depression, knowing full well that would cause a depression, then they got their banker takeover bill with immunity and the new powers,
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  and really about $5 trillion in funding, according to Bloomberg and other publications, agreed to find print,
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  and then things started plunging as I predicted the middle of last week they would.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  Certainly, it's a real crisis for the people and most financial institutions that aren't in the inner sanctum of the money changers.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  But, I mean, gearing up Northcom years ago for a financial collapse, having the Third Army ready to activate October 1,
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  signing PDD-51 Congressman last week, and we had one of them on, told,
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  if you don't pass this, martial law will be declared, but in the words of Dr. Paul Craig Roberts,
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  the banker bill gives them financial martial law, so they got it one way or another.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  I mean, these are amazing things that are happening, whether they're doing it to try to maintain control,
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  whether they wanted to get us entrapped in debt, but it blew up in their face, and that does happen to bomb makers.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  Regardless, they are sitting atop it and proposing, as we said years ago, they would,
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  a world government run by the bankers with a carbon tax as the new bubble.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  That is on record, and now we've seen that proposed in all the major financial publications.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  That's a mouthful, microvaro, your analysis.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  Well, my analysis is I have absolutely no doubt that there are always groups of people who are thinking about and planning
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  for a global government of some form or other.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  But in this case, I think they may have stumbled rather badly, because while the spin certainly is that it's all those
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  mean old subprime mortgage holders who took out mortgages they couldn't afford and everything,
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  the reality is most Americans understand full well that when these people took the mortgages out, they could afford them.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  They could afford the payments, and it was all working out well.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  What put the screws to the American public is our government giving tax credits to corporations
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  to make it easier to move jobs to other countries.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  And, you know, if this was a deliberate policy, you know, which is only one of two theories.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  It was either deliberate policy or incredibly stupid.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  But if it was deliberate policy, it's going to make it very hard to sell a global government and a global currency
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  to the American people when they see the global interrelation of the various economies of the world
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  is what's dragging it down, not moving it back up again.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  And the problem with this bailout package is this has destroyed all confidence in the U.S. government,
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  all trust in the U.S. government, not that there was any left after Iraq.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  And so they can sit up there and say, well, we propose a world government and global currency,
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  but if the people of the world are saying we've had it with globalism, we don't want it anymore,
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  we want small regional little areas where we take care of ourselves and you take care of yourselves,
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  because the only reason to consolidate is to build empire.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  Mike, I mean, I agree with you, but what the people want is one thing, what happens is another.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  90 plus percent, thousand to one phone calls in the Congress against the banker bailout takeover,
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  they still did it.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  So my point is it is in the Wall Street Journal calling for a quote,
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  banking new world order.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  It is in the Financial Times of London.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  It is in the BBC.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  Kissinger and Soros and all of them are calling for this.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  And it's what they said they would do back in the 70s in the trilateral commission documents,
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  and they're not stupid.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  They know bailing out the institutions that engineered this and buying securities and derivatives
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  at 100 percent whatever value they say it is when they're really next to worthless,
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  and in some cases are worthless.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  They know that's going to destroy Main Street.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  They know that's going to accelerate the destruction of the dollar.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  So they are carrying out a path that will crater the economy to an extent that things will break down.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  There will be riots and the people will welcome the military.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  Well, that may be the plan.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  I don't think it's going to work out because the American people, the people of the world
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  are very different than they were back in the 1970s.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  The 1970s, the Internet was just beginning as the Arpanet,
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  and most Americans still trusted what they got from the media
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  and what they were getting from newspapers and the rest of it.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  And the rules that worked back then, the Cold War propaganda and disinformation rules
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  that worked back then don't work any longer.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  And so I think that the people that you're talking about are going to try for a global new world order
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  and a global bank and a global economy.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  I'm not sure that it's going to be quite as easy to achieve as they need to be.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  I totally agree with you on that.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  We're just looking at this from different, slightly different perspectives and angles,
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  and that's why we have you here.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  So extrapolating forward, in the 70s, they could fool 60, 70 percent
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  into believing the government loved them and wanted to help them
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  and was benevolent and wanted to give them kisses on the forehead
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  and was sweet and loving.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  Now you get 90 plus percent against open borders,
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  90 plus percent or 80 plus percent against the war,
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  99 percent literally against the banker takeover bill.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  So you're absolutely right.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  They are playing a 30, 40, 50-year-old game where they have media dominance.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  Even if they shut the web down today, the genies out of the bottle,
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  they are totally discredited in every poll and every number,
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  9 percent approval ratings for Congress.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  I agree with you.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  I'm saying they think they're in control.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  They're going ahead with this and it's not going to work.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  So it's like two freight trains going 80 miles an hour running into each other.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  What's going to happen here?
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  Well, obviously we're heading toward a crisis.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  I'm afraid we are dealing with a government that is more than willing to use violence to achieve its ends.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  We've seen that in Afghanistan and Iraq and even Pakistan,
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  where the U.S. government is perfectly willing to kill 20 innocent people to get one suspected militant.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  I think we'll see the same policy enacted here in the United States.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  We've already seen they're building these giant open-air microwave oven pain machines on the top of armored vehicles.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  Those are there to herd us where the government wants us to be herded.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  So the bottom line is we're coming up on a period of violence
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  directed at the American people by the U.S. government to get us to go along with their plans.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  But anytime somebody has tried that in history, it has not worked out very well.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  Hitler's 1,000-year Reich lasted only 12 years.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  The New American Century looks to be collapsing after just six or eight.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  It looks to me like I think it's going to fall apart.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  And I think we're seeing probably the 21st century equivalent of the fall of the Roman Empire.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  Well, Mike, I agree with you, but for new listeners, you're not just saying microwave guns and sound cannons.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  The Army came out in their official publication two weeks ago and said we're preparing for war with the American people,
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  civil unrest, non-lethal weapons with the head of the Air Force said two years ago,
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  use them first on the Americans, then we can claim they're allowable in war.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  They're illegal under international conventions.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  You know, we're the guinea pigs, and we have them hiring felons for the military, illegal aliens.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  I mean, they're going to make a go at it, and I agree.
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  If 1% of the public who has guns fights back, and it'll be more than that, if they try this,
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  those guys with microwave guns are going to get blasted.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  And, you know, I'm sorry I'm not bashing Iraqis, but, you know, the types of Americans they're going to be fighting,
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  and it's going to happen if this keeps going on are the former military people.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  I mean, I feel sorry for the military. They are going to get shot to hell.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  Well, they really are, and again, because the United States is a more technological society than Iraq is,
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  we're going to find better ways to defeat these devices.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  I mean, there are already some very good theoretical foundations for making those microwave vehicles self-destruct.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  And I'm not going to go into that on the air, but, you know, it's being talked about.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  And as far as trying to control the Internet and the alternative media,
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  you're probably aware the government ordered the shutdown of views in that last June.
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  And, you know, the idea was...
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  Explain to people that don't know what that means.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  Okay. Before there was the World Wide Web and browsers like Netscape and Firefox,
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  people shared information on a mass basis through a news group system called Usenet
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  that goes back to the early days of the Internet, even before it was the Internet,
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  when it was still the ARP.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  The whole BBS system and people had said,
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  well, they shut down the free web as they're announcing.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  Web 1, we'll go back to the Usenet. Uh-uh-uh.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  Yeah, yeah. In June, the U.S. government claiming that it was a haven for child pornography
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  shut down Usenet.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  Now, it's still available in other countries, and people who were using Usenet
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  are simply attaching to servers, you know, in other lands.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  But inside the United States, it's been shut down.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  The real motive appears to be that, you know, the government wanted truly anonymous mass communication
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  ended on the Internet.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  And, of course, there was a lot of pressure from the motion picture and recording industries
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  to shut down Usenet because a lot of material was being posted there that was copyrighted.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  But, again, you know, they found this child porn supposedly planted in about 80 different news groups
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  out of some 90,000 that were in existence.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  And so...
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  That's how it works. There's something...
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  I mean, that's like saying there's one bad person in Detroit, Michigan,
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  so we'll just make everybody leave Detroit, Michigan.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  Well, again, that's what we're seeing in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  The U.S. government gladly kills 20 innocent civilians to get one suspected militant,
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  even if they can't actually prove the militant was guilty of anything.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  That's the mentality and mindset we're seeing the American people right now.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  But they're, you know, they are trying to figure out ways that they can shut down
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  the non-commercial portions of the Internet.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  They're trying to figure out ways that they can limit people's ability to communicate anonymously.
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  They want a system where if you're writing from point A to point B, they can track it,
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  read it, and use it. But the bottom line is that all of this stuff allows them to watch ordinary Americans,
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  but people who are really intent on secret communications,
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  there are very easy ways to do this.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  Many years ago...
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  The whole attack is built around shutting down the general public's free speech
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  and sharing information.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  Yeah, that's exactly what it is, so that we have to go back to being dependent on the commercial media.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  But you know something? It's not going to work,
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  because remember in the old former Soviet Union, they didn't have an Internet,
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  but they had fax machines and this network of fax machines.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  Well, it's going to cost me about $2,000 a month, but we hope to get a sponsor.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  But we're putting in hundreds of regular landlines next week.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  They're already going in this week, so people can dial into those,
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  record the show that way, and then distribute it out.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  So we're already preparing for the web to be shut down here.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  We're already gearing up for it, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  This is not a joke. This is not a game. There's a multi-pronged public attack.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  We now have Senator Lieberman basically running YouTube,
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  ordering whatever he wants removed.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  Microbaros, our guests, whatreallyhappen.com, stay with us.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:07.000]  Sound familiar?
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?

[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  and projects a clear 90 plus decibel beep.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  Got the remote!
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  Oh, my keys.

[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us,
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million,
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  Though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and influence are strongest
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  have primary responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  They are called Illuminati, elite, opponents of the New World Order.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago,
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses,
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  the destruction of the earth and mankind.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  We will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  What does humidity mean to you?
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  That's why I'd like you to visit.

[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  Mike Rivera had one of the very first big websites on the Internet.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  He was really the guy that brought out most of the first information.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  He was picked up by others about the murder of Vince Foster.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  And he works in the film industry, works a lot of IT stuff.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  He knows of what he speaks.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  Remember three months ago,
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  Senator Lieberman wrote letters to Google, which also is on YouTube,
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  and said basically anything criticizing the government
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  is helping Al Qaeda needs to be banned.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  They had simultaneous hearings showing
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth,
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  which is getting peer-reviewed journals to document bombs in the buildings.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  They're very threatened by that.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  They put that in between video of Al Qaeda training videos,
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  saying this is Al Qaeda.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  And now YouTube is banning basically whatever the government wants banned.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  I mean, they'll even ban a beauty pageant
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  that has 30 seconds of Sarah Palin in it from the 80s.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  Just whatever they want.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  When ABC News is airing them killing the puppy,
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  throwing it off the cliff of the Marines,
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  well, we have YouTube banning it.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  They will still ban it.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  They will ban video of the troops shooting Iraqis,
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  driving down the road and cars, and laughing.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, it's already happening.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  That's only one way.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  So what are some of the other ways they plan to shut down free speech
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  if we break down what's going to happen in the future microvaro?
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  Well, one of the more obvious ways that they've been doing it is
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  they're basically trying to buy up all the key sites we've seen.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  Google and Yahoo basically,
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  even though Google is in serious financial trouble itself,
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  it's still out there acquiring other websites,
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  acquiring other properties to bring under its gigantic media umbrella.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  And we're basically seeing the creation of internet mega corporations
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  to rival the media corporations in the traditional broadcast arena.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  And I think ultimately they're going to create a situation
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  where they will lobby for licenses to be delivering content over the internet
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  much as the media corporations deliver content over the public airwaves.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  Well, that's now been proposed, yes.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  Yeah.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  Yeah, and I think that's going to be the next step
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  where you're going to have to have a license issued by the government
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  and subject to government control in order to be putting down material on the net.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  And explain that under internet too, that you're just interrupting
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  and the document what you're saying.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  Under internet too, that's just taking over the existing web,
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  upgrading it for higher speeds, and then you will go
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  under what they recommend 50 university carriers for orgs
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  and 54 comms, which will be private companies.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  And then you sign a sub licensing with them
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  and then they license you under a contract you sign
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  and then they can ban you like YouTube or MySpace.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  Yeah, basically that's it.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  They're trying to basically take the public internet
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  and re-corporate it and put it under control.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  But again, the wires that are out there,
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  people are going to find ways around it.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  They've been trying to ban the internet in China
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  and the IT guys, they're just finding ways around it.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  And it's a case of once the people know that there is truth out there to find,
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  they're going to want to go find it.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  That's just almost an instinct with people.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  And again, going back to the fall of the Soviet Union,
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  I mean, look at all the controls they had in that country.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  When you bought a typewriter, you had to type out a sample piece of paper
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  and turn over to the police so that if they ever found a typewritten document
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  they didn't agree with, they could match which typewriter it came from.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  And we're already seeing that here in the United States,
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  where color laser jets put hidden codes on the paper they print
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  so the police can find out who sent a nasty note to a politician or something.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  But even with all of those controls in the Soviet Union,
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  people with fax machines were just sending articles around to each other
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  until finally the government could no longer count on the trust and cooperation of the people
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  and the Soviet Union fell apart.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  And to be very honest, I think that's ultimately what's going to happen here in the United States.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  By the way, the Patriot movement in the 80s and 90s grew before the Internet
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  with the fax brigades as they were called here.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  And also with FidoNet, which was a modem-to-modem packet transmission utility
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  and a lot of that's in the middle of a revival right now
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  where people are digging their modems out of their garages
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  and they're going back to using the phone lines to connect their computers together
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  so they can operate outside the broadband cable net.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  And that's why the feds just shut down that old system.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  They can still do it over the web, but they shut down the old operating system.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  They shut down the use net, but people can set it back up again using FidoNet
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  because FidoNet operates completely separate from the broadband Internet.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  Well, bottom line, people had better appreciate infowars.com,
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  prisonplanet.tv, whatreallyhappen.com now while it's still got about 98% freedom,
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  but we can see the screws being put in.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  Also with Comcast and Time Warner announcing,
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  oh, we're only going to let you visit a few thousand sites.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  We're not going to give you access to the other sites.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  That's already begun in Canada and Texas and other places.
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  Yeah, that's definitely...
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  The problem is when you sign up for one of these really big Internet Service providers,
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  you have to use their gateways and they can control what you see.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  Here's an example. Just four months ago, I have several systems that we have
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  Time Warner Cable, Cable Modem, and now if I type a URL in wrong,
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  it doesn't give me a screen on my computer.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  I'm on the Time Warner website.
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  So, see, you're going through their gate.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  They're logging everything, tracking everything.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  That is the model.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  Mike, we're going to come back and talk more about how you see things unfolding
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  on the other side. Stay with us.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:54.000]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  Gasfreedom.info has the information you need
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  to learn about the newest hydrogen technology available.
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  Gasfreedom is an affordable, practical free energy device.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  HHO, also called Brown's Gas,
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  burns efficiently and provides the energy your car needs.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  In just 10 minutes, you'll discover exactly how this is possible.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  This is the secret the oil companies don't want you to know.
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  Learn how easy it is to extract energy from water to run your car
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  and experience the most powerful hydrogen cells available.

[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:12.000]  But who is the enemy?
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  Bin Laden.
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:14.000]  This is his MO.
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:20.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com,
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  or see it in super high quality,
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:58.000]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:07.000]  in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  Most experts agree that the water you drink
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  and regaining your health and energy.
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  cannot survive in an alkaline environment.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  Order your bottle of Alkavision Plasma pH drops now
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  by going directly to Alkavision.com.

[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:23.000]  We're back up in the woods among the evergreens.
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:26.000]  We're still in the log cabin made of earth and wood.
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  We're lived in a country bar named Johnny B. Good.
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  Who'd ever, ever learned to read and write so well
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  but he could play a guitar just like a ring in the bell.
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  Go, go! Go, Johnny, go, go! Go, Johnny, go, go!
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  Go, Johnny, go, go! Go, Johnny, go, go!
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  Johnny B. Good.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  Microbaro is our guest.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  We'll sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  Bowling in everything fit in English shade
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  Mike, looking forward to more of what we're going to see
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  in the near future, midterm and long term.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  Regardless of what's orchestrating the financial collapse,
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  the immunity, the power, the takeover,
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  the establishment knows it's not going to help Main Street.
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  It's going to hurt it with the devaluation of the currency.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  Bare minimum and everything is falling apart financially.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  The jobless claims are spiking
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  and we had 90% or close to 90% living on farms
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  during the Great Depression being self-sufficient
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  and still seven million starved death
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  according to university studies of the decade-long depression
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  because the bankers would kick folks off their lands
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  if they couldn't produce in some cases.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  Now we have 90% living in the cities.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  Of the 10% living in rural areas,
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  only about half are still self-sufficient.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  The rest work at gas stations or power plants or prisons
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  or at the local office or supply store.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  I mean, we've got world leaders talking about abyss,
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  total breakdown, everything's stopping.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  Trying to terrorize us into going along with this
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  or is that really a big threat?
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  And why are they activating the third brigade and the rest of it?
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  Well, I think obviously the government's first instinct
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  is its own self-preservation and survival
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  and we know that FEMA does not really exist
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  to take care of the people in the event of an emergency.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  FEMA's primary charter is to preserve the government
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  even against the people during times of a national emergency
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  and that's what its real function is
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  and what most of its budget and staff are focused on
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  is continuity of government and keeping the system moving forward.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  I think the U.S. government is well aware.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  They've pushed the population to the edge of a rebellion.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  That's the reason they've got the troops back here from Iraq
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  in the streets of America in defiance of Posse Comitatis.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  We already know the government is acting illegally.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  This bailout bill, the manner in which it was passed,
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  was completely unconstitutional.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  So we know the government is not even following the law itself.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  It's just doing whatever it takes to have another week
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  in power in Sodom on the Potomac.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  We know we've had massive election fraud
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  for the last several elections.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  We're seeing it again this time.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  It's just the people in power want to stay there.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  They don't want to give up the goodies and the perks and the privilege
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  and people who get to that level
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  generally are perfectly willing to do anything
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  to hang on to power including killing off
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  thousands of other Americans in a new false flag terror attack
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  to try and scare us back into submission.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  But the problem with using fear to control a population
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  is once the fear wears off and fear is very tiring.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  It's very exhausting.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  Once you get too tired to be afraid anymore
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  and you start thinking again,
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  you see what your government's been up to.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  That's when it really starts to fall apart.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  And the problem right now is Bush can get up there and say,
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  well, this bailout was really necessary and trust me
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  and nobody's trusting him because we know we were lied to about Iraq.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  We've reached the point where the U.S. government
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  really cannot effectively govern anymore
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  because of the skepticism and mistrust
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  and loss of faith by the American people.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  And a government that can't govern during the time of crisis
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  is a government that has eventually doomed to collapse.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  Now, you know, my view, both candidates are bought and paid for
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  about the same interest.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  That's proven.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  Why does Barack Obama,
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  who I know you're leaning towards thinking it's a new regime,
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  why is he getting triple the Wall Street money that McCain is?
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  And it really is true.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  They're threatening people with arrest if they quote lie about him
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  that that was true.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  They just arrested detained Corsi over in Kenya.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  I mean, I agree with Webster Tarpoli in that
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  that with McCain, you've got a dead duck.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  No one supports him.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  They know he's a criminal.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  He doesn't have any of that pizzazz or star power.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  But with the Barack Obama, they get a new fresh face to
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  expand their operation.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  And I've looked into it.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  I mean, Barack Obama really is the biggest gun grabber on paper.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  I mean, he says ban all your 308s and 223 rifles,
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  which is most of them, calling him, you know, some type of devil weapon.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  And I'm not weighing in.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  I'm not going to, I can't even vote in Travis County.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  We know we have a total election fraud here for over a decade.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  That's been proven.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  Some people say, well, who are you going to vote for?
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  I'm not allowed to vote here.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  It's fake.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  We've proven it.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  It's even come out in the paper.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  And the legislation, the legislative election commission said,
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  well, yeah, Travis County is allowed to double count ballot boxes,
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  falsify signatures, break safety seals.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  So, so, I mean, I understand that if I weigh in on either side,
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  that only empowers a left, right paradigm.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  But, but I mean, your take on that.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  Well, you know, Obama is far from being a perfect candidate.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  I wanted Ron Paul, a lot of other people did.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  And I think it's time that, you know, we, we changed the system to allow a level playing field for third parties,
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  because right now the way it's set up, the two quote unquote traditional parties have all the advantages going into every election.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  And it really is, it's not quite a locked door to a third party,
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  but they definitely make you go through several more hallways to try and run a campaign than the traditional parties do.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  The, the only reason I'm leaning toward Obama is because I don't want McCain.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  And I think McCain shot himself in the foot by picking Sarah Palin in a moment of peak when he couldn't get Joe Lieberman.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  And I think the reason that everybody is donating to Barack Obama right now is they want to be in good with the guy they think is going to win.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  And, you know, that's, that's really what's, what it's coming down to is the more it looks like you're going to win, the more money you're going to attract.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  And that's why that early campaign really is important because that perception is what drives the funding for the, for the latter part of the campaign.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  And I know there's a lot of vested interest still pushing for McCain to win because he's going to continue the policies of the Bush administration
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  that have allowed the rich to get richer and the military to get, you know, literally historic levels of funding.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  And I should add, and then continue, but I want your take on this before I forget, just because Barack Obama in most polls is nine points ahead,
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  and the electoral college, they are in a dead heat.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  I think the numbers have shifted slightly toward Obama as of the last time they did an electoral college.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  He's only got one more point, you know.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  Okay, but, you know, I think the trend is definitely there and the problem is that Sarah Palin really was the worst choice that McCain could have made for vice president.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  And I know his stated logic was he wanted a female vice presidential candidate to lure the disaffected Hillary voters,
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  but to pick up, you know, this ex-beauty queen, you know, who's opposed to abortion and wants the end of the world to come around, I think was a mistake.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  Now, I talked to our own Hawaii state governor, Linda Lingle, and McCain's people did not even call her.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  And now I don't agree with everything that Linda Lingle says, and she doesn't look all that hot in a bathing suit, and I'm sorry, Linda, but you don't.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  But she at least knows the mechanism of government, and she would have been a far more credible vice presidential nomination than Sarah Palin.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  So I think probably future history is going to look back at Sarah Palin as the reason McCain really lost it.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  Well, I mean, Mike, you're not, you're a smart guy. You know, they're just fronts and puppets.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  I mean, we've got Northcom saying it basically runs everything and you've got Congress being told if you don't pass this, we'll declare martial law.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  And the committee chairman are all either on board or blackmailed.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  They're getting ready to set Barney Frank, the pervert, up for Fannie Mae Freddie Mac for hiring his boyfriend to head one of them up.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  So it's just, I don't know. It's all incredible corruption there.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  And I hope that when the U.S. government collapses, and I really do believe that it's going to collapse the way the USSR did,
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  and we start to think about forming a new country that we just sort of go back to that constitutional system that worked for us for the first hundred years,
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  and why we ever let ourselves get tricked away from that, you know, where the Treasury controlled the money and we had currency of a fixed value.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  And all these things that worked for the common people.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  And then starting in 1913, we just got swindled by the bankers one time after the other, after the other, after the other.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  And we're in the mess we're in right now because we gave away our national sovereignty to private banks.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  And that is really the root of all of our problems.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  But specifically, as the economy breaks down, as confidence in the government falls apart,
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  and it doesn't matter to the establishment of the people that are against it,
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  they are just going to use their expanded police force to try to suppress the people.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  But what are the police going to do when their grandmas are homeless, and then their cousins are homeless,
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  and they're losing, and their dollar is being devalued?
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  I think we're going to see a societal breakdown.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  The bottom line is that the police state mentality, they don't really have enough people to control the United States.
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  I mean, look how much trouble they're having in Iraq and Afghanistan, where they're out there with tanks and guns and helicopters and warplanes and bombs,
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  and they still can't keep the places under control.
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  This is the United States of America. We've got 300 million people.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  We are technologically trained. Many of us are ex-soldiers, and we're trained.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  If the U.S. military can't control the streets of Iraq, they certainly cannot control the streets of the United States of America.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  Well, Mike, I just can't believe it's all unfolding, just like we said it would.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  A, do you think, how long will this recession last? When will it officially be called a depression?
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  Well, the definition of a depression is a rather arbitrary one, where they say...
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  Three quarters without growth, yeah.
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  Well, three quarters without growth, 25% unemployment. The problem is, we have to rely on the government to get those numbers, and we know the government lies.
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  We could be in a depression right now. We already know that the unemployment numbers are subject to reinterpretation and recalculation.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  They have these different categories that people who've been out of work over a certain period of time get shuffled off into these specialized categories,
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  so they're not counted in the immediate unemployment figures.
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  Yeah, they cook the books.
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  Yeah, they cook the books as the short version. That's the problem. When you live under a government that you know lies to you,
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  you have no way of knowing what the real situation is, and obviously the government is going to lie to put it in the best possible light.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  And they're lying to themselves, too. They're lying to themselves, too.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  Yeah, there's a lot of gross self-deception going on there. I mean, they even cooked the Dow industrial averages when it was really bad a couple of weeks ago.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  They said, well, we'll just take out AIG because it's such a downer.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  Well, they always do that. They're always taking losers out of the 30.
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  Yeah, and put craft foods in, which is always going to be a winner. It's still down to 70 today, as a matter of fact, as we watch this thing.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  But the bottom line is we can't trust anything that we're getting from the media or from the government,
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  and of course that's why they hate shows like yours and mine and the Internet is because they know Americans want to know what's really going on.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  And that's why the viewership of the mainstream media is in decline. Your audience is going up. My audience is going up.
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  Your blog, your website readership is exploding. My website readership is exploding.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  People know they've been lied to. They're angry about it, and they're coming to the alternative media.
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  And it's for that reason that any efforts by the government to curtail the alternative media are going to be too obvious to everybody.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  And that's just going to further fan the anger that's out there.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  Well, Mike, when you talk about exploding, when I get up on air and I talk about how almost any guest we call,
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  even outside the Liberty Freedom reality genre, even mainline guest, almost all of them have heard of the show and many of them like the show.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  We can randomly call up companies. We want to sponsor.
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  And I'm talking 80% of the time they know who we are with the first person that answers the phone.
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  And the majority of the time they're a fan, a small part of the time they hate us or are scared of us.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:31.000]  And we call Chuck Norris up to have him on. He's been listening for years.
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  He comes on the show and says that on the street and other parts of the country, other parts of the world, and you're right.
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  Your numbers are exploding. I look at them. Our numbers are exploding by all the web rating services. I mean, doubling in the last three months.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  And it's exponential. I don't see how the establishment can't bring in martial law or shut down the web because just looking at my growth numbers.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  Now, the problem is the alternative media is infiltrated by a lot of disinformation people.
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  It's infiltrated by COINTELPRO specialists who know how to get people in fighting with each other and then almost even countering it feeds into.
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  But we need to point it out. Any site that spends even a third of its time attacking other patriot groups.
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  And it's always those doing the attacking of specific people and then claiming that they're all against it.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  And these groups, they will savagely attack me, make things up about me, say I did this, say I did that.
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  They make something about you and countless others. And then they'll say, I don't understand why they don't work with us after they've spewed all these lies and propaganda.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  Of course, they're being deceptive. They know they're trying to deceive their audiences.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  Now, a small group of them are government operatives. And then the mockingbirds kind of hear it and parrot it.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  But it's kind of a social morbidity, a very morbid, very nasty mode. And I don't see it holding us back.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  I mean, we've really reached terminal velocity as they say where we're escaping out of this.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  But I see the enemy throwing in. Every trick they've got throwing in, just every form of propellant they've got to try to get us to tell us 9-11 truth is dead when it's bigger than ever.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  Or to tell us that the alternative media, nobody listens to it when it's bigger than ever.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  I mean, I'm seeing a lot of this intentional mantras to try to tell us that we're not having victories when we really are.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  Well, again, yes, they're throwing every trick they can at us. But again, it's the tricks that they used back in the 1950s and the 1960s.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  I mean, the attacks I see on you, the attacks I see on myself, they have not changed one bit since the dirty tricks that were being played by the FBI informants on college campuses during the 1960s,
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  when they were opposing the peace movement, when they were attacking the early civil rights movement, when they were attacking the early feminists.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  You know, all of these things they played, these games, they haven't changed one bit.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  The problem they don't understand and they never got is that your average American citizen understands that this stuff is out there now.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  Every time I've gone to a local peace march, there are always activists who are out there handing out flyers saying,
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  this is what the government infiltrators will do to try and make us look bad so don't fall for it.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  So these kids out there, they're smart. They know what's going on. They know how the FBI plays the game. They're ready to deal with it.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  And that is why all of these attacks that they're ladling on us right now on the Internet, it isn't working because the American people are vastly different.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  They're vastly more educated. They're smarter. They understand the government lies and plays dirty tricks to get its way.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  And just that awareness.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  We'll take the Michelle Malkin. They, you know, Fox News tried to set up 9-11 troops saying that we attacked a girl in a wheelchair.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  That letter came out that was bull. They tried to say that I was saying kill Michelle Malkin and all that. We ended up defeating them and making them admit it wasn't true.
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  Thanks for your help and others. So you're right. I mean, they're playing the same old tricks and it's only revealing them.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  Yeah, it is. It's become way, way too obvious. That's what's going on.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  And they really have never gotten a grip on the fact that the Internet has fundamentally changed the nature of information flow through society.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  We're in the middle of a cultural sociological revolution as great as when Gutenberg's movable type made printing inexpensive and most affordable by the common people.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  It's greater.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  It is greater. And the ruling structures have either got to evolve to a world in which it's much more difficult to lie to the people or they're going to go extinct.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  And I think that's what's happening to the United States because it carries the burden of so many past lies. It can't be truthful now.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  Mike Rivera is our guest. His website is whatreallyhappened.com. Visit it while you still can at infowars.com, prismplanet.com.

[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide, or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers. Our goal is to get these fine hemp products to you in the least amount of time so you can enjoy what the powder seeds and oil can do for you.

[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  There's a man going around taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame. Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  There will be a golden letter reaching down.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  The final segment with Mike Rivera always great to have him up with us once a month, sometimes even more often as things unfold.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  The hairs on your arms.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  I'm glad you brought up false flag terrorism. We've clearly seen economic false flag terrorism, whether they engineered the first collapse or not, the fair monitoring, there would be a depression.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  Instantly, if the bankers weren't given unlimited financial power, that was economic terrorism.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  Last week, there was a huge story put out by a white supremacist who always puts out this info and just huge hoax after hoax that all the banks would fold on Monday.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  When it doesn't come true, my site and your site get blamed for it when we were exposing it last week.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  Of course, it was pushing for the banker bailout, so we're seeing a lot of that.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  But again, as you said, the public is developing a palette, the taste buds, to be able to recognize what's happening and what's really going on.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  Mike, so I wanted you to specifically talk about in the last three or four minutes we've got false flag terror.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  You brought up that that is a prime concern right now.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  I want to agree with you. The enemy has already staged many terror attacks in the past. They staged the 9-11 attack when it came out that they'd stolen trillions, upwards of two trillion from the Pentagon Trust funds.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  That was in the AP the day before 9-11. We know that anytime there's a big economic collapse, that they like to have a staged terror attack to get people to rally around the state.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  Do you see that as an increased probability?
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  Well, I'm sure there are people who are thinking it's good for another try right now, but I think the fact that the 9-11 truth movement has been so powerful and so vocal and gotten the word out there that that has been the deterrent to a new false flag terror attack.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  Because if you think about it, Bush is only four months away from being out of his office, and it means he's not going to get his Iran war unless he tries something really desperate.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  That plain incident this morning may have been a last desperate gasp to create a situation justifying an invasion.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  But the bottom line is, I think anybody who's thinking about it...
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  Hold on, hold on. Don't glaze over that. Tell folks about the plain incident.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  Okay. Very briefly this morning, there was an airplane that was attempting to fly from Turkey to Afghanistan over Iran.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  Conflicting reports are that it was carrying senior U.S. military people, then the legislators said it was a Hungarian relief aid team.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  It was forced down because it was using an improper identification code, and the Iranians basically forced it down.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  But that happens here in the U.S. every day. If you don't have the right code, you get forced down.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  Well, anyway, the Iranians said, okay, you can go, and they let the plane continue on its way.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  And the reason it was interesting is because not too long ago, there was this revelation that George Bush had planned on allowing a U.S. plane with U.N. markings to get shot down over Iran as a pretext for invasion.
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  And, you know, we had the ski boat incident and the captured British sailors incident, and Dick Cheney was talking about letting a bunch of seals get killed in order to trigger war with Iran.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  They've been really trying to figure out a way to get this thing going, and they haven't been able to.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:51.000]  And the reason they can't is the American people are aware of the lies and deceptions. They are not falling for it ever again.
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  It's like Bush used to joke about, fool me once, shame on me, or shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  And the American people remember that they were lied to about Saddam's nuclear bombs. They remember it because you constantly remind them, I constantly remind them.
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  It makes it very difficult for the government to carry off further deceptions. Now we know that, you know, Georgia actually initiated the recent conflict with Russia.
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  Let me stop you. Let's do five more minutes. Think of Webster Tarpleon if you can. Mike, you can do five more. Can't you finish up?
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  OK.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  We'll be back in one minute. Yeah, I forgot to even cover that two weeks ago.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  BBC, Times of London, AP, they all come out and say, OK, it's admitted, NATO admits, Georgia did launch a sneak attack and then lied to us.
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  And that's plausible deniability. Of course, the U.S. was running the attack.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  Bin Laden.
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  This is his MO.
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:07.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more, fabled enemies.

[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:31.000]  We are now in to hour number three.
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  That's partly coming up in the next segment.
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  Then economists and story-emergency cook on the economy coming up in the fourth hour today.
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  It is the 7th of October, 2008.
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  You're right, Mike Rivera. I mean, it comes out that Dick Cheney was planning a stage terror attacks
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  by having U.S. Navy SEALs dressed up like Iranians and have them basically attack U.S. shipping,
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  U.S. naval larger craft, larger ships, and the Strait of Hormuz.
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  And the fact is, that was then leaked from inside the White House and then confirmed.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  So another issue here is, hey, we have friends in government at every level,
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  a lot of which laughed at us at first, but now they see the full horror
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  and understand just how serious this is. And a lot of them are scared of prosecution.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  They're trying to hedge their bets as well. Some of them aren't good.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  They're just trying to do the right thing for their selfish reasons.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  That's A. And then B, I want you to briefly comment on 9-11 truth.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  Each victory, we always said going back seven years ago, plus was to expose false flag terror,
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  bring it into the nomenclature, the public consciousness,
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  so that people would look at Kibono, who benefits,
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  and so that they would lose false flag terror as a useful tool of statescraft
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  on the national and geopolitical realm globally.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  And so it's been a fabulous, I mean, are we going to get convictions, jail time? Who knows?
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  The point is, it's been a huge success and it's only growing.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  Well, we're never going to get convictions. We're never going to get jail time for the perpetrators.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  We're never going to get the U.S. government to admit what it did,
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  and it doesn't really matter anyway, because we know what happened,
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  and I don't need the government to tell me that I'm correct in my conclusions.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  As you point out, the victory here is that we've educated the American people
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  that these kind of things do go along.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  There were no torpedoes in the Gulf of Tonkin.
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  The USS Maine was blown up by an onboard coal fire.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  Hoaxes are used to start wars all the time, and this was just another one.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  And knowing that, with the ordinary American man in the street,
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  Main Street USA Joe Sixpack, whatever you want to call him,
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  for him to be aware that the government stages these kind of tricks to start a war
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  means it's far more difficult for the government to actually pull that off.
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  Now, as I said before the break, our problem is that our current government
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  is carrying so many lies throughout its history that it really cannot start being truthful.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  So it's just trying to follow the policy of if at first you don't succeed, lie, lie again.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  And it's no longer in touch with the reality of its environment,
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  like any life form that gets out of touch with the reality of the changing environment,
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  it's going to go extinct. It's just a question of how and when.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  We may be seeing the beginnings of the death throes right now.
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  The Soviet Union, the collapse of the Soviet Union,
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  really did mark the end of the Cold War superpower mentality,
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  and it's a little amazing that the U.S. has hung on to that mentality ever since then,
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  trying to act like it owns and runs the entire world.
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  But I think it's about to collapse, and I am in agreement with Hugo Chavez
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  that it's probably going to be a good thing for the world at large,
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  for the U.S. government to kind of go away.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  And I know for a fact it's going to be a good thing for the people of the United States,
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  because right now, look at all the tax money you're paying.
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  We've got to pay for the empire.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  Yeah, we're paying for the empire. We're paying for the war machine.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  We're paying for all the money it's borrowed for the last hundred years.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  And the empire always wants to secure its home base,
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  so we're going to live in a slave-like homeland.
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  So, yeah.
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  Yeah, that's something that your listeners and readers really need to think about.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  If we were to work and sacrifice and accept 80-90% taxes
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  to try and save the U.S. government from its own folly,
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  what do we get at the end of all that sacrifice?
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  We still get a government that is reading our emails,
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  listening to our phone calls, watching us with TV cameras all the time,
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  refusing to trust us, groping us at the airports.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  Why should we work hard for somebody who treats us that badly?
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  When the easiest thing is to say,
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  okay, I'm just going to coast for a while
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  and let the U.S. government drive itself off the cliff,
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  and I refuse to follow behind it.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  Yeah, there have been empires that actually reward their minions.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  This one is viciously attacking its minions.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  The worst possible scenario.

[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  proudly presents the Alex Jones Show
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  Okay, Webster Griffin is tired of leaving joining us
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  quite a bit lately as the election heats up
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  into the last month.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  He talked about how a cane to dead duck
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  has no political support.
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  If he was to get elected,
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  it would be more stagnant New World Order.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:27.000]  But Barack Obama is getting three times
[2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  the financial support that McCain is from Wall Street
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  and the CFR Foundation elites.
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  And I didn't just believe tarply.
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  I was aware of those numbers,
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  and I've been looking more into them,
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  and it's actually more than three times.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  And so that's a bad sign.
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  And then, you know, I played this on air two weeks ago,
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  or a week and a half ago to be technical,
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  and listeners couldn't believe it.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  I played Missouri, St. Louis TV stations,
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  and read news articles where the police said,
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  there's a law in ethics against lying about Obama,
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  and we will decide what a lie is.
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  If you say he's anti-gun, we will come and arrest you.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  And, you know, they said all those things.
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  They said, we will come out and deal with you.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  They said, if you say he's a Muslim or coming after you,
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  if you say this or that.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  And regardless of if it's true or not,
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  it's your first amendment right.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  If somebody wants to sue you for civil damages,
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  that's the case.
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  But not criminal.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  And then it popped up in Illinois, in Connecticut,
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  in Vermont, and all over.
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  And then I had callers calling me off air
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  and threatening me when I had Tarpley on a week and a half ago,
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  saying, you need to be arrested, Alex.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  I used to be a fan of you, but you talked about Barack Obama.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  You're trying to help that bastard Bush.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  You work for him, and you're going to get it too.
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  And then they called on air and told Tarpley,
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  I want to come down there to the studio.
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  And I was like, are you joking?
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  And by the way, one of these people I know,
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  vaguely from events and things,
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  kind of a mainline Republican,
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  was now literally under some type of
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  Machiavellian Beelzebub spell,
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  saying he wants to arrest Tarpley.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  And then now, Jerome Corsi,
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  I interviewed him at the DNC a month ago.
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  He said it was going to Kenya soon.
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  He come on after he got back.
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  He was going to check the birth certificate.
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  He was going to go see the brother
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  who lives in a shack.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  You know, that Barack Obama doesn't help.
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  I mean, you know, I have a right
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  to say these things about bin Laden.
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  I don't need to be threatened.
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  And see, this really,
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  I mean, this is real.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  This is happening to me.
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  This is happening to Dr. Corsi.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  I don't care what you think about him.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  They have a challenge what he claimed in the book.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  They have only been challenging his credibility
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  or saying he's bad or something.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:35.000]  He said on the message board five years ago.
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  And the point is, is that they really are
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:39.000]  and I mean, they arrested
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  another individual into the National Press Club
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  to speak out against him.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  The official speaker and then Biden's son had him arrested.
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  I mean, this, can you look
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  when Bill Clinton was bringing in tyranny,
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  I was against him,
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  but said he was a puppet of the New World Order
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  of the global crime syndicate,
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  the Anglo-American establishment,
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  a CIA operative left cover.
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  I went on air, I covered that,
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  how he had, you know,
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  a court mire as his handler
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  over in London Station.
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  And people said, how dare you
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  right wing scum filth.
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  And then George Bush came in and I said,
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  he's destroying the Bill of Rights Constitution,
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  setting up edicts and martial law
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  and gutting the economy and secret arrest
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  and torture. How dare you,
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  you communist piece of filth.
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  And now I'm saying, hey, what, you know,
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  when McCain calls for using troops on the streets
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  to quote, fight crime, that's bad.
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  That's fascism. That's tyranny.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  And I got called a commie.
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  And then I say, man, what Barack Obama's doing
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  way over and above what McCain's doing
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  because he has the star appeal.
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  He has the well-meaning drones
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  who are just out of control.
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  We're going to get you, Alex Jones.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  So Tarpley is right.
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  Webster Tarpley was absolutely right
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  10 months ago when he started doing this
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  and he's had two books out now on it
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  because Obama, and that's why the establishment
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  has said he will bring people back
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  into trusting government, back into going
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  along with the system, back into the
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  new youth brigades. It's true.
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  Tarpley is right.
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  So, Webster, I want you to break him down.
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  Let me just point to two immediate
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  or maybe three immediate breaking stories.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  The first is, as you've said, Jerome Corsi
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  who is, of course,
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  I would call him a neocon.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  I don't agree with him
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  on many issues, but
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  he's written a very useful
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  biography of Obama called
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  Obama Nation,
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:31.000]  which tells
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  a significant amount of things
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  that you need to know about Obama.
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  It doesn't go far enough. It doesn't make the case
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  of Obama as a
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  poverty pimp, as a foundation
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  operative, and therefore in a general sense,
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  a government agent.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  And the deployment of this
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  Brzezinski Rockefeller-Soros
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  trilateral group. He doesn't have
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  anything in there about that. He talks about
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  him as a communist
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  or socialist and or
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  Muslim, and that is a certain
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  level of truth.
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  That's part of his left cover. That's like
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  really a CIA asset, Tim
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  Osmond. It's the same thing. You see the foundation
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  creature, literally
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  taken from high school and put in to
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  build this cred, this street cred.
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  Right, with the cover
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  story, as you quite properly say.
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  So the question
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:21.000]  of course is, we have the
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  Phil Berg lawsuit in
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  and in that lawsuit
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  the Obama campaign has now
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  made two legal steps.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  The first one was a motion
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  to dismiss the lawsuit.
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  Phil Berg is asking, we want
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  to see proof that Obama
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  is constitutionally qualified
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  to be the president of the United States.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  We want to see that he was born
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  inside the U.S. or a territory
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  or a possession, and secondly
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  that he is still a citizen, that he didn't
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  give up his citizenship at some
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  point. So the first response of the Obama
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  campaign to that is, we want to dismiss it,
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  we want to throw it out. The judge
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  has not granted the motion to dismiss.
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  You don't think if he really was
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  a proper U.S. citizen
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  or eligible run for president, his mother
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  living here 18 years before she had him,
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  and that would be the
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  level he needed
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  to clear legally.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  You would think they want to answer
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  this nagging question, but they never
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  answer these nagging questions. That's exactly
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  the point. Now the second one is that they say
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  we want to delay discovery, in other words
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  the moment where production, where documents
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  have to be produced, or even
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  interviews, depositions have to be
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  taken, they say we want to delay
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:35.000]  that. Now this
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  stings to high heaven, this to me indicates that he
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  is not a citizen, that he is not natural
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  born and or not a citizen.
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  I don't know which one it is, because
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  Phil Berg's
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  website, as people know,
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  Obamacrimes.com, has had
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  something approaching 20 million
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  visitors now in about 5
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  or 6 weeks. So this is a serious
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:57.000]  public relations problem for Obama.
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  If Obama wants
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:01.000]  to be president, he must produce
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  the so-called vault
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  copy of his
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  birth certificate, showing that he was born in
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  Hawaii, if that's where he was born.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  And if there's also this question
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  about when his mother, the
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  pro-communist anthropologist
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  Stanley and Dunham moved
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  to Indonesia where their husband, Lolo
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  Sotero, he may well have lost his
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  citizenship as part of being sort of
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  adopted by Lolo Sotero.
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  I mean that's what's so incredible. Look at how
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  the foundations, you know, they didn't
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  give us a black guy from the United States
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  with a clear pedigree as a citizen
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  and nobody cared. It's gotta
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  have all this. That's meant to stir up the left
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  and right once he gets in. I mean
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  the name, Barack Obama, you couldn't
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  write a script like this.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  Well, this
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  many complicated things feed into that, but I think
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  the basic legal question that really everybody
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  should be able to agree on is, the
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  Constitution has to be respected.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  It's either Constitution or Civil War.
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  I'll take the Constitution any day
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  and that means the president has got to
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:01.000]  fulfill those requirements.
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  So let the Obama campaign
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:05.000]  put this entire issue to rest
[2:16:05.000 --> 2:16:07.000]  by coming forward with the detailed or
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  vault, the AULT
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  copy of the original
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  birth certificate of Obama. They refuse to do this.
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  Now related to that is,
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  what was Corsi going to announce
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  in Kenya?
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:21.000]  Corsi went to Kenya, it seems to me,
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  and by the way, last time I checked, he's still in custody.
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  He was supposedly there looking for birth
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  records of Mr. Obama.
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  Yes, this is it. He's looking for the birth certificate
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:31.000]  of Obama in Kenya because there's a growing
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  body of evidence that Obama
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:35.000]  was actually born in Kenya.
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  And the police go out and grab him
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  in the streets after he already got into the country.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  It's outrageous and it seems
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  to me now, let's see what
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  these people from the American Civil Liberties
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  Union are made of.
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  All the human rights groups, human rights
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:51.000]  watch, Africa Watch,
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  Amnesty International,
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  are they going to come forward and say
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  free Jerome Corsi? There's another guy
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  with him whose name I don't have, who's also
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  been arrested. It seems
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  to me that they were probably
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:05.000]  thrown in jail. There's a good possibility
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  that they were thrown in jail.
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  They're being held. They've been held
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:11.000]  for at least 20 hours, it looks like.
[2:17:11.000 --> 2:17:13.000]  I would recommend the following.
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  There's a Kenyan embassy here in Washington.
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  Give the phone number. Why don't you call them up
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  and give them a piece of your mind.
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  This is 202-387-6101.
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  202-387-6101.
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  Call them and say
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  free Corsi and free his assistant.
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:31.000]  And this of course, what regime
[2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  is this? This is Obama's cousin
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  is doing this. This is
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  Odinga. This is Rila Odinga
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:39.000]  who is... Let me just add this.
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  This isn't about him being black.
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:43.000]  I made a film, Marshall Law, 9-1-1
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:45.000]  which is going to be called
[2:17:45.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  The Last Third of it in an hours.
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:49.000]  It's about Arnold Schwarzenegger's dad,
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  the SS captain running a whole area.
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:53.000]  His mother, after his dad dies,
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  marries the number two
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  in the SS in Austria.
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:17:59.000]  He runs around saying he loves Hitler,
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  wants to be a dictator, so he shouldn't
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  be able to be governor. He shouldn't be able
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:05.000]  to be president. You know, we're against
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  foreigners and that's why we have laws
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  against that, because in Europe,
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  we had Austria of all places
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  200 years ago, plus, in trying to send in their people in other areas of Europe to take
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:21.920]  it over, and so that's why countries have laws, you've got to have a clear pedigree
[2:18:21.920 --> 2:18:22.920]  in that country.
[2:18:22.920 --> 2:18:27.320]  It goes back with the CIA and FBI, wouldn't trust somebody to be high level if you didn't
[2:18:27.320 --> 2:18:29.280]  have four or five generations here.
[2:18:29.280 --> 2:18:34.600]  Yes, well, in this case, the Constitution is absolutely categorical that you've got
[2:18:34.600 --> 2:18:40.760]  to be born in a state territorial possession, and you've got to be a citizen, and I think
[2:18:40.760 --> 2:18:43.040]  that's the big question for Obama.
[2:18:43.040 --> 2:18:46.960]  The other side of it, of course, is suppose Obama gets into office with this horrible
[2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:49.520]  secret, there's another way they can blackmail him.
[2:18:49.520 --> 2:18:50.520]  In other words, the banking...
[2:18:50.520 --> 2:18:51.520]  Yeah, it's compromised.
[2:18:51.520 --> 2:18:55.800]  Webster, why are they so ready to threaten arrest, order arrest, or to bully?
[2:18:55.800 --> 2:19:01.080]  I mean, they are acting like George Bush before George Bush even got in office.
[2:19:01.080 --> 2:19:04.960]  They're doing Hitlerian police state things before they even have the power.
[2:19:04.960 --> 2:19:08.400]  Well, this is what I try to call attention to, these two books, right?
[2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:12.080]  Obama, the post-modern coup, the making of a Manchurian candidate, which you have, I
[2:19:12.080 --> 2:19:18.360]  believe, in your bookshop, and Barack H. Obama, the unauthorized biography, which you may
[2:19:18.360 --> 2:19:24.040]  have or which is otherwise at Amazon for people who want to get it there.
[2:19:24.040 --> 2:19:27.320]  The question of the fascist mass movement, I think, is central.
[2:19:27.320 --> 2:19:31.480]  Under Bush Cheney, you could expect probably the worst thing that's going to happen to
[2:19:31.480 --> 2:19:36.560]  you is a couple of FBI agents come and harass you, and this, of course, is unpleasant, but
[2:19:36.560 --> 2:19:42.800]  it's no relation to a fascist mob that comes to burn you out, beat you up, kill you, rape
[2:19:42.800 --> 2:19:45.000]  your wife, and so forth.
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:49.880]  This is the difference between an authoritarian police state and a fascist mass movement.
[2:19:49.880 --> 2:19:53.720]  Well, there's no doubt he's got the posse.
[2:19:53.720 --> 2:19:55.640]  Obama has a posse.
[2:19:55.640 --> 2:19:59.880]  They're ready to come after anybody that speaks out against him, and that's on American.

[2:21:00.720 --> 2:21:06.520]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:07.520]  against this country.
[2:21:07.520 --> 2:21:10.200]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:21:10.200 --> 2:21:12.200]  But who is the enemy?
[2:21:12.200 --> 2:21:13.200]  Bin Laden.
[2:21:13.200 --> 2:21:14.200]  This is his MO.
[2:21:14.200 --> 2:21:15.200]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:21:15.200 --> 2:21:17.200]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:21:17.200 --> 2:21:22.040]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:21:22.040 --> 2:21:24.440]  networks inside the United States.
[2:21:24.440 --> 2:21:28.440]  But some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged
[2:21:28.440 --> 2:21:31.280]  in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:21:31.280 --> 2:21:35.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:40.440]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:21:40.440 --> 2:21:44.560]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[2:21:44.560 --> 2:21:45.560]  much more.
[2:21:45.560 --> 2:21:46.560]  Fabled Enemies.

[2:22:01.120 --> 2:22:06.840]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around
[2:22:06.840 --> 2:22:10.400]  the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[2:22:10.400 --> 2:22:14.760]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic
[2:22:14.760 --> 2:22:18.480]  diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[2:22:18.480 --> 2:22:23.240]  In fact, clinically-detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[2:22:23.240 --> 2:22:25.880]  Americans continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[2:22:25.880 --> 2:22:30.560]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol, naturally
[2:22:30.560 --> 2:22:31.560]  and safely.
[2:22:31.560 --> 2:22:36.360]  By mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage

[2:23:15.320 --> 2:23:19.960]  Spray your plate is a spray on photo blocker that protects against all types of cameras.
[2:23:19.960 --> 2:23:24.600]  Spray your plate photo blocker spray reflects and protects against flash photo images making
[2:23:24.600 --> 2:23:26.280]  your plate unreadable.
[2:23:26.280 --> 2:23:31.400]  One can of photo blocker will pay for itself many times over, last forever, and is completely
[2:23:31.400 --> 2:23:32.400]  undetectable.

[2:23:58.400 --> 2:24:07.400]  Don't give your money to the state, spray your plate.
[2:24:07.400 --> 2:24:18.800]  All right, Webster, let's finish up with Obama because the New World Order are really
[2:24:18.800 --> 2:24:19.800]  racist.
[2:24:19.800 --> 2:24:20.800]  I found that at the top.
[2:24:20.800 --> 2:24:24.920]  I mean, look at their exterminating blacks all over Africa.
[2:24:24.920 --> 2:24:27.840]  People worldwide, period, they particularly hate Africans.
[2:24:27.840 --> 2:24:35.320]  Imagine, they may forever destroy the name of black politicians in Western politics and
[2:24:35.320 --> 2:24:37.320]  they've hired so many other monsters in Africa.
[2:24:37.320 --> 2:24:41.560]  I mean, could it be that that's the president we'll have with the FEMA camps and the roundups
[2:24:41.560 --> 2:24:47.720]  and with vitriolic, you know, that will get the inner city folks behind it?
[2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:48.960]  Like you said, the left cover.
[2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:54.040]  I'm really starting to get horrified that it looks like you're right, Webster.
[2:24:54.040 --> 2:25:00.320]  The difference is when you have a top-down dictatorship, which is simply a police state
[2:25:00.320 --> 2:25:03.920]  that becomes more and more oppressive and this police state would still have a long
[2:25:03.920 --> 2:25:09.160]  ways to go until it got as oppressive as a police state dictatorship could be, you
[2:25:09.160 --> 2:25:15.200]  reach a point where the police are no longer enough and the army is not reliable because
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:19.640]  if you've seen so many revolutions, you know, Bolshevik revolution, a couple of divisions
[2:25:19.640 --> 2:25:20.640]  arrive.
[2:25:20.640 --> 2:25:25.480]  They're supposed to quell the rebellion in the city and they go over and support the
[2:25:25.480 --> 2:25:28.520]  insurrection or the revolution or whatever it is.
[2:25:28.520 --> 2:25:34.320]  Therefore, there's got to be a third element added and this is what came out of Italy in
[2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:42.040]  1919, which is a fascist mass movement, which is initially composed of left-wing socialists,
[2:25:42.040 --> 2:25:43.040]  revolutionary socialists.
[2:25:43.040 --> 2:25:47.560]  They've now seen the CIA in Eastern Europe doing the very same color revolutions that
[2:25:47.560 --> 2:25:49.440]  give them grassroots cover.
[2:25:49.440 --> 2:25:55.120]  They've reduced this to a cookbook, but revolutionary socialists like Mussolini, the creative class,
[2:25:55.120 --> 2:26:00.120]  you've got to remember that the most prominent writer in Italy, Danunzio, the most prominent
[2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:06.200]  painter, Marinetti, the most prominent sculptor, the most prominent architect, all were fascists.
[2:26:06.200 --> 2:26:10.720]  So the idea that intellectuals like Obama and so forth or university students, remember
[2:26:10.720 --> 2:26:11.720]  that universities...
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:18.440]  So Mussolini got the famous U.S. playwright who had won all the big prizes.
[2:26:18.440 --> 2:26:19.440]  What was his name?
[2:26:19.440 --> 2:26:22.120]  He wrote the first book on the Federal Reserve.
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:23.120]  What was his name?
[2:26:23.120 --> 2:26:24.120]  Oh, Ezra Pound.
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:25.120]  Yes, that's a little bit later.
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:31.880]  Ezra Pound, the sort of fascist poet, I guess, became a radio broadcast for Mussolini.
[2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:36.520]  But in the original movement, a lot of people were very excited about this.
[2:26:36.520 --> 2:26:41.520]  In particular, university students, university professors, campuses generally speaking were
[2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:44.200]  hotbeds of fascism and Nazism.
[2:26:44.200 --> 2:26:48.080]  So the idea that students like Obama, this is an automatically a good thing.
[2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:49.080]  This is not true.
[2:26:49.080 --> 2:26:52.840]  And by the way, those that don't think there weren't black fascists and even Nazis don't
[2:26:52.840 --> 2:26:53.840]  know the history.
[2:26:53.840 --> 2:27:00.400]  The Nazis had giant African cores, black Nazis, Asian Nazis.
[2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:04.240]  Well, it had a worldwide appeal, but I think that the race issue...
[2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:06.600]  The race issue is really not the main thing.
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:08.360]  The race issue is a tool, but the...
[2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:12.200]  No, I know, but the public is thinking of a black guy and they're saying it's impossible
[2:27:12.200 --> 2:27:17.480]  that he could be a fascist because fascism has falsely a racial connotation because of
[2:27:17.480 --> 2:27:18.480]  the Nazi strain.
[2:27:18.480 --> 2:27:24.040]  You've also got to look at fascism in the defeated countries of World War I, like Germany,
[2:27:24.040 --> 2:27:25.040]  Italy was one thing.
[2:27:25.040 --> 2:27:29.800]  But there's also, as I go through in this book, Barack H. Obama, the unauthorized biography,
[2:27:29.800 --> 2:27:32.160]  there are also two cases that we would like to point to.
[2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:37.520]  One is, fascism in Britain, there was a group called the British Union of Fascists with
[2:27:37.520 --> 2:27:43.840]  Sir Oswald Mosley, and this was a kind of a pro-Hitler, pro-Muslimy group inside Britain.
[2:27:43.840 --> 2:27:46.600]  And they were not warlike in any particular way.
[2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:50.960]  As a matter of fact, their idea was to keep Britain out of the war while Hitler went after
[2:27:50.960 --> 2:27:51.960]  Stalin.
[2:27:51.960 --> 2:27:55.120]  They would make sure that Britain did not get involved in the war.
[2:27:55.120 --> 2:27:58.000]  So this is maybe a little bit similar to what's going on now.
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  The Brzezinski...
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:02.800]  And this son is the head of Formula One and just got caught in the big Nazi orgy.
[2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:03.800]  Really?
[2:28:03.800 --> 2:28:04.800]  And then you have...
[2:28:04.800 --> 2:28:08.680]  The other one is that there's a French example, the so-called French popular party, Parti
[2:28:08.680 --> 2:28:12.440]  Populaire Français, with a leader who was a former communist.
[2:28:12.440 --> 2:28:16.440]  And they're also pretty much on this line, let's not get involved in foreign wars.
[2:28:16.440 --> 2:28:19.480]  And then you have to ask, what are the main constituents of fascism?
[2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:24.960]  Well, these things like the founding of a new man, the overcoming of class struggle.
[2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:25.960]  Very important.
[2:28:25.960 --> 2:28:30.160]  No partisanship, no class struggle, but only national unity.
[2:28:30.160 --> 2:28:32.240]  It's exactly what Obama preaches the whole time.
[2:28:32.240 --> 2:28:36.280]  Anyway, in my book, I go through about a dozen characteristics of this.
[2:28:36.280 --> 2:28:39.120]  One of the interesting characteristics is the hatred of women.
[2:28:39.120 --> 2:28:45.640]  If you had to say, what is a key characteristic that fascist movements from Salazar in Portugal
[2:28:45.640 --> 2:28:51.760]  to Franco in Spain and Pétain in France, all the way out to Corduiano in Romania, what's
[2:28:51.760 --> 2:28:53.000]  the one thing they all share?
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:54.080]  They hate women.
[2:28:54.080 --> 2:28:55.080]  And you see this now with...
[2:28:55.080 --> 2:28:57.520]  You've seen it with Hillary Clinton, you've seen it with Palin.
[2:28:57.520 --> 2:29:01.060]  There's an extra added animus that comes in.
[2:29:01.060 --> 2:29:04.560]  So the idea now is that something new has been added to the mix.
[2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:11.400]  The most dangerous candidate is the one who has a fascist movement or a reasonable facsimile
[2:29:11.400 --> 2:29:12.400]  thereof.
[2:29:12.400 --> 2:29:16.960]  What I mean by that is, the Mussolini's March on Rome had a big element of political theater
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:17.960]  in it.
[2:29:17.960 --> 2:29:21.880]  And indeed, the army commander at that time said to the king, look, if I open fire for
[2:29:21.880 --> 2:29:24.720]  five minutes, I can sweep these people away.
[2:29:24.720 --> 2:29:25.720]  That's true.
[2:29:25.720 --> 2:29:30.280]  But they needed the appearance of a mass movement so that you can impose austerity and
[2:29:30.280 --> 2:29:32.640]  then go to war.
[2:29:32.640 --> 2:29:37.400]  And now we have them with the eugenics, carbon taxes being set up in Europe and the U.S.,
[2:29:37.400 --> 2:29:39.120]  all set up with the fake right wing.
[2:29:39.120 --> 2:29:40.520]  People rebuke it, bring in the left.
[2:29:40.520 --> 2:29:41.520]  Yes, that's it.
[2:29:41.520 --> 2:29:42.520]  Stay there.
[2:29:42.520 --> 2:29:43.520]  Stay there.
[2:29:43.520 --> 2:29:44.520]  We've got a break.
[2:29:44.520 --> 2:29:46.280]  Webster Tarpley, riveting, powerful, compelling.
[2:29:46.280 --> 2:29:52.080]  We'll talk to you after a quick break.
[2:29:52.080 --> 2:29:55.800]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[2:29:55.800 --> 2:30:01.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:01.920 --> 2:30:06.000]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:07.960]  energy and vibrant health?
[2:30:07.960 --> 2:30:13.120]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of nine or higher.
[2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:18.080]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[2:30:18.080 --> 2:30:22.080]  This product is a one of a kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:27.080]  Alkalizing plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping
[2:30:27.080 --> 2:30:30.560]  you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[2:30:30.560 --> 2:30:36.800]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[2:30:36.800 --> 2:30:41.400]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[2:30:41.400 --> 2:30:42.400]  of your body.
[2:30:42.400 --> 2:30:47.640]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[2:31:00.400 --> 2:31:03.400]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[2:31:03.400 --> 2:31:05.400]  I've come with a message of information.
[2:31:05.400 --> 2:31:06.400]  9-11 was an inside job.
[2:31:06.400 --> 2:31:07.400]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[2:31:07.400 --> 2:31:08.400]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[2:31:08.400 --> 2:31:09.400]  I'll do it.
[2:31:09.400 --> 2:31:10.400]  The American people know that 9-11 was a stage.
[2:31:10.400 --> 2:31:11.400]  It was engineered by you.
[2:31:11.400 --> 2:31:12.400]  David Rockefeller, the prolator for the New World Order.
[2:31:12.400 --> 2:31:13.400]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[2:31:13.400 --> 2:31:14.400]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[2:31:14.400 --> 2:31:21.400]  The stage was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the prolator for the New World Order.
[2:31:21.400 --> 2:31:26.160]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[2:31:26.160 --> 2:31:28.160]  to grow at our own door.
[2:31:28.160 --> 2:31:34.160]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:31:34.160 --> 2:31:36.680]  An inside job?
[2:31:36.680 --> 2:31:37.680]  How dare you?
[2:31:37.680 --> 2:31:44.200]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:31:44.200 --> 2:31:47.200]  The whole hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:31:47.200 --> 2:31:51.960]  If the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary
[2:31:51.960 --> 2:31:52.960]  of 9-11.
[2:31:52.960 --> 2:31:53.960]  It's rising.

[2:31:58.640 --> 2:32:01.080]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:32:01.080 --> 2:32:05.480]  You know, as a father and a husband, one of the enjoyable things in my life has been walking
[2:32:05.480 --> 2:32:09.680]  in at night and checking on my children, checking up on my wife, making sure she has the things
[2:32:09.680 --> 2:32:14.320]  she needs, but mostly providing for my family and knowing that they are secure, that they
[2:32:14.320 --> 2:32:18.240]  feel comfortable every day in their little skins, they don't have to worry about the
[2:32:18.240 --> 2:32:21.240]  oddities of the world taking over and wrecking their lives.
[2:32:21.240 --> 2:32:23.360]  I've always wanted to be a good provider.
[2:32:23.360 --> 2:32:27.280]  And I'm not going to change that now just because the economy is in up evil and because
[2:32:27.280 --> 2:32:29.760]  there's a lot of political and social uncertainty.
[2:32:29.760 --> 2:32:34.360]  And I hear about global famines and I see the escalating prices in gas and food and
[2:32:34.360 --> 2:32:35.360]  oil.
[2:32:35.360 --> 2:32:36.760]  Electricity is going to go way up until this winter.
[2:32:36.760 --> 2:32:37.960]  Hey, I'm not going to sweat it.
[2:32:37.960 --> 2:32:39.040]  I've done the right thing.
[2:32:39.040 --> 2:32:41.440]  I got rid of a bunch of junk and toys out in the garage.
[2:32:41.440 --> 2:32:43.360]  I converted that money into food.
[2:32:43.360 --> 2:32:44.360]  That food's out there.
[2:32:44.360 --> 2:32:45.960]  I've got a two or three year supply of food in the garage.
[2:32:45.960 --> 2:32:47.120]  My family's secure.
[2:32:47.120 --> 2:32:48.120]  I don't got to worry.
[2:32:48.120 --> 2:32:49.120]  Okay.
[2:32:49.120 --> 2:32:51.360]  I do hope that you'll join me in this new sense of American security.
[2:32:51.360 --> 2:32:52.880]  Call eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:32:52.880 --> 2:32:57.120]  That's eFoodsDirect.com or 1-800-409-5633.
[2:32:57.120 --> 2:32:59.800]  That's 800-409-5633.
[2:32:59.800 --> 2:33:00.800]  Call them today.
[2:33:00.800 --> 2:33:01.800]  You'll be glad you did.
[2:33:01.800 --> 2:33:10.480]  What if I say I'm not like the other, what if I say I'm not just another part of your
[2:33:10.480 --> 2:33:14.680]  place, you're the defender, what if I say I'm never surrender, what if I say I'm not like
[2:33:14.680 --> 2:33:32.680]  the other, what if I say I'm not just another part of your place, you're the defender, what
[2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:39.200]  in the control paradigm. Right now you've got Obama about nine points ahead in most
[2:33:39.200 --> 2:33:45.720]  polls. It's a dead heat with Obama, maybe one more liberal college point than McCain
[2:33:45.720 --> 2:33:51.920]  right now. And I've been watching the media carefully. There's clearly a bias against
[2:33:51.920 --> 2:33:56.520]  John McCain. And folks, John McCain is pure evil. I'm not supporting John McCain here.
[2:33:56.520 --> 2:34:01.800]  I'm just reporting the facts. And every day more evidence is piled on. Dr. Corsi arrested,
[2:34:01.800 --> 2:34:06.680]  kidnapped, being held by the government who he got in and they found him on the streets
[2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:13.000]  out trying to, and I talked to him. He said he was going off the record to Kenya to try
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:16.560]  to get the birth certificate. He said, I'll be going there to prove that, but don't talk
[2:34:16.560 --> 2:34:20.000]  about that yet. He said, I'll talk to you after I get back from Kenya in a month and
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:24.400]  a half right before the election. I saw him in Denver. You saw the interview we did. He's
[2:34:24.400 --> 2:34:29.560]  told us that off air. And so I can confirm he was there snooping around for that. And
[2:34:29.560 --> 2:34:34.680]  then they went out into the city and grabbed him, the federal police of Kenya, which is
[2:34:34.680 --> 2:34:39.680]  not, I mean, which is not normally been a police state, but has a new leader related
[2:34:39.680 --> 2:34:44.520]  to Obama that Obama supported his campaign, who is arresting dissidents. And that's in
[2:34:44.520 --> 2:34:50.520]  a separate area. He is definitely internationally aligned with thugs and folks. We don't discriminate
[2:34:50.520 --> 2:34:55.240]  here. That's why we can say a black guy can be just as evil as a white guy. And Barack
[2:34:55.240 --> 2:34:58.880]  Obama's got very evil people behind him. Continue, Webster Tarboy.
[2:34:58.880 --> 2:35:05.760]  Concerning this, Odinga, in my view, is a CIA agent. In other words, he's a U.S. puppet.
[2:35:05.760 --> 2:35:13.400]  But in order to consolidate power, you have the Luo ethnic group or the Luo tribe to which
[2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:20.120]  Obama and Odinga both belong. They have stipulated this alliance with a group of Islamic fundamentalists,
[2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:22.160]  I think also clients of the CIA.
[2:35:22.160 --> 2:35:27.760]  Again, there's that Muslim situation. It just keeps popping up. He goes to Muslim schools
[2:35:27.760 --> 2:35:31.280]  and I'm not even attacking Muslims here. The point is, is that where there's smoke,
[2:35:31.280 --> 2:35:32.280]  there's fire.
[2:35:32.280 --> 2:35:39.320]  It is obviously a U.S. strategy for the destabilization of the area. The largest ethnic group in
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:44.720]  Kenya is the Kikuyu ethnic group. And they've dominated the government at the most of the
[2:35:44.720 --> 2:35:50.280]  time. But now we've just had a kind of color revolution or CIA people power coup led by
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:55.480]  this guy, Odinga, with Obama going over there and campaigning for him to the point where
[2:35:55.480 --> 2:36:00.080]  the previous government said, Obama, you're acting as a stooge for the State Department
[2:36:00.080 --> 2:36:04.400]  and interfering in our internal affairs. So why don't you get out of here? So it's not
[2:36:04.400 --> 2:36:07.240]  white against black. In this case, it's too black after...
[2:36:07.240 --> 2:36:12.680]  That's just like the UN engineering the slaughter for oil fields in Rwanda with the Hutus against
[2:36:12.680 --> 2:36:13.680]  the Tutsi. Same story.
[2:36:13.680 --> 2:36:20.440]  Right. And in this case, look, Odinga has two children. He has a son named Raul named
[2:36:20.440 --> 2:36:26.440]  after Raul Castro. All right, fine. But then he's got a daughter named Winnie after Winnie
[2:36:26.440 --> 2:36:32.440]  Mandela. And you remember that Winnie Mandela was famous for murdering people. She murdered
[2:36:32.440 --> 2:36:37.760]  Steve or she was part of a group that murdered a very famous activist named Steve Beko, who
[2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:40.760]  she regarded as a competitor.
[2:36:40.760 --> 2:36:45.080]  And they put gasoline in the tire, they put gasoline in the tire, hanging around their
[2:36:45.080 --> 2:36:46.480]  head and then it melts over them.
[2:36:46.480 --> 2:36:55.160]  Yeah, this is the... No, Odinga supports necklacing. So Mr. Necklacing, Burn Baby Burn of Kenya,
[2:36:55.160 --> 2:37:01.080]  is now Obama's great friend and ally. I would urge people, this is a point really to mobilize.
[2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:06.000]  Now, Corsi is being held over there. Whatever you think of Corsi, you don't have to embrace
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  all of his politics.
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:11.480]  We should support investigative journalists, whether we love them or hate them, give us...
[2:37:11.480 --> 2:37:17.320]  Now either we should be calling the U.S. State Department and the media instead of the Kenyan
[2:37:17.320 --> 2:37:20.360]  little CIA field office, but let me, let's give out the Kenyan number.
[2:37:20.360 --> 2:37:29.440]  Great idea. The Kenyan Embassy is 202-387-6101. 202-387-6101. You're very right, Alex. It
[2:37:29.440 --> 2:37:34.240]  should be that the U.S. State Department is now supposed to step forward and say U.S.
[2:37:34.240 --> 2:37:39.120]  citizens have been seized illegally in this country of Kenya and we demand that they be
[2:37:39.120 --> 2:37:40.120]  freed.
[2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:43.760]  Let's stop right there or we should have tourist protests. That's one of the safer countries
[2:37:43.760 --> 2:37:46.400]  in Africa and their main product.
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:48.400]  Not anymore. Not this revolution.
[2:37:48.400 --> 2:37:51.600]  Well, I was about to say, but let's stop right there. Give that number up. People hold up
[2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:55.120]  a minute. I want to call them live on air. As long as we tell them they're live on air,
[2:37:55.120 --> 2:37:58.120]  that's fine. John, write this down. Write down the number. We're going to call them.
[2:37:58.120 --> 2:38:02.280]  Folks, hold off from calling so we can get through. John, get the Kenyan number right
[2:38:02.280 --> 2:38:03.280]  now from Webster Webster.
[2:38:03.280 --> 2:38:09.280]  I believe this is what I've written down off an email. I got 202-387-6101. I think that's
[2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:10.280]  accurate.
[2:38:10.280 --> 2:38:11.280]  I'll tell you again.
[2:38:11.280 --> 2:38:12.280]  I'll tell you again.
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:13.280]  202-387-6101.
[2:38:13.280 --> 2:38:21.880]  John, I want you to dial that live on air. People can hear it. We haven't done this in a while,
[2:38:21.880 --> 2:38:23.880]  but you can punch us up on air with the dialing, right?
[2:38:23.880 --> 2:38:27.280]  All right, let's settle. Well, as soon as you get it ringing, I'm ready.
[2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:28.280]  Great idea.
[2:38:28.280 --> 2:38:29.280]  Yeah, but keep going, Webster.
[2:38:29.280 --> 2:38:36.080]  Anyway, look at this guy. He's got one son named after Raul Castro. That's fine. That's
[2:38:36.080 --> 2:38:40.680]  your cup of tea, but Winnie Mandela, this is a slightly more problematic...
[2:38:40.680 --> 2:38:42.480]  This is a vicious terrorist.
[2:38:42.480 --> 2:38:45.880]  Yeah, and a killer. I mean, somebody, she was so...
[2:38:45.880 --> 2:38:47.880]  But Mandela even had to divorce her out of this.
[2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:52.880]  Yeah, had to dump her because of the stuff. The other thing I would add is Obama is not
[2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:58.080]  widely known, but in terms of getting that monstrous bailout package passed last Friday...
[2:38:58.080 --> 2:38:59.080]  He mulled Congress.
[2:38:59.080 --> 2:39:04.320]  He was doing conference calls in particular with the Congressional Black Caucus, which
[2:39:04.320 --> 2:39:09.120]  had voted overwhelmingly against it. Even though Obama said he was for it, they voted
[2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:14.520]  against it. He was on the phone arm-twisting and cajoling and doing God knows what.
[2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:18.120]  Yeah, the New York Times reported he was instrumental in getting the final votes.
[2:39:18.120 --> 2:39:22.880]  And if you look at the evolution of this crisis, Obama was always 1,000 percent in
[2:39:22.880 --> 2:39:27.000]  favor of the bailout. McCain went through this moment of vacillation when he saw that
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:28.920]  there were 125 or 150...
[2:39:28.920 --> 2:39:31.920]  And you're saying that may lose him the election. He could have done something popular.
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:37.460]  Yeah, McCain obviously made the stupidest mistake of his life. He could have voted...
[2:39:37.460 --> 2:39:42.160]  McCain could have said, I can't stand this bill because of all the earmarks and pork
[2:39:42.160 --> 2:39:46.200]  barrel stuff that's in it, because there's wooden arrows and all sorts of other silly
[2:39:46.200 --> 2:39:49.320]  things that have been put into it. He could have had a cover story.
[2:39:49.320 --> 2:39:53.320]  There's IRS secret police in it. There's carbon taxes in it.
[2:39:53.320 --> 2:39:59.600]  Right. So all sorts of good reasons for McCain to say no to it. But obviously, his, as you
[2:39:59.600 --> 2:40:04.200]  say, McCain is a very shaky proposition. I'm not arguing for McCain. What I'm arguing
[2:40:04.200 --> 2:40:07.800]  for is divided government. I do not want a one party state...
[2:40:07.800 --> 2:40:12.000]  Yeah, exactly. Separation of powers. And you get that with a McCain. John, how's it going
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:18.720]  with the call into the Kenyon Embassy? Oh, is it ringing? Well, let me hear it. Let's
[2:40:18.720 --> 2:40:21.040]  hear the ringing on air. And then I'll talk to them. I'll tell them it's Genesis we're
[2:40:21.040 --> 2:40:36.480]  live. Pipe it in, John. Here we go. Calling the Kenyon Embassy in DC. Here on air. I
[2:40:36.480 --> 2:40:52.760]  met their phones are busy. Maybe they won't take it off. Probably over the lane. Let me
[2:40:52.760 --> 2:40:57.520]  get them their instructions. Alex, maybe somebody there can also look
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:41:01.480]  them up. You know, go to their web page. I'm sure they have one. Yeah, John, you'll find
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:05.840]  an alternate number. You want to find an alternate number? I'll tell you what, get the...
[2:41:05.840 --> 2:41:13.760]  What's the name of the section for U.S. citizens abroad in political trouble? What's the name
[2:41:13.760 --> 2:41:17.880]  of that desk at the state? I would try the Africa desk of the State Department. Yeah,
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:27.800]  the Africa desk, but specifically... Africa desk, that'll be good enough. John, call
[2:41:27.800 --> 2:41:33.280]  information, get the Africa desk for the U.S. State Department. Let's call them. Thank you,
[2:41:33.280 --> 2:41:36.160]  John, for the Africa desk. This absolutely outrageous, and I would really urge everybody
[2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:40.800]  mobilize on this, because this is... If you can nail Obama on a couple of things like
[2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:45.280]  this, because it also leads right into the Phil Berg case. If he's a citizen, why won't
[2:41:45.280 --> 2:41:50.920]  he produce a birth certificate? We want to have the rule of law, right? Constitution
[2:41:50.920 --> 2:41:56.560]  is better than chaos and civil war, so let's respect the Constitution, and that means
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:42:02.000]  we want to see Obama's birth certificate. I would also point out, every state can do
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:06.280]  this. In other words, you can be in any state where Obama's on the ballot. You should go
[2:42:06.280 --> 2:42:14.640]  to Phil Berg's website, the Obamacrimes.com, get a copy of his submission. You can make
[2:42:14.640 --> 2:42:20.360]  the requisite changes in that. Give it to the Secretary of State of your state, or if you're
[2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:24.360]  a lawyer, get yourself going for a bono. And then contact the media that you've entered
[2:42:24.360 --> 2:42:31.400]  it in to get local press. Right, because there are 50 or more, 51 with the D.C. and District
[2:42:31.400 --> 2:42:37.240]  of Columbia. There are at least 51 places where Obama can and should be sued to produce
[2:42:37.240 --> 2:42:39.520]  his birth certificate, or be thrown off the ballot.
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:41.920]  That'll be with the Secretary of State's office at each state.
[2:42:41.920 --> 2:42:45.680]  Yeah, depending on most states. It's the Secretary of State, the guy who puts you on
[2:42:45.680 --> 2:42:51.320]  the ballot. And if you're a lawyer, or if you can get a lawyer, take the Phil Berg
[2:42:51.320 --> 2:42:55.120]  case as your starting point. Make some requisite changes in that.
[2:42:55.120 --> 2:42:59.400]  And you're right. They love the fact that Bush wasn't elected, so they can always undermine
[2:42:59.400 --> 2:43:04.360]  him that way and then put all the blame. He's horrible, but he's just a puppet. And then
[2:43:04.360 --> 2:43:11.120]  set the precedent for constitutional crises and get half the population, or the 20% of
[2:43:11.120 --> 2:43:15.320]  the population, roughly 25% that actually voted for him, to then support tyranny. Well,
[2:43:15.320 --> 2:43:19.920]  now if Obama's cheating the Constitution, we can now get 25, 30% of the population to
[2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:26.080]  support that tyranny. This is also a seduction of the public to go, and that's how dictators
[2:43:26.080 --> 2:43:31.240]  and corrupt systems like to entice the public. I mean, Webster, you're a historian, so you
[2:43:31.240 --> 2:43:36.080]  understand the way tyrants seduce the public in a process.
[2:43:36.080 --> 2:43:42.680]  Yes, in the 20th century, this typically was this question of the fascist mass movement.
[2:43:42.680 --> 2:43:46.400]  Remember though, with the Color Revolution cookbook, one of the things that most, most
[2:43:46.400 --> 2:43:53.840]  prominently you see now, one of the key ingredients of a people power coup by the CIA and the
[2:43:53.840 --> 2:43:58.720]  intelligence agencies, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, Rosa's Revolution in Georgia,
[2:43:58.720 --> 2:44:04.960]  the produce this, Timpat Mussolini, Saakashvili, is fake polling. And we are now in the land
[2:44:04.960 --> 2:44:08.800]  of fake polling. All the polls are doctored. You mentioned a couple of them. There's a
[2:44:08.800 --> 2:44:14.840]  big divergence. Right now we have a Roto-Zogby poll that says Obama's ahead by three. We
[2:44:14.840 --> 2:44:20.520]  have a hotline tracking poll that Obama's ahead by two. We have a CBS poll that Obama's
[2:44:20.520 --> 2:44:26.560]  ahead by 2.4. And then we have tracking polls from Gallup and Rasmussen that say something
[2:44:26.560 --> 2:44:31.000]  completely different, that Obama's ahead by seven, eight or nine. I think we just have
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:36.920]  to say all of these polls are inherently unreliable and may indeed be responding to the logic
[2:44:36.920 --> 2:44:41.840]  of the intelligence community. And the intelligence community, it should be obvious, supports
[2:44:41.840 --> 2:44:47.520]  Obama 1,000%. And the reason they want to do that is the question of the facelift for
[2:44:47.520 --> 2:44:54.600]  imperialism. Who can go into Europe and say, follow me in my assault on Russia? Obama can
[2:44:54.600 --> 2:44:59.240]  do this. McCain has no chance, whatever. Who can go into Africa and say, kick out the
[2:44:59.240 --> 2:45:04.040]  Chinese and join with us here in the United States? McCain can't do that. Obama has a
[2:45:04.040 --> 2:45:05.040]  wonderful...
[2:45:05.040 --> 2:45:07.440]  That's what the Republicans have, have beat their war drum. They've been discredited on
[2:45:07.440 --> 2:45:14.800]  lies on WMDs and Yellow Cake and Afghan heroin, opium. So now they need a fresh left cover,
[2:45:14.800 --> 2:45:19.760]  as you said. Yes. And the Hegelian element, most of the time people talk about Hegelian
[2:45:19.760 --> 2:45:23.000]  dialectic. I don't think it's really the heart of the matter, but in this case it may well
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:31.160]  be. Obama is controlled by his big new Brzezinski. And then McCain's controlled foreign policy
[2:45:31.160 --> 2:45:35.880]  by his son. Right. But in terms of Hegel, let's follow the Hegel track back. This big
[2:45:35.880 --> 2:45:41.720]  new Brzezinski was a student and indeed a co-worker of a guy called Karl Friedrich,
[2:45:41.720 --> 2:45:48.520]  who comes out of Germany, and actually is an element. His professors were elements of
[2:45:48.520 --> 2:45:55.040]  a neo-Hegelian school, one of them in particular, Alfred Weber. If you've heard of Max Weber,
[2:45:55.040 --> 2:46:03.920]  Max Weber, his brother, Alfred Weber, was a historian, a philosopher of history, with
[2:46:03.920 --> 2:46:10.040]  this strong Hegelian input. So you can see what Brzezinski is an expert in. Brzezinski
[2:46:10.040 --> 2:46:14.720]  basically belongs to a system where for decades and decades and decades you have right-wing
[2:46:14.720 --> 2:46:21.280]  reactionary rule. But then every now and then you need this abortive interlude of left-wing
[2:46:21.280 --> 2:46:25.360]  rule. To leap forward. To leap forward. The Carter administration. In other words, you've
[2:46:25.360 --> 2:46:28.800]  got to reverse your field from every now and then. In other words, you can't be Johnny
[2:46:28.800 --> 2:46:33.520]  One Note and always repeating the same stuff. You can't go into the world today and say,
[2:46:33.520 --> 2:46:38.440]  war on terror, bin Laden, al-Qaeda. This is absolutely discredited. It's a joke. It's
[2:46:38.440 --> 2:46:42.920]  a laughing stock. Everybody in Europe hates you. The Africans will turn against you. You're
[2:46:42.920 --> 2:46:47.280]  isolated and you're bankrupt. So the genius of Brzezinski is to say, now we...
[2:46:47.280 --> 2:46:49.560]  But bring them a smiling liberal face.
[2:46:49.560 --> 2:46:56.120]  Yeah, a left liberal face. Let's give them human rights, humanitarian concerns, and above
[2:46:56.120 --> 2:47:01.840]  all, dignity. And dignity means that you get a mini-state or a microstate that corresponds
[2:47:01.840 --> 2:47:06.320]  exactly to you. I mean, it would also imply the breakup of the United States before too
[2:47:06.320 --> 2:47:12.480]  long because the idea is that whatever your ethnic, religious, and other peculiarities
[2:47:12.480 --> 2:47:18.480]  may be, you should have an identity politics, mini-state or microstate that corresponds
[2:47:18.480 --> 2:47:24.360]  exactly to those. For example, the Luos. With the Luos, you can destabilize Kenya, Tanzania,
[2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:32.320]  the Congo, along with Uganda, and parts of other surrounding countries. You get up to
[2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:37.320]  about five countries. If you're going to have a Luos state on the Rodinga, that essentially
[2:47:37.320 --> 2:47:42.000]  carves you five of the African countries. And then you can begin kicking the Chinese
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:47.440]  out of all of those places and pursue your imperialist agenda. So it does go back to
[2:47:47.440 --> 2:47:53.560]  the Hegelianism of Alfred Weber and then this Carl Friedrich. Carl Friedrich and Brzezinski
[2:47:53.560 --> 2:47:58.040]  combined to write books about totalitarianism. This is one of the big things that they do.
[2:47:58.040 --> 2:48:04.480]  Brzezinski is also a student of the geopolitical school of playing regions off, which is a
[2:48:04.480 --> 2:48:07.440]  more modern expression of the British divide and conquer.
[2:48:07.440 --> 2:48:11.720]  Exactly. And the idea there is, maybe you don't get involved, and Brzezinski would
[2:48:11.720 --> 2:48:15.200]  say, we don't, we want to use others. In other words, we want to use...
[2:48:15.200 --> 2:48:16.200]  You use proxies.
[2:48:16.200 --> 2:48:21.360]  Yeah, proxies. Let's use them as kamikaze puppets. A bubble. Let's use Iran. Why attack
[2:48:21.360 --> 2:48:26.360]  Iran to destroy Iran? Why not get Iran to attack Russia and destroy both? And if you
[2:48:26.360 --> 2:48:30.880]  don't believe it, look at what they did with Georgia. If there was ever a hopeless military...
[2:48:30.880 --> 2:48:37.080]  By the way, I wanted you to comment on that. Now, NATO and the U.S. has blamed their puppet,
[2:48:37.080 --> 2:48:42.200]  their Shalice Veely, in Georgia, who they put in there saying, okay, he did lie to us.
[2:48:42.200 --> 2:48:47.840]  He did lie. He did sneak attack. But they're trying to wash their hands when clearly they
[2:48:47.840 --> 2:48:51.120]  were giving the orders and had the drills there two weeks before. And the Israelis
[2:48:51.120 --> 2:48:52.840]  bragged they had 1,000 advisors.
[2:48:52.840 --> 2:48:58.640]  I think it may be a little bit more complicated. I suspect that people in the Bush State Department
[2:48:58.640 --> 2:49:03.000]  might have told them, don't do it. You're going to get overwhelmed. But I think Brzezinski
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:06.600]  and Soros, through their own direct channels, back channels, if you like, we're telling
[2:49:06.600 --> 2:49:08.840]  them, go ahead and do it. Let's get the crisis going.
[2:49:08.840 --> 2:49:12.520]  And they're setting him up. They don't care if he loses, knowing he would, because they
[2:49:12.520 --> 2:49:16.960]  want to set the stage of the big bad Russia and try to get Europe to line up against Russia
[2:49:16.960 --> 2:49:18.840]  and let new weapons systems be rolled in.
[2:49:18.840 --> 2:49:25.080]  Exactly. And he's the Shah of Iran, if you like. He was their puppet. They put him in,
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:30.760]  but he's also expendable. And he's expendable as the leading edge of getting larger puppets,
[2:49:30.760 --> 2:49:36.280]  Ukraine, Poland, and then the three Baltics, right? Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Lithuania.
[2:49:36.280 --> 2:49:41.840]  But now Ukraine's pulling out. Poland doesn't want to go along. I mean, they know that Russia
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:46.240]  just wants to do business. They want to have a good economy. So can you comment on that?
[2:49:46.240 --> 2:49:50.600]  We now see Eastern Europe and some of these puppet states breaking away from the West
[2:49:50.600 --> 2:49:53.320]  and in parliament. We see things breaking down.
[2:49:53.320 --> 2:49:59.160]  I think it proves that Brzezinski's methods, ultimately desperate as they are, generally
[2:49:59.160 --> 2:50:00.160]  don't work.
[2:50:00.160 --> 2:50:03.640]  Because we have blowback with the overall NATO-US system made discredited.
[2:50:03.640 --> 2:50:08.640]  Yes. And Ukraine is a very specific case, right? You have Yushenko, who's here in the
[2:50:08.640 --> 2:50:14.520]  United States now or wasn't until yesterday. Yushenko is a straight US-British international
[2:50:14.520 --> 2:50:21.080]  monetary fund NATO agent. And he's the pro-Western side in Kiev. But interestingly enough, we
[2:50:21.080 --> 2:50:27.680]  have Yulia Kimoshenko, the former gas princess, right? The blonde lady with the braids.
[2:50:27.680 --> 2:50:28.680]  Princess Leah.
[2:50:28.680 --> 2:50:29.680]  Pardon me?
[2:50:29.680 --> 2:50:30.680]  Looks like Princess Leah.
[2:50:30.680 --> 2:50:37.280]  Yeah, they've been other snow-maidens. Nigurochka, they think they call her. So she is now the
[2:50:37.280 --> 2:50:42.920]  neutral or indeed pro-Russian side of Ukraine. So that government is falling. And therefore,
[2:50:42.920 --> 2:50:47.880]  the puppet regime that Soros and Brzezinski had put up in Ukraine is now in great trouble.
[2:50:47.880 --> 2:50:53.800]  So the point is that Putin is the new cardinal Richelieu. He's infinitely better in terms
[2:50:53.800 --> 2:50:57.640]  of geopolitics than any of these amateurs around Brzezinski.
[2:50:57.640 --> 2:51:01.840]  Webster, stay there. Let's look into the future on the economic front.
[2:51:01.840 --> 2:51:02.840]  Question.
[2:51:02.840 --> 2:51:06.520]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[2:51:06.520 --> 2:51:07.520]  Worse.
[2:51:07.520 --> 2:51:08.520]  Worse.
[2:51:08.520 --> 2:51:11.640]  The world economic collapse could come any day.
[2:51:11.640 --> 2:51:12.640]  Day.
[2:51:12.640 --> 2:51:13.640]  Question.
[2:51:13.640 --> 2:51:16.760]  Are you prepared? Or are you ignoring the signs?
[2:51:16.760 --> 2:51:17.760]  Question.

[2:52:01.280 --> 2:52:07.160]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:52:07.160 --> 2:52:08.640]  against this country.
[2:52:08.640 --> 2:52:12.840]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[2:52:12.840 --> 2:52:13.840]  bin Laden.
[2:52:13.840 --> 2:52:14.840]  This is his ammo.
[2:52:14.840 --> 2:52:15.840]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:52:15.840 --> 2:52:18.040]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:52:18.040 --> 2:52:22.640]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:52:22.640 --> 2:52:25.240]  networks inside the United States.
[2:52:25.240 --> 2:52:29.720]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:52:29.720 --> 2:52:31.880]  in and on the U.S.
[2:52:31.880 --> 2:52:35.560]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:35.560 --> 2:52:41.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:45.160]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[2:52:45.160 --> 2:52:46.160]  much more.

[2:53:07.880 --> 2:53:10.840]  The cam trails are spraying us with their chemicals.
[2:53:10.840 --> 2:53:13.320]  It's time to think about what is important.
[2:53:13.320 --> 2:53:16.200]  Most forget just how important life is.

[2:54:03.080 --> 2:54:12.440]  We're dialing the African desk at the State Department in Washington, D.C.
[2:54:12.440 --> 2:54:15.680]  John just talked to him, and they said, oh, no, Mr. Corsiz is not being held anywhere.
[2:54:15.680 --> 2:54:18.000]  He's very happy having a nice vacation.
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:19.000]  Ma'am?
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  Hello, ma'am?
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  Hello?
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:22.000]  Hello?
[2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  Hello?
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:28.120]  This is Alex Jones, who's there?
[2:54:28.120 --> 2:54:29.120]  They hung up.
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:30.120]  Call back right now on air.
[2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:31.120]  I just want to talk to him.
[2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:33.240]  Okay, we just called him there in the break.
[2:54:33.240 --> 2:54:34.240]  They said he's happy.
[2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:35.240]  He's not in jail.
[2:54:35.240 --> 2:54:36.240]  Nothing happened.
[2:54:36.240 --> 2:54:40.360]  AP is reporting that he is on house arrest.
[2:54:40.360 --> 2:54:43.320]  The Times of London is reporting it.
[2:54:43.320 --> 2:54:49.040]  I have the AP here, Carlos Maltuth, a senior immigration official and charge investigator.
[2:54:49.040 --> 2:54:52.120]  He said, Dr. Corsiz did not have a work permit, and we will still have it decided what to
[2:54:52.120 --> 2:54:53.120]  do with him.
[2:54:53.120 --> 2:54:54.120]  He told the Associated Press.
[2:54:54.120 --> 2:54:59.160]  So we're calling the Embassy, well, the State Department, to ask what the U.S. Embassy
[2:54:59.160 --> 2:55:02.760]  is doing about this over in Kenya.
[2:55:02.760 --> 2:55:06.440]  John, you got the phone ringing yet?
[2:55:06.440 --> 2:55:09.360]  I don't mind hearing the recording.
[2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:16.360]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[2:55:16.360 --> 2:55:43.360]  Probably have our number in there, call it ID.
[2:55:43.360 --> 2:55:55.360]  Now the State Department is not answering.
[2:55:55.360 --> 2:56:03.680]  John, you said they were answering right away before, right?
[2:56:03.680 --> 2:56:04.680]  It's just ridiculous.
[2:56:04.680 --> 2:56:08.040]  As soon as they heard me talking, I can tell what it was and hung up, or I can declare myself
[2:56:08.040 --> 2:56:09.040]  to them.
[2:56:09.040 --> 2:56:12.080]  Yeah, call back again.
[2:56:12.080 --> 2:56:17.120]  This is very interesting, isn't it, Webster Tirebly, to call them up and they say, we
[2:56:17.120 --> 2:56:18.520]  don't know what you're talking about.
[2:56:18.520 --> 2:56:19.520]  We know Dr. Corsiz.
[2:56:19.520 --> 2:56:21.200]  He's quite happy right now.
[2:56:21.200 --> 2:56:24.760]  Remember that power in Washington is no longer in the hands of Bush Cheney, whatever that
[2:56:24.760 --> 2:56:25.760]  was.
[2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:30.360]  It's now Condoleezza Rice, Bob Gates, a Brzynski man.
[2:56:30.360 --> 2:56:36.440]  Obama has signaled that Bob Gates will stay on at the Pentagon as a Brzynski insider.
[2:56:36.440 --> 2:56:40.600]  And by the way, he was at the Bilderberg meeting earlier this year in Chantilly.
[2:56:40.600 --> 2:56:41.600]  Gates was.
[2:56:41.600 --> 2:56:43.600]  He was Brzynski's office boy.
[2:56:43.600 --> 2:56:44.600]  It's ringing.
[2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:45.600]  It's ringing.
[2:56:45.600 --> 2:56:46.600]  It's ringing.
[2:56:46.600 --> 2:56:47.600]  Hold on.
[2:56:47.600 --> 2:56:48.600]  Yeah, Brzynski's office boy.
[2:56:48.600 --> 2:56:49.600]  Here we go.
[2:56:49.600 --> 2:56:50.600]  CIA director.
[2:56:50.600 --> 2:56:51.600]  This is ridiculous.
[2:56:51.600 --> 2:56:52.600]  Hello?
[2:56:52.600 --> 2:56:53.600]  John.
[2:56:53.600 --> 2:56:54.600]  Are you in there right now with me?
[2:56:54.600 --> 2:56:55.600]  John.

[2:57:55.020 --> 2:57:56.020]  plus billion
[2:57:56.020 --> 2:57:59.960]  and remember that they did that goldman fact is the main the single greatest
[2:57:59.960 --> 2:58:01.720]  contributor to obama
[2:58:01.720 --> 2:58:04.220]  and uh... goldman fact is beating
[2:58:04.220 --> 2:58:08.800]  uh... obama's beating of mccain i think five or six to one in the goldman fact

[2:58:29.360 --> 2:58:31.580]  separation of powers always gives you tyranny

[3:01:35.560 --> 3:01:38.840]  uh... down over a thousand points in last week
[3:01:38.840 --> 3:01:41.960]  well the first thing about the bailout of course is that it's futile and there
[3:01:41.960 --> 3:01:43.760]  are two things that have to be done
[3:01:43.760 --> 3:01:47.400]  this is a derivatives crisis you it's not beginning to filter through
[3:01:47.400 --> 3:01:51.880]  what is in crisis is not mortgages to poor people this is ridiculous
[3:01:51.880 --> 3:01:55.880]  it is derivatives one point five quadrillion of derivatives that includes
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:01:57.540]  mortgage-backed securities
[3:01:57.540 --> 3:01:59.580]  collateralized debt obligations
[3:01:59.580 --> 3:02:04.640]  credit default swaps structured investment vehicles structured notes of all sorts
[3:02:04.640 --> 3:02:06.080]  over-the-counter derivatives
[3:02:06.080 --> 3:02:09.800]  the only thing to be done with those derivatives is to wipe them out
[3:02:09.800 --> 3:02:12.440]  to expunge them to freeze the drawer them
[3:02:12.440 --> 3:02:15.960]  you can freeze them if you want to that's fine free them for the duration
[3:02:15.960 --> 3:02:17.880]  of the crisis they attend your
[3:02:17.880 --> 3:02:21.720]  freeze on all derivatives and indeed all financial you have to do that or it
[3:02:21.720 --> 3:02:25.280]  will continue to affect what's left of the real economy because it's a black
[3:02:25.280 --> 3:02:29.040]  hole it's a one point five quadrillion dollar black hole which is going to eat
[3:02:29.040 --> 3:02:29.840]  this
[3:02:29.840 --> 3:02:33.560]  the piddling some it's enough to be bankrupt the united states but not enough
[3:02:33.560 --> 3:02:34.920]  to save the derivatives
[3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:38.440]  so you've got to destroy these derivatives delete them shred them
[3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:41.000]  bonfire at the derivatives call it whatever you want
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:44.640]  they've got to be destroyed they've got to be put out of action because it's a
[3:02:44.640 --> 3:02:48.240]  Ponzi fraud that attached itself to the real economy criminally
[3:02:48.240 --> 3:02:51.480]  now the other thing is i've written a paper about the main street lending
[3:02:51.480 --> 3:02:55.920]  facility by my calculation the federal reserve now has one point five
[3:02:55.920 --> 3:02:57.040]  trillion
[3:02:57.040 --> 3:02:59.880]  of special cheap federal credit
[3:02:59.880 --> 3:03:02.200]  to parasites to banks
[3:03:02.200 --> 3:03:06.720]  investment banks insurance companies mutual funds money markets
[3:03:06.720 --> 3:03:09.760]  uh... brokerage houses and all sorts of other people
[3:03:09.760 --> 3:03:13.320]  the line that they used to try to defend was the federal reserve will only help
[3:03:13.320 --> 3:03:14.560]  its own member banks
[3:03:14.560 --> 3:03:17.360]  is gone so why not agitate now
[3:03:17.360 --> 3:03:21.240]  for a partial nationalization of the fed let's do it step-by-step
[3:03:21.240 --> 3:03:22.520]  and get things going
[3:03:22.520 --> 3:03:27.760]  let's open up a window force the fed to open a window one trillion dollars
[3:03:27.760 --> 3:03:31.480]  of cheap credit between one half percent and one percent
[3:03:31.480 --> 3:03:36.040]  for producers that is to say for the detroit and that would rebuild the real
[3:03:36.040 --> 3:03:37.000]  economy
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  yes you'd be creating actual jobs in the woods why is it that parasites get all
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:44.600]  the cheap credit for the credit of the criminals that engineer to get it all
[3:03:44.600 --> 3:03:48.080]  and producers don't get any in other words the rest of us and i'm talking
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:49.120]  dry cleaners
[3:03:49.120 --> 3:03:51.440]  restaurants auto repair shops
[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:55.120]  small and medium industry all the way up to detroit detroit is on the verge of
[3:03:55.120 --> 3:03:59.800]  collapse you know a lot of old factories uh... of the uh... clothing
[3:03:59.800 --> 3:04:04.000]  production farmers farmers need cheap credit we've got to have cheap credit
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  for for all kinds of farmers
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:09.040]  all kinds of agricultural health cheap credit i mean i'm not for all the
[3:04:09.040 --> 3:04:10.120]  socialism
[3:04:10.120 --> 3:04:12.960]  but if they're going to just hand trillions to private bankers that goes
[3:04:12.960 --> 3:04:13.720]  offshore
[3:04:13.720 --> 3:04:17.000]  well i'll just give it to farmers and again it's not socialism at all this is
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:20.680]  this is the american system of alexander hamilton abraham linker and
[3:04:20.680 --> 3:04:21.880]  franklin d roosevelt
[3:04:21.880 --> 3:04:24.360]  this is the essence of the american system
[3:04:24.360 --> 3:04:27.000]  of political economy it's only because of the
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:29.520]  of the newton freedman agitation and the
[3:04:29.520 --> 3:04:31.760]  funhaya vegetation of the past
[3:04:31.760 --> 3:04:34.600]  thirty or forty years that this this is even a question
[3:04:34.600 --> 3:04:38.080]  that's socialism this is what happened around the time folks can get your book

[3:08:53.800 --> 3:08:58.000]  yesterday last week as you know it dropped about 600 points that's over a
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:02.680]  thousand point drop in a week and that's after the bankers were given

[3:11:50.640 --> 3:11:54.720]  okay Richard C. Cook needs no introduction but I will introduce him
[3:11:54.720 --> 3:12:00.080]  with the fact that the stock market is down as he predicted years ago to 9,628
[3:12:00.080 --> 3:12:08.000]  and plunging as we speak down right at 300 points today alone and that's even
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:12.160]  with them cooking the Dow Jones industrial 30 they've been pulling out bad stocks in
[3:12:12.160 --> 3:12:16.720]  the last few months that are failing and plugging in winners the Nasdaq's even
[3:12:16.720 --> 3:12:27.240]  down further on its overall numbers and so is SNP so now the feds talking about
[3:12:27.240 --> 3:12:30.920]  a big rate cut that'll further implode the dollar gold is exploding in prices
[3:12:30.920 --> 3:12:36.880]  today Richard C. Cook break down what we're facing sir well I think what we
[3:12:36.880 --> 3:12:43.640]  need to understand is that this is not really a financial crisis that's what
[3:12:43.640 --> 3:12:50.920]  everybody portrays it as but that is not really the case what we have is a
[3:12:50.920 --> 3:12:57.360]  production crisis because it's the world economy the producing economy that is
[3:12:57.360 --> 3:13:05.160]  actually collapsing and the financial indicators because they no longer have
[3:13:05.160 --> 3:13:09.560]  all of these bubbles in this debt pyramid to kind of prop themselves up with
[3:13:09.560 --> 3:13:14.080]  the whole thing is collapsing back toward what the producing economy and
[3:13:14.080 --> 3:13:19.240]  it's very depressed level consistent so we we got the financial wizards took
[3:13:19.240 --> 3:13:23.640]  over over one-third of the real economy and then debased the industrial
[3:13:23.640 --> 3:13:28.040]  capacity and so now they created hundreds of times all the real assets and
[3:13:28.040 --> 3:13:33.080]  so the black hole is imploding that that is correct and the stock market it's not
[3:13:33.080 --> 3:13:38.520]  really a mystery and as you say some of us saw this coming a long time ago I
[3:13:38.520 --> 3:13:43.520]  started writing about this well over a year ago and I was estimating at that
[3:13:43.520 --> 3:13:47.320]  time that the stock market could come down in half and you know from its high
[3:13:47.320 --> 3:13:52.280]  of 14,000 because what it's doing is it's really going to its natural level
[3:13:52.280 --> 3:13:57.400]  the stock market has been artificially inflated by all the financial bubbles
[3:13:57.400 --> 3:14:02.680]  now that those financial bubbles have burst it's going back to its natural
[3:14:02.680 --> 3:14:08.280]  level which is the level that the producing and a consumer economy can
[3:14:08.280 --> 3:14:14.840]  sustain without excessive debt that's what is going on and the real indicator
[3:14:14.840 --> 3:14:19.360]  here that nobody pays any attention to because they don't want us to pay
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:24.920]  attention to it is consumer purchasing power it's what consumers are
[3:14:24.920 --> 3:14:32.520]  comfortably able to buy with what they earn now consumers over you know really
[3:14:32.520 --> 3:14:38.840]  going back 20 25 years have been buying way more than what they can afford
[3:14:38.840 --> 3:14:44.640]  because of the easy credit that's been available this is why the economy is
[3:14:44.640 --> 3:14:50.480]  70 trillion dollars in debt because consumers have only been able to keep
[3:14:50.480 --> 3:14:55.400]  up their standard of living by more and more borrowing now that they can't
[3:14:55.400 --> 3:14:59.600]  borrow anymore because people won't lend to them because it's so obvious they
[3:14:59.600 --> 3:15:05.680]  can't repay their loans consumer purchasing power in the United States is
[3:15:05.680 --> 3:15:11.000]  collapsing that is what is collapsing and we're seeing the effect on the stock
[3:15:11.000 --> 3:15:14.920]  market now where is all of the money going that's leaving the stock market
[3:15:14.920 --> 3:15:19.800]  that's a very interesting question which again they have not answered where
[3:15:19.800 --> 3:15:24.920]  that money is going is into Treasury debt because Treasury starting this week
[3:15:24.920 --> 3:15:30.760]  is floating tens of billions of dollars in additional bond issues in order to
[3:15:30.760 --> 3:15:35.240]  pay for all of these bailouts and of course Treasury bonds are earning such
[3:15:35.240 --> 3:15:41.440]  a low level of interest that it's really negative savings you lose money when
[3:15:41.440 --> 3:15:45.320]  you buy Treasury bonds these days but you have to because you lose even more in
[3:15:45.320 --> 3:15:50.360]  the stock market so we're seeing a shift into the Treasury bond market that is
[3:15:50.360 --> 3:15:55.160]  going to be used to generate more borrowed cash by the government this
[3:15:55.160 --> 3:16:00.960]  time in order to pay off all of these bailouts to the rich financiers who
[3:16:00.960 --> 3:16:12.960]  have just carried out the biggest heist in history continue continue well what
[3:16:12.960 --> 3:16:19.880]  we're seeing in all of the markets is is not the collapse of the
[3:16:19.880 --> 3:16:24.640]  capital markets because the capital that's available for all of these
[3:16:24.640 --> 3:16:28.680]  investments is only a very tiny proportion of what has actually gone
[3:16:28.680 --> 3:16:34.560]  into the bubbles the real source of the bubble financing has been bank
[3:16:34.560 --> 3:16:40.720]  leveraging from the banks of fractional reserve privileges and I've said on
[3:16:40.720 --> 3:16:45.440]  this show before that for example in the futures markets that ran the futures
[3:16:45.440 --> 3:16:52.080]  costs of commodities up so high 97% of the money that has been used to
[3:16:52.080 --> 3:16:56.400]  speculate in the futures markets comes as a bank loan it's on the
[3:16:56.400 --> 3:17:01.800]  purchases on margin and it's this kind of leveraging that we first heard about
[3:17:01.800 --> 3:17:10.000]  big time back in the 80s you know with the merger acquisition bubble has
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:15.000]  continued to fuel these bubbles ever since then and now it's those bubbles
[3:17:15.000 --> 3:17:20.600]  in that bank leveraging it's being withdrawn now where you may ask did
[3:17:20.600 --> 3:17:25.400]  the money come from for the banks to do all of that leverage financing well it
[3:17:25.400 --> 3:17:30.960]  came from several sources one was the regulatory agencies including the Federal
[3:17:30.960 --> 3:17:36.440]  Reserve and including the Securities and Exchange Commission gradually lowered
[3:17:36.440 --> 3:17:40.760]  the reserve requirements and allowed more and more lending to be done on
[3:17:40.760 --> 3:17:46.520]  margin and then in the stock markets and they are the the other markets they
[3:17:46.520 --> 3:17:49.800]  gradually allowed more and more leveraging of purchases in those markets
[3:17:49.800 --> 3:17:54.840]  like there was an article recently in the New York Times that documented a
[3:17:54.840 --> 3:18:00.880]  meeting of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2003 where the
[3:18:00.880 --> 3:18:06.200]  bankers the investment banks came into the SEC and this was just after Cox
[3:18:06.200 --> 3:18:10.400]  became the chairman you know Chris Cox the guy we saw before the banking
[3:18:10.400 --> 3:18:16.240]  committee a couple weeks ago the guy McCain said should be fired Cox allowed
[3:18:16.240 --> 3:18:21.560]  the SEC to deregulate and to permit investors to put more and more of their
[3:18:21.560 --> 3:18:27.960]  investments in bank leverage borrowing and they got so overextended that this
[3:18:27.960 --> 3:18:32.600]  is one of the things that's driven the whole bubble that is now bursting and
[3:18:32.600 --> 3:18:39.120]  it's part of the deregulation regime that began of course under Reagan and has
[3:18:39.120 --> 3:18:44.000]  accelerated and now has completely played itself out under Bush so what we
[3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:50.960]  are really seeing now is the result the the logical conclusion of everything
[3:18:50.960 --> 3:18:55.840]  that was done since the 1980s in the Reagan revolution to deregulate the
[3:18:55.840 --> 3:19:01.920]  markets and to allow vast amounts of bank lending to enter into these markets to
[3:19:01.920 --> 3:19:07.680]  fuel these bubbles it's all coming to an end right now and what the financiers
[3:19:07.680 --> 3:19:14.600]  led by Paulson of course and in Goldman Sachs is to move money into Treasury bonds
[3:19:14.600 --> 3:19:19.640]  so the Treasury can then use that money to buy the toxic debt which the
[3:19:19.640 --> 3:19:26.720]  financial institutions and the investors the brokers will use to pay
[3:19:26.720 --> 3:19:31.520]  themselves off one last time so we're seeing the end of the bailouts and the
[3:19:31.520 --> 3:19:36.120]  end of the payoffs to the financiers who engineered the disaster they're taking
[3:19:36.120 --> 3:19:39.240]  their profit by design I want to talk about this controlled implosion
[3:19:39.240 --> 3:19:43.800]  congressman being told last week physical martial law would be declared I
[3:19:43.800 --> 3:19:47.400]  mean and that hasn't gotten hardly any mainstream attention even in you know
[3:19:47.400 --> 3:19:51.480]  alternative talk radio it's not being covered we are all seeing it come to a
[3:19:51.480 --> 3:19:55.240]  head from Richard C. Cook looking forward what he thinks gonna happen in the

[3:23:14.000 --> 3:23:17.560]  enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing
[3:23:17.560 --> 3:23:21.440]  us into perpetual debt ensuring inflation and higher taxes these
[3:23:21.440 --> 3:23:24.880]  questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book the

[3:23:28.560 --> 3:23:32.880]  American needs to know about central bank power a gripping adventure into the
[3:23:32.880 --> 3:23:37.280]  secret world of international banking cartel hi this is Ted Anderson I will

[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:39.120]  White House analyst historian NASA analyst writer for major publications
[3:24:39.120 --> 3:24:44.600]  like the Washington Post Richard C. Cook Richard give out your website and tell
[3:24:44.600 --> 3:24:46.760]  us a little bit more about some of the articles and work you've been doing and
[3:24:46.760 --> 3:24:50.320]  then let's get into where they're going in the future I mean they've geared up
[3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:54.360]  for a police state they've prepared for this they changed the bankruptcy laws to
[3:24:54.360 --> 3:24:57.200]  go after the public and then they passed laws where they could take the pensions
[3:24:57.200 --> 3:25:01.840]  for themselves with companies I mean I see massive preparation in all of this
[3:25:01.840 --> 3:25:07.600]  then last week's unprecedented economic terrorism with every major leader saying
[3:25:07.600 --> 3:25:15.400]  you know sign over dictatorship powers financial dictatorial powers to the
[3:25:15.400 --> 3:25:21.080]  Treasury they said give us immunity or there'll be a depression then they get
[3:25:21.080 --> 3:25:24.920]  their power and they dump the markets break that down for us
[3:25:24.920 --> 3:25:29.600]  right that's exactly what what has happened now my website
[3:25:29.600 --> 3:25:39.640]  www.RichardsSeacook.com I also have a lot of articles now most of my articles
[3:25:39.640 --> 3:25:47.560]  are in global research it's www.globalresearch.ca and I have an email
[3:25:47.560 --> 3:25:55.200]  for comments I also have a report on the 08 election that's economic sanity at
[3:25:55.200 --> 3:26:01.960]  gmail.com economic sanity at gmail.com and people can write in and get on
[3:26:01.960 --> 3:26:06.920]  get on the mailing list but that's exactly what happened what you describe
[3:26:06.920 --> 3:26:12.960]  Alex and it's interesting that the dictatorial powers were assumed not on
[3:26:12.960 --> 3:26:19.680]  the part of the producing economy as has happened at other times in American
[3:26:19.680 --> 3:26:23.560]  history particularly in wartime but by the parrots rather by the banks by the
[3:26:23.560 --> 3:26:29.760]  by the financial economy by the what I call the Wall Street fat cats of which
[3:26:29.760 --> 3:26:34.280]  Paulson of course is the most prominent I mean Paulson already had been paid
[3:26:34.280 --> 3:26:39.040]  before he came to be the secretary of the Treasury hundreds of millions of
[3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:45.760]  dollars in earnings and bonuses for Goldman Sachs and he brought more people
[3:26:45.760 --> 3:26:51.200]  in from Goldman Sachs now to to manage this crisis and what they really have
[3:26:51.200 --> 3:27:01.000]  to manage is the largest payout of public funds for private sector failures
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:05.640]  in the history of the world they knew was a failure they they created the debt
[3:27:05.640 --> 3:27:09.880]  bubble by design and we're making money selling these derivatives to people all
[3:27:09.880 --> 3:27:15.480]  along that is absolutely correct and they closed all of the doors for the
[3:27:15.480 --> 3:27:20.140]  public to get out there are so many signs of premeditation when you read the
[3:27:20.140 --> 3:27:23.680]  IMF and World Bank plans where the International Bank of Settlements and
[3:27:23.680 --> 3:27:27.000]  others have engineered this in third world countries it's a replay of what
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:31.880]  was that in Argentina in 2000 2001 yes that's correct it was known that this
[3:27:31.880 --> 3:27:37.840]  could happen and it was done through Congress which is one of the most
[3:27:37.840 --> 3:27:41.680]  shameful episodes in our history particularly you know after that first
[3:27:41.680 --> 3:27:46.560]  vote in the House when enough congressman stood up and said no that they
[3:27:46.560 --> 3:27:51.160]  had to take it back thousand to one phone calls against it right and so
[3:27:51.160 --> 3:27:55.200]  instead of trying to put it back to the House they didn't end run around the
[3:27:55.200 --> 3:27:59.640]  House but they took it to the Senate where all the senators had already been
[3:27:59.640 --> 3:28:04.000]  bought off and of course we all know you know we've all seen the reports on
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:09.680]  campaign contributions and who pays the bills for for Barney Frank and Christod
[3:28:09.680 --> 3:28:15.320]  and all the rest you know who where their their campaign money comes from and
[3:28:15.320 --> 3:28:20.720]  the same goes with Obama and Hillary Clinton and McCain there are they all
[3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:25.760]  work for Wall Street that's where their financial support is and so they came in
[3:28:25.760 --> 3:28:32.760]  in the 11th hour and threatened everyone with a collapsing economy wrote a bill
[3:28:32.760 --> 3:28:38.960]  where the money from the public is going to be used for years into the future to
[3:28:38.960 --> 3:28:44.240]  pay them off so they can take that money and go spend it on fixed assets and we're
[3:28:44.240 --> 3:28:48.120]  going to see a lot of big houses being bought a lot of land being bought so
[3:28:48.120 --> 3:28:52.280]  instead of them getting in trouble for engineering this they get to be financial
[3:28:52.280 --> 3:28:56.360]  kingpins and suck the money out of us they get a payoff it's it's it's um
[3:28:56.360 --> 3:29:02.880]  it's what I call and I wrote this in an article recently Alex it's what I call
[3:29:02.880 --> 3:29:09.160]  hush money now the reason I call it hush money is that this whole thing was
[3:29:09.160 --> 3:29:15.600]  not just engineered by the banks I have written how back in the you know we all
[3:29:15.600 --> 3:29:20.880]  know now it came out of started coming during the Clinton administration all
[3:29:20.880 --> 3:29:25.280]  the subprime mortgages but the real fraud that began to enter in the system
[3:29:25.280 --> 3:29:31.320]  began to come in after 2001 during the Bush administration and what I have
[3:29:31.320 --> 3:29:38.160]  said in my articles is that when the economy collapsed when the dot com
[3:29:38.160 --> 3:29:42.800]  bubble burst in 2000 2001 they created this new derivative bubble stay there
[3:29:42.800 --> 3:29:46.320]  we're gonna come back Richard C. Cook final segment with our guests stay with
[3:29:46.320 --> 3:29:55.040]  us we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[3:30:23.680 --> 3:30:29.200]  that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US I'm

[3:33:46.120 --> 3:33:53.560]  journalist Richard C. Cook dot com Richard let's just get down to basics here
[3:33:53.560 --> 3:33:58.080]  in a little bit of time we have left with you today the public I don't think
[3:33:58.080 --> 3:34:02.840]  you have any inkling of where we're going I still think that some of them
[3:34:02.840 --> 3:34:07.800]  think it's hype even when CNN announces hey army brigades we read carefully it's
[3:34:07.800 --> 3:34:11.480]  multiple brigades they're gonna deal with the rioting people in the British
[3:34:11.480 --> 3:34:15.120]  say we're getting ready for riots over the economy and we got microwave guns
[3:34:15.120 --> 3:34:19.840]  ready in the US and I hadn't congressman on last week they were told
[3:34:19.840 --> 3:34:23.200]  martial law will be declared you'll be basically thrown out if you don't do
[3:34:23.200 --> 3:34:29.200]  this I mean that is terrorism that is threats and and and so where you see
[3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:33.040]  this going because the public thank God didn't get suckered 90 plus percent
[3:34:33.040 --> 3:34:36.640]  still said no after the financial terrorism Monday afternoon when the
[3:34:36.640 --> 3:34:42.120]  house voted it down a trillion 200 plus billion lost and then they acquiesced
[3:34:42.120 --> 3:34:45.880]  at least in Congress to the scaremongering and threats and then now
[3:34:45.880 --> 3:34:50.760]  the plunging has intensified with the market down at 9600 and something today
[3:34:50.760 --> 3:34:56.440]  down over 400 points or 300 plus points down over 400 yesterday I mean this is
[3:34:56.440 --> 3:35:00.760]  getting to me we're not talking about weeks or months of this continues that
[3:35:00.760 --> 3:35:08.040]  I mean the malls Austin is supposedly the you know wealthiest per capita city in
[3:35:08.040 --> 3:35:11.840]  the country the best off in the recession well this the the real estate
[3:35:11.840 --> 3:35:15.000]  markets plunging on my wife went last week to the mall to get the
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:18.280]  prescription for glasses done she said she's been there before and it's full
[3:35:18.280 --> 3:35:24.240]  it's empty everybody's talking about it and we're in a good city it is homeless
[3:35:24.240 --> 3:35:27.960]  people all over the country exploding tripling their numbers in the different
[3:35:27.960 --> 3:35:32.240]  indexes we have and this is only the beginning so a what is the public who's
[3:35:32.240 --> 3:35:36.720]  already mad gonna do when they find out this bailout went to offshore banking
[3:35:36.720 --> 3:35:40.720]  crime syndicates the elite are all literally leaving the country to do buy
[3:35:40.720 --> 3:35:44.880]  in Switzerland and then and then how do you see this unfolding the way they're
[3:35:44.880 --> 3:35:48.800]  going to govern it versus what you think we should do to a verdict well we're
[3:35:48.800 --> 3:35:55.240]  going into a long-term recession right now and probably a depression and it's
[3:35:55.240 --> 3:35:59.320]  not only in the United States it's worldwide yeah it's sucking down the
[3:35:59.320 --> 3:36:04.640]  euro this week everything yeah it's it's happening throughout Europe and when
[3:36:04.640 --> 3:36:10.200]  the Asian countries can no longer sell their products to the United States they
[3:36:10.200 --> 3:36:15.000]  can't buy the dad and it's their economies are going to freeze up to now here's
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:20.760]  the difference though where the Asian economies have an advantage which is
[3:36:20.760 --> 3:36:25.920]  that they produce things we don't produce things anymore we gave away our
[3:36:25.920 --> 3:36:31.800]  industry we gave away our family farming we gave them all to global
[3:36:31.800 --> 3:36:38.000]  capitalism we gave them to the people who put NAFTA through we gave them to the
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:42.520]  people who put through China as a most favorite trading nation we don't have it
[3:36:42.520 --> 3:36:46.920]  anymore so where are we going to get it where are we going to get the food when
[3:36:46.920 --> 3:36:51.160]  we can't buy the food on credit anymore where are we going to get the consumer
[3:36:51.160 --> 3:36:55.360]  products when we can't buy those on credit anymore the answer is nowhere
[3:36:55.360 --> 3:36:58.640]  well let me tell you about east Texas a year ago in east Texas where I have
[3:36:58.640 --> 3:37:02.560]  family they have the swan trucks that you know delivered you know decent stakes
[3:37:02.560 --> 3:37:08.680]  and chicken and pizzas and you know orange juice to people and the my uncle
[3:37:08.680 --> 3:37:12.880]  was talking to swan man you know they cut their route back to half I guess
[3:37:12.880 --> 3:37:15.640]  coming only twice a month I said I want a week or something I don't remember the
[3:37:15.640 --> 3:37:20.200]  exact but but the point is talking to everybody out in the country the
[3:37:20.200 --> 3:37:24.240]  majority of people said we can't even afford this inexpensive food anymore
[3:37:24.240 --> 3:37:29.360]  because we're spending it on gas just to get to work I mean it's already in
[3:37:29.360 --> 3:37:33.440]  Michigan and east Texas and Florida and the states are going bankrupt and the
[3:37:33.440 --> 3:37:36.480]  credit card debts coming bankrupt and now the bankers are saying they're going to
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:39.440]  bail out their cronies and select corporations I mean I'm sorry I'm just
[3:37:39.440 --> 3:37:43.200]  ranting it's just yeah no you're absolutely right and you know I I
[3:37:43.200 --> 3:37:51.560]  started writing several months ago that people say it can't happen here yet we
[3:37:51.560 --> 3:37:56.600]  already have or had at that time a year ago 35 million Americans who didn't have
[3:37:56.600 --> 3:38:00.600]  enough food to eat and then people were laughing about that because the
[3:38:00.600 --> 3:38:05.440]  government was calling them nutritionally challenged well that number has
[3:38:05.440 --> 3:38:11.280]  not gone away but if you look at the collapse of farming in this country in
[3:38:11.280 --> 3:38:16.520]  the inability that this nation has to even grow its own food anymore this
[3:38:16.520 --> 3:38:20.680]  could happen here we could have large-scale food shortages in this
[3:38:20.680 --> 3:38:24.520]  country that's the issue that's the issue your garden well I mean that's the
[3:38:24.520 --> 3:38:30.200]  next issue 90% agrarian in the Great Depression now 90% urban and of the 10
[3:38:30.200 --> 3:38:34.000]  percent half of those aren't even self-sufficient we have 5% that are
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:40.720]  self-sufficient but this is a this is Road Warrior Mad Max yeah that's right
[3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:44.360]  and what are people going to do are they going to let themselves be put out of
[3:38:44.360 --> 3:38:48.360]  their houses what are they going to do when they don't have enough food to eat
[3:38:48.360 --> 3:38:52.560]  or their family doesn't have I'm seeing reports from Tennessee and Texas where
[3:38:52.560 --> 3:38:56.440]  people are holed up in houses just this morning I saw one and the cops just
[3:38:56.440 --> 3:39:03.880]  gunned them down well yeah we saw that what happened to that to that woman I
[3:39:03.880 --> 3:39:08.240]  guess it was in Ohio that's now being reported on TV this is starting to
[3:39:08.240 --> 3:39:15.960]  happen and one of the features of this bailout plan is that the Paulson and
[3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:22.000]  his people were adamant that they were not going to allow housing prices to
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:26.960]  fall anymore that people were going to be held to their mortgages and Paulson
[3:39:26.960 --> 3:39:32.520]  said on TV when he was testifying before the Senate banking committee that
[3:39:32.520 --> 3:39:36.720]  foreclosures were going to continue this is not a plan let's be clear with their
[3:39:36.720 --> 3:39:39.360]  mortgage we're bailing them out it's going to be value the dollar and they
[3:39:39.360 --> 3:39:44.160]  said the Fed chairman said two weeks ago top dollar will be paid for these so
[3:39:44.160 --> 3:39:48.640]  they know the people will default the banks will be paid top dollar and then
[3:39:48.640 --> 3:39:54.160]  even get to repossess it that's right and then you had people saying Bernanke
[3:39:54.160 --> 3:39:59.160]  said this that when the money was paid back to the public from these mortgage
[3:39:59.160 --> 3:40:02.800]  backed securities they weren't going to lose money and they might even make
[3:40:02.800 --> 3:40:08.080]  money and the only way that that's possible is if the people who owe the
[3:40:08.080 --> 3:40:12.200]  money still have to pay it now countrywide has just announced a program
[3:40:12.200 --> 3:40:17.720]  to their credit countrywide of course is now owned by Bank of America that
[3:40:17.720 --> 3:40:22.280]  they're going to start allowing people to scale back on the principle and the
[3:40:22.280 --> 3:40:26.640]  interest that they own their houses so at least there's some little glimmer of
[3:40:26.640 --> 3:40:30.600]  common sense coming through by the people who were holding the mortgages but
[3:40:30.600 --> 3:40:34.960]  it sure is not part of the government plan what is in the government plan is
[3:40:34.960 --> 3:40:40.760]  a travesty and you just have to wonder when the banking lobbyists and when the
[3:40:40.760 --> 3:40:45.800]  Bush administration lobbyists were going around Congress last week in the
[3:40:45.800 --> 3:40:50.120]  House of Representatives twisting arms of those congressmen to get them to
[3:40:50.120 --> 3:40:56.080]  change their votes to pass this bill what were they threatening them with you
[3:40:56.080 --> 3:40:59.840]  know what were they pulling out of their well they told them martial law they
[3:40:59.840 --> 3:41:04.240]  told them martial law yeah so there there you have it it was done by threats it
[3:41:04.240 --> 3:41:09.120]  was done by coercion you know even then a hundred and some congressman still had
[3:41:09.120 --> 3:41:14.080]  the guts to say no but not enough to stop the juggernaut well that shows that
[3:41:14.080 --> 3:41:18.760]  the establishment is going for broke because when you start getting elites
[3:41:18.760 --> 3:41:24.040]  threatening martial law to Congress and then the congressman came on the show
[3:41:24.040 --> 3:41:26.880]  and said well under underhouse rules I can't tell you what was told me in
[3:41:26.880 --> 3:41:31.000]  confidence I mean that shows the establishment is going for broke yeah it
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:37.400]  did it did and now whether it was going for broke merely to get one last raid on
[3:41:37.400 --> 3:41:42.320]  the Treasury or whether it has something longer term and more sinister in
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:48.600]  mind I honestly don't know Bush is clearly bailing out Cheney is bailing
[3:41:48.600 --> 3:41:53.080]  out they moved Halliburton to Dubai so maybe he's going bye bye the bushes
[3:41:53.080 --> 3:41:58.520]  are going down to Paraguay I talked to a top investigative journalist a few
[3:41:58.520 --> 3:42:03.160]  weeks ago I mean I mean top international they say Kinley is alive in
[3:42:03.160 --> 3:42:08.280]  Paraguay well wouldn't be the least bit surprised so maybe this is just their
[3:42:08.280 --> 3:42:13.520]  their last attempt to to take the money and run or maybe they have something in
[3:42:13.520 --> 3:42:19.320]  mind that is much more sinister than that again I do not know I do not have
[3:42:19.320 --> 3:42:24.840]  the answer to that but clearly they've ramped up they've geared up to keep
[3:42:24.840 --> 3:42:30.120]  order in the streets by using the army just as they did during the Katrina
[3:42:30.120 --> 3:42:35.320]  disaster so it looks to me like a nationwide Katrina this is a financial
[3:42:35.320 --> 3:42:39.800]  and economic hurricane that's going to have the same effects as that and it's
[3:42:39.800 --> 3:42:47.440]  going to be just as disastrous if we get a new president in office in November
[3:42:47.440 --> 3:42:52.520]  who intends to do anything about it then the obvious answer and what all the
[3:42:52.520 --> 3:42:57.600]  Democrats are saying is that we're going to see the new deal back again now
[3:42:57.600 --> 3:43:03.520]  whether it's there's there's any time even to do that I don't know yeah but
[3:43:03.520 --> 3:43:08.240]  their new deal is homeland security law enforcement jobs more prisons I've been
[3:43:08.240 --> 3:43:12.720]  talking about that for years in Morocco Obama you know he's gotten three times
[3:43:12.720 --> 3:43:17.880]  the Wall Street money that McCain has how do you square that well I don't
[3:43:17.880 --> 3:43:23.720]  that's the big unknown you know that there would be no problem for the
[3:43:23.720 --> 3:43:27.600]  Democrats to print money there's just the way they're printing money to give to
[3:43:27.600 --> 3:43:31.960]  the bankers to print money and pay people to dig ditches and fill them up
[3:43:31.960 --> 3:43:35.960]  yeah they're gonna kill the dollar they might as well the next few years build a
[3:43:35.960 --> 3:43:40.600]  real economy so we got something left correct that's the only instead it's all
[3:43:40.600 --> 3:43:43.960]  going offshore and I don't mean to yell Richard this is no you're right how do
[3:43:43.960 --> 3:43:47.280]  you contain yourself because I know what this means to my beloved country
[3:43:47.280 --> 3:43:50.680]  you know people who talk about they love it I really do love it because this is
[3:43:50.680 --> 3:43:53.920]  this is the only country I got it's where my roots are and I'm watching it all
[3:43:53.920 --> 3:43:58.840]  die it all be stolen by these by these fraudsters that's right and that's the
[3:43:58.840 --> 3:44:03.840]  only the only hope is to take that same treasury money they're printing and
[3:44:03.840 --> 3:44:08.440]  giving it away to the financiers and begin to do something for the people
[3:44:08.440 --> 3:44:12.200]  exactly helicopter business and helicoptering money to the people he's
[3:44:12.200 --> 3:44:15.760]  helicoptering and overseas international banks that they need to be
[3:44:15.760 --> 3:44:21.560]  helicoptering it on us and and he's lying about it now now the the hope is
[3:44:21.560 --> 3:44:27.000]  and the title of my next book which I hope will be out within a few weeks is
[3:44:27.000 --> 3:44:33.120]  we hold these truths the hope of monetary reform the hope lies with the fact
[3:44:33.120 --> 3:44:38.920]  that there are enough people within this country in the monetary reform movement
[3:44:38.920 --> 3:44:46.160]  to be able to at least arrest the emerging and to put in place a monetary
[3:44:46.160 --> 3:44:51.480]  system and an economy that will put money back into the hands of people that
[3:44:51.480 --> 3:44:56.360]  they need to rebuild the economy from the bottom up and the key to this really
[3:44:56.360 --> 3:45:00.360]  Alex goes back to what I started talking about in the very first place is
[3:45:00.360 --> 3:45:06.120]  purchasing power people do not have purchasing power any longer because
[3:45:06.120 --> 3:45:11.800]  their jobs their farms their small businesses were all taken away from
[3:45:11.800 --> 3:45:16.160]  them by the financial looting well I'm gonna have you back on with financial
[3:45:16.160 --> 3:45:19.360]  industrialists I'm gonna have you back on we're about to end this for Richard
[3:45:19.360 --> 3:45:23.680]  because I'm gonna cover the financial news but I agree with you and I am
[3:45:23.680 --> 3:45:26.840]  against helicoptering money it's better for it to be at the grassroots and it
[3:45:26.840 --> 3:45:30.000]  devalues it but they're clearly have decided to kill the dollar in the next
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:33.760]  three years and bring out some new monetary unit they've openly said
[3:45:33.760 --> 3:45:37.240]  that's their plan so in the interim we might as well build up some real economy
[3:45:37.240 --> 3:45:40.440]  but we know that's not going to be basically what happens unless there's
[3:45:40.440 --> 3:45:44.280]  political will what about a national call for the fact that their criminals
[3:45:44.280 --> 3:45:49.560]  pointing out their insider trading their their conflict of interest all the I
[3:45:49.560 --> 3:45:54.320]  mean you know the Goldman Sachs VP to hand out the 700 billion I mean under
[3:45:54.320 --> 3:45:59.400]  the former head of Goldman Sachs I mean this this isn't even the pretense of
[3:45:59.400 --> 3:46:03.480]  legality and I think we need to have a state grand jury's as Ron Paul said two
[3:46:03.480 --> 3:46:09.520]  weeks ago here on the show call a call you know hand out entirely agree if you
[3:46:09.520 --> 3:46:16.160]  look at my last article on global research title grand larceny I begin to
[3:46:16.160 --> 3:46:21.600]  go through there the breakdown of how it was done at the political level by the
[3:46:21.600 --> 3:46:27.560]  bush administration with the collusion of Alan Greenspan the chairman of the
[3:46:27.560 --> 3:46:30.880]  federal reserve and he needs to be arrested a crime from the top one of
[3:46:30.880 --> 3:46:34.160]  the people who tried to stop this was ellie spitzer when he was attorney
[3:46:34.160 --> 3:46:37.680]  general of New York and so they found his crooked tone Ellen got him they got
[3:46:37.680 --> 3:46:42.320]  him yeah because he'd blown the whistle on the fact that the u.s. Department of
[3:46:42.320 --> 3:46:46.160]  Treasury and the comptroller of the currency the the department I used to
[3:46:46.160 --> 3:46:52.880]  work for had blocked investigations by all 50 states into the mortgage fraud that
[3:46:52.880 --> 3:46:57.440]  set all of this up that was done by the bush administration was going to
[3:46:57.440 --> 3:47:01.240]  invest in and he was saying he was going to investigate from the state level and
[3:47:01.240 --> 3:47:05.880]  they said our body that's right they blocked the investigation that was done
[3:47:05.880 --> 3:47:10.480]  this wasn't a bunch of mortgage brokers out there telling people come on sheet
[3:47:10.480 --> 3:47:14.320]  on your applications so I can make a few extra bucks that's how they're
[3:47:14.320 --> 3:47:19.360]  portraying it this was a top-down program put in place by the highest
[3:47:19.360 --> 3:47:24.080]  political and financial levels well absolutely they admit that and the
[3:47:24.080 --> 3:47:28.680]  I'm at World Bank documents well Richard C. Cook I want to get you back on next
[3:47:28.680 --> 3:47:33.280]  week if you can let's do an hour on monetary reform show down the road
[3:47:33.280 --> 3:47:38.960]  people after this fully crashes know what can really be done I mean if we had a
[3:47:38.960 --> 3:47:43.120]  free market left and an economy left I would say the libertarian model but when
[3:47:43.120 --> 3:47:47.040]  it's this shot and the economy is like a dying man on the beach who's been
[3:47:47.040 --> 3:47:52.160]  grounding you've got to you know defibrillate him to get his heart going
[3:47:52.160 --> 3:47:56.440]  yeah that's right I agree I'll be glad to get back all right Richard cook thank
[3:47:56.440 --> 3:48:00.880]  you take care okay thanks Alex you bet there he goes but the balance of the
[3:48:00.880 --> 3:48:04.480]  show I want to go over the stock market numbers what we're looking at from CNBC
[3:48:04.480 --> 3:48:08.440]  CNN it's also up on info wars.com and prisonpunna.com some key articles
[3:48:08.440 --> 3:48:12.960]  from Paul Watson there but I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up gold is trading
[3:48:12.960 --> 3:48:19.720]  at 880 plus and shooting straight up even mainline CNN ABC News are all
[3:48:19.720 --> 3:48:24.200]  reporting that there has been a manipulation in the gold paper to keep
[3:48:24.200 --> 3:48:28.520]  it down that's now not Ted Anderson it's CNN it's MSNBC it's all over the news
[3:48:28.520 --> 3:48:33.320]  it's up on prisonpunna.com and they've artificially suppressed the
[3:48:33.320 --> 3:48:38.920]  paper cost but that we're going to see this paradox of manipulation where
[3:48:38.920 --> 3:48:44.680]  gold's $2,000 an ounce but gold paper is 900 and so what everything Ted's been
[3:48:44.680 --> 3:48:49.440]  saying and Ron Paul's been saying is now being said by mainstream news they can
[3:48:49.440 --> 3:48:53.840]  no longer hide it this is an amazing admission Ted that we're now seeing I
[3:48:53.840 --> 3:48:57.240]  believe they're putting this out because they don't want to be caught you know
[3:48:57.240 --> 3:49:00.760]  behind the curve they want to look like they told the people this is big Ted yeah
[3:49:00.760 --> 3:49:04.120]  they've been manipulating the gold prices through the futures market all
[3:49:04.120 --> 3:49:07.800]  along here trying to keep that down because if they can keep that down it
[3:49:07.800 --> 3:49:11.320]  gives the illusion that the United States dollar is going to be strong and
[3:49:11.320 --> 3:49:16.840]  okay well you know wake up everybody I mean we our whole economic systems
[3:49:16.840 --> 3:49:19.960]  melting down I mean if you're you're talking about who we gonna drop the
[3:49:19.960 --> 3:49:23.880]  helicopters who we gonna dump the helicopter loads of money on to is it
[3:49:23.880 --> 3:49:28.040]  gonna be the the the financial leaders are gonna be the US citizens my god
[3:49:28.040 --> 3:49:32.040]  once you start giving away something for free it has no value and that's
[3:49:32.040 --> 3:49:35.160]  exactly what's going on with the US dollar and yeah you're right they are
[3:49:35.160 --> 3:49:38.880]  trying to manipulate but right now the dollars down the Dow Jones is down the
[3:49:38.880 --> 3:49:42.760]  Russell's down just about everything on the New York Stock Exchange is down but
[3:49:42.760 --> 3:49:49.400]  gold is up $28.80 going straight up at $884.10 and ladies and gentlemen
[3:49:49.400 --> 3:49:57.440]  Ted still has gold at last week's price a whopping 50 bucks cheaper than it now
[3:49:57.440 --> 3:50:02.680]  is and he could for a limited time is offering you last week's prices now but
[3:50:02.680 --> 3:50:08.000]  it is gonna be gone by tomorrow if this continues Ted tell them the coins yeah
[3:50:08.000 --> 3:50:11.520]  sure I'll be happy to tell them the coins the same deal exact same deal that I
[3:50:11.520 --> 3:50:15.080]  offered yesterday but yet gold's up another 30 some bucks today and the
[3:50:15.080 --> 3:50:19.680]  deal yesterday was 25 30 bucks over what it was exactly this was locked in
[3:50:19.680 --> 3:50:24.480]  closer to 700 or $800 an ounce and is 900 and right now gold is
[3:50:24.480 --> 3:50:29.640]  casino high of 890 so yeah I'm sorry so it's 80 something bucks oh yeah it's
[3:50:29.640 --> 3:50:32.560]  huge this is as good as that deal you offered two weeks ago that was the best
[3:50:32.560 --> 3:50:39.480]  deal ever it is it is okay okay folks do the math Ted bought gold at $800 an
[3:50:39.480 --> 3:50:44.560]  ounce it's 884 you cannot beat this deal anywhere you will not find a better
[3:50:44.560 --> 3:50:48.480]  deal anywhere they'll tell you the coins when we get back but here's the number
[3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:55.480]  800 686 2237 800 686 2237 and we'll find out from Ted on the other side how
[3:50:55.480 --> 3:51:02.920]  long he can hold this deal open are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer

[3:54:20.560 --> 3:54:24.960]  I told you after they got the new power they would look drive all the stocks down
[3:54:24.960 --> 3:54:27.400]  they promised if you give them the power
[3:54:27.400 --> 3:54:30.760]  that they would then save it but instead now they want to drop everything so they
[3:54:30.760 --> 3:54:32.160]  can buy it up
[3:54:32.160 --> 3:54:35.000]  and then they're going to be value the dollar it's already plunging today but
[3:54:35.000 --> 3:54:36.880]  it'll come right
[3:54:36.880 --> 3:54:40.480]  ted i can't i knew all this would happen they said they were going to do it
[3:54:40.480 --> 3:54:42.360]  but to witness it
[3:54:42.360 --> 3:54:43.480]  and it just here up
[3:54:43.480 --> 3:54:46.520]  white former white house analyst and then in an analyst for the securities
[3:54:46.520 --> 3:54:47.520]  exchange commission
[3:54:47.520 --> 3:54:50.720]  say everything we're saying they are really doing this but i guess people
[3:54:50.720 --> 3:54:52.800]  shouldn't listen to us they shouldn't get gold
[3:54:52.800 --> 3:54:57.240]  uh... that that you secured eighty plus dollars under what it's selling for now
[3:54:57.240 --> 3:55:00.160]  they shouldn't move out of paper into that dead they should just stay in the
[3:55:00.160 --> 3:55:02.640]  stock market you know i have family
[3:55:02.640 --> 3:55:05.680]  who've saved their whole lives in the little bitty houses
[3:55:05.680 --> 3:55:08.400]  and you might have a million bucks in the stock market they admit they lost
[3:55:08.400 --> 3:55:09.840]  three hundred thousand dollars of it
[3:55:09.840 --> 3:55:13.360]  but they just say i got a stay in because it'll go back up later
[3:55:13.360 --> 3:55:15.440]  they don't understand do they tend
[3:55:15.440 --> 3:55:19.040]  they really don't alex i mean uh... the stock market has a lot to do with what's
[3:55:19.040 --> 3:55:21.280]  going on in the leverage markets i mean the
[3:55:21.280 --> 3:55:24.240]  uh... it right now the the uh... the
[3:55:24.240 --> 3:55:28.320]  crises in the housing market and the crises in the the credit market with
[3:55:28.320 --> 3:55:30.640]  all the banks they can't trade amongst each other
[3:55:30.640 --> 3:55:33.320]  the uh... commercial paper market is in trouble
[3:55:33.320 --> 3:55:36.480]  i mean just everything that has to do with papers in trouble
[3:55:36.480 --> 3:55:40.680]  what do you think can happen to these companies i mean big big name companies
[3:55:40.680 --> 3:55:43.160]  right now are getting bailed out so they don't fail
[3:55:43.160 --> 3:55:47.080]  and and these companies when they fail if they do and they probably will
[3:55:47.080 --> 3:55:48.600]  anyways because we can't
[3:55:48.600 --> 3:55:52.280]  print our way into prosperity it's just going to be adding
[3:55:52.280 --> 3:55:55.840]  water to the milk it's gonna be like drinking milk watered down milk
[3:55:55.840 --> 3:55:57.320]  there's just not enough
[3:55:57.320 --> 3:56:01.880]  that either wealth comes from the ingenuity the industry the industriousness
[3:56:01.880 --> 3:56:05.960]  and the uh... and and just uh... the and the bankers have sucked that dry and
[3:56:05.960 --> 3:56:08.560]  they got the third brigade to make sure we submit
[3:56:08.560 --> 3:56:10.720]  and brainwash police hope they wake up
[3:56:10.720 --> 3:56:13.720]  ted tell about the coins you've got in supply
[3:56:13.720 --> 3:56:17.000]  that you secured it eighty bucks under what it is right now that it
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:20.680]  what the last year was about eighty is this is this the all-time best deal or
[3:56:20.680 --> 3:56:24.040]  all right well it's a little bit it's a probably a twin of what we did what was
[3:56:24.040 --> 3:56:28.640]  a two weeks ago when the market took up like a rocket like it did today here
[3:56:28.640 --> 3:56:31.720]  right now i do have the frank sir one ninety and anybody that less than
[3:56:31.720 --> 3:56:35.320]  yesterday knows that that's the same prices yesterday and gold is up a lot
[3:56:35.320 --> 3:56:39.240]  more to say prices friday yep same prices friday because yesterday's price
[3:56:39.240 --> 3:56:42.440]  was the same as friday british sovereigns i still have those at two thirty four
[3:56:42.440 --> 3:56:44.840]  that's a quarter ounce coin you can do the math
[3:56:44.840 --> 3:56:48.520]  uh... it is next to melt and and uh...
[3:56:48.520 --> 3:56:52.280]  and and and that's because the prices have gone up so much and folks can't
[3:56:52.280 --> 3:56:55.760]  even find melt out there and that's a semi-collectible call yeah you can't buy
[3:56:55.760 --> 3:56:59.240]  coins that melt anymore that the physical market is dried up there's not
[3:56:59.240 --> 3:57:02.280]  enough available just like you said the physical market those spread between
[3:57:02.280 --> 3:57:06.520]  physical market coins and the spot price of gold and silver both
[3:57:06.520 --> 3:57:10.400]  has widened and it's going to continue to widen because people are buying the
[3:57:10.400 --> 3:57:13.760]  stuff putting it away and taking it out of the market that ten dollar indian
[3:57:13.760 --> 3:57:17.960]  though that you that you we talked about yesterday there at six seventy three
[3:57:17.960 --> 3:57:22.320]  and uh... you know that's to try to get supply and ten dollar indians it's
[3:57:22.320 --> 3:57:25.440]  almost like the market for about the still have the silver half dollars
[3:57:25.440 --> 3:57:28.480]  yes we do we have eight hundred six eight six
[3:57:28.480 --> 3:57:30.400]  two two three seven prison planet

[3:57:33.960 --> 3:57:37.560]  outstripping supplies global interest rate cuts lead a flight from paper
[3:57:37.560 --> 3:57:38.920]  currencies

[3:57:43.640 --> 3:57:44.240]  morning
[3:57:44.240 --> 3:57:47.280]  the flight from paper currencies a result of global interest rate cuts
[3:57:47.280 --> 3:57:50.200]  will lead to doubling the price of gold within a short period
[3:57:50.200 --> 3:57:53.360]  and we don't know that's gonna happen that's being predicted on mainstream news
[3:57:53.360 --> 3:57:56.200]  as demand for physical precious metals outstripped supplies
[3:57:56.200 --> 3:57:58.840]  causing paper contracts on gold to default
[3:57:58.840 --> 3:58:01.960]  the physical market may have been on fire it's getting very
