[00:00.000 --> 00:09.440]  I have privately and publicly gotten messages to President Trump that he has to fire the
[00:09.440 --> 00:15.720]  bat signal and point out that they have been incrementally at an ambient level turning
[00:15.720 --> 00:20.480]  up the heat for civil war and martial law and that in that atmosphere the president
[00:20.480 --> 00:24.880]  will be couped before the election because they know that there's about to be a Trump
[00:24.880 --> 00:38.360]  landslide. Well, President Trump and General Flynn both fired the bat signal yesterday.
[00:38.360 --> 00:41.080]  Here's the president.
[00:41.080 --> 00:45.120]  So I have a lot of enemies out there. This may be the last time you'll see me for a while.
[00:45.120 --> 00:50.720]  A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I'm doing. But I figure
[00:50.720 --> 00:55.440]  we have one chance to do it and no other president's going to do what I do. No other president
[00:55.440 --> 01:03.880]  would do a favorite nations, a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost. Nobody.
[01:03.880 --> 01:09.200]  And there are a lot of unhappy people and they're very rich people and they're very
[01:09.200 --> 01:11.560]  unhappy.
[01:11.560 --> 01:21.920]  They parlayed American power into the entire global system. We're going to play that full
[01:21.920 --> 01:32.400]  clip coming up next segment in context, but you saw the context right there.
[01:32.400 --> 01:40.080]  The headline on info wars.com for the live show feed today is Trump fires the bat signal,
[01:40.080 --> 01:47.720]  turns the American people that an active coup is taking place to remove him. And that's
[01:47.720 --> 01:54.400]  what all the preparations and all the race war and all the COVID-19 hoaxes about is putting
[01:54.400 --> 02:02.600]  you into that mental space, that mental space where you just accept that things aren't normal.
[02:02.600 --> 02:08.040]  So you will accept a president being removed while he's still in office. And that's publicly
[02:08.040 --> 02:12.560]  what the globalists of the council on foreign relations and the Washington Post and CNN have
[02:12.560 --> 02:13.720]  been pushing.
[02:13.720 --> 02:19.400]  These are horrible people that have been caught not just spying on President Trump, but also
[02:19.400 --> 02:26.560]  spying on John Roberts and blackmailing him. It's been going on for a long time. And the
[02:26.560 --> 02:33.040]  chickens are coming home to roost so they're desperate. Let's play that clip of Trump firing
[02:33.040 --> 02:34.040]  the bat signal.
[02:34.040 --> 02:39.320]  We put the image up at the end of the bat signal and it's Trump. But we have to think
[02:39.320 --> 02:43.600]  of a symbol that Trump's firing up there. He's actually firing that symbol up there
[02:43.600 --> 02:48.920]  and asking for the American flag, which symbolizes the American people in our history and our
[02:48.920 --> 02:54.760]  future together. Trump's asking for our help. He's saying this might be the last time you
[02:54.760 --> 03:04.480]  see me for a while. What does that mean? That's we'll see him again in heaven. We'll see him
[03:04.480 --> 03:08.480]  again after they let him out of prison.
[03:08.480 --> 03:11.920]  You'll see on the other side of the veil, I have to put a bullet in his head. This is
[03:11.920 --> 03:17.760]  the real world. We're not in normal times, ladies and gentlemen. We're locked down under
[03:17.760 --> 03:23.160]  a giant hoax that the UN commands and local grocery stores tell women, you wear your master's
[03:23.160 --> 03:32.560]  hat, you get out. The UN says they didn't send blue helmets. They sent Tony Fauci and
[03:32.560 --> 03:39.200]  Bill Gates. Here's what the president had to say one more time.
[03:39.200 --> 03:43.160]  So I have a lot of enemies out there. This may be the last time you'll see me for a while.
[03:43.160 --> 03:48.840]  A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I'm doing. But I figure
[03:48.840 --> 03:53.560]  we have one chance to do it and no other president's going to do what I do. No other president
[03:53.560 --> 04:02.000]  would do a favorite nations, a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost. Nobody.
[04:02.000 --> 04:10.680]  And there are a lot of unhappy people and they're very rich people and they're very unhappy.
[04:10.680 --> 04:18.800]  So we're going to have more of this key speech and press conference he gave yesterday. Come
[04:18.800 --> 04:23.120]  on up on the other side, but I think you might want to raise the alarm like Paul Revere
[04:23.120 --> 04:29.440]  and take the live feed from him full wars.com or band on video or news wars.com news wars.com
[04:29.440 --> 04:35.800]  forward slash show. And explain that there's an active coup against the president we elected
[04:35.800 --> 04:40.760]  because he's reversing the sellout of you and your family. Because if you like the lockdown
[04:40.760 --> 04:44.480]  we're under understand it was always planned with a Trump guy or not, they intend to intensify
[04:44.480 --> 04:49.840]  it. And CNN says it's never going to end. And they're going to shut down every mom and
[04:49.840 --> 04:54.400]  pop business and every farm in this country and send communists into your town to run
[04:54.400 --> 04:59.200]  your life.

[06:17.080 --> 06:24.560]  You are receiving this transmission. You are the resistance live from the info wars.com
[06:24.560 --> 06:31.680]  studios. It's Alex Jones. If you're receiving this transmission, my friends, you are the
[06:31.680 --> 06:40.440]  resistance. Thank you for joining us on this live August 7 2020 transmission with 87 days
[06:40.440 --> 06:46.920]  out from this election that the Democrats don't intend to have. Biden is a placeholder
[06:46.920 --> 06:53.560]  they don't intend to have the debates. They don't intend to have any of it. They intend
[06:53.560 --> 06:59.040]  to remove Trump beforehand. Now they said they were going to not let the delegates
[06:59.040 --> 07:08.600]  see him on January 20 2017 and Nancy Pelosi's daughter was running an operation and they
[07:08.600 --> 07:14.480]  were unable to get that done. So they may fail. They probably will fail. And of course
[07:14.480 --> 07:18.160]  they tried to take the delegates away from him when he was one of the Republican nomination
[07:18.160 --> 07:25.640]  months before that. And of course after that Obama came out and said he'll be gone in 90
[07:25.640 --> 07:33.280]  days. That was to keep their stay behind networks, their forces embedded in government competent
[07:33.280 --> 07:47.000]  and confident that they could stay in place, burrow in leak false information and remove
[07:47.000 --> 07:56.880]  the elected president of the United States and scuttle and steal the 2016 election. They
[07:56.880 --> 08:03.720]  wanted to abort it even after it had happened. Even after it was out of its mother's womb
[08:03.720 --> 08:11.840]  conceived with the minds of the American people and executed on election day 2016. And now
[08:11.840 --> 08:16.880]  we know they had multiple coup attempts and now we know they canvassed the Pentagon for
[08:16.880 --> 08:23.760]  officers that would lead a coup of the president. And now we've had Atlantic monthly foreign
[08:23.760 --> 08:28.920]  affairs, public affairs, Financial Times of London, LA Times, New York Times, Washington
[08:28.920 --> 08:35.440]  Post, Wall Street Journal, every single establishment publication talk about removing him via the
[08:35.440 --> 08:41.000]  25th amendment. Or CNNs had Clapper and Brennan on to talk about removing him outside of the
[08:41.000 --> 08:48.920]  25th amendment. And Blitzer says, what do you mean? Outside of impeachment? And they
[08:48.920 --> 09:00.760]  said, yeah, just wait a few months. That was in late 2017, but they didn't have the guts
[09:00.760 --> 09:08.000]  to bite the bullet and do it. But now they've got the COVID lock down to put people into
[09:08.000 --> 09:13.720]  a state of other worldliness. They've got the race riots funded by Soros and the deep
[09:13.720 --> 09:18.800]  state and the Democrats and Obama and Hillary. And they've got Biden as a placeholder there
[09:18.800 --> 09:25.120]  and they're openly talking about bringing Obama back as a VP for Hillary. You're going
[09:25.120 --> 09:32.640]  to see spectacular things in the next 87 days. But now the president comes out in a speech
[09:32.640 --> 09:43.440]  yesterday and he says, I have powerful enemies. They're mad that I've not done one-sided trade
[09:43.440 --> 09:47.960]  deals. They're mad that I'm breaking up the system, the corrupt world government that
[09:47.960 --> 09:54.200]  was built off American ingenuity and money and power. In 1955, the United States had
[09:54.200 --> 10:00.040]  57% of world wealth, the largest middle class in the world, and it was all sold off not
[10:00.040 --> 10:06.320]  to empower the third world, but to totally take it over at the same time making us weak.
[10:06.320 --> 10:14.280]  And so President Trump came out and said that he needs us to understand that he's taken
[10:14.280 --> 10:20.640]  on powerful enemies. We've got this one shot to take America back and that it's his job
[10:20.640 --> 10:26.200]  and his destiny to do it and he's not backing down, but he's letting the world know I could
[10:26.200 --> 10:32.160]  be killed at any time and I won't be seeing you for a while. I won't be seeing you until
[10:32.160 --> 10:38.080]  the other side and have it. You see his wife out on TV saying all things are possible through
[10:38.080 --> 10:42.440]  Christ. We must put our faith in Jesus. We're fighting not against flesh and blood, but
[10:42.440 --> 10:47.760]  against the powers of darkness. And General Flynn came out. I'm going to read this at
[10:47.760 --> 10:52.040]  the bottom of the hour, the articles on info wars.com. I'm going to ask our great crew,
[10:52.040 --> 10:58.200]  Kit Daniels, to add a link to this article we posted last night to the live show feed
[10:58.200 --> 11:02.440]  so that people can go read it. General Flynn issues emergency warning. Communists are attempting
[11:02.440 --> 11:11.080]  to overthrow the United States under the command of Satan. And that's what it is. But you notice
[11:11.080 --> 11:20.680]  Mariah Carey's sister and other siblings have come out and said, we were part of Satanic
[11:20.680 --> 11:28.760]  rituals and now they're even taking the police to where it happened and it's very, very credible.
[11:28.760 --> 11:33.000]  As I told you, ladies and gentlemen, when they tried to get me to the higher levels
[11:33.000 --> 11:44.800]  of Hollywood, a point blank told me we do pledge ourselves to the devil. Mark Dice had
[11:44.800 --> 11:50.960]  it happen to him before he was going to be given a national reality TV show with, I'll
[11:50.960 --> 11:59.360]  just say it, a member of Motley crew. And he said, are you joking to the head of the
[11:59.360 --> 12:06.040]  company? He said, no, I'm not joking. You follow the devil. Now, do you want the million
[12:06.040 --> 12:19.920]  bucks? Tell me you love Lucifer. So here's the president yesterday in Ohio talking about
[12:19.920 --> 12:24.200]  bringing back business to the United States at the Whirlpool factory. And he fires the
[12:24.200 --> 12:28.640]  batch signal. He's letting you know he's done everything you can. He's done an incredible
[12:28.640 --> 12:32.960]  job because no one follows his orders, basically, under him other than the military and the
[12:32.960 --> 12:38.840]  police to a certain extent. And they're under attack. And this country is in desperate,
[12:38.840 --> 12:43.760]  desperate, desperate straits, ladies and gentlemen, pray for President Trump and pray
[12:43.760 --> 12:48.720]  that our enemies be exposed. But the good news is their blackmail, their house of cards
[12:48.720 --> 12:52.960]  is coming down. Major Hollywood producers have gone public. We'll tell you about this
[12:52.960 --> 12:58.160]  coming up, exposing the pedophile rings just yesterday. The producer of a child's voice
[12:58.160 --> 13:06.480]  has gone public. After Amazon since censored, they're already best selling film. It's all
[13:06.480 --> 13:12.480]  coming up. But here's the president yesterday in context, talking about how he's taken
[13:12.480 --> 13:16.320]  on the most rich and powerful people in the world. America has one chance to get back
[13:16.320 --> 13:17.720]  in trouble with destiny. Here it is.
[13:17.720 --> 13:22.400]  Middle men, I don't know who the middlemen are. I don't know if they never say middle
[13:22.400 --> 13:28.160]  women, so they're politically not correct. But I've heard the term middlemen for a long
[13:28.160 --> 13:32.640]  time. They are so wealthy. They are so wealthy. Nobody has any idea who the hell they are,
[13:32.640 --> 13:36.760]  what they do. They make more money than the drug companies. You know, in old fairness,
[13:36.760 --> 13:41.760]  at least the drug companies have to produce a product. And it has to be a good product.
[13:41.760 --> 13:47.000]  But the middlemen, well, the rebate that I'm doing cuts out the middlemen and reduces costs
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.380]  and the money goes back to the people purchasing the drugs. So I have a lot of enemies out
[13:52.380 --> 13:57.480]  there. This may be the last time you'll see me for a while. A lot of very, very rich enemies,
[13:57.480 --> 14:02.280]  but they are not happy with what I'm doing. But I figure we have one chance to do it and
[14:02.280 --> 14:08.120]  no other president's going to do what I do. No other president would do a favorite nations,
[14:08.120 --> 14:14.360]  a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost. Nobody. And there are a lot of
[14:14.360 --> 14:20.800]  unhappy people, and they're very rich people, and they're very unhappy. Here's my fourth
[14:20.800 --> 14:27.520]  promise to American workers. Beyond our medical supply chains over the next four years, we
[14:27.520 --> 14:32.400]  will launch our millions of new manufacturing jobs across many other critical sectors that
[14:32.400 --> 14:39.240]  are vital to our national security and prosperity, from electronics to machine tools to shipping
[14:39.240 --> 14:46.480]  aerospace autos, and of course, to iron and to steel. And we'll never forget your washers
[14:46.480 --> 14:54.640]  and your dryers, okay? During eight years of the last administration. And by the way,
[14:54.640 --> 14:58.240]  I have to just tell you this little story, a couple of little stories, if you don't mind.
[14:58.240 --> 15:04.280]  Do you mind? Okay, because that's better than the other stuff, right? No, I was with somebody
[15:04.280 --> 15:09.000]  and they said, you know, for a dishwasher, we don't have enough water, sir. I think a
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.200]  lot of the people in the audience would understand what I'm saying. They don't have enough water
[15:13.200 --> 15:18.960]  because they put restrictors on. So you don't have any water. And I said, what is that?
[15:18.960 --> 15:21.840]  And what is that? And most states, I mean, outside of desert areas, we have so much
[15:21.840 --> 15:25.200]  water, we don't know what to do with it, right? A lot of states, your state does pretty well
[15:25.200 --> 15:30.400]  with water, right? So they have plenty of water. So there's the president in context
[15:30.400 --> 15:35.320]  explaining how we're being enslaved, we're being told to go without, while these globalists
[15:35.320 --> 15:39.160]  transfer all the wealth to themselves and say, oh, COVID's to help the poor person, when
[15:39.160 --> 15:44.000]  it's hurt the poor people and made more of the billionaires than it's ever done before.
[15:44.000 --> 15:49.440]  The president has fired the bat signal. He's telling you that there's an active kill against
[15:49.440 --> 15:53.760]  him. And he knows they're preparing to kill him. What are we going to do to stand up against
[15:53.760 --> 15:57.160]  that?
[15:57.160 --> 16:00.760]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years. And if you go back to those
[16:00.760 --> 16:07.680]  shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master
[16:07.680 --> 16:13.680]  computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict large
[16:13.680 --> 16:17.880]  groups of human movements and activities, but even predict what individuals would do.
[16:17.880 --> 16:22.640]  And then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing, you could add stimuli
[16:22.640 --> 16:28.520]  through the AI systems, through the computers, through digital billboards, through face scanning,
[16:28.520 --> 16:32.920]  through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you wanted to.
[16:32.920 --> 16:37.320]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say, we were making it up. It was a
[16:37.320 --> 16:42.240]  conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate level, blueprint documents.
[16:42.240 --> 16:46.840]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this
[16:46.840 --> 16:51.920]  control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out. And it's something about a thousand
[16:51.920 --> 16:57.240]  times crazier than what Hitler planned. So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[16:57.240 --> 17:03.680]  America and the world should have never been closed. It was all based on WHO, Bill of
[17:03.680 --> 17:10.480]  Melinda Gates, Fauci NIH lives. But now here we are already into August, and they're trying
[17:10.480 --> 17:19.320]  to keep our stores, our factories, our schools, our parks closed. It is outrageous. Well,
[17:19.320 --> 17:27.120]  we have launched a new big sale titled Reopen America Back to School Special 50 to 60% off
[17:27.120 --> 17:34.080]  all of our top sellers and double patriot points at infowarstore.com. And despite the fact that
[17:34.080 --> 17:39.280]  our ultimate turmeric formula bodies is selling out, we still have it at 50% off for a limited
[17:39.280 --> 17:46.200]  time, living defense, which is beyond probiotics, 50% off, vaso beats, amazing concentrated
[17:46.200 --> 17:53.120]  beat extract of all of its benefits, selling out so 50% off and so much more at infowarstore.com
[17:53.120 --> 18:01.840]  and your purchase funds the info war a true 360 win. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[18:01.840 --> 18:26.000]  show 87 days until the election. The deep state doesn't want to have they've got their
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.520]  fake mail in ballots. They've got the illegals voting. They've got millions voting the names
[18:30.520 --> 18:36.600]  of dead people off the voter rolls. But is that enough for their electronic voting machines
[18:36.600 --> 18:43.440]  with the landslide that many inside experts? I also believe is really going to happen.
[18:43.440 --> 18:47.640]  The American people are rejecting the new world order. So what are they planning? If
[18:47.640 --> 18:53.120]  you just joined us, President Trump came out. Let's play the short 32nd version. I just
[18:53.120 --> 18:59.600]  played it in context, a two minute clip and said there are a lot of powerful people because
[18:59.600 --> 19:05.640]  I'm moving pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the US. Over 90% of our manufacturing's
[19:05.640 --> 19:13.680]  done overseas. Most of it in China. He said I'm bringing it back. And he said a lot of
[19:13.680 --> 19:20.880]  people are powerful and they want to get rid of me. So may not see me for a while. A lot
[19:20.880 --> 19:29.560]  of powerful people are angry. That means see me in heaven. It's very obvious statement.
[19:29.560 --> 19:33.160]  He didn't mean he's going to go to present. He means we'll be seeing you for a while.
[19:33.160 --> 19:37.760]  It's like grandpa says when he's dying, I'll see you. Just be a good man. I'll see you
[19:37.760 --> 19:42.560]  in heaven. Love you. You ever out in the woods hunting or whatever and you hear stuff rustling
[19:42.560 --> 19:48.760]  around the bushes. That's my spirit. I'm there looking over you. It's like when Trump came
[19:48.760 --> 19:54.320]  out said I wish his lane Maxwell. Well, I said he means he didn't want to die in present.
[19:54.320 --> 19:59.480]  He wants to turn against the insiders and expose them and people said, Oh no, he's signaling
[19:59.480 --> 20:04.040]  he likes her. No, no. And then Trump came out and said, No, I don't want to die in
[20:04.040 --> 20:10.720]  prison. I want her to expose who she was involved with. It's very obvious statement. He's fired
[20:10.720 --> 20:16.000]  the bat signal. He says powerful people are coming after me. He says we got one shot to
[20:16.000 --> 20:26.440]  do this. Here's what he said again. Have you just joined us?
[20:26.440 --> 20:31.040]  So I have a lot of enemies out there. This may be the last time you'll see me for a while.
[20:31.040 --> 20:36.080]  Lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I'm doing. But I figure
[20:36.080 --> 20:40.800]  we have one chance to do it and no other president's going to do what I do. No other president
[20:40.800 --> 20:49.240]  would do a favorite nations, a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost. Nobody.
[20:49.240 --> 20:56.080]  And they're a lot of unhappy people and they're very rich people and they're very unhappy.
[20:56.080 --> 20:59.960]  So he's telling you, we got one shot to save the country. They may kill me. And then I've
[20:59.960 --> 21:03.160]  got to stack a news share where they're saying we're going to kill him. We're going to remove
[21:03.160 --> 21:07.080]  him. We're going to use the military on him. And if the cabinet doesn't go along with it,
[21:07.080 --> 21:10.760]  we're going to put them in prison. Here's the Washington Post. Trump could lose and
[21:10.760 --> 21:16.440]  not leave, but cabinet members who try to help could face prison. So they're saying he's
[21:16.440 --> 21:20.080]  illegitimate, just like they said. And if he fights the election, if he says we tried
[21:20.080 --> 21:23.680]  to steal it, or if there's a challenge election, which all the experts are saying is going
[21:23.680 --> 21:29.800]  to happen again, if he challenges the Democrats challenging, he'll be removed by the military.
[21:29.800 --> 21:34.880]  What did Biden say? He said the same thing. Biden absolutely convinced military would
[21:34.880 --> 21:40.160]  escort Trump from the White House. Here's Pelosi says Trump will be fumigated out if
[21:40.160 --> 21:46.760]  he refuses to leave after White House lost one way or another. He's gone.
[21:46.760 --> 21:50.600]  Then you've got right wing watch. You notice doesn't ever show a video of me because they
[21:50.600 --> 21:57.600]  took a long talk and edited the words together like the refrigerator magnet game. I could
[21:57.600 --> 22:03.520]  take the Bible and trim up the New Testament and have the words saying Jesus loves Satan.
[22:03.520 --> 22:08.560]  Jesus loves Moloch. It's not true, but that's what they said. Alex Jones tells listeners
[22:08.560 --> 22:12.400]  to get ready to die to fight the new world order. They have another headline saying,
[22:12.400 --> 22:18.840]  I say go out and quote, kill a lot of people. No, and I said was, is that the weatherman
[22:18.840 --> 22:22.840]  whose system is running anti-fund Black Lives Matter, the founders of Black Lives Matter
[22:22.840 --> 22:28.840]  say it funded by Soros, say they want to collapse civilization and then bring in China and Cuba
[22:28.840 --> 22:34.920]  and others to put 50 million people in reeducation camps and then kill 25 million. That's when
[22:34.920 --> 22:40.480]  the US population was 190 million. So I guess by those new numbers, they'd want to put 90
[22:40.480 --> 22:47.560]  million in and kill 40 million or something around those numbers. This is their idea and
[22:47.560 --> 22:51.520]  look how close they are to doing it because we stand down and we roll over. We reject
[22:51.520 --> 22:57.440]  the president openly trying to save the Republic. We reject the president openly trying to say
[22:57.440 --> 23:02.560]  we've got one sided trade deals. We've got open borders. We've got China sealing our
[23:02.560 --> 23:08.040]  intellectual property. And then the media, the Washington Post says, GG Ping must destroy
[23:08.040 --> 23:16.080]  Trump to save America. Remember that headline? Destroy Trump and the left cheers China. They're
[23:16.080 --> 23:20.520]  against their own country. They're idiots when that's what's deindustrialized them and
[23:20.520 --> 23:25.880]  enslaved them and they're told that they're a service economy now. And then COVID-19 shuts
[23:25.880 --> 23:30.720]  down the small time service economy, hurts the left the worst and they go, we want total
[23:30.720 --> 23:35.440]  martial law. That'll fix it and they'll get even worse, but they don't care because they're
[23:35.440 --> 23:44.200]  schmucks. G's choice, destroy Trump or save him and weaken America. Oh yeah, because selling
[23:44.200 --> 23:47.880]  us out to China really strengthens the country. It's like the Federal Reserve that goes, we
[23:47.880 --> 23:53.920]  need to keep the lockdowns going to save the economy. Meanwhile, the national numbers are
[23:53.920 --> 24:15.240]  out. It's 0.037 death rate for COVID infections. 0.037. 37% of one point. No. It's not even
[24:15.240 --> 24:21.800]  that. It's the flu is 10 times more deadly. They're saying now, not three times, total
[24:21.800 --> 24:28.000]  oaks, but they can focus on every person that dies of some pneumonia or flu. You always
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.720]  read later, they had cancer. Herman K was really healthy. He had a three kinds of cancer and
[24:32.720 --> 24:38.160]  couldn't barely walk. These people are really healthy. They had diabetes and cancer. This
[24:38.160 --> 24:41.440]  kid was born with holes in their heart and was in surgery and died. But we're saying
[24:41.440 --> 24:45.080]  COVID. Here's Larry Gretzwald, the green beret that infiltrated the weatherman when they're
[24:45.080 --> 24:47.840]  sitting around talking about what they're going to do to us and our families. Here it
[24:47.840 --> 24:56.600]  is. I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government.
[24:56.600 --> 25:07.120]  We become responsible then for administrating 250 million people. There was no answers.
[25:07.120 --> 25:11.840]  No one had given any thought to economics. How are you going to close and feed these
[25:11.840 --> 25:17.080]  people? The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans in the
[25:17.080 --> 25:22.840]  North Vietnamese and the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions
[25:22.840 --> 25:28.040]  of the United States. They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to
[25:28.040 --> 25:35.080]  protect against what they called the counterrevolution. They felt that this counterrevolution could
[25:35.080 --> 25:44.720]  best be guarded against by creating and establishing reeducation centers in the Southwest where
[25:44.720 --> 25:50.040]  we would take all the people who needed to be reeducated into the new way of thinking
[25:50.040 --> 25:56.280]  and teach them how things were going to be. I asked, well, what is going to happen to
[25:56.280 --> 26:03.240]  those people that we can't reeducate that are diehard capitalists? And the reply was
[26:03.240 --> 26:08.800]  that they'd have to be eliminated. And when I pursued this further, they estimated that
[26:08.800 --> 26:15.000]  they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these reeducation centers. And when I say
[26:15.000 --> 26:22.520]  eliminate, I mean kill. 25 million people. I want you to imagine sitting in a room with
[26:22.520 --> 26:32.840]  25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational
[26:32.840 --> 26:41.120]  centers and hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people. And
[26:41.120 --> 26:49.760]  they were dead serious. So I laid that out of my right wing watch rant. And I said that
[26:49.760 --> 26:52.640]  if they take over and try this, we're going to have to really fight them. And by the way,
[26:52.640 --> 26:55.640]  on all the burning tapes, they said they want to kill us and our families. I'm really, really
[26:55.640 --> 27:01.080]  proud of the Dr. Jones Naturals activated charcoal, naturally fluoride free mouthwash

[30:16.440 --> 30:29.040]  The Soros financed monster, Leticia James, that sent close to 10,000 old people in nursing
[30:29.040 --> 30:34.080]  homes to their deaths by sending infected COVID patients to them right at half the deaths
[30:34.080 --> 30:41.760]  in New York. The monster, the serial killer, has pledged to destroy America's oldest civil
[30:41.760 --> 30:45.440]  rights organization established after the Civil War to train blacks. I don't learn how
[30:45.440 --> 30:50.360]  to use guns in the south and to train northerners how to shoot because of the south and what
[30:50.360 --> 30:54.800]  they're asked because northerners were living in cities. Talk about an American institution.
[30:54.800 --> 30:58.760]  She pledges will help hear it from her to destroy it. Here she is.
[30:58.760 --> 31:08.880]  And the co chief of the enforcement section, Emily Stern. Just a few minutes ago, my office
[31:08.880 --> 31:14.420]  filed a lawsuit against the National Rifle Association to dissolve the organization in
[31:14.420 --> 31:23.120]  its entirety for years of self dealing and illegal conduct that violate New York's charity's
[31:23.120 --> 31:28.440]  law and undermine its own mission.
[31:28.440 --> 31:32.360]  So she's going to abolish it. Wow. I mean, even if they did something wrong, which there's
[31:32.360 --> 31:37.600]  no evidence they did. This is purely political. You would just have Wayne Lampier step down
[31:37.600 --> 31:41.080]  or whoever did something wrong. You don't get rid of one of the oldest institutions
[31:41.080 --> 31:45.040]  in America that represents tens of millions of Americans. I know Ted Nugent is a board
[31:45.040 --> 31:48.240]  member. I don't know how much he can say about this. We don't have to say the second amendment
[31:48.240 --> 31:51.700]  to save the country in general. I beg Trump to fire the bat signal and point out they're
[31:51.700 --> 31:55.840]  trying a new coup with election fraud in the Washington Post. Talk about the military
[31:55.840 --> 31:59.720]  removing him. Trump came out and said, I may not be here much longer. They may take me
[31:59.720 --> 32:01.640]  out yesterday.
[32:01.640 --> 32:04.800]  General Flynn put a letter saying it's good versus evil. We're in the middle of an attempted
[32:04.800 --> 32:09.880]  communist overthrow. That's really happening. Ted Nugent, as you said last time you came
[32:09.880 --> 32:13.560]  on, you didn't say it on air. You said to me probably said, Alex, they've been working
[32:13.560 --> 32:17.720]  towards this for a 50 plus years. Our whole lives are coming down to what's happening
[32:17.720 --> 32:21.840]  right now. You've got the floor, my friend. What do you what can you say to us about the
[32:21.840 --> 32:25.520]  nightmare scenario we're seeing unfold and what should we all do right now? Because I
[32:25.520 --> 32:29.640]  mean, I'm a peaceful guy and I'm not a general that's going to, you know, lead any charges
[32:29.640 --> 32:32.280]  here, but I'm ready to go to war of these communists think they're going to overthrow
[32:32.280 --> 32:33.280]  the country.
[32:33.280 --> 32:39.680]  Well, I can go back quite a ways with everything you say and present Alex. So let me just start
[32:39.680 --> 32:46.680]  by saying we, the people give you a huge loud and proud ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto.
[32:46.680 --> 32:52.480]  I want to say first of all, it's a it's a pain in the ass and a crying shame really
[32:52.480 --> 32:58.360]  that we have to fight this culture war at these toxic levels, these demonic treasonous
[32:58.360 --> 33:06.760]  levels. But if the line were drawn in the sand any more obvious, we'd be falling off
[33:06.760 --> 33:12.920]  the cliff in the Venezuelan by now. So let me just repeat the obvious. And that is that
[33:12.920 --> 33:19.680]  God gave me the instinct and the mindset and the spirit for self preservation. Our founding
[33:19.680 --> 33:24.800]  fathers knew that the kings and the tyrants and the punk ass dictators didn't allow citizens
[33:24.800 --> 33:30.720]  to have these rights to exercise our pure instincts from God. So we wrote it down in
[33:30.720 --> 33:31.720]  the car.
[33:31.720 --> 33:35.280]  And we fought a war and we set up the most successful country in history. Damn right.
[33:35.280 --> 33:39.160]  Yeah, even where there's this little thing called freedom where we the people get to
[33:39.160 --> 33:43.440]  determine our life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. So we can go ahead and examine
[33:43.440 --> 33:49.120]  and scrutinize the cockroaches that your brilliant spotlight exposes every day. But I've got
[33:49.120 --> 33:54.680]  a pretty good cockroach spotlight myself. I've been exercising increasing the lumens
[33:54.680 --> 34:02.080]  for about 50 some years now. And it's never been more offensive and heartbreaking that
[34:02.080 --> 34:08.640]  the left is so obvious in their year. We're going to take your god year. Yeah, the air
[34:08.640 --> 34:13.440]  fifties were coming to get them. I mean, they used to hide that thinking people were so
[34:13.440 --> 34:19.600]  stupid that they actually wanted common sense gun safety reform. Yeah, right. And I play
[34:19.600 --> 34:26.520]  accordion in the Zydeco band with Galen Jenner. My point is, is that if we the people, we
[34:26.520 --> 34:33.720]  can't just identify the toxic beast at the door. We've got to tell our elected employees
[34:33.720 --> 34:41.120]  that we see the toxic beast at the door. Get rid of the toxic beast. I have a son who has
[34:41.120 --> 34:47.720]  a wonderful restaurant that's been shut down by the communist Chinese virus Democrats in
[34:47.720 --> 34:52.720]  the state of New York. Like I was, I was denied entry into that state recently to say thank
[34:52.720 --> 34:59.240]  you to the law enforcement heroes. I mean, you, this is, this is Nazi Germany. And I
[34:59.240 --> 35:04.680]  know they haven't kicked down everybody's door yet, but they're kicking down doors.
[35:04.680 --> 35:10.680]  They're taking weapons. They're taking away freedom. So all I can say, Alex is what I
[35:10.680 --> 35:18.280]  repeated odd nauseam odd infinitum. If we the people who don't see these demonic behaviors
[35:18.280 --> 35:23.160]  and, and in treasonous behaviors by the left and every Democrat I can imagine, I mean,
[35:23.160 --> 35:28.400]  they're, they're all the same gang. You can't wear a sheet on your head and claim you don't
[35:28.400 --> 35:34.040]  support the KKK. If you're at the burning cross and you're part of that team, that's
[35:34.040 --> 35:39.680]  what you represent. And the Democrats represent, you don't need to read this. You need to
[35:39.680 --> 35:45.680]  sign it to find out what in it. And then Pelosi commits a felony on live television as she
[35:45.680 --> 35:50.800]  destroys our state of the union. I could go on and off with the Hillary Clinton and the,
[35:50.800 --> 35:56.200]  and the Barack Obama and the Eric Holder who gave guns to Mexican gangs to kill Brian Terry
[35:56.200 --> 36:03.040]  and how they told the U S Marine court, don't save the Americans and Benghazi and brain
[36:03.040 --> 36:10.000]  dead traders like Juan Williams still claims that Benghazi didn't happen. I could go on
[36:10.000 --> 36:15.640]  with thousands of exam or Antifa doesn't exist. Nadler, let me throw this at you.
[36:15.640 --> 36:20.960]  They're now coming, trying to block you playing around the country or anybody else's Patriot.
[36:20.960 --> 36:24.560]  They're barring people coming into New York. They're killing old people in the nursing
[36:24.560 --> 36:29.200]  homes. And now they're censoring the president's tweets. And now he's saying, I'm taking
[36:29.200 --> 36:33.040]  them on. I'm bringing the jobs back. I'm bringing big pharma back. They're going to try to take
[36:33.040 --> 36:38.000]  me out. I may not see you for a while. Is that not President Trump firing the bat signal
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  telling us that, Hey, this is serious?
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.840]  Well, and again, Alex, Joe's been shining the bat signal. I've been shining the bat
[36:44.840 --> 36:49.360]  signal. That's why we're considered extremists. And there are so many people, including family
[36:49.360 --> 36:54.480]  members and friends and coworkers of listening to us right now, that when we repeat what
[36:54.480 --> 37:01.440]  sounds unbelievable, Alex Jones says that Cuomo sent in COVID positive people and killed
[37:01.440 --> 37:10.240]  6,000 elderly. That's exactly what he did. So again, Cuomo is not the worst violator.
[37:10.240 --> 37:15.600]  It's people who know what he did and don't fix their friends and their families, their
[37:15.600 --> 37:23.120]  coworkers and go, it's not a wild conspiracy. We have the dead bodies to prove it. And again,
[37:23.120 --> 37:32.720]  Alex, I got to tell you, liberalism is a spiritual curse. Tyranny is slavery. Democrats are tyrants.
[37:32.720 --> 37:37.560]  And if we, the people who believe in truth, logic, common sense, life, liberty, pursuit
[37:37.560 --> 37:41.160]  of happiness and God given individual rights guaranteed by the Constitution, the Bill of
[37:41.160 --> 37:48.400]  Rights, if we don't raise hell with everybody in our lives to vote God, family, country
[37:48.400 --> 37:54.160]  against tyrants, against Second Amendment destroyers, Joe Biden and his entire gang,
[37:54.160 --> 37:59.000]  if we don't do that, we deserve what we get. I agree. We've got to get out of our comfort
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.400]  zones. We've got to go knock on neighbor's doors. We've got to call people randomly out
[38:02.400 --> 38:08.040]  of the phone, but we've got to all send people audio clips, videos, text messages with this
[38:08.040 --> 38:12.840]  interview with your articles from TedNugent.com. If everybody just reaches 10, 20 people a
[38:12.840 --> 38:17.920]  day and raises the alarm as modern Paul reveres, the globalists can't get away with this. But
[38:17.920 --> 38:21.560]  I know you're on the NRA board. I know you can't specifically get into the attacks that
[38:21.560 --> 38:28.280]  are going on, but to have this Soros appointed person trying to lie about the NRA and saying
[38:28.280 --> 38:33.400]  she's going to shut it down. That tells us we're two minutes to midnight and imagine
[38:33.400 --> 38:38.680]  if Trump loses what they're going to do. Well, and let me clarify as a standing member
[38:38.680 --> 38:42.680]  of the National Rifle Association Board of Directors, I've received some of the highest
[38:42.680 --> 38:46.560]  votes in the history of this great civil rights organization. And I thank everybody
[38:46.560 --> 38:52.560]  from the bottom of my greasy, all American barbecue, heart, rock and roll soul. I and
[38:52.560 --> 38:58.080]  that the reason I get the votes is not because I'm a paper pusher. It's not because I study,
[38:58.080 --> 39:04.640]  you know, accounting and I study their agenda. What I represent is that the first amendment
[39:04.640 --> 39:12.400]  is good in all 50 states without government issued paperwork. Let me repeat that, Alex.
[39:12.400 --> 39:22.160]  I have a first amendment in all 50 states without paperwork. That's the same right I
[39:22.160 --> 39:27.760]  want and I demand for the second amendment. If people go, well, the bad guys can get guns.
[39:27.760 --> 39:36.760]  And keep the damn bad guys in a cage. We have engineered recidivism. Alex, write that down.
[39:36.760 --> 39:41.960]  Everybody write it down. Ten Nugent, ten Nugent percent of violent crime is is repeated by
[39:41.960 --> 39:45.440]  Ted Stahler. We got to go to break. We got one more segment with you. We'll come back
[39:45.440 --> 39:49.000]  and talk about that. And now the Democrats say we're going to release all the criminals.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.800]  But if you don't wear a mask, we're going to put you in jail. But we want to abolish
[39:51.800 --> 39:55.800]  the police. But the police seem to come take your guns. The reasons that the globalist
[39:55.800 --> 40:01.800]  launch is planetary lockdown. The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[40:01.800 --> 40:08.600]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air. The casual society, the surveillance
[40:08.600 --> 40:13.840]  system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation. But the most important
[40:13.840 --> 40:22.160]  facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential as we begin to witness
[40:22.160 --> 40:29.400]  automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design. This
[40:29.400 --> 40:35.520]  isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into. It's been preplanned, organized
[40:35.520 --> 40:42.000]  globally. And it's extremely predatory. And through governmental actuaries and tax programs
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.880]  and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the
[40:47.880 --> 40:54.160]  losers and consolidate power. This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[40:54.160 --> 40:59.080]  The people are awakening. They're taking control of their own environment. Cell phones are
[40:59.080 --> 41:04.880]  an amazing tool. Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld. But big tech, large corporations,
[41:04.880 --> 41:09.680]  hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai comms especially, are using this
[41:09.680 --> 41:14.560]  to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to
[41:14.560 --> 41:19.200]  scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict on record what's going to
[41:19.200 --> 41:26.000]  happen in mass movements. Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.280]  their AI takeover. In their own words, they admit it. So I've been selling privacy pouches
[41:31.280 --> 41:34.920]  and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade. And now the units have
[41:34.920 --> 41:38.840]  gotten really lightweight. They're Faraday cages. They just look like a cloth envelope.
[41:38.840 --> 41:43.480]  They work absolutely great. And it just gives you that security to have power over your
[41:43.480 --> 41:47.880]  data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother
[41:47.880 --> 41:55.160]  to know what you're up to because it's other business. Get yours at m4sport.com today.
[41:55.160 --> 41:59.280]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup. My second cup of the day. It's really
[41:59.280 --> 42:03.320]  strong. I shouldn't do this because all work and no playmates jack a really aggressive
[42:03.320 --> 42:07.640]  boy and the coffee has to wake up America coffee there by loves highest rated in the
[42:07.640 --> 42:11.240]  choppers mountains. It's beyond Mexican coffee beyond Guatemala and coffee. It's the best
[42:11.240 --> 42:14.360]  coffee in the world. It's right on the border between the two countries in those rainforests
[42:14.360 --> 42:19.240]  hand selected. It's beyond organic. Wildcrafted. Wake up America coffee. People are blown away
[42:19.240 --> 42:23.960]  about how good it is. Same stuff sold in Whole Foods on another name for $30 for the same size
[42:23.960 --> 42:28.360]  container. Yes, folks, we've been selling at 10 years, never raised the price. 1995 is

[42:57.920 --> 43:09.560]  The Wild Wild West. The Renaissance. America. Human liberty. The West built all the freedom.
[43:09.560 --> 43:16.000]  All the choices. All the empowerment we see. The general population has been programmed
[43:16.000 --> 43:22.680]  that submission to tyranny brings them prosperity. Because the last 50 years under psychotic
[43:22.680 --> 43:29.600]  globalist control, they have taught us by successive approximation to bow down and each
[43:29.600 --> 43:35.680]  time be given a reward, a treat. That's like training wild pigs to come eat out of your
[43:35.680 --> 43:42.400]  hand. And finally, one day you lead them into the barn and close the door and butcher them.
[43:42.400 --> 43:48.800]  We're now reaching that point in societal development where submission is death. Where
[43:48.800 --> 43:58.240]  submission is the human species being destroyed forever on the altar of Satan.
[43:58.240 --> 44:11.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups.
[44:11.720 --> 44:18.960]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex
[44:18.960 --> 44:19.960]  Jones.
[44:19.960 --> 44:26.800]  All right, we got 10 and a half minutes left with the Motor City madman Ted Nugent, who's
[44:26.800 --> 44:30.040]  in the great city of Texas right now, but about to head back up to Michigan in a few
[44:30.040 --> 44:34.920]  days. They'll be joining us again obviously during the next 87 days. This do or die time
[44:34.920 --> 44:39.040]  for the Republic when the real forces of evil have taken their mask off or like blow up the
[44:39.040 --> 44:43.440]  police departments. That's the official city of Austin budget to demolish the police department
[44:43.440 --> 44:47.560]  and cut its budget by a third. They actually say blow it up as a symbol of fighting police
[44:47.560 --> 44:51.640]  evil. I'm not lying, folks. That's true. Look it up. It's in the mainstream news. They are
[44:51.640 --> 44:57.200]  saying abolish the nuclear family, take all the guns that China is our friend, that America
[44:57.200 --> 45:03.440]  is bad. Ted Nugent, you were getting into recidivism and how they're releasing the rapists
[45:03.440 --> 45:08.120]  and murderers, but saying people that don't wear a mask are going to go to jail and saying
[45:08.120 --> 45:15.320]  abolish the police. But you also can't have a gun and in places like Minnesota and Minneapolis,
[45:15.320 --> 45:19.320]  as you know, the police chief came out this week and said, we cannot protect you, but
[45:19.320 --> 45:23.680]  you're not allowed to protect yourself. Do what the criminals say. Give them everything
[45:23.680 --> 45:27.960]  you've got. Follow their directions. I mean, this is mass Stockholm syndrome. Can you speak
[45:27.960 --> 45:32.880]  to that? Well, I pay attention. I actually believe that guitar players qualify as we
[45:32.880 --> 45:37.880]  the people. So I make sure that I do my duties as a husband and a father and a grandfather
[45:37.880 --> 45:43.320]  and a bandmate and a citizen and a neighbor and a hardworking American in the asset column
[45:43.320 --> 45:47.520]  producing instead of taking. So that's why I'm considered a radical. But all the things
[45:47.520 --> 45:53.080]  you're mentioning are just so glaring. It's amazing that the left, that side, I mean,
[45:53.080 --> 45:57.200]  literally the Democrats are on the side of Antifa. They're terrorists. They're on the
[45:57.200 --> 46:01.040]  side of terrorists. They're on the side of Black Lives Matter, which has nothing to do
[46:01.040 --> 46:07.120]  with Black lives and has everything to do with the intentional destruction of every quality
[46:07.120 --> 46:11.280]  of life procedure in the history of the United States of America that gives more freedom
[46:11.280 --> 46:17.400]  than any society in the history of mankind. And they side with MS-13. Let's make sure
[46:17.400 --> 46:21.800]  that everybody knows that Ted Nugent doesn't even have to be a radical. Alex Jones doesn't
[46:21.800 --> 46:29.000]  have to be an extremist to merely show the footage of Nancy Pelosi trying to find redeemable
[46:29.000 --> 46:38.000]  qualities for the MS-13 gangbangers whose battle cry is rape, torture, murder. I don't
[46:38.000 --> 46:46.600]  have to guess what that means. The Democrats are on the side of the devils that are killing,
[46:46.600 --> 46:54.640]  raping and torturing America. Alex, what planet have we land on? But you're right. As these
[46:54.640 --> 47:00.600]  so-called judges, how they qualify as a judge is beyond me. Or these parole boards or these
[47:00.600 --> 47:06.960]  state prosecutors or these state attorney generals, they continue to let rapists and murderers
[47:06.960 --> 47:13.200]  and stabbers and assaulters and burglars and carjackers and child molesters, they keep
[47:13.200 --> 47:18.440]  letting them out. This is not a Ted Nugent hunch. It's articulated and outlined in the
[47:18.440 --> 47:24.600]  FBI Uniform Crime Report that years ago, even before the Chinese virus and years before
[47:24.600 --> 47:31.200]  the Democrats became members of terrorist organizations, the ones that believe in genital
[47:31.200 --> 47:40.600]  mutilation, we have members of Congress in the Senate that side with the voodoo of genital
[47:40.600 --> 47:48.680]  mutilation and throwing gays off of roofs. I don't have to search for such atrocities.
[47:48.680 --> 47:55.840]  They're on record. But yes, we are living in engineered recidivism. The so-called court
[47:55.840 --> 48:03.720]  system of our country guarantees that you and I will pass by convicted murderers and
[48:03.720 --> 48:10.640]  rapists and child molesters and sex traffickers. They keep letting them out and then they make
[48:10.640 --> 48:16.880]  it more difficult if not downright eliminate the capability of a free American to purchase
[48:16.880 --> 48:24.000]  a gun or ammunition. Here's the fascinating part. When people hear you and I talk like
[48:24.000 --> 48:30.320]  this, luckily we have a selective audience that already has the soulfulness to examine
[48:30.320 --> 48:35.000]  conditions in America. So they know we're speaking the truth. The evidence is inescapable
[48:35.000 --> 48:40.720]  unless you've got your ears, eyes, and heart plugged up. But the evidence for engineered
[48:40.720 --> 48:47.600]  recidivism is inescapable. And once again, if we, the people, don't raise hell with
[48:47.600 --> 48:53.160]  our senators, our congressmen, our mayor, our governor, our attorney generals, why are
[48:53.160 --> 49:04.360]  you letting out violent criminals while arresting people going to church? Alex, in Michigan,
[49:04.360 --> 49:11.720]  you could not, by law, buy seeds for a garden, go in your boat, but you could buy dope and
[49:11.720 --> 49:19.160]  whiskey and buy lottery tickets and you can riot, but you can't go to church.
[49:19.160 --> 49:23.080]  It's incredible. It's right out of the old Soviet Union or communist China and they admit
[49:23.080 --> 49:28.320]  that the model is communist China. Let me raise this point. People need to know that
[49:28.320 --> 49:32.440]  if they don't get extremely politically active, extremely politically aggressive, that the
[49:32.440 --> 49:36.560]  communists and the globalists believe this is their move to overthrow America. They're
[49:36.560 --> 49:41.120]  really trying it right now. I have videos in England where journalists show Muslims
[49:41.120 --> 49:46.040]  by the hundreds being offloaded by the government and taken into the country by design, the
[49:46.040 --> 49:51.800]  reporters get arrested. They're threatening to arrest Nigel Farage. So he's not allowed
[49:51.800 --> 49:57.360]  to show this. They have now arrested another journalist in New York. The Hindus had an
[49:57.360 --> 50:03.800]  event celebrating one of their ancient shrines that Muslims took over. Twitter took that
[50:03.800 --> 50:08.840]  down and said, you can't celebrate your ancient shrine. It upsets the Muslims. I mean, this
[50:08.840 --> 50:14.880]  is literally a total sellout. LeBron James supports slave camps in China, making his
[50:14.880 --> 50:19.640]  jerseys, but says America sucks. I mean, these people are incredible, but let's bring up
[50:19.640 --> 50:24.840]  what you think in the four minutes we have left. Happens if Trump does fail and they
[50:24.840 --> 50:28.120]  literally start coming to take the guns and an actual civil war starts. Can you speak
[50:28.120 --> 50:32.320]  to that? But first, I know you're an NRA board member, and I know you're not involved in
[50:32.320 --> 50:35.480]  the bookkeeping and the rest of it. And I know so that's not really your place to speak
[50:35.480 --> 50:41.400]  as a board member that has to be agreed upon. But as a citizen and as a patriot and a grandfather
[50:41.400 --> 50:45.520]  and as an American, we talk during the break. Can you repeat what you said to me there,
[50:45.520 --> 50:46.520]  police sir?
[50:46.520 --> 50:51.040]  Well, once again, I am not going to speak as a member of the NRA board. I'm not allowed
[50:51.040 --> 50:54.920]  to. It's against the law and I'm certainly not going to comment on any litigation that's
[50:54.920 --> 51:01.200]  taking place right now by freedom haters and gun haters and we the people haters. I think
[51:01.200 --> 51:07.120]  that summarizes pretty nicely right there. But as a citizen, as an American free citizen
[51:07.120 --> 51:11.680]  who bust my ass to be in the asset column every day of my life, and that's how my children,
[51:11.680 --> 51:17.440]  my brothers, my sister, my band, my crew, everybody in my life is an asset to America.
[51:17.440 --> 51:24.000]  I want to make sure that this great civil rights organization, the National Rifle Association,
[51:24.000 --> 51:30.240]  continues to do their job to make sure that we have and we keep the right given to us
[51:30.240 --> 51:37.640]  by God individually to keep and bear arms. I'm not aware of financial maneuvers of the
[51:37.640 --> 51:43.320]  NRA. I only attend an occasional board meeting when my schedule permits and I bust my ass
[51:43.320 --> 51:48.840]  to get there. But there are so many board members on the NRA. I believe in these gentlemen
[51:48.840 --> 51:54.440]  and these ladies. These are real patriots and I believe that the attacks on the NRA
[51:54.440 --> 52:01.640]  are the attacks on freedom by freedom haters and we all see and know who they are. Right
[52:01.640 --> 52:07.760]  now is the time to give away NRA memberships to everybody you know because if it drives
[52:07.760 --> 52:13.400]  the freedom haters that baddie, let's make them go crazy by getting more NRA memberships.
[52:13.400 --> 52:18.160]  And how do I do that? I'm going to buy 100 memberships today. I pledge 100 memberships
[52:18.160 --> 52:21.120]  today. How do I call? Do I call? And how does the NRA do that?
[52:21.120 --> 52:26.320]  I'll tell you what, go to my website. There's a direct link to join the NRA and at a discount,
[52:26.320 --> 52:32.400]  go to TedNugent.com and there is an NRA membership platform. Remember, the NRA is a civil rights
[52:32.400 --> 52:38.800]  organization. It's about your right to self-defense. How more pure can you get?
[52:38.800 --> 52:44.000]  And it's 140 years old and I know how nonprofits work. This is one of the beautiful, best ones
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.200]  ever. If somebody in there did wrong, we were talking to her in the break, which you're
[52:47.200 --> 52:50.680]  not saying they did. There's no evidence of that. Then they step down. You don't get
[52:50.680 --> 52:54.440]  rid of the organization. She let everybody know. She said, I'm going to abolish it because
[52:54.440 --> 52:58.160]  I'm going to take care of the members. That's like saying I'm going to burn your house down
[52:58.160 --> 53:05.240]  because grandpa ate too many cupcakes. I couldn't have put it better, but really let's look
[53:05.240 --> 53:12.640]  at the real violators. The Clinton Foundation, Planned Parenthood, the Southern Poverty Law
[53:12.640 --> 53:18.920]  Center. These people are violators of the Constitution. They're all violators of nonprofit
[53:18.920 --> 53:25.880]  laws. And we're talking an accumulation of billions of dollars of fraudulently misused
[53:25.880 --> 53:30.440]  donations. Exactly. So Trump needs to go on the offense. The Clinton's got billions to
[53:30.440 --> 53:34.400]  sell out our sovereignty, pay for play. And now they're going after America's oldest
[53:34.400 --> 53:37.920]  civil rights organization. But you did say if they find anything wrong, even though it's
[53:37.920 --> 53:42.320]  not that big a deal, but they claim you violated this regulation or had too many dinners or
[53:42.320 --> 53:46.280]  whatever, those folks just step down. You don't get rid of the organization. That needs
[53:46.280 --> 53:53.280]  to be clear. Absolutely. And again, that's like logic 101. But again, I'm not presuming
[53:53.280 --> 54:00.480]  or alleging any misdeeds by anybody. Let the investigation go forward. But we know that
[54:00.480 --> 54:05.920]  this New York Attorney General hates gun owners. I was about to say, how can you have Hitler
[54:05.920 --> 54:11.280]  investigate, say Jews? It's unbelievable. You know why they hate me because I'm Schindler,
[54:11.280 --> 54:17.040]  but I got a whole bunch of more Jews than I'm saving. And the Nazis hate me for that.
[54:17.040 --> 54:21.320]  Beautiful. Well, I believe the NRA said nothing wrong. I've had them lie about me with financial
[54:21.320 --> 54:25.080]  stuff. It's total fiction, total fraud. The NRA does a great job, especially since you
[54:25.080 --> 54:29.360]  got involved. It's really gotten hardcore. And we love you. We get NRA TV going again,
[54:29.360 --> 54:36.360]  Ted Nugent.com. People can find the sports camp and so much more at Ted Nugent.com. Ted,
[54:36.360 --> 54:40.560]  thank you so much for spending time with us. You bet. God bless America. God bless freedom
[54:40.560 --> 54:46.160]  lovers. Let's raise some hell like never before. Beautiful, sir. America and the world should
[54:46.160 --> 54:54.160]  have never been closed. It was all based on WHO, Billa Melinda Gates, Fauci NIH lives.
[54:54.160 --> 55:01.320]  But now here we are already into August and they're trying to keep our stores, our factories,
[55:01.320 --> 55:09.560]  our schools, our parks closed. It is outrageous. Well, we have launched a new big sale titled
[55:09.560 --> 55:16.920]  Reopen America back to school special 50 to 60% off all of our top sellers and double
[55:16.920 --> 55:22.560]  Patriot points at infowarstore.com. And despite the fact that our ultimate turmeric formula
[55:22.560 --> 55:28.160]  bodies is selling out, we still have it at 50% off. But for a limited time, living defense,
[55:28.160 --> 55:34.280]  which is beyond probiotics, 50% off, vaso beats, amazing concentrated beat extract
[55:34.280 --> 55:40.720]  all of its benefits selling out so 50% off and so much more at infowarstore.com and your
[55:40.720 --> 55:48.000]  purchase funds the info war a true 360 win. Americans have had freedom for so long and
[55:48.000 --> 55:53.760]  most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history that
[55:53.760 --> 55:58.520]  we really have a blind spot for tyranny. We don't appreciate the American way. Truth,
[55:58.520 --> 56:02.520]  justice, due process, the right to self defense, private property because we've had it so
[56:02.520 --> 56:06.400]  long and we just think that's how the rest of the world is. Ladies and gentlemen, the
[56:06.400 --> 56:11.720]  Renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and
[56:11.720 --> 56:16.520]  try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something
[56:16.520 --> 56:21.000]  the West invented. And that's what made our modern world. That's now been hijacked by
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.280]  the technocrats by the globalist who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and
[56:25.280 --> 56:31.400]  we need to be cold and dumb down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate
[56:31.400 --> 56:38.920]  and command even luck enough to stay alive. And that's what COVID-19 is a global UN revolution
[56:38.920 --> 56:42.760]  against free humanity against your family against prosperity and against your future.
[56:42.760 --> 56:47.760]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[56:47.760 --> 57:08.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:08.920 --> 57:14.840]  I think self defense can look violent if you're looking at it as the person who responds
[57:14.840 --> 57:18.760]  and self defense is as culpable, but we don't see it that way. We see ourselves as engaging
[57:18.760 --> 57:21.400]  in self defense from groups who want to do our community harm.
[57:21.400 --> 57:26.960]  The mayor decried the violence, calling those responsible vigilantes. The police video showed
[57:26.960 --> 57:31.120]  one person dumping out a backpack with what appeared to be frozen water bottles, which
[57:31.120 --> 57:36.760]  were then thrown at officers. Demonstrators also hurled fireworks, one sergeant suffering
[57:36.760 --> 57:42.320]  a broken eye socket from the shrapnel. Police said the PVC pipe used to hold the Black Lives
[57:42.320 --> 58:07.360]  Matter banners had been sharpened and were taken out and used to jab at officers.
[58:07.360 --> 58:11.800]  Breaking news in the so-called Capitol Hill organized protest zone. There's been yet another
[58:11.800 --> 58:16.720]  shooting early this morning. Protesters finished a march back to Calendarsen Park when they
[58:16.720 --> 58:20.760]  say gunshots were fired nearby. There were different reasons for Antifa
[58:20.760 --> 58:31.320]  and for these neo-Nazis to be their one racist fascists.
[58:31.320 --> 58:36.760]  I do not make any differentiation between neo-Nazis and Antifa. Just because they claim in their
[58:36.760 --> 58:41.320]  name that they are anti-fascists, their tactics are in fact totally fascist.
[58:41.320 --> 58:49.720]  One of the groups was created to kill people they don't like. The other group, Antifa,
[58:49.720 --> 58:55.200]  has hangers on and aberrant actors within their ranks, but the groups were not created
[58:55.200 --> 59:05.960]  to destroy parts of humanity. Antifa is not a myth.
[59:05.960 --> 59:11.120]  The Democrats refusal to acknowledge the obvious violence spreading like a cancer from the
[59:11.120 --> 59:16.960]  Trump-hating Soros-funded brown shirts terrorizing America, borders on treason.
[59:16.960 --> 59:22.320]  There was no anarchist violence in Lafayette Square. In fact, the only ones using force
[59:22.320 --> 59:24.680]  were federal law enforcement agents.
[59:24.680 --> 59:29.120]  I am standing at the front of the White House and you can see that the building behind me
[59:29.120 --> 59:35.120]  is still smoldering. The fire brigade has just arrived to try to extinguish that. They've
[59:35.120 --> 59:40.960]  been kept busy with a number of spot fires in this area. There was an impromptu bonfire
[59:40.960 --> 59:46.520]  on the street here behind me. There were a number of cars set alight, even a hotel.
[59:46.520 --> 59:52.360]  The front of our hotel was set alight. What was really terrifying scenes. This all happened
[59:52.360 --> 59:58.640]  in the minutes leading up to the 11 p.m. curfew. This is the first time that Washington, D.C.
[59:58.640 --> 1:00:04.240]  has had a curfew in place and you could really feel the tension rising between the protesters
[1:00:04.240 --> 1:00:06.840]  and the police in the minutes leading up to it.
[1:00:06.840 --> 1:00:13.640]  Portland is another clear example where federal agents use excessive and indiscriminate force
[1:00:13.640 --> 1:00:17.000]  to break up people gathered to peacefully protest.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:21.640]  If we had done nothing, what would have happened to the courthouse, Mr. Cuccinelli, in Portland?
[1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:23.680]  That courthouse wouldn't be there in any function.
[1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:28.560]  So I challenge anybody on the other side to say different things. If we hadn't intervened
[1:00:28.560 --> 1:00:35.240]  on the other side, this is a nine-minute John Bowne report. It's excellent. That's just the first three-and-a-half minutes.
[1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:40.400]  It's at band.video. You go to band.video, click the left-hand side, see three lines there.
[1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:43.680]  You click that left-hand side. It pulls down all the different sections. You'll see the
[1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:47.960]  John Bowne section there on the left. Right over there underneath, Paul Joseph Watson and
[1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:54.000]  David Eich and all the rest of them. You'll find the John Bowne reports right over there
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:58.040]  on the left-hand side. You just click on that and you can find
[1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:06.560]  his report dealing with all of this. And the new report, again, is titled by John Bowne.
[1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:13.600]  Antifa is not a myth. And it went up. Last night, it only has 14,000 views. It needs
[1:01:13.600 --> 1:01:19.520]  100,000 views. It's also on infowars.com. But can you believe that? They have hearings
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:23.560]  where they explain that it's not good to burn down the federal courthouse or hit officers
[1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:27.800]  in the head with hatchets or hammers? I mean, look, that's insane, folks. If I tried to
[1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:34.640]  assault a cop, a federal officer, a milkman, those don't exist anymore, a random person
[1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:39.120]  on the street, they can kill me. They have rights, too. That's insane. They don't want
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:43.200]  justice. They want to overthrow the whole system so that Leticia James is in charge
[1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:48.920]  of every state house and every federal courthouse to rule with tyranny. And then we will have
[1:01:48.920 --> 1:01:59.480]  a civil war.
[1:01:59.480 --> 1:02:24.560]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want. And you can, too, at

[1:02:47.440 --> 1:03:09.080]  today infowarstore.com.
[1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:14.320]  All right, I have been watching the Council on Fine Relations, the Atlantic Council and
[1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:21.800]  all the top shadow government, deep state groups say we're going to activate race riots
[1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:27.000]  as the smoke screen for our overthrow of local state and federal government. When Trump tries
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:31.920]  to block that, we're going to call it racist, and it'll be our cover to remove him under
[1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:38.240]  the 25th Amendment or under something else. Then we learned it was mainstream news that
[1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:43.440]  they were canvassing four years ago when Trump was first president elect almost four years
[1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:51.080]  ago. And then again, this year, the Pentagon on strategies to remove Trump. Now you don't
[1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:54.320]  just walk into the general's offices and say we want to remove the president. They go,
[1:03:54.320 --> 1:04:01.160]  if he doesn't leave, what are you going to do? Well, we want you to remove him. Well,
[1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:06.320]  what if it looks like he isn't going to leave? See, that's how they introduce it. Oh, we
[1:04:06.320 --> 1:04:15.520]  need to remove him because he's not leaving. They're introducing the idea. You understand?
[1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:20.880]  It's how they broach the subject. And by the way, they're in the CFR and now the Washington
[1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:26.560]  Post and everywhere else. So you've had Eric Holder, you've had Hillary, you've had Nancy
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:37.400]  Pelosi, you've had over a dozen Brennan, Clapper, Comey. They've all been in the news in the
[1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:43.360]  last month saying he's not going to leave office. We need to remove him. And if he challenges
[1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:48.280]  our mail in voting, that's election meddling. He must be removed. So if he challenges our
[1:04:48.280 --> 1:04:56.400]  illegal action to steal the election, that's grounds we are moved as well. And so they're
[1:04:56.400 --> 1:05:05.000]  even having discussions. Nadler and others brought this up last week for the attorney
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:12.040]  general. And they said, what are you going to do if Trump refuses to leave to him? He
[1:05:12.040 --> 1:05:16.680]  said, that's preposterous. That's not going to happen. Oh, sounds like Alex Jones and
[1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:21.720]  Roger Stone are writing your talking points. By the way, Roger Stone doesn't just come
[1:05:21.720 --> 1:05:25.960]  on this show and agree with me to agree. He disagrees. Sometimes with me, he knows I'm
[1:05:25.960 --> 1:05:29.720]  usually right. I'm just being honest. He's been right a few times when I've been wrong,
[1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:35.600]  but I'm right more than he is. He's a smart guy. We're rarely disagree, but we talk about
[1:05:35.600 --> 1:05:40.040]  a lot of subjects. So we disagree quite often. And by that, I mean, we may cover 100 topics
[1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:45.320]  that agree on those, but out of 200 topics, we might disagree on four or five. Roger agrees
[1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:48.960]  with me that they're going to try a coup again. They've already done it past behaviors, the
[1:05:48.960 --> 1:05:54.960]  most indicative future actions, past performances, indicative future performances. That's the
[1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:59.520]  number one indicator. And I mean, they're foaming at the mouth now with the narrative.
[1:05:59.520 --> 1:06:05.360]  It's not Russia gate. It's not Ukraine gate. It's not rape gate. It's Oh, he's a dictator.
[1:06:05.360 --> 1:06:09.560]  Oh, he's not going to leave. Oh, he's doing stuff to try to stay. Oh, we got to get rid
[1:06:09.560 --> 1:06:14.440]  of him. Oh, and then right after we saw that, I said, if you see the top brass, the joint
[1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:21.320]  chiefs, million others, the chairman, come out and put Trump down over something petty.
[1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:24.960]  Like I shouldn't have walked with him across the street to the church. What the hell does
[1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:31.080]  that mean? Or, you know, uh, we shouldn't put military on the streets to stop writing.
[1:06:31.080 --> 1:06:37.600]  The president's wrong. Secretary defense said that. I said to you weeks before I said, if
[1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:43.440]  the sec death and the chairman and other start shooting off their mouths against El Presidente,
[1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:48.480]  that means they're signaling to the big boys. The big powerful globalists sold us out that
[1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:52.720]  they're scared. They want to keep that $10 million job. They got coming when they leave
[1:06:52.720 --> 1:06:57.200]  office. They want to keep all those deals. They want to sell us out of the chai comms
[1:06:57.200 --> 1:07:01.560]  because they're wimps. They might have been tough back when they were in Vietnam or when
[1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:08.040]  they were green berets, but they ain't tough no more because they get a little thing in
[1:07:08.040 --> 1:07:15.320]  the mail. Hey, General Milley or whoever, we know about your mistress that lives a mile
[1:07:15.320 --> 1:07:21.400]  from your house. Oh, well, hey, guess what, Milley? We know about it too, buddy boy. And
[1:07:21.400 --> 1:07:25.640]  I'm going to burn down Oprah Winfrey politically and I'm going to burn all you down before
[1:07:25.640 --> 1:07:29.720]  I'm done. And I don't care what you do to me. I'll burn every one of you. So just go
[1:07:29.720 --> 1:07:34.960]  ahead and punch your button up and send some illegal team to kill me. I don't give a frickin
[1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:44.600]  hell because there are some people in this country that aren't cowardly scum like you.
[1:07:44.600 --> 1:07:54.840]  Oprah Winfrey is a pedophile. Oprah Winfrey likes girls, 12, 13, 14, 15 year olds. She
[1:07:54.840 --> 1:08:03.280]  hangs out with Jeffrey Epstein and with Harvey Weinstein and she's in a secret cult. It came
[1:08:03.280 --> 1:08:14.880]  out on the news that wants to depopulate Africa. That's why she was chosen to be the big face
[1:08:14.880 --> 1:08:21.120]  of black women in America to lead them into abortion and fatherless homes and death. And
[1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:26.680]  now she leads a Luciferian orphanage cult in Africa with kids just like Hillary does
[1:08:26.680 --> 1:08:32.320]  in Haiti, disappearing black children because I don't know what it is about black children.
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:38.880]  But if there's a menu of kids, Satanists more often than any choose black people as the
[1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:45.560]  menu item. Maybe that's because it's easier for them to grab them and sneak off with them.
[1:08:45.560 --> 1:09:00.480]  But let me just tell you something right now. That woman is an absolute demon from hell.
[1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:07.960]  There she is with John a God where they have sex with the children and boy, she likes to
[1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:18.920]  spend her time in those third world countries. Them little girls and it's well known. Imagine
[1:09:18.920 --> 1:09:25.760]  being a little 10 year old girl in Africa and some horrible orphanage and the door opens
[1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:31.120]  and in comes Oprah Winfrey. Why don't we show some of the video are sticking her tongue
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:38.280]  and Harvey Weinstein's ear suck it on his ears in public. She's sucking on that guy's
[1:09:38.280 --> 1:09:43.720]  dandruff covered ears. That's the thing with him is he's got this gross body. He's a hermaphrodite.
[1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:50.040]  He's got a vagina and a little shriveled thing and he makes these women come and he reportedly
[1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:54.960]  stinks real bad. So they're supposed to hand washing while he farts on them and folks, I'm
[1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:59.000]  not trying to be gross here. I want you to know who devil worshipers are. They all have
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:04.680]  their own little thing. He's more like a slimmer. He just likes to humiliate young 15 year
[1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:10.400]  old, 16 year old women and just be really gross and have them do really gross things
[1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:15.200]  I'm not going to say on air. But you can probably imagine what he wants women to do. You can
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:19.640]  probably imagine what an ugly slime bag wants to do to beautiful innocent women to steal
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:24.240]  their future and to humiliate them and to debase them. It's as close as you get to sacrifice
[1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:28.280]  them or breaking their nose. In fact, those women would probably rather get slapped around
[1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:35.000]  than to stick their face in the dirty, you know what, of Harvey Weinstein's big fat
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:44.040]  brown beaver. But I mean, that's what all these people are. Disgusting pieces of crap.
[1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:50.560]  They hate black people. They hate white people. They hate brown people. They hate children.
[1:10:50.560 --> 1:11:00.720]  They hate women. They hate everybody. And they got all these candy ass cowards with
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:05.880]  all their mansions and their money afraid to lose it all. Most of people in D.C. and
[1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:09.800]  L.A. aren't devil worshiping. Most people aren't making 15 year old girls clean their
[1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:16.280]  fat folds. Most people aren't sucking Harvey Weinstein's ears, but they all bow down to
[1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:23.720]  it. Let me bow down to you right now. Let me hand over some more young, beautiful women
[1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:30.360]  to use so you can defile them and rub your butt on them like you're marking your territory.
[1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:35.800]  But we're so close to Oprah Winfrey going to prison. I can't wait till she gets indicted
[1:11:35.800 --> 1:11:40.040]  and she's in that orange suit and she's going to get all the women she wants. I guess when
[1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:44.560]  she's in that female lockup, they're just not going to be 14 years old. Hell, Oprah
[1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:49.240]  will probably be happier than a pig. And you know what? Once she gets in that present,
[1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:56.000]  she's hooked into all of it. She runs trafficking reportedly out of everywhere. So hey, guess
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:02.720]  what? Gloves off, brass knuckles on. I don't run up white flags like the NRA when I'm under
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:08.000]  attack. I don't bow down to you because no matter what happens to me, every one of you
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:12.400]  devil worshiping slime bags is going down and you're going to go down in this life while
[1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:17.400]  you're still alive. And then God's going to cut you down in the next one and is going
[1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:22.800]  to break every spiritual bone in your body and smash you down to hell and throw you right
[1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:28.080]  into one of those garbage disposals we call a black hole. So I hope you enjoy the Phantom
[1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:36.880]  Zone because it's a real place and it's filled with people like you. I know you're scared
[1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:42.160]  just like those children are that you kidnapped, but you will fear God and you're already
[1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:46.960]  scared. So dance around and cause race war and tell us how whites are bad and how they
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:51.600]  got a leg up and we need to kill the whitey when you serve the real whiteies that want
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:56.960]  to kill everybody. The BBC is state-run media in the UK and they've come out with a detailed
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:13:03.720]  article that's linked to an info wars dot com saying you will have to have forced inoculations
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:09.520]  multiple times a year to be able to travel. Robots will scan you when you land. You will
[1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:14.120]  have a digital tattoo under your skin to be able to enter the country, but it's going
[1:13:14.120 --> 1:13:19.200]  to be so easy and so cool and so fun. The Microsoft website now officially has announced
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:24.040]  the digital tattoo. We exposed this six months ago. Bill Gates was funding it and they had
[1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:29.280]  hundreds of news articles attacking and saying it wasn't true. This is a tactic to use. First
[1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:33.240]  they announce it. We say it's a bad idea. They say that's crazy. We didn't do it. They
[1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:36.800]  introduced the idea to you. Then they come back and announce it again thinking you have
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:43.600]  no memory. This is a criminal takeover. This is the line in the sand. We must say no. We
[1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:49.480]  must expose the fraud of COVID-19. This entire house of evil is built on. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:13:49.480 --> 1:13:53.600]  Never surrendered a tyranny in full wars dot com. Another part of the great awakening
[1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:58.520]  that's taking place is people that haven't even been religious or Christian now see
[1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:03.240]  how evil is out in the open, how hundreds of churches have been burned in Europe and
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:08.960]  the U.S. Hundreds of Christian icons have been burned destroyed. Jesuses have had their
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:12.980]  heads cut off all over the country, all over the Philippines, all over Europe. Virgin
[1:14:12.980 --> 1:14:17.360]  Mary's are getting torn down. I mean crosses are being torn down. It's absolutely out of
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:22.960]  control but people now understand that evil was always real. It is spiritual and it was
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:28.440]  just waiting to make its move, building beneath the surface and now it's emerged. That's
[1:14:28.440 --> 1:14:32.120]  why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it. I'm praying for America.
[1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:36.440]  I'm praying for you and I know the power of prayer is real and God hears it. We need to
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:41.760]  come together and pray for an even greater awakening. Pray for Donald Trump to be protected.
[1:14:41.760 --> 1:14:46.720]  Pray for him to win a landslide and pray for the people under deception of the globalist
[1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:50.520]  to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom. God bless you all. Please pray for him for
[1:14:50.520 --> 1:15:18.000]  us as well.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.880]  I have a lot of enemies out there. This may be the last time you'll see me for a while.
[1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:27.600]  A lot of very, very rich enemies but they are not happy with what I'm doing. But I figure
[1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:32.320]  we have one chance to do it and no other president's going to do what I do. No other president
[1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:40.760]  would do a favorite nations, a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost. Nobody.
[1:15:40.760 --> 1:15:51.600]  And there are a lot of unhappy people and they're very rich people and they're very unhappy.
[1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:58.000]  President Trump fired the bat signal yesterday and he said they make all our prescription
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:01.840]  drugs in China. They're full of garbage. They're overpriced. There's all these middlemen. It's
[1:16:01.840 --> 1:16:08.080]  about a third the cost of prescription drugs. Americans pay more for prescription drugs
[1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:15.880]  than anyone in the world. And he went on to say we are not going to put up with that.
[1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:22.960]  We are not going to set up one side of deals against America. Now if you don't know about
[1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:31.280]  Oprah Winfrey being the black face of forced inoculations, AZT drugs given to children
[1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:35.680]  that don't even have HIV that ends up killing them, sterilization you name it that you don't
[1:16:35.680 --> 1:16:39.480]  know. And if you don't know about her and her pension for little girls, you're going
[1:16:39.480 --> 1:16:44.840]  to learn about it very soon. And by the way, folks, I don't bear false witness. I have
[1:16:44.840 --> 1:16:51.120]  it from the same sources that told me about Harvey Weinstein and many others of what
[1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:57.520]  Oprah Winfrey's into. And if you remember the Leibniz Post wrote a big attack piece
[1:16:57.520 --> 1:17:02.440]  about three years ago up for the Harvey Weinstein thing broke and I said these big Hollywood
[1:17:02.440 --> 1:17:09.080]  producers make women do X, Y and Z and I told you that they're going to use just the abuse
[1:17:09.080 --> 1:17:14.520]  of women as the cover for the actual drugging and kidnapping and murder of women and the
[1:17:14.520 --> 1:17:18.920]  branding of women and the torture of women and also little children as they're going
[1:17:18.920 --> 1:17:24.000]  to use the movement that's happened to women to make it about women only and not about
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:33.600]  all the children and the men that get ropes into all of this as well. Alex Jones's Harvey
[1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:40.760]  Weinstein comments are vile beyond belief. Remember the Huffington Post? Long before
[1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:46.880]  he got indicted, any of it. Oh, Alex Jones says Harvey Weinstein's tied to groups that
[1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:52.800]  brand women and groups that trick women to think they're just going to a bondage deal
[1:17:52.800 --> 1:17:59.400]  and then they never get released again. And of course it all came out. I was told this
[1:17:59.400 --> 1:18:06.480]  by people that are scared and who are not lying and who have proven it to me. Again,
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:19.000]  Hollywood tried to recruit me. I did not partake in any of it. And so it took them a while
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:27.280]  to go ahead and tell me they didn't want to work with me, which was fine. And then people
[1:18:27.280 --> 1:18:33.400]  said, well, Jones is for real. We'll tell Jones what's going on. And it was the same
[1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:36.920]  thing I was told by Benton K. Parton, three-star general, former head of Air Force Weapons
[1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:43.680]  Development. That's the real former head of Star Wars before you ever heard the name.
[1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:49.160]  And that's what I was told by Ted Gunnerson, the head of the FBI in LA. And that's what
[1:18:49.160 --> 1:18:53.720]  I sat around the coffee table when I was a little kid with my dad at FBI agent friends
[1:18:53.720 --> 1:18:58.360]  and others that would come over to the house and they were sitting around talking about
[1:18:58.360 --> 1:19:01.560]  the future. They're going to have a one world government and colored money and they'll have
[1:19:01.560 --> 1:19:05.560]  a microchip in you to buy and sell. And I'm like, I'm talking two, three, four, five years
[1:19:05.560 --> 1:19:09.480]  old. By the time I was like six, seven, those guys would come over to see my dad. Sometimes
[1:19:09.480 --> 1:19:11.920]  they wouldn't, you know, talk about that when the kids are really little, though they shoot
[1:19:11.920 --> 1:19:15.120]  their mouths off. But I was sitting right there like watching, listening to the whole
[1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:24.520]  thing. And so from that experience, the FBI agents and Dallas cops and some of those guys
[1:19:24.520 --> 1:19:27.680]  that my dad knew, you know, had worked in other things. Might have had a lot of those
[1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:32.880]  friends, even an anti-communist growing up in high school, you know, local activists
[1:19:32.880 --> 1:19:37.640]  and all those guys. And so the government knew all about this before, but now they've
[1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:40.760]  gotten rid of most of the good people and they've got all the bad guys in the command
[1:19:40.760 --> 1:19:46.920]  positions, basically. And we're screwed, folks. We're up against a Jacob and devil worshiper
[1:19:46.920 --> 1:19:56.480]  army that uses communism as the operating system, but they're all offshore and exempt.
[1:19:56.480 --> 1:20:03.640]  And we got Dr. Andrew Wakefield joining us with the huge developments on forced inoculation
[1:20:03.640 --> 1:20:08.640]  that are now all out in the open. In fact, guys, when you print me the Google articles,
[1:20:08.640 --> 1:20:13.280]  Google comes out with implantable digital tattoos, a premier vaccinated, and the Microsoft
[1:20:13.280 --> 1:20:17.160]  website where they say digital tattoos, a premier vaccinated. And we'll also show them,
[1:20:17.160 --> 1:20:26.000]  it's insane. Bill Gates doesn't want that. He never proposed that. And see, technically,
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:32.960]  it's Microsoft did it so they can say he didn't do it. That's how Snoop says we're lying.
[1:20:32.960 --> 1:20:39.920]  But we have the articles before this even became news that Bill Gates was doing it.
[1:20:39.920 --> 1:20:45.840]  And of course, we have the CEOs and all these guys and the head of the operations at MIT
[1:20:45.840 --> 1:20:50.960]  going, yeah, we met with Bill Gates. He just really wanted some type of digital tattoo
[1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:55.560]  that's like in the shot. We said, sir, the thing to do is put a bandage on them. And
[1:20:55.560 --> 1:20:58.720]  so it just sends in these little glass rods. They have like a rash, but then it's in their
[1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:03.160]  body forever. They can't get rid of it. We think that's the best plan, sir. And so that's
[1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:10.680]  what they're doing. But then imagine he's on record funding it at at least nine universities,
[1:21:10.680 --> 1:21:16.440]  rise in Texas, MIT and Massachusetts and others. It's on their website of Microsoft. There
[1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:21.400]  it is. And then they're all over the news. It's insane. He never did it. He's not involved.
[1:21:21.400 --> 1:21:26.320]  And why am I going to this one? I'm talking about Oprah Winfrey. That's seen more teenage
[1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:35.200]  girl tale than a toilet seat. Because it's all the same group who stayed for months off
[1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:41.920]  and on at Epstein's Pleasure Palace in Paris, Bill Gates, who stayed hundreds of times at
[1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:48.800]  his pervert palace seven story New York, Bill Gates, whose private plane flew into the big
[1:21:48.800 --> 1:21:56.760]  island by little St. John's Bill Gates, who flew into the little island, Bill Clinton.
[1:21:56.760 --> 1:22:01.480]  The secret service are on record. The groundskeepers are on record. The women are on record, but
[1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:07.920]  oh, it's fake news. And they have Bill Gates on with one of the richest families in the
[1:22:07.920 --> 1:22:16.120]  world, Anderson Cooper, who doesn't tell you that one of the biggest Robert Barron families
[1:22:16.120 --> 1:22:29.840]  to say, oh, I've never, never, never, never met Jeffrey Epstein. No, you just stayed at
[1:22:29.840 --> 1:22:33.360]  his house and gave him hundreds of millions of dollars and helped blackmail all these
[1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:40.200]  scientists. And so remember, you wake up to their whole pedophile ring and their corruption,
[1:22:40.200 --> 1:22:44.280]  their evil. And what's their answer? They released this genetically engineered virus
[1:22:44.280 --> 1:22:48.800]  they owns. They can make money off of it. They exaggerate the death toll 25 times what
[1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:55.080]  it was. They get caught lying at every level. Everything they do is a lie, a failure. Fauci
[1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:59.040]  literally threw the ball, the worst I've ever seen one throw. The crew was shown it a few
[1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:02.320]  weeks ago when he threw the first pitch out from from from up in the stands above the
[1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:05.840]  pitcher. I sent you guys the clips, you can roll that the background of Fauci throwing
[1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:13.160]  it from from from behind him. He literally throws it like 50 feet wrong into left field.
[1:23:13.160 --> 1:23:20.520]  And they cheer him when he does it. There it is. I mean, it's like 30, 40 feet. I mean,
[1:23:20.520 --> 1:23:27.280]  it's just and they cheered. Oh, incredible job. Everything you do is the biggest lie,
[1:23:27.280 --> 1:23:34.520]  the biggest fraud. Even the pitch is indicative and archetypal of that emblematic. I mean,
[1:23:34.520 --> 1:23:39.320]  it's it's on and they cheered. Incredible. Oh my God. I'm surprised he didn't throw it
[1:23:39.320 --> 1:23:43.800]  backwards. He's such a satanist. He probably threw the ball into the outfield.
[1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:56.040]  Let's go to one in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for holding. I sure can, sir.
[1:23:56.040 --> 1:24:02.360]  Thank you. Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you. It's a pleasure to be talking
[1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:09.240]  right now. It's an honor to talk to you, brother. I just want to plug in. I'm a truck
[1:24:09.240 --> 1:24:15.240]  driver and two before I have changed the way I drive. Me and my brothers that drive, there's
[1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:23.080]  a couple of us. We are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans. We used to be on Monster and Red Bull
[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:27.720]  and Rolla and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank
[1:24:27.720 --> 1:24:32.440]  you for that, man. Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long term high quality
[1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:36.600]  energy powder there is. So this this was designed on one of the top guys in the country. He didn't
[1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:39.960]  want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for
[1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:44.520]  this formulation just for the design of it. And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest
[1:24:44.520 --> 1:24:48.120]  energy out there. And you're saying that it's made your life better. So that means a lot to me.
[1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:55.880]  Thank you to all your truck drivers. We love you. Vicky Gibbs, 57 year old lesbian preacher
[1:24:55.880 --> 1:25:03.880]  in Houston went in with a cough, got intubated and then died. And as soon as I saw her face,
[1:25:03.880 --> 1:25:08.440]  as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch, it'll be innovation. We know what's going to happen.
[1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:15.480]  It's a blue city. Same story yet again. And they say her heart gave out. If you put somebody on a
[1:25:15.480 --> 1:25:20.280]  breathing tube of COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record when everyone you know before they
[1:25:20.280 --> 1:25:24.840]  go to the hospital and get killed. Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities in blue
[1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:30.440]  states? It's because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs and COVID-19 is causing an
[1:25:30.440 --> 1:25:36.040]  autoimmune response. And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on records saying,
[1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:42.120]  it will kill you. But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:47.560]  And the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading. Don't end up like Vicky
[1:25:47.560 --> 1:26:00.600]  Gibbs or everyone. As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.

[1:26:53.320 --> 1:26:55.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:07.320 --> 1:27:11.800]  Every morning at the mine, you could see him arrive. He stood six foot six and waiting
[1:27:11.800 --> 1:27:17.800]  245 kind of broad at his shoulder and narrowed the hip and everybody knew you didn't give no
[1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:34.120]  lift to Big John. Big John, Big John, Big Bad John, Big John. Nobody seemed to know where John
[1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:39.720]  called home. He just drifted into town and stayed all alone. He didn't say much. He kind of quiet
[1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:48.440]  and shy and if you spoke at all, you just said hi to Big John. Somebody said he came from New Orleans
[1:27:48.440 --> 1:27:54.040]  where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen and a crashing blow from a huge right hand
[1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:58.840]  sent a Louisiana fella to the promised land, Big John. All right, folks, we're back live.
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:05.160]  Let me do this. I'm going to read General Flynn's letter next segment ahead of Dr. Andrew Wakefield
[1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:10.120]  joining us. It's up on infowars.com. It's posted in the live article page today,
[1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:16.760]  headline Trump fires the bat signal, warns America live attempted coup is taking place.
[1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:21.320]  That's a paraphrase. We can actually pull the article up, please. General Flynn issues emergency
[1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:27.080]  warning. Communists are attempting to overthrow the United States. It gets into how it's a fight
[1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:33.560]  against good and evil and how this is it and how it's on. But the first thing I want to do is go
[1:28:33.560 --> 1:28:39.400]  to an excerpt the full 30 plus minute videos being posted info wars.com. We have archived it to band
[1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:44.440]  out video because they're undoubtedly going to bring it down from Facebook. And it's a child's voice,
[1:28:44.440 --> 1:28:48.680]  a very successful award winning film has been out for a few years. It's a fictional film,
[1:28:48.680 --> 1:28:54.040]  but a composite of real type things that they reported on happening out in Los Angeles. So
[1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:58.200]  it's kind of what they call historical fictions. What I'd call it a child's voice has now been
[1:28:58.200 --> 1:29:03.000]  silenced by Amazon. Because the subject of the establishment and child trafficking,
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:08.520]  whether it's the Vatican or whether it's John of God or whether it's the connections to Hillary
[1:29:08.520 --> 1:29:13.960]  and her foundation that's been caught red handed doing it. And the lady that was running at Laura
[1:29:13.960 --> 1:29:19.160]  Sillsby changed her name and now runs Amber Alert. You can't make this up. So he did a great job,
[1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:25.800]  John Paul Rice, I'd like to invite on the show of coming out in 30 something minutes and laying
[1:29:25.800 --> 1:29:31.160]  it out. I watched it all last night. I was sent it by one of our security people. And I was already
[1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:34.840]  aware of this man and I've already seen excerpts of the film. I should watch the whole thing.
[1:29:35.480 --> 1:29:41.960]  But that dovetails when I'm done playing a few minutes of this with Mariah Carey's sister,
[1:29:41.960 --> 1:29:49.480]  Sue's mom claiming ritual satanic abuse. And then the other siblings say, yes, it's true,
[1:29:49.480 --> 1:29:59.240]  but they won't talk about it. And what they describe is dead on, dead on from my research
[1:29:59.240 --> 1:30:06.600]  and like eyes wide shut and what they do. So this whole house of cards is coming down, ladies and
[1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:13.240]  gentlemen. Now let's go ahead and go to the filmmaker. He's been involved in a lot of big
[1:30:13.240 --> 1:30:18.440]  movies, a lot of big production versus an actor and as a producer, Hunger Games, the list goes on
[1:30:18.440 --> 1:30:25.320]  and on. Here's John Paul Rice talking about the fact that they've now censored his film. And so
[1:30:25.320 --> 1:30:29.960]  now he's going public about what's really going on. Here it is. The reason I wanted to talk to
[1:30:29.960 --> 1:30:36.680]  everybody here today is because over the last course of the last week or two, we have found out
[1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:41.880]  without notification that Amazon.com for which we have six of our movies on there,
[1:30:42.680 --> 1:30:48.760]  our film, a child's voice, which has been on there for over a year and a half in the UK,
[1:30:48.760 --> 1:30:56.040]  the United States and now 70 other countries was suddenly without notification removed entirely
[1:30:56.040 --> 1:31:02.680]  from their platform. They unpublished it and they made it not searchable in most of the sites.
[1:31:02.680 --> 1:31:06.680]  We've only tested a few outside of the United States, but the one in the United States, if you
[1:31:06.680 --> 1:31:11.240]  put in a child's voice in Amazon.com, you can't find it on the 1100 pages that they'll give you
[1:31:11.240 --> 1:31:16.280]  back on your searches. The only way that you can get it is through a direct link and we discovered
[1:31:16.280 --> 1:31:21.400]  this because the director's daughter had sent the links out to several of her friends when the
[1:31:21.400 --> 1:31:27.640]  Wayfair scandal broke, as well as the Maxwell files being released in the last 48 hours.
[1:31:28.280 --> 1:31:34.200]  And Amazon came back to us. They gave us a very standard corporate non-committal response that
[1:31:34.200 --> 1:31:38.440]  said we make a lot of changes. We do this and that and the other. We judge things based on
[1:31:38.440 --> 1:31:42.920]  performance, but they couldn't give us a very specific answer and we all know what the answer
[1:31:42.920 --> 1:31:50.120]  is. What our movie did before Epstein was known about in the public and before Maxwell was known
[1:31:50.120 --> 1:31:57.080]  about in the public is we found a network of pedophiles among a global network of people
[1:31:57.880 --> 1:32:03.720]  who were selling kids back and forth to each other, trading them like candy. It goes right
[1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:08.200]  in through Hollywood. If you look at the Daily Beast article, you'll see that Jeffrey Epstein had
[1:32:08.200 --> 1:32:13.320]  a pipeline right into Hollywood through Harvey Weinstein. That was last year. I've done a lot
[1:32:13.320 --> 1:32:19.080]  of deep dives and research into this and there is a very satanic element to it for which we
[1:32:19.080 --> 1:32:25.240]  incorporated it into our movie. Our movie is a feature film. It deals with two teens, one who's
[1:32:25.240 --> 1:32:30.200]  a homeless heroin addicted teen. Here's the voice of a child who had been killed at the beginning
[1:32:30.200 --> 1:32:35.560]  of the movie, calls out for his help and he goes on a mission to rescue a girl from these human
[1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:41.560]  traffickers. They come together and then they stand up to this network in a spirit of love
[1:32:41.560 --> 1:32:46.600]  and courage for all of these children. It's a very beautiful film. It's been well reviewed, well
[1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:52.520]  received, critically acclaimed by the people that have reviewed it and also many users by the thousands,
[1:32:52.520 --> 1:32:57.560]  by the tens of thousands, by the millions all over the world have seen this. So when we had all of
[1:32:57.560 --> 1:33:04.680]  this come up, we went viral with it on Twitter the other day and it exploded because we still have
[1:33:04.680 --> 1:33:10.040]  one platform left here in the United States and that's Vimeo.com on demand. What I would like
[1:33:10.040 --> 1:33:14.920]  everybody to do is more importantly, I don't need to get back on Amazon, I already know what they're
[1:33:14.920 --> 1:33:19.960]  going to do and they've got a stack of lawyers but we're looking for alternative platforms where we
[1:33:19.960 --> 1:33:26.200]  can release this movie and get it out to as many people as possible. Our movie is not a documentary,
[1:33:26.200 --> 1:33:31.800]  it's a feature film and we did this based on all the evidence and the facts that we had learned
[1:33:31.800 --> 1:33:35.720]  and incorporated into a story that you get involved through the character's journey.
[1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:42.760]  Their road to redemption is through love and this issue of human trafficking which many people
[1:33:42.760 --> 1:33:50.200]  are waking up to today for a variety of reasons is the issue that defines all of us in our time.
[1:33:50.760 --> 1:33:57.080]  The media corporations, the most powerful six corporations in the land, in the world for that
[1:33:57.080 --> 1:34:03.000]  matter are all implicated in human trafficking of kids and I would point to anybody who wants to
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:10.360]  know more about that to look at Project Veritas and the leak disclosure of off-air footage of
[1:34:10.360 --> 1:34:18.120]  Amy Robach from ABC News when she found out and was discussing in 2016 that they had everything
[1:34:18.120 --> 1:34:22.440]  from Virginia Guffrey, all of it. Everybody who was involved, they had all the evidence,
[1:34:22.440 --> 1:34:26.760]  their own lawyer said that when all is said and done, Jeffrey Epstein will go down as one of the
[1:34:26.760 --> 1:34:33.320]  most prolific pedophiles in all of history and they buried that story to have access to the royal
[1:34:33.320 --> 1:34:39.560]  family for which we now know Prince Andrew was implicated. They did not have any remorse for
[1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:46.200]  the victims in that video. This is a bigger problem because most people know in that world and the
[1:34:46.200 --> 1:34:52.040]  world that I come from in Hollywood that it is a hidden layer that everybody knows is there.
[1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:57.960]  When the Me Too movement started in 2017, I reached out to several of my female
[1:34:57.960 --> 1:35:03.480]  actress friends who were prominent in LA. You would know them by name. Many of them you would
[1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:09.480]  know by just their look because you go, oh, that was her in that movie or that movie. And I said,
[1:35:09.480 --> 1:35:16.680]  well, what about the children? What about the children? And the response was, we know, we know.
[1:35:16.680 --> 1:35:23.560]  But they were silent on it. Let's stop there. This guy is a really good guy. He's dead on,
[1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:28.120]  very well-spoken. John Paul Rice, big producer, big actor in his own right, a lot of big films.
[1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:32.840]  And he's made a lot of big films and they're now censoring him because this film has gone viral.
[1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:40.040]  And it's fiction, but it exposes the establishment. And so that's where we are now. And he goes into
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:45.080]  how the women go, no, no, we know about the kids. In fact, that's more than being abused than us.
[1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:53.000]  But we're not going to say anything. So they use women being abused as the cover for the children.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:57.800]  And it's absolutely evil and disgusting. So it's posted to Band-Aid video, went up last night.
[1:35:57.800 --> 1:36:03.320]  Producer of Voice of a Child speaks out for being censored by Amazon. See the video here.
[1:36:04.520 --> 1:36:08.600]  And I gave that headline last night when I was up here like seven. We probably didn't have a better
[1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:11.960]  headline, but like, you know, see the video before it gets censored. But there it is. A lot of it
[1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:16.440]  posted the front page. It's even more powerful. There's like 30 minutes left. You want to go see
[1:36:16.440 --> 1:36:20.760]  this video, you want to share this video, then you want to go while it's still available on Vimeo.
[1:36:20.760 --> 1:36:26.040]  Like I told my wife tonight, I said, I've seen clips of it's very powerful. Because it's the ghost
[1:36:26.040 --> 1:36:29.960]  of a child that's been sacrificed. Coming back and saying, you know, help, help the children.
[1:36:29.960 --> 1:36:33.400]  It really scares them. I'm going to go watch that film tonight and I'll give you a review.
[1:36:33.400 --> 1:36:37.240]  And by the way, I'm doing a special live Saturday show, special live Saturday show,
[1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:41.800]  special live Saturday show, three to five p.m. tomorrow with some big whistleblower guests from

[1:41:07.160 --> 1:41:11.880]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones your host. So Hollywood put a spell on us.
[1:41:12.920 --> 1:41:17.160]  But the spell is getting taken off of us. You know they got that movie get out.
[1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:20.920]  Came out a few years ago where the white girl leads the black guy off to the middle of the
[1:41:20.920 --> 1:41:26.280]  countryside because there's this ongoing Nazi cult that wants to transplant their Nazi brains
[1:41:27.080 --> 1:41:36.840]  into their black bodies. Well that doesn't go on. But what does go on is weird cults and weird
[1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:41.800]  groups trying to trick people black people to go to weird white people events. I know that goes on
[1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:47.560]  but also more often than not a cult groups and they will use young women to lure young men to
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:51.720]  these things to get them into the cult. That's what these cults use and they try to recruit police.
[1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:57.160]  They try to recruit judges. They try to recruit corporate leaders and that's all this is. Is
[1:41:57.160 --> 1:42:04.120]  it an initiation system to get people under your control. And so I read about Mariah Carey's sister.
[1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:11.160]  I spent when I saw this last night an hour and a half after my wife and kids went to bed.
[1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:19.400]  And it all rang exactly true. And it's upstate New York where there's that big coven by Nexium
[1:42:19.400 --> 1:42:26.200]  and where other certain occultist run operations where you hear about the spirit cooking with
[1:42:26.200 --> 1:42:30.040]  Podesta and we're going to have the kids in the pool for you their kids but they're there to serve
[1:42:30.040 --> 1:42:35.800]  you. And it's just man I'm telling you that area right up right north of New York man.
[1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:41.080]  You look at her sister right here and the other sisters and the other siblings go no it's true
[1:42:41.080 --> 1:42:48.440]  but we're not going to get involved in it. So that's the reality of this ladies and gentlemen.
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:55.880]  And it's a cult and it's peer pressure. And you got little kids like Eyes Wide Shut let's
[1:42:55.880 --> 1:43:02.760]  pull up some Eyes Wide Shut at a castle at a mansion right in downtown one of these historic
[1:43:02.760 --> 1:43:09.880]  buildings. And what came out in Ottawa Canada with that. Have you ever seen the Ottawa Parliament
[1:43:09.880 --> 1:43:18.360]  for the Canadian government. I mean it looks like a Harry Potter movie. Demons and gargoyles and
[1:43:18.360 --> 1:43:23.640]  bathomets all over totally insane. It turns out they do secret occult rituals inside of
[1:43:23.640 --> 1:43:30.280]  there a professor came out exposed and they had to admit it. The whole thing's a temple.
[1:43:33.400 --> 1:43:38.040]  And they're inside there carrying out the operation. Everybody's wearing masks.
[1:43:40.520 --> 1:43:44.440]  And they got the police chief there so what are you going to do when the local head of the FBI
[1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:51.800]  and the local head of the police department are there. And I've talked to some of these
[1:43:51.800 --> 1:43:59.000]  guys off record high level people. Some of them have interviewed but I won't say their names.
[1:44:02.520 --> 1:44:08.520]  And they said look I was married. I was in the FBI. I was 45 years old. I was an up and comer.
[1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:14.520]  I've done all these big busts. All these big cases. And then yeah I was cheating on my wife
[1:44:14.520 --> 1:44:20.440]  with this hot 24 year old or whatever. And the next day come to you and they say hey why don't
[1:44:20.440 --> 1:44:26.200]  you go to this party. And then you get there and then it's something corrupt and you say no
[1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:30.600]  and your career is over. You say yes your career goes to the top. It's all peer pressure. They
[1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:33.960]  get you drugged up before they do it. And then you're there and you're being set up.
[1:44:36.120 --> 1:44:41.160]  That's how the Vatican got taken over. That's how Penn State got taken over. It's how all of it.
[1:44:41.160 --> 1:44:47.160]  It's how they work. And they start you off with a chick that looks like she's 25 years old.
[1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:53.320]  All the hormones in the food now. Hell. They say hey that girl was 16. It's all right. We're
[1:44:53.320 --> 1:45:02.440]  going to take care of you. That's why I got so mad when they tried to plant that child porn on us
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:13.080]  last year in the Sandy Hook case. They wanted all the emails that we'd ever had about Sandy
[1:45:13.080 --> 1:45:17.640]  Hook and I was so busy not worrying about stuff. We were like saving emails going back like 10 years.
[1:45:17.640 --> 1:45:21.000]  Most companies get rid of it every six months. Like why are we saving all these unopened emails?
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:27.160]  But right after that I get sued. We get sent about a month later emails with hidden code in them
[1:45:28.120 --> 1:45:35.640]  with child porn. And we never opened it. The FBI came out and said that.
[1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:42.600]  But then this law firm run by Senators Blumenthal and Murphy. That's just
[1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:48.920]  it's a front group who've said they want me off the air. All of a sudden you know they call
[1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:52.760]  up the lawyers and they're like oh hey we found child porn on what you sent us.
[1:45:53.800 --> 1:45:57.080]  But it's okay. We'll talk to you about it. We're ready to work something out.
[1:45:59.160 --> 1:46:02.920]  I go check. I like it's some hidden stuff. I never opened it. Well that's not us.
[1:46:02.920 --> 1:46:08.600]  Somebody sent me an email saying F.U. for talking about Sandy Hook blah blah blah
[1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:14.120]  and then hidden in there is this. I said I'm gonna go and I'm exposed that.
[1:46:14.120 --> 1:46:18.680]  Then the phone starts ringing. The news asked me about the child porn. I sent the families.
[1:46:18.680 --> 1:46:22.360]  So I'm sending an email. I never opened it. It's hidden.
[1:46:25.400 --> 1:46:28.760]  And then I start getting asked did you send child porn to the families
[1:46:28.760 --> 1:46:33.800]  and I go on air and talk about it and expose it and then there are the headlines.
[1:46:33.800 --> 1:46:38.760]  Jones sends child porn to the families. That's a total lie. Of course the public
[1:46:38.760 --> 1:46:42.920]  understands that because they're sick of me. The whole system is whoever did that
[1:46:43.640 --> 1:46:49.000]  is so sick of me exposing what's going on in New Haven, Connecticut. What's going bones.
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:59.240]  The devil equals death. Death equals death. That they think my listeners are gonna think
[1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:05.480]  A. I've got child porn and B. I'm gonna send it to the families of Sandy Hook.
[1:47:05.480 --> 1:47:10.280]  But see they think you're that stupid or it's like a sick joke with these people.
[1:47:10.280 --> 1:47:19.720]  And so then I say whoever did this offer a million dollars to put their head on a pike
[1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:24.120]  and I meant politically to find who they are to get them. They then spin it and say that I'm
[1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:31.720]  saying those people did it. Well me thinks you protest too much like right out of Macbeth.
[1:47:31.720 --> 1:47:39.000]  All I know is they scanned those emails to find that hidden information. Why the hell would you
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:51.240]  do that? And then thought oh we found some child porn. Are you ready to come out against Trump now?
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:55.240]  Are you ready to come out for red flag laws now?
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:07.160]  And what's good is though 10 years ago people would have believed their lie and I wouldn't
[1:48:07.160 --> 1:48:11.640]  have rolled over to it but still people would believe it. People know that's not true
[1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:22.440]  because the system is out of gas. The system is dead in the water.
[1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:34.040]  You know I said I get the general Flynn's report. I'll do this. We'll have Dr. Wakefield on for
[1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:41.960]  pre-segments and then I'll read General Flynn's letter that's so powerful that I should have
[1:48:41.960 --> 1:48:45.960]  started the show with but the president coming out saying yeah the evil power elites coming after
[1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:54.360]  me I may not be here much longer. I mean he fired the bat signal. He fired the bat signal. He fired
[1:48:54.360 --> 1:49:00.680]  the bat signal. That's exactly what now he should expose who they are and they should all be absolutely
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:07.320]  annihilated politically. And all the information they've got on Gates and Fauci and Warren Buffett
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:14.360]  and Ted Turner and Hillary and Obama they want a war. Don't know how it's going to end
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:19.960]  but if you want to fight you better believe you've got one.
[1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:28.600]  I'm not scared of these people but I am scared that you're not going to realize how serious this is
[1:49:28.600 --> 1:49:31.880]  and sit there just thinking this is normal times we're in. This is not normal times.
[1:49:31.880 --> 1:49:35.320]  All right I didn't even plug yesterday. I didn't plug today. If I don't plug we won't be here.
[1:49:36.280 --> 1:49:40.360]  Please buy the products. They're amazing. We can't do the free shipping right now because
[1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:43.480]  it's just killing us. There's not enough money's coming in. When we do that we sell a lot. There's
[1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:48.760]  really not any profit in it to fund the operation. So we have 56% off in all the supplements.
[1:49:48.760 --> 1:49:56.280]  That's kind of in soon. We have the new liquid turmeric. That's a great support system and
[1:49:56.280 --> 1:50:01.400]  combo with the body's ultimate turmeric formula it's in to take under the tongue. Amazing. Super
[1:50:01.400 --> 1:50:06.680]  strong. Strong as we could find a top perm to make. So we can't say it's the strongest out there
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:10.520]  as who knows but it's as strong as we could get. We've got our ear to the ground and
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:15.240]  our nose to the grindstone and all the rest of it. So that's all there and we have the new
[1:50:16.360 --> 1:50:23.480]  fluoride free, enamel safe, super high quality, no additives, no fillers, charcoal, activated
[1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:28.840]  charcoal, toothpaste and mouthwash that folks are loving and it's available at info or store.com.
[1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:33.080]  I want to thank you all for your support and also call toll free, triple eight, two, five, three,
[1:50:33.080 --> 1:50:38.840]  three, one, three, nine, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. But as for me,
[1:50:38.840 --> 1:50:45.320]  give me liberty or give me death. The good news is I'm coming down fast but we're miles above
[1:50:45.320 --> 1:50:51.480]  the enemy and they are burning down right now. They are on fire with their own destruction.
[1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:57.160]  We're on fire for Christ. Our fire is eternal. Their fire is death as they turn into ashes.
[1:50:57.960 --> 1:51:02.440]  And I can just tell we should be thanking God every day that this is actually a good time.
[1:51:02.440 --> 1:51:06.360]  They locked the economy down. They started the race workers are desperate and I'm not putting
[1:51:06.360 --> 1:51:10.600]  perfume on a pig. I meant to start the show today with General Flynn's letter about Goodnebel
[1:51:10.600 --> 1:51:14.120]  and the fact that what are you thankful for? I was going to open the phones up to talk about
[1:51:14.120 --> 1:51:19.480]  what we're thankful for so we know what we're defending. But I'm thankful for all of you
[1:51:19.480 --> 1:51:23.560]  and I'm thankful for this crew and I'm thankful for my family and I'm thankful
[1:51:23.560 --> 1:51:28.840]  that I got lined up and got the Holy Spirit. I didn't fall to Satan because I came close to it.
[1:51:28.840 --> 1:51:34.840]  But let me tell you, Jesus reached down in there and got me by the throat pulled me up
[1:51:34.840 --> 1:51:42.600]  like a drowning man. It feels good. Whether you believe in evolution in the modern theory
[1:51:42.600 --> 1:51:47.560]  or not, the globalist controllers do and they constantly write about and talk about how
[1:51:47.560 --> 1:51:53.880]  they want to create a global crisis or a group of crises that force humans to, quote,
[1:51:53.880 --> 1:51:58.360]  evolve in a new, better way. Now, when you study how they actually want you to evolve,
[1:51:58.360 --> 1:52:03.400]  you believe in that. It is to stop having children emerge with silicon bodies and a post-human
[1:52:03.400 --> 1:52:09.000]  future. Talk about psychotic. Talk about creepy. Talk about crazy. But they need an event like
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:16.040]  COVID-19 to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose, over its breathing tubes to set
[1:52:16.040 --> 1:52:21.800]  the precedent for the forced inoculations, for the GMO, for the 5G, and for all the things that
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:27.320]  they admit will end our humanity as we know it. That's why this is so evil. Their whole agenda
[1:52:27.320 --> 1:52:34.040]  for a cashless society, global government, UN control, getting us all into debt, getting rid of
[1:52:34.040 --> 1:52:38.440]  local government, think about all the fast and some of the censorship, the surveillance.
[1:52:38.440 --> 1:52:47.400]  America and the world should have never been closed. It was all based on WHO, Bill
[1:52:47.400 --> 1:52:54.680]  Melinda Gates, Fauci NIH lives. But now here we are already into August and they're trying to keep
[1:52:54.680 --> 1:53:03.480]  our stores, our factories, our schools, our parks closed. It is outrageous. Well, we have
[1:53:03.480 --> 1:53:11.480]  launched a new big sale titled Reopen America Back to School Special 50 to 60% off all of our
[1:53:11.480 --> 1:53:18.200]  top sellers and double patriot points at infowarstore.com. And despite the fact that our ultimate
[1:53:18.200 --> 1:53:23.560]  turmeric formula bodies is selling out, we still have it at 50% off. But for a limited time,
[1:53:23.560 --> 1:53:29.880]  living defense, which is beyond probiotics, 50% off, vaso beats, amazing concentrated,
[1:53:29.880 --> 1:53:36.760]  beat extract of all of its benefits, selling out so 50% off and so much more at infowarstore.com
[1:53:36.760 --> 1:54:03.400]  and your purchase funds the infowar, a true 360 win. All right. Thank you for joining us here.
[1:54:03.400 --> 1:54:10.280]  We're down to the third hour. Dr. Andy J. Wakefield is our guest. And when you define the
[1:54:10.280 --> 1:54:14.920]  term maverick, he's the definition of it. And I know he doesn't want to be praised or anything,
[1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:19.000]  but they really tried to destroy him. Now, about half our stations don't carry this first five
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:23.320]  minutes, but they got him on early. So I want to waste time that we have here. But I'm going to
[1:54:23.320 --> 1:54:27.800]  kind of build him up a little bit when we start the next segment for all the folks, the millions,
[1:54:27.800 --> 1:54:31.160]  probably 2 million people that are going to be joining us. But give us a little prelude,
[1:54:31.160 --> 1:54:35.000]  Dr. Wakefield, since you were on with this a month ago, all the craziness that's happened
[1:54:35.880 --> 1:54:39.800]  of what's on your palette of paint here to illustrate for us what's happening.
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:47.000]  Well, Alex, the new films just come out and it's having a huge impact. It's a story about the 1986
[1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:54.200]  Act signed into law by Ronald Reagan, which gave liability protection to the vaccine manufacturers
[1:54:54.840 --> 1:54:59.320]  for deaths and injuries caused by their vaccines. And it's really a story, Alex,
[1:54:59.320 --> 1:55:03.320]  of what happens when you take a product or an industry outside of the constraints of the free
[1:55:03.320 --> 1:55:10.120]  market. You stop the free market operating to select for the best products, the safest products,
[1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:15.480]  you give them a free ride, and you pay a terrible, terrible price. And then you make that product
[1:55:15.480 --> 1:55:20.440]  mandatory. So you've got an unsafe product that is made mandatory. It's forced into American
[1:55:20.440 --> 1:55:27.480]  children. Suddenly you have the perfect business model. You have no liability. You have a compulsory
[1:55:27.480 --> 1:55:32.520]  market and mandatory market. All you can do is make a massive profit. That's what the pharmaceutical
[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:38.440]  industries have done. That's the future of the industry is vaccination. They have 300 new vaccines
[1:55:39.160 --> 1:55:47.880]  in the marketplace coming online. And that is even before the COVID-19 vaccine threat hit us. And so
[1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:55.080]  we live in a very, very precarious world where we are not protected anymore by the constraints
[1:55:55.080 --> 1:56:01.720]  of the free market. And of course, we'll recap that and go over all that. But it's so sinister
[1:56:01.720 --> 1:56:05.560]  with all the health problems and all the autism and all the autoimmune diseases and all the brain
[1:56:05.560 --> 1:56:11.320]  damage with 50-something vaccines. Now there's 300. And now we see all these medical doctors by the
[1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:17.880]  hundreds promoting hydroxychloroquine being shut down and big pharma merging with big tech and
[1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:25.080]  really a diabolical plan that makes the head spin. You know, it's what that illustrates. When you,
[1:56:25.080 --> 1:56:29.960]  first of all, and it started with people like you and me, it started with people who were labeled
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:35.640]  as anti-vaxxers or vaccine safety aware, or those who wanted better science, or those who were
[1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:40.280]  concerned for the well-being of children. And it spread. It spread to those who were selling
[1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:46.760]  nutritional supplements, those who advocated for natural health. And then it spread to the mainstream.
[1:56:46.760 --> 1:56:52.600]  Suddenly we're seeing the social media platforms, the mainstream media shutting down,
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:58.920]  mainstream doctors, doctors coming out to tell us about their clinical experience in the front line
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:05.400]  with the treatment of COVID-19. When you shut these people down, where does it end? It doesn't.
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:10.920]  And what it does is it tells the consumer, it tells people watching that the single objective
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:18.840]  is to focus on a vaccine and vaccine only narrative for the salvation of mankind
[1:57:19.400 --> 1:57:23.800]  to the betterment of who, to the betterment of the pharmaceutical industry and those people
[1:57:23.800 --> 1:57:28.760]  invested in it, like Bill Gates and Tony Fauci. And I know you don't like to speculate,
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:33.640]  but it's not speculation now. We'll talk about it later. Digital tattoos to prove you've had it,
[1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:39.080]  compulsory tracking. If you want to have a job or get on an airplane,
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:43.960]  a BBC says you'll have a digital chip, put in you to prove it. And then they announce it,
[1:57:43.960 --> 1:57:47.640]  but then we say, hey, that's a bad idea. They go, oh, that doesn't exist. So they try these
[1:57:47.640 --> 1:57:51.400]  psychological tactics. We're going to go to break in a moment. But what's the best website or best
[1:57:51.400 --> 1:58:01.960]  place for people to find the new film, 1986? Go to www.1986theeact.com. 1986theeact.com. Watch
[1:58:01.960 --> 1:58:06.760]  it there, stream it, download it and buy it. Order the DVD. It's coming your way.
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:11.320]  All right, folks, we're going to cover all of this when we come back. And I know as
[1:58:11.320 --> 1:58:15.000]  an audience, you've already done the research, you already know that Dr. Wakefield is telling the
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:18.360]  truth. You've experienced it with your own child having convulsions when they got vaccines,
[1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:22.760]  you know it. But remember, you've got to warn everybody now because people are more ready to
[1:58:22.760 --> 1:58:27.800]  hear the truth now than ever. So tell everyone you know right now to tune into Band-Aught Video,
[1:58:27.800 --> 1:58:32.200]  infowars.com, forward slash show, that local radio station or TV station you're watching
[1:58:32.200 --> 1:58:36.040]  and listening to, that's how we reach more people. I know I'm stating the obvious, but
[1:58:36.040 --> 1:58:41.240]  I've got to remember myself. At red lights, I roll on the window and say tune in. I do it at
[1:58:41.240 --> 1:58:44.920]  the grocery store. I do it when I'm with family. That's how we win this fight. They try to suppress
[1:58:44.920 --> 1:58:51.720]  us. We work that much harder. I have never been so concerned about what's going on. This is all
[1:58:51.720 --> 1:58:56.040]  martial law prepping, martial law training. And now they have activated the most criminal
[1:58:56.040 --> 1:59:00.920]  elements of the state. And Pelosi is bragging they're going to remove the president illegally
[1:59:00.920 --> 1:59:06.200]  with COG. You cannot remove the president with COG. You can't remove the president, 25th Amendment
[1:59:06.200 --> 1:59:09.960]  or impeachment. But they're saying they're going to do it. Ladies and gentlemen, they are putting
[1:59:09.960 --> 1:59:14.760]  this in every newspaper in the country and legitimizing the fact that if he can test the
[1:59:14.760 --> 1:59:19.320]  election in any way, when they say by default they are, that they're going to pull this. This is
[1:59:19.320 --> 1:59:24.680]  maximum, maximum alert. This is emergency alert. Yes, they've censored the Patriots off most of
[1:59:24.680 --> 1:59:28.040]  the internet, but Band-Aught Video is still there. The radio show is still there. And yes,
[1:59:28.040 --> 1:59:32.040]  we're getting about five times the traffic we were getting before the ban to the actual sites.
[1:59:32.040 --> 1:59:37.240]  But we need to get this message to other people outside of our audience. So tell everyone now
[1:59:37.240 --> 1:59:42.120]  about the martial law plan and the plan to get rid of Trump. It's all posted at Band-Aught Video.
[1:59:42.120 --> 1:59:58.200]  Please, we can defeat these people if you take action. You are the answer. Please, please, please.
[1:59:58.200 --> 2:00:14.280]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:14.280 --> 2:00:25.880]  How do we navigate this increasingly precarious world in which we live?
[2:00:26.760 --> 2:00:30.680]  In order to understand where we're going, we need to understand where we've come from.
[2:00:31.800 --> 2:00:36.520]  In order to understand where we've come from, you need to watch 1986, the end.
[2:00:36.520 --> 2:00:45.400]  It is the story of one of the most powerful forces in the universe, and that is maternal
[2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:52.920]  intuition. Okay, okay. No, no. This is not half-time entertainment. We've got work to do.
[2:00:52.920 --> 2:01:03.080]  This is a force that has evolved in our species over thousands and thousands of years. It is far
[2:01:03.080 --> 2:01:11.000]  more powerful than anything else that man might have contrived. It is the reason that we are here
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:19.320]  on this planet right now. And if we listen to it, it will be the reason why we are here in a thousand
[2:01:19.320 --> 2:01:29.800]  years' time. Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and Dr. Andrew Wakefield is our guest here
[2:01:29.800 --> 2:01:34.680]  for the rest of the hour. Now, I'm not going to go over his whole background, but he produced
[2:01:34.680 --> 2:01:38.600]  vaxed from cover-up to catastrophe. They tried to censor to bloop in their face.
[2:01:39.320 --> 2:01:44.440]  Now, they've put out 1986, the act. It just comes out today. I intend, again, this weekend,
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:53.080]  to watch it with my wife, 1986thiac.com. You have to understand, big pharma has merged with big tech.
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:58.120]  Hundreds of prominent doctors we know of. We're getting emails every day from new doctors. Some
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:02:03.960]  of the heads of virology at universities, the heads of, you know, whole divisions at hospitals
[2:02:04.600 --> 2:02:10.760]  are coming out and saying hydroxychloroquine, when taken with zinc, 100% recovery, 99% recovery.
[2:02:12.200 --> 2:02:17.160]  They're getting called up before review board. State Senator in Minnesota, who's well loved
[2:02:17.160 --> 2:02:21.080]  and a major award-winning medical doctor, he pointed this out and also pointed out that the
[2:02:21.080 --> 2:02:28.280]  death rate's like 0.037, way lower than flu. So why is it, oh, he's been called up for review.
[2:02:28.280 --> 2:02:32.120]  Well, Dr. Wakefield doesn't want to talk about himself. He wants to talk about the future. But
[2:02:32.120 --> 2:02:39.000]  20 years ago or 18 years ago, whenever it was, he was all over the news that he falsified the
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:44.280]  reports. He admits he's a fraud. There's no connection to gut and autism. Well, today,
[2:02:44.280 --> 2:02:48.280]  we know hundreds of studies later, he was right. He never said he falsified anything.
[2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:55.160]  He never said he was a fraud. And he wasn't. He was a trailblazer, a maverick. But see,
[2:02:55.160 --> 2:02:59.240]  I've experienced that. It's not about whining. It's about listeners learning how bad it is.
[2:02:59.240 --> 2:03:04.920]  They go on the news and say, Jones said in court, he's a fake and an actor and none of
[2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:11.640]  its real. Where's the transcript? Where's the clip? It's not true. It's a lie. They were showing me
[2:03:11.640 --> 2:03:17.640]  in a Joker outfit 15 years ago during my divorce proceedings in a custody battle, yelling and
[2:03:17.640 --> 2:03:23.240]  screaming about stuff. And my lawyer said, when Jack Nicholson plays the Joker, he's not really
[2:03:23.240 --> 2:03:28.280]  the Joker. I was being an actor there as a joke, but it wasn't my mainline persona who I am.
[2:03:29.560 --> 2:03:32.840]  So they put him through hell. They took his medical license. He got it back. All that. The
[2:03:32.840 --> 2:03:38.360]  point is, is that it was all a hoax. And they now admit it was a hoax. And so the fact that he
[2:03:39.080 --> 2:03:44.520]  went through the fire, persevered, and is now one of the main leaders, if not the leader,
[2:03:44.520 --> 2:03:51.320]  of exposing this threat to all of our futures by the exempt from liability global big pharma system
[2:03:51.320 --> 2:03:55.800]  is really a testament of victory. And so Maverick's a great word for Dr. Wakefield,
[2:03:55.800 --> 2:04:01.000]  but a better word is the Phoenix. And so we appreciate you. We got six minutes to break.
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:05.480]  We've got the rest of the hour. Let's get into what you were just starting to get to for some
[2:04:05.480 --> 2:04:11.000]  stages that joined us. How big this is and what's coming and the shackling of the medical community
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:20.840]  that started with you? I think that this, the film is about 1986, the act. It's about the law
[2:04:20.840 --> 2:04:27.400]  signed by Ronald Reagan, which gave the industry liability protection. I believe Alex, this
[2:04:27.400 --> 2:04:35.320]  law is at the heart of the problems we face globally with vaccination today, which are immense.
[2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:41.720]  It is a topic of discussion around every dinner table, every breakfast table in every family in
[2:04:41.720 --> 2:04:47.480]  all over the world. It is this single issue of what do we do? There's so much conflicting evidence,
[2:04:47.480 --> 2:04:52.600]  so much conflicting information. We see the experts on television and then we see other people
[2:04:52.600 --> 2:04:57.960]  saying, no, this isn't true. And then we see the damaged children. People are very, very confused.
[2:04:57.960 --> 2:05:04.440]  And what happened with this act when it gave the industry liability protection for a mandated
[2:05:04.440 --> 2:05:11.800]  product? And then the government agencies that were responsible for protecting American children
[2:05:11.800 --> 2:05:19.880]  conspired with the industry to destroy, to sabotage those things that have been put in place to
[2:05:19.880 --> 2:05:24.360]  protect the American people from dangerous drugs. And who was there at the time, Fauci, the very same
[2:05:24.360 --> 2:05:30.760]  cast of characters? Ben F. threw out absolutely an extraordinary to see him. He keeps cropping up
[2:05:30.760 --> 2:05:38.360]  when anything bad's going down. There's Tony Fauci. And what it did is to make the industry so rich,
[2:05:38.920 --> 2:05:44.280]  so rich that they could buy governments worldwide. They could buy policy worldwide. They could buy
[2:05:44.280 --> 2:05:49.720]  the media worldwide. And they could buy doctors and medical training worldwide. That's what they
[2:05:49.720 --> 2:05:56.040]  could buy. But Alex is one thing they couldn't buy. And that is people like you. They could not buy
[2:05:56.040 --> 2:06:02.520]  the sold of the American people. They could not buy. If you saw in Berlin just last week, 1.3
[2:06:02.520 --> 2:06:08.280]  million people in the streets protesting, no masks saying, we've had enough of this lockdown.
[2:06:08.280 --> 2:06:13.480]  We've had enough of this BS. We are not going to put up with this any longer. We want natural
[2:06:13.480 --> 2:06:18.440]  immunity. We don't want vaccine immunity. That's resistance. And that is what is happening now.
[2:06:18.440 --> 2:06:21.880]  And that is what Pharma cannot and will never be able to buy.
[2:06:21.880 --> 2:06:28.200]  It's beautiful what you're saying. And it's so true. And I'm going to play this later,
[2:06:28.200 --> 2:06:32.520]  but I'm sure you're aware and you've seen, we've talked about it, the two-day conference they had
[2:06:32.520 --> 2:06:40.840]  in Switzerland on the 2nd and 3rd of December last year in 2019 with the head of the vaccine
[2:06:40.840 --> 2:06:45.800]  program saying, we don't test. We're just told by foundations what to do. The doctors, the front
[2:06:45.800 --> 2:06:51.000]  lines wobbly. They've got sick people. This is collapsing. Meanwhile, here comes the whole COVID
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:57.240]  thing. I mean, that is so huge to even have the bureaucrats saying, we don't know what's going on.
[2:06:57.240 --> 2:06:59.560]  It shows that it's not even them. It's a group above it.
[2:07:02.120 --> 2:07:06.360]  And the other thing about that meeting is it was really in large part to deal with the growing
[2:07:06.360 --> 2:07:11.960]  thread of people who question vaccine safety. How do we control this? How do we contain it?
[2:07:11.960 --> 2:07:16.920]  What can we learn from these people who are spreading their message so effectively? It's
[2:07:16.920 --> 2:07:23.080]  spreading so effectively because it's true, because it's real, because it's happening every day.
[2:07:23.080 --> 2:07:31.000]  We're not sitting in plush hotel rooms conspiring to produce some narrative that suits our profiteering.
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:36.680]  It's not that at all. It is the fact that we are dealing at the ground level at the cold face
[2:07:36.680 --> 2:07:41.240]  with injury upon injury upon injury. There is another way, a better way of earning a living
[2:07:41.240 --> 2:07:46.840]  than doing this, Alex, but for that life of me, I'm not going to walk away from it. Well, there is
[2:07:46.840 --> 2:07:51.160]  so much damage being done. Now, I understand that footage of the million plus people that
[2:07:51.160 --> 2:07:57.080]  marched in Berlin. Let me raise this point to you. Obviously, the vaccines are damaging,
[2:07:57.080 --> 2:08:01.480]  autoimmune response, all the rest of it, it's coming out. So they double down and just say,
[2:08:01.480 --> 2:08:05.560]  okay, we're taking all of society over. That's going to blow up bigger. I mean,
[2:08:05.560 --> 2:08:09.640]  gut level, that's what I think. I think this is going to force a massive awakening. It already is.
[2:08:09.640 --> 2:08:17.640]  Are you seeing the same thing I'm seeing? Exactly. It's fascinating to see how this paradox where
[2:08:18.920 --> 2:08:23.400]  vaccination policy as a public health policy should depend entirely on the public,
[2:08:23.400 --> 2:08:29.560]  on the consumer's confidence in the policymaker. When that's gone, when that confidence is gone,
[2:08:29.560 --> 2:08:35.160]  when the hearts and minds of the public are lost, what you have left is false. And that is mandatory
[2:08:35.160 --> 2:08:41.400]  vaccination, no school, no private school, no public school, no home school, no medical exemptions.
[2:08:41.400 --> 2:08:47.720]  Doctors and scientists who give these exemptions or advocate for them are pursued and delicensed
[2:08:47.720 --> 2:08:52.600]  when you start taking children away from their parents. And then when you start to have this
[2:08:53.160 --> 2:08:59.880]  global initiative of chipping, micro chipping and vaccine passports, and you can't live in
[2:08:59.880 --> 2:09:05.400]  society, according to Bill Gates, without being fully compliant with the vaccination policy,
[2:09:06.120 --> 2:09:11.800]  then you are dealing with force. And all you've got is force. And force, Alex, as you know,
[2:09:11.800 --> 2:09:17.640]  is a road to nowhere. It is going to fail. And it's just a matter of time. And that protest in
[2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:23.400]  Berlin was one of many and is the writing on the wall. They wonder why they're losing. They're
[2:09:23.400 --> 2:09:28.600]  losing because they are wrong. That's right. The studies show that they're all in their own little
[2:09:28.600 --> 2:09:33.000]  bubble, but now Gates and Fauci admit they're not in the bubble and they admit that people really
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:39.080]  hate them and are calling them Joseph Mingala. Dr. Gates and Dr. Fauci, of course Gates is no doctor,
[2:09:39.640 --> 2:09:43.960]  and they're having to fight the real doctors around the world telling the truth. Stay with us.
[2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:49.640]  A lot of you are probably already very familiar with these terms about to introduce,
[2:09:49.640 --> 2:09:57.320]  but some folks are. So for those that aren't, here they are. Activated charcoal. And then another term,
[2:09:57.320 --> 2:10:06.840]  enamel safe. Activated charcoal is the fastest growing type of toothpaste for a good reason.
[2:10:06.840 --> 2:10:11.320]  It really, really works. Well, we've come up with the best activated charcoal toothpaste with no
[2:10:11.320 --> 2:10:15.640]  fillers, the cleanest type, the highest quality with a bunch of high quality and central oils and
[2:10:15.640 --> 2:10:21.080]  other ingredients known and documented to do amazing things for your oral hygiene and your
[2:10:21.080 --> 2:10:25.560]  overall health in your mouth that's so critical and it makes your teeth look really white and
[2:10:25.560 --> 2:10:30.120]  really, really clean and it's good for your gums. But on top of that, it doesn't have any ingredients
[2:10:30.120 --> 2:10:34.920]  that are known to hurt enamel. I've gone out before and gotten toothpaste that really made my teeth
[2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:41.720]  clean, but eroded enamel of the top. So I got into really safe, healthy types of toothpaste and that's
[2:10:41.720 --> 2:10:50.280]  what this is. It's available at infowarstore.com. Introducing InfoWarsLife Pure Turmeric Extract.
[2:10:50.280 --> 2:10:57.240]  This is taken under the tongue. It is pure turmeric. It goes together very well with our
[2:10:57.240 --> 2:11:02.920]  body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:08.520]  and intestines. This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also
[2:11:08.520 --> 2:11:13.960]  is then absorbed by the stomach. So it's more of an intense delivery system. The two formulas are
[2:11:13.960 --> 2:11:18.520]  different, but both are concentrated and our first product got rave reviews. We've now been testing
[2:11:18.520 --> 2:11:23.480]  this out for several months. Some of our staff like it more than bodies. Some like bodies better.
[2:11:23.480 --> 2:11:27.560]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:33.160]  and they fund the InfoWars. So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively at infowarstore.com

[2:11:45.400 --> 2:11:50.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:50.840 --> 2:12:17.320]  All right, Dr. Andrew Wakefield is our guest. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Remember, info wars is kind
[2:12:17.320 --> 2:12:22.920]  of a major mothership promoting all these other great people. Andrew Wakefield has his own big
[2:12:22.920 --> 2:12:26.680]  network. He doesn't need us as essential, but we help those great workings doing that's going to
[2:12:26.680 --> 2:12:30.680]  save lives. But for a lot of filmmakers and a lot of researchers, a lot of people, this is all they've
[2:12:30.680 --> 2:12:35.880]  got, especially now with the internet, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon banning so much. That's why we
[2:12:35.880 --> 2:12:43.080]  got banned.video with now hundreds of videos of scientists, epidemiologists, virologists, hospital
[2:12:43.080 --> 2:12:50.440]  heads, you know, Rockefeller University virologist head, and they're being censored
[2:12:51.400 --> 2:12:57.640]  for putting out main line stuff. Meanwhile, Fauci said we'd have a 4% death rate. It's
[2:12:59.560 --> 2:13:06.680] .037. I was seeing today. This is insane. This is absolutely insane. It all goes together
[2:13:06.680 --> 2:13:13.640]  with everything Fauci says is a lie. Everything he put out about HIV wasn't true. And he's like
[2:13:13.640 --> 2:13:17.480]  the devil appears in this cloud of smoke, you know, and these movies are from the devil. Every
[2:13:17.480 --> 2:13:24.280]  time something bad's happening, Fauci just appears out of this column of smoke and he can't even throw
[2:13:24.280 --> 2:13:30.600]  the pitch at the baseball game. I've seen people miss the mound. Okay. He throws it like 40 feet
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:38.600]  to left field and they cheer. So he's a puppet, obviously, but who are the interests?
[2:13:38.600 --> 2:13:45.240]  Dr. Andrew Wakesfield, the maker of the new film, 1986, the act.com. It just came out today that
[2:13:45.240 --> 2:13:50.200]  it's vital for folks to see who's the spider at the center of the web because you watch, as you said,
[2:13:50.200 --> 2:13:55.080]  them counter at the UN seven, eight months ago, going, our doctors are wobbly. People are getting
[2:13:55.080 --> 2:13:59.560]  sick. People are dying. We can't cover this up. We don't do any testing. That was them figuring
[2:13:59.560 --> 2:14:04.040]  out how to cover it up. They're being reasonable. Like make it work. Make it be transparent. That's
[2:14:04.040 --> 2:14:08.920]  what you're saying. Validating. But then who's, I mean, we know who it is, but you're the expert.
[2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:14.120]  Who's the spider behind it? Well, it's interesting. First of all, Alex, you're wrong. We do need you.
[2:14:14.120 --> 2:14:20.840]  Okay. We, we need Alex Jones and we need info wars. So that's, you know, in these,
[2:14:20.840 --> 2:14:26.360]  in these lean times, filmmakers like me depend on people like you. So thank you very much. Thank
[2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:33.240]  you. And who is at the center of this? This is, it's a very good question. It's not something
[2:14:33.240 --> 2:14:38.760]  that I've been pursuing. You know, I, you could speculate that about that for a long time. It
[2:14:38.760 --> 2:14:44.200]  is astonishing to me, absolutely astonishing that a man with no qualifications whatsoever, purely
[2:14:44.200 --> 2:14:51.400]  by virtue of his wealth is able to detect, dictate global vaccination policy, global health policy,
[2:14:51.400 --> 2:14:56.920]  and personal choice. That is astonishing. And I'm, but every time I see him on CNN, I,
[2:14:56.920 --> 2:15:01.960]  how much did it cost to get him there to be able to say what he's saying? It is utterly.
[2:15:03.320 --> 2:15:09.080]  That's not your speculation. He underwrites the Guardian, the BBC, CNN, MSNBC, obviously
[2:15:09.080 --> 2:15:14.680]  Microsoft NBC. He underwrites ABC. It'll say at the end, a lot of shows underwritten. I saw a show
[2:15:14.680 --> 2:15:21.720]  attacking me on a fiction show on ABC and it was underwritten by him.
[2:15:23.320 --> 2:15:28.520]  Yeah. No, he seems to exert a huge amount of influence simply by virtue of the amount of money
[2:15:28.520 --> 2:15:32.680]  that he has. Well, I just point something out to Alex. It's very interesting. I don't know whether
[2:15:32.680 --> 2:15:38.200]  you've detected this, but it's a kind of shift in the, in the mainstream media. And this is a story
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:47.480]  from zero hedge the other day. Red flags saw as big farmer will be exempt from COVID-19 vaccine
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:52.600]  liability. Yes, I saw that report. Really interesting. And then the American thinker,
[2:15:52.600 --> 2:15:58.600]  the CDC confesses to lying about COVID-19 death numbers. So there is a spectator in England
[2:15:58.600 --> 2:16:03.960]  saying, hang on, the numbers are crazy. Just like you referred to Fauci saying, this number of people
[2:16:03.960 --> 2:16:10.360]  died. It's a tiny fraction. The American people, the British people believe that their population
[2:16:10.360 --> 2:16:15.400]  has been literally decimated. In major polls, they believe 30 million Americans have died.
[2:16:16.120 --> 2:16:21.400]  That's right. When it's a tiny fraction of that and no greater, as you pointed out, many others
[2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:26.760]  from the seasonal flu in many cases. So people are getting a very, very distorted
[2:16:27.880 --> 2:16:32.360]  statistical picture of what's going on. But something is happening. Even CBS News had gates
[2:16:32.360 --> 2:16:37.560]  on it goes 100% of the people getting the strong vaccine gets sick, 20% hospitalized,
[2:16:37.560 --> 2:16:43.400]  80% the other vaccine and Gates didn't know what to say. Yeah. And he fell apart in that,
[2:16:43.400 --> 2:16:48.200]  in that discussion about the adverse reactions of vaccines and the FDA, he just completely fell
[2:16:48.200 --> 2:16:54.920]  apart. And it's interesting to see that now as the polls emerge over time, longitudinally,
[2:16:54.920 --> 2:17:00.280]  fewer and fewer people are willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine to the point where it's now
[2:17:00.280 --> 2:17:06.280]  what over 50% of people are saying no. Thank you very much. 57% say absolutely not.
[2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:11.400]  So we're moving to a situation where people are becoming more and more
[2:17:11.400 --> 2:17:16.360]  skeptical. And you pointed this out that this issue has actually bought more attention, focused
[2:17:16.360 --> 2:17:23.800]  more attention on vaccine skepticism and scientific skepticism than ever before. And in the face of
[2:17:23.800 --> 2:17:27.880]  that, we've got people like Forbes telling us, we shouldn't do our own research. Do not do your
[2:17:27.880 --> 2:17:32.280]  own research. Stop it. Stop it. It's dangerous. Leave it to the experts. Leave it to the man
[2:17:32.280 --> 2:17:37.320]  in the white coat. No. And the whole point of the film is that it's a mother's journey into
[2:17:37.320 --> 2:17:42.680]  that research. People have said, oh, your film is anti science. It differs to the mother's intuition.
[2:17:43.320 --> 2:17:47.800]  That is a very, very powerful thought. But that intuition, that intuition does not say to her,
[2:17:48.440 --> 2:17:52.600]  do not vaccinate. It says to her, there is an issue here. There is something going on
[2:17:52.600 --> 2:17:56.600]  that I need to get to the bottom of our and I'm going to analyze the science. I'm going to read
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:02.040]  the science. I'm going to access the legal cases. I am going to pull this apart until I can come to
[2:18:02.040 --> 2:18:07.320]  a conclusion. If it had simply said, oh, this woman's intuition said, don't vaccinate. But it
[2:18:07.320 --> 2:18:12.440]  turns out after your groundbreaking research, what is 20 years ago, the current middle date,
[2:18:12.440 --> 2:18:17.960]  Gates then funds, last time I saw $4 billion into gut vaccine research. What's he spending $4
[2:18:17.960 --> 2:18:23.320]  billion on that last time I saw? I know, I don't know. That's a new one on me. That's very, very
[2:18:23.320 --> 2:18:27.240]  interesting. Oh, no, guys, pull it up for him. Bill Gates invest heavily in gut flora research.
[2:18:27.240 --> 2:18:32.120]  Oh, he's heavy into that. Oh, he's huge. Oh, good, good, good. Well, he's learning,
[2:18:32.120 --> 2:18:36.920]  maybe a little too late. I think he wants to make money off of, off of, off what he's already
[2:18:36.920 --> 2:18:41.480]  caused. That's what I think. Yes, I think that what they're doing is they're realizing the validity
[2:18:41.480 --> 2:18:46.040]  of the work that was done way back then. And they're starting to capitalize on it. So they've
[2:18:46.040 --> 2:18:51.720]  got people looking at new markets. And this is a really a big new market. The sadness, Alex, is
[2:18:51.720 --> 2:18:57.320]  if the work had been allowed to continue at a natural pace early on, we would have had so many
[2:18:57.320 --> 2:19:05.880]  more answers today. So many fewer sick children as a consequence. There it is, microbiome research
[2:19:05.880 --> 2:19:10.440]  gets the Gates bomb. And that's only one of them. The last number I saw was like $4 billion he'd
[2:19:10.440 --> 2:19:14.280]  given. That's all I do is read this. I'm not a doctor like you, but I'm obsessed with it. And
[2:19:14.280 --> 2:19:17.800]  here's what happened to me. I already knew a lot of this. I interviewed you and stuff. But I go on
[2:19:17.800 --> 2:19:23.320]  vacation. And I go to the pool and like a third of the boys can't talk. And I go, what happened to
[2:19:23.320 --> 2:19:27.320]  your son? They go, well, at 18 months, he got the third round had a convulsion never talked again.
[2:19:27.880 --> 2:19:31.720]  And the kids for seven years old were in diapers at the pool. And then there's like sometimes I'm
[2:19:31.720 --> 2:19:36.680]  sometimes I'm in a pool with like 40 people. And there's like six boys that are in that are autistic
[2:19:36.680 --> 2:19:42.200]  going, you know, yelling, screaming. I've got Mike judge, I'm friends with him, his son's autistic.
[2:19:42.200 --> 2:19:46.200]  I mean, I just I take my kids to movie theaters. Sometimes I can't watch the film because there's
[2:19:46.200 --> 2:19:50.440]  so much screaming and yelling. I'm not against the autistic kids. I love them. But man, when I was a
[2:19:50.440 --> 2:19:55.240]  kid, you didn't have about a 50 kids in a movie theater, 14 of them screaming like they were
[2:19:55.240 --> 2:20:01.000]  dying. I mean, this is bad. Yeah, one in 10,000 children, you know, when I was at medical school,
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:05.400]  we weren't even taught about it. It was so rare. I just meant I know that, yeah, I know they say
[2:20:05.400 --> 2:20:09.960]  it was one in 30,000 and now it's one in 80 or whatever. I go to the movies, I go to the mall.
[2:20:11.080 --> 2:20:14.920]  And the kids who aren't totally autistic still look like somebody beat them up inside the head
[2:20:14.920 --> 2:20:19.320]  with a baseball bat. And so all I'm saying is, is that these kids don't look like my kids.
[2:20:19.320 --> 2:20:23.240]  My kids haven't had any shots and people go, what's going on with your kids? They're they're
[2:20:23.240 --> 2:20:27.960]  like so smart or so great. And it's because they haven't had this will stay right there.
[2:20:27.960 --> 2:20:32.280]  Dr. Wakefield, let's talk about the film, how people save children and where you think this
[2:20:32.280 --> 2:20:40.200]  confrontation is going 1986, the act.com. I'll be watching it tomorrow night. I'm going to watch

[2:21:47.880 --> 2:21:54.120]  track your GPS location. I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because
[2:21:54.120 --> 2:22:00.120]  that was un-American. Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on
[2:22:00.120 --> 2:22:06.280]  Apple and on droids don't just track your location but your surfing history where you go who you
[2:22:06.280 --> 2:22:11.800]  talk to your relationships and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the
[2:22:11.800 --> 2:22:18.040]  apps as well including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just like Siri or
[2:22:18.040 --> 2:22:24.200]  Alexa do and then putting databases transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be
[2:22:24.200 --> 2:22:29.240]  saved forever. Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores

[2:22:51.480 --> 2:22:58.200]  we'll see further surges in coronavirus positives because they're only ramping up the testing
[2:22:58.200 --> 2:23:04.760]  because the tests have been designed at the Wuhan lab it turns out to be completely fraudulent.
[2:23:04.760 --> 2:23:11.080]  They cook the whole thing up offshore in a communist dictatorship with Fauci Bill Gates
[2:23:11.080 --> 2:23:17.800]  and the Chai comms to be directed by the UN as a giant planetary power grab and now it's all
[2:23:17.800 --> 2:23:23.960]  over the news that indeed Bill Gates has developed digital tattoos under your skin and so is Google
[2:23:23.960 --> 2:23:29.000]  and they're deploying them at the airports next year where you'll have to have it to be able to
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:34.200]  travel oh and then soon to leave your house or go in a grocery store and the contact tracers work
[2:23:34.200 --> 2:23:37.720]  for Bill and the Gates and the Clintons and they're going to come to your house and make sure
[2:23:37.720 --> 2:23:53.640]  you're inoculated yes we're now inside the mark of the beast resist to be enslaved you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:53.640 --> 2:24:10.920]  all right doctor andrew wakefield has been a medical doctor that pioneered
[2:24:11.960 --> 2:24:14.840]  from what the mother's told him in his own testing that it was something
[2:24:14.840 --> 2:24:19.080]  calling an autoimmune response in the gut that was then causing something in the brain and we
[2:24:19.080 --> 2:24:22.840]  of course know the brain is connected to the spinal cord to the gut and the two things are
[2:24:22.840 --> 2:24:29.080]  absolutely connected when you get angry or hungry hangry is the word i guess and and and all the
[2:24:29.080 --> 2:24:34.040]  other things what type of studies now have come out that have really validated you that's why
[2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:38.440]  they don't even attack you that much anymore i see they try to censor you because you've been so
[2:24:38.440 --> 2:24:42.360]  so validated i mean the story of what i mean i know you don't want to make a film about yourself
[2:24:42.920 --> 2:24:48.680]  and some of it's in facts but i mean the hollywood movies fiction movies could not capture
[2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:53.640]  the incredible tribulations you've gone through and then for others going through attacks for telling
[2:24:53.640 --> 2:24:59.160]  the truth your big spiritual not awakening but emboldenment that you had in texas looking
[2:24:59.160 --> 2:25:03.320]  up at night sky it's beautiful so speak to that if the next two segments you've got the floor
[2:25:04.040 --> 2:25:09.320]  don't pause or i'll take over other points you want to make for people well you're very kind of
[2:25:09.320 --> 2:25:14.360]  actually first of all to say i'm just on the hollywood front and movies about my life i saw
[2:25:14.360 --> 2:25:22.680]  that the uh the screenwriter of the film contagion i made by sodaberg directed by sodaberg they
[2:25:22.680 --> 2:25:27.080]  was in the hollywood reporter saying that i a movie should be made about me during these troubled
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:36.680]  covid 19 times to tell the world about my crimes the the the terrible things that i by the way
[2:25:36.680 --> 2:25:41.560]  interrupt i just i said i would interrupt just a month ago i rewatch contagion it's like a blueprint
[2:25:41.560 --> 2:25:47.080]  for the lockdowns of the general public the mask the force inoculations i mean this is literally
[2:25:47.080 --> 2:25:51.960]  i saw that as like a blueprint of what they're doing so the guy that made that is saying you're
[2:25:51.960 --> 2:25:57.000]  the bad guy incredible well it's an interesting story and i'll just share this with you at the risk
[2:25:57.560 --> 2:26:03.880]  but but um david kerby my friend wrote a book uh called evidence of harm and it was about the
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:10.600]  the corruption of the data in relation to the mercury preservative in vaccines where
[2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:17.000]  the cdc found an effect a very strong effect for mercury causing neurological injury including
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:22.760]  autism and covered it up it was an extraordinary fraud he wrote about it in a book called evidence
[2:26:22.760 --> 2:26:30.760]  of harm and that was optioned by participant studios uh to make a movie it was then put in the
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:37.720]  bottom drawer and buried and never reappeared and lo and behold participant took place to part in
[2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:46.440]  in sodaberg's uh movie contagion that seems to have been in some people's minds uh the payback
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:53.400]  the payback that participant received for burying david kerby's book now i'm not sure as to i you
[2:26:53.400 --> 2:26:59.240]  know do we have a chapter and verse on that can we can i prove it no but that is a story that
[2:27:00.200 --> 2:27:07.240]  given my experience of the way in which hollywood is very much tied in to pharma and big tech but
[2:27:07.240 --> 2:27:14.360]  it would not surprise me in the least effect turned out to be true now as to the relationship
[2:27:14.360 --> 2:27:19.160]  between the gut and the brain that's right it was at the time it was somewhat challenging to a lot of
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:24.040]  people to suggest that we are one that something happening in our gut might affect our brain and
[2:27:24.040 --> 2:27:32.360]  it's gone so much further now than we reached we you know we triggered the process perhaps but it's
[2:27:32.360 --> 2:27:38.120]  really gone a very long way to the point where we realize the extraordinary importance for our
[2:27:38.120 --> 2:27:44.920]  well-being our survival our health of the microbiome it historically as you know in the times of
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:50.200]  louis pastor the microbe the bacteria was an enemy an enemy to be defeated an enemy that
[2:27:50.200 --> 2:27:55.240]  caused disease it was a question of perception and at the time you know when you had rampant
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:28:00.520]  neurosyphilis and gangrene on the battlefield these kinds of things you could see that it was
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:06.280]  entirely reasonable to see the microbe as an enemy but over the years we've learned that in fact we
[2:28:06.840 --> 2:28:16.920]  are nine tenths bacteria one tenth human and our very survival is dependent upon the integrity
[2:28:16.920 --> 2:28:22.440]  and health of the bacteria so we're really a colony organism that's why probiotics and everything
[2:28:22.440 --> 2:28:29.720]  is now becoming the whole future absolutely and and what we've learned is that gut bacteria and the
[2:28:29.720 --> 2:28:35.960]  health of gut bacteria are important are crucial for our brain development from the very beginning
[2:28:36.680 --> 2:28:43.960]  for our behavior for our emotions for the way in which we react and respond we really are what we
[2:28:43.960 --> 2:28:49.640]  eat and we are the bacteria that live in us we are no man is an island that's the thing to remember
[2:28:49.640 --> 2:28:55.400]  we are dependent upon the integrity of our bacteria once we realize that realize that they're not
[2:28:55.400 --> 2:29:01.400]  the enemy and appreciate them feed them cultivate them look after them to achieve the optimal
[2:29:02.040 --> 2:29:06.680]  it's like our body our skeleton our genetic code is the earth but then all these things
[2:29:06.680 --> 2:29:11.960]  live on it that's right and what is even more interesting of course is if you go back even
[2:29:11.960 --> 2:29:20.760]  further in evolutionary history you find that man and microbe fused at a very early point when the
[2:29:20.760 --> 2:29:26.840]  body now the mitochondria the energy source of all cells in the body are actually bacteria
[2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:33.880]  and they cultivated single cell organisms and gave them the oxidative energy capacity to turn
[2:29:33.880 --> 2:29:39.080]  into multicellular organisms that evolved into humans which again is a colony organism and expanding
[2:29:39.080 --> 2:29:45.880]  on that he goes back to women why do women have the mitochondrial DNA we don't truly women are
[2:29:45.880 --> 2:29:51.720]  the only whole human because they have both yes they are in many ways women are the only
[2:29:52.360 --> 2:29:56.360]  whole human and they're constantly reminding me of that thing well i'm not saying that to kiss
[2:29:56.360 --> 2:30:02.280]  their ass i'm just saying women have the mitochondrial DNA men don't and and science goes oh that's
[2:30:02.280 --> 2:30:07.560]  junk but now they're learning it's not junk there's something else there yes and as this
[2:30:07.560 --> 2:30:14.680]  film points out women also have an extraordinary capacity to register when their babies are well
[2:30:14.680 --> 2:30:20.120]  and ill and what's right for them what's wrong and and they've allowed the medical profession to usurp
[2:30:20.120 --> 2:30:27.240]  that uh that maternal intuition which we need to take back that internal authority that women
[2:30:27.240 --> 2:30:32.200]  need to reexert collectively and individually isn't that the racial super group consciousness
[2:30:32.200 --> 2:30:39.320]  computer sorry sir the genetic the racial consciousness kind of uh super computer of the
[2:30:39.320 --> 2:30:45.080]  species absolutely um and it's an extraordinarily powerful thing people say it's anti science it's
[2:30:45.080 --> 2:30:49.880]  not into science we simply do not understand it we haven't taken the trouble to investigate it
[2:30:49.880 --> 2:30:55.960]  and understand it it but it's as real as any science he will ever read and um it is the reason
[2:30:55.960 --> 2:31:01.400]  for our survival it is the reason that we are here on this earth today so i have come to learn and
[2:31:01.400 --> 2:31:06.840]  appreciate a great deal about the power of that maternal intuition it's not an emotional argument
[2:31:06.840 --> 2:31:12.360]  it's not an emotive argument it is a survival imperative absolutely tell me from your research
[2:31:12.360 --> 2:31:19.960]  as a leading person the general research of this what these so-called dna our dna vaccines that go
[2:31:19.960 --> 2:31:25.960]  into the nuclei it's not a regular vaccine is it no it's not it's extremely worrying a regular
[2:31:25.960 --> 2:31:31.480]  vaccines and this is an interesting story in itself live viral vaccines in particular
[2:31:31.480 --> 2:31:38.840]  depended for a very very long time upon being cultivated cultured in the laboratory in animal
[2:31:38.840 --> 2:31:45.080]  cells and one of the great catastrophes of that is that in those cells there were viruses that
[2:31:45.080 --> 2:31:53.800]  were harmless to the native animal but deadly for human beings and so that we made polio in cells
[2:31:53.800 --> 2:32:02.360]  contaminated with monkey cancer viruses we made rotavirus vaccine in cells that contain pig
[2:32:02.360 --> 2:32:11.080]  viruses and these viruses when they jump species like the Wuhan virus when it comes from one source
[2:32:11.080 --> 2:32:16.680]  into a human it can have devastating impact particularly when it's manipulated in the
[2:32:16.680 --> 2:32:23.080]  laboratory to enhance the deadliness of that impact this is called zoonosis and it has been a plague
[2:32:23.080 --> 2:32:29.320]  for live viral vaccines forever and one way of getting around that now because the authorities
[2:32:29.320 --> 2:32:34.440]  realize it they've tried to cover it up time and time again but they realize it's a problem so now
[2:32:34.440 --> 2:32:42.840]  they are circumventing that by creating naked RNA and dna vaccines your body acts as the cell
[2:32:42.840 --> 2:32:50.040]  culture system they put the RNA in it gets into cells and it encodes for proteins proteins
[2:32:50.040 --> 2:32:56.840]  as transcribed from that that you're talking real guinea pig russian roulette very very worrying
[2:32:56.840 --> 2:33:01.800]  because once it's in alex you can't get it down let's say you put in a piece of RNA from a virus

[2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:51.800]  this planetary lockdown the number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes we've gone over
[2:34:51.800 --> 2:34:58.600]  those purposes many times here on air the casual society the surveillance system global government
[2:34:58.600 --> 2:35:04.840]  medical tyranny forced inoculation but the most important facet is it teaches us that we are
[2:35:04.840 --> 2:35:13.800]  obsolete that we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over
[2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:20.520]  the jobs that people once had by design this isn't like it's some advancement that we just
[2:35:20.520 --> 2:35:27.320]  fell into it's been pre-planned organized globally and it's extremely predatory and through
[2:35:27.320 --> 2:35:33.800]  governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations the central banks that control it all
[2:35:33.800 --> 2:35:40.600]  are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power this is the truest form of
[2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:55.400]  technocracy fascism human freedom the wild wild west the renaissance america human liberty the west
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:36:03.800]  built all the freedom all the choices all the empowerment we see the general population has
[2:36:03.800 --> 2:36:10.600]  been programmed that submission to tyranny brings them prosperity because the last 50 years under
[2:36:10.600 --> 2:36:18.280]  psychotic globalist control they have taught us by successive approximation to bow down and each
[2:36:18.280 --> 2:36:24.600]  time be given a reward a treat but that's like training wild pigs to come eat out of your hand
[2:36:24.600 --> 2:36:31.240]  and finally one day you lead them into the barn and close the door and butcher them we're now
[2:36:31.240 --> 2:36:39.720]  reaching that point in societal development where submission is death where submission is the human

[2:38:07.560 --> 2:38:14.840]  so
[2:38:23.640 --> 2:38:31.240]  a war on for your mind you know the ancient greeks believed in spontaneous generation
[2:38:31.960 --> 2:38:36.840]  they looked down a little pool of water a foot deep five feet wide they suddenly see little fish
[2:38:36.840 --> 2:38:41.160]  in it they didn't know that a bird landed in a drink some water it had fish eggs on its legs
[2:38:41.160 --> 2:38:45.400]  they just saw a generator piece of meat out in the field a couple days later had maggots on it
[2:38:45.400 --> 2:38:49.400]  they thought it was spontaneous generation and then later they thought you put leeches on people
[2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:55.480]  that saved them george washington got bled to death by his family doctor and then as our guest
[2:38:55.480 --> 2:38:59.000]  dr wafable saying a couple hundred years ago they thought it's germs because they could see
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:03.160]  things coming from outside they didn't know that sometimes there's bad germs like bubonic plague
[2:39:03.160 --> 2:39:09.400]  or smallpox sometimes there's good germs almost in every case and so we sit here with big pharma
[2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:16.760]  doubling down with their agenda and now bill gates probably the most hated man in the world i mean
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:22.280]  i can drive down the street and go f bill gates arrest bill gates and the average officer goes
[2:39:22.280 --> 2:39:29.960]  yeah liberal conservative you name it how is this corrupt microsoft head who's famously corrupt and
[2:39:29.960 --> 2:39:35.640]  bad telling us he's our doctor no one is buying it i don't want to be over positive for dr wakefield
[2:39:35.640 --> 2:39:39.960]  but i gotta tell you i think they've jumped the shark i want you to speak to that what people
[2:39:39.960 --> 2:39:45.880]  can do how important the film is because again our biggest problem is we get where a kind of a
[2:39:45.880 --> 2:39:51.960]  normalcy bias that this shows awake you're awake but there are new listeners tuning in every millisecond
[2:39:51.960 --> 2:39:56.520]  they need to know this is a big fight big pharma's not backing down they're doubling down so can you
[2:39:56.520 --> 2:40:01.160]  speak to what you think of fouching gates being a lot of trouble then finish up with what we should
[2:40:01.160 --> 2:40:06.440]  do and then get back into these so-called new vaccines because if i call the 357 magnum the
[2:40:06.440 --> 2:40:11.560]  new vaccine the shot they have with lead i mean the new vaccines aren't even what the old vaccines
[2:40:11.560 --> 2:40:18.120]  were so the vaccine is just something put in our body by big pharma and by the state maybe i should
[2:40:18.120 --> 2:40:23.640]  deal with that first yeah do it because we were right there alex we were talking about that and
[2:40:23.640 --> 2:40:29.720]  we were talking about the long term the medium to long term dangers of these these genetically
[2:40:29.720 --> 2:40:35.240]  manipulated these frankenstein vaccines that have never been used in humans before but there
[2:40:35.240 --> 2:40:42.920]  was an example and as you know with the dengue virus the dengue fever virus vaccine in children
[2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:50.040]  in the far east and they developed this vaccine which was one genetic backbone one virus with
[2:40:50.040 --> 2:40:56.520]  other virus the dengue virus added to that so a true frankenstein vaccine something that had never
[2:40:56.520 --> 2:41:03.160]  been seen before in the natural world and they injected it into lots of people lots and lots
[2:41:03.160 --> 2:41:07.880]  of children it got through approval based upon the data that they've given to the regulators
[2:41:08.520 --> 2:41:12.920]  and it was put given to hundreds of thousands of children and it produced antibodies it produced
[2:41:12.920 --> 2:41:18.680]  immunity apparently and it didn't seem to produce any adverse reactions so people were happy with
[2:41:18.680 --> 2:41:28.120]  this until until this these children it were exposed to the natural dengue fever virus itself and
[2:41:28.120 --> 2:41:35.160]  when that happened it was catastrophe many died many were injured and they the rest of those
[2:41:35.160 --> 2:41:40.280]  children who were exposed to that vaccine live with that risk for the rest of their lives when
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:47.640]  they will encounter the natural virus they will overreact and have a meltdown their immune system
[2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:56.680]  will go into what is called a cytokine storm now this process this immune priming so that when you
[2:41:56.680 --> 2:42:02.920]  encounter the new the natural virus you run into real problems this was seen with the SARS vaccine
[2:42:02.920 --> 2:42:09.000]  in the ferrets this was the reason why that experiment that vaccine was abandoned for SARS
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:16.360]  because they saw this overreaction of the immune the primed immune system this is something that
[2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:21.240]  we have to be very careful of and it's not something that's ever going to be seen in the short-term
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:27.800]  safety studies that are being conducted on these about to say they're skipping animal trials
[2:42:27.800 --> 2:42:33.000]  they're admitting most people get sick in the trials engages says 700 000 will get sick and die
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:37.160]  what are they priming us for a and then be getting back to what you were just saying
[2:42:37.880 --> 2:42:43.080]  that a lot of experts are saying it looks like that maybe previous vaccines for the flu
[2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:48.440]  because COVID-19 was some vaccine test they're not sure that maybe because it's an artificial test
[2:42:48.440 --> 2:42:54.440]  that once it got out of the lab by accident it's triggering because it's got flu and SARS and all of
[2:42:54.440 --> 2:43:00.760]  it in it yes and what's alarming about Gates's approach is he goes on television says everybody
[2:43:00.760 --> 2:43:05.960]  should have this vaccine all seven billion people in the world and there will be casualties there
[2:43:05.960 --> 2:43:12.520]  will be risk and at that point Alex rather than saying and for those who are injured by the vaccine
[2:43:12.520 --> 2:43:18.040]  there will be compensation we will look after them we will make sure that their health he says we need
[2:43:18.040 --> 2:43:24.280]  to be indemnified that's exactly right his emphasis is only concern is there will be
[2:43:24.280 --> 2:43:29.640]  injuries and therefore we need indemnity for the manufacturers there's no shred of humanity
[2:43:30.440 --> 2:43:35.240]  in his reaction to the fact that well the good news is thanks to you and millions of people
[2:43:35.240 --> 2:43:38.600]  and but you you're on the top i don't you want credit but it's got to be do where it's new
[2:43:38.600 --> 2:43:44.280]  we'll know to protect you and support you thanks to you and others in this show they have to admit
[2:43:44.280 --> 2:43:47.880]  now there's damage remember they were used to say you were crazy there's no damage dr wakefield
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:43:53.720]  that's right and now they've it's become so self-evident this is the tragedy Alex has
[2:43:53.720 --> 2:43:59.880]  become so common so prevalent even those who had resisted this notion for many years of witnessing
[2:43:59.880 --> 2:44:04.920]  it in their own communities their own families their own children it's really very very sad it
[2:44:04.920 --> 2:44:09.400]  should never have had to be this way and there is so much damage that could have been avoided
[2:44:09.400 --> 2:44:15.800]  when the question now is what do we do what do americans do and the fascinating thing about this
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:20.920]  is someone who observes american politics having come from the outside and observes
[2:44:20.920 --> 2:44:29.000]  america american politics is that the rush to mandate vaccines for all children ultimately
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:36.920]  all adults in states which is where these laws are made has been divided directly down political
[2:44:36.920 --> 2:44:43.400]  lines and in every effort to support mandatory vaccination there are the democrats and in the
[2:44:43.400 --> 2:44:50.360]  resistance to mandatory vaccination there have been the republicans so that's just a fact i don't
[2:44:50.360 --> 2:44:54.680]  mean to quantify it or cause i agree but that's getting a lot of liberals to support the republicans
[2:44:54.680 --> 2:45:01.240]  it's a simple fact and so but what is happening now is that many many more people are coming
[2:45:01.240 --> 2:45:08.760]  over to this side to the side of health freedom of bodily autonomy of the choice to what to put
[2:45:08.760 --> 2:45:17.000]  in your child's body or your own body people have been woken up by this this covid issue
[2:45:17.720 --> 2:45:22.360]  such that and historically of course when you look at the way in which the political parties
[2:45:22.360 --> 2:45:28.440]  are funded the republicans get their funding from oil and gas and the automotive industry
[2:45:28.440 --> 2:45:33.560]  which are not available to the great majority of democrats who get their funding largely from the
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:39.800]  pharmaceutical industry and therefore i beholden to the benevolence of the pharmaceutical industry
[2:45:39.800 --> 2:45:47.000]  to mount their campaigns and therefore when it comes to instituting preferential policies for
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:53.240]  that industry it's seen state by state by state why don't we just nationalize vaccines because
[2:45:53.240 --> 2:45:57.800]  i mean let me ask you as an expert if there's a vaccine works i like tetanus whatever if it's
[2:45:57.800 --> 2:46:02.520]  not tainted or been tested i want it i mean i get has side effects but are you against vaccines
[2:46:02.520 --> 2:46:06.680]  period or i mean explain we're not against vaccines right we're just against liability protection
[2:46:06.680 --> 2:46:12.280]  and guinea pigging right yeah i'm not against anything alex i'm pro i'm pro science i'm pro
[2:46:12.280 --> 2:46:17.960]  safety i'm pro are there any safe vaccines is everyone i've ever looked at's got problems yeah
[2:46:17.960 --> 2:46:23.880]  i that's my my experience as well the more i look the more problems i find um and it gets worse
[2:46:23.880 --> 2:46:29.160]  and it gets worse and it doesn't get better and it gets worse and so um no i'm not anti anything
[2:46:29.160 --> 2:46:35.560]  i'm pro safety i'm pro vaccine i'm pro liability i am pro that's what i'm saying if something works
[2:46:35.560 --> 2:46:40.920]  i'm gonna take it but if it i mean i've had family so much family gets sick from vaccines
[2:46:40.920 --> 2:46:45.560]  everybody has the stories we only got a minute and a half left i'm gonna go see the film but in
[2:46:45.560 --> 2:46:50.760]  closing gut level how does this end i see the big establishment losing i think like hitler
[2:46:50.760 --> 2:46:55.320]  when he's losing in the west he invades russia that makes him totally lose i think this offense
[2:46:55.320 --> 2:46:59.640]  they've launched to use the hitler analogies they're barbarossa they're waterloo i think they're
[2:46:59.640 --> 2:47:04.520]  gonna lose i think they are and i think what the american people and i've read it very good reason
[2:47:04.520 --> 2:47:10.280]  to believe this the american people will ultimately in november vote for a president whoever that might
[2:47:10.280 --> 2:47:15.720]  be who will stand up and say american bodily autonomy the right of americans to choose what goes
[2:47:15.720 --> 2:47:20.760]  into their bodies is first and foremost that is what america is about if we are going to rush
[2:47:20.760 --> 2:47:27.000]  this vaccine to market if there is no liability there can be no mandates you cannot force people
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:31.320]  to have something that's not been not at all and trump has said he doesn't want mandates but he
[2:47:31.320 --> 2:47:36.280]  still says oh vaccine he'll get the stock market up uh absolutely incredible so the film is out now
[2:47:36.280 --> 2:47:40.680]  if i go home tonight i've got to watch the one censored on pedophilia i'm going to get to that

[2:48:35.320 --> 2:48:41.400]  most americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history that we really
[2:48:41.400 --> 2:48:47.240]  have a blind spot for tyranny we don't appreciate the american way truth justice due process the
[2:48:47.240 --> 2:48:51.320]  right to self-defense private property because we've had it so long and we just think that's
[2:48:51.320 --> 2:48:56.840]  how the rest of the world is ladies and gentlemen the renaissance the social contract that's 500 years
[2:48:56.840 --> 2:49:02.280]  old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well
[2:49:02.280 --> 2:49:07.560]  as the strong is something the west invented and that's what made our modern world that's now been
[2:49:07.560 --> 2:49:12.680]  hijacked by the technocrats by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we
[2:49:12.680 --> 2:49:18.760]  need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate manipulate
[2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:24.200]  and command you were even lucky enough to stay alive and that's what covet nineteen is a global

[2:50:49.880 --> 2:50:56.680]  be so powerful but he supports nikey and apple and all of their slave camps in china he's a slave
[2:50:56.680 --> 2:51:02.440]  master this headlines america burns brawn james jersey every comes out as a communist now he's
[2:51:02.440 --> 2:51:07.640]  worse than that he's a man that turned his back on free humans and and then said america sucked
[2:51:07.640 --> 2:51:12.440]  here's the report it's on info wars dot com i want shroyer and uh robin others here it is
[2:51:13.560 --> 2:51:20.760]  you know i used to be a fan of brawn james i grew up playing basketball always was a basketball
[2:51:20.760 --> 2:51:27.720]  fan left watching the nba on tv and sadly what i've seen professional sports and
[2:51:27.720 --> 2:51:36.120]  more than any of them the nba become is a marxist chinese anti-american propaganda tool and the
[2:51:36.120 --> 2:51:43.800]  leader of this in the nba is lebron james lebron i used to be a big fan of yours man i liked watching
[2:51:43.800 --> 2:51:48.520]  you play basketball i liked watching you win championships i appreciated your greatness
[2:51:48.520 --> 2:51:55.240]  on the court you truly are a great basketball player but when it comes to a man when it comes
[2:51:55.240 --> 2:52:05.320]  to an american they're pathetic and now that i know that lebron james is a slave owner yeah
[2:52:06.120 --> 2:52:10.920]  where do you think lebron james shoes get made where do you think lebron james jerseys get made
[2:52:10.920 --> 2:52:19.480]  and his shirts and all the lebron memorabilia china with child labor and slave labor now lebron james
[2:52:19.480 --> 2:52:25.240]  is worth hundreds of millions of dollars nike is a billion dollar company they could easily
[2:52:25.240 --> 2:52:30.040]  afford to pay americans that lebron james claims to so much claims to care so much about with
[2:52:30.040 --> 2:52:36.360]  black lives matter they could afford to pay american kids even they want to get their first job 15
[2:52:36.360 --> 2:52:43.720]  even 20 an hour pretty good starting wage and those american kids could earn that wage in american
[2:52:43.720 --> 2:52:48.760]  factories that make american shoes made in america but lebron james doesn't do that nike
[2:52:48.760 --> 2:52:57.000]  doesn't do that no instead he puts on the black lives matter shirt which we now know is just a
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:53:04.600]  marxist communist anti-family agenda you can go look at it for yourself ladies and gentlemen
[2:53:04.600 --> 2:53:11.400]  black lives matter stands for ending the nuclear family and just like lebron is a pathetic american
[2:53:11.400 --> 2:53:18.520]  for selling out to china he's a pathetic father for selling out his own family and his own boys
[2:53:19.960 --> 2:53:24.040]  for the black lives matter agenda so i'm i'm i'm upset that i have to do this today
[2:53:25.320 --> 2:53:32.120]  but we're going to go ahead and we're going to light this traders this communist traders
[2:53:32.120 --> 2:53:39.720]  this anti-american traders jersey on fire here today because this is how america feels about
[2:53:39.720 --> 2:53:46.200]  the nba right now this is a bit how america feels about the nba catering and pandering to the chinese
[2:53:46.200 --> 2:53:52.680]  communists this is how america feels about athletes that make more money and are worth more money than
[2:53:52.680 --> 2:53:59.000]  the average american could ever even imagine taking a knee and telling us how we're privileged
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:06.200]  taking a knee telling us how we need to give up our rights taking a knee telling us how they're
[2:54:06.920 --> 2:54:15.160]  oppressed so this is what america thinks now about lebron james and the nba and by the way
[2:54:15.160 --> 2:54:20.680]  it's mutual because lebron james came out and said we don't care if america watches our games
[2:54:20.680 --> 2:54:25.640]  or not why would he say something like that because he knows ladies and gentlemen they
[2:54:25.640 --> 2:54:31.800]  already sold out to the chinese they're already making their chinese money so if lebron james
[2:54:31.800 --> 2:54:39.320]  ever wants to be taken seriously as a man and as an american again he needs to stop pandering
[2:54:39.320 --> 2:54:46.680]  for the chai cons he needs to stop attacking the american family and he needs to stop attacking
[2:54:47.720 --> 2:54:53.960]  the values and principles that we stand for during the national anthem in this country but just know
[2:54:53.960 --> 2:55:03.720]  this lebron james is not a basketball player no lebron james is now a slave owner that makes all
[2:55:03.720 --> 2:55:11.160]  of his jerseys and shoes and he's also now a leader of a domestic anti-family anti-american
[2:55:11.160 --> 2:55:15.720]  terror group known as black lives matter that's what lebron james is
[2:55:15.720 --> 2:55:22.280]  the bronz is a slave of the new allure that's all he knows
[2:55:24.120 --> 2:55:30.760]  now we're gonna start the next hour have a special report that dr nick beggars is taken over
[2:55:32.280 --> 2:55:35.960]  but don't get upset by people that are followers the bron james is the follower

[2:57:19.480 --> 2:57:25.000]  that lied from a to z about everything about coronavirus they lied about the death toll they
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:28.760]  lied about how they were doing the testing they lied and counted people that died of gunshot wounds
[2:57:28.760 --> 2:57:33.880]  and car wrecks and the same frauds that then own the patents on the very vaccines they're
[2:57:33.880 --> 2:57:38.920]  trying to force us to take with incredible conflicts of interest come out now and tell us
[2:57:38.920 --> 2:57:44.920]  that the whole world is collapsing in a planetary reset not because they created all this fiat
[2:57:44.920 --> 2:57:48.920]  currency not because they stole trillions of dollars not because they created this huge bubble
[2:57:48.920 --> 2:57:53.800]  but because of coronavirus and i said six months ago and so did our reporter greg riggs will play
[2:57:53.800 --> 2:57:59.720]  as reporter moment that this was part of the great global reset that debos and others have been
[2:57:59.720 --> 2:58:04.840]  calling for that way the establishment doesn't get the blame for the collapse of civilization
[2:58:04.840 --> 2:58:09.880]  that they've engineered that they'll use to consolidate power no that way they blame it on
[2:58:09.880 --> 2:58:14.200]  covet nineteen and that's exactly what the rockefeller foundation talked about a decade ago
[2:58:14.200 --> 2:58:19.000]  it's what bill among the gates talked about last year using a global pandemic or the fear of
[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:26.360]  every pandemic to bring in absolute and total control with a police state and a surveillance
[2:58:26.360 --> 2:58:32.360]  tech grid with the contact tracers over the organized collapse and so the people would accept
[2:58:32.360 --> 2:58:36.920]  having a permanent loss in their standard of living to lower their carbon well now they've
[2:58:36.920 --> 2:58:41.720]  come out admitted that michelle obama has said covet is going to help us re-engineer the world
[2:58:41.720 --> 2:58:46.360]  and redistribute wealth and cnn and the new york times have said this is good for the earth
[2:58:46.360 --> 2:58:50.760]  it's lowering our carbon footprint but the richest people in the world are leftist and
[2:58:50.760 --> 2:58:56.840]  communist and socialist who fly around in jumbo jets and make billions of dollars a year because
[2:58:56.840 --> 2:59:02.680]  communism is set up by the elites to enslave and domesticate those at the bottom every single time
[2:59:02.680 --> 2:59:08.680]  it's a way to con people back into serfdom and back into slavery so the worldwide collapse that we
[2:59:08.680 --> 2:59:15.720]  are accelerating into right now has been a hundred percent engineered and authored and implemented
[2:59:15.720 --> 2:59:21.880]  by the globalist to bring in world government to put the united nations who in charge and now we
[2:59:21.880 --> 2:59:25.960]  see videos all over europe and all over the u.s and the uk australia where there'll be a woman
[2:59:25.960 --> 2:59:31.000]  not wearing a mask in a store and people walk up and say you can't be here without a mask the who
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:35.800]  says and the woman's like but local law says if i have asthma or something i'll have to wear it he
[2:59:35.800 --> 2:59:42.520]  says i don't care the u.n says get out of here so you wake up and you're under the united nations
[2:59:42.520 --> 2:59:46.120]  and it brings in the cashless society that refusing cash everywhere and allows them to
[2:59:46.120 --> 2:59:51.320]  surveil us and track us and control us with the clinton global initiative running the worldwide
[2:59:51.320 --> 2:59:57.400]  tracking program that the taxpayer money by the billions is then forked over to them to make
[2:59:57.400 --> 3:00:03.160]  money while they track and trace and control our lives big tech was always set up to destroy the
[3:00:03.160 --> 3:00:07.560]  freedom of the web and to consolidate power and to censor and now that they've silenced almost
[3:00:07.560 --> 3:00:12.520]  everyone off the internet they're moving forward now to silence hundreds of prominent doctors
[3:00:12.520 --> 3:00:18.360]  urologists epidemiologists and other scientists that are exposing that the entire covet 19 story
[3:00:18.360 --> 3:00:24.120]  is a lie and now they're talking about arresting people that question fouchy and the united nations
[3:00:24.120 --> 3:00:29.800]  we've gone off the edge of the cliff in to high tech modern tyranny and only being honest about
[3:00:29.800 --> 3:00:35.560]  it is going to stop it now the united states is seeing food prices massively spike because
[3:00:35.560 --> 3:00:40.120]  if there's a positive at a farm of covet 19 they shut it down for a few weeks if there's a positive
[3:00:40.120 --> 3:00:44.600]  of a warehouse they shut it down for a few weeks even if people are asymptomatic almost every case
[3:00:44.600 --> 3:00:49.720]  and not sick china's been open for business the entire time only the united states is still locked
[3:00:49.720 --> 3:00:53.960]  down only the united states is told we're the bad guys because we've done a hundred times the testing
[3:00:53.960 --> 3:00:59.240]  of anybody else and the testing in are almost all false positive they were designed to be
[3:00:59.240 --> 3:01:04.920]  this was cooked up in modern globalist warfare circles to bring down the nation state and bring
[3:01:04.920 --> 3:01:09.800]  down america and punish us for electing president trump and president trump has dropped the ball
[3:01:09.800 --> 3:01:14.440]  stopping the coordinated racketeering of big tech and the silencing of the medical community in
[3:01:14.440 --> 3:01:19.800]  america and president trump has dropped the ball on really coming out and exposing the democrats
[3:01:19.800 --> 3:01:23.880]  actually work with the chai comms and the globalist and her actual enemies of the republic that don't
[3:01:23.880 --> 3:01:29.960]  think the country should even exist we are under an existential threat to destroy our very existence
[3:01:29.960 --> 3:01:34.120]  there's a letter that general flinn put out yesterday that lays this out where he explains
[3:01:34.120 --> 3:01:39.560]  this is a spiritual war to bring down the united states and that this is clearly satanism using
[3:01:39.560 --> 3:01:44.920]  communism as its template with powerful billionaires orchestrating and running the entire operation
[3:01:44.920 --> 3:01:50.360]  this is the authoritarian fall of the united states and the slaves that are begging for believing
[3:01:50.360 --> 3:01:55.400]  they will be empowered will wake up even more enslaved than they were before the united states
[3:01:55.400 --> 3:02:01.400]  is sliding rapidly into venezuela venezuela has more wealth per capita the united states
[3:02:01.400 --> 3:02:08.120]  raw oil and timber and gold and jewels and infrastructure and they were the richest country
[3:02:08.120 --> 3:02:14.280]  in south america until communism came to them and now they have already long since eaten their
[3:02:14.280 --> 3:02:20.120]  dogs and cats thousands die a week from starvation and that's where the united states is going
[3:02:20.120 --> 3:02:23.880]  because the globalists want to collapse us they want to break us and they're starting with the
[3:02:23.880 --> 3:02:29.560]  blue cities and blue states creating artificial depressions putting out the fentanyl advertising
[3:02:29.560 --> 3:02:34.520]  that you can be homeless and live on the street to destroy confidence and to collapse the entire
[3:02:34.520 --> 3:02:38.360]  united states that's why they're wrecking things by design that's why they're saying overthrow
[3:02:38.360 --> 3:02:42.680]  the police that's why they're saying blow up the police stations officially in the city of austin
[3:02:42.680 --> 3:02:48.840]  budget because they are overthrowing america they are engaged in a takeover in closing i'll tell
[3:02:48.840 --> 3:02:54.280]  listeners this and viewers this is the most critical time in human history not just u.s history
[3:02:54.280 --> 3:02:59.320]  80 days out from the election you need to share the articles and the videos from man dot video

[3:04:13.800 --> 3:04:18.600]  venezuela in six months it won't take five years like venezuela to that point so i would suggest

[3:05:35.160 --> 3:05:41.720]  preparing for it for decades it's now collapsing into us this is it so get ready and get prepared
[3:05:41.720 --> 3:05:46.040]  and just remember that people are already having to sell their children to slavery all the world
[3:05:46.040 --> 3:05:49.240]  just to be able to feed their other children okay you have to decide what child to sell in
[3:05:49.240 --> 3:05:54.600]  a sex slavery that's in the news it will become like that overnight here as well and it's so sad
[3:05:54.600 --> 3:05:59.160]  it's so disgusting and again i'm just begging people to realize we're not in kansas anymore
[3:05:59.160 --> 3:06:04.040]  we're not in a normal situation anymore we're fighting existentially for our very existence
[3:06:04.040 --> 3:06:07.800]  that's why they're causing race for to divide everybody it's why they're causing economic war
[3:06:07.800 --> 3:06:12.280]  it's why they're causing this total lockdown because we are under dual order attack and if
[3:06:12.280 --> 3:06:16.200]  america people aren't strong enough to admit that to themselves trump won't be strong enough to tell
[3:06:16.200 --> 3:06:21.880]  us the truth and really do what needs to be done but this is it pray to god for guidance god bless
[3:06:21.880 --> 3:06:26.680]  and good luck a lot of folks are asking me is that real video is a green screen no that's that's

[3:06:46.280 --> 3:06:52.440]  year ago that in the middle of 2020 the democrats as well as many republican leaders will be calling
[3:06:52.440 --> 3:06:59.960]  for the united nations wh o edict that all americans wear masks be a quote federal order
[3:06:59.960 --> 3:07:08.680]  and mandate totally unconstitutional annihilating states rights think about that a woman can kill
[3:07:08.680 --> 3:07:15.800]  her baby we pay for illegal aliens health care but you've got to wear a mask for a virus that killed
[3:07:15.800 --> 3:07:21.640]  20 plus times less than what they said even if you believe the official story this is about the
[3:07:21.640 --> 3:07:28.200]  who the globe was testing their power through the media over the federal government to set
[3:07:28.200 --> 3:07:33.480]  policy of the united states this is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the
[3:07:33.480 --> 3:07:39.400]  parents accord and all of it and by the way they admit that they say now your carbon's down one
[3:07:39.400 --> 3:07:46.760]  way or another you stupid americans as the years go by it gets harder and harder to keep up with

[3:09:13.640 --> 3:09:20.200]  and welcome back this is uh nick a baggage from anchor galasta and i'm coming to you in my morning
[3:09:20.200 --> 3:09:27.240]  your afternoon and post the world and uh wait you know listen to that um last segments you know just
[3:09:27.240 --> 3:09:32.520]  talking about sort of what's happening and where where we're headed how we're kind of being hurted
[3:09:32.520 --> 3:09:40.520]  and pushed along uh in a certain direction over the cliff uh actually um isn't a bad analogy but
[3:09:41.080 --> 3:09:47.080]  what i want to uh talk about today is the issues of personal privacy which keep coming up i mean
[3:09:47.080 --> 3:09:54.200]  in the context of medical records and vaccines this stuff that's being discussed wakefield who we
[3:09:54.200 --> 3:10:01.160]  just heard from you know is is one of the most outspoken folks uh on the issue excellent excellent
[3:10:01.160 --> 3:10:09.480]  gaston of vaccines the the thing that strikes me is the opportunity and what alex was alluding to
[3:10:09.480 --> 3:10:17.880]  uh the whole collapse of our entire system in the reset and being blamed on um covid 19 when in fact
[3:10:18.680 --> 3:10:22.920]  anyone who was tracking anything about what was going on in the financial markets knew
[3:10:23.480 --> 3:10:28.200]  that we were headed for some really unsettling times but but think about what's actually
[3:10:28.200 --> 3:10:34.200]  happened is there's a tidal wave that's kind of been suspended it's there it's not being felt
[3:10:34.200 --> 3:10:40.600]  by everyone yet but it's there about ready to just make that final last fall on top of everyone
[3:10:41.240 --> 3:10:47.560]  and and and what i say about this is it's all been artificially propped up and it's given
[3:10:47.560 --> 3:10:54.680]  coverage uh to a lot of big financial people um by pumping so much money into the stock market so
[3:10:54.680 --> 3:11:02.680]  much money into the financial markets blowing up a really a bubble of unbelievable proportions when
[3:11:02.680 --> 3:11:09.000]  you consider um what's involved here in terms of money i mean this is a huge amount of money
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:13.480]  so while the markets continue to rise and the little guy continues to get in thinking they're
[3:11:13.480 --> 3:11:20.200]  going to miss the boat the big guys are probably bailing out you know and you're bailing in to
[3:11:20.200 --> 3:11:24.600]  make sure they can so what i see is a lot of money flowing in from treasury a lot of money
[3:11:24.600 --> 3:11:30.200]  flowing in from the federal reserve um and essentially propping up bad investments by a
[3:11:30.200 --> 3:11:37.800]  whole lot of big people and meanwhile uh back on main street the average person uh is feeling it
[3:11:37.800 --> 3:11:43.240]  they're feeling it an inflation starting in the supermarket primarily with food they're seeing it
[3:11:43.240 --> 3:11:49.880]  in uh no jobs i mean come on the service sector is not back it's not coming back in the same form
[3:11:50.600 --> 3:11:57.800]  the prop up to the economy in terms of uh unemployment and these things are in debate
[3:11:57.800 --> 3:12:02.600]  i'm sure that will get resolved in the next few days and just given where everyone's at if the
[3:12:02.600 --> 3:12:07.720]  democrats can figure out a way to blame trump they probably won't put any more money in it
[3:12:07.720 --> 3:12:14.120]  if uh if they can't they'll they'll fully fund it through the election period and here's the thing
[3:12:14.120 --> 3:12:21.560]  that's so disturbing is the covid 19 issue all of this is being framed politically when it really
[3:12:21.560 --> 3:12:28.680]  ought to be put framed in science uh and and if you look at all of the news coverage it's all about
[3:12:28.680 --> 3:12:33.960]  when do we get the orange man next when do we beat up trump next and that's what we're seeing
[3:12:33.960 --> 3:12:40.840]  and that what's occurred because of that is real information that all of us need is not coming through
[3:12:40.840 --> 3:12:48.760]  and it's just another layering of this matrix of control of public airwaves private communications
[3:12:48.760 --> 3:12:57.560]  um and really getting back into the privacy it gives cover to blame a virus for incompetence
[3:12:57.560 --> 3:13:03.560]  both governmentally and in terms of corporate america and the world globalist for that matter
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:09.080]  who have set us up for this grand collapse and then you look at what is the aftermath and what
[3:13:09.080 --> 3:13:14.360]  have you seen in the background and we've all been talking about it of the world health organizations
[3:13:14.360 --> 3:13:22.920]  the un even the democrats in congress talked about rolling out the ultimate id chips you know a way to
[3:13:22.920 --> 3:13:31.720]  secure positive identification this really would round out what's been happening for the last three
[3:13:31.720 --> 3:13:38.440]  decades in terms of data collection and manipulation this would essentially allow government and
[3:13:38.440 --> 3:13:45.960]  private entities to have every bit of data necessary to profile you perfectly all of your
[3:13:45.960 --> 3:13:51.640]  consumption habits all of your communication habits the post office and government track
[3:13:51.640 --> 3:13:56.920]  every piece of mail who it's from and where it goes you know when it's scanned in all that data is
[3:13:56.920 --> 3:14:02.120]  kept all your phone records are kept all your medical records are kept you realize that just
[3:14:02.120 --> 3:14:07.640]  going on the internet and on your phone because of the apps and the permissions you've given
[3:14:07.640 --> 3:14:14.680]  every single thing is important is kept where you put your cursor you know when you move around
[3:14:14.680 --> 3:14:19.960]  the screen you kind of let it rest most people let it rest in the same place they keep track of that
[3:14:19.960 --> 3:14:25.240]  because that's where the pop-ups occurred if you've noticed the aggravation that's where they occur
[3:14:25.240 --> 3:14:30.440]  right or in your field of vision so you have to respond or at least look at them glance at them
[3:14:30.440 --> 3:14:36.760]  because it's all about getting your attention holding your attention gathering data and then
[3:14:36.760 --> 3:14:43.160]  getting you into a feedback loop that keeps you moving down a certain trajectory that can be
[3:14:43.720 --> 3:14:49.400]  moved any way a person want to move you left move you right by just limiting or expanding
[3:14:49.400 --> 3:14:55.320]  your information flow according to what it is that you're about now everything you got to think
[3:14:55.320 --> 3:15:01.160]  about this again in the in the context of personal privacy every time you use a credit card and now
[3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:07.080]  they don't want to take cash they want a card so all those transactions back back to you individual
[3:15:07.080 --> 3:15:12.360]  so you get the bigger and better profile now the problem with all of this is how it's used
[3:15:13.240 --> 3:15:18.600]  because it's used to manipulate you know we've all talked about and you've heard about if you're
[3:15:18.600 --> 3:15:26.360]  listening this broadcast the china social score we have exactly the same thing social scoring in
[3:15:26.360 --> 3:15:32.680]  china is every data element every facial recognition interaction on the street where you are what you
[3:15:32.680 --> 3:15:38.200]  do determines what you can do within a communist state it regulates what kind of apartment you
[3:15:38.200 --> 3:15:41.800]  can get whether you're going to get a passport and travel out of the country whether you can
[3:15:41.800 --> 3:15:45.240]  ride a train or you got to walk whether you get a job or whether you don't whether your kids go to
[3:15:45.240 --> 3:15:51.160]  college or whether they don't all that is decided by social scoring gathering all of your data and
[3:15:51.160 --> 3:15:56.920]  then determining how it lines up with the state now we see the same thing happening in the west
[3:15:56.920 --> 3:16:04.920]  under the guise of consumerism under the guise of the age of surveillance capitalism you know this
[3:16:04.920 --> 3:16:10.440]  even the new york time was smart enough to see this one um and and this one is one of the best
[3:16:11.080 --> 3:16:17.960]  books on what's happening with our data and yet it's still only a snapshot and it's a thick book
[3:16:17.960 --> 3:16:22.440]  i mean it's got hundreds of citations i mean hundreds of source documents the kind of book
[3:16:22.440 --> 3:16:28.040]  that i like because it gives you the evidence that you need so that we can make determinations
[3:16:28.040 --> 3:16:33.160]  about what's happening and how our world is shaping the the whole connection of individual
[3:16:33.160 --> 3:16:42.040]  id tack to you and then ultimately a type of id that is biometric perhaps maybe your fingerprints
[3:16:42.040 --> 3:16:47.960]  maybe your iris scans maybe your face for facial recognition all three have been captured in india
[3:16:47.960 --> 3:16:53.880]  and if you want to get on any system any of their governmental systems you have to have that
[3:16:54.600 --> 3:16:59.800]  biometrics this is what's happening on the commercial side and the private side and it's
[3:16:59.800 --> 3:17:06.760]  all being done of course for your own safety and security that's the story but that is the biggest
[3:17:06.760 --> 3:17:13.320]  lie of all because what we need to do is turn this around the other way we need transparency
[3:17:13.320 --> 3:17:18.200]  in government we need transparency for multinational corporations we need transparency
[3:17:18.200 --> 3:17:23.720]  for the nonprofit organizations that are their left and right arms for manipulating the public
[3:17:23.720 --> 3:17:29.800]  we need transparency the cameras pointing the other direction not at us as individuals as
[3:17:29.800 --> 3:17:36.200]  sovereign souls but at the other guy who's looking in on our life this is dr nick baggage we're going

[3:21:38.200 --> 3:21:45.960]  you do and uh currently everything that we market we market uh through info war store you know i'm
[3:21:45.960 --> 3:21:50.040]  thinking about where we're at on the privacy questions and getting back into that because
[3:21:50.040 --> 3:21:56.840]  that really is um the the crux of it and you know i've written about this stuff for years in fact um
[3:21:56.840 --> 3:22:03.400]  in earth rising the revolution 20 20 years ago uh we were talking about sort of where we would be
[3:22:03.400 --> 3:22:10.440]  today and alex references this sometimes because it was so clear uh to us at earth pulse those
[3:22:10.440 --> 3:22:17.800]  years ago of what was happening and the trajectory we were on and and the end sort of the last piece
[3:22:17.800 --> 3:22:24.920]  in the puzzle was to get all transactions everything you do and this is again you know the filthy
[3:22:25.560 --> 3:22:31.480]  money we circulate now um being told that hey this is a virus carrier we need to get rid of it
[3:22:31.480 --> 3:22:36.040]  um and a lot of people are buying into that and and i think we're going to see more of it you know
[3:22:36.040 --> 3:22:41.400]  already a number of airlines for years if not taking currency they would only take credit cards
[3:22:41.400 --> 3:22:46.920]  and i kind of question that you know in terms of a legal position is why should we be forced for
[3:22:46.920 --> 3:22:53.560]  our legal money to use some third party bank you know i mean at least let's use the second party
[3:22:54.280 --> 3:22:59.000]  financial reserve notes you know i mean and they don't they won't accept them it says good for all
[3:22:59.000 --> 3:23:04.360]  debt public and private and it's a lie on the back of every printed piece of currency because a lot
[3:23:04.360 --> 3:23:09.560]  of people aren't taking them now and i don't think that's uh meet the letter of the law is that an
[3:23:09.560 --> 3:23:15.800]  interference with my right to trade in commerce i think it is to limit currency and it's clear
[3:23:15.800 --> 3:23:21.480]  in the constitution who prints currency and that there is a printing involved um you know and we
[3:23:21.480 --> 3:23:26.360]  could have alleged or they could assert that maybe electronic is a way of the future but it's not
[3:23:26.360 --> 3:23:31.960]  it's the way of invasiveness you see because it's your digital doorway that once again is being kicked
[3:23:31.960 --> 3:23:41.800]  in by a globalist under this guise of protection and information is the fuel of the financial
[3:23:41.800 --> 3:23:47.480]  world think about how much money is paid for those little bits and pieces of your information
[3:23:47.480 --> 3:23:53.560]  and then how it's used and how it's used is to manipulate you into buying things and voting
[3:23:53.560 --> 3:24:00.680]  for people and to frame your outlook on life and and this is the truth of the matter and it doesn't
[3:24:00.680 --> 3:24:06.040]  take a rocket scientist to figure it out think about how weird it is when you look at your your
[3:24:06.040 --> 3:24:10.840]  internet connections and throwing ads at you that you just thought about looking at you hadn't even
[3:24:10.840 --> 3:24:18.840]  made the query yet because these systems can even anticipate better than you can anticipate what you
[3:24:18.840 --> 3:24:24.680]  might be interested in and send it your way and the higher the data collection the more little bits
[3:24:24.680 --> 3:24:30.360]  and pieces that are gathered together the more transparent you are and they don't need a camera
[3:24:30.920 --> 3:24:36.920]  they just need the data so that's why it's so critical you know my my oldest son is in his
[3:24:36.920 --> 3:24:44.680]  early early 40s and his work has been in this space his entire life all right and he has 150
[3:24:44.680 --> 3:24:50.280]  people working for him on three different continents all right and they do this they build
[3:24:50.280 --> 3:24:57.080]  they build software for everything from banks a little little guys doing websites and what we
[3:24:57.080 --> 3:25:05.880]  know is the amount of data and how it's piped in and collected and sorted now because it can be
[3:25:05.880 --> 3:25:12.520]  and the sort is where it's at and that's where we get the full throttle now I think as Davos
[3:25:12.520 --> 3:25:17.880]  meets again in January and they're going to try this you watch and see between now and January
[3:25:17.880 --> 3:25:22.600]  the chaos that's going to unfold people are going to be screaming protect us save us and
[3:25:22.600 --> 3:25:29.640]  they're going to use it again for an opportunity to try and get this reset meanwhile in Asia
[3:25:29.640 --> 3:25:36.280]  something else is happening in terms of a breakup of the financial system see Swift the Swift system
[3:25:36.280 --> 3:25:41.560]  how we move money around the world in dollars let me tell you how it works because I do move
[3:25:41.560 --> 3:25:47.560]  money around the world in dollars and euros sometimes and here's what happens if I try to
[3:25:47.560 --> 3:25:54.520]  move euros into the US instead of it doing you like to see post to the exchange rates for the day
[3:25:54.520 --> 3:26:00.360]  right and like a two or three dollar fee removing some money from bank a to bank me which is you
[3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:06.520]  know it's a nothing transaction cost a fraction of a cent but here's what they do they move those
[3:26:06.520 --> 3:26:12.680]  euros over into my dollar account and then they rack up seven to eight percent they take off the
[3:26:12.680 --> 3:26:19.640]  top the skim for the banks and it is a skim it's worse than the freaking mob only they call it a
[3:26:19.640 --> 3:26:25.320]  transaction cost to give it a nice name so you don't feel robbed so much so what did I have to do I
[3:26:25.320 --> 3:26:30.920]  had to reroute I have to rethink how I'm doing my banking because I can't sustain an eight percent
[3:26:30.920 --> 3:26:37.000]  service charge for the skim of the banking institutions we had to rethink it but what's
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:42.200]  what happens in the world see they're they give us the illusion why don't these US companies bring
[3:26:42.200 --> 3:26:48.200]  their money back would you bring it back if you had it and off eight percent for the bank no of
[3:26:48.200 --> 3:26:54.840]  course not see this needs to be regulated to something rational because if you want international
[3:26:54.840 --> 3:27:01.640]  trade you got to have a level playing field for little guys who are getting into this import
[3:27:01.640 --> 3:27:07.720]  export you can't unless you have a lot of money to overcome all these obstacles and that is part
[3:27:07.720 --> 3:27:13.400]  of the game you see is to control that so they set up a new system that it was Chinese invented
[3:27:13.400 --> 3:27:19.320]  the world do it the Russians joined them so they can trade in a different basket of currencies
[3:27:19.320 --> 3:27:25.560]  now China I think is our real adversary in this mix and Russia's looking to leverage both sides
[3:27:25.560 --> 3:27:31.160]  against the middle so what are these two countries done they've dumped massive amounts of US
[3:27:31.160 --> 3:27:36.440]  treasuries their dollar holdings and they've replaced them with gold look it up you'll see
[3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:43.000]  they've been stockpiling and buying the base commodities big three copper gold silver for
[3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:49.720]  decades why because they need an alternative because you can create a system that's outside
[3:27:49.720 --> 3:27:54.840]  of the swift system you can do international banking that's why bitcoin off a lot of people
[3:27:54.840 --> 3:28:00.520]  is too erratic you know in terms of pricing you don't have any logical move but you can't you
[3:28:00.520 --> 3:28:04.520]  can't bank that way you got to have a little more stability so what are the Chinese and
[3:28:04.520 --> 3:28:08.840]  Russians doing they're getting out of the dollar they're going to exchange between their currencies
[3:28:08.840 --> 3:28:13.880]  so Russia has huge amount of commodities they can ship south China has a lot of amount of labor
[3:28:13.880 --> 3:28:19.240]  they can add to it and ship back north they'll get what they need and they can cut the dollar out of
[3:28:19.240 --> 3:28:23.160]  the equation and when they do that creates a surplus of dollars and if you don't think there's
[3:28:23.160 --> 3:28:30.520]  a surplus of dollars right now it's headed our way so an alternative in the international world
[3:28:30.520 --> 3:28:35.720]  is coming in terms of how you bank so that's going to create real competition within the
[3:28:35.720 --> 3:28:42.040]  banking system and allow people to sidestep American boycotts American sanctions and have
[3:28:42.040 --> 3:28:46.840]  another way to do business and that's what they're doing because of the way that we do business
[3:28:46.840 --> 3:28:52.200]  I get it I understand everybody's out for their own interest but this is the thing that Donald
[3:28:52.200 --> 3:28:58.040]  Trump defined for America is our interests weren't being protected and as soon as they started being
[3:28:58.040 --> 3:29:05.720]  protected all our allies our long lost friends disappeared think of our european allies for 70
[3:29:05.720 --> 3:29:10.920]  years bailing them out of world war two so they weren't you know nazi bill from coast to coast from
[3:29:10.920 --> 3:29:15.800]  sea to signing sea in europe we stood in the way of that we made sure that didn't happen then we
[3:29:15.800 --> 3:29:20.680]  rebuilt all of europe and then we decided that it's an unfair equation because we're paying for
[3:29:20.680 --> 3:29:26.360]  all their defense or most of their defense I think that is an unfair equation it's allowed them to
[3:29:26.360 --> 3:29:30.680]  have great health care for their citizens that we don't have in this country it's allowed them
[3:29:30.680 --> 3:29:35.400]  to have reasonable cost education which we don't have in this country for college university
[3:29:36.200 --> 3:29:42.360]  because they had the money because we were covering the defense and now they're angry oh
[3:29:42.360 --> 3:29:48.920]  they're mad at us because we're pulling back it's a matter of public policy a matter of where we're
[3:29:48.920 --> 3:29:55.400]  headed and globalists would like to keep the american voices like alex mine and a lot of others
[3:29:55.400 --> 3:30:03.800]  on this network silent because this is the time when truth needs to ring through and these matrix
[3:30:04.520 --> 3:30:09.560]  running organizations that are filtering out our voices they need to be stopped if we're
[3:30:09.560 --> 3:30:15.400]  going to save this republic they need to be stopped there needs to be executive orders to stop them
[3:30:15.400 --> 3:30:20.680]  now because they're interfering with these elections free and fair elections come with a free and fair
[3:30:20.680 --> 3:30:26.040]  media and not a muzzled voice in the land this is dr. nick faggots here the tip of the spear we'll be
[3:30:26.040 --> 3:30:37.320]  right back
[3:30:41.240 --> 3:30:50.600]  vicki gibbs 57 year old lesbian preacher in houston went in with a cough got intubated
[3:30:50.600 --> 3:30:57.000]  and then died and as soon as i saw her face as soon as i saw the report i said watch it'll be
[3:30:57.000 --> 3:31:03.000]  innovation we know what's going to happen it's a blue city the same story yet again and they say
[3:31:03.000 --> 3:31:09.080]  her heart gave out if you put somebody on a breathing tube a covet 19 is a death sentence
[3:31:09.080 --> 3:31:13.400]  it's on record want everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed why are almost
[3:31:13.400 --> 3:31:18.680]  all the deaths happening in blue cities in blue states it's because they intubate them putting
[3:31:18.680 --> 3:31:24.680]  a tube in their lungs and covet 19 is causing an autoimmune response and if you do that with oxygen
[3:31:24.680 --> 3:31:30.440]  the doctors are on record saying it will kill you but all these doctors in blue cities and blue
[3:31:30.440 --> 3:31:36.120]  states follow their orders and the minute i saw this report today i knew what i would be reading
[3:31:36.680 --> 3:31:43.240]  don't end up like vicki gibbs or everyone a lot of you are probably already very familiar with
[3:31:43.240 --> 3:31:49.080]  these terms i'm about to introduce but some folks are so for those that aren't here they are activated
[3:31:49.080 --> 3:31:59.400]  charcoal and then another term enamel safe activated charcoal is the fastest growing type

[3:34:36.920 --> 3:34:59.240]  built on i'm alex jones never surrendered a tyranny info wars.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:59.240 --> 3:35:13.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show with nick baggage and welcome back it's good to
[3:35:13.480 --> 3:35:19.560]  be here on this friday afternoon you know that so much happens in the course of a week and i know
[3:35:19.560 --> 3:35:27.320]  there's a lot of fear in the air i mean i can feel it i mean it's it's gotten to the point for a lot
[3:35:27.320 --> 3:35:34.520]  a lot of people and i know a lot of our listeners are just in a state of of close to panic and i
[3:35:34.520 --> 3:35:43.720]  want to say this is even in the craziest of times we've got to find a breath you know a bit of calm
[3:35:43.720 --> 3:35:50.680]  in it and i know we touch on so many topics here and i don't want to add to that fire of fear i want
[3:35:50.680 --> 3:35:56.600]  to try and tamp it down a bit and that's the whole purpose provide information so at least we kind of
[3:35:56.600 --> 3:36:02.920]  know what's going on we have an opportunity to maybe rethink it a little bit the electronics you
[3:36:02.920 --> 3:36:09.000]  know i've talked about this for again for decades about sort of how we were becoming so dependent
[3:36:09.560 --> 3:36:16.760]  on these systems that they end up trapping us in a system and we are most of us are trapped
[3:36:17.480 --> 3:36:23.400]  to a certain degree that's unavoidable at the moment but we need to analyze how that trap has
[3:36:23.400 --> 3:36:29.640]  been constructed and it's been slow it's not been a quick run but they're now ramping it up because
[3:36:29.640 --> 3:36:35.960]  they feel like they got the cover to the COVID-19 panic i don't think they do i think as things
[3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:41.880]  unfold if the leadership can stand up to it and certainly uh there isn't a christian soul that
[3:36:41.880 --> 3:36:48.760]  i know that'll take a tattoo or a mark to to engage in commerce and and and i would say no
[3:36:48.760 --> 3:36:56.280]  no to that i'm not going to do that to engage in commerce we need to recognize that our bodies
[3:36:57.560 --> 3:37:03.240]  our bodies are not something for the government to tamper with now the u.s supreme court has ruled
[3:37:03.240 --> 3:37:11.480]  on that in the case of women and abortions right but they haven't ruled on that in in the in a
[3:37:11.480 --> 3:37:17.800]  case of somebody getting a involuntary tattoo or an involuntary vaccine and it seems to me that
[3:37:17.800 --> 3:37:26.120]  there's a balance between public risk and privacy that's not been well articulated by the u.s supreme
[3:37:26.120 --> 3:37:32.680]  court first as it relates to commerce and pre-trade should we be should they invade our bodies in
[3:37:32.680 --> 3:37:37.800]  order to engage in commerce and i don't think that's a fair question and certainly we don't
[3:37:37.800 --> 3:37:46.920]  pose the risks to anyone else by engaging with the use of currency and to suggest otherwise
[3:37:46.920 --> 3:37:54.600]  um is really a trap um there there is a way to do this and bitcoin people say oh let's go to the
[3:37:54.600 --> 3:37:59.720]  digital bitcoin because you won't know who's who believe me uh if it's a government institute of
[3:37:59.720 --> 3:38:05.240]  program it will provide a clear roadmap to the chain of title on every currency exchange from
[3:38:05.240 --> 3:38:11.720]  the beginning to the end so no it it creates tracking it's just a question of who has coding
[3:38:11.720 --> 3:38:20.040]  to interpret that tracking the bottom line is um it is all part of again the formation of a matrix
[3:38:20.040 --> 3:38:26.840]  if you control it all then you get it all and and really that's where we're at freedom is is
[3:38:26.840 --> 3:38:34.520]  something that entails a certain amount of risk um that's part of the cost of of a democracy we
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:40.120]  hear a lot of dialogue about gun control in the context of everything else that's being thrown
[3:38:40.120 --> 3:38:46.120]  at us and i think we're going to hear more of that because ultimately tyranny is offset by
[3:38:46.120 --> 3:38:52.680]  a citizen re that's armed you know and i'm not suggesting violence it's just kind of a general
[3:38:52.680 --> 3:38:57.720]  deterrence like having a nuke in the ground you know you know you hope you never have to launch
[3:38:57.720 --> 3:39:03.000]  it right it's a deterrent and the thing that's happening with government is they're overstepping
[3:39:03.560 --> 3:39:09.800]  and they're stepping on our necks every one of us at this point and they're holding us down it's
[3:39:09.800 --> 3:39:18.280]  not about george uh loy being his neck being stepped on that's a really the symbol of what's
[3:39:18.280 --> 3:39:24.920]  going on with government against all of us it's not police brutality it's not any of that but
[3:39:24.920 --> 3:39:32.360]  it's this sense of put a mask on and then what do you think when you're wearing that mask you think
[3:39:32.360 --> 3:39:40.040]  i can't breathe wow isn't that an interesting correlation makes us stop and think because
[3:39:40.040 --> 3:39:46.600]  patterning of the mind requires a repetition what are done what do you say to yourself you're
[3:39:46.600 --> 3:39:51.560]  complying again you're falling in line you're staying in the square at school whatever it is
[3:39:52.280 --> 3:40:00.040]  this is uh the deal right now is change the way we think give a whole new way of being that we
[3:40:00.040 --> 3:40:08.520]  accept this sort of group think group being um and and allow them to put us at each other's throat
[3:40:08.520 --> 3:40:18.920]  over a mask really over all of this that's happening right now just to amplify that fear and then
[3:40:18.920 --> 3:40:25.800]  just keep pushing the herd along and that's what's happening personal privacy is not just that state
[3:40:25.800 --> 3:40:33.080]  whether we ever have it again or not is is what we're talking about i some of you know i engaged
[3:40:33.080 --> 3:40:40.440]  in this local activity regarding the the homeless issue when i used data in that and because of
[3:40:40.440 --> 3:40:49.080]  the consultants i used and we looked at what they were doing and i went whoa i really i don't like
[3:40:49.080 --> 3:40:57.640]  this i don't like this i don't like the idea that i can go and capture everything that facebook is
[3:40:57.640 --> 3:41:04.840]  doing in my community that i can isolate that audience that i can tailor ads and disperse
[3:41:04.840 --> 3:41:11.160]  them into that audience or through google's networks and and do that i don't i don't like that um
[3:41:12.200 --> 3:41:18.040]  we did that on on this campaign i all confess it because i really believe that's what's required
[3:41:18.040 --> 3:41:21.960]  i won't do it again i don't think it's the right way but i know that every campaign
[3:41:23.720 --> 3:41:29.960]  every effort that's being thrown at you in this election season is using this kind of data and
[3:41:29.960 --> 3:41:36.920]  manipulating it to push you along and this is the problem they're trying to push you along
[3:41:37.880 --> 3:41:41.880]  and every time they throw a poll let you on the internet and say hey click here click there
[3:41:41.880 --> 3:41:47.240]  click this click that don't do it anymore you're just surrendering you're kicking open your door
[3:41:47.240 --> 3:41:54.280]  forum don't do it anymore you want to screw up polling don't respond to polling don't give them
[3:41:54.280 --> 3:41:58.520]  the wrong if you give them no information when they lay out the demographics they look at all
[3:41:58.520 --> 3:42:03.400]  the voter profiles and they set up phone numbers they're going to call so they get a representative
[3:42:03.400 --> 3:42:09.560]  sampling from all those profiles if people don't give them the data they can't develop the data
[3:42:09.560 --> 3:42:14.760]  and use it against you that's why they were 16 points off in the last presidential election
[3:42:14.760 --> 3:42:20.520]  and everyone forgets because now they're leaning in these stupid ass polls again and they are
[3:42:21.320 --> 3:42:28.040]  dumb dumb dumb dumb because they're not accurate they're missing too many people and those of us
[3:42:28.040 --> 3:42:33.480]  that are smart enough to quit participating are quitting participating don't volunteer any more
[3:42:33.480 --> 3:42:39.160]  than they're already taken from i hope to god the next administration and if it's democrats it'll
[3:42:39.160 --> 3:42:46.200]  never happen i hope to god there's time for us to take our data back that this president through
[3:42:46.200 --> 3:42:50.520]  executive order could shut all that down right now and make it illegal for them to do what they're
[3:42:50.520 --> 3:42:59.240]  doing something has to happen the steps that are being taken now are the ones that are the biggest
[3:42:59.240 --> 3:43:05.960]  steps against this country's individual sovereignty that have ever been taken in our entire history
[3:43:05.960 --> 3:43:12.600]  the war that's been waged not a bullet has been fired you know and you look at how they've used
[3:43:12.600 --> 3:43:18.600]  russia and china as the boogeyman to get us to give up more oh no they're invading our elections
[3:43:18.600 --> 3:43:23.800]  what are we going to do and sure they're going to try why wouldn't they try we do it too we do it

[3:43:29.960 --> 3:43:35.400]  been fractured and split off into new companies i don't know how many but they they did something
[3:43:35.400 --> 3:43:40.280]  this is it this is the book that brought it all to light targeted there were other things that
[3:43:40.280 --> 3:43:47.720]  brought it to light too but there's such a precision over 60 governments elections around the world
[3:43:47.720 --> 3:43:54.200]  were influenced by this one group alone and now they're splattered all over the place and all
[3:43:54.200 --> 3:44:01.640]  these collectors of data that aggregate that data to manipulate all of us into doing things that
[3:44:01.640 --> 3:44:08.840]  otherwise we wouldn't do so what is the solution stay tuned to info wars as long as we're here to
[3:44:08.840 --> 3:44:15.400]  give you information look at the alternative medias that are out there and really look at the opposite
