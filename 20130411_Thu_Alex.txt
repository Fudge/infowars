[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:10.400 --> 00:12.080]  Big brother.
[00:12.080 --> 00:13.800]  Mainstream media.
[00:13.800 --> 00:16.320]  Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[00:16.800 --> 00:23.200]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now,
[00:23.460 --> 00:25.460]  live from Austin, Texas,
[00:25.460 --> 00:30.460]  Alex Jones.
[00:39.180 --> 00:45.740]  Okay, folks. We have got another obviously incredibly important broadcast as the world just gets crazier and crazier
[00:46.380 --> 00:53.260]  by the minute. I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be live here, Lord willing, for the next three hours.
[00:53.260 --> 00:57.580]  The news websites are infowars.com and, of course,
[00:58.020 --> 01:01.980]  prisonplanet.com, streaming video at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:04.220 --> 01:06.660]  I woke up at about 3 a.m. last night
[01:09.580 --> 01:13.340]  just gripped with conviction to warn people.
[01:14.060 --> 01:18.860]  And I didn't really have an epiphany or what you'd call a vision. It was more of a crystallization
[01:18.860 --> 01:26.100]  of the technocratic system that's being established and
[01:28.180 --> 01:32.100]  really, their entire master plan and what is being established.
[01:34.020 --> 01:37.860]  And so what I'm going to do here today is
[01:39.820 --> 01:43.380]  open the phones up in the first hour on North Korea, the Second Amendment,
[01:43.380 --> 01:50.180]  the state saying your children belong to them, and that you're an extremist if you don't believe the state controls the children and owns the children.
[01:51.220 --> 01:55.940]  I want to have a discussion about the overall authoritarianism that's coming in like a flood
[01:56.820 --> 02:00.540]  in an attempt to overwhelm us and then ridicule us
[02:02.300 --> 02:05.340]  so that we're off balance and basically accept
[02:05.340 --> 02:12.140]  the destruction of our republic, the destruction of our wealth, and our journey towards slavery being completed.
[02:13.140 --> 02:21.580]  And I'm going to try to focus my mind today because the reason I don't really get into the globalist master plan completely
[02:22.100 --> 02:29.260]  is that it is such a large compendium of information
[02:29.260 --> 02:38.300]  that it is hard to describe to people the full depth of it and how the dialectics work, but, I mean, a lot of it's very, very simple.
[02:39.300 --> 02:49.300]  There is a scientific elite that's mopping up pockets of resistance nationally, worldwide, taking over countries, they have them under economic or military or both, siege.
[02:49.300 --> 03:11.300]  They want to end humanity as it's known, and they've already chosen the evolutionary curve of humanity, they believe, towards an end of humanity as we know it, and a new species of limited supermen that have merged with new genetic manifestations and the cybernetic interfaces.
[03:11.300 --> 03:31.300]  And they openly, I mean, it's everywhere, fantasize and popularize and engage in predictive programming to sell the idea of this is a foregone conclusion and that some type of heavenly existence, utopian, anti-characterism,
[03:31.300 --> 03:45.780]  that some type of heavenly existence, utopian anti-dystopia will manifest.
[03:45.780 --> 03:50.940]  But if you look at what they're really building, it is a complete and total dystopia of the
[03:50.940 --> 03:53.420]  highest magnitude.
[03:53.420 --> 04:03.360]  So I'm going to attempt to break it down today.
[04:03.360 --> 04:13.980]  And this program is so evidenced, it is so 100% on record that it dizzies my mind that
[04:13.980 --> 04:17.700]  we're even having a debate about this.
[04:17.700 --> 04:25.140]  The establishment is moving forward with an accelerated timetable for several reasons.
[04:25.140 --> 04:30.820]  They're about 10 years behind in their projections, and they've looked forward that if they don't
[04:30.820 --> 04:35.180]  accelerate the program, their operation will fail.
[04:35.180 --> 04:43.140]  But they have succeeded in their greatest goal of creating an artificial habitat civilization
[04:43.140 --> 04:48.980]  with government and corporate reservations that are breakaway civilizations several steps
[04:48.980 --> 04:52.260]  above us.
[04:52.260 --> 04:56.740]  So that's what they've got over us is that we are now in a fishbowl.
[04:56.740 --> 05:06.540]  But we can build civilizations out of their program if we realize the matrix.
[05:06.540 --> 05:11.260]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security
[05:11.260 --> 05:16.020]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[05:16.020 --> 05:19.940]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[05:19.940 --> 05:20.940]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[05:20.940 --> 05:25.880]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[08:21.860 --> 08:28.340]  traveling patriots worldwide.
[08:28.340 --> 08:32.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:32.700 --> 08:40.020]  It is April 11th, 2013 on this Thursday edition.
[08:40.020 --> 08:42.660]  We've got a very important broadcast lined up.
[08:42.660 --> 08:48.100]  We're going to have updates from the head of gun owners of America, Larry Pratt, at
[08:48.100 --> 08:52.700]  the bottom of the next hour, or at the start of the next hour, he's going to be popping
[08:52.700 --> 08:54.540]  in with us.
[08:54.540 --> 09:03.700]  Then at the bottom of the next hour, I will break down the most chilling information that
[09:03.700 --> 09:11.860]  we have ever covered here on this broadcast, and it's all publicly available.
[09:11.860 --> 09:19.340]  And it deals with the technocrats, the Anglo-American eugenicist elite, and their own statements,
[09:19.340 --> 09:24.980]  their own plans, and what they've done before.
[09:24.980 --> 09:31.640]  What they do when they have full control of a country.
[09:31.640 --> 09:37.820]  What they do when they have full control of a country.
[09:37.820 --> 09:43.500]  What they do when they have full control of children.
[09:43.500 --> 09:48.500]  Because if you want absolute proof of what their goal is, what their plan is, you don't
[09:48.500 --> 09:52.440]  just have to go read the books they've written, admitting they plan to exterminate the majority
[09:52.440 --> 09:57.140]  of us once world government is fully in place, and they incrementally cut the resources off
[09:57.140 --> 10:01.860]  while posing as the saviors during the deepening crises.
[10:01.860 --> 10:07.500]  It's all about crisis management strategies of tension.
[10:07.500 --> 10:17.340]  I have received out of the National Archives restricted Bilderberg documents.
[10:17.340 --> 10:23.020]  I've talked to former heads of Special Forces Command.
[10:23.020 --> 10:26.740]  They all know what's going on.
[10:26.740 --> 10:34.220]  And the plan is to destroy the family, shut off the resources, and bring in a global medical
[10:34.220 --> 10:41.020]  tyranny and then if you fight back against the white coated exterminators, Nazis use
[10:41.020 --> 10:48.700]  them first, Soviets use them first, then they're backed up by paramilitary death squads.
[10:48.700 --> 10:56.580]  And we know the exact formulae, not even reverse engineered, this is all out in the open as
[10:56.580 --> 11:00.820]  a mosaic of actions, white papers, and statements.
[11:00.820 --> 11:06.020]  I mean, they just released a bunch of WikiLeaks documents and Kissinger has not denied them
[11:06.020 --> 11:08.840]  and the government has said they're real.
[11:08.840 --> 11:14.740]  And what did Bradley Manning, who was part of releasing him, say?
[11:14.740 --> 11:22.020]  He said, it's like the establishment is a kid with a magnifying glass burning ants.
[11:22.020 --> 11:28.220]  Well, that's how HG Wells described in his allegory War of the Worlds, which he later
[11:28.220 --> 11:31.940]  wrote books about saying is what the elites want to do to us.
[11:31.940 --> 11:33.900]  They are the machines.
[11:33.900 --> 11:35.200]  They are the Morlocks.
[11:35.200 --> 11:38.000]  We are the Eloid.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.300]  Same allegory over and over again, same story over and over again.
[11:41.300 --> 11:45.900]  Member of the Fabian Socialists, top globalist, part of the inter-eugenics cult, wrote the
[11:45.900 --> 11:49.700]  book The New World Order.
[11:49.700 --> 12:00.300]  He said that they were going to bring in this world government and that they were then going
[12:00.300 --> 12:07.800]  to exterminate us, for our own good, of course.
[12:07.800 --> 12:14.640]  And there's a new Bilderberg Group report out at infowars.com right now where the president
[12:14.640 --> 12:26.000]  of the Italian Supreme Court, very famous individual, has now come out and said that
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.380]  the government has all of the documentation.
[12:29.380 --> 12:33.980]  And Italian intelligence has all the documentation that every time Italy tries to get out from
[12:33.980 --> 12:42.440]  under the EU or the globalist system, terror attacks are staged by the Bilderberg Group.
[12:42.440 --> 12:46.580]  It says secretive group was involved in strategy of tension.
[12:46.580 --> 12:53.520]  And what does Kissinger say in the new WikiLeaks documents?
[12:53.520 --> 13:08.100]  He says the illegal stuff we do now, the unconstitutional we have to do later.
[13:08.100 --> 13:13.860]  Really devastating, and going back to H.G. Wells, he described how the establishment
[13:13.860 --> 13:17.920]  sees us as amoebas in a Petri dish.
[13:17.920 --> 13:25.540]  And they're coldly and scientifically studying us, watching with a cold gaze with what they
[13:25.540 --> 13:27.580]  plan to do to us.
[13:27.580 --> 13:32.500]  And they do it with the so-called water you drink, with all the poisons and pharmaceuticals
[13:32.500 --> 13:40.920]  in it, and the hydrofluorosolic acid that's an adjuvant, hyper turbo charging all the
[13:40.920 --> 13:42.980]  other poisons.
[13:42.980 --> 13:49.180]  And it's in State Department Random 200, it's in John P. Holdren's book, Ecoscience.
[13:49.180 --> 13:54.300]  It's in hundreds of publications, Club of Rome, all in my film Endgame, screenshots
[13:54.300 --> 13:58.400]  of their newspaper that they send to members how they're doing this to us.
[13:58.400 --> 14:00.240]  And it's funny to them.
[14:00.240 --> 14:08.780]  And I'm supposed to just sit here while they're doing this to us and think it's funny.
[14:08.780 --> 14:13.040]  Or go join the establishment and play the part of a mainline Republican like Rush Limbaugh
[14:13.040 --> 14:17.120]  or Glenn Beck.
[14:17.120 --> 14:27.680]  And just have a extended last meal, I guess, over the next decade or so.
[14:27.680 --> 14:35.020]  And just watch society rot and I'll just sit back in a genteel way and watch my children's
[14:35.020 --> 14:37.780]  entire future destroyed by madmen.
[14:37.780 --> 14:40.660]  I'm gonna explain this again.
[14:40.660 --> 14:47.420]  The people that run the New World Order are the people that created the Soviets and the
[14:47.420 --> 14:51.500]  Nazis and the Maoists.
[14:51.500 --> 14:58.920]  And Pol Pot, who was, again, quote, fighting the communists, they don't care as long as
[14:58.920 --> 15:07.980]  humanity is attacked and destroyed and butchered and defaced.
[15:07.980 --> 15:13.820]  These globalists compete with each other over who is the most vicious.
[15:13.820 --> 15:17.300]  And there are real torture camps by the hundreds.
[15:17.300 --> 15:18.780]  This has now been released by WikiLeaks.
[15:18.780 --> 15:19.780]  We already knew this.
[15:19.780 --> 15:21.360]  This has already come out.
[15:21.360 --> 15:28.380]  But it just further confirms that the Army's own report from 2007, the Tugumbu report.
[15:28.380 --> 15:40.000]  General Tugumbu is a rare moment of the schizophrenic Pentagon going, this program resulted in children
[15:40.000 --> 15:52.360]  being raped in front of their parents with battery acid and large objects.
[15:52.360 --> 15:54.060]  Go read it.
[15:54.060 --> 15:56.680]  That's just one footnote.
[15:56.680 --> 15:59.520]  And the Pentagon's like, we shouldn't do this.
[15:59.520 --> 16:04.000]  And then they pull back with the program because there's a moment of, whoa, we're really super
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.000]  evil.
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.000]  Whoa, Dr. Mengele.
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.460]  And by the way, these weren't even real al-Qaeda terrorists.
[16:10.460 --> 16:12.260]  They publicly work for the globalist.
[16:12.260 --> 16:15.980]  I have a stack of news I'm gonna get to after Larry Pratt leaves us at the bottom of the
[16:15.980 --> 16:20.100]  next hour to just show you what the technocrats are doing.
[16:20.100 --> 16:22.500]  They're seeing what military will follow orders.
[16:22.500 --> 16:24.940]  They're seeing what contractors will follow orders.
[16:24.940 --> 16:28.420]  These are all tests, cuz the devil mimics God.
[16:28.420 --> 16:35.580]  This whole world's a test for God or his people, but the devil tests his people.
[16:35.580 --> 16:41.780]  And if you don't believe in the devil, I mean, what is the good guys torturing people's kids?
[16:41.780 --> 16:47.020]  And then they have, I mean, I picked up a law enforcement magazine at a 7-11 13 years
[16:47.020 --> 16:49.920]  ago back in 99, I read it on air.
[16:49.920 --> 16:54.900]  And it was a whole scenario for police about do you torture a terrorist's son to find out
[16:54.900 --> 16:58.420]  where the anthrax bombs are that are gonna go off in New York.
[16:58.420 --> 17:05.560]  And the intelligence operative teaches the SWAT team guys, the SWAT team magazine, teaches
[17:05.560 --> 17:10.120]  them yes, you do, the end justifies the means.
[17:10.120 --> 17:13.580]  I mean, just pure twist your mind.
[17:13.580 --> 17:17.400]  And cops out there all listening going, yeah, I've seen that, I've heard that.
[17:17.400 --> 17:21.500]  Because I see that about a third of the time, I just randomly pick up a law enforcement
[17:21.500 --> 17:24.240]  magazine.
[17:24.240 --> 17:34.400]  And just open it, it's just pure evil, page after page of just absolute evil.
[17:34.400 --> 17:38.820]  Last time I picked one up a few years ago, I opened it up and it was a article written
[17:38.820 --> 17:43.360]  talking about Dallas saying, if you see somebody with a get out of the UN sticker on their
[17:43.360 --> 17:44.860]  car, go ahead and bring them in.
[17:44.860 --> 17:49.380]  And police chiefs, go ahead and back your officers, find some reason to charge them
[17:49.380 --> 17:53.500]  with something cuz these are extremists that wanna kill cops.
[17:53.500 --> 17:59.140]  And then you go out and treat patriots like they're bad guys, they go, you're a bad guy.
[17:59.140 --> 18:01.620]  See how you're like two fighting fish put in the same tank?
[18:01.620 --> 18:12.640]  And the globalists sit back going, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, full spectrum dominance.
[18:12.640 --> 18:17.040]  Waylon Jennings' son is gonna be in studio with a shooter Jennings.
[18:17.040 --> 18:19.700]  I've never met him in person, talked to him on the phone quite a bit.
[18:19.700 --> 18:22.420]  He's a big fan of Listerine, I'm a big fan of his work.
[18:22.420 --> 18:24.500]  I wouldn't lie to you, I wasn't a fan of his work.
[18:24.500 --> 18:27.340]  I wouldn't even care about talking to him just cuz he's Waylon Jennings' son.
[18:27.340 --> 18:31.260]  One of my favorite outlaw country singers, one of my favorite period.
[18:31.260 --> 18:40.980]  Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Chris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, the highwaymen, there they
[18:40.980 --> 18:41.980]  are.
[18:41.980 --> 18:44.700]  His music is just amazing.
[18:44.700 --> 18:47.060]  And he wrote The Summer of Rage a few years ago.
[18:47.060 --> 18:51.180]  It's in our film Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, which we all use for bumper music.
[18:51.180 --> 18:56.020]  I mean, it is a five star song.
[18:56.020 --> 18:57.020]  And really powerful.
[18:57.020 --> 19:02.980]  It's about looking into his child's eyes, realizing that you can't just deny all this
[19:02.980 --> 19:03.980]  is happening.
[19:03.980 --> 19:05.500]  You've got to say no to it.
[19:05.500 --> 19:08.280]  The good in the world has to stand up and say no.
[19:08.280 --> 19:11.220]  He's gonna be popping in here in the third hour.
[19:11.220 --> 19:13.340]  We're gonna play some of his new album, premiering it here.
[19:13.340 --> 19:21.100]  His new tour starts, I guess tonight, in New Braunfels, or is it down San Marcos, just
[19:21.100 --> 19:22.100]  north of there, yeah.
[19:22.100 --> 19:25.460]  So he kicks his new tour and album off here today.
[19:25.460 --> 19:31.220]  Look forward to meeting him in person.
[19:31.220 --> 19:36.500]  Just some good old boys, never meaning no harm, been in trouble with the law since the
[19:36.500 --> 19:39.940]  day they were born.
[19:39.940 --> 19:46.460]  I'm just a good old boy, you know my mama loves me.
[19:46.460 --> 19:50.200]  That's what it's all about, loving your children and your mama loving you.
[19:50.200 --> 19:52.060]  You know I'm a good old boy.
[19:52.060 --> 19:54.300]  You know my mama loves me.
[19:54.300 --> 19:55.620]  And that's what's wrong in the world.
[19:55.620 --> 20:00.020]  Most of these evil people came from evil families where their mama didn't love them.
[20:00.020 --> 20:01.020]  You know what?
[20:01.020 --> 20:07.860]  My mama loves me, and your mama loves you, and we're gonna stand up for the children.
[20:07.860 --> 20:09.580]  Time and time again.
[20:09.580 --> 20:12.140]  You need to come here and help us.
[20:12.140 --> 20:14.500]  We need assistance, please.
[20:14.500 --> 20:17.980]  Those we should be able to depend on, let us down.
[20:17.980 --> 20:22.480]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in
[20:22.480 --> 20:24.540]  Bell Harbor say show me.
[20:24.540 --> 20:27.000]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[21:35.540 --> 21:39.740]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[21:39.740 --> 21:43.980]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[21:43.980 --> 21:44.980]  to service debt.
[21:44.980 --> 21:48.540]  Is capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[21:48.540 --> 21:51.860]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[21:51.860 --> 21:52.860]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[21:52.860 --> 21:56.100]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[22:10.740 --> 22:14.800]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[22:14.800 --> 22:18.560]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.

[23:05.660 --> 23:09.740]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[23:09.740 --> 23:14.820]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops
[23:14.820 --> 23:15.820]  alone.
[23:15.820 --> 23:19.440]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[23:19.440 --> 23:23.300]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[23:23.300 --> 23:24.700]  The fact is you are.

[23:25.860 --> 23:28.060]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[24:02.820 --> 24:13.060]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[24:13.060 --> 24:32.500]  So here we are as usual held hostage by other crazy
[24:32.500 --> 24:39.300]  government that it turns out has been meeting in secret with the U.S. government.
[24:39.300 --> 24:43.740]  The globalists are so criminal they may have even been paying Kim and Jong-un to do all
[24:43.740 --> 24:47.540]  of this so they can sell more weapons systems to South Korea and others.
[24:47.540 --> 24:51.500]  That's pretty much what Dr. Steve Pachinik is saying is going on and you're like, well,
[24:51.500 --> 24:52.500]  what's the proof of that?
[24:52.500 --> 24:57.940]  Well, ABB headed up by Rumsfeld, the same guy that got Aspartame approved and so many
[24:57.940 --> 24:59.660]  other horrible things.
[24:59.660 --> 25:05.500]  He transferred the reactors and they said, why is the UN authorizing and why is Clinton
[25:05.500 --> 25:11.380]  authorizing the Swiss company headed up by Rumsfeld at the time?
[25:11.380 --> 25:14.780]  They put him on the board and make him the president for a year or CEO, then they get
[25:14.780 --> 25:22.420]  the approval and then he transfers the reactors to them that allow you to make the fissile
[25:22.420 --> 25:30.500]  material to enrich, is the proper term, the fissile material to then make atomic bombs.
[25:30.500 --> 25:40.980]  1945 technology, it'll still vaporize your city and now we're sitting there where they
[25:40.980 --> 25:46.780]  have A-bombs that the globalists essentially gave them and no one remembers cuz no one
[25:46.780 --> 25:47.940]  even knew at the time.
[25:47.940 --> 25:50.500]  No one pays attention to stuff like that.
[25:50.500 --> 25:57.260]  I was following it, I was first on radio and TV, 95, 96 and covered on the air.
[25:57.260 --> 26:03.140]  I was like, why is this Swiss company and it happened 96, 97, 98, 99, this one for like
[26:03.140 --> 26:08.780]  five, six years, transferring reactors to them and the fissile material that they could
[26:08.780 --> 26:10.820]  then enrich.
[26:10.820 --> 26:15.140]  Just like our so-called government is putting Al Qaeda in Libya and Syria and it's all over
[26:15.140 --> 26:22.220]  the news today, US expected to increase aid to Syrian rebels, AP, including Al Qaeda.
[26:22.220 --> 26:27.180]  Washington Post, Al Qaeda in Iraq formally unites with powerful Syrian militant group
[26:27.180 --> 26:30.100]  funded by the US government and NATO.
[26:30.100 --> 26:35.940]  America's hired death squads and torture teams are still operating in Iraq, over 150,000.
[26:35.940 --> 26:39.660]  And they're just disappearing whole families, killing people, torturing, murdering, they're
[26:39.660 --> 26:41.580]  just contractors now.
[26:41.580 --> 26:50.940]  And again, this is an army, build me an army worthy of Mordor.
[26:50.940 --> 26:57.620]  Fighting Uruk-hai, tonight you will feast on man flesh.
[26:57.620 --> 27:02.580]  I mean, they are over there doing unspeakable hellish stuff.
[27:02.580 --> 27:10.500]  I mean, it's intensifying 20, 30, 40 times what Saddam did, 200 camps alone in Iraq,
[27:10.500 --> 27:19.340]  giant CIA command fortresses filled with thousands, sending forth the black armored vehicles that
[27:19.340 --> 27:22.340]  grab the families.
[27:22.340 --> 27:28.620]  Flying them out, black sites all over the world, 200 estimated in Iraq in these WikiLeaks
[27:28.620 --> 27:30.900]  documents.
[27:30.900 --> 27:42.020]  Birds in Poland, and Romania, and Ukraine, and Georgia, and Jordan, and Israel, and now
[27:42.020 --> 27:47.780]  they found black sites in the US.
[27:47.780 --> 27:52.420]  And of course, while they're at it with the CIA aircraft flying drugs in, and you guessed
[27:52.420 --> 27:58.980]  it, little kids, little kids, little pigs, little pigs, let me in.
[27:58.980 --> 28:09.060]  Not by the hair of our chinny chin chin, then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll moo.
[28:09.060 --> 28:14.340]  You are house down.
[28:14.340 --> 28:20.300]  Just total savage murder, where you are seen like a steak at the supermarket by these people.
[28:20.300 --> 28:29.820]  I mean, you don't even enter their club unless you can slowly torture a child to death.
[28:29.820 --> 28:42.980]  But let's turn our guns into these people, they're nice.
[28:42.980 --> 28:46.020]  Al-Qaeda has always worked for the New World Order.
[28:46.020 --> 28:49.800]  Before it was called Al-Qaeda, British intelligence, Lawrence of Arabia, look it up.
[28:49.800 --> 28:54.420]  It's all there, but they think you're stupid.
[28:54.420 --> 28:58.540]  And so I've really analyzed this, I've sat back and I've said I hate Kim Jong-un, I just
[28:58.540 --> 29:03.140]  hate scum, hereditary dictators feeding on everyone, I feel for those people.
[29:03.140 --> 29:07.100]  But you can't take him out, because I'm telling you, above the US government, above NATO,
[29:07.100 --> 29:11.660]  above the Chai Comm government, there is the international crime order, and they've written
[29:11.660 --> 29:13.720]  books about it.
[29:13.720 --> 29:17.960]  There's the corporate super class that just uses governments, and they're exempt from
[29:17.960 --> 29:18.960]  everything.
[29:18.960 --> 29:22.380]  They don't want them out of community, they can do whatever they want.
[29:22.380 --> 29:28.540]  Drug dealing, sex slaves, snuff porn, the UN's constantly caught and doesn't get in
[29:28.540 --> 29:29.540]  trouble.
[29:29.540 --> 29:36.020]  This is evil, because it's evil people animating government and major corporations, and channeling
[29:36.020 --> 29:37.620]  their dark force through it.
[29:37.620 --> 29:41.900]  And then we're just here, you're the authorities, do whatever you want, not resisting it.
[29:41.900 --> 29:48.940]  And it is now getting up on its legs, energizing, preparing for a mass orgy like Hitler or Stalin.
[29:48.940 --> 29:51.820]  Or Mao.
[29:51.820 --> 29:55.660]  Lying down to it will let them win.
[29:55.660 --> 29:59.340]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:59.340 --> 30:06.100]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:06.100 --> 30:10.980]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a
[30:10.980 --> 30:13.180]  pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving.
[30:13.180 --> 30:18.280]  And my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[30:18.280 --> 30:22.460]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[30:22.460 --> 30:28.140]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[30:28.140 --> 30:31.200]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[30:31.200 --> 30:37.500]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[30:37.500 --> 30:41.660]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need.
[30:41.660 --> 30:45.480]  And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[32:15.180 --> 32:17.860]  It really says that the state is God.
[32:17.860 --> 32:22.380]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[32:22.380 --> 32:23.620]  on earth.

[33:27.980 --> 33:43.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, the head of the Italian Supreme Court who was privy to government
[33:43.580 --> 33:48.420]  documents, the former head of their CIA has also gone public, says the Bilderberg Group
[33:48.420 --> 33:54.620]  is specifically staging terror attacks all over Europe and the world to destroy national
[33:54.620 --> 34:01.220]  sovereignty and keep national governments under the control of a private banking cartel.
[34:01.220 --> 34:03.820]  And he says he specifically has the documents.
[34:03.820 --> 34:10.060]  The former head of their CIA, who's extremely famous and revered in the country, has come
[34:10.060 --> 34:14.800]  out and apologized to the Italian people and said that he knew it when he got into intelligence
[34:14.800 --> 34:16.340]  a few years after it happened.
[34:16.340 --> 34:20.900]  But the Bologna bombing and other major bombings all over Italy that killed hundreds and hundreds
[34:20.900 --> 34:24.820]  of citizens, well, one of them killed over 170 people, the Bologna bombing, including
[34:24.820 --> 34:31.780]  a bunch of children, was carried out by, get ready for it, get ready for it, US Special
[34:31.780 --> 34:32.780]  Forces.
[34:32.780 --> 34:41.940]  Of course, I mean, I have a Black Ops Special Forces manual that WikiLeaks released four
[34:41.940 --> 34:43.980]  years ago, it's online.
[34:43.980 --> 34:47.860]  The Pentagon admits it's real and says we're gonna arrest whoever released this, well,
[34:47.860 --> 34:51.820]  they say it's Bradley Manning.
[34:51.820 --> 34:58.620]  And they admit it's real, and in there it says, in the manual, you need to go take our
[34:58.620 --> 35:04.660]  classified course in false flag to win over indigenous populations.
[35:04.660 --> 35:06.660]  And what's a false flag?
[35:06.660 --> 35:12.620]  I've talked to Special Forces about it, this is some of the stuff that was done in Vietnam.
[35:12.620 --> 35:15.460]  And of course, most of these guys come back and end up committing suicide or they become
[35:15.460 --> 35:17.500]  preachers and repent to God.
[35:17.500 --> 35:22.100]  But you go down to the water and you find a little kid who's out there playing by the
[35:22.100 --> 35:24.740]  side of the river and you hang him.
[35:24.740 --> 35:30.300]  And then you leave paraphernalia of the Viet Cong there.
[35:30.300 --> 35:36.860]  And that's what Colonel Kurtz and Apocalypse Now is all about, where he talks about the
[35:36.860 --> 35:38.420]  Viet Cong doing stuff like that.
[35:38.420 --> 35:43.780]  They took the inoculations, and so the Viet Cong come in and chop off all the little kid's
[35:43.780 --> 35:44.780]  arms.
[35:44.780 --> 35:48.180]  And he says, these weren't crazed men, these weren't men that were doing it to be evil.
[35:48.180 --> 35:53.260]  They did it because they were focused, they did it because they love their families.
[35:53.260 --> 35:54.580]  That's not really true.
[35:54.580 --> 35:59.140]  You see, we go beyond Kurtz here, that's a lie, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:59.140 --> 36:04.220]  And of course, that story is a composite of some true events that happened.
[36:04.220 --> 36:09.100]  And that's not even really publicly disclosed, but I know the people involved in it.
[36:09.100 --> 36:16.340]  Now that's the reality, ladies and gentlemen, and if you think raping somebody's kid in
[36:16.340 --> 36:20.460]  front of their parents to get them to tell you where the insurgents are in Iraq is good,
[36:20.460 --> 36:23.460]  then I'm evil.
[36:23.460 --> 36:29.260]  And if you think, and the truth is they hired a bunch of former fired federal jail guards
[36:29.260 --> 36:33.280]  to go run many of the prisons that have military under them who had already been caught doing
[36:33.280 --> 36:34.740]  stuff like this.
[36:34.740 --> 36:36.260]  They like to do it.
[36:36.260 --> 36:41.460]  And I said I'd cover this at the bottom of the next hour, I'm gonna get into what they're
[36:41.460 --> 36:42.940]  really planning.
[36:42.940 --> 36:48.320]  Because I want everybody out there to really know what you're signing on to.
[36:48.320 --> 36:52.620]  It's gotten pretty outrageous, hasn't it, where they come out in mainstream media and
[36:52.620 --> 36:57.680]  say yeah, all Catholics are with Al-Qaeda, they are extremists, in army training manuals
[36:57.680 --> 36:59.820]  for gun confiscation in America.
[36:59.820 --> 37:01.280]  That's now in the major news.
[37:01.280 --> 37:06.140]  The state police in Colorado have gone public and sheriffs going, we're given training manuals
[37:06.140 --> 37:10.260]  that, say, prepare to confiscate Christian's guns that they're gonna uprise.
[37:10.260 --> 37:15.900]  Well, yeah, when you try to collectivize everybody's kids after the nuke goes off and after the
[37:15.900 --> 37:21.340]  economy collapses, and the only answer is to live in government factory dormitories
[37:21.340 --> 37:26.580]  like malcollectivize in the great leap forward, this is all planned.
[37:26.580 --> 37:28.660]  And of course there's gonna be a civil war.
[37:28.660 --> 37:31.140]  People are going to not turn their guns in, police.
[37:31.140 --> 37:36.080]  I mean, you're scared of a few people that are sick of being pushed around?
[37:36.080 --> 37:40.060]  You're scared you have to pull people over now and make a little money or whatever?
[37:40.060 --> 37:44.080]  Do you understand what's gonna happen?
[37:44.080 --> 37:48.620]  And by the way, I've analyzed their entire attack strategy and profile.
[37:48.620 --> 37:50.180]  I mean, I'm just so immersed in this.
[37:50.180 --> 37:53.220]  I woke up at 3 AM last night not really dreaming.
[37:53.220 --> 38:00.260]  I woke up and couldn't go back to sleep because I just sat there in the dark for hours in
[38:00.260 --> 38:04.100]  the living room just with such clarity.
[38:04.100 --> 38:10.420]  This is unbelievable, and I see the whole plan because it's all there.
[38:10.420 --> 38:17.020]  It's not like I'm reaching out into some crystal ball and finding this 800-259-9231.
[38:17.020 --> 38:21.660]  I wanna get your take first time callers on just everything, the craziness of the world
[38:21.660 --> 38:26.620]  800-259-9231.
[38:26.620 --> 38:29.740]  Now listen, it doesn't mean their plan has to happen.
[38:29.740 --> 38:31.260]  We've already held them back ten years.
[38:31.260 --> 38:34.300]  So they're accelerating their timetable.
[38:34.300 --> 38:38.980]  Because in their own words, Brzezinski's and others, they can see the trajectory that they're
[38:38.980 --> 38:40.460]  getting behind.
[38:40.460 --> 38:43.140]  And so if they don't accelerate, they're not gonna pull out.
[38:43.140 --> 38:46.020]  They see liberty as a gravitational pull.
[38:46.020 --> 38:50.260]  Just as tyranny has its own pull, the more powerful it gets, the more unstoppable.
[38:50.260 --> 38:57.140]  They see our momentum building and the distrust of them building enough to have an event horizon.
[38:57.140 --> 39:02.100]  Just as the Bongino, the Secret Service agent said, he said in his spirit, he couldn't sit
[39:02.100 --> 39:05.100]  there while Obama was collectivizing all these kids.
[39:05.100 --> 39:09.820]  He physically making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, a senior guy leading the
[39:09.820 --> 39:15.440]  details all over the world, rock star in the federal government, going right to the top.
[39:15.440 --> 39:18.340]  And it was that sell your soul moment and he had to quit.
[39:18.340 --> 39:19.340]  R.J.
[39:19.340 --> 39:21.240]  Savada, it's the opposite here in Austin, Texas.
[39:21.240 --> 39:26.020]  He's selling his soul right now, in the words of Weldon Henson last night here in the office
[39:26.020 --> 39:27.860]  talking.
[39:27.860 --> 39:29.960]  And then it's sad to see that happen.
[39:29.960 --> 39:34.740]  It's so good to see somebody's spirit, see what's happening and just step forward and
[39:34.740 --> 39:38.620]  go, I'm not with this.
[39:38.620 --> 39:43.780]  And to hear that truth in the voice, instead to see people lying and making excuses, listen,
[39:43.780 --> 39:47.020]  it's a death warrant for everybody that goes along with this, okay?
[39:47.020 --> 39:51.340]  You are signing on, you are going into a dark room with Beelzebub.
[39:51.340 --> 39:57.700]  And let me tell you, Beelzebub looks like a beautiful woman there in the dark, the most
[39:57.700 --> 39:58.700]  beautiful you've ever seen.
[39:58.700 --> 40:05.520]  Just come, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby, come on, come on, come on.
[40:05.520 --> 40:11.140]  But it's gonna get you in a stranglehold as soon as you come in there.
[40:11.140 --> 40:17.060]  What starts like heaven is gonna end up being hell.
[40:17.060 --> 40:21.540]  Whatever is in your mind's eye of desire, that's how it's going to appear.
[40:21.540 --> 40:25.520]  Or you're competitive, you wanna show people that tried to hold you back that you can go
[40:25.520 --> 40:30.620]  be with Biden on the stage and you can sell the lie.
[40:30.620 --> 40:36.580]  The soul is being forfeit, it's being sold right there and it's gonna get harder and
[40:36.580 --> 40:38.940]  harder to turn back.
[40:38.940 --> 40:41.820]  It's gonna get harder and harder to say no.
[40:41.820 --> 40:47.060]  800-25-99231, we'll take a few calls here in a moment.
[40:47.060 --> 40:50.660]  I've just got news off the charts and we got Larry Pratt popping in.
[40:50.660 --> 40:55.700]  They've killed the filibuster, gun bill clears Senate hurdle as filibuster falls short.
[40:55.700 --> 40:58.420]  And if they need to stage a mass shooting to get it passed, they will, you better believe
[40:58.420 --> 40:59.420]  it.
[40:59.420 --> 41:00.420]  I mean, these are killers.
[41:00.420 --> 41:04.260]  And by the way, they've gotten a unified coterie of criminals up there now.
[41:04.260 --> 41:08.460]  And again, they're all going to jail if they don't totally take over.
[41:08.460 --> 41:17.580]  You see, they're committed, they're committed.
[41:17.580 --> 41:20.280]  They know all this stuff and most of them are scared.
[41:20.280 --> 41:23.820]  Most of them are social climbers that ran for this and ran for that and became mayor
[41:23.820 --> 41:27.980]  and then became a state rep and then ran for Congress and then the Senate.
[41:27.980 --> 41:33.900]  And they've got a mistress and three ex-wives and four kids and all these bills and they're
[41:33.900 --> 41:34.900]  up there.
[41:34.900 --> 41:38.620]  And the whole thing's a bubble to keep them in a matrix as well.
[41:38.620 --> 41:44.420]  All the real technocrats have their minions there feeding them the political information.
[41:44.420 --> 41:48.740]  And if anybody gets off the reservation, then the pressure is applied and then they back
[41:48.740 --> 41:57.580]  off and they go along with it.
[41:57.580 --> 42:02.160]  And by increments, the sand gets deeper, the quicksand gets deeper.
[42:02.160 --> 42:06.540]  So we'll get into North Korea, they're threatening to nuke again and all the rest of this garbage.
[42:06.540 --> 42:07.540]  We'll get into Bitcoin.
[42:07.540 --> 42:12.380]  And Mike Adams yesterday, the day before yesterday, predicted imminent collapse.
[42:12.380 --> 42:15.740]  And a collapse is more than 50% drop, it did do that.
[42:15.740 --> 42:20.020]  And Mike was calling earlier saying he's got more intel, if he wants to pop in via phone
[42:20.020 --> 42:21.020]  or Skype.
[42:21.020 --> 42:22.020]  I know he's out on his farm.
[42:22.020 --> 42:27.100]  He's got a farm and a big factory with organic food, he's an amazing guy.
[42:27.100 --> 42:32.300]  If he wants to pop in at 55 after, 54 after in the last segment the next hour, that'd
[42:32.300 --> 42:33.300]  be good.
[42:33.300 --> 42:37.300]  If he can do that, give us what he says next on Bitcoin.
[42:37.300 --> 42:43.580]  And of course, people can say then, did you make it crash?
[42:43.580 --> 42:48.780]  No, when something's shooting up 100% in a couple days, I mean, it's pretty much a no
[42:48.780 --> 42:51.860]  brainer in my opinion to say there's gonna be a crash.
[42:51.860 --> 42:55.500]  And I predicted during the interview, I said, I bet it'll crash and then bounce back up
[42:55.500 --> 42:59.500]  and crash and go back up to train people to stay in it for when they finally drop the
[42:59.500 --> 43:00.500]  hammer.
[43:00.500 --> 43:04.960]  And I'm not against Bitcoin, folks, I'm against being suckered cuz the globalists can naked
[43:04.960 --> 43:08.980]  short that thing all day and don't think they won't.
[43:08.980 --> 43:16.820]  I'm very suspicious about it, but again, that's cuz I've got instincts, that's cuz I'm bad.
[43:16.820 --> 43:23.660]  Being right is bad, being male is bad, being assertive is bad, being a slave is good, so
[43:23.660 --> 43:25.380]  sayeth the New World Order.
[43:25.380 --> 43:29.100]  Now speaking of being slaves, we did this piece because about nine years ago, I saw
[43:29.100 --> 43:35.860]  a Penn and Teller piece that showed people saying, let's ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[43:35.860 --> 43:37.740]  And that's water, of course.
[43:37.740 --> 43:43.740]  And so we went out and we sent out Lee Ann McAdoo, one of our new reporters, out to ask
[43:43.740 --> 43:44.740]  the question.
[43:44.740 --> 43:49.620]  And no one figured out it was water until one guy that were packing up cameras leaving
[43:49.620 --> 43:54.140]  and he comes over and goes, is that dihydrogen monoxide, is that water?
[43:54.140 --> 43:57.140]  And so we just cut that guy out because we were in a hurry to get back and he don't wanna
[43:57.140 --> 43:58.140]  be on tape.
[43:58.140 --> 44:04.500]  So the point is, is that one person out of, I think it's like 30 people, out there on
[44:04.500 --> 44:11.700]  the pedestrian bridge over the Colorado River, over a soup of deadly dihydrogen monoxide.
[44:11.700 --> 44:15.820]  The way she phrased it about it's dangerous, it does these bad things, that's exactly how
[44:15.820 --> 44:17.420]  they phrase carbon dioxide.
[44:17.420 --> 44:22.380]  Cuz all that's coming out of most of these plants is carbon dioxide and water vapor.
[44:22.380 --> 44:26.260]  But if they can list it, cuz it sounds scary, as a pollutant, they can tax it or shut it
[44:26.260 --> 44:27.900]  down selectively.
[44:27.900 --> 44:34.940]  So that's why we did this, was to show how they deceive and how they manipulate.
[44:34.940 --> 44:40.700]  And so for radio listeners, it's powerful audio, but the video is up on prisonplanet.com
[44:40.700 --> 44:41.700]  and infowars.com.
[44:41.700 --> 44:45.700]  For everybody to see if you're a radio listener and wanna check out that report, it's even
[44:45.700 --> 44:47.480]  more powerful seeing it.
[44:47.480 --> 44:51.900]  Here is the report, should we ban water to save the Earth?
[44:51.900 --> 44:54.900]  I don't usually hand out a lot of assignments, but I said, you know what, I like this Penn
[44:54.900 --> 44:58.060]  and Teller piece from nine years ago.
[44:58.060 --> 45:01.700]  And I've actually talked to people on the street that say, ban dihydrogen monoxide,
[45:01.700 --> 45:02.920]  which is water.
[45:02.920 --> 45:08.340]  So I said, I would like to see you go out on the street and recreate this.
[45:08.340 --> 45:12.940]  And then I said, next, I want Jacari and David Knight, and Darren McBreen, and Jon Bowne,
[45:12.940 --> 45:17.460]  and other reporters to go out and say, let's ban sodium chloride.
[45:17.460 --> 45:21.880]  Let's ban carbon dioxide, which they are trying to do, which plants breathe.
[45:21.880 --> 45:26.060]  Cuz banning water is just as crazy as banning carbon dioxide.
[45:26.060 --> 45:30.140]  People go, well, it has a scarier sounding name, really, dihydrogen monoxide sounds even
[45:30.140 --> 45:32.600]  scarier than carbon dioxide.
[45:32.600 --> 45:39.220]  And so they went out and she said the vast majority, I mean, she talked to a lot of people,
[45:39.220 --> 45:41.660]  so many we can't even show them all, almost all of them.
[45:41.660 --> 45:50.080]  I think she said one guy came back and said, wait a minute, isn't that water?
[45:50.080 --> 45:53.120]  So here is this report.
[45:53.120 --> 45:57.300]  So about ten years ago, Penn and Teller set about to prove that some Americans can be
[45:57.300 --> 45:59.980]  really gullible when it comes to saving the planet.
[45:59.980 --> 46:04.020]  And we figured, you know, it's been about ten years, people are more awake, they're
[46:04.020 --> 46:09.820]  starting to ask questions, certainly I couldn't get them to sign this petition to ban dihydrogen
[46:09.820 --> 46:10.820]  monoxide.
[46:10.820 --> 46:16.700]  That's right, I'm gonna see if people are gullible enough to ban water.
[46:16.700 --> 46:20.220]  Can I get you to sign my petition?
[46:20.220 --> 46:21.860]  Will I have to read a lot?
[46:21.860 --> 46:27.540]  I'm trying to get them to ban dihydrogen monoxide, it's an additive in certain junk foods, and
[46:27.540 --> 46:30.620]  basically we're trying to get enough signatures to get them to ban it.
[46:30.620 --> 46:31.620]  Sure.
[46:31.620 --> 46:32.620]  Oh, okay.
[46:32.620 --> 46:33.620]  Awesome.
[46:33.620 --> 46:34.620]  Well, good luck.
[46:34.620 --> 46:37.700]  I mean, if you want to read, otherwise you can just take my word for it.
[46:37.700 --> 46:39.140]  What's the source of the hydrogen monoxide?
[46:39.140 --> 46:40.300]  Where's it coming from?
[46:40.300 --> 46:43.820]  Well, it's one of the major components of acid rain.
[46:43.820 --> 46:47.620]  It doesn't come off like, obviously, when you go to wash your fruit, it's just everywhere
[46:47.620 --> 46:48.620]  now.
[46:48.620 --> 46:50.620]  We need it out of here!
[46:50.620 --> 46:53.820]  We'll help you out.
[46:53.820 --> 47:01.220]  It's now being dumped into lakes, rivers, and streams, so of course with our whole system,
[47:01.220 --> 47:07.820]  it then gets in the air.
[47:07.820 --> 47:12.060]  It causes excessive sweating, so you might already be suffering from this chemical.
[47:12.060 --> 47:16.700]  DHMO is being dumped into rivers, and oceans, and streams, and town lake.
[47:16.700 --> 47:17.700]  What are you doing?
[47:17.700 --> 47:18.700]  Fill with dihydrogen monoxide!
[47:18.700 --> 47:19.700]  Hydrogen monoxide?
[47:19.700 --> 47:20.700]  Dihydrogen monoxide?
[47:20.700 --> 47:21.700]  Wow, okay.
[47:21.700 --> 47:22.700]  I've never heard of it.
[47:22.700 --> 47:29.700]  Tell you what I'll do, I'll look it up, but I'm not going to sign it.
[47:29.700 --> 47:30.700]  Okay.
[47:30.700 --> 47:31.700]  Thank you.
[47:31.700 --> 47:33.460]  I look like I'm up to something, don't I?
[47:33.460 --> 47:34.460]  Hold on.
[47:34.460 --> 47:35.460]  Hold on.
[47:35.460 --> 47:36.460]  Real quick, mom.
[47:36.460 --> 47:39.780]  And I'm basically just trying to collect enough signatures to get them to put it on their
[47:39.780 --> 47:41.420]  docket and consider it seriously.
[47:41.420 --> 47:42.420]  Sure.
[47:42.420 --> 47:48.420]  She was on the phone, so apparently, if someone's distracted, and then you get them to sign
[47:48.420 --> 47:50.820]  something, that works too.
[47:50.820 --> 47:53.020]  They don't typically tell you they're poisoning you?
[47:53.020 --> 47:54.020]  Yeah.
[47:54.020 --> 47:55.020]  If I can get 1,000 signatures, then-
[47:55.020 --> 47:57.020]  I was a chemistry major, so I figured you could do that.
[47:57.020 --> 47:58.020]  Oh, really?
[47:58.020 --> 47:59.020]  Yeah.
[47:59.020 --> 48:00.020]  Wow.
[48:00.020 --> 48:01.020]  It's been a while, though.
[48:01.020 --> 48:02.020]  Well then, so can I get your support?
[48:02.020 --> 48:04.020]  Can I read this?
[48:04.020 --> 48:05.020]  Sure.
[48:05.020 --> 48:09.980]  If we can collect enough signatures, then they'll actually take it seriously.
[48:09.980 --> 48:10.980]  Okay.
[48:10.980 --> 48:11.980]  So you can voice it?
[48:11.980 --> 48:12.980]  Exactly.
[48:12.980 --> 48:13.980]  Okay.
[48:13.980 --> 48:14.980]  Where'd you go to school?
[48:14.980 --> 48:15.980]  Cornell?
[48:15.980 --> 48:16.980]  I did.
[48:16.980 --> 48:17.980]  Wow.
[48:17.980 --> 48:18.980]  Yeah.
[48:18.980 --> 48:19.980]  Awesome.
[48:19.980 --> 48:27.700]  Symptoms include excessive urination, sweating, bloating, the Environmental Regulatory Committee
[48:27.700 --> 48:30.260]  should be overseeing it and sort of-
[48:30.260 --> 48:31.260]  Okay.
[48:31.260 --> 48:33.260]  Come on, people.
[48:33.260 --> 48:39.300]  Ten years later, under the guise of saving the planet, and you'll still sign anything,
[48:39.300 --> 48:45.140]  especially if you don't have time to actually read the facts, this is a 300-page paper being
[48:45.140 --> 48:46.140]  passed in Congress.
[48:46.140 --> 48:51.260]  I mean, you'd definitely stop to read what you were signing, wouldn't you?
[48:51.260 --> 48:57.740]  Actually, maybe you wouldn't if you were a politician.
[48:57.740 --> 48:58.740]  Wow.
[48:58.740 --> 48:59.740]  What an incredible report.
[48:59.740 --> 49:05.340]  And it is so important that we get this video out to everybody, because despite the fact
[49:05.340 --> 49:09.840]  that Penn and Teller's report was seen by millions on HBO and millions on YouTube, still
[49:09.840 --> 49:15.220]  people say, ban dihydrogen monoxide, and ban carbon dioxide, and ban sodium chloride.
[49:15.220 --> 49:19.940]  I guess Bloomberg is trying to ban sodium chloride salt in New York, because if the
[49:19.940 --> 49:25.260]  control freak social engineers can get you to accept asinine things, they can get away
[49:25.260 --> 49:27.260]  with anything.
[49:27.260 --> 49:33.900]  And that video is up at infowars.com.
[49:33.900 --> 49:38.380]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not trying to be so dark here, but reality is dark.
[49:38.380 --> 49:42.860]  We're letting evil people do incredibly horrible things publicly.
[49:42.860 --> 49:45.660]  Where are the apologies to yours truly?
[49:45.660 --> 49:48.260]  I told you the state would start saying the kids belong to them.
[49:48.260 --> 49:52.580]  I told you they'd try to register your guns and then confiscate them.
[49:52.580 --> 49:56.860]  Cuz the globalists have done this all over the world, the same people.
[49:56.860 --> 49:59.180]  I told you they would start shutting down our power plants.
[49:59.180 --> 50:02.180]  What do you think NAFTA and GATT was for?
[50:02.180 --> 50:05.140]  Get rid of our jobs, make us dependent.
[50:05.140 --> 50:10.820]  And I told you the criminal elements that run our government and other Western governments
[50:10.820 --> 50:13.140]  created al-Qaeda and they run them.
[50:13.140 --> 50:18.420]  And now it's all over the news that, yeah, Christians are now the main terror group,
[50:18.420 --> 50:23.460]  along with, I mean, it was returning veterans, gun owners, libertarians, conservatives.
[50:23.460 --> 50:25.460]  Now it's, and the Christians.
[50:25.460 --> 50:28.940]  And imagine the state police in Colorado have gone public, they're in these federal training
[50:28.940 --> 50:34.140]  seminars going, prepare to mass confiscate the Christians, they are the enemy.
[50:34.140 --> 50:38.380]  I mean, right there, it should be running around going, enemies have invaded, enemies
[50:38.380 --> 50:39.380]  have invaded.
[50:39.380 --> 50:44.780]  I mean, they're bad mouthing George Washington saying the state's gonna get the kids.
[50:44.780 --> 50:48.700]  It's like North Korea landed, but it's not, but the red, it doesn't look like North Koreans
[50:48.700 --> 50:49.700]  though.
[50:49.700 --> 50:54.380]  With a little idiot Kim Jong-un, it's Obama, but he's just the front guy.
[50:54.380 --> 50:56.980]  And then you got all the useful idiots who think the government's their friend.
[50:56.980 --> 50:58.820]  The government was taken over.
[50:58.820 --> 51:02.380]  Now they're trying to mop up free speech in the states, but we're resisting.
[51:02.380 --> 51:03.820]  They haven't won yet.
[51:03.820 --> 51:06.940]  And we are striking back.
[51:06.940 --> 51:09.980]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[51:09.980 --> 51:13.540]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.

[54:44.260 --> 54:48.060]  update on the filibuster to try to block the national gun registration.
[54:48.060 --> 54:49.060]  That's what it is.
[54:49.060 --> 54:53.340]  And you got the Austin City Council guy going, don't worry, after we finish this work registering,
[54:53.340 --> 54:56.620]  your sign saying stop gun ban, you're going to need that sign, because that's what we're
[54:56.620 --> 54:58.620]  going to do.
[54:58.620 --> 55:02.860]  Yeah, you're my slave, baby.
[55:02.860 --> 55:06.580]  Just like North Korea, government's got the guns, and the people don't.
[55:06.580 --> 55:11.420]  And look at the heaven it creates, they just want the guns to be our friends, just like
[55:11.420 --> 55:16.060]  they took the Iraqi's guns to be their friends and have torture camps all over the place
[55:16.060 --> 55:17.060]  and make them plant GMO.
[55:17.060 --> 55:20.300]  You know, if you don't plant GMO over there, they come and kill you.
[55:20.300 --> 55:21.860]  That's freedom, isn't it?
[55:21.860 --> 55:24.860]  And our troops don't like it too much, they come back, commit suicide, but doesn't matter,
[55:24.860 --> 55:27.860]  they've got all the mercenaries hired who like doing the work.
[55:27.860 --> 55:30.160]  That's all been leaked by WikiLeaks.
[55:30.160 --> 55:35.180]  Mass torture, mass death, death squads, killing whole families, it's fun.
[55:35.180 --> 55:41.300]  Let's talk to Donald in New York, you're on the air, welcome.
[55:41.300 --> 55:43.880]  That's exciting, Donald.
[55:43.880 --> 55:44.880]  Very interesting, Donald.
[55:44.880 --> 55:45.880]  I'm here.
[55:45.880 --> 55:46.880]  Yeah.
[55:46.880 --> 55:47.880]  Okay.
[55:47.880 --> 55:48.880]  Hey, hey, hey.
[55:48.880 --> 55:57.340]  I got to tell you, man, I'm a fan, dude, I just became a fan, you got me awake, man,
[55:57.340 --> 55:58.340]  I'm awake.
[55:58.340 --> 55:59.580]  Well, I'm glad you're awake.
[55:59.580 --> 56:03.420]  Now, just don't drink the sodium fluoride out of the water and everything will clear
[56:03.420 --> 56:08.500]  up and then you can save those brain cells to take some vaccines so you can really die.
[56:08.500 --> 56:10.220]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[56:10.220 --> 56:12.900]  That's Melissa Harris, man, this thing, man.
[56:12.900 --> 56:16.260]  I watched the video on it, dude, this lady's crazy.
[56:16.260 --> 56:22.020]  Does she not realize that Hitler said this to his people?
[56:22.020 --> 56:25.540]  That the children don't belong to you anymore, they belong to the state.
[56:25.540 --> 56:28.820]  I mean, people need to wake up and start seeing, I mean-
[56:28.820 --> 56:34.140]  Yeah, you're talking about the MSNBC host who's also an educator, that means a brain
[56:34.140 --> 56:35.140]  washer.
[56:35.140 --> 56:38.140]  And then she said, your children belong to the state, we've got to get past this private
[56:38.140 --> 56:40.860]  idea and that your children are yours.
[56:40.860 --> 56:47.260]  And then she laughed at everyone when they got upset, she went, I'm in control.
[56:47.260 --> 56:51.700]  I'm sitting under the government's fat wart covered belly.
[56:51.700 --> 56:54.820]  I'm sitting under the devil's sweaty rump.
[56:54.820 --> 56:55.820]  I'm powerful.
[56:55.820 --> 57:00.860]  I've snuggled up to the snuff film producing New World Order.
[57:00.860 --> 57:04.580]  I've snuggled up to the black ops squads that staged the terror attacks.
[57:04.580 --> 57:09.060]  I'm snuggled up to it drinking delicious milk.
[57:09.060 --> 57:10.060]  Go ahead.
[57:10.060 --> 57:12.300]  It's insane, it's insane.
[57:12.300 --> 57:17.620]  I personally was a child of the state till I was 16, so I personally know-
[57:17.620 --> 57:21.980]  How many times were you molested by the government?
[57:21.980 --> 57:22.980]  Plenty of times, man.
[57:22.980 --> 57:28.300]  I mean, educational-wise, religious-wise, I can't tell you how many different homes
[57:28.300 --> 57:31.700]  I was in with different religions that were forced upon me.
[57:31.700 --> 57:32.700]  Oh, really?
[57:32.700 --> 57:33.900]  But you never had pervs go after you.
[57:33.900 --> 57:34.900]  Wow, you were lucky.
[57:34.900 --> 57:35.900]  Yeah.
[57:35.900 --> 57:41.660]  So, I mean, I happen to be one of the fortunate, I feel myself as one of the fortunate ones
[57:41.660 --> 57:47.500]  that all the bad things that happen out of life to me, I've learned from, and I'm a father
[57:47.500 --> 57:48.500]  of three boys.
[57:48.500 --> 57:49.500]  Good.
[57:49.500 --> 57:52.500]  I have an 18-year-old, a 13-year-old, and a 12-year-old.
[57:52.500 --> 57:57.180]  So, despite the fact they tried to break the chain of families with you, you have regenerated
[57:57.180 --> 57:59.100]  it and are defeating the enemy.
[57:59.100 --> 58:03.140]  Just surviving and having your family grow up healthy is a victory over the New World
[58:03.140 --> 58:06.540]  Order, and every child they can't destroy, they hate it.
[58:06.540 --> 58:08.940]  Every child they can't brain damage, they hate it.
[58:08.940 --> 58:11.980]  They're just like, sorry, go ahead.
[58:11.980 --> 58:13.820]  And I try to educate my kids.
[58:13.820 --> 58:19.020]  I mean, personally, I don't think the educational system, and I've seen it this last year, my
[58:19.020 --> 58:24.980]  two youngest kids are in elementary school, you know, they're in sixth and seventh grade,
[58:24.980 --> 58:29.980]  and I've watched them implement a whole new math system that's two grades above where
[58:29.980 --> 58:33.740]  they are, and 85% of the students are failing in this.
[58:33.740 --> 58:38.260]  No, no, it's designed to then, no, it's designed, the Department of Education, to give them
[58:38.260 --> 58:42.760]  too hard, too early, so they never, never get the basics to destroy them.
[58:42.760 --> 58:46.260]  This is all by design.
[58:46.260 --> 58:56.740]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[59:59.380 --> 01:00:11.060]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:15.900]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:16.900]  You want answers?
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.020]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:23.260]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:30.220]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:35.700]  You know, the idiot MSNBC persons being defended by the Communist Party and the Socialist Party
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:39.980]  in the U.S., they have an article up on Infowars.com, you know, the lady that came out to host and
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:45.700]  said, in the promo, Harris, she said, hey, let's, you know, the state's going to take
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.700]  over your kids.
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.340]  It's a good thing.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:53.820]  She may not even be consciously evil, though she probably is, but she signed on.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.840]  Everybody that signs on to big government and the system, I'm going to talk at the bottom
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:02.100]  of the hour about what you're signing on to and where this is going, just so you know.
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:05.620]  And by the way, this stuff is not my opinion, okay?
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:12.380]  I mean, we know in a extremely focused way exactly where this is going, not even generally,
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:16.900]  because the enemy acts like we're not even here and just admits it all.
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:19.420]  You know how frustrating that is?
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:23.220]  We got Larry Pratt coming up with updates on the savage attacks going on.
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:27.340]  Looks like they may get their gun grab passed in the Senate, then you just, I guess, stage
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:30.500]  a mass shooting after that and get the House emotionally to vote for it so they can register
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.260]  you and start the persecution of gun owners.
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:35.300]  We've got some more news on that.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:38.940]  Let's go ahead, though, and talk to Dean in Virginia.
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:41.300]  You're on the air, sir, go ahead.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:47.140]  Finally, I'm sitting in my driveway in Virginia looking up at the sky and about a dozen chem
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:50.820]  trails, two of them doing a 360 as I speak.
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:54.860]  That's an admitted government program, but everybody calls them chem trails and never
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:58.140]  the geoengineering program, so then people still think it's just a rumor.
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:03.260]  I'm not knocking you for calling it chem trails, it's just that they say they don't exist even
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:07.040]  though they do exist on record, like they say the Federal Reserve isn't private when
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.300]  it's private on record.
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:14.860]  My call is talking about two things, the airsoft guns, I was going to talk to the gun guys
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:19.220]  yesterday how the ATF confiscated 30 airsoft guns.
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:25.380]  My son is heavily into airsoft and I see about 500 to 1,000 of these warriors, these like
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:31.180]  SEAL team warriors with their airsoft, very real replica guns that fire these plastic
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.180]  BBs.
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:37.780]  They said, the ATF guy said on tape that they can be converted into real guns.
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:44.460]  I think this is a ploy to get them banned too, just like-
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:48.140]  Oh, there's no doubt, many cities because there's not a lobby for BB guns have already
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:51.500]  banned BB and pellet and other air guns.
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:57.340]  The people that told you about this saw a newscast four years ago out of Washington
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:03.140]  state where one of the importers of these has a shop and the ATF guy holds it up and
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:08.500]  says you can convert this into a real two to three when it is an airsoft thing that
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:13.580]  shoots plastic pellets, which is ridiculous, I mean it's impossible.
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:18.820]  And yes, they now are raiding people that sell them saying they have real firearms and
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:24.340]  they don't care because they can tell the public, look, the average person in Congress
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:28.140]  thinks that clips or magazines are disposable.
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:36.260]  Now my other point was how they're conditioning us with every day 24-7 about Korea's ready
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:37.260]  to launch.
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.260]  It could be any minute.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:41.260]  They're ready to launch a nuclear strike on the US or Japan.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:46.380]  That's all of a sudden we're going to have a, whoops, an EMP over one of our natural
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:49.940]  cities, LA, Chicago, and they're going to blame it on North Korea.
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:53.140]  No, no, I mean I woke up at 3am this morning and it all crystallized.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:54.780]  It's not my opinion, it's a fact.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:59.100]  The globalist, not even the US, the globalist Donald Rumsfeld gave the reactors to him in
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.100]  the mid 90s through 2000.
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:04.100]  There was secret meetings have now come out even in Reuters with the Pentagon a month
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:06.180]  ago before all this started.
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:10.060]  And I don't think they totally control them, but they've made a deal to give them oil and
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:14.440]  food and stuff behind the scenes and hookers or whatever Kim Jong Un wants, more movie
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:18.800]  stars to come see him, burnout movie stars and basketball players, if he'll do this to
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.800]  sell weapons.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:25.420]  And it's some way to then have an excuse to attack China or to menace the Chinese.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:30.700]  Again at a globalist level, this is a mafia deal going on and yes, just like they put
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:34.420]  the moolahs in, the CIA put the Ayatollah Khomeini in.
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:39.620]  Then they had a deal to have him grab our people, hold them, and that's all come out.
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:42.920]  Every person goes, well, I saw Argo, that's not true.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.780]  That's the fight at the grassroots.
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:50.820]  Up above it, these people work together because they all stand to gain from the crises.
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:55.880]  So yeah, and so they may nuke a city sometime, say North Korea did it, have some limited
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:00.220]  strike deal, he'll be protected and then they'll use that to come after all of us.
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:08.420]  I mean, let me tell you, we're run by foreign banks now, we'll be right back.
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:14.660]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.380]  Ben Soap Company.

[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.380]  needs.

[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:11.700]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms, but if you don't have a home security system,
[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:15.260]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.

[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:07.340]  I had tried everything.
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:11.860]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:12.900]  was working.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:17.780]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:23.260]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.260]  be satisfied.
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:28.340]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at infowarseteam.com, but I want to point
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:36.200]  out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:40.340]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:44.120]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.580]  than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:47.980]  Now that's results.
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:53.540]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarseteam.com and to order just three
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:59.180]  of their products, and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite

[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:16.020]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.020]  You want answers?
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.180]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:27.380]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:33.860]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, again, it is Thursday, the 11th day of April 2013.
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:35.660]  We're into the second hour.
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.780]  I know XM joins us in the second and third hour.
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:44.340]  Larry Pratt, Executive Director of Gun Owners of America, joins us.
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:45.660]  He was on CNN just the other day.
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.300]  We're going to play this clip later if we have time.
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:49.820]  If not, it's up on infowarseteam.com.
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:54.500]  And CNN properly said, maybe even more powerful and effective than the NRA.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:09:00.740]  They fear Gun Owners of America, and Gun Owners of America has forced the NRA, and Ted Nugent
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:04.740]  agreed to this, and he's a board member last time he was on, to get more hardcore.
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:08.620]  You see, that's why they always say, don't be radical, don't be radical, we're not radical.
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:12.380]  Everywhere the gun grabbers have gotten control, they've taken the guns.
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.740]  Everywhere they've gotten control, they've taken the guns, and when they register, they
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:15.740]  take them all.
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:19.980]  And criminals don't follow the laws, and they oughta be thanking gun owners for a 49% drop
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:25.780]  in crime rate since 1991 because of gun proliferation being the number one issue, and that's been
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:32.160]  done in university studies by, well, you name it, more guns, less crime by the professors
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.720]  that have broken it down, John Lott and others.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:41.100]  So all of this is happening, and they're there collectively saying it's our fault.
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:45.700]  When he was also on that CNN piece, you can read the article and see the video up at infowars.com.
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:52.280]  Mayors against illegal guns directors said no one in California has had their guns confiscated
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:54.540]  when they're all over the place grabbing them.
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:59.980]  If you've ever been depressed, ever been on Valium, ever been to a psychologist, period,
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:04.480]  you're now mentally ill, notice how they advertise it and say it's no big deal, and now they're
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.020]  gonna, without adjudification, try to take your rights.
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:09.420]  This is up at infowars.com right now.
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:15.220]  New York State Police admit wrongly confiscating guns under new laws.
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:21.620]  Cinema blowing smoke on cigarette tax, IRS violates Fourth Amendment, Italian Supreme
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:24.800]  Court President blames Bilderberg for terrorist attacks.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:28.620]  They're set to release documents, Senator says universal background checks could lead
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:33.160]  to national registry, no kidding, the ATF's already been caught over and over again keeping
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.380]  those records.
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:39.680]  Chinese professor says 70, 80% chance of war with North Korea, environmentalist signs petition
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.640]  to ban water, we're not joking, they're now saying it's bad, just like carbon dioxide.
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:50.360]  Top economic advisors forecast war and unrest, that's the news at infowars.com right now.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.640]  But to give us an update on the state of the Second Amendment and the collectivist war
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:58.940]  against the Second Amendment, they've got one against the First Amendment as well, their
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:04.840]  state's rights, 10th Amendment, I mean, I've never seen such an all out push and assault.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.100]  They're putting everything behind it.
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:12.380]  Gun bill clears Senate hurdle as filibuster falls short in a 68 to 31 vote.
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:16.800]  So this is razor's edge, whether it's gonna pass the Senate, then there could magically
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.660]  be another Fast and Furious mass shooting, and then they could get it passed.
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:28.300]  And Katie, bar the door, joining us is executive director of Gun Owners of America, gunowners.org,
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.860]  Larry Pratt joining us to break this down.
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:35.580]  Larry, what is the state of this war against the Second Amendment right now?
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:42.300]  Well, we're fighting it out in the Senate, even as we speak, there has been a vote on
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:51.060]  a motion to proceed, meaning we'll now bring up the gun control bills that Harry Reid has
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:54.260]  now that we've voted to proceed.
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:12:01.660]  There were 16 Republicans that voted with Harry Reid, and some of them were kind of
[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:06.620]  surprising, like Senator Burr of North Carolina.
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:13.860]  It's possible that at least some of these members were just actively deceived by Harry
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:22.020]  Reid, who promised them one kind of an agenda for the consideration of this legislation.
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:30.140]  And he's got it in another mode, trying not to get people lost in the weeds of, in fact,
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:35.180]  I barely understand it myself, we've got an attorney that's previously worked on the Hill.
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:39.580]  So it's just like Obamacare, it lets them do whatever they want.
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:45.300]  They got their way, and then the Republicans will be able to vote on stuff that they want
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:50.140]  after the damage has already been done on Senator Toomey's bill.
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:55.340]  Senator Toomey went and made a deal with Chuck Schumer, and anytime you make a deal with
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:59.140]  Senator Schumer, that can't turn out well.
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:08.220]  And so that's where we are, we're now taking that up, and the ability to amend with anything
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:12.820]  decent to change it, whatnot, that's not there.
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:18.540]  Because Reid set it up, he set the table, so that's the only thing available for eating.
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:28.060]  And the Republicans fell for, well, maybe some of them wanted to believe that it would
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:29.300]  be an open process.
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:35.820]  Well, it's not, but guess what, Harry Reid is doing it his own way, guys, and you're
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:36.820]  gonna get-
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:40.860]  And you predicted a month ago, whenever Harry was acting like he wouldn't go along with
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.780]  this, that it was all playing possum.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:47.480]  They always do this baiting and switching so that we can't build up political opposition.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:51.500]  They always go, I guess you won, I guess we're not gonna get it.
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:56.040]  And then the Republicans, obviously, the real power structure, wants to be able to take
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:58.640]  stuff out of our bank accounts like Cyprus and Europe.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:01.280]  They want our guns, this is the global policy.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:06.020]  And so a lot of Republicans are being financed by these interests to go along with this traitorous
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:07.020]  activity.
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.640]  But Larry Pratt, here's my question to you.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:15.320]  What can we do to try to stop this, A, and B, do you agree we've gotta get on offense?
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.060]  We've gotta, quote, be radical.
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:21.760]  They say don't be radical because it's not radical to say, hey, we've made the crime
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.760]  rate go down.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:27.840]  How dare you collectively say gun owners are responsible for 20 dead kids.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:32.220]  And if we don't do what Obama says, registering gun owners in all this garbage and shutting
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:37.960]  down gun shows and private sales, that we're letting the families down.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.180]  I mean, this is so transparent.
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:44.600]  Instead of running from this, we need to point out how they're using these dead children
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.940]  and go on the offense.
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:53.040]  The fact of the matter is that all of these mass murders that have occurred in our country
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:59.480]  over the last 20 years, with one exception, have occurred in gun-free zones.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:05.000]  Many of them schools, but not all, some of them were in places open to the public but
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.640]  posted no guns.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.620]  There was a mall in Utah.
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:15.840]  In a Utah school, you can carry concealed, but in this stupid mall, I think it was called
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:23.600]  Trolley Square, you could happily, there was a police officer carrying concealed off duty,
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:28.720]  but still five or six people were murdered before he could get there.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:35.680]  And what they don't want to talk about, and it barely made the news, three days before
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:44.280]  the Newtown tragedy occurred, in a Clackamas, Oregon mall, which was posted no guns, a dirt
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:51.840]  bag went in and started shooting, killed two people, wounded one, happily his gun jammed.
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:58.880]  And while he's fiddling with that, a good guy with a gun who also had ignored the sign,
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.600]  went running to the sound of the shots.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:07.840]  And just as the dirt bag was freeing his gun, saw the good guy with a gun, took a few steps
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:13.680]  in another direction, and ended the whole ugly scene by committing suicide.
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:20.040]  The police got there several minutes later, which is, frankly, folks, that's typical.
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:26.080]  Sure, thank God, thank God that gun owners keep stopping mass shootings.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:29.520]  My question to you is, how do we defeat this?
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:30.920]  What will happen in the House now?
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.980]  I mean, I know it hasn't passed the Senate, it's just gotten out of committee.
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:35.760]  What do we do to shoot this down?
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.800]  I mean, they're doubling down.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:42.400]  It looks like to me it's backfiring politically, but they don't care.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.360]  Is this the greatest assault you've ever seen?
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:51.680]  This is a very dangerous measure because this completes the effort to have a national gun
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:52.680]  registry.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:58.760]  They're not calling it that, but when they do the background check, they're telling dealers
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:06.960]  that if the dealer doesn't wanna spend hours, many times, waiting on the phone for a clearance,
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:10.880]  he can use the Internet, which they're increasingly doing.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.940]  So as most of the background checks are done by Internet, they get a little notice the
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:21.520]  first time they do it, saying that all the data supplied over this portal is going to
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:24.400]  be the property of the US government.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.400]  There's your gun registry.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:31.640]  I bought a 50 caliber rifle last year at a large gun store here in Austin, and there
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.140]  it all was on a computer and said that.
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:40.080]  The ATF had it all, the questionnaire, everything, the gun, and they've been caught.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.840]  You were on CNN and they said, we don't keep anything.
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.200]  They've been caught over and over again, saving all the data.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:51.640]  Exactly, and they've even been seen by many of our members, and I'll bet some of your
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:18:00.200]  listeners have seen in stores where ATF is in there taking down all the information.
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:04.680]  Some cases they make copies, which is actually illegal, but then, hey, wink, wink, we're
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:09.240]  not making a copy if we sit here and by hand enter it into our computer.
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:12.560]  And wink, wink, we shipped some guns to Mexico to blame the Second Amendment, wink, wink,
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.560]  we're terrorists.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:18.920]  Isn't that over the top for chutzpah, the very government that's going to check on whether
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:25.520]  or not we're worthy of buying a gun, haven't committed any crime, we're not in jail.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.840]  They are the ones that have killed by their own admission, at least, well, they've been
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:34.980]  complicit in the murder of some 400 Mexicans, a couple of our federal agents.
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:39.600]  And then they turn around and say, but, hey, Larry Pratt, you wanna buy a gun, we're gonna
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:44.360]  have to check you out, bud, we can't be too careful.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:48.400]  When everybody knows criminals don't follow the law, so what happens next in the Senate,
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:52.040]  and I mean, give us the legislative process, how do we shoot this down?
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:57.840]  Well, first of all, as you and I speak, we're sending a communication to the Senate saying,
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:03.440]  guys, Harry Reid pulled the wool over your eyes, he didn't play straight.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:07.440]  There were people saying, well, they were gonna vote for the motion to proceed and then
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:12.400]  they would vote for various amendments that Harry Reid said would be possible at that
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.400]  time.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:18.880]  It won't be possible, it's only gonna be Harry Reid's agenda that you can vote on.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:25.760]  And so, guys, get with it, get back in where you need to be and vote against this stuff.
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:32.040]  We can still stop this, it can be done, but they need, in the Senate, they need to hear
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:37.560]  from the folks back home, we'll have the names of the defecting Republicans up fairly soon.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:44.440]  There were even a couple of Democrats from Republican states, maybe two to four of them
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:45.440]  that voted right.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:50.480]  It wasn't enough to compensate for the hemorrhage, 16 Republicans.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:56.280]  Oh, yeah, listen, all the favors are being called in, the stops are being pulled out.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:00.320]  They're going for this cuz they wanna use Homeland Security to persecute gun owners.
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.720]  New York and California are the model.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:06.800]  This is a persecution program.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:09.160]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:12.880]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them if they
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.760]  are to be used to create new proteins in your body.
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:19.900]  Just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so too
[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:24.200]  your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:28.960]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:32.960]  One World Whey is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:38.240]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids, and all whey protein powders we've investigated
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:41.240]  and most proteins you consume are heated.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:44.760]  With our true cool process, you now have a choice with One World Whey.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:47.400]  My name is Daniel, I'm 34 years old.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.920]  When I started using One World Whey, I weighed 228 pounds.
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:54.480]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.200]  This is my ideal weight.
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.120]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.120]  in my potency.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:06.520]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.600]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:15.760]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:16.760]  alone.
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:20.320]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:24.160]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.720]  The fact is you are, we all are.
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:29.200]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:33.960]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:37.680]  the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.

[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.720]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:18.520]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:22.880]  House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:28.420]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:33.480]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:38.640]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.760]  normal cell.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:43.440]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:47.520]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:07.800]  Whew, nice shooting.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:10.800]  Hey, that's a sweet AK-47 chest rig.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.800]  Is that multi-cam?
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:14.800]  Yep, got it from StrikeHardGear.com.
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:15.800]  Strike what?
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:16.800]  Strike Hard Gear.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:17.800]  StrikeHardGear.com.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:24.520]  Set your sights on StrikeHardGear.com, tough, tactical gear for your Soviet-style weapon
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:29.400]  that's made in the U.S.A., affordable, plus a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:31.680]  and lifetime replacement warranty.
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:35.120]  StrikeHardGear.com, go ahead, pull the trigger.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:39.320]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:43.560]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:44.560]  to service debt.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:48.120]  Is that capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.400]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.400]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.680]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.920]  Call for your copy, 800-686-2237.
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.320]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:19.400]  Call 800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:24.780]  When I did this the first time in 94, it was the one group I had to go speak to and make
[01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:28.840]  sure they were satisfied with what we were doing were hunters.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:35.180]  There's a whole new sort of group of individuals now who I don't know what the numbers are
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:41.180]  that never hunt at all, but they own guns for one of two reasons, self-protection or
[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:44.520]  they just like the feel of that AR-15 at the range.
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.320]  They like the way it feels.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:54.900]  It's like driving a Ferrari.
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:25:01.120]  My impression is there's not the same sort of cultural norm about gun ownership with
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.600]  a lot of people who are buying guns.
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:04.600]  All right.
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.520]  The truth is we know globalists have taken over America.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:12.400]  We know foreign corporations are giving money to anti-gun groups in a seditious action to
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:13.840]  overtake us politically.
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:17.400]  Larry, isn't this really about a takeover with the government buying 2 billion bullets
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:22.400]  and armored vehicles and Fox News reporting that they're teaching state police that Christians
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.560]  are terrorists, period?
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:27.400]  I mean, this is really getting so bizarre, I can't even believe it.
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:32.320]  Well, when the government is referring to the population or a substantial part of the
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:38.120]  population as the enemy, and that's what Janet Napolitano, the head of the Department of
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:45.400]  Homeland and Security has called people who are pro-life, pro-second amendment, pro-constitution,
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:52.680]  pro-property rights, you name it, anybody who's kind of a traditional American, they're
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:26:00.400]  the enemy for this administration, and they don't hesitate to call any of us that.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:08.760]  And when they buy not armor-piercing ammunition, not wadcutter ammunition that might be suitable
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:16.440]  for target practice, but they buy enough ammunition to shoot each one of us five times, a hundred
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:24.640]  million a year and counting, then when you talk about the fear that has been instilled
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:31.600]  in Americans, by the way the president talks, I keep hearing stories of shipments of ammunition
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:34.220]  coming to a store on a truck.
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:39.960]  People find out when that truck is due, because many stores have, I guess, regular deliveries.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:44.720]  Anyway, they find out when that truck's coming, and even if it's six in the morning, there'll
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:50.440]  be people out there in the parking lot with their hand trucks, and the money will be exchanged
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.240]  on the spot.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:59.440]  The product never gets into the store, and with my own eyes, I've seen, I was in a large
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:06.900]  sporting goods store in Tulsa a couple weeks ago, I guess, and except for some used firearms
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:10.160]  on the wall, nothing on the ship.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:13.700]  Well, I've talked to major distributors, by the end of this month, most places will be
[01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:15.240]  completely sold out.
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:21.240]  All the shops in Austin are rationed down to one box of ammo.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:23.920]  That's also a frequent, that's now happening.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:28.920]  I think they've decided that they can't let the ammunition go to ten customers in the
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.920]  parking lot at six in the morning.
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:35.200]  And it's nice of them to at least ration it out.
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.920]  At least you can get a box.
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:43.220]  I mean, here's the deal, the so-called liberals are authoritarians, they call themselves liberals,
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:44.220]  they're not.
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.480]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal, they're not.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:50.580]  And they really have dreams, this is like Che Guevara or Mao Tse Tung, and they quote
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:52.280]  Mao Tse Tung taking over.
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:56.240]  And hey guys, it's not like you're breaking into our house and we don't know you're coming,
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:57.240]  okay?
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:58.600]  Back off now, crazies.
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:01.440]  Now briefly, legislatively, how do we kill this?
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:05.840]  What happens between, let's say it passed the Senate, what happens with the House, legislatively?
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:13.280]  That's finished in the Senate, and I think people can help by pouring out an outrage.
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:18.080]  And we'll have the names of the 16 Republicans up on our site pretty soon, and we'll be sending
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:24.000]  it out to people who are on our email list, so folks go to gunowners.org, they can get
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  signed up for that.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  That's a freebie.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.880]  Then you'll know who is who.
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:34.480]  We'll have alerts that carry email in them so that you can send it to the appropriate
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:40.120]  member of Congress, and that will help deliver the message they realize.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:44.960]  That way, we're watching, and if they really don't want to come back to Congress, if they
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:51.400]  think they're going to be paid off royally for selling us out on this issue, fine, go
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:53.960]  ahead and keep voting anti-Second Amendment.
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:58.160]  I'm not going to obey this law if it becomes law, I'll tell you that right now.
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:05.520]  I'm telling your huge audience, I will not obey this unconstitutional law.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:09.820]  They are sitting in the Senate as if they were a constitutional convention.
[01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:14.760]  They are infringing on the Second Amendment, they are changing the Second Amendment, and
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:19.360]  I'm not going to go along with it, and I don't think a lot of Americans are going to go along
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.360]  with it.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:24.520]  But it's not over in the Senate yet, there's going to be several more votes, still time
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:28.800]  to call, probably best to call them right now.
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:34.240]  But do sign up for those emails, because this may go into next week in the Senate, can't
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:35.240]  be sure.
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:41.000]  Absolutely, we see Obama rallying his idiots, saying, help me, call, get involved, we got
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  to get this done.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  They are organizing around this to demonize all gun owners.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.220]  I want to ask you what you think is going to happen if this passes and gets implemented,
[01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:55.960]  what the fallback position is in our next line of defense against the enemy.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:59.640]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:07.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:12.000]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:09.040]  powerful words are powerful Larry Pratt in closing my friend thanks for the time today
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:15.960]  gun owners dot o-r-g this is the real deal what is going to happen and we see him in
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:20.520]  New York arresting veterans for over 10 round mags we see them doing gun confiscations all
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:26.760]  over the country outside of law to veterans who they claim might have had PTSD 20 years
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:33.800]  ago we see a kid says we ought to squirt that other kid with a water gun and they go and
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:37.640]  take the dad's guns and say you'll get them back when your son moves out in eight years
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:42.560]  when he's 18 no judge no jury the state police or even you were telling me this privately
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:46.920]  but it's an article of info works dot com separately they're saying hey we're being
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:51.800]  ordered to do stuff that isn't even in this law but doesn't matter it so so the police
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:56.600]  are even saying we don't want to do this this shows how we've got a bunch of marxists running
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:01.520]  this country financed by a bunch of offshore banks what do we do Larry I think we got a
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:10.280]  column for what they are criminals it's certainly not legal to violate the constitution and
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:15.120]  to talk about setting up a gun registry which is what the background check is don't let
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:24.360]  them tell you anything else this is a gun registry the department of justice as I said
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:31.720]  earlier has told dealers use the internet to do a background check we own that data
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:37.800]  so this has got to be stopped because they've already got a fair number of us on record
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:44.240]  you and I bought guns at stores so we're already there in that database not that the two of
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:50.920]  us are likely to oh no the proud would never have any guns so we but there are a lot of
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:56.560]  people that otherwise wouldn't be known to the government and that's how they are now
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:02.600]  going to be known we saw them confiscate guns after Katrina please don't think that oh my
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:08.760]  government would do that they already have done that and so this that's why this battle
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:14.360]  is so crucial and why supporting something like Steve Stockman's bill he's the representative
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:22.800]  from outside of Houston his bill would take away the gun free zone gun ban that's the
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:28.200]  the thing that has been the common element in our mass murders over the last 20 years
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:35.840]  it's about time at least in the schools we get rid of these laws so that teachers principals
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:42.840]  janitors have the capability of having a concealed carry firearm with them to have an element
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:48.720]  of surprise to shoot back and to make it so it's no longer likely that I'm going to kill
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:58.360]  more people than the last guy did in this school Larry here's my issue you've been able
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:04.360]  to stop with Gunners of America a lot of legislation when the NRA was sold out you know a decade
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:07.760]  ago they've got a little bit better because of pressure and your pressure and that's a
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:11.480]  good thing as Ron Paul said you're the only non-compromised gun lobby in Washington there's
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:15.000]  a lot of other great state groups and others but I mean you guys are the ones that are
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  really scientifically on it historically but see they're over the top they're taking over
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.480]  they're saying we're terrorists they're saying we're horrible they're saying we're culpable
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:27.680]  for dead kids they're doing all this while butchering the rest of the Bill of Rights
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:35.560]  they're going for it all and I think we have a tendency to hold back because of this idea
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:40.800]  that oh it's mainstream you know to be genteel about this and and and to not go all the way
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:48.080]  but there's no way to not call it what it is and they are a pack of lying criminals
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:51.680]  that want to disarm us to enslave us we have a map we'll put on the TV screen for listeners
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:57.200]  I'll have this posted on info wars.com FBI statistics for gun violence and then it says
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:04.480]  2012 voting pattern and the crime is all in the Democratic blue areas I mean if they are
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:08.120]  criminals they are a criminal culture I'm not even a Republican they're the Democrat
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:14.440]  light my point is look at the Acorn findings where they go into every other Acorn and they're
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:20.680]  like yeah we want sex slave children you want to make some cash I mean it's just these people
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:27.280]  are gangs of lawless lunatics with moron camp followers on welfare behind them and they
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:31.880]  mean to have a war they're training for war with us there should be a congressional hearing
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:37.660]  over Obama's new army manual guys put up army manual gun confiscation in it it talks about
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:41.720]  getting our social security numbers taking our guns putting us in FEMA centers this is
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:46.640]  but it sounds so radical when it's the new army manual that's public this isn't even
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:52.120]  classified I mean this is red alert run down the street with your hair on fire like Paul
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:59.680]  Revere saying the new world order redcoats are here they ain't coming fast and furious
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:04.960]  already took place and it only stopped when to the government's surprise we managed to
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:11.560]  find out about what they were doing over 400 dead Mexicans that we know of so far connected
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:18.280]  with those guns and a couple of our federal agents murdered by people using fast and furious
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:25.600]  guns and it just drives me crazy to think that this is the government that thinks it
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:32.520]  has the moral authority to decide whether you and I should be able to buy a gun I'm
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:38.440]  sorry I don't think there should be a background check what good is it no the criminal is giving
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:43.760]  guns to the enemy what do you think of snoop dog with all of his drug arrest and convictions
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:50.240]  and murder arrest and then you know plea bargains and and all the gun arrest saying we need
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:55.320]  to all turn our guns in I mean I guaranteed snoop isn't going to turn in his illegal guns
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:41:00.920]  by the way it's internment and resettlement operations FM 3-3940 folks read it and weep
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:07.240]  February 2010 I mean I'm just sick of these people in my face criminals saying turn my
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:13.440]  gun in you first criminal go ahead sorry yeah well I think we might ought to ask the government
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:19.240]  to start turning in their guns because they don't put them to very good use this is just
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:23.880]  if and if they really think that guns are the problem if that's what mayor Bloomberg
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:29.800]  for example thinks is the problem and you and I need to be disarmed mayor I'll give
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:35.200]  some credence to your argument and I'll consider it when I see you tell the bodyguards that
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:41.260]  you've got to go on home you're not going to need them anymore no more armed men around
[01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:46.440]  you no sirree because we know that guns only make it likely that there's going to be more
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:50.800]  violence absolutely in closing Larry Pratt I asked the question for the break and digressed
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:56.480]  after we came back what do you think is going to happen if they succeed and clearly their
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:02.480]  plan is to then persecute gun owners and and nickel and diamonds and and a misapplied gun
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:08.840]  statutes like the ATF does where guys in the ar-15 m4 misfires and shoots three bullets
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:13.040]  in front of everybody it's a military veteran no criminal record and they throw him in prison
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:18.760]  I mean I mean clearly they want to persecute us as a litmus test they hate our guts being
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:23.160]  criminals you have that criminal instinct to go after good men I mean what's gonna happen
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:27.800]  because it's not just me a lot of others are saying this is going to become a civil war
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:33.500]  this can only happen if the republicans let it happen and if they think they're going
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:39.480]  to be immune from consequences at the polls I think they're making a very serious political
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:46.880]  mistake there's a more conservative constituency voting in this off year coming up the drones
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:52.200]  tend to come out more for the presidential election but the producers and the conservative
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:58.160]  more conservative people are going to be voting there's going to be primaries and believe
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:03.640]  me we're going to be looking for credible primary opponents to each and every one of
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:10.040]  these republicans that votes wrong that votes to to basically do away with the second amendment
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:15.960]  and to infringe away this is serious stuff and well Larry will have consequences before
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:20.760]  this goes to blows like bunker hill that's what they're looking for I'm going to use
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:24.760]  every means necessary that's non-violent and if that means picketing if that means
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:30.440]  bullhorning if that means a politician that's anti-gun if I can sue them for something else
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:37.160]  they're doing wrong I mean I'm pulling out the stops okay I mean I mean I I personally
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:42.500]  am going to start you know frequenting bars that's that that anti-gun city council people
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:46.760]  stay at and I'm going to catch them with a hooker I mean I mean I'm running I'm running
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:51.280]  counter-terrorism against them I'm turning it loose it's time to get do what the Veritas
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:56.360]  project does or project Veritas it I mean because we say I know these people all of
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:01.480]  them are crooks I'm telling you 99% of these globalists are crooks and if we just start
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:08.220]  get them on anything we can Larry it I mean this is all-out war is it not if they're declaring
[01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:13.720]  it so they shouldn't be surprised if it actually happens I guess they figure that they can
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:18.640]  get they've been used to getting away with a lot of stuff and I think that's going to
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:26.120]  be coming to an end now I think I've never seen people this upset this long not even
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:30.200]  after a Columbine when they were in our face pretty bad they're not upset they're probably
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:36.920]  staging and all they stage Fast and Furious well sorry it's going to be serious stuff
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:44.960]  so I think they better consider what they're doing I know that the servers on Capitol Hill
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:54.280]  have been breaking down there's been so much contact coming in from us roots and they disregard
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:57.760]  that at their parents what do you make of all the FBI and Secret Service and federal
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:02.720]  marshals feds have been speaking out and quitting like Bongino and so many others they're really
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:06.880]  getting wow bad guys are really running the federal government I mean this is really bad
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:13.360]  and what there's a flip side to that to those that are in like the bonginos of the world
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:19.720]  these are guys that are highly trained and if they're not going along with the program
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:26.760]  they're your worst enemy mr administration history is repeating itself we are we have
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:31.800]  front row seats to try and to stop basically Hitler in 1935 or so after he's already in
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:36.520]  and again I know Romney was a globalist Romney basically rolled over it was all pretty much
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:42.200]  staged but I gotta tell you I mean you know I've been critical of all these groups but
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:47.880]  I'm telling you Obama is so much worse than I even thought and and and I mean the fact
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.160]  that they're just going for it and shutting our power plants down and I mean they're trying
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:58.000]  to it's not rhetoric they're trying to bring America down to collectivize us like Mao Zedong
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.640]  did in China I mean these and they all quote Mao Zedong they say our kids belong to them
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:09.040]  I mean they're flaming authoritarian dirtbags they're tearing down dams in the West they
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:17.200]  want to rewild the country kind of like Romania move us all into large urban centers where
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:23.660]  we live stacked up and they're admitted communist god help us Larry Pratt gunners dot org thank
[01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:26.760]  you for always coming on to give us updates I know you're a very busy man you know have
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:29.960]  a quick 10-minute lunch for your next I'm gonna let you go so you can eat something
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:35.960]  yeah thank you we'll talk to you folks go to gun owners sign up and become a member
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:40.320]  get the free alerts we'll talk to you soon Larry thanks again I mean I'm gonna be honest
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:45.200]  with you ladies and gentlemen I mean this is just freaking me out because all I do is
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:49.960]  watch these liars lie and use dead kids and everything else when they all know full well
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:56.680]  and then well if you're not a TV viewer we just showed the map of everywhere that the
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:00.800]  socialists are in control in America and that's where the crime rate is two three four five
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:06.000]  times and then they spin it going well we do need to take all the guns of the urban
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.480]  areas that's where the crime is that's because that's where you've got all the people from
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:13.740]  countries that never had a Second Amendment who were domesticated and and roll over to
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:17.480]  crime and that's where you've got the corrupt police forces and I know that's where it is
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:23.360]  I mean Mexico has the highest crime rate in the world and notice everywhere on the Mexico
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:30.500]  US border has the highest crime rate if you go pull up the numbers just type in FBI statistics
[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:35.520]  for gun violence actually put the URL up on screen for TV viewers so I can give that to
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:40.740]  them or ask Kurt Nemo and a Don Salazar to point post that if you wanted to fix Mexico
[01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:44.440]  at first it'd be like you know getting over a bad flu there'd be a high fever you would
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:50.560]  arm everybody in Mexico get rid of all gun laws and that's all there's a few dozen cities
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:54.880]  that have had their crime rates drop because citizens finally got guns probably legally
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:59.260]  from the US and Mexico and they have vigilante squads and the crime rates have imploded the
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:03.280]  criminals only come in when they know they're not going to be opposed that's government
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:09.540]  criminals and others they've got all these Mormon communities down in Mexico where they
[01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:15.520]  just have guns illegally and they've told the police and they've told the military and
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:19.640]  they've told the cartels the same thing we're ready for war leave us alone don't come in
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:24.560]  and they've been in control there for a few years crime rate has just disappeared and
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:29.560]  because they have you know the the men like we don't I was your night to stay up all night
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:34.120]  up there at the at the sharp shooting positions with the Barrett 50 cal and the night vision
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:40.340]  I mean I mean you got four or five watchmen in a town of thousands of people and the criminals
[01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:44.100]  stop showing up because they know there's somebody there with a gun on them I mean this
[01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:48.920]  is not rocket science ladies and gentlemen okay they've taken all the guns in Mexico
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:55.960]  from the people hundreds of years ago and now you I mean it's just amazing it is amazing
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:02.000]  and I said I'd get into the globalist master plan and I even recorded some notes this morning
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.460]  at points I wanted to make the middle of the night and and and all of it and I covered
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:12.000]  some of it the first hour I'll have to do it I'll have to do it in overdrive today after
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:17.440]  shooter Jennings leaves or I'll have to do it tomorrow on the air and I don't procrastinate
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:24.160]  covering this it's just the magnitude is so great that I just I need to do a special report
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:30.960]  or something and again I just want to ask listeners pray for this show because the globalist
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:34.800]  are radical in their attack because they know that's how they take over we have to quote
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:39.840]  be radical in our counter response it's not radical you see they lie to you normal response
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:44.400]  they call radical they go don't be like Alex Jones that's discrediting and the people are
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:50.840]  so mindless they go oh I better be soft-spoken and say maybe you shouldn't take our guns
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:56.240]  you know gun have you seen the statistics guns lower the crime rate shut up baby killer
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:59.440]  you killed the kids at Newtown when they're the ones that want to kill babies up to age
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:03.640]  three they're the ones trying to board as many babies as they can they're a death cult
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:10.120]  they're sick freaks they're scum they're trash they're garbage and every day I think about
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:16.680]  how I've got to risk my life believe me I am and I my family and everything because
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:21.920]  we cannot let them take over and again it's not because any of us that are fighting tyranny
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:29.260]  or heroes or anything folks it's because it's in our gut yeah we actually have an FBI graphic
[01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:32.760]  you guys can even show that's in the computer that goes through it and breaks it down and
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:43.560]  shows the numbers 49% drop by the way the crew does a great job I get so focused on
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:47.120]  finding a new role where I'm like get that document get this document and I think over
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:50.680]  the years not my crew now but some people thought I'm like mad at them because I'm so
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:58.560]  crazed I'm craze not craven and I just I mean I just I'm trying to stop Lenin before he
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:03.040]  takes power I mean I mean Lord Lenin's in charge but he hasn't secured the whole country
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:10.880]  yet you know that it took him a decade I mean
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:16.000]  curious about what comes next next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:21.120]  arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars fool the bad guys with
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:27.700]  a new improved fake TV you asked for it we listened and we made our new fake TV three
[01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:32.200]  times brighter than our previous model the brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:38.380]  to a 40 inch TV it simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from
[01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:43.160]  home and when burglars think someone is home watching television they're likely to pass
[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:49.040]  your house and move on to an easier target the new brighter fake TV is only $39.95 and

[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:27.920]  also a big fan of his son shooter Jennings who I've never met in person talked to him
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:33.000]  phone quite a bit and of course a lot of his music's been used in a film like police state
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:38.800]  for the rise of FEMA but I mean to meet him in person it's like he looks even a lot more
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:44.760]  like his dad in person than he does even in his photographs it's amazing I don't get star
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:48.320]  truck over just regular fun you know like anybody who's a celebrity I like people I
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:52.800]  admire I can't tell you how many mornings we've cooked breakfast with our kids or back
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:56.560]  when I was a kid listening to Waylon Jennings and people and I just love Waylon Jennings
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:00.960]  so shooter Jennings is here coming in studio at the five after break in the next hour to
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:04.720]  talk about fighting the new world order and he's kicking his nationwide tour off right
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:11.640]  here today he's going to be outside Austin playing tonight okay let's go to the man who
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:16.560]  was on with us Tuesday and said he predicts an imminent Bitcoin crash and it went from
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:22.720]  260 something down to a hundred in just an hour just as he predicted and I added the
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:28.640]  prediction that it would bounce back up which it did partially so joining us via Skype is
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:35.880]  for this segment the next is Mike Adams from his farm from his extremist compound Mike
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:41.680]  Adams I mean you called it some are saying that we actually caused it I say Boulder Dash
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:45.940]  hi Alex thanks for having me on there's no way that we caused this and I mean even if
[01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:51.680]  we did then that would mean the currency is so weak that it was a joke to begin with so
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:56.360]  we couldn't have caused it just by by predicting a crash would happen at some future date but
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:02.480]  it is true that on your show you and I predicted we called it 100% accurate that a disastrous
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:08.900]  crash was coming it happened less than 24 hours later crashing from 266 down to 105
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:15.220]  but the real story here is that I believe this was an attack by central bankers I believe
[01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:20.160]  this is my personal belief you predicted that too on the air yes I did yes I did it unfolded
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:25.000]  exactly as we talked about the there is a user out there called Bitcoin billionaire
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:31.680]  who dumped bitcoins onto the market I believe this was a probe attack by the central bankers
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:37.800]  to determine what's called the buoyancy the resilience of the Bitcoin price support by
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:43.160]  dumping a predetermined amount into the the market and watching how much it crashes they
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:48.560]  can then calculate the amount needed to crash it down to any desired target level so I believe
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:54.740]  this was a central banker probe attack that could be followed by a disastrous crash which
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:59.760]  could be accomplished with less than 1 million dollars in capital that's how vulnerable bitcoin
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:05.560]  is to market manipulations the other important point here Alex is that the volatility of
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:12.960]  bitcoin now proves that no large merchant will ever accept this currency so bitcoin
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:18.640]  has failed as an experiment I'm sad to say that I wanted it to work but I have to admit
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:23.920]  it has failed in terms of a usable currency that large scale merchants like amazon.com
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:29.240]  would theoretically accept they won't touch it now because the one day volatility is now
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:36.420]  over 50% even 60% meaning that merchants can't trust it as a currency that means that bitcoins
[01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:42.960]  only use real real use is to buy and sell bitcoins which means it's a speculative bubble
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:46.920]  and it means that those people who are now pushing and hyping bitcoins are really in
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:52.600]  my opinion engaged in what can only be called the Bitcoin cult Alex this it doesn't make
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:53.600]  rational sense.
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:57.680]  You heard it here first the Bitcoin it was cultish I've been down on the street like
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:00.960]  six months ago like you've got to cover this it's the greatest thing ever it will bring
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:04.880]  them down and I'm like but they'll just short I mean I mean they're suppressing gold while
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:10.160]  they hoard it and buy it so that's a gold cult no the elite are the ones buying that
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:14.840]  and but I mean I again I like the idea of this type of free currency the problem is
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:18.920]  whatever is big and whatever comes out first the enemy is going to try to blow it up that's
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:23.120]  the basic warning it's super easy for the central banks to manipulate it to crash it
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:29.480]  to discredit it and the main big bitcoin exchange has now frozen all transactions for 12 hours
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:35.720]  it's a Bitcoin bank holiday Alex a Bitcoin bank holiday but you're bad because you're

[02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:04.320]  thanking CNN I mean they are just a pack of scum I kind of love that name shooter alright
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:11.320]  ladies and gentlemen let's go back to Mike Adams Mike again you I've been not critical
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:16.480]  of Bitcoin I like the idea just the whole way it's been put out there like a cult my
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:22.680]  gut told me don't be involved in it and now that's happened but it's like I said 2012
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:26.120]  nothing was going to happen and of course I had a hard call to make but I'm still bad
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:31.160]  because I said nothing was going to happen with it so what do you predict now with Bitcoin
[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:34.720]  in closing and thanks for joining us on a short notice what do you predict now is going
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:41.320]  to happen and then how do we then get other real alternate digital currencies that we
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:47.200]  do need well first of all this reinforces the importance of having physical gold so
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:52.040]  the gold bugs are right you the gold can't evaporate overnight if you have it in your
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:58.080]  possession so number one this is very pro gold secondly I am a proponent of the idea
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:04.240]  of crypto currencies peer-to-peer decentralized currencies Bitcoin I'm calling it a failed
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:09.600]  experiment at this point but it's not the end of virtual currencies I think they're
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:14.840]  going to be more attempts more real Bitcoin 2.0 other things that will be attempted and
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:18.560]  maybe a lot more successful and I hope they are by the way I think the central banks need
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:25.040]  competition but right now at this point I have warned everybody that Bitcoin currently
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:32.280]  is a zero-sum game almost almost a scheme at this point because for someone to win it
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:38.920]  but Bitcoin someone else has to lose everybody can't win all together so if you think that
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:43.320]  you're smarter than everyone else was buying bitcoins then by all means go ahead and risk
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:48.680]  your life savings at it but chances are you're not and what we're really seeing with Bitcoin
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:53.840]  is that this younger generation hasn't learned the lessons of the dot-com bubble which did
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:59.560]  crash and did burst and did lose 99% of many people's entire life savings this younger
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:03.440]  generation didn't live through that and they haven't seen it and they think they've discovered
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:08.120]  some new galactic you know loophole through which everybody can become wealthy.
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:11.760]  One reason the Chinese are investing in this so much is that they they don't invest in
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:16.520]  it because they're gullible the general public that's a big thing in China is to ride bubbles
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:20.400]  they've got one for an herb right now that supposedly can you know help you with swine
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:25.440]  flu or something so I mean you know a lot of this was China pumping into it as well
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:29.440]  I agree with you on that front now are you declaring that it's going to be dead soon
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:34.640]  pretty much or are you saying it's not it's going to be a pure casino?
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:40.160]  It is already a pure casino at this point until it comes back to traditional valuations
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:45.200]  which which I would say would be something well under ten dollars a bitcoin then I would
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:49.980]  warn people away from it now I know there are a lot of people talking up bitcoin most
[02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:54.760]  of those people have bitcoins and they have everything at stake the bitcoin exchange makes
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:59.160]  money off transactions so they want to spin everything as good news they call yesterday's
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:04.920]  crash a that they are a victim of their own success they call it a success that it crashed
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:10.480]  I call that a loss of a billion dollars in valuation so people put your money where it
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:15.520]  really counts which would be some gold some farmland maybe food production technologies
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:22.960]  maybe some foods firearms ammo that can't disappear overnight skills absolutely be smart
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:26.840]  people don't be suckered into the latest bubble
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:31.120]  well look I think overall it's a good idea I've been very suspicious of the whole nebulous
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:37.280]  nature of it from the beginning and we'll see what happens so far you've been dead on
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:42.320]  and we'll see what happens but I mean as for gold they are manipulating it on purpose now
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:47.460]  and over 12 years it only goes up we've been proven right long term so we'll see if we're
[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:51.920]  proven right on this long term as well naturalnews.com is where you find more of Mike Adams great

[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:29.000]  west coast if they were lucky to not blow up on a launch pad and they can certainly
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:33.880]  hit japan or south korea that's just the capital of south korea seoul 30 miles away from the
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:40.700]  missile and placements so that's just some of the news out there today and we'll also

[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:50.800]  man what a crazy world two years ago you put out your last hit album and it just did the
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:54.040]  whole thing talking about the tyranny in the world and the big changes that were coming
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:57.960]  and now it's happened and now you've got another album out it's great to have you here with
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:02.160]  us man it's great to be here i really appreciate you uh letting me on the air you know i think
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:05.780]  i've said to myself i'm not gonna really be doing many more interviews but being on this
[02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:09.960]  show is is really uh i've been looking forward to it so thank you well i was looking forward
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:12.920]  to you coming to town and then i get so busy and then i get to work they go you know this
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:16.380]  is the day shooter's coming and it's like bam there you are yeah here we are it was
[02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:19.760]  really nice to actually see you in person man why do you say you might not do a lot
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:23.180]  of interviews anymore just sick of them yeah you know i well i get asked a lot of the same
[02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:26.520]  questions and it's really been like pretty much anybody can pick up the phone get a hold
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:30.840]  of me and these days the way that the world is turning and the way things are and the
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:35.200]  way that i feel about things i really feel like it's important to say things when people
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:39.320]  are going to listen and i think that uh in a case like this you know we can talk about
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:43.760]  real issues things that bother us without worrying about what people think you know
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:49.100]  and i don't want to deal with some uh angled press somewhere that really wants to talk
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:51.840]  to me you know just ask me what it's like being my dad's kid or something like that
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:55.960]  and and not really care about what i gotta say about things you know what i mean what
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:13:00.260]  is it about the so-called mainstream media i think it's their training they almost always
[02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:04.360]  twist what was really said i had billy corrigan on about a month ago and it was in a bunch
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:11.280]  of newspapers but one salon article uh actually did a decent job on what the interview was
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:15.540]  about all the others distorted it and i said wow i can't believe they actually just really
[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:23.000]  covered what we said they always try to distort on purpose like it's impressive or something
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:28.220]  i know they they spin it in a way uh and i think this trickles down on a lot of levels
[02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:32.000]  i think you have people at high levels that are they're strategically changing what they
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:35.140]  want articles to be angled against and i think you have people low levels that just aren't
[02:13:35.140 --> 02:13:38.860]  paying attention and to only pay attention to the to what these things that that strike
[02:13:38.860 --> 02:13:41.720]  a chord in their mind and those are usually people that aren't aware of what's really
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:45.560]  exactly no it's a feedback loop they've grown up in the propaganda yeah they're not even
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:49.460]  active agents they just regurgitate exactly and that's the only thing they know it's so
[02:13:49.460 --> 02:13:53.700]  funny because like people that aren't exposed to uh you know for me doing black ribbons
[02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:58.180]  that was an experience in me waking up and being aware like i can't even watch my children's
[02:13:58.180 --> 02:14:02.200]  children that was the last album black ribbons yeah yeah and that for me was trying to wake
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:06.820]  other people up you know but i can't watch uh you know bubble guppies or these shows
[02:14:06.820 --> 02:14:11.700]  my kids watching television without seeing something that is is is gearing them already
[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:15.380]  towards what they're supposed to think the world is like you know well it's actively
[02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:18.740]  trying to take them away from you i mean i mean you watch children's programming now
[02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:23.140]  it's programming i mean it's straight up yeah with the exception of certain things that
[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:26.980]  are independently done i feel like exactly you know that that we're and just like the
[02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:31.220]  news just like sports programming i mean all of it you're constantly being fed uh this
[02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:35.100]  this uh box that they keep you in and and how you're supposed to view the world and
[02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:39.460]  what success is and what women men's relationships are and things like that you know i definitely
[02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:42.660]  think that the press and the people who are uneducated about it are the people that the
[02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:46.100]  perpetuated and that's their what they've got in their back pocket is they know that
[02:14:46.100 --> 02:14:49.420]  90 of the world are uneducated and what's really going on and they're going to continue
[02:14:49.420 --> 02:14:55.860]  to perpetuate the lie you know you're absolutely right about that wow we were talking during
[02:14:55.860 --> 02:14:58.540]  the break and that was some pretty interesting stuff you want to repeat what you were saying
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:01.700]  off air oh wait what was i saying we were just talking about the whole second amendment
[02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:05.300]  thing you've got the legendary name shooter i mean what's your take on all this well see
[02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:09.820]  i got real mad because right after okay first of all i have five-year-old daughters so so
[02:15:09.820 --> 02:15:15.040]  the newtown thing was was heartbreaking um to hear and you know of course that i would
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:20.020]  never uh want to say that that those kind of things should be allowed to happen or whatever
[02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:23.440]  because that's the way they like to attack you if you're trying to protect the guns thing
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:28.300]  but i was listening i was taking my five-year-old daughter to school every morning and every
[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:32.660]  morning i would tune in to your program um on the way there and on the way back and it
[02:15:32.660 --> 02:15:37.420]  was all the weeks leading up and months leading up to newtown it was like you had a soldier
[02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:40.740]  who was on anonymously who had said that they had been training them on taking away the
[02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:46.860]  weapons and and you were saying right then all we need is one thing everyone was saying
[02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:50.420]  everyone it's it's easy and logical if you know what's going on that all they need is
[02:15:50.420 --> 02:15:55.460]  one event that's going to pull on the heartstrings of america and allow them to make everyone
[02:15:55.460 --> 02:15:59.860]  want to give up their guns now i'm not saying that that i think that obama directly had
[02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:04.420]  the children in newtown shot that's not what i'm saying what i'm saying is however it led
[02:16:04.420 --> 02:16:08.640]  to this event that event is the event and which has caused everyone to start giving
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:12.940]  up their weapons now i had an advertisement i have a radio show i do on serious xm an
[02:16:12.940 --> 02:16:17.260]  outlaw country every saturday no i've heard it yeah yeah and so i had an ad for my christmas
[02:16:17.260 --> 02:16:21.540]  show and it was after all this and and i like i do my own graphic art and stuff and i do
[02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:26.020]  things that are just crazy and funny i i took santa claus and put my head on some kid who
[02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:30.380]  sit on santa claus and just to art it up i always put blood splatters and little things
[02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:35.860]  that are around my name and everything it wasn't like directly related to santa claus
[02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:39.840]  and the children i just had this blood splatter thing as a kind of background coloring of
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:45.180]  the thing and uh just because that's what i do and i had so many people get so angry
[02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:49.740]  about me posting this and it made me mad because because it was after newtown or whatever and
[02:16:49.740 --> 02:16:56.060]  i said why do we have to freaking sanitize our culture every time one of these things
[02:16:56.060 --> 02:16:59.500]  happen you know rage against the machine their entire catalog was banned from the radio tom
[02:16:59.500 --> 02:17:03.840]  rell is a friend of mine and and and people have different opinions of of what he says
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:07.740]  but i really strongly believe in his in his outlook on things and they banned their entire
[02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:12.700]  catalog from the radio after 9 11 for several months and it's like what are you doing well
[02:17:12.700 --> 02:17:17.020]  same thing with the dixie chicks when they criticize the war and uh yeah i mean four
[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:20.280]  people that are on the left he's one of the best people out there he'll actually truly
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:25.580]  criticize he's been critical of obama but but expanding on that that's what the soviets
[02:17:25.580 --> 02:17:31.940]  would do is they're putting the guilt on all shooters shooter no pun intended uh show that
[02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:38.180]  we'll do what they say when the fbi's own numbers show 49 drop in violent crime uh in
[02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:43.400]  the last 20 years because of gun proliferation the predators are absolutely scared but then
[02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:49.080]  they want to say oh a child can't have a bubble gun a child can't have a water gun oh you're
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:54.140]  kicked out of school you talked about playing cowboys and indians or cops and robbers this
[02:17:54.140 --> 02:17:58.780]  is the sovietization of our country exactly and it's like the you know them going into
[02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:03.900]  movies after 9 11 and removing the twin towers like like what happened to never forget they
[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:08.180]  want you to not remember you know it's the memory hole yeah and it just or taking trailers

[02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:19.480]  all that stuff happens it's like what are you doing it's like that's not the problem
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:23.520]  why are we spending money and time and all these but everyone has a bleeding heart thing
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:27.800]  about them and they like to jump on that bandwagon whether it's it's towards the right cause
[02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:31.660]  or not the right cause or whatever but when sure they make it easy and and kind of a fake
[02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:35.940]  sentimentality just just kind of easy get on the bandwagon feel good about yourself

[02:26:20.940 --> 02:26:25.820]  it at our shows if you get a vip package to our shows that we're doing you can see a early
[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:29.060]  screening of it but we're going to be rolling it out throughout the year in different mediums
[02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:33.780]  but it's a it's a film and dude it's actually got for what it is it's got deep deeply rooted
[02:26:33.780 --> 02:26:39.020]  ties in like the book of enoch and sacred geometry and things about change and rebirth
[02:26:39.020 --> 02:26:43.160]  and all that so you know it's it's pretty wild i'm into you know i get into all that
[02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:47.760]  stuff anyway i'm i'm into fighting the new world order i'm also into to reading every
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:50.980]  kind of religion well you need to know about that stuff because they're obsessed with it
[02:26:50.980 --> 02:26:55.180]  but use it for bad yeah yeah man absolutely and you know everything from Dianetics to
[02:26:55.180 --> 02:27:00.660]  the book of enoch i've read it all i get into absorbing what what is what cultures are obsessed
[02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:05.140]  with religion and and these kind of every angle yeah every angle of it you know so so
[02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:08.540]  it all kind of comes out but i'm real proud of the record uh you know and shooter jennings
[02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:11.140]  dot com is the place to kind of stay where you can find out where the film's going to
[02:27:11.140 --> 02:27:16.060]  be and and all that shooter jennings dot com you know everybody's given their kids names
[02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:21.380]  today which i think is cool like you know rocker or or uh you know shooter or gunner
[02:27:21.380 --> 02:27:26.380]  but one of my friends you know uh son's just named uh you know rocker and he is he is a
[02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:31.980]  really cool kid he can do back flips and stuff and uh on um on the wakeboards but i mean
[02:27:31.980 --> 02:27:36.100]  having the cool name shooter for a long time that's cool as a little kid it sucked man
[02:27:36.100 --> 02:27:39.620]  because it's real easy to turn that into something like pooter or something when you're in school
[02:27:39.620 --> 02:27:44.180]  you know i hate this name but you know but by about 20 i was like yeah it's pretty all
[02:27:44.180 --> 02:27:48.580]  right it's treated me good do the girls like it the girls like it now they do my son's
[02:27:48.580 --> 02:27:54.260]  name is blackjack so i'm waiting to get old enough to do you blackjack jennings yeah oh

[02:28:02.580 --> 02:28:09.380]  that's about it oh when they get the id card exactly wayland jennings like really they
[02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:13.260]  like to make an example out of me that's been fun they always do though they always sometimes
[02:28:13.260 --> 02:28:16.260]  they don't know who you are and they think waylon jennings who do you think you are boy
[02:28:16.260 --> 02:28:19.220]  exactly or when they find out that i am they're like well we're gonna definitely throw the
[02:28:19.220 --> 02:28:22.340]  book at him make an example out of him that he's not gonna get off it because he's wayland
[02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:25.580]  jennings son you know anytime i've been in trouble they've usually tried to make an example
[02:28:25.580 --> 02:28:30.820]  out of me there's there you go that's the system for you and what's the point of that
[02:28:30.820 --> 02:28:34.500]  i don't get how like the corrupt are supposed to always get off in the system and then good
[02:28:34.500 --> 02:28:38.580]  guys they go after them yeah i guess they're good old boys never doing harm they're in
[02:28:38.580 --> 02:28:42.380]  trouble with the laws of the day they were born there you go exactly man you know that
[02:28:42.380 --> 02:28:45.920]  kind of gets cheesied by the dukes of hazard which is still a funny show but we actually
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:49.940]  listen to that song that's a really good short country song it is man you know and he wrote
[02:28:49.940 --> 02:28:53.700]  it the funny story about that is that he was he was supposed to write the song and couldn't
[02:28:53.700 --> 02:28:56.460]  write it couldn't write could write it and they were on their way to the screening for
[02:28:56.460 --> 02:29:00.340]  the for the networks of the first episode of the film and he wrote it in the bathroom
[02:29:00.340 --> 02:29:04.300]  on the way that day and just coming up with something you know i mean and it's funny that's
[02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:09.940]  like his biggest hit you know so as a kid you know everybody watched dukes of hazard
[02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:13.580]  so it's easy to kind of be like yeah my dad did that song you know that's everyone knows
[02:29:13.580 --> 02:29:18.060]  that show but it's actually kind of poetic even though it's simple yeah i'm just a good
[02:29:18.060 --> 02:29:22.520]  old boy you know my mama loves me you know it's like she don't understand they keep a
[02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:26.060]  show in my hands not my face on tv you know that's right but anyways we're gonna get more

[02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:32.780]  that during the break and where you think society's going because what black ribbons
[02:29:32.780 --> 02:29:36.020]  came out two years ago two years ago and i feel like it's more true now than it was then
[02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:40.420]  it just it's amazing it's not just evergreen it's like a blossoming evergreen yeah man
[02:29:40.420 --> 02:29:43.860]  i'd say it's just everybody is so afraid of everything and that's the way they and the
[02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:48.340]  answer is get over the fear yeah yeah you have to be fearless to be able to walk into
[02:29:48.340 --> 02:29:51.500]  the fire you know what i mean you have to be able to not be afraid to lose your life

[02:35:46.140 --> 02:35:51.220]  I guess they're after the concerts and I know a lot of your shows are sold out because about
[02:35:51.220 --> 02:35:55.380]  a year ago you were in town and it was a couple days before and I heard about it and it was
[02:35:55.380 --> 02:35:57.620]  sold out is tonight already sold out down in San Marcos?
[02:35:57.620 --> 02:36:01.940]  I don't think so man it's funny because like I don't think most of the shows aren't sold
[02:36:01.940 --> 02:36:05.820]  out you know which is your awesome one was a year ago or so when you were here it may
[02:36:05.820 --> 02:36:09.540]  have been it may have been I think I think that was when we were here with Cody Canada
[02:36:09.540 --> 02:36:12.220]  the departed maybe I think that we were doing a little tour with them that when you're with
[02:36:12.220 --> 02:36:15.580]  Willie Nelson you play with them too a lot of you sometimes yeah man you know his son
[02:36:15.580 --> 02:36:19.220]  Lucas is really I don't know if you've ever checked him out he's real good and his album
[02:36:19.220 --> 02:36:22.380]  is called The Promise The Real and he's kind of in our mindset you know.
[02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:25.140]  Yeah I was talking to some of my friends that went and saw Willie recently and they said
[02:36:25.140 --> 02:36:29.100]  his son was out there like him and smoking his arm sounds just like him it was amazing
[02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:31.980]  the two together yeah we're doing it Lucas and I are doing a record together we're about
[02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:35.260]  halfway done with it oh wow so that's good that's gonna be a cool thing too and it's
[02:36:35.260 --> 02:36:38.760]  really more like a English rock sound and southern sounded English rock kind of Dave
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:41.980]  Mustang was here two weeks ago I know that guy I mean I've never met him but I've like
[02:36:41.980 --> 02:36:47.500]  seen his all his talk I love how he says what he wants yeah he says what he wants it's just
[02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:51.100]  that we ended up hanging out with Willie's son that was that was amazing Willie Nelson
[02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:56.540]  Dave Mustang a Megadeth now getting back to what you were saying during the break I mean
[02:36:56.540 --> 02:37:02.020]  where it's all going getting out of this fear box yeah and we were talking about Obama get
[02:37:02.020 --> 02:37:06.220]  back into that well yeah man you know I do believe that at this day and age you have
[02:37:06.220 --> 02:37:10.260]  to be fearless like that moves on every level musically or what you make I think what you
[02:37:10.260 --> 02:37:15.260]  say all that kind of stuff the fearlessness is the thing you have to have to make a change
[02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:19.880]  because they the one thing that the government the one thing that the record labels all these
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:24.820]  radio they like to keep the fear of not being included is part of a big thing they want
[02:37:24.820 --> 02:37:29.140]  to control the system but we're close to breaking that yeah it's like in music alternative media
[02:37:29.140 --> 02:37:32.620]  yeah yeah right you're right I mean in the you know the boxes they keep us and you have
[02:37:32.620 --> 02:37:36.180]  to think outside of those boxes and like it's like with Obama man I mean it's like I tell
[02:37:36.180 --> 02:37:39.440]  everybody it doesn't matter if it's Obama or Republican candidate at this point whoever
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:43.900]  makes it to the very furthest point to be be the two people you're choosing between
[02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:47.300]  both of those people two generations back go back to the same people controlling the
[02:37:47.300 --> 02:37:51.780]  people controlling the banks pulling the strings the people whose whose investments are being
[02:37:51.780 --> 02:37:55.660]  protected by whoever is going to be the president I had lots of people and they get mad at me
[02:37:55.660 --> 02:37:59.700]  all the time for saying this call me conspiracy theory and crazy but you know that when Obama
[02:37:59.700 --> 02:38:02.820]  happened they were just like oh it's all going to change now he's going to fix it it's so
[02:38:02.820 --> 02:38:08.860]  nice it's so wonderful and yes and it is great for the history of black America and the oppression
[02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:13.700]  and all those things that happening but the reality get rid of all those you know glistening
[02:38:13.700 --> 02:38:18.180]  facts that make it the whole experience so magical you look at the end of the day it's
[02:38:18.180 --> 02:38:22.020]  the same people that are pulling the strings and they're never going to have our interests
[02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:26.300]  and somebody like Ron Paul if he was younger and also he would never get to that point
[02:38:26.300 --> 02:38:30.060]  they're never going to let that happen it's going to have to be somebody who's got an
[02:38:30.060 --> 02:38:34.180]  agenda on the inside to break the system who's not letting the outside people know about
[02:38:34.180 --> 02:38:38.500]  it to get into that wow that's profound you know I thought that a lot either we change
[02:38:38.500 --> 02:38:43.420]  things as a cultural revolution of liberty person by person that's the surest path but
[02:38:43.420 --> 02:38:47.140]  yes there are more and more people who are kind of halfway sold out who more and more
[02:38:47.140 --> 02:38:51.980]  are clicking yeah it's not even so much that they've infiltrated as a liberty lover it's
[02:38:51.980 --> 02:38:56.020]  that they're starting to get where this road leads and they look in their children's eyes
[02:38:56.020 --> 02:39:00.240]  just like you say in summer of rage thanks man it's true it's true man and it's like
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:04.600]  we're in a we're in a place where the only way and you know David Ike said this and it's
[02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:08.660]  something that I and it was in a very small issue he was talking about there something
[02:39:08.660 --> 02:39:12.540]  to do with the garbage cans in London but spying on you with chips yeah but yeah but
[02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:19.140]  like saying that the only way to get to to have success in fighting this kind of oppression
[02:39:19.140 --> 02:39:24.180]  is for everyone to bond together in defiance like to say we're not gonna do what you're
[02:39:24.180 --> 02:39:29.020]  telling us exactly no I've said that stop complying at every level yeah stop complying
[02:39:29.020 --> 02:39:32.180]  you have to you know like it says in this summer age speak loud when they try to science
[02:39:32.180 --> 02:39:35.580]  when they try to silence and withhold when they try to fight us and that's the thing
[02:39:35.580 --> 02:39:39.340]  you know say we're not gonna fight you when you want us to fight you and we're not gonna
[02:39:39.340 --> 02:39:43.020]  be quiet when you want us to be quiet I forget the Berkeley speech during the civil rights
[02:39:43.020 --> 02:39:46.860]  movement but the man says you got to put yourself against the machine yeah and just say look
[02:39:46.860 --> 02:39:51.300]  I'm not going to stop until you stop and that's it just they put up this image that we've
[02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:55.340]  all got to be heroes by ourselves and fix it all overnight and slay the dragon like
[02:39:55.340 --> 02:40:00.500]  King George instead it's lots of little battles we've got to just put our weight against the
[02:40:00.500 --> 02:40:04.620]  machine and folks if you can't put a lot of weight that's fine put a little weight because
[02:40:04.620 --> 02:40:08.020]  I'm going to tell you once you start putting a little weight it feels so good to resist
[02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:11.540]  just you're gonna put all your weight and that's why there's this small community mom
[02:40:11.540 --> 02:40:15.520]  and pop stores right now in this economic decline it's so important to strengthen the
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:19.740]  small community because those corporations are starting to fail they don't get that success
[02:40:19.740 --> 02:40:23.780]  they want this goes I'll go 10 miles out of my way to go to a mom and pop even if the
[02:40:23.780 --> 02:40:27.780]  food isn't as good I agree I agree because it's like if you can strengthen that that
[02:40:27.780 --> 02:40:31.860]  small community that's how communities bond together that's how revolutions happen you
[02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:35.660]  know and I really believe that and the same goes for country radio if you want to use
[02:40:35.660 --> 02:40:39.340]  it as a metaphor for country radio and the way it works you have all this pop glistening
[02:40:39.340 --> 02:40:42.740]  they tried to block your dad yeah it keeps going back to that didn't work the only way
[02:40:42.740 --> 02:40:48.340]  that that did backfired the reason why it backfired is because they amassed a real community
[02:40:48.340 --> 02:40:52.540]  of fans just like a revolution who they couldn't ignore anymore it's like all of a sudden they're
[02:40:52.540 --> 02:40:57.780]  selling as many tickets in his records as the pop acts without the help of the machine
[02:40:57.780 --> 02:41:01.740]  you're able to take over the machine and they did and that's why outlaw country so important
[02:41:01.740 --> 02:41:06.740]  anything yeah when the government's a bunch of crooks the Patriots are gonna be the outlaws
[02:41:06.740 --> 02:41:10.140]  exactly exactly it's just like the founding fathers were outlaws that's what they called
[02:41:10.140 --> 02:41:13.140]  them and it's like every Western movie you ever watched there's the corrupt sheriff that
[02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:17.140]  oppresses the entire town and the outlaws come to town defeat the corrupt sheriff and
[02:41:17.140 --> 02:41:20.340]  free the people that happens in every one of them and it's and it's kind of what it's
[02:41:20.340 --> 02:41:24.340]  the exact same thing well because well that really happened thousands of times yes in
[02:41:24.340 --> 02:41:28.820]  real history cases yeah yeah exactly in the Wild West and everything and it happened you
[02:41:28.820 --> 02:41:32.140]  know with the American Revolution it happened with everything well and so many times you'd
[02:41:32.140 --> 02:41:35.580]  have a corrupt railroad boss or I mean you see those Clint Eastwood movies those are
[02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:39.100]  based on a lot of real cases that we've covered on air with Pinkerton security would come
[02:41:39.100 --> 02:41:43.580]  in to muscle people and finally they kill some little girl a little boy and just one
[02:41:43.580 --> 02:41:48.100]  guy would stand up and then usually he might get killed but then everybody stood up yeah
[02:41:48.100 --> 02:41:52.340]  and see that's what the system knows they know that if they kill myself Ron Paul or
[02:41:52.340 --> 02:41:57.180]  somebody like that and make it obvious that it doesn't actually scare people when they
[02:41:57.180 --> 02:42:01.980]  see the Patriot get destroyed it's like obi-wan Kenobi by Darth Vader he lets him do it yeah
[02:42:01.980 --> 02:42:05.680]  he looks over and okay I'm really gonna beat you watch this yeah and then the Jedi's rise
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:09.340]  up you know and that and that's the truth man and that's why you have to be fearless
[02:42:09.340 --> 02:42:12.700]  and you have to just like you do every day no matter what people think about you you're
[02:42:12.700 --> 02:42:17.260]  gonna say what you think and there's nobody who's gonna tell you off-camera so what to
[02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:21.300]  say or sway you in a direction have you had any trendies tell you not to call it the gunslinger
[02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:25.940]  tour you know what's funny is that hasn't happened because there's been more controversy
[02:42:25.940 --> 02:42:30.740]  over a couple bloggers and people thinking I was putting death threats out on them with
[02:42:30.740 --> 02:42:35.300]  the song gunslinger before but I'm sure it'll hit us but you know the theme the lyrics that
[02:42:35.300 --> 02:42:38.940]  song are about being misunderstood it says don't you know don't call me an outlaw I'm
[02:42:38.940 --> 02:42:43.740]  a gunslinger it's like it's a different so I'm not I'm not I'm not here to make a ruckus
[02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:48.580]  I'm here to actually get a job done you know what I mean and that's kind of what I think
[02:42:48.580 --> 02:42:53.860]  I'm standing up I'm real I'm not a slave yeah I'm a gunslinger yeah yeah man yeah you know
[02:42:53.860 --> 02:42:58.660]  well expanding on that that's a thing now in the culture in this weird nanny state people
[02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:02.920]  use it to peck at somebody yeah and I know you've been very successful have you ever
[02:43:02.920 --> 02:43:09.480]  noticed that people manufacture now these cosmologies to then say someone is bad so
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:13.400]  they can produce a drama oh well of course I mean that that happens all the time you
[02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:16.940]  look at the way that they you know I'm again I don't I never supported George Bush I don't
[02:43:16.940 --> 02:43:20.560]  support Obama but you look at the way that when George Bush was on his way out and the
[02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:24.900]  economy went down and they were able the media was able to just be like let's put all of
[02:43:24.900 --> 02:43:29.540]  the focus on how bad of a president George Bush was so that the new guy coming in is
[02:43:29.540 --> 02:43:34.340]  going to seem amazing you're a theater guy you see that they were wetting everyone's
[02:43:34.340 --> 02:43:40.580]  appetites the bush people run the Obama people so they destroy destroy him to make the Savior
[02:43:40.580 --> 02:43:45.180]  look good so they would sell the whole agenda I mean it's all scripted yeah yeah it's it's
[02:43:45.180 --> 02:43:49.980]  so it's it's so beyond scripted and it makes me laugh it's like that movie wag the dog
[02:43:49.980 --> 02:43:53.480]  we were talking about the other day and Ryan our tour manager goes you actually think they
[02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:58.100]  do that and like they do it they did it a year later after it came out in Kosovo the
[02:43:58.100 --> 02:44:03.420]  very same thing yeah well it's the same thing the little girl oh we've got it the song Willie
[02:44:03.420 --> 02:44:07.660]  Nelson sings about the brown shoe oh we got to come up with a song about a shoe it's gonna
[02:44:07.660 --> 02:44:11.180]  make everybody's heartstrings about the fallen soldier you know and it's like god bless the
[02:44:11.180 --> 02:44:15.300]  soldiers of America like I'm beyond behind well exactly but while they're taking their
[02:44:15.300 --> 02:44:19.300]  guns and putting them in psychiatric facilities for no reason they then use them to wrap their
[02:44:19.300 --> 02:44:23.300]  agenda while their internal documents say they hate the veterans exactly man of course
[02:44:23.300 --> 02:44:26.520]  man and then finish your point about the veterans I interrupt well no I'm just saying that I
[02:44:26.520 --> 02:44:31.140]  think that you know the veterans are the thing in this country that that that are on the
[02:44:31.140 --> 02:44:34.780]  front line and they're going to do the right thing always by it but I just feel bad for
[02:44:34.780 --> 02:44:38.780]  the fact that at the top of the chain there are people that are not looking out for the
[02:44:38.780 --> 02:44:42.060]  well see that's why the globalists love and hate the troops who want to go to all robots
[02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:45.860]  and drones in their own words so they'll thought that you know follow orders unquestioningly
[02:44:45.860 --> 02:44:49.460]  and engage in war crimes yeah they've got to try to find the psychos and promote them
[02:44:49.460 --> 02:44:54.260]  into black ops and CIA but there aren't actually that many of them because people that really
[02:44:54.260 --> 02:44:59.480]  have courage most of the time do it because of a guardian instinct and they've said once
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:04.340]  they see the lie they revolt that's why every authoritarian tyranny once it fully takes
[02:45:04.340 --> 02:45:09.020]  over wipes out the good police and military yeah that's why the police and military who
[02:45:09.020 --> 02:45:12.820]  don't know history need to understand if they fully take over which they're really trying
[02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:17.380]  to do now you're the first people they're coming after yeah it's just it's just I wish
[02:45:17.380 --> 02:45:22.100]  that that more you know police and these things actually have full disclosure as to what was
[02:45:22.100 --> 02:45:25.940]  really going on because a lot of the time it's just guys operating in the dark compartmentalize
[02:45:25.940 --> 02:45:29.180]  yeah and so you don't know how many soldiers come up to me at show then shows and tell
[02:45:29.180 --> 02:45:33.300]  me that that my music and Hank threes music and other people have really gotten them through
[02:45:33.300 --> 02:45:38.020]  hard times overseas and that's beyond something I can even comprehend because here I am you
[02:45:38.020 --> 02:45:42.620]  know just I talk a lot but I'm in the studio working in the safety of my own quarters and
[02:45:42.620 --> 02:45:45.980]  get to go home and be with my children and all this stuff and they're over there fighting
[02:45:45.980 --> 02:45:50.700]  the front line for us and for our freedom and so it's like it breaks my heart to see
[02:45:50.700 --> 02:45:55.340]  so much corruption going on behind the you know closed doors and well exactly you can't
[02:45:55.340 --> 02:46:00.080]  take away the fact that they're in a horrible situation and most of them signed up believing
[02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:04.420]  it was good even if they were conned and it's a lie it doesn't make them bad who it makes
[02:46:04.420 --> 02:46:09.980]  bad is now it's been well not declassified WikiLeaks they confirm it's real of course
[02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:13.440]  that they have torture camps everywhere but these special contractors the troops don't
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:18.040]  know they deliver the families in trucks there with bags over their heads and the trap talk
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:22.100]  the troops that's why they go back and commit suicide when they see some pot-bellied pedophile
[02:46:22.100 --> 02:46:26.300]  at the army camp taking a little girl in the guy didn't know what to do and goes home and
[02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:29.820]  blows his head off no don't blow your head off go speak out against what they're doing
[02:46:29.820 --> 02:46:33.420]  in the black sites yeah you see what I'm saying well it's terrible and it's it's terrible
[02:46:33.420 --> 02:46:36.980]  conditions in a lot of cases and then the worst thing that I see and I've heard about
[02:46:36.980 --> 02:46:40.620]  is just how they treat the veterans after they come back it's just like after Vietnam
[02:46:40.620 --> 02:46:43.940]  they come back and they're all you know they're strung out on drugs and there's these things
[02:46:43.940 --> 02:46:48.100]  then they don't have a home and you got these terrible situations for veterans and it's
[02:46:48.100 --> 02:46:51.620]  like now you know they've been in Afghanistan I mean there's the abundance of heroin the
[02:46:51.620 --> 02:46:55.060]  abundance of all these kind of things going on over there and it's just the things they
[02:46:55.060 --> 02:46:58.900]  see the things they have to do I just hope that they really in the future we have better
[02:46:58.900 --> 02:47:03.020]  treatment for veterans well I mean people back in the cowardly Empire yeah you know
[02:47:03.020 --> 02:47:07.260]  out here they're scared of the troops when they come home because they're scared of men
[02:47:07.260 --> 02:47:12.940]  yeah they're scared of they're scared of people they shouldn't be scared of and then they're
[02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:17.100]  not scared of the government who they should be concerned about yeah yeah I agree and they
[02:47:17.100 --> 02:47:20.220]  but they don't know a lot of people don't know what's going on you know this interview
[02:47:20.220 --> 02:47:23.460]  we got about 15 minutes left here with you shooter and we're gonna go to an interview
[02:47:23.460 --> 02:47:27.700]  for the nightly news then I'll dole that out there sometime next week shooter Jennings
[02:47:27.700 --> 02:47:32.760]  dot-com after you leave here what is it that you want to talk about that you forgot to
[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:37.220]  talk about but let's get in the time machine and come back to right now man that's hard
[02:47:37.220 --> 02:47:43.460]  to even say my mind gets going so fast same area but it's you know I'm just I'm just happy
[02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:47.260]  to be here and with you and talk about these kind of things because it does weigh on me
[02:47:47.260 --> 02:47:51.180]  man it's like I look at my kids growing up in this world and I look at what things are
[02:47:51.180 --> 02:47:57.220]  going to be and and it scares me it scares me that anybody just doesn't listen and doesn't
[02:47:57.220 --> 02:48:01.020]  open their mind to these things you know and it's musically people don't open their mind
[02:48:01.020 --> 02:48:04.500]  to music people don't know there's a whole wave of underground country artists that don't
[02:48:04.500 --> 02:48:09.900]  get any exposure because radios gatekeepers keep them out oh they put horrible fluff I
[02:48:09.900 --> 02:48:14.100]  can't listen to it's terrible even the so-called old-fashioned country stations air all this
[02:48:14.100 --> 02:48:19.340]  new stuff yeah and then they have they have whatever you call you know just like in government
[02:48:19.340 --> 02:48:22.740]  they have patsies that they set up they have artists they set up as their kind of outlaw
[02:48:22.740 --> 02:48:26.900]  country artists that they're trying to appease that appetite for but yet are still just part
[02:48:26.900 --> 02:48:31.300]  of the organization just puppets you know and it's just like everything operates on
[02:48:31.300 --> 02:48:35.980]  such a level that could be a same metaphor for the government you know but ultimately
[02:48:35.980 --> 02:48:41.100]  just talking about all this stuff and just just being able to have the freedom of speech
[02:48:41.100 --> 02:48:45.460]  to do it is what I enjoy doing being on here so what do you think is going to happen as
[02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:50.500]  the economy implodes as they rob the bank accounts in Europe Cyprus other places if
[02:48:50.500 --> 02:48:56.080]  they really try to keep pushing and and name libertarians constitutionalist conspiracy
[02:48:56.080 --> 02:48:59.920]  theorists and say we're bad I mean that's a throwaway line I don't want to hear culturally
[02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:03.980]  what you're saying that's totally pertinent you're just a theorist because you don't trust
[02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:08.620]  known liars I mean I'm worried about civil war in this country I am too because you look
[02:49:08.620 --> 02:49:13.300]  at with the treaty or with the deal that they're signing down here against Obamacare a lot
[02:49:13.300 --> 02:49:18.480]  of the people turning it's that I don't like to see everybody so disjointed I'd rather
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:21.520]  see two sides to be honest with you then I would like to see all these different things
[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:26.060]  but I think that that that what happens is the right side tends to get too caught up
[02:49:26.060 --> 02:49:32.020]  in some of the religious aspects and the abortion aspects all those things that the gay aspect
[02:49:32.020 --> 02:49:36.260]  the gay marriage and all that they really even the the weed thing like what I really
[02:49:36.260 --> 02:49:41.220]  would prefer to happen and I believe that all of that stuff I think I am a person who
[02:49:41.220 --> 02:49:44.620]  does believe that each individual has a choice to whatever they want to do but I also think
[02:49:44.620 --> 02:49:49.940]  that a lot of those those things are what's keeping progression on both the left and the
[02:49:49.940 --> 02:49:54.900]  right sure the system uses it as a diversion football issue not meaning people don't have
[02:49:54.900 --> 02:50:00.940]  points on the issues on both sides the issue is is it's used to distract from all the other
[02:50:00.940 --> 02:50:04.620]  why are we giving 85 billion dollars a month to foreign banks and then no one even knows
[02:50:04.620 --> 02:50:09.500]  that I know I know and yeah and I agree it's a distraction so I hate to see all that happen
[02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:14.320]  I just you know I would love to see someone stand up as a public figure that would actually
[02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:18.240]  have the interest of people in mind that could really relate to the youth as well as as the
[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:21.300]  older generation you know I think we're going to need something like that I think it'll
[02:50:21.300 --> 02:50:25.540]  happen I honestly am a big supporter of even this anonymous you do you follow anonymous
[02:50:25.540 --> 02:50:29.700]  in the in the college rape trial thing that was happening with that there's like the football
[02:50:29.700 --> 02:50:33.740]  team yes raped all the anonymous went through and revealed all this stuff and expose the
[02:50:33.740 --> 02:50:37.340]  corrupt sheriff and the and now the sheriff and the school we're talking this well look
[02:50:37.340 --> 02:50:41.740]  at WikiLeaks I've thought that's too good to be true but now it's releasing that Kissinger's
[02:50:41.740 --> 02:50:45.940]  a known criminal that they're torturing kids yeah I mean I don't think they're releasing
[02:50:45.940 --> 02:50:50.080]  that on purpose no no wonder they've been torturing Manning yeah yeah I mean maybe that's
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:54.260]  terrible by the way that the Manning situation that the hacker just now that died and the
[02:50:54.260 --> 02:50:57.540]  committed suicide in New York over all the pressure that was down on him when he'd done
[02:50:57.540 --> 02:51:01.480]  a lot of good things yeah I mean sure there's things that they're really well they're now

[02:54:38.100 --> 02:54:44.060]  an iconoclast uh smart guy very interesting and and check this out check out of your tv
[02:54:44.060 --> 02:54:52.100]  viewer uh they've got the new record out on vinyl and it is purple i mean the uh the tv
[02:54:52.100 --> 02:54:58.500]  camera cannot pick up how rich that is man that is that is cool man it's always the presentation
[02:54:58.500 --> 02:55:02.220]  is just as important to me is that you know when i was a kid i used to listen to record
[02:55:02.220 --> 02:55:05.300]  there's another way they've ruined everything because we have everyone downloads records
[02:55:05.300 --> 02:55:09.280]  as a kid i used to buy cds and sit in my room and listen to it and just look at all the
[02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:13.860]  art and look at all the imagery and and kind of tie it all together you know and that seems
[02:55:13.860 --> 02:55:18.820]  like a very lost art i like the black shield it's i mean uh the heraldry in it it's very
[02:55:18.820 --> 02:55:23.500]  striking yeah it was kind of like a family crest design was the idea behind it and that's
[02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:27.940]  why you know the last record we did a variation of it from this for this record we uh we have
[02:55:27.940 --> 02:55:33.580]  uh uh that being the kind of central logo for the record and i think it kind of a lot
[02:55:33.580 --> 02:55:37.220]  of things tie in that's a powerful you hadn't even told me it was a crest that's what i
[02:55:37.220 --> 02:55:41.580]  got from it yeah like keith kneltner that artist man he's got great vision and working
[02:55:41.580 --> 02:55:48.420]  with a guy like that is is really a pleasure what is the idea here like like what's the
[02:55:48.420 --> 02:55:55.540]  symbology you know a lot of the record is has been my journey and kind of uh kind of
[02:55:55.540 --> 02:55:59.380]  really understanding being myself without with fearlessness you know dealing with fearlessness
[02:55:59.380 --> 02:56:04.180]  i mean dealing with with what i i feel uh i'm expected to give to the wayland fans what
[02:56:04.180 --> 02:56:08.180]  i feel like i'm expected to give to my fans what i feel like all that and i think a lot
[02:56:08.180 --> 02:56:13.380]  of the record in this film we made one part of it is like my hair gets cut and i get shaved
[02:56:13.380 --> 02:56:18.140]  and it's like kind of like what's underneath all that a little bit is the real me you know
[02:56:18.140 --> 02:56:22.500]  as opposed to what what people think that i'm supposed to be or the perception of me
[02:56:22.500 --> 02:56:26.620]  and i think it's coming to terms with the fact that not everybody's gonna like me but
[02:56:26.620 --> 02:56:31.820]  i gotta put forth what is me you know by speaking my mind doing what i want to do regardless
[02:56:31.820 --> 02:56:35.500]  what anybody else is gonna think even the wayland fans even as much as i love my dad
[02:56:35.500 --> 02:56:39.860]  and he was a great dad and i'm proud of it i have to step out of that and say you know
[02:56:39.860 --> 02:56:43.300]  the very first line of the album that happens it says do you know who you are and that actually
[02:56:43.300 --> 02:56:48.740]  was as small of a piece that is was written during uh black ribbons and it's really about
[02:56:48.740 --> 02:56:52.260]  and and this is what i encourage with any artist that asked me what they should do as
[02:56:52.260 --> 02:57:02.940]  an artist is be yourself you know now expanding on that uh expanding on that you are absolutely
[02:57:02.940 --> 02:57:08.620]  right and if you're not real and true to yourself and if you don't even try to discover who
[02:57:08.620 --> 02:57:13.140]  you really are you will just take on the programming so really you're saying be conscious
[02:57:13.140 --> 02:57:18.380]  really live be a human don't be a dumbed down animal i mean good or bad it doesn't matter
[02:57:18.380 --> 02:57:22.380]  you can't always make the right decision in life but you have to own every decision you
[02:57:22.380 --> 02:57:27.900]  make and you can't i've learned this the hard way i've learned it by by being dishonest
[02:57:27.900 --> 02:57:31.580]  with people i've learned it by being untrue to myself making decisions that weren't true
[02:57:31.580 --> 02:57:35.580]  to myself and then paying for that later and people know it when you're not putting something
[02:57:35.580 --> 02:57:39.820]  real out there and i think when if you put something real out there and it strikes a
[02:57:39.820 --> 02:57:43.420]  chord with someone that's when it matters well more and more i've known this for decades
[02:57:43.420 --> 02:57:47.140]  but now it consumes my life and i didn't even know about the new record you know i mean
[02:57:47.140 --> 02:57:49.660]  i knew you were coming and i'm just focusing on it now because everybody gets caught up
[02:57:49.660 --> 02:57:53.220]  and busy sure but but everything in my life is accelerating and i think it's happening
[02:57:53.220 --> 02:57:57.900]  to other people as well in a quickening towards i only want to be around people that are real
[02:57:57.900 --> 02:58:01.500]  even if i don't agree with them or completely like some of what they do i'm sick of fakeness
[02:58:01.500 --> 02:58:05.980]  and lies and and bs man i agree it's like i don't have a problem you know these pop
[02:58:05.980 --> 02:58:09.460]  country artists i don't have a problem with their personal journey don't say there's anything
[02:58:09.460 --> 02:58:13.180]  wrong with it but the thing i have a problem with is insincerity and and the music that's
[02:58:13.180 --> 02:58:17.380]  put out there in the to the masses is insincere the news that is put out there to masses is

[03:00:53.380 --> 03:00:57.800]  on a rock in deep space what is this we were talking about i have dreams that come true
[03:00:57.800 --> 03:01:01.520]  you have dreams that come true i mean let's talk about that what is this there's definitely
[03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:05.380]  major stuff going on we don't see oh i big time i mean i've done all kinds of research
[03:01:05.380 --> 03:01:10.380]  into religion the occult everything like that i do believe i do believe that are there elements
[03:01:10.380 --> 03:01:14.860]  of play i do believe that there's god i do believe that there's or at least a force that
[03:01:14.860 --> 03:01:20.940]  is beyond our comprehension in which in which everything has i just don't i do believe in
[03:01:20.940 --> 03:01:25.940]  the science aspect of it and i also believe in spiritual like the importance of being
[03:01:25.940 --> 03:01:30.260]  spiritual whether or not there's a god whether or not there's like a dude in the in the you
[03:01:30.260 --> 03:01:33.740]  know in the clouds or whatever i think it's important for you to figure out a balance
[03:01:33.740 --> 03:01:38.260]  in understanding sure well they set science up against religion and the foolish people
[03:01:38.260 --> 03:01:42.140]  then argue it back and forth as a football issue yeah but i mean they're coming out with
[03:01:42.140 --> 03:01:46.740]  huge math equations and spectrometers and things and they're finding there's some other
[03:01:46.740 --> 03:01:51.320]  force containing and focusing things yeah and whether that be like the the scientific
[03:01:51.320 --> 03:01:55.780]  theory that there's a there's like a web and a net that everyone is connected in some kind
[03:01:55.780 --> 03:02:00.660]  of visible or non-visible form dark matter those ideas yeah that's it something as simple
[03:02:00.660 --> 03:02:05.300]  as is just believing in in in doing good do you know what i mean it's like it all it all
[03:02:05.300 --> 03:02:11.800]  kind of ties into this into a very very easy concept which is living and acting truthfully
[03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:17.320]  and accordingly just a good old boy never doing no harm no harm yeah well i mean absolutely
[03:02:17.320 --> 03:02:22.980]  it comes down to i have goodwill people say well what do you stand for goodwill yeah now
[03:02:22.980 --> 03:02:26.180]  if somebody crosses me screws me around i can be just as vicious as the most evil guy
[03:02:26.180 --> 03:02:30.960]  out there but i won't even do it an evil way i'm saying it's that i don't like doing people
[03:02:30.960 --> 03:02:34.980]  wrong i just don't get people that think they're getting ahead doing this yeah and people that
[03:02:34.980 --> 03:02:38.860]  are able to do that are people that have come from a situation those are the kind of people
[03:02:38.860 --> 03:02:42.320]  you have to be really scared of you know people can sit there and lie to you and know that
[03:02:42.320 --> 03:02:46.780]  they're doing harm to you they're all around you know what i mean and i'm just not that
[03:02:46.780 --> 03:02:51.020]  way i'm just not of that nature you know i'm sure i've made mistakes and sure i've told
[03:02:51.020 --> 03:02:54.860]  lies to people because i didn't want to upset them and sure when you're younger you go the
[03:02:54.860 --> 03:03:00.780]  point is as you develop i mean obviously you you choose a side yeah you do you do and and
[03:03:00.780 --> 03:03:05.700]  unfortunately there are a lot of people out there who who have chosen the wrong side of
[03:03:05.700 --> 03:03:08.940]  that you know and that's why you have that's what everyone is fighting against and it's
[03:03:08.940 --> 03:03:13.740]  unbelievable what people have done there are people that have done things to people that
[03:03:13.740 --> 03:03:18.740]  people would die just even hearing what they've done you know the kind of audacity and war
[03:03:18.740 --> 03:03:23.140]  crimes and things in government even even people's lives and their livelihood being
[03:03:23.140 --> 03:03:28.320]  taken away over bets i mean even if you look at the Mitt Romney kb kb toys thing they would
[03:03:28.320 --> 03:03:32.140]  think with that company how they shut down kb toys yeah as like a thing it was a mom
[03:03:32.140 --> 03:03:38.300]  and pop organization you know all that stuff i feel again we get back to that at the small
[03:03:38.300 --> 03:03:42.180]  community it's funny i was saying this between one of the breaks when i watch 90s television
[03:03:42.180 --> 03:03:45.820]  i grew up in the 90s and 80s and and really like i watched shows like beavis and butthead
[03:03:45.820 --> 03:03:52.220]  and seinfeld and all that i mourn for the innocence that we had as a culture back then
[03:03:52.220 --> 03:03:56.740]  because things were so much better and now there's so much more heaviness after 9 11
[03:03:56.740 --> 03:04:00.340]  and terrorism and the wars and that we haven't i'm sure that that generation felt the same
[03:04:00.340 --> 03:04:05.700]  way about the 70s or 70s but this is the end of the innocence really yeah and now people
[03:04:05.700 --> 03:04:10.180]  are getting so decadent they go let's be evil because it's cool and it's like hey you know
[03:04:10.180 --> 03:04:15.420]  evil in the image of the devil cheerleader man evil is like burnout cities and poverty
[03:04:15.420 --> 03:04:19.540]  yeah man i watched that movie god bless america the other day have you seen that no who it's
[03:04:19.540 --> 03:04:22.940]  all over the place but there was a there's a speech in that movie it's so important he's
