[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:32.320]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones ladies and
[00:32.320 --> 00:41.400]  gentlemen thank you for joining us on this Monday edition the ninth day of December 2013 we've got
[00:41.400 --> 00:45.720]  Dr. Jerome Corsi on the fact that Obama is trying to become a dictator and that that's now
[00:45.720 --> 00:51.360]  becoming mainstream news finally and what he thinks Obama is going to pull joining us for 30
[00:51.360 --> 00:55.080]  minutes at the bottom of the next hour I will open the phones up in this hour into the next hour
[00:55.080 --> 01:00.760]  for first-time callers long-time callers people that agree disagree have a question have a comment
[01:00.760 --> 01:04.160]  will open the phones up I'll give the number out the next segment there's obviously a ton of
[01:04.160 --> 01:09.160]  important news by the way you know that Lieutenant Colonel Bateman who wrote an article for Esquire
[01:09.160 --> 01:15.160]  magazine saying we will take it from your cold dead hands your guns we will confiscate everything
[01:15.160 --> 01:23.720]  but smooth bore muskets the black powder guns for hunting turns out he does work for Homeland
[01:23.720 --> 01:31.000]  Security and it turns out that he actually called up a friend of mine who's an army formerly an
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.080]  army officer who works in a local business I'm not going to say his name in fact Matt hasn't
[01:37.080 --> 01:40.840]  even there's his first name said that I couldn't talk about effect he wants to come on the show
[01:40.840 --> 01:48.280]  but I'm going to wait and the point is he sent Bateman a email saying how dare you be an army
[01:48.280 --> 01:53.400]  officer and talk about taking guns and what are you doing in photos wearing some royal
[01:53.400 --> 02:00.520]  metal around your neck I dare you to call me Bateman called him yesterday from England he lives
[02:00.520 --> 02:05.960]  in England so I made these Benedict Arnold jokes of him being looking like a red coat in the photos
[02:05.960 --> 02:12.440]  that's because we think those are British medals and the point is is I had Nico this morning call
[02:12.440 --> 02:19.400]  the number and he's at work and his wife works for the State Department by the way he told Matt
[02:19.400 --> 02:25.080]  all this and like a long conversation this in fact I'll just call Matt up right now
[02:27.800 --> 02:30.840]  what I do with my phone I actually had my cell phone just a minute ago in my hand
[02:30.840 --> 02:37.160]  I can't keep track of everything anymore ladies and gentlemen in this crazy office
[02:38.200 --> 02:46.360]  the point is is that it's that she said Bateman should be home in a couple hours and we'll see
[02:46.360 --> 02:54.520]  if he calls us up and comes on the show but it is certainly pretty crazy to have this type of
[02:54.520 --> 03:01.880]  stuff going on and when when we said we're with info wars Nico said she goes oh info wars I know
[03:01.880 --> 03:09.000]  that I bet they do so I really want to get this guy on the air and I'm going to be nice I'm
[03:09.000 --> 03:15.320]  letting him talk but the big thing is it looks like he responds to being taunted so if Bateman
[03:15.320 --> 03:22.600]  doesn't come on the show he's a chicken so there you go he needs to come on and say all this stuff
[03:22.600 --> 03:28.760]  and reportedly I saw comments on info wars that he's been contacting other people via email and
[03:28.760 --> 03:34.200]  Facebook and stuff so he's apparently a busy beaver scroll down he's got some British royalty
[03:34.200 --> 03:39.720]  hanging around his neck I mean this is getting really weird and so I was saying you know moved
[03:39.720 --> 03:47.560]  another country I guess he has at least he lives in England and he's over there I guess promoting
[03:47.560 --> 03:57.000]  King George the 18th or something so that's just some of the news that we have that we have on
[03:57.000 --> 04:04.680]  that front today guys I think I may have left my phone in McBrain's office on his desk because I
[04:04.680 --> 04:09.000]  was in there talking to him about 30 months ago I don't know let's just call my phone and walk around
[04:09.000 --> 04:15.080]  the office till we find it please it's not really a phone it's a government-issued trojan horse
[04:15.080 --> 04:22.120]  slave tracker microwave oven to fry my brain but it has a lot of uses so I've accepted the
[04:22.920 --> 04:33.000]  the gift made by slaves forged in pain and evil the satanic palace of communist Chinese
[04:33.000 --> 04:41.800]  slaved ends and I do attempt to use the evil ring of Mordor as a tool against Mordor but
[04:41.800 --> 04:49.080]  we all know how that ends ladies and gentlemen we'll be right back with all the big news and more
[04:49.080 --> 04:54.920]  and maybe lieutenant colonel we're gonna get your guns Bateman and I want to reach out to all these

[08:32.760 --> 08:39.960]  ladies and gentlemen we are live and we are broadcasting worldwide on this ninth day of
[08:39.960 --> 08:48.120]  december 2013 the year is extremely long in the tooth as they say well i'm looking at drugs
[08:48.120 --> 08:55.800]  report dot com the top story putin dissolves state media one of the biggest state run media
[08:55.800 --> 09:02.440]  outlets in russia has been dissolved by hair putin he says i guess to save money and other
[09:02.440 --> 09:07.800]  things kind of like they're cutting back on the state run media here that claims it's not state run
[09:07.800 --> 09:13.000]  but is state run and now obama isn't letting them into press conferences and is just having his own
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.280]  media core put out info and seeing in is basically collapsing into entertainment
[09:20.520 --> 09:26.760]  it's the same deal all over the world japan basically declared martial law last thursday
[09:26.760 --> 09:30.840]  declaring anything they want secret and the government can basically do whatever it wants
[09:30.840 --> 09:36.120]  in the middle of their 20 year depression china is going into a depression and seeing a
[09:36.120 --> 09:42.600]  stock market as well as a real estate bubble implode right now and what happens when that happens
[09:42.600 --> 09:47.320]  all over the world what happened before world war one and world war two what happened before
[09:47.320 --> 09:54.360]  other big regional wars every time if an economy is bad in one country they don't tend to start a
[09:54.360 --> 10:01.160]  war but when when multiple countries bordering each other or geographically competing for larger
[10:01.160 --> 10:05.640]  markets like the south china sea and that whole area in asia and the pacific when you've got a
[10:05.640 --> 10:12.920]  bunch of countries in a global recession depression what do governments do to stay in power they
[10:12.920 --> 10:19.160]  start wars ladies and gentlemen that is a historical fact we keep telling you look for war to come
[10:19.160 --> 10:25.080]  as the global economy melts down and remember the globalist understand these cycles so they attempt
[10:25.080 --> 10:32.280]  to actually orchestrate the cycles hijack the cycles surf the cycles in their own words like
[10:32.280 --> 10:38.920]  the silver surfer you know coming in as the harbinger of doom behind him to to destroy the
[10:38.920 --> 10:47.640]  planet and thermal nuclear war i guess the silver surfer is the harbinger of galactus
[10:49.640 --> 10:55.000]  i mean that's basically what we're dealing with here and that's why i get angry by the average
[10:55.000 --> 11:01.160]  person in a checkout line going hey elix like your show by the way did you watch the ut game
[11:01.160 --> 11:06.120]  and i'm like you like my show and you're asking me about football well yeah but you got to have
[11:06.120 --> 11:11.880]  some fun yeah i got it you got to have some fun but i'm not going to have fun watching what they
[11:11.880 --> 11:18.040]  tell me to have fun watching because there's more propaganda in the ads and during the football
[11:18.040 --> 11:24.120]  games than anywhere else and i'm just digressing i just want to stop this and and i feel like i'm
[11:24.120 --> 11:30.360]  not doing enough i feel like i don't have enough energy and focus okay so i'm not kicking you out
[11:30.360 --> 11:36.280]  there or or or angry at you and i'm not on a high horse i'm just telling you folks there's a good
[11:36.280 --> 11:41.160]  chance they're going to start world war three in the next decade and it might start next week
[11:42.920 --> 11:48.600]  it might start next year but almost every analyst go go look at all the top military analyst
[11:48.600 --> 11:52.840]  ministry of defense reports out of england department defense reports here the chinese
[11:52.840 --> 12:00.600]  governments reports them the the german reports the eu reports the japanese reports i've got some
[12:00.600 --> 12:10.040]  of them right here today in fact they are saying that we are literally hardling hardling towards
[12:10.040 --> 12:18.200]  massive war and remember what dick cheney did back in 888 when the olympics started launching a sneak
[12:18.200 --> 12:26.920]  attack on areas of russian held northern georgia south of sedia and abkhazia
[12:29.240 --> 12:35.640]  our media ran with the hoax worldwide that the russians had attacked and i'm not romanticizing
[12:35.640 --> 12:39.800]  the russians i just don't want to start a war with them and the russians rolled in medium range
[12:39.800 --> 12:47.880]  mobile trucks with medium range thermal nuclear weapons on them and said on european and russian
[12:47.880 --> 12:54.920]  television in russian and english if nato forces do not pull back and stop and don't stop landing
[12:54.920 --> 13:00.200]  new forces at the capital of georgia we're going to watch nuclear missiles at you and europe
[13:03.080 --> 13:07.560]  and and and during the human missile crisis that was a big deal because they were on our doorstep
[13:07.560 --> 13:13.400]  and we were in the right to say get your missiles out of here well now here's the west on their
[13:13.400 --> 13:19.400]  doorstep but the difference is we it was number one news story and people literally losing sleep
[13:19.400 --> 13:25.080]  because they should have in both governments when nuclear war almost happened in 1961
[13:27.480 --> 13:31.960]  now this stuff's happening and the average trendy literally
[13:31.960 --> 13:42.120]  wants to show off their mismatch socks or how big their mustache is or you know tell me the
[13:42.120 --> 13:49.080]  latest martini which is fine cool i like your mustache i like your style i like your martini
[13:49.080 --> 13:54.440]  the point is is that's not the culture in fact historically a culture like that
[13:54.440 --> 14:01.240]  is what you see right before a world war as well things are always very decadent the roaring
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.960]  20s before the depression all of it i mean we are just on the edge of destruction
[14:10.200 --> 14:15.000]  we are surfing the apocalypse ladies and gentlemen and and it's already the apocalypse
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.600]  in central africa it's already the apocalypse the people's pension funds in europe it's already
[14:20.600 --> 14:28.360]  the apocalypse in areas in china with the slave camps and i'm just here saying we better decide
[14:28.360 --> 14:35.640]  can we get this ship fixed and get the holes fixed and and and get the pumps running or do we go to
[14:35.640 --> 14:41.560]  the lifeboats because let me tell you something folks if you try to go to the lifeboats too late
[14:41.560 --> 14:48.040]  that's the worst time and i'm asking myself that same question in my own life in my own family
[14:48.040 --> 14:52.760]  i'm so caught in the routine of the radio the tv everything we cover and do here
[14:54.200 --> 14:59.000]  that obama has become a dictator officially no one even denies it now doesn't mean he'll
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.840]  stay in office but he is a he's made the office totally dictatorial autocratic by every yardstick
[15:05.560 --> 15:09.960]  and it's getting worse by the day now and i'm just here taking it as well
[15:12.440 --> 15:16.520]  i can't even we're always so busy or i'm always so tired i'm at home at night
[15:16.520 --> 15:23.480]  i can't discuss with my wife preparations or what do we do or what's our plans i i just
[15:24.440 --> 15:29.800]  i don't blame anybody for not knowing what to do because i don't know what to do
[15:33.320 --> 15:41.560]  i mean do i run to switzerland do i run to iceland do i run to
[15:41.560 --> 15:53.320]  taz mania do i run to new zealand do i run to the south pacific
[15:55.960 --> 16:00.840]  because believe me ladies and gentlemen i don't care about money money's like fuel in a gas tank
[16:00.840 --> 16:05.640]  for me it's fuel to do what i want to have some security to be able to stand up for myself
[16:05.640 --> 16:11.720]  that's all of this in fact it's a it's a burden our responsibility to try to make the money to
[16:11.720 --> 16:16.920]  run the operation and have enough in reserve to operate and mess with it and and everything
[16:18.760 --> 16:24.440]  money means after about 250 protesters following us around all day and those sleet and rain in
[16:24.440 --> 16:31.400]  dalis from 10 a.m until about four o'clock broadcasting live being beat up by the police
[16:31.400 --> 16:38.200]  the 25 or 30 people left i could take them over to the hotel and buy them all dinner and buy them
[16:38.200 --> 16:49.960]  all hot drinks whether it was cocoa or a hot toddy that's what i want money for and that's money
[16:49.960 --> 17:01.000]  well spent but i tell you i mean the only reason i'm still on air the only reason i'm here
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.920]  at the helm of info wars is because i know we've got a chance of beating these people
[17:05.480 --> 17:10.760]  by reaching out to the power structure and and those in the infrastructure throughout the strata
[17:10.760 --> 17:17.800]  in corporate ecclesiastical governmental private lives home schoolers public schoolers police
[17:17.800 --> 17:26.120]  military bureaucrats the writing is far beyond being on the wall it is flaming it is naked it
[17:26.120 --> 17:34.200]  is loud it is bold it is like sirens and red flags and explosions going off and start guns
[17:34.200 --> 17:40.120]  going off i mean it's like the fourth of july rolled into the kentucky derby rolled into a
[17:40.120 --> 17:50.040]  hydrogen bomb going off just we can hear the air raid sirens culturally historically i mean it's
[17:50.040 --> 17:54.120]  just and that's why the elites so corrupt now they've actually gone to the phase of grabbing
[17:54.120 --> 18:00.280]  everything not not nailed down and running that's the big sign is all the rich are running out of
[18:00.280 --> 18:05.480]  europe running out of israel running out of the us running out of they're all running to the north
[18:05.480 --> 18:10.440]  of canada or they're running to idaho or they are there it's even in us today they're building
[18:10.440 --> 18:15.480]  giant bunkers they're getting private security they're buying weapons systems why because they
[18:15.480 --> 18:23.560]  know what they've done and we've done it too letting them do it you want to know who's the
[18:23.560 --> 18:28.520]  blame for all this folks and i say this to myself as well we ought to create an intro with clips of
[18:28.520 --> 18:32.760]  v talking where he says you know how bad the establishment is v says if you really want to
[18:32.760 --> 18:37.000]  know who's behind it you are just look in the mirror and that's right and i'm willing to look
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.720]  in the mirror and that's why i don't want you calling up telling me how great i am
[18:43.640 --> 18:49.080]  telling me how much you appreciate me listen we are on a ship that is freaking sinking man
[18:49.080 --> 18:53.960]  we got enemies running around putting more weapons systems on the bottom of it trying to sink it
[18:54.680 --> 18:57.880]  because they're already going to be offshore it's a very tiny elite that want to actually
[18:57.880 --> 19:02.760]  bring down civilization very tiny we're talking about a few thousand globalists here that really
[19:02.760 --> 19:07.800]  know the master plan they've written on it too i mean we know what their plan is but they're even
[19:07.800 --> 19:18.520]  their minions even their adjuncts even their protégés do not know okay now we've decompartmentalized
[19:18.520 --> 19:23.640]  their operation and others have and now it's getting viral spread because people are one whoa
[19:23.640 --> 19:27.800]  i checked into this guy he's telling the truth and i'm not telling you something that i deserve a
[19:27.800 --> 19:35.320]  medal for the enemy published at all that's been their miscalculation they're proud of their evil
[19:35.320 --> 19:41.960]  but you and i and all of us together have to get really aggressive peacefully and politically
[19:41.960 --> 19:49.960]  and economically now ahead of all hell breaking loose depression war civil war
[19:51.160 --> 19:56.360]  just absolute nightmares we have to admit this is happening and be able to turn it around
[19:57.240 --> 19:57.880]  be right back
[20:00.120 --> 20:04.120]  Alex Jones here and i want to tell you about a long time friend of the show
[20:04.120 --> 20:10.520]  my patreon supply as you might remember this is the company that stood up to the dhs and exposed

[24:28.200 --> 24:36.920]  esquire this bateman character guys reprint me those articles please well matt pierce and
[24:36.920 --> 24:43.000]  sent a email to one of my friends matt pierce and it was in the army sent an email to guy
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.880]  challenging him to man up and call him and explain himself and the person called from england
[24:47.880 --> 24:58.200]  saying he is the colonel bateman and said basically that he defends his stance then there's another
[24:58.200 --> 25:03.240]  bateman of the exact same name who's also a colonel who says he is not this guy so we're
[25:03.240 --> 25:07.640]  going to have another article out by paul watson to ascertain exactly what's going on and clear
[25:07.640 --> 25:12.440]  that up but regardless you've got the small wars journal and people that teach at west point
[25:12.440 --> 25:18.280]  a whole bunch of them now and at texas saying and teaching that they're going to repeal the
[25:18.280 --> 25:23.880]  second amendment and that is the issue here so we're going to develop the proper not even
[25:23.880 --> 25:31.320]  so much correction but clarification and our apologies to the other bateman so that is coming
[25:31.320 --> 25:37.960]  up and we'll get all of that all of that lined up properly all right folks here's the good news
[25:37.960 --> 25:45.080]  people are starting to wake up to what's happening and here's an article out of the huffington post
[25:45.080 --> 25:50.520]  of all places talking bad about their dear leader obama faces backlash
[25:53.560 --> 25:56.280]  because of secret trade deals
[25:59.080 --> 26:06.280]  the obama administration appears to have almost no discussion with anybody
[26:06.280 --> 26:10.920]  and they're keeping the entire plan secret in fact guys will you print me this and printer
[26:10.920 --> 26:16.280]  friendly thanks a lot this this wasn't printed and printer friendly so i could actually read
[26:16.280 --> 26:21.240]  that article on air for folks but that was brought to me by somebody else not your fault nobody's
[26:21.240 --> 26:27.000]  fault point is is that uh there it is obama faces backlash over new corporate powers and secret
[26:27.000 --> 26:37.640]  trade deal there's the full headline by zack carter up on the huffington post so there is that
[26:37.640 --> 26:45.720]  report here is another one barack obama's de facto totalitarian nation that's the intrepid report
[26:45.720 --> 26:51.880]  going through the examples of total tyranny and the dictatorship from the india to obama care
[26:51.880 --> 26:56.840]  here's another one by the new american why are key obama policy shrouded in secret
[26:58.440 --> 27:02.920]  congress investigates obama's attempt to become a dictator we have all those links
[27:02.920 --> 27:09.000]  up on info wars dot com cruise senator cruise flams the lawless that's a quote
[27:09.560 --> 27:15.560]  implementation of obama care that's right it's totally lawless how they've now taken the unconstitutional
[27:15.560 --> 27:20.760]  criminal tax law that's what it is it's a tax spring court ruled it i told you it was attacked
[27:20.760 --> 27:26.600]  foreign banks and globalist pirates and now he says he'll implement whatever he feels like
[27:26.600 --> 27:31.240]  on any given day so if you're an insider you're exempt if you're not you're totally hammered
[27:31.800 --> 27:38.200]  and this is the genius of tyranny so the good news is uh this is starting starting to come out
[27:38.200 --> 27:42.360]  you know they said you could keep your doctor and your price would go down to the cost of a
[27:42.360 --> 27:48.840]  telephone or cable bill well now a z kill a manual the doctor who helped write it he's the main
[27:48.840 --> 27:53.240]  architect says you could keep your doctor as long as you're willing to pay more at videos
[27:53.240 --> 28:01.800]  up on info wars dot com from fox news sunday told chris wallis that so uh there you go he said of
[28:01.800 --> 28:09.480]  course you could keep it like obama said but he meant pay more and we have we have that clip
[28:09.480 --> 28:19.480]  let's go ahead and play that clip here for viewers isn't it a factor that a number most in fact of
[28:19.480 --> 28:25.480]  the obama care health plans that are being offered of the exchanges exclude a number of doctors and
[28:25.480 --> 28:29.960]  hospitals to lower costs the president never said you were going to have unlimited choice of any
[28:29.960 --> 28:35.480]  doctor in the country you want to go let me wait wait no he asked a question if you like your doctor
[28:35.480 --> 28:40.920]  you can keep your doctor did he not say that sir he didn't say you can have unlimited choice it's a
[28:40.920 --> 28:45.880]  simple yes or no but did he say if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor yes but look if you
[28:45.880 --> 28:50.200]  want to pay more for an insurance company that covers your doctor you can do that this is a matter
[28:50.200 --> 28:56.120]  of choice we know in all sorts of places you pay more for certain for a wider range of choices or
[28:56.120 --> 29:01.800]  wider range of benefits the issue isn't the selective networks people keep saying oh the problem is
[29:01.800 --> 29:06.360]  you're gonna have a well if you lose your doctor or you lose your hospital let me just say something
[29:06.360 --> 29:10.600]  people are gonna have a choice of the whether they want to pay a certain amount for a selective
[29:10.600 --> 29:15.080]  network or pay more for a broader network which i mean your premiums will probably go up they get
[29:15.080 --> 29:19.480]  that choice that's a choice which means your premium may go up over what you were paying
[29:19.480 --> 29:24.360]  so that in other words no one guaranteed you that your premium wouldn't increase premiums have been
[29:24.360 --> 29:29.160]  going up the president guaranteed me i could keep my doctor under president and if you want to you
[29:29.160 --> 29:36.040]  can pay for it under president that's enough full clips up on info wars.com remember this is the same
[29:36.040 --> 29:40.440]  guy that said of course we're trying to bankrupt things and get rid of the single payer that's
[29:40.440 --> 29:44.920]  all they're doing is nationalizing it but it won't even be true socialism that's bad enough it's
[29:44.920 --> 29:52.600]  worse it's total fascism robbery foreign tax we're on the march the empires on the run

[33:38.520 --> 33:44.520]  towards a dictatorship but in our investigation to discover more about lieutenant colonel
[33:45.160 --> 33:51.240]  robert bateman we have learned a lot more if you're watching on tv you can see the original
[33:51.240 --> 33:57.400]  esquire story from last week it's time to talk about guns and the supreme court
[33:57.400 --> 34:04.360]  and it says lieutenant colonel robert bateman now when you look up lieutenant colonel robert bateman
[34:04.360 --> 34:11.560]  you get this gentleman if you're watching on television who contacted us and said i am not
[34:11.560 --> 34:16.680]  the person that we didn't link to his linkedin but we showed where it came from and it fits the
[34:16.680 --> 34:24.680]  exact same name and looks like another bateman who says he works for the agency the private
[34:24.680 --> 34:29.160]  policing agency so these guys might be related or something i mean they look very very similar
[34:29.160 --> 34:33.640]  it's now become a mystery and that's all a side issue we're going to clarify that in the article
[34:34.440 --> 34:39.400]  but the other robert bateman who lives in the us who he says this is a photo of
[34:40.040 --> 34:44.920]  is not the guy that said ban the guns he's a this guy's reportedly says he's a patriot
[34:45.480 --> 34:50.200]  so imagine that'd be terrible is another guy named alex jones who's a radio host and looked just
[34:50.200 --> 34:56.040]  like me and was saying i guess there are seven and a half billion people so we're going to figure
[34:56.040 --> 35:02.200]  out give the bottom of this but we apologize for any um any uh angry phone calls or whatever but
[35:02.200 --> 35:07.720]  you know used to her emails there was an alex jones that lived in austin who was also a videographer
[35:07.720 --> 35:13.240]  and photographer and i guess websites like silver spider or something he would call me an email me
[35:13.240 --> 35:18.840]  and say would you please tell your listeners that i'm not you i get hundreds of communications a week
[35:18.840 --> 35:25.240]  and threats and everything else and i'm like sorry same name it's an act of god an act of randomness
[35:25.240 --> 35:33.960]  with your parents but how do you have a colonel bateman a colonel bateman uh who is the same name
[35:34.760 --> 35:39.880]  okay now here's the deal this fell on my lap matt pierce and who's an army veteran good friend of
[35:39.880 --> 35:43.400]  mine we go out and do some shooting you see him and some of the brothers of arms tv shows
[35:43.400 --> 35:50.280]  and he's also the great chef out at the steiner steakhouse he's taking a break right now uh away
[35:50.280 --> 35:55.320]  from running the show over there and some of the best steaks in texas uh to uh come on with us and
[35:55.320 --> 35:59.080]  i don't just say that because they're my friends that's i go eating there all the time and of
[35:59.080 --> 36:03.560]  course you see my buddy shane stoner sit stoner and the rest of the folks bobby stoner but the
[36:03.560 --> 36:11.000]  point is is that a lot of people got angry by this and and and so somehow and i need matt's help on
[36:11.000 --> 36:20.760]  this to email uh our producer because he found the real contact to robert bateman colonel robert
[36:20.760 --> 36:29.000]  bateman bob bateman that he found the real contact the guys in england sent him a contact and said
[36:29.000 --> 36:34.440]  how dare you say things like this you want to call me back and defend yourself as a fellow army
[36:34.440 --> 36:40.520]  veteran the guy called him back this weekend and so matt let me know and sure enough he gave me the
[36:40.520 --> 36:45.960]  number he called on from england his wife answered it's him and when he gets home from work he's
[36:45.960 --> 36:51.160]  supposedly going to come on so he needs to come on for himself so that this can be separate from
[36:51.160 --> 36:58.360]  the other uh mr bateman and so we can clarify all these statements in esquire uh and other places
[36:58.920 --> 37:05.000]  okay because the issue is there's a bunch of other colonels at west point and in foreign wars uh small
[37:05.000 --> 37:11.400]  wars journal and the rest of it saying war with a tea party gun confiscation cold dead hand the
[37:11.400 --> 37:18.040]  point is this is part of a major move okay and this is what forbes and others have been covering
[37:18.040 --> 37:23.640]  for a long time not just us so i wanted to get matt pierce and on he's got to go in just a few
[37:23.640 --> 37:28.200]  minutes to tell us how we contacted him and then off air tell us what the real contact is because
[37:28.760 --> 37:32.840]  we have his phone number from you this is obviously the real guy he you know they admit yeah this is
[37:32.840 --> 37:40.760]  the guy because i want to try to you know clarify this guy from the other guy so you talk to him
[37:40.760 --> 37:47.160]  and and you told me in text we haven't talked at length yet we'll do that on air that indeed matt
[37:47.160 --> 37:52.440]  he called you back and you had a lengthy conversation and that he defended uh all of this
[37:53.320 --> 37:59.000]  so matt pierce and thanks for coming on hey thanks for having me out okay so so tell us how you
[37:59.000 --> 38:06.200]  contacted him and tell us uh what he said to you okay well i guess basically the contact was made
[38:06.200 --> 38:13.160]  i'm a i'm a organization um i was on their forums and i had noticed that nobody had really written
[38:13.160 --> 38:16.760]  anything about him and i've been reading about him in the news for the past you know a couple days and
[38:17.400 --> 38:22.520]  i've been to topic and they talked about him and it didn't take long before and enraged a bunch of
[38:22.520 --> 38:30.120]  the guys on that website they're all you know most of them are either retired or active duty or veterans
[38:30.120 --> 38:36.840]  from the police force or the armed forces and there's a lot of backlash a lot of people really
[38:36.840 --> 38:43.400]  upset with what he said and one guy posted his email address so uh after sitting around making
[38:43.400 --> 38:48.120]  beer chili and drinking beer for a couple hours i decided it was time to send him an email and uh
[38:48.120 --> 38:53.480]  uh basically told him i wanted him to go out and publicly apologize to all the troops and and uh
[38:53.480 --> 38:58.200]  for the fact that he is an oath breaker and has gone against what he's for uh to protect the
[38:58.200 --> 39:05.480]  constitution um about 20 minutes later he emailed me back uh i emailed him again i switched emails
[39:05.480 --> 39:09.720]  with him a couple times and the final one i you know i put my phone number on there today you
[39:09.720 --> 39:14.680]  know give me a call i don't really want to sit here and type emails back and forth and to my surprise
[39:14.680 --> 39:18.920]  last night he called me back which i don't know what the time difference is but i think he said
[39:18.920 --> 39:22.600]  it was three or four in the morning and uh yeah he said by everything that he wrote in that article
[39:24.040 --> 39:29.160]  well now there's a new horrifying twist there's another lieutenant colonel robert bateman according
[39:29.160 --> 39:38.920]  to uh capital link world who who looks a lot like the other one that's on this law enforcement
[39:38.920 --> 39:44.520]  consulting site where the real bateman is and can you imagine being the other lieutenant colonel
[39:44.520 --> 39:51.160]  robert bateman who isn't this guy i mean boy that i feel sorry for him yeah he mentioned to me that
[39:51.160 --> 39:56.280]  he's had over 3 000 emails since he wrote that article and a lot of them were death threats and
[39:56.280 --> 40:02.440]  people threatened to rape his life and kidnap his kids or something like that and i try to keep
[40:02.440 --> 40:05.880]  really respectful of them because i respect anybody that served in the armed forces i mean
[40:05.880 --> 40:11.720]  i mean everybody's entitled to their own opinion even if it's wrong but uh and he and he i guess
[40:11.720 --> 40:15.000]  that was probably the reason why he reached out to me because when i emailed him you know the
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.680]  title of the emails but i respect that thanks for your service and then once he opened it up he
[40:18.680 --> 40:25.160]  realized that it really wasn't um you know his plan that he mapped out to me was he has a hundred
[40:25.160 --> 40:30.520]  year plan um to start disarming americans yeah but that's how they always do it they said we're
[40:30.520 --> 40:35.560]  going to do this over time and then really it's over 10 years that's a standard tactic right
[40:35.560 --> 40:40.840]  right i mean you've got a constitution that's a couple hundred years old so i mean
[40:41.560 --> 40:45.480]  the thing that you can start disarming people now and then and have it in 100 years from now i mean
[40:45.480 --> 40:49.560]  that's you know it's all the same every week you don't care about somebody else attacking the
[40:49.560 --> 40:53.480]  second amendment so it's just discouraging to see it from an officer and the military
[40:55.080 --> 40:59.560]  i know when i was in officers didn't come out and just openly say things like that because
[40:59.560 --> 41:05.000]  they would probably be relieved of their command if not of their service and on top of that i can
[41:05.000 --> 41:11.400]  understand how a guy who's lieutenant colonel is writing from a magazine um and apparently he has
[41:11.400 --> 41:15.800]  a blog too and he writes all kinds of craziness in his blog too so i don't i don't understand i
[41:15.800 --> 41:22.680]  don't think that that would be tolerable tolerable for anybody to do that well we're sorry for the
[41:22.680 --> 41:28.360]  collateral damage but how can you know when there's another lieutenant colonel uh robert bateman linked
[41:28.360 --> 41:33.640]  in as the other guy i think that's an example of the internet i feel sorry for other alex jones
[41:33.640 --> 41:39.560]  there's like eight of them live in austin i've been told by them that by multiple alex jones's
[41:39.560 --> 41:45.240]  will you please tell your listeners that i'm not the alex jones they think i am and to stop coming
[41:45.240 --> 41:50.760]  to my house and i'm like i'm sorry they just google alex jones yeah yeah there's one of the other
[41:50.760 --> 41:57.240]  alex jones's yeah and i mean that's not me i'm sorry go ahead what i said i'm sure that other
[41:57.240 --> 42:01.880]  colonel's probably getting some hate mail too i'd imagine oh no he sent us an email and he said this
[42:01.880 --> 42:07.000]  is not me and uh you know we have the same name but i'm getting hammered so again i i just feel bad
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  for him everybody needs to who did get it wrong it's like i didn't need to apologize to him as well
[42:11.720 --> 42:15.320]  but but he wants me to take his picture down i think we should have his picture on there to say
[42:15.320 --> 42:20.120]  this isn't the right guy or it'll just continue on but i gotta call the guy and find out you know
[42:20.120 --> 42:22.920]  even when you try to journalistically get everything right sometimes when there's these
[42:22.920 --> 42:27.160]  weird act of god's coincidences you know there's nothing you can do you know except correct it
[42:27.160 --> 42:32.440]  afterwards is that that's the picture of the guy that kind of white hair in the glasses that going
[42:32.440 --> 42:36.920]  around right now i think that that picture of him was actually on the uh the link to the article that
[42:36.920 --> 42:42.680]  i read yeah and if you follow it well that's in case of the internet getting it all scrambled
[42:42.680 --> 42:48.360]  this guy is not the guy i'm showing people on tv and i think we have photos have you found a photo
[42:48.360 --> 42:52.680]  man of the real one no i haven't but i've been mentioned i was talking to some people and i was
[42:52.680 --> 42:56.920]  saying that you know this guy did not look like and i know you can't really look at a picture of
[42:56.920 --> 42:59.960]  somebody and say hey that didn't sound like it would be that guy but i mean this guy sounded a
[42:59.960 --> 43:05.720]  lot younger than uh than the picture that you say the wrong guys i mean that probably makes a
[43:05.720 --> 43:10.440]  little more sense yeah there's shots on the defense side of a shaved head guy who looks a lot like
[43:10.440 --> 43:16.440]  this guy but younger okay well there's all guys that are on both people's website talking about
[43:16.440 --> 43:20.760]  it right now one of them said he works for department of homeland security so no no no i mean i mean
[43:20.760 --> 43:27.000]  the one that did this for uh esquire who wrote the article for esquire you basically tracks back
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.320]  to that so yes well didn't you say you learned his wife works for the state department you know
[43:31.320 --> 43:35.560]  the real one that that wrote the article that you talked to right right that's what he told me last
[43:35.560 --> 43:41.000]  night right i don't know how the i think he probably got he we were speaking of what the
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.400]  purpose of the second amendment was he said it was to stop the slave rebellions i asked him if he
[43:45.400 --> 43:49.960]  thought that it was uh had anything to do with the protection of uh tyrannical government he said
[43:49.960 --> 43:54.440]  no absolutely not you know why don't you trust your government and at that point i was like well
[43:54.440 --> 43:58.440]  you know look at bin gazi look at the irs look at everything that's going on right now and he's
[43:58.440 --> 44:03.160]  like oh what do you think happened to gazi because that was all over a youtube video i was at that
[44:03.160 --> 44:07.880]  point i was kind of like okay i didn't know that anybody was still taken by that story i thought
[44:07.880 --> 44:11.560]  that was already debunked but apparently you know he said yeah my wife works for state department
[44:11.560 --> 44:15.160]  i'd wake her up and let her but you talked to her right now but yeah that was the video they caused
[44:15.160 --> 44:21.560]  all that well i love this why do you need guns trust your government that's famous last words
[44:21.560 --> 44:26.440]  look at how the government's arming to the teeth against us and then he has these double-sided
[44:26.440 --> 44:32.840]  you know thinly veiled things like oh we will take him from your cold dead hands when you die
[44:33.480 --> 44:37.400]  right and then reportedly we're trying to track it but it looks like it's the right kernel because
[44:37.400 --> 44:41.480]  the other kernel didn't write it and it is on this other one's blog you know these questions about
[44:41.480 --> 44:45.720]  i'm sorry for what's going to have to happen to you now that's why we've called bateman
[44:46.360 --> 44:51.320]  and we have told him come on the show so so so we're ready for him to come on and he should put
[44:51.320 --> 44:55.960]  his picture out and be proud of himself so everybody can see it what else did he say about
[44:56.680 --> 45:03.160]  second amendment because it had nothing to do with slave revolts it did have to do with the
[45:03.160 --> 45:07.240]  french and indian war and the fact that the french would hire the indians to kill people the british
[45:07.240 --> 45:12.040]  would do it everybody wanted weapons and you were on the frontier but then it happened to do with
[45:12.040 --> 45:17.640]  self-defense i mean it's it's they're always trying to paint gun ownership as racist i mean the first
[45:18.760 --> 45:22.600]  you know gun laws were in the south against black folks the cook looks clan wanted
[45:22.600 --> 45:27.640]  wanted gun bans the nra was founded to arm blacks to protect themselves i mean did
[45:27.640 --> 45:33.560]  did you tell this guy any of that history you know history didn't really seem like something he really
[45:33.560 --> 45:38.920]  cared to talk about um and anytime that i brought up anything to do with the second amendment it was
[45:38.920 --> 45:43.880]  diverted to uh well this is the problem we have this violent culture and we have to change our
[45:43.880 --> 45:49.560]  culture um and the way that is oh you know you're allowed to have your double barrel shotgun and your
[45:49.560 --> 45:54.520]  bolt action rifle that holds five rounds and you know no more assault weapons as you know people
[45:54.520 --> 45:59.240]  like to call him and and every time i would say well you know what you know what is the definition
[45:59.240 --> 46:03.640]  of word and friends mean to you and uh he didn't want to you know he just kind of kind of just straight
[46:03.640 --> 46:07.320]  away from that but you know you know they've registered all the guns in new york and now
[46:07.320 --> 46:12.760]  they're banning everything five rounds and up and banning guns that can take a larger mag and
[46:12.760 --> 46:18.360]  using the uh purchase list to confiscate them and the goal is to take our guns so that's a classic
[46:18.360 --> 46:25.880]  scyop a classic scyop to say oh a hundred years to then introduce the idea that's all they're doing
[46:25.880 --> 46:31.240]  is acclimating right yeah and that's a whole another issue but i mean you know people say
[46:31.240 --> 46:34.600]  the registration doesn't lead to confiscation but look at the letter these guys are getting in
[46:34.600 --> 46:39.160]  new york city right now you tell me it's the legal for the government to hold a weapons
[46:39.160 --> 46:43.160]  registration obviously they do purchase a weapon these guys were able to you know track you down
[46:43.160 --> 46:47.080]  to your address and send you a letter saying hey i know what you got in your gun page and it said
[46:47.800 --> 46:53.160]  surrender your rifle immediately surrender your rifle i thought that was interesting i didn't
[46:53.160 --> 46:57.480]  i didn't think you could tell it for internet and something like that and not get laughed at
[46:57.480 --> 47:05.480]  but i don't know this guy seems to be on the same track so well you're absolutely right and
[47:06.200 --> 47:11.560]  look he's following bloomberg propaganda points because daily caller story went viral last week
[47:11.560 --> 47:16.680]  about new york city the few concealed carry holders or hunting rifle holders in the city
[47:16.680 --> 47:21.000]  are getting letters to turn their guns in that can hold over five rounds or take a larger clip
[47:21.000 --> 47:26.520]  up but it's statewide connecticut now has its registration going into effect
[47:27.560 --> 47:33.000]  in one month or less than one month so it's here and and they can't have it where they say oh we
[47:33.000 --> 47:39.320]  don't want your guns just let us restrict them and then some their goal is the abolition of force
[47:39.320 --> 47:45.640]  in the hands of the people and bateman says that in esquire yep i'm sure it and he'll stand by it
[47:45.640 --> 47:48.600]  if you get him on the phone tonight he's not going to back down from anything that he wrote on there
[47:48.600 --> 47:54.760]  at all well listen he needs to also clarify because the internet's got him listed
[47:56.280 --> 48:03.000]  you know with that photo and the rest of it so we need the real bateman uh to publicly come out
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.560]  and sounds like he's proud of himself and again so many of these people aren't even inherently
[48:07.560 --> 48:13.640]  evil they literally are fruit loops uh who doesn't know chicago new york dc of the highest crime
[48:13.640 --> 48:19.240]  rates mexico has a total gun ban and has the highest crime rate in the world only the criminals of
[48:19.240 --> 48:23.880]  government have guns i mean doesn't he really believes this i mean so he's a true believer
[48:23.880 --> 48:30.920]  who would call you in the middle of the night england time to talk to you and defend himself wow
[48:31.560 --> 48:35.160]  yeah i was shocked i was shocked when i got the number when the number came up on
[48:35.160 --> 48:41.320]  his i mean it's like said and like he was saying he had 3 000 emails that he was responding to
[48:41.320 --> 48:45.240]  but i mean this guy was able to return you know shoot emails back and forth with many every 10
[48:45.240 --> 48:50.040]  minutes and then call me immediately out of 3 000 other emails i thought that was kind of kind of
[48:50.040 --> 48:55.160]  strange but apparently uh you know reading up on the on the outkeeper side they said that he's
[48:55.160 --> 48:59.640]  pretty much reaching out to anybody that's reaching out to him i said you know if you email a guy he's
[48:59.640 --> 49:04.600]  going to email you back and you know it is what it is i gotta tell you what if it's the right one
[49:04.600 --> 49:09.160]  just so we have it on record then he wants to be reached out to uh give folks his email do you have
[49:09.160 --> 49:15.080]  it in front of you i don't have it in front of me but um it's like lieutenant lieutenant colonel
[49:15.080 --> 49:23.400]  robert bateman at yahoo.com so very similar to that i can i can give it to you uh i can i can
[49:23.400 --> 49:27.320]  tell you something and you can put it up there if you'd like to um yeah do this we're going to go
[49:27.320 --> 49:33.400]  to break and and let you go tell uh take a few minutes and then um you might text to me on my
[49:33.400 --> 49:41.160]  personal phone uh the email oh there it is it's uh it's on the yahoo story oh yeah well there you
[49:41.160 --> 49:45.000]  go that's how the guy was wondering how the outkeeper got hold of no no it's on it's on the
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.720]  escuar sites we need to make sure the right one gets added to our article that we're uh correcting
[49:49.720 --> 49:55.080]  or not even so much correcting clarifying it's r underscore bateman underscore ltc
[49:55.960 --> 50:00.840]  at hotmail.com we need to search that email in conjunction uh
[50:00.840 --> 50:06.520]  uh i guess watson did search that come up with the other photos so that's the problem
[50:06.520 --> 50:11.160]  is the internet's got it all spliced together that was the first time i got accused of being a lay
[50:11.160 --> 50:15.240]  catholic priest well somebody sent me an email that's not that it's bad to be a catholic priest
[50:15.240 --> 50:18.920]  and they said i know you're a catholic priest and working with a vatican and i said well who is it
[50:18.920 --> 50:23.960]  was like a 65 year old black guy but they didn't care so it was like proof because his name was

[54:27.640 --> 54:33.000]  this but it's so important finally the huffington post and basically a lot of other publications
[54:34.040 --> 54:41.560]  are saying wow obama is acting like a dictator on so many fronts including obama faces backlash over
[54:41.560 --> 54:50.040]  new corporate powers in secret trade deal handing governmental control over trade to private
[54:50.040 --> 54:54.520]  corporations and the agreement is even secret and we've been talking about this obviously for
[54:54.520 --> 55:00.440]  months but finally there i've got a whole stack of news i mentioned the headlines earlier where
[55:01.960 --> 55:08.120]  the lawlessness of obama is coming out because it is a dictator when one man decides to do whatever
[55:08.120 --> 55:17.080]  he wants now the truth is he's a front man for the globalist but still it is a puppet dictator
[55:17.080 --> 55:24.360]  and when you give the office the dictatorial power a lot of times the autocratic seat can
[55:24.360 --> 55:30.760]  actually be seized by a real dictator and not just a group of oligarchs and king makers behind the
[55:30.760 --> 55:36.680]  throne so this this this whole thing runs from bad to worse coming up seymour hirsch alleges obama
[55:36.680 --> 55:45.160]  administration lied on syria gas attack that's uh now out of uh yahoo news big story there three

[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.840]  i'm going to open the phones up if you are just joining us i'm going to recap some of the top
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:51.080]  stories but i'm going to put the phones up on mainstream media now being forced to admit that
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:56.360]  obama is completely dictatorial well if you're completely dictatorial and secretive in persecuting
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:02.680]  your opposition it means you're an authoritarian dictator and very autocratic not just a dictator
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:09.080]  not a malevolent dictator but a tyrannical dictator worse than even a malevolent there's
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:17.480]  certainly not a benevolent or the friendly loving dictator so obama is rapidly becoming the very
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:22.440]  worst type and it shows that the power structure that runs this country would rather have an
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:27.320]  oppressive dictator in countries that they overthrow and where they install people so of
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:35.080]  course this is a design and you see each president becoming worse and worse the problem is obama
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:41.960]  will get all these dictatorial gains and then by the time we get another president in with all the
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:47.560]  big problems that globalism has brought even if they aren't as overt as obama has been we're
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:53.480]  already in a quasi dictatorship look how they're restricting free speech look across the board

[01:02:54.680 --> 01:03:01.000]  a lot of times you can like every time you see a tsa minion who's been caught molesting some

[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:19.480]  which could take the form of a civilian airliner being forced to land

[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:37.640]  diet their congress basically declared martial law last week so they can do anything they want
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:42.840]  and have it be secret and and so it's the same deal governments everywhere this is what happens

[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:37.240]  war games and how serious this is with south korea now extending their air defense defense zone into
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:42.600]  chinese uh areas that they've now grabbed in international waters and the japanese expanding
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:48.840]  into that uh in day to day fighter jet and fighter bomber confrontations that look just like
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:55.080]  what we saw during the cold war is it saber rattling and just a political distraction let's
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:03.720]  hope so but this is how big wars start and you know that the us has quote pivoted the last two years
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:14.040]  to asia in a war scenario with the chai comps who have got thousands of nuclear weapons hundreds of
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:20.120]  large surface ships submarines and uh how many people in their army is it something like 15 million
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:26.040]  last time i checked the us is about a million and you could say oh what does that matter we'll just
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:32.040]  nuke them folks the globalists that run america have moved everything to china they're playing a very
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:41.960]  weird geopolitical double triple game so i don't even know what to say at this point it is so dangerous
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.880]  what the globalists are up to they're the threat not american gun owners ladies and gentlemen
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.680]  the evaluation of the dollar is the threat
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:57.480]  not home schoolers i mean you watch the news folks every time i watch a sitcom or a drama or a police
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:03.960]  show they pull over a horrible child molester or a drug dealer or whatever and they go oh you got a
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:08.360]  gun you're going to jail for that to create the illusion that guns are illegal and that's why cops
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:14.680]  nationwide will arrest you for a legal gun and the police station will stand there by them because
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:20.360]  they've seen it on tv that's what you're supposed to do american gun owners are the solution not the
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:26.280]  problem and i know most frontline police know that but the bureaucrats are fed run but let's go to
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:32.680]  this report here by john bound the japan times notes five out of nine weekly magazines that went on
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:39.320]  sale last monday and tuesday contained scenarios that raise the possibility of a shooting war with
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:45.080]  china as soon as next year in response to beijing's imposition of an air defense zone over the
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:50.920]  disputed senkaku islands the sunday main chi speculates that the communist superpower would
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:56.040]  utilize a false flag in the form of a civilian airliner being forced to land and passengers
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:02.760]  held hostage another scenario revolves around china targeting oil super tankers bound for japan if
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:09.880]  china were to target them nothing could be worse to contemplate wrote author osamu ia shuken gendai
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:15.160]  a weekly magazine sold by the largest publishing house in japan even speculated that chinese
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:21.560]  president chi jimping could order the shoot down of a japanese civilian airliner prompting a response
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:27.160]  from the united states that could lead to a fighter jet battle unlike japan the u.s military would
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:33.000]  immediately respond to a radar lock-on threat by shooting down the chinese planes according to
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:40.520]  saburo takai writing for flash china's intent on reclaiming the senkaku islands by force if necessary
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:46.840]  but still fears a military confrontation with the united states a concern emphasized by beijing's
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:52.840]  failure to respond to america's provocative b-52 bomber incursion of the air defense zone last month
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:59.720]  in recent months the chinese have boasted that their aircraft carrier task force rivals the u.s navy
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:05.560]  in october the pl a released a map of major u.s cities and how they would be impacted by nuclear
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:11.560]  attack launched from the pl a strategic submarine force and with bluster straight out of a science
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:17.320]  fiction novel the chinese media outlets announced plans to turn the moon into a death star capable
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:26.280]  of launching missiles towards any target on earth the fate of china and the united states
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:38.600]  have become linked in a way far beyond what any of us could imagine we are now facing a common
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:49.880]  challenge and the challenge is how to build a world order for the first time in history on a
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:59.000]  global basis or info wars dot com john bound reporting and there you go ladies and gentlemen
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.240]  that is what's going on in the society we're going to take calls for this segment and the next and
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:08.920]  then dr. Jerome corcy who worked in the state department and in special operations secret
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:14.040]  operations we'll just leave it at that very informed who has the connections he was the one
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:20.680]  saying before the last election look obama may become a dictator and i knew he wouldn't just say that
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:29.080]  if if that wasn't the word up there in dc and now he is a dictator but he's at that key
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:34.840]  point where if we challenge him and back him off then it can be a victory if we can reverse them
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:40.760]  during their offensive that's one of the best blows against a takeover if we just kind of
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:44.520]  complain about it as usual they're going to move forward i mean look how they've done
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:51.320]  obama care the total ripoff so now they're taking pension funds in california and michigan and
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:58.680]  everywhere they're going to take everything folks if we put thomas jeverson said the level of tyranny
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:07.080]  you will live under is the level of tyranny that you will accept so there's always bad people that
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:12.040]  will fill the vacuum if you've got a nation of sheep i mean if we all became sheep right now
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:15.720]  and and and started going out and there were no more humans and we and we and there were just
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:19.640]  millions of us walking around eating grass you would suddenly have wild dogs and coyotes and
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:24.200]  wolves coming back in and mass producing and mass they would suddenly eat almost all the sheep
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:29.080]  and then they'd have a mass die-off starvation scenario so we have become a nation of sheep
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:36.040]  and it is produced wolves it's just two plus two equals four i know common core teaches five
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:41.480]  because wolves don't want you to know how to add imagine if imagine if we were sheep you would
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:46.760]  have wolves in the class going two plus two equals five literally so the sheep wouldn't and like wolf
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:56.440]  is good sheepdog is bad and the sheep go sheepdog bad wolf good i mean obama good george washington bad
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.000]  jj in texas you're on the air go ahead

[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:15.000]  spirit of the new world order i think that we're being assimilated by the government to accept
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.160]  whatever they'll uh you know send us through the state run meeting i'm just not gonna accept that
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:27.240]  as a proud american well i agree with you so what do we do we fight back we have to fight back
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:32.280]  people are so desperate and uh people are poor these days they're trying to get on their feet and
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:38.040]  of course i'll accept help from anybody so they think the government's their friend and the government
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:44.360]  isn't set up to run uh you know our population the citizens are supposed to run the population
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:49.080]  that's where we need to get back to where the citizens take control not the government well
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:56.920]  that sounds like terror talk no i don't believe that i believe we can do something if we stand
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:02.520]  against the new world order we know what their plan is they want to take over financially economically
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:09.720]  socially and then literally play god and re-engineer the planet with geo-engineering in the seas on

[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:52.440]  we are going back to your calls judy in florida you're on the air go ahead
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:25:01.320]  hi alex um it's good to talk to you again um i'm really i'm wondering whether or not it's because
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:09.000]  of uh the actual political awakening that the the amount of chaos is being robbed because um
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:15.880]  i know that there's work being done by a lot of good people in a lot of states um and across
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:23.160]  america in general and it seems as though they're the only rational voices left and it seems like
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:30.280]  it could it could be you know open war uh internationally anytime now if you know the
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:35.880]  things aren't you know brought back into check um but i don't know how you feel about that are you
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:41.400]  there oh i'm listening to you yes ma'am yeah it's completely silent so i didn't know if it got cut
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:50.120]  off for something oh no i understand it's rare for the parrot to shut up no yeah well yes you are
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:56.840]  a parrot i'm not going to deny it um but you know it's like i i have talked to people in a couple
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:03.080]  different organizations and it's it's really uh disheartening and at the same time very encouraging
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:09.960]  i mean you know because there's a lot of feelings that you know the the real perpetrators i mean
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:16.520]  you know the the main things i believe are impeachment of obama and then if it could be possible and
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:22.600]  that's a lot of work that's being done is to reinstate last eagle i totally agree and and it is so
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:28.040]  incredibly shameful and really shows you how much trouble we're in that congress has had a few hearings
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:34.280]  about this but that they haven't moved to impeach him that certifies and sets the precedent on every
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:38.200]  front and actually i'm not like a parrot because parrots repeat what they're told but i do kind of
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:43.160]  squawk like one so i guess you could say i'm the i'm the parrot with a brain that's better than the
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:51.160]  the obama sheeple obama but expanding on that you're absolutely right we need to get rid of the
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:56.280]  unconstitutional banking laws they have right now that allow them to engage in all forms of
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:01.560]  counterfeiting and crime and then and then and then attach our tax money to back it up when it
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:08.440]  fails by design in a cloud and pivot strategy and then we've absolutely uh unequivocally
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:15.080]  have to move for impeachment uh to then roll up this entire group of criminals the attorney general
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:19.720]  all of them because that's the essence of dictator they're powerful they're in place they get away
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:24.440]  with murder uh and they set the precedent great points god bless you yeah i know i mean that's
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:30.200]  the solution is punish wrongdoers make corrupt government look over their shoulder getting
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:35.480]  politically involved keep government on a short leash or you'll be on a short leash and the good
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:41.160]  news is congress has a six percent approval rating the lowest ever recorded that but again that's
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:45.080]  because it's nameless and faceless to the average person they they think of that as the government
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:51.240]  they should just have a we should fund a gallup poll of uh but they never let you ask the question
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:57.000]  straight though or a roiders poll or a rasmussen or something about what your view of the government
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.680]  just just do you trust the government straight up straight up poll and i guarantee it's going to be
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:07.400]  less than ten percent ladies and gentlemen and that's good news the problem is they know they're
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:13.080]  being lied to they don't know how deep the water is it's like looking on a lake and saying i wonder
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:18.360]  how deep it gets out there bottomless uh let's go to travis in washington you're on the air
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:26.360]  alex hey buddy hello hey how you doing pretty good brother i got a first question for you um
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:32.840]  do your kids have birth certificates alex they do have birth certificates why don't you fund a lawsuit
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:37.800]  for id stuff then i mean somebody's got to be there sure um that's no no you're right because
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:42.520]  they they end up taking that and then putting it into the bonds and using them as collateral on
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:49.080]  the national debt that is a fact well who's holding the bond all right the person in possession of
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:54.680]  the bonds is the the actual fees and the doctors and the hospital that's right the imf world bank
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:58.680]  all of it they admit were quote human resources people ask well why do they have birth certificates
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:03.400]  i do that so i could get out of the country with them if i need to it's like i know i'm in nazi
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:08.040]  germany it's like saying why do i have papers then because because they've already got the
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:12.600]  biometric scans they've already we've already lost all these battles now we're so deep into the
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:18.040]  technocracy uh that you know it's a debate about being in the system or not being in the system
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:24.280]  i'm i'm i'm in the system to a great extent my children are homeschooled they go to a homeschool

[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:36.440]  live from austin texas it's alex jones
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:45.160]  well i can't think of a better geopolitical analyst to give us a state of the world than
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:50.120]  dr jerome coursey so i'm gonna try to shut up and give him the floor here in a moment when we go to
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:56.120]  him to break down the state of the planet where obama is going because even mainline analysts
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:03.720]  now are saying that we are on the verge of major war that the government's funding al-qaeda syahirsh
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:10.120]  has come out and said that uh clearly obama is lying and that al-qaeda was behind the sarin
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:18.280]  nerve gas attacks it was worldnetdaily.com wnd.com and info wars.com along with drudgerport.com that
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:23.320]  picked those up and magnified it that's drudgerport.com and we have to thank you so much for breaking
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:29.480]  through the electronic berlin wall that forced that out but now syahirsh is saying it and that's
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:33.720]  top story earlier today on yahoo news it was one of the top two three stories that's what i saw
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:39.400]  this morning so we're really having an effect here and we're accurate we make mistakes sometimes
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:45.400]  and we correct them but we try to tell the truth there's a big difference between us and corporate
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:50.360]  mainstream dominant state-run media we're going to talk to dr coursey about where obama is where
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:55.800]  all this is going the good news that more and more analysts are pointing out that he's operating as a
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:35:01.720]  dictator in the huffington post and everywhere else what does he expect to come out of that that's
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:08.440]  what's coming up with our guest here in a moment first off christmas is here the holidays for
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:13.960]  others as well and i think it's more important than ever to give the gift of truth and enlightenment
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:20.440]  and awakening this christmas and into the new year and that's why we have a spectrum of products
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:25.240]  that we've developed and that we carry that i believe are the best out there at info wars store
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:34.360]  dot com we have the pro pure water filtration gravity fed systems that are the lowest price on
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:39.720]  these systems you'll find anywhere with promo code water 20 you get 20 off that special will end
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:45.640]  on wednesday you still have to the 16th 17th or so to be guaranteed to get your packages before
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:50.760]  christmas but we suggest everyone again go to info wars store dot com and when you purchase
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:54.760]  the pro pure stainless steel systems that cut off the glyphosates the fluoride all of it
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:59.880]  it's the best system it's what i and my family use you're also supporting the broadcast and then
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:07.560]  we have the proprietary patented nascent iodine made in a special proprietary process where it's
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:13.000]  truly nascent iodine nothing else like it out there that's why i was looking for stuff to protect
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.720]  my family from the increased radiation Fukushima and came across this laboratory that's been there
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:22.680]  for 40 years producing this for more than a decade that no one even knew about it i just basically
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:27.560]  bought it out as a proprietary thing and i'm now popularized it because i was so blown away by it
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:33.000]  when i took it privately for two months it's now available double strength at the price of the leading
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:38.680]  competitor info wars life dot com to link in directly or info wars store dot com and we've
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:43.240]  rolled out the next three products it took a long time because we will sell no high quality
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:49.720]  supplements until it's time we have the fluoride shield itself that has six different things in
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:55.160]  including nascent iodine and it's in a two ounce model double the size of the fluoride shield
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:02.360]  the survival shield the survival shield is half the size of the overall fluoride shield
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:06.680]  it doesn't just pull out fluoride a bunch of heavy metals you name it it's in a two ounce model
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:10.120]  then we have the supermail vitality that i told you i take a half dose of
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.760]  because it gives me so much energy and quite frankly i'm already angry enough but
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:20.600]  this is the real raw herbs not the dried herbs and let me tell you just people took the nascent
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:24.840]  iodine and said man you're not getting this is really changed by clarity you name it i just
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:29.880]  take the supermail vitality we're coming out with a female vitality it's really the same thing
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:34.840]  a little bit different but females can take it to according to dr group and just try it for a week
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:40.920]  and if you don't feel it then i'm a monkey's uncle and i'll eat my hat because i'm telling you i only
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:46.200]  do the promote and sell what what really blows me away so those new products and finally
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.920]  wake up america immune support coffee my favorite coffee i've ever had is this particular medium
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:57.720]  roast from the high mountains in southern mexico from the Chiapas areas it's even better than

[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:40.120]  and again i want to thank all of you that are supporters of the broadcast by purchasing the
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:45.320]  products by becoming prisonplanet.tv nightly news subscribers uh by spreading the word about
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:50.040]  the broadcast by supporting our local m&f and affiliates and we're not just a platform here

[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:02.760]  all these scientists and researchers and activists and our authors and lectures and
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:10.360]  statesmen and women states women be politically correct uh really having a big effect and again
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:16.840]  i want to get dr coursey's take on hearings the last three weeks in congress that we've played
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.520]  clips of and covered here and i'm going to show you some of the articles that are here in my stack
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:29.480]  where they are now uh basically admitting that obama's acting in a totally dictatorial
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:34.920]  fashion the likes of which have never been seen on open borders uh on legalizing the
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:40.120]  legals on putting the military under nato uh arming al-qaeda without congressional approval
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:45.000]  i can't believe i'm even saying that it sounds so insane uh implementing obama care however he
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:51.480]  sees fit creating such big crises he then offers a solution they don't want to shift gears geopolitically
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:56.680]  to the middle east and asia what's happening there because dr coursey has the connections
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:02.600]  and the historical understanding he has a phd from harvard and political science 1972
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:07.320]  is currently senior staff reporter for world net daily where he works as an investigative reporter
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:15.320]  he's a multi number one new york times bestseller uh for his uh political uh analysis books and uh
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:21.800]  gerome coursey dot com is just one of his sites 1776 nation and he comes on now to give us the
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:26.280]  state of the world uh as things accelerate and the reason i wanted to get him back on this week
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:32.760]  he was the guy with with also joseph farah of world net daily who kept saying last year and
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:37.560]  they didn't support mccain against obama six years ago they said look it's worse than we thought
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:41.880]  they're going to persecute the entire media they're going to persecute libertarians conservatives
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:48.200]  constitutionalists they plan to totally take over the intel is they will actually totally take over
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:53.720]  red terror style now i'm like oh come on really really and then now as soon as he got in it got
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:41:00.520]  50 times worse so folks and they're usually pretty restrained folk people so now it's
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:05.960]  really coming true so a what is obama doing what's his plan how do we stop him dr coursey thanks for
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:10.760]  coming on oh it's always a great pleasure to be with you thank you you've got the floor you heard
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:15.560]  my big intro i mean what do we do where are we right now what's happening well so let me start
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:23.400]  here i mean i think the to me the tide is turning in that finally the american people are realizing
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:30.200]  that obama lies i mean i think it started with obama care when obama said you can keep your health
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:36.680]  insurance if you like it you know period and that turns out millions of americans are going to lose
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:44.040]  their health insurance their doctors their hospital now and and then obama and the administration knew
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:51.800]  this and decided to lie because it was the only way to get the legislation passed uh now we come to
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:58.360]  the most recent revelations you know the i think the cyhurge article is very important like you
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:05.400]  credited because it gives more mainstream media acceptance to what we've been reporting at wnd
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:14.040]  you've been reporting at info wars namely that these chemical attacks in syria were not the
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:19.960]  Assad government but they were the rebels launching the chemical attacks and this was being used as
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:29.000]  a pretext a total pretext by the obama administration to lie the american people into another war
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.960]  in the middle east this time supporting of all people al qaeda and the islamic radical
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:42.760]  mercenary rebels i mean it's remarkable who obama wanted us to support and let me end this
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:50.120]  little brief kind of introductory part by saying that it really was incredible that the lies now
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:59.080]  not only are obama care lies and syria foreign policy lies but even a lie on the obama family
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:07.560]  record his life story his birth is history uh with this uh uncle the uncle from kenya who
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:15.960]  ends up in immigration court uh in boston last week and said testified that obama had spent
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:22.440]  time in his apartment with them when obama was out harvard law school and obama in 2011 the
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:27.000]  white house denied that you know obama is running for reelection he didn't want to have anything to
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:33.640]  do with this illegal immigrant for 40 years from kenya and boston well last week the white house
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:38.760]  had to admit that in fact it was true after all the obama had spent something like three weeks
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:46.440]  living in this oh yongo obama the kenyan relative the uncle who was illegally in the united states
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:53.960]  for 40 years and it was all a lie to say obama did not know this uncle so i think what we're really
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:44:00.360]  seeing this is fundamental in the breakdown the the collapse of the obama administration the
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:06.200]  second term is that finally the american people are seeing they're being lied to and you know
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:12.040]  alex this is something you've said at info wars we've said at w&d since the beginning says obama
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:18.040]  was running for president in 2008 but it's a lie this fundamental transformation of america
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:25.720]  is a socialist or communist a revolutionary change in america and obama will lie his way through
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:31.560]  getting it done even such that we don't really know who this guy is what's his official name what's
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:37.160]  his story what's his background you know who really is obama in the white house we can't get the
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:45.800]  documents even today you're absolutely right and there's a lot of evidence we know who his real
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:53.240]  father was and it's just it's just so complex it's complex and i think you know where you're
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:45:01.560]  heading with this alex is exactly where i think we need to be heading with it and that is that finally
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:07.160]  the american people are realizing and the hearings as you pointed out you've reported the hearings
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:14.280]  i've attended and reported on the hearings are shocking you've got the irs you know going after
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:20.760]  conservatives and you know selectively picking out conservative groups and denying tax exempt status
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:29.160]  well by the way obama's other uncle malik in kenya gets retroactive tax exempt status on a four oh
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:34.440]  you know one of the tax deferred groups he set up in the united states a foundation that ends up
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  you know sending money to kenya for an uncle that the egyptian courts you know want to indict
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:48.040]  for managing money for the islamic brotherhood but the muslim brotherhood in egypt these ties
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:54.760]  and connections that obama has are finally coming forward and people are seeing that the obama
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:46:02.120]  administration you know with obama care selective enforcement borders no enforcement of the borders
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:07.800]  with even you know gun laws that obama says well i can't get a gun law through congress
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:14.840]  so i'll just sign these 23 executive orders and impose gun restrictions from the white house all of
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:22.520]  this is outside the constitution the president is not permitted to make up his own laws and finally
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:27.960]  we're getting constitutional i was shocked to see the constitutional law professor who at the last
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:33.560]  week testified the house judiciary committee that's a very liberal professor of liberal law school
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:40.840]  saying that obama is the enemy the evil that our constitution was designed to prevent
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:46.840]  that which suggests that you know impeachment is the only result of the only remedy for obama's
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:55.080]  lawless imperial presidency that's right and while you were talking about that for tv viewers i
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:47:00.760]  was showing a whole bunch of news articles admitting he's a dictator and we can always look back on
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:08.440]  hindsight on stalin malhead where all the classic dictators whole pot the del castro but most of
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:14.920]  the time at the time they're becoming a dictator people don't know it but with obama it's so clear
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:23.240]  that even if he leaves office he now cements the executive branch as a dictatorial autocratic
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:29.160]  oligarchy whatever bureaucrats whoever on the national security council so really i've suspended
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:34.680]  the release of obama deception too to come out and march down because i'm making it all about
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:39.800]  and it was already about this but now it's really about you either impeach obama or send somebody
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:46.040]  to jail and totally repudiate him or this definitely will bring the country down and
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:51.240]  that's what jonathan turley the law professor said that's what the cato institute law professor said
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:57.320]  that's what they all said because it's a fact it's not like it's like the sammy haygar song about
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:05.800]  uh you know he says it's a fact not my opinion and and that's what this is is that this is a fact
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:13.720]  this is absolutely on record what's going on here it's not our opinion it's like looking
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:19.080]  out in the pond and it's a yellow duck with a beak and it's got the got the feet and it's
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:25.160]  quacking it's a duck and if it walks like a duck if it quacks like a duck if it flies like a duck
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:31.080]  and it's eaten algae off the bottom of the lake like a duck it is a duck it is a dictator so what
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:35.960]  do we do because everybody's happy that he's imploding right now my gut tells me we're in the
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:41.880]  maximum danger of a false flag or letting al-qaeda attack us or launching a war with china i mean
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:46.440]  god knows what he'll do what are your inside sources saying and what does your gut tell you
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:52.520]  dr coursing well i mean i agree with you alex i think it's extremely dangerous time right now
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:58.840]  i mean look you've taken a lot of abuse we've taken a lot of abuse info wars wnd for reporting the
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:04.920]  truth the truth has gone back you know just to raising fundamental questions here for instance
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:10.360]  let's just take the middle east you know we we've both been reporting that the spin gazi is a lie
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:16.680]  there's no explanation yet for why obama and had to have been the white house order to stand down
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:24.440]  down from bringing you know some military force to bear to save ambassadors even stevens or try to
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:31.960]  save uh the you know these people from the the embassy in triply who were at this cia compound
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:38.440]  in ben gazi from being killed by a mob that we know look look look i was talking to a member of
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:45.960]  my family's actually been in 28 years 28 years in the army he said in libya in afghanistan pakistan
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:53.000]  it doesn't matter when one of their helicopters goes down they say angel down within five minutes
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:50:00.200]  the air is swarming and he said they had air cover all over libya it's pure bull sorry go ahead
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:05.000]  and listen look how lame it is the hearings i attended you know the government was saying they
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.520]  couldn't launch an airstrike from italy because they didn't know where they were going to refuel
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:15.080]  these planes every military pilot i've ever known would say forget about the airplanes we'll ditch
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:19.960]  them in the Mediterranean we're going to go save you know these brave americans under fire
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:26.840]  that's just such a bogus excuse uh and who knew how long this attack was going to last i mean
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:34.440]  and then what we're doing alexis we are continuing to have cia lies we're continuing to you know
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:42.280]  support al-qaeda the groups who are controlling libya today are al-qaeda and militant islamic
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:47.800]  groups the same as are in syria and the guns they're using are guns that were run illegally
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:54.120]  by the united states through christ evens in the syria that's right stay there i want to look at
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:58.200]  what you think obama is going to pull because that's really important is looking forward into the

[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:16.760]  all right folks out here back live with Dr. Jerome Corsi
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:24.440]  it it really is surreal to see the government openly turning over in the middle east al-qaeda
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:32.280]  openly trying to basically start wars in other parts of the planet with countries like china
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:37.880]  that we've built up i'm certainly not real romanticizing the communist chinese dr. Corsi
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:44.840]  shifting pivoting over to the pivot in asia and the devaluation of the dollar and just
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:51.320]  everything that's happening and the qe unlimited even a federal reserve regional heads apologizing
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:56.040]  saying this is the greatest transfer of wealth ever this will destroy us i already see incredible
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:55:01.960]  inflation but the media says oh no everything's fine what is front and center on your radar what
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:09.240]  do you expect the obama knots to do as he collapses uh and as even the huffington post says he's
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:15.080]  dictatorial on this asia trade deal uh what do you expect him to do just let their minion
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:21.160]  politically be pilloried or or or will they stage something i will stage something i was
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:27.160]  excited there's no doubt they could stage something i would get your feedback there if i am i coming
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:32.360]  through okay you sound pretty good a little bit distorted but go ahead dr look the what's
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:38.680]  ready to happen the next i think false flag or crisis on the horizon is the bursting of the
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:45.080]  stock bubble this is another stock market bubble just like the dot com bubble burst you've got
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:51.880]  you know that you had the housing market bubble burst both manufactured bubbles both engineered
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:59.480]  by the private bankers the uh central bank the you know which should be uh you know we're examined
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:05.640]  done away with the federal reserve a federal reserve right now buying our own debt which
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:13.560]  is preposterous in this qe whatever number it is three four uh we're going to have a bursting of
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:19.480]  the stock market bubble that's imminent it's right on the horizon it can happen at any time
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:26.360]  and when that burst there'll be a financial crisis that will be used to get more control
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:33.960]  i suspect alex it'll be staged to coincide with ramming this trans pacific and trans
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:43.720]  atlantic partnership through congress you know which will give the really an end to any sovereignty
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:50.040]  you know over economic dealings followed by a crisis saying well we're going to have to do
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:54.760]  something with the federal debt and maybe we need to collapse the dollar and move into
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:00.440]  international monetary control the bank of international settlements has been working
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:07.400]  to create an alternative to the dollar uh on you know as a standard of world trade
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:11.720]  i'm going to write an article we should have i'll give you a preview should appear probably tomorrow
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:21.080]  we just tracked uh in uh with aran that you know key to aran getting these lifting as sanctions was
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:28.120]  a aran agreeing to come back under international banking control aran paid off deaths to the
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:34.520]  world bank they're coming in line with their central bank they're stopping to oppose you know
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:41.800]  the world order uh international private bankers on the settlement of oil and dollars or whatever
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:47.800]  international currency the world bankers decide aran succumbed to the international bankers and
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:53.160]  again i think the next crisis that we're going to face there'll be a loss of freedom opportunity
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:59.800]  you'll forget about obama care when everybody is going bankrupt because the dollar tanks the
[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:06.440]  stock market bubble bursts that's i think the kind of major crisis that's in the works for obama
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:14.360]  to take put back on the agenda a power grab and take off the agenda impeachment which is building
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:22.360]  well said dr corcy i'm just stunned hearing you break it down so so well that's exactly what
[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:26.920]  they're doing they're preparing the war uh to distract everybody they're preparing a

[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:50.440]  as well there's so much to go over but dr corcy just in closing how are things going for the
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:55.400]  geopolitical establishment i know there's not one spider at the center of a web there's a lot of
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:01:01.320]  different spiders but they all basically follow the same cultures of centralization and cronyism
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:09.320]  whether it's socialism or fascism but now it's so naked just in the larger just salts sociologically
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:13.720]  because i know that's what you've studied at harvard and and also economics and then worked
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:19.000]  with the you know with the state department on things geopolitically where where where would
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:30.200]  you say historians will look back and say we are now and can we avert the cornucopia of uh
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:35.160]  hydra heads that are coming right at us well i i think you're right alex this is probably
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:41.080]  historically one of the most critical and dangerous periods of time in human history
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:47.800]  i it's the the new world order is running nakedly to the to the finish line you're at the nsa
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:52.920]  listening to every conversation i mean things that big brother control is right around the corner
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:02:00.120]  and you know finally obama is getting exposed as a fraud his personal history is a fraud
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:09.160]  his lying about obama care lying about ben gazi and syria all this is american people are catching
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:16.440]  on so the need to have a crisis the need to have a you know the bubble bursting in the stock market
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:23.480]  the need to have a new war and right in the wings ready to start at any time you know will Israel
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:30.840]  attack around i mean these some new tender box incident is going to have to occur because the

[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:16.840]  probably time to get him back on with an update because everything he's been publishing and saying
[02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:22.120]  has now been confirmed because i mean obviously he's an insider but it's just amazing how they lie
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:30.280]  and lie and lie while they're doing this remember a federal judge said that um a few months ago
[02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:36.680]  got to pull that quote back up that if the information on the nsa was known when he sealed
[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:41.480]  a bunch of it in the lawsuit it would quote bring down the government yeah but we already know
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:46.840]  they're persecuting the press with it the congress with it the members of hollywood with it they are
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:53.640]  using it for corporate deals they are spying on each other's wives and children and lovers and
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:10:00.440]  business partners and enemies i mean it it is a free for all of criminal activity with the big
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:09.320]  telecoms all tied into it ladies and gentlemen and i mean it is just amazing how criminal and
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:14.680]  illegal this is it is not to fight terrorists or keep you safe folks they run almost all the terror
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:20.280]  attacks and even if some of them are real which some of them are i'd rather face the dangerous
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:25.240]  some loon that have a big giant overarching government over me that it will obviously be a
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:33.880]  trillion times more dangerous that's simple and we've got other news here the judge federal judge
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:37.480]  and state judges have been ruling that you have no right to your public or private pensions
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:45.160]  if they've been you know tied into derivatives or other things and now budget negotiators
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:54.920]  looking at military pensions and this report is just incredibly incredibly important from
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:11:02.200]  politico and i told you folks they're going to take your pensions but they will prop up the
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:09.000]  too big to fail the plan is to bankrupt you and they want to have a civil war and i laugh at this
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:13.400]  because all you that work for the system that think you prop it up and you get your pension
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:18.200]  whether it's a private investor in the stock market and they see that as their pension who
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:22.600]  goes along with the system oh do anything bail out foreign banks to prop up the stock market
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:27.240]  and then all you're doing is falling into the trap like dr corsey just said where they're going to
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:33.320]  implode the world economy in a new crisis attenuating this continued recession into depression
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:39.240]  but they will market with a new crisis and then demand even more power during that and the average
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:45.160]  yuppie will line up to the very people public and private investments and they will steal them
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:49.960]  part of them in the name of securing what you've got and then keep inflating the stock market
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:55.640]  with devalued world currencies mainly the dollar the stock market isn't really double what it was
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:12:05.160]  five years ago six years ago the stock market ladies and gentlemen is paid for in a giant bubble
[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:11.160]  of hyperinflated currencies but the banks and the big corporations don't ever let that money come out
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:17.880]  in pay raises so there hasn't been as bad as inflation in the general economy only in the
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:24.440]  speculative economy they try to divide them but there's no way short term they can even continue
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:29.240]  to keep them divided and they're leaching back and forth into each other you understand that we
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:34.840]  get a depression and these guys get a bunch of free money but then it devalues it so they just dump
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:40.040]  trillions more faster and faster for whatever it's been devalued they just give themselves that much
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:47.640]  more and then meanwhile it trickles down the inflation to us it's amazing trickle down inflation
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:53.080]  they that's what they've invented amazingly rigged economy with these computers folks the
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:57.560]  ultimate screw job and you just got to point out there above the law it's unconstitutional
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:04.760]  unjust weights and measures is the is is the bedrock of slavery jp morgan's exempt from laws
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:11.160]  exempt from uh selling derivative counterfeiting when it goes upside down we bail it out if i did
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:18.440]  anything like that i'd be sitting under the federal prison if you did that you'd be i mean
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:24.040]  burning made off to testify what i did is standard and it's true but he did it as his own little
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:34.360]  operation and he screwed a leech you could get 15 20 with a goldman sacks investment you get 30
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:42.200]  percent with burning made off burning made off got greedy that was his crime is he screwed over
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:48.200]  a bunch of the elitist you know wives and cousins and people and so because it was so obvious they
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:54.200]  sent him to jail that's it let's go ahead and talk to travis travis called in earlier but i
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:14:00.120]  cut him off as we went to break and the brakes are set in stone unless i skip them satellites uh
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:04.840]  and infestations out there so i wanted to come back to him he wanted to talk about how we are
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:10.600]  enrolled globally the population and is signed on the national debt through our birth certificates
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:15.240]  and social security numbers when i used to hear this 20 years ago and didn't believe it and there's
[02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:20.680]  a lot of stuff attached to it that's patriot mythology but the bedrock core that they do
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:26.840]  have us signed into the system as political fictions which they then under a corporate fraud
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:31.160]  get us to waive our rights is absolutely true so what was your point sir thanks for holding
[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:35.320]  yeah alex i just wanted to get to my point i only got a few minutes here on my track
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:41.560]  phone left so anyhow um i just wanted to i'm wondering why nobody files a uh civil lawsuit
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:47.800]  for id theft from these guys that they're heading behind titles and mobility um all the doctors the
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:53.080]  hospitals and the government are accessories to our accomplices to the crime um and the ones
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:58.840]  that are holding the documents the adverse certificates are actually the id seats i mean
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:04.120]  i it couldn't be too much to leap file the suit so we'll be against them somehow i don't know how
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:09.640]  to go about it i'm a fall man and i'd do it myself now i hear you and i appreciate your call it is
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:17.080]  a it is an interesting idea and even if you don't win the lawsuit it it would bring attention to this
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:25.720]  whole legal fiction it's a very complex issue uh let's go ahead and talk to joe in california
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:35.080]  welcome hello hey buddy oh please oh yeah oh hello alex hey uh i just wanted to first off i'd like
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:41.240]  to say i appreciate all your hard work and efforts that you and your crew uh uh go through to provide
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:46.600]  the members of prison planet tv and the rest of the world with your information thank you sir for
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:53.160]  your support yes sir uh also i'd just like to uh you know say uh you know if american military
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:58.200]  forces are fighting uh for freedom and liberating other countries around the world and if that were
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:03.960]  true why haven't we used a copy machine to print out and install the u.s constitution and bill of
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:10.920]  rights instead of installing uh brutal dictatorial regimes well no that's it because corrupt interests
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:16.120]  have seized control of our military the cia was founded out of skull and bones from the beginning
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:20.520]  to overthrow the united states and make us part of basically a british empire model not the british
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:26.680]  empire itself but that same model taking over uh the cecil roads system on record and he even
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:34.520]  mainline historians admit that and so our government works to install dictators al qaeda corrupt over
[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:39.480]  countries because that's what the corporations want and kennedy didn't want to go along with that i
[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:44.120]  don't romanticize kennedy but he was trying to reverse that at first he was all into it thinking
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:48.360]  it was good but but within a year he went man you guys are really evil i'm not going to blow
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:56.280]  up u.s military bases and kill people to start a war with the soviet union you're fired and uh so
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:17:01.240]  they killed him and it just comes down to the worst of the worst are running things i mean
[02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:07.800]  dr corsey who's worked at all different levels of you know government as a consultant it's you
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:15.560]  know says our media is a cia machine that is lying to everybody but because they are i mean this is
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:21.160]  beyond you know some right winger like dr corsey and then a left winger like sy hirsh we're not
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:27.640]  left wingers or right wingers we we're sane people that don't want to live in a dictatorship
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:32.120]  where all the prosperity goes out the window for our children and grandchildren
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:37.560]  i mean folks this country's always had corruption problems but i mean this is
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:44.360]  things are so sophisticated now that corruption can hide behind the sophistication but if you
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:50.120]  actually just pull back it's all right there do you see what i'm saying oh yes exactly can i do a
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:57.560]  little plug sure uh i just would like to say i've been a prison planet tv member since 2008
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:04.360]  i use the tangy tangerine 2.0 uh the pollen burst and the nace and iodine all wonderful products i
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:10.040]  buy stuff from you all the time keep up the great work i appreciate it and one last thing i would
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:15.560]  just like to encourage all uh people that are out there that are going to turn in their guns to do
[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:20.840]  it barrel first as soon as the animal runs out thank you very much sir god bless you brother well
[02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:25.960]  we better fight in the info war we better fight politically long before it gets to the shooting
[02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:30.680]  war but yeah we don't have any choice if they try to confiscate the guns and mass instead
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:35.480]  they're doing it real secretly creeping around confiscating gun owners guns misinterpreting
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:42.920]  laws that take them uh not reissuing void cards uh in places like illinois i mean there is a quiet
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:49.800]  war against gun owners and a very hot war in the info war in the media brainwashing the public as
[02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:59.320]  the attorney general said and demonizing civilian ownership of firearms as this colonel came out
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:06.360]  and said in esquire magazine showed that they can try to you know basically have a monopoly of force
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:12.840]  for the government and that is just so incredibly despicable and by the way paul watson has now
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:18.120]  updated his article a little from last week that went so viral where there are two colonel robert
[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:23.880]  bateman's who both do similar work and contracting and some of the sites we went off of that's got
[02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:28.040]  some of their identity scrambled so there was some confusion need to go to info wars dot com
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:34.440]  or to the bottom of the esquire article about gun confiscation to contact the real uh colonel bowman
[02:19:34.440 --> 02:19:41.800]  who's in england and one of my bateman a colonel robert bateman so again when you guys reprint
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:46.280]  me the updated article so i have that because i want to update that proper correction here with
[02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:51.080]  colonel robert bateman uh and i just get that clear for folks all right more of your phone
[02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:57.240]  calls straight ahead truth raider michael mark mike and others your calls are coming up 800
[02:19:57.240 --> 02:20:06.360]  2599231 in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the
[02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:13.080]  halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the halogen
[02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:19.240]  family fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right
[02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:26.040]  thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and
[02:20:26.040 --> 02:20:32.920]  the results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously

[02:26:54.120 --> 02:27:01.320]  some of these little some of these little jewels okay let's look at this one number 17 you cannot
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:06.760]  use the u.s constitution to defend yourself because you are not a party to it the references
[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:13.160]  paddleford fey and company versus the mayor and elderman of the city of savannah georgia
[02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:16.920]  no no i agree in fact i've never seen this video before but we should this is the kind of stuff
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:21.880]  we should take and then of course give a hat tip to for the research and then add actual you know
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:27.080]  documents to it they have some of that up there but actually add images to it because what i saw
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:33.000]  so far was true let's go back to number one here let's go back to number one the irs is not a u.s
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:40.280]  government agency it is an agency the imf it goes on diversified metal products versus irs
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:45.720]  and it's got the whole law yeah this is powerful this is powerful stuff yep black's law dictionary

[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:57.320]  all of them it was originally a 48 item list and they narrowed it down to 30 so i looked this up
[02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:03.560]  and you know it goes in conjunction with you know researchers like the legendary jordan maxwell
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:10.600]  for example he explains it in an esoteric fashion yeah by the way jordan says he'll come on but i've
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:15.560]  got a calling and i literally have been so busy finishing the new studio and the new tv launch
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:19.560]  next week and everything else that i got to call jordan today in fact i'm just at the end of the
[02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:25.560]  show i got to call this kernel both the kernels the one that we confuse and then the real one
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:30.920]  then i got to call a media company that keeps calling me and then i've got to call jordan maxwell
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:35.880]  so that i can get him to come on the show uh but i do want to get jordan on very interesting anything
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:43.160]  else well yeah for just for laughs for just what it's worth on youtube they also have this a guy

[02:38:55.320 --> 02:39:07.560]  proprietary nation iodine the reason i did this was because of the fact that i was researching
[02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:13.320]  what to protect my thyroid my family's thyroid with and the top guys i talked to you said the
[02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:17.320]  regular iodine most of it's not really nascent and it makes you sick and it eats holes in lining
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:20.840]  your stomach and you know there's some other good brands of it out there but this is the brand you
[02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:25.480]  should go with it nobody even they weren't even selling any of it so i got the exclusive on it we
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:30.120]  have it it's available at info wars life.com it is the survival shield we now have the fluoride
[02:39:30.120 --> 02:39:34.040]  shield that also has the nascent iodine in it but five other key compounds that work together
[02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:39.560]  and the supermail vitality but look at this headline record outdoor radiation level that can kill
[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:45.560]  in 20 minutes detected at Fukushima RT this is the news of Australia three years on from
[02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:53.640]  japan's nuclear emergency the fallout continues to spread fox news reports record huge wave of junk
[02:39:53.640 --> 02:40:02.600]  and garbage almost three years to get here will hit sometime in uh see january february or march so
[02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:08.840]  and it's certainly not a silver bullet moving to southern hemisphere where the radiation levels
[02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:14.680]  are really more than two times lower uh would be the ticket but uh this is the bare minimum
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:20.840]  and it supports us as well in force life.com ladies and gentlemen all right folks let's go
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:25.880]  back to your phone calls as quickly as possible michael in michigan and then mark and then mic
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:30.840]  and then martin and then that'll be it with martin in ireland because i've got to get to the southern
[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:36.200]  news uh michael thanks for holding brother you're on the air hey elix how are you doing all right
[02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:41.720]  brother all right man i'm calling in because i'm i'm pretty concerned i'm a 20 year old college
[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:48.840]  student and uh what you were saying earlier about the uh state-run media it's pretty much at this age
[02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:55.000]  that you can see the effects of what this has done to people and how this has gotten into their mind
[02:40:56.200 --> 02:41:01.000]  and just walking around campus here you can see everybody's just so um
[02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:09.160]  everybody's the same i mean guys all wear pastels they've basically been mentally neutered
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:17.400]  the girls all wear the same clothes uh iphone uh yoga pants and and their auger boots and it's just
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:23.960]  kind of sad to see that that these people have figured out how to get into our mind and there's
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:30.840]  really like a fight for our souls going on well i need to have you host the show because you just
[02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:36.040]  said it all succinctly when you look at how people were in the past and all the scientific numbers
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:43.000]  show this it's not just observation the brain waves are lower the iq is physically lower uh people
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:49.240]  think it's cool to shuffle around and not care and just be totally decadent lambs to the slaughter
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:57.240]  and then make fun of those of us that are trying to fix things and they think it's their individualism
[02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:03.240]  to be slaves because the system has created a decadent artificial system to take over but as
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:09.400]  soon as they're done taking over all these snot noses are going to be singing to a different tune
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:14.760]  and i know what you're talking about i mean we call them trendies here and
[02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:26.040]  they are really really entitled stupid vapid shallow uh and and every generation says this
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:32.520]  but i mean i like every generation's music i can hear old country folk songs replayed and
[02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:40.520]  love them i can listen to uh classical music and love it i can listen to old song music you know
[02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:45.800]  they found from chinese music a thousand years old and love it i can hear arabic music that's
[02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:50.280]  thousands of years old and love it i can hear jewish music that's thousands of years old and
[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:56.280]  love it i can hear basically anything and love it and i listen to the new stuff it's mindless the
[02:42:56.280 --> 02:43:06.520]  same beat is because it's what a cockroach would listen to and there's some good new music as well
[02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:12.120]  but if that's just a many a philosopher said you will know a culture by its music and and and the
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:18.840]  vapid emptiness of it and the one dimension on this of it and you know i shouldn't have done it
[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:23.000]  but i wanted to play old video games because my kids love them and they want me to buy one of those
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:28.280]  expensive big tabletop consoles for the garage that we're turning into a you know fun studio or
[02:43:28.280 --> 02:43:33.000]  whatever's never used the garage anyways why not put pool tables and stuff out there and make a
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:38.280]  long story short uh the other night i was going to pick up food at a restaurant for my parents and
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:43.560]  right across the street well in the same shopping center i was bringing food to my parents and my
[02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:46.920]  kids that were staying over there we were over there watching movies with them having a christmas
[02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:51.000]  thing and i saw this video game plays that has used video games and i said i bet they've got
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:59.160]  plug-and-play and i walked in there know these trendies in there and uh it was the one boss in
[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:03.240]  there kind of lording over the two people under him who were groveling to him uh it was like
[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:08.040]  their little monkey sitting in his lap or something picking bugs off of him and i was like yeah i want
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:12.040]  just some plug-and-play and he goes i go yeah i just want old-fashioned to be as well it's not cool
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:16.520]  like the new stuff and i went well man that's too real for me that engrosses you when i have a little
[02:44:16.520 --> 02:44:22.760]  bit of fun let them play some retro games like centipede or whatever or or you know a tarry chess
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:30.680]  and the guy just was like oh really oh yeah oh i know so much about games and you don't and
[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:34.760]  oh that's stupid and that's why i didn't look that good and i went up and bought one of the
[02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:41.480]  ten dollar you know used plug-and-play games had like 10 games on it and i was just like man it's
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:45.640]  also that trendies and i don't just mean they dress trendy because there's different types of
[02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:50.760]  trendies there's folks that wear trendy outfits just because they're into style or whatever but
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:59.800]  they always mess with you and are also threatened almost at an instinctive level by anyone who they
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:06.520]  can tell isn't on their mindless wavelength so they're also real animalistic and and real aggressive
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:13.160]  and mean and and i think that's what's so disgusting about them because they really know their losers
[02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:18.520]  and are headed over the edge i mean is that what you're trying to get at uh almost i think that
[02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:23.560]  rather than trying to make them aggressive the point is like you said to make the dot file
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:30.600]  and they will rebel against anybody who threatens you know their ego who says that what you're doing
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:37.560]  isn't how you should be acting i mean this is it's lunacy and they don't know they have cognitive
[02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:44.920]  dissidents to defend their enslavement and they'll tell you they're free and they buy into whatever
[02:45:44.920 --> 02:45:51.480]  the delusional template is they're on a power trip they think they're a superstar go ahead it's narcissism
[02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:57.080]  the sad thing is you once gave an analogy about the frog in the boiling pot
[02:45:58.040 --> 02:46:03.640]  and i've gotten even better one uh one of my karate senseis told me this that in Antarctica they
[02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:09.800]  would hunt wolves by dipping a knife in blade and then stick it or sorry dipping the blade in blood
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:14.040]  and then sticking that in the ground and a wolf will come by and he'll start looking that blood
[02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:19.160]  off the blade cuts his tongue keeps licking it doesn't know the difference and it's this slow
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:25.560]  just like mental rape that they've done to people that is what's killing us because
[02:46:26.280 --> 02:46:30.680]  by the time you're 20 you don't your psyche is already so screwed up that you don't know
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:39.080]  what's going on exactly and then you defend your scarred brain as your identity you adapt to the
[02:46:39.080 --> 02:46:44.520]  enslavement and then attack those and that's what an elitist told me off record told the story a
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:50.360]  hundred times this this major bank head he said you don't understand people just don't adapt like
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:56.680]  in the marines adapt improvise overcome they don't just adapt in good ways if we do it right
[02:46:56.680 --> 02:47:02.120]  they'll adapt to whatever we want and humanity will adapt into whatever we want and he literally
[02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:09.080]  smiled at me like the devil filled with knowledge he knew more than i did was probably smarter than
[02:47:09.080 --> 02:47:16.120]  i was but had an evil soul and had made a decision and i know it's easy to disdain the public to see
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:23.240]  him as dumb to not want to build him up not want to believe in him but i just i just can't do it
[02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:28.840]  god bless you all final comment go ahead yeah um you know a lot of the stuff you say some people
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:34.680]  may find far-fetched and i found myself thinking that way until i want to i saw one of those beautiful
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:40.040]  m-raps vehicles driving down catholic and i was just like holy crap this is real oh yeah so they
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:48.520]  got the sound cannon waiting for you well let's hope not that's what they're rolling out nationwide
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:51.960]  thank you so much in fact here's two of the articles and i'll go back to your calls and more
[02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:57.480]  here's la times detroit ruling opens door to pension cuts across the nation that's la times told you
[02:47:57.480 --> 02:48:03.000]  that was coming over and over again they actually changed the rules in 2005 to take public and
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:06.840]  private pensions you didn't know that you might want to check into it i have your new listener
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:10.520]  here's no one budget negotiations looking at military pensions politico
[02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:19.800]  and of course the truth is folks if they got rid of the derivatives and the federal reserve
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:24.200]  and signing on all the empire you could actually keep your bloated pensions a lot of the pensions
[02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:30.920]  are too big and it makes dependency but if you're going to give 40 something trillion to foreign
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:34.760]  banks that they put in the black hole you can pay the military pensions but the military pensions
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:39.560]  i've looked at them are nothing compared to a lot of these city managers i mean i've seen city
[02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:45.240]  managers in small towns in california that make 800 000 a year because they're the manager
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:50.520]  that folks that's 800 000 a year
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:58.200]  in one town they have like 40 000 people in the town and they're paid that because they're
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:03.640]  swindlers you see they take 70 plus percent of the money and invest it in stocks and bonds
[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:08.280]  that don't even go into the budget and it's literally stolen that's why a city manager
[02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:12.760]  and i've had city managers in studio before on separate issues they bring this up and they turn
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:18.200]  red and laugh and go i'm not talking about it because it's all a big criminal conspiracy
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:23.000]  just like the nsa just like the police with warrantless checkpoints they're all just doing it
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:28.920]  that's what tyranny is is a revolution of crime of officially sponsored crime let's go to mark in
[02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:33.720]  origan you want to talk about john b wells and the missing nukes saturday interview he did go ahead
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:41.880]  yeah good afternoon alex go about uh till weekend before last on the uh coast to coast
[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:47.720]  showing john b wells interviewed a very interesting gentleman named dr james garyl have you heard of
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:54.200]  him yes he garyl's been on i respect him and i do believe he was a ci operative like he says
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:50:01.480]  it's just that i can't confirm all the stuff he's saying i know some of it's true and so uh i'm
[02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:08.760]  glad wells had him on uh it's just that i have not interviewed garyl uh on his missing nukes story
[02:50:08.760 --> 02:50:16.680]  uh because uh you know i know our story is accurate i know our story is real uh i know we had this
[02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:21.720]  high level source with the big freak out at dais air force base and they didn't know where they
[02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:25.960]  were going or they knew generally where they were going but they didn't know what was going on just
[02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:29.400]  that it was wrong and that they weren't supposed to be there the nukes weren't supposed to even be
[02:50:29.400 --> 02:50:34.520]  there and then we never knew and that's how a story is where you don't know all the details
[02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:38.840]  and it was i went out on the limb to even report that and then garyl i didn't hear the interview
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:42.840]  but i heard he would tell us what he talked about when we come back people should go to

[02:56:51.880 --> 02:56:56.280]  in the details of what you first reported back in earlier october no i know and i don't doubt
[02:56:56.280 --> 02:57:01.960]  garo want to be clear just i know my sources so i will go with it i don't know his sources so i won't

[02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:13.000]  points best i can for you uh the actual reason for the uh general's removal uh carrying garden
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:21.000]  jardino who were in charge of the nuclear uh program in this country uh that was actually uh
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:26.280]  due to the fact that they refused to follow orders issued from the white house i want to
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:31.000]  really stress that from the white house is obama has the launch goes he's the only one
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:37.400]  that could have ordered those missiles moved uh to launch over america in order to destroy the
[02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:43.880]  country's electrical grid a nuclear emp weapon now there were three nuclear devices taken from
[02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:50.920]  dais air force base in texas according to um uh dr garo uh when the three nuclear warheads were
[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:56.920]  ordered by obama to be transported from washball storage at dais uh the order specified that one
[02:57:56.920 --> 02:58:03.160]  bomb was to be outfitted with an emp collar the collars actually join and hold the missile and
[02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:09.880]  warheads together the collars are uh uh tailored for an intended emp effect listen i know about
[02:58:09.880 --> 02:58:15.160]  that but i mean here's my issue and i'm not doubting his he thinks this or whatever my issue is if
[02:58:15.160 --> 02:58:19.560]  they were going to do that they would do something like have a private drone carry it and detonate it
[02:58:19.560 --> 02:58:25.880]  i don't think they'd order top military officers to attack the u.s with an emp they'd use a cover
[02:58:25.880 --> 02:58:31.480]  of a drill or something and then insert a real one in it or something and say al qaeda did it
[02:58:31.480 --> 02:58:36.280]  but i'm not i'll probably have to get garo on okay but this is this is out now and you know
[02:58:36.280 --> 02:58:40.280]  what let's just get him on tomorrow let's just hear what he has to say i'm coming back in overdrive

[03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:52.760]  alex i just want to ask you about who these people are these globalists did you talk about
[03:00:54.440 --> 03:01:00.680]  well they they follow a mindset of technocracy and enslaving humanity and using systems of deceit
[03:01:00.680 --> 03:01:08.280]  and control uh and so and so and so they basically inhabit every race color creed religion
[03:01:08.280 --> 03:01:14.600]  organization they are followers of evil and and and how long have they been around
[03:01:15.640 --> 03:01:23.800]  since the beginning of time there have been people that have an evil streak right so with
[03:01:23.800 --> 03:01:34.600]  that in mind right yes sir these cm people are the cm people that called washington a terrorist
[03:01:34.600 --> 03:01:42.040]  yes right yes they called washington a terrorist
[03:01:43.400 --> 03:01:49.080]  and these are the same people that have labeled nelson mandala a terrorist
[03:01:50.600 --> 03:02:00.120]  and do you do you not see that that um anybody that opposes oppression is a terrorist well i mean
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:06.440]  i've already said that nelson mandala had a lot of courage uh and uh but he did target civilians
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:13.080]  and george washington didn't do that and so that's the difference but i hear you and and at the same
[03:02:13.080 --> 03:02:20.280]  time i just don't agree with what mandala wanted to replace one evil with another uh just because
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:25.240]  i don't like what he tried to replace things with doesn't mean i endorse what he was fighting against
[03:02:25.240 --> 03:02:30.200]  you know it's kind of like there's two restaurants and i go i don't want to go in that one or that
[03:02:30.200 --> 03:02:36.120]  one it's like i don't you see what i'm saying yeah but but do you not see the big picture here
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:41.320]  the big picture here is that these people that you talk about right have been controlling
[03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:48.280]  people's minds forever and a day right it goes back to the the native indians when that when they
[03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:54.520]  washington himself now washington himself gives the order to eradicate the indians right so there
[03:02:54.520 --> 03:02:59.560]  you go is reassism right yeah but i mean it's a little bit more than that i mean i mean i mean by
[03:02:59.560 --> 03:03:04.680]  the 1860s it was eradicate the natives and the and the british did also try to give them smallpox
[03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:09.880]  and stuff before that in 1700s but if you want to be technical a lot of the indian wars were lost
[03:03:09.880 --> 03:03:15.000]  early on in the east and then in the in the midwest that's why the eradication program came in
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  because it wasn't like in the movies where it's a native woman and the and the degenerate redneck
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:25.400]  you know shoots her for no reason and i'm not endorsing what happened either it was both sides
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:31.400]  were killing each other and if you wouldn't join a group of of natives to go on the war path against
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:37.400]  their enemy they would kill you do you understand that yeah but do you understand that back then it
[03:03:37.400 --> 03:03:45.320]  was reassism them in the 60s or earlier in the united states it was communism and now it's terrorism
[03:03:45.320 --> 03:03:51.800]  all these and all these wards and all these um things have all been used to scarf longer people
[03:03:52.760 --> 03:03:57.720]  man i gotta tell you i gotta tell you communists have killed more people than anybody else i mean
[03:03:57.720 --> 03:04:03.640]  mal the chinese government says killed 84 million the cia says 66 or something i mean i mean
[03:04:03.640 --> 03:04:09.080]  communism is just the most horrible slavery in the world uh and i'm not saying that they didn't
[03:04:09.080 --> 03:04:14.280]  use the fighting against communism to take liberties as well i'm not disagreeing with you i
[03:04:14.280 --> 03:04:21.160]  mean really i i mean what do we do we got about 20 seconds left i know what a price is about right
[03:04:21.160 --> 03:04:26.120]  and see these same people that you're talking about are the same people that oppressed us in ireland
[03:04:26.120 --> 03:04:31.400]  these same people that told lies about what it really was was going on in ireland these same people
[03:04:31.400 --> 03:04:34.840]  concocted a story that there was yeah well let's get this straight i think there shouldn't be a
[03:04:34.840 --> 03:04:39.160]  northern ireland i think it should all be under irish control and you shouldn't be in the e you
[03:04:39.160 --> 03:04:43.320]  but just because i tell the ukrainians don't be in the e you i don't think ukrain should be part of
[03:04:43.320 --> 03:04:49.560]  russia about ukraine for the ukrainians ireland for the irish mexico for the mexicans i mean
[03:04:49.560 --> 03:04:55.160]  that's what i'm talking about here the country's for the people not for foreign corporate colonizers
[03:04:55.160 --> 03:05:13.080]  shall i agree with you the new world orders actually is neocolonialism
