[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:29.000 --> 00:42.000]  The Clinton crime family machine's house of horrors echoed with streaks of dread over the Halloween weekend.
[00:42.000 --> 00:49.000]  The Hill reported former assistant FBI director James Calstrom unloaded during a radio interview saying,
[00:49.000 --> 00:56.000]  The Clintons. That's a crime family, basically. It's like organized crime. I mean, the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  This investigation was never a real investigation. Calstrom continued. They never had a grand jury impaneled.
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.000]  And the reason they never had a grand jury impaneled, I'm sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.
[01:09.000 --> 01:15.000]  Meanwhile, Loretta Lynch was fighting to save her own hijacked position of the Department of Justice,
[01:15.000 --> 01:24.000]  pleading the Fifth to Congress on secret Iran payments, during which FBI director James Comey's unprecedented admission of Clinton guilt
[01:24.000 --> 01:32.000]  11 days before Election Day signaled that mutiny is swelling in the offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[01:32.000 --> 01:40.000]  Zero Hedge reported, in an attempt to justify his actions, a leaked memo emerged on Friday evening, courtesy of Fox News,
[01:40.000 --> 01:50.000]  which explains why Comey took the unusual step of deciding to inform Congress that the FBI had reopened its investigation into Clinton's private e-mail server.
[01:50.000 --> 02:02.000]  The memo reveals two main arguments, a sense of obligation to lawmakers and a concern that word of the new e-mail discovery would leak to the media and raise questions of a cover-up.
[02:02.000 --> 02:10.000]  I'm sure that some of you may have heard about a letter that the FBI director sent out yesterday.
[02:10.000 --> 02:18.000]  It's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election.
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  Donald Trump is already making up lies about this.
[02:22.000 --> 02:32.000]  I think it's time for Donald Trump to stop fear-mongering, to stop disgracing himself, to stop attacking our democracy.
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  We can't let him get away with this, can we?
[02:35.000 --> 02:56.000]  The Democratic Party has now transcended damage control and entered panic mode, as Hillary Clinton's right-hand woman, Huma Abidine, Muslim Brotherhood Plant Numero Uno, is no longer on the campaign trail after it was discovered that she did not turn over all the evidence pertaining to the FBI's e-mail investigation of Clinton.
[02:56.000 --> 03:08.000]  Plenty of evidence still resided on the computer Huma shared with estranged husband Anthony Wiener, aka Carlos Danger, after being investigated for sexting with a 15-year-old girl.
[03:08.000 --> 03:20.000]  Currently, it is surfacing that Anthony Wiener is selling out the Clintons to save his own skin, essentially voiding Huma's immunity deal, forcing Abidine to either face jail time or sing like a canary.
[03:20.000 --> 03:45.000]  It is unthinkable that the director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States, saying that there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of the Congress, unless it was something requiring serious investigation.
[03:45.000 --> 04:05.000]  Now the stench of boiling corruption has landed squarely on President Obama's desk. The New York Post reveals that back in 2008, President Obama's transition team improperly emailed sensitive and confidential information about a candidate for a high-level government job according to newly disclosed WikiLeaks e-mails.
[04:05.000 --> 04:15.000]  That, on top of the Podesta WikiLeaks, supporting Obama's knowledge and use of Clinton's e-mail server and the Clinton team's attempts to clean it up.
[04:15.000 --> 04:28.000]  Eventually, the e-mails will reveal Clinton Foundation racketeering that will bring down all of those on the take in Washington, D.C. Hillary's bogus poll tampered 12-point lead is gone.
[04:28.000 --> 04:50.000]  Unfortunately, all that means is that it's quite possible that American lives could be in more danger. Things are getting so dire for the globalists, who still remain under the false impression that they are invisible, that you can hear the clock ticking on a major false flag operation to steer the rubber-necking of the Clinton dumpster fire towards something far more sinister.
[04:59.000 --> 05:10.000]  Looks good that families are brought together by something, right? Well, a former assistant FBI director says that the Clintons are brought together by crime. They're a crime family. It's like organized crime.
[05:10.000 --> 05:25.000]  I mean, the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool. This article is up on our website. It's written by Steve Watson, and it highlights how the former assistant FBI director slams Hillary Clinton and her foundation, calling it a cesspool, and that the family is like an organized crime syndicate.
[05:25.000 --> 05:37.000]  Now, appearing on a radio show this week, the FBI, it's known, is reopening the case of Hillary Clinton and her homebrew server. James Calstrom made these remarks while praising Donald Trump as a good human being and a patriot.
[05:37.000 --> 05:47.000]  He goes on to say, the Clintons, that's a crime family, basically, and he's a 27-year-old FBI veteran. He says it's like organized crime. I mean, the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.
[05:47.000 --> 05:59.000]  God forbid we put someone like that in the White House. Of course, he's referring to Hillary Clinton. Yes, God forbid. May I remind you, November 8th is Take Out the Trash Day. I'm Margaret Howe, reporting for infowars.com.
[06:18.000 --> 06:30.000]  It's a company I trust. They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs that could help safeguard your money in an economic meltdown. I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[06:30.000 --> 06:41.000]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move. Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting finances.
[06:41.000 --> 06:53.000]  Don't delay. Call 844-541-ALEX-NOW and get a rugged, double-locked bank bag to securely store your coins. Absolutely free. These are dangerous times, and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[06:53.000 --> 07:11.000]  I personally own these survival packs, and you should too. Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALEX-NOW.
[07:24.000 --> 07:32.000]  And best of all, it's free to download at infowars.com. The app is brand new. This is the first release, and it was completely built from the ground up.
[07:32.000 --> 07:45.000]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you. In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[07:45.000 --> 07:58.000]  But Infowars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence. So download Infowars Live today at infowars.com and learn what's really going on instead of being spoon-fed lies by the mainstream media.
[08:15.000 --> 08:22.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[08:22.000 --> 08:28.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[08:28.000 --> 08:41.000]  It's hard to believe we are now just T-minus seven days, one week, from the deciding election, Americanism versus Globalism.
[08:41.000 --> 09:01.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I really want to endeavor in between guests today that are joining us to open the phones up with your specifics of whether or not you've been able to vote and not had your vote flipped from straight ticket to straight Democratic ticket,
[09:01.000 --> 09:19.000]  or from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton, because those reports are coming in to mainstream news, CBS, ABC, they're being forced to report it, from Maryland to Colorado, from Texas to Florida, it's happening all over the country.
[09:19.000 --> 09:31.000]  And front and center is the fact that we have in the WikiLeaks, Donna Brazil caught a second time giving questions to Hillary before the event happened.
[09:31.000 --> 09:39.000]  We've even got the video of one of the Democratic debates where the very question then got posed and she has the nerve to continue to lie.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  This is just indicative of how it's all staged.
[09:41.000 --> 09:57.000]  We have them in the WikiLeaks just a week and a half ago admitting that their over polling was their plan a year and a half ago to make Hillary look invincible and to have the news media they control, literally control.
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  Think about that.
[10:01.000 --> 10:13.000]  Sit there and add 7 to 20 to 30 to 40 points and it is simply unbelievable. When I tell people on the street, they say, hey, do you think Trump's going to win? I notice he's ahead of Hillary and a couple of polls now or neck and neck weather.
[10:13.000 --> 10:28.000]  And I said, you understand that those very polls, if you read the methodology or adding 9, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 45 depending on the poll, some ABC and CNN polls add upwards of 50%.
[10:28.000 --> 10:42.000]  This is on record. Of course, she's winning those by 65, 68, 70%. You had 40 to 30. You're up there at 70.
[10:42.000 --> 10:54.000]  I mean, think about that. You're up there at 80. This lady, this lady's maybe 30, 40 points, maybe 35 if she's lucky. There is absolute disgust for her across the board.
[10:54.000 --> 11:04.000]  We've got a loaded roster today. Bev Harris joins us in the second hour. She is the nonpartisan. She's a Democrat, but she's nonpartisan in her investigations.
[11:04.000 --> 11:17.000]  Top expert, undoubtedly in the modern era on election fraud, but also on voter fraud. But she'll tell you election fraud is really 9-10s of it generally.
[11:17.000 --> 11:26.000]  She's got huge new information out today. We're going to be premiering here in the second hour. Roger Stone is going to be popping in each day until the election and right through the election.
[11:26.000 --> 11:34.000]  Blue Rockwell is going to be joining us as well as David Knight hosting the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[11:34.000 --> 11:42.000]  But I specifically want to hear from you. Just boom. Did you have trouble? Where was it? What happened?
[11:42.000 --> 11:50.000]  Send us screenshots, send us photos, send us video when you're in the voting booth. Vote at infowars.com is the place.
[11:50.000 --> 11:57.000]  And we're getting all these videos coming in of not being able to vote Republican, of having your votes flipped if you vote straight ticket.
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.000]  This morning I went in to see my allergy doctor.
[12:02.000 --> 12:13.000]  And the nurse began to tell me, who's a very nice lady I've known for about three years, that basically a large percentage of her patients are coming in there saying their votes are being flipped.
[12:13.000 --> 12:22.000]  And she was even kind enough to start reaching out to some of them and we're going to work on having some of those folks on that it's happened to.
[12:22.000 --> 12:32.000]  A couple of them prominent people. I mean this looks like this is epidemic. What do they do if Trump's really 15, 20, 30 points ahead depending on the state?
[12:32.000 --> 12:38.000]  In a state like Texas, probably 25 points ahead. State like Florida, 15, 20 points ahead, a lot of polls show.
[12:38.000 --> 12:47.000]  If you take out the over sampling, he's clearly 20 points ahead in Florida. You take out the over sampling in Ohio, he's 10 points ahead.
[12:47.000 --> 12:58.000]  Now you add 9, 10, 15 points, he's neck and neck. This is how they're doing it. Look, I know you know that, but the public is still not fully aware of this.
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.000]  Now I did notice this weekend we posted an article dealing with the fact that in a whole bunch of big polls, so-called scientific polls,
[13:05.000 --> 13:15.000]  Donald Trump was now neck and neck with Hillary and the commenters were flipping out saying, Alex Jones, you need to point out that these are over sampled polls
[13:15.000 --> 13:21.000]  and this is creating the perception that he's not really ahead. How dare you do this?
[13:21.000 --> 13:28.000]  I don't ride herd over my riders and the folks that post articles, they do a great job.
[13:28.000 --> 13:38.000]  We are undoubtedly more than anybody out there, the main people exposing the fact, along with Drudge and a few others, that over sampling is the key to the whole scam.
[13:38.000 --> 13:47.000]  We've published the WikiLeak, we've covered it, obviously we're going to put snippets of mainstream news up, it's up to you to know the disinfo.
[13:47.000 --> 13:56.000]  And their argument is, well, other people that come on the site won't know that and will be deceived.
[13:56.000 --> 14:06.000]  That's what we're doing here is trying to expose the mainstream media, but if I try to decipher every lie they tell, it would be impossible.
[14:06.000 --> 14:13.000]  It just cannot be done, but it's kind of like comments I see like, you need to expose the Federal Reserve being private, never talk about that.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  You need to expose 9-11 and the shadowy forces involved. All we've done is put that on the map.
[14:18.000 --> 14:26.000]  But I digress, I get people's frustration because we're dealing with a wall of corruption, a wall of lies.
[14:26.000 --> 14:37.000]  And when Roger Stone joins us coming up at the bottom of this hour, I'm going to ask him front and center, not just about strategy to win or not just what he expects to happen on Election Day.
[14:37.000 --> 14:54.000]  I want to get into the next shoe to drop because they claim they have scores of hours of this biographer, of Trump, and that they've sent nine interesting hours over to the news media in the last few months.
[14:54.000 --> 15:00.000]  And that they're waiting to release something they claim is critical of black people.
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  Now, we have Hillary Sheff saying, she said the N-word and hates minorities, everybody else.
[15:05.000 --> 15:13.000]  We have all these other witnesses to it as well. We know their history in the Dixie Mafia and connections to the KKK and Robert Byrd.
[15:13.000 --> 15:26.000]  We know the whole background of doubling black unemployment and running all these scams and the Clintons helping get payday loans into place to hurt poor people across the board.
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.000]  But clearly the last tape on Trump was edited, but he never made that point.
[15:31.000 --> 15:40.000]  You can hear the jump cuts in the audio to make it sound like something that it wasn't, to make it sound a lot worse.
[15:40.000 --> 15:56.000]  Now, who knows if they really have this tape? I think they would have released this tape by now with seven days out if, if they really had it or if it wasn't weak.
[15:56.000 --> 16:02.000]  They probably got something. They probably edited something together.
[16:02.000 --> 16:14.000]  But we have the WikiLeaks calling back black people dumb, Clinton, calling Bernie Sanders supporters, basement dwellers and baristas.
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  By the way, nothing wrong with being a barista. That's one of the best paid jobs and service you can get.
[16:19.000 --> 16:26.000]  I know bartenders make an honor grand a year, but whatever, you're sitting here looking at this.
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  We're down to the final stretch. What do you think the dirty tricks may be?
[16:30.000 --> 16:36.000]  And clearly, if they released some tape on election day or the day before, it's not meant to change the election.
[16:36.000 --> 16:44.000]  It's meant to put the whole thing into question because they know Hillary's losing and the false flag, the triggering event will be the civil unrest.
[16:44.000 --> 16:54.000]  They've primed and prepared in the last eight years funding all these different racist and radical groups that are George Soros controlled.
[16:54.000 --> 17:04.000]  So bottom line, we are in an incredibly critical time right now, a time for gut checks, a time for focus and a time to understand.
[17:04.000 --> 17:14.000]  Hillary is a literal crime boss. As the former deputy director of the FBI has come out and said, she represents an international mafia combine.
[17:14.000 --> 17:25.000]  And a vote for her is a vote for a methodology and political system that operates out of making people poor and controlled by a central government that's above the law.
[17:25.000 --> 17:29.000]  So quite frankly, I'm not a lesser of two evils person.
[17:29.000 --> 17:44.000]  But it could come out with Donald Trump saying racist things and I would repudiate it, but I would move on and I'd say Hillary is the racist in her real action and in who she hires and what she does and what she stood for.
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  She's anti human period.
[17:46.000 --> 18:01.000]  It's gotten to the point where she is so evil and such next level bad that they could pull out, you know, some woman that claims Trump raped her or who knows what they'll make up or half bake or twist.
[18:01.000 --> 18:12.000]  I'm going with Donald Trump because I know this is a referendum against world government, a referendum against tyranny, a referendum against crony capitalism and gangsterism.
[18:12.000 --> 18:19.000]  And here's the bottom line. Trump has done things that are irrevocably damaging to the global power structure.
[18:19.000 --> 18:26.000]  He has savaged them with incredible stamina, with incredible courage, with incredible truth.
[18:26.000 --> 18:44.000]  He has absolutely paved the way for the Americana system that was the greatest system the world has ever seen that will guaranteed make anybody who wants to work even the wealthiest poor people compared to other parts of the world.
[18:44.000 --> 18:56.000]  And our middle class, the biggest the world has ever seen. It's a guarantee that we've been sold out by globalism. It's a guarantee we've been economically captured. It's a guarantee.
[18:56.000 --> 19:01.000]  Now they want to finish the job, dumb us down, make us poor, break up our families.
[19:01.000 --> 19:13.000]  UT has a 29 point program. You have to go through to wear a Halloween costume and they're saying the police nationwide are going to be called to arrest you if someone thinks your costume is hurtful.
[19:13.000 --> 19:23.000]  This is an attempt at authoritarianism. It has to be repudiated and America has to come together and understand that this is make it or break it time.
[19:23.000 --> 19:31.000]  There it is. Check out the University of Texas insane 27 point checklist on Halloween costumes.
[19:31.000 --> 19:38.000]  This is the culture of control. This is treating people like their children and bullying them into submission.
[19:38.000 --> 19:49.000]  This is the control freak religion of fascist liberalism bullying us into submission. They know their bullies. They know their scum. They're horrible.
[19:49.000 --> 20:00.000]  Forget saying they're racist. They're anti humans who admit they want to be rich. They want to make us poor. They hate seeing success that isn't theirs. They're the ultimate scumbags.
[20:00.000 --> 20:11.000]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water. If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[20:11.000 --> 20:19.000]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel. The Minuteman stove is easy to use.

[24:15.400 --> 24:19.960]  Now coming up we're gonna cover a smorgasbord of important intel with
[24:19.960 --> 24:24.760]  Roger Stone as I run a lot of this pasting. But Matt was making the point
[24:24.760 --> 24:31.800]  this morning and it's a great one. One of the producers that Uma Abedin
[24:31.920 --> 24:37.840]  reportedly with this laptop with 650,000 emails that sounds like you're
[24:37.840 --> 24:42.440]  trying to collect things. It doesn't sound like it it looks like it and what
[24:42.440 --> 24:46.440]  have we said the number one issue with Hillary having a private server with
[24:46.440 --> 24:51.880]  classified information? What is the number one issue in that? It's called
[24:51.880 --> 24:56.160]  espionage and then it's called blackmail by private individuals, corporate
[24:56.160 --> 25:01.840]  actors, state actors. And Uma Abedin her little confidant hooked in with the
[25:01.840 --> 25:08.000]  Muslim Brotherhood, the Saudi Arabians. Most of the big brains out there have
[25:08.000 --> 25:14.520]  always fingered her or pointed her out or called her out as a Saudi operative
[25:14.520 --> 25:20.280]  and someone who's done that is Roger Stone. So during the last break Matt was
[25:20.280 --> 25:23.280]  bringing this up to me and I said you know you're right and Stone says his
[25:23.280 --> 25:28.440]  sources point towards her being a serious operative. Her mother is the main
[25:28.440 --> 25:39.480]  author worldwide. She is the maven. She is the queen. She is the matron. She is
[25:39.480 --> 25:48.200]  the pusher. What's the term they use for that? The madam of sexual mutilation of
[25:48.200 --> 25:54.120]  women under Sharia law. I mean again imagine if Donald Trump was staying in a
[25:54.120 --> 26:02.440]  hotel room with a guy and holding the guy's hand on TV routinely and then
[26:02.440 --> 26:10.240]  the guy's mother was a best you know top researcher publishing how great it is to
[26:10.240 --> 26:14.360]  cut women's genitals off. Donald Trump wouldn't get elected for 10 seconds and
[26:14.360 --> 26:21.120]  he shouldn't. Uma Abedin's mom linked to shocking anti-woman book. Link to it.
[26:21.120 --> 26:25.920]  She's the main pusher of it. The woman's a freak. There's Hillary with the women
[26:25.920 --> 26:31.200]  all in their hijabs. All the begging liberal women wanting to worship and
[26:31.200 --> 26:34.960]  learn how to wear hijabs. Actually air UN ads in Germany going I will wear the
[26:34.960 --> 26:40.920]  hijab. I will submit. The thing is this is a culture that wants to make me
[26:40.920 --> 26:47.760]  submit and I'm not going to do it. Not to the liberal socialists, not to the
[26:47.760 --> 26:55.520]  jihadi Islamists. Nobody but God Almighty and believe me you don't represent it.
[26:55.520 --> 27:01.920]  New article info wars.com. Hackers likely stole Hillary's classified dogs in 2014.
[27:01.920 --> 27:08.560]  Yahoo breach. Over 50 million Yahoo accounts were hacked and Uma used Yahoo.
[27:08.560 --> 27:12.880]  Folks it's foreign governments it's everybody but they blame the Russians
[27:12.880 --> 27:16.520]  and we've got William Benny coming on later this week former head of the NSA
[27:16.520 --> 27:20.360]  technical division actually ran the physical war helped bring down the Soviet
[27:20.360 --> 27:26.600]  Union he's been saying I think it was probably the FBI I think it's a mole
[27:26.600 --> 27:30.440]  inside and now we know he knows it's people inside that are pissed and
[27:30.440 --> 27:34.520]  that's coming out and it was the inspector general of the intelligence
[27:34.520 --> 27:38.040]  community that called for the investigation to her server years ago
[27:38.040 --> 27:44.400]  so again that's where it's coming from not from the Russians not DC leaks not
[27:44.400 --> 27:49.120]  any of it I mean do you really think the Russians are just going to get all the
[27:49.120 --> 27:53.240]  hacks and the Russians are good at it folks you think the United States doesn't
[27:53.240 --> 27:59.720]  have the people that dwarfed that the United States built the Internet get
[27:59.720 --> 28:03.800]  that through your head the United States of the UK built it as the ultimate
[28:03.800 --> 28:11.680]  spy grid and COG system so we're gonna get into that we're gonna get into their
[28:11.680 --> 28:15.760]  dirty tricks what do we expect what's the latest intel all these incredible
[28:15.760 --> 28:19.600]  clips all these Democrats leaving the sinking ship then there's drudgereport.com
[28:19.600 --> 28:23.000]  we're gonna go through all those articles trick-or-treat FBI found the
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.680]  six hundred thousand emails on laptop DOJ blocked foundation probe yeah I love
[28:28.680 --> 28:34.360]  how we've got Harry Reid and the usual suspects running around and Hillary
[28:34.360 --> 28:39.320]  saying oh Kumi needs to step down when they were worshiping him just a month
[28:39.320 --> 28:44.080]  ago and oh my gosh what he's done is criminal on and on it's so political
[28:44.080 --> 28:48.720]  when we have the DOJ on record blocking the investigation into the
[28:48.720 --> 28:53.800]  foundation blocking the investigation into the servers clearly blocking Komi
[28:53.800 --> 28:58.000]  meeting on the airplane with Clinton being part of the same law firms as the
[28:58.000 --> 29:02.800]  Clintons all making money with each other and then we have the FBI internal
[29:02.800 --> 29:07.920]  memos where on multiple occasions the State Department staff under Hillary
[29:07.920 --> 29:12.960]  tried to bribe them with Cush jobs paying double and triple as the heads of
[29:12.960 --> 29:18.400]  embassies overseas not the ambassadors but the technical heads of embassy
[29:18.400 --> 29:23.440]  operations hey how'd you like 300 grand instead of 100 grand a year and how'd
[29:23.440 --> 29:28.920]  you like to have not do any work and be in say Berlin and they're like is that
[29:28.920 --> 29:33.680]  a bribe in fact in the memos it's just like out of the movie that's based on a
[29:33.680 --> 29:37.680]  true story Wolf of Wall Street where the other FBI agent goes say that again we
[29:37.680 --> 29:41.720]  please come over here and say that to both of us and they did they said yeah
[29:41.720 --> 29:46.440]  we'll give you jobs in front of multiple agents it's the arrogance of these
[29:46.440 --> 29:54.320]  people the arrogance we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and
[29:54.320 --> 29:58.080]  the GCN radio network
[29:59.560 --> 30:03.640]  well it's good that families are brought together by something right well a
[30:03.640 --> 30:07.800]  former assistant FBI director says that the Clintons are brought together by
[30:07.800 --> 30:11.480]  crime they're a crime family it's like organized crime I mean the
[30:11.480 --> 30:14.760]  Clinton Foundation is a cesspool this article is up in our website it's
[30:14.760 --> 30:18.320]  written by Steve Watson and it highlights how the former assistant FBI
[30:18.320 --> 30:22.920]  director slams Hillary Clinton and her foundation calling it a cesspool and
[30:22.920 --> 30:26.600]  that the family is like an organized crime syndicate now appearing on a
[30:26.600 --> 30:30.880]  radio show this week the FBI it's known is reopening the case of Hillary Clinton
[30:30.880 --> 30:35.160]  and her home Bruce server James Calstrom made these remarks while praising
[30:35.160 --> 30:39.600]  Donald Trump as a good human being at a patriot he goes on to say the Clintons
[30:39.600 --> 30:44.320]  that's a crime family basically and he's a 27-year-old FBI veteran he says it's
[30:44.320 --> 30:48.680]  like organized crime I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool God forbid we
[30:48.680 --> 30:51.800]  put someone like that in the White House of course he's referring to Hillary

[33:25.920 --> 33:30.920]  WikiLeaks are the bombshell Trump is out in speech will play clip in a few
[33:30.920 --> 33:41.400]  minutes saying there could be bombshells inside of these 650,000
[33:41.400 --> 33:45.440]  emails well absolutely there's gonna be bombshells in there and we know Yahoo
[33:45.440 --> 33:49.240]  was hacked that's probably where all this came from that's what Aberdeen was
[33:49.240 --> 33:54.640]  using is Aberdeen using this to potentially blackmail the Clintons
[33:54.640 --> 33:57.800]  that's why you'd have a treasure trove of that many emails we know she's
[33:57.800 --> 34:02.400]  connected to Saudi Arabia it's Roger Stone that has called out her profile is
[34:02.400 --> 34:06.320]  that of an intelligence asset yeah a female operative attached to a
[34:06.320 --> 34:11.280]  bisexual woman they stay in the same hotel room together her whole family
[34:11.280 --> 34:17.120]  are basically Islamic operatives I mean we are penetrated big time this is
[34:17.120 --> 34:21.400]  incredible we have again Obama and Hillary communicating illegally on a
[34:21.400 --> 34:25.840]  server they've been caught the bombshells are already there are there
[34:25.840 --> 34:29.840]  more bombshells yes but while we're looking for bombshells we have all
[34:29.840 --> 34:35.040]  these giant bombshells the Democrats calling black people dumb Sanders
[34:35.040 --> 34:43.200]  supporters dumb basement dwellers fixing poles Dona Brazil's been caught
[34:43.200 --> 34:48.720]  again with another stage question caught in lies this is credits to media
[34:48.720 --> 34:52.360]  everybody but WikiLeaks came out Assange came out with a tweet last night
[34:52.360 --> 34:59.200]  it's up on info wars.com and he said this will be the end of Hillary that the
[34:59.200 --> 35:04.760]  information coming out will be the end of Hillary unless she gives herself a
[35:04.760 --> 35:08.800]  pardon and now I see what WikiLeaks is doing when they said oh we'll be
[35:08.800 --> 35:14.400]  releasing things until the end of the year they're going to let her steal it
[35:14.400 --> 35:18.360]  maybe she's probably gonna fail but even if they do they'll have their cake and
[35:18.360 --> 35:22.840]  eat it too she's gonna get in if they steal it and then they're gonna bring
[35:22.840 --> 35:27.640]  out the even more powerful info the 33,000 and all the lies and her
[35:27.640 --> 35:31.400]  covering up we already have her but they're gonna bring it out in total
[35:31.400 --> 35:36.600]  triplicate to totally discredit the neocon liberals and all the scum that
[35:36.600 --> 35:41.160]  have hitched their wagon to her and we'll blow all them up politically media
[35:41.160 --> 35:46.360]  matters at all of them it's devastating I gotta say I got a hand to WikiLeaks
[35:46.360 --> 35:51.000]  they're smarter than I thought this is genius and Roger Stone it's now come
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.360]  out that media matters in the latest Veritas run by the White House run by
[35:54.360 --> 35:58.440]  the Clintons said we are run by the White House we're run by Hillary and we
[35:58.440 --> 36:03.000]  were ordered to take out their MVP what they called him most valuable player
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.880]  Roger Stone so I'm feeling pretty good because I'm almost attacked as much as
[36:06.880 --> 36:12.360]  he is in media matters I want to be the MVP now this is just getting crazy I mean
[36:12.360 --> 36:16.520]  this is wall-to-wall insane asylum the next seven days but you know it's gonna
[36:16.520 --> 36:20.480]  be a circus after that we're gonna Roger Stone in here in just a moment but

[38:43.080 --> 38:47.280]  know he was a customer of brain force but he's into supplements it's the best
[38:47.280 --> 38:52.200]  Paul takes a lot of new tropics because you know he's working hours a day Paul

[39:02.960 --> 39:08.360]  about to sell out we won't have it for a few weeks so take advantage of that okay
[39:08.360 --> 39:12.840]  Roger Stone joins us we have got so much to cover obviously they're they're
[39:12.840 --> 39:17.560]  floating that they've got some dirty trick this biographer is breaking his
[39:17.560 --> 39:22.320]  contract and claiming that there might be something in there disparaging
[39:22.320 --> 39:25.880]  towards black people before I ever endorsed Trump I went and talked to
[39:25.880 --> 39:28.880]  people that have known him across the board he's got an award from Jesse
[39:28.880 --> 39:31.720]  Jackson for hiring more blacks and putting them in managed positions I'm
[39:31.720 --> 39:34.120]  not gonna get into some of the inside baseball but let me tell you Donald
[39:34.120 --> 39:38.440]  Trump really likes black people okay I'm just gonna stop right there and he
[39:38.440 --> 39:44.480]  likes everybody from talking to a bunch of inside baseball folks he is a
[39:44.480 --> 39:49.040]  germaphobe and that's it they literally are floating this though because they're
[39:49.040 --> 39:54.760]  so desperate she is way behind in swing states now four points up in major
[39:54.760 --> 39:59.160]  national polls will break some of those down that's what sampling 9 to 10 to
[39:59.160 --> 40:02.520]  15 to 20 points sometimes higher against Trump now I don't want people to stay
[40:02.520 --> 40:06.000]  home thinking we've got it in the bag but the media is selling this idea that
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.080]  he's already lost despite the fact Hillary's in free fall the Democrats are
[40:10.080 --> 40:15.600]  deserting her more pundits are deserting her we've got all this amazing stuff
[40:15.600 --> 40:20.840]  unfolding right now what is the truth of that Roger Stone then we'll hit Ooma
[40:20.840 --> 40:25.640]  Aberdeen why would she have 650,000 emails you've always thought she was an
[40:25.640 --> 40:29.480]  intelligence operative well she's sleeping on the same bedroom on the road
[40:29.480 --> 40:34.080]  with Hillary what we'll also cover that and the waterfront Roger Stone thanks
[40:34.080 --> 40:38.840]  for joining us on the stone called truth.com glad to be here so let's
[40:38.840 --> 40:45.760]  tackle this whole issue of floating November surprises for Trump you know
[40:45.760 --> 40:50.640]  they have been foreshadowing this allegation that Trump has said something
[40:50.640 --> 40:54.920]  disparaging about black people for weeks it's been a common rumor in the
[40:54.920 --> 40:59.680]  political echo chamber in Washington in New York I think there is nothing to it
[40:59.680 --> 41:05.280]  he is inordinately proud of the disproportionate number of African
[41:05.280 --> 41:09.040]  Americans who were showing up at his rallies in his events these are not
[41:09.040 --> 41:15.120]  lily white events he is at the last measure getting a higher percentage of
[41:15.120 --> 41:20.800]  African-American votes that Mitt Romney or John McCain ever got and of course
[41:20.800 --> 41:24.600]  there is this video which I put up a stone cold truth of Jesse Jackson
[41:24.600 --> 41:29.640]  praising him for his standing up for the community and creating jobs and
[41:29.640 --> 41:36.920]  his contributions to a number of you know African-American nonprofits so this
[41:36.920 --> 41:40.800]  is a this is last minute desperation they're going back to the old tricks
[41:40.800 --> 41:45.120]  when are they going to accuse him of planning to cancel social security
[41:45.120 --> 41:49.040]  because that one's coming this is right out of the Clinton playbook the
[41:49.040 --> 41:55.160]  Democratic Party playbook but I think the country is in such bad shape and the
[41:55.160 --> 42:00.360]  voters have gotten so wise they're wise to the whole mainstream media
[42:00.360 --> 42:05.720]  political establishment connection the fact that one is covering for the other
[42:05.720 --> 42:10.360]  that I think we're heading for an upset twice in this race they have tried to
[42:10.360 --> 42:14.480]  write Trump off it's over folks he's defeated it's a disaster more than that
[42:14.480 --> 42:17.560]  I mean they've done it probably ten times they probably ten times but two big
[42:17.560 --> 42:21.720]  times he'll never get the nomination it's over he's resigning intervention it's
[42:21.720 --> 42:28.160]  over new candidate to be brought in meanwhile the Clintons I mean their
[42:28.160 --> 42:33.920]  their narrative is so incredibly brazen in other words it's outrageous that the
[42:33.920 --> 42:39.000]  FBI director would you know raise this question a week before the election no
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.480]  it's outrageous that an FBI official who's heading the investigation's wife
[42:43.480 --> 42:48.840]  would take a $500,000 payoff from Terry McAuliffe the governor of Virginia and
[42:48.840 --> 42:53.720]  a Clinton financial crony that's what's outrageous let's talk about that it's
[42:53.720 --> 42:58.640]  outrageous that James Comey would go through a litany of obvious crimes and
[42:58.640 --> 43:03.760]  then announce that she's not being prosecuted that's outrageous this this
[43:03.760 --> 43:09.960]  entire investigation says stunk from the beginning and now you have Harry Reid of
[43:09.960 --> 43:15.160]  all people a guy who through his political committee paid hundreds of
[43:15.160 --> 43:19.120]  thousands of dollars to his granddaughter for jewelry that was
[43:19.120 --> 43:24.400]  allegedly given to his donors I don't think that jewelry really exists
[43:24.400 --> 43:29.520]  complaining about the integrity of the FBI and trying to change the subject to
[43:29.520 --> 43:35.240]  Trump's non-existent ties to Russia this idea that Trump is propped up by the
[43:35.240 --> 43:40.040]  Russians or funded by the Russians or coordinating with the Russians or that I
[43:40.040 --> 43:43.640]  or anybody else associated with Donald Trump are working for the Russians is a
[43:43.640 --> 43:47.560]  canard it's just I don't think that's working with the American people and
[43:47.560 --> 43:50.800]  it's come out in WikiLeaks that it's Hillary and others and and Harry Reid
[43:50.800 --> 43:54.440]  that's sold out the Communist Chinese it really isn't saying so now seeing their
[43:54.440 --> 43:59.400]  vicious response to Comey and the FBI what does that telegraph to you what's
[43:59.400 --> 44:03.600]  really behind this Friday move of Comey is it just to hedge his bet because he
[44:03.600 --> 44:09.840]  thinks Trump's gonna get in I still fail to believe that given what I know
[44:09.840 --> 44:14.760]  about Washington and how it works that the FBI director would make this
[44:14.760 --> 44:20.000]  decision without the approval of his boss the president of the United States
[44:20.000 --> 44:25.920]  I know that Obama says he was blindsided I know Lynch the Attorney General says
[44:25.920 --> 44:30.800]  she was blindsided I just find that extremely hard to believe given the
[44:30.800 --> 44:37.400]  chain of command and the impact of such a decision he allegedly gave them no
[44:37.400 --> 44:41.840]  heads up on his previous decision as well well I find that hard to believe as
[44:41.840 --> 44:46.200]  well we're at a lynch is at this point so compromised I don't know why she
[44:46.200 --> 44:50.280]  stays in office why do you think she took the fifth on the whole 1.7
[44:50.280 --> 44:53.480]  billion to Iran we know they got caught lying at first it was 400 million then
[44:53.480 --> 44:57.440]  500 million then 800 million that a billion I mean wow normally when you
[44:57.440 --> 45:01.440]  see attorney generals taking the fifth we're in the Nixonian era yeah well I
[45:01.440 --> 45:04.800]  don't think John Mitchell ever took the fifth in fact I think he fully and
[45:04.800 --> 45:09.360]  completely testified so you have the most political and perhaps the most
[45:09.360 --> 45:13.160]  corrupt attorney general in American history although with Eric Holder
[45:13.160 --> 45:17.680]  before her that's quite a statement this is the whole thing boggles the mind
[45:17.680 --> 45:22.440]  and their position today attacking the FBI saying that they have no evidence
[45:22.440 --> 45:27.240]  they have 650,000 emails to go through there has to be something in there that
[45:27.240 --> 45:33.520]  got their attention to make such a bold and potentially cataclysmic move for
[45:33.520 --> 45:40.240]  Hillary Clinton this I perhaps is the October surprise well the only question
[45:40.240 --> 45:44.760]  is does anybody else have those 650,000 or will the FBI release them cuz Hillary
[45:44.760 --> 45:49.120]  keeps acting like she wants them all released you think that's bravada yeah
[45:49.120 --> 45:52.600]  I think she's trying to run out the clock I mean she clearly understands they
[45:52.600 --> 45:56.360]  cannot conduct an investigation in the eight days that are left before this
[45:56.360 --> 46:01.480]  election so she said she is attempting to do strategically what I think anyone
[46:01.480 --> 46:07.240]  would do go on a offense stay on offense but it's Buster she knows I suspect
[46:07.240 --> 46:11.400]  that what's in this what's in these emails should sink her on the other hand
[46:11.400 --> 46:17.080]  what we have seen from WikiLeaks already is extraordinary there's only weeks ago
[46:17.080 --> 46:21.760]  that liberals were laughing that Alex Jones and Roger Stone and all their tin
[46:21.760 --> 46:27.720]  hat tinfoil hat followers you know can pack it in because WikiLeaks is taking
[46:27.720 --> 46:33.320]  a taking a hike well how'd that work out not too well the stuff that he's
[46:33.320 --> 46:39.240]  putting out I agree you I think it's genius just the constant drip drip drip
[46:39.240 --> 46:46.800]  of extraordinary information and now we learn that Podesta was essentially a
[46:46.800 --> 46:51.520]  Podesta and band were playing with stock options Bill Clinton was playing with
[46:51.520 --> 46:56.600]  stock options all out of Russia yet they say Trump is the one in bad blue
[46:56.600 --> 47:01.080]  Russia I've talked to Donald about this he has no Russian business interests he
[47:01.080 --> 47:08.120]  has no Russian loans he has no Russian partners this is all BS it's a trumped
[47:08.120 --> 47:11.600]  up witch hunt to change the subject from the fact that the Clintons are
[47:11.600 --> 47:20.720]  epically corrupt and they're the ones in the service of the Russians now getting
[47:20.720 --> 47:25.280]  back to Abedin we can't have Hillary in just because of the black male ability
[47:25.280 --> 47:28.640]  now of Hillary with her illegal server all these foreign governments all the
[47:28.640 --> 47:32.360]  things they've got on her and Abedin even though Hillary ordered them all to
[47:32.360 --> 47:36.080]  smash it with hammers bleach it with these computer programs what was she
[47:36.080 --> 47:40.480]  doing keeping this I mean this stinks to high heaven of espionage you've always
[47:40.480 --> 47:46.680]  basically fingered her as a some type of foreign Islamist Saudi operative well
[47:46.680 --> 47:52.640]  I have traced her to the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs which is an
[47:52.640 --> 47:59.080]  offshoot of the world Muslim League and together they are part of the Rabitha
[47:59.080 --> 48:04.520]  Rabatha Trust which our Justice Department says financed the attack on
[48:04.520 --> 48:09.920]  the United States on 9-11 all three of those radical entities are funded by
[48:09.920 --> 48:18.720]  Sheikh Omar Abdul Nasif who is the most radical of Islamics a man who believes
[48:18.720 --> 48:27.400]  in Jihad man who has been a funder of terrorism so those who say that Huma is
[48:27.400 --> 48:32.400]  connected to the world Muslim pardon me to the Muslim Brotherhood I think are
[48:32.400 --> 48:40.240]  confused by the fact that the journal that Huma co-edited praised the Muslim
[48:40.240 --> 48:46.080]  Brotherhood but the Muslim Brotherhood is largely Egyptian her lineage is Saudi
[48:46.080 --> 48:51.280]  she shows up in Washington prior to hooking up with the Clintons and she's
[48:51.280 --> 48:56.760]  got a lavish lifestyle she buys an expensive home in the spring Valley
[48:56.760 --> 49:03.360]  area she is a perfectly coiffed she's wearing she's carrying a $1,500 handbag
[49:03.360 --> 49:07.880]  one for every day of the week in a different color all of these things
[49:07.880 --> 49:14.560]  cano given the fact that her parents are poor academics that she's a government
[49:14.560 --> 49:18.880]  agent oh absolutely and now she's in the bedroom with Hillary you know folks have
[49:18.880 --> 49:22.560]  pointed out that Hillary needs to answer the question will you pardon herself if
[49:22.560 --> 49:27.320]  the press wasn't completely in her lap they would be asking her hey are you
[49:27.320 --> 49:30.560]  gonna pardon yourself of criminal information comes out because it already
[49:30.560 --> 49:35.360]  has I mean where is the press talking about Obama caught lying and in emails
[49:35.360 --> 49:41.000]  with a fake pseudonym identity I mean this is unbelievable so Trump is out
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.120]  there saying hey I bet there's bombshells in this new information what
[49:44.120 --> 49:48.800]  about all the old bombshells well the mainstream media has played the exact
[49:48.800 --> 49:52.240]  opposite role that they played in the Watergate days they believe their job is
[49:52.240 --> 49:55.760]  to suppress information that's detrimental to Hillary we're in the
[49:55.760 --> 50:01.120]  70s and 80s 70s the Washington Post the New York Times particularly felt it was
[50:01.120 --> 50:05.520]  their mission to uncover corruption and particularly corruption of the electoral
[50:05.520 --> 50:10.400]  process let's remember Nixon went down not really for anything that happened in
[50:10.400 --> 50:14.960]  government he really went down for the excesses in the 72 campaign the dirty
[50:14.960 --> 50:19.720]  tricks and the break-in and no one to this day has ever proved that he knew
[50:19.720 --> 50:24.560]  about the Watergate break-in in advance and approved it as opposed to Hillary who
[50:24.560 --> 50:29.320]  clearly based on James O'Keefe's work at Veritas knew about the efforts to incite
[50:29.320 --> 50:33.800]  violence at the Trump rallies and she not only approved them but she pushed for
[50:33.800 --> 50:38.000]  them also the public seems to be uninformed on this and I know you live
[50:38.000 --> 50:42.640]  with the whole Nixon era as the youngest member of his active team out there
[50:42.640 --> 50:45.240]  one of the only folks I guess I didn't go to prison because it was pretty when
[50:45.240 --> 50:51.280]  you weren't involved in the dirtier aspects of it but looking at this I mean
[50:51.280 --> 50:53.960]  even the New York Times admits that a lot of pardons are for people who haven't
[50:53.960 --> 50:58.280]  even indicted or convicted and Hillary could pardon herself and there's nothing
[50:58.280 --> 51:02.880]  Congress could do about that here's the headline from law news a president
[51:02.880 --> 51:07.880]  Clinton could pardon herself and Congress might be helpless to act break
[51:07.880 --> 51:13.880]  that down for people well I think it on an intermediate basis remember their
[51:13.880 --> 51:17.920]  elections in November but she would not become president be sworn in until
[51:17.920 --> 51:22.360]  January if she should manage to squeeze out a victory which I think is looking
[51:22.360 --> 51:27.040]  less and less likely the momentum in this race is very definitely with Donald
[51:27.040 --> 51:32.600]  Trump a new New York Times upshot poll has him up four points in Florida a
[51:32.600 --> 51:38.080]  trend reversal but in his approval rating is higher than it has been in any
[51:38.080 --> 51:41.080]  previous poll I believe and that's what the oversampling of still of
[51:41.080 --> 51:46.520]  Democrats presumably but you so I mean the trend line is fairly positive on the
[51:46.520 --> 51:51.480]  other hand he's got some ground to make what are the odds that Obama agrees to
[51:51.480 --> 51:57.600]  pardon her in the period between the election and her inauguration in return
[51:57.600 --> 52:04.880]  for passing on the presidency in which case the Tim Kaine would be sworn in as
[52:04.880 --> 52:09.400]  president as I understand it that's a pretty scary prospect to the Joker as
[52:09.400 --> 52:12.480]  president yes sir we've only got five minutes left here and I appreciate you
[52:12.480 --> 52:16.960]  joining us each day stoneculture.com Roger I've been asking the questions
[52:16.960 --> 52:20.920]  what else is on the board what else are you concerned about I mean I don't want
[52:20.920 --> 52:24.160]  to say we've got this in the bag but as you said the momentum is totally shifted
[52:24.160 --> 52:28.720]  just amazing things are happening what what else could they pull what other
[52:28.720 --> 52:33.160]  dirty tricks I mean what keeps you up at night I'm still concerned about
[52:33.160 --> 52:37.720]  election day I'm still concerned about their ability to hack the machines and
[52:37.720 --> 52:40.680]  the one breath they say the Russians are going to hack this election in the next
[52:40.680 --> 52:44.920]  breath they say these machines can't be hacked which is it and one breath of the
[52:44.920 --> 52:49.160]  president says voter fraud does not exist in the next breath he says but we're
[52:49.160 --> 52:55.120]  sending the UN to go monitor for it you know I'm always worry about the old I'm
[52:55.120 --> 53:00.240]  from the government and I'm here to help you line so international observers
[53:00.240 --> 53:06.520]  non-us observers at our polling places this is deeply disturbing and now again
[53:06.520 --> 53:12.840]  just this morning I was on with Fernando Amandi a Democratic talk show host
[53:12.840 --> 53:18.760]  liberal very lively guy very smart and he again repeated this canard that
[53:18.760 --> 53:23.560]  voter fraud does not exist if you go to dredge today I think there's 30 different
[53:23.560 --> 53:28.360]  stories from areas around the country where it's already begun you just wonder
[53:28.360 --> 53:32.040]  what world these liberals live in
[53:32.320 --> 53:38.840]  Roger shifting gears into another subject Danny Williams who I believe is
[53:38.840 --> 53:43.160]  the illegitimate son of Bill Clinton from Little Rock, Arkansas he's having a
[53:43.160 --> 53:48.560]  press conference tomorrow which snuck up on me so they're claiming we're all
[53:48.560 --> 53:51.040]  orchestrating this I didn't know this was happening till they handed it to me
[53:51.040 --> 53:54.600]  during the last segment Danny Williams press events I'm trying to now send a
[53:54.600 --> 53:59.800]  reporter of Little Rock, Arkansas who says he's the biracial son of former
[53:59.800 --> 54:03.480]  president Bill Clinton a lot of evidence shows he is is going to be holding a
[54:03.480 --> 54:07.000]  press conference in Washington DC for a major announcement regarding his effort
[54:07.000 --> 54:11.320]  to get the former president Bill Clinton to submit a DNA test to confirm or to
[54:11.320 --> 54:20.000]  dispel his father or the paternity and that it's Tuesday November 1st 2016 at
[54:20.000 --> 54:26.000]  high noon that's tomorrow the National Press Club in the Peter Zinger room
[54:26.000 --> 54:33.160]  Z-E-N-G-E-R room 529 14th Street Northwest Washington DC so that's
[54:33.160 --> 54:37.000]  tomorrow the National Press Club we're gonna tweak this out I'm gonna put this
[54:37.000 --> 54:42.000]  on Facebook and obviously everybody should be there that's another important
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.600]  facet isn't it Roger well it's very interesting I'm gonna be curious to see
[54:45.600 --> 54:50.320]  what he has to say you know I interviewed him for my book the Clinton's war on
[54:50.320 --> 54:56.200]  women there's an entire chapter on him and then in the paperback edition I
[54:56.200 --> 55:00.320]  received a lot of new information that I didn't have when the first book went to
[55:00.320 --> 55:07.480]  Deadline so I actually updated that with an appendix at the end we now know that
[55:07.480 --> 55:17.720]  the 1999 so-called DNA test conducted by the star tabloid was directed by David
[55:17.720 --> 55:22.880]  Kendall who was at that time hired by Robert Altman a Clinton crony and a
[55:22.880 --> 55:29.120]  pointee to be the general counsel for the star so this was a put-up job we
[55:29.120 --> 55:33.480]  know that the alleged DNA test which supposedly showed that Clinton was not
[55:33.480 --> 55:39.280]  Williams father had to be inconclusive because they had no sample of Bill's DNA
[55:39.280 --> 55:45.080]  they used a written report that was attached to the Ken star impeachment
[55:45.080 --> 55:49.200]  report that he sent to the Congress and the problem with that is there were two
[55:49.200 --> 55:53.800]  tests that were utilized to determine paternity but they only included the
[55:53.800 --> 55:59.760]  results of one on the basis of that information alone no forensic scientist
[55:59.760 --> 56:02.800]  I interviewed for my book thought you could make a decision what's right you
[56:02.800 --> 56:07.320]  can't test we're out of time but the two articles on info wars.com I want to ask
[56:07.320 --> 56:10.640]  your opinion on they just went up top pollster the dam is about to break
[56:10.640 --> 56:15.160]  Hillary is hemorrhaging he says multi-point today it's over are the
[56:15.160 --> 56:19.480]  polls about to come out that's Varney and Cohen Fox that's info wars.com
[56:19.480 --> 56:23.920]  Peter Thiel has come out saying Trump is the future opening up the Republican
[56:23.920 --> 56:28.160]  Party which is absolutely true I absolutely have a reformation of the
[56:28.160 --> 56:31.840]  horrible blue blood scum that had been in control of it for so long do you
[56:31.840 --> 56:37.600]  agree with those statements I absolutely do for those who think that the
[56:37.600 --> 56:40.960]  Trump movement is something the party is going to get out of its system and that
[56:40.960 --> 56:45.640]  were he to narrowly lose that he and his supporters will disappear into the night
[56:45.640 --> 56:50.480]  they said the same thing about Goldwater remember the party elders said okay the
[56:50.480 --> 56:54.320]  party's gotten over this now we'll return and Reagan Reagan came out of that
[56:54.320 --> 56:58.880]  yes that was it transformed the party the Trump movement will transform the
[56:58.880 --> 57:02.360]  party and you agree that that Trump seismically is three times what Barry

[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.400]  matters and CNN and everything think that like we're scripting everything with
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.880]  Trump scripting everything with roger stone it's because that's how they do
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.600]  stuff they get top-down orders they came in and said hey Danny Williams is
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.680]  having a press conference and I had said when he was here like two weeks ago
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.760]  doing a press deal I said you contact us on Facebook and I've been I don't
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.880]  use it you're 20 years ago I said you want to go do it at the National Press
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.680]  Club and then I kind of forgot about it wandered off and then next up he's at
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:53.280]  the National Press Club tomorrow and I'm sure it'll be jones manipulated the
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:58.880]  whole deal from behind the scenes no that's how you guys do it not us
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:07.840]  absolutely ridiculous how you were so centralized now let's go ahead see you
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.080]  can't beat us because we're not centralized and we're promoting
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:15.200]  prosperity that's like selling snow cones in hell now remember this clip this
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:20.400]  is a year ago Donald Trump unloads on Hillary umma abadine and Anthony Wiener
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.680]  what a crew of weirdos who would want to hang around with any one of those freaks
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.640]  they all look like somebody be like a pervert or something and then of course
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:34.760]  they are but notice how right he was in the epic rant now he's back again but
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:40.120]  but first let's go to that clip here he is so umma now is one of the people that
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:47.520]  it all sort of came through umma who is umma married to one of the great
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:55.160]  sleazebags of our time Anthony Wiener did you know that April 2015 married to
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:02:04.920]  Anthony Wiener you know the little bing bing bing I love you very much
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.880]  so don't think of it by the way they come out and claim for white people he's
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.520]  got a big wildcard is getting classified secrets it's not it's not it's not it's
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:18.400]  not exactly the name of the names type build it close who's a perv
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:27.880]  oh yes he is so she's married now these are confidential documents she's married
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:34.240]  to this guy who's and guess what happens to Anthony Wiener a month ago I see he
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:39.560]  went to work for a public relations firm you believe it now if you think that
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:44.680]  umma isn't telling Anthony who she's probably desperately in love with in
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:48.120]  all fairness to Anthony because why else would she married this guy can you
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:53.040]  believe it I can't see straight but if you would
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.880]  we have this guy's present so almost got it's coming through almost he's got a
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:03.120]  lot of stuff a lot of information who knows so she's married to a bad guy I
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.760]  know Anthony Wiener for a long time I knew before they caught him with the
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:11.240]  bing bing bing right and he was a bad guy then it turned out that he was a
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:16.800]  really bad guy so she's married to Anthony Wiener do you think there's even
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.940]  a five percent chance that she's not telling Anthony Wiener now of a public
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:25.600]  relations firm what the hell is coming across do you think there's even a
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.320]  little bit of a chance I don't think so are there any now let's go to this
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.800]  latest clip we'll go out to break with this where he says they may have found
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.280]  the motherload will Trump be right again I mean you know some were saying a
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:39.440]  smoke screen maybe maybe we're wrong maybe limbo's wrong here it is if she
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:46.440]  never heard the word email do you think she'd be a very happy woman today now
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:59.040]  it was just learned by the way that they found 650,000 emails on the current
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:06.000]  investigation of somebody else you know in the diamond business and the cold
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.120]  business called don't worry we're putting your miners back to work clean

[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:27.080]  be the 15,000 that are missing three weeks ago they're missing a big box of
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:34.280]  emails think you're at 650,000 what do you have to do to do 650 just if you sat

[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:19.920]  Paul Joseph Watson says that a new email released by WikiLeaks as a part of the
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.040]  Podesta dump reveals that former CNN commentator and current chairperson of
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:28.200]  the DNC Donna Brazil gave Hillary Clinton a major question before the

[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.400]  regarding the debate I guess that really doesn't apply to Hillary Clinton and her

[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:50.480]  top pollsters reporting that the dam is broken Hillary is hemorrhaging and that
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:55.640]  polls show massive swings against her now they've been sampling nine in some
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:01.800]  cases 40 almost 50 points in CNN and ABC polls more Democrats than they do
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:06.360]  Republicans and I tell people this and they go really and shit it's been in
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:11.000]  mainstream news so is it that a form of fixing things and it's in the WikiLeaks
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.040]  that Hillary said we should basically control the outcome and stage and rig
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:20.920]  the Palestinian election that was back when she was Secretary of State we've
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:26.600]  got that clip coming up so to have President Obama say election fraud what
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:32.200]  is that it's crazy I mean they know what happened to Al Gore in 2000 I'm a
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:35.440]  nonpartisan guy but the evidence pointed towards him being robbed a lot of
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.840]  conservatives got mad at me I got dumped on a lot of stations because they're
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:42.080]  like well what do you mean you know Bush is a conservative and I'm like no he's
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:50.080]  not well now we've seen massive massive evidence coming in of major election
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:56.720]  fraud since 2000 I mean certified in Ohio you name it so to have Obama counter
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.800]  myself and Trump and say it doesn't exist but then say but it's the worst ever
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:06.400]  the Russians we've got to basically federalize it is schizophrenic or maybe
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.400]  if they think we're dumb come like Bloomberg us on Friday said we should
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.600]  let illegals vote in cities are passing laws let them do it and but Trump's
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.920]  insane it's not happening no CBS News they're all reporting all over the
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:25.640]  country from Texas to Colorado to New York to Michigan to California that
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:31.640]  dead people are voting any legals are voting it's going on there's Bloomberg
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.560]  some citizens want their non-citizen immigrants to vote and it's it's
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:39.840]  happening San Francisco visitors opening up local elections and newcomers it's
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:44.120]  already happening my issue here is the integrity of the system is what it's all
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:50.120]  about a bev Harris again is a former I guess federal crime investigator expert
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.840]  fraud expert I mean her her whole bio so lengthy I don't want to butcher it we
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.680]  really appreciate her joining us it's hard to get her on because she really
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:00.520]  has her nose to the grindstone we're gonna give out her website on there as
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:03.600]  well another several so I'll let her give out the one that she thinks is best
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:07.280]  she was behind the whole hacking democracy on the top documentaries in
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:12.960]  US history or world history showing election fraud documenting it black box
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:20.000]  voting dot org is again her main site it's incredible she's got a new video
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.560]  out today that I'll let her set up and tell you about we'll play a few minutes
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:29.440]  of it the full video is on black box voting org and info wars dot com but
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.600]  for anyone to say it doesn't exist just isn't living on planet Earth so I want
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.520]  to ask her what she thinks that signifies and what early info she's seeing
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:41.920]  with early voting that we know some of the heaviest ever recorded and they
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.880]  were saying they thought it would show Hillary having a lead early on but for
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:48.160]  some reason it doesn't show that so now the press isn't reporting it and I
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:51.280]  understand Bev probably doesn't have a dog in this fight I haven't asked her
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:54.880]  what she thinks of Donald Trump or Hillary but is just trying to work on
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:58.640]  the integrity of our system that's why she's the leading advocate and a
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.120]  researcher in my humble view and in most people's view on elections here in this
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:08.880]  good old USA so Bev thanks for coming on with us well it's nice to be back yeah I
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:14.120]  have been working a lot what is the best website to give out blacks box voting
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:21.560]  dot org yeah all right where should we begin well you know we found some new
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:26.760]  information and I think it's the the missing piece that we didn't have before
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:32.960]  a gentleman by the name of Benny Smith out of Memphis Tennessee discovered what
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:38.680]  I would characterize as a master key which essentially lets one person
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:44.080]  control with invisibly and with remarkable precision down to the precinct
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.120]  level and down to the type of voting early voting and so forth or whatever
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:52.160]  type they want many different locations at once multiple counties admit
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:59.280]  multiple states it has actually been in the system since it it is put in the
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:06.080]  system in 2001 but it was they became into wide youth in 2006 but it kind of
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:11.760]  took someone with a special set of skills to know what to look for he didn't
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:15.320]  just be like do like most of the people did where he says well let me just look
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:20.880]  at the program and see what I think he is a guy who has some background in
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:28.440]  political forecasting and so forth and he knew what would be needed he kind of
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:33.040]  went let me design what I think would be needed in order to succeed with widespread
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:38.080]  election fraud and after he did that he went now let me see if the pieces that I
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:42.960]  know are necessary are built into the system they should not be and he was
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:49.880]  amazed when he found after looking at the files that the pieces were built in
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:57.560]  to commit very large-scale fraud using a feature that had been very little known
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:03.720]  before and you have this amazing video on your site we've also just published it
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:09.840]  how America's elections are hacked missing link discovered top election
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:15.160]  fraud expert Bev Harris exposes election electronic voting machines this is a
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:20.560]  big big deal so let's take some time out and walk through this this amazing
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:27.760]  discovery sure well you know the thing that he thought was needed which I
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.240]  didn't really understand until I met him and actually started putting together
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:36.840]  this video he said the one thing you need the key element is you need to have
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:41.320]  the votes counted as fractions you need the votes to be counted with decimal
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:45.800]  places like you count money you have to have not just if a vote is a dollar you
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:50.760]  also have to have cents on the end of it like sixteen thousand point three one
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:56.440]  right why do you need now that will not show it's hidden but you need that
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:00.240]  because any he said you know you never there's one thing you don't know you
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:04.280]  can't know before the election and that's how many people will show up at
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:08.800]  each polling place in each precinct so if you start doing things like I'm going
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.520]  to do every third vote I'm going to add a hundred votes here you're going to get
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:16.120]  you're not going to be very precise instead you need to do and what in
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:23.160]  finance they call an allocation you say whatever number of people show up the
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:29.120]  guy is going to get x percent of those votes whatever they are now think about
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:34.560]  this if you have a hundred votes and you say my guy's going to get forty three
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:38.000]  percent that's forty three votes but if you have ninety nine people show up
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.200]  what's going to happen you're going to end up with forty two point something
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:47.560]  something something votes so if your system is not capable of counting votes
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:54.000]  with decimals it can't do that allocation and what so what he did was he
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.840]  knew that that's how it would have to be done and it would have to be very
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:01.120]  specific done to the precinct level so he actually went looking and said let me
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:05.680]  see this is the databases can be configured any way you want and they
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.200]  should be configured and used to be configured to count each vote is a
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:13.000]  whole number it's called counting it as an integer a whole integer so he went
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.800]  in and looked and said let me see it should count it as a whole integer and
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:21.760]  sure enough they had changed the setting in all of the voting machines in
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:26.960]  America the master computers this is not the machines out in the precinct this
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:30.520]  is the master computers that control all the voting machines that this is
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:34.240]  incredible and again time and time again you and your researchers
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:37.600]  tirelessly around the country have exposed the different ways they're doing it
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:41.560]  and so I guess is a top you know fraud investigator you're able to reverse
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.120]  engineer okay if we are going to steal it how will we do it let's look for this
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:48.560]  and then sure enough you've you know you've caught them dialing in remotely
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.040]  you can't yeah you know with you in other words anybody can sit there and go
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:56.960]  well this looks like a vulnerability theoretically this is not a theory this
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.760]  is real this is something that was put into the system they actually change the
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.920]  setting we can we can actually find we can actually go back and figure out now
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:09.160]  that we know it exactly the date that the setting was changed and that it
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:16.920]  migrated to all the other manufacturers in the US so now at this point votes the
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:22.600]  setting is in there to be able to allocate votes by percent to you know in
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:29.520]  basically 99% of the votes in the US now what that means is that and then he
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:36.040]  went on and he basically proved it he said now that I know that's in there I
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:41.680]  think I can allocate the votes and it is stunning when you see the demo it let's
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:45.600]  be clear let's be clear you're you're finding this in the voting software you
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:52.200]  go in it's this algorithm or system to be able to basically program it to show
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:57.840]  the outcome you want by shaving votes I mean in a lay person who's not a you
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:03.560]  know expert like you or a top computer programmer what's happening yeah and and
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:07.640]  think about this you've got all these different precincts you know it's been
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:12.440]  so hard to watch TV knowing what I know and watch them up there getting it
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:17.200]  completely wrong and you see these people on TV saying well including so
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:21.160]  called experts which I'm so disgusted with at this point like well it couldn't
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:25.600]  be done because the blah blah blah blah blah blah blah now this can be done by
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:32.560]  one or a couple of people across whole jurisdictions I actually didn't want to
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:37.040]  write the story unless I was absolutely sure so not only did I see him do it but
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:42.820]  I had him show me how it was done and I took some vote databases real vote
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:47.240]  databases that I have one of them was the entire state of Alaska the vote
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:51.600]  database from the 2004 election I was able to change every precinct at all in
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:57.000]  the state of Alaska in four seconds whoa Bev Harris is our guest top election
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:05.640]  fraud expert the woman behind of course exposing 2004 2000 2008 2012 it's been
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:11.680]  certified in multiple states that fraud was taking place the lady behind the top
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:16.680]  documentary out there on election fraud hacking democracy with HBO and in live
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:21.760]  time with with the computer experts they are manipulating and changing the votes
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:25.560]  if you're a radio listener it's on screen for people at info wars.com
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.320]  Ford's last show we're gonna skip this network break this is too important we
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:35.080]  then have the article on info wars.com how American elections are hacked as
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:39.560]  missing link discovered this is bombshell top vote fraud expert bed of
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:44.440]  Harris exposes electronic voting machines I mean this is so upsetting that
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:49.840]  I'm sitting here actually getting short of breath I mean this rarely happens I'm
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:55.080]  having an anxiety attack on air folks that's a normal response by the way
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:20:01.120]  because this is just so painful to know we've got the wiki leaks where they're
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:05.880]  rigging the polls telling them how to over sample we've got them you know how
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:10.360]  to set up the burning supporters we've got them how to manipulate the media and
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:13.720]  and just to see the corruption and to know the corruption that Bush was
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:17.160]  involved in and nobody got in trouble and just to see it getting worse and
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:21.960]  worse and worse and now to have you with the smoking gun evidence of this is
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.920]  just unbelievably amazing I'm just asking how do we get this out to
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:32.160]  everybody Beth well hey you're quite a help and I you know I'm going to be
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:38.480]  sending it out to all of my lists and all of my media lists and you know this
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:44.000]  is maybe the mainstream press is a little scared to report this at this
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.400]  point but I do know that mainstream press has actually come to Benny Smith's
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:55.080]  house and videotape this and they know about it so if in a week or so we don't
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:59.040]  start seeing this in the mainstream press it's because we know why you know
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:02.320]  the same old same old same reason they don't report wiki leaks because they
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:07.200]  know about it well that's right and again oh if it's Bush or the Republicans
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:11.080]  involved in chicanery well that's that's something you know it has to be exposed
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:15.120]  but if it's if it's Hillary and George Soros and these big multinational
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:20.840]  combines and the big banks that are 20 to 1 giving to Hillary it's the very same
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:26.520]  kleptocratic corporate system that wants to block a populist movement I mean
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:32.560]  taking Donald Trump out of the equation clearly the big-powered money interests
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:36.000]  do not want Trump in they do not want Briggs it to happen they do not want
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.860]  Russia to get out of the EU that's my view on it what is what or to have
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:44.280]  Russia you know get out of the whole globalist relationship with the EU
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:49.040]  that's my view on it Beth Harris what is your view well you know you said
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.200]  something that really resonated with me when you said you almost get short of
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:56.760]  breath and so forth the difference between this which is called fraction
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:00.240]  magic if anybody just wants the simple route they can go to YouTube and put in
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:04.280]  two words fraction magic and they will get to this video but the difference is
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:08.720]  this is really real and even though I've been doing this work for so many years
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:12.680]  and of course you have to been doing this kind of work when you see that
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:17.640]  something is really real it still takes your breath away yes still incredibly
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:24.760]  painful and I had the same reaction it's this is painful to watch and painful to
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:30.160]  know about but it's really real wow I didn't know you have the same response
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:34.680]  it's just it's knowing you're being robbed it's like coming home and your
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.520]  stereo and your grandmother's vase is gone and your wife's jewelry is gone
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:41.200]  that's happened to most of us and you're out of breath it's not losing the things
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:46.560]  it's the feeling of violation I think it's coming up against that well it's
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:51.800]  I have this reaction when I when I come directly up against abusive power
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:57.320]  there's another clip in the video that's quite shocking which was video taken
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:01.760]  during an investigation in a particular particular election by me and a
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:08.600]  Florida citizen named Susan Pinchon and you see actual video or are you there
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:13.000]  I'm sorry I think you hit your please repeat it okay anyway use the actual
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.560]  video of abuse of power and you have that terrible reaction where in a legal
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.600]  requirement required by the courts they are supposed to turn over the list of
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:27.760]  information on their election computer and she catches them are running out of
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:34.960]  the building with the computer now when you see stuff like that it's abuse of
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.080]  power you know what you're facing and they treat you very badly and they
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:43.360]  they just get very they start blaming you for the fact that they're running
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:46.280]  out of the building with the computer and you had the temerity to videotape
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:49.720]  them doing that you see this guy in the video saying get that camera out of my
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:54.200]  face and get her away from me you know well yeah you're running out of the
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.760]  building with the computer with the election information that the court
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:05.080]  has ordered you to turn over but they it's it's when you confront abuse of
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:10.880]  power up close and personal it is extremely painful and it takes courage
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:17.440]  to do and I just take my hat off to the citizens that are out there doing work
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:22.240]  to actually open up the government and get it transparent again and take it
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.720]  back Beth Harris I've been on air 21 years I've interviewed you probably 30
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.840]  times over the years I've never been this blown away watching the video it's
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.320]  it's on screen right now for radio listeners they go to info wars.com
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:40.240]  it's in the article how America's elections are being hacked missing link
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:45.920]  discovered this is just so bombshell or just go to blackboxvoting.org
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:50.680]  fraction magic is the top story they're on the left get this video from YouTube
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:54.960]  and make it go super viral bev if it's okay with you I'd love to mirror the
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:58.920]  video on my Facebook my yeah sure of course fantastic so we'll upload it to
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:03.360]  info wars channel so that our millions of subscribers can see this this video
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:08.560]  needs 50 million views in fact every voter in America you know they're talking
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:13.040]  about a hundred million people voting or something everybody needs to see this
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:18.240]  and understand this is going on I mean this is probably undoubtedly the the
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:24.600]  most shocking election news the most bona fide caught red-handed built in to
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:28.920]  manipulate the outcome and then people running away with the computers like
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:34.880]  something out of a Hollywood movie I mean I am speechless so I'm gonna play a
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.600]  minute and a half excerpt that's the intro to the piece and then we come back
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.840]  from break we can actually play the part she was just talking about for radio
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:47.400]  listeners with audio again but but Bev just spend a few minutes now again for
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:51.200]  new listeners that's just tuned in describing what type of system this is
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:58.000]  how many machines this is on how this is done yeah this is the now everybody
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.800]  thinks about the voting machines out in the precinct as Benny Smith who who
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:07.360]  developed this and basically figured this out says why go to those machines I
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:11.240]  wait for the votes to come to me at the end of the day all the votes come to
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:15.680]  one central location so it's the central tabulation center that's where
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:19.400]  they're controlled they start over I'm sorry just so incredible for me because
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:22.440]  we're all big Rob here folks we're all not being robbed of our refrigerator
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:27.040]  that's bad enough for our car our literal Republic our democracy and we
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.840]  have this champion this Joan of Arc literally I don't want to kiss your
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:33.360]  even you're an amazing lady thank God for you Bev you just keep what scares me
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:37.200]  how it's so few people that keep coming through over and over and over again in
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:42.120]  this fight like like you know the folks at Project Veritas or you or Julian
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:45.560]  Assange I mean Bev Harris is right up there with those folks and we all have
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:49.160]  this sense of being robbed but the good news is we can do something if we get
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:53.520]  this video out so start over for folks explain how it's done yeah and so
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:56.880]  there's this one central computer which at the end of the day all the votes come
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:00.800]  to it that's where you take it you know run around to 5,000 different things in
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:05.120]  precincts you wait till the votes come to you and then you have your way with
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:11.880]  them and it's very very precise it's invisible and there's absolutely it
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:15.040]  doesn't matter whether the systems on the Internet or not none of the stuff
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:20.440]  that they say is the protection matters at all you have your way with them then
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:24.640]  you once you control a vote in whatever way you want for whatever target you
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:30.280]  want you know the election is done now there is something new that can be done
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:34.640]  and this is really exciting because it's kind of scaring the pants off of them
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:40.040]  actually and at the very end of the video I make sort of a cryptic reference to
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:45.440]  it but we didn't realize that more than half of the voting machines in the
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:50.080]  country now take a picture of every ballot even the touchscreen machines
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:55.120]  that supposedly have no paper are keep keeping an image of every ballot but
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.400]  now think about this you read a paper ballot through and it takes a picture
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:02.680]  of it and that's just an electronic file right that you should be able to get
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:07.960]  that under public records right request right it's just a file and you
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:11.000]  ought to be able to get all those images in fact there was one county in
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.640]  California that was putting all those on the web why not when they put them all
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:19.240]  on the web guess what happened everybody looked and found out there was a
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:23.840]  whole precinct that never got counted at all by the machine yeah so I mean
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:31.520]  essentially these ballot images are and must be public record and people must
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:34.960]  ask for them now let me tell you what happened when a gentleman from Arizona
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:39.120]  asked for them he said okay I want under my freedom of information rights I went
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:42.800]  all your ballot images basically you can do your own recount that way right and
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:48.280]  we did find that they do not succumb to the fraction magic attack well when he
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:54.920]  asked for them they said oh well we destroy them every day oh my goodness
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:58.040]  you bleach bit in the hammer I mean what's going on here it's a it's a
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:01.600]  crucial audit record and it's against the law to destroy them now Hillary on a
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:05.960]  Hiram yeah he went to judge he went to a judge he got a temporary restraining
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:10.920]  order to block them from destroying them in the November well that Harris stay
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:13.960]  there this is the most bombshell interview ever I mean we're both
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:17.000]  breathless here I know a lot of you are this is so document when you see the
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.360]  video it's on blackboxvoting.org it's on info wars.com the stories get it out
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:25.680]  to everybody I never even knew this but I'm sure drudge is gonna want to link to
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.240]  this this is so huge or to your investigation regardless it needs to
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.600]  get out there we're gonna upload these videos right now to our Facebook and to
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:38.240]  our YouTube we're gonna take this interview with Bev and edit it down and
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:43.240]  basically cut me out and and put it out tonight to go viral oh wow but I'm also
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:46.640]  very excited because I think this is probably the strongest evidence she's
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:51.040]  ever got we'll ask her if I'm right when we come back stay with us March the
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:58.160]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:04.040]  well does Democratic National Committee Chairman Donna Brazil ever know when to
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:08.320]  stop new WikiLeaks revealed that Donna Brazil gave Hillary Clinton yet another
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:12.680]  debate question in advance one of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:16.440]  from a woman with a rash this article up on our website written by Paul Joseph
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:20.560]  Watson says that a new email released by WikiLeaks as a part of the Podesta dump
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:25.000]  reveals that former CNN commentator and current chairperson of the DNC Donna
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.200]  Brazil gave Hillary Clinton a major question before the debate one of the
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.240]  questions directed to Hillary Clinton tomorrow is from a woman with a rash the
[01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:37.320]  email is entitled it was sent on March the 5th the day before Clinton debated
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:41.760]  Bernie Sanders in Flint, Michigan her family has led poison and she will ask
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.840]  that if anything will Hillary do as president to help the people of Flint
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:50.280]  reads the body of the email according to debate commission rules no candidate is
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:54.000]  supposed to be able to be given a question in advance regarding the debate
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.120]  I guess that really doesn't apply to Hillary Clinton and her cronies I'm

[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:32.760]  than taking somebody's life there's nothing bigger when it comes to theft
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:36.480]  unless it's murder and that's election fraud that's stealing someone's country
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:42.400]  and then acting like hey you voted you're all for it you support it and then
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:47.000]  to have Obama I mean imagine a bush would have said there's no such thing as
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.560]  election fraud period no they would just deny they were doing it and both sides
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:56.480]  were doing it Bev Harris is an American writer activist and founder of black box
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:00.080]  voting Inc a national nonpartisan nonprofit election watchdog group she
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:03.160]  helped to popularize the term black box voting while authoring a book on the
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:08.040]  same title I've been interviewing her for like 16 17 years in 2003 she
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:11.480]  discovered the source code of a voting machine manufacturer diable election
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:16.560]  systems which now operates under the name premier election systems after
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:21.800]  examining these files Harris wrote an article July 8 2003 detailing how the
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:28.040]  bypass passwords and manipulate election results on diable gyms central tally
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:32.400]  system it's all done centrally Harris follow whistleblower lawsuit legend that
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.000]  diable election systems had made false claims when selling their system to
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.920]  Alameda County California diable paid the state of California 2.6 million to
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:45.480]  settle the case black box voting org has now released she's done hundreds of
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:53.840]  other big epic you know wins for everybody now they have documented how
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:57.520]  they get the central tabulation systems regardless what type of machines they
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:05.280]  are can then take the data and shave it with an algorithm or fraction magic that
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:09.360]  anybody that's you know had math class knows about and they have video of it
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:14.000]  this should be the number one story in the country it's bigger than even Hilary
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.880]  and the emails and the corruption this is so huge I want to play a minute and
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:22.680]  a half intro where it's her description and then the film gets really powerful
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:28.000]  here it is there's a lot of assumptions being made by the public and when you
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.760]  actually go out in the field and try to authenticate each step it's very it's
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:36.440]  very surprising really I'm tired of her camera being on me I don't want her near
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:41.000]  me okay there's no this way in other words we're not able to give them what
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:51.080]  they want and watch what happens if you cap a candidate's results at 43% or any
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.400]  percent
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:07.920]  trolling results by precinct requires use of decimals and now imagine if the
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:12.240]  default setting is to hide the decimals right now the jumps program is
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:18.000]  installed in counting votes in 25 states and 616 jurisdictions but fractional
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.960]  counting began to migrate from the jumps program into other vendors voting
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:27.400]  systems which count votes as fractions may count as many as 99% of all American
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:34.040]  votes in 2016 we have these systems that are just simply not operating in a way
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:40.200]  that's accountable to the public and again we're going to take this many film
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:42.920]  and with our big production crew and everything obviously about some special
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:46.440]  reports today over the next few days I want to get the crew to be on this a
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:50.760]  hundred percent because the public back in 2000 wasn't awake to fraud like they
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:56.000]  are now they are supercharged mega awake and then it just gets more powerful as
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.360]  they go breaking it down bad do you think that's an accurate statement to say
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.320]  people are more informed now about election frothing we're in the past yeah
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:07.960]  I think that and you know they really jumped on Trump when he said I might
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:11.800]  not necessarily accept the result and they acted like it was undemocratic
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:16.200]  no what's undemocratic is to tell the public and the candidates that they
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:21.600]  must accept a result that they can never authenticate that is not democratic we
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:26.360]  were not set up like that and the public has an absolute right to be able to
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:31.240]  authenticate every essential step of the election so telling us that we have to
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:37.360]  accept it but we can never see the evidence is the most I don't even have
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:42.520]  words for what that is I don't know what that is it's propaganda it's total
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:47.200]  contempt it's total hubris yes it is it's impunity it's like we can do what we
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:51.240]  want and you know you mentioned that you said that it was we were a nonprofit I
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:55.160]  would update you on that because I we stripped the nonprofit status away from
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:59.080]  we ourselves did from black box voting in January of this year and there's a
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:03.880]  reason for that as a 501 C3 I was not permitted to say anything that could
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:09.920]  help or hurt a candidate and I knew coming into this year that I could not
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:14.400]  have that restriction on me so we basically stripped that out and we are
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:18.240]  operating as a full proprietorship right now I'm running it and I'm doing this
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:24.320]  exact exact same work but let me tell you a little bit partisan but I don't
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:27.800]  really care you know which it's not about candidates in which one wins but
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:32.320]  it's about the process right but one thing that I have noticed with the
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:38.080]  Clinton machine is that they telegraph what they're going to do they build a
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:43.160]  media narrative around it so people will accept the result and so one thing that
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:48.720]  has alarmed me very much is that I've been watching a media narrative that
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:54.640]  basically is targeting Georgia Utah and now Alaska indicating that those are in
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:59.320]  play and they might go you know might might reverse trend and go for Clinton
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:07.600]  Georgia Utah and Alaska are some of the very few states who are 100% that using
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:12.960]  this system with the fractional count and each one is controlled by one central
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:19.920]  power so when they knowing what I know about what this system can do if they
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:25.840]  said if this particular gem system was going to be used statewide which states
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:31.240]  would it be there's only four there's Georgia Utah Alaska and Mississippi
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:36.960]  that's it so to see three of the four suddenly saying they're in play what a
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:39.960]  surprise they haven't been for years and years but now they're in play that
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:45.640]  telegraphs to me that they plan to take those states or try you know Bev I'm
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:49.640]  not just saying this it's so amazing to talk to somebody who's so immersed in
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:55.240]  this and of course was a storied very successful fraud investigator previous to
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:59.480]  taking this on to just to be able to have you on and know and see how astute
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:03.320]  you are because almost everybody else I talked to in the media or in research
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:08.360]  doesn't get it but the mainstream media and the big think tanks will tell you
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:12.760]  what they're going to do before how they package the propaganda how they roll it
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:16.200]  out and exactly they're telling us that those states that were normally
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:22.560]  Republican are now going to go for Hillary and as you said you're more of a
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:25.920]  liberal but a classical liberal a real liberal the type of liberal I respect
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:29.720]  that tells the truth no matter what so I don't put words in your mouth but as a
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:35.000]  liberal I mean is it not clear that Hillary and the media are trying to
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.920]  sell the idea that there is an election fraud and that Trump's gonna lose by a
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:42.840]  landslide when the polls and everything else so something opposite let me put a
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:47.040]  display of course things have been very surprising of late but if she is still
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.840]  viable in any way whether or not she wins she will win Wow please say that
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:59.560]  again whether or not she wins she will win now she may be from removed from
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:03.600]  office afterwards and and as you may recall Richard Nixon was right in the
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:07.800]  middle he had been four months into Watergate scandals and was reelected and
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:12.760]  removed from office later but what's so disturbing about that is you know there's
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:19.000]  actually some Republican elites who might prefer getting her in and removing
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:24.120]  her from office of course of course of course they can't control of course
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:28.640]  exactly exactly the whole power structure is against Trump I mean whether
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:32.080]  he's perfect or good or bad I mean if we claim we're against the corrupt power
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:37.320]  structure then how could we not be for Trump I mean I'm sorry well you know and
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:44.160]  I really feel like this is them I'll say this as well whatever anyone thinks
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:50.600]  about the candidate I will say that when he has brought to the front the issue of
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:55.240]  tampering with elections it's one of the most important services that could have
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:42:01.400]  been done in the United States ever really important because it was taboo
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:05.560]  for the media to talk about it and it forced them to talk about it now they
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:08.840]  put a whole bunch of you know happy faces on it well it can't be done because
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:12.480]  blah blah blah blah which was kind of nonsense but it forced it out into the
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:17.200]  public into the open and I think you know that's kind of the beauty of
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:22.600]  actually having the real public actually pick their candidate is because you
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:27.840]  make you may get someone who at you know at first glance you kind of go I don't
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:32.640]  know about that but it can make the pendulum start to go back the other
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:38.720]  direction when that happens and I just think that that that alone was just so
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:46.640]  important because we cannot I mean if not now then sometime if we keep doing
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:52.440]  these unauthentic capable mystery elections there will be a perfect storm
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:56.120]  and there could be something that becomes very destabilizing we need to
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:01.520]  solve this problem that Harris I'd say a pure veritas from black box voting dot
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:08.040]  org founder now it is a profit think tank for free speech they can be more
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:11.760]  effective so be sure and go to that site and support her work no one on the left
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:15.960]  no one on the right no one internationally cannot say she is the
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:20.960]  highest respected for her integrity whether it was an HBO or MPR or vice or
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:25.720]  CNN or Fox News everyone has to admit this woman goes where the story is she
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:29.720]  exposes Republicans she exposes Democrats she exposes it all and you just
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:35.400]  heard her in deep research fraction magic voting going on in key stage where
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:39.760]  they can remotely at the central tabulation center shave the votes
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:44.880]  pre-program it and then hide it total proof these election machines are
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:50.000]  Pandora's box absolutely foisted the establishment wants us to be asleep to
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.440]  not know this is happening but just covering this today I want to thank
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:58.400]  drudgereport.com for caring about our elections it's top-linked middle column
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:02.120]  red-linked how America's elections are hacked missing link discovered vote fraud
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:10.160]  expert Bev Harris details it it is now up there on drudge quite frankly the
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:13.280]  article is important the video is powerful but I think this interview is
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:19.200]  even more illuminating I mean this I'm 21 years on air I am having trouble
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:23.680]  actually talking at this point this is so incredible if people haven't seen the
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:27.320]  video if they just tuned in to what Bev Harris was saying I'm gonna add a link to
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:30.280]  the article that's on drudge and I'm gonna tweet right now that real Alex
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:36.080]  shows you guys can tweet that you know top election expert is it is exposing
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:42.800]  smoking out of election fraud on air now I mean because I agree with her that
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:46.120]  the elite are preparing everyone for Trump to lose even though she's way
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:50.080]  behind even though they're adding 9 points 12 points 15 20 points in the
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:54.720]  samples even though every Democrat I know I mean folks almost every Democrat I
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:57.680]  know now in the last two weeks says they're voting for Trump it's happening
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:01.920]  all over the country I can't believe it now I mean I would get his debt wearing
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:05.320]  a Trump shirt six months ago now people covered say you know what she is a
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:09.440]  crook I'm going for him she robbed it from Bernie Sanders and so I think
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:12.600]  there's a huge landslide for Trump and I think she's right looking at the pre
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:15.720]  narrative how they're getting everybody ready for him to lose in these key
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:20.080]  states I think those are the states we watch so so Bev Harris you've got the
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:23.760]  floor for five minutes a lot of people tuning in right now recap the
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:27.960]  incredible smoking gun this isn't like you got the code to die bold and prove
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:30.680]  they could cheat and then went back and looked at some of the paper ballot
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:34.200]  evidence not matching it's not like you caught you know the programmers admitting
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:38.960]  they were stealing it you have absolute proof on how they're able to do it all
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:44.720]  over the country built into it built into it so they can you you have
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:50.120]  discovered the built crafted backdoor not some rat hole where they can you'll
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:55.040]  maybe do something you have you have discovered the smoking gun yeah and let
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:46:01.920]  me tell you who put it in there okay when Benny Smith found this at first you
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:05.160]  know he said well you know I suppose maybe it's just in Memphis where you are
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:09.720]  no no I got all my databases it was in all my databases and then he pointed me
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:14.920]  to some programmer emails and following those and some other documents I have we
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:18.320]  were able to pinpoint the exact date they put it in there now that date
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:24.400]  disturbed me very much it was in June 2001 because I knew that who controlled
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:30.560]  the company back then was a person who had been convicted of 23 counts of
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:36.160]  computer fraud and had formerly worked for I can't make this stuff up formerly
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:40.320]  employed by Bud Crow who was the head of the Watergate plumber's unit under
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:45.520]  Nixon this okay I still have people going well it could be in there for it for an
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:49.000]  okay reason it's just that it happens to be able to be used to control all the
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.280]  votes in the U.S. okay fine and it was put in there by a convicted computer
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.160]  criminal who spent four years in jail I was in the department of correction
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:01.000]  things who used to work for one of the Watergate people but if you you can
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.840]  believe what you want if it makes you feel better but I think it's pretty
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:10.560]  clear what's going on beyond sensational please continue well again I want to
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:15.760]  come back to the fact that the solution is already available to us and doesn't
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:19.280]  even cost anything these new machines are taking pictures of the ballots the
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:24.240]  ballots they should put those on the web pronto and if you simply yes
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.400]  technically you could alter an image but what you do is you have a serial
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:32.640]  number on every image and you also let people go and examine the paper ballots
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:35.960]  and match up those serial numbers and make sure they match if they feel like it
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:43.760]  game set match you cannot tamper the election very easily at all if you
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:47.520]  release all the ballot images have Harris you have solved it you have solved
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:51.160]  it check the ballot you've solved it with your team have a printer print off a
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:55.400]  copy it's got a serial number there's a digital copy of it people can spot check
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:00.480]  it and we all police are our republic and guess what those things are already
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:05.640]  available they're just not letting us at them so that's a great deal they're
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:10.480]  already there and at this point let's get rid of their excuses which are
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:15.080]  turning into so much nonsense and say okay we're done with that we're done
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:17.960]  with that fraction magic we are going to look at the ballot images we're going to
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:21.520]  look at the ballots do what you need to do again we're going to look we just
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:26.920]  tuned in bev Harris the top respected bipartisan election fraud expert broken
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:29.720]  more election fraud than every other election fraud expert in this country's
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:33.960]  hundred year history since we had modern modern reporting on it to a certain
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:39.440]  extent undoubtedly total credibility finding what I believe is her biggest
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:45.920]  breakthrough yet with this fraction magic this is actually the the Rosetta
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:51.440]  stone of fraud and so I want to ask her what do we do to reverse this because
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:54.840]  you're saying clearly the fix is in for Hillary one way or another she's getting
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:59.760]  in that says I mean I never heard you in the 16 17 years we've been talking ever
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:04.880]  using language like that I mean this is amazing right well one of the things to
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:08.480]  do if you've got the cloud is to get temporary restraining orders to prohibit
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:12.880]  prohibit them from destroying the ballot images why it's a federal record
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:16.640]  they're not even allowed to but they're doing that they're turning off the
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:19.240]  feature they're saying we need to turn off the feature so that they don't
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:23.520]  exist so that's one thing that can be done right now and whether or not that's
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:27.600]  done go ask for the ballot images go in there with a USB stick the day after the
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:30.360]  election and say I want all the ballot image images under my freedom of
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:34.440]  information right put them on this USB stick thank you very much and then if
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:39.000]  they obstruct or say they don't have them documented the videotape it document
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.800]  that they have destroyed the key audit record that would authenticate the
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:51.000]  count Wow Bev in your decades fighting this have you ever broken something this
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.720]  big no and I can't say that you know you keep giving me all these
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:59.160]  no I know you don't want the credit but you're the tip of the spear you've
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:03.120]  organized it what all I'm saying is for by listening I mean correct me if I'm
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:07.520]  wrong this is the big enchilada this is it is the big enchilada and the per that
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:13.200]  there's a man of tremendous courage in Memphis Tennessee named Benny Smith who
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:18.520]  was the guy who found this and unraveled this and basically showed me the key he
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:24.040]  called me a year ago he is the amazing African-American he's the amazing when he
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:29.920]  contacted me that he had the key I was like oh my goodness and we have
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.680]  literally where I've been putting this guy through his paces I did not want to
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:37.520]  report something unless I was absolutely dead certain that it was true tell us
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:42.160]  about it it's true tell us about this incredible American patriot on the
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:46.800]  other side what a game changer final segment with Bev Harris I'm almost going
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:49.480]  to just walk off and let somebody else host the next part of the show to be
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:52.120]  able to get this ready and get this out because well it's already out on drudge
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:55.720]  folks get it out on Twitter Facebook right now people are hungry for the
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:59.160]  truth Bev Harris and her researchers of this great American have blown it wide
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:03.320]  open incredible Bev you know in the coming election no matter who gets in
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:07.240]  one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about on the debates or anywhere
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:13.240]  is the vulnerability of the power grid the potential for power grid chaos EMP
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:19.240]  cyber warfare not to mention dangerous weather hurricanes ice storms all a very
[01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:23.240]  real threat to our grid my friends chaos is already here and it's going to get a
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:27.280]  lot worse that's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:31.520]  produce their own supply of backup electricity now I've got the perfect

[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:52.480]  headline do we put on this bev you're gonna have to choose I just want to be

[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:06.120]  enchilada or I mean you know it I just call it the magic key I mean it really
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:09.280]  literally as you picture janitor going down the hall with the master key

[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:20.080]  basically so you have found the mother load of election fraud yeah it tells you
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:27.200]  how to do everything and you know it's you really can can see it depicted and
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:30.240]  it's just and I know you want to get this fellow credit we are in a moment I
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:33.000]  want to get him on it you back on please please please I don't even want you on
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:37.280]  for months you've been quietly working on this briefly though George Soros 16
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:40.720]  states his company he's connected to others he's been caught a lot of stuff
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:47.920]  what do you make of that yeah um I have seen some indicators now there's a
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:51.760]  company called Dominion but there has been some mistakes where people thought
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:55.680]  that there the smartmatic was being used no smartmatic hasn't been used to here
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:58.960]  it's been used to in in Latin America and a bunch of other places but he's
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:02.800]  connected I think it's kind of through a couple of hoops but with a company called
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:07.600]  Dominion and Dominion is one of the ones that bought the Premier debold stuff
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:15.000]  and they have now admitted that they fractionalized the count whoa mm-hmm so
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:21.520]  I saw us connected group again it's you know it's sort of connected through a
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:28.720]  couple of arms length but it is it's enough so that I I wouldn't call I
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:34.200]  think there is some connection it's just it's like one of his guys guys sure
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:37.720]  well that's what he does with media matters and everything yeah and I mean
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:40.800]  that and that's kind of similar like Mitt Romney kind of got involved with
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:48.440]  Hardin or Civic but it was through his son you know and Senator Hagel directly
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:52.600]  Senator Hagel and all his hanky-panky so yeah yeah so I mean there's always gonna
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:59.560]  be a couple of buffers in between but Soros connected group it looks like
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:03.840]  maybe admitting to be involved in the whole fraction deal wow oh yeah they
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:08.440]  have yeah they they whether top guys said that they did it there's a person
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:12.240]  there's a group called defend the vote in Illinois and the woman involved with
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:17.360]  that Sharon Maroney actually confronted Dominion and said and they admitted that
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:21.040]  they do fractionalize the count and she asked them why and they said for
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:26.400]  marketing purposes wow they hide it and blame you I know you probably got it
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:30.600]  selling but I can guess I know you probably got to go but but how do we
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:35.480]  support blackboxvoting.org oh you know I still I really do need it I have not

[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:32.800]  minutes left for three and a half minutes of other key points you want to
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:35.920]  make to viewers and listeners and talk about the man in Tennessee that
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:42.280]  discovered this yeah well this is the key of it you know we all of us it is up
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:47.920]  to us and each of us has different skill sets that can do miraculous things
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:52.600]  Benny now the guy I told you about this computer fraud guy back in the day who
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:56.960]  actually put this in there he had three kinds of expertise he had expertise in
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.360]  database programming expertise in accounting and finance programming and
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:07.200]  expertise in political demographics along comes Benny Smith and for the first
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:12.600]  time looking at the system somebody with the same portfolio of skills he is a
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:17.200]  database programmer he works in finance and he understands programming for
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:21.840]  finance because this was related to that and he does political demographics he
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:26.960]  saw what was needed immediately because he had that set of skills and I'm
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:31.160]  telling you that say number one I just think this is a tremendous patriot a
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:36.520]  tremendous guy but also because very we each of us have different kinds of
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:40.840]  skills and stepping up to the plate but doesn't mean you need to go become a
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:45.520]  computer programmer if you're good at public speaking you go speak if you're
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:48.960]  a good writer you write you know it whatever it is if you're good at
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:55.440]  organizing people you organize but you step up stand up and do something well
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:58.760]  Benny Smith we salute you I mean if I had something other than water here and
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:02.040]  lemon juice I would I would I would toast you but that's not good luck but
[02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:05.840]  Benny Smith we salute you you're incredible man I know you never like it
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:09.520]  but let me tell you something I mean I interviewed the other vote fraud experts
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:11.680]  that were before you the call your brothers and others and they died and
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:15.080]  their daughters he's great and I and other folks I'm just saying you are so
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:19.080]  dynamic you've done with your crew and the folks ten times when anybody else
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:22.760]  ever did so that's why I single you out because you're amazing and you're such
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:28.600]  a treasure well thank you so much I it does mean a lot and mostly I do it
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:34.360]  myself I just do it because it's important you know and I think but there's a
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:37.960]  lot of people that are doing things and I there's a guy that you should have on
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:41.600]  that if you haven't yet his name is John breakie out of Arizona this man is a
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:45.240]  one-man dynamo he came out I've known him for ten years you tell us who to have
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:50.680]  on this year you tell us who to have on it's on you can program the info you
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:56.400]  got it I mean he is he's gonna blow your mind too and I mean this is what I see
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:04:01.520]  and this is what's exciting is people regular people are on to it stepping up
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:05.680]  and they are making a huge difference that's how we take it back
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:10.040]  well blackbox voting.org yeah you've been on the show 16 17 years and never asked
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:12.920]  for donations you try to sell a book or whatever to fund yourself she is asking
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:16.400]  for donations she's to get out there cover the election fraud this year now
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:19.880]  ongoing you heard her earlier and she's been a Democrat folks she's just being
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:22.920]  honest Hillary is stealing it the evidence is overwhelming it's very very
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:26.560]  sad Trump is right I mean I went to the doctor's office this morning for a
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:29.400]  checkup the nurse was telling me everybody including her sister I was on
[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:32.800]  the phone with her sister they're all having it flipped to Hillary we're out
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:36.680]  of time but what is this flipping that that's the old-fashioned yeah in Texas
[02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:41.240]  your Texas toast I say it can be happening at the voting machine also in
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:45.280]  Texas it can happen both places in Texas and there does seem to be flipping
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:49.240]  in different things happening there so maybe they just really really want to
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:54.360]  take Texas and they're just being a pulling out all the stops but again it
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:58.240]  comes back to in the long run we need paper ballots we need to be doing and
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:02.200]  you're exposing it thank you thank you family is are brought together by
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:06.640]  something right well a former assistant FBI director says that the Clintons are

[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:26.320]  that the family is like an organized crime syndicate now appearing on a
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:30.160]  radio show this week the FBI it's known is reopening the case of Hillary

[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:39.320]  is our guest he's the head of the von mis institute former head of Ron Paul's
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:45.640]  chief of staff a great political mind a true classical liberal slash libertarians
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:50.360]  what I'm calling I read the stuff at me start or I mean it's so untarget about
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:55.120]  how ideas are capital and wealth and how you know demanding excellence is what
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:59.040]  right arises up humanity and true competition you look at the liberals
[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:03.800]  banning Halloween sending in police to harass people launching all these wars
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:07.600]  trying to control language it's crazy now we've had the biggest event in info
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:14.680]  wars history in force has been around 19 years I've been on air 21 years and we
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:18.920]  had about six months ago some days where we had ten times our previous records
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:24.360]  of traffic on info wars dot com prison planet dot com this was Bev Harris we
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:30.680]  were having high traffic today we got five times the traffic we've ever had
[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:38.320]  now that's five times ten times the traffic we just had five times that is
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:42.280]  so exponential that there's over five million people at any one second on
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:46.960]  info wars dot com it is there's nothing else like it except for drudge report
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:50.160]  dot com and of course that's because drudge report dot com has us two red
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:55.680]  links dead center on drudge right now because drudge obviously was listening
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:59.440]  when we had Bev Harris on and Bev Harris is for months wouldn't come on she
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:02.160]  said I've got the biggest thing ever she came on she gave it to us first just like
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:05.560]  Veritas does and I'm just blessed I'm humbled because they know we won't send
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:09.080]  through me can come out this thing is going so viral so I want to get into this
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:14.200]  with Rockwell who is a patriot slash politico so he'll know what to do we can
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:17.760]  all put this together and then get into other issues in a few minutes but people
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:22.400]  are tuned in massively right now I mean just millions of extra people tuned in
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:26.000]  because people having their votes flipped weird stuff's happening the
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.240]  Democrats are saying we're gonna win Utah we're gonna win Texas even though
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:35.120]  polls show that Trump's gonna win that they've been adding nine 10 15 20 30 40
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:39.480]  points into polls oversampled Democrats they're doing corrupt things out in the
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:43.040]  open we've never seen now is it that we know more or they're just more corrupt
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:48.800]  I think it's both but what we've discovered is the giant enchilada the
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:54.880]  motherload of programs being used nationwide to shave votes we have the
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:11:00.320]  algorithm we have everything and we have them running at the voting places when
[02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:05.320]  Bev Harris shows up with the computers out the back we have the insiders we have
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:10.360]  the whistleblowers we have the we have the engineers it's called fractal magic
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:14.200]  digital version now that's the name of the video they released this morning she
[02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:19.280]  gave it to us is exclusive it's powerful but what what viral was how
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:22.600]  America's elections are hacked as missing link discovered now we're gonna put
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:25.600]  out more videos and more articles with the interview we just did with her last
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:34.320]  hour and what we're seeing is massive key to systematic election fraud
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:38.680]  discovered and and then I brought up Soros she goes yes the company he's
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:43.240]  connected to through his operatives is the one that's already admitted to using
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:49.120]  this program that's not even in their video it's like oh my god and then she
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:54.880]  named where they caught him I mean this is so biblical right now okay and people
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:58.160]  know I don't get excited unless I've never been this blown away except maybe
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:04.120]  when Matt Rudge visited her I don't know I mean this is crazy and and all this is
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:09.000]  coming out on Hillary she's in full panic mode I want to get a true omnibudsman
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.560]  of libertarian movement not the current head of it who's basically Trump took
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:16.520]  over the Republican Party the globalist took over the libertarian party my view
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:20.160]  not trying to back libertarians but if that's libertarian that warmonger vice
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:23.960]  president he's got I'm an Easter Bunny but the point is is Trump's the populace
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:28.240]  he's the nationalist he's got him scared this is such a key time for America and
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:32.280]  even if they steal it folks and Bev Harris said Trump is really gonna win the
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:36.320]  evidence but but Hillary is gonna steal it she's a big Democrat folks and she
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:39.920]  said you heard her on there she basically broke with all of this was so bad
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:45.320]  she's the one that exposed Bush she's got the ultimate credibility Lou Rockwell
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:50.440]  I am breathless here my friend I'm I'm glad you're here because I mean this is
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:55.640]  just like I mean it's wonderful we're exposing it so it's just like I just had
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:59.520]  another child but it's also like somebody in the family died as we learn it's
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:05.160]  worse than we thought I mean this is incredible well Alex Bev Harris is a
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:10.240]  is a heroine just like you're a hero and it's great to have this material out
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:15.000]  there I don't know how new what this is in American history after all LBJ stole
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:20.040]  its Senate seat and even killed somebody in the process Mayor Daly in
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:25.560]  Chicago stole the 1960 election for JFK I mean there are many instances in
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:29.520]  American history of vote stealing but probably this is thanks to the money of
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:35.520]  in the evil of George Soros this is a more systematic more sophisticated but
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:38.880]  I think you're exactly right if Trump quote-unquote loses and how right he is
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:45.160]  to say he's not going to concede until he sees how crooked the thing is you know
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:50.520]  this is this is this is trouble for the regime it's trouble for the power elite
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:56.040]  it's trouble for the globalists because L over the majority of Americans are
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:14:01.960]  going to see it stolen this could bring about a revolution so who knows who knows
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:05.840]  whether they will carry out the theft if he gets a big enough vote which I
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:09.800]  think he's going to get I think this is gonna be a landslide for Trump if it's
[02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:15.520]  honest yes I will continue with your great points because you didn't hear
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:18.160]  let me just be clear she said and she's not a hype driven person as you know
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:22.360]  she's a true heroine she said this dwarfs anything she's ever done it's the
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:25.800]  key to everything like the janitor's key they're using it everywhere they had
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:30.640]  when she says it on video they crap their pants and start running we have
[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:35.320]  discovered like you said the systematic ring of Mordor basically we have
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:39.040]  discovered the Dark Lord's ring they've had lots of other little corruptions and
[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:44.640]  stealing and murders and ballot stuffing and dead people voting this is the this
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:48.400]  is it I mean this is the Excalibur of Evil when it comes to stealing elections
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:51.880]  and the fact that she saved this until the October surprise or November
[02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:55.080]  surprise this is going to be a game changer I think because as you said if
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:59.080]  they steal it it only blows up in their face harder please continue well I also
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:03.160]  think that there's some very interesting sort of deep state stuff going on I
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:07.720]  think that there are people within the deep state who for whatever reason I
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:11.760]  don't have decided they don't want Hillary my guess is the reason is because
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:16.360]  even these people don't want a nuclear war with Russia so I think
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:21.200]  that's I think even within the deep state there are factions that are
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:27.960]  pro-Trump not because they like him otherwise sorry I'm just I'm just so
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:31.880]  absolutely current generals former generals Flynn expose how the government's
[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:36.800]  running al-Qaeda and running ISIS he's a total patriot I mean the good men and
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:40.040]  women are standing up this is an epic battle please how would you describe
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:44.320]  as a historian as well Le Rockwell Le Rockwell dot-com how would you describe
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:48.080]  this moment in history this next seven days well I think we know there's never
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:51.840]  been an election like this I must say there's never been an election this much
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:57.160]  fun either yes it's tremendous fun that helps everybody focus on it it's
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:01.080]  important that everybody focus on exactly what's happening we can't count out
[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:06.920]  the Hillary forces for trying something else but I think the James Comey
[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:12.080]  statement indicates there's important opposition to her her to her even within
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:18.120]  the regime so this is hot I my guess is Trump is going to win but again if they
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:23.280]  steal it from him they don't win we the people win because there's going to be
[02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:29.000]  an uprising and I don't mean a violent uprising but a popular uprising a
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:36.440]  mental uprising an uprising of ideas thanks to people like you Alex and I
[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:41.440]  think this is this is a great time for America I just I think it's going to be
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:45.440]  thrilling but we have to watch we know all the instances of vote flipping in
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:50.240]  Texas and all the corruption in other states George Soros is also behind all
[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:54.680]  the immigration this is another thing that's going for Hillary they're wanting
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:58.600]  to register all the illegals and have them vote the straight Democratic ticket
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:03.000]  to what extent they get away with that I don't know that's that's their intention
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.680]  have there been enough illegals brought in so that they win just on those
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:12.760]  grounds we can certainly hope not but this is definitely a historic moment
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:18.160]  it's a great moment it's a fun moment and we just have to all work harder fight
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:23.520]  harder expose these creeps like you do every day and that's the most powerful
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:27.800]  weapon we can have we have to take away their legitimacy it's why they were so
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:32.000]  worried when Trump said he would not concede the election because they're
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.120]  they're a minority the people who rule us our minority we the people are the
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:40.760]  majority they have to have our consent to the extent of they lose our consent
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:45.880]  they crumble like the statue of Osamandias in the desert so this is
[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:51.080]  this is what's at stake I think they've lost already legitimacy among a huge
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:56.560]  number of Americans if they steal this election everything is up for grabs and
[02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:00.200]  I don't think that I don't think Hillary can actually win as you pointed out in
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:05.200]  the long term even if she's brought into the White House on a stretcher however
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:11.320]  however they'll have to do it she doesn't win either Trump wins the election or
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:17.520]  he wins the battle for hearts and minds as soon as she's as soon as she's an
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:22.000]  awkward rock well you hit the heart of everything they make politics boring and
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.080]  dry and ugly to make everybody tune out of it to make us hopeless Trump by being
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:29.920]  the the bull in a China cabinet who at least had the instinct for nationalism
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:34.560]  and not that World War three being pillory being demonized drew out the
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:39.840]  rigging showed how the system is unified and now it's turned politics into
[02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:43.440]  something interesting again because now it's real like the muck-rigging and now
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:47.600]  people who were never involved are coming in and it's scaring the daylights
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:52.640]  out of the elite Alex is exactly right that's in fact the neo-cons have always
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:56.320]  emphasized that they don't quite put it in these terms of that again that

[02:24:23.080 --> 02:24:26.800]  didn't know he's having press conference tomorrow I just learned about it you
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:30.960]  know Lou Rockwell that's the thing here the controlled left the controlled right
[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:35.640]  they think we're all command and control because the email show how command and
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:39.720]  control they are with Hillary and a few aides running the New York Times the
[02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:46.800]  Washington Post telling CNN MSNBC having their articles and stories
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:50.520]  approved I'm a guy with 50 something crew members but only like 30 of her in

[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:06.640]  billions well it shows you why the government's as effective as it is you
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:10.040]  know it looks like to get something done in the Hillary campaign they had to go
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:14.520]  through like 11 levels of approval with all these various people having their
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:18.480]  own views it's just no wonder it's no wonder takes them so long to respond
[02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:26.960]  for example whereas Trump just says it so it's it's it's it's a fun it's if
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:31.080]  these emails are all of course they've been just hugely successful and I can't
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:34.600]  wait for the next ones to come out that a sign just said we'll put Hillary in
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:39.400]  jail but already we've learned so much and we've learned how they operate how
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:43.680]  much they hate the Catholic Church how much they want to bring immigrants in
[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:48.440]  and make Americans a minority in their own country all the rest of the horrible
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:51.560]  plans that they have to think black people are dumb how they think poor
[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:56.120]  people are dumb just a really hateful group of people they're hate filled
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:00.480]  they're arrogant elitists they hate the guts of the regular Americans by the way
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:03.920]  you always said that that's what you always say they hate common people they
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:06.880]  hate workers they don't want to make you rich and you I guess you were in
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:10.840]  Washington you knew because everything in WikiLeaks sounds like the refrain of
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:14.960]  what Lou Rockwell has been warning about for 40 years well this is the way
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:19.160]  these people are and if you visit Washington where they even walk
[02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:23.640]  arrogantly I mean every there the arrogance as you well a regular person
[02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:27.560]  can't believe the arrogance of dealing with anybody not only in the government
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:32.480]  but all the various agencies and companies that go around that hover
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:36.520]  around the government like flies around the garbage why is arrogance the ether
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:41.360]  in which they swim well I think because they're evil and because of course first
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:44.560]  of all they but this is true of everybody in the Washington area they
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:47.960]  believe themselves to be the most important people on earth the most
[02:26:47.960 --> 02:26:51.840]  powerful the most significant the smartest exceptional and they had the
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:56.280]  right to live you know high on the hog off the off the rest of us that's what
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:26:59.720]  Putin was saying stop thinking you're better than everybody and he was talking
[02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:03.800]  about America he was talking about our elite that's right and it's the whole
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:08.240]  you know American exceptionalism that God has blessed America in a special way
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:12.960]  that we're I must say the Pilgrims had this view that we're the new Zion and
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:17.760]  the God is directing you know this is just another country it's been a very
[02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:22.760]  successful country in many ways because of our free markets and limited
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:27.520]  government those are both of course not having the biggest government that's
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:31.400]  Chris having the biggest government by the way the US government is the
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:35.920]  biggest government in the history of the world by many magnitudes and we
[02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:41.480]  desperately need to drastically cut taxes cut regulations let's talk about
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:45.520]  that well I mean as a von Mies Institute head what do you think of Trump's plan
[02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:51.200]  overall well I think I think it's it's like Trump himself it's it's mixed so
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:57.200]  his basic economic plan drastically cut taxes cut regulations make it better for
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:02.760]  business people in this country the Lord is is all great stuff I think it's
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:06.640]  very good to get rid of these trade deals which are miss misnamed as free
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:12.960]  trade I don't I'm not a fan of tariffs but he is off on keeping 0% interest
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:16.760]  rates right yes and of course he's also the only one to criticize the Fed
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:20.720]  except Ron Paul so it's quite a wonderful thing he's he's shown up the Fed
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:25.200]  he's talked about that this is a bubble economy we've got economic troubles
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:28.200]  ahead of course because of all the what is he right about 90% of the time
[02:28:28.200 --> 02:28:31.840]  Hillary's wrong 100% I mean that's a big difference well Hillary's real Hillary
[02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:36.920]  is wrong and evil 100% of the time in every single way he's right much of the
[02:28:36.920 --> 02:28:41.960]  time but just the fact that he won't start World War 3 even during the height
[02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:46.760]  of the Cold War both powers were both America and the Soviet Union were
[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:50.840]  careful never to risk a nuclear war neither one of them actually wanted I
[02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:54.240]  agree they said experts say we're at the highest threat ever why would our
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:59.040]  current elite want to do that well I think the neocons are I've got a crazy
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:03.840]  gene I think if we can sort of think of the but the this is a very simplistic
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:09.520]  model but think of the Rockefeller wing and the neocon wing the Rockefellers as
[02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:13.440]  bad as they are and I'm using that again as a cover word for a very
[02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:17.920]  variegated and large group they they don't actually want the end of the
[02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:21.520]  world I don't think that even the neocons want the end of the world but
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:25.520]  they believe that their power is so great that they can threaten the only two
[02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:29.280]  countries that still have any significant independence in our our major
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:34.080]  powers that is Russia and China and bring them to heal they can turn Russia and
[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:39.760]  China into in effect colonies of the US those countries are not going to allow
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:42.720]  that to happen that's right we rock well stay there they are we got a little
[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:44.960]  break we'll come back and examine that more straight ahead

[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:13.920]  obama talking to hillary uh and and you know they're saying we've got to cover
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:15.840]  up these pen names these pseudonyms
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:20.560]  these uh gnome de plumes uh you that's all open and shut prison time
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:23.920]  uh getting back into world war three in a moment
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:26.960]  and why all the experts agrees the greatest danger now and you tend to
[02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:30.160]  keep going back there so do i so i want to hear your historical view on that
[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:34.800]  just on the wiki leaks and this load of evil and more and more coming out
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:38.960]  and a son saying something's coming soon that she'll have to pardon herself
[02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:45.760]  uh you know is her only hope i mean this is so epic i'm pinching myself
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:50.080]  i hope that trump gives gives assigned the presidential medal of freedom yes
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:53.280]  because this guy is a hero he's a hero to the whole world
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:57.840]  not just to us he really is what an extraordinary thing he's done
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:01.920]  telling us the truth about the insiders what they're actually doing all the
[02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:05.520]  stuff we're never supposed to know uh alex i just wanted to quickly mention
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:08.880]  one particular example of election theft that i think will interest
[02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:13.760]  your your your viewers your magnificently large number of viewers
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:18.800]  in 1974 ron paul won a special election to congress which nobody expected
[02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:22.560]  so 1976 they stole his first election from him
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:25.840]  and it was the old-fashioned way but you had dead people voting
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:30.160]  uh you had the people registered at golf gas stations public libraries
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:34.480]  my favorite was a guy registered at the uh houston astrodome
[02:41:34.480 --> 02:41:39.200]  so they they they stole the election tipponeal approved it and was laughing
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:43.040]  about it when there was an appeal made to the house of representatives
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:46.560]  but ron paul made sure it didn't happen the next time because he mobilized all
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:51.680]  his troops uh so it is possible to undo this stuff
[02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:55.440]  everybody has to be so vigilant your idea about wearing a red shirt to the
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:58.800]  polls is great they won't you know they tend not to let you wear
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:02.640]  the name of a candidate in the polling place but a red shirt they can't keep
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:06.240]  you from doing that and everybody has to be really their own
[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:13.040]  um voter um expert their own voter watchdog if you see anything funny
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:16.640]  there'll be numbers to call to report it you have to report it
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:19.920]  you have to protest it you have to just not be a sheep
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:23.600]  one of the sheep that they want you to be but i think really americans have
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:26.960]  awakened and and i also think in this we have to
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:29.840]  credit ron paul for this this is the man who's done it
[02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:32.640]  so many americans now understand that these wars
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:36.720]  are just a fraudulent phony destructive monstrous
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:41.680]  evil and now threatened to end the world threatened to end human life on earth
[02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:45.360]  can anybody like hillary clinton you know they talk about trump not being
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:49.520]  trusted with the nuclear codes i mean hillary clinton is
[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:53.520]  is evil and maybe she's got a crazy gene too as well
[02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:57.280]  certainly she's subjected to the people who do have crazy genes
[02:42:57.280 --> 02:43:01.040]  she can't be allowed anywhere near and i think as you pointed out
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:04.880]  people in the pentagon feel this obviously people in the fb i feel it
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:08.480]  it's quite a wonderful thing to see these factions breaking out
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:13.040]  it's a great step for liberty really this is an exciting time to be alive and
[02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:16.160]  we all need to throw in watch your show alex
[02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:20.160]  we all need to be activists we all need to read the right things
[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:24.000]  watch the right things it's really a tremendous time to be alive
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.600]  we we we have the opportunity to change this country
[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:31.840]  and i must say i've always thought that it would happen quickly and unexpectedly
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:35.360]  that's exactly what's happened trump was not supposed to win
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:38.160]  it's all he's he's talking about many great issues
[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:42.480]  all the immigration that uh bringing in specifically you know anti christian
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:46.400]  uh refugees not every there are plenty of the legal immigrants who are a
[02:43:46.400 --> 02:43:48.880]  problem too there's too much immigration
[02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:52.240]  certainly too much illegal immigration well too much free stuff and that draws
[02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:54.240]  the wrong people and so let me ask you this question
[02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:58.000]  you're as far far better welfare than any american can ever get by the way
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:01.840]  given to these theorems they live high on the hog at the expense of
[02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:05.520]  the rest of us and as that poor woman who was beaten up the homeless woman
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:08.960]  beaten up uh in hollywood the other day for trying to protect
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:12.880]  trump's star for being further brutalized um
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:16.080]  she said isn't it funny that we have 20 million illegals in this country and
[02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:19.520]  yet americans are sleeping in the street well it's true
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:23.440]  so maybe something's going to be done about it this is our chance
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:26.720]  how what a thrilling time to be alive this is the kind of thing you're going
[02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:29.840]  to tell your grandchildren about your great grandchildren if you're
[02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:33.360]  lucky to live that long uh this is a tremendous opportunity for
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:36.400]  patriotic americans i totally agree alex thank you for
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:40.080]  leading thanks for leading the fight oh listen are you kidding lou i only
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:42.560]  talk about how successful the broadcast is
[02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:46.320]  is it so that people understand liberty is popular i know i'm like a surfer on a
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:49.760]  big wave at hawaii i'm not the wave like ron paul always
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:52.800]  said i'm just a focal point a much greater scholar and patriot that i am
[02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:55.520]  and i respect you you know with a greater intellect than i have
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:59.360]  i'm just somebody when bev harris was on earlier i said you know when you're
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:02.560]  mentioning all this is showing documentation i feel like i can't breathe
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:05.920]  i've been robbed i'm pissed off she said you know it's funny alex
[02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:09.280]  she said i really shared it but that's how i feel when i discover this
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:13.840]  is that i can't help it i want to fight them i want to you know make it better
[02:45:13.840 --> 02:45:16.960]  i want to resist it and i think that's what separates you and i and others and
[02:45:16.960 --> 02:45:21.200]  majority of people from the controllers they really are out to get people they
[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:24.320]  really are nasty folks like you've always seen but getting back to history
[02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:27.280]  because you keep going to this you're absolutely right the reason all the
[02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:30.160]  major historians when i say all i mean it's all over the news
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:32.880]  and and analysts say the world's in the greatest danger ever
[02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:37.120]  is we see trends in the world and elites that finally get back into a corner
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:40.240]  historically they always start a war that's why you keep warning
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:43.040]  and we've now reached a point where they're all back into a corner
[02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:46.720]  they're trying to start wars they're saying they want a war
[02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:51.040]  but the generals even go to congress and say that'll require going to war with
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:55.040]  russia and syria that'll require going to war with russia and europe if we
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:59.440]  send in troops into ukraine when clearly soros started it so
[02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:03.200]  the reason we keep going back to nukes is we're winning you're right we're not
[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:08.000]  going to lose now culturally that wavelength has been ignited
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:11.760]  but the problem is you're right they're going to go the hitler route
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:15.120]  when he thinks he's losing in in europe and go into russia or they're going to
[02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:18.160]  go the you know napoleon route they seem to always
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:21.600]  double down so how do we stop them
[02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:25.200]  well i think and then this is not just those guys the fdr did it
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:28.080]  in world war two wilson did it in world war one
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:32.800]  lincoln did it in the civil war this is this is not exactly an unusual thing
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:37.520]  but i think the way we stop it is knowledge and uh people being dedicated
[02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:41.360]  to changing things so i think more and more people know more
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:45.120]  they're more and more skeptical of the regime they don't believe the elites
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:49.040]  they don't believe the media this is a great development it's been you know
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:52.960]  we see it even in the polls we certainly see it in the people we know
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:56.240]  people we talk to you certainly know it i know it
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:46:59.600]  more and more people are understanding they're being ripped off
[02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:03.760]  and it's so important to understand proper economics real history
[02:47:03.760 --> 02:47:07.440]  uh political philosophy all these things are important
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:10.640]  but it's also very important for regular people to understand
[02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:15.840]  we are being ripped off they're stealing from us their parasites living off of
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:19.280]  us we have to get rid of them we have to get rid of the parasites
[02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:23.200]  we have to be free we have to in the great american tradition
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:26.800]  we have to be free men and women be responsible for ourselves
[02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:30.640]  live our own lives have freedom to to work and to
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:37.280]  profit to help to profit and to help other people by
[02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:40.720]  producing products and ideas that they would like to consume
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:44.240]  this is the many great people in this country many great business people
[02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:47.840]  many great activists we have not lost and really i think
[02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:52.000]  for the first time in my lifetime i see us winning we really are
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:56.080]  moving forward in just the most tremendous and exciting fashion
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:59.680]  i think it's uh i think it's very thrilling
[02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:04.000]  and we have to keep it going i agree two points two points
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:08.480]  you know as as constitutionalist as free marketers as as i mean i would call
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:11.280]  myself an austrian uh you know economics follower because it makes
[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:13.200]  total sense i read it it's what i see in the real
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:16.800]  world it's not all this you know fantasy fake academic stuff
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:21.680]  it's it's real history it's it's it's veritas and it talks about
[02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:24.640]  we're not into consumer goods because we worship them
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:28.720]  it's the true market of ideas that then allows human expression
[02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:31.920]  and true diversity if you can speak to that briefly and then
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:35.200]  you also are getting into the fact that you you always thought it would come
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:40.560]  suddenly and i agree i now am sure we're in the beginning phase of a total
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:44.640]  revolution against tyranny it's explosive it's powerful
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:48.160]  it's seismic nothing has ever been seen like this before
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:52.720]  and so so strap yourselves in can you speak to those two points
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:56.480]  well i think first of all if you visit washington and it's it's
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:48:59.520]  i must say i don't like visiting washington but one of the great things
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:03.120]  about being there as you can see the suburbs around washington
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:06.960]  are the richest places in this country mansions limos
[02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:10.960]  fanciest stores and restaurants nothing wrong with that stuff if it's produced
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:14.160]  through the market this is all produced by theft
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:18.160]  by parasitism so these people are and at the meantime
[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:21.120]  they're living like kings and they're telling us don't be interested in
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:24.960]  consumer goods don't be materialistic we know there's nothing wrong
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:28.000]  with wanting a better life for yourself and for your family
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:31.280]  to have better resources to support your church
[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:34.480]  uh important charities produces well for everybody
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:38.240]  well of course this is this of course this is civilization
[02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:42.160]  civilization is brought about by private property and by free markets
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:46.080]  and to the extent we fight for those principles we're fighting for civilization
[02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:49.120]  also we're fighting for civilization if we're opposing hillary
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:53.680]  she threatens human civilization she threatens not just human flourishing
[02:49:53.680 --> 02:49:57.360]  but which we always have to be concerned about she threatens the very future of
[02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:00.480]  the human race let's get into that because exactly before her
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:04.000]  why why are they like a moth of flame going towards war when you can't do it
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:08.480]  now with nuclear weapons well she's a she's unbelievably arrogant
[02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:12.240]  and she probably would not start out although a lot of these people
[02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:16.000]  i remember back to herman kahn's awful book called thinking the unthinkable
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:21.040]  published in the 60s when he had one of the original neocons when he advocated
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:25.440]  using first the first use the regular first use of nuclear weapons by the
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:30.240]  us to gain world control Bertrand Russell did it as a liberal way to end war
[02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:35.040]  well that's so this is that would end war would end everything else too
[02:50:35.040 --> 02:50:39.840]  so we you know these these bombs are capable of uh you know watch some of the
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:44.160]  great andy war movies dr strangelove seven days in may
[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:47.760]  um oh by the way they created the doomsday weapons the russians we have
[02:50:47.760 --> 02:50:51.280]  them too they're classified of the the satan twos what the west calls it
[02:50:51.280 --> 02:50:55.680]  they now have hundreds of icbms that can hit us in about five minutes
[02:50:55.680 --> 02:51:01.200]  that have 14 40 megaton warheads that would destroy texas or france one
[02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:04.320]  missile no it's true it's it's horrific these
[02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:08.000]  things are of course evil i would say immoral
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:12.480]  because they're definitely targeted at civilians even within the code of war
[02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:15.920]  you can't go after civilians deliberately though of course the u.s
[02:51:15.920 --> 02:51:20.160]  has always done that on a massive scale uh so many other countries of course
[02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:24.000]  have as well so it's notice how the pentagon calls it satan two when russia
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:25.920]  makes it happen to know they've partially
[02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:29.680]  declassified that we even have these in the 90s the the u.s has stuff with
[02:51:29.680 --> 02:51:33.360]  with with with 18 24 warheads some of them dummies
[02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:39.040]  that are 60 70 100 megaton even worse that's are much bigger than the the
[02:51:39.040 --> 02:51:42.320]  bombs that destroyed her herushima and agasaki
[02:51:42.320 --> 02:51:44.880]  much bigger hunters and these were called mirrored
[02:51:44.880 --> 02:51:48.240]  mirrored weapons of multiple independent reentry vehicles
[02:51:48.240 --> 02:51:51.760]  yes they this is this the typical missile in the u.s's
[02:51:51.760 --> 02:51:55.760]  arsenal and it's also that the in the submarine arsenals
[02:51:55.760 --> 02:51:59.040]  also some of the bombs that are dropped to the missiles that are dropped by the
[02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:03.760]  b 52s and other uh the the b1 the b2 bombers uh these
[02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:06.880]  things are horrific we got this close during the cuban
[02:52:06.880 --> 02:52:10.480]  missile crisis thank goodness jfk pulled back the missiles from the
[02:52:10.480 --> 02:52:13.200]  border of russia and turkey which were secret
[02:52:13.200 --> 02:52:16.960]  cruise ship pulled back the missiles from cuba we avoided the end of the world
[02:52:16.960 --> 02:52:19.200]  at that point i was about to say when i was a kid
[02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:22.880]  into the world right now if she's elected it's a you know i hope everybody's
[02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:27.120]  got a a bokeh on their backyard and it's got plenty of
[02:52:27.120 --> 02:52:31.120]  food and water in there because uh it's going to be horrific
[02:52:31.120 --> 02:52:33.760]  sure well lou i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not fit in obviously the evil
[02:52:33.760 --> 02:52:36.800]  soviet union but we became corrupt in the name of fighting it i remember one of
[02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:39.280]  my dad's uncles of course this was declassified later
[02:52:39.280 --> 02:52:43.600]  he said hell cuban missile crisis they because my cause involved that they had
[02:52:43.600 --> 02:52:48.560]  tactical and medium-range missiles in turkey only like 500 miles from russia aimed at russia
[02:52:50.160 --> 02:52:53.040]  And that's why russia went into cuba, but none of that was ever on our news
[02:52:53.760 --> 02:52:57.280]  No, and it was the jupiter missile the most powerful missile the u.s. had at that point
[02:52:57.600 --> 02:52:59.280]  They were very close
[02:52:59.280 --> 02:53:00.480]  For a first strike
[02:53:00.480 --> 02:53:07.120]  This is what this is what both sides or any side would fear on this kind of a weapons configuration a first strike
[02:53:07.120 --> 02:53:13.600]  Well first strike that is so damn it's so damaging that it makes the ability to retaliate impossible
[02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:20.480]  So this is what the russians fear. This is why they fear the u.s. troops and missiles being brought up right to the borders of russia
[02:53:21.040 --> 02:53:27.440]  I remember seeing a publisher on my site once a great meme that showed up the map of the soviet union with all the u.s
[02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:33.360]  Bases all around it and the caption was how dare they put their country in the middle of our military bases
[02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:38.240]  Yeah, let's pull that up around them. How dare russia put its country in the middle of our military bases
[02:53:38.240 --> 02:53:42.480]  Let's google that click images. I've seen that image very very powerful russia has like two or three bases
[02:53:42.480 --> 02:53:46.800]  We have hundreds and hundreds and again. This is in america. This is globalists that have hijacked our nation
[02:53:46.800 --> 02:53:50.240]  They're doing this and look at briggs it look at russia getting out of globalism
[02:53:50.480 --> 02:53:57.440]  I mean aren't we seeing the rebirth of what i'd call 1776 against far-off empires, you know the modern king george the thirds
[02:53:57.440 --> 02:54:03.280]  Absolutely, and we're seeing this as you say in in all not only in britain all across europe
[02:54:03.760 --> 02:54:06.720]  Uh, I think the the tide is moving in our direction
[02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:12.880]  That's where we have to fear somebody like uh, hillary who's controlled by george soros and people like him
[02:54:13.360 --> 02:54:17.600]  Uh, a total warmonger sometimes. I wonder if these very elderly guys
[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:24.560]  I'm not criticizing elderly people obviously in general, but some of these very elderly guys like soros like hendry kissinger
[02:54:24.560 --> 02:54:27.120]  Or like david rockefeller
[02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:29.120]  Uh, these are evil men
[02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:32.800]  Sometimes evil people would like to bring the whole world down around them as they're dying
[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:36.080]  I was interviewing a famous libertarian about a week before he died
[02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:39.520]  I didn't know he was about to die and all of a sudden he sounded crazy on air and he was like
[02:54:39.680 --> 02:54:42.560]  We should just have riots and attack and I was like are you okay?
[02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:46.240]  I learned he was in the hospital, you know after I you know got on the phone with him during a break
[02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:50.240]  So so even people that are peaceniks when they're about to die kind of get delusional sometimes
[02:54:50.240 --> 02:54:56.880]  Well, uh, I think we have to fear soros fear david rockefeller fear hendry kissinger
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:04.720]  Feel heim saban all these people who are the oligarchs the coax all these people would like who think they should run us
[02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:09.840]  We have no right to run our own lives run our own communities our own businesses our own charities
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:14.240]  No, we don't have it. They have the right to rule us. This is an inhuman thing
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:18.880]  No regular person wants to rule the town next door a little on the country next door
[02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:24.800]  I was about to say my neighbors are doing what they want household next door. No, we have enough trouble running our own lives
[02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:29.360]  So that's the proper way to do it. It's the libertarian way. It's the american way
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:38.400]  Um, but we have these very dangerous opponents. This is why this is you know, they always say this is the most significant election of our lifetime
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:45.440]  They say it with romney and mckinney meldy. This is this is really this really is this is this is a very significant time
[02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:49.760]  They're going to try to steal it as bue and bev harris point out
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:52.320]  Um, we don't have to let it happen
[02:55:52.320 --> 02:55:58.640]  But even if they do succeed in stealing it it does not mean it's over with because there's going to be a peaceful
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:01.680]  popular revolution in this country for freedom
[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:04.240]  Oh, I agree. I mean even mainline

[03:00:33.680 --> 03:00:35.680]  I know what side I want to be on
[03:00:37.200 --> 03:00:41.600]  They study history god tends to use people a lot of times and aren't uh the sweetest

[03:00:44.240 --> 03:00:46.240]  And I'm certainly not one of those but
[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:48.400]  I'll tell you one thing. I don't like con artists
[03:00:49.200 --> 03:00:51.200]  I don't like people to hurt children
[03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:53.200]  And I got so mad saturday
[03:00:54.400 --> 03:00:58.640]  That I was mad all the way through sunday and I had to really pray about it last night and just ask god for peace again
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:02.240]  because I'd had peace for about a week or two and uh
[03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:04.960]  It was really helping me get a lot more done
[03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:08.560]  But I saw big LA times article
[03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:15.920]  With the headline that oh my gosh a huge mystery hundreds of kids are being paralyzed and nobody knows why the vaccine insert
[03:01:15.920 --> 03:01:19.920]  Says it causes that in a certain percentage
[03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:26.240]  Her toddler suddenly paralyzed mother tries to solve a vexing medical mystery they change it after we started covering it
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:28.240]  This is weird that the headline was
[03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:32.320]  You know mystery medical mystery is hundreds of children paralyzed
[03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:36.320]  And what happens is
[03:01:36.640 --> 03:01:42.960]  They get gion beret is one name of one neurological disorder that just list a bunch of different spectrums of this
[03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:49.200]  And folks david night and rob doing myself have interviewed the nurses and the doctors
[03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:55.760]  And sometimes at night I go through the tip boxes for like an hours when I don't have the time
[03:01:56.480 --> 03:02:01.600]  And my kids are in the room next to me wanting to see me because I feel so guilty and it's not because I'm some goody tissues
[03:02:01.920 --> 03:02:03.520]  I literally
[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:05.520]  Get feelings of burning
[03:02:06.240 --> 03:02:10.400]  Angry nasty guilt. I mean I feel dirty. I feel evil
[03:02:10.400 --> 03:02:16.480]  Uh when I can't get the word out and defeat these people people think see I'm the opposite of a power
[03:02:16.480 --> 03:02:20.960]  People need to know I am burning sometimes with nausea to fight these people
[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:24.480]  Like a like a pit bull on a chain is
[03:02:25.600 --> 03:02:28.480]  Because I can't stop them and they're like, well, my gosh, you're such a scrape. No
[03:02:29.120 --> 03:02:34.640]  I know they're giving kids shots now hundreds of them. We've gone from one and thirty something thousand to one and fifty eight
[03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:38.800]  South korea is like one and thirty something. There's retarded kids everywhere. Don't use the word retarded
[03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:41.920]  I'll use the word retarded. You're the ones covering up for them being brain damaged
[03:02:44.240 --> 03:02:49.280]  And they've got polio like illness paralyzing children all across the u.s. They're testing soft kills
[03:02:49.840 --> 03:02:51.840]  I told you this 15 years ago
[03:02:52.240 --> 03:02:59.520]  About billa millen gates foundation the vaccines they give and then the kids all get paralyzed sometimes 60 000 a year in places like india alone
[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:03.120]  It's okay that you can't walk now son
[03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:07.040]  The doctors won't tell us but they're good. So we you know, we trust them
[03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:09.440]  Then they go to the child development center to the state
[03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:14.880]  You know, they came up with the 223 with the 556 in vietnam and the colt m16
[03:03:16.160 --> 03:03:19.440]  Because they couldn't have a full metal a soft tipped
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:23.680]  Under the zebra convention bullet. What a joke. You can't shoot bullets to kill people
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:28.720]  Or maim them any personnel weapons
[03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:35.200]  So they did the 223 556 because it's so high velocity it breaks up and actually has a fragmentation effect
[03:03:35.200 --> 03:03:37.200]  that's the big secret about it
[03:03:38.240 --> 03:03:39.680]  and
[03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:41.280]  I personally if you're not too far away
[03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:46.080]  I can take down elk better with a with a 223 or 556 and I came with a seven mag or you name it
[03:03:47.280 --> 03:03:49.440]  And I've shot elk with seven mags. I've shot them with
[03:03:49.920 --> 03:03:53.760]  500 smiths and western handguns, you know, and I'm telling you two to three of your closest better
[03:03:54.160 --> 03:03:56.160]  But but I'm digressing
[03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:01.280]  It's the same thing it's an anti personnel weapon
[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:08.640]  Vaccines are a soft kill anti personnel weapon folks. That's not my opinion. I am completely weaponized in this whole thing
[03:04:08.720 --> 03:04:10.720]  All I do is track the enemy
[03:04:10.720 --> 03:04:14.240]  Okay, I know everything they're up to basically when I say everything everything that's public
[03:04:14.320 --> 03:04:20.480]  I'm on it because they do the same couple hundred things over and over again. I basically know all their programs and
[03:04:21.840 --> 03:04:26.800]  You understand the level of anger I have because I have children and I have empathy for my children
[03:04:26.880 --> 03:04:28.880]  So means I have empathy for your kids
[03:04:28.880 --> 03:04:33.360]  Just like I saw some guy beating a woman up in the parking lot. I'm gonna go stop them because I have empathy. I'm not a hero
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:35.760]  I have instincts. I'm going to stop them
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:39.120]  and
[03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:42.640]  I've just somehow got to learn I care too much. Yeah, I see the public doesn't care at all
[03:04:42.800 --> 03:04:47.120]  I care too much because I get so angry when I see the LA Times and everybody else going
[03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:53.920]  Seeing in G school just started suddenly tens of thousands of kid nationwide hundreds in LA are paralyzed
[03:04:53.920 --> 03:04:58.960]  What happened the frickin demon insert says that you murdering felt, you know what you did
[03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:03.040]  Well, it's good that families are brought together by something, right?
[03:05:03.120 --> 03:05:09.280]  Well, a former assistant FBI director says that the clintons are brought together by crime. They're a crime family
[03:05:09.360 --> 03:05:14.240]  It's like organized crime. I mean the clinton foundation is a cesspool. This article is up on our website
[03:05:14.240 --> 03:05:21.040]  It's written by steve watson and it highlights how the former assistant FBI director slams hillary clinton and her foundation
[03:05:21.040 --> 03:05:27.200]  Calling it a cesspool and that the family is like an organized crime syndicate now appearing on a radio show this week
[03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:31.840]  The FBI it's known is reopening the case of hillary clinton and her home bruce server
[03:05:32.080 --> 03:05:37.360]  James cowstrom made these remarks while praising donald trump as a good human being and a patriot
[03:05:37.520 --> 03:05:43.200]  He goes on to say the clinton's that's a crime family basically and he's a 27 year old FBI veteran
[03:05:43.360 --> 03:05:48.240]  He says it's like organized crime. I mean the clinton foundation is a cesspool god forbid
[03:05:48.240 --> 03:05:53.120]  We put someone like that in the white house. Of course. He's referring to hillary clinton. Yes, god forbid

[03:08:22.080 --> 03:08:24.480]  So i was spending time this weekend with family
[03:08:24.480 --> 03:08:30.240]  And i went to rogerport dot com and i saw a link to this article
[03:08:30.800 --> 03:08:34.400]  Her toddler suddenly paralyzed mother tries to solve a vexing medical mystery
[03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:40.960]  And they changed the headline on sunday on saturday. It was medical. We even have a screenshot of it rob do edited a video piece
[03:08:40.960 --> 03:08:41.840]  I
[03:08:41.840 --> 03:08:43.600]  Shot it we uploaded it to him
[03:08:43.600 --> 03:08:48.000]  And he got it out because even when i'm off i have a camera person following me around now. That's how hard we're fighting
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:50.240]  I'm not complaining. I mean you can't drag me away from this
[03:08:50.240 --> 03:08:55.200]  I was foving at the mouth actually saturday and sunday working like 10 hours a day on top of regular stuff
[03:08:55.200 --> 03:08:57.200]  And i just can't stop i mean i
[03:08:57.520 --> 03:09:00.320]  I know the inserts say it causes kids to be paralyzed
[03:09:00.640 --> 03:09:06.800]  I know it causes cancer neurological disorders type 1 diabetes because it eats your pancreas. It says can cause pancreatitis diabetes
[03:09:07.600 --> 03:09:12.400]  Flu shot temp hepatitis shot all of them say it. I know this i've got the inserts
[03:09:12.480 --> 03:09:16.720]  I've probably done a hundred special reports or more showing it to you
[03:09:16.720 --> 03:09:23.280]  And then i get angry because i uploaded one video got like half million views in a couple hours this one i did only got like 35
[03:09:23.280 --> 03:09:25.280]  Thousand views
[03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:30.880]  It needs to get a hundred million views the people involved need to you know what they need to have done to them
[03:09:32.720 --> 03:09:36.640]  How'd you know they'd like being paralyzed from the neck down surgically
[03:09:37.440 --> 03:09:39.840]  I'm not saying i want to do that because i don't want to do that to kids
[03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:43.680]  I don't want to do it to you but i got a little idea in my head that if you think it's so funny
[03:09:43.680 --> 03:09:48.720]  How about you're living out of a straw for the rest of your life?
[03:09:50.240 --> 03:09:52.240]  I got three kids rob do's got four kids
[03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:59.600]  And it flips a switch when you have kids the people that mess with kids is why the media is always just for the children manipulating us
[03:10:01.760 --> 03:10:03.760]  It makes you want to throw up they know
[03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:10.640]  Vaccines have social control. They know they've done secret testing in them. They know their secret government program giving liability protection of the companies
[03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:13.680]  The program's public but the but what they do is secret in it
[03:10:14.400 --> 03:10:16.400]  they know all this
[03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:20.560]  And they know why the kids are paralyzed. We've had the nurses on
[03:10:21.520 --> 03:10:24.480]  like I link in the report articles a year ago
[03:10:25.840 --> 03:10:28.960]  Where we have nurses and doctors on they go no that they tell us under bioethics
[03:10:28.960 --> 03:10:30.960]  We've got to give all the preemies vaccines
[03:10:31.280 --> 03:10:34.960]  And they about half of them quit breathing or die when we do within an hour or two
[03:10:34.960 --> 03:10:37.600]  So we put them on respirators so they give them a shot
[03:10:37.600 --> 03:10:42.800]  They know is making them sick to follow orders. It's like Nazis shooting Jews, but then putting them on respirators
[03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:47.920]  And then they put them on respirators to keep them alive and I'm like, we'll go public. Well, they'll fire me if I do
[03:10:48.640 --> 03:10:50.640]  This is the crazy town. So
[03:10:51.040 --> 03:10:53.040]  With everything else toxic that we've proven is bad
[03:10:53.600 --> 03:10:55.280]  this phenol a
[03:10:55.280 --> 03:10:57.040]  aspartame
[03:10:57.040 --> 03:10:58.560]  msg
[03:10:58.560 --> 03:11:00.560]  You know all the things they pulled out of food and water
[03:11:00.720 --> 03:11:07.360]  They won't do this because it's big pharma and the government in a in collaboration with an agenda to make you take
[03:11:07.360 --> 03:11:09.360]  something
[03:11:09.440 --> 03:11:12.560]  Now I'm very pleased. I had great feelings of satisfaction today
[03:11:14.160 --> 03:11:17.120]  See, I don't get satisfaction peacocking in front of a crowd getting an award
[03:11:17.120 --> 03:11:20.160]  I don't get satisfaction pulling up the coolest car at the country club
[03:11:20.240 --> 03:11:24.000]  I don't get satisfied. I get satisfaction on seeing little plants grow in my backyard and
[03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:29.520]  You know seeing my kids grow up and be strong and and and do the right thing not because I'm some goody-tooshes
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:33.040]  But because you recon land a lot of errands animal psychology
[03:11:33.040 --> 03:11:37.440]  The biggest meanest predators have the biggest sweetest sides as well to govern themselves
[03:11:37.600 --> 03:11:43.760]  It's little cowardly filth. They want to sneak around and do jackass evil against people and innocence and think that's power
[03:11:44.160 --> 03:11:47.360]  Exercising oppression against innocence. It's not because you're powerful
[03:11:47.440 --> 03:11:51.600]  It's because you're a piece of filth and we will get our metaphysical hands around your necks
[03:11:52.240 --> 03:11:55.920]  And we're very close and you can feel our fingers sliding
[03:11:56.960 --> 03:11:58.960]  lovingly around your throats right now
[03:11:59.600 --> 03:12:00.720]  like
[03:12:00.720 --> 03:12:02.960]  Moby dick with captain ahab
[03:12:04.080 --> 03:12:08.800]  Who are you? You're going to the bottom. You're going down 10,000 feet. You want to dive?
[03:12:09.360 --> 03:12:12.000]  You want to play the game? We're going down now
[03:12:13.120 --> 03:12:18.080]  And you I can feel the outcry of the maimed children. They're on respirators all over the country
[03:12:18.240 --> 03:12:24.960]  They're dying every day all over the country. I I know they pack the del children's facility every year when the shots start before school
[03:12:26.240 --> 03:12:28.240]  in in in the you know
[03:12:28.240 --> 03:12:33.920]  Pre kindergarten or grade the third three and four year olds. They give them they give them
[03:12:34.720 --> 03:12:38.880]  The the shots and then it causes them to have pancreatitis and they lose their pancreas
[03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:42.400]  So suddenly they tell them oh, it's genetic. You have type 1 diabetes
[03:12:46.240 --> 03:12:51.040]  They're just hitting them and hitting them hard and they know full well what they're doing with pleasure
[03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:56.480]  And they go there's a mystery why there's so many autistic now there's a mystery while you're paralyzed
[03:12:56.480 --> 03:13:01.920]  Oh, we didn't get your brain. You're still talking too bad. He can talk. We don't know what that is
[03:13:03.520 --> 03:13:07.120]  Now the average doctor isn't actually going ha ha ha but behind the scenes they know
[03:13:08.080 --> 03:13:11.280]  Maybe they bring these kids in and it's the vaccines that was in the
[03:13:12.560 --> 03:13:15.440]  2000 document from the cdc that came out in 2002
[03:13:16.240 --> 03:13:19.840]  Or a congressman got in trouble leaking it because his grandson was brain damaged
[03:13:21.520 --> 03:13:24.800]  I think the congressman he had to have his kid on a ventilator for a while, but but he came back
[03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:29.520]  Too bad for them. I guess too bad for the globalist. They didn't get him, you know right away
[03:13:30.720 --> 03:13:32.720]  And he he leaked it
[03:13:33.360 --> 03:13:38.240]  For the congressman's name, but it's famous abc news picked it up to their credit where they were totally controlled
[03:13:38.400 --> 03:13:43.120]  That they said I wouldn't give my grandkids or kids this we've brain damaged tens of millions and they said well
[03:13:43.200 --> 03:13:46.480]  We can't cover it up. We've just got to make sure they clean it up
[03:13:47.280 --> 03:13:49.840]  You see well, they didn't clean it up because it's on purpose
[03:13:49.840 --> 03:13:54.000]  It's on purpose just like injecting black people with syphilis at Tuskegee
[03:13:54.320 --> 03:13:59.520]  And the and the and the and the airmen being sprayed with biologicals and all the other secret testing and the radiological testing
[03:13:59.600 --> 03:14:02.960]  They killed over 3 million u.s. troops. That was time magazine last week
[03:14:04.640 --> 03:14:06.640]  They're doing it on purpose
[03:14:07.440 --> 03:14:11.840]  So let's play this little boy from the la times and say analyze their piece. Let's humanize him
[03:14:12.560 --> 03:14:18.240]  But hey, he can walk now. He got better. Yeah, they have treatments for yon beret where he could have been walking probably in a day
[03:14:18.240 --> 03:14:20.240]  Not months
[03:14:20.240 --> 03:14:24.560]  Let's see sometimes they won't even tell you what the treatment is because they've got to say it while your kid
[03:14:25.120 --> 03:14:29.680]  Gets where they can't even breathe and then have to go in a ventilator and they're all standing there at the hospital going
[03:14:30.400 --> 03:14:34.240]  Sorry, we don't know what's wrong with it. You know, you could tell them and fix them right now
[03:14:34.480 --> 03:14:39.680]  Shut up. We can't we're not the ones that gave them the shots. Uh, uh, and if the doctors tell you they're fired
[03:14:41.600 --> 03:14:44.320]  So you talk about a test for control. It's how corruption works
[03:14:44.320 --> 03:14:48.320]  You think Hillary was bad getting thousands of people involved in her illegal emails to blackmail and control people?
[03:14:48.400 --> 03:14:53.040]  Turns out that's what she was doing. She did it on purpose. They were tired of her blackmailing her. So other agencies leaked it
[03:14:53.280 --> 03:14:55.920]  This lists her general of intelligence released that info
[03:14:56.480 --> 03:14:58.480]  four years ago
[03:14:58.240 --> 03:15:00.240]  Now let's go back
[03:15:00.240 --> 03:15:04.640]  They're corrupting you all the nurses and doctors getting you in on it letting you know
[03:15:04.640 --> 03:15:09.440]  It's alright. We put them on a ventilator after get the ventilators ready. We're loving children
[03:15:09.440 --> 03:15:15.200]  We're loving children the the bad justifies the good or the good justifies the bad
[03:15:15.440 --> 03:15:20.640]  When statistically it's even worse than what it quote protects you from then the big lie that oh, you've got to take the vaccine
[03:15:20.880 --> 03:15:25.680]  Or you're hurting other people. Well, if you've had the vaccine, aren't you protected snow white?
[03:15:30.400 --> 03:15:34.640]  Gardasil has been banned in more than 30 countries last time I checked from japan to india
[03:15:34.640 --> 03:15:39.040]  Eight years before it was even approved. It was killing people right here in texas
[03:15:39.760 --> 03:15:41.760]  Where it had been approved for limited use
[03:15:42.800 --> 03:15:49.200]  I've seen hundreds of local newscasts where the young daughter at age 12 takes it and he becomes paralyzed or dies
[03:15:50.720 --> 03:15:54.000]  And in some cases their doctor even tells them the Gardasil killed your daughter
[03:15:54.560 --> 03:15:55.680]  Rob do
[03:15:55.680 --> 03:15:59.760]  You know, I guess I want to apologize though. It's it you know, because it is bad that I got upset
[03:15:59.760 --> 03:16:04.720]  I should not get upset be knowing this fact that they're just murdering kids and maiming them nationwide
[03:16:04.960 --> 03:16:10.960]  I should just accept it and let them call me conspiracy theorist over at cnn while they get their talking points from hillary
[03:16:11.280 --> 03:16:16.000]  What a bunch of snot-nosed demons. They've made their bed. They've got to sleep in it. Don't they?
[03:16:16.400 --> 03:16:22.320]  Yeah, it's really despicable the way they poison young children from from the second day. They're born
[03:16:22.640 --> 03:16:28.160]  They're trying to inject them with these toxic compounds calling it medicine and uh safe and effective
[03:16:28.160 --> 03:16:30.160]  And alex, I just want to book in what you're saying
[03:16:30.800 --> 03:16:36.400]  Back in august end of august. Here's an article prominent district attorney blames vaccines for his children's autism
[03:16:36.400 --> 03:16:39.440]  Now this is a da down in san antonio just south of us
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:44.400]  His daughter and son were both affected by vaccines after taking him
[03:16:44.480 --> 03:16:48.320]  His name is nico le hood. He went on camera to promote this vaxed movie
[03:16:48.720 --> 03:16:54.560]  But his daughter uh, his infant daughter suffered an autoimmune reaction shortly after receiving her scheduled immunizations
[03:16:54.560 --> 03:16:59.920]  And it was really bad. It was bad where I had to tie her down to sleep because she would scratch herself and start start bleeding
[03:17:00.320 --> 03:17:03.920]  And had eczema like symptoms. Does that sound like safe and effective?
[03:17:04.400 --> 03:17:08.960]  But but do do do I know they love things it's in the insert it could cause you to be paralyzed
[03:17:09.040 --> 03:17:14.080]  I know so they just go we don't know when we you've interviewed we've interviewed the nurses
[03:17:14.080 --> 03:17:16.720]  That was david night who call us more should call us
[03:17:17.120 --> 03:17:19.360]  But you should go public. It's it's all over who cares
[03:17:19.360 --> 03:17:24.640]  Exactly murder charges against the people on your bioethics board. There are a bunch of you. I'll explain something. Yeah
[03:17:25.200 --> 03:17:27.040]  People ask how this happened
[03:17:27.040 --> 03:17:33.200]  Margaret Sanger got david rockefeller's father's money in 1901 by 1910
[03:17:33.600 --> 03:17:38.240]  They had a bunch of clinics in new york targeting blacks and Puerto Ricans for whatever reason in jamaicans
[03:17:38.560 --> 03:17:41.840]  That was who they and then they had ibm involved with these first computers
[03:17:42.400 --> 03:17:47.760]  Called the hollereth machine that was like the hollereth one when the nazis used was hollereth seven through 15
[03:17:47.760 --> 03:17:48.720]  but
[03:17:48.720 --> 03:17:50.400]  Just do you there's been you know
[03:17:50.400 --> 03:17:52.320]  Pulitzer prizes give them for this folks just look it up
[03:17:52.400 --> 03:17:56.000]  This is well documented and then they they said we're going to call it liberal
[03:17:56.720 --> 03:17:59.040]  And we're going to come in and take them with their communities and pay off their preachers
[03:17:59.280 --> 03:18:02.480]  And we're going to set up these health boards and these health departments
[03:18:03.120 --> 03:18:05.760]  Claiming it's for hygiene. They called it racial hygiene
[03:18:06.480 --> 03:18:08.480]  And so they would just run around
[03:18:08.720 --> 03:18:14.320]  And they would grab the kids and take them and sterilize them or they would give them shots to sterilize them
[03:18:14.320 --> 03:18:18.800]  And then they came out with the vaccines as well and from day one. We're always putting stuff in them
[03:18:19.200 --> 03:18:23.440]  Hell I got socked others on video admitting they added cancer virus to all the polio shots
[03:18:23.840 --> 03:18:30.080]  So so my grandmother got polio one week after she was given the polio vaccine and it was the strange she was given
[03:18:30.320 --> 03:18:33.760]  I mean, this is all hidden in plain view. This isn't our first rodeo folks
[03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:37.360]  But now they're not just going to have a few million people polio
[03:18:37.440 --> 03:18:41.040]  They're going to brain damage a third of our kids every year more and again
[03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:43.680]  Just like the two two three round and let's get this break
[03:18:44.880 --> 03:18:46.880]  It's not meant to kill
[03:18:46.880 --> 03:18:49.280]  Like a full metal jacket three oh eight
[03:18:50.400 --> 03:18:54.320]  It's meant to maim and put pressure on the society to collapse it
[03:18:54.800 --> 03:19:01.440]  So they're putting pressure on childbearing where childbearing in the actuaries becomes too expensive in the overall average
[03:19:01.440 --> 03:19:09.440]  So you've got to get state help on average to raise children which brings in more vaccines more government diet more school lunch
[03:19:09.440 --> 03:19:17.680]  So they've got you in a government soft kill cancer incubator that's compartmentalized. They control silent weapons for quiet wars
[03:19:17.680 --> 03:19:20.560]  I'm giving you Pentagon document names right now ladies and gentlemen now
[03:19:21.040 --> 03:19:24.400]  You notice the government's listening to us foreign governments listen to us
[03:19:24.720 --> 03:19:28.320]  You really think russian state tv listens to us and runs clips of the show because they think i'm playing games
[03:19:28.560 --> 03:19:34.080]  Russia has banned all the gmo. They're promoting having kids. They have national tv admitting it's an anti-family program
[03:19:34.240 --> 03:19:38.640]  They've put hosts on that sound just like me and it's not because they're getting my talking points
[03:19:38.640 --> 03:19:41.520]  What i'm telling you is total truth
[03:19:41.760 --> 03:19:49.520]  We're under military attack by the eugenicists that set up the health boards that run the modern hospitals and they've all got it hidden
[03:19:51.120 --> 03:19:54.080]  I have a friend we were out on a boat about six months ago
[03:19:54.880 --> 03:19:59.360]  On his boat with his brother-in-law and his sister and his wife and my kids
[03:20:00.880 --> 03:20:03.680]  And they said we're gonna go have the kid hold on i said they're gonna take you in
[03:20:03.760 --> 03:20:06.240]  They're gonna they're gonna say you've been in labor even a few hours
[03:20:06.240 --> 03:20:08.880]  You need to take this hormone to into to induce labor
[03:20:10.720 --> 03:20:15.440]  Then they're gonna have a computer desk they're gonna ask you to take a file down the stairs or to another floor
[03:20:16.080 --> 03:20:20.000]  When you leave with the file they're gonna ask your wife if you have plenty of money or if he beats you
[03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:24.400]  That's going in the health department database to take your kids if you answer they're gonna take blood if they find any marijuana
[03:20:24.400 --> 03:20:25.760]  They're gonna take your child
[03:20:25.760 --> 03:20:29.040]  They're gonna put it with cps and i'm telling them this is gonna happen and the guys said they're both listening to me
[03:20:29.280 --> 03:20:32.240]  And i go now next what's gonna do this to her every family i run into this pregnant
[03:20:32.240 --> 03:20:37.120]  Even on the street now did it twice this weekend because i have a i have a i have a responsibility to break out of their control
[03:20:37.360 --> 03:20:41.600]  And and and break out of their system. It looks crazy to people on a trance. This is normal human activity
[03:20:41.600 --> 03:20:45.360]  I'm warning people and then i said then about four or five hours later
[03:20:45.680 --> 03:20:50.400]  There's no way your cervix i said you can google this it's gonna soften because they artificially induced it that quick
[03:20:50.880 --> 03:20:56.720]  So with 90 of the cases the baby's gonna start being delivered earlier without the cervix expanding and being softened
[03:20:57.040 --> 03:21:00.320]  That will cause then heart rate to drop within about seven eight hours on average
[03:21:00.320 --> 03:21:04.960]  Because i've had three kids i know about it just to be the first time it's not even their fault just how the system's accurate
[03:21:05.520 --> 03:21:07.520]  Actuated then once that happens
[03:21:08.400 --> 03:21:11.760]  They'll then say oh the heart rate's dropping. We got to go ahead and do a cesarean
[03:21:11.920 --> 03:21:15.360]  That's how they've gotten travis county up to 60 percent cesareans soon
[03:21:15.360 --> 03:21:22.240]  They'll say it's a conspiracy that children were ever ever vaginally born. I'm not joking when i say that we've got their dehumanization plan
[03:21:22.560 --> 03:21:25.920]  The average doctors aren't involved. They're busy overwork paying off debts
[03:21:25.920 --> 03:21:31.520]  Following the whole system following computer orders. They get through the health department through the central
[03:21:32.560 --> 03:21:37.600]  Committees of the bioethics boards and obama care globally only codifies that more
[03:21:38.960 --> 03:21:41.600]  Then your bill won't be 10,000. It'll be 60,000
[03:21:42.560 --> 03:21:44.320]  I was told
[03:21:44.320 --> 03:21:46.960]  By the brother-in-law and by the brother who's my friend he works here
[03:21:47.680 --> 03:21:49.680]  That word for word
[03:21:50.080 --> 03:21:54.880]  Exactly what i said happened exactly as i said it would in the exact order
[03:21:54.880 --> 03:21:56.880]  I've had three kids
[03:21:57.840 --> 03:22:00.720]  We broke that secretly since the 60s
[03:22:01.680 --> 03:22:03.680]  all blood
[03:22:03.520 --> 03:22:08.000]  Or late 60s is taken at birth and put in a pentagon un database
[03:22:08.880 --> 03:22:13.360]  Lawsuits were filed in travis county off our intel. It all came out was true. Ladies and gentlemen
[03:22:13.760 --> 03:22:17.920]  I told you about shaving votes. I told you about algorithms. It's all come out now bev Harris
[03:22:18.080 --> 03:22:20.880]  I told you about the federal reserve being private. That's like saying the sun's yellow
[03:22:20.880 --> 03:22:26.960]  I told you about their whole program because they think you're dumb. They write books about it
[03:22:27.360 --> 03:22:30.400]  Now bev harris a cut down interview from the bombshell today
[03:22:30.400 --> 03:22:36.880]  That's called totally viral the total proof of election fraud the biggest election fraud news ever in bev harris's own words
[03:22:37.680 --> 03:22:39.440]  The key to the whole deal
[03:22:39.440 --> 03:22:44.800]  Is coming up, but but i'm gonna hand the baton that you do it's just that i get pissed because my energy
[03:22:45.440 --> 03:22:47.440]  Is physically war
[03:22:47.440 --> 03:22:50.320]  I mean when I realized they're killing kids all around me
[03:22:51.040 --> 03:22:54.960]  Then and there's a giant scientific program against me used to get highly motivated
[03:22:55.680 --> 03:22:57.040]  Now I understand
[03:22:57.040 --> 03:23:00.080]  I'm not bragging here, but you know not everybody's family found in texas or whatever
[03:23:00.240 --> 03:23:03.840]  But the point is is i've got the genetics to resist this and I believe
[03:23:04.320 --> 03:23:09.600]  Everybody else has got the genetics to stand up against this. I mean you look at little kids getting paralyzed and killed folks
[03:23:09.680 --> 03:23:11.680]  It should motivate you to get highly aggressive
[03:23:12.320 --> 03:23:13.520]  so
[03:23:13.520 --> 03:23:15.840]  I'm proud of the fact now my kids aren't embarrassed to be on the street
[03:23:15.840 --> 03:23:19.120]  When I march up to people that are pregnant and I start telling them watch out
[03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:24.160]  They're gonna lie to you and take shots now and the good news is I talked to two pregnant women and their husbands over the week
[03:23:24.160 --> 03:23:27.760]  Yeah, then I saw and they both said you know, you're right. They told me to take the flu shot
[03:23:27.760 --> 03:23:31.280]  I know that's bad. My mom told me. Thank you. You're right. What the hell's going on?
[03:23:31.520 --> 03:23:35.840]  So the good news is do we're breaking through their comfort zone. We're breaking through their matrix
[03:23:35.920 --> 03:23:40.400]  We're breaking through them saying we're cooks where we're flopping around like walled animals on the ground
[03:23:40.480 --> 03:23:43.520]  But we're getting out of the nets man. We're it's like plant of the apes
[03:23:43.520 --> 03:23:46.320]  We're breaking out of the cages brother and I can feel it happening right now
[03:23:46.480 --> 03:23:46.960]  Exactly
[03:23:46.960 --> 03:23:50.000]  I have a same type of story a friend of mine his he was going and having a baby
[03:23:50.000 --> 03:23:54.880]  I said, hey, they're gonna come in with the mmr shot. They're gonna come in with the vitamin k and they're gonna say
[03:23:55.040 --> 03:23:57.360]  They're gonna tell you look it's safe and effective safe and effective
[03:23:57.360 --> 03:24:01.200]  They're gonna use those exact words just watch and they they came in they said oh
[03:24:01.200 --> 03:24:02.800]  I want to give them this right. He's like no we're gonna wait they go
[03:24:02.800 --> 03:24:06.480]  But it's safe and effective and he's like holy crap. You were absolutely right
[03:24:06.560 --> 03:24:11.200]  They just they come out and then they kept pushing it and pushing and pushing it and he said no and he stood up
[03:24:11.200 --> 03:24:16.080]  And now you know his kids fine by the way the first time I said no at all this and the nurses later went
[03:24:16.080 --> 03:24:18.240]  You're right. We don't do it too. We know it's hurting the kids
[03:24:18.640 --> 03:24:24.080]  We give it to the preemies and they get sick and then years later. They you know, I mean they know too. They're oppressed
[03:24:24.720 --> 03:24:25.680]  Right and it comes out
[03:24:25.680 --> 03:24:29.840]  They even know they have the ventilators ready because they know when they give the preemies these shots
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:33.680]  They start having trouble they start having autoimmune functions and it's what happens up in the brain
[03:24:33.760 --> 03:24:37.920]  We we talked to dr. Blaylock years ago about this. It's not even the physical thing
[03:24:37.920 --> 03:24:43.360]  It's like 50 bee stings to the to the preemie exactly and and so your body goes into like fighter
[03:24:43.440 --> 03:24:46.720]  It's like a bee sting this way a doctor described it as a layman term
[03:24:47.120 --> 03:24:50.880]  A regular vaccine is like a bee sting to your eight pound nine month baby that just got born
[03:24:50.880 --> 03:24:54.400]  You know nine months in the womb to a preemie. It's like 20 30 bee stings folks
[03:24:55.360 --> 03:24:58.640]  Okay, they're having an autoimmune response. They're dying in front of you my god
[03:24:58.720 --> 03:25:03.760]  It's so common sense and they know about this and they say oh the studies say everything's safe
[03:25:03.760 --> 03:25:10.560]  They've never done any studies to see the autism vaccine link. Well, they do have small level studies in foreign countries
[03:25:10.560 --> 03:25:14.880]  But never never never in countries. It's never a CDC sanction study because they won't pay for it
[03:25:14.880 --> 03:25:15.440]  Exactly
[03:25:15.440 --> 03:25:22.240]  They don't want to see this truth come out because they like this program. This is my dad wired people's jaws. Okay
[03:25:23.280 --> 03:25:31.040]  Okay, my dad was an oral surgeon wired people's jaws. He did, you know, he was he was a professor in Dallas of dental surgery
[03:25:31.600 --> 03:25:32.480]  um
[03:25:32.480 --> 03:25:35.840]  And I mean, I'm just putting you this way. He's a smart guy. He hadn't told me everything. He knows
[03:25:36.240 --> 03:25:39.200]  He told me when I was going to get my my my
[03:25:39.920 --> 03:25:42.800]  Driver's license when I was 16. He said don't sign the organ donor card
[03:25:42.800 --> 03:25:46.560]  I said why and he goes because I have to know there are hospitals where they kill people and take your organs
[03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:49.040]  And I said, what do you mean? He said just trust me
[03:25:49.280 --> 03:25:52.800]  I didn't believe my dad, but I still said no years later came on 60 minutes
[03:25:52.880 --> 03:25:58.240]  The very hospitals he mentioned in Dallas were the ones they were killing people including ones in Austin and Chicago
[03:25:58.640 --> 03:26:01.040]  Now the point is is that I didn't know at the time that
[03:26:01.040 --> 03:26:05.760]  My dad like did dental work on the CIA and all this stuff and they tried to hire him and stuff
[03:26:05.760 --> 03:26:11.040]  I didn't know all the stuff he'd seen but the point is the public needs to stop being so damn naive folks
[03:26:11.280 --> 03:26:13.600]  We have got predators running things. That's all I'm telling you
[03:26:14.240 --> 03:26:15.200]  Yeah
[03:26:15.200 --> 03:26:19.680]  And you just have to look at look at the infant mortality rate in our country compared to the rest of the world
[03:26:19.920 --> 03:26:21.760]  We're number five
[03:26:21.760 --> 03:26:26.560]  You know, turkey, mexico, chili, slovakia than the united states and then you go down
[03:26:26.560 --> 03:26:32.480]  You know, hungry's got a better infant mortality polling these places do not vaccinate their children as much
[03:26:32.880 --> 03:26:37.920]  They still have a program, but it's not nearly as much here. You can see the united states number five. That's pathetic
[03:26:38.640 --> 03:26:43.680]  That's pathetic that we've let ourselves just get drugged down. It's pathetic as the public said a tv head trance
[03:26:43.680 --> 03:26:45.680]  I don't know what's going on. I
[03:26:45.680 --> 03:26:50.320]  Held over and I've handed the time to you. I'm pretty exhausted right now folks. It's a better thing floored me

[03:29:08.240 --> 03:29:13.680]  It's it's not some devilish wish to hurt them. They're like dog crap. I don't want to put my hands on them
[03:29:13.840 --> 03:29:16.720]  I want to get them off the children. I want to get them off the innocent

[03:30:06.640 --> 03:30:13.680]  hillary clinton yet another debate question in advance one of the questions directed to hrc tomorrow is from a woman with a rash
[03:30:13.920 --> 03:30:19.680]  This article up on our website written by paul joseph watson says that a new email released by wiki leaks as a part of the
[03:30:19.680 --> 03:30:28.400]  Podesta dump reveals that former cnn commentator and current chairperson of the dnc donna brazil gave hillary clinton a major question before the debate
[03:30:28.560 --> 03:30:33.920]  One of the questions directed to hillary clinton tomorrow is from a woman with a rash the email is entitled
[03:30:33.920 --> 03:30:38.960]  It was sent on march the fifth the day before clinton debated bernie sanders in flint michigan

[03:32:12.400 --> 03:32:17.680]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces bent on global governance
[03:32:17.680 --> 03:32:22.240]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag heritage
[03:32:22.800 --> 03:32:24.400]  mom and apple pie
[03:32:24.400 --> 03:32:25.840]  God was in school

[03:32:27.840 --> 03:32:29.840]  And beef was for supper

[03:32:45.840 --> 03:32:49.280]  I want to shed some tears over the red white and blue
[03:32:49.840 --> 03:32:54.800]  revelation the movie dot info americans need to see this film
[03:32:55.440 --> 03:32:59.040]  revelation the movie dot info let's fix it
[03:33:03.840 --> 03:33:06.480]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:06.480 --> 03:33:14.880]  All right, we're back for the second half of the fourth hour of overdrive on your host rob do
[03:33:15.280 --> 03:33:20.080]  Sitting in and I want to go over a couple these articles before we play that bev harris
[03:33:20.720 --> 03:33:25.120]  A video snippet from today from the from the interview she did with alex earlier today
[03:33:25.520 --> 03:33:30.320]  Amazing interview a lot of information there too. And if you don't understand what a decimal point is
[03:33:30.640 --> 03:33:35.280]  It's the the point after so it's point zero zero zero and that's what they're doing. They're turning
[03:33:35.280 --> 03:33:41.280]  Uh votes into fractions and by doing that they could just say well, we're going to give so and so 43% and the computer
[03:33:41.760 --> 03:33:45.200]  Makes all the calculations and does it and then there's no way to tell
[03:33:45.760 --> 03:33:51.440]  How it's being stolen unless you get the images of the ballots, but let's go over a couple of articles
[03:33:51.440 --> 03:33:58.560]  This is from paul joseph watson polster the dam is about to break on hillary voters abandoning established candidate in droves
[03:33:58.560 --> 03:34:02.960]  And this is from polster pat caddell who said she's hemorrhaging support
[03:34:02.960 --> 03:34:09.680]  As the fba announced they're going to uh, you know go in and look again at her emails and now they're finding 650,000 new emails
[03:34:10.400 --> 03:34:14.160]  It should be a treasure trove of of yoga poses. I'm sure um
[03:34:14.720 --> 03:34:20.400]  You know they compared it to ronald reagan when he won as the empty establishment candidate back in 1980
[03:34:20.640 --> 03:34:26.560]  It's hard to think I was a kid when ronald reagan was elected and uh for me to think of him as anti-establishment
[03:34:26.640 --> 03:34:31.600]  But when you go back and actually look at what he was fighting for he did have some of those tendencies
[03:34:31.600 --> 03:34:34.960]  Some of those tendencies until they shot him and then he became a good little boy
[03:34:35.600 --> 03:34:42.400]  Here's another one from breitbart poll donald trump plus four in florida jumps 19 points among cubans
[03:34:43.600 --> 03:34:48.240]  And we've heard a lot of chicanery going on apparently a hillary clinton was having meetings with
[03:34:48.720 --> 03:34:52.800]  election county officials in florida who are guaranteeing her a
[03:34:53.680 --> 03:34:54.640]  Yeah, to go to her
[03:34:54.640 --> 03:34:58.000]  I got a call from a pollster over the weekend a poll watcher who said hey
[03:34:58.000 --> 03:35:02.000]  I've had five people in the last day come up to me and said they've they were told
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:06.080]  They already voted when they went up to vote and they said oh, but it's all being fixed
[03:35:06.080 --> 03:35:09.920]  The election commissioner is just allowing them to vote on a provisional ballot for one thing
[03:35:09.920 --> 03:35:12.160]  I don't know if they always count these provisional ballots sometimes
[03:35:12.160 --> 03:35:15.520]  They don't and another thing is you got two votes that offset each other
[03:35:15.600 --> 03:35:20.400]  Some are already voted for candidate a and the other person comes and votes for candidate b on the provisional ballot
[03:35:20.400 --> 03:35:24.000]  They offset each other so that was five in one county
[03:35:24.000 --> 03:35:28.080]  And that was manatee county. By the way, I tweeted out about that yesterday
[03:35:28.560 --> 03:35:32.560]  So let's go now that we've seen how this stuff is going to happen in all the different ways
[03:35:32.800 --> 03:35:38.240]  There is a master way. They're doing it and it's through the electronic voting machines. We've been telling you that for years
[03:35:38.720 --> 03:35:41.360]  You know, you go to these other countries where they want to have say
[03:35:42.240 --> 03:35:45.600]  Fair elections and they're dipping their thumb and purple ink to show that they voted
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:50.240]  And I honestly think that's what we should go back to and we should go with paper ballots
[03:35:50.240 --> 03:35:56.160]  And then we don't need these dam electronic voting machines to steal everything for us. I'm sorry, you know, it is 2016
[03:35:56.160 --> 03:35:58.160]  And we should be able to do this the right way
[03:35:58.160 --> 03:36:02.320]  But we know we can't trust the people who are supposed to be in charge of these elections
[03:36:02.320 --> 03:36:05.520]  They've proven time and time again that they're culpable. They could be bought off
[03:36:05.520 --> 03:36:10.800]  They could have political preference and there's just no way to make sure it's done unless it's done by paper ballots
[03:36:10.800 --> 03:36:14.800]  With three people watching the count at the same time in the tabulation
[03:36:14.800 --> 03:36:17.600]  And you purple thumb everybody so they can't vote twice
[03:36:17.600 --> 03:36:20.640]  So let's there it is right there the purple finger
[03:36:21.040 --> 03:36:26.960]  I guess that's from one of those muslim countries where you know, that was in iraq probably when they were voting
[03:36:27.520 --> 03:36:30.960]  For their president in the last election. So let's go
[03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:36.240]  To this snippet of Bev Harris talking about how our votes are stolen. How it doesn't matter
[03:36:36.720 --> 03:36:41.040]  Even if we catch Hillary in the act, even if we catch her with a dead body, it doesn't matter. She's going to win the election
[03:36:41.120 --> 03:36:45.440]  Anyway, let's roll it now. So you have found the mother load of election fraud
[03:36:45.440 --> 03:36:48.720]  Yeah, it tells you how to do everything
[03:36:48.720 --> 03:36:54.400]  Is it not clear that Hillary and the media are trying to sell the idea that there is an election fraud
[03:36:54.560 --> 03:36:58.880]  And that trump's gonna lose by a landslide when the polls and everything else so something opposite
[03:36:59.280 --> 03:37:02.800]  Let me put it this way. Of course things have been very surprising of late
[03:37:02.800 --> 03:37:15.600]  But if she is still viable in any way whether or not she wins she will win
[03:37:16.720 --> 03:37:23.360]  We've found some new information and I think it's the the missing piece that we didn't have before
[03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:27.280]  A gentleman by the name of benny smith out of memphis, tennessee
[03:37:27.280 --> 03:37:32.480]  Um discovered what I would characterize as a master key
[03:37:33.040 --> 03:37:39.040]  Which essentially lets one person control with invisibly and with remarkable precision
[03:37:39.520 --> 03:37:44.240]  Down to the precinct level and down to the type of voting early voting and so forth or whatever type they want
[03:37:45.920 --> 03:37:49.360]  Many different locations at once multiple counties and multiple states
[03:37:50.480 --> 03:37:52.800]  It has actually been in the system
[03:37:52.800 --> 03:38:00.640]  Uh since it it is put in the system in 2001, but it was it came into wide use in 2006
[03:38:01.280 --> 03:38:04.480]  Uh, but it kind of took someone with a special set of skills
[03:38:05.040 --> 03:38:07.040]  To know what to look for
[03:38:07.680 --> 03:38:11.040]  He didn't just be like do like most of the people did where he says well
[03:38:11.040 --> 03:38:13.200]  Let me just look at the program and see what I think
[03:38:13.920 --> 03:38:17.840]  He is a guy who has some background in political
[03:38:17.840 --> 03:38:24.960]  Um forecasting and so forth and he knew uh, what would be needed he kind of went
[03:38:24.960 --> 03:38:29.440]  Let me design what I think would be needed in order to succeed with widespread
[03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:35.600]  Collection fraud and after he did that he went now. Let me see if the pieces that I know are necessary
[03:38:36.240 --> 03:38:43.440]  Are built into the system. They should not be and he was amazed when he found after looking at the files
[03:38:43.440 --> 03:38:47.600]  That the pieces were built in to commit
[03:38:48.400 --> 03:38:51.360]  Very large-scale fraud using a feature
[03:38:51.920 --> 03:38:56.080]  That had been very little known before well, you know the thing that
[03:38:56.880 --> 03:39:03.600]  He thought was needed, which uh, I didn't really understand until I met him and actually started putting together this video
[03:39:04.560 --> 03:39:10.560]  He said the one thing you need the key element is you need to have the votes counted as fractions
[03:39:10.560 --> 03:39:14.080]  You need the votes to be counted with decimal places like you count money
[03:39:14.080 --> 03:39:19.440]  You have to have um, not just if a vote is a dollar. You also have to have cents on the end of it like
[03:39:20.640 --> 03:39:26.560]  16,000 point three one right why do you know that will not show it's hidden
[03:39:27.120 --> 03:39:31.440]  But you need that because any he said, you know, you never there's one thing you don't know
[03:39:31.600 --> 03:39:37.520]  You can't know before the election and that's how many people will show up at each polling place in each precinct
[03:39:37.520 --> 03:39:41.120]  So if you start doing things like I'm going to do every third vote
[03:39:41.200 --> 03:39:44.400]  I'm going to add a hundred votes here. You're going to get you're not going to be very precise
[03:39:45.360 --> 03:39:50.800]  Instead you need to do what in finance they call an allocation. You say
[03:39:51.760 --> 03:39:53.760]  Whatever number of people show up
[03:39:54.560 --> 03:39:58.960]  The guy is going to get x percent of those votes whatever they are
[03:39:59.920 --> 03:40:06.560]  Now think about this if you have a hundred votes and you say my guy's going to get 43 percent
[03:40:06.560 --> 03:40:09.600]  That's 43 votes. But if you have 99 people show up
[03:40:10.320 --> 03:40:15.040]  What's going to happen you're going to end up with 42 point something something something vote
[03:40:15.520 --> 03:40:22.000]  So if your system is not capable of counting votes with decimals, it can't do that allocation
[03:40:23.200 --> 03:40:27.360]  And what so what he did was he knew that that's how it would have to be done
[03:40:27.360 --> 03:40:32.560]  And it would have to be very specific done to the precinct level the databases can be configured any way you want
[03:40:32.560 --> 03:40:37.120]  And they should be configured and used to be configured to count each vote as a whole number
[03:40:37.280 --> 03:40:40.480]  It's called counting it as an integer. He went in and looked and said, let me see
[03:40:41.200 --> 03:40:47.680]  It should count it as a whole integer. They had changed the setting in all of the voting machines in america
[03:40:48.960 --> 03:40:51.760]  The master computers, this is not the machines out in the precinct
[03:40:52.080 --> 03:40:54.960]  This is the master computers that control all the voting machines
[03:40:55.520 --> 03:40:59.520]  This is incredible and again time and time again you and your researchers
[03:40:59.520 --> 03:41:02.960]  Tyrell say around the country have exposed the different ways they're doing it
[03:41:03.360 --> 03:41:07.520]  And so I guess there's a you know top you know fraud investigator. You're able to reverse engineer
[03:41:07.760 --> 03:41:11.760]  Okay, if we are going to steal it, how will we do it? Let's look for this and then sure enough
[03:41:11.840 --> 03:41:16.240]  You've you know, you've caught them dialing in remotely. You've got amazing. Yeah, you know with you
[03:41:16.720 --> 03:41:22.160]  In other words, anybody can sit there and go well, this looks like a vulnerability. It's theoretically this is not a theory
[03:41:22.160 --> 03:41:26.480]  This is real. This is something that was put into the system. They actually changed the setting
[03:41:26.480 --> 03:41:31.760]  We can actually go back and figure out now that we know it exactly the date that the setting was changed
[03:41:32.160 --> 03:41:35.840]  And that it migrated to all the other manufacturers in the u.s
[03:41:36.240 --> 03:41:42.400]  So now at this point the setting is in there to be able to allocate votes by percent
[03:41:43.600 --> 03:41:48.240]  To in basically 99 percent of the votes in the u.s. And then he went on
[03:41:49.120 --> 03:41:53.600]  And he he basically proved it. He said now that I know that's in there
[03:41:53.600 --> 03:41:59.360]  I think I can allocate the votes and it is stunning when you see the demo
[03:41:59.760 --> 03:42:05.120]  Let's be clear. Let's be clear. You're you're finding this to the voting software. You go in it's this
[03:42:07.120 --> 03:42:14.240]  Algorithm or system to be able to basically program it to show the outcome you want by shaving votes. I mean in a layperson
[03:42:14.720 --> 03:42:18.400]  Uh, uh, this is not a you know expert like you or a top computer programmer
[03:42:18.400 --> 03:42:23.520]  What's happening? So there's this one central computer which at the end of the day all the votes come to it
[03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:27.440]  That's where you take it. You know run around to five thousand different things in precincts
[03:42:27.440 --> 03:42:34.160]  You wait till the votes come to you and then you have your way with them and uh, it's very very precise
[03:42:34.880 --> 03:42:40.560]  It's invisible and uh, there's absolute it doesn't matter whether the system's on the internet or not
[03:42:40.560 --> 03:42:45.040]  None of the stuff that they say is the protection matters at all. You have your way with them
[03:42:45.040 --> 03:42:51.120]  Um, then you once you control the votes in whatever way you want for whatever target you want
[03:42:51.760 --> 03:42:58.480]  This can be done by one or a couple of people across whole jurisdictions. I actually
[03:42:59.600 --> 03:43:04.320]  Didn't want to write the story unless I was absolutely sure so not only did I see him do it
[03:43:04.640 --> 03:43:11.920]  but I had him show me how it was done and uh, I took some vote databases real vote databases that I have
[03:43:11.920 --> 03:43:16.880]  One of them was the entire state of alaska the vote database from the 2004 election
[03:43:17.440 --> 03:43:21.120]  I was able to change every precinct in the state of alaska in four seconds
[03:43:21.360 --> 03:43:26.960]  Is it not clear that hillary and the media are trying to sell the idea that there is an election fraud
[03:43:27.200 --> 03:43:31.520]  And that trump's kind of lose by a landslide when the polls and everything else so something opposite
[03:43:31.920 --> 03:43:37.840]  Let me put it this way. Of course things have been very surprising of late, but if she is still viable in any way
[03:43:38.400 --> 03:43:40.400]  Whether or not she wins she will win
[03:43:40.400 --> 03:43:42.400]  Wow, please say that again
[03:43:44.000 --> 03:43:46.400]  Whether or not she wins she will win
[03:43:47.520 --> 03:43:51.680]  Now she may be removed from office afterwards and and as you may recall
[03:43:51.760 --> 03:43:58.560]  Richard Nixon was right in the middle. He had been four months into watergate scandals and was reelected and removed from office later
[03:43:58.960 --> 03:44:04.960]  Um, but what's so disturbing about that is, you know, there's actually some republican elites
[03:44:05.360 --> 03:44:09.360]  Who might prefer getting her in and removing her from office
[03:44:09.360 --> 03:44:16.400]  Oh, of course, of course, of course, they can't control of course exactly exactly the whole power structure
[03:44:16.960 --> 03:44:22.320]  Is against trump. I mean, whether he's perfect or good or bad. I mean, if we claim we're against the corrupt power structure
[03:44:22.800 --> 03:44:26.320]  Then how can we not be for trump? I mean, I'm sorry. I'll say this as well
[03:44:26.800 --> 03:44:29.840]  Um, whatever anyone thinks about the candidate
[03:44:30.000 --> 03:44:36.560]  I will say that when he has brought to the front the issue of tampering with elections
[03:44:36.560 --> 03:44:42.160]  It's one of the most important services that could have been done in the united states ever
[03:44:42.480 --> 03:44:44.800]  You're the expert. What headline do we put on this bev?
[03:44:46.560 --> 03:44:48.560]  Uh, you're gonna have to choose the headline
[03:44:49.360 --> 03:44:55.920]  I know I just want to be totally accurate a vote fraud expert bev Harris exposes, uh, you know, uh
[03:44:57.520 --> 03:45:02.320]  The big enchilada or I mean, you know, it's I I just call it the magic key
[03:45:02.320 --> 03:45:07.840]  I mean, it really literally is you picture janitor going down the hall with the master key jingling at his side
[03:45:08.080 --> 03:45:10.080]  He can open any door with it. There you go
[03:45:11.360 --> 03:45:15.600]  You know, we've basically got so you have found the mother load of election fraud
[03:45:16.560 --> 03:45:20.160]  Yeah, it tells you how to do everything and you know
[03:45:21.280 --> 03:45:27.120]  It's you really can uh can see it depicted and it's just and I know you want to give this fellow credit
[03:45:27.120 --> 03:45:30.960]  We are in a moment. I want to get him on and you back on please. Please. Please. I don't even want you on for months
[03:45:30.960 --> 03:45:36.960]  You've been quietly working on this briefly though. George sorrow 16 states his company. He's connected to others
[03:45:37.200 --> 03:45:39.200]  He's been caught in a lot of stuff. What do you make of that?
[03:45:40.880 --> 03:45:42.880]  Yeah, um, I
[03:45:43.200 --> 03:45:46.880]  Have seen some indicators now. There's a company called dominion
[03:45:47.040 --> 03:45:53.280]  There has been some mistakes where people thought that there the smartmatic was being used. No smartmatic hasn't been used to here
[03:45:53.280 --> 03:45:55.440]  It's been used to in latin america and a bunch of other places
[03:45:55.440 --> 03:46:00.880]  But he's connected. I think it's kind of drew a couple of hoops, but with a company called dominion
[03:46:00.880 --> 03:46:04.080]  And dominion is one of the ones that bought the premier
[03:46:04.560 --> 03:46:08.480]  Debald stuff and they have now admitted that they fractionalized the count
[03:46:10.160 --> 03:46:12.160]  Whoa
[03:46:12.400 --> 03:46:14.400]  So I saw us connected grip
[03:46:14.960 --> 03:46:16.640]  I again, uh, it's
[03:46:17.280 --> 03:46:20.960]  You know, it's sort of connected through a couple of arms lengths
[03:46:20.960 --> 03:46:27.920]  But it is it's enough so that I I wouldn't call I think there is some connection
[03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:30.880]  It's just um, it's like one of his guys guys
[03:46:31.120 --> 03:46:34.320]  So, I mean, there's always going to be a couple of buffers
[03:46:34.880 --> 03:46:37.280]  In between but sorrows connected group
[03:46:37.840 --> 03:46:44.160]  Um, it looks like may be admitting to be involved in the whole fraction deal. Wow. Oh, they are they have yeah
[03:46:44.160 --> 03:46:48.240]  They they one of their top guys said that they did it. There's a person
[03:46:48.240 --> 03:46:53.120]  There's a group called defend the vote in illinois and the woman involved with that Sharon Maroney
[03:46:53.680 --> 03:47:00.080]  Actually confronted dominion and said and they admitted that they do fractionalize the count and she asked them why and they said
[03:47:00.720 --> 03:47:02.720]  for marketing purposes
[03:47:02.720 --> 03:47:04.720]  Wow, they hide it in blame view
[03:47:12.720 --> 03:47:14.240]  All right
[03:47:14.240 --> 03:47:16.240]  They do it for marketing purposes
[03:47:16.240 --> 03:47:23.040]  We steal the vote for marketing purposes now. Let me show you this ben garrison graphic right here on the screen
[03:47:23.600 --> 03:47:29.920]  Uh double trouble emails bubble humus tears and air of pig this election. I shall ring
[03:47:30.960 --> 03:47:33.280]  And look who's in the background taking selfies of himself
[03:47:34.160 --> 03:47:41.120]  That pretty much sums it up right there visually as to what is going on in this country now you can find the full
[03:47:41.120 --> 03:47:43.600]  I think we have the the short video up
[03:47:43.600 --> 03:47:48.000]  Um guys pull that up so I can give people the headline it went up while I was in here
[03:47:48.320 --> 03:47:53.200]  But we're gonna have everything on how America's elections are hacked missing link discovered
[03:47:53.920 --> 03:47:59.440]  So that's there on drudge right now. And if you click on that, we should have that video that 10 minute excerpt there
[03:47:59.440 --> 03:48:01.440]  And we'll have the full video up very soon
[03:48:02.080 --> 03:48:04.800]  From bev harris at black box voting
[03:48:05.280 --> 03:48:10.880]  Dot com now what's going on also as a fallout to this hashtag hillary for prisons trending on twitter
[03:48:10.880 --> 03:48:14.320]  After fbi reopens the clinton investigation
[03:48:14.960 --> 03:48:19.440]  So you can go to that article as well on info wars and read all the tweets
[03:48:20.240 --> 03:48:22.240]  um, it's pretty good
[03:48:22.800 --> 03:48:24.800]  and uh
[03:48:25.360 --> 03:48:30.240]  Ah and they spelled it I guess they spelled they were spelling adding an extra eye to prison
[03:48:30.880 --> 03:48:35.920]  Because uh the hashtag was blocked from trending so they just changed it around and then kept going
[03:48:35.920 --> 03:48:41.280]  Um and people are saying stop censoring twitter your goose is cooked
[03:48:41.840 --> 03:48:48.240]  So there's that here's an interesting little little tweet that I uh retweeted over the weekend how to catch a hillary voter
[03:48:48.480 --> 03:48:52.960]  Everyone to catch one in the act you put up some trump signs right alongside the road
[03:48:53.200 --> 03:48:56.000]  But you put nails in front of the first one right there
[03:48:56.080 --> 03:49:00.960]  So when they run it over in their car, oh, they have to go change a flat tire and then you can find out who's been
[03:49:00.960 --> 03:49:06.800]  Uh running over your trump signs. So that's how these people play dirty tricks. They can't take the truth
[03:49:07.360 --> 03:49:09.680]  And they're going to be so happy when she steals it
[03:49:10.880 --> 03:49:14.320]  And then if they kick her out of office, well, we're going to be stuck with tim kane

[03:53:05.840 --> 03:53:10.000]  I suffer from extreme fatigue and an inability to handle stress for over six years
[03:53:10.080 --> 03:53:15.520]  I have been taking adrenal supplements including herbs glandulars vitamin c and vitamin b5
[03:53:15.680 --> 03:53:22.960]  All these supplements did was treat the symptoms and produced only minimal results now just after one month on synergy one and adiarmetics
[03:53:23.120 --> 03:53:31.760]  I truly feel rejuvenated. I have never felt such relaxation before from any adrenal supplement as I did just 10 minutes after taking adiarmetics
[03:53:31.760 --> 03:53:36.080]  I then noticed synergy one means you wake up rested and with much more energy
[03:53:36.240 --> 03:53:39.120]  No more hungover groggy feeling upon arising
[03:53:39.200 --> 03:53:43.360]  I had almost considered going to another country for stem cell therapy as a last resort
[03:53:43.440 --> 03:53:49.920]  But now I truly feel rejuvenated on synergy one and adiarmetics success happens with synergistic nutrition

[03:54:11.920 --> 03:54:16.000]  Final segment of the alex joneshow. This is the fourth hour of overdrive. I'm your host rob do
[03:54:16.480 --> 03:54:21.520]  I got a quick video i want to go to uh here in a second with joe biggs talking about this latest
[03:54:21.520 --> 03:54:26.400]  Podesta email there have been thousands of them 21 or 22 releases so far
[03:54:27.040 --> 03:54:31.840]  And just each one has its own little treasure trove. This one focuses in on how
[03:54:32.320 --> 03:54:38.000]  Basically everybody in your government's using a gmail account. So, you know, everybody's hackable at this point
[03:54:38.480 --> 03:54:41.040]  And if nothing else all these messages are going to google
[03:54:41.840 --> 03:54:45.520]  What do you think kind of power that gives them? So here's that video
[03:54:45.520 --> 03:54:51.840]  This is joe biggs here with info wars.com now. We have another Podesta email dump
[03:54:52.080 --> 03:54:58.800]  That's been provided to us by wiki leaks and this time we've got some very damning information that has come out
[03:54:59.120 --> 03:55:02.160]  But before I get to that just a reminder. We are days
[03:55:02.720 --> 03:55:08.080]  Around the corner from being able to have our next president will be
[03:55:08.640 --> 03:55:14.080]  Hillary rotham clinton the most corrupt politician known to man or will be donald j trump the man
[03:55:14.080 --> 03:55:16.880]  Who says he will make america great again?
[03:55:17.440 --> 03:55:21.200]  Now we've seen a lot of these emails come out and they've been damning time and time again
[03:55:21.520 --> 03:55:27.920]  And yet people are still willing to go and turn out and vote for hillary clinton even though we know that she is so corrupt
[03:55:28.160 --> 03:55:31.280]  There's so much blood on her hands and there's so much secrecy
[03:55:31.680 --> 03:55:36.240]  Surrounding this presidential candidate that claims that she is transparent
[03:55:36.880 --> 03:55:42.960]  And now we have this brand new email. It's from tom nides. He is the former deputy secretary of state
[03:55:42.960 --> 03:55:47.280]  This email is to john podesta the chairman of the hillary clinton presidential campaign
[03:55:47.840 --> 03:55:52.160]  For what it's worth. There is only one thing that needs to be done on this email thing
[03:55:52.400 --> 03:55:58.640]  Which i'm sure nobody wants to do get a state department career lawyer to go through all the emails and pull the official ones
[03:55:59.120 --> 03:56:03.200]  I know all the reasons not to do it, but it's going to happen. So we should do it
[03:56:03.520 --> 03:56:10.320]  By the way, you know as well as I every goddamn cabinet officer in white house staff uses their gmail accounts
[03:56:10.320 --> 03:56:16.640]  So they know that they're using this kind of information that there is official emails classified emails
[03:56:16.800 --> 03:56:21.440]  That are being sent on gmail servers. So there's a huge problem
[03:56:21.440 --> 03:56:25.120]  We have people who are supposed to protect our national security interests
[03:56:25.440 --> 03:56:31.440]  And they could care less about actually taking the proper steps to precautions to safeguard that information
[03:56:31.600 --> 03:56:33.840]  From getting into the wrong types of hands
[03:56:33.840 --> 03:56:40.240]  So I want to thank wiki leaks juliana saans and all the people out there that are tirelessly going through all these emails
[03:56:41.200 --> 03:56:48.800]  Exposing the corruption behind hillary clinton and her evil campaign workers. This has been joe biggs with info wars dot com
[03:56:49.520 --> 03:56:51.520]  And let's not forget
[03:56:51.520 --> 03:56:53.840]  Let's not forget how podesta got hacked
[03:56:54.320 --> 03:56:56.560]  He got hacked out of a fishing expedition
[03:56:56.560 --> 03:56:58.960]  So they sent him a link that said hey change your password
[03:56:58.960 --> 03:57:04.880]  But it was a bad link and they were able to absorb his password there and then go in and steal all his emails
[03:57:05.440 --> 03:57:09.600]  So imagine every other state department official
[03:57:10.320 --> 03:57:15.760]  These employees they all have devices and we don't know how these devices. They migrate emails
[03:57:15.840 --> 03:57:21.360]  Humas claim he doesn't know how anthony wiener had 650,000 emails on his computer
[03:57:21.680 --> 03:57:28.480]  Well my see my guess is that he saw all the corruption going on and he was a low level demon minion and said, you know what?
[03:57:28.480 --> 03:57:34.880]  I better grab these and keep them on my computer just in case because I may need to get out a jail free card at some point
[03:57:34.880 --> 03:57:38.880]  Especially if hillary gets into office and these charges start coming up. I could say look
[03:57:38.880 --> 03:57:40.560]  I've got a whole computer with it
[03:57:40.560 --> 03:57:43.200]  But he just couldn't keep his phone in his pants
[03:57:43.200 --> 03:57:47.840]  He had to pull it out and show everybody and that's why he is now under investigation
[03:57:48.160 --> 03:57:52.640]  So it just goes to show I think he put it in a folder called life insurance too. That's it's even funnier
[03:57:52.960 --> 03:57:55.760]  But uh hey the hillary for prison shirts aren't for sale anymore
[03:57:55.760 --> 03:58:00.080]  But you can still get your trump as my president shirt at info wars.com if you get it
[03:58:00.400 --> 03:58:03.920]  We can get it to you real quick wear it on election day or wear red on election day
[03:58:04.240 --> 03:58:09.280]  So when they're showing shots of the polls everywhere, we know that people are voting for donald j trump
