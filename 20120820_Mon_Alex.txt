[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:36.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.760 --> 00:44.280]  to say that we're dealing with information overload is well an
[00:44.280 --> 00:51.440]  understatement wow there is a ton of news to cover so much I do feel like my
[00:51.440 --> 00:59.560]  head is spinning and this is just the beginning of all of the craziness to
[00:59.560 --> 01:05.640]  come the acceleration into this massive time of change for the globalist are
[01:05.640 --> 01:09.000]  wanting to get rid of national sovereignty worldwide and bring in their
[01:09.000 --> 01:16.600]  world government obviously we have the report be a foyer request that was
[01:16.600 --> 01:21.760]  granted by the gracious leaders at government just from one threat fusion
[01:21.760 --> 01:31.200]  center well the feds basically watching info wars calm and reading comments and
[01:31.200 --> 01:37.720]  responding to locals who local police and others that come to them and say I
[01:37.720 --> 01:43.080]  saw a V for victory sign what does it mean does it mean that they're gonna
[01:43.080 --> 01:49.320]  come get us and they're like well that's from World War two and it means that
[01:49.320 --> 01:53.360]  basically it's a resistance but it appears to be nonviolent against what
[01:53.360 --> 02:00.800]  info wars.com perceives as a police state I mean why didn't that local police
[02:00.800 --> 02:06.200]  department just go read what it said read the website on it go to the website
[02:06.200 --> 02:09.960]  link where we described what it was about what why didn't they look up what
[02:09.960 --> 02:14.400]  V meant in World War two I mean they could have done it instead they went to
[02:14.400 --> 02:18.800]  the feds and had them tell them and there's a whole bunch of stuff like that
[02:18.800 --> 02:25.360]  in there yeah all the classic stuff of I claim a world governments being
[02:25.360 --> 02:31.240]  established and all the rest of it so we're gonna be speaking some about that
[02:31.240 --> 02:38.640]  because it is important and going over some of the different documents where it
[02:38.640 --> 02:44.560]  is described though as right-wing terrorism that's a quote see couple cops
[02:44.560 --> 02:48.520]  got shot last week and now they're saying it's sovereign citizens in Louisiana
[02:48.520 --> 02:52.280]  really it was reported they were drug dealers so much stuff who just use that
[02:52.280 --> 02:57.880]  as a pretext to say they're magically above the law just because the
[02:57.880 --> 03:02.480]  globalists are above the law doesn't mean that you or I can suddenly go out
[03:02.480 --> 03:06.280]  and kill somebody I mean the globalists are going to be brought to justice as
[03:06.280 --> 03:11.520]  well but the point is is that they're now saying that's a sovereign citizens
[03:11.520 --> 03:17.120]  group and then they just call them extremists and anti-government which
[03:17.120 --> 03:21.680]  isn't enough of a label you're like well I mean these guys just reportedly shot
[03:21.680 --> 03:26.640]  killed two cops injured two others or it appears to be just the fact that they
[03:26.640 --> 03:35.760]  felt like it and you just call them extremists because then when they call
[03:35.760 --> 03:42.760]  somebody like myself an extremist the label now psychologically means killer
[03:42.760 --> 03:46.800]  and statistically you know what they call sovereign citizens do kill three or
[03:46.800 --> 03:51.160]  four cops a year statistically that's still a very low threat threshold for
[03:51.160 --> 03:59.400]  the police but it's advertised like it is the end of the world it's all
[03:59.400 --> 04:05.960]  advertised like it is the end of the world and that it is the most dangerous
[04:05.960 --> 04:12.960]  thing in the world to the police actually this is not the most dangerous but
[04:12.960 --> 04:18.360]  it's one of the bad ones Harvard study finds fluoride lowers IQs causes
[04:18.360 --> 04:24.240]  cancer that's mainstream news you can look that up just came out a few weeks
[04:24.240 --> 04:35.440]  ago my point is but that's not sexy no scary no that's not something that
[04:35.440 --> 04:40.400]  they're hyping up and notice you saw this hype ahead of all this happening
[04:40.400 --> 04:45.280]  they want to get a civil war going they want to get the police to alert like an
[04:45.280 --> 04:50.440]  attack dog on patriots libertarians and conservatives so you will start a fight
[04:50.440 --> 04:55.480]  with us a fight you will lose of course big time and the globalists will use
[04:55.480 --> 05:00.800]  that to get rid of both sides and bring in foreign troops the worst drought in
[05:00.800 --> 05:04.720]  50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half
[05:04.720 --> 05:09.520]  year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only
[05:09.520 --> 05:13.720]  corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising
[05:13.720 --> 05:17.480]  prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of
[05:17.480 --> 05:21.520]  business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to
[05:21.520 --> 05:25.760]  freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from

[08:08.120 --> 08:22.520]  this is not actually new news
[08:22.960 --> 08:30.160]  but now that it's in a London Guardian I guess it is seen as those stop that
[08:30.160 --> 08:36.720]  info works comm senior senators suggested false flag attack the Kennedy
[08:36.720 --> 08:42.240]  two years prior operation Northwood's proposal that was green-lighted all the
[08:42.240 --> 08:48.240]  way up to the president who again said no to the plan not just some on the shelf
[08:48.240 --> 08:53.440]  plan a plan that was green-lighted to shoot up movie theaters bomb shopping
[08:53.440 --> 09:01.280]  malls little shopping centers attack US military bases and blame it on domestic
[09:01.280 --> 09:04.960]  groups so they would round up an arrest claiming they worked for Cuba and the
[09:04.960 --> 09:12.520]  Soviet Union now Bobby Kennedy also proposed to his brother when he was
[09:12.520 --> 09:19.200]  attorney general attacking the US Embassy in Honduras as a pretext to
[09:19.200 --> 09:26.840]  invade now of course this all was actually public a long time ago even
[09:26.840 --> 09:32.400]  after we'd reported on it it's been an ABC news you name it Northwood's in
[09:32.400 --> 09:41.920]  general back in early 2001 is when that news broke but I remember watching a
[09:41.920 --> 09:49.240]  frontline on PBS when I was on the road one time in my hotel room and I'd read
[09:49.240 --> 09:55.640]  the stuff but there they were admitting that Nixon had green-lighted bombing
[09:55.640 --> 10:02.640]  their own convention to blame it on domestic groups but that too many people
[10:02.640 --> 10:09.040]  in the FBI found out about it they didn't control and so they killed that
[10:09.040 --> 10:14.600]  plan see this is why when there's an event and it has the right timing and
[10:14.600 --> 10:19.840]  telltale signs of other actors other people involved we immediately are
[10:19.840 --> 10:26.480]  forced to come out and say well this could be a false flag we said Fast and
[10:26.480 --> 10:31.080]  Furious was the false flag and the and the memos did come out that it was done
[10:31.080 --> 10:40.160]  to blame the Second Amendment in fact provocaturing and staging stuff is so
[10:40.160 --> 10:47.440]  universal now that whether it's the Greek police or whether it's the Spanish
[10:47.440 --> 10:52.760]  police or the US police or Canadian police or British police even local
[10:52.760 --> 10:58.760]  police departments it caught constantly planning drugs on people breaking into
[10:58.760 --> 11:04.400]  cars blaming it on people stealing cars running their own shop shops running
[11:04.400 --> 11:10.920]  prostitution and provocaturing staging attacks on their own officers whose
[11:10.920 --> 11:14.920]  owners don't even know there's been lawsuits was a couple out in Seattle's
[11:14.920 --> 11:20.800]  how we learned about it from 99 where they had cops dressed up throwing glass
[11:20.800 --> 11:25.200]  bottles and hitting police and they had with it who were in riot gear and in one
[11:25.200 --> 11:29.240]  lawsuit I saw they broke the guy's jaw and he got in trouble and he complained
[11:29.240 --> 11:35.640]  and found out that it was other police officers doing it dressed up like
[11:35.640 --> 11:40.280]  anarchist leading a group of foundation anarchists who've been flown in by some
[11:40.280 --> 11:45.200]  of the big tax-free foundations as a way to attack the 50 60,000 peaceful protesters
[11:45.200 --> 11:48.360]  that were saying we don't want the World Trade Organization we don't want
[11:48.360 --> 11:52.200]  global government you got a bunch of men women and children and baby strollers
[11:52.200 --> 11:55.760]  and good-looking protesters out there on the streets that can turn into a
[11:55.760 --> 12:01.920]  peaceful revolution so you go and you attack the police with your own police
[12:01.920 --> 12:05.760]  and Delta Force was involved you don't believe me if you're a new member of the
[12:05.760 --> 12:10.800]  press or new listener just you can pull up Seattle Post intelligence or Seattle
[12:10.800 --> 12:14.920]  Times it's all in my film police state to the takeover you're too lazy to use
[12:14.920 --> 12:21.320]  Lexis Nexus or Reuters services that'll have stuff that's you know not
[12:21.320 --> 12:25.640]  easy to find on the web it I've got screenshots and newscast in my film
[12:25.640 --> 12:30.680]  police state to the takeover and I got all this world news I'm digressing just
[12:30.680 --> 12:35.960]  that's one of the first articles I wanted to get into and the issue was the
[12:35.960 --> 12:39.720]  police got mad the police union got mad because they had to sit there for an
[12:39.720 --> 12:44.480]  entire day for the news cameras but they weren't told they were just told
[12:44.480 --> 12:50.680]  stand down being hit by bottles being rocks thrown at them by less than 50
[12:50.680 --> 12:55.880]  people Delta Force was commanding it with radios from the heights that came
[12:55.880 --> 13:01.960]  out Delta Force Delta Force yes look it up Delta Force was running the whole
[13:01.960 --> 13:08.240]  black op they had different federal agencies there federal marshals FBI
[13:08.240 --> 13:14.960]  ATF of course bomb disposal was their cover story and a little less than 50
[13:14.960 --> 13:19.160]  anarchists who they brought in and then housed in a building under government
[13:19.160 --> 13:22.760]  protection so they attacked the police and the police are like we want to do
[13:22.760 --> 13:28.280]  something and they're told stand down let them loot Nike town let them burn
[13:28.280 --> 13:35.920]  things down and sit well I'm sorry I'm a citizen I'm a cop I'm a janitor you you
[13:35.920 --> 13:39.720]  throw a bottle and hit me with it I'm gonna I'm gonna attack you right back I
[13:39.720 --> 13:45.120]  don't I mean who are these police you're standing there in your in the riot
[13:45.120 --> 13:50.480]  line people are hitting you with bottles and you don't do anything so one hits
[13:50.480 --> 13:57.800]  you in the face and breaks your jaw you kill somebody with a bottle so it's a
[13:57.800 --> 14:02.160]  deadly weapon the point is that is brainwashing that they would put up with
[14:02.160 --> 14:08.240]  that remember the case of Katrina bruce shard it's his name he was the sheriff
[14:08.240 --> 14:11.960]  or no he was a sheriff of bruce shard counter whatever he called the point is
[14:11.960 --> 14:16.360]  we pulled up the CBS newscast few weeks ago when I talked about it on air he
[14:16.360 --> 14:23.240]  talks about his mother and she's in the nursing home flooded you know the waters
[14:23.240 --> 14:29.400]  of foot off the floor foot deep she's got a cell phone that wasn't dead yet and
[14:29.400 --> 14:34.760]  she's calling and he's saying mama I'll be there in one day mama I'll be there
[14:34.760 --> 14:37.360]  in two days three days four days they get there five days later because the
[14:37.360 --> 14:43.720]  feds wouldn't let him in to get his mother and and this is the head of the
[14:43.720 --> 14:49.800]  county this is who's really in charge elected and his mother died my mother is
[14:49.800 --> 14:58.760]  stuck somewhere and the feds are gonna stop me over my dead body I mean this
[14:58.760 --> 15:03.680]  that's what all the zero tolerance and all this is about where the child brings
[15:03.680 --> 15:10.080]  or the teenager brings a plastic knife a Dixie knife to spread butter on their
[15:10.080 --> 15:13.840]  bread you see it in the news every few weeks and they get arrested well we have
[15:13.840 --> 15:24.440]  zero tolerance and you have to report this you have to report if you're a
[15:24.440 --> 15:31.280]  teacher and so like a robot you don't use your own discretion like a robot you
[15:31.280 --> 15:35.960]  go and the person gets arrested or suspended or kicked out so many of the
[15:35.960 --> 15:41.120]  problems we face in this society are because people won't exercise their own
[15:41.120 --> 15:45.320]  judgment their own opinion juries are supposed to judge the law and the facts
[15:45.320 --> 15:49.880]  if you have a jury doesn't like a law it's a it's a check and a balance on
[15:49.880 --> 15:53.920]  constitutional laws that's what the courts are for and we are the ultimate
[15:53.920 --> 16:00.280]  arbiter in the court not the judge grand juries have turned into rubber stamps
[16:00.280 --> 16:06.240]  and prosecutors a jury said they've tried to turn them into rubber stamps judges
[16:06.240 --> 16:13.000]  tried a lot to juries and say oh no oh no you're supposed to do whatever the
[16:13.000 --> 16:21.040]  judge tells you that is called judicial tyranny okay I've already digressed off
[16:21.040 --> 16:28.920]  into that just there is an info wars.com article dealing with it and it's
[16:28.920 --> 16:35.880]  now the one in Guardian and they were going to kill US troops with mortar
[16:35.880 --> 16:43.800]  shells and blame it they were going to burn aircraft at bases sabotage ship
[16:43.800 --> 16:50.040]  harbors basically everything the globalists do on a routine basis to us
[16:50.040 --> 16:59.600]  start rumors use clandestine radio and again this is operations in Cuba and in
[16:59.600 --> 17:04.160]  the US to claim Cuba is attacking the United States
[17:06.960 --> 17:11.800]  and the point is is that many of these plans have been executed it's called
[17:11.800 --> 17:17.720]  Operation Platio okay let me stop there let me go over what's coming up today in
[17:17.720 --> 17:23.240]  this hour and in the second hour and we have an amazing guest filmmaker Michael
[17:23.240 --> 17:29.840]  Murphy you know they made what in the world are they spraying that goes off
[17:29.840 --> 17:33.800]  the government's admission that for at least 18 years worldwide we're getting
[17:33.800 --> 17:38.560]  sprayed with aluminum dioxide barium salts and countless other nasty things
[17:38.560 --> 17:47.120]  sulfur dioxide now they've got a new film out we're carrying both why in the
[17:47.120 --> 17:53.560]  world are they spring and that gets into well the real agenda so why are they
[17:53.560 --> 17:59.080]  spring we know what they're spraying the question is why are they spring and I
[17:59.080 --> 18:01.840]  like this films this good it's just got the government admissions the
[18:01.840 --> 18:05.640]  government think tanks the they have this stuff on C-span they just don't
[18:05.640 --> 18:11.760]  call it chemtrails and it's added to the jet fuel and the jet engines dispersed
[18:11.760 --> 18:15.080]  that even the airline companies aren't even really involved all I gotta do is
[18:15.080 --> 18:19.800]  control the big kerosene makers that's what jet fuel is basically so that's
[18:19.800 --> 18:22.840]  coming up in the third hour we will have open phones towards the end of this

[24:37.360 --> 24:42.760]  single currency we're gonna be going over that CNBC, Der Spiegel and ABC News
[24:42.760 --> 24:49.800]  are all picking up on that Moody's says more California cities at risk of
[24:49.800 --> 24:54.400]  bankruptcy that's been engineered that way with unfunded mandates it's all made
[24:54.400 --> 24:58.720]  up money the bankers give them they get real assets back that's that's how the
[24:58.720 --> 25:03.880]  banks take over. Euro stocks slip after European Central Bank down plays bond
[25:03.880 --> 25:11.120]  report. Facebook stock slides the all-time high there's always a scam always meant to
[25:11.120 --> 25:20.000]  be a scam scam you it's a predator class and they're expanding derivatives
[25:20.000 --> 25:29.400]  worldwide the CME group is new coupons aimed to keep people off generic drugs
[25:29.800 --> 25:35.520]  that's just some of the financial news and you've heard guests here on the
[25:35.520 --> 25:39.640]  broadcast most the economists we have on Dr. Paul Greg Roberts people that
[25:39.640 --> 25:45.160]  research trends like Gerald Salente, Max Kaiser they say now more than ever they
[25:45.160 --> 25:49.440]  collapse we're already collapsing we're already deindustrialized we're already
[25:49.440 --> 25:53.760]  having a rotting in the general economy some areas are completely collapsing
[25:53.760 --> 26:00.080]  already like Detroit and areas outside Los Angeles and well many other areas
[26:00.080 --> 26:05.720]  crime is exploding but we're talking about an accelerated collapse becoming a
[26:05.720 --> 26:11.840]  foregone conclusion in fact Max Kaiser if you missed it last Friday said he
[26:11.840 --> 26:18.280]  does not see a way to avert it mathematically by April of next year
[26:18.280 --> 26:25.320]  and so that's August September October November December January February
[26:25.320 --> 26:29.400]  March April I guess that's five six seven eight and I was like eight and a half
[26:29.400 --> 26:35.120]  nine months the point is is that I tend to agree with Salente a little more
[26:35.120 --> 26:42.120]  because they can always come up with new crazy gimmicks and bubbles that kind of
[26:42.120 --> 26:46.320]  put things off and I don't like these gimmicks because it only consolidates
[26:46.320 --> 26:51.080]  power with the globalist but I mean I'm not looking forward to a collapse to be
[26:51.080 --> 26:56.120]  proven right I'll tell you one thing I'd love to somehow avert this people say
[26:56.120 --> 27:00.440]  oh Alex things weren't as bad as you said up I'm not the one saying there's
[27:00.440 --> 27:05.760]  going to be a total collapse a collapse is imminent though on the course we're
[27:05.760 --> 27:09.480]  on it's kind of like there's an iceberg out there two miles ahead of us and the
[27:09.480 --> 27:15.480]  radar and the visual shows we are in a dead ahead to hit it and I'm like hey
[27:15.480 --> 27:19.680]  we better have a discussion about this we might want to change course and if we
[27:19.680 --> 27:24.520]  do change course that's great all I know is I've never seen more money being
[27:24.520 --> 27:29.840]  spent I've never seen more admissions and trial balloons and acclimation
[27:29.840 --> 27:35.160]  conditioning exercises going on like we are now
[27:35.160 --> 27:39.840]  for civil war basically I mean they're telling police departments nationwide
[27:39.840 --> 27:45.520]  but also all the world that the citizens will attack you harden your
[27:45.520 --> 27:55.960]  facilities get storable food get weapons huge ammo caches get ready you've
[27:55.960 --> 27:59.800]  heard the police call in but you've also seen in the news and now the team
[27:59.800 --> 28:04.240]  is a on the highways rolling out all 50 states secretary of the army saying
[28:04.240 --> 28:08.400]  put troops on the streets blunts drones army manuals about gun
[28:08.400 --> 28:14.640]  confiscation in the US new riot gear to stop small arms fire so it's not just
[28:14.640 --> 28:20.680]  riot gear it's full-body ballistic gear incredibly expensive is being issued to

[28:26.440 --> 28:32.920]  full ballistic shield in front of it that was in the news last week well was in
[28:32.920 --> 28:37.160]  the news because we put it in the news became a national story and by the way
[28:37.160 --> 28:42.120]  all I can say is thank God for the drudge report every day for the last
[28:42.120 --> 28:46.360]  week or two we're gonna have the drudge reports from Lincoln our stories and a
[28:46.360 --> 28:50.440]  lot of what already you know becomes somewhat national international but I
[28:50.440 --> 28:54.160]  mean with drudge it's just if it runs already recognizes what's important what
[28:54.160 --> 28:56.960]  a big story is so that's why it's Lincoln to so many of them but so much is
[28:56.960 --> 29:00.840]  happening but the drudge linking to them is just making I don't know we had like
[29:00.840 --> 29:06.840]  five stories last week that were national news stories one of them was
[29:06.840 --> 29:11.960]  responded to by the White House and that's covered by Fox News we'll cover
[29:11.960 --> 29:17.360]  that when we come back agencies tamp down speculation over hollow point ammo
[29:17.360 --> 29:21.840]  purchases and basically they're saying don't run we are your friends everything's

[34:09.080 --> 34:19.120]  break down the foreign banker occupation government trying to spin the
[34:19.120 --> 34:25.240]  national news story that Paul Watson's research helped kick off in the last two
[34:25.240 --> 34:31.520]  weeks this is Fox News dot com is also covered on Fox television agencies
[34:31.520 --> 34:38.720]  tamp down speculation over hollow point ammo purchases oh well I'm glad that they
[34:38.720 --> 34:44.680]  said nothing to worry about move along obscure federal agencies triggered a
[34:44.680 --> 34:49.280]  firestorm of conspiracy theories so now if you ask a gee I wonder why they've
[34:49.280 --> 34:54.000]  bought 1.4 billion rounds of ammo more than 10 times any yearly purchase in
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.320]  history and I wonder why they're not military ammo it's illegal to use
[34:58.320 --> 35:04.920]  hollow points in the military worldwide because of the Geneva Convention gee what
[35:04.920 --> 35:09.480]  are you gonna do with 1.4 billion plus because there's more purchases daily now
[35:09.480 --> 35:13.680]  they're blacking out where the ammo is going to so we say oh you're blacking it
[35:13.680 --> 35:19.200]  out you using critical thinking oh wow you don't want us to know what you're
[35:19.200 --> 35:22.880]  doing even though you're not mandated by Congress to make these purchases secret
[35:22.880 --> 35:28.280]  oh and there are no bid contracts to your buddies their story after story after
[35:28.280 --> 35:32.240]  story here if the prostitute lazy media let me tell you what goes on at these
[35:32.240 --> 35:35.680]  newsrooms now they've gotten rid of most the real reporters that cause problems
[35:35.680 --> 35:39.600]  and actually do research and they got a bunch of lazy people that sit around in
[35:39.600 --> 35:44.000]  radio TV and print and they sit around and wait for press releases to come from
[35:44.000 --> 35:49.560]  government or corporate agencies and then because they ask weak questions that
[35:49.560 --> 35:54.480]  are softball they have connections and they get to call up and talk to the CEO
[35:54.480 --> 35:59.400]  or the governor or the police chief or whoever or the senator and they'll give
[35:59.400 --> 36:05.220]  them a quote on top of that and then they get to go on junk it's to Hawaii or
[36:05.220 --> 36:12.960]  whatever with the rest of the prostitutes that's what they do not well
[36:12.960 --> 36:17.680]  wait a minute it's 1.4 billion rounds oh wait a minute that they're now since
[36:17.680 --> 36:21.720]  we're reporting on it the new purchase orders blacking them out hey you're not
[36:21.720 --> 36:26.320]  allowed to do that hey why are these no bid I mean just story after story after
[36:26.320 --> 36:35.760]  story but because real reporters in dinosaur media are so rare
[36:38.400 --> 36:50.880]  Fox News can just take the quotes from the federal agency and just put it out
[36:50.880 --> 36:56.360]  there and say they said it's no big deal conspiracy theorist and they use that
[36:56.360 --> 37:06.560]  term over and over and over and over and over and over again so now if I have
[37:06.560 --> 37:11.560]  any type of discrimination on what type of car I like a lot type of food I like
[37:11.560 --> 37:17.360]  on what type of toothpaste I like that's a conspiracy theory because they're
[37:17.360 --> 37:21.080]  they're saying if you question anything that's a that's a conspiracy theory which
[37:21.080 --> 37:27.240]  is a pejorative term to criticize people implying you're mentally unstable well
[37:27.240 --> 37:30.040]  going along with this out of control government and this out of control
[37:30.040 --> 37:34.120]  bureaucracy that's what's mentally unstable so here they are on the mountain
[37:34.120 --> 37:40.280]  reporting to us like their god agencies tap down speculation over hollow point
[37:40.280 --> 37:45.000]  ammo purchases I say good job to Fox for even covering this but they still even
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.800]  get it published have to run with all the little talking points but the
[37:48.800 --> 37:53.400]  agencies most recently the Social Security Administration are trying to put
[37:53.400 --> 37:58.200]  a damper on the speculation noting the ammunition is standard issue and simply
[37:58.200 --> 38:03.360]  used for mandatory federal training sessions really more than 10 times
[38:03.360 --> 38:10.720]  which you've ever bought and 1.4 billion obscure federal agencies triggered a
[38:10.720 --> 38:15.120]  firestorm of conspiracy theories our special agency to be armed and trained
[38:15.120 --> 38:19.680]  appropriately set a message on the official blog for the Social Security
[38:19.680 --> 38:25.960]  Inspector General's office explaining the purchases the bullet purchases drew
[38:25.960 --> 38:30.200]  widespread attention as the website info wars dot com published several
[38:30.200 --> 38:34.440]  stories on them that were linked off of the widely read drudge report and other
[38:34.440 --> 38:41.240]  sites drudge report dot com info wars dot com cataloged a string of recent
[38:41.240 --> 38:44.600]  purchases because we're evil conspiracy theorists we linked the official
[38:44.600 --> 38:48.800]  purchase orders first by the Department of Homeland Security then by the
[38:48.800 --> 38:52.280]  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and then the Social
[38:52.280 --> 38:56.480]  Security Administration yeah no mention here of the major backdrop that it's
[38:56.480 --> 39:02.960]  1.4 billion 250 million 450 million 750 million 750 million that was a week and
[39:02.960 --> 39:11.120]  a half ago now hundreds of thousands more a day in the purchase orders and I
[39:11.120 --> 39:15.920]  mean we're talking about 20,000 rounds to little bitty offices that we go and
[39:15.920 --> 39:20.560]  look up those mostly have armed sworn people in them but the feds don't care
[39:20.560 --> 39:25.320]  they've set the precedent with the TSA to let any bureaucrat impersonate a
[39:25.320 --> 39:31.000]  police officer and let me tell you it's going to cause big problems having the
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.840]  TSA on the streets folks you think the police get out of control at least they
[39:34.840 --> 39:39.520]  have some constitutional training when you get all these security guards and
[39:39.520 --> 39:43.440]  mercenaries and minions the basically bounty hunters are more professional it's
[39:43.440 --> 39:51.840]  it is already a nightmare continuing info wars dot com speculated the
[39:51.840 --> 39:56.880]  purchases were being made in preparation for civil unrest imagining no we
[39:56.880 --> 40:02.920]  didn't imagine we'd link to government and Pentagon documents info wars comm
[40:02.920 --> 40:06.840]  speculated the purchases were being made in preparation for civil unrest
[40:06.840 --> 40:12.960]  imagining a scenario of economic collapse oh we're imagining it was only
[40:12.960 --> 40:17.520]  in Fox News that we linked to talking about economic collapse and every other
[40:17.520 --> 40:22.800]  major publication but but but but we imagined it see our articles are full
[40:22.800 --> 40:28.040]  of links our articles on average have about 15 times I've done the math 15
[40:28.040 --> 40:32.600]  times the links of a quote mainstream media dinosaur publication I mean if we
[40:32.600 --> 40:36.720]  say something we linked to it and by the way we see a big fat out of control
[40:36.720 --> 40:40.160]  government run by foreign banks raping our country in the world we say
[40:40.160 --> 40:48.600]  something when I see something I do say something so it goes on to say
[40:48.600 --> 40:58.160]  imagining a scenario of economic collapse where sensors could cause
[40:58.160 --> 41:03.640]  disorder if seniors could cause disorder if denied their social security
[41:03.640 --> 41:09.240]  benefits and that's not what we really said in the article we said people
[41:09.240 --> 41:12.240]  getting denied their benefits across the board there would be major breakdown
[41:12.240 --> 41:16.240]  and civil unrest which the media admits on the other side of its mouth they're
[41:16.240 --> 41:21.440]  preparing for as we said in a recent post our office has criminal investigators
[41:21.440 --> 41:25.680]  our special agents who are responsible for investigating violations of the laws
[41:25.680 --> 41:30.680]  that govern the ssa's programs said the Social Security Administration
[41:30.680 --> 41:36.040]  administration but the Social Security Administration statement posted Thursday
[41:36.040 --> 41:40.120]  noted that their agents need firearms at ammo in the course of training
[41:40.120 --> 41:45.320]  investigations and responding to threats against offices and employees so
[41:45.320 --> 41:51.800]  there's this backdrop with people watching Fox News or people reading this
[41:51.800 --> 41:56.560]  where they're like all that bad Alex Jones and that info wars calm and that
[41:56.560 --> 42:04.360]  that evil drudge report calm I mean look they just took reasonable national
[42:04.360 --> 42:10.240]  weather service and Social Security Administration get no little ammo mandated
[42:10.240 --> 42:16.360]  by law or just basic target practice and things that are mandated and here's
[42:16.360 --> 42:21.800]  Alex Jones imagining the end of the world in financial crises so the average
[42:21.800 --> 42:25.560]  person sitting there watching television or reading this thinks oh there you go
[42:25.560 --> 42:30.640]  again being alarmist when our article links to Pentagon drilling for civil
[42:30.640 --> 42:37.160]  unrest mainstream news saying economic collapse on the horizon 1.4 billion
[42:37.160 --> 42:42.280]  rounds over ten times the biggest purchase I've ever done we had that in
[42:42.280 --> 42:48.680]  an article all of it linked and Fox News is just jealous that info wars calm
[42:48.680 --> 42:53.240]  prison planet calm and drudge report calm are well drudge is getting more
[42:53.240 --> 42:57.080]  traffic than Fox News and that we're starting to get up there so you don't
[42:57.080 --> 43:03.280]  control the narrative anymore okay by the way I've got family in the army the
[43:03.280 --> 43:06.640]  Marines you name it they've been doing nothing but training for civil unrest
[43:06.640 --> 43:13.880]  with local police all over the country this is admitted and if we're unable to
[43:13.880 --> 43:18.440]  stop this collapse and what's coming you are going to look even stupider for
[43:18.440 --> 43:23.560]  making jokes about us now there's the article DHS classifies new ammo
[43:23.560 --> 43:29.000]  purchases following controversy federal agency blacks it out see that's the
[43:29.000 --> 43:37.920]  story 1.4 billion rounds oh but they're like oh we bought a hundred and seventy
[43:37.920 --> 43:46.040]  four thousand rounds and then that info wars and it just goes on as concerns
[43:46.040 --> 43:50.000]  about the type of bullets hollow points which expand upon impact the statements
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.200]  of the type of standard issue and being used during mandatory quarterly firearms
[43:54.200 --> 43:57.440]  qualifications other training sessions that's not true you don't use hollow
[43:57.440 --> 44:05.960]  points in your qualification and your training you use a regular ball ammo
[44:05.960 --> 44:13.400]  because it's less expensive and doesn't jam as easy the National Oceanic and
[44:13.400 --> 44:16.720]  Atmospheric Administration know I found itself scrambling respond to a similar
[44:16.720 --> 44:21.920]  report this week about an order for 46,000 rounds of ammo and it just goes
[44:21.920 --> 44:31.200]  on so I'm gonna spare you the rest of the conspiracy theory stuff and I'm quite
[44:31.200 --> 44:36.880]  frankly only got into a handful of stories there is there is so much to
[44:36.880 --> 44:44.400]  cover you know we've got the Justice Department shipping tens of thousands of
[44:44.400 --> 44:50.920]  guns and hang grenades into Mexico but instead the Justice Department is busy
[44:50.920 --> 44:55.840]  creeping around spying on Rupert Murdoch so they can blackmail his media
[44:55.840 --> 45:03.520]  empire into supporting gun confiscation banning semi-autos abortion which they
[45:03.520 --> 45:10.320]  are now promoting many of their show host and here's Politico exclusive FBI
[45:10.320 --> 45:19.280]  probed GOP trip with drinking nudity in Israel and it describes a boat out in
[45:19.280 --> 45:25.280]  the harbor with people swimming in their underwear or fully clothed and they
[45:25.280 --> 45:29.800]  described this and the FBI found that no there that there wasn't anything illegal
[45:29.800 --> 45:37.960]  going on now again this is pure witch hunt stuff that is going on right now
[45:37.960 --> 45:42.640]  try to go after small little petty things instead of the big crimes this is
[45:42.640 --> 45:45.880]  all part of the political battling that's happening and here's what I want
[45:45.880 --> 45:51.720]  to get your take on hit the road Barack Obama and don't you come back no more
[45:51.720 --> 46:01.560]  no more no more no more newsweek cover calls our president and calls out
[46:01.560 --> 46:16.360]  president on failed policy and proclaims all but certain Republican victory
[46:16.360 --> 46:22.720]  appearing on the cover of newsweek Barack Obama looks coy half smiling half
[46:22.720 --> 46:30.600]  surprised gracefully clutching his suit jacket snug over his shoulder it might
[46:30.600 --> 46:36.840]  appear to be some sort of watch advertisement or not for Nile Ferguson's
[46:36.840 --> 46:44.840]  blasting headline hit the road Barack why we need a new president now again
[46:44.840 --> 46:52.840]  newsweek ladies and gentlemen a true dinosaur of deception is only doing
[46:52.840 --> 46:57.720]  this because they know that they're going out of print doesn't I mean I had a
[46:57.720 --> 47:01.240]  newsweek the other day I meant to do a show on the whole thing was pharma ads
[47:01.240 --> 47:08.080]  and government ads government taxpayer money finances it same thing in time
[47:08.080 --> 47:16.400]  magazine I mean literally I was shocked when I was in a local business and saw
[47:16.400 --> 47:23.040]  it I asked the business owner if I could take it and I did so it wasn't a store I
[47:23.040 --> 47:26.720]  could out there somewhere we cleaned off the table was long Queen Elizabeth on
[47:26.720 --> 47:32.240]  the cover and the whole thing was big pharma or government ads I couldn't find
[47:32.240 --> 47:40.720]  ads or any economy it was just drugs and government taxpayer paid for
[47:40.720 --> 47:45.800]  propaganda and it was all anti-family anti-gun I mean it was like it's what
[47:45.800 --> 47:49.040]  you'd expect with magazines in North Korea I mean literally it was like I
[47:49.040 --> 47:52.600]  lived in a alternate dimension where there weren't regular ads and stuff it
[47:52.600 --> 47:57.280]  was just a bunch of propaganda but but that's a side issue they're falling in
[47:57.280 --> 48:01.760]  on themselves they know the public has awoken to them fast and furious has
[48:01.760 --> 48:06.720]  grievously hurt the globalist credibility people are now not believing
[48:06.720 --> 48:11.800]  anything they say and they are hitting the panic switch they meant Obama to be
[48:11.800 --> 48:16.000]  their guy to be the savior to be the guy that they could sell as the black
[48:16.000 --> 48:21.640]  Jesus but as I said the Obama deception three and a half years ago as soon as we
[48:21.640 --> 48:28.880]  exposed him I predicted they would throw him out like rotten food or something
[48:28.880 --> 48:36.240]  out of the refrigerator I was about to say rotten rotten baby diapers whatever
[48:36.240 --> 48:43.560]  the point is is that that's basically what's beginning to happen because they
[48:43.560 --> 48:48.600]  understand that no one is buying into him so the power structure more and more
[48:48.600 --> 48:52.120]  is swinging towards Romney and this is the word that I was getting from a lot
[48:52.120 --> 48:57.600]  of insiders four or five months ago and I told you it looked like Obama was in
[48:57.600 --> 49:02.760]  deep trouble now he may launch a big war and get elected through that he may
[49:02.760 --> 49:07.040]  stage some domestic terror attacks or his controllers will but now because no
[49:07.040 --> 49:11.040]  one would no one would buy it people would immediately look at his people as
[49:11.040 --> 49:16.280]  being the culprits because they do like to talk their hubris his criminals has
[49:16.280 --> 49:22.320]  gotten them they like to brag about fake bin Laden raids they like to leak stuff
[49:22.320 --> 49:27.400]  about Israel they like to leak stuff about hey don't worry donors if he's
[49:27.400 --> 49:30.960]  down the polls there's gonna be a big event we're gonna blame on people mass
[49:30.960 --> 49:34.880]  shootings and bombings yeah it's gonna be blamed on the conservatives libertarians
[49:34.880 --> 49:44.160]  I mean what you thank you for doing that by the way thank you for thinking we're
[49:44.160 --> 49:47.960]  that stupid because when you look at somebody and go you're really stupid
[49:47.960 --> 49:53.240]  you don't see a thing I'm doing just sometimes just sometimes you can get
[49:53.240 --> 49:57.880]  kind of the mind-numbed yuppies to wake up and go what are you making fun of me
[49:57.880 --> 50:03.240]  is something going on me you you can you can do bad things to him but you can't
[50:03.240 --> 50:10.160]  rub it in so the prancing around and the open statements of you didn't build
[50:10.160 --> 50:15.160]  that because they are in control they're up there surrounded by yes men they
[50:15.160 --> 50:19.360]  think that they can do whatever they want and and still I'm not saying we're
[50:19.360 --> 50:23.680]  gonna be in good shape when Romney gets in but this is this shows how desperate
[50:23.680 --> 50:31.320]  the power structure is that because I'm in about a year ago it was pretty clear
[50:31.320 --> 50:35.160]  Romney was gonna be a ringer I mean the media was going to basically use him as
[50:35.160 --> 50:41.960]  a ringer whether he knew he was a ringer or not but now Romney's actually doing
[50:41.960 --> 50:45.960]  things that look like he wants to win like getting Paul Ryan whether you love
[50:45.960 --> 50:50.880]  him or hate him it's a good move so right now barring a big-stage war which
[50:50.880 --> 50:56.320]  could happen or big-stage terror attacks looks like Barack Obama is out but
[50:56.320 --> 51:01.440]  then what is Mitt Romney going to do during the collapse the worst drought in
[51:01.440 --> 51:05.320]  50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half
[51:05.320 --> 51:10.120]  year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only
[51:10.120 --> 51:14.320]  corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising
[51:14.320 --> 51:18.120]  prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of
[51:18.120 --> 51:22.160]  business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to
[51:22.160 --> 51:26.400]  freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from
[51:26.400 --> 51:30.440]  eat foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases eat foods will
[51:30.440 --> 51:34.200]  have to raise prices to now is the time to get your supply I recently increased
[51:34.200 --> 51:37.680]  my supply for me foods direct because we've all known this was coming you know
[51:37.680 --> 51:42.160]  about their delicious long-term storable foods fact is you can eat at any time to
[51:42.160 --> 51:45.680]  save money today and because it stores for 25 years you're locking in today's
[51:45.680 --> 51:51.080]  prices and avoiding the rising food cost don't wait call 800 409 5633 or go to

[53:35.280 --> 53:39.400]  available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of

[54:29.640 --> 54:35.640]  there if because they know the public's waking up and a new puppet it'll take
[54:35.640 --> 54:43.200]  people at least a few months for the gold plating to wear off until they begin
[54:43.200 --> 54:47.360]  to wake up that it's meet the new boss same as the old boss and then Paul Ryan
[54:47.360 --> 54:52.040]  could have come out with his agenda that gets shot down and then the Democrats
[54:52.040 --> 54:56.040]  can fight with Paul Ryan and the average conservative will immediately do
[54:56.040 --> 55:03.840]  whatever Paul Ryan and Romney say because the Democrats are attacking them so
[55:03.840 --> 55:08.000]  it's all just basic psychological manipulation but what is Romney going
[55:08.000 --> 55:13.600]  to do once he's in office and the economic meltdown accelerates you see
[55:13.600 --> 55:19.400]  if the economic meltdown imploded fully I mean really got nasty instead of
[55:19.400 --> 55:26.000]  slowly rotting if there was a flashpoint can you imagine Obama trying to do
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.040]  gun confiscation can you imagine Obama trying to set up TSA checkpoints on
[55:30.040 --> 55:34.920]  highways which they're starting to do can you imagine people would rebel but
[55:34.920 --> 55:39.440]  you put in a new Mitt Romney well he's just doing what he had to do the mess
[55:39.440 --> 55:46.240]  Obama left us and as much as I detest Obama and all of these different
[55:46.240 --> 55:50.680]  characters because they're plastic teleprompter readers there's still just
[55:50.680 --> 55:57.280]  puppets in the final equation and we do ourselves a disservice focusing on them
[55:57.280 --> 56:03.520]  as personalities too much now if you gauge what the puppet masters are doing
[56:03.520 --> 56:07.320]  with the puppet you can read a lot of the agenda it's important to watch these
[56:07.320 --> 56:11.560]  guys and follow what they're doing now I'm going to give the number out we're

[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:32.500]  Alex Jones oh look at this curtain almost got an article critical of Hank
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:36.880]  Williams Jr. I think it's a little too strong but I get Kurt's point I don't
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.760]  control everything my writers do you know I tell people general areas I want to
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.720]  go in things I want to research but everybody's you know got a free hand
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.960]  that basically writes for me as long as they don't get it wrong factually he says
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.760]  Hank Williams Jr. gets it wrong I'm going to print that and I'm going to
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.800]  later in the hour read a little bit of it and I get it he says that Obama is a
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:06.120]  Muslim America hating military hating person and obviously he's not a Muslim
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.280]  folks he's a globalist frontman who's there to stir up the radical Muslims so
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:17.680]  they get the Muslims to kill each other and but I don't really see Hank Williams
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:22.680]  endorsing all the wars and stuff and I think that's where I think that's where
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:26.840]  I disagree with Kurt a little bit but we'll go over all of that coming up I
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:31.200]  think it's important to discuss wow Lord Rothschild betting on Euro collapse
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.440]  we're going to be getting into that huge news Julian Assange and the Brits
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:41.080]  threatening to raid the embassy and their president of the Latin American

[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:52.000]  that's starting to really come to a head and we've also got a bunch of other
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.760]  just really important reports we're going to be getting to on mobile phone

[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.040]  first-time caller but definitely not a first-time listener I've entered a
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:48.080]  couple of your contest and I think you guys are wonderful well thank you ma'am
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:53.120]  what's on your mind today well I was curious have you guys seen the previews
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:03:02.520]  for the 2016 Obama's America it's done by Dinesh D'Souza no but I think I've
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:06.680]  heard about that I need to check into that by the way guys by the way guys it's
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.520]  in the featured news archive I didn't see it in all the stacks about that
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:16.440]  marine on Facebook that made some comments that I don't think were illegal
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.520]  and they came and arrested him it's a big story it's all over the place I meant
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.040]  to cover it this weekend but I didn't and so you get me that so what does it
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.560]  break down I mean basically Obama gets reelected we're in communism or
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:34.240]  something basically I think what they're calling him is an anti-colonialist not
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.920]  so much a socialist or a dictator or it's more that he's wants to abolish our
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:45.080]  way that we have we've had for so many years he doesn't like it he considers
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:52.200]  the West as like great Britain yeah no I see the ideas out there that he's a
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:57.880]  communist he's a Muslim all that is just cover stories the guy is globalist he
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:03.040]  wants to destroy all sovereign nations and create a neo-colonial system oven by
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:10.160]  the bankers really good YouTube video it's called sully interviews 2016 movie
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:15.080]  goers I recommend everybody see it okay yeah I know I I hear you but if you're
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:21.880]  saying that and I appreciate your call I mean if you're saying that Obama wants
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:27.760]  to get rid of colonialism they're invading all of Africa I mean almost
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:33.400]  every country under the guise of helping everyone under Africa calm and that's why
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.120]  Hank Williams is wrong saying Obama doesn't love the military which they
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.560]  imply at war they're invading all over the place using jihadis and you name it
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:47.240]  to do it I mean Obama is a frontman for neo-colonialist but communists will say
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:51.160]  we don't like colonialist you're corporatist or you're capitalist no no
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.960]  these are global mega crime syndicates that actually want to use
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:01.020]  communism the control populations but they're exempt from it sick of the
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:04.720]  globalist you Genesis control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing

[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:42.800]  we have filmmaker Michael Murphy who made a very powerful documentary film
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:48.000]  what in the world are they spraying a few years ago now they've made why in the

[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.920]  gonna be breaking down his research and all the government admissions I mean on
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:10.040]  video that they're spraying as aluminum dioxide barium salts sulfur dioxide you
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:14.440]  name it Bill Gates is getting government money to do this to you so
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:22.960]  we're going to be going over all of that today also coming up there are now
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:30.680]  admissions by a lot of the mainstream media pundits that Barack Obama is out
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:36.000]  of there barring a new war or some big catalyzing event bombing mass shooting
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.320]  you name it and don't think for a minute just because the establishment is
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:45.560]  saying that Obama's out of there that he couldn't pull some trick out of a hat
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:49.840]  or that his handlers couldn't but he's bought and paid for by the very same
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.200]  interests that are bought and paid for Mitt Romney I mean that's on record
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:10:00.360]  that's not debatable I have to say that I'm not a big fan of Paul Ryan and his
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:06.560]  no child left behind his support of Indie AA Patriot Act a bunch of other
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:12.560]  garbage banker bailouts but he has been anti-abortion not just in talk but in
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:17.160]  action and has been staunchly pro-gun at a time where the entirety of Fox News
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:22.120]  punditry that I've seen Bill O'Reilly Bill Crystal the head of news core
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:27.160]  Murdoch Michael Savage on his separate from news core they're all calling for
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:32.720]  banning semi-autos I mean you don't need Sarah Brady or Diane Feinstein when you
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:37.600]  got got people like that calling for it so there's a real move they know
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:42.240]  America is waking up big time and the backlash against Obama and their
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:46.440]  corporate communism they get us into communism where they're exempt off-shore
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:50.520]  and get the corporate welfare see all the terms we've been taught are wrong and
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:57.480]  Carol Quigley at Georgetown others brag about this this is not my opinion but
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:01.680]  don't even mean to plug this but that's where the truth is read the 1400 page
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:07.040]  tragedy and hope that back in print available at info or shop.com read the
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.160]  book that woke me up none there call a conspiracy back in print info or shop.com
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:16.280]  I mean read those it's got the quotes it's got the admissions Quigley loved
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:19.920]  world government he was Bill Clinton's mentor read it how they fund anything
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.000]  authoritarian under different names and they know you'll go okay well I want that
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.760]  fascist one I want the corporate fascist Obama I want the corporate fascist
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:33.400]  Romney when they're bought and paid for by the same people but then you do get
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.760]  into this lesser of two evil quandary where you can say hey I know it's all
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:43.320]  rigged and all-stage but there is truth in that they're putting Romney in right
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.640]  now I mean that's the direction they're going in doesn't mean it's a done deal
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:51.320]  because they know people are on the edge of revolution they write it like a
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:55.640]  teeter-totter everybody's mad at Bush you know the country is on the edge of
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:00.960]  revolution not trust in the government you put Obama in he continues the
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.320]  agenda to the T but with different rhetoric gets caught in fast and furious
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:13.320]  salandra it's Nixonian how amateurous their criminality has been and they had
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:18.840]  been amateurs in their arrogance bragging and you know don't worry big donors
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.760]  keep giving us money even if we're down in the polls we could we could have
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.680]  stage shootings or bombings to blame our enemies I mean they don't say they're
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:28.440]  gonna do the staging they leave one degree of separation there but the
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:33.840]  arrogance level show in comes the corporatist Romney but conservatives I
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:37.480]  mean I've seen none of his stickers around the country they're sick of being
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:43.640]  con they're sick of country club rhino Rockefeller Republicans like Bush senior
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:48.640]  and as bad as Bush senior was Romney is even more openly a globalist it's hard
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:55.120]  to believe but so they bring in Paul Ryan and so it signifies a victory that
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.840]  they even had to put Ryan in there but they would have put somebody just like
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:02.440]  Romney in not that not that Ryan's even good I'm saying the fact that they even
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:07.080]  put him in there shows they want to pacify conservatives libertarians
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:13.240]  constitutionalist the fact that they're moving in that direction shows that the
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:18.600]  system knows people are waking up but now in the next three months I mean we've
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.800]  got to watch this up to the election very very closely because when you start
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:30.560]  getting the Washington Post and Newsweek and all of them everywhere I've
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.680]  seen this the last four or five months start to turn against Obama now it's
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:38.200]  hit a crescendo and they're talking about well let's have a gimmick of a new
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.760]  VP and then Hillary doesn't want it and they're talking about getting rid of
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:50.320]  Biden because of his comments all of this is coming to a head and he's got
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:58.520]  Jimmy Carter written all overing but again they know everybody's tipping
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:03.120]  towards being constitutionalist pro-liberty and so you see the Republican
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:07.960]  Party running in knowing it's okay Obama go ahead and say you want our guns
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:12.840]  we're gonna agree with you we're scared of the public too you see the system
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:16.560]  really gets the fact that the mood of the country didn't put enough with
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:24.680]  anything and so interstage right Romney but no one's biting so you give us a
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:29.680]  Paul Ryan people start drilling down into who he is but then I say morally
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.120]  well at least he's been anti-abortion and while all the Republican leadership are
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.960]  badmouthing the Second Amendment Paul Ryan's coming out for it so do I really
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:42.520]  say oh well
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:48.400]  doesn't matter who you put in I mean that's a question I ask all of you out
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:54.280]  there but I'll tell you this Mitt Romney gets in there he will continue
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:59.000]  everything Obama was doing just with different dressing he the same card
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.840]  different coat of paint same engine same break same same computer system the
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.160]  same people are driving the train folks you just get rid of one ceremonial
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:15.120]  conductor or engineer and you put in another one and people will go back to
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:20.080]  sleep under Romney even during a collapse for a while and so that we have
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.320]  big debates around the office we say do you know obviously you don't support
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:29.400]  Obama because that would be a moral but you but you look at the different
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:37.120]  factors if if Obama gets into office the New World Order will probably
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:41.400]  completely lose the United States down the road but then you argue I don't know
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:45.520]  he's so dangerous the globalist can nuke something making him a dictator they
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:49.480]  can start a race war you know the globalist have been testing beta testing
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:53.920]  all these things that's too dangerous it's the establishment caving in to get
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:58.000]  rid of the open radical and bring in their covert operator meant Romney to
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:04.480]  pacify people so just go back to status quo and I don't know because I'm
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.920]  normally very decisive but because things are so foggy the establishment
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.000]  doesn't even know what to do in fact we see that some of their public
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.040]  communicates that aren't for public consumption but come out data the
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.880]  Republicans don't know what to do at the top the Democrats don't know what to do
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:24.240]  now there's political articles out today where Obama things are moving too
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:28.720]  quick they're off balance the whole system is these are run by arrogant
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:33.200]  bankers who make 40 to one bets with other people's money and sure they set
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:37.080]  up the system of derivatives and said we'll and enslave the countries in the
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.680]  states and we'll bankrupt everything and then have a big police state that
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:45.320]  maintains order and have our cake and eat it too but now that they're really up
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:51.320]  to the point of executing all this entire power structures figuring out not
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.120]  all of them are at the top of the pyramid and even those the top of the
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.840]  pyramid are figuring out hey historically once we get rid of rule of
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:04.600]  law we get eaten so now they're kind of up to the edge of the cliff without a
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.280]  parachute and they thought they were going to throw us off the so-called
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:17.720]  elites finding out no you're going to get a ride to a new Gallup pullout
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:22.680]  Congress's approval rating hits another all-time low last time I checked it was
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:30.360]  nine percent they're always spinning it up and down the point is is that
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:39.840]  Chichescu in Romania had a higher approval rating than that all right
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:43.240]  let's go to your phone calls we're gonna go to break and come back and take more
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:46.760]  of them here I am gonna try to go to your calls now it just I'm throwing out
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:50.240]  these topics you can bring up whatever you want I love spin the wheel the grab
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:54.080]  bag of stuff listeners bring up angle stories I meant to cover that's why I
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:18:00.960]  enjoy your calls let's go to Tyler in New Mexico you're on the air welcome
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:10.120]  hello yes hi this is I was calling because I'm a member of the Korean
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:17.080]  nation and I believe that there's some type of synthetic thing that was made
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:23.480]  having to do with biological warfare well ma'am I don't know what nuclear
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:27.880]  nation is and and then you're saying you believe there's synthetic warfare we
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:32.080]  don't screen call so you're hot on the air with whatever you want to say but I
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:40.000]  don't understand I'm from Dulce I am believe that oh oh oh you live in an
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.600]  area affected by a test radiation yes and I have gone on the mountain and
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:52.200]  actually suffered radiation sickness oh I believe you yeah yeah most the crew
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:59.080]  that shot John Wayne films in New Mexico and Nevada came down with cancer very
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:07.440]  soon after yeah I am I am experienced that I talked with gay bald is the one
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:13.680]  of the state police officers that worked with those issues on the tribe and I
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:17.280]  know that our tribe is well off due to natural resources but for some reason
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:22.040]  they keep saying that our our tribe is going poor and stuff but I worked with
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:26.360]  Wells Fargo and I'm well aware that we have a zero to count and I know that
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:31.000]  because of that our tribe I think could be targeted because of our natural
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.600]  resources and stuff of course of course they pill for everybody and the tribal
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:42.240]  nation leadership around this country isn't speakably corrupt it's very
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.840]  very sad because from day one the leadership's been corrupt because they
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:51.480]  would kill any tribal leadership that didn't sell you out and it is just a

[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:49.960]  I want to hear from people near the side of this shooting. We get the calls. They're coherent. They're intelligent
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.440]  They're insightful, and I'm not knocking the last two callers. I just had trouble making it out
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.520]  So
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:01.840]  If you got a point you got a question you got a comment hit me with it and let's go
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:08.040]  I'm going to Mike in Illinois. Mike you're on the air. Go ahead. Hi Alex. Hey, buddy, you know, uh, I
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:13.320]  I'd like you to check out this mini series called America with the K. Have you seen it?
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:19.360]  Yes, Chris Christofferson made in the 1980s. Yeah, cuz I was looking on the side of one of the vehicles in there
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:23.400]  UN SSU UN special service unit and
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:32.360]  You know based around Chicago and and I'm just kind of amazed as to you know, in my opinion, that's they're bringing us to
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.560]  And you can't really find it online anymore
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:42.360]  No, that's what they do. They bring you into a global government, and then they homogenize the national sovereignty
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:44.360]  They homogenize the local
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:50.000]  Departments the the state departments and then you're under a global corporate government and then meanwhile
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.480]  We're all I better give my rights up the Muslims are going to get me and the globalists are running them the radical Muslims
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:01.040]  So yes, I do remember that mini series and I do remember they have basically the UN coup
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:05.960]  Slash communist coup over the US. The problem is with all these movies like red dawn
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:12.160]  We're looking for a foreign invasion the invasion already happened the bankers
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:18.600]  Have you heard the clips where they brag on TV that they have captured us under a corporate world government? I have
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:24.480]  In fact, they they wouldn't let bells are on CNN. Do we have bells are tomorrow?
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:30.200]  Friday we had to cut bells or his interview short to finish the Dave Mustaine thing and it was pretty amazing to have a
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:37.840]  Christopher Walken pop in as well. But yeah, I saw them cut bells or short because he was exposing a government assassinations of famous people
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.840]  and would just shut up and was defeating
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:43.240]  the
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:47.000]  Globalist with no ratings that he was debating. What's your take on that?
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:52.600]  You know, that is the way we're going and that's why I'm afraid
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.280]  That's why I'm afraid
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:28:02.440]  for YouTube and for the I'm sorry the viewers of YouTube and and so on so forth because they're cutting us off from our
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.720]  avenues of finding out the truth
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:10.720]  Yeah, and for those that just joined us YouTube now is censoring and deleting channels for no reason
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:15.800]  They are allowing people to say my voice is copyrighted by them
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:23.600]  Just my voice randomly and then taking our videos down and if I challenge it, they then give me a strike
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:29.760]  So it's censorship, but they act like they're free and open and it's a communal
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:39.640]  Commons so it's fake advertising. It's false advertising and there's open calls for the cyber security has been called by CNET news
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.520]  That's pretty establishment. That's published by CBS
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:47.960]  The Declan McCullough and others have said it's basically what Putin is trying to do in Russia
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:50.560]  And yeah, because we're getting ready for a global meltdown
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:57.360]  What do you what do you think about the system throwing Obama under the bus or did he throw himself under the bus?
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:03.320]  They push their agenda with Obama. It blew up in their face. So now they're going to a backup plan. I
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:09.320]  Believe that that's their agenda to keep us off kilter
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:16.840]  And I want to say one final thing for you. Let me go. I watched the whole the pale horse
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:20.640]  I ordered it and it brought a tear to my eye with Charlie Daniels
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:26.000]  And I just compel everyone to watch that
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:31.400]  Along with dreams from my real father because that has actually turned my mother-in-law on
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:38.520]  To the truth where she was ignoring me about things. I've been saying to her. No, it's so shocking. Well
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.680]  That film about Obama is amazing
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:45.280]  But the behold the Pell horse that we carry him for our shop calm
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:52.780]  It is shot with cinematic quality and that guy's to shoot national commercials. We're on the March the Empire's on the run

[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.360]  With completely illegal
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:35:02.720]  Open surveillance of everything we're doing being established. We are seeing the globalists systematically attack the family
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.240]  the nation state
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:09.840]  The individual we are being conquered scientifically
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.720]  And I don't feel up to the challenge. I know a lot of you don't feel up to the challenge
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:19.200]  You don't think of yourself as a warrior against this
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:21.920]  It's so big
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  You don't know where to start
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:27.280]  Many of your friends and family it seems are in a days
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:31.200]  Uh or in a wonderland that's from television
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.760]  That trains the mind to be passive
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:37.120]  Uh and it's uh, it's frightening
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:41.360]  Uh this weekend I was over at my parents house
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:44.080]  and one of their friends, uh
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:50.320]  Friends was over there and the guy was asked to me show. I've heard your show for years. Is it for real?
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:52.960]  Is it all an act?
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:56.800]  And I just didn't even feel like validating it or even responding
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.760]  And and people ask me that all the time that's like what?
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:07.760]  I mean the government's bought 1.4 billion rounds of hollow point bullets for us in the last year
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:11.600]  I mean there are army manuals publicly
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:16.880]  That we've linked to that the army has on their website for reeducation camps
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:20.080]  That alone
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:30.480]  Should have everybody out in the streets saying this government's criminal open up all the national security archives shut down the shadow government
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:40.320]  Army manuals current ones for mass training for cordoning cities and incrementally confiscating the guns
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:48.880]  How to shut the power off the water off until you acquiesce
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:53.840]  And this is the type of stuff in fact they just found the army manual pull it back up
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:55.360]  I'll read people the code
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:57.520]  You scroll down a little bit that's got the code right there
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.320]  In the first paragraph of the article
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:09.760]  Fm 3-3940 you can click on that the recently unearthed link right there
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.520]  The recently unearthed link
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.240]  And you can read it
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:20.560]  I mean this is the type of stuff that we're dealing with here and
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:28.480]  I was at Barton Springs the other day and ran into a ton of listeners
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:31.120]  People couldn't even recognize me with a mask on
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:35.280]  Snorkel mask I swam laps with a snorkel mask on
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:39.120]  And
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.560]  If I talk to my children people just flock up or they hear my voice
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:47.200]  And most of them are oh, thank you. Oh, yes, we saw the documents over waking up
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:51.280]  But others will just walk over and go. Oh, yeah, do you really believe all this stuff?
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:55.520]  And I'm like believe it you see they think that if you believe that it makes it real
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:38:00.560]  Like if I say, oh, no, they're not trained in the military to go house to house and take our guns
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.960]  I choose not to believe it
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:13.360]  And this fellow was saying to me yeah, I used to listen a lot and he really had me sucked in
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:17.840]  And I said yeah, that's because I'm sucked in
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:26.320]  You know, I hope the preparations for total martial law they're taking place
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.920]  Are just a backup plan for the criminal globalist
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:36.640]  I hope they don't drop the hammer because I'll tell you what the entire architecture of this thing looks like and I'm going to your phone calls
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:46.640]  It looks like what the Soviets did to Christians from 1917 to about 1935
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:56.000]  Why do they wipe out whole areas of the families the farmers because they were self-sufficient and they had a culture
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:00.240]  And the and the establishment wanted to just get rid of it and depopulate
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:06.640]  And everything the globalists do is to destroy this country and to shut it down
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:12.400]  And our military is not our military anymore. It's being forged into a weapon to be used against us
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:21.040]  And you know, that's what people like Hank Williams jr. Go wrong. He's like obama's a muslim. He hates america. He wants to destroy our
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:31.440]  Military and all this obama works for the same foreign banks that have captured our executive our
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:36.720]  Judicial to a great extent the legislative and the bureaucracy
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:45.200]  And they'll rearrange puppets all day long, but still the same people are in control and they're very bad people
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:51.360]  They're into the fact that they have to stain for the public. They think you're weak if you have a soft heart
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:58.720]  They have more compassion for animals than they have for humans and we're in a lot of danger
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:03.120]  So here's a little news flash of you're an old-time listener or a new listener
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.720]  I 100% believe what I'm saying here
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:11.360]  The only thing I'm guilty of is holding back
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.360]  I
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:16.080]  Felt guilty inside
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:22.080]  Whenever Dave Mustaine came here and did a taped interview three weeks ago back when the story would have been ten times bigger
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:26.240]  After it was like a week after the batman shooting
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:34.800]  And he'd heard me talking about all the evidence he'd seen it and he said in the interview if they do fast and furious they do anything
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.600]  They should be investigated for this
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:43.920]  And he was leaving in a few days. I edited it, you know the thing together. It was an audio interview
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:50.160]  And I just cut that out he didn't ask me to
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:54.720]  So there's your answer it's worse than I say, okay
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:41:00.160]  I hold back you want to know the truth the only thing I'm guilty of is holding back and certainly not
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.720]  embellishing
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:06.800]  And I just think about how dangerous all these naive childlike trendies are
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:10.320]  They're all so good at acting cool. They're all so good at
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:16.400]  Navigating the pop culture, but they don't know how to skin a buck. They don't know how to run a trot line
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:18.640]  They don't know
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.640]  anything
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:25.680]  Except how to live in a very narrow social spectrum and
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.320]  I think about the great depression in this country
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:31.920]  Major universities estimate 7 million people died of malnutrition or
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:35.760]  Starvation associated or illnesses associated with malnutrition
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:38.480]  In the 10 years of the really
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:44.240]  Hardcore depression in this country when the bankers turned off the economy on purpose to consolidate power
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:50.000]  That's what we're in now. They're just slowly turning everything off
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:54.240]  And 90 percent
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:42:02.960]  Right at 90 were agrarian and somewhat self-sufficient. If not entirely some of them now we're 90 percent exact numbers inverted
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:08.320]  Urban and half of those that are rural are self-sufficient 5 percent
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:16.400]  You know, I told the story last week I never finished a story that I'm going to your calls I went
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:21.440]  To Barton Springs, you know, I'll kind of go through these cycles where I go somewhere a lot and I don't go there for years
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:27.280]  But I've been going there and swimming laps because the lake's just too darn hot to drive out to the lake and swim a couple of miles
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:29.840]  and
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:39.920]  I'm watching all these weird women
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:46.720]  Henpeck at each other and with their kids and everyone's like so anxiety filled even talking to each other because they've never really lived in the
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:49.200]  In a real world. It's so artificial
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.800]  And and and women cutting in front of each other and people acting neurotic and you get up to the thing you say hi
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.400]  How you doing today?
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:58.400]  And the young woman behind the counter goes
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:05.920]  You say, um, well great and then you pay for yourself and your children you say, thank you and they say nothing to you
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:11.680]  And then I looked at my son and I said son back when we still had communication skills before people only watched television
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:13.920]  She would have conversed with me a fellow human
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:19.040]  But she's been dehumanized and the woman was looking at me very angrily at at that point
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:24.960]  Richard Reeves was actually there with us as well. He saw this and I watch and listen to the young people
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:30.080]  And I played that Facebook ad
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:34.960]  Where you face-can to buy and sell and the voice of that narrator. Can you pull that up?
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:39.280]  That is the voice of where in the new trendingness
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:46.000]  You you don't use full words like they don't just say when you say thank you now to a waiter. No problem
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:49.280]  Not you're welcome
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:51.600]  Now they say prob
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:55.200]  Just is not a problem
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:59.200]  Now they say prob
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:07.280]  Just as 1984 says the language has officially been reduced and I listen to them and I watch people young people
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:12.560]  And just like rednecks will talk more and more redneck to be more redneck than the other
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:16.640]  I mean people in Texas 100 years ago because I've heard recordings of it. They sounded like I do
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:22.480]  This is a real texas accent. This is what somebody not trying to put an accent on sounds like this is a texas accent
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:27.360]  Okay, this is it right here and my family's as texas as it gets 1830 both sides
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:30.880]  This is a texas accent
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:33.840]  Okay, which is a southern gentry english accent
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:39.520]  But the point is is that you go out, you know deer deer hunter or whatever and gals will be like
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:42.320]  One guy goes I'll tell you what boy
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:48.160]  Other people will do that till I outdo them. Well, let me tell you what the yuppies are now doing
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:51.520]  The yuppies are now going
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:58.960]  And you act weak the weaker and more pathetic you act the more powerful
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:03.760]  The patheticness the not caring to have your eyes artificially act like
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.400]  You're not fully conscious
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.400]  That is wisdom
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:15.840]  Being pure weak nothings that that that don't even pick their feet up when they walk they slide their feet
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:17.840]  The austin slacker is the
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:25.120]  Ultimate weapon of the new world order just people begging for the new world order to release a bio weapon and kill them
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:28.720]  I mean, can you imagine in a collapse what these people will be like?
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:38.800]  Can we play some of the voice because this is what the woman behind the counter sounded like exactly this is our enemy here it is
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:48.480]  So why haven't facebook check-ins gone mainstream check-ins provide a powerful mechanism for businesses to deliver discounts to loyal customers
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:52.960]  But few businesses and even fewer customers are taking advantage of this
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:59.280]  So we set out to evolve the check-in process by creating a seamless method for checking in
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:02.720]  Now see now see if you want to be even more trendy than him
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:06.960]  You have to stop using language entirely or just go with
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:09.680]  Uh or probe or uh
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:11.360]  and
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:18.560]  These people i've seen it if you're aggressive and informed and actually have a backbone they they like flutter off
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  Like like flying roaches or something that are that are
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:26.160]  and oh and
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:32.640]  A lot of these yuppies now just look at everyone with disdain or or you'll be in a parking lot and they'll ask you a question
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:35.120]  check-ins provide a pop
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:37.120]  They'll ask you a question
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.360]  And
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:50.400]  You'll answer them and then they'll look at you like they feed on the old american the old human that's friendly and talks
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:54.480]  They see that as a sign of weakness. It's almost like junior high with mean junior high kids
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:59.360]  Ignoring the other kids, but they're not in junior high anymore and they're powerless showing accounting coup
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:06.240]  They'll engage you in a conversation just to get you to talk to them so they can put their nose up and walk away from you
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.640]  These are the type of people that get in the fast lane
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:16.080]  And go 20 miles under the speed limit and then when you finally get around them they speed up
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:24.000]  They are spiritually begging for airborne Ebola. The dr. Pionka ut talks about being released on them to kill them
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:26.880]  That's how he talks by the way. He you can barely understand him
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:31.200]  It's a spiritual deadness and they want the sacrament of death
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:34.080]  In fact, if you talk to them, they all think there's too many humans
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:37.600]  And a lot of them actually are embracing their destruction. So
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:43.920]  All right, I've really just been out of control today. I took two days off got a lot of sign
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:49.040]  They actually relaxed and uh, it's hard coming back when you have a mini vacation
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.480]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to chuck and oklahoma chuck. I appreciate you calling. What's on your mind?
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:48:01.200]  Hey, Alex. What's going on, man? Worldwide transmission. Thank you for holding while I was babbling about the trendies
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:06.160]  Oh, you're fine. You're fine. I enjoyed listening. I'm just sitting up here at work just uh
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:11.360]  Hanging out with a little bit of downtime. So I thought I'd just share a little bit of things that are on my mind with you
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:15.280]  I just had a few questions. I was going to ask you and then I could probably just take the answers offline
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:18.560]  So I don't take up too much of your oh, you're not taking up too much of my babbling. Go ahead
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:22.240]  Okay, one of the first things I was going to say was is uh
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:29.280]  Uh, you know, do you think it would possibly be a good idea to possibly, you know, rally all of our troops all your listeners each month and just
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.400]  Uh, kind of get her try to get everybody together and just do like a
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:37.760]  A protest once a month that for every state in their capital just that way, you know
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:42.880]  One state may you know, everybody meets up at uh at the state capital every you know one time once the month
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:46.800]  Yes, we need to we need to get out of our coma our trance and and and
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:49.680]  rediscover
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:53.920]  Liberty. I mean if they're admitting FEMA camps and reeducation centers
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:58.640]  We need to demand mainstream corporate prostitute media cover it
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:01.440]  Until it actually hits the news
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  And we need to continue to demand it
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:10.240]  I mean we need to get aggressive people. I mean again, I go back to this cities where they laugh at you about fluoride
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:15.920]  You need to march in there and go look you yuppies only listen to harvard. Here's harvard saying cancer and brain damage
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:20.400]  You put them on notice and then you sue them when they don't remove it
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:28.000]  Because the courts allow non physical violence. That's what that is. They're assaulting you you have a tort
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:30.800]  You assault them back with the legal paperwork
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:36.720]  It's time to get aggressive short of physical confrontation because if we won't pick up the pen now
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:42.000]  We will never pick up the sword and we're going to end up getting into that position. I'm sorry go ahead
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:48.800]  I couldn't agree with you more another good idea that I thought might be a great idea was have you ever thought about going on tour?
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:52.000]  Just doing like, you know, kind of like my what michael jackson was kind of playing on
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:57.600]  At the end of each concert just go out go to each state kind of like what you and charlie shane did when y'all gave y'all's great
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:49:58.880]  Uh
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:01.440]  Demonstration of you know what y'all believed about 9 11
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:06.080]  I mean if you just went to every state and held just you know a big conference, you know conference like that and
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:10.800]  Yeah, that was for charlie went off the rails. Unfortunately. Here's the deal. I got an old bus
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:16.720]  Um, I went to a few places. I just cannot get the amount of work done. I can't hear
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:19.920]  Uh at this office. I'm trying to get people trained
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:25.920]  Overall, they're doing a pretty good job trying to get a whole new crew in I've just been I can't do the new gun show
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:32.080]  I can't do all the other programs. I can't get all the reporters hired and cody after everybody and get everything done
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.680]  I can't even get radio ads on the air. Okay
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:42.560]  So I've got to create some type of organization here where I can just get basic stuff done to be able to operate
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:45.280]  But yes, I'd like to be able to go on tour
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:51.600]  Uh, but I mean really it's it's up to you guys folks the FEMA camps through there. They're training to take your guns
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:53.920]  What are we going to do about it?
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:56.240]  Sharon

[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:26.960]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts

[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:47.600]  Remember these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar powered
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:50.320]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise

[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:45.920]  Thank you, alex
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:50.240]  I love you and thank you for your dedication and sacrifice, but I have some ideas
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:53.200]  We need a dream team of lawyers
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:57:00.160]  With the american public that's awake as the plaintiff and we need to file lawsuits in mass
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:02.960]  On the irs the federal reserve
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:06.080]  one over posse common tautus
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:10.560]  And either one or two bush elections. That's not even counting 9 11
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:13.440]  and
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:16.080]  I would also donate my own money to
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:22.560]  a fund a reward fund for finding any information or any
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:26.480]  Evidence in the photographs of the 9 11
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:29.200]  Pentagon
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:31.840]  Finding any plane wreckage whatsoever
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:34.800]  That's what woke me up
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:36.320]  that fact
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:38.320]  and also
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:40.320]  If we could with all the celebrities
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:44.400]  That believe and that have enough courage
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:46.400]  And are brave enough
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:54.720]  We could fill a huge stage and have a freedom aid or a liberty and freedom aid like farm aid or live aid
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:58.080]  And with a huge screen
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:05.680]  Showing pictures of the pentagon. We're dealing with the brain damaged public. We have to get back to basics. This is so complicated
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:10.800]  It makes my head spin. I'm not that smart, but it makes me
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:18.000]  Physically ill so the rest of the brain damaged public they just don't understand if they would ever wake up
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:20.480]  No one where I live is awake
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:26.640]  Say they would think that I was crazy for for talking about this. Well, ma'am
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:29.840]  Number one, you don't sound stupid. Number two
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:34.320]  You sound extremely informed and a lot of those are good ideas
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:42.960]  The big thing is trying to get a bunch of celebrities that do something's like herding cats. You are listening to gcm

[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.960]  Folks with what's been going on in this country. I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:04.960]  That's in the mainstream news every day
[01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:10.640]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:16.960]  That's pushing the grid beyond its capacity. I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:21.280]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:28.080]  Right now our good friends at solutions from science are offering huge savings on their best-selling power hub unit
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:34.160]  In fact, I think it's the best deal. I've ever seen them make. It's literally thousands of dollars in savings
[01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:38.160]  Remember these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar powered
[01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:40.960]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:48.800]  Info wars listeners can get all the details at beat the blackouts dot com. That's beat the blackouts dot com

[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:07.680]  Big brother mainstream media
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:11.040]  Government cover-ups you want answers?
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:13.360]  Well, so does he

[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:35.120]  We are joined by michael murphy to help put together what in the world are they spraying?
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:43.120]  Excellent film we carry at info warshop.com on kim drills and now the new one just came out. Why in the world are they spraying?
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:47.440]  And of course they put the film out for free yesterday when it officially was released
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:48.720]  It's on youtube
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:54.400]  But they have links there at info wars.com if you choose to support the filmmakers who traveled all over the world
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:59.920]  To make this documentary film we're going to be breaking it down with him coming up in the next segment
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:03.120]  And the biggest thing you can do is support the alternative media
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:06.800]  Thomas in kansas. Thanks for holding welcome
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:12.320]  Hey alex are you i'm just blown away by how crazy everything's getting
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:17.520]  I'm gonna tell me about it man. Hey, uh, I was listening to a a long time listener
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:23.840]  Appreciate everything you're doing and I uh, actually just put your info wars.com on my truck. So i'm
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:27.040]  i'm pretty, you know stoked about that but uh
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  anyhow, my question was it's like
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:36.640]  It's more of a comment, but I was listening to a radio talk show host at island named jan michelson to be heard of him
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:39.040]  I don't believe some
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:47.200]  Okay, well, he was interviewing a neurosurgeon who had broke broken down like paul ryan's alternative plan to the affordable health care act
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:56.160]  And according to what she was saying, it's not much different than paul ryan's plan is not much different than obama care
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:02:02.960]  And I thought it was kind of interesting what she was saying. I don't know, you know, the real fine details of it, but
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:10.080]  Um, yeah, well, he supported the prescription drug thing. He supported no child left behind all of it federal takeover
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:14.720]  I mean paul ryan is called ultra conservative nowadays
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:17.760]  And he'd be like a democrat
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:22.160]  Uh of the uh, you know 1970s
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:25.120]  Um
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:30.160]  I mean he he says he's anti-abortion and he's against us paying for that
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:38.320]  And he's pro-gun and those are good things, but I mean look they wouldn't be look everything that's happening is because the globalists want it
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:43.040]  And so of course, he's not going to be picked unless they're comfortable with him
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:49.040]  And he's just there to get conservatives to think mitt romney's okay, but then again, what do you do vote for obama?
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:51.360]  well in a way of
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:57.440]  Of obama stayed in we probably beat the globalist because it was they would go so far it would fully wake up people
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:02.800]  Now it's going to be sleepy time when mitt romney gets in sleepy time
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:08.160]  All the police state gains all of it. It'll suddenly be forgotten about
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:13.760]  And the democrats will start talking about about the police state and wireless wiretapping again
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:18.000]  And then I'll be called a liberal by the media today. I'm called a right winger
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.040]  But all I want is liberty
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:26.640]  They got a little more question for sure go ahead
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:31.440]  Uh, I was watching the prostitute decepticon media rachel maddow
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:34.320]  and she had like this whole
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:41.680]  Uh segment on paul ryan being a big iron rand fan and I I find that hard to believe considering he's basically
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:47.760]  Everything kind of iron rands stood out against you know concerning many of paul ryan's
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:51.840]  Issues now. I mean it's well no see see see look
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:01.280]  You know the head of raids against the machine wears red stars which has killed more people than the nazis
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:02.880]  You know that that symbol
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:08.000]  It has been the front of the signet the logo of the greatest killers in history
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:14.560]  They do it because it's seen as cool. Well with libertarians and constitutionalists. I ran and all that is seen as cool
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:16.800]  So yes, it's it's a camouflage
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:23.600]  That paul ryan wears and then when they left a tax paul ryan people see that and think well, he must be good
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:25.920]  I mean it's theater, sir
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:30.160]  See this and just speak to what you're saying. I could I was gonna bring this up
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:34.000]  the interesting part about all this I'm seeing patterns of
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:39.920]  Infiltration among the old republican guard into the libertarian
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:46.400]  Uh, you know pro freedom movement. Yeah, what's happening is we're the biggest thing in this country now
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:48.240]  so
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:52.320]  They are merging the real tea party with the establishment tea party
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:55.360]  and the pauls
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:59.360]  Are attempting to take it over but the opposite is happening. It's more of a merger
[02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:06.320]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record
[02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:09.760]  78% of the midwest corn belt is in drought conditions
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:15.040]  Not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:20.080]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices
[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:26.320]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:29.920]  For me foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:33.280]  Eat foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:37.440]  I recently increased my supply for me foods direct because we have all known this was coming
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:40.240]  You know about their delicious long-term storeable foods
[02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:44.880]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it's stored for 25 years
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:50.800]  You're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost. Don't wait. Call 800 409 5633

[02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:08.640]  Start purifying your water with propure my friends

[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:50.160]  What in the world are they spraying and it's available at info warshop.com discounted if you want it
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:56.000]  But now they have a brand new one and they love liberty. That's why they put the film out for free this weekend
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:02.640]  At youtube in conjunction with info wars.com. We posted it for free the entire film
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:10.400]  Up at info wars.com, but we say buy it at info warshop.com to support us and the filmmakers
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:17.440]  Why in the world are they spraying not what in the world? They answer that in the first one. Why are they doing it?
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:21.520]  They have the globalist in here admitting they're doing all this. It's unbelievable
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:29.600]  Very powerful film the two go together to understand the geoengineering not terraforming as the planet's already habitable, but uh, the
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:33.440]  Geoengineering as the white house
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:39.840]  Science czar john p. Holdren calls it the same guy that says poison the food and water to sterilize us
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:46.240]  We're going to go to him in a minute, but first, you know, I was pointing out earlier that newsweek is going out of print soon
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:54.960]  Uh, that when I have been reading a newsweek at you know dental offices in places that I have noticed that there's nothing in them now
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:56.960]  but big pharma ads
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:01.120]  And government ads or bank ads that are funded by government
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:04.080]  Taxpayer money, so if you're watching at prisonplanet.tv

[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:26.640]  But we are streaming video right now at prisonplanet.tv
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:32.800]  Here's that newsweek from june 4th and 11th. So this is over a month old actually a couple months old
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:34.800]  But I I just wanted to show you
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:37.360]  You know jubilee gal
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:43.680]  And you open it up. There is a AT&T ads. So it's got a few corporate ads in it. British Airways
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.720]  And then you got peace cores that are now doing fema core full-page ad government
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:55.440]  Peace core gov. Now that's for overseas. They've now set up fema core
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:11:00.480]  Literally to be spies and tattletales as part of the rural councils and the rest of it
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:03.520]  And you continue here
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:12.640]  It's a skin cancer foundation ad see drug company ads you name it never why is everybody getting cancer?
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:15.520]  It's oh, we've got a treatment for you
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:19.920]  And then it's all about facebook a whitewash on why they were going to soak you
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:24.240]  Donate the gift of life give your organs
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:28.320]  Or now they found if you go to the hospital hurt, they'll kill you
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:32.720]  That's come out my dad told me that as a physician when I was a kid and I didn't believe him
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:34.800]  Even though I believe him on most things
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:38.400]  And then later it came out in the news. They were killing people all over the country for their organs
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:40.400]  That's the US Department of Health and Human Services
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:43.040]  Health resources
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:45.520]  And service administration again
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:50.320]  Most the ads drug companies or government continuing
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:56.080]  Whitewash on Penn State and that government op
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:01.360]  You got one ad for big fans the end of the trendy fan
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:04.080]  Now here's another one blue cross blue shield
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:06.720]  You know how great Obama healthcare is
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:15.040]  You've got all of these big insurance companies and HMOs that are at your service
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:27.600]  A bunch of property ads
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:34.400]  You've got articles that are the real ads here propagandizing how great the attack on Syria is the all the ads
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:39.360]  You've got them recycling and claiming they were against the bailout, which they weren't
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:46.320]  Here we've got the National Museum United States Army Army history.org. That's government
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:52.320]  You've got worship the queen
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:55.120]  Right there who was the enemy of our army
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:58.640]  Not our army in any way
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:04.400]  It's her army. You've got the silent killers how great the drones are
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:11.680]  You've got a USO ad until everyone comes home. I mean this is what you'd expect in a third world collapsed
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:16.400]  You know dictatorship is you open the major magazine and it's just government ads and drug ads
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:20.640]  This is your tax money paying for this seat and brain and spine
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:23.360]  Institute so medical ads
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:30.240]  This is your tax money paying for this seat and brain and spine Institute so medical ad because they're soft killing us
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:32.880]  a newsweek ad
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:38.720]  Here is another military ad
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:48.160]  How great the Department of Defense Veterans Affairs is some propaganda just about how they've got the best medical system in the world
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:53.040]  Of course, you know, it's one of the worst in the world, but hey, they've got a full page ad so it must not be true
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:55.840]  They got an ad about getting rid of people and how
[02:13:56.720 --> 02:13:58.720]  You know euthanasia is basically wonderful
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:06.000]  Uh, I mean, this is just like what's she reading in north? Oh an ad for Colin Powell. How great he is. Oh, isn't he wonderful?
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:15.760]  And then you've got a another vote for creativity vote for empowerment vote for companionship vote for good
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:19.440]  And it's a non-profit ad and then you've got a
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:23.120]  James Bond watch you can get if you're really super trendy
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:29.120]  So that's why they're going out of print because there's nothing that government ads so and drug company ads there you go
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:33.680]  Okay, enough of that. I just promised to get to that
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:36.080]  Now I'm gonna bring up Michael Murphy
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:38.560]  to the airwaves because hey
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:44.560]  You know, we told you forever that they know that you get a seven-fold increase in bone cancer and mental health
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:48.320]  Increase in bone cancer and men three-fold increase in women. This is just what's totally admitted
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:52.720]  They've known that since the 20s massive IQ reduction. It could be upwards of 20 points
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:59.680]  Uh, if you're drinking sodium fluoride or the different variants of that in your water at one part per million
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:04.480]  Uh, but most areas have higher than that Harvard study finds lower IQs
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:07.120]  fluoride lowers IQs
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:09.600]  And they go over more than a dozen studies
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:14.000]  Uh and talk about us being brain damaged. Yeah. Well, let me explain something else
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:20.400]  Uh, aluminum is very bad the barium salts sulfur dioxide. That's all being sprayed on us bill gates
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:23.840]  Just dumped a bunch over new mexico a few weeks ago on a big drill
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:26.000]  and uh
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:30.640]  You know, you get 10 15 deaths from west denial that like it's the end of the world start spraying all the major cities
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:33.840]  With pesticide that's been proven to not even really reduce the mosquitoes
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:36.640]  but um
[02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:42.080]  This is all part of the bureaucracy where there's this this this quiet bureaucracy, but it's admitted. It's just
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:48.480]  Most of it's classified. It's admitted the programs are admitted the details remain shrouded
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:55.360]  Tens of billions though. It's another form of corporate welfare to spray pesticides aluminum dioxide barium salts
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:57.440]  stuff on us
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:01.760]  Uh, and then if you talk about it, you're crazy even though we have countless clips and they have them in the films
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.520]  Of weather men and women pointing out this isn't a normal weather pattern jets are up there spraying something's going on
[02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:15.360]  We live in a manipulated society the russians admit they do it the chinese do it in dubai they control the weather but here
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:19.840]  It's admitted and again, they have the science are all of them talking about it
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:23.120]  But then exactly what they're doing is still classified
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:28.080]  And then they just have articles about how we're crazy because we think they're spraying a show
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:30.480]  They had the first film what in the world are they spraying?
[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:32.800]  um, but um
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:37.040]  Now there is a new film put out directed and produced by michael j. Murphy
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:44.160]  No, produced and edited by barry kaloski. I think i'm pronouncing it right and he joins us now
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:46.320]  so we
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:50.480]  Found out what they were spraying so recap briefly that and then talk about when we come back from break
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:57.600]  Why now, you know, they tell us why they're spraying at their own conferences their own documents, which they think the lowly
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  You know suboyed uh, eloy
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:05.280]  Uh, aren't reading, you know while we're running around watching tv. They're killing us and laughing about it
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:12.240]  Uh, so good to have you with us. Mr. Murphy. Oh great to be on and alex. Thanks. Uh, thanks again for covering this really excited that
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:15.600]  Your partner ain't working with us and getting this message out to people
[02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:22.720]  We uh, those of us who have been researching this we believe there's been no greater assault on the planet and contrail
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:25.520]  Uh, do a deniery program. So thanks again
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:29.920]  Well, it's uh, it's good to have you here with us. We're going to do a different phone line
[02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:32.720]  We go to break with you because this one's breaking up a bit, but uh
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:39.520]  From your last film break down the findings of what in the world they're spraying then we'll come back with why in the world?
[02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:40.800]  Are they spraying?
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:47.280]  You got it and and since we released the first film hundreds of brains out now are coming in from around with people from around the world
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:52.400]  People have been taking brain tests. They're a very good indicator of atmospheric contamination
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:56.080]  And what people are finding are massive quantities
[02:17:56.720 --> 02:18:00.240]  of what's now being called the chemtrail geoengineering footprint of
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:02.880]  aluminum, barium and strontium
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:06.160]  These metals match the number of geoengineering patents
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:10.480]  That have been designed to specifically spray these metals into our sky
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:13.120]  They match what geoengineers
[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:14.240]  state
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:16.320]  They want to spray but deny that they're spraying
[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:21.920]  And then what we see in the sky on a daily basis in terms of these long white trails that do not dissipate
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:23.920]  They actually spread out
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:25.520]  In block our sun
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:29.520]  Is the stated goal of geoengineers? We now have an issue called global dimming
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:33.120]  The earth is now receiving 20% less sun
[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:37.600]  Then it did just a couple of decades ago. And again, that's the stated consequence
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:43.760]  Of geoengineering. So that's what we're finding in the rain, which is very toxic to both human health
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:50.080]  And ecology, but there are a bunch of consequences. Obviously with this we covered some of them
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:52.080]  in the first film
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:53.920]  In what we're seeing
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:19:00.480]  In terms of these consequences that you know, it's very open about they're all coming to fruition. So hopefully we'll get into that
[02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:02.960]  during the interviews today
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:09.760]  You know, that's the funny thing the media makes fun of people and and and we've done for a request others have and we've seen
[02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:12.240]  You know the threat fusion centers
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:17.040]  Well, we've seen the threat threat fusion centers
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.840]  sit there and
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:23.760]  Make jokes about people to think planes are spraying, but then it's all going on
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:29.040]  I mean, this is a government that's killed our military killed foster children and spraying tests and
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:33.600]  Radiation tests and then now they admit giant programs that are classified
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:39.200]  And then we're supposed to just sit here and let them do this and clearly the aluminum is going up in the soil
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:41.280]  but Monsanto's got
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:43.760]  the
[02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:46.960]  Aluminum resistant crops they can make money off of
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:52.720]  A clearly aluminum is increasing neurological disorders. That's only one small part of the program
[02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:59.600]  They can weather weapon us and then say oh look at the global warming. Hey lord Rothschild trillions and he'll fix everything. We'll be back
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:05.840]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins that bears repeating

[02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:04.800]  Hello, this is ty bouldinger author of the best-selling book cancer step outside the box
[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:07.600]  I want you to know some very important information
[02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:13.440]  In 1985 president ronald reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the white house
[02:21:13.840 --> 02:21:16.880]  At a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer
[02:21:17.440 --> 02:21:22.400]  Now 27 years later carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:27.360]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17
[02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:33.920]  Naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell
[02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:38.480]  If you want to stay healthy now is your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells
[02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:41.440]  To attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:49.520]  Call 1-866-Venus fly or order from carnivora.com. That's c a r n i v o r a dot com
[02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:52.800]  That's 1-866-836-8735
[02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:59.520]  1-866-Venus fly or visit carnivora.com protect your immune system. It's the only one you've got
[02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:04.960]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years. We have an alarm system and all of our doors have dead bolts
[02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:09.040]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about five minutes
[02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:14.640]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our tv jewelry and my guns
[02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:17.680]  I kept thinking what if my family had been home?
[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:22.240]  The police officers said that more than 85 percent of break-ins are through a door
[02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:24.960]  And that dead bolts alone don't stop intruders
[02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:31.120]  The officer told me to go to easy armor dot com if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder

[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:32.960]  But my dream
[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:34.960]  Is empty
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:40.960]  As my conscience
[02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:46.960]  Michael Murphy is our guest filmmaker. Why in the world are they spraying?
[02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:54.000]  First film what in the world are they spraying? They're both important questions. What are they spraying?
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:57.600]  Other question. Why are they spraying?
[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:05.280]  And there's the weather weaponization factor. We know our weather is the most manipulated in the world
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:09.760]  More money more ground antennas more aircraft
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:17.200]  Massive program harps involved and that's all in the patents. It's all in the admissions the billions a year spent
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:22.080]  But uh, if you criticize it, they just laugh at you and say it doesn't exist
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:26.560]  Even as they have public forums bragging about what they're doing to us
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:32.800]  And that's why Michael Murphy, uh, who was on a hotel line. He's on a cell. It's a little bit better
[02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:36.400]  Joins us from Sacramento, California up from Los Angeles
[02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:41.040]  Because they're they're handing out copies of why in the world are they spraying to the entire legislature
[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:47.520]  Which is an effective thing to do you're putting them on notice at the feds under the department of energy and others
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:51.360]  Are doing this they also have got patents for 50 years
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.040]  Or more standardizing having an added to the jet fuel
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:26:00.320]  Dispersed through the engines. They have other direct spray, but but dealing with weather modification
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:08.400]  Michael, uh, you know a big part of it that's admitted is the ground-based antenna arrays that are interacting with what's being sprayed
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:12.720]  So let's get into it right now. Why are they spraying?
[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:18.720]  There are a number of agendas associated with these programs weather control appears to be
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:24.080]  Uh, the number one agenda and since we released the first film many people were asking that question
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:29.600]  So I uh, I met up with um meteorologist former 20-year weatherman Scott Stevens who's been
[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:35.600]  Uh researching this and what we noticed ahead of stormfront whether 500 700 miles
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:41.360]  24 to 72 hours ahead of these storms very intense spraying they get these sick canopies
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:44.240]  Those are days when you have burning eyes your ability
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:46.960]  A dry mouth, you know a lot of the symptoms
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:53.840]  Anyways, what we learned and you had mentioned something we interviewed dr. Nick baggage who is the leading heart expert
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:56.400]  Through the use of of aluminum
[02:26:56.960 --> 02:27:03.600]  Of course the engineers are stating that aluminum is reflective. It's very light and it will reflect sun away from earth
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:08.320]  Now what we found that is true and it will cool the planet temporarily regionally
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:13.760]  Now studies have come in a university studies NASA studies not that I totally trust NASA
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:18.240]  But they indicate that putting aerosols. Yes, we'll cool the planet again regionally
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:22.560]  But uh, they will create no overall warming of the planet because at night
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:25.280]  They act as a blanket and a trapeze
[02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:31.280]  We've seen a great increase in nighttime highs in the past 10 to 15 years when these programs have been really ramped up
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:35.440]  What we found out about aluminum is the very effective conductor in our sky
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:42.160]  So when they when they build this canopy of aluminum through again the use of heart and other technologies
[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:45.680]  They can actually heat the atmosphere real similar to
[02:27:46.320 --> 02:27:52.800]  Putting something in your microwave. Um, the the molecules will vibrate those heat and when an atmosphere heats
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:59.520]  It actually raises and it creates a low pressure vacuum and enables certain corporations to steer
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:04.640]  The arms into certain regions or the case of this summer, especially here in the u.s.
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:08.320]  Out of certain regions now the science is very basic
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:12.320]  As well what we learned and I went back into the geoengineering
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:18.320]  Eighth and several hours listening to them. We learned that one of the consequences is
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:23.680]  Disruptive weather pattern throughout is a consequence of geoengineering
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:28.400]  A couple of reasons when they spray these aerosols into our sky and if you look
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:33.520]  Off of the coast this summer. We have a complete aerosol coverage
[02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:40.800]  Every day all the way from the equator up to the north pole. Why are they doing this? Well, and by the way as you know
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:46.720]  They even have the nasa photos showing and not even regular plane routes the lines off the coast every time
[02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:50.480]  There's a system to block it. They admit now the earth was 20% now
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:56.800]  It's 30% darker and they say oh the jet trails are doing it, but they don't add that stuff's being added
[02:28:56.800 --> 02:29:01.680]  So they're blocking the jet stream and all that water and the lower atmosphere trade winds
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:05.280]  Bringing water into the u.s. We are under attack
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:11.760]  You got it and can those aerosols are preventing the sun in the case of this summer from hitting the ocean
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:18.320]  Which is preventing the normal evaporation the water that does evaporate and geoengineers are open about this
[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:21.760]  The particles act as what's called cloud condensation
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:28.640]  Nucleide so instead of the water evaporating combining with other water molecules and eventually condensing and falling this rain
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:35.840]  They condense on this aluminum barium other particulates that they're spraying. All right. Stay there your your phone's really bad
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:39.280]  So i'm gonna come back. We're gonna find out when you can do video skype
[02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:42.880]  Next week is i want to get you on maybe even for an hour and a half
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:48.560]  But this is just too important a subject to hammer like this and we'll just go to phone calls and cover news
[02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:53.200]  We're on the march the empire's on the run
[02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:56.880]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:02.160]  Hi, this is alex jones
[02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:07.520]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle?
[02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:12.400]  Did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:30:12.640 --> 02:30:17.840]  It's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[02:30:17.840 --> 02:30:23.040]  So our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[02:30:23.520 --> 02:30:30.480]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family
[02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:34.480]  And here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[02:30:34.720 --> 02:30:38.160]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden
[02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:47.840]  So visit them today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:52.080]  That's 877-327-0365
[02:30:52.960 --> 02:31:00.000]  Remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is alex jones for survival seed bank dot com
[02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:03.760]  alex jones here with a very important announcement for tree speakers

[02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:08.000]  You've heard alex explaining how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self produced colloidal silver solutions
[02:32:08.480 --> 02:32:15.920]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body
[02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:20.640]  My name is mario safaldi and i'm the developer of the silver lungs generator
[02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:25.680]  Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:33.600]  It also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[02:32:34.240 --> 02:32:36.240]  This includes the eyes ears

[02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:22.400]  It's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:29.360]  You know my friends michael murphy's new film why in the world are they spraying a compliment to the original film
[02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:33.840]  What the world are they spraying is a very important documentary because
[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:36.720]  We are seeing weather patterns that are abnormal
[02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:41.920]  The very groups doing the spraying are the ones saying they want to take over our society because of
[02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:47.840]  Worsening weather patterns and we would just pay them for carbon dioxide. They would make everything okay
[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:52.320]  We're being held hostage. They're playing god. This is how out of control
[02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:58.080]  The national security state has gotten and our guest has gone to different forums and events with the globalist
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:01.280]  Where they're publicly bragging their engineering. We know they are
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:06.960]  His phone is just bad and i don't like doing interviews on crackly cell phones
[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:12.880]  That's not translate welder m and f m affiliates. We don't even like regular phone lines now. We try to do audio skype
[02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:20.800]  Or video skype or other systems is the in lines you name it most radio shows just have hammered audio
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:23.200]  We try to give you high quality guest
[02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:26.080]  So we're going to finish up with five minutes with our guest
[02:34:26.480 --> 02:34:31.280]  And have him back up next week or maybe later this week for a full hour as soon as he can get to a good place with good internet
[02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:36.000]  Uh, and we'll go to all the callers. I got a bunch of news here now
[02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:39.120]  Hillary ordered, uh
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:41.760]  Um
[02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:43.760]  Been lot and killed. I mean they've changed this story
[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:46.000]  So many times
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:49.680]  It's a joke. We're gonna be getting into that a lot of breaking news right now and your phone calls
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:55.680]  I briefly wanted to plug a couple things here. We have launched info wars team.com is a great website
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:34:57.840]  But it's also got the distributor angle
[02:34:57.840 --> 02:35:03.600]  You can sign up there and get discounts on all the young jevity products the beyond tangy tangerine polymers polymers plus
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:07.440]  Uh, the key proprietary blend of essential fatty acids
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:10.160]  All of it there at info wars team.com
[02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:17.520]  But we designed a site with the young jevity folks and mz is people who also designed info wars team that
[02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:21.280]  That I think is even better
[02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:26.000]  Uh, and it's more around the great products themselves. You can also sign up there and be a distributor
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.400]  Uh, it's 10 bucks and then get discounts
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:34.240]  Um, and there's a phone number there if you have any questions on the whole line the whole giant catalog everything
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:40.720]  Offered by young jevity at discounts right now at a new website info wars health dot com
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:45.920]  We'll get a link at info wars team dot com to info wars health dot com
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:48.560]  Again, that's info wars health
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:51.040]  dot com
[02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:56.960]  Is available, uh for everybody online now and the whole product catalog is right there for you
[02:35:56.960 --> 02:36:01.760]  But also join the info wars team reorder you can get discounts and get free shipping when you do the auto ship
[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:04.240]  A lot of different discounts that we offer
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:10.080]  At info wars team dot com but also info wars health dot com going back to michael murphy michael
[02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:15.440]  Look, let's just hit this key point now. We're seeing all sorts of weird weather patterns. You've got weather
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:22.880]  Uh, you meteorologist in your films breaking down. You know, this is this is this is weather manipulation. They're spraying something
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:28.240]  Uh, we know this is going on the antennas on the ground the stuff in the air
[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:32.000]  And then as you said you go to these events and it shows them bragging
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:36.400]  What they're doing and then and then the water's not coming into the coast
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:40.320]  And they're shutting off water at klamath falls that is available
[02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:46.960]  And they're paying to move general motors overseas and they want carbon taxes on us that won't be on china and india and mexico
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:52.800]  I mean the clear policy is destroy america. What what is the goal there?
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:57.600]  Uh, you mean in five minutes break down the keys that you cover in this new film
[02:36:58.240 --> 02:37:02.240]  A couple of things and geo engineers have denied that these programs have been started
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:07.680]  But i've spoken to many scientists geo engineering can be used to control and corporatize the weather
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:12.880]  The first time i heard about that i said why would somebody want to want to control our weather and it was explained to me
[02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:19.120]  Uh, militaries have been interested for several years about controlling our weather system of battlefield
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:27.680]  Advantage there was actually an edmont reading back in the 70s prohibiting military from using this against other countries in wartime
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:33.360]  There is a uh an exemption allowed countries can use this technology of their own soil
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:38.800]  Um and and because weather can be manipulated for for thousands of miles away
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:44.720]  It's a very effective tool to be used so that exemption allows them to use this what we found in the film was
[02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:50.080]  Totally shocking. We found a monetary interest as well as a gmo seed interest
[02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:55.280]  Would you explain the monetary interest whether it's being traded at the chicago mercantile exchange?
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:57.360]  So we went to chicago
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:04.880]  Interviews a trader and what we found was shocking. Uh corporations individuals are are essentially betting on the weather
[02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:08.480]  They're betting that will be drought or or uh, access moisture
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:12.240]  Uh engines certain seasons and through the use of these derivatives
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:18.960]  They can literally make billions of dollars through predicting weather. So a lot of people think our weather is now predictable
[02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:21.440]  Uh, essentially a long-term
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:26.080]  Investment in that is the furthest thing from the truth not everybody who's involved in these derivatives
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:32.400]  Uh are in the know but certain individuals are uh that are linked into the multinational corporation
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:38.640]  And if you have the playbook, you cannot lose every commodity is driven
[02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:42.880]  By predictability of whether those who invest in corn
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:46.960]  This year are literally making billions and billions of dollars
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:52.480]  At the expense of every living thing on the planet. Uh food prices are going to go up over 30 percent
[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:56.080]  Uh here and more importantly, it's allowing them
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:02.400]  After betting and knowing where it would go to consolidate and buy everything up and use food as a weapon
[02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:04.880]  That's what these guys are doing
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:10.640]  Well, that is the main goal of this and it goes deeper. So money is just an avenue to get what they want
[02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:12.960]  What these programs enable them to do?
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:19.680]  Because they control where water goes where it doesn't it's a very effective tool for agendas 21 in the case of this summer
[02:39:19.680 --> 02:39:25.440]  Which we amazingly spoke about the film route again is is uh what geoengineers say
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:29.840]  Is the consequence of their programs or operations make a ton of money about drought
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:33.040]  But what we found was that seed by monsanto
[02:39:33.440 --> 02:39:37.200]  Uh in in this address is abiotic stress. What is abiotic stress?
[02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:42.560]  It's everything that geoengineering creates. It's the drought condition is heavy metal
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:47.440]  Uh contamination these particles fall into our soil and essentially sterilize our soil
[02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:50.480]  So we have the ecosystems now around the world collapsing
[02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:56.560]  Of the interviewee uh farmers that we interviewed in the film have seen between a 60 and 70 percent decline in their ability to grow
[02:39:56.640 --> 02:39:58.000]  natural organic food
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000]  Things are dying. So that forces
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:04.080]  Farmers when they start losing their crops to do two things they can sell it
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:09.520]  Uh and there's a company now owned by george soros. He's buying up the farmland of pennies on the dollar
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:11.680]  very effective
[02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:17.840]  tool uh for meeting agenda 21 objective and the other area that they can build is into these new
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:21.920]  abiotic stress resistance genetically modified seeds
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:27.280]  Which have been designed by monsanto. This is a corporate takeover
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:34.400]  Of natural systems monsanto through the obama administration expressed their interest in going into africa
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:39.680]  Amazingly enough geoengineer states if we start our programs, which obviously they have
[02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:42.240]  We will get droughts in africa in asia
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:49.280]  We have a solution. They're stating monsanto and they've expressed their interest. It's completely corporatizing that
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:54.080]  And i'm going through, you know, the entire film in about five minutes for alex
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:59.200]  This is so insidious in one name. I have to say it's because I am just burning up
[02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:07.520]  It is uh many of us know him as bill gates bill gates now is on public record funding geoengineering programs
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:12.000]  Destroy our soil and make it impossible for people to grow natural organic foods
[02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:17.440]  Bill gates also invest in monsanto. He is making not only a ton of money
[02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:24.720]  What they're doing is attempting to use the authority of god or the authority of nature. That's right. They are playing god
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:28.560]  Creating a monopoly use food as a weapon state department random
[02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:35.440]  200 is their licensure to engage in this and the magnitude of this is so huge
[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:40.880]  What I want to do is I want to get you on next week when you can do skype because this interview crept up on me
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:45.600]  Anyways, I watched your film last week and was blown away by it. I think it's probably even better than the last one
[02:41:46.080 --> 02:41:51.840]  Is more hardcore because I knew the stuff that's in this film when you made the last one you guys just kind of ease into it
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:55.600]  This stuff's really hiding in plain view. What you're saying is not your opinion
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:42:02.320]  He's getting taxpayer money to then go spray the united states and play god
[02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:09.200]  They're doing it in other parts of the world now the film in hard copy is available at info warshore.com or info warshop.com
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:14.480]  Or link through an info wars.com, but you guys know there's no future if we don't beat them
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:20.320]  That's why you put the film out for free on youtube this weekend and you can just go in fact
[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:25.680]  I'm going to have a dawn one of our writers and web guys because it was up over the weekend. I'll have them repost it
[02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:28.320]  As the top story right now
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:30.320]  I hear in the next five minutes
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:33.920]  Yeah, just ask a dawn to repost what in the world?
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:36.960]  Or why in the world are they spraying the new one?
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:42.560]  Up on info wars.com. It was it was already on the front page saturday and sunday
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:46.160]  I want it. I want to have at the top story right now so everybody can get it for free
[02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:50.320]  And then if you think it's important I want to have a hard copy. They can't remove off youtube
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:54.560]  Be sure and download it off there and keep it, but also get the high quality dvd
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:58.000]  It's a very powerful film and again, let's do an hour
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:01.920]  Let's do an hour and a half since I'm cutting you shorter because of problems
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:07.360]  Because I really people to hear this in clear in clarity and you should give us like 10 exhibits
[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:09.360]  Maybe tell one of the guys
[02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:12.720]  You know send maybe Rob do or you know the head of the nightly news
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:18.640]  A clip sheet off what we ought to grab out that you want to mention and we'll play clips on the air of it
[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:20.880]  I think that's really the way to
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:25.600]  Cover this because I don't want to just talk about this. We kind of move on. This is really happening
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:31.360]  And just like they're putting all the cancer viruses and the vaccines and the gmo's changing our gut flora
[02:43:31.760 --> 02:43:39.040]  Bill Gates is all invested in that. This is the total globalist program and at every level they're invested in it. They're doing it
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:41.440]  Not just to make money, but to take over
[02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:45.520]  So thank you so much for spending time with us. Michael Murphy
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:48.320]  Why in the world are they spraying the new one?
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:52.720]  Michael Murphy, uh, why in the world are they spraying? Thank you so much. We'll talk to you soon
[02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:56.560]  Alex appreciate everything you're doing. Uh, thank you
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:44:03.360]  So much. We love you. You've got the great work and I look forward to expanding on a lot of these issues next week
[02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:07.120]  Yeah, you bet. I mean you travel around you guys are always traveling around you want to come to austin
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:10.240]  You're gonna fly out here. I can't afford to uh pay for the ticket
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:11.920]  Uh
[02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:16.240]  Like you know what if we could get a screening because we encourage I do a couple of things
[02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:18.640]  We encourage people around the world to do screening
[02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:21.280]  And I'd love to speak at a screening
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:26.800]  We also because the dvds available for free we encourage people to copy make copies and hand up for free
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:30.800]  We're here in Sacramento at the capitol today. We just released the film
[02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:35.440]  We've got over a hundred free dvds. We're bringing them to our state legislator
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:40.640]  So if we can plant plant some activism into this event, I would love to come out
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:47.440]  Sure. Sure. Well, just if you're ever in austin come into the studio, but we'll we'll just video skype when you get to a place with
[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:52.720]  Good internet and a good computer. We'll test it the day before and then we'll get you on. Thank you so much for joining us
[02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:58.160]  All right, let's uh jam in some phone calls here and we'll come back from break and hit the news
[02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:02.400]  Uh, there's a whole bunch of it here. I haven't even really talked about uh
[02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:07.120]  Homeland security spying on info wars.com. I I woke up
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:09.920]  Saturday morning and saw news headlines
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:12.720]  Not on my website other places
[02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:14.880]  Uh, we're one of our uh listeners
[02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:17.680]  did a foyer request
[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:20.400]  And found homeland security
[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:28.080]  Threat fusion centers watching info wars.com. Well, really that's a no-brainer
[02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:33.840]  But but you just get a mindset into what does the v for vend uh, you know v for victory mean?
[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:39.760]  Where is he going to attack us? And then they sit there and say he claims it was used by the french
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:45.200]  Resistance, I don't claim anything and it's just it's written in like a five-year-old level
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:51.840]  And uh, you know, he claims there's a global government. Really? I claim it. I mean, I don't know what to say anymore
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:57.520]  But I wish you guys would watch the government white slavery rings and and stop that
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:03.920]  And and and stop that and then always get idiot comments going what about black slaves or white slavery means sex slavery folks doesn't nothing to do with the skin color
[02:46:04.720 --> 02:46:06.720]  Um, this former marine
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:13.280]  Was picked up by the feds over facebook post about 9-1-1 and there he is family shot video of it
[02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:18.800]  They took him to the mental institution because he said 9-11 was an inside job and then a revolution was coming
[02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:25.200]  What are you going to arrest the queen's rike because they have a song revolution coming revolution coming
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:27.200]  Revolution coming
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:32.320]  Um, but they got him in the mental institution now like the old Soviet Union. That's business insider
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:36.320]  Anyways, I always say I'm gonna go to your calls. I start covering the news right away
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:42.000]  Uh, let's talk to real caged. You're on the air. Welcome. What's on your mind today?
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:47.440]  Answering the question that was posed by the documentary. You have to have a
[02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:50.240]  an understanding of the term
[02:46:50.240 --> 02:46:55.120]  Scorched earth scorched earth is an umbrella policy which contains
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:57.280]  geoengineering
[02:46:57.280 --> 02:46:59.280]  9-11 globalism in general
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:01.520]  genetic mutation
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:04.240]  Monsanto and what all these have in common
[02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:08.160]  Is the fact that they're all biblical in nature
[02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:12.000]  Um, no, no, that's right. I mean just to back you up
[02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:19.200]  It's called full spectrum dominance our full spectrum scorched earth the globalists call it that they are attacking us poisoning us
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:23.680]  While giving themselves treatments and cures and then posing as the saviors
[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:31.600]  Consolidating the economy as they heard us. It's kind of like ancient man chasing after willy mammoth stick and running them off a cliff
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:38.560]  Through fear. They're running us off the cliff so they can societally pick our bones and they are murdering all of us. Yes. Go ahead
[02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:44.880]  You spoke earlier also of Paul Ryan and I in a semi positive light now
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:47.760]  knowing all that we know
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:49.760]  Okay
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:51.760]  I want to give you the opportunity to
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:53.360]  to
[02:47:53.360 --> 02:47:58.400]  Substantuate your comments based on his abortion rhetoric and his pro-gun rhetoric
[02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:02.960]  Uh, you you followed later speaking that you're not going to hold back anymore
[02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:08.000]  And in my opinion that if you choose between ball and mohawk
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:12.320]  You're still part of the 9-11 beat it to go ahead. I'll let you take it from there
[02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:18.080]  Oh, well, I well listen I hold on because I mean because I specifically want to hear what you have to say on this subject. Um
[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:21.280]  I'm saying that
[02:48:21.600 --> 02:48:24.880]  I was actually looking at it from the perspective of what does it mean
[02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:30.800]  Not not not supporting anybody, but what does it mean that they're getting ready to throw obama under the bus?
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:32.640]  politically
[02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:35.600]  That's because they've he's already gotten as much as he can
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:40.480]  In a power grab for the globalist and now they want to act like all the bad was obama
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:42.640]  So that so that the anger dissipates
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:49.680]  So I was saying if obama stayed in you'd probably see the new ruler thrown out because it would be so over the top
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:52.160]  The system wants to put a romney in
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:55.520]  Because people will go back to sleep
[02:48:56.640 --> 02:48:58.960]  I was simply saying what do you do morally?
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:03.280]  When I could say the difference between romney and obama is basically nothing
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:06.160]  with paul ryan
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:07.520]  um
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:14.080]  You know, I mean he has been anti-abortion and he has been pro-gun at a time that other republican leaders are calling for gun restrictions
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:16.320]  So I'm saying
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:20.720]  What is your view of that? I mean I was actually throwing that out for callers
[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:25.680]  My view is is that having an understanding of the things we talked about
[02:49:26.800 --> 02:49:28.800]  We have to come
[02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:30.880]  To a consensus
[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:33.520]  That that there is no lesser or two evil
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:38.880]  We have to stand for what we believe in talk about it every day. Quit talking about these non issues
[02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:44.160]  We know ryan romney's a non issue. We know obama what he is
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:46.160]  We have to look
[02:49:46.160 --> 02:49:49.600]  To the future and I believe that without
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:54.240]  Jesus christ and us having faith in jesus christ
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:50:00.080]  There is no other outlet to survive. Listen. I agree with you and I appreciate your call
[02:50:00.080 --> 02:50:03.360]  I mean, I don't know what else I could say. The problem is
[02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:08.960]  Finding jesus because you don't find him in these devil churches that are 501c3 government run
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:12.160]  Telling you each week to worship government and do whatever it says
[02:50:13.040 --> 02:50:16.400]  And actually badmouthing the christians in rome who got thrown to the lions
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:19.520]  I mean they teach that on tv now
[02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:20.480]  um
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:23.440]  So I can't sit here and say go good. Jesus is going to save you
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:28.320]  Because people will just go run to the churches that are literally run by the new world order
[02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:31.040]  So I have to qualify it when I talk about it
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:32.240]  um
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:35.440]  You know in the bible clearly i'm not gonna start preaching here, but this is key
[02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:41.120]  Jesus says when they say hey, you know god gave us the understanding that you're you know, you're his son
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:44.480]  He says i'll build my foundation my keel on this
[02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:49.120]  That god jesus is in you not through some preacher
[02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:52.640]  Well, they spin it and then say oh no, you know the rock is built on peter
[02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:59.280]  So that the church can put itself between you and god just like the Pharisees did and you're back to square one
[02:51:00.960 --> 02:51:06.560]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record
[02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:10.000]  78 of the midwest corn belt is in drought conditions
[02:51:10.160 --> 02:51:15.280]  Not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices
[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:20.320]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices
[02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:26.560]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods
[02:51:26.640 --> 02:51:31.920]  From e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise prices too
[02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:33.680]  Now is the time to get your supply
[02:51:33.680 --> 02:51:37.760]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming

[02:53:11.120 --> 02:53:17.840]  Now after less than one year. I am completely off of procec. I learned that mercury is the toxin that causes brain damage and depression

[02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000]  Revolution calling
[02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:29.760]  Yeah, well don't say that
[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:32.720]  If you're a former marine
[02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:34.960]  He said 9-11 was an inside job
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:37.520]  That a revolution was coming
[02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:40.960]  They came and grabbed him
[02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:43.760]  It's a pretty big national story
[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:50.080]  It took him directly to john randolph psychiatric hospital in hope well, virginia
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:58.320]  Everybody knows the government never stages a terror attack. They need to arrest the london guardian riders who were reporting on a declassified
[02:54:58.640 --> 02:55:00.480]  false flag attack plans
[02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:06.400]  Maybe arrest anybody who doesn't love their government and take all their shots, you know, I get what the last caller was was
[02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:09.040]  discussing
[02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:15.520]  I mean, there's geoengineering going on. They're poisoning the food in the water. They're giving us gmo that sterilizes all the rodents. They feed it to
[02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:17.840]  our
[02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:23.120]  Every disease is skyrocketing. We're being killed and we're discussing paul ryan mitt romney. Yeah
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:25.280]  exactly
[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:28.480]  Paul ryan mitt romney. I'll guarantee you don't even know about the whole agenda
[02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:31.760]  They won't even be told about it until they're actually sworn in
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:35.280]  but
[02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:43.520]  It's so massive that all of this really is window-dressing but you know, I do talk about some parochial issues
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:48.720]  Because general talk radio listeners on xm and over a hundred stations
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:54.480]  And they're not going to fully you know every day just talk about the chem trails and the cancer viruses and the
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:00.160]  Again if I'm guilty anything it's holding back. I mean, I'll be honest with you
[02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:07.200]  Um, people think it's I'm exaggerating or fear mongering. They have no idea. I mean, it's the globalist
[02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:14.160]  That's why they leave me on air is because they've got a giant program that they're killing us. It's all under national security
[02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:22.480]  And and it's just off the chart. It's like it's all rearranging deck chairs. They're so committed. They're underground bases. They're cog
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:26.400]  Uh, the public show dumbed down. I I I mean, I've
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:28.400]  I've
[02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:34.560]  And it's not like I even consciously hold back. It's it's how do you sit here and hammer the full magnitude
[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:38.080]  Of this
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:40.640]  That's why it's so stupid when a cop pulls you over and says
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:44.400]  Might have I searched the car for guns or drugs?
[02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:48.320]  First thing I say is well, you know full well guns aren't illegal in texas
[02:56:48.880 --> 02:56:52.720]  And you know full well, you just ran my license plate while I sat here for five minutes
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:57.760]  And number two, I don't use products shipped in by the government
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:05.200]  In fact, I meant to play a little gi Joe clip the old gi Joe intro where it's like fighting cobra who wants global domination
[02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:08.560]  Cobra is who might as well run our government
[02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:15.680]  And all the weird stuff I remember that cartoon as a kid that cobra was doing is actually what the globalists are doing
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:18.320]  And I realized it's all was predictive programming
[02:57:18.320 --> 02:57:23.200]  Just to condition us so that people's brains had already been accustomed to something
[02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:25.600]  So you'd be acclimated to it when it happened
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:28.960]  And people who don't understand propaganda would say well
[02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:33.440]  But cobra is in a bad light it doesn't matter
[02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:39.120]  Even if something's shown to you in a bad light when it really happens 30 years later
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:43.680]  You are more comfortable with it and your mind expected it to come
[02:57:43.680 --> 02:57:49.520]  It's like making a friend of death. You're not as afraid of it. Well, the shoe goes the other way
[02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:54.880]  You know the other foot where they can bombard us with bad things in an entertainment line
[02:57:55.520 --> 02:57:58.400]  And then people can't respond to it when it really happens
[02:57:58.560 --> 02:58:00.320]  It's like violence on tv
[02:58:00.320 --> 02:58:05.600]  Desensitizes people where they don't care anymore they can watch their neighbor hit by a car bleed to death for 30 minutes
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:10.160]  And oh, they don't want to miss the gym. Let's somebody else take care of Ralph out there bleeding to death
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:13.200]  and
[02:58:13.200 --> 02:58:16.880]  We're in a trance. We are we're in a matrix science fiction movie
[02:58:17.280 --> 02:58:22.880]  I mean, we're not in pods the programming's through our eyes and our brain giving us a false reality though
[02:58:23.120 --> 02:58:26.400]  I mean, yeah, it's matrix level. I I don't know what you say to a matrix
[02:58:26.880 --> 02:58:28.880]  That's why i'm not even worried about him killing me
[02:58:29.520 --> 02:58:32.880]  Because it's so beyond that it's so
[02:58:34.080 --> 02:58:35.440]  surreal
[02:58:35.440 --> 02:58:37.940]  How crazy reality really is
[02:58:37.940 --> 02:58:39.940]  Shh
