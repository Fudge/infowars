[00:00.000 --> 00:12.440]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:12.440 --> 00:18.400]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.400 --> 00:35.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.000]  The breaking news.
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.000]  Stay at home.
[00:37.000 --> 00:39.280]  That is the order tonight from four state governors.
[00:39.280 --> 00:42.880]  You absolutely must stay at home.
[00:42.880 --> 00:44.680]  You must stay at home.
[00:44.680 --> 00:47.800]  All gatherings are canceled until further notice.
[00:47.800 --> 00:53.040]  I have issued an executive order, it's not a suggestion, it's an order.
[00:53.040 --> 00:58.040]  We will shut you down, we will cite you, and if we need to, we will arrest you and we will
[00:58.040 --> 01:00.040]  take you to jail.
[01:00.040 --> 01:05.960]  This means no weddings, in-person services, or even parties.
[01:05.960 --> 01:10.200]  The time for educating people into compliance is over.
[01:10.200 --> 01:16.360]  I'm using my power as governor under an emergency declaration to order you to close.
[01:16.360 --> 01:18.200]  Everything will be mandatory.
[01:18.200 --> 01:21.320]  I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this.
[01:21.320 --> 01:27.360]  Those few bad actors will be identified and the Tampa Police Department will handle it.
[01:27.360 --> 01:34.360]  We're watching you and we are going to take decisive action.
[01:34.360 --> 01:39.960]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on, for your mind.
[01:39.960 --> 01:44.280]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information that's powerful, and I hope
[01:44.280 --> 01:48.760]  that you pay attention to what we cover here, minute by minute.
[01:48.760 --> 01:51.480]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[01:51.480 --> 01:55.000]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.080]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[01:58.080 --> 02:03.160]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[02:03.160 --> 02:08.840]  Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed,
[02:08.840 --> 02:12.640]  mandatory quarantines, checkpoints.
[02:12.640 --> 02:16.360]  I think it's in the other documents, but this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation
[02:16.360 --> 02:21.000]  documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and force vaccines, and the hell we're
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.360]  already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments
[02:24.360 --> 02:27.120]  back from these eugenics madmen.
[02:27.120 --> 02:31.520]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[02:31.520 --> 02:35.040]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[02:35.040 --> 02:38.960]  You're not going to be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[02:38.960 --> 02:42.720]  It's scary.
[02:42.720 --> 02:47.160]  One thing the NFL really plans to do this year is take as many precautions as possible
[02:47.160 --> 02:51.720]  just to keep everybody safe and that starts with a vast majority of teams deciding already
[02:51.720 --> 02:56.240]  that there will be no fans at all allowed inside the stadium for the games and every single
[02:56.240 --> 03:01.320]  player in the league has been given a smart tag tracking device to help them keep their
[03:01.320 --> 03:05.680]  distance off the field and for contact tracing should it become necessary.
[03:05.680 --> 03:08.520]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[03:08.520 --> 03:11.240]  Fans are not excited about this kind of idea.
[03:11.240 --> 03:12.240]  No fans.
[03:12.240 --> 03:13.240]  Yes.
[03:13.240 --> 03:14.240]  But they may have to get used to it.
[03:14.240 --> 03:18.600]  But all around the country there will be empty stadiums and masks on the sidelines.
[03:18.600 --> 03:20.400]  No fans will be allowed in.
[03:20.400 --> 03:26.240]  I can't imagine how he playing in the NFL this day and time with no fans there.
[03:26.240 --> 03:28.560]  I honestly can't even conceive that.
[03:28.560 --> 03:30.880]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[03:30.880 --> 03:34.240]  You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[03:34.240 --> 03:36.040]  Don't get the vaccine.
[03:36.040 --> 03:37.280]  You can't go to the supermarket.
[03:37.280 --> 03:38.560]  Don't have the vaccine.
[03:38.560 --> 03:39.560]  You should.
[03:39.560 --> 03:40.560]  Can't go to the ball game.
[03:40.560 --> 03:41.560]  Don't have the vaccine.
[03:41.560 --> 03:47.520]  Can't go to work because everybody in the establishment will still kind of halfway
[03:47.520 --> 03:49.800]  listen now and go listen right about everything else.
[03:49.800 --> 03:50.800]  Maybe we should look into this.
[03:50.800 --> 03:53.280]  Look, you'll believe it if they release it.
[03:53.280 --> 03:59.320]  So just remember this transmission then the Orange County Coroner's Office is investigating
[03:59.320 --> 04:03.840]  the death of a woman who passed away several days after getting her second Moderna vaccine.
[04:03.840 --> 04:09.040]  She died after suffering blood clots just over a week after receiving the AstraZeneca
[04:09.040 --> 04:10.040]  vaccine.
[04:10.040 --> 04:14.560]  Her 58-year-old mother died less than an hour after receiving the Pfizer vaccine.
[04:14.560 --> 04:18.600]  My little sister just died her first dose.
[04:18.600 --> 04:23.040]  And in Orange County, an x-ray technician has died after getting his second dose of
[04:23.040 --> 04:24.680]  the Pfizer vaccine.
[04:24.680 --> 04:28.480]  His dad died four days after getting his second shot of Pfizer vaccine.
[04:28.480 --> 04:32.160]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion.
[04:32.160 --> 04:37.400]  I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[04:37.400 --> 04:43.080]  I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[04:43.080 --> 04:47.360]  You really need to get vaccinated.
[04:47.360 --> 04:49.800]  Don't resist when they release a bio-weapon.
[04:49.800 --> 04:56.600]  Submit and die with pleasure.
[04:56.600 --> 04:59.840]  Infowars, Tomorrow's News, Today.
[04:59.840 --> 05:02.680]  Well, I look fantastic, sir.
[05:02.680 --> 05:03.680]  Diet force?
[05:03.680 --> 05:05.680]  Diet force is amazing.
[05:05.680 --> 05:07.960]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[05:07.960 --> 05:11.520]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[05:11.520 --> 05:17.600]  And diet force has helped me move those bits like under my pecs, my belly.
[05:17.600 --> 05:20.440]  I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[05:20.440 --> 05:28.800]  Man, if you're struggling to get chip shaped for the ladies, mate, diet force is the go.
[05:28.800 --> 05:33.240]  You have to get the diet force and have two a day and just keep at it.

[06:37.160 --> 06:41.240]  Infowars and your host, Alex Jones.
[06:41.240 --> 06:44.840]  Tomorrow's news today.
[06:44.840 --> 06:49.800]  It's Thursday, February 16th, 2023.
[06:49.800 --> 06:53.600]  I'll be here in live in the next four hours at a bone shroyer, 3 p.m.
[06:53.600 --> 07:01.280]  Central, today on the Infowars Radio TV slash web network.
[07:01.280 --> 07:07.000]  You know, last night after my daughter went to sleep, I did a couple hours research there
[07:07.000 --> 07:08.000]  on my desktop.
[07:08.000 --> 07:18.520]  And without even looking, I saw Elon Musk and Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and then
[07:18.520 --> 07:24.160]  all these world leaders as well, both those promoting it and those saying it was bad.
[07:24.160 --> 07:27.880]  Just talking about the world government and the new world order and how the private corporations
[07:27.880 --> 07:31.200]  are running things and want to take control of our bodies and lives and how we've got
[07:31.200 --> 07:34.400]  to form an opposition against it.
[07:34.400 --> 07:39.400]  And just like that, all the pre-programming, all the brainwashing, all the lies saying
[07:39.400 --> 07:44.120]  never talk about a world government, never talk about its agenda, all the intimidation
[07:44.120 --> 07:47.560]  of decades and decades and decades failed.
[07:47.560 --> 07:55.200]  And at the world government summit that ended just two days ago, Elon Musk beamed into the
[07:55.200 --> 08:01.560]  event and said, I'm against your world government and it's dangerous and will collapse the planet,
[08:01.560 --> 08:10.520]  which is its plan to take control, a new feudalism, the technocracy on its ashes.
[08:10.520 --> 08:15.000]  And so it's an amazing moment here and how many times have longtime listeners or regular
[08:15.000 --> 08:27.200]  listeners heard me say, my mission, my primary mission that I started out with 28 years ago
[08:27.200 --> 08:32.840]  will be complete when we at least have the world government out in the open and there's
[08:32.840 --> 08:38.400]  major opposition against it and it's normalized to realize it exists and to stand against
[08:38.400 --> 08:43.760]  it because its goals are bad for humanity when I say bad, that's an understatement.
[08:43.760 --> 08:55.720]  And so I'm not obsolete, I'm not vestigial, I've not been made irrelevant yet, but that's
[08:55.720 --> 08:58.480]  my goal.
[08:58.480 --> 09:03.400]  That my understanding and my knowledge that many other great men and women before me understood
[09:03.400 --> 09:08.360]  before I was born, but was only known by a tiny one tenth of one percent of people in
[09:08.360 --> 09:13.920]  America and a few other countries, that that would be mainlined so that whole new world
[09:13.920 --> 09:18.360]  order project would have to face resistance.
[09:18.360 --> 09:22.120]  And so I want to just sit back here today for all the listeners and all the viewers
[09:22.120 --> 09:26.520]  and all the activists and the crew and our sponsors and those that have made this broadcast
[09:26.520 --> 09:34.120]  possible and all the amazing guests and I want us just to pause for a moment, in fact
[09:34.120 --> 09:39.400]  I forgot to tell the crew to do this, well you guys pull up some video or audio of standing
[09:39.400 --> 09:46.240]  ovation or a crowd applauding, maybe that short clip before they cut my voice in with
[09:46.240 --> 09:50.000]  operatic singing, it's like 30 seconds long, cue that up in a moment, I want to play it
[09:50.000 --> 09:55.560]  as a salute to everybody or maybe we should have a 21 guns salute, but they can't get
[09:55.560 --> 10:00.680]  this project through if when it launches the public a large portion of the public knows
[10:00.680 --> 10:03.400]  what it is and what its evil aims are.
[10:03.400 --> 10:09.840]  And so all of you get the credit and yes I've gone through a lot of pain and a lot of suffering
[10:09.840 --> 10:14.920]  but it's been well worth it because the taste of victory is so sweet to get to this point
[10:14.920 --> 10:18.880]  and we have achieved our primary mission.
[10:18.880 --> 10:26.200]  We have achieved the primary mission that was literally laid on my heart by God when
[10:26.200 --> 10:35.080]  I was 18 years old, when God touched my heart the Holy Spirit reproved me to stop what I
[10:35.080 --> 10:45.280]  was doing and to stand up against evil and I accepted that and repented and then the
[10:45.280 --> 10:51.280]  gates of knowledge were opened and then about four years later after I've been on air only
[10:51.280 --> 10:59.120]  about a year, I've told the story a hundred times probably, after my access to TV show
[10:59.120 --> 11:03.640]  I went and got a chicken fried steak, got a beer, maybe it was iced tea I don't remember
[11:03.640 --> 11:09.960]  and the restaurant was basically empty about nine o'clock at night and God said now I'm
[11:09.960 --> 11:17.360]  going to give you the blueprint for victory and it was incredible, it was hard to digest,
[11:17.360 --> 11:22.160]  it was so complex but it was like knowledge was just being poured in and the gates were
[11:22.160 --> 11:28.280]  opened to knowledge in the next level and I saw basically everything that was coming
[11:28.280 --> 11:32.200]  and what my mission was and what was going to then unfold if I had the courage to face
[11:32.200 --> 11:35.560]  what was going to happen in the end.
[11:35.560 --> 11:41.920]  Because history repeats itself, it doesn't just rhyme and anybody knows that somebody
[11:41.920 --> 11:47.240]  that comes out of the wilderness at a major time of change who is the fire starter that
[11:47.240 --> 11:53.000]  triggers the next wave that defeats the evil, you know what happens to those people and
[11:53.000 --> 12:00.480]  God said you're going to be attacked, you're going to be absolutely in the end destroyed
[12:00.480 --> 12:10.000]  but you are going to launch the modern resistance and you're going to see leaders appear that
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.200]  are going to take humanity out of the darkness and you are going to be the main impetus that
[12:15.200 --> 12:22.680]  triggers that and I've been telling you that story for more than 15 years and I just share
[12:22.680 --> 12:29.880]  these private moments with you and I share the total truth of it, I was a whoremonger,
[12:29.880 --> 12:35.920]  I mean I just could not stay away from women and I'm sure there were sins but that's what
[12:35.920 --> 12:42.920]  I dedicated my time to, was dating as many women as I could and the byproduct of that
[12:42.920 --> 12:53.200]  was abortion and God just hit me like Saul on the road to Damascus with a thunderbolt,
[12:53.200 --> 12:56.280]  that's how I really described it, I didn't get knocked off a horse, I didn't see bright
[12:56.280 --> 13:01.800]  light but it was like nightmares you name it, you better stop what you're doing is wrong,
[13:01.800 --> 13:06.920]  don't ever kill children again, those are my children, you'll be damned to hell if you
[13:06.920 --> 13:11.320]  can, I mean it was just like what is this night after night, so I said God I'm sorry
[13:11.320 --> 13:29.880]  I won't do this anymore and then I went on my mission and just four years later I got
[13:29.880 --> 13:36.760]  the download and I talked about this about a month and a half ago that I got another
[13:36.760 --> 13:43.120]  big download even bigger than that one and I just can't even, it takes time to even
[13:43.120 --> 13:46.960]  understand this or decipher it and so that's why I've been taking some time off and things
[13:46.960 --> 13:52.920]  because I've just got to spend sometimes hours a day praying and trying to get sanctified
[13:52.920 --> 13:57.600]  and close to God to even understand this knowledge and when I finally get in the quiet place
[13:57.600 --> 14:02.880]  in the most high that King David talked about then I can understand it because it's so powerful,
[14:02.880 --> 14:09.320]  it's God and to be in that presence, not just the Holy Spirit, the Comforter for spiritual
[14:09.320 --> 14:15.800]  babies to love us and care about us and feel God's love but it's the next level, it's the
[14:15.800 --> 14:25.120]  war and it's deadly serious and so I've been processing that and going through that and
[14:25.120 --> 14:28.960]  the enemy knows that's happening, they have spiritual eyes to see, they're given to them
[14:28.960 --> 14:33.720]  by their father the devil and they know what's happened to me and this whole family that is
[14:33.720 --> 14:40.480]  info wars is something very very special and so I'm going to really do my best to not just
[14:40.480 --> 14:48.160]  cover the past or the present but tell you what's coming in the future and this human
[14:48.160 --> 14:55.360]  mind has real trouble deciphering the things of the spirit that are so much more advanced,
[14:55.360 --> 15:07.280]  so much more complex, so much more deep and long and eternal and timeless and you get
[15:07.280 --> 15:13.720]  into that zone and it's total completion and total confidence and it's hard to leave
[15:13.720 --> 15:19.240]  that zone and then come back into this zone and then contend with what you see going on
[15:19.240 --> 15:27.360]  around you especially when you still have your flesh, it's like a big ball and chain
[15:27.360 --> 15:33.640]  around your leg, you're still a center, still have all those things in you of a fallen creature
[15:33.640 --> 15:40.720]  but you're on the top of the mountain staring into infinity and God's eyes, it's quite
[15:40.720 --> 15:46.640]  the paradox, I only wish our enemies could taste, taste God's knowledge and they would
[15:46.640 --> 15:49.280]  never serve Satan.
[15:49.280 --> 15:53.440]  We'll be right back with all the news and more on this powerful Thursday broadcast as

[17:07.880 --> 17:12.760]  But doing deep research we made contact with the top company in the United States and it
[17:12.760 --> 17:17.520]  turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we
[17:17.520 --> 17:18.520]  were already using.
[17:18.520 --> 17:23.680]  So we've gone directly to the source and that means we can give you lower prices on the
[17:23.680 --> 17:27.880]  very same high quality supplements and in some cases even better.
[17:27.880 --> 17:37.760]  Introducing M4WarsMD at M4WarsStore.com, M4WarsMD exclusively at M4WarsStore.com has 10 new
[17:37.760 --> 17:45.800]  products, turmeric 95, libido RX, better mood, nitric boost, much room max and atropin, angels
[17:45.800 --> 17:49.480]  fatality collagen, superfood greens and more.

[17:53.480 --> 17:58.560]  at a price way, way lower than the same product on store shelves for twice the cost.

[18:00.320 --> 18:02.520]  There is a war on for your mind.
[18:02.520 --> 18:04.280]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[18:04.280 --> 18:06.520]  This is an information war.
[18:06.520 --> 18:12.280]  M4Wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago and today whether it's Donald
[18:12.280 --> 18:19.120]  Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that M4Wars has
[18:19.120 --> 18:23.840]  popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them.
[18:23.840 --> 18:27.920]  But we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products and
[18:27.920 --> 18:30.760]  power you and your immune system and your family as well.
[18:30.760 --> 18:35.440]  You can also make straight donations at M4WarsStore.com, clicking on the big red banner, a one time
[18:35.440 --> 18:38.280]  or recurring, but I'm asking you to take action.
[18:38.280 --> 18:41.760]  We're nonviolent, but every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every
[18:41.760 --> 18:45.600]  time you keep us on air, you are literally nonviolently politically punching the new
[18:45.600 --> 18:49.760]  world order in the nose, punching their lies in the nose.
[18:49.760 --> 18:51.640]  We are going to defeat the new world order.
[18:51.640 --> 18:54.280]  We're going over the top, but right now is the critical juncture.
[18:54.280 --> 19:01.560]  So please go to M4WarsStore.com and donate now.
[19:01.560 --> 19:06.440]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[19:06.440 --> 19:12.960]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics not just in America, but the world.
[19:12.960 --> 19:18.480]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[19:18.480 --> 19:19.480]  deserve the credit.
[19:19.480 --> 19:24.840]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support M4Wars are the real reason
[19:24.840 --> 19:27.000]  you have the success.
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.160]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new world order we've
[19:31.160 --> 19:32.400]  ever had.
[19:32.400 --> 19:39.120]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important
[19:39.120 --> 19:43.080]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[19:43.080 --> 19:45.920]  efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[19:45.920 --> 19:46.920]  God bless you all.
[19:46.920 --> 19:47.920]  I salute you.
[19:47.920 --> 19:48.920]  I thank you.
[19:48.920 --> 19:53.920]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this
[19:53.920 --> 20:05.560]  streak is happening, the fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless
[20:05.560 --> 20:25.360]  you all.
[20:25.360 --> 20:54.880]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex
[20:54.880 --> 20:58.920]  Jones.
[20:58.920 --> 21:04.160]  So we are inspired by the creator of the universe and beyond.
[21:04.160 --> 21:12.960]  We were created by that all-powerful, all-knowing, eternal entity.
[21:12.960 --> 21:21.680]  But there are lesser entities hell-bent on controlling humanity and in the year 2023,
[21:21.680 --> 21:28.560]  the world awakened to the criminal, murderous, transhumanist, satanic, pedophile-run, globalist
[21:28.560 --> 21:32.240]  system.
[21:32.240 --> 21:37.920]  What a victory that they are now trying to hide it in plain view after denying their
[21:37.920 --> 21:45.680]  plan the entire time and whether Elon Musk is good or bad or in between.
[21:45.680 --> 21:52.000]  He knows the ship of world government is sinking and at their own event told them they are
[21:52.000 --> 21:59.960]  wrong and what they're doing is dangerous and anti-human.
[21:59.960 --> 22:05.320]  He then went on to challenge world leaders to stop being puppets and reading a global
[22:05.320 --> 22:10.880]  script and to go on Twitter and to go on other sites and actually talk to the people
[22:10.880 --> 22:13.760]  and get in there with the people and be real.
[22:13.760 --> 22:20.840]  And that that would empower them and humanity.
[22:20.840 --> 22:26.640]  That is a big, big deal.
[22:26.640 --> 22:35.480]  So I salute you all.
[22:35.480 --> 22:38.200]  We did it with God's help.
[22:38.200 --> 22:39.200]  God did it.
[22:39.200 --> 22:46.560]  They'll bring in their full system soon, though, and then they'll be defeated by God.
[22:46.560 --> 22:53.360]  They went in the third quarter, we went in the fourth quarter, but we're now over the
[22:53.360 --> 22:57.200]  top entering the third quarter.
[22:57.200 --> 23:02.120]  They lose, though.
[23:02.120 --> 23:05.360]  Make no mistake about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:05.360 --> 23:07.560]  Make no mistake about that.
[23:07.560 --> 23:18.560]  28 years standing on greater people's shoulders, but the mission of M4 Wars is legendary now.
[23:18.560 --> 23:25.040]  And all of you don't just get participation trophies because your participation was the
[23:25.040 --> 23:26.040]  victory.
[23:26.040 --> 23:30.320]  Whether you told 10 people or a thousand or a million, whether you stood up to evil once
[23:30.320 --> 23:35.200]  or a hundred times, whether you were doing the right thing just a few times or only some
[23:35.200 --> 23:36.200]  of the time.
[23:36.200 --> 23:41.040]  If you did the best job you could in front of God, you're the reason the world is awakening
[23:41.040 --> 23:43.480]  and I salute you.
[23:43.480 --> 23:46.880]  You know, I had some guest schedule today, but I want to head and cancel them because
[23:46.880 --> 23:49.160]  I want to take calls.
[23:49.160 --> 23:52.360]  And yesterday, I said, there's two topics I want to hear from you on.
[23:52.360 --> 23:56.080]  The war, World War III, how to stop it, and they were amazing calls.
[23:56.080 --> 23:59.280]  But I said, also, what do you make of them admitting world government now, and then it
[23:59.280 --> 24:02.920]  wants to take over your body and run your life for your own good?
[24:02.920 --> 24:06.080]  What do you make of that being out in the open?
[24:06.080 --> 24:08.280]  And how they admit their world government's in trouble.
[24:08.280 --> 24:13.200]  And how they admit to give us this utopia they've got planned for us that we see as a
[24:13.200 --> 24:18.200]  dystopian nightmare, they've got a censorist and surveillance and control us and, as you
[24:18.200 --> 24:22.400]  all know, Harari said, take some of us away so the government can help us get better in
[24:22.400 --> 24:26.680]  reeducation camps and they've built the reeducation camps under the guise of the FEMA centers
[24:26.680 --> 24:29.640]  all under UN auspices.
[24:29.640 --> 24:35.560]  So yes, we're in very dark territory, but it's in that darkness that people learn to
[24:35.560 --> 24:42.600]  love the light and begin to look around them and get out of their stupor, out of their
[24:42.600 --> 24:48.440]  learned helplessness and realize that resistance is victory.
[24:48.440 --> 24:52.080]  So I want to open the phones up, coming up relatively early.
[24:52.080 --> 24:55.040]  I'm going to get the calls by the end of the hour.
[24:55.040 --> 24:58.920]  But I want to just get some of the news we're going to intersperse during the broadcast today
[24:58.920 --> 25:01.840]  and breaking news as it comes in.
[25:01.840 --> 25:05.160]  But this is really important.
[25:05.160 --> 25:08.200]  And I've got six, seven clips here from the World Government Summit we haven't gotten
[25:08.200 --> 25:09.840]  to yet.
[25:09.840 --> 25:16.120]  But I really think a clip of this magnitude should be aired two days in a row, three days
[25:16.120 --> 25:18.440]  in a row, ten days in a row, a hundred days in a row.
[25:18.440 --> 25:25.280]  Guys get Elon Musk from two days ago beaming into the World Government Summit in Dubai
[25:25.280 --> 25:30.040]  where he says you're wrong and you're in danger of humanity and you're going to cause a global
[25:30.040 --> 25:37.240]  collapse, which is actually their plan and he knows that he's being diplomatic and again,
[25:37.240 --> 25:47.360]  no matter what you think of him, to go to their event and to tell them this is explosive.
[25:47.360 --> 25:51.480]  And then you've got Joe Rogan coming out and there's a new world order that wants to enslave
[25:51.480 --> 25:56.560]  you and wants to take over your body and wants to make you eat bugs.
[25:56.560 --> 26:01.440]  And now suddenly almost all the other commentators that are popular are saying that because
[26:01.440 --> 26:05.400]  they know that's where the audience is and I've known Joe 25 years and Joe knew about
[26:05.400 --> 26:06.400]  this back when I did.
[26:06.400 --> 26:07.400]  He's just as smart as I am.
[26:07.400 --> 26:09.960]  So I've been irritated with him at times.
[26:09.960 --> 26:18.400]  But now Joe, who's a very calculated person, very smart, now his shows are like Alex Jones
[26:18.400 --> 26:31.560]  You know, I told you about two years ago when he was going to move to Austin before it was
[26:31.560 --> 26:36.320]  announced I said Joe Rogan is about to get hardcore and he did for a while and kind of
[26:36.320 --> 26:41.360]  pulled back to assess it and then now he's decided to go full on and it's going to be
[26:41.360 --> 26:42.360]  spectacular.
[26:42.360 --> 26:50.440]  And again, Joe Rogan is just a bellwether in this, a weather vane, a gauge, a sensor.
[26:50.440 --> 26:53.920]  And when you look at all the other big commentators, I mean, almost all of them now coming out
[26:53.920 --> 26:57.240]  against the new world order, a lot of Democrats coming out against the shot, coming out against
[26:57.240 --> 26:59.720]  lockdown saying they didn't know they were wrong.
[26:59.720 --> 27:03.120]  They're rats leaving a sinking ship and I'm not saying Joe's one of those because he hasn't
[27:03.120 --> 27:04.400]  been in bed with them.
[27:04.400 --> 27:09.760]  He just kind of knew what was going on but rode the fence like a surfer.
[27:09.760 --> 27:14.480]  But now he's no longer lukewarm, he's jumped in and so has Elon Musk and people say, man
[27:14.480 --> 27:17.920]  Joe Rogan's Alex Jones, it's all over Twitter, in fact it was trending yesterday, Joe Rogan's
[27:17.920 --> 27:20.560]  the new Alex Jones, Elon Musk's the new Alex Jones.
[27:20.560 --> 27:26.000]  Well you're all Alex Jones, just because I saw this and popularized it didn't mean
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.160]  it was something that I created, didn't mean it was my pipe dream that just so happened
[27:30.160 --> 27:34.280]  to come true or a self-fulfilling prophecy, you know, I was reading their own documents,
[27:34.280 --> 27:38.080]  I was reading their own books, I was studying them.
[27:38.080 --> 27:42.560]  But that's why I say this victory that we need to go ahead and accept and thank God
[27:42.560 --> 27:50.640]  for in a thanksgiving is so massive.
[27:50.640 --> 27:56.160]  Last January I told you the COVID narrative is broken, it's going to fall apart, it'll
[27:56.160 --> 28:01.360]  take time but they're in trouble and I'm telling you now, ladies and gentlemen, they're starting
[28:01.360 --> 28:05.040]  wars, they're getting new viruses ready, I'll cover that next segment, they're geared up
[28:05.040 --> 28:13.440]  for hell itself, but if you look at the long-term trajectory of this, they are going down big
[28:13.440 --> 28:19.160]  time, big time.
[28:19.160 --> 28:22.960]  Now it's going to be painful for those of us at the tip of the spear but it's also a
[28:22.960 --> 28:28.240]  great honor and exactly where I want to be, so no matter what happens to me, remember
[28:28.240 --> 28:34.200]  we are victorious because we chose our fate, we didn't just roll over and be bystanders
[28:34.200 --> 28:38.680]  in the middle of the road, we chose our lane, so I'm going to play some of these clips on
[28:38.680 --> 28:44.720]  world government, then I'm going to get into the big new world order world treaty and oh
[28:44.720 --> 28:49.440]  they're fair mongering a new virus that's already out there that kills 90% of humans,
[28:49.440 --> 28:55.800]  it's all coming up, big broadcast today, tell folks you know, tune in now, that's how we
[28:55.800 --> 29:01.080]  win.
[29:01.080 --> 29:05.600]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had, I don't think anybody can deny
[29:05.600 --> 29:11.280]  it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us, but when we talk about the
[29:11.280 --> 29:16.200]  crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really
[29:16.200 --> 29:21.400]  have been the MVPs in this fight and when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer
[29:21.400 --> 29:28.320]  and the hard work they engage in every day, 5, 6, 7 days a week, it's really just incredible,
[29:28.320 --> 29:32.600]  so for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support, I only encourage
[29:32.600 --> 29:37.960]  you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us, I know you
[29:37.960 --> 29:41.720]  spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing it, but most
[29:41.720 --> 29:46.520]  viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich

[31:59.840 --> 32:06.920]  In the year 2000 Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how
[32:06.920 --> 32:16.080]  our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private, in 2007 Alex
[32:16.080 --> 32:22.440]  Jones releases Endgame exposing the world elites plans for covertly using biological
[32:22.440 --> 32:28.880]  weapons against all of mankind and by the time they launched their attack in 2020 Alex
[32:28.880 --> 32:35.520]  Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines
[32:35.520 --> 32:41.760]  that we knew were coming, this is why they attack us, this is why we need your support
[32:41.760 --> 32:49.040]  because we tell the truth Alex Jones was right, join the resistance, buy products, donate
[32:49.040 --> 32:55.440]  to the cause, share the links, join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the
[32:55.440 --> 33:01.640]  New World Order.
[33:01.640 --> 33:13.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:13.200 --> 33:19.880]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:19.880 --> 33:24.400]  the InfoWars.
[33:24.400 --> 33:36.000]  Again, the globalists wanted their world government, their world ID, their social credit score,
[33:36.000 --> 33:43.360]  their carbon tax, their universal basic income to sneak up on people and just be adopted.
[33:43.360 --> 33:47.280]  They didn't want to debate about it, they didn't want to fight about it, they just wanted
[33:47.280 --> 33:49.520]  to do it.
[33:49.520 --> 33:54.080]  But thanks to this family that is InfoWars, there's a lot of other great organizations
[33:54.080 --> 33:56.520]  and groups as well to get the credit.
[33:56.520 --> 33:59.200]  We now have a real fighting chance.
[33:59.200 --> 34:05.920]  This is historical in the species, history and our present and our future.
[34:05.920 --> 34:10.240]  And so it's important to recognize what your sacrifices have done.
[34:10.240 --> 34:14.480]  Let me tell you what's coming up today and then I'll give the number out.
[34:14.480 --> 34:19.400]  We have a huge group of studies and articles about men and women are no longer gonna exist
[34:19.400 --> 34:21.720]  because chemicals in the water are making us asexual.
[34:21.720 --> 34:27.920]  I told you this 20 years ago, it's their plan, but here it is, science needs to stop using
[34:27.920 --> 34:34.240]  terms like male, female, mother, father, researchers say, New York Post, university level gender
[34:34.240 --> 34:41.000]  classes teaches that chromosomes don't exist, don't determine sex, gestational exposure
[34:41.000 --> 34:46.920]  to phallates and gender-related play behaviors in eight-year-old children on an observational
[34:46.920 --> 34:53.960]  study, turning little boys into girls, turning girls into hyper-girls, which over-ages them,
[34:53.960 --> 34:54.960]  accelerates them.
[34:54.960 --> 35:01.360]  Wall Street Journal report says you should stop eating to save money.
[35:01.360 --> 35:06.400]  Proposy advocates, activists sound alarm on 15-minute cities that can easily allow for
[35:06.400 --> 35:10.500]  climate lockdowns, that's the embedded plan.
[35:10.500 --> 35:14.800]  And the deep state is now announcing that they wanna ban all cars, including electric,
[35:14.800 --> 35:17.520]  gotta make you in, study right here.
[35:17.520 --> 35:21.640]  So there's that stack that'll be covering.
[35:21.640 --> 35:28.320]  Then we have this stack on the pedos, the sanis reveals shocking porn books being removed
[35:28.320 --> 35:29.840]  from Florida schools.
[35:29.840 --> 35:36.880]  Remember Christy Lee's child in sixth grade alerted her to this same book where children
[35:36.880 --> 35:39.120]  have sex with each other and with adults.
[35:39.120 --> 35:48.040]  So it's a pedophile book and it's in the public schools all over the country.
[35:48.040 --> 35:54.240]  And the left calls it anti-LGBTQP, well yeah, we're against pedophilia.
[35:54.240 --> 36:03.000]  So we've got that stack of related news that we're going to be getting to that teaches
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.560]  children to get in vans with men that pull up, well that's really good to teach kids.
[36:07.560 --> 36:12.920]  You know, you see these TV shows and they've got educational films that I've shown all
[36:12.920 --> 36:20.320]  four of my children, three of my children are basically grown up, 20, 18, 15.
[36:20.320 --> 36:24.000]  One of them is five and a half and we're just getting around to showing her in the videos
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.520]  of what you do if somebody tries to grab your arm or take you away, what you do.
[36:28.520 --> 36:32.240]  But the Democrats have all these books saying if a man pulls up and says get in the back
[36:32.240 --> 36:38.080]  of the vehicle with him, get in the back of the vehicle with him, it's going to be wonderful.
[36:38.080 --> 36:42.720]  Or if your adult neighbor wants to go in the tool shed with you, it's going to be very
[36:42.720 --> 36:48.360]  fun what he does, it's going to be a great experience to be molested.
[36:48.360 --> 36:55.080]  This is happening, this isn't some nightmare fever dream, they're doing this.
[36:55.080 --> 37:02.280]  We have the world government stack I'm going to be getting to next and then we have this
[37:02.280 --> 37:10.480]  stack, not and, there's many more stacks, but the whole poison shot stack that is particularly
[37:10.480 --> 37:14.440]  thick today because I didn't get to the stack yesterday.
[37:14.440 --> 37:19.760]  So it's two days of articles, but this is about 30 articles.
[37:19.760 --> 37:37.160]  Using one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
[37:37.160 --> 37:56.520]  18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 37
[37:56.520 --> 37:58.440]  articles, sorry I said about 30.
[37:58.440 --> 38:05.560]  See I'm not exaggerating, 37, each article more hellish confirming mass death, sterilization,
[38:05.560 --> 38:10.320]  heart attacks, absolute insanity, just look at that, do the whole show on that.
[38:10.320 --> 38:14.240]  Video clips, all the admissions scientists, actuaries, insurance companies, just total
[38:14.240 --> 38:17.720]  hell on earth, or you can just go back to me 20 years ago telling you all this is coming
[38:17.720 --> 38:24.600]  with exact precision.
[38:24.600 --> 38:33.680]  Maybe I should just do the next three and a half hours on this, then we've got the race
[38:33.680 --> 38:39.320]  war stack, then we've got the carbon tax stack, then we've got the Russian Ukraine war stack,
[38:39.320 --> 38:42.960]  then we've got the inflation stack, then we've got the crime exploding stack, then we've
[38:42.960 --> 38:48.840]  got the drag queen Pito stack, then we've got the J. P. Morgan Jeffrey Epstein stack
[38:48.840 --> 38:53.360]  which is Pito and just on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and
[38:53.360 --> 38:54.360]  on.
[38:54.360 --> 39:01.040]  And then election 2024 stack.
[39:01.040 --> 39:03.800]  That's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:03.800 --> 39:06.040]  That's what we're dealing with.
[39:06.040 --> 39:08.400]  That's what we're covering.
[39:08.400 --> 39:10.880]  That's what we're breaking down.
[39:10.880 --> 39:12.720]  And so I'm going to do it free for all.
[39:12.720 --> 39:15.440]  Hell, you don't listen to me anyways and I love you.
[39:15.440 --> 39:18.360]  You always say you're calling on topic, make it about something else, that's fine.
[39:18.360 --> 39:24.080]  So any topic under the sun that you want to talk about, any question, any comment, you
[39:24.080 --> 39:31.440]  again disagree, you agree, whatever it is, we will get you on air as long as you've got
[39:31.440 --> 39:34.920]  a good clean phone line and make your points, I'd love to hear from you.
[39:34.920 --> 39:46.360]  So the toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[39:46.360 --> 39:49.400]  You notice I'm getting more back to calls in my roots.
[39:49.400 --> 39:56.760]  You're great as well, that's a big guest tomorrow, I'm going to come in Saturday 11 to 1 live.
[39:56.760 --> 40:00.680]  Because I've got a family event coming up after that, so I'm not going to do it later
[40:00.680 --> 40:02.200]  in the afternoon like I usually do.
[40:02.200 --> 40:07.400]  And I'm going to have J.Dar, his super smart, amazing and also quite attractive wife, another
[40:07.400 --> 40:17.520]  great creation of God, in here with us on Saturday 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., two hours commercial
[40:17.520 --> 40:25.040]  light, we'll have a few breaks, with J.Dar and more on the New World Order, we're going
[40:25.040 --> 40:34.360]  to cover the waterfront at 11 a.m. central this Saturday, then I will return Sunday 4
[40:34.360 --> 40:46.480]  p.m. central standard time, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:46.480 --> 40:53.080]  We make a program note here, before I go to break, and come back and hit the world government
[40:53.080 --> 40:57.240]  news, the poison shot news, then take your calls, and then get back into the other news.
[40:57.240 --> 41:03.520]  Two big items from the Alex Jones and Free Speech Systems, chapter 11, sub-chapter 5 bankruptcies
[41:03.520 --> 41:08.600]  which are reorganizations so we stay on air, not liquidation, we're not shutting down.
[41:08.600 --> 41:12.600]  We follow completely truthfully to the best of our knowledge with the federal court, and
[41:12.600 --> 41:16.880]  they had a little question on there, are you holding any property for anybody, and I went
[41:16.880 --> 41:25.920]  well, no I'm not, but I asked around to people here at Free Speech and they said yes you are.
[41:25.920 --> 41:34.760]  Sam Wontoya and Owen Schreuer were both arrested and charged for being at the Capitol on January
[41:34.760 --> 41:40.040]  6, and their lawyers respectively, because we have a gun safes here, said will you hold
[41:40.040 --> 41:44.800]  their couple guns for you, and we said sure, we'll hold their guns while they're still
[41:44.800 --> 41:49.360]  years later being put to the meat grinder for absolutely nothing.
[41:49.360 --> 41:54.160]  National news, Jones has got January 6 weapons, yeah because our reporters did that, and they're
[41:54.160 --> 41:59.080]  here in a building with armed guards in a safe, we're not planning to throw the government
[41:59.080 --> 42:02.520]  with their shotguns and handguns.
[42:02.520 --> 42:06.600]  Another big fake piece of info, I launched AlexJonesLive.com and planning for years to
[42:06.600 --> 42:11.480]  do a subscription service, and another thing, and they flipped out and went oh my god he's
[42:11.480 --> 42:16.520]  planning to leave Info Wars, and his bankruptcy is fake, and all this other stuff, and I told
[42:16.520 --> 42:20.520]  them in the show, and I told all of you on the show, it's a new site separate from Info
[42:20.520 --> 42:25.600]  Wars with another company that I don't own or control, and that's all there, so now they
[42:25.600 --> 42:29.760]  want to investigate that, investigate it all you want, and I also went ahead and launched
[42:29.760 --> 42:34.560]  that thing on the planet for years to show them I can do any show I want wherever I want,
[42:34.560 --> 42:37.920]  it's not bad if I want to, but I'm not leaving free speech systems, but I got a bunch of
[42:37.920 --> 42:43.480]  offers and a bunch of deals, but the fact that I built a little studio outside this operation
[42:43.480 --> 42:48.280]  and other folks own it is nothing, but it shows how they just are obsessed with us not
[42:48.280 --> 42:49.280]  having communication.
[42:49.280 --> 42:53.000]  Hey, just because the left did that, I've been cutting back on interviews, I got about
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.920]  100 requests a day, I'm gonna do 100 interviews the next month, okay, you won't shut those
[42:56.920 --> 42:57.920]  down either.
[42:57.920 --> 43:07.080]  Well, I think we're gonna say about Diet Force, Diet Force is amazing, I'm 45, and I have
[43:07.080 --> 43:12.680]  bits, I go to the gym, and I have bits that won't move, and Diet Force has helped me move
[43:12.680 --> 43:19.680]  those bits, like under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking Diet Force two tablets a day,
[43:19.680 --> 43:26.800]  man, if you're like struggling to get like chip shaped for the ladies, mate, Diet Force
[43:26.800 --> 43:32.520]  is the go, you have to get the Diet Force and have it to a day and just keep acting.
[43:32.520 --> 43:35.840]  Infowarsstore.com, X7 Diet Force.
[43:35.840 --> 43:38.720]  Infowarsstore.com, baby.
[43:38.720 --> 43:42.680]  Now on sale, we're cutting that ad, we're cutting that call into an ad, I can guarantee
[43:42.680 --> 43:47.000]  you that, thank you so much for the call, Grant, God bless Australia, we'll be right
[43:47.000 --> 44:00.600]  back folks, don't go anywhere, Infowarsstore.com, Diet Force, get it now.
[44:00.600 --> 44:05.000]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to
[44:05.000 --> 44:10.000]  fund an information war, and everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level
[44:10.000 --> 44:13.960]  and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stand the field in this
[44:13.960 --> 44:19.320]  war against the New World Order by visiting Infowarsstore.com right now and taking action.
[44:19.320 --> 44:23.160]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that
[44:23.160 --> 44:27.960]  only your commitment to keep Infowars on the air will ensure our victory against the New
[44:27.960 --> 44:28.960]  World Order.
[44:28.960 --> 44:32.760]  They're coming for you and your family, they're coming for me, they're coming for the children,
[44:32.760 --> 44:35.360]  but to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[44:35.360 --> 44:38.880]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies, they're
[44:38.880 --> 44:43.120]  already giving them to pregnant women, miscarriages are off the chart, 80 plus percent increase
[44:43.120 --> 44:47.760]  in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots.
[44:47.760 --> 44:52.920]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us, let's do it together.
[44:52.920 --> 44:57.400]  And the fight starts at Infowars.com and the fight continues with your financial support
[44:57.400 --> 44:58.960]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[44:58.960 --> 45:00.440]  Now take action now.
[45:00.440 --> 45:07.240]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist in Mies, famously said more than
[45:07.240 --> 45:13.680]  150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated because the newspapers
[45:13.680 --> 45:19.560]  kept saying he died decades before he did die and it's the same psi-op today.
[45:19.560 --> 45:23.880]  Infowars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support and because
[45:23.880 --> 45:27.000]  of the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.680]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're
[45:30.680 --> 45:35.840]  going away and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[45:35.840 --> 45:40.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down Infowars and
[45:40.120 --> 45:41.920]  that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[45:41.920 --> 45:43.880]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[45:43.880 --> 45:48.040]  If you decide to go to Infowarsstore.com against supplements and books and films and t-shirts
[45:48.040 --> 45:51.160]  and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[45:51.160 --> 45:52.560]  It is all in your hands.
[45:52.560 --> 45:56.800]  So thanks for your support, stand up against the globalists, go to Infowarsstore.com right
[45:56.800 --> 45:58.400]  now and keep us on air.
[45:58.400 --> 46:00.760]  It's up to you.
[46:00.760 --> 46:05.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, Infowars Live products have always been the highest quality, triple
[46:05.240 --> 46:07.880]  tested and you've seen the right reviews.
[46:07.880 --> 46:12.760]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States and it
[46:12.760 --> 46:17.520]  turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we
[46:17.520 --> 46:18.520]  were already using.
[46:18.520 --> 46:23.680]  So we've gone directly to the source and that means we can give you lower prices on the
[46:23.680 --> 46:27.880]  very same high quality supplements and in some cases even better.
[46:27.880 --> 46:38.280]  Using InfowarsMD at Infowarsstore.com, InfowarsMD exclusively at Infowarsstore.com has 10 new

[46:55.600 --> 47:01.960]  same product on store shelves for twice the cost, find InfowarsMD at Infowarsstore.
[47:01.960 --> 47:16.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:16.800 --> 47:23.920]  So here's Joe Rogan, now saying there's a world government of evil world leaders trying
[47:23.920 --> 47:30.120]  to enslave us and just like that he knows all about everything because his best buddy
[47:30.120 --> 47:34.000]  Elon Musk has now come out against world government and that's okay.
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.080]  So many people on Twitter are like, look at Joe, he's being Alex Jones, he ought to support
[47:38.080 --> 47:43.640]  Alex more, he ought to, wow, hey, our mission is to get everybody else away and then we've
[47:43.640 --> 47:47.520]  got to be glad when other prominent people fight the globalist.
[47:47.520 --> 47:51.120]  We're not territorializing this, it's wonderful, it's good.
[47:51.120 --> 47:57.960]  Here's Joe Rogan talking about Brian Stelter who's now the mini-me kind of a drink server,
[47:57.960 --> 48:02.720]  cocktail waitress for Klaus Schwab at the World Government Summit.
[48:02.720 --> 48:05.320]  Heard at the World Economic Forum, right?
[48:05.320 --> 48:06.320]  We heard the...
[48:06.320 --> 48:07.560]  Brian Stelter was there.
[48:07.560 --> 48:08.560]  Brian Stelter.
[48:08.560 --> 48:14.840]  Brian Stelter is now at the World Economic Forum, what can we do about these problems?
[48:14.840 --> 48:16.360]  He looked very comfortable there, didn't he?
[48:16.360 --> 48:20.760]  Of course he does, he's with evil lizard people that are trying to control the world.
[48:20.760 --> 48:23.480]  That's his bosses, he knows how to handle that kind of situation.
[48:23.480 --> 48:26.400]  I've been around evil lizard people.
[48:26.400 --> 48:30.960]  He looked as happy as maybe he's ever been.
[48:30.960 --> 48:36.120]  Well, he's probably very excited just to be working again in any way, shape or form.
[48:36.120 --> 48:37.120]  That's true.
[48:37.120 --> 48:39.480]  He's not a guy that really is supposed to be in front of a camera, right?
[48:39.480 --> 48:41.800]  He's supposed to be a journalist but he's not even good at that.
[48:41.800 --> 48:46.840]  So what he's doing now is holding water for the evil leaders of the world who want to
[48:46.840 --> 48:52.720]  institute hate speech policies nationwide and centralize digital currency and they want
[48:52.720 --> 48:55.920]  everybody to eat bugs and you will own nothing and be happy.
[48:55.920 --> 49:02.200]  This is the people he's working for now because he's basically a prostitute and they hired
[49:02.200 --> 49:05.240]  him to go over there and do that and he's like, what can we do?
[49:05.240 --> 49:06.240]  What can we do better?
[49:06.240 --> 49:08.960]  What can we do different to get everybody to stand in line?
[49:08.960 --> 49:11.320]  What can we do?
[49:11.320 --> 49:17.800]  And for a journalist to sit there, there was that one moment where that woman Vera Yorava,
[49:17.800 --> 49:23.320]  she's an EU official and she's talking about hate speech laws and then she touches the
[49:23.320 --> 49:26.720]  knee of somebody sitting next to her and saying, you're going to have that in America
[49:26.720 --> 49:27.720]  soon.
[49:27.720 --> 49:34.160]  As hate speech, as illegal hate speech, which you will have soon or so in the US, I think
[49:34.160 --> 49:35.160]  that.
[49:35.160 --> 49:36.160]  Yeah.
[49:36.160 --> 49:41.160]  And Brian Seltter is sitting there grinning, oh, that's not offensive to him.
[49:41.160 --> 49:45.320]  Like you're a European basically saying, oh, yeah, you're going to have this too soon.
[49:45.320 --> 49:50.520]  Like even though it's completely antithetical to everything that we believe in in this country.
[49:50.520 --> 49:54.480]  Well, I think when you're working in a corporate news structure, and you could speak to this
[49:54.480 --> 49:58.320]  better than I could obviously, but I think when you're working in an environment where
[49:58.320 --> 50:05.240]  you have editors and people in your ear and you have producers and you have narratives
[50:05.240 --> 50:09.120]  that the company is pushing and then you have sponsorships that you're beholden to, it's
[50:09.120 --> 50:15.000]  very difficult to form any sort of problematic or controversial independent thought and then
[50:15.000 --> 50:16.560]  try to express it publicly.
[50:16.560 --> 50:17.560]  You're not going to do it.
[50:17.560 --> 50:19.960]  It's just too scary and sketchy.
[50:19.960 --> 50:23.560]  So when you're trying to keep that job, and here's a guy like Brian Seltter who already
[50:23.560 --> 50:28.640]  lost one of the biggest gigs in all of broadcast news, he was on CNN.
[50:28.640 --> 50:31.800]  And then, you know, here he's standing there and they're saying, you're going to have hate
[50:31.800 --> 50:32.800]  speech laws in America too.
[50:32.800 --> 50:39.000]  He's like, okay, it is when he's smooth, everyone's smiling, like he doesn't, he's not suitable
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.520]  for that role.
[50:40.520 --> 50:41.880]  He doesn't belong there.
[50:41.880 --> 50:47.160]  You don't have the stones to carry that conversation in a way that's going to benefit all these
[50:47.160 --> 50:48.560]  people that are listening to it.
[50:48.560 --> 50:53.040]  What you want is someone who's in that position that goes, hold on, what do you think is hate
[50:53.040 --> 50:54.040]  speech?
[50:54.040 --> 50:57.760]  What's hate speech to you, and what's hate speech to me, and who gets to decide?
[50:57.760 --> 50:58.760]  Yeah.
[50:58.760 --> 51:05.600]  How is that going to be adjudicated, like what's your definition of hate, what's your definition
[51:05.600 --> 51:06.600]  of speech?
[51:06.600 --> 51:07.600]  Exactly.
[51:07.600 --> 51:11.640]  And they call it mainstream media, but it's really corporate dinosaur media with almost
[51:11.640 --> 51:14.960]  no viewers unless it's like the Super Bowl, so that's why they fly it with propaganda
[51:14.960 --> 51:16.800]  because it's the last place they have an audience.
[51:16.800 --> 51:18.840]  Joe Rogan is mainstream.
[51:18.840 --> 51:24.240]  Joe Rogan does have the biggest audience in the world other than like some shows in China
[51:24.240 --> 51:27.040]  and India that are state run that have like 100 million viewers.
[51:27.040 --> 51:31.600]  But when it comes to independent free media, Joe Rogan has 20 million, 30 million viewers
[51:31.600 --> 51:38.160]  today per show easily, he's mainstream, and the mainstream is rejecting the new world
[51:38.160 --> 51:39.160]  order and their minions.
[51:39.160 --> 51:41.720]  See, that's what victory is.
[51:41.720 --> 51:46.600]  So let's recognize we're the majority, we're the cultural future, we're overturning the
[51:46.600 --> 51:52.680]  powerful elite, we're the avant-garde, we are the rebels, and we're winning.
[51:52.680 --> 51:55.920]  Let's play that clip I mentioned from yesterday of Elon Musk.
[51:55.920 --> 51:59.000]  He knows we're winning, so he's jumping to our side.
[51:59.000 --> 52:00.600]  That's pretty much what's happened.
[52:00.600 --> 52:04.760]  So don't be mad about it, don't completely trust him, don't turn your back on him, don't
[52:04.760 --> 52:13.520]  turn the lights off around him, but at least he's coming to our side because we're winning.
[52:13.520 --> 52:18.920]  I know this is called the World Governments Summit, but I think we should be maybe a little
[52:18.920 --> 52:24.880]  bit concerned about actually becoming too much of a single world government.
[52:24.880 --> 52:32.560]  If I may say that we want to avoid creating a civilizational risk by having, frankly, this
[52:32.560 --> 52:38.240]  may sound a little odd, too much cooperation between governments.
[52:38.240 --> 52:45.120]  You know, if you look at, say, the history and the rise and fall of civilizations, really
[52:45.120 --> 52:50.280]  all throughout history civilizations have risen and fallen, but it hasn't meant the doom of
[52:50.280 --> 52:55.680]  humanity as a whole because they've been only separate civilizations that were separated
[52:55.680 --> 52:58.000]  by great distances.
[52:58.000 --> 53:06.840]  And so, you know, say, like, while Rome was falling, you know, Islam was rising, and so
[53:06.840 --> 53:07.840]  you had like...
[53:07.840 --> 53:11.280]  So what he said, the founding fathers said, it's why we have a federal and state government,
[53:11.280 --> 53:15.880]  that's separation, and three branches in the federal and state for a separation of powers
[53:15.880 --> 53:21.360]  for checks and balances or firewalls or bulkheads in a ship.
[53:21.360 --> 53:28.200]  I'm not going to play the whole clip because it's long, but here's the WHO's Tedros about
[53:28.200 --> 53:33.000]  proposed framework for a stronger architect for global health security, which is a worldwide
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.560]  UN treaty to take over our bodies.
[53:35.560 --> 53:39.520]  Here's some of him hitting the panic button.
[53:39.520 --> 53:45.880]  This is urbanization, habitat destruction, intensive agriculture, and climate change.
[53:45.880 --> 53:52.760]  These risks are converging with unprecedented frequency and intensity.
[53:52.760 --> 53:59.360]  We owe it to those we have lost and those who will come after us to learn the lessons
[53:59.360 --> 54:07.560]  from this pandemic and make the changes that must be made to keep the world safer.
[54:07.560 --> 54:15.160]  The WHO has proposed a framework for a stronger architecture for global health security, including
[54:15.160 --> 54:23.680]  stronger governance, stronger financing, stronger systems and tools, and a stronger WHO.
[54:23.680 --> 54:30.080]  The international accord or agreement that countries are now negotiating will provide
[54:30.080 --> 54:35.640]  a much needed framework for enhancing a shared response to shared threats.
[54:35.640 --> 54:37.640]  Okay, I can't listen to it anymore.
[54:37.640 --> 54:41.080]  So a total surveillance grid run by the UN over your government.
[54:41.080 --> 54:47.400]  Here's Ian Bremer, president and founder of the Eurasian Group, claims one of the obstacles
[54:47.400 --> 54:50.080]  to achieving globalization and new order is nationalism.
[54:50.080 --> 54:54.680]  You've got to get rid of those nation-states and make sure they follow the UN orders.
[54:54.680 --> 55:02.000]  We see that misalignment playing out and all of them are challenging globalization.
[55:02.000 --> 55:08.760]  They're all creating some of the crises that we see in our headlines around the world and
[55:08.760 --> 55:16.240]  in this region today, is that those crises create the seeds of a new order.
[55:16.240 --> 55:20.720]  And that's all of this nationalism, all the protectionism we see around the world.
[55:20.720 --> 55:22.920]  My country's been doing it.
[55:22.920 --> 55:25.120]  Donald Trump said America first.
[55:25.120 --> 55:29.280]  Now that is not meant to appeal to people outside the US.
[55:29.280 --> 55:37.160]  It's globalization adrift, it's globalization constrained, but it's also globalization continuing.
[55:37.160 --> 55:40.400]  And I think that's really critical.
[55:40.400 --> 55:47.120]  A few takeaways from that, the EU will be politically stronger in a more challenging
[55:47.120 --> 55:53.600]  environment economically and from a security perspective, you will see the EU with stronger
[55:53.600 --> 56:00.080]  energy policy, fiscal policy, health policy, defense policy and tech policy than at any
[56:00.080 --> 56:06.720]  point since the EU was created because of these crises, because of the geopolitical
[56:06.720 --> 56:11.360]  concerns, because of the pandemic, heck, because of Brexit.
[56:11.360 --> 56:14.600]  We see NATO stronger too.
[56:14.600 --> 56:18.880]  So they create the crises to consolidate power and control for their new order.
[56:18.880 --> 56:20.400]  We're going to go to break.
[56:20.400 --> 56:24.640]  I got more clips and then we're going to go to your phone calls very, very soon in the
[56:24.640 --> 56:26.080]  next hour.
[56:26.080 --> 56:31.040]  All the folks that are holding, please remember, nobody's doing a broadcast this hardcore, nobody's
[56:31.040 --> 56:34.880]  got these amazing listeners and viewers, you, nobody's got these incredible guests on one
[56:34.880 --> 56:35.880]  spot.
[56:35.880 --> 56:36.880]  We need your support.
[56:36.880 --> 56:40.080]  This is a national global treasure, not me, this whole organization.
[56:40.080 --> 56:43.520]  So spread the word about the broadcast, pray for us because you're part of it, you're at
[56:43.520 --> 56:48.000]  the heart of it and get products at infowarstore.com.
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.720]  I think supplements are our main product line, we're bringing back t-shirts and books and
[56:51.720 --> 56:55.880]  films soon, but we were in a cash bind, didn't have money to buy those, so we just focused
[56:55.880 --> 56:59.480]  on the key supplements and we're barely in the black right now, but we're pulling out
[56:59.480 --> 57:01.120]  of where we were.
[57:01.120 --> 57:06.240]  Please go to infowarstore.com and get Ultimate Bone Broth Plus sold out for over two years,
[57:06.240 --> 57:10.000]  now back stronger than ever, the best bone broth out there with the chocomushroom and

[57:50.600 --> 57:55.120]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had, I don't think anybody can deny
[57:55.120 --> 58:00.800]  it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us, but when we talk about the
[58:00.800 --> 58:05.720]  crew at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really
[58:05.720 --> 58:11.160]  have been the MVPs in this fight and we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the
[58:11.160 --> 58:17.840]  hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[58:17.840 --> 58:22.080]  So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support, I only encourage
[58:22.080 --> 58:27.120]  you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[58:27.120 --> 58:30.320]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing it,
[58:30.320 --> 58:35.600]  but most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com and you never buy great products
[58:35.600 --> 58:39.120]  that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, keep us on air.
[58:39.120 --> 58:42.800]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[58:42.800 --> 58:47.680]  If just 1% more of you took action at went to infowarstore.com, our funding problems will
[58:47.680 --> 58:49.600]  be over, please take action now.
[58:49.600 --> 58:54.680]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the wellness
[58:54.680 --> 58:55.680]  company.
[58:55.680 --> 58:59.720]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the chief scientific officer of the company, I contribute
[58:59.720 --> 59:03.880]  with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[59:03.880 --> 59:09.440]  So far in a way, the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement
[59:09.440 --> 59:13.720]  that features natokinase, it's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[59:13.720 --> 59:19.280]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[59:19.280 --> 59:20.280]  This is very important.
[59:20.280 --> 59:24.200]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with
[59:24.200 --> 59:27.640]  the vaccines, people are lower with the spike protein, they don't feel well.
[59:27.640 --> 59:33.560]  This is a potential solution, hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance, so does ivermectin
[59:33.560 --> 59:36.960]  and now natokinase, isn't it interesting?
[59:36.960 --> 59:42.920]  Natural substances in a sense combating this manmade disaster, SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[59:42.920 --> 59:46.600]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support and thank you for getting into that because
[59:46.600 --> 59:52.640]  it's important you didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[59:52.640 --> 01:00:01.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:08.400]  The Mind Control Media has been spotlighting recent reports on UFOs being spotted and even
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.000]  shot down out of the sky.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:17.120]  And many suspect it's laying the groundwork for the so-called fake alien invasion that
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:23.600]  has been reported on now for decades, a false flag event wherein the public is tricked into
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:29.280]  believing that aliens from outer space are invading the Earth.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:36.000]  In his 1991 book, Behold a Pale Horse, William Cooper claimed that secret groups within the
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.360]  U.S. government have designed their own flying saucer technology and are planning to launch
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:47.000]  a staged alien invasion in order to create a one-world government.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:53.080]  What I discovered was amazing, what I discovered ladies and gentlemen is that there has been
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:01:02.360]  a plan in existence since about 1917, and probably before that, to create an artificial
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:08.600]  extraterrestrial threat to this Earth in order to create a one-world, totalitarian socialist
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.600]  government.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:17.200]  Nazi scientist and former head of NASA, Werner von Braun, reportedly told his assistant, Carol
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:23.680]  Rosen, that a fake alien invasion will be the final gambit of an ongoing plan to create
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.400]  a one-world government.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:31.080]  And we have to prevent the weaponization of space because there is a lie being told to
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:37.200]  everyone that the weaponization of space is now first being based upon the evil empire,
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.200]  the Russians.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.880]  There are many enemies he said against whom were going to build this space-based weapon
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:46.440]  system, the first of whom was the Russians, which was existing at that time.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.800]  Then there would be terrorists, then there would be third-world countries, now we call
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:55.600]  them rogue nations or nations of concern, then there would be asteroids, and then he
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:02.920]  would repeat to me over and over, and the last card, the last card, the last card would
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.160]  be the extraterrestrial threat.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:12.640]  The fake alien invasion is only possible if there are advanced technologies being hidden
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:16.600]  from the public, capable of pulling it off.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.680]  And there is plenty of evidence supporting this, from the stolen and censored work of
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:27.200]  Nikola Tesla, to that of John Hutchison, and thousands more.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:34.360]  According to some sources, these technologies were discovered by back-engineering alien spacecraft.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:39.960]  But the word alien implies extraterrestrial, not from this Earth.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:46.080]  And that's the fake part, because humanity's historical record is replete with non-human
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.800]  species that ruled over mankind as gods.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:54.880]  This story is the most prolific story on Earth.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:01.280]  The Sumerian texts, officially the oldest written documents we have, describe a non-human
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:08.440]  species that created a unique species of human via genetic modification.
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:15.720]  These non-humans then began mating with human women, and created a new race of giants.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:21.400]  This story is prevalent throughout our entire historical record, and is found in practically
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.320]  every religious scripture on Earth.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:29.560]  Nearly every culture on this planet claims to have been created by a race of god-like
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:36.840]  reptilians, most often described as serpent gods, or dragons.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:44.040]  David Ike has compiled scores of personal accounts, describing an interdimensional reptilian-like
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:53.640]  species that hides in the shadows by shape-shifting and taking possession of a human's body.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:04:00.080]  William Bramley's book, Gods of Eden, provides a comprehensive history of a secret brotherhood
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:06.800]  that works as an intermediary for a reptilian-like species that has been manipulating mankind
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.880]  for millennia.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:14.520]  And in all these ancient accounts, we not only read about these god-like species, we
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:17.360]  read about their flying ships.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.960]  In the ancient Vedas, they are called Vimanas.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:28.440]  These ancient Vimanas were described in great detail a hundred years ago in the Vimanakashastra,
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.600]  and were believed to be found within hidden caves of the Himalayan mountains.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:39.520]  Which is what likely compelled the Nazis to explore the Himalayas in search of the Aryan
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.480]  race in 1938.
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:49.080]  We are officially told that the Aryan race was a blonde-haired, blue-eyed breed of humans.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.720]  But this is a lie.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:56.640]  The Aryan race that the Nazis were interested in was the Aryan race of the ancient Vedas,
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.760]  an elusive, non-human species.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:07.720]  The cavalry has arrived, ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken-based
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:11.840]  bone broth you are going to find with all of the effects for your joints, your bones,

[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.760]  Everybody knows about grandma and chicken broth.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:23.040]  Well, this is concentrated chicken broth, the strongest out there with chocolate mushroom,
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:27.200]  and a whole bunch of other ingredients like turmeric, the list goes on and on.

[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.920]  characteristics and fertility of children, including in the womb.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.920]  Big news on that.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.960]  We're going to be covering in all interspersed your calls, but let's take a lot of your calls
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.960]  today.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:42.960]  As I said, we would.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:47.880]  We're going to go in the order the calls are received, yes, in Israel, let's talk about
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:48.880]  the bigger picture.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:49.880]  Thanks for calling.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.720]  Hey, Alex, pleasure to be on this show.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:56.280]  I'm calling from the Holy Land and I'm a U.S. and Israeli citizen.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:59.120]  So the comment is simple, it's really about peaceful revolution.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:05.640]  Look, we know the world's in it's days, physically, mentally, financially, spiritually.
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:08.440]  Question is, how do we supercharge the message and wake up the world?
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:14.720]  A couple quick thoughts, quick comment, and we all know it's only through peaceful revolution.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:21.000]  So how do we get you and others aligned with you and that following your footsteps to continue
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  to win the fight?
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.200]  There's only one way and it's really just to supercharge the message.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:29.120]  So if you think about it, young people were always the ones who would usually lead the
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.120]  protest.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:34.120]  Remember in the 60s, if you may not remember, if I remember, and in the U.S.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:39.520]  Nowadays we have a bunch of brain dead, socially media, social media addicted young folks.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:45.280]  I don't know what it's like to protest peacefully face to face and who's left?
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:49.360]  Those of us who understand the past, how do we affect this change in the now?
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.680]  If you think back to January 6th, that was a whole different scene.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:57.640]  There were peaceful people, but they were mainly from what I could see, older folks.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.080]  How do we get to the young people?
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.080]  That's the big question.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.520]  And then a quick thought for you.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:06.280]  You guys need to have an international power hour.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:09.880]  Maybe take international calls, maybe once a week for an hour.
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:13.680]  And I think if you do something, maybe even if it's country specific, you'll expand the
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.920]  message and you'll more effectively get to the people out there.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.480]  I totally agree with you, yes.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:24.200]  We need, in fact, we've said before, get foreign calls, but we should have at least
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.720]  once a week, an hour or two, where we take international calls only.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.720]  That's a great idea.
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:29.720]  Yeah.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:34.640]  And one other quick thought, and I know you know this and you're a pretty humble guy,
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.680]  even though you're pretty strong.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:38.720]  You're the leader of the peaceful revolution right now.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.640]  We have to expand the message.
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.240]  And I think that's one way to do it.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.440]  And in terms of bringing more income into the company, you've got to get your products
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:47.440]  kosher.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.720]  That's in a giant market.
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:52.720]  I'm not talking about the Jewish market, I'm talking about the giant Muslim market as
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.720]  well.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.720]  So think about that.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.720]  You'll bring in more money.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.720]  No, you're right.
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:57.920]  Well, I think our products pretty much are kosher.
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.480]  We just didn't think to do that, but you're right.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.440]  We need to do that.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:06.080]  And let's get the word out to the young people because that's where we're missing the vote.
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.400]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:13.360]  You know, people talk about kosher, but it really is Leviticus is a good idea.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:18.280]  And it's all health laws that are common sense.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:20.480]  Beyond kosher, we need non-GMO.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:26.360]  We need, we already have that, but we really need to, all of us do that because all the
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.400]  studies show it's so poisonous.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.400]  It's so bad.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:33.120]  And the Bible tells us, do not mix the seed.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.440]  And boy, are they mixing the seed.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.240]  They are crossing animals.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:39.800]  With humans, they're just doing everything and it's so dangerous.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.800]  But you mentioned international.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:44.680]  Hey, the new world order is attacking everybody.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:49.040]  It doesn't matter where you live or where you are.
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.080]  And so we should have a focus on the international.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.080]  We have a lot of foreign calls.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.080]  It's great.
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.520]  But whatever's happening in Australia, whatever's happening in Israel, whatever's happening
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:59.720]  in Brazil, whatever's happening in the UK, Russia, it's all affects you no matter where
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:00.720]  you are.
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:02.600]  This planet is so small folks.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.600]  Corey in Wyoming.
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.600]  Thanks for calling.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.600]  Go ahead.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.600]  Yes.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.600]  Hello, Alex.
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.600]  Yes, sir.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:15.080]  I wanted to ask all the info warriors to do a simple three-minute thing, which is to go
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.920]  to their hospital board meetings.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:18.920]  And I did this.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.800]  I was the only person in the public forum that spoke.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:29.720]  So I think it's really easy to do and simply ask for organic blood for transfusions.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.960]  I spent my three minutes.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:36.880]  I read the Twitter post that Greg Reese sprouted attention to of the baby Alex in Washington
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:45.040]  state that developed a blood clot from its knee to its, to his heart and died in 12 days
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.720]  because he didn't get the blood transfusion that their parents had set up through a donor
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.600]  from their church in, you know, ensuring organic blood.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:56.240]  Yeah, I've seen a bunch of those reports.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:01.520]  In fact, in today's stack on the vaccines, the so-called vaccines, all over the world,
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.960]  they're creating dating services of the uninjected.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:09.280]  People are demanding unvaxed blood, and that's going to be the next big business is going
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:13.920]  to be untainted blood that doesn't have the HIV spike protein in it.
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.320]  So they test so-called blood for the HIV spike protein, but now they're having to pass it
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.880]  through saying, well, it's not really HIV, it's just a spike protein.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.280]  We need to make this a big issue.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.240]  And that alone will stop these poison shots.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.320]  What you're saying is absolutely avant-garde and where the future's at.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.320]  Yes.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:35.400]  I mean, if you're driving on an interstate highway and you get in a car accident and
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:39.760]  you need blood at the hospital, it's a gamble.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:45.280]  On my Rumble channel, Organic Humans, I have my video of Demand Organic Blood for Transfusions
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:48.600]  to kind of illustrate to everybody how easy it is.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.240]  It's only three minutes, but it can make a large impact if everybody does it.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.240]  Say what?
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.240]  I'll air it.
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.240]  I'll air it.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.280]  That's on Rumble, and the video is called Organic Humans.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:03.080]  That's my channel, and the video is called Demand Organic Blood for Transfusion.
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.080]  Absolutely.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:08.160]  That is such a leverage point for us, not just to help people, but to educate people and
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:13.520]  to create markets of clean seeds, clean blood, what I was just talking about from Israel.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.520]  Amazing point, sir.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.520]  Thank you, Corey.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:16.520]  Guys, pull the video up.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:17.520]  Thank you.
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.520]  Alex in California, you're on the air.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.520]  Yeah.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.840]  Wow, I'm on the phone.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.840]  Yes, sir.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.840]  All right.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.880]  So there's a distraction within a distraction within a distraction.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:35.040]  The UFOs are a distraction from the COVID info and the war exploding, but COVID itself
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:40.000]  is a distraction of another distraction.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:49.120]  If you look at COVID-19, there's a 75-year period from 2019 to 1944 and 1945, which is
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:53.920]  essentially the end of World War II.
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:54.920]  Are you still online?
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.920]  Yep.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.920]  Your?
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:57.920]  Yep.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.920]  Yeah.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:02.760]  So the Vatican put a 75-year seal on records for 1944 and 1945.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:08.120]  So DW News did a documentary about it, where their researchers were actually only able
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:13.120]  to get one week of reading these documents, something like 20,000 documents.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.760]  They're only allowed to read it for one week before it had to shut down.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:16.760]  Okay.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:17.760]  What are the documents?
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.760]  I'm not following you.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:22.240]  It's documents related to the Holocaust and paperclip and everything like that.
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.520]  There was a 75-year seal on the records.
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:25.520]  Sure.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.520]  Okay.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:31.440]  That's just all I wanted to say, but this is a big game, a long picture.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:37.880]  Also about space, there's the Soyuz leak on the International Space Station.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.360]  It happened like a month ago.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.680]  I didn't see anyone cover it.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.120]  To me, that was a sign that this war is real.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:49.160]  It's not a, if you want to look at S-O-Y-U-Z, the Soyuz leak on the Russian Modules International
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.160]  Space Station.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.160]  Sure.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.520]  We know there's a big space war going on.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.640]  Yeah.
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:00.680]  If you go to liveua-map.com, it shows, I don't know if you've been there, but it has a lot
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.680]  of information.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:06.440]  It's like a military map, but it shows China is launching a lot of satellites right now.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.440]  That's all I really got to say.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.440]  Thank you for what you do.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:09.440]  The fish oil is great.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.440]  I've taken it.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:11.960]  You have really good dreams on the fish oil.
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:12.960]  God bless.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:13.960]  Absolutely.
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:17.000]  The fish oil is psychotropic when you sleep.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  Let's get on to another one.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.440]  Vance or Vince in New York.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.440]  Go ahead.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.440]  Hey, Alex.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.440]  Welcome.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.440]  How are you?
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.440]  Good.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:35.440]  Hey, Alex, you woke me up about 20 years ago with the 9-11 road to tyranny documentary.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:42.160]  And I wanted to bring that up because I saw that on a local access television station.
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:49.360]  An elderly couple was going down there and showing your videos once a week.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.840]  And I happened to stumble across it going through the channels.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:56.360]  And I wanted to bring that up just to give everybody hope.
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.800]  Take action, even if it's just a small action, because you don't know who's going to stumble
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.680]  across it.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:09.760]  And I watched that video, and I've been awake and telling everybody what's going on ever
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:17.120]  since, handing out DVDs and contributing as much as I can.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:22.520]  And so I just wanted to just pass that on to the listeners to just do something.
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:23.520]  Don't hang up.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.600]  I want you to be able to finish your point, Vince.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:32.360]  But yes, everybody knows about throwing a rock into a pond, and it sends ripples out.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.880]  But that's really what's happening here.
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:36.320]  You don't know what effect it's had.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.520]  You don't know what it's done.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:43.400]  Like I influenced, I talked to the makers of it, Gay Sex, that big video game in the
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:49.240]  early 2000s, and then that influenced Elon Musk, he said.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.160]  So I mean, you don't know.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:16:00.640]  I remember I met, a long time ago, Mike Judge, he said, you influenced King of the Hill.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.160]  I talk a lot about the great successes and full wars this had.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:09.040]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.040]  us.
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:13.520]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:19.040]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:22.520]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:27.880]  every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.000]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.320]  I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.320]  us.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.400]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.280]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:49.200]  products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:52.720]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWars.com.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:57.760]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWars.com, our fighting problems will
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:58.760]  be over.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:16:59.760]  Please take action now.
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:02.800]  InfoWars MD is finally here.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.120]  It's the very same high quality products you've been getting through InfoWars Life, but an
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:13.240]  expanded catalog, and in some cases the prices are lower because we're going directly to
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:18.440]  the source that was supplying the supplement companies that we were buying our high quality
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.440]  products from.

[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:08.400]  Well so do I, and I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalist
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.880]  and I've got their number and I know how to bring them down.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:17.160]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support, and the good news is we're only
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:22.360]  under about $200,000 a month, the bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.760]  on every front, but I'm not going to back down, and I'll never give up, but I could
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.760]  give out.
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:30.040]  So please keep me on the field, keep me on the front lines against the enemy, while
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:33.720]  getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.760]  fight, not part of it going towards product cost.

[01:19:53.120 --> 01:20:00.920]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:27.520]  Meeting of Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:31.920]  I want to address something that our first caller yet brought up, then I'll go back to
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:35.160]  your phone calls.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:46.720]  I have four children, and two of them are of driving age, the third one is about to
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:52.120]  be a driving age, and my son showed some interest in driving, but he had to be pushed
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:59.440]  a little, and then my eldest daughter, who's an incredible person, I wish she wanted to
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:03.800]  be public, she'd be on the show, she's so smart, so beautiful, so amazing, I was like
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:12.520]  Marilyn Monroe, she really kind of didn't want to drive, and we pushed her to do it,
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:16.480]  and finally she's 18, she finally got a driver's license a few months ago, and now she loves
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:21.720]  it, and I tried to keep phones and computers away from them, but by the time they hit 16
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:26.720]  or so, it's very hard, they get all the dopamine they need from the games and talk to their
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:32.320]  friends, and they think Ubers are the way to go, and they just don't get, they're not learning
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:36.720]  the next skill for life, and so that's how they're extinct in cars, it's not just creating
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:44.200]  systems that don't work, not just increasing gas prices, but training young people to not
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:50.640]  want to go out and do things in the world, and all the studies and actuaries and information
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.360]  show that, and so they made a big joke about it a few months ago, and I said calculators
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:58.000]  are really destroying our minds, well they admit no one knows basic reading, writing,
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:04.680]  and arithmetic now, they've done the language down, this is a plan to basically make us obsolete,
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:10.240]  just like 90% of us don't know how to farm, well think how that makes us totally controllable,
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:14.480]  so here's some headlines dealing with this, millennials don't drive, and here's why they
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:20.680]  aren't likely to start any time soon, and the media celebrates that, the reasons why
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:25.480]  millennials aren't as car craze as baby boomers, and how self driving cars fit in, yeah you
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:29.960]  don't need to know how to drive a car, computer will do it for you, millennials are right
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:37.200]  to kill the car, New York Post gets it right, why lazy entitled millennials can't last
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:42.480]  90 days at work, see why some millennials are lazy and entitled, yet they may be the most
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:50.840]  successful generation of our time, and it goes on from there, if you look at the spectrums
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:57.520]  and there's big analysis and studies out there, we've covered them, the more liberal you are,
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:03.160]  the more urban you are, and the more you don't know how to change a filter in your house,
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:08.080]  the more you don't know how to mow your yard, the more you don't want to own anything, the
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:16.240]  more you just accept the system that's predatory and is cornering you and domesticating you,
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:20.920]  I know so many people that have never shot a gun, so many people never been in a fist
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:26.040]  fight, so many people don't know how to change a tire, so many people don't know how to unclog
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:35.400]  a toilet, so many people don't know how to fry eggs or cook a steak or, not just an easy
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:39.160]  meal to make, they don't know the enjoyment of getting out a cookbook and learning and
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:44.120]  testing and how you're designed to do it and how fun it is to cook.
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:50.080]  Their idea is Uber Eats, but when you don't know how to grow food or cook food or fix
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:56.320]  the electricity or screw in a light bulb, really what are you, worthless?
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:04.040]  And the left celebrates how worthless they are, and they laugh and joke about people
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.640]  that do know how to do something.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.840]  We're like aliens to them, and I love folks in New York, I know a lot of hard working
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:12.360]  great people in New York and construction, you name it, but I can't tell you how many
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:18.840]  times in my life I'd be on a trip or wherever or somebody down here visiting and they'd
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:25.760]  say, yeah, I thought all you Texas rode to work in horses, and you know, that's the idea
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:36.920]  these people have, but I'll tell you, my family with horses and cows and pine tree logging
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:49.720]  operations and Christmas tree operations and great vineyards, you take a domesticated
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:57.440]  leptice that's grown up their life in a high rise, 500,000 foot apartment, and you take
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:08.400]  them to my family in East Texas, and there's not even a connection these people, and they'd
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.560]  look at my cousins and my family, driving around on tractors and bailing hay and doing
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:18.400]  all this and go, look at them hillbillies, meanwhile those hillbillies are engineers,
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.760]  those hillbillies have spent decades in the military, those hillbillies have flown helicopters
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:28.180]  in combat, those hillbillies know how to build your building you live in, those hillbillies
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:34.600]  know how to run electricity, those hillbillies know how to kick your ass and shoot a gun
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:44.080]  and grow a garden, and those hillbillies you take you out in the woods and say, you got
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:51.240]  a sore throat, take that plant, that mushroom's edible, that mushroom's not, look at this chicken
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:56.760]  of the forest, particular yellow fungus that grows in the back of trees, you can slice
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:01.760]  off and cook up with some olive oil that tastes like chicken and is super good for you, full
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:09.120]  of item B12, they think we're space aliens because we know how to skin a buck, we know
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:16.920]  how to run a trot line, and if we need to, we know how to open up a can of whoop ass
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:23.080]  and we know how to shoot bulls eye at 400 yards and we know how to blast a dub out of
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:29.440]  the air and we know how to fix a tractor and we know how to take care of our children when
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:34.880]  they're sick and we know how to save money and we know how to get on our knees to Jesus
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:43.160]  Christ and I'll take my hillbilly people any day over the domesticated folks that live
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:50.080]  in these crime filled urban hell holes and I don't think of myself as elitist or better
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:57.360]  than them, I actually feel sorry for these people and I feel sorry that I'm way more
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:03.640]  disconnected from the land than my grandfathers or my father and my children are more disconnected
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:11.480]  from me and that is my failure, so what are we doing now, you'll see me sometimes take
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:18.240]  all three, four days, where's Alex, I'm out there running the chainsaw cutting down trees,
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:27.680]  I'm planting Christmas trees that we sell, I'm feeding cows, I'm riding horses, I'm
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:34.360]  doing what I'm supposed to do and I'm as high as a kite without any drug, without anything,
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:40.240]  getting up at 4.30 in the morning, cooking breakfast for my family and then at 6am when
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:48.840]  the sun comes up, when it's still dark, getting in a tractor and bailing hay and then feeding
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:59.680]  the cows and then feeding sugar cookies to the pony and then at night I'm sitting around
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:06.060]  that bonfire looking up at the stars deep in the heart of Texas and that's what we're
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:09.720]  meant to do, that's what we're designed to do and anybody that tries to take you out
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:22.040]  of that is a liar and is a fraud. All my family have other incredible skills, how to run generators,
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:31.640]  how to fix trains, how to do it all and I look at that and I feel so sorry for people
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.680]  that are domesticated and I tell you, the future is human and we're going to defeat
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:41.160]  this new world order. We're going to come back with your phone calls across the board

[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:11.320]  Info wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago. And today, whether it's Donald
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:18.080]  Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that info wars
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:22.280]  has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat

[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.080]  the very tip of the spear and ensure we stand the field in this war against the new world

[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:35.280]  to get to the children, they've got to get through us first. These monsters are all over
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:38.640]  television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies. They're already given to the pregnant
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:43.320]  women. Miscarriages are off the chart. 80 plus percent increase of miscarriages in the first
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:49.200]  two prime ministers after these poison shots. We can and will save the children and they
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:54.200]  are counting on us. Let's do it together. And the fight starts at infowarstore.com and
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:33:01.040]  the fight continues with your financial support at infowarstore.com. Now take action now.
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:07.040]  Presenting a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:57.040]  All right, mention New York. You held over to make your point. Rock into a pond. Go ahead.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:07.400]  I just wanted to add, you know, here in America, we're so far removed from the rugged individualism
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:15.480]  that built this country. And I really would love to see us get back to that. And I just
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:21.360]  think there's a lot of factors contributing to that. You know, we have the whole fatherless
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:25.160]  epidemic in our country. You know, fathers, you know, they're good for kicking their boys
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:30.120]  out of the house and getting them out there to do stuff and, you know, teaching them,
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:35.600]  teaching them trades and, you know, you know, just teaching them how to be a man. And the
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:41.240]  whole single mom epidemic and fatherless epidemic that we got in the country is just the United
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:46.240]  States is the most fatherless country in the world. That's the globalist operation. Their
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:50.720]  mission is almost complete. That's exactly what we're talking about, brother.
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:56.000]  And I just wanted to say real quick, you know, I'm a practiser of McTowell, which stands
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.800]  for men going their own way. And that movement is really gaining traction in this country
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:08.640]  because men are getting destroyed in family court and divorce court and, you know, Title
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.640]  4D and all this stuff.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:15.520]  Oh, men are totally admittedly targeted. I played Paul Erlich, top globalist a few weeks
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:20.040]  ago saying in the 1970, we're going to target the men. We're going to destroy the men. That
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:23.480]  will destroy the family. I mean, it is an admitted plan.
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:29.600]  Yeah. And it's really having an effect. And we've got to raise awareness because we've
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:34.760]  got to get these laws changed in these courts so that men aren't getting wrecked and, you
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:37.720]  know, becoming, you know, payslaves and indentured servants.
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:42.240]  And it's starting to happen, brother. I appreciate your call. Great points. All right. Next up
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:47.560]  is resist warrior or reset warrior. Sorry. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:53.160]  All right. So you're pumped from yesterday about what does this all mean that these people
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:57.960]  are out in the open and they're admitting who they are and that they're in trouble.
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:02.440]  I think that it primarily means that, you know, if you look at two gladiators in the
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:08.920]  fight, one, their primary weapon is truth. Their primary weapon is deceit and they can
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:14.720]  no longer deceive. So, you know, I feel like we've disarmed them. And now what we have
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:19.880]  to do is, which a lot of callers are coming in and saying, we have to now go and with
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:25.720]  the final blow with the truth, get these people, you know, to the end of their rope.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:30.280]  I agree. How scared do you think they are that now it's mainline to say, I hate the
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:33.600]  new world order and global government and the new world order is running at all and
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:38.000]  mainline pundits are against it. I mean, the worm is turning.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:44.040]  Yeah. I mean, they're definitely scared. And, you know, these people are ultimately people,
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:48.520]  you know, and they're conditioned to operate in secrecy. So now that they can no longer
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:53.040]  deny who they are, they're just flopping. I mean, look at the, the clip that Harrison
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:57.480]  played this morning, the Pentagon official being like, Oh, you know, I barely even got
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:04.680]  a degree in history. Like a general or a Pentagon official would be their primary focus is history
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:10.280]  because I mean, it's just they're flopping. They're in trouble, man.
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.280]  I agree. But what are they going to try to stay in control?
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:18.600]  I don't know. I almost feel like some of the things we're seeing these chemical train
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:24.120]  derailments. I mean, that I don't know any details on the, that black Hawk downing in
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:29.040]  Arizona, but these, the systemic collapse. I mean, I think that that's already part
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:34.360]  of it. So we're seeing them flailing. I can't say I don't know how bad it's going to get.
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:39.840]  I mean, I know how much we talk about nuclear war on this show, but I just, we're going
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:42.240]  to have to see, we're just going to have to keep pushing with the truth and
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:45.760]  no, you're right. You can feel it. You can see it. Thank you for the call, sir. Steve
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:51.000]  in South Carolina, you're on the air. God, God bless you, brother and your family and
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:56.960]  the Infa Wars crew. If I got time, I want to make two points, one on the war, but mainly
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:07.720]  on the shots, the poison shots. They are definitely in my opinion, the number one crime of a century.
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:10.960]  I mean, I agree. And it's, it's not just this current attack. It's so horrible.
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:18.960]  Millions dead, tens of millions sick. It's the takeover of our bodies. Correct. And it's
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:26.800]  ongoing and it's a constant war that we are at battle with the globalists. But I want
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:33.240]  to, the one point that I wanted to bring up was Dr. Mercola a couple days ago on his
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:39.720]  website. He released the article and there's the United States National Center for Health
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:47.520]  Statistics, the NCHS. And now what they're doing is they have created a code. It's called
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:55.520]  ICD dash 10 code. And that is being used by all of our primary care physicians. When you
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:02.960]  go to the doctors and they're reporting using this code, everybody that is unvaxxed. Yes,
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:07.720]  I saw that in the news a month ago in a legal database who's not taking the poison shot.
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:11.640]  Then they discriminate against people. Rand Paul's introduced a bill to outlaw that, but
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:16.480]  that is just outrageous. Total Nuremberg violation, absolute criminal activity.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:21.720]  Yes. And they're going to try to use it to bring in the digital passports and the digital
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:27.360]  IDs, of course. And the reason I bring that up, and I wanted to make a quick point about
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:33.000]  the war, because I'm like a lot of other callers and you and everybody else, you know, we're
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.480]  all worried about nuclear war. Like Dr. Boyle said, we're like 15 seconds away. And Colonel
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:46.080]  McGregor, he did an interview, I can't remember, but I watched it the other day. And he was
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:54.120]  talking about how Ukraine, they're going to be, his words were annihilated, no matter
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:57.800]  how bad the Russians get yet, no matter how many tanks.
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:00.720]  No, they're not going to stop. The Russians never stop.
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:07.480]  No, sir. They're not. And, you know, these are the things that freaked me out more than
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:13.480]  anything about the war. And, you know, when you got Putin saying, look, I'm not at war
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:21.680]  with the American people. I'm not at war with the people in Europe. He even says, Putin,
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:26.720]  I'm at war with the New World Order globalist.
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:31.160]  Which is true as they're having meetings announcing it. Thank you for the call. Great point, sir.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:34.720]  We've got some breaking news I'm going to hit when the next segment starts. There's been
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:41.040]  a new massive train derailment in Michigan, a chemical train, and reports are it's already
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:45.720]  smoking. We're going to cover that coming up next segment as I'm giving the articles.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:52.600]  But let's go back to your calls. Robert in Thailand, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:56.040]  Thank you, Alex. I wanted to get back to you about the X3. You asked me to give you an
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:59.560]  update on that. I got it out here in Thailand, received it really well. Thank you guys for
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:03.800]  sending that out here. It had a huge effect with my biohacking plugged right in. I felt
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:11.520]  amazing getting some more ASAP. I wanted to thank you for being one of the two biggest
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:16.360]  influences in my life as a freedom fighter. You and Rick Simpson were the two people
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:22.160]  who set me on the path to be a freedom fighter and spread the truth. The Rick Simpson story
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:28.560]  run from the cure is a huge, you know, the previous caller said COVID crime is the biggest,
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:32.200]  but this actually is bigger than the COVID crime because knowledge of the endocannabinoid
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:37.160]  system would save tens of millions of lives in cancer. There is no doubt in thousands
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:43.520]  of studies that remove the THC that gets you, quote, high that what is in CBD and what is
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:48.240]  in the plant is the most magic plant God gave us and what it does for people that have epilepsy
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.840]  and narcolepsy and all these other neurological disorders. I mean, people see in the videos
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:42:00.560]  where somebody that's, you know, serious Parkinson's an hour after taking a high-powered CBD is
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:06.400]  having no tremors. I mean, it's incredible. It's fast-acting. You can see it in the videos.
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:10.200]  You can see the studies. There's a lot of it in history. Run from the cure is the documentary.
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:13.840]  I recommend people duck, duck, go check that out. Rick Simpson would be a great guest if
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:15.680]  you'd ever be willing to have him on.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:20.080]  I'll get him on. Yeah, I'm familiar with the work. We'll get him on.
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.080]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:26.800]  Thank you. Yeah, we sell high-end, highest-quality CBD oil at about half off what you buy at
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:30.800]  stores. And we've had outside groups tested and say, oh my God, you're selling the highest
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:36.360]  quality full-spectrum CBD, 1000 milligram, 25 milligram and 10 milligram. And yeah, it's
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:41.560]  there. And people take it. It blows them away. It's an infowarstore.com and sports broadcast.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:45.920]  You're crazy. We don't get it, especially for joint pain. You name it. I take it almost
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:50.400]  every day because I never got my Achilles fixed. I have no Achilles and it's painful
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:43:00.000]  as hell. I'm on. I don't take this. I feel it. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.600]  Infowar's secret weapon is finally here. It's a secret weapon for your immune system,
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:08.960]  for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life, for your libido. And it also
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:16.360]  keeps info wars on the air. And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for

[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:24.680]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:28.480]  some of the top names. They then give us the best deal out there because the owner is a

[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:07.560]  needs to support info wars and band.video. You know, the Bible says let another mouth
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:12.760]  praise you. I'm going to do that right now. Alex Jones has helped so many people in this
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:18.680]  industry. You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:23.680]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones,
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:27.880]  including myself. I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:32.360]  of this platform. And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:36.680]  weren't for Alex Jones. I mean, I've been able to be on podcast with Alex and Joe Rogan
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:42.760]  and Tim cast the super Tim cast IRL. Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:47.560]  and band.video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone. We need

[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:06.480]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:15.640]  our so called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private. In 2007, Alex
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:22.000]  Jones releases end game, exposing the world elites plans for covertly using biological
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:28.440]  weapons against all of mankind. And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:35.080]  Jones's info wars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:41.320]  that we knew were coming. This is why they attack us. This is why we need your support
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:48.560]  because we tell the truth. Alex Jones was right. Join the resistance by products, donate
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:55.120]  to the cause, share the links, join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:47:01.280]  World Order.
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:15.960]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:22.360]  How many times have I got to tell you? I know I'm interconnected to all of you. If I'm
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:28.360]  going to win, you got to win. The resources in this universe are unlimited.
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:38.360]  How many times must I tell you, baby? How many bridges I've got to cross? How many times
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:44.360]  must I explain myself? Oh, I can talk to the boss.
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:48.360]  How many times? Oh, I can talk to the boss.
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:54.600]  Well, I've seen different statistics, but we've got basically a 3000% increase in infrastructure
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:48:01.080]  breakdown in the last two years. Power stations, food processing centers, train derailments,
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:04.760]  chemical plant fires, oil plant fires. You don't need me to tell you about it. You can
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:14.880]  see it every day. And now, the sixth derailment in the last 30 days, the fourth in two weeks,
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:20.160]  train derails outside Detroit, Michigan with one car carrying hazardous materials. Fox News
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:25.880]  reports a train containing one car of hazardous materials as he railed Thursday in Van Buren
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:31.880]  Township outside Detroit, Michigan. Reports say the cause of the derailment was not immediately
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:36.360]  clear. There was a big derailment outside Chicago yesterday. A train containing one
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:41.360]  car of hazardous materials has derailed in Van Buren Township. The cause of the derailment
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:44.720]  was not immediately clear. Authorities responded to the train derailment in Van Buren Township
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:52.320]  in Detroit. Officials that spoke to WXYZ, I'm not joking, that's a TV station, WXYZ,
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:57.320]  which reported that at least six cars were seen off the tracks said one of them was carrying
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:03.640]  hazardous materials. We're going to continue to cover that as it unfolds. We are taking
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:09.080]  your phone calls right now, but more important than going to infowarstore.com and getting
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:13.960]  great products you need to fund the operation that enrich us all and empower us all is spreading
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:20.840]  the word. Every day when this live show ends we archive and demand out video by subject
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:26.280]  and that's how we fight the new world order. People are ready to be waken up. People are
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:30.600]  ready for the truth, but it's only you that can carry the ball. Let's talk to John in
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:37.600]  Mexico. Thanks for holding John. You are a veteran confronted mayor of Houston. That's
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:41.200]  what the headline, that's what the piece of information you gave us. What are you talking
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:46.480]  about, John? Hey, how are you doing? How are you doing? I just wanted to start by sending
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:50.760]  this honor of being a part of your show. I've been watching you about 10, 15 years. I really
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:55.600]  do appreciate all the dollars that you put out. And I want to also say to rest in peace
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:00.120]  to my grandfather. He passed away this morning. I just got worried about an hour ago. So
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:05.360]  say his name. Let's, let's, let's give him a good send off here. Oh, his name is beautiful
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:10.200]  horn. My grandpa beautiful horn. He was 90 years old. Pass away this morning. I wanted
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:14.560]  to say rest in peace to beautiful horn. Appreciate that. Man, that's a cool name. That sounds
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:22.520]  like a badass. Yeah, he was a badass. He was bad 90 years. He was a badass. But he reminds
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:28.960]  me so much of you. As you know, right now I'm in Mexico and I've been going through
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:34.240]  a lot. But what we're doing now is I'm about to run for the mayor of Houston. So I'll be
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:40.520]  back in Texas. I'm from Dallas, but I'll be back in Texas next week to run for the mayor
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:46.880]  of Houston because they, it's a big cover up going on in Houston right now. And what
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:51.720]  happened was they compared me to you. They was calling me the black college Jones on
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:56.600]  YouTube. Wait a minute. I saw that. That's you. I saw that a couple of months ago. Yeah.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:01.200]  Yeah, that's me. That's me. Oh, we went out. I told my producers get you on as a guest.
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:04.400]  I guess they couldn't get ahold of you. I forget your name. What's your name? We'll
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:08.600]  pull it up. If you type in the black Alex Jones of Houston, I forget what you were
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:14.440]  talking about. Was it a shooting or something or crime? Yeah, it was a shooting. It was
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:20.160]  a shooting that happened. And what happened was the mayor covered it up and I showed up
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:26.480]  at the mayor. He had a Tuesday morning meeting. So I flew from Mexico to Houston, showed up
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:33.360]  at the meeting and I confronted him with the recording of the chief center, his wife, saying
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:39.080]  that if y'all want to know who kid take off, get the best around the phone. I'll tell y'all
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:44.160]  who kid take off if you get the mayor on the phone. And when I showed up and showed that,
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:47.480]  you know, they wanted to arrest me. Not exist, but it was out of the back story. Tell them
[01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:54.800]  what happened with the shooting. Well, what happened was a take off was at a dice game
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:52:02.280]  with a J Prince son in Houston, Texas. And he got, he got, he got shot. They, they tried
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:07.440]  to say it was friendly fire, but it was more involved. They took his chain and all that.
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:12.160]  So what we did was we have, we have a page on YouTube called paperwork party and we actually
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.600]  solved the murder. But the bad thing about it is, is the mayor was involved. So we had
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:21.920]  to confront him and why do they call you the black Alex Jones? I remember watching the
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:26.440]  video you were in their face. Yeah. Well, the reason they called me the black Alex Jones
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:33.520]  is because I've had three YouTube pages. Every last one of my YouTube pages has been demonetized.
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:38.440]  And I keep coming back. I keep coming back. I've been drugged through federal court. I
[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:44.400]  just beat a federal case against an attorney in Houston, Texas called Dennis Spurling.
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:49.040]  He had something to do with the murder of Kevin Samuels on the paperwork party. We had a
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:54.640]  paperwork party show on YouTube and we pulled the paperwork from the medical examiners and
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:59.120]  the woman that was in the apartment was the woman that he sent. And we revealed it on
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:03.240]  the show and we tried to talk to the mayor of Atlanta about that. You said, I'm saying
[01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:07.680]  what they did, they sued me. They came after me hard. I'm to my Alex. They can't, that's
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:11.640]  why they called me the back black Alex Jones because I beat that case, but they came after
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:13.760]  me hard, hard, hard.
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:18.000]  Well, sir, we'll get your info that I'll have to go back and look at the case. I remember
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.800]  seeing it in the news, but I appreciate you calling us sir. God bless you. Wow. See, I'm
[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:28.200]  following this stuff. Uh, Beverly in California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:35.800]  Hey, Alex, um, you woke me up in 2007 with end game when I was about 19. And since then
[01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:41.360]  I've always wanted to be a prepper, but I was a little too busy being young and dumb.
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:47.920]  So I'm 35 now, a little bit smarter. And I wanted to give out my telegram handle, which
[01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:55.200]  is tank girl 24 and see if there are any info warrior preppers who need people to work the
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:54:01.320]  land. Please get in touch with me. And also I'm not sure if this already exists, but have
[01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:04.440]  you thought about it info wars social network?
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:08.240]  You know, we tried to do it and we just got hacked an attack. We don't have the money
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:12.480]  to build one that doesn't get shut down because they're very easy to manipulate and attack
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:17.840]  from different angles and shut down both cyber attacks, but also infiltrators that get on
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:22.160]  and do a bunch of bad stuff. But yes, the whole future is going to be awake humans getting
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:27.960]  together and moving to the countryside together. And what you're saying is about farmers and
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:33.080]  ranchers and people trying to hire outside folks come in and train them to actually build
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:36.040]  new communities. That's going to be the future.
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:43.120]  I think exposing the agenda is as much of a threat as networking and coming together.
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:50.280]  No, I hear you. We're trying to expose the threat exactly. They censor us and they keep
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:56.320]  us from communicating with each other because that's how we spread more information.
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:59.440]  I appreciate your call Beverly Kaylee in Arizona. Go ahead.
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:03.520]  Oh my. Can you hear me? I can. Thanks for calling.
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:07.600]  Thank you so much. I just want to start off and say thank you for your service and everything
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:13.680]  that you do. I've been listening to you since I was 18 years old. I'll be 26 next month.
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:18.160]  My boyfriend always teases me. He calls me a little Alexa Jones, but I'm fired up. I'm
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:22.680]  awake, you know, and I just wanted to share with you some information I saw this morning
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:28.920]  and see what you think about it. It was a video filmed in Ohio and it's dated Wednesday
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:37.160]  2 15 2023 and there's about 20 hazardous trucks. You know, those like metal tank trucks driving
[01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:45.360]  into a town in Ohio labeled with 30 82 a hazardous chemical label. The woman that recorded the
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:51.520]  video asked one of the drivers, Hey, what is in there? And he said water. Well, I did
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.360]  my research on what 30 82 is and you can too. And all the comments obviously wanted to detail
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:04.160]  about it. It's nickel oxide. And supposedly it's an emission catalyst, but I wanted to
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:07.640]  get your opinion on this, Alex. What do you say? I'm not a chemist. So I don't know,
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:10.840]  but it sounds like they're wanting to burn up what's left because they don't want to
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:16.400]  get in the water supply. Right. Or how do you feel about the water supply? If if that's
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:20.400]  what you're saying, are you saying that this chemicals an accelerant? I mean, I don't know.
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:25.240]  I'm not a chemist. It's so nickel oxide is supposed to be an emission catalyst. And it's
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:29.840]  obviously a carcinogen not healthy for us. But I mean, I guess you think they're just
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:34.080]  going to dump it over the site. You call it an ignition catalyst. That would be an accelerant
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:39.120]  right? Yeah, right. Correct. I'm just a little concerned about this because I mean, let me
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:43.200]  do their default was to say no problem. Now they're admitting it's really dangerous. Almost
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:46.920]  all the animals in the area are dying. And it's just default for them to cover it up.
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:50.640]  So I agree with you. We should all be watching it. I did not know about that. Can you can
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:54.640]  I put you on hold? Can you tell the crew where you found that? We will pull it up. Yeah,
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:59.680]  absolutely. Thank you, Kaylee. Appreciate your call. Since you talk about chemicals in the
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:05.840]  water, here's what's gonna happen. I've got that stack of news right here. So we're gonna
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:11.920]  go to break. We're gonna come back. And I'm going to get to that stack of news I have
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:19.920]  prepared today. Then we'll take more calls. And then we'll get into the incredible vaccine
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:25.600]  news that is just insane. I can't say it's the biggest news ever because we kind of
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:30.640]  peaked out here. I mean, it's causing heart attacks, you know, strokes death doesn't help
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:35.120]  you erase your immune system gives you AIDS. I mean, it's just like, it's totally insane.
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:42.880]  But this stack is insane. But first, when we come back, they admitted major studies that
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:52.080]  chemicals are feminizing our boys. Stay with us. I talk a lot about the great successes
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:57.600]  Info Wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it. And it is because of listeners and
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:02.080]  viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes,
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:09.120]  the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:14.160]  Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.

[01:59:55.840 --> 02:00:10.400]  Let me whisper the terrible word from the old English, from the old German, from the old Norse.
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:25.520]  Chinese spy balloons consistently flying over the U.S. as green lasers from Chinese satellites
[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:32.880]  are spotted over Hawaii. Food production facilities up in flames, egg production sabotaged, fuel
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:39.360]  pipelines causing statewide emergencies, power grids attacked. All of these multiplying and
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:45.040]  alarming occurrences consistently relegated to independent reporting. Boy, next they'll be
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:50.240]  coming for the water. Oh wait, they are. Less than a month into the Biden administration was also a
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:58.000]  highly sophisticated attack on the water supply outside Tampa. Vanellis County Sheriff Bob Galtieri
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:04.160]  says a water treatment plan operator first noticed the remote access hack. The bad actor increased
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:10.240]  the amount of sodium hydroxide or lie in the water supply from 100 parts per million to more than
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:16.880]  11,000. This type of activity and this type of hacking of critical infrastructure is not necessarily
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:22.720]  limited to just water supply systems. It can be anything. There was hundreds. Russell Murphy is
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:28.880]  referring to the fish now belly up in Leslie Run. He and his wife noticed them last night,
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:36.000]  barely 48 hours after the fiery derailment five miles away. We basically nuked a town with chemicals
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:43.040]  so we could get a railroad open. More than 250 trains have derailed in just the last decade.
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:49.680]  Half of those contained hazardous waste. Two more train derailments were just added to the pile in
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:55.920]  Texas and South Carolina. 10 days prior, the controlled burn of vinyl chloride in East
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:02.880]  Palestine, Ohio, contains the foul stench of the corpocratic disregard for human life at the very
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:07.840]  least. Vinyl chloride is very hazardous and very flammable. The other thing about vinyl chloride
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:12.480]  is that it boils at eight degrees Fahrenheit, so it's shipped in its liquid form, meaning that when
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:17.840]  these trains crashed and these started leaking, they weren't just leaking liquid, but they were
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:23.440]  spewing, boiling gas. There's maybe a million pounds of this toxic chemical spilling into the
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:28.720]  ground and also boiling off into the air. Of the many byproducts of burning vinyl chloride,
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:33.840]  one of them is hydrogen chloride. Hydrogen chloride is really unstable and latches onto
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:39.840]  water, like this water vapor in the atmosphere, and that turns into hydrochloric acid. So right
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:43.760]  now, government officials, officials from the railroad, both the governor of Pennsylvania and
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:50.080]  Ohio are calling burning off the million pounds of this stuff a success, but not mentioning that it
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:55.520]  means that we have hundreds of thousands of pounds of acid in the air. This is a f***ing success.
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:07.280]  That ain't no f***ing storm cloud. That's a f***ing f***ing police policy. They're f***ing controlled burn.
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:13.680]  Lobbyists have successfully seen to it that their trains and an emergency electronic controlled
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:21.680]  pneumatic brake system carrying the chemicals don't face federal regulations. Organized pandemics,
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:27.840]  cultural jackbooting, unyielding and increasing scarcity of food, water, and energy, weather
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:35.200]  manipulation, and airborne toxic events make for the perfect storm when subjected to an impending
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:42.240]  EMP event that would easily drive the masses and imprison those that objected into the detainment
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:52.000]  camps built under the guise of illegal immigration and documented in the 2010 Army publication 3-39.40.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:59.200]  That's right. Humans can actually cause earthquakes. All it takes in most areas is a little extra push,
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:04.800]  a little extra stress introduced in the right way on pre-existing faults and fractures to
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:10.240]  cause small earthquakes. U.S. Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said on the 28th of April 1997
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:14.560]  at the conference on terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, U.S. Strategy University of Georgia
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:19.840]  while discussing the dangers of false threats, as a quote, others are engaging even in an eco type
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:24.960]  of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely for the
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:31.280]  use of electromagnetic waves. And who is the leader in that? The U.S. and Russia. And completion
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:36.320]  of tests in the months ahead of these new superweapons long advertised by the Kremlin head, Russian
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:41.520]  President Vladimir Putin, but often thought by U.S. officials to simply be too terrifying
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:47.280]  to ever be possible. As a soft and silent war creeps among the heartland under the
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:05:02.320]  compromised foreign oversight of the Biden New World Order doctrine, John Bown reporting.
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:22.880]  Concentrated chicken broth, the strongest out there with chocolate mushroom and a whole bunch
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:28.000]  of other ingredients like turmeric, the list goes on and on. This is definitely the strongest,

[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:37.280]  And we can skin a buck, we can run a trot line and a country boy can survive, country folks can
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:54.000]  survive. I had a good friend in New York City, he never called me by my name, just killed Billy.
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:07:01.440]  My friend Paul taught me how to live off the land and he has taught him to be a business man.
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:12.320]  He used to send me pictures of the broth waiting night and I'd send him some homemade wine.
[02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:23.760]  But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife for $43, my friend lost his life.
[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:30.800]  I'd like to spit some beach nut in that dude's eyes, I'd love to spit some beach nut in that
[02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:41.440]  dude's eyes and shoot him with my old 45 called the country boy can survive, country folks can survive.
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.480]  Because you can.
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:52.320]  Because you can't stop a loud and you can't make a run, but with an old boy raised on shotgun.
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:08:00.160]  We say grace and we say ma'am and you ain't in the sack, but don't give a damn.
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:03.760]  All right, let me hit this big news and go right back to your phone calls.
[02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:14.320]  It is a scientific fact for 100 years that things like atrazine and phthalates and a whole
[02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:21.600]  spectrum of chemicals attack and destroy testosterone, but they also attack and destroy
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:28.320]  chemicals in a woman's womb that make the fetus express the male characteristics of its chromosomes.
[02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:33.280]  So it's not turning the little boys in their mother's wombs into girls, it's turning them
[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:39.440]  more into eunuchs or drones and not expressing their male characteristics.
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:47.440]  In all the studies, what these chemicals do is hyper express the female characteristics
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:51.200]  and they go, oh, you're the feminist, you're the powerful superwoman.
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:57.200]  Yeah, you go into puberty not at 12, but at eight or five, some at two or three now.
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:04.560]  And you go into menopause at 30 instead of 45 or 50 and it shortens your life.
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:10.800]  And I've talked about this for decades and I noticed early on, when I would talk about it,
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:16.960]  national news, I mean, I'm talking 20 years ago, 15 years ago, would attack me everywhere.
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:23.200]  Saying this crazy guy says there's chemicals in the food and water that are manipulating you,
[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:28.720]  that are manipulating you, but I had the studies. So here's some headlines that deal with this.
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:33.200]  Science needs to stop using terms like male, female, mother and father, researchers say,
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:42.160]  New York Post. Alternative terms like male and female and mother and father should be
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:53.520]  removed because they are dehumanizing us in what we are.
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:58.640]  Here's another headline, university level gender unicorn teachers that chromosomes
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:05.120]  don't determine sex. That's redstate.com. And of course they do two plus two does not equal four.
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:14.320]  Here's another one. Gestational, that means in your mother's womb, exposure to phthalates and
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:20.880]  gender-related play behaviors in eight-year-old children, an observational study. And it's a study
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:32.080]  how babies in the womb that have been tested, the blood of the mother, show that if you have
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:37.280]  these chemicals in you, you are more feminine. And here's the study right here from PubMed.
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:52.160]  So they know exactly what they're doing. And they're hitting us with these chemicals and then
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:59.680]  people are confused because they don't have male hormones. They don't activate when they're
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:10.720]  10, 11, 12, 13. They never go into puberty as boys. The girls go into puberty early.
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:18.320]  And the boys then don't have those masculine chemicals in them that activate parts of the brain
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:27.280]  and activate instincts to go out and seek the opposite sex. And then you've got the depopulation
[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:35.600]  program. You want it. And the system knows exactly what it's doing. Then they confuse things.
[02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:41.840]  Bureau discretion is advised here, even though it's floored out. DeSantis reveals shocking porn
[02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:52.240]  books being removed from Florida schools. You see the headlines. DeSantis hates gay people.
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:12:02.480]  Don't say gay. That's not in the bill. They make the whole LGBTQ XYZP operation about being nice
[02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:07.040]  to the persecuted gay people that are all over the news, all over the TV, all over the culture,
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:10.480]  all over everything being forced fed to us because they don't produce children,
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:13.520]  see population, not against the people themselves, but that's the program.
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:20.800]  And then they sexualize children because all the studies show if you sexualize them early,
[02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:25.840]  they won't be in a monogamous relationship. They won't be in a nuclear family. And nuclear families
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:32.240]  are a powerful bulwark against tyranny and a bulwark to create prosperity and wealth and success
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:36.960]  because that's what we're supposed to do. It's how we're designed. So when they want to eradicate
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:43.360]  a moth or a fire ant or some other bug, they put chemicals out that confuse the sexual activities
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:48.160]  of those insects or animals so they don't reproduce. And that's all that's been done here.
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:50.960]  It's a scientific attack. Let's address it for what it is.
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:13:00.000]  But if you take Vincent Price and the Last Man on Earth, which was then remade from the 60s
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:06.560]  in the 70s into Omega Man and remade in the early 2000s as I Am Legend,
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:18.880]  for some reason, Vincent Price is immune. And the remake, Charlton Heston, is immune.
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:25.920]  And when they offer the zombies, most of them are dumb, but the ruling class is smart
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:32.640]  of the zombies, the vampires, their blood and say, I have a cure to fix you. They say, dude,
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:39.680]  we don't want to be fixed. We're going to kill you. And that's the allegory of this.
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:48.800]  We have the cure for people that have been chemical attacked. And we know how to help them,
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:58.720]  but they don't want to be helped. The testosterone of a male today at age 40 is one tenth of what it
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:06.800]  was in 1950. Look it up. Sperm counts are down over 90%. We're being murdered. Our biology,
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:15.360]  our design has been hacked and hijacked. And in the remake of The Last Man on Earth, Omega Man,
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:24.000]  Charlton Heston at the end says, I've learned I'm immune. I've got the antibodies. You can be
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:33.760]  healed right now. And the zombies say, we don't want to be healed. And they throw a spear into him.
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:38.640]  And they haul him up and they crucify him.
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:47.840]  And that's what this is. They're organizing all the people they've hit,
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:55.040]  that all the people they've hurt, all the people they've attacked into adopting what's been done
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:15:02.080]  to them. And that's what that globalist on an airline flight, so many years ago, 2006,
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:08.080]  whenever it was, I'm on American Airlines, first class flight to be on the view. And one of the
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:12.000]  heads of one of the three largest banks in the world is on the flight with me going to visit
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:19.120]  his dad had been a nursing home in San Antonio. And we have a three hour off the record conversation
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:23.760]  bought the record. I couldn't say his name. I said, I agree. He said, you don't get it.
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:31.760]  They're going to adopt the pressure and the attacks. They're not going to adopt and overcome
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:39.920]  like a Marine. They're going to adopt and overcome by submission to what we are doing to them.
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:47.200]  And that's it. It's incredible. And it's very, very sad.
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:52.480]  All right, your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen, are coming up on the other side
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:16:00.480]  of this broadcast break. Stay with us. I have an extremely important message to all of my

[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:05.520]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist. I have come from
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:12.080]  nowhere to the very heights of politics not just in America but in the world. We are engaging the
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:19.040]  globalist at point blank range in the information war but I don't deserve the credit. Yes, I persevered
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:24.080]  but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason you have the success
[02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:30.240]  we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:37.200]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important than
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:41.680]  ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:48.240]  tearing out and to intensify them. God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you and I beg you
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:53.280]  to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this week is happening.
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:56.880]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:02.400]  You want to beat the new world order? You want to stop their globalist agenda? Well so do I
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:07.680]  and I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalist and I've got their
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:12.640]  number and I know how to bring them down but ladies and gentlemen I can't do it without your
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:19.680]  support and the good news is we're only under about $200,000 a month. The bad news is the enemy
[02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:23.840]  is intensifying their attacks on every front but I'm not going to back down and I'll never give up
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:28.080]  but I could give out. So please keep me on the field. Keep me on the front lines against the
[02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:32.000]  enemy while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:45.360]  not part of it going towards product cost. But I thank you all for your support. Please

[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:03.200]  There is a war on for your mind. Your mind is a battlefield. This is an information war.
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:10.640]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago and today whether it's Donald Trump
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:17.840]  or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone they're all using the terms that Infowars has popularized
[02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:22.640]  because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them but we can't do it without
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:27.360]  funding and we make it easy to fund with great products and power you and your immune system
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:31.600]  and your family as well. You can also make straight donations at Infowarsscore.com,

[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:39.840]  We're nonviolent but every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:44.480]  us on air. You are literally non-violently politically punching the New World Order in the
[02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:49.680]  nose, punching their lies in the nose. We are going to defeat the New World Order. We're going
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:54.880]  over the top but right now is the critical juncture so please go to infowarsscore.com and donate now.
[02:19:54.880 --> 02:20:05.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:17.200]  All right let me make one more point before I go back to your phone calls here on this Thursday
[02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:23.840]  live broadcast. I'm here showing you mainline articles that the chemicals in the water are
[02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:28.720]  feminizing boys and hyperfeminizing girls and accelerating their aging and causing all these
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:33.760]  health problems and cancer. But you don't need to even look at that. You have a giant push globally
[02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:39.040]  by big corporations to put little children on hormone blockers, boys and girls, and cut their
[02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:45.120]  genitals off and cut their breasts off. So that's just them going to the logical conclusion
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:52.880]  of that depopulation plan. Unbelievably insane. And then DeSantis reveals the shocking porn books
[02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:58.960]  being removed from Florida schools which the media said oh he's anti-gay. No this is what
[02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:05.040]  he's banning. If two men want to go have sex together that's their business. We're not talking about it.
[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:14.080]  Targeting children with homosexual or heterosexual BS is called pedophilia and it's wrong
[02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:20.880]  and we will reject it and we are rejecting it. Look at this headline. I see this headline every
[02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:26.880]  day from some other publication. It's a talking point. How drag queens became a right-wing target
[02:21:26.880 --> 02:21:31.840]  from Alex Jones to Tucker Carlson with the states trying to ban story hours and shows.
[02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:40.160]  No, I personally as a little kid laughed at Bob Hope on TV dressed like a woman running around
[02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:46.560]  acting silly. And there's lots of movies of drag queens and it's funny and it's ridiculous. You know
[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:51.680]  we've all seen police academy where the cops dress up like hookers and to go bust hookers
[02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:57.680]  and they've got beards and it's a joke. No one's attacking men dressing up like women.
[02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:07.120]  Hell Stephen Crowder does that. It's hilarious. We're attacking people that are attacking children
[02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:12.400]  and saying we're grooming you and we want little kids to sit on our laps and teach them about sex.
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:17.680]  We want you to not target children. It's not how drag queens have become a right-wing target.
[02:22:17.680 --> 02:22:24.160]  It's how sexualizing children and pedophilia behavior has become a right-wing target.
[02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:31.840]  Let's go to Florida and Tim wants to talk about the elephant in the room. Joe Rogan,
[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:35.920]  Elon Musk, all of them coming out against world government to the world government's face.
[02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:37.920]  What do you make of that? Tim, thanks for calling.
[02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:46.000]  Hi, Alex. I spoke with you a few weeks back about region building. The globalists plan to
[02:22:46.880 --> 02:22:53.840]  have incremental steps with regional blocks around the world as a incremental step toward
[02:22:53.840 --> 02:23:02.320]  globalism. And so the comments by Elon Musk, I have to say they are not inconsistent with
[02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:09.520]  what globalists have said the back for decades. You can quote, I got Swab Brzezinski, Kissinger,
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:16.240]  Richard Gardner, and Lincoln Bloomfield. All of them talked about region building as the incremental
[02:23:16.240 --> 02:23:20.000]  step toward globalism. No, you're right. I'm not defending Musk, but he specifically says nation
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:25.840]  states. Well, I know, but that's the point. They try to make a play between nationalism and globalism.
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:30.800]  Sure. You're saying that he's creating a false origin window where you still have globalism.
[02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:39.600]  Or regionalism. And that's exactly what Klaus Schwab said in his book on the great reset.
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:46.800]  He said that regionalism would be an in-between position, a compromise between nationalism
[02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:51.600]  and globalism. And that's just like the North American Union that the Mexican president called
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:58.080]  for last month. Absolutely. The African Union, South American Union, Eurasian Union. I have an
[02:23:58.080 --> 02:24:04.720]  article on this Klaus Schwab thing on my website. I hope sometime you can go and look at my website,
[02:24:04.720 --> 02:24:14.000]  Alex. I've had it since 2011. It's circumspectnews.com. And it's all played out. And I'll say that
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:22.720]  again, circumspect? Circumspectnews.com. All right, let's check it out. So what do you make of
[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:26.480]  Musk? And now suddenly, oh, there's a world government we should oppose it. What do you make
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:30.800]  of them going from it doesn't exist, the globalist saying it does exist, and now the so-called
[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:38.400]  opposition? Well, they do oppose. They talk about a single, must talk about a single world government.
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:43.200]  Well, they're not going there. They're not going there first. In fact, sure, it's regions they
[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:47.440]  still control, though. We can't get a hell of ourselves, Alex. You know, I know you believe
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:54.080]  the Bible. The Bible narrative, when it opens on the B system, it opens with 10 kings. Yes. It
[02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:58.720]  doesn't open with a single world government. No, 10 kings and three major regions. It doesn't even
[02:24:58.720 --> 02:25:04.160]  talk about trilateral regions. It talks about 10 kings, not three kings. Now, I know the globalists
[02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:09.200]  want to get to three, the trilateral, but they ain't going to get there for a long time. Well,
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:13.440]  to talk about the Bible, you're right. It's the 10 kings. The 10 kings. You have the little horn.
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:22.080]  Right. And but you know, the 1984 scenario where the three trilateral governments, Oceania,
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:29.600]  Eurasia, East Asia, their constant perpetual war against each other is what the globalists are
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:35.600]  going to use. But instead of doing it among three, they're going to do it among 10. And that's what
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:42.560]  Kissinger called the new mercantilism, a constant war, conflict, competition among the 10s. That's
[02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:50.400]  the multipolar world that they're talking about. And I hope you go and get an overview of this.
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:54.640]  No, I know they're pushing a multipolar world.
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:59.280]  Right. Alex Newman of the New American magazine. He's got a grasp of this.
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:02.960]  Sometime if you could get him on, he'd be really good to interview on this.
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:06.720]  All right, brother. Appreciate your call. Let's talk to Douglas in Ohio. Go ahead, Douglas.
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:12.480]  Yeah, Alex. First of all, I want to thank you and the crew for all that you do,
[02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:21.360]  and God bless all of you guys. I'd like to talk about a couple things. First, I'd like to say
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:27.040]  that I called in years ago. Are you there? Absolutely. You guys call in and then you
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:31.200]  like talking, you say, am I here? You are on the air, Douglas. I promise you.
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:37.040]  Thank you, sir. I called in quite a few years ago and offered a solution well before it even
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:42.560]  happened. And you guys created an excerpt. It was on YouTube. They took it down and it was called
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:48.400]  Truckers Could Stop, Runaway, Taranee. And I just want to reiterate that we need to,
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:54.960]  instead of buying side phones, we need to buy CDs. We need to get out and reach to the truckers
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:27:02.000]  and spread your word, Alex. Truckers are the most powerful industry in America. And without them,
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:08.480]  we will get nowhere. And second of all, I'd like to say, put a promotion in for your products.
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:14.320]  We use all your products. I've been listening to you for 20 years, Alex. And I want to thank you.
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:19.120]  I mean, you bring tears to my eyes for all that you've done for me and my family.
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:22.240]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I want to thank you, brother, but you're right.
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:28.080]  What is it like? 90% of freight gets delivered by truck. And the truckers are the most powerful
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:33.040]  force. You've seen in Australia, Europe, Canada, the truckers really exercise their power.
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:39.200]  Why aren't American truckers doing that yet? That's what I'd like to know. And I have some
[02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:44.560]  suggestions. And one would be everybody get a CD and start talking to the truckers. Another thing
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:51.840]  is maybe we need some type of crowd sourcing to create like a video truck like Project Veritas
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:59.200]  did at Pfizer and go around to these truck stops and just sit there and play excerpts of you and
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:05.760]  all this stuff going on to get the message out even clearer because we need them in this fight
[02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:11.120]  without them. I don't think we're going to go anywhere. I totally agree. We've got a super
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:16.960]  charge of the truckers. Anything else, Douglas? Yeah, I'd like to, you know, be as you guys
[02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:22.640]  talk about the Illuminati. What about getting Fritz Springmeyer back on? You know, I haven't had
[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:26.880]  Fritz on in like 15 years. I've tried to get him on like a decade ago. I don't even know.
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:30.880]  I will try to get Fritz Springmeyer on. I appreciate your call. All right. In the
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:37.120]  order received, Michael in Texas and others, we're going to go to your calls when we come back
[02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:44.320]  on the other side than market New York and so many others. Stay with us info wars.com

[02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:28.480]  enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein. This is very important. The
[02:30:28.480 --> 02:30:33.440]  spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:37.680]  People are lower with the spike protein. They don't feel well. This is a potential solution.
[02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:42.720]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance. So does ivermectin and now
[02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:48.320]  natokinase. Isn't it interesting? Natural substances in a sense combating this man made

[02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:32.400]  and all the distractions and all the rabbit trails. We're talking about New World Order,
[02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:39.360]  Mark of the Beast, Horst Injections, the attack on our children. The information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:49.280]  What we are looking at is good and evil. Right and wrong. New World Order.
[02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:03.360]  My work is almost done here, my friends. We're not about to make that same thing.
[02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:10.080]  Here to make sure you're warned, you can make your decision about what side you're on. You
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:15.040]  still have important work to do, but we have completed the first mission we were given
[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:18.960]  and now the public has a choice to make.
[02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:24.720]  A New World Order.
[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:34.880]  All right, let's rampage through your calls. Michael in the great state of Texas, you're on
[02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:40.800]  the air. Go ahead. I love you, brother. What's on your mind?
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:48.560]  Hey, I just wanted to mention old Bill Cooper from way back in the day, from back in the 90s,
[02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:55.760]  just from where I first heard about you and thanks to both of you guys and his books, Behold
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:01.120]  the Pell Horse and Talk About UFOs, Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars and Mystery Schools.
[02:35:01.680 --> 02:35:07.280]  I learned a lot from you guys. Yeah, Bill Cooper was an amazing person.
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:13.200]  Yeah, he was. Yeah, sorry what happened to him, but we got to keep moving forward.
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:19.840]  And I'm so grateful that I've been listening to you for all these years. You lit a fire under
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:24.880]  my butt. I did better for myself, moved out to the country just outside of Austin,
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:32.560]  started my own business and knowing that I'm not a socialist, hate socialism, hate growing up on
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:36.720]  food stamps and made it for myself. Beautiful.
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:44.560]  Doing really good. And, you know, your products have helped me so much. My wife is, you know,
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:52.240]  the knockout and rocket rest. Her favorite go-to every night. She just came down with
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:36:01.040]  breast cancer and she tried your CBD oil because, you know, as Mike says, it's the full spectrum.
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:05.680]  So we're going to try that. I know it grows breast cancer is a glybesate that's in the
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:08.640]  water supply and the food. I'm so sorry to hear that, brother.
[02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:14.720]  Yeah, I mean, but, you know, we just got to keep going forward with it, you know, the,
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:22.480]  you know, doing the protocol and stuff. I just want to reach the thing and for words out there,
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:29.280]  you know, get with it, you know, get ready, be prepared. I did send you a little something
[02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:34.720]  via the mail. It's in a big old Home Depot box, a product that hopefully you can look at.
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:37.760]  And if you're interested, you know, we could partner together.
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:40.640]  I will, brother. I'll look it up. Thank you so much, Michael.
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:43.120]  We're moving quick here. Mark in New York here on the air.
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:45.280]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:45.760]  Good, brother.
[02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:51.920]  God bless for my brother. I've been watching you from the beginning and you are fabulous.
[02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:52.400]  You're fabulous.
[02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:59.840]  Thank you, brother. Thank you. You know, I think with this WHO, this World Health Organization,
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:05.040]  you know, they're putting a stunt. Now, what I just read to pull them out of Redacted,
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:10.720]  they're trying to bring out some new Marbug and a vaccine to go with it.
[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:14.560]  That's right. That's the next segment. Incredible information.
[02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:16.480]  They are really getting their new weapon ready.
[02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:20.240]  Yeah, exactly. And Redacted is trying to push on that.
[02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:23.200]  You want to get the information, try to look it up or whatever, you know,
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:28.160]  you have to do to get it so we can push that out there and make people aware of what's coming
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:32.880]  next. If that's going to be the one that's coming next besides anything else with this nuclear war,
[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:37.920]  that's another thing. I feel that the WHO is pushing it and everybody else is pushing it.
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:43.040]  Like it's, you know, it's going to be the end of the world. I really believe that they're trying to,
[02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:48.800]  you know, have a submit, you know, to anything that they push because, you know, I don't really
[02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:54.000]  feel they want to destroy the planet or the plane. I call it a plane because I don't believe it took
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:59.520]  a long, you know, that, you know, we can have, that they can have most of it for themselves.
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:05.520]  Well, I know this, they're trying to make us give up, but giving into them only makes it worse.
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:10.800]  Submitting to tyranny only enslaves you worse. Yes, we're not doing that, Alex. As long as we're
[02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:16.080]  around and you're here, regardless of the matter, we are not doing that. Beautiful,
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:24.720]  brother. I appreciate your call. Black rant from South Carolina. You're on the air. Hello, Alex
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:31.200]  June. Thank you very much for letting me call in. I love your show and I've been listening, I guess,
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:39.040]  for about 20 years now, driving my wife crazy with it. But I have to say that before I found you,
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:45.520]  and this was a subject from an earlier caller, fatherlessness, my father had a book in our house,
[02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:51.200]  well, tons of books, but he had a book in our house from David Ike. And that was in like 1997,
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:55.600]  98, and he called out 9-11. And he called out all these other things and talked about the
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:02.800]  interdimensional entities and whatnot. And I wanted to call in about Project Bluebeam
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:08.960]  and how this is the globalist last chance, the elitist last final card that they're playing.
[02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:15.120]  There's videos all over the internet talking about these UFOs being shot down and creating
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:21.840]  sensationalism around it. And our society is so misdirected that that is the thing that's going
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:26.160]  to encapsulate everything that they want. The globalists are going to get their pedophilia,
[02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:29.520]  they're going to get their global government, they're going to get their lockdowns,
[02:39:29.520 --> 02:39:35.280]  they're going to get people moving into cities and state zones and regions all due to that emergency.
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:43.120]  And COVID was the first test of locking down and having a global emergency. Could you imagine
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:47.360]  when they actually start this Bluebeam project, and Greg Reese did an amazing video on it,
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:52.880]  but could you imagine when they actually do this? People were stunned. I still see people walking
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:57.440]  around with masks on to this day. Could you imagine if people thought that there was an alien
[02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:02.480]  invasion happening? So I don't think it's going to happen this year. It's going to happen probably
[02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:05.760]  four or five years in the future. They're definitely prepping it.
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:14.000]  Yes, they're definitely prepping it. And 70 years will be the anniversary of when Eisenhower,
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:20.560]  next year, February 20th, will be 70 years since when Eisenhower allegedly met with these aliens
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:24.720]  and formed this treaty. I don't know anything about that. I'm not saying that's real or true,
[02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:31.120]  but that would be something to see if next year we started seeing an uptake in this phenomenon.
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:36.160]  We will definitely track it, sir. Thanks for the call. Patty and Boston, go ahead.
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:42.000]  Alex, I found it very irritating that you were talking about people who live in cities
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:48.160]  earlier in a denigrating fashion. I think that the fact of the matter is you're a rich kid from
[02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:53.200]  the Dallas suburbs, and you're talking about work. You wouldn't know work if it actually,
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:59.440]  you know, slapped its balls against your chin. Like, I just think that you're not,
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:03.520]  you're not a guy who understands work, man. You're a rich kid. So whatever.
[02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:08.240]  Oh, hold on. Let me respond to what you said. I wouldn't say a rich kid. My dad was a dentist,
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:12.880]  and I grew up in a four-bedroom house in Dallas, but we were definitely middle class.
[02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:18.880]  And I've had a lot of jobs. I've worked on ranches. I've worked on farms. I've worked for
[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:24.160]  large animal vets, small animal vets. I started my show 28 years ago. It's been very successful.
[02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:29.600]  I work seven days a week, and I do know how to skin a buck, run a trot line, run electricity,
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:36.160]  do basic stuff on cars, know how to change the tire, know how to, you know, cook an incredible
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:41.120]  dinner. So the idea that you call it and say, I'm incompetent, I'm not accomplished, you're
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:47.520]  right, Patty. I'm totally unaccomplished. I'm a nobody. You're incredible. And when I say people
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:52.800]  should try to get to the country, I'm wrong. I've said my grandfathers do way more than I did,
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:59.280]  and I've lost a lot of knowledge. So I didn't sit up here and say that I was Paul Bunyan or that,
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:05.040]  you know, I was, I mean, I don't know who I could say, like, you know, the greatest frontiersman
[02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:09.520]  ever, you know, somebody that got killed in the Alamo or something. I'm just related to those
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:14.720]  people. So you're right. I'm the scum of the earth. I can't find my ass with both hands.
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:21.200]  You are superior. What else do you want to add? No, I think almost anybody could find your ass
[02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:26.960]  with both hands because it's about 350 pounds. Okay. So again, you're powerful. I'm bad. So we
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:32.080]  should stay in the cities in high rise buildings and not know how to, we shouldn't grow gardens.
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:37.120]  We shouldn't try to, is that what you're saying? No, I think you should just lay off the burger.
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:42.800]  I actually don't drink a lot of bourbon. But I mean, I mean, continue. No, no, no, no,
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:46.560]  you call in to say people live in the cities. So I'm going to hold you over Patty.
[02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:53.440]  Are you transgender, Patty? We'll be right back. Stay with us. What a joke. Can't wait to talk to
[02:42:53.440 --> 02:43:01.440]  this clown. This is entertainment, folks. Stay with us. I talk a lot about the great successes
[02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:07.280]  Info Wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it. And it is because of listeners and viewers
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:12.160]  supporting us. When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:18.880]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight. And when you look at Harrison Smith
[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:23.600]  and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week,
[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:28.720]  it's really just incredible. So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:34.640]  past support. I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars can not stay on air if you do not
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:38.880]  support us. I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us. And that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:44.320]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTour.com and you never buy great products
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:48.640]  that enrich and empower your life. All at the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than
[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:53.840]  1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com. If just 1% more of you took
[02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:58.160]  action at InfoWarsTour.com, our fighting problems will be over. Please take action now.
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:03.360]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an
[02:44:03.360 --> 02:44:08.880]  information war. And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:13.440]  to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stand the field in this war against the New World Order
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:18.880]  by visiting InfoWarsTour.com right now and taking action. I thank you for your past support and I
[02:44:18.880 --> 02:44:24.400]  ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment to keep Info Wars on the air
[02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:28.160]  will ensure our victory against the New World Order. They're coming for you and your family.
[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:31.760]  They're coming for me. They're coming for the children. But to get to the children,
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:35.600]  they've got to get through us first. These monsters are all over television wanting to give these
[02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:40.000]  shots to newborn babies. They're already given to the pregnant women. Miscarriages are off the chart.
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:45.680]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots.
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:51.040]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us. Let's do it together. And the
[02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:56.880]  fight starts at InfoWars.com and the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:45:04.160]  Now take action now. In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove
[02:45:04.160 --> 02:45:10.720]  showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:20.160]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using
[02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:26.960]  biological weapons against all of mankind. And by the time they launched their attack in 2020,
[02:45:26.960 --> 02:45:33.920]  Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines
[02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:40.160]  that we knew were coming. This is why they attack us. This is why we need your support.
[02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:46.880]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right. Join the resistance. Buy products.
[02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:53.680]  Donate to the cause. Share the links. Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat

[02:46:51.040 --> 02:47:09.360]  This is our new InfoWars MD, incredible line. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:13.520 --> 02:47:17.920]  All right, I got some big news on the cancer shots I need to hit before our guest host
[02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:23.360]  takes over. Then Owen Schreuer is coming up in about an hour and 15 minutes with the war
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:27.840]  on 3PM Central. And I don't know who Patrick is called himself Patty from Boston, but the crew
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:33.440]  says they know him that he's a Owen Schreuer stalker that has come to our events and stuff.
[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:36.800]  So he called in about people live in the city. I mean, we're not type people live in the city.
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:41.360]  I'm just saying the cities are control grids, 15 minute cities, the New World Order, all that.
[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:47.760]  Are you mad that Owen Schreuer doesn't like you? Because I mean, I'm really hurt right now that
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:52.800]  you called in and said I'm weak and pathetic and powerless. I'm going to cry in my pillow tonight,
[02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:56.480]  Patrick. But Patrick, why are you really mad at us, Patrick?
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:48:01.200]  Well, when you're done biting your pillow, you can you can cry into it.
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:06.160]  That's enough. I don't have time for like hooligans. I appreciate your call. Look at that guy.
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:10.960]  I mean, I'm sorry, mommy didn't take care of you and didn't give you the milk you needed.
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:14.880]  All right, let's go to Joseph in Utah. Joseph, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:20.880]  Yes, Alex. I'm Joseph from Utah. That guy has nothing on you, Alex. Don't even let him get near
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:27.360]  you. It's funny. Actually, it's just pathetic. I know, I agree. But he's stupid, Alex. Listen,
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:33.360]  listen, I mean, um, um, Aaron Burr, I've been out a while, so I got nervous now.
[02:48:33.360 --> 02:48:39.520]  Aaron Burr, the town where that train derailed. Okay. Aaron Burr also was the vice president
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:46.160]  of the United States in the 1800s, and he had a duel with Alexander Hamilton, who was the secretary
[02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:52.720]  of treasury in Weehawken. Okay. And then, uh, then he died. Alexander Hamilton died about,
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:58.240]  uh, um, two days later, give or take. Okay. And I just wanted to throw that out there.
[02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:03.920]  I have a fear because, you know, our dollars going down to two and the town that we have this,
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:11.360]  this next derailment is in, um, is in, uh, then Van Buren, okay, township. And I just wanted to
[02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:15.440]  throw it out there. And another item, do you understand what I just said about that?
[02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:17.600]  Yeah. Say it's like an archetypal calling card.
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:21.680]  That would you call it an archetypal calling card?
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:27.760]  Yes. Okay. Now let me ask one other question, please. Okay. And that is very quick. That is,
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:35.760]  um, uh, Art Bell, did you, did you have any, um, uh, did he influence you in any way,
[02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:39.600]  or either radio wise or in any way, or did you have to listen to him, please?
[02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:44.400]  I did listen to Art Bell quite a bit. I wasn't a big UFO guy. I thought he was a masterful
[02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:47.840]  talk show host and just amazing to listen to him. I listen to Art Bell a lot.
[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:52.880]  Yeah. Cause you're a format, you're a format with the, uh, what do you call again? Your format
[02:49:52.880 --> 02:49:57.520]  would just leave it at that. You have several formats and he had several formats. And, um, and, uh,
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:01.760]  I just, you kind of overlap. Cause he, yeah, I wouldn't call him a major influence on the show,
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:06.640]  but I mean, uh, uh, uh, a very smooth broadcaster who I, who I respect.
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:12.320]  Yeah. And he was good. And one, one thing later, Alex, I'd like to tell you something when, uh,
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:18.720]  one day later, it's about, uh, Benjamin Franklin and Martha and the Revolutionary War. If you
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:24.960]  Google that, you will find something amazing. The Knights of Martha and 1800 Maltese volunteers
[02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:32.640]  for the French Navy and Chesapeake Bay, um, during, during the Revolutionary War, and they, uh,
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:37.440]  helped stop the British and that helped, uh, absolutely. Thank you so much, Joseph.
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:43.520]  Dan O from Hawaii 50. Book them, Dan O calling from California. Go ahead.
[02:50:43.520 --> 02:50:48.800]  Hey Alex. Thank you for taking my call. Hey, I just wanted to touch based on, uh, some very
[02:50:48.800 --> 02:50:54.160]  important things like all the tests and the, uh, the balloons and, uh, all this distractions in
[02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:58.960]  Russia. I believe it's just, it's just, it's making too much sense. I mean, just all these
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:03.040]  distractions, all at once, everything is pumping every day. Now look at this. Russia's about to
[02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:08.640]  declare war any day on Ukraine right now is what the word I hear. They got 97% of the front line
[02:51:08.640 --> 02:51:13.200]  up there. They got nuclear war weapons attached to the things out in a Baltic sea. They're ready.
[02:51:13.200 --> 02:51:18.320]  So they're about to unleash on Ukraine. That's a perfect distraction because when they do that,
[02:51:18.880 --> 02:51:22.080]  we're, we are going to concentrate nothing about on there because we're depleting our
[02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:26.240]  military, starting everything Ukraine, Ukraine, along with all these other countries. And when
[02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:30.880]  that happens, Alex, this is the perfect time for China to take Taiwan. Well, you know that
[02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:35.360]  because no, everybody's going to be distracted. And while they do that, they're Japan and they're
[02:51:35.360 --> 02:51:39.920]  going to have to defend and help us help try to sit there and stop them from taking Taiwan.
[02:51:39.920 --> 02:51:43.680]  And that's going to sit there and take what little military we have left supporting our
[02:51:43.680 --> 02:51:46.960]  borders right now, because we're still embarrassed with the balloon fighting that
[02:51:46.960 --> 02:51:51.040]  been in our country for the past week. And we didn't realize that they were there for four days.
[02:51:51.040 --> 02:51:55.120]  Now those planes are going to leave little planes. We have now going to leave to go help them
[02:51:55.120 --> 02:51:58.720]  and totally agree. We're being set up for an absolute fault. You know,
[02:51:59.360 --> 02:52:03.360]  it's over. And Mr. Kim in North Korea going to say, yeah, go ahead, try something because
[02:52:03.360 --> 02:52:06.720]  I got China's back and I'm going to blow you off the mat. You try to touch China.
[02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:10.960]  We are in trouble, Alex. People need to wake up and people need to stick together.
[02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:12.880]  We need to get the word out and people need to get it.
[02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:17.680]  No, I appreciate you and I agree with you. Chris and Illinois, go ahead.
[02:52:19.520 --> 02:52:23.440]  Hello, I thought I was going. My name is Chris. Just calling in to tell you a little story.
[02:52:24.800 --> 02:52:32.080]  It's quite interesting about it was 2021. And we were in South Dakota, Sioux Falls.
[02:52:32.080 --> 02:52:38.080]  And I went to, it was like their little park over there. It's kind of like a tourist attraction
[02:52:38.080 --> 02:52:44.480]  called the Falls. And we were just walking around. It blew clear day, you know, and I look up at the
[02:52:44.480 --> 02:52:50.640]  sky. And there's this F-16 that came out of the airport right next to where we were at.
[02:52:51.280 --> 02:52:57.280]  And it flew like almost straight up. And we look up and we're like, what is it? What is it going
[02:52:57.280 --> 02:53:04.160]  after? Where is it going? And it ended up like, we'd lost track of that, but we saw this, this
[02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:09.760]  like exactly what the spy balloons look like. It looked exactly like that, sitting up there in
[02:53:09.760 --> 02:53:15.760]  the sky, not moving. We just kept an eye on it for like an hour and it stayed there. And we
[02:53:16.400 --> 02:53:22.000]  lost track of it, forgot about it. Next day, we wake up in a hotel room. We look out and it's
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:26.080]  still in the sky the next day. And it was just really weird. We didn't think much of it at the
[02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:31.520]  time. But now that we've seen all this stuff happen with, you know, the balloons and whatnot,
[02:53:31.520 --> 02:53:35.280]  it's kind of just odd. And you look at it and you're like, wow, that actually was happening.
[02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:38.720]  Well, sir, people just see the balloons they get upset about. There's satellites everywhere,
[02:53:38.720 --> 02:53:42.880]  scanning what we're doing. So it's very healthy that people are starting to actually look at this
[02:53:42.880 --> 02:53:46.640]  and be concerned about it. I appreciate your call. Matt in New York, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:53:47.920 --> 02:53:52.480]  Yo, what's up, everybody? Instead of running around like chicken little with a head cut off,
[02:53:52.480 --> 02:53:57.680]  why don't we make a plan? This country got hijacked by evil cooperation. So why don't the
[02:53:57.680 --> 02:54:03.440]  people incorporate? We'll all get our membership cards, right? We don't incorporate. We'll start
[02:54:03.440 --> 02:54:09.520]  small. We'll go after January 6 free in those people. We'll concentrate everything on that.
[02:54:09.520 --> 02:54:15.600]  And also, exposing the COVID lie and prosecuting all the people and holding them accountable.
[02:54:15.600 --> 02:54:20.160]  That'll be the first thing. And eventually, by incorporating, we'll create our own currency.
[02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:25.280]  We'll, you know, eventually divert all our tax money directly to an open
[02:54:25.280 --> 02:54:31.200]  transparent fund, eliminate all the corruption and make these people obsolete. But let's start
[02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:35.440]  this instead of running around and going, I told you so, while we're all getting killed.
[02:54:35.440 --> 02:54:39.520]  Because this is out of control. The good news is we have to first identify there's a corporate
[02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:44.320]  world government that's out to get us. We're doing that and then expose and fight their policies,
[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:48.880]  cutting off pipelines, cutting off old production, brainwashing our children. We're
[02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:52.800]  identifying who's doing it. We're identifying their policies. We're educating the public to
[02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:57.760]  oppose the policies. We already identified them, Mr. Jones. They're already identified.
[02:54:57.760 --> 02:55:02.400]  You're awake, Matt. A lot of other folks aren't awake yet. They're ready for it, though.
[02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:08.160]  The tree has been watered with my blood, with everyone's blood that worked at 9-11. It has
[02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:13.200]  enough blood of Patriots. It's time we get some blood attire on there. All right. Why don't we
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:18.240]  start a cooperation live on this show for the American people, open transparent funds,
[02:55:18.240 --> 02:55:24.000]  50% goes to the operational aspect, 50% goes to the people, and we start going. Because
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:28.960]  presidency and all this stuff means jack what? Hey, man, I'm just trying to hit this show on
[02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:32.800]  the air, but I hear what you're saying. It's easy to imagine stuff. It's harder to do it,
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:36.320]  but we're trying right now. Adrian in Arizona, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:44.400]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for having me on. I have a question in regards to the spike protein.
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:53.360]  Have you done any research as far as it leading to what's called like an endothelial disease?
[02:55:53.920 --> 02:56:00.480]  Essentially, it's going to make us all old. Yeah, no, it cuts off our DNA. It breaks the DNA
[02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:06.160]  chain and accelerates aging. It does so much. It causes cancer, blood clots. I mean, it's a total
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:11.360]  weapon. Yes, Alex. The only thing is that there's a few scientists out there and doctors that believe
[02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:16.640]  that regardless if you've been vaccinated or unvaccinated, so long that you've been exposed,
[02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:23.840]  that you've had COVID, you will end up with this. No, I agree. It's a bio weapon for depopulation
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:30.160]  and sterilization. So even the people that have been unvaccinated, how do we protect
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:34.480]  ourselves? Is there a way? That's the big question. I've had a lot of doctors on,
[02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:40.560]  drink a lot of water, get sunshine, eat healthy food, take ivermectin in cycles so it can cause
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:48.080]  liver problems, and you can flush this crap out. You can mitigate it. What about things like NAC
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:54.320]  and... No, I had McCullough on, and I've had McCullough on. They said the same thing. NAC.
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:57:01.200]  I took NAC this morning. What would be the purpose of the vaccine if just this, just COVID,
[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:06.960]  did the same thing? Why, why the push? Because if you look at the numbers, the shot is dozens of
[02:57:06.960 --> 02:57:11.680]  times worse than the actual disease, because your body is so powerful, it learns how to defeat it,
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:16.480]  and so they trick people to then take the shot, which then causes mutations,
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:20.400]  and then they become incubators for it. I appreciate your call. All right, I can't get to the other
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:26.480]  callers. I tried to get to everybody. We got to like 30 calls today. We did a pretty good job,
[02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:30.320]  but in the next segment, I want to hit the vaccine news, so-called vaccine news,
[02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:35.360]  and then hand the baton to our guest hosts that are taking over, and then in one hour from now,
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:40.480]  Owen Schroyer, 3 p.m., Central Tech's over. I really appreciate all of your support.
[02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:44.800]  We'll go to break and come back with the rest of the story.

[02:59:47.520 --> 03:00:07.120]  All right, final segment before our guest hosts take over. Let's go over these headlines right
[03:00:07.120 --> 03:00:13.840]  now. WHO convenes urgent meaning over outbreak of deadly Marburg virus, which they've been hyping
[03:00:13.840 --> 03:00:20.560]  forever will kill everybody. WHO convenes urgent meaning over outbreak of Marburg virus,
[03:00:20.560 --> 03:00:27.520]  one of the world's deadliest viruses that kills 90% of patients and has no cure. So they're going
[03:00:27.520 --> 03:00:36.080]  to hold us hostage, and if you submit you'll be a slave or die. Cancer causing viruses use a human
[03:00:36.080 --> 03:00:41.840]  protein, some of the spike protein, to evade the innate immune response, and what have we

[03:06:10.240 --> 03:06:14.400]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. You are live with counter spin meteors. We are geoengineer.
[03:06:14.400 --> 03:06:19.680]  This is the fourth hour on Calvin Elf. And I'm Hannah Spira. Sit tight because this is a packed
[03:06:19.680 --> 03:06:25.840]  hour. We are going to start this segment with a few videos. We also are going to bring on our
[03:06:25.840 --> 03:06:33.280]  guest in the next segment, Diana Jojanovic. She is the senator from Romania that has been calling
[03:06:33.280 --> 03:06:39.840]  out the deep state in regards to the earthquake over in Turkey. So let's set this up. We're talking
[03:06:39.840 --> 03:06:44.960]  about geoengineering, harp weather modification, trying to give you a big picture, put it into
[03:06:44.960 --> 03:06:50.000]  perspective. You'll see that players like Bill Gates of course are involved. So let's play that
[03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:54.640]  first video, the geoengineering and weather modification. What do you do if you live in
[03:06:54.640 --> 03:06:59.840]  the middle of the desert and need water? You make it rain. Scientists in Dubai can now literally
[03:06:59.840 --> 03:07:04.640]  modify their weather. This technology could change the world as we know it, but will controlling
[03:07:04.640 --> 03:07:10.080]  the weather be used for good or for evil? In July of 2021, the United Arab Emirates
[03:07:10.080 --> 03:07:14.880]  National Center of Meteorology released a video showing a rainstorm that had been created using
[03:07:14.880 --> 03:07:20.400]  weather modifying technology. How did they make it rain in the desert? You might ask. Scientists in
[03:07:20.400 --> 03:07:25.520]  Dubai used high powered lasers and other advanced technology that were mounted to drones to make
[03:07:25.520 --> 03:07:30.960]  the rain fall. In Santa Barbara County, home to one of the longest running cloud seeding operations
[03:07:30.960 --> 03:07:35.840]  in the country. We've got some ground based cloud seeding equipment right here and we're going to
[03:07:35.840 --> 03:07:41.360]  get to hear all about how it works and see it in action. Another example is the array of technologies,
[03:07:41.360 --> 03:07:46.480]  often referred to collectively as geoengineering, that potentially could help reverse the warming
[03:07:46.480 --> 03:07:52.080]  effects of global climate change. One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric
[03:07:52.080 --> 03:07:58.240]  aerosol injection or SAI, a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help
[03:07:58.240 --> 03:08:05.200]  reflect the sun's heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do. An SAI program could limit
[03:08:05.200 --> 03:08:10.320]  global temperature increases, reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing
[03:08:10.320 --> 03:08:16.320]  the world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels. Meanwhile Bill Gates is backing
[03:08:16.320 --> 03:08:22.000]  the first high altitude experiment of one radical climate change solution, creating a massive chemical
[03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:26.880]  cloud that could cool the earth. It's called solar geoengineering and it's highly controversial.
[03:08:29.280 --> 03:08:34.880]  How long will it be that countries keep experiencing these climate impacts before someone
[03:08:34.880 --> 03:08:40.720]  gets desperate and says hey we need to cool the planet with solar geoengineering? It would look
[03:08:40.720 --> 03:08:45.680]  something like this. Thousands of planes would fly very high and use nozzles to inject millions of
[03:08:45.680 --> 03:08:49.840]  tons of light reflecting particles into the stratosphere. It would create a thin chemical
[03:08:49.840 --> 03:08:54.640]  cloud of those particles around the whole planet blocking some sunlight from reaching the surface.
[03:08:54.640 --> 03:09:00.640]  It would mimic a giant volcanic eruption which we know cools the earth. Bill Gates is among a
[03:09:00.640 --> 03:09:05.680]  dozen individual donors and 14 foundations backing the first stratospheric solar geoengineering
[03:09:05.680 --> 03:09:10.880]  experiment out of Harvard. It's called stratospheric controlled perturbation experiment or scopex.
[03:09:11.600 --> 03:09:16.080]  A high altitude balloon will lift instruments about 20 kilometers into the stratosphere
[03:09:16.080 --> 03:09:20.480]  where it will release less than two kilograms of different naturally occurring chemicals
[03:09:20.480 --> 03:09:25.680]  like calcium carbonate and sulfates. Wait, what? That balloon looks familiar.
[03:09:25.680 --> 03:09:33.120]  Aha, so that's why there's so many balloons. William Cohen, Secretary of Defense under Bill
[03:09:33.120 --> 03:09:39.440]  Clinton, said this in 1997. Others are engaging even in an eco type of terrorism whereby they can
[03:09:39.440 --> 03:09:44.720]  alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes, remotely, through the use of electromagnetic
[03:09:44.720 --> 03:09:52.080]  waves. In 1883, I did radio tomography with 30 watts looking for oil in the ground. I found 26
[03:09:52.080 --> 03:09:58.960]  oil wells over a nine state area and 100 percent of the time was accurate with just 30 watts of
[03:09:58.960 --> 03:10:07.440]  power beaming straight into solid rock. Harp uses a billion watts, being straight into the
[03:10:07.440 --> 03:10:15.040]  ionosphere for experiments. Picture these strings on the piano as layers of the earth. Each one has
[03:10:15.040 --> 03:10:21.360]  its own frequency. What we used to do is beam radiant waves into the ground and it would
[03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:27.760]  vibrate any strings that were present in the ground. We might get a sound back like, and we'd say
[03:10:28.480 --> 03:10:36.960]  that's natural gas. We might get a sound back like, and we say that's crude oil. We were able
[03:10:36.960 --> 03:10:44.320]  to identify each frequency. We accomplished this with just 30 watts of radio power. If you do this
[03:10:44.320 --> 03:10:51.680]  with a billion watts, the vibrations are so violent that the entire piano would shake. In fact,
[03:10:51.680 --> 03:10:57.520]  the whole house would shake. In fact, the vibrations could be so severe underground that could even
[03:10:57.520 --> 03:11:11.920]  cause an earthquake. So we know the science is there. It is not a conspiracy. Harp and geoengineering
[03:11:11.920 --> 03:11:16.880]  are technologies that are being rolled out around the country. Now, we want to set this up as well
[03:11:16.880 --> 03:11:22.080]  in terms of the Turkey geopolitical situation. We've also got this next clip just so you get
[03:11:22.080 --> 03:11:27.040]  a bit of a background. It is the Balm Report and we just want to share this with you before we bring
[03:11:27.040 --> 03:11:31.200]  the senator on in the next segment. So let's roll that clip so you've got the context.
[03:11:31.200 --> 03:11:38.720]  At the end of January 2023, talks between Turkish President Erdogan and the Swedish government
[03:11:38.720 --> 03:11:45.200]  detonated. So you will let terror organizations run wild on your avenues and streets and then
[03:11:45.200 --> 03:11:53.920]  expect our support for getting into NATO? That's not happening. In order to be accepted into NATO,
[03:11:53.920 --> 03:12:01.600]  Sweden and Finland as well needed the vote from Turkey. But talks disintegrated after a Swedish
[03:12:01.600 --> 03:12:07.520]  Danish politician set fire to the Koran in front of the Turkish embassy in Stockholm.
[03:12:07.520 --> 03:12:14.560]  On Saturday, Rasmus Paludin, head of a far-right Danish party, held a protest in front of Turkey's
[03:12:14.560 --> 03:12:21.840]  embassy in Stockholm. The Swedish-Danish national set fire to the Koran. That has put Sweden's
[03:12:21.840 --> 03:12:28.400]  NATO application in jeopardy. A session to the military alliance must be approved unanimously
[03:12:28.400 --> 03:12:36.160]  by member states, including Turkey. After Erdogan's declaration, Turkey and northern Syria were
[03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:42.480]  devastated by a series of earthquakes in southern Turkey with a death toll that has reached well
[03:12:42.480 --> 03:12:49.120]  over 11,000 people. Turkey is no stranger to earthquakes. The majority of them occurring
[03:12:49.120 --> 03:12:55.200]  in the eastern and western portions of the country. But strange anomalies occurred just
[03:12:55.200 --> 03:13:01.680]  before the earthquakes, leading many to question whether a harp weapon may have been used to
[03:13:01.680 --> 03:13:08.240]  punish the Turkish government for failing to tow the line of NATO's New World Order overlords.
[03:13:15.920 --> 03:13:20.480]  And we will be back after the break shortly. But before we cut to the break, we want to bring
[03:13:20.480 --> 03:13:27.520]  your attention to the speech that you can find in full. We did a special report a few days ago.
[03:13:27.520 --> 03:13:32.640]  We've got the poster there before we can bring that up. So that was Samantha Edwards doing a
[03:13:32.640 --> 03:13:39.920]  special report on the earthquake, on the geopolitical situation, on the fact that harp was most
[03:13:39.920 --> 03:13:48.160]  probably used in this earthquake in Turkey and Syria. And it is a retaliation from the deep state.
[03:13:48.160 --> 03:13:53.920]  Check out our channel here on band.video, the Countessman Channel. It's a very good report
[03:13:53.920 --> 03:13:58.960]  by Samantha Edwards. And at the end, you can watch the full speech. We're not going to play the full
[03:13:58.960 --> 03:14:05.520]  speech in this fourth hour, but we're going to have Diana on shortly because her speech,
[03:14:05.520 --> 03:14:10.160]  Calvin, was absolutely monumental. It certainly was. She's certainly not backwards and coming
[03:14:10.160 --> 03:14:16.480]  forward. She's one of the most fine senators there is. I think she said 30,000 euro to date
[03:14:16.480 --> 03:14:20.640]  because she will not shut up. She will not sit down and she calls it how she sees it.
[03:14:20.640 --> 03:14:28.320]  Yeah, no COVID compliance from her. She is known as the Xena Warrior Princess over there in Romania.
[03:14:28.320 --> 03:14:32.720]  So that's her connection to New Zealand because of course that was filmed down under.
[03:14:32.720 --> 03:14:39.120]  Now at the end of our time here on the Alex Jones show today, we are going to actually show you
[03:14:39.120 --> 03:14:44.400]  some of the major weather occurrences that we've been having because Auckland alone,
[03:14:44.400 --> 03:14:52.080]  our biggest city, has had 50% of its annual rain in only the last 45 days. So there are a lot of
[03:14:52.080 --> 03:14:57.280]  questions being asked here in New Zealand about what weather manipulation technologies could be
[03:14:57.280 --> 03:15:02.640]  used here as well. It's been going on for a long time, 1944, 1945. You will find them in the archives
[03:15:02.640 --> 03:15:08.640]  here in New Zealand and of course San Diego over in California about Project SEAL. We're back in
[03:15:08.640 --> 03:15:13.440]  World War II. There were lit enough detonations five miles from the coast to create many soon
[03:15:13.440 --> 03:15:18.400]  armies. They have since perfected their technology. So everything you can start questioning now,
[03:15:18.400 --> 03:15:22.800]  questioning all the earthquakes that happen around you, question the weather that happens around you
[03:15:22.800 --> 03:15:29.120]  because do you notice when we told people that once the COVID, the narrative started collapsing
[03:15:29.120 --> 03:15:33.360]  and it was all pushed to get people jabbed and that's what's causing the deaths,
[03:15:34.640 --> 03:15:37.840]  same thing goes with the weather. They're going to ramp up climate change and that's going to be
[03:15:37.840 --> 03:15:42.800]  the excuse for the new order to come marching on and because you're all going to be once again
[03:15:42.800 --> 03:15:48.400]  want to be saved from the fence of menace. So keep it locked right here on the Alex Jones show.
[03:15:48.400 --> 03:15:55.120]  When we come back, the senator from Romania will be joining us and she will be talking about her.
[03:15:57.280 --> 03:16:03.840]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support InfoWars and band.video.
[03:16:03.840 --> 03:16:07.440]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you. I'm going to do that right now.
[03:16:07.440 --> 03:16:13.760]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry. You guys have no idea how many people
[03:16:13.760 --> 03:16:19.440]  have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez, how many people have just been put on a launch pad
[03:16:19.440 --> 03:16:24.560]  to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself. I've been given so many opportunities
[03:16:24.560 --> 03:16:29.600]  because of this man and because of this platform and I would probably not even be half of where I
[03:16:29.600 --> 03:16:34.080]  am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones. I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and
[03:16:34.080 --> 03:16:40.800]  Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL. Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones
[03:16:40.800 --> 03:16:46.240]  and band.video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone. We need to support
[03:16:46.240 --> 03:16:52.080]  free speech systems right now. So go check out the store. Go support their store. Go support InfoWars.
[03:16:52.080 --> 03:16:54.880]  Leave a donation right now. Don't wait until they're gone.
[03:16:57.360 --> 03:17:02.400]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWars here in the United States
[03:17:02.400 --> 03:17:10.560]  and around the world. We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD. It turns out the top company in
[03:17:10.560 --> 03:17:15.440]  the U.S. for supplements is owned by a patriot and it turns out they're willing to give us deals
[03:17:15.440 --> 03:17:20.240]  that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.

[03:18:11.680 --> 03:18:18.240]  Far and away the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement that features
[03:18:18.240 --> 03:18:24.720]  natokinase. It's a natural proteolytic enzyme. This one is the only enzyme that we're aware
[03:18:24.720 --> 03:18:28.880]  of right now that dissolves the spike protein. This is very important. The spike protein is
[03:18:28.880 --> 03:18:33.360]  loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines. People are
[03:18:33.360 --> 03:18:38.320]  lower with the spike protein. They don't feel well. This is a potential solution. Hydroxychloroquine
[03:18:38.320 --> 03:18:44.480]  comes from a natural substance. So does ivermectin and now natokinase. Isn't it interesting?
[03:18:44.480 --> 03:18:50.560]  Natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.

[03:20:04.800 --> 03:20:31.280]  We are going to play a segment of her mind-blowing speech. We were literally kept us up in the
[03:20:31.280 --> 03:20:37.040]  middle of the night this week to hear a senator and a public elected official over there in
[03:20:37.040 --> 03:20:42.720]  Romania actually saying that harp technology could have been used in this turkey earthquake.
[03:20:42.720 --> 03:20:47.440]  So let's play that portion of her speech and then we'll come back with Diana Jojanovic.
[03:20:52.160 --> 03:20:59.040]  My political statement is titles people had to die and it's not over yet. Dear fellow senators
[03:20:59.040 --> 03:21:05.280]  for three years we have been experiencing a real campaign of mass killing worldwide either
[03:21:05.280 --> 03:21:10.720]  through alleged pandemics and the imminent need to inject untested vaccines that kill people
[03:21:10.720 --> 03:21:16.320]  or through wars that reduce the world's population but rearranges international politics
[03:21:16.320 --> 03:21:22.000]  realigns power polarities and altars borders. We have lived to witness the production of
[03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:26.880]  earthquakes on command which is actually an attack on turkey by the greatest of the world
[03:21:26.880 --> 03:21:34.080]  who totally disliked being set up by Recep Tayyip Erdogan the president of Turkey. Moreover his
[03:21:34.080 --> 03:21:38.960]  position of neutrality and mediator in the Ukrainian-Russian war deeply disturbed them
[03:21:38.960 --> 03:21:44.160]  especially since Turkey is the second great power from a military point of view within NATO.
[03:21:45.120 --> 03:21:51.280]  His position to block Sweden's accession to NATO his speech in Davos as well as the gesture of
[03:21:51.280 --> 03:21:57.120]  leaving in the middle of the press conference defying Schwab did not remain without an echo in the cold
[03:21:57.120 --> 03:22:03.200]  world of leaders the world but no one thought that people would have to die so many people
[03:22:03.200 --> 03:22:10.080]  and in such a terrible way and it's just a warning because it wasn't the most populated area of turkey
[03:22:11.200 --> 03:22:16.960]  150 aftershocks of a devastating earthquake the second larger than the first without the
[03:22:16.960 --> 03:22:23.760]  existence of an epicenter the area being artificially stimulated geological weapons having existed for
[03:22:23.760 --> 03:22:30.160]  a very long time being used so far without causing too many casualties probably for experiments
[03:22:31.360 --> 03:22:37.600]  now it has been put into practice if we look carefully at the map of turkey we will see that
[03:22:37.600 --> 03:22:43.040]  it is furrowed by gas and oil pipelines this being actually one of the goals their destruction
[03:22:43.040 --> 03:22:49.920]  but 10 seconds before the occurrence of the so-called earthquake the Turks closed these pipelines
[03:22:51.040 --> 03:22:57.040]  in addition 24 hours before the earthquake 10 countries withdrew their ambassadors from turkey
[03:22:58.080 --> 03:23:03.040]  five days before its occurrence the Romanian ministry of foreign affairs issued a travel
[03:23:03.040 --> 03:23:08.560]  warning for Romanian citizens in Turkey although there was no danger as did other countries
[03:23:08.560 --> 03:23:16.000]  by killing people they served their interests the maps shown on all the television channels show
[03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:22.480]  that there was no epicenter but a line with thousands of earthquakes the Turkish secret services
[03:23:22.480 --> 03:23:27.840]  are investigating a possible criminal intervention read an involvement of another state in triggering
[03:23:27.840 --> 03:23:33.120]  the first earthquake what followed later being a chain reaction after the destabilization of
[03:23:33.120 --> 03:23:40.000]  the tectonic plates in the region it is very clear that president Erdogan was punished for his courage
[03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:45.920]  dignity and honor and for his closeness to the russian federation in fact a position of neutrality
[03:23:45.920 --> 03:23:55.200]  and mediation for peace i would trade that one senator for every single politician we have in
[03:23:55.200 --> 03:24:03.200]  New Zealand yeah we've got 120 so that's saying a lot so not only is Diana Shishwaka a Romanian senator
[03:24:03.200 --> 03:24:09.120]  she's also a lawyer she founded the SOS political party and is their president she fought for the
[03:24:09.120 --> 03:24:16.160]  freedom of people during the pandemic giving romanians a public voice and awakening consciences
[03:24:16.160 --> 03:24:22.480]  and helping citizens resist pressure to take this poisonous vaccination now we'll bring up some photos
[03:24:22.480 --> 03:24:31.040]  of her as well where she was in parliament and she was famously wearing a dog muzzle so as to
[03:24:31.040 --> 03:24:38.480]  encourage people obviously not to follow the mask mandates and as a result there was a very small
[03:24:38.480 --> 03:24:45.920]  uptake of the compliance with the vaccination so welcome to the show diana we are so grateful
[03:24:45.920 --> 03:24:54.480]  that you have been able to join us today hello thank you for your invitation i'm glad to hear
[03:24:56.560 --> 03:25:02.080]  diana i have to ask was the translation the english translation that was put over your
[03:25:02.080 --> 03:25:11.120]  speech was it correct and do you stand by those words of course it was correct i have here my
[03:25:11.120 --> 03:25:21.920]  speech and i follow your translation okay yeah got it we'll put that up as well on our
[03:25:23.920 --> 03:25:31.360]  i'm a lawyer and i i work with evidence i'm always assuming assuming what i declare especially
[03:25:31.360 --> 03:25:38.320]  since it was a political declaration i'm a senator so uh is an official document in the
[03:25:38.320 --> 03:25:47.920]  senate of romania it's recorded and available to the public the translation is correct uh is part
[03:25:47.920 --> 03:25:56.560]  of my statement is not my entire statement um i did not make this statement without checking and
[03:25:56.560 --> 03:26:04.800]  analyzing very well the topic in general and each word of it um hence the title of the statement
[03:26:04.800 --> 03:26:12.560]  people had to die and it's not over yet because uh as it was a case also in the
[03:26:13.280 --> 03:26:20.960]  pandemic i say pandemic it's not a pandemic it's a pandemic it is about the destruction of tens
[03:26:20.960 --> 03:26:29.360]  of thousands of human life for the aerial uh plans for of the globalists and uh tomorrow there are
[03:26:29.360 --> 03:26:39.680]  going to be millions of victims unfortunately said right absolutely and your speech has been
[03:26:39.680 --> 03:26:46.080]  going viral it's just been absolutely phenomenal that um you know a senator from romania has come
[03:26:46.080 --> 03:26:52.480]  out so hard why did you and i'm trying to speak slowly yes because i know our kiwi accent is a
[03:26:52.480 --> 03:26:57.440]  little bit unusual um we think it's perfect but um for others we know it's harder to understand
[03:26:57.440 --> 03:27:02.560]  what compelled you to make this speech in the first place
[03:27:05.520 --> 03:27:16.800]  um all my speeches are in this way you can uh you can find in my uh in my senator
[03:27:18.800 --> 03:27:27.200]  files the most interventions in the plenary uh are in this way that's why i'm the only
[03:27:27.200 --> 03:27:36.400]  parliamentarian in the democratic world sanctioned for political opinions and statements for three
[03:27:36.400 --> 03:27:44.800]  months for three months i couldn't represent the senate because i told the truth about the
[03:27:44.800 --> 03:27:55.520]  pandemic and the anti-covid vaccination that kills and um yes it's real i'm the most
[03:27:55.520 --> 03:28:06.640]  uh find romanian citizen for a non-compliance with covid laws uh 30 000 euros uh but i um

[03:33:03.280 --> 03:33:17.680]  alex jones we're back live with the alex jones show with the Romanian senator who is calling it
[03:33:17.680 --> 03:33:24.480]  as she sees it and is absolutely convinced that the that it was an attack on turkey not just a random
[03:33:24.480 --> 03:33:29.760]  set of earthquakes she mentioned in her speech that of course it had no epicenter it was a long
[03:33:29.760 --> 03:33:37.840]  line of basically explosions of some form or another welcome back again uh diana if i can just ask
[03:33:37.840 --> 03:33:44.160]  you now you did mention in your speech that diplomats were withdrawn uh just prior oil and gas
[03:33:44.160 --> 03:33:50.000]  pipelines shut down just prior this has all the all the hallmarks of having foreknowledge
[03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:57.920]  how many people do you know within romania or the wider europe that actually believe as you do that
[03:33:57.920 --> 03:34:07.760]  it was actually an attack on turkey a lot of people and uh political uh people uh you know i'm a
[03:34:07.760 --> 03:34:16.960]  senator so i have access to some informations that common people cannot access people are now
[03:34:16.960 --> 03:34:23.280]  scared uh and are scared to believe what is happening before their eyes because it is so
[03:34:23.280 --> 03:34:30.480]  serious and it blows up everything they know about the world and order many may have suspicions about
[03:34:30.480 --> 03:34:38.160]  these earthquakes but very few have the courage and information to say this in public uh especially
[03:34:38.160 --> 03:34:48.480]  fear not uh and the courage is um it's not a quality of a politician the courage is a quality
[03:34:48.480 --> 03:34:57.200]  of a common people who believe in god and who love people i think that because my statement
[03:34:57.200 --> 03:35:05.120]  statement about you say harp uh i would like to tell you something more is not only harp
[03:35:05.120 --> 03:35:14.000]  there are geophysical weapons that we don't know harp is very old harp is invented 50 years ago
[03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:26.080]  and one of my counselor is a general um who work with this kind of weapons so i have spoken with him
[03:35:26.080 --> 03:35:39.280]  and um he told me that i have to get out of this political secret secretomony and to tell the people
[03:35:39.280 --> 03:35:51.600]  the truth even if um uh it would be very risky this general uh 20 years ago wrote a book and
[03:35:51.600 --> 03:36:03.600]  uh the book name is geophysical war 20 years ago his name is emil streino a great general
[03:36:04.400 --> 03:36:16.800]  who now has uh last year had three um a three three time of trying to killing him three times
[03:36:16.800 --> 03:36:26.880]  and um i do know that uh he knows a lot of secrets i know a lot of secrets but if i would
[03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:38.400]  if i would speak loud and clear it would be an enormous shock and i prefer to remain here at harp
[03:36:38.400 --> 03:36:47.360]  and geophysical weapons and uh yes of course my message was received and worldwide spread there are
[03:36:47.360 --> 03:36:53.760]  many uh more who have understood what is really happening in the world and that's the plutocracy
[03:36:53.760 --> 03:37:01.920]  wants to turn turn us into uh guinea pigs the tens of thousands of posts and comments and millions
[03:37:01.920 --> 03:37:09.440]  of views of my senate statements uh on this geophysical weapons spent because i repeat is not
[03:37:09.440 --> 03:37:20.080]  only harp indicate that the world is waking up and becoming aware of the dangers um yeah
[03:37:21.280 --> 03:37:29.120]  if you if you should follow my facebook page you and someone to translate you
[03:37:29.120 --> 03:37:39.760]  you all my statements and the statements for two days ago you will see that i always said
[03:37:40.320 --> 03:37:49.680]  this kind of of things and uh all my colleagues from senate are very afraid of me they do not
[03:37:49.680 --> 03:38:00.560]  have courage they have a lot of problems panel problems and um they um they don't do not have
[03:38:00.560 --> 03:38:08.640]  the courage and your politicians also do not have the courage to tell this truth yeah it's
[03:38:10.640 --> 03:38:17.520]  it's very dangerous but i use this danger absolutely and um you will be remembered for
[03:38:17.520 --> 03:38:24.320]  your courage now just um in this next four minutes can you please explain to the world
[03:38:24.960 --> 03:38:31.120]  um you know about some of these globalist players like george soros and his cronies
[03:38:31.120 --> 03:38:36.960]  what are they actually doing um in your region of the world and how are they influencing things
[03:38:36.960 --> 03:38:48.880]  yeah george soros is my friend yeah it's my it's my best friend is my best enemy and uh
[03:38:48.880 --> 03:38:55.280]  he also thinks about me in this way uh at this moment the deep states and george soros are making
[03:38:55.280 --> 03:39:01.760]  a war in our region refusing through their puppets and peace negotiations uh any peaceful
[03:39:01.760 --> 03:39:08.880]  solution and attacking anyone who is trying to avoid escalation of the conflict on an even
[03:39:09.600 --> 03:39:18.080]  a larger scale anyone who talks about peace in romania or in europe or all over the world
[03:39:18.080 --> 03:39:25.040]  becomes an enemy of the people anyone who proposes a peaceful solution is assimilated to
[03:39:25.040 --> 03:39:33.600]  terrorists or or traitors uh that is happening with me too uh look at what happened to to turkey
[03:39:33.600 --> 03:39:42.160]  because erdogan tried to mediate the peace the deep state become med when here's the word peace
[03:39:42.800 --> 03:39:51.920]  one of the most beautiful words on this planet is peace and began to attack the peacemaker in every
[03:39:51.920 --> 03:40:01.120]  possible way but um let's remember uh what says the new testament blessed are the peacemakers for
[03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:10.160]  they will be called children of god so if us those who ask for peace are the children of god
[03:40:10.800 --> 03:40:17.440]  whose children are those who asked for war i told you there are the children of satan
[03:40:17.440 --> 03:40:27.200]  this is the proof that they are afraid um of us or for us because uh we are speaking the truth we
[03:40:27.200 --> 03:40:34.240]  have the courage to speak the truth anyone who speaks of peace is put on the bow of infamy
[03:40:34.800 --> 03:40:43.440]  and attack and is attacked from all sides this is what happened also in romania when um i i'm
[03:40:43.440 --> 03:40:54.240]  glad to to tell you here um the first the first movement for peace in the world was mine in
[03:40:54.240 --> 03:41:05.600]  26 february 2021 2022 after i don't know three or four days about uh after uh the war began
[03:41:05.600 --> 03:41:14.400]  and um it is a unique initiative named neutrality for romania the peace from bucores because
[03:41:14.960 --> 03:41:22.880]  i asked all the countries to come to bucores in our house of parliament which name is house of
[03:41:22.880 --> 03:41:36.000]  of people house of romanian nations is the second greatest um um build in the in in the world after
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:44.880]  the pentagon so i said we have a lot of chambers come here and negotiate the peace because uh it's
[03:41:44.880 --> 03:41:55.120]  very uh it's very nice for the american for neto they are 10 000 kilometers far away from this place
[03:41:55.120 --> 03:42:05.200]  but we are at hundreds of kilometers next to to the world so for me it's not uh it's not acceptable
[03:42:05.200 --> 03:42:15.040]  acceptable to have war uh uh next uh next to me so next to my borders the peace uh the peace from
[03:42:15.040 --> 03:42:25.040]  bucrest um wasn't very nice uh not even for uh for the president of romania for the government

[03:48:14.720 --> 03:48:20.960]  clear to me that at this point things at the international level have gotten out of hand
[03:48:20.960 --> 03:48:27.040]  the fools are playing as god and they think they have won the game they didn't want the game
[03:48:27.760 --> 03:48:35.600]  cause of this demanded and psychopathic people because they are ill who cause wars and cataclysm
[03:48:35.600 --> 03:48:44.480]  using unconventional weapons where humans are just numbers they can get rid of it is imperative that
[03:48:44.480 --> 03:48:53.520]  all the nations the peoples of the world rise up together wake up from daily comfort and carelessness
[03:48:53.520 --> 03:49:05.280]  and just like in the revolution of 1848 uh look out on uh on google 1848 a very important revolution
[03:49:05.280 --> 03:49:13.680]  for liberty will begin the struggle for liberation from the yoke of the psychopaths of demanded people

[03:52:12.400 --> 03:52:18.880]  we want to get these all around the country now um if you want to keep in the fight we have to put
[03:52:18.880 --> 03:52:25.760]  in um a good shout out for info wars store dot com at this point because of course they have some

[03:52:42.640 --> 03:52:49.280]  win-win uh 360 win situation there now carwin on our way out shall we play some of the footage
[03:52:49.280 --> 03:52:55.280]  and speak over it as to the horrific uh weather that new zealand has been experiencing it's summer
[03:52:55.280 --> 03:53:00.640]  down here if you don't know we've had um hail we've had rain um let's get that b-roll out we've
[03:53:00.640 --> 03:53:07.600]  had deluges we've had um of course cyclone gabriel has come through some said it was going to be a
[03:53:07.600 --> 03:53:12.720]  nothing but it turned out to be more than and i think it was quite a something uh people losing
[03:53:12.720 --> 03:53:18.800]  their homes underwater even when the army got deployed they lost one of the unimogs there's
[03:53:18.800 --> 03:53:25.440]  still some people missing unfortunately we've lost two firefighters in the um rescuing attempts so
[03:53:25.440 --> 03:53:32.160]  our hearts go out to them and their families and in the first uh round which was actually just on
[03:53:32.160 --> 03:53:37.920]  about around the 28th of january when the first deluge came you know um there were i think three
[03:53:37.920 --> 03:53:44.640]  to four lives that went missing um what you're seeing here is very very unusual in some ways i
[03:53:44.640 --> 03:53:50.880]  mean of course yes we have floods but um i don't remember ever seeing these types of floods in my
[03:53:50.880 --> 03:53:56.800]  lifetime Auckland the biggest city um these are buses what you're seeing here in in Auckland that
[03:53:56.800 --> 03:54:03.520]  were just completely uh driving with water in the water this was an an image that went viral here
[03:54:03.520 --> 03:54:08.800]  now bearing in mind Auckland has been flooded previously so it's not a new occurrence what
[03:54:08.800 --> 03:54:16.080]  is new of course is because 30 years of labor linked um local government did not spend enough
[03:54:16.080 --> 03:54:22.880]  money in infrastructure storm water etc they have basically done a rack pack and stack of the city
[03:54:22.880 --> 03:54:29.040]  bought in a lot of people um but the existing infrastructure was not enough to take care of
[03:54:29.040 --> 03:54:35.040]  it and if you're not looking after your pipes nothing's gonna flow and this is one of the
[03:54:35.040 --> 03:54:41.680]  reasons why of course there's about 300 million dollars missing from the Auckland council budget
[03:54:41.680 --> 03:54:49.760]  as the departure of the labor connected Phil Goff and their um city ceo that needs to be
[03:54:49.760 --> 03:54:56.080]  investigated as well yes and those images earlier were of supermarkets the um Auckland
[03:54:56.080 --> 03:55:04.480]  international airport underwater and um in this last round this week of of torrential rain um on
[03:55:04.480 --> 03:55:11.280]  the east coast it's you know we've got major state highways being disconnected from um you know
[03:55:11.280 --> 03:55:18.000]  centres of of uh well we major centres are being disconnected people are being disconnected
[03:55:18.000 --> 03:55:24.400]  and the prime minister made a statement yesterday saying that the recovery is going to take years
[03:55:24.400 --> 03:55:30.880]  because this is really um really massive destruction Kelvin it's the fastest way to bring in the uh
[03:55:30.880 --> 03:55:37.200]  well the great reset isn't it let's just destroy a country and have everyone pushed into another
[03:55:37.200 --> 03:55:42.400]  area declaring those others uninhabitable because New Zealanders would not have bought it otherwise
[03:55:42.400 --> 03:55:50.000]  we have lived up to earthquakes um we've lived up in the past to tsunamis we've lived up to
