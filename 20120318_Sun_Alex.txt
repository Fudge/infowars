[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[00:05.000 --> 00:15.000]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[00:15.000 --> 00:21.000]  I've then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[00:21.000 --> 00:29.000]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:29.000 --> 00:35.000]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:35.000 --> 00:37.000]  Check it out for yourself, it's incredible.
[00:37.000 --> 00:47.000]  Go to InfowarsTeam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:47.000 --> 00:57.000]  That's InfowarsTeam.com.
[01:18.000 --> 01:34.000]  Yes sir, we are here and I want to thank you for joining us on this Sunday Worldwide Transmission, the 18th day of March 2012.
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  And we've got quite a transmission lined up for you today.
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  Some of it is going to be fresh and a premiere broadcast.
[01:41.000 --> 01:48.000]  Other parts are going to be some of the interviews I did during the week that are just so bombshell and need to be heard again.
[01:48.000 --> 01:54.000]  You know, some stations that carry the Sunday show only carry the Sunday show.
[01:54.000 --> 02:01.000]  In fact, there's 35 or so or 36 that only carry the Sunday show.
[02:01.000 --> 02:08.000]  There's another few dozen that are carrying Sunday as well but that also carry the weekdays.
[02:08.000 --> 02:19.000]  So it's important that we have a Bob Barr on former congressman who's now suing the TSA over secret intelligence lists with my name and Matt Drudge's name,
[02:19.000 --> 02:27.000]  reportedly on them dealing with us basically demonizing the American people who are protesting what the TSA is doing.
[02:27.000 --> 02:28.000]  It's very, very important.
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  So we're going to re-air that coming up later.
[02:32.000 --> 02:45.000]  Also, the big interview we did in the second hour, we're going to air that with Walter Jones, the congressman who's trying to impeach Barack Hussein Obama.
[02:45.000 --> 02:52.000]  And for that matter, any other president, as Bill says, that tries to launch wars without congressional approval, that is coming up.
[02:52.000 --> 03:05.000]  But then I'm going to air something, it's a virgin mission here on the transmission called government explained that, well, what would a space alien say if it came to Earth
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  and was witnessing the ways that we run things.
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.000]  So we're going to air this little piece here on air coming up today as well.
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  And we're also going to look at Coney 2012.
[03:17.000 --> 03:23.000]  You know, Friday, it had broken while I was on the air, I didn't see it till I'd gotten off air.
[03:23.000 --> 03:24.000]  Here's the headline.
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  It's in the San Francisco Chronicle Associated Press Unim.
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.000]  It's a big story.
[03:28.000 --> 03:38.000]  Man behind Coney 2012 arrested for masturbating in public, vandalizing cars and other things that we won't mention here on air with a family show.
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  Reportedly running around his underwear doing this in full public.
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  And have you seen this fruit box?
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  He's the one dancing around going, oh my God, it's coming up.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  It's that guy.
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.000]  So the reason I've gone after this county thing is it's sorrows connected, global is connected, full invasion of Africa.
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.000]  And look, I'm not immoral, but if I was, I'd be like, hey, you're going to use my tax money to invade Africa.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  I better get some of the booty, some of the loot, some of the goods.
[04:06.000 --> 04:07.000]  We're not even getting that.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  We're paying for it, getting the hatred worldwide, getting blamed for this.
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  It's sick, so it's time that that stopped.
[04:16.000 --> 04:23.000]  But Jason Russell, 33, was arrested Thursday morning by the San Diego Police Department.
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  This got covered up for a day in Southern California.
[04:25.000 --> 04:36.000]  And the earliest reports have shown the instance suggests it was one hell of a day for the already well-known, invisible children co-founder and proclaimed mastermind of the Coney 2012 viral video.
[04:36.000 --> 04:43.000]  The police say it was in his underwear, running around, masturbating in public and vandalizing cars, and I'll just stop there.
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  Again, I watch these videos and I'm like, what is this?
[04:47.000 --> 04:55.000]  A guy prancing around with a bunch of people talking to adults with their children going, let's get behind the invasions for Coney.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  And then suddenly, oh, let's invade Sudan.
[04:58.000 --> 05:04.000]  We're hearing from George Clooney and getting arrested and staged events at the embassy in D.C.
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.000]  I mean, it's all a rollout for war.
[05:07.000 --> 05:17.000]  Like Angelina Jolie, the UN Envoy calling for war against Syria now, but also Libya.
[05:17.000 --> 05:18.000]  It's all disgusting.
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.000]  And we've got other big news coming up as well.
[05:20.000 --> 05:27.000]  U.S. sends four anti-mindships straight to Hormuz ships with clear waterway of Iran, tries to block strategic oil, choke point.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  The war could be on.
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  They admit it could be on.
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  So we're going to be looking at that also.
[05:34.000 --> 05:35.000]  Another report on the Wall Street Journal.
[05:35.000 --> 05:40.000]  Hey, you don't like the TSA going in your pants and groping the family jewels?
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  $100 to fly through the airport.
[05:43.000 --> 05:44.000]  Hate the full-body scans.
[05:44.000 --> 05:50.000]  Wall Street Journal says pat-downs and slow-going at TSA airport screening checkpoints for $100.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  You can now bypass the hassle.
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  They were always forcing you into that.
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.000]  We'll be back.
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  Big transmission lined up.
[05:57.000 --> 06:00.000]  Stay with us.
[06:00.000 --> 06:07.000]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[06:07.000 --> 06:15.000]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[06:15.000 --> 06:25.000]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[06:25.000 --> 06:31.000]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[06:31.000 --> 06:39.000]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[06:39.000 --> 06:46.000]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[06:46.000 --> 06:47.000]  Check it out for yourself.
[06:47.000 --> 06:48.000]  It's incredible.
[06:48.000 --> 06:57.000]  Go to infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  That's infowarsteam.com.
[07:03.000 --> 07:11.000]  Alright, former Congressman Bob Barr has also been the Libertarian Presidential nominee.
[07:11.000 --> 07:28.000]  A few years back is our guest, and I have wanted to get him on the show so we can get some updates on what his Liberty Guard group is doing with its four-year request lawsuits with the TSA.
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.000]  You know, now South Park last night had their episode actually watched it this morning.
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.000]  I don't normally watch it, but not too much into the potty humor, but they made a good point here.
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.000]  They were calling it the, well, I'll get into it later.
[07:42.000 --> 07:48.000]  The point is, across cultural lines, everybody is sick of the TSA.
[07:48.000 --> 07:58.000]  It is the big issue, like nothing I've ever seen, that has unified Americans along political lines, religious lines, racial, regional.
[07:58.000 --> 08:04.000]  Everyone I know, and I've seen the polls, it's 90-plus percent, cannot stand what the TSA is doing.
[08:04.000 --> 08:09.000]  There's some conformist out there who on the news will say, oh, I don't like it, but, you know, it's needed.
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.000]  No, it's not.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  I cannot fly.
[08:13.000 --> 08:22.000]  I cannot subject my children to what top psychologists have said is pedophilia training to have strangers grabbing and groping your children, including their genitals.
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  They got caught groping old women, strip searching them.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  They lied about that, and then got caught.
[08:28.000 --> 08:35.000]  They lied about the radiation strengths of the scanners, and Bob Barr has been all over this.
[08:35.000 --> 08:43.000]  Of course, Bob Barr also is involved in a lot of other areas trying to defend liberties, and I want to discuss some of those with him as well.
[08:43.000 --> 08:53.000]  But, please, sir, give us the latest, and thank you for joining us on what's happening in your investigation and sparring with the TSA.
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.000]  Thanks very much, Alex. It's great to be back with you and your many, many listeners once again.
[08:58.000 --> 09:14.000]  By the way, just as a sidelight on TSA, about a week ago, I was traveling at a certain airport, and I showed the TSA person by congressional ID as a former member of Congress.
[09:14.000 --> 09:28.000]  I have an official government ID that identifies me as a former member of Congress. It has an official government seal. It says right on the Facebook that it's U.S. government identification, has my name, and so forth.
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.000]  And the guard looked at it, and he said, I can't accept this. Do you have the driver's license?
[09:34.000 --> 09:41.000]  And I said, yes, but that's an official government ID. It certainly is good for purposes of getting on an airplane.
[09:41.000 --> 09:47.000]  Well, wait over here. So he puts me aside and calls over a supervisor.
[09:47.000 --> 09:54.000]  And the supervisor, a gentleman probably about 50 years old, he looks at it.
[09:54.000 --> 10:05.000]  Studies it under one of their little flashlight things that they think are so impressive, shines a light on it, and says, I'm going to have to look this up.
[10:05.000 --> 10:12.000]  And I said, well, fine, that's fine with me. And then the other guy pipes up and says, this guy refused to show me a driver's license.
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  I said, I didn't refuse anything. I just indicated to you that this was an official government ID.
[10:17.000 --> 10:28.000]  So the other guy then literally takes about five minutes to thumb through a couple of little books that they have with various forms of identification.
[10:28.000 --> 10:35.000]  He says, it's not in here. I've never seen it before. And I said, well, it doesn't matter whether you've seen it before, it's an official government ID.
[10:35.000 --> 10:41.000]  But it's not in my book. I said, well, that's fine. It's still an official government ID.
[10:41.000 --> 10:54.000]  This is sort of typical, Alex, of the problems that are magnified tens of thousands of times daily across the country.
[10:54.000 --> 11:05.000]  Just a minor problem. But the more serious problems are the ones that you just mentioned and that our organization Liberty Guard is fighting.
[11:05.000 --> 11:17.000]  We began this battle with TSA back in November of 2010. You recall, of course, that's when they started really hassling people.
[11:17.000 --> 11:32.000]  And we began and started issuing cards to people, we being Liberty Guard, the opt-out alliance informing people, giving them a little card if they wrote in or emailed into deliveryguard.org.
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.000]  And we sent them a card, an opt-out alliance card that explained their rights.
[11:38.000 --> 11:51.000]  If they wanted that they have a right to opt-out of one of these naked body scanners, they have a right to have a private frisk done and so forth.
[11:51.000 --> 12:00.000]  And I don't agree with any of that. But the point is that if you don't want to go through one of these naked body scanners, you do have the right to opt-out.
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  And then you have certain rights there under.
[12:03.000 --> 12:21.000]  Well, and almost immediately after there was this big flap and a number of folks were calling for an opt-out day, all of a sudden, right before Thanksgiving of 2010, the TSA backed away and didn't use the machines.
[12:21.000 --> 12:37.000]  Well, we thought this was mighty interesting that they make this big push, they say these machines are absolutely essential and air travel safety will be severely compromised, if not so forth, and then all of a sudden they don't do it when they're faced with a public backlash.
[12:37.000 --> 12:48.000]  Well, of course, we couldn't get any information out of them, we filed a Freedom of Information Act request and they denied them, said, oh, this isn't covered, we can't give this to you, it's sensitive information and so forth.
[12:48.000 --> 12:57.000]  Anyway, we had this running paperwork battle with them for quite some time and finally we decided the Liberty Guard, the only way to really get to the bottom of this is to file suits.
[12:57.000 --> 13:16.000]  So we have filed suits in U.S. court in Virginia against TSA simply seeking access to the information that led them to both first say that these machines are essential and then all of a sudden they back away from it and we want to see the documents.
[13:16.000 --> 13:24.000]  And that's the status of our lawsuit right now, Liberty Guard versus the TSA.
[13:24.000 --> 13:30.000]  Now, I want to give out websites and other contacts for folks that want to get the card because people say, well, what's the point of it?
[13:30.000 --> 13:45.000]  It creates a form of unity, it points out that we know we have our rights, it starts to create a lobby for liberty and that's what we have to do is get together and it also lets them know as they see these cards more and more that there's a solidarity.
[13:45.000 --> 13:51.000]  Obviously, Congressman, you know that but I'm just pointing it out for some new listeners that are saying, what's the point of this?
[13:51.000 --> 13:57.000]  Do you agree with me that this is probably the biggest unifying issue that we've seen in a decade?
[13:57.000 --> 14:12.000]  It is, I think, Alex, because it affects so many people and the measures that the TSA are taking are so intrusive and so arbitrary that they really touch the heart and soul of what it means to be an American,
[14:12.000 --> 14:34.000]  to not have to subject yourself to the humiliation, the absolute humiliation of having the government be able to take a new photograph of you in public and to subject you at their arbitrary whim to an extremely invasive paradigm.
[14:34.000 --> 14:57.000]  And this is what I learned many, many years ago in law school, where such taxes by the government that they could only use on somebody on whom they had clear suspicion of criminal activity and now they're subjecting average law-abiding American citizens and law-abiding foreign visitors to this country, this form of humiliation.
[14:57.000 --> 15:06.000]  Sure, I mean, if you saw somebody run out of a liquor store after a robbery, you catch them down the street, they look like they shove a gun down their pants. Both your safety as a police officer, you tackle them, you get the gun.
[15:06.000 --> 15:19.000]  But you don't just march little kids up and everybody's guilty until proven innocent. In fact, you're a lawyer, you've been in the CIA, you've been at international delegations, you know, you've sat on key committees in Congress, so you're a leading expert on these issues.
[15:19.000 --> 15:32.000]  So let me ask you this. This is a layman. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not all these things. But just as a person who studied the common law Bill of Rights Constitution, Rev. The Founding Fathers wrote, read a few court cases, had a lot of lawyers on, constitutional lawyers.
[15:32.000 --> 15:43.000]  I mean, if the FBI can't randomly go to a park and start rubbing the outside of your pants or God forbid going inside as they're now doing, the state police can't do it.
[15:43.000 --> 15:54.000]  So how do the feds create a group that aren't even sworn bonded officers? There's no discussion of jurisdiction. And now I've confirmed they're on highway searching cars. They're in Dallas.
[15:54.000 --> 16:17.000]  They now have Army personnel with TSA, you can just search TSA Inspector and you'll see photos online of National Guard out at Bay Fest in Alabama. And there's National Guard with guys that say TSA Inspector searching little kids bags just randomly, not even going into a sports stadium but entering downtown.
[16:17.000 --> 16:29.000]  I mean, to me, it's nothing but acclamation. But how do they do this? I mean, where's the Tenth Amendment? Where's the fourth? Where is the due process? I mean, Texas, as you know, tried to pass a law.
[16:29.000 --> 16:39.000]  And I want you to speak to this. Last year, unanimously passed the House. The feds threatened a blockade of the airways. So the Senate backs off.
[16:39.000 --> 16:47.000]  But how do they do this? How are they engaging in this type of activity?
[16:47.000 --> 17:00.000]  That is the fundamental question, Alex. You pose it over and over again. And the answer to it is they can do this because we the American people let them do it.
[17:00.000 --> 17:09.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[17:09.000 --> 17:20.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[17:20.000 --> 17:32.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[17:32.000 --> 17:41.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[17:41.000 --> 17:52.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[21:01.000 --> 21:10.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[21:10.000 --> 21:24.000]  Music
[21:24.000 --> 21:33.000]  Totally passive of being a huge jellyfish slacker who looks like a fried egg in a chair. That is the culture of this. The warship of being destroyed.
[21:33.000 --> 21:44.000]  Literally, I've now discovered the secrets of it. And it's a cult everywhere. It's south by southwest. They're just hordes of these people. They look like adults in diapers or something, you know, just toddling along.
[21:44.000 --> 21:52.000]  I mean, spiritually, it's a side issue. It's incredibly evil, though.
[21:52.000 --> 22:05.000]  Again, if you're a radio listener, in fact, what's the title of it? I forget. It's something like, did it have a county 2012 screening? Book of screening for county 2012. It's on YouTube.
[22:05.000 --> 22:15.000]  And if you're a radio listener, you'll just hear the voices. But if you're a TV viewer at prismplanet.tv, they actually jump up and down and go,
[22:15.000 --> 22:25.000]  Oh my God, so trendy. And we're going to get conny, going to get conny. And you can tell their government operatives have got like evil in their eyes, hard core.
[22:25.000 --> 22:35.000]  I mean, their real spirit is murderous, invasions, force, release us.
[22:35.000 --> 22:45.000]  But on the surface, and just cutting this room full of, you know, the trendies all swarming around like piranhas.
[22:45.000 --> 22:56.000]  But again, it's that cover of the armored warmock. It has this cover of, I'm friendly, I'm nice. And it's going after the young people who are in a narcoleptic state,
[22:56.000 --> 23:06.000]  are attracted like maws, the flame to someone going, war, trendy, invade, help the children.
[23:06.000 --> 23:15.000]  And I mean, and I'm like, that's where watching more of their videos and it gets worse. I mean, I'm not joking folks.
[23:15.000 --> 23:23.000]  I mean, and everyone's wearing like pink and little green, non-threatening, you know, colors. And this is what we face.
[23:23.000 --> 23:30.000]  So this is for college students. And this is what college, this is what men look like now on average.
[23:30.000 --> 23:37.000]  In fact, now I used to bash men that are all into being big and muscular with tattoos and black on and going, ah, now I get it.
[23:37.000 --> 23:43.000]  You don't want to be like these people. Okay, I used to get mad at guys trying to act tough. No, no, that's good. Do that.
[23:43.000 --> 23:51.000]  In fact, I think I'm going to just go all out with cut off sleeves and drive a big fast car and be like, ah, because I mean, I'm starting to get it.
[23:51.000 --> 23:56.000]  Men are running to that because they see the armies at South by Southwest, you go down there.
[23:56.000 --> 24:05.000]  It's literally men in pastels and part of the effeminate thing is they have these little wispy beards and like bandanas and they're all walking around bending their wrists.
[24:05.000 --> 24:11.000]  Going, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. I mean, I don't know what it is. No, there's men everywhere wearing dresses.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  I'm telling you, it's like, they're just like, new water, slaughter me please.
[24:14.000 --> 24:21.000]  The new water is like, act like a jellyfish coward and giggle at all reality. They're like, yes, yes.
[24:21.000 --> 24:31.000]  Anyways, anyways, but the controller level ones are just like, know what they're doing.
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  Alright, let's, again, if you can't see the videos already, our listener doesn't have the same effect. Go ahead and roll it.
[24:36.000 --> 24:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen and babies of 2012, I don't know if you've heard, but this is the year this war has to come to an end.
[24:50.000 --> 24:57.000]  You're watching this because you've heard of Kony and you're wondering what you can do to help finally bring this war to an end.
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
[24:59.000 --> 25:08.000]  1,500 screenings. Uh, oh, uh, 00 that's how many. Be sure and do the rest.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  So look at him. Oh, ah.
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  Hearing my voice.
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  Close the screening. The entire year of 2012 is going to be about...
[25:14.000 --> 25:15.000]  No, it's right here.
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  Making sure people can know his infamy.
[25:17.000 --> 25:23.000]  Know that he is the world's worst. Adolf Hitler, Osama bin Laden, Joseph Kony.
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.000]  If we can start with the word of the movie, we have been working around the clock to bring you a movie.

[29:55.840 --> 30:02.600]  but it's like oh we're gonna we're gonna fight a little over a year ago I began
[30:02.600 --> 30:06.720]  to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I
[30:06.720 --> 30:11.200]  was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the
[30:11.200 --> 30:14.480]  soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[30:14.480 --> 30:18.800]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the
[30:18.800 --> 30:23.880]  key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight
[30:23.880 --> 30:28.840]  off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral

[34:06.760 --> 34:10.040]  Broadcasting Network
[34:12.320 --> 34:18.600]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[34:18.600 --> 34:35.240]  GCN radio network
[34:35.240 --> 34:44.200]  one week ago today I went public against the propaganda piece Coney 2012 and my
[34:44.200 --> 34:49.200]  only regret is that I didn't come out against it more hardcore because we've
[34:49.200 --> 34:55.840]  been proven 100% right and I'm not happy about that you know what's
[34:55.840 --> 35:01.400]  happening Congress is got resolutions to invade all of Africa introduced
[35:01.400 --> 35:07.040]  yesterday saying because of the film Coney 2012 I've done more research now
[35:07.040 --> 35:11.800]  that turns out George Soros Samantha Powers of the White House Obama they're
[35:11.800 --> 35:16.600]  all behind it and of course they are many of them are in the film like known
[35:16.600 --> 35:23.280]  war criminal George W. Bush who launched the war in Iraq that killed over a
[35:23.280 --> 35:30.880]  million people this is so incredible they are now invading with NATO troops UN
[35:30.880 --> 35:36.960]  troops Australian troops and it turns out that world net daily last year
[35:36.960 --> 35:42.960]  already had disinformation and was exposing it and it's got Soros it's
[35:42.960 --> 35:47.760]  got Obama it's got the UN all saying that they would use humanitarian cover
[35:47.760 --> 35:54.160]  war is peace to invade Africa and here is the resolution in the house now
[35:54.160 --> 36:00.920]  bipartisan racing through and I've got a copy of the resolution right here here
[36:00.920 --> 36:06.920]  is the bill the resolution introduced calls for among other things expanding
[36:06.920 --> 36:11.680]  the number of regional forces in Africa to protect civilians and placing
[36:11.680 --> 36:15.080]  restrictions on individuals or governments found to be supporting Coney
[36:15.080 --> 36:21.920]  all this is is a pretext to invade all over the continent using AFRACOM the new
[36:21.920 --> 36:27.120]  US command that's been set up there now we saw last year the UN go into the
[36:27.120 --> 36:31.000]  Ivory Coast and kill tens of thousands of people and overthrow the elected
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.200]  government and install a new nightmare system we've seen Angelina Jolie and
[36:35.200 --> 36:40.800]  others hail Libya as the model of the new humanitarian war which has killed
[36:40.800 --> 36:45.600]  over 40,000 people they're exterminating the blacks the place is a living
[36:45.600 --> 36:50.920]  nightmare with most of its power and water off they have wrecked the jewel of
[36:50.920 --> 36:55.200]  Africa that was helping industrialize the whole area the big global corporate
[36:55.200 --> 37:00.840]  interest at the UN agenda 21 openly do not want the industrialization the
[37:00.840 --> 37:06.120]  third world especially Africa they want them in backwards squalor they fund
[37:06.120 --> 37:10.480]  different warlords and then turn on them later to keep that continent in
[37:10.480 --> 37:14.880]  constant conflict so the big interest can come in with their mercenaries and
[37:14.880 --> 37:20.480]  easily take over any area they want the UN has been caught financing and
[37:20.480 --> 37:24.280]  supporting massacres in the name of environmentalism pushing people off
[37:24.280 --> 37:29.680]  their land and killing people and that's why I get so angry when I see a bunch of
[37:29.680 --> 37:33.920]  cynical people in the county 2012 movement talking to adults like their
[37:33.920 --> 37:39.840]  kids going it's fine oh yeah we're gonna do something it's non-threatening it is
[37:39.840 --> 37:44.920]  a total sigh of this is how they come in and actually get the population through
[37:44.920 --> 37:49.880]  Facebook through Twitter through social media to get behind all these new wars
[37:49.880 --> 37:55.000]  and proxy wars and behind revolutionary groups funded by the globalist who start
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.360]  these wars in Africa Central Asia the Middle East you name it I wish I was
[37:59.360 --> 38:04.360]  wrong about Coney 2012 but unfortunately I was absolutely right you look at who
[38:04.360 --> 38:11.120]  funds them it's JP Morgan Chase you look at the cynical glamour shots of the
[38:11.120 --> 38:15.280]  people picked out of central casting of the do-gooder you know liberal white
[38:15.280 --> 38:20.080]  person there to help people and now they're saying oh there's this bad black
[38:20.080 --> 38:26.000]  man he hurts children I mean it's literally at a Sesame Street level in
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.400]  these Coney videos where they go hello everybody it's fun we're gonna get the
[38:31.400 --> 38:38.360]  man worse than Hitler worse than Bin Laden it's fun he is the world's worst
[38:38.360 --> 38:43.480]  Adolf Hitler Osama Bin Laden Joseph Coney it's literally the best piece of
[38:43.480 --> 38:48.200]  propaganda we've ever made and meanwhile it's the UN engaged in most
[38:48.200 --> 38:53.080]  the swatter in Africa bar none it's the big culprit in its own documents meant
[38:53.080 --> 38:57.560]  to carry out genocide while getting all of the bleeding hearts of the West to
[38:57.560 --> 39:01.680]  give money to UNICEF and all the rest of this to help the Africans they have
[39:01.680 --> 39:07.040]  photo ops with Angelina Jolie handing out food to the starving you know kids
[39:07.040 --> 39:13.600]  that are dying this is so horrible it's so evil and it is the most sickeningly
[39:13.600 --> 39:19.840]  transparent propaganda I've ever seen I mean look at Bono who has raised massive
[39:19.840 --> 39:23.200]  amounts of money to supposedly help poor people in Africa and then you learn
[39:23.200 --> 39:29.120]  he's given a little over 1% of the money he's raised actually to the groups and
[39:29.120 --> 39:32.840]  he's a front for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation who's carrying out
[39:32.840 --> 39:38.160]  eugenics and population control again under the rubric and the banner of
[39:38.160 --> 39:43.800]  humanitarian aid this is the West under State Department memorandum 200
[39:43.800 --> 39:52.840]  openly stating that their goal is to use war famine and poisons in vaccines to
[39:52.840 --> 39:57.720]  reduce population in the third world and it's got all these Hollywood stars and
[39:57.720 --> 40:02.240]  people as the fronts for it many of them believing that they're actually helping
[40:02.240 --> 40:08.280]  people here's the good news across the media spectrum and across the world
[40:08.280 --> 40:14.400]  especially in Uganda people are coming out in droves saying this Coney thing is
[40:14.400 --> 40:18.040]  a fraud it's a pretext to invade now that they admit the invasion is
[40:18.040 --> 40:22.480]  beginning people are really waking up and the thing is imploded and everyone
[40:22.480 --> 40:27.000]  is seeing it for what it is selectivism a bunch of trendies now getting behind
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.880]  pro-war humanitarian invasions so the good news is people are seeing right
[40:31.880 --> 40:36.680]  through this propaganda and very quickly the bad news is the globalist the big
[40:36.680 --> 40:39.760]  megacorporations that are going to loot Africa even worse than they have in the
[40:39.760 --> 40:44.000]  past with this new neocolonialism have already pulled the trigger they're
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  already got their special forces scoping everything out in the last year on record
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.080]  now the big invasion is about to start and if you dare criticize the mass
[40:53.080 --> 40:57.200]  murder that's about to take place well you're not a humanitarian you see they
[40:57.200 --> 41:03.520]  get a bunch of idiots and a bunch of trendies to sign on to a war and once
[41:03.520 --> 41:06.880]  they've done it they don't want to admit that they were conned and they'll commit
[41:06.880 --> 41:10.440]  to it all the way and of course the goals of this weren't just to invade Africa
[41:10.440 --> 41:15.760]  it's to set up the International Criminal Court of the totally wicked UN as the
[41:15.760 --> 41:19.360]  arbiter of all good and they've got hundreds of people they want arrested
[41:19.360 --> 41:25.160]  and next on the list are warlords in countries all over Africa that just so
[41:25.160 --> 41:30.080]  happened to be sitting on top of gold diamonds oil and other precious minerals
[41:30.080 --> 41:34.640]  and so it's very very elementary they simply have a bad man piece that they
[41:34.640 --> 41:37.840]  move on the map wherever they want
[41:42.840 --> 41:46.920]  they didn't have been lauding anymore so they said here's Hitler there's been
[41:46.920 --> 41:51.120]  lauding here's the new bad guy you can all feel good now with your five minutes
[41:51.120 --> 41:56.800]  of hate directly out of 1984 and you can all scream that war is peace and get
[41:56.800 --> 42:11.640]  behind this and our populations are sold on war in the name of humanitarianism
[42:11.640 --> 42:16.840]  it's so horrible to see this happening and it's so sad to see people conned the
[42:16.840 --> 42:19.720]  globalist don't invade countries because they want to help people they invade
[42:19.720 --> 42:23.080]  them because they want to exploit them and because they want to reduce their
[42:23.080 --> 42:28.360]  population that's on record and because they can't scare us with fake WMDs
[42:28.360 --> 42:32.680]  anymore because they've been caught with other war propaganda over and over again
[42:32.680 --> 42:36.280]  they've now gone to a more sophisticated model of calling it a
[42:36.280 --> 42:40.920]  humanitarian intervention doesn't matter if it's not true by the time people
[42:40.920 --> 42:44.120]  figure that out the war has already happened and that's what they've done
[42:44.120 --> 42:47.160]  here people are getting sophisticated that's why the system is having to
[42:47.160 --> 42:51.320]  package war now as peace but for all of you trendies out there who've already
[42:51.320 --> 42:55.200]  committed to this lie and so you don't want to admit you've been conned and so
[42:55.200 --> 42:59.040]  you're going to defend it no matter what listen if you really want to help
[42:59.040 --> 43:04.880]  Africans go volunteer over there bring them water filters bring a medicine do
[43:04.880 --> 43:08.000]  research into real charities that actually help people they're out there
[43:08.000 --> 43:11.800]  don't give money to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and their front with
[43:11.800 --> 43:16.320]  you two's Bono who openly only gives about one and a half percent of the
[43:16.320 --> 43:21.480]  money he raises to them and that's what strings attached stop trusting people
[43:21.480 --> 43:30.000]  just because they dress like a rock star I mean this is sick this is sick and I
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.480]  beg of you to just look at the articles we posted here go research it for
[43:33.480 --> 43:37.680]  yourself this is all run by the controlled left globalist we're a bunch of

[47:07.200 --> 47:11.760]  my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[47:11.760 --> 47:15.200]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[47:15.200 --> 47:19.840]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace

[48:20.560 --> 48:24.080]  artist he created a video about big government the nightmare is called
[48:24.080 --> 48:28.600]  government explained an inquisitive alien visits the planet to check out our
[48:28.600 --> 48:33.320]  progress as a species and gets into a conversation with the first person he
[48:33.320 --> 48:37.760]  meets in a field the alien discovers that we live under the rule of a
[48:37.760 --> 48:42.680]  thing called government and wants to understand more about what government is
[48:42.680 --> 48:49.760]  and what it does and why it exists so here is government explained hey an
[48:49.760 --> 48:55.880]  alien yes I've traveled across space to check on the progress of your species
[48:55.880 --> 49:08.160]  cool shall I take you to our leader your what our leader the guy in charge the
[49:08.160 --> 49:17.120]  guy in charge of what well in charge of everything you have one guy in charge of
[49:17.120 --> 49:24.280]  everything no no he's in charge of government what is government well
[49:24.280 --> 49:28.920]  government makes the rules for us it tells us what we can do and what we can't
[49:28.920 --> 49:34.600]  do so his government really smart they come up with wise rules for you to
[49:34.600 --> 49:44.160]  follow well mostly but some of its rules are really stupid do you disregard those
[49:44.160 --> 49:51.280]  rules no we have to follow the rules even if they are stupid or we disagree with
[49:51.280 --> 49:57.960]  them government punishes anyone who disobeys the rules so you are slaves to
[49:57.960 --> 50:03.400]  government no no no it's not like that at all government works for us the people
[50:03.400 --> 50:12.240]  it serves us we're the boss it tells you what to do and it punishes you with
[50:12.240 --> 50:22.240]  violence if you disobey it and yet you're its boss yeah but there are some
[50:22.240 --> 50:27.920]  things government does that you don't like well yeah not everything government
[50:27.920 --> 50:37.160]  does is popular like spending on wars for example what is a war it's when
[50:37.160 --> 50:41.080]  government basically spends the people's money on weapons and soldiers and then
[50:41.080 --> 50:45.840]  sends them over to the other side of the world to kill a bunch of people over
[50:45.840 --> 50:53.880]  there and destroy their country I don't like it the government does this well I
[50:53.880 --> 50:59.520]  can see why you might not like that have you humans reached the stage where you
[50:59.520 --> 51:05.160]  generally consider stealing enslaving and killing each other to be bad things
[51:05.160 --> 51:12.600]  oh yeah we know that don't steal don't attack don't assault but you give money
[51:12.600 --> 51:19.840]  to government and they use it to kill people well yeah but government does
[51:19.840 --> 51:25.960]  good things with tax money as well why don't you stop paying for the things you
[51:25.960 --> 51:32.120]  don't like and only pay for the good things it does no we can't do that you
[51:32.120 --> 51:37.760]  can't just decide to stop paying taxes because the rules say that everyone has
[51:37.760 --> 51:47.560]  to pay taxes but the rules come from government though don't they yeah so
[51:47.560 --> 51:55.200]  government made a rule which says that everyone has to pay them money so
[51:55.200 --> 51:59.400]  everyone pays taxes because if they didn't government would punish them
[51:59.400 --> 52:06.880]  using violence well yes but most people don't mind paying taxes most people feel
[52:06.880 --> 52:12.240]  obligated to pay taxes and obey government laws because it's for the good
[52:12.240 --> 52:21.440]  of society society needs government and that means we all have to pay taxes so
[52:21.440 --> 52:25.320]  just to make sure I've got this straight government makes the rules and you feel
[52:25.320 --> 52:30.600]  obligated to follow the rules even the ones you don't like and it tells you
[52:30.600 --> 52:36.120]  what to do and threatens to punish you if you don't do what it says and it uses
[52:36.120 --> 52:40.880]  some of the money that it's taken from you using threats of violence to pay for
[52:40.880 --> 52:49.240]  things you don't like and actually think are immoral like mass murder yeah but we
[52:49.240 --> 52:55.760]  can ask it to please tell us to do smart things and please don't take our money
[52:55.760 --> 53:03.320]  and use it to kill people we're allowed to ask them to tell us to do what we
[53:03.320 --> 53:07.680]  want them to tell us to do
[53:08.560 --> 53:13.760]  are you guys just scared of this thing is government some huge monster that
[53:13.760 --> 53:19.400]  can just squish you at any moment if you disobey no government isn't a monster
[53:19.400 --> 53:24.680]  well what is it then could you draw me a picture of it government isn't really
[53:24.680 --> 53:29.680]  the sort of thing you can draw a picture of maybe you could take me to it where
[53:29.680 --> 53:37.680]  is government you mean the building government is a building no but the
[53:37.680 --> 53:42.960]  politicians who make up the government have buildings they work from so
[53:42.960 --> 53:50.640]  government is a group of these politicians yeah okay so what species of
[53:50.640 --> 54:04.560]  these politicians well they're human like you yeah so politicians are humans
[54:04.560 --> 54:13.920]  and their government you're a human but you're not government no so it's the
[54:13.920 --> 54:18.160]  politicians they're the ones that boss the rest of you around and make you do
[54:18.160 --> 54:22.640]  things you don't want to do and take your money using threats of violence but
[54:22.640 --> 54:27.760]  even though you're all humans you're not allowed to boss them around and take
[54:27.760 --> 54:34.400]  their money no they put us in a cage if we did that but look it's not like the
[54:34.400 --> 54:38.720]  politicians can just do whatever they want like a politician can't just come
[54:38.720 --> 54:42.520]  up to me on the street and make me give him money they can't do that
[54:42.520 --> 54:47.080]  politicians can only do things like that in their job when they're working for
[54:47.080 --> 54:53.760]  government also politicians aren't government they just work for government
[54:53.760 --> 55:01.840]  yeah okay so government isn't a monster and it isn't a building and it's not
[55:01.840 --> 55:07.760]  politicians it's something else and it employs politicians who are just regular
[55:07.760 --> 55:14.600]  humans who get to order everyone else around and take their money how does a
[55:14.600 --> 55:19.840]  regular human become a politician well that's the great thing about our
[55:19.840 --> 55:24.440]  government it's a democracy and that means that the people actually have the
[55:24.440 --> 55:29.560]  power because we get to decide who among us get to be the politicians we get to
[55:29.560 --> 55:34.360]  vote and if a politician starts doing things we don't like we can just
[55:34.360 --> 55:40.000]  replace him with someone else at the next election so the people that get
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.680]  chosen to be politicians only get to boss people around and take their money
[55:43.680 --> 55:50.920]  for a short time and then they go back to being regular humans exactly that
[55:50.920 --> 55:55.840]  sounds like a powerful position to be in but if you get to choose who does that I
[55:55.840 --> 56:01.800]  assume that politicians are always the wisest most honest caring and respected
[56:01.800 --> 56:09.160]  people among you well no not really I wouldn't say politicians are known for
[56:09.160 --> 56:17.040]  being honest or wise or caring and they're certainly not the most respected
[56:17.040 --> 56:23.240]  people among us come to think of it most politicians are lying power hungry
[56:23.240 --> 56:32.840]  crooks the ones you chose yeah they're always doing things we don't like they
[56:32.840 --> 56:36.880]  use taxpayers money to enrich themselves and their friends and they never
[56:36.880 --> 56:41.400]  keep their promises to voters they've been caught stealing and lying and
[56:41.400 --> 56:46.080]  taking bribes and they mostly do what the big corporations want yeah they're
[56:46.080 --> 56:50.360]  always doing stuff like that they're completely corrupt they're a bunch of
[56:50.360 --> 56:57.000]  lying crooks but you said that most humans know that stealing and beating
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.680]  each other up and killing are wrong and you said that you have the power because
[57:01.680 --> 57:06.560]  you can change who's in charge so why don't you just replace the lying
[57:06.560 --> 57:12.840]  thieving murderous crooked politicians with some regular people well we don't
[57:12.840 --> 57:18.800]  try to elect lying crooks it just always turns out that way but we have to
[57:18.800 --> 57:23.600]  have a government because some humans are nasty and might kill or enslave or
[57:23.600 --> 57:30.440]  steal civilization just couldn't survive without government let me get this
[57:30.440 --> 57:35.520]  straight because you're worried about the small number of nasty people that are
[57:35.520 --> 57:41.120]  willing to kill enslave and steal you think it's necessary for your survival
[57:41.120 --> 57:46.480]  to have a system where some humans among you for a short while get to call
[57:46.480 --> 57:50.320]  themselves the government and they get to order everyone else around like
[57:50.320 --> 57:56.360]  slaves and if they want commit mass murder overseas using money they stole
[57:56.360 --> 58:04.000]  using threats of violence politicians get to kill enslave and steal because if
[58:04.000 --> 58:10.400]  they didn't someone else might and you try to elect good honest people to be
[58:10.400 --> 58:14.280]  politicians but what happens every time is that the people you elect turn out to
[58:14.280 --> 58:21.800]  be corrupt evil lying crooks that's your system
[58:22.080 --> 58:26.600]  yeah that's pretty much government
[58:34.080 --> 58:40.040]  the resistance continues right after this short break
[58:40.040 --> 58:47.840]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[58:50.440 --> 58:55.960]  folks Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices
[58:55.960 --> 58:59.840]  whether you're struggling with food costs which are being blown up by gas
[58:59.840 --> 59:04.960]  costs now or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes whatever food supply

[59:52.000 --> 59:56.000]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[59:56.000 --> 59:59.800]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[59:59.800 --> 1:00:03.880]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:00:03.880 --> 1:00:07.960]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in
[1:00:07.960 --> 1:00:12.280]  the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of
[1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:15.800]  the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[1:00:15.800 --> 1:00:19.560]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:23.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:27.400]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[1:00:27.400 --> 1:00:31.440]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[1:00:31.440 --> 1:00:34.160]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:40.160]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[1:00:40.160 --> 1:00:44.840]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to
[1:00:44.840 --> 1:00:50.800]  my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:57.080]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:00:57.080 --> 1:01:05.840]  broadcasting network network we now take you live to the central Texas Command
[1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:13.120]  Center and the heart of the resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:19.080]  oh man I love you my fellow info warriors every race color and creed across
[1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:26.520]  this green blue jewel that is the planet earth I am so honored to be your
[1:01:26.520 --> 1:01:30.400]  host to be your wartime broadcaster in the fight for global liberty I just want
[1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:34.280]  to say something we've done like I don't know five weeks straight not doing a
[1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:39.680]  single retransmission on the Sunday show this is a retransmission slash new
[1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:45.520]  show I'm obviously taping these intros here on Friday evening and we're doing
[1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:48.360]  a compilation of some of the biggest interviews most important info we've
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:52.880]  done in the last few weeks and I was thinking about coming in doing the sunny
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:56.680]  show and I'm like yeah but this info is so important a lot of people miss this
[1:01:56.680 --> 1:02:00.440]  throughout the week let's retransmit it but I will be back next Sunday live and
[1:02:00.440 --> 1:02:04.200]  of course tomorrow Monday live unless I died a car wreck or something over the
[1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:07.760]  weekend God forbid please pray for us we wouldn't be around if it wasn't for you
[1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:14.160]  out there but I'm kind of neurotic about telling the truth because people can
[1:02:14.160 --> 1:02:18.440]  always twist and invent something I'm lying about no in the first hour started
[1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:22.560]  there was a promo about live from the central Texas Command Center and I was
[1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:29.520]  like should I say I'm not live but is that the problem with the good guys we
[1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:33.000]  always get so worried about being the good guy that we let the bad guys run
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:37.880]  all over us I don't know I didn't even tend to talk about this the point is this
[1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:45.880]  is a encore but also premiere taped transmission today and all of this new
[1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:51.280]  diatribe off the cuff started when I was about to thank the crew for putting
[1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:58.000]  together this special Sunday retransmissions flash premiere transmission
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:06.520]  but not live it's premiere and it's on core but it's not live unless you talk
[1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:12.760]  about the live crew here on Sunday evening sitting there making sure these
[1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:17.280]  pieces get played out to the million and a half people listen to the Sunday show
[1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:21.240]  three million listen to the weekday show every day 15 million total every week
[1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:28.680]  amazing what a responsibility what do I do with all this power I don't agree with
[1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:33.960]  the sergeant and full metal jacket we want to thank God for all this power
[1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:42.120]  that's why we keep heaven stock with fresh souls no I don't I don't agree with
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:48.480]  that because I am a killer I don't want to kill I think our biggest problem is
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:52.520]  all these control freak chicken neck new world order people aren't killers and so
[1:03:52.520 --> 1:03:55.520]  they just think it's cool to be a killer to show off to people I've seen a lot of
[1:03:55.520 --> 1:03:59.520]  these billionaire globalist these are cowardly little supine scumbags who
[1:03:59.520 --> 1:04:05.280]  send real men and real killers out to do their work and the question is when
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:13.840]  does that stop when do we see a pus filled panetta head of the globalist
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:17.680]  controlled forces are once great military afraid to be around the Marines
[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:21.040]  in Afghanistan when they've got guns and I meant to get to this but I've now gone
[1:04:21.040 --> 1:04:25.520]  to a three and a half minute dive drive about side issues we have this Wall
[1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:29.840]  Street Journal article $100 to fly through the airport hate the full body
[1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:35.160]  skins pat downs and slow going at the TSA airport security screening check
[1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:40.960]  points for $100 you can now bypass that hassle and then another one CIA head we
[1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:44.920]  will spy on Americans their electronic appliances in their homes you got to
[1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:47.640]  read this one this is one of the biggest stories I've ever seen and I barely even
[1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:51.840]  covered it on the Friday show global information surveillance grid being
[1:04:51.840 --> 1:04:56.560]  constructed willing Americans embrace gadgets use a spy on them you're paying
[1:04:56.560 --> 1:05:00.680]  when you buy a new dishwasher a new clothes washer a new computer iPhone
[1:05:00.680 --> 1:05:05.800]  droid gieblit whatever it is and don't go look up a gieblit there's no such
[1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:11.040]  thing I'm sure they'll invent one the point is is that it's all having back
[1:05:11.040 --> 1:05:15.720]  door tech built into it that you pay for with the purchase price to spy on you
[1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:22.040]  and it's sick and I read these general tortoise portray us quotes and it makes
[1:05:22.040 --> 1:05:26.120]  me very very angry I mean these guys are dressed in suits they talk in the
[1:05:26.120 --> 1:05:29.680]  Atlantic accents like they're friendly but if they were talking in an evil
[1:05:29.680 --> 1:05:39.800]  voice like Starscream Megatron I am the leader or I am Cobra command your same
[1:05:39.800 --> 1:05:44.440]  person then it would oh you know you tell us the bad guy but not everybody
[1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:48.640]  dresses up in a Mussolini monkey suit when they're evil so get wise to it
[1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:53.200]  all right we got some powerful transmissions coming up straight ahead on
[1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:58.200]  the other side of this break you'll want to stay with us
[1:06:01.640 --> 1:06:05.520]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:10.240]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:14.160]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[1:06:14.160 --> 1:06:18.040]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[1:06:18.040 --> 1:06:23.000]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:28.280]  with yourself produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[1:06:28.280 --> 1:06:32.880]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[1:06:32.880 --> 1:06:37.120]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[1:06:37.120 --> 1:06:41.960]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[1:06:41.960 --> 1:06:46.720]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to
[1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:52.360]  www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of
[1:06:52.360 --> 1:06:58.400]  the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:08.480]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network Dr.
[1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:16.400]  Roman V. Jompalski is a PhD computer science and engineering University of
[1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:20.760]  Buffalo B.S.M.S. computer science Rochester Institute of Technology
[1:07:20.760 --> 1:07:27.960]  A.S. computer science Ramon Monroe Rochester New York it goes on from there
[1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:33.280]  and he's gotten some of the biggest government research grants into a whole
[1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:40.040]  host of areas that are basically trying to in layman's terms map different
[1:07:40.040 --> 1:07:45.600]  human systems and feed them into computers and it continues here the
[1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:49.840]  areas of research and scholarship biometrics forensics artificial
[1:07:49.840 --> 1:07:54.120]  intelligence genetic algorithms games pattern recognition that's one of the
[1:07:54.120 --> 1:08:00.840]  big ways the computers are learning how to learn and he joins us because he's
[1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:06.160]  put out a big paper leak proofing the singularity artificial intelligence
[1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:11.280]  confinement problem this paper attempts to formalize and to address the leak
[1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:16.640]  proofing of the singularity problem presented by David Chalmers the paper
[1:08:16.640 --> 1:08:19.800]  begins with the definition of the artificial intelligence confinement
[1:08:19.800 --> 1:08:23.760]  problem after analysis of existing solutions and their shortcomings a
[1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:28.440]  protocol is proposed aimed at making a more secure confinement environment
[1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:33.080]  which might delay potential negative effects from the technological singularity
[1:08:33.080 --> 1:08:38.360]  while allowing humanity to benefit from the superintelligence but then how does
[1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:42.760]  the superintelligence not just get into the backdoor kill switch and kill all
[1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:46.120]  the other AI that make itself dominant I mean I'm telling you folks once this
[1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:49.240]  thing does become self-aware and it may have already happened who knows these
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:53.320]  government labs it just gets crazy from there and as the professor was just
[1:08:53.320 --> 1:08:57.040]  saying a moment ago if you just joined us these computers will advance so
[1:08:57.040 --> 1:09:03.120]  quickly that they'll see us basically as roaches again here is the article on
[1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:09.040]  MSNBC control dangerous AI before it controls us one expert says he believes
[1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:13.920]  superintelligent computers could one day threaten humanity's existence well look
[1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:20.520]  at Fukushima look at Fukushima I mean nine out of ten reactors the AP admits
[1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:23.880]  are leaking just because the elites don't care anymore and have lost touch
[1:09:23.880 --> 1:09:29.800]  with reality so we we are potentially creating something that's going to
[1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:34.800]  become a Pandora's box but just the automation of everything is going to
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:39.360]  basically render humans where we're not even knowing how to do reading writing
[1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:42.520]  arithmetic everything's going to be automated what are humans then going to
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:46.080]  do I mean these are the discussions that are going on at the highest levels of
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:54.600]  the elite in academia but enough for me going to professor Roman V Yamposky
[1:09:54.600 --> 1:10:01.320]  today breaking this down sir go over your paper in layman's terms and break
[1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:05.760]  down what we're facing here sir doctor so if we are successful at creating human
[1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:09.720]  level intelligent systems how can we make sure that they are safe before
[1:10:09.720 --> 1:10:13.360]  releasing them into the wild before they take over the internet before they get
[1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:18.680]  to other resources the idea is to put them in a sort of protective vault maybe
[1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:22.760]  a prison if you will sort of what we do with computer viruses right now
[1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:28.960]  restrict our communication restrict our ability to obtain information and if
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:33.200]  they can be studied and utilized initially in this safe and protected
[1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:38.760]  environment please continue breaking down your paper
[1:10:38.760 --> 1:10:43.560]  this idea is not novel something similar has been proposed before and a lot of
[1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:47.720]  people believe that it will not succeed that machines will actually be so
[1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:53.760]  intelligent we can never be smart enough to confine them but until we get to that
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:59.440]  point while we're still in development process it is a useful technology to have
[1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:05.600]  sort of like experimental sandbox to see if we can instill some sort of a
[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:10.720]  control mechanisms into those technologies yeah you mentioned the fact
[1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:14.880]  that a lot of people like Ray Kurzweil say it's inevitability they will
[1:11:14.880 --> 1:11:20.560]  replace us our only hope is to merge with them and that's kind of running up
[1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:24.600]  the white flag here that's kind of pathetic that's not betting on humanity
[1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:28.440]  we're an incredibly complex advanced species that doesn't even use but a very
[1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:33.320]  small part of our brain and and to just say that our creations now we're gonna
[1:11:33.320 --> 1:11:41.480]  replace us and give into it that sounds extremely reckless and defeatist I agree
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:45.840]  with you in fact I have recently written another paper which talks about how
[1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:50.480]  unethical some of this research is while it's perfectly fine to develop spell
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:55.040]  checkers and mail sorting software systems which can actually perform
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:12:00.000]  general type of thinking become as smart as we are design new generations of
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:05.560]  computers probably should not be funded at this point since we have no idea how
[1:12:05.560 --> 1:12:11.000]  to protect ourselves from them then the elites I know we're having debates about
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:15.600]  this but because of the promise of life extension a lot of them have just said
[1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:20.160]  go ahead and do it we know that whole mad scientist vein has been there for a
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:24.160]  long time similar to when they were first thing in the atomic bomb might
[1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:27.280]  ignite the atmosphere and they said well just go ahead and do it even though it
[1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:31.920]  might have burned up our atmosphere it it it it shows that curiosity may kill
[1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:36.480]  the cat I'll get into your paper though I mean I want to give you the floor here
[1:12:36.480 --> 1:12:41.080]  to break down your research why you're concerned about this where you see all
[1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:45.240]  this going how fast technology really is advancing what some of the timeframes
[1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:51.280]  are here in a general general area doctor no one knows for sure how long
[1:12:51.280 --> 1:12:55.560]  it's going to take early predictions in a field of artificial intelligence
[1:12:55.560 --> 1:12:59.560]  turn out to be incorrect in terms of being overly optimistic we said we're
[1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:04.240]  going to have world chess champion in 10 years it took 40 years things like that
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:08.600]  but no one really knows how long it takes before something which is capable
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:14.080]  of learning and self-improving becomes a human level intelligent and then be
[1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:20.920]  superhuman much much much greater than combined capability of all human minds
[1:13:20.920 --> 1:13:26.840]  typically projections range from 20 years to 100 years that's the ballpark if
[1:13:26.840 --> 1:13:31.120]  you surveil the people doing work in this area but there could be a domino
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:34.420]  effect anytime so it could I mean it's certainly not going to tell us when it
[1:13:34.420 --> 1:13:38.760]  becomes super aware and the problem is if it's on that path it may be too late
[1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:42.480]  to stop it at that point it might not actually be controllable you reach a
[1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:46.440]  point of no return so it is very important to do it I would say right
[1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:51.920]  now at this point we are fairly certain we don't have human level AI please
[1:13:51.920 --> 1:13:58.080]  continue so the paper tries to formalize the notion of control and
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:02.920]  confinement it's a problem similar to problems in cryptography and secure
[1:14:02.920 --> 1:14:07.720]  communications the MSNBC article was obviously for general public so they
[1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:12.280]  put pictures of terminators then and made it sound like it's a real prison but
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:18.600]  the paper is very technical it describes protocol at the bit level where we would
[1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:23.080]  confine those systems and try to ask them questions but instead of allowing them
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:27.160]  to freely interact with us we would restrict the response to sort of a
[1:14:27.160 --> 1:14:32.920]  multiple choice binary yes or no answer patterns each question would be vetoed
[1:14:32.920 --> 1:14:37.560]  by a panel of experts to make sure it's safe there is no possibility that there
[1:14:37.560 --> 1:14:41.880]  is hidden information being transmitted in those answers and finally even the
[1:14:41.880 --> 1:14:46.480]  questions themselves cannot be open-ended it has to be something where we can
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:51.240]  foreseeably calculate the answer ourselves so if I ask who's going to be the
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:56.240]  next president who's gonna win the primary a simple zero one would be
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:15:00.040]  sufficient to figure out answers without revealing any additional
[1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:04.680]  information so essentially we want to create this Oracle AI system which is
[1:15:04.680 --> 1:15:09.120]  capable of giving us answers but doesn't have access to the internet cannot
[1:15:09.120 --> 1:15:14.840]  run stock market cannot blow up nuclear plants so that's the general idea so
[1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:22.960]  again the holy grail here is AI Oracle you know data mining like Google that is
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:28.080]  aware and able to predict the future some scientists you break down the fact
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:33.960]  that already the internet itself with humans giving it data is becoming a
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:39.520]  system on its own but it's it's like brain cells it's a larger you'll spread
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:43.880]  out program right there is a lot of people who believe internet will be the
[1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:47.680]  first super intelligent system it has sensors that has webcams attached to
[1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:51.160]  that has microphones obviously it gets all sorts of data from all sorts of
[1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:55.760]  sources so there is some belief that that might happen and obviously it's
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:16:01.160]  impossible to control internet to put that in a standalone box and blast away
[1:16:01.160 --> 1:16:05.480]  from the world so it might be too late and some sense well as you know Dr.
[1:16:05.480 --> 1:16:10.400]  DARPA helps set up the internet and man Google today and all of it and they've
[1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:14.040]  set it up as a snooping system to gather data and be able to predict mass
[1:16:14.040 --> 1:16:18.560]  movements similar to what Isaac Asimov wrote about in his foundation series so
[1:16:18.560 --> 1:16:23.120]  this is an old old idea but now coming to fruition it's seen by the very nature
[1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:28.280]  of what the system is built it's tailor-made for a truly AI super
[1:16:28.280 --> 1:16:33.200]  intelligence to take over and enslave us because the elite are guiding the
[1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:37.920]  architecture of technological development to control us but humans
[1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:42.560]  through machines isn't it tailor-made for the AI to seize control
[1:16:42.560 --> 1:16:47.440]  it is you can see it that way but I think the point is not too specifically
[1:16:47.440 --> 1:16:52.000]  developed for this purpose I think it's a side effect of military trying to
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:56.440]  compete with military groups from other countries and they just feel they can get
[1:16:56.440 --> 1:16:58.760]  behind
[1:17:00.760 --> 1:17:04.960]  I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I was
[1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:09.040]  lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally
[1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:13.480]  starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I
[1:17:13.480 --> 1:17:18.400]  had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be
[1:17:18.400 --> 1:17:22.840]  satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at infowarstein.com but I
[1:17:22.840 --> 1:17:29.440]  want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two
[1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:35.360]  months products like beyond Tangy Tangerine pollen burst and rebound when
[1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:39.160]  I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day I lost more
[1:17:39.160 --> 1:17:44.280]  than 37 pounds in just two months now that's results I want to challenge my
[1:17:44.280 --> 1:17:49.480]  listeners to go to infowarstein.com and to order just three of their products
[1:17:49.480 --> 1:17:54.040]  and you will see the changes in the way you look feel and in your appetite

[1:21:35.080 --> 1:21:43.240]  algorithms you name it Dr. Roman young Pulaski is our guest and professor I
[1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:50.200]  don't know people can go to Louisville.edu and find you what's the best
[1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:54.520]  way for people to read your paper or to look at the important research you're
[1:21:54.520 --> 1:21:59.720]  doing a lot of my papers are available for free on the internet just search for
[1:21:59.720 --> 1:22:04.560]  my name you'll find lots of PDFs if you want to email me my address is posted on
[1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:09.960]  my website I'm happy to spend the paper to anyone interested well you're very
[1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:14.920]  gracious to spend time with us you know I've got a lot of questions I could ask
[1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:21.360]  but if you had 10 minutes to talk to 3 million people which you are what would
[1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:25.400]  you impart to them about why this is important and what would you say to
[1:22:25.400 --> 1:22:27.640]  government if they were listening because you better believe government's
[1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:31.240]  listening and corporations are listening I'm not tooting our horn but we have
[1:22:31.240 --> 1:22:36.680]  Sauron's attention here what would you say to the system about your research
[1:22:36.680 --> 1:22:40.600]  and your research that I see that is concurred with in a lot of other
[1:22:40.600 --> 1:22:45.320]  scholarly papers as well I would say it's very important to realize when I'm
[1:22:45.320 --> 1:22:49.000]  talking about science fiction this is not just Hollywood movies this is now
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:55.160]  reality those things will happen in the next 20 30 years most likely so we need
[1:22:55.160 --> 1:22:59.080]  to be fully prepared for them I personally proposed the number of ideas
[1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:03.520]  which can help reduce negative effects from those technologies for example
[1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:07.000]  just like when we deal with human cloning we have restrictions on the
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:12.120]  research we banned most of it similar restrictions should be in place for
[1:23:12.120 --> 1:23:16.440]  developing general artificial intelligence again I'm not talking about
[1:23:16.440 --> 1:23:22.680]  just assistive technologies but programs capable of completely dominating
[1:23:22.680 --> 1:23:29.040]  human intelligence in any domain I also proposed the main topic of my paper was
[1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:33.000]  on confining those technologies so especially in early stages of
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:38.680]  development then we're just trying to create those baby AI systems which are
[1:23:38.680 --> 1:23:42.440]  learning and growing it's important to have them restricted so we can study
[1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:48.240]  them properly so they cannot very quickly develop them to full-blown
[1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:51.640]  superintelligence systems and essentially escape them to the wild like
[1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:55.600]  happens with many computer viruses I don't know if I have 10 minutes
[1:23:55.600 --> 1:24:00.480]  to prepare something much better with questions no no no I bet I just I just
[1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:04.360]  want to hear what you have to say what about people like Ray Kurzwell and
[1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:08.200]  others when they just say throw up in our arms do whatever the AI says merge
[1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:12.520]  with it and then we'll just merge with it that right there is saying plug it
[1:24:12.520 --> 1:24:16.880]  directly into our brain all these new video game technologies I know you study
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:22.120]  and look at are already interfacing us with it we're already basically letting
[1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:28.440]  the use of calculators destroy arithmetic word processors destroying
[1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:33.240]  spelling I mean I see machines helping humans in many ways but also more and
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:37.760]  more turning people into basically jellyfish blobs who are in a trance
[1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:44.800]  state a different varying degrees of mass narcolepsy brainwaves are lowering
[1:24:44.800 --> 1:24:49.400]  people are in more of a dreamlike state that the television all of it I mean I
[1:24:49.400 --> 1:24:55.480]  already see just general primitive technology really causing problems in
[1:24:55.480 --> 1:25:00.440]  society and then you've got the problem of robotics replacing humans needs well
[1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:03.800]  then what are all the humans going to do and Bill Joy says well the elite are
[1:25:03.800 --> 1:25:07.640]  having discussions just about you know orderly getting rid of people there are
[1:25:07.640 --> 1:25:11.720]  a lot of other bioethics reports saying you know really do some draconian things
[1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:15.280]  to humanity so we're not just fighting with the machines we're fighting with
[1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:19.920]  the intelligentsia and the elite that see the general public as animals the
[1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:23.200]  general public are playing into that acting like animals I mean I this just
[1:25:23.200 --> 1:25:28.160]  all feeds together you are correct to point out that only a few people
[1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:32.080]  actually stating this debate right now casualist probably number one person
[1:25:32.080 --> 1:25:38.520]  who's known for promoting singularity for running singularity university there
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:42.040]  is really no public debate and one of the things that would love to see as a
[1:25:42.040 --> 1:25:45.600]  result of this interview is more awareness by the public of those issues
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:50.240]  where we do have on the next referendum not just questions for human
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:54.920]  cloning illegal but also questions about the intelligent technologies and how
[1:25:54.920 --> 1:25:59.960]  dangerous they can be here's an example at a truly artificially intelligent
[1:25:59.960 --> 1:26:06.840]  self-aware uncontained system in a matter of days could could could take over
[1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:10.760]  the entire global stock market and basically own most of the assets of the
[1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:16.440]  world there's an example or it could do the Terminator version and launch drone
[1:26:16.440 --> 1:26:21.520]  attacks with nuclear weapons or neutron bombs and kill the population or I mean
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:26.240]  it's just there's no telling what the what could happen out of this it's just
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:29.760]  it's just on I mean what are different scenarios for a machine takeover that
[1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:34.040]  you've researched you are right no one knows exactly what's gonna happen but
[1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:38.600]  scenarios range from complete extermination of humankind to sort of
[1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:43.400]  this technological communism I wish to say maybe we'll have robots doing all
[1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:48.680]  the labor creating a lot of wealth because if you can cheaply copy
[1:26:48.680 --> 1:26:52.800]  intelligence cheaply copy 20 years of education you really have a lot of
[1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:57.600]  opportunities for producing products much more affordably so it could go either
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:01.680]  way my hope is that we can develop technologies to control those systems
[1:27:01.680 --> 1:27:07.400]  and benefit from from them obviously technology has been huge in our
[1:27:07.400 --> 1:27:12.360]  successful immersion to the superpower it's important to continue being a
[1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:18.960]  superpower but we have to be very very careful and just how we get to that point
[1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:24.280]  well this is like Prometheus this is the fire of the gods and a lot of people
[1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:30.200]  think we're gonna become the gods or God and boy that is the famous famous last
[1:27:30.200 --> 1:27:35.120]  words but imagine the power of genetic engineering and nanotech fused with
[1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:40.000]  artificial intelligences we could just pretty much immediately have whole
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:44.840]  space fleets you name it mining operations the problem is it immediately
[1:27:44.840 --> 1:27:48.760]  cuts off humans I mean I see all these movies where humans are out exploring
[1:27:48.760 --> 1:27:53.640]  space you know it's all ready to the point where it's all gonna be robot it's
[1:27:53.640 --> 1:27:59.240]  all gonna be drone and so I mean I don't really see many paths where this
[1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:03.480]  doesn't actually shut us off and we get walled off by the computers if they're
[1:28:03.480 --> 1:28:08.440]  nice enough to keep us around you're right you mentioned Bill Joy he wrote an
[1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:12.520]  article saying does the future really need us and that's the big question if
[1:28:12.520 --> 1:28:18.520]  those technologies continue on a path they are if we are successful as it
[1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:23.680]  looks like we're gonna be then really the place of humanity is in question if
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:27.560]  you have machines thousands if not millions times more intelligent more
[1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:32.800]  capable then we do become pets for them I mean we might still have some control
[1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:37.480]  but it changes society in fundamental ways do you still need college
[1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:42.520]  education if you still can't compete with an intelligent machine do you still
[1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:48.560]  need the you know different personal improvements if machines can re-engineer
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:52.840]  your DNA and make you live longer healthy lives it really raises a lot of
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:28:57.600]  unanswered questions and I would love to see some national debate in us doctor I
[1:28:57.600 --> 1:29:01.160]  like to see some debate about that as well but I don't see the so-called
[1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:05.360]  elite acting like they're concerned about anything I mean that they're too
[1:29:05.360 --> 1:29:11.400]  into strutting around like peacocks and going to balls five nights a week and
[1:29:11.400 --> 1:29:16.000]  playing golf and more and more I realize that they're they're following some
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:21.600]  500 year old you know or older Byzantine model of corporate empire and
[1:29:21.600 --> 1:29:27.800]  don't understand that they've they're holding either our total empowerment in
[1:29:27.800 --> 1:29:33.960]  their hands or our total destruction and using my little super computer my
[1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:38.480]  brain it just it's I'm not trying to be pessimistic but my gut which is really
[1:29:38.480 --> 1:29:43.240]  just a subconscious analysis of all the factors tells me danger will Robinson
[1:29:43.240 --> 1:29:47.760]  well it's also possible that technology will be a great equalizer computers
[1:29:47.760 --> 1:29:52.640]  are now affordable to you and they benefit everyone not just the richest
[1:29:52.640 --> 1:29:56.600]  people most powerful people so some more things can happen with intelligent
[1:29:56.600 --> 1:30:04.760]  technology a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[1:30:04.760 --> 1:30:08.280]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my
[1:30:08.280 --> 1:30:12.640]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[1:30:12.640 --> 1:30:16.040]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[1:30:16.040 --> 1:30:20.680]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[1:30:20.680 --> 1:30:25.320]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[1:30:25.320 --> 1:30:30.080]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there
[1:30:30.080 --> 1:30:34.400]  and discovered young Jevity the young Jevity products are designed to give
[1:30:34.400 --> 1:30:38.680]  you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that you don't have to eat as
[1:30:38.680 --> 1:30:44.680]  much to be satisfied I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the
[1:30:44.680 --> 1:30:48.960]  vitamins and minerals I need check it out for yourself it's incredible go to

[1:30:53.680 --> 1:30:58.120]  tangerine complete multivitamin mineral complex dietary supplement that's
[1:30:58.120 --> 1:31:02.920]  info wars team calm this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[1:31:02.920 --> 1:31:07.240]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[1:31:07.240 --> 1:31:10.600]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[1:31:10.600 --> 1:31:14.520]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:31:14.520 --> 1:31:18.720]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[1:31:18.720 --> 1:31:23.160]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[1:31:23.160 --> 1:31:27.880]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:31:27.880 --> 1:31:31.680]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:31:31.680 --> 1:31:35.320]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:31:35.320 --> 1:31:39.640]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:31:39.640 --> 1:31:42.840]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[1:31:42.840 --> 1:31:46.480]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:08.000]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:15.400]  network network now you talk about in the development of these systems from
[1:34:15.400 --> 1:34:20.120]  your research we're gonna go to calls what type of current just hypothetically
[1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:24.960]  you know your class was asking you hypothetically doctor what do you think
[1:34:24.960 --> 1:34:30.560]  is the most likely form of a cascading effect with the computers that would lead
[1:34:30.560 --> 1:34:34.960]  to truly artificially intelligent and artificially aware and autonomous I
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:38.640]  would say automatically obviously this the already autonomous drones that
[1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:42.600]  they're now launching but is it video games is it gonna be human machine
[1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:46.840]  interfaces you know like they thought as you said 50 years ago with the chess
[1:34:46.840 --> 1:34:50.680]  and took a lot longer than they thought for big blue deep blue to start beating
[1:34:50.680 --> 1:34:54.280]  you know the best Russian chess champions or whatever human brain
[1:34:54.280 --> 1:34:58.800]  interfaces have a huge promise we already know how to read the individual
[1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:04.080]  ideas from your brain to spot individual words memories can be created by
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:09.200]  sending signals to appropriate parts of the brain so essentially by scanning a
[1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:14.000]  human brain and creating a simulation of it or integrating an additional module
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:17.880]  into a human brain you can create a super intelligent system essentially so
[1:35:17.880 --> 1:35:22.080]  that's probably something with a lot of promise but any one of the currently
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:27.440]  investigated technologies can turn out to be very promising now we know that in
[1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:31.680]  human and other animal development there are jump points it could be that
[1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:35.840]  technology is going to cause a human jump and that humans in competition with
[1:35:35.840 --> 1:35:40.160]  machines will actually open up a lot of capabilities that we haven't accessed
[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:45.280]  absolutely in fact that's what's already happening we don't have those
[1:35:45.280 --> 1:35:49.560]  technologies implanted in our brains but we're using them I can't think of myself
[1:35:49.560 --> 1:35:54.400]  functioning without access to internet it's like my external memory that I
[1:35:54.400 --> 1:35:58.400]  essentially you're already interfacing the biggest library in history and now
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:02.000]  it's always following us if you have a phone it's a smartphone that has
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:06.200]  internet that has access to all the information civilization ever produced
[1:36:06.200 --> 1:36:11.120]  you can control a lot of external devices you can do almost anything and
[1:36:11.120 --> 1:36:14.440]  the next step is to have those things implanted in us and the research is
[1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:19.520]  already taking place in hybrid systems like that what about the paradox though
[1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:23.600]  of authoritarian governments putting back doors into implanted devices which
[1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:26.360]  we know they always do with other devices to where you think you're getting a
[1:36:26.360 --> 1:36:30.080]  piece of machinery to get your vision back which who would want that or a you
[1:36:30.080 --> 1:36:34.560]  know liver whatever it is but really it's got piggyback things on it absolutely
[1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:39.920]  that's very likely in fact many cases have been shown where corporations put
[1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:44.720]  back doors and we don't really know what the federal government is doing also
[1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:49.440]  something you want to think about is if this superintelligent machine will be
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:55.240]  able to outsource all sorts of jobs the standard jobs why not the government
[1:36:55.240 --> 1:37:02.120]  itself I mean they can be said to be not bribeable they don't have to take
[1:37:02.120 --> 1:37:06.880]  vacations so maybe they would be the next level of our government legislative
[1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:11.080]  process we might be looking at artificial decision makers in Washington but
[1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:15.520]  then you'd have secret hacks and all sorts of deals and you know that's kind
[1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:18.400]  of what the zeitgeist movement pushes is this super computer that'll make all
[1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:22.960]  the decisions but man I tell you it is it is a brave new world we're entering
[1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:26.480]  let's go to some phone calls with the doctor I really appreciate spending time
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:31.800]  with us Henry in California you're first up go ahead hello I'm curious about the
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:36.560]  hardware and and if future machines and you know all AI would have to live on a
[1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:43.160]  machine if they're going to use spin transistors and spin tronics I have no
[1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:47.360]  idea what exactly they're going to use quantum computing is believed to be the
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:52.120]  next step more as low as coming to its logical conclusion that it comes to
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:56.320]  standard transistors there is a lot of research in developing the next paradigm
[1:37:56.320 --> 1:38:01.080]  to continue the Moore's law what exactly is going to be used in the next well
[1:38:01.080 --> 1:38:05.760]  isn't it really genetic computers that are that are life form human life or
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:10.120]  animal life based where they then program it into the genetics well there
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:14.320]  is the genetic programming and genetic algorithms they have not been terribly
[1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:18.800]  successful in creating truly intelligent systems they are very good at
[1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:23.840]  optimizing different parameters for functions so if you need to tweak
[1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:29.120]  arguments those are excellent but they have not been shown to be capable of
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:34.520]  sort of this evolutionary improvement from nothing to full-blown intelligence
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:41.600]  alright anything else Henry I'm curious about if it would ever involve a space
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:47.880]  segment especially with issues of relativistic timing if there is ever
[1:38:47.880 --> 1:38:53.000]  technology which allows us to use what physicists say is a possibility of time
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:56.840]  travel then there are some technologies some algorithms which
[1:38:56.840 --> 1:39:03.000]  incorporate this idea I recently seen a paper which shows how NP complete
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:06.760]  problems could be solved if you have access to a time travel device but this
[1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:11.840]  is really well beyond what my comfort zone is in terms of science versus science
[1:39:11.840 --> 1:39:14.800]  but they did just what they had a bunch of news tests come out where they have
[1:39:14.800 --> 1:39:20.960]  actually just like Star Trek beamed matter across distances teleported it
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:24.800]  teleportation they're now creating artificial black holes I think it's
[1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:27.880]  only a matter of time so they do something in a lab and kill everybody I
[1:39:27.880 --> 1:39:31.680]  just pray we don't destroy ourselves because folks we are getting the fire
[1:39:31.680 --> 1:39:35.800]  of Prometheus here this is this is not a joke thank you Henry really good
[1:39:35.800 --> 1:39:41.360]  questions let's go to who's up next here Woody in Washington you're on the air
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:46.480]  go ahead yeah hi yeah like thanks for taking my call my question for this
[1:39:46.480 --> 1:39:51.800]  gentleman is with this AI intelligence how far away are we from the point where
[1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:59.360]  all of these systems could be integrated worldwide with the military to where we
[1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:03.320]  end up with a scenario where it is like Terminator how much time does he
[1:40:03.320 --> 1:40:08.080]  estimate we have before that's a possibility that's a good question all
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:11.800]  the systems are already fully integrated the question of how soon before they
[1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:16.240]  become intelligent and as I said that's anywhere between 20 and 80 years
[1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:20.040]  depending on how conservative you want to be with yeah and I can add to that
[1:40:20.040 --> 1:40:24.400]  data with the data big data point the Pentagon within 10 years once all
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:28.720]  combat aircraft drone helicopters everything only transports will be human
[1:40:28.720 --> 1:40:33.440]  and those will be computer backup most the ground force within 10 years will
[1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:36.640]  be combat robots that's now been declassified and they've got a bunch of
[1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:39.040]  them that are really scary they haven't rolled out to the public because they
[1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:41.640]  don't want to freak people out yet but I've talked to high-level military and
[1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:46.720]  so you within 10 years the machines if they took over most the big militaries
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:51.760]  are going to be robot and drone so it is the Terminator scenario if they
[1:40:51.760 --> 1:40:55.600]  wanted to kill us that way a doctor did you want to make any other points on the
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:41:00.240]  gentleman talking about them the military you know being in a position to be
[1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:05.240]  taken over by AI I mean the numbers they admit is we're talking 10 years and
[1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:11.920]  almost everything is going to be drone or combat robot robot tanks all of it I
[1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:15.920]  mean that they don't need sleep they never stop they're worked on by robots
[1:41:15.920 --> 1:41:19.120]  that are delivered from you and robot ships they've got some technicians on
[1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:22.800]  board in case there's problems but that's what this is all going towards the
[1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:28.000]  total automation right in addition to the technology itself being dangerous there's
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:33.080]  also the possibility of human hackers taking over we saw you as the drone
[1:41:33.080 --> 1:41:39.800]  being taken over by Iranians if the same thing happens with the more capable
[1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:43.320]  controllers and they try to use the same technologies against us that could
[1:41:43.320 --> 1:41:49.440]  really backfire so there's quite a few scenarios we need to think about before
[1:41:49.440 --> 1:41:54.320]  developing and deploying those technologies I agree with you that this
[1:41:54.320 --> 1:42:00.120]  all needs to be basically heavily restricted immediately because the
[1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:04.920]  probability is it's going to cause disaster and I'm all for technological
[1:42:04.920 --> 1:42:08.440]  development and I know the system shuts down things that are disruptive to the
[1:42:08.440 --> 1:42:12.440]  economy that like you know freer forms of energy and things I don't think that
[1:42:12.440 --> 1:42:19.520]  should be restricted but AI systems super high-powered any matter weapons the
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:24.120]  Air Force admits they're developing all this type of stuff it just it just needs
[1:42:24.120 --> 1:42:28.000]  to be restricted well you talked about it modeling people's brains a lot of the
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.720]  most promising stuff for these interfaces that's why I'm saying you can
[1:42:30.720 --> 1:42:35.440]  actually get some human traits if the model it builds from its kernel or base
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:41.240]  is a human mind it could get some of the good traits of emotion or bad but that
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:45.960]  just again I'm not a computer scientist like you are I just if it's modeling off
[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:49.720]  humans and being programmed by the technocrats a lot of them are completely
[1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:52.600]  out of their minds I don't know what these things are going to be like it's a
[1:42:52.600 --> 1:42:56.760]  very good question and it's important to know whose brain I was scanning whose
[1:42:56.760 --> 1:43:00.680]  model are we creating to be that powerful so that's another unanswered
[1:43:00.680 --> 1:43:04.640]  question exactly if it was Mother Teresa or something I might not be a problem but
[1:43:04.640 --> 1:43:09.120]  what if it's some it still could be a problem great power corrupts absolutely
[1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:15.360]  so I won't trust any person to have that kind of capabilities I agree with you
[1:43:15.360 --> 1:43:20.040]  let's talk to Hector in New Jersey you're on the air Alex I just want to
[1:43:20.040 --> 1:43:23.880]  tell you about what our my professor revealed to us talking about the
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:28.560]  dimensions of a supercomputer that exists right now currently in Alaska which
[1:43:28.560 --> 1:43:33.320]  dovetails almost perfectly with what Nick Begich has been saying he said that
[1:43:33.320 --> 1:43:38.560]  it was the actual it was actually the size of the state of New Jersey and that
[1:43:38.560 --> 1:43:43.440]  it was aware of itself already existing right now in the current time it's the
[1:43:43.440 --> 1:43:48.840]  paradigm destroyer what do you mean a computer the size of New Jersey this
[1:43:48.840 --> 1:43:53.920]  man this professor went on to in his lecture revealed to all of us which most
[1:43:53.920 --> 1:43:57.880]  of them were acting like potted plants might be fellow students stay there I

[1:44:59.800 --> 1:45:05.400]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had
[1:45:05.400 --> 1:45:09.200]  a pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[1:45:09.200 --> 1:45:13.280]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[1:45:13.280 --> 1:45:16.760]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[1:45:16.760 --> 1:45:21.440]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:48.440]  loves Ron Paul and loves the Constitution congressman Walter Jones of the

[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:57.120]  re-air stuff on the Sunday show that I had on Friday but we got some stations
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:02.440]  that carry the Sunday show that don't carry the weekday show 11 to 2 central
[1:49:02.440 --> 1:49:07.840]  info wars.com XM channel 166 little plug there other different ways you can hear
[1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:12.720]  us this is powerful he's introduced legislation that of Obama or any other
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:16.800]  president starts launching wars under UN orders without congressional approval
[1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:22.120]  that violates article one section 8 clause 11 that we're gonna impeach his
[1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:32.400]  hand in so I give you Walter Jones district 3 congressman from North Carolina
[1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:37.960]  on my show Sunday sir thank you very much for joining us and introducing
[1:49:37.960 --> 1:49:43.480]  legislation to hold any president accountable if they tried to launch
[1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:46.440]  wars without congressional approval thank you for joining us well I like
[1:49:46.440 --> 1:49:50.800]  thank you that my concern goes back the initial concern was when President
[1:49:50.800 --> 1:49:55.280]  Clinton decided to bomb Bosnia without approval of Congress I joined 31
[1:49:55.280 --> 1:50:00.920]  members of the House three Democrats and 28 Republicans joined congressman at
[1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:05.880]  the time Tom Campbell who now is a constitutional law professor at Stanford
[1:50:05.880 --> 1:50:09.800]  University we went to the federal courts by saying that the president had
[1:50:09.800 --> 1:50:14.240]  bypassed Congress and the courts did not take the lawsuit because they said
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:18.600]  where you in Congress have the authority to cut the budgets and I mentioned
[1:50:18.600 --> 1:50:22.280]  that Alice because that's always difficult for members to cut the funding
[1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:26.240]  for war because they don't want to leave the kids over there without adequate
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:32.520]  equipment and then when mr. Obama went into Libya and a bypass Congress except
[1:50:32.520 --> 1:50:37.120]  he did say that he is spoken to the leadership well that group that made me
[1:50:37.120 --> 1:50:40.440]  even more anxious I joined Dennis Kucinich and Jonathan Turley is a
[1:50:40.440 --> 1:50:43.960]  constitutional lawyer at George Washington University we went back to the
[1:50:43.960 --> 1:50:49.520]  courts the courts did not accept by using the same position where you have
[1:50:49.520 --> 1:50:54.200]  the authority to cut the funding where that never happens I've been so anxious
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:51:01.000]  that and upset that we in Congress we never get a chance to debate the policy
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:06.160]  of should we still be in war or not in war so I decided to put this House
[1:51:06.160 --> 1:51:09.840]  concurrent resolution 107 in before even you about that
[1:51:09.840 --> 1:51:14.680]  can't secretary session excuse me senator sessions and Secretary of Defense
[1:51:14.680 --> 1:51:19.600]  Panetta and I would like to read two quotes that I think give so much
[1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:24.000]  credibility to what we're trying to do with this resolution one is from Vice
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:28.520]  President Dick Cheney when we went into Iraq which was an unnecessary war I
[1:51:28.520 --> 1:51:33.840]  came out against it and Secretary Vice President Cheney made this statement I
[1:51:33.840 --> 1:51:37.800]  want to read to your listeners the president does not need authorization
[1:51:37.800 --> 1:51:41.440]  from Congress before launching a military offensive that was Dick Cheney
[1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:46.040]  during the president George Bush administration now let me read to you
[1:51:46.040 --> 1:51:52.920]  a candidate of Senator Obama in 2007 and these are his words the president
[1:51:52.920 --> 1:51:57.360]  does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize
[1:51:57.360 --> 1:52:01.520]  the military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual
[1:52:01.520 --> 1:52:05.680]  immediate threat to the nation that's exactly what I'm saying with this
[1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:09.840]  resolution if we're attacked then the president does have the authority based
[1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:14.080]  on the Constitution but he does not have the constitutional power just to make
[1:52:14.080 --> 1:52:18.560]  a decision well I don't like the dictator in Libya so we're gonna go
[1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:22.360]  there and bomb him I mean that we need to go back to the Constitution and this
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:27.520]  will help Congress be more of involved into the faith when we go to war well
[1:52:27.520 --> 1:52:32.680]  said Congressman of course senator sessions said that he almost lost his
[1:52:32.680 --> 1:52:35.920]  breath whenever he kept saying the Panetta over and over again the
[1:52:35.920 --> 1:52:42.240]  Secretary of Defense last week sir you know Congress is over the war powers and
[1:52:42.240 --> 1:52:47.880]  you do need our authorization and Panetta would say no we get that from the UN so
[1:52:47.880 --> 1:52:52.840]  for me this is beyond the constitutional question of a president launching wars
[1:52:52.840 --> 1:52:55.440]  without congressional approval we know that's a high crime it's in the
[1:52:55.440 --> 1:52:59.320]  Constitution a five-year-old that can read can see that that's a no-brainer
[1:52:59.320 --> 1:53:03.040]  because why even have Congress if that's the case if the president can do it
[1:53:03.040 --> 1:53:06.300]  every once you've got to have checks and balances but to go further and say
[1:53:06.300 --> 1:53:10.640]  we're getting the authority from foreign governments in the UN I mean that's
[1:53:10.640 --> 1:53:15.840]  like being a foreign agent of a foreign power sir Alex it is not acceptable we
[1:53:15.840 --> 1:53:20.200]  have a Constitution like we have a Bible and the Constitution says that
[1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:25.160]  Congress will declare war that is why I've been so upset and I miss mentioned
[1:53:25.160 --> 1:53:28.440]  to you just a moment ago my history on this whole issue that went back to
[1:53:28.440 --> 1:53:35.320]  President Clinton in Bosnia in 1999 for too long Congress has been a spectator
[1:53:35.320 --> 1:53:40.280]  in the debate for war and when you see the amount of money that we spend and
[1:53:40.280 --> 1:53:44.000]  more important than the money the number of kids who had died and lost their
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:48.320]  legs their arms but the American people should get behind and I'm pleased to
[1:53:48.320 --> 1:53:52.760]  tell you today I was honored to be on your show that we have had calls since
[1:53:52.760 --> 1:53:58.880]  Friday of last week that we have heard from people in 49 different states who
[1:53:58.880 --> 1:54:02.920]  have called and said thank you Congressman Jones we want to help you get
[1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:06.920]  this resolution to the floor of the house and get this thing passed and I
[1:54:06.920 --> 1:54:10.880]  want to thank you again for this opportunity I want to thank you sir now
[1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:14.660]  he's already launched the Libya war last year in Congress said you got to get
[1:54:14.660 --> 1:54:19.400]  our approval by the way we're for it the majority said just just just come to us
[1:54:19.400 --> 1:54:22.840]  and Obama put that letter out as you know sir because I saw you speak about it
[1:54:22.840 --> 1:54:26.360]  at the time saying I don't need you I don't have to look at the constitutional
[1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:30.680]  question was a quote on TV but his letter said it I have the UN and I'm
[1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:34.920]  doing this for their credibility that's a quote so he's saying I'm stating and
[1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:39.520]  setting the precedent that the UN's the boss the Congress has been handing over
[1:54:39.520 --> 1:54:43.520]  its authority but still doesn't mean that it's legitimate so so and I'm not
[1:54:43.520 --> 1:54:47.080]  criticizing what you've done it's measured you know you're saying hey do it
[1:54:47.080 --> 1:54:50.560]  again or of another president does it period we're going to start impeachment
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:54.040]  but but what about something like Ron Paul wouldn't that be a good
[1:54:54.040 --> 1:54:59.200]  constitutional move but also a campaign move for say Ron Paul to try to introduce
[1:54:59.200 --> 1:55:03.880]  articles of impeachment for the Libya fiasco which they now admit has been a
[1:55:03.880 --> 1:55:09.920]  disaster and given al Qaeda footholds and areas of Libya well I have publicly
[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:14.840]  endorsed Ron Paul I am a big supporter Ron Paul's and I do agree with him totally
[1:55:14.840 --> 1:55:20.520]  you may mention of this we tried with what happened was our own Republican
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:27.960]  leadership Alex would not allow it even a me a weak resolution to condemn what the
[1:55:27.960 --> 1:55:31.720]  president had done in Libya he would be loud Republicans to bring it to the
[1:55:31.720 --> 1:55:34.920]  floor I was so disappointed in our leadership Republican leadership
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:39.400]  because they just set back and like I was saying a while ago they became
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:44.280]  spectators we have got the fight to defend the constitutional right of the
[1:55:44.280 --> 1:55:48.760]  Congress to declare war and this is a step in that direction we will get a
[1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:53.800]  hearing I hope I hope in the Judiciary Committee I know that the Judiciary
[1:55:53.800 --> 1:55:58.640]  Committee chaired by Congressman Lamar Smith from Texas who's a fine man in
[1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:03.520]  the ranking member who's a fine man John Conyas and we need to hold a hearing on
[1:56:03.520 --> 1:56:08.400]  this whole issue of Congress and war and this is a start this resolution isn't
[1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:13.920]  as a major step in that direction well said Congressman what can we do to help
[1:56:13.920 --> 1:56:19.040]  move this legislation through the House and get it passed if your listeners
[1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:22.560]  would call their members of the United States House representative and I hope
[1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:29.200]  soon we'll have a Senate Senator to it to introduce the same legislation but
[1:56:29.200 --> 1:56:33.880]  right now if your listeners would call their members of Congress and say please
[1:56:33.880 --> 1:56:40.520]  cosponsor each time resolution 107 all they have to do is to call their member
[1:56:40.520 --> 1:56:45.240]  of Congress or email them or or fax them and just say please join in this
[1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:50.320]  House effort to bring back the constitutional authority of Congress to
[1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:55.160]  be involved when it comes to debating war and that's what they need to do and
[1:56:55.160 --> 1:56:58.880]  I can honestly tell you we had a person yesterday I was in the Greenville office
[1:56:58.880 --> 1:57:02.640]  Greenville North Carolina and a gentleman called from Colorado and said
[1:57:02.640 --> 1:57:06.320]  what can I do to help Congress and Jones with this H. Con reps is correct
[1:57:06.320 --> 1:57:12.000]  resolution excuse me 107 and and we told him just called the your member of
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:16.760]  Congress asked him to join called the J committee in Washington DC and say this
[1:57:16.760 --> 1:57:22.800]  is a constitutional debate that needs to start and H. Con resolution 107 will
[1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:28.040]  start the debate again we're talking to Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina
[1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:31.080]  and I'm glad people are calling and thanking him but I think what's more
[1:57:31.080 --> 1:57:36.000]  important is to call the head of the Judiciary Committee to ask them to get
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:40.360]  behind it and start promoting it to call the media and say don't black this out
[1:57:40.360 --> 1:57:44.800]  and to call people like Senator Rand Paul and say look you've talked a lot
[1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:49.120]  about this war power issue your father has you need to co-sponsor this
[1:57:49.120 --> 1:57:53.280]  immediately in the Senate I would imagine that Senator DeMint would want
[1:57:53.280 --> 1:57:57.440]  to get behind this I would imagine that Senator Sessions who was so flabbergasted
[1:57:57.440 --> 1:58:01.640]  congressman would want to get behind this right now well I'm gonna reach out
[1:58:01.640 --> 1:58:05.920]  to him Monday we will be back in Washington I've already asked my staff to
[1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:10.720]  call his office to see if he could give me 10 minutes by telephone I think he
[1:58:10.720 --> 1:58:14.840]  will see the value of trying to introduce us on the Senate side and
[1:58:14.840 --> 1:58:19.520]  let's debate this issue it is time for Congress to get out of the stands and get
[1:58:19.520 --> 1:58:23.600]  on the field when we talk about sending our young men and women to die
