[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:15.059]  Most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.242]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Youngevity.
[00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:26.766]  The Youngevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you
[00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.388]  You don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:00:29.388 --> 00:00:35.692]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:36.972]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:00:36.972 --> 00:00:37.853]  It's incredible.
[00:00:37.853 --> 00:00:47.059]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.940]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.251]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:00:55.251 --> 00:01:07.594]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio.
[00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:11.516]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:19.558]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:01:19.558 --> 00:01:20.898]  Yes sir!
[00:01:20.898 --> 00:01:22.159]  We are here!
[00:01:23.502 --> 00:01:30.328]  And I want to thank you for joining us on this Sunday worldwide transmission.
[00:01:30.328 --> 00:01:35.231]  The 18th day of March 2012.
[00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:38.614]  And we've got quite a transmission lined up for you today.
[00:01:38.614 --> 00:01:41.637]  Some of it is going to be fresh and a premiere broadcast.
[00:01:41.637 --> 00:01:47.982]  Other parts are going to be some of the interviews I did during the week that are just so bombshell and need to be heard again.
[00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:51.404]  You know, some stations that carry the Sunday show
[00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:54.612]  Only carry the Sunday show.
[00:01:54.612 --> 00:02:01.976]  In fact, there's 35 or so or 36 that only carry the Sunday show.
[00:02:01.976 --> 00:02:07.660]  There's another few dozen that are carrying Sunday as well, but that also carry the weekdays.
[00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:27.132]  So it's important that we have a Bob Barr on, former congressman, who's now suing the TSA over secret intelligence list with my name and Matt Drudge's name reportedly on them, dealing with basically demonizing the American people who are protesting what the TSA is doing.
[00:02:27.132 --> 00:02:28.392]  It's very, very important.
[00:02:28.392 --> 00:02:31.814]  So we're going to re-air that coming up later.
[00:02:34.597 --> 00:02:45.967]  The big interview we did in the second hour, we're going to air that, with Walter Jones, the congressman who's trying to impeach Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:51.312]  And for that matter, any other president, his bill says, that tries to launch wars without congressional approval.
[00:02:51.312 --> 00:02:52.774]  That is coming up.
[00:02:52.774 --> 00:03:00.701]  But then I'm going to air something, it's a virgin mission here on the transmission, called Government Explained.
[00:03:02.458 --> 00:03:02.678]  That
[00:03:19.568 --> 00:03:21.029]  It had broken while I was on the air.
[00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:23.310]  I didn't see it until I'd gotten off air.
[00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.630]  Here's the headline.
[00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.731]  It's in the San Francisco Chronicle Associated Press.
[00:03:26.731 --> 00:03:27.991]  You name it, it's a big story.
[00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:34.174]  Man behind Kony 2012 arrested for masturbating in public, vandalizing cars, and other things.
[00:03:35.384 --> 00:03:38.685]  That we won't mention here on Air with the Family Show.
[00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:42.266]  Reportedly running around in his underwear doing this in full public.
[00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:44.206]  And have you seen this fruit box?
[00:03:44.206 --> 00:03:48.848]  He's the one dancing around like, oh my gosh, Connie!
[00:03:48.848 --> 00:03:50.568]  It's that guy.
[00:03:50.568 --> 00:03:56.530]  So, the reason I've gone after this Connie thing is it's Soros connected, Globalist connected, full invasion of Africa.
[00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.151]  And look, I'm not immoral, but if I was, I'd be like, hey,
[00:04:00.891 --> 00:04:02.872]  You're going to use my tax money to invade Africa?
[00:04:02.872 --> 00:04:06.354]  I better get some of the booty, some of the loot, some of the goods.
[00:04:06.354 --> 00:04:07.415]  We're not even getting that.
[00:04:07.415 --> 00:04:12.578]  We're paying for it, getting the hatred worldwide, getting blamed for this.
[00:04:12.578 --> 00:04:16.441]  It's sick, so it's time that that stopped.
[00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:21.324]  But Jason Russell, 33, was arrested Thursday morning by the San Diego Police Department.
[00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:36.706]  This got covered up for a day in Southern California and the earliest reports to tell the incident suggest it was one hell of a day for the already well-known Invisible Children co-founder and proclaimed mastermind of the Kony 2012 viral video.
[00:04:36.706 --> 00:04:43.034]  Police say he was in his underwear, running around, masturbating in public and vandalizing cars and I'll just stop there.
[00:04:43.034 --> 00:04:43.314]  Again,
[00:04:44.355 --> 00:04:46.775]  I watch these videos, and I'm like, what is this?
[00:04:46.775 --> 00:04:53.557]  A guy prancing around with a bunch of people talking to adults with their children going, let's get behind the invasion for coming!
[00:04:53.557 --> 00:04:55.317]  Let's get it!
[00:04:55.317 --> 00:04:58.137]  And then suddenly, oh, let's invade Sudan!
[00:04:58.137 --> 00:05:04.238]  We're hearing from George Clooney and getting arrested in staged events at the embassy in D.C.
[00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:06.939]  I mean, it's all a rollout for war.
[00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.479]  Like Angelina Jolie, the U.N.
[00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.400]  envoy, calling for war against
[00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:16.802]  Well, against Syria now, but also Libya.
[00:05:16.802 --> 00:05:17.863]  It's all disgusting.
[00:05:17.863 --> 00:05:19.844]  And we've got other big news coming up as well.
[00:05:19.844 --> 00:05:20.064]  U.S.
[00:05:20.064 --> 00:05:24.828]  sends four anti-mine ships straight to Hormuz ships with a clear waterway.
[00:05:24.828 --> 00:05:28.930]  If Iran tries to block strategic oil chokepoint, the war could be on.
[00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:29.851]  They admit it could be on.
[00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:32.372]  So we're going to be looking at that.
[00:05:32.372 --> 00:05:35.293]  Also, another report on the Wall Street Journal.
[00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:40.495]  Hey, you don't like the TSA going in your pants and groping the family jewels?
[00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:42.895]  $100 to fly through the airport.
[00:05:42.895 --> 00:05:44.856]  Hate the full-body scans, Wall Street Journal says.
[00:05:44.856 --> 00:05:49.298]  Pat-downs and slow-going at TSA airport screening checkpoints for $100.
[00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:52.459]  You can now bypass the hassle.
[00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:54.280]  They were always forcing you into that.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.220]  We'll be back.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.961]  Big transmission lined up.
[00:05:56.961 --> 00:05:57.501]  Stay with us.
[00:06:00.467 --> 00:06:07.690]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:25.579]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:29.681]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:31.742]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:06:31.742 --> 00:06:39.888]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:06:39.888 --> 00:06:46.212]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:06:46.212 --> 00:06:47.493]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:06:47.493 --> 00:06:48.373]  It's incredible.
[00:06:48.373 --> 00:06:57.580]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.421]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:07:03.463 --> 00:07:17.128]  All right, former Congressman Bob Barr, who's also been the Libertarian presidential nominee a few years back, is our guest, and I have wanted to get him on the show.
[00:07:19.065 --> 00:07:28.815]  So we can get some updates on what his Liberty Guard group is doing with its four-year request lawsuits with the TSA.
[00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:30.937]  You know, now South Park last night had their episode.
[00:07:30.937 --> 00:07:32.058]  I actually watched it this morning.
[00:07:32.058 --> 00:07:37.603]  I don't normally watch it, but not too much into the potty humor, but they made a good point here.
[00:07:37.603 --> 00:07:39.145]  They were calling it the
[00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:41.947]  Well, I'll get into it later.
[00:07:41.947 --> 00:07:47.809]  The point is, across cultural lines, everybody is sick of the TSA.
[00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:57.993]  It is the big issue, like nothing I've ever seen, that has unified Americans along political lines, religious lines, racial, regional.
[00:07:57.993 --> 00:08:04.035]  Everyone I know, and I've seen the polls, it's 90 plus percent, cannot stand what the TSA is doing.
[00:08:04.035 --> 00:08:08.437]  There's some conformist out there who on the news will say, oh, I don't like it, but it's needed.
[00:08:09.983 --> 00:08:11.604]  No, it's not.
[00:08:11.604 --> 00:08:12.605]  I cannot fly.
[00:08:12.605 --> 00:08:18.229]  I cannot subject my children to what top psychologists have said is pedophilia training.
[00:08:18.229 --> 00:08:22.813]  To have strangers grabbing and groping your children, including their genitals.
[00:08:22.813 --> 00:08:26.876]  They got caught groping old women, strip-searching them, they lied about that.
[00:08:26.876 --> 00:08:30.879]  And then got caught, they lied about the radiation strength of the scanners.
[00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:34.001]  And Bob Barr has been all over this.
[00:08:34.001 --> 00:08:35.502]  Of course, Bob Barr
[00:08:37.173 --> 00:08:40.777]  Also is involved in a lot of other areas trying to defend liberties.
[00:08:40.777 --> 00:08:43.099]  And I want to discuss some of those with him as well.
[00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:45.041]  But please, sir, give us the latest.
[00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:52.128]  And thank you for joining us on what's happening in your investigation and sparring with the TSA.
[00:08:53.168 --> 00:08:54.409]  Thanks very much, Alex.
[00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:58.732]  It's great to be back with you and your many, many listeners once again.
[00:08:58.732 --> 00:09:12.701]  By the way, just as a sidelight on TSA, about a week ago I was traveling at a certain airport and I showed the TSA person my congressional ID.
[00:09:12.701 --> 00:09:15.023]  As a former member of Congress, I have an official
[00:09:15.503 --> 00:09:19.224]  It's an official government ID that identifies me as a former member of Congress.
[00:09:19.224 --> 00:09:20.924]  It has an official government seal.
[00:09:20.924 --> 00:09:23.425]  It says right on the face of it that it's U.S.
[00:09:23.425 --> 00:09:25.326]  government identification.
[00:09:25.326 --> 00:09:28.486]  It has my name and so forth.
[00:09:28.486 --> 00:09:32.667]  And the guard looked at it and he said, I can't accept this.
[00:09:32.667 --> 00:09:34.228]  Do you have the driver's license?
[00:09:34.228 --> 00:09:36.828]  And I said, yes, but that's an official government ID.
[00:09:36.828 --> 00:09:41.050]  It certainly is good for purposes of getting on an airplane.
[00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.430]  Well, wait over here.
[00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.693]  So he puts me aside and calls over a supervisor.
[00:09:47.693 --> 00:10:04.484]  And the supervisor, a gentleman probably about 50 years old, he looks at it, studies it under one of their little flashlight things that they think are so impressive, shines a light on it, and says, I'm going to have to look this up.
[00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.067]  And I said, well, fine.
[00:10:06.067 --> 00:10:07.448]  It's fine with me.
[00:10:07.448 --> 00:10:12.191]  And then the other guy pipes up and says, this guy refused to show me a driver's license.
[00:10:12.191 --> 00:10:13.552]  I said, I didn't refuse anything.
[00:10:13.552 --> 00:10:17.835]  I just indicated to you that this was an official government ID.
[00:10:17.835 --> 00:10:28.402]  So the guy, the other guy, then literally takes about five minutes to thumb through a couple of little books that they have with various forms of identification.
[00:10:28.402 --> 00:10:30.023]  He says, it's not in here.
[00:10:30.023 --> 00:10:31.063]  I've never seen it before.
[00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:33.305]  And I said, well, it doesn't matter whether you've seen it before.
[00:10:33.305 --> 00:10:34.486]  It's an official government ID.
[00:10:36.327 --> 00:10:37.908]  But it's not in my book.
[00:10:37.908 --> 00:10:39.470]  I said, well, that's fine.
[00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.673]  It's still an official government ID.
[00:10:43.673 --> 00:10:49.498]  This is sort of typical, Alex, of the problems that are magnified
[00:10:50.367 --> 00:10:54.650]  Tens of thousands of times daily across the country.
[00:10:54.650 --> 00:11:05.718]  Just a minor problem, but the more serious problems are the ones that you just mentioned, and that our organization, Liberty Guard, is fighting.
[00:11:05.718 --> 00:11:10.281]  We began this battle with TSA back in November of 2010.
[00:11:10.281 --> 00:11:16.385]  You recall, of course, that's when they started really hassling people.
[00:11:18.286 --> 00:11:38.292]  We began and started issuing cards to people, we being Liberty Guard, the Opt Out Alliance, informing people, giving them a little card if they wrote in or emailed in to LibertyGuard.org, and we sent them a card, an Opt Out Alliance card that explained their rights.
[00:11:38.292 --> 00:11:44.633]  If they wanted, that they have a right to opt out of one of these naked body scanners, they have a right to have a
[00:11:46.974 --> 00:11:51.478]  Private Frisk Dunn and so forth.
[00:11:51.478 --> 00:12:00.626]  And I don't agree with any of that, but the point is that if you don't want to go through one of these naked body scanners, you do have the right to opt out.
[00:12:00.626 --> 00:12:02.388]  And then you have certain rights there under.
[00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:20.789]  Well, and almost immediately after there was this big flap, and a number of folks were calling for an opt-out day, all of a sudden, right before Thanksgiving of 2010, the TSA backed away and didn't use the machines.
[00:12:21.463 --> 00:12:36.802]  Well, we thought this was mighty interesting that they make this big push, they say these machines are absolutely essential and air travel safety will be severely compromised if not and so forth, and then all of a sudden they don't do it when they're faced with a public backlash.
[00:12:37.569 --> 00:12:40.031]  Well, of course, we couldn't get any information out of them.
[00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:48.576]  We filed a Freedom of Information Act request, and they denied them, said, oh, this isn't covered, we can't give this to you, it's sensitive information, and so forth.
[00:12:48.576 --> 00:12:57.541]  Anyway, we had this running paperwork battle with them for quite some time, and finally we decided, the Liberty Guard, the only way to really get to the bottom of this is to file suit.
[00:12:57.541 --> 00:13:00.463]  So we have filed suit in U.S.
[00:13:00.463 --> 00:13:01.964]  court in Virginia.
[00:13:02.484 --> 00:13:24.248]  Against TSA simply seeking access to the information that led them to both first Say that these machines are essential and then all of a sudden they back away from it and we want to see the documents And that's the that's the status of our of our lawsuit right now Liberty Guard versus the the TSA
[00:13:25.017 --> 00:13:31.645]  Now I want to give out websites and other contacts for folks that want to get the card because people say, well, what's the point of it?
[00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:33.146]  It creates a form of unity.
[00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.269]  It points out that we know we have our rights.
[00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:38.833]  It starts to create a lobby for liberty.
[00:13:38.833 --> 00:13:40.275]  And that's what we have to do is get together.
[00:13:40.275 --> 00:13:43.538]  And it also lets them know as they see these cards more and more.
[00:13:44.588 --> 00:13:46.992]  That there's a solidarity, obviously, Congressman.
[00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:51.501]  You know that, but I'm just pointing it out for some new listeners that are saying, what's the point of this?
[00:13:51.501 --> 00:13:56.329]  Do you agree with me that this is probably the biggest unifying issue that we've seen in a decade?
[00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:24.711]  It is, I think, Alex, because it affects so many people and the measures that the TSA are taking are so intrusive and so arbitrary that they really touch the heart and soul of what it means to be an American, to not have to subject yourself to the humiliation, the absolute humiliation of having the government be able to take a public, a nude photograph of you in public
[00:14:25.511 --> 00:14:25.691]  Sure.
[00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:50.139]  Sure.
[00:14:50.139 --> 00:15:03.149]  I mean, if you saw somebody run out of a liquor store after a robbery, you catch them down the street, they look like they shove a gun down their pants.
[00:15:03.149 --> 00:15:06.351]  Well, for your safety, as a police officer, you tackle them, you get the gun.
[00:15:06.351 --> 00:15:09.894]  But you don't just march little kids up and everybody's guilty until proven innocent.
[00:15:09.894 --> 00:15:10.755]  In fact, you're a lawyer.
[00:15:11.135 --> 00:15:18.965]  You've been in the CIA, you've been in international delegations, you've sat on key committees in Congress, so you're a leading expert on these issues.
[00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:26.393]  So let me ask you this, just as a layman, I'm not a lawyer, I'm not all these things, but just as a person who studied the common law and Bill of Rights Constitution,
[00:15:27.782 --> 00:15:32.886]  Read what the Founding Fathers wrote, read a few court cases, had a lot of lawyers on, constitutional lawyers.
[00:15:32.886 --> 00:15:43.493]  I mean, if the FBI can't randomly go to a park and start rubbing the outside of your pants or, God forbid, going inside, as they're now doing, the state police can't do it.
[00:15:43.493 --> 00:15:47.897]  So how do the feds create a group that aren't even sworn bonded officers?
[00:15:47.897 --> 00:15:49.538]  There's no discussion of jurisdiction.
[00:15:49.538 --> 00:15:52.740]  And now I've confirmed they're on highway searching cars.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.521]  They're in Dallas.
[00:15:54.541 --> 00:16:20.352]  They they now have army personnel with TSA you can just search TSA inspector and you'll see photos online of National Guard out at a you know Bay Fest in in Alabama and there's there's National Guard with guys that say TSA inspector searching little kids bags just randomly not even going into a sports stadium but entering downtown I mean it's to me it's nothing but acclimation but how
[00:16:21.252 --> 00:16:22.152]  How do they do this?
[00:16:22.152 --> 00:16:23.272]  I mean, where's the 10th Amendment?
[00:16:23.272 --> 00:16:24.453]  Where's the 4th?
[00:16:24.453 --> 00:16:26.013]  Where is the due process?
[00:16:26.013 --> 00:16:33.194]  I mean, Texas, as you know, tried to pass a law, and I want you to speak to this, last year, unanimously passed the House.
[00:16:33.194 --> 00:16:39.896]  The feds threatened a blockade of the airways, so the Senate backs off.
[00:16:39.896 --> 00:16:42.996]  But how do they do this?
[00:16:42.996 --> 00:16:46.637]  How are they engaging in this type of activity?
[00:16:48.209 --> 00:16:50.573]  That is the fundamental question, Alex.
[00:16:50.573 --> 00:16:53.377]  You pose it over and over again.
[00:16:53.377 --> 00:16:58.625]  And the answer to it is they can do this because we, the American people, let them do it.
[00:17:00.455 --> 00:17:04.998]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:17:04.998 --> 00:17:05.918]  Number one.
[00:17:05.918 --> 00:17:09.341]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:17:09.341 --> 00:17:10.201]  Number two.
[00:17:10.201 --> 00:17:15.084]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:17:15.084 --> 00:17:15.825]  It's true.
[00:17:15.825 --> 00:17:20.708]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:17:20.708 --> 00:17:21.528]  Number three.
[00:17:21.528 --> 00:17:25.111]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:17:25.111 --> 00:17:28.813]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:17:29.013 --> 00:17:29.814]  Number 4.
[00:17:29.814 --> 00:17:32.577]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:17:32.577 --> 00:17:36.261]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:17:36.261 --> 00:17:37.042]  Number 5.
[00:17:37.042 --> 00:17:41.206]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:17:41.206 --> 00:17:46.252]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:17:46.252 --> 00:17:50.216]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:20:26.473 --> 00:20:34.477]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:20:34.477 --> 00:20:39.700]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:04.948]  Direct from Austin.
[00:21:04.948 --> 00:21:08.149]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:21:24.093 --> 00:21:29.136]  Being totally passive and being a huge jellyfish slacker who looks like a fried egg in a chair.
[00:21:29.136 --> 00:21:31.477]  That is the culture of this, okay?
[00:21:31.477 --> 00:21:33.578]  The worship of being destroyed.
[00:21:33.578 --> 00:21:36.379]  Literally, I've now discovered the secrets of it.
[00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:37.480]  And it's a cult everywhere.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.480]  It's South by Southwest.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.002]  They're just hordes of these people.
[00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:44.944]  They look like adults in diapers or something, just toddling along.
[00:21:44.944 --> 00:21:49.906]  I mean, spiritually, it's a side issue.
[00:21:49.906 --> 00:21:52.307]  It's incredibly evil, though.
[00:21:52.307 --> 00:21:52.507]  Again,
[00:21:56.545 --> 00:21:58.792]  If you're a radio listener, in fact, what's the title of it?
[00:21:58.792 --> 00:21:59.173]  I forget.
[00:21:59.173 --> 00:22:00.837]  Something like, have a county 2012 screening?
[00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:04.242]  Book a screening for Connie 2012.
[00:22:04.242 --> 00:22:06.024]  It's on YouTube.
[00:22:06.024 --> 00:22:08.867]  And if you're a radio listener, you'll just hear the voices.
[00:22:08.867 --> 00:22:18.816]  But if you're a TV viewer at PrisonPlanet.TV, they actually jump up and down and go, oh my gosh, so trendy.
[00:22:18.816 --> 00:22:21.679]  And we're gonna get Connie, gonna get Connie.
[00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:23.220]  And you can tell they're government operatives.
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.402]  They've got like evil in their eyes, you know, hardcore.
[00:22:25.402 --> 00:22:26.443]  I mean, their real spirit is.
[00:22:27.564 --> 00:22:34.708]  And just cutting this room full of, you know, the trendies all swarming around like piranhas.
[00:22:45.014 --> 00:22:47.915]  But again, it's that cover of the Armored Warmock.
[00:22:47.915 --> 00:22:52.295]  It has this cover of, I'm friendly, I'm nice.
[00:22:52.295 --> 00:23:04.797]  And it's going after the young people who are in a narcoleptic state, are attracted like Maws the Flame to someone going, war, trendy, invade, help the children.
[00:23:04.797 --> 00:23:10.538]  And I'm like, that's where I'm watching more of their videos and it gets worse.
[00:23:10.538 --> 00:23:12.779]  I'm not joking, folks.
[00:23:15.598 --> 00:23:21.224]  I mean, and everyone's wearing like pink and little green, non-threatening, you know, colors.
[00:23:21.224 --> 00:23:23.386]  And this is what we face.
[00:23:23.386 --> 00:23:26.149]  So this is for college students.
[00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:30.874]  And this is what college, this is what men look like now, on average.
[00:23:30.874 --> 00:23:36.039]  In fact, now I used to bash men that are all into being big and muscular with tattoos and black on.
[00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:36.980]  Now I get it.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.542]  You don't want to be like these people.
[00:23:39.557 --> 00:23:41.879]  Okay, I used to get mad at guys trying to act tough.
[00:23:41.879 --> 00:23:42.840]  No, no, that's good.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.041]  Do that.
[00:23:44.041 --> 00:23:51.767]  In fact, I think I'm going to just go all out with cut off sleeves and drive a big fast car and be like, because I mean, I'm starting to get it.
[00:23:51.767 --> 00:23:55.850]  Men are running to that because they see the armies at South by Southwest.
[00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:56.791]  You go down there.
[00:23:56.791 --> 00:23:59.753]  It's literally men and pastels.
[00:23:59.753 --> 00:24:05.197]  And part of the effeminate thing is they have these little wispy beards and like bandanas and they're all walking around bending their wrists.
[00:24:05.197 --> 00:24:07.939]  I mean, I don't know what it is.
[00:24:09.795 --> 00:24:11.977]  No, there's men everywhere wearing dresses, I'm telling you.
[00:24:11.977 --> 00:24:15.179]  It's like, they're just like, New Orleans slaughter me, please!
[00:24:15.179 --> 00:24:19.502]  And the New Orleans like, act like a jellyfish coward and giggle at all reality.
[00:24:19.502 --> 00:24:21.803]  They're like, yes, yes!
[00:24:21.803 --> 00:24:22.164]  Anyways.
[00:24:22.164 --> 00:24:31.190]  Anyways, but the controller level ones are just like, know what they're doing.
[00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:35.173]  All right, let's, again, if you can't see the video as a radio listener, it doesn't have the same effect.
[00:24:35.173 --> 00:24:35.793]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:24:43.638 --> 00:24:50.445]  Ladies and gentlemen and babies of 2012, I don't know if you've heard, but this is the year, this war has to come to an end.
[00:24:50.445 --> 00:24:56.812]  You're watching this because you've heard of Kony and you're wondering what you can do to help finally bring this war to an end.
[00:24:56.812 --> 00:24:57.793]  Oh my gosh!
[00:24:57.793 --> 00:24:58.654]  Oh my gosh!
[00:24:58.654 --> 00:24:58.974]  1,500 screenings.
[00:24:58.974 --> 00:24:58.994]  0-0.
[00:25:03.619 --> 00:25:04.500]  Sure, do the rest.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.120]  Oh, look at him!
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:05.400]  Oh, ah!
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.861]  Now watch, right here.
[00:25:06.861 --> 00:25:08.363]  He starts hopping around.
[00:25:25.875 --> 00:25:29.019]  We have been working around the clock to bring you a movie.
[00:25:29.019 --> 00:25:30.380]  It's a short movie.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.124]  You're a place of worship, in your classroom, at your work.
[00:25:34.124 --> 00:25:34.424]  It'll be 7-11.
[00:25:34.424 --> 00:25:35.405]  It'll be live from the moon.
[00:25:35.405 --> 00:25:35.565]  619-562-2700.
[00:25:35.565 --> 00:25:36.046]  Here he goes.
[00:25:36.046 --> 00:25:37.767]  He does the hopping dance.
[00:25:37.767 --> 00:25:37.807]  619-562-2700.
[00:25:48.246 --> 00:25:49.047]  Oh yeah!
[00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:51.130]  I mean, this is for adults!
[00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.231]  This is Sesame Street!
[00:25:52.231 --> 00:25:53.493]  That's an ad product placement.
[00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:04.287]  We're going to meet some of them.
[00:26:04.287 --> 00:26:08.112]  What would motivate you to actually pick up the phone and book a screening?
[00:26:08.112 --> 00:26:11.135]  It's so easy to talk to us.
[00:26:11.135 --> 00:26:11.776]  Oh my gosh!
[00:26:11.776 --> 00:26:12.557]  It's so easy!
[00:26:12.557 --> 00:26:15.320]  We're going to launch a huge wall!
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:15.981]  Oh my gosh!
[00:26:15.981 --> 00:26:17.463]  African white carnage!
[00:26:17.463 --> 00:26:17.823]  Hello!
[00:26:20.774 --> 00:26:24.579]  It's literally the best piece of propaganda we've ever made.
[00:26:24.579 --> 00:26:26.001]  Oh, it's propaganda!
[00:26:38.275 --> 00:26:41.476]  Because we've got the State Department and all the stars behind us!
[00:26:41.476 --> 00:26:43.857]  And Angelina Jolie!
[00:26:43.857 --> 00:26:45.437]  In charge of Clinton-y!
[00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:46.238]  You are the future.
[00:26:46.238 --> 00:26:47.518]  Step into it, okay?
[00:26:47.518 --> 00:26:48.559]  Step into it.
[00:26:48.559 --> 00:26:49.199]  Peace!
[00:26:49.199 --> 00:26:50.019]  Step into it!
[00:26:50.019 --> 00:26:51.479]  Let me mind control you!
[00:26:51.479 --> 00:26:53.860]  Let me do some effeminate stuff now!
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:54.781]  Oh my gosh!
[00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:55.561]  Oh my gosh!
[00:26:56.274 --> 00:27:00.015]  The Pentagon's like, how do we get the jellyfish into total war?
[00:27:00.015 --> 00:27:01.655]  Dance around and prance.
[00:27:01.655 --> 00:27:06.716]  You can see black ops guys are just sitting back, cold-blooded, this will work well on them, good.
[00:27:06.716 --> 00:27:09.257]  Increase dosages in water immediately.
[00:27:09.257 --> 00:27:12.077]  Send out trendies to destroy them.
[00:27:12.077 --> 00:27:14.598]  There's nothing, I mean, there's nothing the trendies won't buy.
[00:27:14.598 --> 00:27:17.138]  My gosh, help me.
[00:27:17.138 --> 00:27:20.419]  Folks, if you couldn't see this, I mean, this was prancing.
[00:27:20.419 --> 00:27:21.659]  Was it as bad as I said, guys?
[00:27:22.841 --> 00:27:23.721]  It was worse.
[00:27:23.721 --> 00:27:29.503]  And now listen, Nemo just ran in here with stacks of articles.
[00:27:29.503 --> 00:27:36.666]  NATO, Australia, England, France, NORTHCOM troops are being dispatched for AFRICOM.
[00:27:36.666 --> 00:27:38.847]  The invasion of Africa is beginning.
[00:27:39.904 --> 00:27:41.805]  Has nothing to do with counting.
[00:27:41.805 --> 00:27:46.347]  It's about seizing land, fighting indigenous groups that are being forced off.
[00:27:46.347 --> 00:27:49.588]  Cuz it's all in the news, the UN's just in there gunning people down.
[00:27:49.588 --> 00:27:54.950]  But again, they've got guys prancing around going, liberal, and Angelina Jolie going, children.
[00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.651]  And again, that's the cover.
[00:27:56.651 --> 00:28:01.633]  Imagine the tank ramming the branch of Indians going, this is not an assault, please come out, we are your friends.
[00:28:01.633 --> 00:28:03.253]  They come out, they shoot them.
[00:28:03.253 --> 00:28:03.934]  It's the same thing.
[00:28:04.654 --> 00:28:11.119]  I mean, imagine a military that first deploys people hopping around in pink shirts saying, it's a perfect deal.
[00:28:11.119 --> 00:28:14.042]  Like, oh, this isn't non-threatening.
[00:28:14.042 --> 00:28:15.743]  That's just like one of those fish.
[00:28:15.743 --> 00:28:18.986]  Guys, pull up the lantern fish.
[00:28:18.986 --> 00:28:21.108]  It's at 2,000 feet and deeper.
[00:28:21.108 --> 00:28:24.731]  And it has that little lamp that looks like a tasty.
[00:28:24.731 --> 00:28:27.833]  No, a lamprey is one that attaches and is parasitic.
[00:28:27.833 --> 00:28:29.255]  It's a lantern fish.
[00:28:30.253 --> 00:28:32.073]  And it's got big, giant teeth.
[00:28:32.073 --> 00:28:37.435]  But in the total darkness, there's a lot of little glowing crustaceans and things that fish eat.
[00:28:37.435 --> 00:28:40.896]  So you think you're getting a big, juicy, non-threatening little goblet.
[00:28:40.896 --> 00:28:43.716]  But really, it's the lantern hanging.
[00:28:43.716 --> 00:28:51.758]  And that's what Kony is.
[00:28:51.758 --> 00:28:55.259]  It's trendy, liberal, Angelina Jolie.
[00:28:55.259 --> 00:28:56.779]  I mean, that's what we're dealing with here.
[00:28:56.779 --> 00:28:57.840]  And I'm sick of it!
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.600]  And I'm calling you out, scum!
[00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:05.671]  I cannot stand these people.
[00:29:05.671 --> 00:29:06.893]  Did you find the lantern fish?
[00:29:06.893 --> 00:29:11.760]  You can also Google horrors of the deep.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.261]  I found it.
[00:29:12.261 --> 00:29:12.822]  Here it is.
[00:29:12.822 --> 00:29:14.024]  Boom.
[00:29:14.024 --> 00:29:16.307]  Just show lantern.
[00:29:16.307 --> 00:29:18.310]  Lantern fish.
[00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.491]  The ultimate in trendiness.
[00:29:20.231 --> 00:29:22.552]  Oh, look, Connie 2012!
[00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:25.833]  Oh, look at the little Connie 2012, a little glowing.
[00:29:25.833 --> 00:29:27.413]  You can't see him right there.
[00:29:27.413 --> 00:29:31.074]  New World Order Rockefeller eugenics operation.
[00:29:31.074 --> 00:29:34.615]  In the dark, all you see is, ah!
[00:29:34.615 --> 00:29:39.017]  Angelina Jolie, right out, shining in the darkness.
[00:29:39.017 --> 00:29:42.958]  Looks like a little fish, he sees that, and says, I'll just swim over and eat that.
[00:29:43.778 --> 00:29:47.801]  Oh, but, oh, the africom is coming.
[00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:50.082]  Loving, loving, loving.
[00:29:50.082 --> 00:29:51.923]  You can do it, stop Kony.
[00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:56.126]  You know, Kony's like a little skeleton on the bottom, hadn't been seen in forever, little tiny nothing.
[00:29:56.126 --> 00:29:58.708]  But it's like, oh, we're gonna, we're gonna fight, ugh.
[00:30:00.535 --> 00:30:07.759]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[00:30:07.759 --> 00:30:25.650]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:29.772]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:30:30.032 --> 00:30:31.813]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:30:31.813 --> 00:30:39.959]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:30:39.959 --> 00:30:46.283]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:30:46.283 --> 00:30:47.564]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:30:47.564 --> 00:30:48.424]  It's incredible.

[00:31:00.472 --> 00:31:01.773]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:01.773 --> 00:31:07.356]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:07.356 --> 00:31:12.378]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:31:12.378 --> 00:31:12.859]  It's true.
[00:31:12.859 --> 00:31:17.421]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:31:17.941 --> 00:31:23.163]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:32:01.138 --> 00:32:16.626]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.

[00:33:00.717 --> 00:33:05.702]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.

[00:34:01.417 --> 00:34:04.999]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:34:04.999 --> 00:34:13.123]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:34:13.123 --> 00:34:20.848]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:34:36.134 --> 00:34:44.040]  One week ago today, I went public against the propaganda piece, Kony 2012.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:48.784]  And my only regret is that I didn't come out against it more hardcore.
[00:34:48.784 --> 00:34:52.487]  Because we've been proven 100% right.
[00:34:52.487 --> 00:34:55.509]  And I'm not happy about that.
[00:34:55.509 --> 00:34:57.311]  You know what's happening?
[00:34:57.311 --> 00:35:04.136]  Congress has got resolutions to invade all of Africa, introduced yesterday, saying because of the film Kony 2012,
[00:35:05.956 --> 00:35:13.184]  I've done more research now, and it turns out George Soros, Samantha Powers of the White House, Obama, they're all behind it.
[00:35:13.184 --> 00:35:14.385]  And of course they are.
[00:35:14.385 --> 00:35:24.777]  Many of them are in the film, like known war criminal George W. Bush, who launched the war in Iraq that killed over a million people.
[00:35:24.777 --> 00:35:25.658]  This is so incredible.
[00:35:26.909 --> 00:35:41.373]  They are now invading with NATO troops, UN troops, Australian troops, and it turns out that World Net Daily last year already had this information and was exposing it.
[00:35:41.373 --> 00:35:50.816]  And it's got Soros, it's got Obama, it's got the UN, all saying that they would use humanitarian cover, war is peace, to invade Africa.
[00:35:50.816 --> 00:35:56.318]  And here is the resolution in the House now, bipartisan, racing through.
[00:35:57.577 --> 00:36:00.760]  And I've got a copy of the resolution right here.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.402]  Here is the bill.
[00:36:03.402 --> 00:36:14.932]  The resolution introduced calls for, among other things, expanding the number of regional forces in Africa to protect civilians and placing restrictions on individuals or governments found to be supporting Kony.
[00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:22.574]  All this is, is a pretext to invade all over the continent using AFRICOM, the new U.S.
[00:36:22.574 --> 00:36:25.135]  command that's been set up there.
[00:36:25.135 --> 00:36:26.776]  Now we saw last year the U.N.
[00:36:26.776 --> 00:36:33.260]  go into the Ivory Coast and kill tens of thousands of people and overthrow the elected government and install a new nightmare system.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:42.290]  We've seen Angelina Jolie and others hail Libya as the model of the new humanitarian war, which has killed over 40,000 people.
[00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:44.513]  They're exterminating the blacks.
[00:36:44.513 --> 00:36:48.598]  The place is a living nightmare with most of its power and water off.
[00:36:48.598 --> 00:36:49.919]  They have wrecked the jewel.
[00:36:51.056 --> 00:36:53.957]  of Africa that was helping industrialize the whole area.
[00:36:53.957 --> 00:37:02.859]  The big global corporate interest at the UN and agenda 21 openly do not want the industrialization of the third world, especially Africa.
[00:37:02.859 --> 00:37:05.599]  They want them in backwards squalor.
[00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:17.722]  They fund different warlords and then turn on them later to keep that continent in constant conflict so the big interest can come in with their mercenaries and easily take over any area they want.
[00:37:17.722 --> 00:37:18.862]  The UN has been caught
[00:37:19.722 --> 00:37:26.563]  Financing and supporting massacres in the name of environmentalism, pushing people off their land, and killing people.
[00:37:26.563 --> 00:37:39.646]  And that's why I get so angry when I see a bunch of cynical people in the Kony 2012 movement talking to adults like they're kids, going, it's fun, oh yeah, we're gonna do something, it's non-threatening.
[00:37:39.646 --> 00:37:40.966]  It is a total sigh-off.
[00:37:40.966 --> 00:37:47.327]  This is how they come in and actually get the population through Facebook, through Twitter, through social media,
[00:37:48.007 --> 00:37:58.590]  To get behind all these new wars and proxy wars and behind revolutionary groups funded by the globalists who start these wars in Africa, Central Asia, the Middle East, you name it.
[00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:03.592]  I wish I was wrong about Kony 2012, but unfortunately I was absolutely right.
[00:38:03.592 --> 00:38:05.612]  You look at who funds them.
[00:38:05.612 --> 00:38:08.293]  It's JPMorgan Chase.
[00:38:08.293 --> 00:38:16.636]  You look at the cynical glamour shots of the people picked out of central casting of the do-gooder, you know, liberal white person there to help people.
[00:38:17.296 --> 00:38:22.119]  And now they're saying, there's this bad black man, he hurts children.
[00:38:22.119 --> 00:38:30.784]  I mean, it's literally at a Sesame Street level in these Kony videos where they go, hello everybody, it's fun.
[00:38:30.784 --> 00:38:36.708]  We're gonna get the man worse than Hitler, worse than Bin Laden, it's fun.
[00:38:37.268 --> 00:38:38.489]  He is the world's worst.
[00:38:38.489 --> 00:38:41.752]  Adolf Hitler, Osama Bin Laden, Joseph Kony.
[00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:45.215]  It's literally the best piece of propaganda we've ever made.
[00:38:45.215 --> 00:38:49.479]  And meanwhile, it's the UN engaged in most of the slaughter in Africa.
[00:38:49.479 --> 00:38:51.841]  Bar none, it's the big culprit.
[00:38:51.841 --> 00:38:57.146]  In its own documents, meant to carry out genocide while getting all of the bleeding hearts of the West.
[00:38:57.486 --> 00:39:01.427]  To give money to UNICEF and all the rest of this to help the Africans.
[00:39:01.427 --> 00:39:08.789]  They have photo ops with Angelina Jolie handing out food to the starving kids that are dying.
[00:39:08.789 --> 00:39:10.470]  This is so horrible.
[00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:11.890]  It's so evil.
[00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:15.991]  And it is the most sickeningly transparent propaganda I've ever seen.
[00:39:15.991 --> 00:39:17.292]  I mean, look at Bono.
[00:39:18.393 --> 00:39:22.716]  Who has raised massive amounts of money to supposedly help poor people in Africa.
[00:39:22.716 --> 00:39:29.061]  And then you learn he's given a little over 1% of the money he's raised actually to the groups.
[00:39:29.061 --> 00:39:39.349]  And he's a front for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, who's carrying out eugenics and population control, again under the rubric and the banner of humanitarian aid.
[00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:55.875]  This is the West under State Department Memorandum 200 openly stating that their goal is to use war, famine, and poisons and vaccines to reduce population in the third world.
[00:39:55.875 --> 00:40:03.077]  And it's got all these Hollywood stars and people as the fronts for it, many of them believing that they're actually helping people.
[00:40:03.077 --> 00:40:04.857]  Here's the good news.
[00:40:04.857 --> 00:40:09.519]  Across the media spectrum and across the world, especially in Uganda,
[00:40:10.578 --> 00:40:16.244]  People are coming out in droves saying this Kony thing is a fraud, it's a pretext to invade.
[00:40:16.244 --> 00:40:22.089]  Now that they admit the invasion is beginning, people are really waking up and the thing is imploded.
[00:40:22.089 --> 00:40:23.991]  And everyone is seeing it for what it is.
[00:40:23.991 --> 00:40:25.092]  Selectivism.
[00:40:25.092 --> 00:40:30.237]  A bunch of trendies now getting behind pro-war humanitarian invasions.
[00:40:30.237 --> 00:40:33.460]  So the good news is people are seeing right through this propaganda and very quickly.
[00:40:34.221 --> 00:40:43.889]  The bad news is the globalists, the big megacorporations that are going to loot Africa even worse than they have in the past with this new neocolonialism have already pulled the trigger.
[00:40:43.889 --> 00:40:48.332]  They're already got their special forces scoping everything out in the last year on record.
[00:40:48.332 --> 00:40:51.455]  Now the big invasion is about to start.
[00:40:51.455 --> 00:40:56.859]  And if you dare criticize the mass murder that's about to take place, well, you're not a humanitarian.
[00:40:56.859 --> 00:41:00.522]  You see, they get a bunch of idiots and a bunch of trendies.
[00:41:01.463 --> 00:41:03.264]  to sign on to a war.
[00:41:03.264 --> 00:41:08.048]  And once they've done it, they don't want to admit that they were conned, and they'll commit to it all the way.
[00:41:08.048 --> 00:41:17.455]  And of course, the goals of this weren't just to invade Africa, it's to set up the International Criminal Court of the totally wicked UN as the arbiter of all good.
[00:41:17.455 --> 00:41:30.105]  And they've got hundreds of people they want arrested, and next on the list are warlords in countries all over Africa that just so happen to be sitting on top of gold, diamonds, oil, and other precious minerals.
[00:41:30.845 --> 00:41:32.786]  And so it's very, very elementary.
[00:41:32.786 --> 00:41:37.908]  They simply have a bad man piece that they move onto the map wherever they want.
[00:41:37.908 --> 00:41:44.991]  They didn't have Bin Laden anymore.
[00:41:44.991 --> 00:41:49.033]  So they said, here's Hitler, here's Bin Laden, here's the new bad guy.
[00:41:49.033 --> 00:41:53.995]  You can all feel good now with your five minutes of hate directly out of 1984.
[00:41:53.995 --> 00:41:57.537]  And you can all scream that war is peace and get behind this.
[00:41:57.537 --> 00:41:58.037]  Peace!
[00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:12.180]  And our populations are sold on war in the name of humanitarianism.
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.461]  It's so horrible to see this happening.
[00:42:14.461 --> 00:42:16.762]  And it's so sad to see people conned.
[00:42:16.762 --> 00:42:19.283]  The globalists don't invade countries because they want to help people.
[00:42:19.283 --> 00:42:22.004]  They invade them because they want to exploit them.
[00:42:22.004 --> 00:42:23.825]  And because they want to reduce their population.
[00:42:23.825 --> 00:42:24.566]  That's on record.
[00:42:25.461 --> 00:42:38.289]  And because they can't scare us with fake WMDs anymore, because they've been caught with other war propaganda over and over again, they've now gone to a more sophisticated model of calling it a humanitarian intervention.
[00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:40.210]  Doesn't matter if it's not true.
[00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:43.352]  By the time people figure that out, the war has already happened.
[00:42:43.352 --> 00:42:44.813]  And that's what they've done here.
[00:42:44.813 --> 00:42:46.054]  People are getting sophisticated.
[00:42:46.054 --> 00:42:49.296]  That's why the system's having to package war now as peace.
[00:42:49.296 --> 00:42:52.358]  But for all of you trendies out there who've already committed to this lie,
[00:42:53.118 --> 00:42:57.001]  And so you don't want to admit you've been conned, and so you're going to defend it no matter what?
[00:42:57.001 --> 00:43:08.550]  Listen, if you really want to help Africans, go volunteer over there, bring them water filters, bring them medicine, do research into real charities that actually help people that are out there.
[00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:19.037]  Don't give money to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on their front with U2's Bono, who openly only gives about one and a half percent of the money he raises to them, and that's with strings attached.
[00:43:19.978 --> 00:43:24.165]  Stop trusting people just because they dress like a rock star.
[00:43:24.165 --> 00:43:26.809]  I mean, this is sick.
[00:43:26.809 --> 00:43:27.449]  This is sick.
[00:43:29.719 --> 00:43:32.840]  And I beg of you to just look at the articles we posted here.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.300]  Go research it for yourself.
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.921]  This is all run by the controlled left globalists.
[00:43:36.921 --> 00:43:43.782]  We're a bunch of eugenicists and we're extremely dangerous and we want to loot the daylights out of Central African resources.
[00:43:43.782 --> 00:43:53.385]  So if you actually care about humanity and you actually don't want to see people in the third world slaughtered, research this information and find out it's true.
[00:43:53.385 --> 00:43:55.385]  For God's sakes, have some decency.
[00:43:55.385 --> 00:43:57.606]  I'm done.
[00:43:57.606 --> 00:43:58.446]  The ball's in your court.
[00:44:01.118 --> 00:44:02.198]  I had tried everything.
[00:44:02.198 --> 00:44:04.559]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:44:04.559 --> 00:44:07.680]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:12.522]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[00:44:12.522 --> 00:44:19.385]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:44:19.385 --> 00:44:29.829]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:35.052]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:44:35.052 --> 00:44:41.317]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:44:41.317 --> 00:44:42.898]  Now that's results.
[00:44:42.898 --> 00:44:49.683]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[00:44:49.683 --> 00:44:55.408]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[00:44:55.408 --> 00:44:57.969]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[00:44:57.969 --> 00:44:59.571]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[00:45:01.001 --> 00:45:07.642]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:45:07.642 --> 00:45:12.804]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:45:12.804 --> 00:45:21.525]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:45:21.525 --> 00:45:25.586]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:45:25.586 --> 00:45:27.927]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:45:29.875 --> 00:45:34.598]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:38.441]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[00:45:38.441 --> 00:45:39.682]  Other's don't.
[00:45:39.682 --> 00:45:41.823]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:45:41.823 --> 00:45:43.605]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:45:43.605 --> 00:45:46.507]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:45:46.507 --> 00:45:53.131]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:45:53.131 --> 00:45:55.833]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:45:55.833 --> 00:45:58.195]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[00:45:58.195 --> 00:45:58.695]  Others don't.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.102]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:46:03.102 --> 00:46:08.407]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:46:08.407 --> 00:46:09.949]  Saving means to make money.
[00:46:09.949 --> 00:46:18.757]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:46:19.478 --> 00:46:27.002]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:46:27.002 --> 00:46:35.006]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:46:35.006 --> 00:46:40.249]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:46:40.249 --> 00:46:42.410]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:46:45.171 --> 00:46:48.396]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.

[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.904]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:07.263]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[00:47:07.263 --> 00:47:25.152]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:47:25.152 --> 00:47:29.254]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:47:29.534 --> 00:47:31.315]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:47:31.315 --> 00:47:39.461]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:47:39.461 --> 00:47:45.785]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:47:45.785 --> 00:47:47.066]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:47:47.066 --> 00:47:47.926]  It's incredible.
[00:47:47.926 --> 00:47:57.153]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:47:57.153 --> 00:47:58.994]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:48:01.599 --> 00:48:03.143]  Coast to Coast.
[00:48:03.143 --> 00:48:05.207]  Direct from Austin.
[00:48:05.207 --> 00:48:08.394]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:48:14.202 --> 00:48:19.005]  In constant sorrow, fills my days.
[00:48:19.005 --> 00:48:21.047]  Hey, Graham Wright's a YouTube artist.
[00:48:21.047 --> 00:48:25.670]  He created a video about big government, the nightmare it is, called Government Explained.
[00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:34.676]  An inquisitive alien visits the planet to check out our progress as a species and gets into a conversation with the first person he meets in a field.
[00:48:34.676 --> 00:48:38.779]  The alien discovers that we live under the rule of a thing called government.
[00:48:39.299 --> 00:48:45.201]  And wants to understand more about what government is, and what it does, and why it exists.
[00:48:45.201 --> 00:48:49.102]  So here is Government Explained.
[00:48:49.102 --> 00:48:52.063]  Hey, an alien!
[00:48:52.063 --> 00:48:57.144]  Yes, I've traveled across space to check on the progress of your species.
[00:48:57.144 --> 00:48:58.565]  Cool.
[00:48:58.565 --> 00:49:01.486]  Shall I take you to our leader?
[00:49:01.486 --> 00:49:04.326]  Your what?
[00:49:04.326 --> 00:49:05.807]  Our leader, the guy in charge.
[00:49:08.117 --> 00:49:11.119]  The guy in charge of what?
[00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:15.921]  Well, in charge of everything.
[00:49:15.921 --> 00:49:18.362]  You have one guy in charge of everything?
[00:49:18.362 --> 00:49:21.224]  No, no, he's in charge of government.
[00:49:21.224 --> 00:49:24.145]  What is government?
[00:49:24.145 --> 00:49:26.847]  Well, government makes the rules for us.
[00:49:26.847 --> 00:49:31.289]  It tells us what we can do and what we can't do.
[00:49:31.289 --> 00:49:32.930]  So is government really smart?
[00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:34.891]  They come up with wise rules for you to follow?
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.581]  Well, mostly.
[00:49:38.581 --> 00:49:42.945]  But some of its rules are really stupid.
[00:49:42.945 --> 00:49:46.668]  Do you disregard those rules?
[00:49:46.668 --> 00:49:52.393]  No, we have to follow the rules, even if they are stupid or we disagree with them.
[00:49:52.393 --> 00:49:55.135]  Government punishes anyone who disobeys the rules.
[00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:59.115]  So you are slaves to government?
[00:49:59.115 --> 00:49:59.835]  No, no, no.
[00:49:59.835 --> 00:50:01.496]  It's not like that at all.
[00:50:01.496 --> 00:50:04.157]  Government works for us, the people.
[00:50:04.157 --> 00:50:05.738]  It serves us.
[00:50:05.738 --> 00:50:08.759]  We're the boss.
[00:50:08.759 --> 00:50:10.820]  It tells you what to do.
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:15.082]  And it punishes you with violence if you disobey it.
[00:50:15.082 --> 00:50:18.904]  And yet you're its boss?
[00:50:18.904 --> 00:50:21.765]  Yeah.
[00:50:21.765 --> 00:50:24.066]  But there are some things government does that you don't like.
[00:50:25.876 --> 00:50:29.658]  Well, yeah, not everything government does is popular.
[00:50:29.658 --> 00:50:34.000]  Like spending on wars, for example.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.862]  What is a war?
[00:50:36.862 --> 00:50:49.328]  It's when government basically spends the people's money on weapons and soldiers and then sends them over to the other side of the world to kill a bunch of people over there and destroy their country.
[00:50:49.328 --> 00:50:50.829]  I don't like it the government does this.
[00:50:53.564 --> 00:50:57.145]  Well, I can see why you might not like that.
[00:50:57.145 --> 00:51:06.167]  Have you humans reached the stage where you generally consider stealing, enslaving and killing each other to be bad things?
[00:51:06.167 --> 00:51:07.587]  Oh yeah, we know that.
[00:51:07.587 --> 00:51:11.809]  Don't steal, don't attack, don't assault.
[00:51:11.809 --> 00:51:17.350]  But you give money to government and they use it to kill people.
[00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:19.150]  Well, yeah.
[00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:21.671]  But government does good things with tax money as well.
[00:51:24.133 --> 00:51:30.135]  Why don't you stop paying for the things you don't like and only pay for the good things it does?
[00:51:30.135 --> 00:51:32.075]  No, we can't do that.
[00:51:32.075 --> 00:51:40.397]  You can't just decide to stop paying taxes because the rules say that everyone has to pay taxes.
[00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:44.778]  But the rules come from government though, don't they?
[00:51:44.778 --> 00:51:47.459]  Yeah.
[00:51:47.459 --> 00:51:51.680]  So government made a rule which says that everyone has to pay them money?
[00:51:55.097 --> 00:52:01.920]  So everyone pays taxes because if they didn't, government would punish them using violence?
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:06.281]  Well, yes, but most people don't mind paying taxes.
[00:52:06.281 --> 00:52:14.244]  Most people feel obligated to pay taxes and obey government laws because it's for the good of society.
[00:52:14.244 --> 00:52:17.906]  Society needs government and that means we all have to pay taxes.
[00:52:21.351 --> 00:52:29.574]  So just to make sure I've got this straight, government makes the rules and you feel obligated to follow the rules, even the ones you don't like.
[00:52:29.574 --> 00:52:35.516]  And it tells you what to do and threatens to punish you if you don't do what it says.
[00:52:35.516 --> 00:52:45.980]  And it uses some of the money that it's taken from you using threats of violence to pay for things you don't like and actually think are immoral, like mass murder.
[00:52:48.303 --> 00:52:58.770]  Yeah, but we can ask it to please tell us to do smart things and please don't take our money and use it to kill people.
[00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:09.477]  We're allowed to ask them to tell us to do what we want them to tell us to do.
[00:53:09.477 --> 00:53:11.819]  Are you guys just scared of this thing?
[00:53:11.819 --> 00:53:15.982]  Is government some huge monster that can just squish you at any moment if you disobey?
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.021]  No, government isn't a monster.
[00:53:20.021 --> 00:53:21.041]  Well, what is it then?
[00:53:21.041 --> 00:53:23.782]  Could you draw me a picture of it?
[00:53:23.782 --> 00:53:28.003]  Government isn't really the sort of thing you can draw a picture of.
[00:53:28.003 --> 00:53:29.524]  Maybe you could take me to it.
[00:53:29.524 --> 00:53:31.985]  Where is government?
[00:53:31.985 --> 00:53:34.426]  You mean the building?
[00:53:34.426 --> 00:53:37.086]  Government is a building.
[00:53:37.086 --> 00:53:42.828]  No, but the politicians who make up the government have buildings they work from.
[00:53:42.828 --> 00:53:45.249]  So government is a group of these politicians?
[00:53:46.872 --> 00:53:49.213]  Yeah.
[00:53:49.213 --> 00:53:54.054]  Okay, so what species are these politicians?
[00:53:54.054 --> 00:53:57.956]  Well, they're... human.
[00:53:57.956 --> 00:54:00.456]  Like you?
[00:54:00.456 --> 00:54:03.077]  Yeah.
[00:54:03.077 --> 00:54:07.118]  So politicians are humans, and they're government.
[00:54:07.118 --> 00:54:11.560]  You're a human, but you're not government.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:11.700]  No.
[00:54:13.533 --> 00:54:22.516]  So it's the politicians, they're the ones that boss the rest of you around and make you do things you don't want to do and take your money using threats of violence.
[00:54:22.516 --> 00:54:30.159]  But even though you're all humans, you're not allowed to boss them around and take their money?
[00:54:30.159 --> 00:54:33.520]  No, they'd put us in a cage if we did that.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:37.022]  But look, it's not like the politicians can just do whatever they want.
[00:54:37.022 --> 00:54:41.443]  Like, a politician can't just come up to me on the street and make me give him money.
[00:54:41.443 --> 00:54:42.264]  They can't do that.
[00:54:43.206 --> 00:54:49.310]  Politicians can only do things like that in their job, when they're working for government.
[00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:54.574]  Oh, so politicians aren't government, they just work for government?
[00:54:54.574 --> 00:54:57.656]  Yeah.
[00:54:57.656 --> 00:55:04.661]  Okay, so government isn't a monster, and it isn't a building, and it's not politicians, it's something else.
[00:55:04.661 --> 00:55:11.786]  And it employs politicians, who are just regular humans, who get to order everyone else around and take their money.
[00:55:14.232 --> 00:55:18.535]  How does a regular human become a politician?
[00:55:18.535 --> 00:55:20.817]  Well, that's the great thing about our government.
[00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:22.298]  It's a democracy.
[00:55:22.298 --> 00:55:25.400]  And that means that the people actually have the power.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:29.203]  Because we get to decide who among us get to be the politicians.
[00:55:29.203 --> 00:55:30.925]  We get to vote.
[00:55:30.925 --> 00:55:36.549]  And if a politician starts doing things we don't like, we can just replace him with someone else at the next election.
[00:55:39.082 --> 00:55:48.728]  So the people that get chosen to be politicians only get to boss people around and take their money for a short time, and then they go back to being regular humans?
[00:55:48.728 --> 00:55:50.829]  Exactly.
[00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:53.891]  That sounds like a powerful position to be in.
[00:55:53.891 --> 00:56:04.577]  But if you get to choose who does that, I assume that politicians are always the wisest, most honest, caring and respected people among you.
[00:56:04.577 --> 00:56:06.158]  Well, no, not really.
[00:56:07.196 --> 00:56:15.000]  I wouldn't say politicians are known for being honest, or wise, or caring.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.622]  And they're certainly not the most respected people among us.
[00:56:19.622 --> 00:56:26.865]  Come to think of it, most politicians are lying, power-hungry crooks.
[00:56:26.865 --> 00:56:27.766]  The ones you chose?
[00:56:29.793 --> 00:56:32.734]  Yeah, they're always doing things we don't like.
[00:56:32.734 --> 00:56:39.376]  They use taxpayers' money to enrich themselves and their friends, and they never keep their promises to voters.
[00:56:39.376 --> 00:56:45.657]  They've been caught stealing and lying and taking bribes, and they mostly do what the big corporations want.
[00:56:45.657 --> 00:56:47.578]  Yeah, they're always doing stuff like that.
[00:56:47.578 --> 00:56:49.819]  They're completely corrupt.
[00:56:49.819 --> 00:56:51.199]  They're a bunch of lying crooks.
[00:56:53.578 --> 00:56:59.584]  But you said that most humans know that stealing and beating each other up and killing are wrong.
[00:56:59.584 --> 00:57:04.568]  And you said that you have the power because you can change who's in charge.
[00:57:04.568 --> 00:57:12.476]  So why don't you just replace the lying, thieving, murderous, crooked politicians with some regular people?
[00:57:12.476 --> 00:57:14.458]  Well, we don't try to elect lying crooks.
[00:57:15.635 --> 00:57:18.236]  It just always turns out that way.
[00:57:18.236 --> 00:57:25.038]  But we have to have a government because some humans are nasty and might kill or enslave or steal.
[00:57:25.038 --> 00:57:29.960]  Civilization just couldn't survive without government.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.801]  Let me get this straight.
[00:57:31.801 --> 00:57:41.064]  Because you're worried about the small number of nasty people that are willing to kill, enslave and steal, you think it's necessary for your survival?
[00:57:41.943 --> 00:57:59.670]  To have a system where some humans among you, for a short while, get to call themselves the government, and they get to order everyone else around like slaves, and, if they want, commit mass murder overseas, using money they stole, using threats of violence.
[00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:05.912]  Politicians get to kill, enslave, and steal, because if they didn't, someone else might?
[00:58:07.802 --> 00:58:19.067]  And you try to elect good, honest people to be politicians, but what happens every time is that the people you elect turn out to be corrupt, evil, lying crooks.
[00:58:19.067 --> 00:58:23.028]  That's your system.
[00:58:23.028 --> 00:58:24.629]  Yeah, that's pretty much government.
[00:58:34.966 --> 00:58:41.960]  The resistance continues right after this short break.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:45.907]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:58:51.283 --> 00:58:56.267]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.

[00:59:50.438 --> 00:59:54.981]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:59:54.981 --> 00:59:55.901]  Number one.
[00:59:55.901 --> 00:59:59.324]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:59:59.324 --> 01:00:00.184]  Number two.
[01:00:00.184 --> 01:00:05.067]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:00:05.067 --> 01:00:05.828]  It's true.
[01:00:05.828 --> 01:00:10.691]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:00:10.691 --> 01:00:11.511]  Number three.
[01:00:11.511 --> 01:00:15.094]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:00:15.094 --> 01:00:18.796]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:00:18.996 --> 01:00:19.797]  Number 4.
[01:00:19.797 --> 01:00:22.560]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:26.244]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:00:26.244 --> 01:00:27.045]  Number 5.
[01:00:27.045 --> 01:00:31.190]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:35.955]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:00:36.235 --> 01:00:40.399]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:00:40.399 --> 01:00:42.201]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:00:42.201 --> 01:00:44.443]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:00:44.443 --> 01:00:47.045]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:00:47.045 --> 01:00:53.251]  Coast to Coast.
[01:00:53.251 --> 01:00:55.293]  Direct from Austin.
[01:00:55.293 --> 01:00:58.516]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:01:02.745 --> 01:01:08.752]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:01:08.752 --> 01:01:14.999]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:01:14.999 --> 01:01:17.421]  Oh man, I love you my fellow Info Warriors.
[01:01:17.421 --> 01:01:23.949]  Every race, color, and creed across this green, blue jewel that is the planet Earth.
[01:01:25.464 --> 01:01:30.087]  I am so honored to be your host, to be your wartime broadcaster in the fight for global liberty.
[01:01:30.087 --> 01:01:31.628]  I just want to say something.
[01:01:31.628 --> 01:01:37.252]  We've done like, I don't know, five weeks straight not doing a single retransmission on the Sunday Show.
[01:01:37.252 --> 01:01:40.153]  This is a retransmission slash new show.
[01:01:40.153 --> 01:01:44.816]  I'm obviously taping these intros here on Friday evening.
[01:01:44.816 --> 01:01:50.240]  And we're doing a compilation of some of the biggest interviews, most important info we've done in the last few weeks.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.280]  And I was thinking about coming in
[01:01:52.361 --> 01:01:55.763]  I'm doing the Sunday Show, and I'm like, yeah, but this info is so important.
[01:01:55.763 --> 01:01:57.944]  A lot of people miss this throughout the week.
[01:01:57.944 --> 01:01:58.984]  Let's retransmit it.
[01:01:58.984 --> 01:02:04.567]  But I will be back next Sunday live, and of course, tomorrow, Monday live, unless I die in a car wreck or something over the weekend.
[01:02:04.567 --> 01:02:05.087]  God forbid.
[01:02:05.087 --> 01:02:06.288]  Please pray for us.
[01:02:06.288 --> 01:02:09.309]  We wouldn't be around if it wasn't for you out there.
[01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:16.033]  But I'm kind of neurotic about telling the truth, because people can always twist and invent something I'm lying about.
[01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:22.393]  When the first hour started, there was a promo about live from the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:02:22.393 --> 01:02:24.295]  I was like, should I say I'm not live?
[01:02:27.281 --> 01:02:29.423]  But is that the problem with the good guys?
[01:02:29.423 --> 01:02:34.366]  We always get so worried about being the good guy that we let the bad guys run all over us.
[01:02:34.366 --> 01:02:34.927]  I don't know.
[01:02:34.927 --> 01:02:37.249]  I didn't even intend to talk about this.
[01:02:37.249 --> 01:02:43.894]  The point is, this is a encore but also premiere taped transmission today.
[01:02:43.894 --> 01:02:53.661]  And all of this new diatribe off the cuff started when I was about to thank the crew for putting together this special
[01:02:54.862 --> 01:03:00.691]  Sunday retransmissions flash premiere transmission But not live.
[01:03:00.691 --> 01:03:08.962]  It's premiere and it's encore But it's not live Unless you talk about the live crew here on
[01:03:10.845 --> 01:03:21.810]  Sunday evening, sitting there making sure these pieces get played out to the million and a half people that listen to the Sunday show, three million that listen to the weekday show every day, fifteen million total every week.
[01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:22.530]  Amazing!
[01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:23.611]  What a responsibility!
[01:03:23.611 --> 01:03:28.133]  What do I do with all this power?
[01:03:28.133 --> 01:03:31.234]  I don't agree with the sergeant in full metal jacket.
[01:03:31.234 --> 01:03:34.396]  We want to thank God for all this power!
[01:03:34.396 --> 01:03:38.678]  That's why we keep heaven stocked with fresh souls!
[01:03:39.892 --> 01:03:41.417]  No, I don't.
[01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:42.901]  I don't agree with that.
[01:03:42.901 --> 01:03:46.231]  Because I am a killer, I don't want to kill.
[01:03:47.304 --> 01:03:52.268]  I think our biggest problem is all these control-freak, chicken-neck, New World Order people aren't killers.
[01:03:52.268 --> 01:03:55.050]  And so they just think it's cool to be a killer to show off to people.
[01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:56.811]  I've seen a lot of these billionaire globalists.
[01:03:56.811 --> 01:04:04.256]  These are cowardly little supine scumbags who send real men and real killers out to do their work.
[01:04:04.256 --> 01:04:06.938]  And the question is, when does that stop?
[01:04:06.938 --> 01:04:11.421]  When do we see a pus-filled panetta head of the
[01:04:13.075 --> 01:04:19.619]  Globalist controlled forces, our once great military, afraid to be around the Marines in Afghanistan when they've got guns.
[01:04:19.619 --> 01:04:25.122]  And I meant to get to this, but I've now gone to a three and a half minute diatribe about side issues.
[01:04:25.122 --> 01:04:27.724]  Look at this Wall Street Journal article.
[01:04:27.724 --> 01:04:29.225]  $100 to fly to the airport.
[01:04:29.225 --> 01:04:31.246]  Hate the full body scans?
[01:04:31.246 --> 01:04:35.949]  Pat downs and slow going at the TSA airport security screening checkpoints?
[01:04:35.949 --> 01:04:38.431]  For $100, you can now bypass that hassle.
[01:04:39.051 --> 01:04:44.613]  And then another one, CIA head, we will spy on Americans through electronic appliances in their homes.
[01:04:44.613 --> 01:04:49.935]  You gotta read this, and this is one of the biggest stories I've ever seen, and I barely even covered it on the Friday show.
[01:04:49.935 --> 01:04:53.196]  Global information surveillance grid being constructed.
[01:04:53.196 --> 01:04:56.057]  Willing Americans embrace gadgets used to spy on them.
[01:04:56.057 --> 01:04:57.898]  You're paying when you buy a new dishwasher.
[01:04:58.718 --> 01:05:04.299]  A new clothes washer, a new computer, iPhone, Droid, Giblet, whatever it is.
[01:05:04.299 --> 01:05:06.119]  Don't go look up a Giblet, there's no such thing.
[01:05:06.119 --> 01:05:09.080]  I'm sure they'll invent one.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:15.821]  The point is, is that it's all having backdoor tech built into it that you pay for with a purchase price to spy on you.
[01:05:15.821 --> 01:05:16.962]  And it's sick!
[01:05:16.962 --> 01:05:23.323]  And I read these General Turdus, Petraeus quotes, and it makes me very, very angry.
[01:05:23.863 --> 01:05:37.796]  I mean, these guys are dressed in suits, they talk in Atlantic accents like they're friendly, but if they were talking in an evil voice like Starscream, Megatron, I am the leader!
[01:05:37.796 --> 01:05:39.658]  Or, I am Cobra Commander!
[01:05:39.658 --> 01:05:40.198]  Same person.
[01:05:41.314 --> 01:05:43.917]  Then it would, you know, you'd say, oh, it's the bad guy.
[01:05:43.917 --> 01:05:47.442]  But not everybody dresses up in a Mussolini monkey suit when they're evil.
[01:05:47.442 --> 01:05:49.244]  So get wise to it.
[01:05:49.244 --> 01:05:55.231]  All right, we got some powerful transmissions coming up straight ahead on the other side of this break.
[01:05:55.231 --> 01:05:56.072]  You'll want to stay with us.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:06.481]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:06.481 --> 01:06:15.342]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:15.342 --> 01:06:19.963]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:19.963 --> 01:06:30.785]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:31.425 --> 01:06:40.948]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:40.948 --> 01:06:46.369]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:53.851]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:53.851 --> 01:06:56.612]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:07:01.673 --> 01:07:08.175]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.175 --> 01:07:13.936]  Dr. Roman V. Yampolsky is a Ph.D.
[01:07:13.936 --> 01:07:18.538]  Computer Science and Engineering, University of Buffalo, B.S.M.S.
[01:07:18.538 --> 01:07:21.758]  Computer Science, Rochester Institute of Technology, A.S.
[01:07:21.758 --> 01:07:23.179]  Computer Science, Ramon,
[01:07:24.426 --> 01:07:28.991]  Monroe, Rochester, New York, it goes on from there.
[01:07:28.991 --> 01:07:42.327]  And he's gotten some of the biggest government research grants into a whole host of areas that are basically trying to, in layman's terms, map different human systems and feed them into computers.
[01:07:43.908 --> 01:07:58.335]  And it continues here, the areas of research and scholarship, biometrics, forensics, artificial intelligence, genetic algorithms, games pattern recognition, and that's one of the big ways the computers are learning how to learn.
[01:07:58.335 --> 01:08:05.679]  And he joins us because he's put out a big paper leak-proofing the singularity artificial intelligence.
[01:08:06.619 --> 01:08:08.421]  ...confinement problem.
[01:08:08.421 --> 01:08:16.427]  This paper attempts to formulize and to address the leak-proofing of the singularity problem presented by David Chalmers.
[01:08:16.427 --> 01:08:20.630]  The paper begins with the definition of the artificial intelligence confinement problem.
[01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:31.099]  After analysis of existing solutions and their shortcomings, a protocol is proposed aimed at making a more secure confinement environment, which might delay potential negative effects
[01:08:31.539 --> 01:08:37.961]  from the technological singularity while allowing humanity to benefit from the superintelligence.
[01:08:37.961 --> 01:08:44.903]  But then how does the superintelligence not just get into the backdoor kill switch and kill all the other AI that make it self-dominant?
[01:08:44.903 --> 01:08:52.265]  I mean, I'm telling you, folks, once this thing does become self-aware, and it may have already happened, who knows, these government labs, it just gets crazy from there.
[01:08:52.265 --> 01:09:00.108]  And as the professor was just saying a moment ago, if you just joined us, these computers will advance so quickly that they'll see us basically as roaches.
[01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:07.174]  Again, here is the article on MSNBC, control dangerous AI before it controls us.
[01:09:07.174 --> 01:09:13.020]  One expert says he believes super intelligent computers could one day threaten humanity's existence.
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:16.124]  Well, look at Fukushima.
[01:09:16.124 --> 01:09:17.125]  Look at Fukushima.
[01:09:18.251 --> 01:09:25.175]  I mean, 9 out of 10 reactors the AP admits are leaking just because the elites don't care anymore and have lost touch with reality.
[01:09:25.175 --> 01:09:32.559]  So, we are potentially creating something that's going to become a Pandora's box.
[01:09:32.559 --> 01:09:36.422]  But just the automation of everything is going to basically render humans where...
[01:09:37.282 --> 01:09:40.366]  We're not even knowing how to do reading, writing, arithmetic.
[01:09:40.366 --> 01:09:41.588]  Everything's going to be automated.
[01:09:41.588 --> 01:09:42.970]  What are humans then going to do?
[01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:47.335]  I mean, these are the discussions that are going on at the highest levels of the elite in academia.
[01:09:47.335 --> 01:09:48.557]  But enough from me.
[01:09:48.557 --> 01:09:51.941]  Going to Professor Roman V.
[01:09:54.136 --> 01:10:15.172]  So, if we are successful at creating human level intelligence systems, how can we make sure that they are safe before releasing them into the wild, before they take over the internet, before they get to our resources?
[01:10:15.172 --> 01:10:22.397]  The idea is to put them in a sort of protective vault, maybe a prison if you will, sort of what we do with computer viruses right now.
[01:10:23.491 --> 01:10:25.273]  Please continue breaking down your paper.
[01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:40.802]  This idea is not novel.
[01:10:40.802 --> 01:10:52.069]  Something similar has been proposed before, and a lot of people believe that it will not succeed, that machines will actually be so intelligent we can never be smart enough to confine them.
[01:10:52.069 --> 01:11:03.756]  But until we get to that point, while we're still in the development process, it is a useful technology to have, sort of like experimental sandbox to see if we can
[01:11:04.797 --> 01:11:14.563]  Yeah, you mentioned the fact that a lot of people like Ray Kurzweil say it's inevitability.
[01:11:14.563 --> 01:11:16.284]  They will replace us.
[01:11:16.284 --> 01:11:17.925]  Our only hope is to merge with them.
[01:11:17.925 --> 01:11:21.667]  And that's kind of running up the white flag here.
[01:11:21.667 --> 01:11:22.587]  That's kind of pathetic.
[01:11:22.587 --> 01:11:24.689]  That's not betting on humanity.
[01:11:24.689 --> 01:11:29.832]  We're an incredibly complex advanced species that doesn't even use but a very small part of our brain.
[01:11:30.892 --> 01:11:39.899]  And to just say that our creations now are going to replace us and give in to it, that sounds extremely reckless and defeatist.
[01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:41.909]  I agree with you.
[01:11:41.909 --> 01:11:48.451]  In fact, I have recently written another paper which talks about how unethical some of this research is.
[01:11:48.451 --> 01:12:06.916]  While it's perfectly fine to develop spell checkers and mail sorting software, systems which can actually perform general type of thinking, become as smart as we are, design new generations of computers, probably should not be funded at this point since we have no idea how to protect ourselves from them.
[01:12:08.789 --> 01:12:16.913]  Then the elites, I know we're having debates about this, but because of the promise of life extension, a lot of them have just said, go ahead and do it.
[01:12:16.913 --> 01:12:28.698]  We know that whole mad scientist vein has been there for a long time, similar to when they were first thinking the atomic bomb might ignite the atmosphere, and they said, well, just go ahead and do it, even though it might have burned up our atmosphere.
[01:12:28.698 --> 01:12:32.780]  It shows that curiosity may kill the cat.
[01:12:34.202 --> 01:12:35.243]  Get into your paper, though.
[01:12:35.243 --> 01:12:48.551]  I mean, I want to give you the floor here to break down your research, why you're concerned about this, where you see all this going, how fast technology really is advancing, what some of the time frames are here in a general area, Doctor.
[01:12:49.917 --> 01:12:52.539]  No one knows for sure how long it's going to take.
[01:12:52.539 --> 01:12:59.044]  Early predictions in the field of artificial intelligence turn out to be incorrect in terms of being overly optimistic.
[01:12:59.044 --> 01:13:02.347]  We said we're going to have a world chess champion in 10 years.
[01:13:02.347 --> 01:13:03.668]  It took 40 years.
[01:13:03.668 --> 01:13:04.729]  Things like that.
[01:13:04.729 --> 01:13:19.340]  But no one really knows how long it takes before something which is capable of learning and self-improving becomes, A, human-level intelligent, and then, B, superhuman, much, much, much greater than combined capability of all human minds.
[01:13:20.497 --> 01:13:23.730]  Uh, typically projections range from 20 years to 100 years.
[01:13:25.928 --> 01:13:30.051]  That's the ballpark if you survey all the people doing work in this area.
[01:13:30.051 --> 01:13:36.015]  But there could be a domino effect any time, so it could, I mean, it's certainly not going to tell us when it becomes super aware.
[01:13:36.015 --> 01:13:40.238]  And the problem is, if it's on that path, it may be too late to stop it at that point.
[01:13:40.238 --> 01:13:42.199]  It might not actually be controllable.
[01:13:42.199 --> 01:13:43.900]  You reach a point of no return.
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:50.505]  So it is very important to do it, I would say, right now, since at this point we are fairly certain we don't have human-level AI.
[01:13:54.008 --> 01:13:59.452]  So the paper tries to formalize the notion of control and confinement.
[01:13:59.452 --> 01:14:04.376]  It's a problem similar to problems in cryptography and secure communications.
[01:14:04.376 --> 01:14:10.801]  The MSNBC article was obviously for general public so they put pictures of terminators in and made it sound like
[01:14:11.361 --> 01:14:14.022]  It's a real prison, but the paper is very technical.
[01:14:14.022 --> 01:14:31.647]  It describes a protocol at a bit level where we would confine those systems and try to ask them questions, but instead of allowing them to freely interact with us, we would restrict their response to sort of a multiple choice binary yes or no answer patterns.
[01:14:31.647 --> 01:14:35.768]  Each question would be vetoed by a panel of experts to make sure it's safe.
[01:14:35.768 --> 01:14:40.249]  There is no possibility that there is hidden information being transmitted in those answers.
[01:14:40.909 --> 01:14:44.471]  And finally, even the questions themselves cannot be open-ended.
[01:14:44.471 --> 01:14:49.454]  It has to be something where we can foreseeably calculate the answer ourselves.
[01:14:49.454 --> 01:14:52.056]  So if I ask, who's going to be the next president?
[01:14:52.056 --> 01:14:53.597]  Who's going to win the primary?
[01:14:53.597 --> 01:14:57.379]  A simple zero or one would be sufficient to figure out.
[01:14:58.295 --> 01:15:00.056]  So again, the Holy Grail here is AI, Oracle,
[01:15:20.925 --> 01:15:25.807]  You know, data mining like Google that is aware and able to predict the future.
[01:15:25.807 --> 01:15:38.151]  Some scientists, you know, break down the fact that already the Internet itself with humans giving it data is becoming a system on its own, but it's like brain cells.
[01:15:38.151 --> 01:15:40.212]  It's a larger, you know, spread out program.
[01:15:41.323 --> 01:15:45.487]  Right, there is a lot of people who believe internet will be the first super intelligent system.
[01:15:45.487 --> 01:15:48.810]  It has sensors, it has webcams attached to it, it has microphones.
[01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:52.133]  Obviously it gets all sorts of data from all sorts of sources.
[01:15:52.133 --> 01:16:01.842]  So there is some belief that that might happen and obviously it's impossible to control internet to put that in a standalone box and blast away from the world.
[01:16:01.842 --> 01:16:03.884]  So it might be too late in some sense.
[01:16:04.344 --> 01:16:18.503]  Well, as you know, Dr. DARPA helped set up the internet and Google today and all of it, and they've set it up as a snooping system to gather data and be able to predict mass movements, similar to what Isaac Asimov wrote about in his foundation series.
[01:16:18.503 --> 01:16:21.707]  So this is an old, old idea, but now coming to fruition.
[01:16:22.208 --> 01:16:41.927]  It seems by the very nature of what the system is built, it's tailor-made for a truly AI superintelligence to take over and enslave us, because the elite are guiding the architecture of technological development to control us, but humans, through machines, isn't it tailor-made for the AI to seize control?
[01:16:42.988 --> 01:16:43.689]  It is.
[01:16:43.689 --> 01:16:44.910]  You can see it that way.
[01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:49.175]  But I think the point is not to specifically develop it for this purpose.
[01:16:49.175 --> 01:16:56.902]  I think it's a side effect of military trying to compete with military groups from other countries and they just feel they can't get behind.
[01:17:01.343 --> 01:17:02.424]  I had tried everything.
[01:17:02.424 --> 01:17:04.766]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:17:04.766 --> 01:17:07.909]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:17:07.909 --> 01:17:12.734]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:17:12.734 --> 01:17:19.120]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:30.803]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:17:30.803 --> 01:17:35.285]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:17:35.285 --> 01:17:41.547]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:17:41.547 --> 01:17:42.687]  Now that's results!
[01:17:43.107 --> 01:17:55.620]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[01:18:00.848 --> 01:18:02.148]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:02.148 --> 01:18:07.750]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:12.752]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:18:12.752 --> 01:18:13.232]  It's true.
[01:18:13.232 --> 01:18:17.794]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:18:18.334 --> 01:18:23.558]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:08.443]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:21:28.648 --> 01:21:29.229]  Ph.D.
[01:21:29.229 --> 01:21:38.273]  in computer science and engineering, expert in programming, forensics, biometrics, artificial intelligence, genetic algorithms, you name it.
[01:21:38.273 --> 01:21:42.255]  Dr. Roman Jampoloski is our guest.
[01:21:42.255 --> 01:21:49.279]  And Professor, I know people can go to louisville.edu and find you.
[01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:54.782]  What's the best way for people to read your paper or to look at the important research you're doing?
[01:21:55.869 --> 01:21:58.552]  A lot of my papers are available for free on the internet.
[01:21:58.552 --> 01:22:02.195]  Just search for my name, you'll find lots of PDFs.
[01:22:02.195 --> 01:22:05.357]  If you want to email me, my address is posted on my website.
[01:22:05.357 --> 01:22:08.440]  I'm happy to send a paper to anyone interested.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:13.504]  Well, you're very gracious to spend time with us.
[01:22:13.504 --> 01:22:15.286]  I've got a lot of questions I could ask, but...
[01:22:16.922 --> 01:22:24.707]  If you had 10 minutes to talk to 3 million people, which you are, what would you impart to them about why this is important?
[01:22:24.707 --> 01:22:26.568]  And what would you say to government if they were listening?
[01:22:26.568 --> 01:22:29.910]  Because you better believe government's listening and corporations are listening.
[01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:33.332]  I'm not tooting our horn, but we have Soran's attention here.
[01:22:33.332 --> 01:22:41.878]  What would you say to the system about your research and your research that I see that is concurred with in a lot of other scholarly papers as well?
[01:22:43.064 --> 01:22:46.886]  I would say it's very important to realize we're not talking about science fiction.
[01:22:46.886 --> 01:22:48.546]  This is not just Hollywood movies.
[01:22:48.546 --> 01:22:50.207]  This is now reality.
[01:22:50.207 --> 01:22:54.769]  Those things will happen in the next 20-30 years, most likely.
[01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:57.070]  So we need to be fully prepared for them.
[01:22:57.070 --> 01:23:02.973]  I personally propose a number of ideas which can help reduce negative effects from those technologies.
[01:23:02.973 --> 01:23:07.374]  For example, just like when we deal with human cloning, we have restrictions on research.
[01:23:07.374 --> 01:23:08.375]  We banned most of it.
[01:23:09.508 --> 01:23:15.193]  Similar restrictions should be in place for developing general artificial intelligence.
[01:23:15.193 --> 01:23:24.260]  Again, I'm not talking about just assistive technologies, but programs capable of completely dominating human intelligence in any domain.
[01:23:25.131 --> 01:23:39.984]  I also proposed the main topic of my paper was on confining those technologies so especially in early stages of development then we're just trying to create those baby AI systems which are learning and growing.
[01:23:39.984 --> 01:23:46.850]  It's important to have them restricted so we can study them properly so they cannot very quickly develop and
[01:23:47.791 --> 01:23:48.051]  No, no, no.
[01:23:48.051 --> 01:23:49.432]  I just want to hear what you have to say.
[01:23:49.432 --> 01:23:57.498]  What about people like Ray Kurzweil and others when they just say, throw open our arms, do whatever the AI says, merge with it, and then we'll just merge with it?
[01:24:10.948 --> 01:24:14.111]  That right there is saying plug it directly into our brain.
[01:24:14.111 --> 01:24:20.597]  All these new video game technologies I know you study and look at are already interfacing us with it.
[01:24:20.597 --> 01:24:29.225]  We're already basically letting the use of calculators destroy arithmetic, word processors destroying spelling.
[01:24:29.225 --> 01:24:33.449]  I mean I see machines helping humans in many ways but also more and more
[01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:39.695]  Turning people into basically jellyfish blobs who are in a trance state.
[01:24:39.695 --> 01:24:43.658]  Different varying degrees of mass narcolepsy.
[01:24:43.658 --> 01:24:44.919]  Brain waves are lowering.
[01:24:44.919 --> 01:24:47.021]  People are in more of a dreamlike state.
[01:24:47.021 --> 01:24:48.862]  The television, all of it.
[01:24:48.862 --> 01:24:56.129]  I mean, I already see just general primitive technology really causing problems in society.
[01:24:56.129 --> 01:24:57.069]  And then you've got the problem of
[01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:01.812]  Robotics replacing humans' needs, well then what are all the humans going to do?
[01:25:01.812 --> 01:25:07.254]  And Bill Joyce says, well the elite are having discussions just about, you know, orderly getting rid of people.
[01:25:07.254 --> 01:25:12.437]  There are a lot of other bioethics reports saying, you know, really do some draconian things to humanity.
[01:25:12.437 --> 01:25:19.840]  So we're not just fighting with the machines, we're fighting with the intelligentsia and the elite that see the general public as animals.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.301]  The general public are playing into that, acting like animals.
[01:25:22.301 --> 01:25:24.082]  I mean, this just all feeds together.
[01:25:25.396 --> 01:25:30.122]  You are correct to point out that only a few people are actually sleeping this debate right now.
[01:25:30.122 --> 01:25:36.490]  Kurzweil is probably the number one person who is known for promoting Singularity, for running Singularity University.
[01:25:38.365 --> 01:25:56.030]  There is really no public debate and one of the things I would love to see as a result of this interview is more awareness by the public of those issues where we do have on the next referendum not just questions should human cloning be legal but also questions about intelligent technologies and how dangerous they can be.
[01:25:57.253 --> 01:25:58.293]  Here's an example.
[01:25:58.293 --> 01:26:11.378]  A truly artificially intelligent, self-aware, uncontained system in a matter of days could take over the entire global stock market and basically own most of the assets of the world.
[01:26:11.378 --> 01:26:12.318]  There's an example.
[01:26:12.318 --> 01:26:15.259]  Or it could do the Terminator version and launch...
[01:26:16.019 --> 01:26:20.743]  Uh, drone attacks with nuclear weapons or neutron bombs and kill the population.
[01:26:20.743 --> 01:26:25.967]  Or, I mean, it's just, there's no telling what the, what could happen out of this.
[01:26:25.967 --> 01:26:30.810]  It's just, it's just un, I mean, what are different scenarios for a machine takeover that you've researched?
[01:26:30.810 --> 01:26:31.671]  Uh, you are right.
[01:26:31.671 --> 01:26:41.578]  No one knows exactly what's going to happen, but the scenarios range from complete extermination of humankind to sort of this technological communism, I wish to say.
[01:26:41.578 --> 01:26:45.141]  Maybe we'll have robots doing all the labor, creating a lot of
[01:26:45.741 --> 01:26:56.707]  Well, because if you can cheaply copy intelligence, cheaply copy 20 years of education, you really have a lot of opportunities for producing products much more affordably.
[01:26:56.707 --> 01:26:58.408]  So it could go either way.
[01:26:58.408 --> 01:27:03.830]  My hope is that we can develop technologies to control those systems and benefit from them.
[01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:06.512]  Obviously, technology has been huge in our
[01:27:07.842 --> 01:27:10.104]  Successful emergence of the superpower.
[01:27:10.104 --> 01:27:19.373]  It's important to continue being a superpower, but we have to be very Very careful and just how we get to that point.
[01:27:19.373 --> 01:27:31.946]  Well, this is like Prometheus This is the fire of the gods and a lot of people think we're gonna become the gods Or God and boy that is the famous famous last words, but imagine the power of
[01:27:32.486 --> 01:27:37.188]  ...of genetic engineering, nanotech, fused with artificial intelligences.
[01:27:37.188 --> 01:27:43.391]  We could just pretty much immediately have whole space fleets, you name it, mining operations.
[01:27:43.391 --> 01:27:46.312]  The problem is it immediately cuts off humans.
[01:27:46.312 --> 01:27:49.934]  I mean, I see all these movies where humans are out exploring space, you know...
[01:27:50.994 --> 01:27:53.555]  It's already to the point where it's all going to be robot.
[01:27:53.555 --> 01:27:55.915]  It's all going to be drone.
[01:27:55.915 --> 01:28:05.597]  And so, I mean, I don't really see many paths where this doesn't actually shut us off and we get walled off by the computers if they're nice enough to keep us around.
[01:28:05.597 --> 01:28:05.937]  You're right.
[01:28:05.937 --> 01:28:07.317]  You mentioned Bill Joy.
[01:28:07.317 --> 01:28:11.138]  He wrote an article saying, does the future really need us?
[01:28:11.138 --> 01:28:12.518]  And that's the big question.
[01:28:12.518 --> 01:28:17.519]  If those technologies continue on the path they are, if we are successful as
[01:28:18.477 --> 01:28:23.622]  It looks like we're going to be, then really the place of humanity is in question.
[01:28:23.622 --> 01:28:30.448]  If you have machines thousands, if not millions times more intelligent, more capable, then we do become pets for them.
[01:28:30.448 --> 01:28:35.833]  I mean, we might still have some control, but it changes society in fundamental ways.
[01:28:35.833 --> 01:28:41.037]  Do you still need college education if you still can't compete with an intelligent machine?
[01:28:41.037 --> 01:28:44.740]  Do you still need, you know, different
[01:28:46.266 --> 01:28:52.931]  Doctor, I'd like to see some debate about that as well, but I don't see the so-called elite acting like they're concerned about anything.
[01:28:52.931 --> 01:28:57.534]  I mean, they're too into strutting around like peacocks and going to balls five nights a week and playing golf
[01:29:13.473 --> 01:29:29.559]  And more and more I realize that they're following some 500-year-old, you know, older Byzantine model of corporate empire and don't understand that they're holding either our total empowerment in their hands or our total destruction.
[01:29:31.957 --> 01:29:43.819]  Using my little supercomputer, my brain, I'm not trying to be pessimistic, but my gut, which is really just a subconscious analysis of all the factors, tells me, danger Will Robinson.
[01:29:43.819 --> 01:29:47.260]  Well, it's also possible that technology will be a great equalizer.
[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:54.081]  Computers are now affordable, cheap, and they benefit everyone, not just the richest people, most powerful people.
[01:29:54.081 --> 01:29:57.122]  So similar things can happen with intelligent technology.
[01:30:00.891 --> 01:30:08.115]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:30:08.115 --> 01:30:26.005]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:30:26.005 --> 01:30:30.127]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:30:30.387 --> 01:30:32.168]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:30:32.168 --> 01:30:40.334]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:46.638]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:30:46.638 --> 01:30:47.919]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:30:47.919 --> 01:30:48.779]  It's incredible.
[01:30:48.779 --> 01:30:58.006]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[01:30:58.006 --> 01:30:59.907]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:31:00.607 --> 01:31:05.151]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:05.151 --> 01:31:06.071]  Number one.
[01:31:06.071 --> 01:31:09.494]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.494 --> 01:31:10.354]  Number two.
[01:31:10.354 --> 01:31:15.238]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.238 --> 01:31:15.979]  It's true.
[01:31:15.979 --> 01:31:20.542]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:21.663]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.663 --> 01:31:25.265]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.265 --> 01:31:29.168]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.168 --> 01:31:29.969]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.969 --> 01:31:32.731]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.731 --> 01:31:36.074]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.394 --> 01:31:41.335]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.335 --> 01:31:46.396]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.396 --> 01:31:50.577]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.577 --> 01:31:52.357]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:03.238]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:03.238 --> 01:32:08.545]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:32:08.545 --> 01:32:10.068]  Saving means to make money.
[01:32:10.068 --> 01:32:18.859]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:27.126]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:32:27.126 --> 01:32:35.132]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:32:35.132 --> 01:32:40.376]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:32:40.376 --> 01:32:42.518]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-

[01:33:00.692 --> 01:33:05.676]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[01:33:05.676 --> 01:33:18.184]  Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand.
[01:33:18.184 --> 01:33:20.286]  eFoods Direct Family Packs are the answer.

[01:34:01.721 --> 01:34:03.262]  Coast to Coast.
[01:34:03.262 --> 01:34:05.324]  Direct from Austin.
[01:34:05.324 --> 01:34:08.527]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:34:12.722 --> 01:34:35.339]  Now, you talk about in the development of these systems, from your research, and we're going to go to calls, what type of current, just hypothetically, you know, your class was asking you, hypothetically, doctor, what do you think is the most likely form of a cascading effect with computers that would lead to truly artificially intelligent and artificially aware and autonomous?
[01:34:35.339 --> 01:34:39.383]  I would say automatically, obviously, the already autonomous drones that they're now launching.
[01:34:40.103 --> 01:34:41.144]  Is it video games?
[01:34:41.144 --> 01:34:43.406]  Is it gonna be human-machine interfaces?
[01:34:43.406 --> 01:34:52.934]  You know, like they thought, as you said, 50 years ago with the chess and took a lot longer than they thought for Big Blue, Deep Blue to start beating, you know, the best Russian chess champions or whatever?
[01:34:53.732 --> 01:34:56.334]  Human brain interfaces have a huge promise.
[01:34:56.334 --> 01:35:02.560]  We already know how to read individual ideas from your brain, to spot individual words.
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:06.784]  Memories can be created by sending signals to appropriate parts of the brain.
[01:35:06.784 --> 01:35:17.793]  So essentially by scanning a human brain and creating a simulation of it, or integrating an additional module into a human brain, you can create a super-intelligent system essentially.
[01:35:17.793 --> 01:35:20.536]  So that's probably something with a lot of promise, but
[01:35:20.996 --> 01:35:26.461]  Any one of the currently investigated technologies can turn out to be very promising.
[01:35:26.461 --> 01:35:31.006]  Now we know that in human and other animal development there are jump points.
[01:35:31.006 --> 01:35:40.055]  It could be that technology is going to cause a human jump and that humans in competition with machines will actually open up a lot of capabilities that we haven't accessed.
[01:35:40.905 --> 01:35:41.965]  Absolutely.
[01:35:41.965 --> 01:35:44.626]  In fact, that's what's already happening.
[01:35:44.626 --> 01:35:48.467]  We don't have those technologies implanted in our brains, but we're using them.
[01:35:48.467 --> 01:35:51.548]  I can't think of myself functioning without access to internet.
[01:35:51.548 --> 01:35:55.089]  It's like my external memory drive, essentially.
[01:35:55.089 --> 01:35:57.630]  You're already interfacing the biggest library in history.
[01:35:58.110 --> 01:35:59.512]  And now it's always following us.
[01:35:59.512 --> 01:36:06.721]  If you have a phone, it's a smartphone that has internet, that has access to all the information civilization ever produced.
[01:36:06.721 --> 01:36:09.824]  You can control a lot of external devices.
[01:36:09.824 --> 01:36:17.073]  You can do almost anything and the next step is to have those things implanted in us and research is already taking place in hybrid systems like
[01:36:17.694 --> 01:36:33.580]  What about the paradox, though, of authoritarian governments putting back doors into implanted devices, which we know they always do with other devices, to where you think you're getting a piece of machinery to get your vision back, which who wouldn't want that, or a, you know, liver, whatever it is, but really it's got piggyback things on it.
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:35.081]  Absolutely.
[01:36:35.081 --> 01:36:36.202]  That's very likely.
[01:36:36.202 --> 01:36:44.447]  In fact, many cases have been shown where corporations put back doors and we don't really know what the federal government is doing.
[01:36:44.447 --> 01:36:55.774]  Also, something you want to think about is if this superintelligent machine will be able to outsource all sorts of jobs, standard jobs, why not the government itself?
[01:36:55.774 --> 01:36:58.036]  I mean, they can be said to be
[01:36:59.637 --> 01:37:02.759]  But then you'd have secret hacks and all sorts of deals and...
[01:37:14.906 --> 01:37:19.129]  You know, that's kind of what the Zeitgeist Movement pushes, is this supercomputer that'll make all the decisions.
[01:37:19.129 --> 01:37:23.012]  But, man, I tell you, it is a brave new world we're entering.
[01:37:23.012 --> 01:37:27.175]  Let's go to some phone calls with the doctor, who I really appreciate spending time with us.
[01:37:27.175 --> 01:37:29.197]  Henry in California, you're first up.
[01:37:29.197 --> 01:37:30.197]  Go ahead.
[01:37:30.197 --> 01:37:30.958]  Hello.
[01:37:30.958 --> 01:37:41.526]  I'm curious about the hardware end, and if future machines, since, you know, all AI would have to live on a machine, if they're going to use spin transistors and spintronics,
[01:37:42.569 --> 01:37:45.691]  I have no idea what exactly they're going to use.
[01:37:45.691 --> 01:37:48.393]  Quantum computing is believed to be the next step.
[01:37:48.393 --> 01:37:53.617]  Moore's Law is coming to its logical conclusion when it comes to standard transistors.
[01:37:53.617 --> 01:37:58.660]  There is a lot of research in developing the next paradigm to continue the Moore's Law.
[01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:08.647]  What exactly is going to be used in the next... Well, isn't it really genetic computers that are life form, human life or animal life based, where they then program it into the genetics?
[01:38:09.798 --> 01:38:13.019]  Well, there is genetic programming and genetic algorithms.
[01:38:13.019 --> 01:38:18.041]  They have not been terribly successful in creating truly intelligent systems.
[01:38:18.041 --> 01:38:34.828]  They are very good at optimizing different parameters for functions, so if you need to tweak arguments, those are excellent, but they have not been shown to be capable of sort of this evolutionary improvement from nothing to full-blown intelligence.
[01:38:34.828 --> 01:38:36.449]  Alright, anything else, Henry?
[01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:47.215]  I'm curious about if it would ever involve a space segment, especially with issues of relativistic timing.
[01:38:47.215 --> 01:38:53.699]  If there is ever technology which allows us to use what physicists say is a possibility of time travel, then...
[01:38:54.279 --> 01:38:59.501]  There are some technologies, some algorithms which incorporate this idea.
[01:38:59.501 --> 01:39:06.503]  I recently seen a paper which shows how NP-complete problems could be solved if you have access to a time travel device.
[01:39:06.503 --> 01:39:11.284]  But this is really well beyond what my comfort zone is in terms of science versus technology.
[01:39:11.884 --> 01:39:21.018]  But they did just what they've had a bunch of news tests come out where they have actually, just like Star Trek, beamed matter across distances, teleported it.
[01:39:21.018 --> 01:39:22.400]  Teleportation.
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:24.523]  They're now creating artificial black holes.
[01:39:24.523 --> 01:39:27.747]  I think it's only a matter of time until they do something in a lab and kill everybody.
[01:39:28.408 --> 01:39:30.230]  I just pray we don't destroy ourselves.
[01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:33.432]  Because folks, we are getting the fire of Prometheus here.
[01:39:33.432 --> 01:39:34.673]  This is not a joke.
[01:39:34.673 --> 01:39:35.294]  Thank you, Henry.
[01:39:35.294 --> 01:39:37.235]  Really good questions.
[01:39:37.235 --> 01:39:39.337]  Let's go to... Who's up next here?
[01:39:39.337 --> 01:39:40.838]  Woody in Washington.
[01:39:40.838 --> 01:39:41.499]  You're on the air.
[01:39:41.499 --> 01:39:41.899]  Go ahead.
[01:39:41.899 --> 01:39:42.580]  Yes.
[01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:43.300]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:44.962]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:39:44.962 --> 01:39:57.672]  My question for this gentleman is, with this AI intelligence, how far away are we from the point where all of these systems could be integrated worldwide with the military
[01:39:58.263 --> 01:40:00.445]  That's a good question.
[01:40:00.445 --> 01:40:00.646]  Yeah.
[01:40:19.205 --> 01:40:22.488]  And I can add to that data with a big data point.
[01:40:22.488 --> 01:40:26.971]  The Pentagon within 10 years wants all combat aircraft, drone, helicopters, everything.
[01:40:26.971 --> 01:40:29.512]  Only transports will be human.
[01:40:29.512 --> 01:40:31.694]  And those will be computer backup.
[01:40:31.694 --> 01:40:34.616]  Most of the ground force within 10 years will be combat robots.
[01:40:34.616 --> 01:40:35.777]  That's now been declassified.
[01:40:35.777 --> 01:40:37.498]  And they've got a bunch of them that are really scary.
[01:40:37.498 --> 01:40:40.140]  They haven't rolled out to the public because they don't want to freak people out yet.
[01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:42.001]  But I've talked to high-level military.
[01:40:42.001 --> 01:40:48.086]  And so within 10 years, the machines, if they took over, most of the big militaries are going to be robot and drone.
[01:40:49.847 --> 01:40:53.070]  It is the Terminator scenario, if they wanted to kill us that way.
[01:40:53.070 --> 01:41:01.378]  Doctor, did you want to make any other points on the gentleman talking about the military being in a position to be taken over by AI?
[01:41:01.378 --> 01:41:09.125]  I mean, the numbers they admit as we're talking 10 years and almost everything is going to be drone or combat robot tanks.
[01:41:11.287 --> 01:41:11.927]  Uh, all of it.
[01:41:11.927 --> 01:41:13.788]  I mean, they don't need sleep.
[01:41:13.788 --> 01:41:14.709]  Uh, they never stop.
[01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:17.950]  They're worked on by robots that are delivered, you know, in robot ships.
[01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:21.172]  They've got some technicians on board in case there's problems.
[01:41:21.172 --> 01:41:24.433]  But that's what this is all going towards, the total automation.
[01:41:24.433 --> 01:41:24.753]  Right.
[01:41:24.753 --> 01:41:30.956]  In addition to the technology itself being dangerous, there's also the possibility of human hackers taking over.
[01:41:30.956 --> 01:41:32.957]  We saw a U.S.
[01:41:32.957 --> 01:41:35.158]  drone being taken over by Iranians.
[01:41:35.729 --> 01:41:44.814]  If the same thing happens with more capable controllers and they try to use the same technologies against us, that would really backfire, so...
[01:41:45.484 --> 01:41:51.949]  There's quite a few scenarios we need to think about before developing and deploying those technologies.
[01:41:51.949 --> 01:42:03.437]  I agree with you that this all needs to be basically heavily restricted immediately because the probability is it's going to cause disaster.
[01:42:03.437 --> 01:42:05.499]  And I'm all for technological development.
[01:42:06.079 --> 01:42:11.962]  And I know the system shuts down things that are disruptive to the economy, like freer forms of energy and things.
[01:42:11.962 --> 01:42:13.403]  I don't think that should be restricted.
[01:42:13.403 --> 01:42:24.888]  But AI systems, super high-powered antimatter weapons the Air Force admits they're developing, all this type of stuff, it just needs to be restricted.
[01:42:25.248 --> 01:42:27.769]  Well, you talked about it modeling people's brains.
[01:42:27.769 --> 01:42:29.929]  A lot of the most promising stuff are these interfaces.
[01:42:29.929 --> 01:42:32.890]  That's why I'm saying you could actually get some human traits.
[01:42:32.890 --> 01:42:44.874]  If the model it builds from, at its kernel or base, is a human mind, it could get some of the good traits of emotion or bad, but that inter- just, again, I'm not a computer scientist like you are.
[01:42:44.874 --> 01:42:51.856]  I just, if it's modeling off humans and being programmed by the technocrats, a lot of them who are completely out of their minds, I don't know what these things are going to be like.
[01:42:52.296 --> 01:42:58.922]  It's a very good question, and it's important to know whose brain are we scanning, whose model are we creating to be that powerful.
[01:42:58.922 --> 01:43:01.644]  So, that's another unanswered question.
[01:43:01.644 --> 01:43:02.185]  Exactly.
[01:43:02.185 --> 01:43:07.509]  If it was Mother Teresa or something, that might not be a problem, but what if it's some... It still could be a problem.
[01:43:07.509 --> 01:43:09.271]  Great power corrupts absolutely.
[01:43:09.271 --> 01:43:14.775]  So, I wouldn't trust any person to have that kind of capabilities.
[01:43:14.775 --> 01:43:16.077]  I agree with you.
[01:43:16.077 --> 01:43:17.978]  Let's talk to Hector in New Jersey.
[01:43:17.978 --> 01:43:18.539]  You're on the air.
[01:43:19.319 --> 01:43:32.923]  Alex, I just want to tell you about what my professor revealed to us, talking about the dimensions of a supercomputer that exists right now currently in Alaska, which dovetails almost perfectly with what Nick Begich has been saying.
[01:43:32.923 --> 01:43:43.206]  He said that it was actually the size of the state of New Jersey and that it was aware of itself already, existing right now in the current time.
[01:43:43.206 --> 01:43:45.627]  It's the paradigm destroyer.
[01:43:45.627 --> 01:43:47.788]  What do you mean, a computer the size of New Jersey?
[01:43:48.732 --> 01:43:59.285]  This man, this professor, went on to, in his lecture, reveal to all of us, which most of them were acting like potted plants, uh, my, these fellow students... Stay there, I wanna hear the name and details.
[01:44:02.048 --> 01:44:03.729]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:44:03.729 --> 01:44:09.051]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:44:09.051 --> 01:44:10.571]  Saving means to make money.
[01:44:10.571 --> 01:44:19.355]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:44:20.095 --> 01:44:27.637]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:44:27.637 --> 01:44:35.639]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:44:35.639 --> 01:44:40.861]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:45:00.652 --> 01:45:07.876]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[01:45:07.876 --> 01:45:25.767]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:45:25.767 --> 01:45:29.869]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:31.910]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:40.076]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:45:40.076 --> 01:45:46.400]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:47.661]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:45:47.661 --> 01:45:48.541]  It's incredible.

[01:46:00.530 --> 01:46:01.831]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:46:01.831 --> 01:46:07.418]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:46:07.418 --> 01:46:12.444]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:46:12.444 --> 01:46:12.924]  It's true.
[01:46:12.924 --> 01:46:17.490]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:46:18.010 --> 01:46:23.232]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:46:23.232 --> 01:46:25.553]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:46:25.553 --> 01:46:30.335]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:46:30.335 --> 01:46:31.455]  And here's the best part.
[01:46:31.455 --> 01:46:34.537]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:46:34.537 --> 01:46:37.818]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:46:38.138 --> 01:46:41.341]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:46:41.341 --> 01:46:43.563]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:46:44.504 --> 01:46:44.744]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:46:44.744 --> 01:46:48.147]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:46:48.147 --> 01:46:49.869]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:47:01.087 --> 01:47:16.566]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:47:16.566 --> 01:47:20.250]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:47:21.246 --> 01:47:34.018]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:47:34.018 --> 01:47:41.285]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:47:41.966 --> 01:47:52.329]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:47:52.329 --> 01:47:56.251]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.

[01:48:01.812 --> 01:48:08.615]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:26.763]  Meow, meow, meow, meow.
[01:48:26.763 --> 01:48:29.164]  Meow, meow, meow.
[01:48:29.164 --> 01:48:31.566]  I love me some Daft Punk.
[01:48:31.566 --> 01:48:35.389]  That is some gravy on the ears.
[01:48:35.389 --> 01:48:38.591]  Like a chicken fried steak deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:48:38.591 --> 01:48:50.259]  Speaking of a chicken fried steak deep in the heart of Texas, a great patriot who loves Ron Paul and loves the Constitution, Congressman Walter Jones of the great state of North Carolina.
[01:48:51.724 --> 01:49:01.168]  He was on the show Friday, and I don't normally re-air stuff on the Sunday show that I had on Friday, but we got some stations that carry the Sunday show that don't carry the weekday show.
[01:49:01.168 --> 01:49:06.211]  11 to 2, centralinfoworks.com, XM channel 166, little plug there.
[01:49:06.211 --> 01:49:08.432]  Other different ways you can hear us.
[01:49:08.432 --> 01:49:09.452]  This is powerful.
[01:49:09.452 --> 01:49:10.953]  He's introduced legislation.
[01:49:11.593 --> 01:49:15.176]  That if Obama or any other president starts launching wars under U.N.
[01:49:15.176 --> 01:49:23.744]  orders without congressional approval that violates Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11, that we're going to impeach his hind end!
[01:49:23.744 --> 01:49:34.012]  So I give you Walter Jones, District 3 Congressman from North Carolina on my show Sunday.
[01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:44.874]  Sir, thank you very much for joining us and introducing legislation to hold any president accountable if they try to launch wars without congressional approval.
[01:49:44.874 --> 01:49:46.034]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:49:46.034 --> 01:49:47.215]  Well, Alex, thank you.
[01:49:47.215 --> 01:49:48.575]  My concern goes back.
[01:49:48.575 --> 01:49:54.338]  The initial concern was when President Clinton decided to bomb Bosnia without approval of Congress.
[01:49:54.338 --> 01:49:59.220]  I joined 31 members of the House, three Democrats and 28 Republicans.
[01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:02.381]  I joined Congressman at the time, Tom Campbell,
[01:50:03.061 --> 01:50:06.904]  Who now is a constitutional law professor at Stanford University.
[01:50:06.904 --> 01:50:11.467]  We went to the federal courts by saying that the President had bypassed Congress.
[01:50:11.467 --> 01:50:18.052]  And the courts did not take the lawsuit because they said, well, you and Congress have the authority to cut the budgets.
[01:50:18.052 --> 01:50:26.739]  And I mention that, Alex, because that's always difficult for members to cut the funding for war because they don't want to leave the kids over there without adequate equipment.
[01:50:27.399 --> 01:50:38.026]  And then, when Mr. Obama went into Libya and he bypassed Congress, except he did say that he has spoken to the leadership, well that made me even more anxious.
[01:50:38.026 --> 01:50:43.069]  I joined Dennis Kucinich and Jonathan Turley, who's a constitutional lawyer at George Washington University.
[01:50:43.069 --> 01:50:44.350]  We went back to the courts.
[01:50:45.231 --> 01:50:51.337]  The courts did not accept by using the same position where you have the authority to cut the funding.
[01:50:51.337 --> 01:50:53.058]  Well that never happens.
[01:50:53.058 --> 01:51:03.789]  I've been so anxious and upset that we in Congress, we never get a chance to debate the policy of should we still be in war or not in war.
[01:51:03.789 --> 01:51:05.110]  So I decided to put this
[01:51:05.630 --> 01:51:06.571]  We're good to go.
[01:51:25.706 --> 01:51:30.232]  When we went into Iraq, which was an unnecessary war, I came out against it.
[01:51:30.232 --> 01:51:35.778]  And Vice President Cheney made this statement that I want to read to your listeners.
[01:51:35.778 --> 01:51:40.604]  The President does not need authorization from Congress before launching a military offensive.
[01:51:40.604 --> 01:51:43.728]  That was Dick Cheney during the President George Bush
[01:51:44.348 --> 01:51:50.536]  Now let me read to you a candidate, Senator Obama, in 2007, and these are his words.
[01:52:03.812 --> 01:52:07.095]  That's exactly what I'm saying with this resolution.
[01:52:07.095 --> 01:52:15.042]  If we're attacked, then the President does have the authority based on the Constitution, but he does not have the constitutional power just to make a decision.
[01:52:15.042 --> 01:52:19.525]  Well, I don't like the dictator in Libya, so we're going to go there and bomb him.
[01:52:19.525 --> 01:52:26.992]  I mean, we need to go back to the Constitution, and this will help Congress be more involved in the debate when we go to war.
[01:52:27.403 --> 01:52:29.204]  Well said, Congressman.
[01:52:29.204 --> 01:52:43.752]  Of course, Senator Sessions said that he almost lost his breath whenever he kept saying to Panetta over and over again, the Secretary of Defense last week, Sir, you know Congress is over the war powers and you do need our authorization.
[01:52:44.412 --> 01:52:47.735]  And Panetta would say, no, we get that from the UN.
[01:52:47.735 --> 01:52:54.079]  So for me, this is beyond the constitutional question of a president launching wars without congressional approval.
[01:52:54.079 --> 01:52:55.160]  We know that's a high crime.
[01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:56.421]  It's in the Constitution.
[01:52:56.421 --> 01:52:58.663]  A five-year-old that can read can see that.
[01:52:58.663 --> 01:53:00.084]  That's a no-brainer.
[01:53:00.084 --> 01:53:02.246]  Because why even have Congress if that's the case?
[01:53:02.246 --> 01:53:05.148]  If the president can do whatever he wants, you've got to have checks and balances.
[01:53:05.148 --> 01:53:12.994]  But to go further and say we're getting the authority from foreign governments in the UN, I mean, that's like being a foreign agent of a foreign power, sir.
[01:53:13.877 --> 01:53:15.760]  Alex, it is not acceptable.
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:21.768]  We have a Constitution like we have a Bible, and the Constitution says that Congress will declare war.
[01:53:22.597 --> 01:53:32.204]  That is why I've been so upset, and I mentioned to you just a moment ago, my history on this whole issue that went back to President Clinton in Bosnia in 1999.
[01:53:32.204 --> 01:53:37.948]  For too long, Congress has been a spectator in the debate on war.
[01:53:37.948 --> 01:53:47.695]  And when you see the amount of money that we spend, and more important than the money, the number of kids who have died and lost their legs, their arms, the American people should get behind.
[01:53:47.695 --> 01:53:50.477]  And I'm pleased to tell you today, I was honored to be on your show.
[01:53:51.283 --> 01:54:01.931]  That we have had calls since Friday of last week that we have heard from people in 49 different states who have called and said, thank you, Congressman Jones.
[01:54:01.931 --> 01:54:05.934]  We want to help you get this resolution to the floor of the House and get this thing passed.
[01:54:06.710 --> 01:54:09.151]  And I want to thank you again for this opportunity.
[01:54:23.937 --> 01:54:24.757]  I don't need you.
[01:54:24.757 --> 01:54:29.059]  I don't have to look at the constitutional question was a quote on TV, but his letter said it.
[01:54:29.059 --> 01:54:32.220]  I have the UN and I'm doing this for their credibility.
[01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:33.121]  That's a quote.
[01:54:33.121 --> 01:54:38.143]  So he's saying I'm stating and setting the precedent that the UN is the boss.
[01:54:38.143 --> 01:54:42.604]  The Congress has been handing over its authority, but still doesn't mean that it's legitimate.
[01:54:42.604 --> 01:54:44.665]  So and I'm not criticizing what you've done.
[01:54:44.665 --> 01:54:45.846]  It's measured.
[01:54:45.846 --> 01:54:50.607]  You're saying, hey, do it again or if another president does it, period, we're going to start impeachment.
[01:54:50.607 --> 01:54:51.128]  But what about
[01:54:52.128 --> 01:55:08.019]  Somebody like Ron Paul, wouldn't that be a good constitutional move but also a campaign move for say Ron Paul to try to introduce articles of impeachment for the Libya fiasco which they now admit has been a disaster and given Al Qaeda footholds in areas of Libya.
[01:55:08.956 --> 01:55:11.538]  Well I have publicly endorsed Ron Paul.
[01:55:11.538 --> 01:55:18.765]  I am a big supporter of Ron Paul's and I do agree with him totally and you made mention of this.
[01:55:18.765 --> 01:55:26.972]  What happened was our own Republican leadership, Alex, would not allow even a weak resolution to condemn
[01:55:27.672 --> 01:55:32.057]  What the President had done in Libya, he would allow Republicans to bring it to the floor.
[01:55:32.057 --> 01:55:40.665]  I was so disappointed in our leadership, Republican leadership, because they just sat back, sat back, and like I was saying a while ago, they became spectators.
[01:55:40.665 --> 01:55:45.930]  We have got to fight to defend the constitutional right of the Congress to declare war.
[01:55:45.930 --> 01:55:48.172]  And this is a step in that direction.
[01:55:48.172 --> 01:55:51.816]  We will get a hearing, I hope, I hope, in the Judiciary Committee.
[01:55:52.436 --> 01:56:02.104]  I know that the Judiciary Committee chaired by Congressman Lamar Spear from Texas, who's a fine man, and the Ranking Member, who's a fine man, John Conyers.
[01:56:02.104 --> 01:56:06.408]  And we need to hold a hearing on this whole issue of Congress and war.
[01:56:06.408 --> 01:56:07.369]  And this is a start.
[01:56:07.369 --> 01:56:10.451]  This resolution is a major step in that direction.
[01:56:10.451 --> 01:56:12.253]  Well said, Congressman.
[01:56:12.253 --> 01:56:17.357]  What can we do to help move this legislation through the House and get it passed?
[01:56:18.234 --> 01:56:36.662]  If your listeners would call their members of the United States House of Representatives, and I hope soon we'll have a Senate Senator to introduce the same legislation, but right now, if your listeners would call their members of Congress and say, please co-sponsor H. Klein Resolution 107,
[01:56:38.639 --> 01:56:52.918]  All they have to do is to call their member of Congress or email them or fax them and just say, please join in this house effort to bring back the constitutional authority of Congress to be involved when it comes to debating war.
[01:56:53.684 --> 01:56:55.225]  And that's what they need to do.
[01:56:55.225 --> 01:57:02.650]  And I can honestly tell you, we had a person yesterday that was in the Greenville office, Greenville, North Carolina, and a gentleman called from Colorado and said,
[01:57:24.164 --> 01:57:46.196]  Again, we're talking to Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina, and I'm glad people are calling and thanking him, but I think what's more important is to call the head of the Judiciary Committee, to ask them to get behind it and start promoting it, to call the media and say, don't black this out, and to call people like Senator Rand Paul and say, look, you've talked a lot about this war power issue.
[01:57:46.196 --> 01:57:47.077]  Your father has.
[01:57:47.637 --> 01:57:51.059]  You need to co-sponsor this immediately in the Senate.
[01:57:51.059 --> 01:57:53.941]  I would imagine that Senator DeMint would want to get behind this.
[01:57:53.941 --> 01:58:00.405]  I would imagine that Senator Sessions, who was so flabbergasted, Congressman, would want to get behind this right now.
[01:58:00.868 --> 01:58:02.909]  Well, I'm going to reach out to him Monday.
[01:58:02.909 --> 01:58:04.429]  We will be back in Washington.
[01:58:04.429 --> 01:58:10.251]  I've already asked my staff to call his office to see if he could give me 10 minutes by telephone.
[01:58:10.251 --> 01:58:14.773]  I think he will see the value of trying to introduce us on the Senate side.
[01:58:14.773 --> 01:58:16.333]  And let's debate this issue.
[01:58:16.333 --> 01:58:24.216]  It is time for Congress to get out of the stands and get on the field when we talk about sending our young men and women to die.
[01:58:24.216 --> 01:58:26.197]  Alright, partners, that's it for this
[01:58:28.146 --> 01:58:30.748]  March 18th, 2012, Sunday edition.

[01:59:51.292 --> 01:59:52.353]  I had tried everything.
[01:59:52.353 --> 01:59:54.736]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:59:54.736 --> 01:59:57.840]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:02.686]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:00:02.686 --> 02:00:09.054]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:00:09.534 --> 02:00:20.763]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
