[00:00.000 --> 00:16.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.680 --> 00:46.120]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:47.640 --> 00:56.320]  to watch the media call President Trump a liar or question everything he says
[00:56.320 --> 01:04.480]  and everything he does when it's the known liars the known discredited groups
[01:04.480 --> 01:08.600]  that are the ones doing the questioning. Charlie Wurzel who's the person Wurzel
[01:08.600 --> 01:13.880]  who the reporter actually did the story confesses in his write-up about why he
[01:13.880 --> 01:17.120]  did it but he actually didn't get much out of the article the interview the guy
[01:17.120 --> 01:21.200]  several times he didn't connect any dots and sometimes and he didn't kill the
[01:21.200 --> 01:25.680]  story right he still did it anyway and this focus on the appearance on where
[01:25.680 --> 01:29.480]  he's shopping it did feel almost like it should be in the fashion section of the
[01:29.480 --> 01:34.680]  paper and I maybe you can explain to me why that needs to be even done yeah you
[01:34.680 --> 01:38.120]  know sometimes it's okay to kill stories even when you send someone to a few
[01:38.120 --> 01:40.680]  states away and you come back and you say I didn't get it and you killed the
[01:40.680 --> 01:44.200]  story yeah if this had happened in a vacuum people say well the New York Times
[01:44.200 --> 01:49.200]  took a swing and a miss and they missed and okay so what this is part of a very
[01:49.200 --> 01:54.520]  larger story for last 12 months and the DC press led by the New York Times has
[01:54.520 --> 01:59.720]  been obsessed with humanizing celebrating normalizing Trump voters and
[01:59.720 --> 02:03.440]  they've gotten so far to the right now they're trying to normalize Nazis give
[02:03.440 --> 02:07.840]  us a question don't be a question I'm not gonna give you a question you
[02:07.840 --> 02:14.320]  state character you are fake news sir go ahead when he gets told out of
[02:14.320 --> 02:18.280]  Harvard study showing millions of illegal voted he goes and looks into it
[02:18.280 --> 02:22.600]  finds out it's true I mean that's what Trump does you notice will be on the
[02:22.600 --> 02:25.400]  campaign trail people are handing him stuff or he'll he'll start writing things
[02:25.400 --> 02:30.760]  down just talking to an old black lady or old white guy or young woman you see
[02:30.760 --> 02:37.920]  Trump writing things down he's obsessed with what people tell him at his hotels
[02:37.920 --> 02:41.760]  in his condos Trump routinely would just walk around for hours and just write
[02:41.760 --> 02:45.240]  down what people think and what they say and then blow up at people about you
[02:45.240 --> 02:48.320]  didn't do this you didn't do that you didn't respond fast enough when their
[02:48.320 --> 02:54.480]  water heater was out I was reading a story years ago years ago I was first
[02:54.480 --> 02:57.640]  looking into Trump about Trump when he had a new hotel opening he went through
[02:57.640 --> 03:01.240]  every hotel room in the building because he'd paid for a white and black
[03:01.240 --> 03:07.160]  marble and sure enough he had a feeling that they might and on a few of the
[03:07.160 --> 03:14.680]  smaller rooms and side areas they had cheap green quote Chinese is what the
[03:14.680 --> 03:22.240]  quote was marble and he blew up and he said that's not the armoires I paid
[03:22.240 --> 03:25.760]  for and that's not the marble I paid for he goes and my customers are gonna
[03:25.760 --> 03:32.080]  get the white marble and then the point is is that he's the type of OCD when it
[03:32.080 --> 03:36.400]  comes to details that we need and the fact that he's listing the people isn't
[03:36.400 --> 03:40.240]  some negative thing he wants to actually hear what you're saying and what's
[03:40.240 --> 03:43.560]  going on with you so it's not like something special that I've told Trump
[03:43.560 --> 03:46.440]  stuff he's gone and looked into it and then when he found that it was true
[03:46.440 --> 03:52.160]  responded because he does that on the campaign trail you'll see him talking
[03:52.160 --> 03:56.800]  to somebody he'll go pulls out a yellow pad with a marker and starts writing on
[03:56.800 --> 04:01.520]  it and he'll just have pockets full of it he gets on his jet and then just pulls
[04:01.520 --> 04:04.880]  him out and starts looking at it and then talks to an aide has them go look it
[04:04.880 --> 04:09.280]  up for him and bring it back to him it's not just people bringing the president
[04:09.280 --> 04:12.920]  news clippings he says I want this looked into I want that looked into I
[04:12.920 --> 04:16.840]  want this looked into I want that looked into until two in the morning most
[04:16.840 --> 04:23.400]  nice he's in there checking stuff now we kick off the main broadcast here in
[04:23.400 --> 04:27.040]  just a few minutes boy there is a lot to get into obviously in so many video
[04:27.040 --> 04:33.640]  clips and a breakdown as well but the mainstream media is back their usual
[04:33.640 --> 04:38.560]  tricks with their fake news attacking info wars this has been running a whole
[04:38.560 --> 04:43.200]  bunch of newspapers today Alex Jones suggests the Vegas mass shooting was
[04:43.200 --> 04:49.840]  fake no I didn't I said it was real but the official story is as funny as the
[04:49.840 --> 04:54.360]  $3 bill these people are really getting desperate and it's amazing to watch these
[04:54.360 --> 05:03.040]  con artists flounder I'm so excited the new product info wars life calm in a
[05:03.040 --> 05:08.120]  glass bottle two month servings filled to the brim filled to the absolute top
[05:08.120 --> 05:14.560]  the real red pill this is a heart and brain pill a new tropic but doesn't have
[05:14.560 --> 05:18.560]  any stimulus in it but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that
[05:18.560 --> 05:24.360]  quite frankly I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their
[05:24.360 --> 05:28.040]  patients but it wasn't prescription but they were charging people a hundred two
[05:28.040 --> 05:33.200]  hundred dollars for the formulae and I came up with our own formula working with
[05:33.200 --> 05:40.000]  scientists and developers non-gmo made right here in America 120 capsules and
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.880]  ladies and gentlemen you add the preglin own to it which is the precursor to all
[05:44.880 --> 05:48.600]  the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands
[05:48.600 --> 05:55.920]  it is amazing red pill now available at info wars store.com and your purchase
[05:55.920 --> 06:04.000]  funds the operation language and sequences some viewers may find
[06:04.000 --> 06:06.520]  disturbing
[06:06.520 --> 06:13.800]  the nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to Stumb or be
[06:13.800 --> 06:33.800]  called to Stumb and the Russian Stumb. Please listen if you don't if you want if you fail to understand then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you.
[06:33.800 --> 06:44.800]  The function of all life is survival. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.
[06:44.800 --> 06:54.800]  They're coming. They're coming. Help. Help. They're coming. They're coming. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me.
[06:54.800 --> 07:06.800]  Please. Please. Your next one in danger. Please listen to me. Something terrible. Please. Your next here they are. They're already here. Help. Your next. They're coming. They're coming.
[07:06.800 --> 07:13.800]  Mr. Dunzo. Sleep. The seed is planted. Sleep. Sleep. Terror. Grows.
[07:13.800 --> 07:18.800]  Elizabeth wake up. Get you when you sleep. Sit up.
[07:18.800 --> 07:21.800]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[07:21.800 --> 07:25.800]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites. Is it contagious?
[07:25.800 --> 07:27.800]  Real homies.
[07:27.800 --> 07:29.800]  It looks right at me.
[07:29.800 --> 07:33.800]  You're looking at it as if it was human. It was not human.
[07:33.800 --> 07:37.800]  Now the classic fear begins to grow.
[07:37.800 --> 07:39.800]  We're being cornered.
[07:39.800 --> 07:42.800]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[07:42.800 --> 07:45.800]  You're barricading the street.
[07:45.800 --> 07:48.800]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[07:48.800 --> 07:51.800]  To the land of the walking dead.
[07:51.800 --> 08:19.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're here live broadcasting worldwide.
[08:19.940 --> 08:23.740]  I am your host, Alex Jones. We're going to be live here for the next four hours and
[08:23.740 --> 08:29.880]  Paul Joseph Watson is also going to be hosting the fourth hour. Former board
[08:29.880 --> 08:33.880]  member and one of the founding members of the Davos group, Ted Malik is going to
[08:33.880 --> 08:38.120]  be joining us to talk about the accelerated collapse of the corporate
[08:38.120 --> 08:44.160]  world government and the fact that the neoliberal world government system is an
[08:44.160 --> 08:50.520]  authoritarian monster that is now in full retreat. Despite all the PR pieces they
[08:50.520 --> 08:54.580]  put out, they've got a new push going with the New York Times, the Washington
[08:54.580 --> 09:00.800]  Post, Wall Street Journal, the LA Times, Atlantic Monthly, all the usual
[09:00.800 --> 09:08.520]  suspects operating, of course, along with Keith Oberman and others, announcing
[09:08.520 --> 09:14.440]  victory, that Trump is a Russian agent, that America's recovery is a Russian
[09:14.440 --> 09:20.600]  plot, that taking care of our veterans is a Russian operation, and that Flynn is
[09:20.600 --> 09:25.920]  turning against Trump, and that Trump is going to be out of office very, very soon.
[09:25.920 --> 09:32.440]  This is their big push with Robert Mueller up to his eyeballs in real Russian
[09:32.440 --> 09:38.800]  collusion, as well as Communist Chinese, you name it, all of that coming out, but
[09:38.800 --> 09:44.160]  despite that they are doubling down. There's all these articles in the New
[09:44.160 --> 09:48.720]  York Times, you name it, Trump and Russia seem to find common foe, the American
[09:48.720 --> 09:53.780]  press. It's not American press, it's globalist press that hates Christians,
[09:53.780 --> 09:58.520]  hates conservatives, hates gun owners, hates America, hates our veterans, hates
[09:58.520 --> 10:03.480]  free market, they're monopoly men. I got a stack of articles today with CNN,
[10:03.480 --> 10:08.320]  MSNBC, pundits, bad-mouthing, flyover America, saying rural communities are
[10:08.320 --> 10:13.400]  terrorist, rural communities are bad, that Republicans have got to be locked up
[10:13.400 --> 10:17.960]  once they take control of the government again, because they know there's an
[10:17.960 --> 10:22.840]  awakening to them, they know their slow stranglehold that they had around our
[10:22.840 --> 10:28.320]  throat has been loosened as we attempt to struggle free, and so they're now in a
[10:28.320 --> 10:33.080]  panic mode to force us back into submission, but that's not working either.
[10:33.080 --> 10:38.960]  So this outside globalist force that destroys nation-states has also seen
[10:38.960 --> 10:44.480]  Russia struggle free, so the only truth in Russian collusion is that as nation-states
[10:44.480 --> 10:52.080]  we're trying to escape the same Hydra, the same spider, the same snake. Odds are
[10:52.080 --> 10:59.400]  Russia owns Trump. Michael Goldberg says, well if Michael Goldberg in the Mexican
[10:59.400 --> 11:06.880]  kingpin owned New York Times says so, and Iraq has WMDs, right, and uranium
[11:06.880 --> 11:16.280]  yellow cake, right? Mm-hmm, and there was a 97% chance that Hillary was gonna win
[11:16.280 --> 11:24.440]  to the New York Times. Odds are, Russia owns Trump, owns him, never built any
[11:24.440 --> 11:33.960]  buildings in Russia, did have a beauty pageant there, he owns them. So let's
[11:33.960 --> 11:40.120]  continue, ladies and gentlemen, former IC Watchdog, Hillary Clinton was reckless
[11:40.120 --> 11:47.560]  and compromised national security threatened to fire me if I reported
[11:47.560 --> 11:53.600]  concerns about her and personal blowback to my family. So the dam is breaking,
[11:53.600 --> 11:59.600]  we're gonna cover this when we come back from break. This is a big deal and the
[11:59.600 --> 12:05.000]  dam is breaking, so that's coming up in the next segment. Also a very powerful
[12:05.000 --> 12:11.300]  video is on newswars.com and the reason Macron who's been somewhat of a
[12:11.300 --> 12:15.320]  globalist is having to sound like a nationalist is that's sweeping Europe,
[12:15.320 --> 12:21.200]  Merkel's losing power, they're all losing power, started in Eastern Europe and
[12:21.200 --> 12:26.440]  the Brexit in the UK, now it's sweeping Europe with nationalism and self
[12:26.440 --> 12:30.960]  determination and common sense and survival mechanisms, survival instincts
[12:30.960 --> 12:39.040]  kicking back in. Macron is out in a crowd in Paris and a woman comes over
[12:39.040 --> 12:44.160]  complaining that more people can't come into the country when France has been
[12:44.160 --> 12:47.880]  completely flooded with millions and millions of refugees just in the last
[12:47.880 --> 12:53.320]  few years and he says go back to Morocco and he says you're not facing
[12:53.320 --> 13:01.200]  danger, don't say you are, no one's hurting you in Morocco and it's
[13:01.200 --> 13:06.480]  just made up bull. So we're gonna get to that and of course I
[13:06.480 --> 13:10.440]  mentioned this article earlier, there's video, MSNBC host declares rule
[13:10.440 --> 13:21.600]  voters core threat to our democracy, a core threat. So voters are a threat to
[13:21.600 --> 13:29.160]  democracy, voting is a threat to voting so that's the type of garbage that
[13:29.160 --> 13:35.480]  they're spewing so that's gonna be coming up as well plus at the bottom of
[13:35.480 --> 13:46.040]  the next hour I'm going to premiere a shocking special report that is truly
[13:46.040 --> 13:55.200]  disgusting and I'm not gonna break it until then it deals with Disney. We all
[13:55.200 --> 14:02.480]  know about Disney and how they hired people to be directors for children's
[14:02.480 --> 14:07.520]  movies who were convicted child rapists. We all know about Harvey Weinstein being
[14:07.520 --> 14:13.200]  involved with Disney and the hiring of that rapist. We all know about their
[14:13.200 --> 14:17.440]  history of sexualizing children and putting sexual messages and images in
[14:17.440 --> 14:27.320]  their films but we have shocking public evidence of sexualization of children
[14:27.320 --> 14:34.120]  and their agenda that we will show you here coming up at the bottom of the
[14:34.120 --> 14:41.160]  next hour so that's coming up as well. The new public enemy number one besides
[14:41.160 --> 14:44.480]  Trump and myself is now Sean Hannity they're moving to get him kicked off
[14:44.480 --> 14:50.880]  air. We're gonna break that down big New York Times piece also Facebook rolls
[14:50.880 --> 14:56.800]  out AI to detect suicidal posts before they're reported. Now we're in the middle
[14:56.800 --> 15:00.960]  of a special 34-hour broadcast I'm here every day 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central in
[15:00.960 --> 15:04.360]  the War Room comes up with Owen Schreuer before that you got the David
[15:04.360 --> 15:14.200]  Night Show with David Knight where you get tomorrow's news today. I want to

[15:17.600 --> 15:22.000]  you can do to reach new people is to take the live feeds from infowars.com
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.640]  forward slash show or on Facebook or on YouTube or on Twitter and share those on
[15:26.640 --> 15:30.440]  your Facebook share those on your Twitter and and that's a serious act of
[15:30.440 --> 15:33.840]  rebellion against the globalist because they block us with AI systems but they
[15:33.840 --> 15:42.280]  can't stop you hand-sharing the articles they can't stop you sending them out on
[15:42.280 --> 15:46.800]  your email or showing people at work during lunch or or or after work that's
[15:46.800 --> 15:50.920]  how we win this information war they're trying to smother this awakening it's
[15:50.920 --> 15:55.320]  failing but it's still a serious fight so please share the live links to the
[15:55.320 --> 16:02.280]  show until folks put local stations. Hello Mr. Anderson the NSA has noticed how

[17:55.920 --> 18:04.600]  season. Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors
[18:04.600 --> 18:08.840]  would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to
[18:08.840 --> 18:14.680]  organize and prepare a defense. Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were
[18:14.680 --> 18:20.280]  approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens. But
[18:20.280 --> 18:24.400]  in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[18:24.400 --> 18:28.680]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that
[18:28.680 --> 18:33.200]  destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey
[18:33.200 --> 18:38.440]  towards death. I personally counter this on-slaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex
[18:38.440 --> 18:44.440]  is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic
[18:44.440 --> 18:49.600]  foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body. Discover why
[18:49.600 --> 18:53.520]  Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies
[18:53.520 --> 18:57.800]  back in our own hands, and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with Anthroplex.
[18:57.800 --> 19:01.560]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally,
[19:01.560 --> 19:07.320]  societally, economically, spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top
[19:07.320 --> 19:12.760]  of giant time bomb. With populations and globalism and the new world order's
[19:12.760 --> 19:17.800]  manipulation of people's minds, things are getting crazy. We're trying to fix the
[19:17.800 --> 19:21.760]  country and fix the planet. We've also got to have rearguard actions to be
[19:21.760 --> 19:25.400]  prepared. The number one thing, after getting right with God, is to have high
[19:25.400 --> 19:29.000]  quality, storeable food. Well, the entire line of my Patriot supply foods,
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.920]  private labeled as InfoWars Select, is now 50% off. I've only done that one time
[19:34.920 --> 19:40.360]  before previously. 50% off, you cannot beat that, and we're only doing that
[19:40.360 --> 19:44.680]  through Cyber Monday. So it starts today on Thanksgiving and runs through next
[19:44.680 --> 19:49.720]  Monday. InfoWarsStore.com, you can go right there. It's the full spectrum of my

[19:54.920 --> 19:58.600]  50% off. Take action today.
[19:59.120 --> 20:04.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:04.480 --> 20:20.040]  ROOFLESS! Globalists have used the American engine of free market and our
[20:20.040 --> 20:35.880]  military power to take over the planet. Now, their final target is our Republic.
[20:35.880 --> 20:42.440]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[20:42.440 --> 20:49.680]  Now, if we simply stop trusting the establishment, get back to tried and
[20:49.680 --> 20:55.440]  true, classic Americana systems of liberty and justice and transparency, and stop
[20:55.440 --> 21:01.480]  putting up with SJW brainwashing, we can get our country back and have a
[21:01.480 --> 21:07.720]  future. But if we don't, we continue to be victims of this system and follow the
[21:07.720 --> 21:12.640]  poison being put out by the mainstream media, we have absolutely no future.
[21:12.640 --> 21:16.480]  Let me get into this big news right now and then after I play the report, I'm
[21:16.480 --> 21:19.960]  going to get into more details of it here over the actual transcript and
[21:19.960 --> 21:25.600]  article that I've got right here. This is a report from Fox News. It's dead on
[21:25.600 --> 21:29.680]  accurate. You've got whistleblowers, you've got informants, you've got FBI
[21:29.680 --> 21:36.160]  agents, you've got counterterrorism experts that have all been gagged from
[21:36.160 --> 21:41.600]  being able to testify to Congress or be able to talk to the media about
[21:41.600 --> 21:47.520]  Robert Mueller and Hillary Clinton and the Uranium One deal and how there was a
[21:47.520 --> 21:51.440]  criminal investigation by the FBI that was killed by Mueller and then
[21:51.440 --> 21:58.320]  subsequently by Comey. Intel Watch Dogs says Clinton campaign planned to fire
[21:58.320 --> 22:05.400]  him over email probe, new Connors accusers and more. So we're going to be
[22:05.400 --> 22:09.840]  getting to all that. Charles McCullough, the former internal watchdog for the US
[22:09.840 --> 22:13.960]  intelligence community, investigated the Clinton top secret emails and when he
[22:13.960 --> 22:18.800]  went to Clapper a year before the presidential election, Clapper and the
[22:18.800 --> 22:26.880]  Clinton campaign ordered them to basically stand down and do not do
[22:26.880 --> 22:32.640]  anything and then threatened him and threatened his family. How incredible is
[22:32.640 --> 22:39.520]  this information? This is such a big big deal. So here is an excerpt of this
[22:39.520 --> 22:44.000]  really important report. Obama appointee in the federal government says he was
[22:44.000 --> 22:48.240]  marginalized and even threatened by his superior simply because he tried to raise
[22:48.240 --> 22:52.440]  the alarm about classified information that resided on Hillary Clinton's
[22:52.440 --> 22:58.080]  private email server. Our Catherine Harage has that exclusive tonight. It was
[22:58.080 --> 23:05.120]  personal blowback to me, to my family, to my office. Few people know more about the
[23:05.120 --> 23:08.520]  Clinton emails on the follow than Charles McCullough, the former internal
[23:08.520 --> 23:12.560]  watchdog for the US intelligence community. What should the American public
[23:12.560 --> 23:17.680]  know about those 22 top secret Clinton emails? I've heard people say this is
[23:17.680 --> 23:22.480]  overblown. I've heard people say this is much to do about nothing. Had the
[23:22.480 --> 23:26.360]  information been released, there would have been harm to national security. So
[23:26.360 --> 23:31.320]  putting lives at risk. Absolutely. Sources and methods, lives, operations.
[23:31.320 --> 23:35.840]  Speaking exclusively to Fox, McCullough says he went to director of national
[23:35.840 --> 23:40.240]  intelligence James Clapper about a year before the presidential election. The
[23:40.240 --> 23:43.680]  intelligence agencies had just found their classified information in the
[23:43.680 --> 23:48.280]  Clinton emails. He read through these affidavits very thoroughly and he said
[23:48.280 --> 23:52.960]  this is extremely reckless and he mentioned something about the campaign
[23:52.960 --> 23:57.640]  would have, will have heartburn about that or something. Shortly after,
[23:57.640 --> 24:01.960]  McCullough says his team was marginalized. You felt you were on your own in
[24:01.960 --> 24:07.600]  this. I was totally on my own and I was told by senior officials to keep the
[24:07.600 --> 24:13.000]  director out of it. You drafted this letter in January 2016. Sure did. In the
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.400]  letter, McCullough told Congress that emails beyond top secret passed through
[24:17.400 --> 24:21.440]  the former secretary of state's unsecured personal server. All of a sudden I
[24:21.440 --> 24:26.720]  became a shill of the right. I was told by members of Congress, be careful, you're
[24:26.720 --> 24:31.440]  losing your credibility. There are people out to get you. By February 2016, Clinton
[24:31.440 --> 24:36.200]  campaign emails released by WikiLeaks suggest McCullough was a target. I think
[24:36.200 --> 24:42.680]  there was certainly a coordinated strategy that I, in fact, I, I not only think
[24:42.680 --> 24:50.280]  it, I, I think it very, very much so. Based on evidence. Yes. Even though the FBI
[24:50.280 --> 24:54.880]  email investigation was far from complete, the Clinton campaign nailed down
[24:54.880 --> 24:59.640]  its talking points. Was there an effort to deliberately mislead the public about
[24:59.640 --> 25:03.720]  the classified emails? Absolutely. There was an effort on the, certainly on the
[25:03.720 --> 25:07.880]  part of the campaign to mislead people into thinking that there was nothing to
[25:07.880 --> 25:12.120]  see here. Frankly, the thing that disappointed me the most was the
[25:12.120 --> 25:16.320]  president saying there's classified and then there's classified. A lot of people
[25:16.320 --> 25:22.080]  in the Intel community spend a lot of time keeping secrets secret. And to
[25:22.080 --> 25:28.480]  sort of inject that sense of confusion into people I don't think was, was
[25:28.480 --> 25:33.000]  altogether responsible. As election day approached, McCullough says the threats
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.000]  went further, singling him out and another senior government email
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.400]  investigator. You were given a warning. It was told that we would be the first two
[25:42.400 --> 25:49.360]  to be fired with her administration that that was definitely going to happen. Is
[25:49.360 --> 25:54.200]  that how it's supposed to be? No, I was in this context a whistleblower. I was
[25:54.200 --> 25:58.000]  explaining to Congress, I was doing exactly what they had expected me to do
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.800]  and all of a sudden I was the enemy. More than 2,100 classified emails passed
[26:02.800 --> 26:08.120]  through Clinton's personal server and to this day, no one is accountable. If you
[26:08.120 --> 26:12.600]  had done this, what would have happened to you? I'd be sitting in Leavenworth right
[26:12.600 --> 26:17.200]  now. Fox News asked a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, the office of a senior
[26:17.200 --> 26:20.400]  Senate Democrat, as well as a former director of National Intelligence for
[26:20.400 --> 26:23.680]  comment, but there was no immediate response. McCullough recently retired
[26:23.680 --> 26:28.200]  after 26 years of government service. He told Fox News today that he is grateful
[26:28.200 --> 26:33.000]  now to tell his story, Tucker. And that. Wow, so good job to Tucker Carlson and
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.640]  Fox News because on its face when Hillary did was completely illegal. It was a
[26:37.640 --> 26:41.200]  drop box. She knew a bunch of countries had penetrated it. She'd put
[26:41.200 --> 26:44.000]  classified stuff in there they wanted. Then they would give money to her
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.840]  foundation, billions of dollars, billions of dollars to sell the country out on
[26:48.840 --> 26:56.000]  an mechanized organized crime level. And that's why Mueller's so desperate. It's
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.680]  why there's no making a compromise with these people. They're going to remove
[26:59.680 --> 27:03.480]  Trump. Mueller's going to make stuff up. They're going to threaten enough
[27:03.480 --> 27:08.320]  witnesses till somebody makes something up. They're not going to stop because
[27:08.320 --> 27:13.760]  their backs are against the wall. They have committed incredible crimes selling
[27:13.760 --> 27:17.240]  this country out and along comes a president that actually wants to
[27:17.240 --> 27:21.760]  empower the country and they don't know what to do. Along comes somebody that's
[27:21.760 --> 27:25.840]  gotten instant results in the economy and in so many other areas and they're
[27:25.840 --> 27:30.960]  panicking because they know soon if he's not gone and if he gets more of his
[27:30.960 --> 27:34.960]  agenda through the public is going to realize that they've been hoodwinked
[27:34.960 --> 27:43.320]  even those that were asleep and they are desperate right now to remove Trump
[27:43.320 --> 27:49.360]  and to remove the Republican members of the Freedom Caucus that have gotten into
[27:49.360 --> 27:54.880]  office so that they can again have federalized elections which they've put
[27:54.880 --> 27:58.440]  on the books. All 50 attorney generals including Democrats have written
[27:58.440 --> 28:02.680]  letters to Obama before he left and then to Congress and then to Trump saying
[28:02.680 --> 28:08.080]  please change this Obama executive order federalizing the elections in the
[28:08.080 --> 28:12.120]  future putting Homeland Security over the computers. We caught Hillary trying
[28:12.120 --> 28:17.920]  to steal six states. She did steal five states and they want to come in, overturn
[28:17.920 --> 28:22.360]  the election, overturn the other elections, federalize it under global
[28:22.360 --> 28:28.600]  control and the Democrats will be a permanent party. That's why Obermann's
[28:28.600 --> 28:31.720]  talking about how they're gonna overturn the whole election. That's why they've
[28:31.720 --> 28:36.240]  got MSNBC hosts saying once we get rid of Trump we're gonna overturn these
[28:36.240 --> 28:40.520]  elections and we're gonna arrest all the libertarian and conservative leaders.
[28:40.520 --> 28:46.960]  We're gonna put them in prison camps. That was on MSNBC two days ago. They mean
[28:46.960 --> 28:53.880]  business. We're facing a total committed criminal move. It's us or them, no holds
[28:53.880 --> 29:00.160]  barred, no quarter, absolute war. Hey Daniel Bremen, why new manna storeable

[29:58.440 --> 30:03.840]  America is an information-based civil war. That's why now more than ever we've
[30:03.840 --> 30:08.000]  got to hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not
[30:08.000 --> 30:12.600]  backing down from their bullies. We're only intensifying our operations in the
[30:12.600 --> 30:18.120]  face of their wannabe dictatorship. Being a conservative, a nationalist, a
[30:18.120 --> 30:23.360]  libertarian or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[30:23.360 --> 30:29.120]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism and
[30:29.120 --> 30:33.760]  pro-freedom who at the same time is tolerant. Modern liberalism is a
[30:33.760 --> 30:38.080]  counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's class of the liberalism. They are the
[30:38.080 --> 30:42.840]  anti-liberalists. To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends and promote
[30:42.840 --> 30:47.280]  freedom worldwide. We've got more than 60 original designs of high quality

[31:07.000 --> 31:11.880]  of giant time bomb. With populations and globalism and the
[31:11.880 --> 31:15.960]  new world order's manipulation of people's minds, things are getting crazy.
[31:15.960 --> 31:20.040]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet. We've also got to have
[31:20.040 --> 31:24.080]  rearguard actions to be prepared. The number one thing after getting right with
[31:24.080 --> 31:28.080]  God is to have high-quality, swindle food. While the entire line of my patriot

[32:04.040 --> 32:10.200]  are rolling out three new digestive gut aids. One of them is a powerful
[32:10.200 --> 32:15.320]  pro-digestive enzyme, carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other
[32:15.320 --> 32:21.640]  proteins better. And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic
[32:21.640 --> 32:27.120]  culture of the very best strains in fluorolive advanced restoration. And we
[32:27.120 --> 32:31.920]  also have an everyday, extremely affordable, fluorolive everyday maintenance.
[32:31.920 --> 32:38.320]  But all of these are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and
[32:38.320 --> 32:44.200]  digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price. That is my goal here,
[32:44.200 --> 32:49.080]  is to bring you the very best at the lowest price. When you purchase it at

[32:54.040 --> 32:58.520]  and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[32:58.520 --> 33:04.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:04.040 --> 33:26.160]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:26.160 --> 33:35.880]  Coming up, ladies and gentlemen, at the bottom of the next hour, one hour from
[33:35.880 --> 33:43.680]  now, we're going to expose shocking behavior by Disney Corporation targeting
[33:43.680 --> 33:55.200]  infants for sexualization and targeting toddlers for gender confusion and trying
[33:55.200 --> 34:00.080]  to train toddlers from the time they can first hear someone read to them how to
[34:00.080 --> 34:08.960]  be rebellious and how to break things and how to be bad. We always knew that Dr.
[34:08.960 --> 34:12.520]  Spock's books got pushed telling parents not to raise their children so the
[34:12.520 --> 34:16.160]  state could raise them. We always knew that was part of the plan that later
[34:16.160 --> 34:22.120]  came out, but man these people are just so seditious and they want to turn your
[34:22.120 --> 34:29.240]  child into a desperate SJW that's all alone, that has the fact that they're
[34:29.240 --> 34:34.320]  anti-social exploited. They want to make them anti-social, chip on their shoulder,
[34:34.320 --> 34:40.600]  losers. And I'll be honest with you, the magnitude of the corruption is really
[34:40.600 --> 34:44.800]  starting to get to me because the more I study it, the more I see it, and the more
[34:44.800 --> 34:50.240]  they come out in the open, it's like, good Lord, no wonder they don't want to
[34:50.240 --> 34:56.840]  coexist with us because they're just completely evil and I don't want to
[34:56.840 --> 35:05.080]  coexist with them. They're not gonna let us coexist, they want to conquer us, they
[35:05.080 --> 35:11.800]  want to conquer everyone. I mean, look at this article,
[35:11.800 --> 35:20.800]  Girl Guiding UK allows transgender guides to share showers tense with girls, and
[35:20.800 --> 35:29.520]  so it is adult men that identify as girls. When your girls are basically in
[35:29.520 --> 35:33.760]  the girls' couch, the UK equivalent naked man who identifies as a woman takes a
[35:33.760 --> 35:40.520]  shower with your daughters. Remember Como of CNN this year? It was pointed out
[35:40.520 --> 35:46.000]  that they now went in the Girl Scouts of America to have adult men shower with
[35:46.000 --> 35:55.360]  the girls that identify as women. And Como said, if your parents have taught you
[35:55.360 --> 35:59.440]  that it's wrong of your 12-year-old girl to see a man's genitals in a shower,
[35:59.440 --> 36:05.240]  that's bigoted and you ought to be ashamed of yourself. That's a tweet. And
[36:05.240 --> 36:10.480]  when you pull back from this and you realize it, see now they can say, oh, I
[36:10.480 --> 36:16.080]  identify as a child. Or maybe your child identifies as an adult so they can have
[36:16.080 --> 36:20.720]  sex with an adult. That's where this all goes. There it is, CNN's Chris Como wants
[36:20.720 --> 36:26.280]  tolerance of naked men in women's restrooms. Because a parent complained
[36:26.280 --> 36:30.400]  and said, you know, naked men in the showers, and he said, I wonder if she's the
[36:30.400 --> 36:38.360]  problem or overprotective and intolerant dad. Teach tolerance. So if at the local
[36:38.360 --> 36:45.080]  pool, a man goes into the showers, the police are called, he gets arrested. If
[36:45.080 --> 36:49.240]  he's in there, you know, on purpose. I think we've all been in a hurry or whatever
[36:49.240 --> 36:52.600]  and walked into the wrong restroom. I've seen a woman do it on me. I've walked
[36:52.600 --> 36:55.600]  into women's restrooms, I think a couple times, you know, you're at the movie,
[36:55.600 --> 36:58.840]  you're running back, kind of just running, you go, oops, no urinals in here,
[36:58.840 --> 37:02.880]  kind of pull back. But if you're going in there to the women's showers, taking
[37:02.880 --> 37:06.560]  your clothes off, you know, trying to get in there, and you identify as a woman,
[37:06.560 --> 37:11.080]  and then I'm hateful because I don't want my daughters to be freaked out by
[37:11.080 --> 37:15.600]  that. I mean, my daughters don't walk in when I'm taking a shower. I don't walk in
[37:15.600 --> 37:21.000]  when they're taking a shower. After they're like the age of what, three or
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.240]  four? Hey, bathroom's private and you don't come in the bathroom when I'm in
[37:26.240 --> 37:31.120]  here. Sometimes they'll pop their head in. Dad, can I go to my friend's house? I'm
[37:31.120 --> 37:34.280]  like, this is one of my pet peeves. I'm like, even though they're not in the
[37:34.280 --> 37:37.040]  shower, there's in the bathroom sticking their head in. I'm like, get out of the
[37:37.040 --> 37:41.680]  bathroom. I've asked my wife, we got multiple bathrooms. If I'm in the bathroom,
[37:41.680 --> 37:47.720]  go to another bathroom. Vice versa. The whole point is, it's about rubbing it in
[37:47.720 --> 37:51.440]  your face where you have no privacy. It's what the police state's about. It's what
[37:51.440 --> 37:55.720]  the surveillance is about. It's what the iPhone's watching you and the droids
[37:55.720 --> 38:01.720]  watching you. All of it is about this. And if they can get away with putting men
[38:01.720 --> 38:05.480]  in girls' bathrooms, the sky's the limit. And this is going to tie it into what's
[38:05.480 --> 38:14.960]  coming up next hour. Girlguiding UK, this is Breitbart, allows transgender guides
[38:14.960 --> 38:21.400]  to share showers, tents with girls. Male guides identify as female, will be allowed
[38:21.400 --> 38:27.720]  to shower with girls during campaign trips. Girlguiding UK literature has
[38:27.720 --> 38:32.800]  revealed. That's like the girl's couch over there. Official guidance
[38:32.800 --> 38:37.360]  distribution by the organization, which applies to girl guides between the ages
[38:37.360 --> 38:43.280]  of five and 25, tells guide leaders, that's adults, camp leaders, to let
[38:43.280 --> 38:48.160]  transgender members share changing rooms, toilets, tents, and cabins with girls
[38:48.160 --> 38:54.040]  while away on excursions. Yes. Really, I mean, in the girl's couch, you don't even
[38:54.040 --> 38:58.160]  have the camp leader that's an adult sleeping with you. I mean, in the same
[38:58.160 --> 39:04.160]  in the same area. The move came as a 107-year-old organization updated
[39:04.160 --> 39:09.800]  advice regarding male guides who identify as female demographic. It was
[39:09.800 --> 39:15.680]  revealed in January as now being admitted to the girl's only organization. And get
[39:15.680 --> 39:23.600]  ready for this. Full grown men will shower with your daughters, and they're
[39:23.600 --> 39:28.480]  going to do it, and you're going to take it. You notice from Australia to Germany
[39:28.480 --> 39:32.840]  to the UK, it's a unified program. And the Russians have national TV shows
[39:32.840 --> 39:36.440]  exposing this, showing government documents that we cover, where they're
[39:36.440 --> 39:40.320]  meaning to break up the family. That's why they hate the Russians. The Russians
[39:40.320 --> 39:46.520]  have said no. Not because they're perfect, they're just not completely turned
[39:46.520 --> 39:54.040]  over to destroying the natural order of the universe. The new best practices
[39:54.040 --> 40:02.760]  program adopted by primary schools will inject LBGT lifestyle into every part
[40:02.760 --> 40:07.160]  of life. Members are entitled to use the facilities of the gender that they
[40:07.160 --> 40:11.600]  self-identify as, adds the organization, which confirmed they asked the male on
[40:11.600 --> 40:21.480]  Sunday. This includes showers, toilets, and changing rooms. Full grown men will now
[40:21.480 --> 40:24.880]  shower with your five and six-year-old daughters. By the way, everybody knows
[40:24.880 --> 40:28.760]  from Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts or Camp that you have camp showers for the
[40:28.760 --> 40:32.480]  adults, men and women, but that's separate. And then you don't have the camp
[40:32.480 --> 40:35.960]  counselors, female with female or male with male. You don't have adults
[40:35.960 --> 40:41.360]  showering with your children. Camps don't do that because that would be seen as
[40:41.360 --> 40:46.160]  leading towards pedophilia and letting predators have access. But they're gonna
[40:46.160 --> 40:52.360]  get over that bridge, you see, by saying, oh, well, they're adults, but they
[40:52.360 --> 40:56.240]  identify a man as a woman, or a woman as a man, and they're gonna take the shower
[40:56.240 --> 40:59.600]  with your children, and they're gonna have access because they're a special
[40:59.600 --> 41:10.200]  group. Hell, they might identify as a child that day. Earlier this year, Girl
[41:10.200 --> 41:13.760]  Guiding Chief Executive Julie Bentley stated that the move to allow male
[41:13.760 --> 41:19.320]  children to join as guides follows rules set in the Equality Act 2010, which
[41:19.320 --> 41:22.800]  makes clear organizations proving single-gender services should treat
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.520]  people according to their acquired gender. So they're gonna put boys in the
[41:26.520 --> 41:31.400]  girls, and then they're gonna put adult men in there as the leaders. This is
[41:31.400 --> 41:36.640]  crazy. This is how the pedophiles get into your life. This is how they take
[41:36.640 --> 41:40.680]  over. Now I'm gonna come back with Keith Overman claiming he's quitting because
[41:40.680 --> 41:44.160]  he's had victory over Trump, all part of the new hoax, and we've got so much more.
[41:44.160 --> 41:50.200]  We've got McCron confronting a Islamic invader who she's bitching and
[41:50.200 --> 41:53.560]  complaining. He says, what's your problem? It's not that he's a good guy. He
[41:53.560 --> 41:56.920]  understands the world is awake to what's happening. He has to pose as a
[41:56.920 --> 42:00.760]  patriot, or he's gonna get removed from office like Merkel is about to be. So the
[42:00.760 --> 42:04.000]  worm is turning. We are winning. Overman and the globalists are losing.
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.960]  Briefly, we have Cyber Monday. It was a big success. Thank you. That helps us
[42:08.960 --> 42:14.200]  fund our operation and overcome some serious obstacles and attacks and
[42:14.200 --> 42:19.400]  hopefully expand. A lot's happening here, but we are the tip of the spear. So we
[42:19.400 --> 42:23.520]  have a duty to expand and become more effective against the new world order.

[43:02.160 --> 43:07.960]  bottle, two months servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real
[43:07.960 --> 43:12.280]  red pill. This is a heart and brain pill, a new
[43:12.280 --> 43:16.640]  tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it. But boy, does it stimulate because
[43:16.640 --> 43:21.760]  it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors
[43:21.760 --> 43:25.760]  prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription. But they were
[43:25.760 --> 43:30.800]  charging people a hundred, two hundred dollars for the formulae. And I came up
[43:30.800 --> 43:35.400]  with our own formula working with scientists and developers non GMO made
[43:35.400 --> 43:40.400]  right here in America 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add the
[43:40.400 --> 43:45.240]  preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to
[43:45.240 --> 43:51.560]  have to even make the hormones in your glands. It is amazing. Red pill. Now
[43:51.560 --> 43:59.000]  available at infowarstore.com and your purchase fuzz the operation. America is
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.480]  an information based civil war. That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit
[44:03.480 --> 44:07.680]  the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing
[44:07.680 --> 44:12.080]  down from their bully. We're only intensifying our operations in the face
[44:12.080 --> 44:18.000]  of their wannabe dictatorship. Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian
[44:18.000 --> 44:23.880]  are simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture. The real punk
[44:23.880 --> 44:29.360]  rock is being a patriot who's pro America, pro capitalism and pro freedom who at
[44:29.360 --> 44:34.440]  the same time is tolerant. Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas
[44:34.440 --> 44:39.600]  Jefferson's classical liberalism. They are the anti liberal to defend free
[44:39.600 --> 44:43.800]  speech, meet like minded friends and promote freedom worldwide. We've got more
[44:43.800 --> 44:48.920]  than 60 original designs of high quality t-shirts for men and women as well as

[45:57.960 --> 46:01.920]  With few remaining days left on the legislative calendar Congress sure has
[46:01.920 --> 46:05.960]  a lot on the agenda including reauthorization of mass surveillance.
[46:05.960 --> 46:10.320]  The current authorization for the controversial section 702 expires
[46:10.320 --> 46:14.680]  December 31st and it's the first time Congress has faced reauthorization
[46:14.680 --> 46:19.760]  since Edward Snowden revealed the NSA's mass surveillance apparatus. Civil
[46:19.760 --> 46:23.440]  libertarians have urged Congress to take this reauthorization as an
[46:23.440 --> 46:28.160]  opportunity to implement meaningful reforms to shield innocent Americans from
[46:28.160 --> 46:31.680]  mass surveillance but with the clock running out Congress appears poised to
[46:31.680 --> 46:36.000]  just jam through reauthorization. Meanwhile the Supreme Court has just took
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.760]  up a blockbuster case, the privacy of emails, photos stored in the cloud, even
[46:40.760 --> 46:45.000]  heart rate history from a smartwatch could be at stake. The case, Carpenter
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.800]  vs. US, will determine whether the history of cell phone locations stored by a
[46:49.800 --> 46:53.640]  phone service provider is searchable without a warrant. It's a legal theory
[46:53.640 --> 46:55.880]  known as the third-party doctrine.
[46:55.880 --> 47:06.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:25.880 --> 47:36.440]  Welcome back folks. I'm Alex Jones your host that's Bing Crosby. I'm doing a
[47:36.440 --> 47:43.880]  white Christmas which means snow. One of my daughters has only seen snow once and
[47:43.880 --> 47:47.360]  she wants to go to Colorado somewhere this year for Christmas so that she can
[47:47.360 --> 47:51.600]  see it but see that's racist. In fact BuzzFeed has even said milk is racist
[47:51.600 --> 47:56.760]  because it's white. Soros has come out and said that if we don't keep Obama's
[47:56.760 --> 48:01.200]  net neutrality that was really an internet takeover that we're racist.
[48:01.200 --> 48:07.040]  That story's up on dredgerport.com and all over the country campuses have
[48:07.040 --> 48:12.800]  agreed to ban dreaming of a white Christmas on grounds of racism so let's
[48:12.800 --> 48:23.200]  hear some of this hate. Oh there you go ladies and gentlemen. It's President
[48:23.200 --> 48:28.560]  Trump's new Christmas White House video of your radio listener. It shows the
[48:28.560 --> 48:33.720]  first lady decorating the Christmas trees that have a snow and white light
[48:33.720 --> 48:38.520]  motif. This will undoubtedly be called racist because it's white. Also Martian
[48:38.520 --> 48:42.760]  because it's also green so it's a little bit of a wink to the Martians. If snow means
[48:42.760 --> 48:47.640]  you're pro white people and white trees mean you're you know a code word for KKK
[48:47.640 --> 48:54.520]  I guess garb then the green again is a worship of Martians. There you go. In fact
[48:54.520 --> 48:59.360]  the main tree is mainly green. That is a surrender message to the Martians who are
[48:59.360 --> 49:06.440]  reportedly green. Oh and they even have a nativity scene. Wow this just gets worse
[49:06.440 --> 49:10.560]  and worse and Europe and San Francisco and other areas have banned
[49:10.560 --> 49:16.760]  fireplaces that burn wood. They even showed an illegal fire. Oh and the White
[49:16.760 --> 49:23.440]  House what color is it? It's white. Just one last racist affront and if you're a
[49:23.440 --> 49:27.760]  radio listener I am narrating it. A lot of folks on YouTube and Facebook go why
[49:27.760 --> 49:35.080]  does Jones talk over videos? Well if there's no words and it's only images
[49:35.080 --> 49:41.840]  then for the radio audience I have to describe what the video is. We're mainly
[49:41.840 --> 49:49.120]  a radio show. Terrestrial radio is our main audience. The globalists are trying
[49:49.120 --> 49:53.440]  to censor us on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter. They're admittedly curtailing it
[49:53.440 --> 49:58.480]  some but it's a Streisand effect. As they try to hold the beach ball under it
[49:58.480 --> 50:02.200]  gets harder and harder. When it finally gets let loose from the deep end it
[50:02.200 --> 50:09.280]  shoots out of the water high into the sky as long as you don't give in. As long
[50:09.280 --> 50:12.560]  as you don't let them break your will. As long as you don't let them wear you
[50:12.560 --> 50:16.680]  down. As long as you love the fight and have that spirit of victory. This is a
[50:16.680 --> 50:22.680]  long-term 12-round boxing match or even better it's more like a wrestling match
[50:22.680 --> 50:27.960]  and so we have the president coming out and saying we're gonna say Merry Christmas
[50:27.960 --> 50:32.440]  again. People say oh there's no war on Christmas. While all over the country I
[50:32.440 --> 50:36.040]  see articles where kids are told don't bring Christmas cards it's religious.
[50:36.040 --> 50:41.800]  Well you can be a Muslim, a Christian, an atheist, a Wiccan, whatever your
[50:41.800 --> 50:45.320]  religion is. You can talk to your friends in 5th grade or 10th grade or
[50:45.320 --> 50:49.840]  12th grade about that. You can hand out Christmas cards during lunch. You just
[50:49.840 --> 50:52.640]  can't do it in inappropriate times. You have that free speech but they're
[50:52.640 --> 50:57.320]  trying to teach our students. We're gonna put naked men in the showers with you
[50:57.320 --> 51:02.000]  at many public schools run by the Democrats and claim that they can come
[51:02.000 --> 51:08.840]  shower with you or you're a bigot. Oh but if a man asks a woman out that's rape.
[51:08.840 --> 51:14.360]  Again they're smoke screening, watering it all down, normal sexual activity as
[51:14.360 --> 51:19.200]  they move forward to sexualize children, as they move forward to overturn all of
[51:19.200 --> 51:28.920]  our conventions, all of our classical cultural systems. Everything traditional
[51:28.920 --> 51:33.920]  is under attack because it's an organized takeover and they know it's an
[51:33.920 --> 51:38.360]  organized takeover and they know that you're awake to it. They're like boa
[51:38.360 --> 51:42.800]  constrictors or vines that wrap around your arms, your legs, and finally your
[51:42.800 --> 51:45.680]  neck and then as soon as they've got you where they want you they start
[51:45.680 --> 51:50.280]  squeezing the life out of you. They want you poor, they want you depressed, they
[51:50.280 --> 51:53.480]  want you under their control and the WikiLeaks and all the other documents
[51:53.480 --> 51:58.840]  from Facebook. Show it! But first the vines caress you and go just let me wrap
[51:58.840 --> 52:02.720]  around your arm. I want to be warm and let me wrap around your leg. Don't pull
[52:02.720 --> 52:07.920]  me loose. If you cut me loose you're being evil, you're being racist. Just use
[52:07.920 --> 52:13.720]  the words I want you to use. Do what I say. You know let me run your society, pay
[52:13.720 --> 52:18.680]  for my sex change. Let me have the affirmative action. Let me and it's
[52:18.680 --> 52:22.480]  all these things supposedly for protected groups but those aren't protected
[52:22.480 --> 52:27.080]  groups. Those are groups being manipulated in to the globalist system to
[52:27.080 --> 52:32.840]  make them more domesticated, more controlled, more under bondage, more
[52:32.840 --> 52:36.840]  under their system and it's not my opinion about this predatory system.
[52:36.840 --> 52:41.280]  They've written books and white papers and articles and constant amounts of
[52:41.280 --> 52:46.600]  leaks but now they're on the news saying rural areas are criminal and they
[52:46.600 --> 52:50.320]  shouldn't be allowed to vote and we need to arrest all the Republicans and we
[52:50.320 --> 52:55.780]  need to. They're showing you who they are. They're a bunch of losers, social
[52:55.780 --> 53:02.760]  engineers who want to run people's lives and to think about just five years
[53:02.760 --> 53:10.960]  ago they said white Christmas is racist and then now it's banned on most
[53:10.960 --> 53:17.160]  colleges. They just do it. Bing Crosby, white Christmas. It's talking about
[53:17.160 --> 53:25.520]  snow. They're not playing games ladies and gentlemen. They tell you oh your town
[53:25.520 --> 53:30.600]  can't have a nativity scene. Then they infiltrate your church to the
[53:30.600 --> 53:34.920]  seminary and take it over and get rid of the crosses. They're doing it all. They're
[53:34.920 --> 53:38.280]  conquering the culture and they say they've got your kids and now they're
[53:38.280 --> 53:43.800]  sexualizing them and now they're launching their final revolution.
[53:43.800 --> 53:47.760]  Being able to literally not just brainwash and chemicalize and deadly
[53:47.760 --> 53:52.440]  vaccine and GMO and fluoridate your children but now have sex with them and
[53:52.440 --> 53:56.960]  confuse them and tell them be rebellious, be bad. Be a boy if you're a girl. Be a
[53:56.960 --> 54:00.360]  girl if you're a boy. That's coming up this new Disney production. We're gonna
[54:00.360 --> 54:04.160]  show you and they're just in there absolutely trying to turn you into a
[54:04.160 --> 54:09.440]  desperate, alone, basket case who has no family. So as the world population
[54:09.440 --> 54:15.600]  reduction rolls in, as the depopulation begins, you're a basket case jibbering
[54:15.600 --> 54:23.240]  idiot mental patient and no one's there to stand up for you and no one's there
[54:23.240 --> 54:27.320]  to be your friend and you're all alone and they can suck your soul and from
[54:27.320 --> 54:32.640]  Australia to Canada to France to Germany to the UK they're taken down the
[54:32.640 --> 54:36.240]  American flags. They're taken down the German flags off government buildings
[54:36.240 --> 54:40.000]  saying they're hurtful and they're banning nativity scenes in people's
[54:40.000 --> 54:45.600]  front yards saying now that's hurtful and you're like I don't want to be hurtful
[54:45.600 --> 54:51.320]  let me give over my entire culture my entire life to you. You're not giving it
[54:51.320 --> 54:54.840]  to the Muslims. You're not giving it to the minorities. They're just pawns. You're
[54:54.840 --> 54:59.100]  giving it to the corporate globalist Borg that's taking over the world and we
[54:59.100 --> 55:05.760]  even have their battle plans so shame on us if we don't do something about it.

[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:46.000]  happening all over the world and it's run by the Tavistock Institute of MI 6
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:55.280]  in London England whose admitted plan is to end the family as we know it the

[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:05.320]  this isn't tolerance this is a political genetic corporate religious
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:11.960]  overwrite of our mammal activity they want to target fire ants that arrived
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:17.200]  here from Brazil in the late 1940s an invasive species they target them with
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.440]  hormones praise other things that turn off their sexual functions you want to
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.560]  target other insects is what they do we're being targeted like insects by the
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.920]  globalist through the food through the water and they admit in books like
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:38.840]  ecoscience written by the former White House science Tsar John P. Holdren to be
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:45.920]  carrying this out so it isn't our opinion coming up at the bottom of the
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:53.920]  hour I'm gonna break shocking information that is hidden in plain view
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:03:02.240]  I'm not gonna I'm not gonna not gonna get to it at this point ladies and
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:09.040]  gentlemen but I've got it right here in my hand and it just shows you and this
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:19.320]  is just the beginning this is just the opening salvo in all of this and it's
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:27.320]  only going to get more intense until we wake up and until we say no now coming
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.200]  up when we start the next segment I'm gonna play what I call the police state
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:37.400]  intro we've had it for about four years and it deals with how the globalists
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.400]  are bringing in this control grid and how we're in a battle for our country and
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.040]  I want to play it because we haven't played it in a while because it illustrates
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:48.560]  exactly what we're facing as a culture and as a civilization but this is
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:54.120]  scientific it's absolutely focused it knows full well what it's doing and
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:59.400]  there's no debating what I'm saying that this is an admitted plan this is an
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.680]  admitted operation this is social engineering to screw you up to suck you
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:08.840]  dry to make you alone and finally kill you you won't even have a grave you'll
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:14.880]  just be burned and your ashes shot into the atmosphere or you'll be reclamated
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:19.760]  and used for fertilizer that's the globalist plan and first they got to
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.040]  teach you to hate yourself they got to make life as ugly as possible they got
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.560]  to make things as hard as possible they've got to dumb you down as much as
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:32.060]  they can and it's all been declassified the ugly art the CIA everything I haven't
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:39.160]  gotten to it yet but after we hear this intro we're going to get into Keith
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:44.200]  Oberman and then this whole new hype that Trump's about to fall the whole
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.400]  Russian narrative is true this is another big giant hoax they're pushing in an
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:53.840]  attempt to steal reality from us yet again but it's destined to fail if we
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:59.960]  take action please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three

[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:14.040]  government with potentially their biggest problem us so part of it is we
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:17.240]  have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.640]  parents or kids belong to their families and recognize the kids belong to whole
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:26.040]  communities if you got a business that you didn't build that somebody else may

[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.880]  then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officers rifle
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:24.520]  they let them in the area they told them they could come in and now they're
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:29.560]  coming in like their trespassers punching and shoving people
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:35.560]  we're not running and we're not backing down if you want to come and take it
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:43.040]  we are on the March the Empire is on the run live from the info wars.com
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:59.800]  studios it's Alex Jones
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:05.440]  the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:18.560]  ladies and gentlemen we're now well into the second hour today Paul Watson's
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.640]  gonna be joining me coming up in the fourth hour continue on with Owen
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:27.720]  Shroyer in the war room three hours after that this is a radio show TV program
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:32.600]  syndicated across the country free to air to radio and TV stations across the
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:37.600]  country info wars.com forward slash show for any of you that can't find a local
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:42.240]  affiliate but it's critical to support our local stations as well it is it is
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:49.000]  such an amazing treasure the different UHF and VHF cable systems FM stations
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.160]  and AM stations that pick up the broadcast we really are changing the
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:57.080]  world together but we are under attack now I want to give this Keith Oberman
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:02.400]  piece because it's all part of the latest PR rollout by every major establishment
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:09.680]  publication out there here's the New York Times odds are Russia owns Trump
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:15.880]  wow odds are it was the New York Times did have Hillary at 98% chance of
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:23.440]  winning but then election week they dropped it down to 97 so odds are the
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:28.120]  New York Times is owned by a very corrupt Mexican kingpin who made
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:32.160]  billions of dollars off of the Obama phone program that he got the money
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.560]  from well that's not odds are that's a fact odds are the New York Times has been
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:42.880]  caught wind of people so much that it's one of the top fiction publications in
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:51.480]  the world odds are the facts are we now have a senior whistleblower that's gone
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.760]  public Charles McCullough the former internal watchdog for the US internal
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:02.520]  intelligence community investigated the Clintons top secret emails and when he
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:06.040]  went to clapper a year before the presidential election he was told we'll
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:09.200]  go after you will go after your family and when Hillary's elected you're gonna
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:15.880]  be fired and it was about hurry legal server and the foreign powers and all
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:19.720]  of it and of course we know uranium one that was an order by Mueller to kill
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.920]  that investigation now those emails were posted last week on the FBI's website
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:29.440]  with no fanfare with Mueller ordering everyone not to investigate it to stop
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.280]  investigating it and that he would personally take control of it and he
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:38.600]  did and then he killed it this is a guy on the tarmac giving the Russians weapons
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:43.480]  great uranium he's like a James Bond villain of course he's saying Trump's
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:51.040]  the Russian agent it's a classic bill where you catch the agent they go no he's
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:56.400]  the agent or she's the agent this is ridiculous they're the globalist they're
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.880]  the ones about selling the country out they're the ones that have the history
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.760]  of feeding on the country this is the guy that protected the Clintons for
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:11.520]  heaven's sakes he's a monster so now Fox News blowback Clinton campaign planned
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:18.640]  to fire me over email probe Obama Intel watchdog says who was nonpartisan they
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.800]  even threatened his family
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:28.480]  he came to the inspector general with the information it goes on and on and
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:32.560]  this is the latest of whistleblowers coming out and informants and FBI agents
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:37.800]  and that's why they're panicking because they know the people like mr. Bongino of
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:42.360]  the Secret Service are about to expose the pedophilia of the Clintons and love
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:46.720]  the Lolita Express and all the rest of it that's why they're in crisis so in
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:51.800]  comes Keith Oberman to say he's approaching 400 million views I went
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:57.040]  and looked at the YouTube his average video is 200,000 views he's done 140
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:02.840]  something of them you do the math of that it's nowhere near that and then he
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.480]  says he's he's quitting because Trump is about to go to jail nothing can stop it
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:11.960]  and that's the same thing they're all pushing today is it's over Mueller's
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:17.120]  gonna get him Mueller will stop those pesky voters Mueller Mueller he's our
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:21.880]  man if he can't overthrow the election nobody can and the left's just
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.960]  salivating for authoritarianism watch what you ask for because if you go down
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:33.880]  that road historically all of you desperate alone want to be establishment
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:39.440]  types are gonna find out that it kicks as hard as it shoots but here's
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:44.640]  Oberman saying Trump broke him he's giving up nobody's watching him he's a
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.920]  total caricature he calls himself the resistance gee where'd you get that
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:57.080]  plagiarist here it is I'm Keith Oberman and this is the resistance I am
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:00.600]  confident now even more so than I have been throughout the last year that this
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.760]  nightmare presidency of Donald John Trump will end prematurely and end soon
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:09.840]  and I am thus also confident that this is the correct moment to end this series
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:15.600]  of commentaries but frankly I have not enjoyed one minute of it as I'm certain
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:20.640]  it has also been for you for me it has been unadulterated pain and revulsion and
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:26.880]  horror the process has become nearly 24-7 and I've said so much that I can and
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:31.640]  have recycled old commentaries from months ago and they have been fully
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:36.360]  applicable to breaking news we've come full circle to such a complete degree
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:41.960]  that on Sunday Trump tweeted a complaint about quote Russia Russia Russia the
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:46.240]  title of the 46th episode of the resistance from last March 14th was
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:53.800]  quote Russia Russia Russia I've made my point so now that I think the outcomes
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.480]  the seven different inevitable outcomes are unavoidable I'd like to go back and
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:04.000]  enjoy some of my life again and I'm going to no illness no scandal no firing
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:10.400]  just I said what I've had to say it was as obvious as I made it seem I give my
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:15.080]  work everything I can so it's not like I can dial it back and I think even this
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.240]  dim-witted world of American political TV reporting which is still calculating
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.720]  how to get Trump's idiot supporters to watch their networks and still waiting
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:27.440]  for Trump to pivot even it can carry this the rest of the way so I am
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:34.000]  retiring from political commentary in all media venues this is not to say a
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  bed of roses and reconciliation awaits us the post Trump America will be
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.800]  relieved of his prodigious evil but in its place it will have Trump as living
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:48.760]  martyr that prodigious evil and rank hypocrisy I'd say down this person the
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.960]  only thing he said that was true there is that if you if they were to take out
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:57.280]  Trump geopolitically that's even better for us you'll never stop us then ID

[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.720]  Congress sure has a lot on the agenda including reauthorization of mass
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:08.800]  surveillance the current authorization for the controversial section 702 expires
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:13.520]  December 31st and it's the first time Congress has faced reauthorization since
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:18.200]  Edward Snowden revealed the NSA's mass surveillance apparatus civil
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.880]  libertarians have urged Congress to take this reauthorization as an
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.400]  opportunity to implement meaningful reforms to shield innocent Americans
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:29.920]  from mass surveillance but with the clock running out Congress appears poised
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.320]  to just jam through reauthorization meanwhile the Supreme Court has just
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:39.200]  took up a blockbuster case the privacy of emails photos stored in the cloud even
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:43.480]  heart rate history from a smartwatch could be at stake the case carpenter
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:48.080]  versus us will determine whether the history of cell phone locations stored

[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:23.200]  off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients but it
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:26.240]  wasn't prescription but they were charging people a hundred two hundred

[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:43.240]  national story is but when it's informative when it's educational and
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:47.000]  it shows how they manipulate when it shows how they control that I do get
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.680]  into it and the last day it's really blown up when President Trump had some
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:57.760]  of the amazing Navajo code breakers amazing as they're still alive since
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:03.600]  World War two and their code really is a one-of-a-kind and their patriots and
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:08.760]  you just neat folks he makes the joke about hey you've been here a lot longer
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:13.160]  than the rest of us except maybe Pocahontas making a joke at Warren who
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:17.440]  Native American groups have gone in research she lied she's not Cherokee
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:24.360]  she's not Comanche she's not any of those groups and she just lied to be
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:28.520]  politically correct kind of like this were race reassignment we've seen where
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:34.200]  white women claim they're really black women and start putting blackface on it's
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:40.800]  it's beyond cultural appropriation it is identity theft so Trump's making a joke
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:45.080]  with these old guys these guys were in World War two don't think they didn't
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:50.000]  hear a joke don't think they don't get a joke don't think old men don't like
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.440]  jokes like that Trump's 70 years old these guys are like 20 years older than
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:58.680]  them and Pocahontas is a joke ladies and gentlemen
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:04.560]  Elizabeth Warren's a lying dirtbag and so even Bill Maher knows where all this
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:09.560]  is going and made fun of her last night as well to sit there and call it a
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:14.960]  racial slur now to take any word you don't like or any argument somebody has
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:20.000]  a nickname about how she lied about being Native American he put that nickname
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.240]  on her because it fits crooked Hillary's crooked slimy Bill's slimy we
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:30.800]  created the whole deal Bill Clinton's a rapist you popularize it as an audience
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:36.680]  that's what he's known as because he is nicknames don't stick unless they fit
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:42.880]  I've got 99 percentile size head the crew calls me pumpkin head behind my back

[01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:04.920]  Bill Clinton's the rapist Hillary is crooked so let's first go to what Trump
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:09.040]  actually said Trump makes remarks regarding Pocahontas here it is I want

[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:04.240]  even bigger he's like we got the real McCoy here folks you got this fraud over
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:08.440]  here by the way I've sent my genetics off I've never done it it's not like I
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:11.840]  just say I'm Native American and then I mean I know it's gonna come back because
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:16.400]  I know because my dad's dad looked like these guys he was just six foot four and
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:21.840]  had blue eyes Jerry Jones and of course they brought him up teaching him we're
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:29.600]  Indians from from Florida we don't say what we are because even in the 20s and
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.280]  stuff when our family that side of the family came back from Florida they were
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.600]  sent there even when they came back back then you weren't supposed to say you
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.760]  were a Comanche and it wasn't just one trail of tears it was a bunch of them but
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:43.760]  yeah I mean I'm actually related folks the trail of tears but I don't make that
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:47.560]  like I'm something special or some big deal the Native Americans were
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:53.840]  incredibly barbarous murdering you name it depending on the tribe and the
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:58.360]  Comanches were about as bad as it got but you know the whole point is I'm
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:03.480]  actually proud of that but it's just it's sick but I know when my genetics
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.600]  come back I'm publishing them sent them off about two weeks ago and I paid for
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:10.840]  the big one the big detail one where they're gonna be able to tell which which
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:15.920]  Native tribes because I already know but it'll be fun to publish that I'm no
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:21.000]  Pocahontas so get ready for that now let's continue I mean my dad's even got
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.040]  the handsome Native American nose I didn't get it I look just like my mom's dad
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:28.560]  but let's let's put those code breakers back up there one more time
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.720]  because the Navajo are little guys on average you know the the Comanches were
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:35.320]  the lords of the plane they were the particularly warlike folks only people
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:38.400]  bigger were Caronco was because they were cannibals but that's a whole
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:42.040]  another Texas tribe right now I don't know I'm related to them yet but we'll
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:45.360]  find out let's go ahead and go to the next clip here
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:50.200]  Elizabeth Warren accuses Trump of using a racial slur well as a Native American I
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:56.520]  can tell you what's not here it is was supposed to be an event to honor heroes
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:02.760]  people who put it all on the line for our country and people who because of
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:10.680]  their incredible work save the lives of countless Americans and our allies it is
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:16.120]  deeply unfortunate that the president of the United States cannot even make it
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:22.560]  through a ceremony honoring these heroes without having to throw out a racial
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:27.560]  slur Donald Trump does this over and over that's all they do is turn
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.560]  everything into racial slur no you are known as Pocahontas because you're not
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:36.200]  a Native American and you are a liar and the tribes I've got a bunch of their
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:40.560]  clips have rejected you you lied about being a Cherokee by the way everybody
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:43.880]  Oklahoma's a Cherokee because that was seen as the friendly tribe people don't
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:47.840]  even know why everybody's a Cherokee most of folks weren't Cherokee they were
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:51.400]  blackfoot or they were always other grips that were being hunted down and
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:54.920]  killed because they were known for not giving up the Cherokee worked with
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:57.680]  everybody not saying they're bad folks they're great folks okay let's go ahead
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.560]  and go to this next clip this is a Bill Maher this is pretty fun oh no no Sarah
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:06.480]  Huckabee Sanders first responding here it is the event that the president just
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:11.120]  did with the Navajo Code Talkers he referred to Pocahontas being in the
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:18.080]  Senate why did he feel the need to say something I've grown up in Texas and
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:20.840]  Oklahoma and I know people that are part Native American because they're all over
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:27.280]  the place most people are I bet you money if you test Sarah Huckabee Sanders
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:31.920]  blood I bet she's Native American because I know what people look like they
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:38.440]  are I bet you she is here let's go back to it people while honoring the Navajo
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.920]  Code Talkers he's genuine American I think what most people find offensive is
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:47.600]  Senator Warren lying about her heritage to advance her career
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:51.600]  she said it was a racial slur she said it was a racial slur what is your
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:55.920]  response to that I think that's a ridiculous response
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:58.920]  because the president was speaking at an event to honor members of the
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:03.440]  greatest generation people who fought in World War two who are in their 80s and
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:08.120]  90s now and the moment had many people online asking whether the president
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:12.320]  lacks decency what's your response to that note look I think the president
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:18.440]  certainly finds an extreme amount of value and respect for these individuals
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:21.240]  which is why he brought them and invited them to come to the White House and
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.440]  spent time with them recognizing them exactly they try to turn everything bad
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:30.560]  he's saying these are real Native Americans set and Senator Warren is a
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:35.240]  fake we've got the big news coming up on the other side ladies and gentlemen it

[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:14.280]  power because politicians have hijacked it as a way to undermine the media
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:17.880]  establishment the authors to cry the fact that a majority of people now
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:22.360]  believe the mainstream media pedals fabricated stories of course the real
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:26.720]  reason media elites want to clamp down on the term fake news is because its
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:31.160]  original intention to smear and discredit any dissenting opinions has
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:35.360]  completely backfired this was illustrated yet again by President Trump's
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:40.320]  latest triggering tweet when he suggested that a fake news trophy should be
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.880]  awarded to the network that has been responsible for the most inaccurate
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:48.080]  reporting the fake news narrative is actually acted as a boomerang showing
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:52.080]  the mainstream media to be the most consistently dishonest entity of all

[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:27.600]  why do you think the globalists are trying to ban Christmas music and
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:31.320]  shopping malls and the band handing out Christmas cards at most public schools
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:36.120]  and for banning nativity scenes even in people's front yards now why are they
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:40.680]  doing all this because they want to overthrow everything that's beautiful
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:45.800]  everything that's good they want to teach you to accept less they want to tell
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.960]  Africans you can't have cars or air conditioning but it's okay because
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:54.160]  Obama told them they want you to be poor they're selling you a culture that
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:34:02.040]  exploits your weaknesses and tries to make you completely alone and that's
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:06.920]  what they're doing ladies and gentlemen and I'm not just demonizing the
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:11.760]  globalist they deserve it they have fully decided to embrace the role of
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:18.840]  practicing the dark and twisted arts of dehumanization dreaming of a white
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:23.560]  Christmas in yuletide classics colorblind racism says salon ban it
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:28.600]  well don't worry colleges across the country have banned being Crosby's I'm
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:35.120]  dreaming of a white Christmas they know what they're doing they have a mission
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:40.600]  completely conquering society and culture
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:49.680]  without further ado let me get to the big news story because this is a two
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:57.920]  pronged issue we're dealing with when I'm made aware of something like this
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:11.880]  and then I do the research into it it's so upsetting it's like being run over by
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:21.640]  car and then there's the anger I have of not being able to properly summon the
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:27.880]  mental capacity to explain to you how evil and twisted and wrong this is
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:33.640]  and then you realize they're bragging it's all by design and then you realize
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:39.000]  that we are surrounded by people that have turned themselves over to a spirit
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:47.400]  of evil a program they didn't innately come up with this they have fallen to it
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:53.320]  then you realize you're not watching Netflix and some show like stranger
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:58.640]  things where it's based in fantasy land we're living in a real interdimensional
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:14.520]  war that the establishment knows about they're reaching out to it they want
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:19.800]  power from it and it's telling them you're gonna get power but you've got to
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:24.600]  go around and absolutely destroy civilization in society and then I'll
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:30.600]  put you in charge as little gatekeepers over the misery but in the end you'll
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:35.240]  be destroyed as well and they're so possessed by the spirit they howl and
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:41.080]  say yes destroy me too I love it they're just turned over to evil in fact I
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:44.880]  can't even cover this yet and I'm not doing this as a cliffhanger with the
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:48.240]  audience everybody knows I get right to the news right to the big stories right
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:55.360]  up front I can't ever even say coming up I'm gonna get to this because I just
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:59.400]  want to start getting to it right away but I I don't even know how to describe
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:06.320]  what I'm about to cover because it's overt it's disgusting it's wicked it's
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:13.200]  twisted it's sickening but you can see how they doled it up to look non-threatening
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:19.600]  like a big juicy worm on the end of a hook for a fish and then it just makes
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:28.160]  me so sad for the operatives that are involved in this to imagine what they're
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:38.200]  like jacked into that spirit and to imagine what it's like to be turned over
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:56.560]  to this I just don't know what to say at this point I mean here's the problem
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:04.480]  everything's supposed to be about brevity nowadays but I didn't know all
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:09.960]  this when I started out 25 years ago and now exponentially I learn more every
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:13.360]  month that I'm learning the previous year it's exponential I know it's
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:17.920]  happening to you as well and I'm just like I just want to get out of here man
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:22.320]  I don't even want to fight these people because you spiritually see what they
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:32.840]  are you see what they are and you see how spiritually they're all tangled up in
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:36.880]  the vines and the snakes and they're being fed on and there's snakes coming
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:41.560]  out of their eyes their ears their guts they are just tortured souls and then
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:44.880]  and it's not you're not even keeping score you're not even as a dominant man
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:51.160]  beating the zombie hordes you're just up against some ancient evil some
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:58.560]  intergalactic spirit some force that is absolutely hell-bent on destroying you
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:04.240]  it's a feeling it's a will it's a consciousness of death and ugliness and
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:12.080]  wanting to hurt everything good I'm just like how is anyone following this how
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:18.320]  is anyone with this but they don't know they've been tricked into serving evil
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:25.920]  believing that's giving them power and I think about how romantic it is we're on
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:31.080]  a planet in deep space with the stars and the meteors and the moon and the sun
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:35.280]  and our children and our husbands and our wives and our parents and our
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:41.040]  lineage and the oceans and the trees and the birds and the smells and just it's
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:46.120]  all amazing driving around these cities with big buildings and structures and
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:52.800]  it's all just consciousness is so amazing and they tell us there is no
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:56.240]  consciousness you're just an animal nothing exists they want you to give
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:00.560]  yourself over and decide that's the case and not jack into the wonderment not
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:08.680]  jack into the Renaissance not jack into the romance of how good God is and how
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:13.560]  good creation is and how good God is to give us men and women together and in
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:17.800]  this beautiful thing producing these amazing children that are part of our
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:22.640]  physical love combining together and how pure it is and to see the system
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:27.920]  perched like black widow spiders ready to poison kids from day one and just
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:32.280]  absolutely doing everything they can to make the excruciating pain as long and
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:38.120]  most horrible as possible and to see giant psychically blind armies of
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:44.880]  people marching forward on their bellies begging to be possessed by the spirit
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:50.240]  of the world so that they might have some future and some power
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:58.320]  they were showing me some breaking those let's put it back on screen please

[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:30.040]  we now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:42.640]  resistance it's Alex Jones all right let's get right into it right now this
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:52.000]  story makes me truly sick to watch Hollywood Disney this entire combine
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.720]  feed on our children sexualize our children it's just disgusting I remember
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:04.920]  six or seven years ago Viacom controlling Nickelodeon and and and other
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:11.520]  children's channels said we're going to start targeting pre-teens with
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:16.640]  sexualized messages they were telling shareholders they were gonna do this
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:23.760]  well that's nothing now here's the new book that Millie Weaver when she was
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:28.320]  there shopping with her son last week found at Target I was at Target
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:32.760]  personally myself to check this out yesterday and there it was on the shelf
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:40.760]  feminist baby now when you open the book up it has the baby like it's a pin-up
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:45.320]  with its naked butt sticking out like it's a pin-up girl and a pin-up girl
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:53.720]  post so it begins by sexualizing a newborn baby then it tells the toddlers
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:58.440]  that are being read the story it's main target you make messes you throw things
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:02.600]  you don't do what you're told you like pink you like blue you play with race
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:08.360]  cars you play with dolls you're gonna be whatever sex you want it sexualizes
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:19.000]  children and it's written by a buzzfeed writer and cartoonist now ladies and
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.320]  gentlemen we've just seen YouTube with the whole sexualization of children and
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:26.520]  them allowing them to prey on people and the search terms how to have sex with
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:30.720]  your child or how to have sex with children being the top search functions
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:38.280]  Millie Weaver has shot a report on this but it's got the baby sticking its butt
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:40.840]  out naked
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:46.080]  feminist baby says no to pants so it's to make children rebellious mental
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:50.720]  patients left to think this is important to do like Dr. Spock said create all the
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:56.040]  social problems we see today but this is a recipe on how to ruin your child
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:01.440]  before I go to the other report here is just some daily beast articles from the
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:06.200]  leftist themselves admitting this the pedophile director embraced by Hollywood
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:13.680]  hired after he was convicted of raping a 12-year-old boy by Harvey Weinstein to
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:18.680]  direct other films with children so the big final goal is corrupting your
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:22.680]  children getting them while they're young controlling the culture just like
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:27.320]  Hitler did by getting the youth just like MSNBC has said your children belong
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:33.240]  to the state not to you we're gonna brainwash them you don't teach them
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:37.040]  anything that's abuse if you tell your kids anything that you're a boy you're a
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:40.880]  girl or there's a God or any of that you don't teach them that or it's abuse
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:44.400]  already in Europe in the UK they take your kids for that but we're gonna teach
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:49.320]  them what's happening in the UK with their girl scouts called girl guiding
[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:55.200]  UK allows transgender guides to share showers tents with girls including full
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:51:00.400]  grown men to take naked showers with your daughters as young as age five as
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:06.200]  long as they identify as a woman meanwhile politically correct fascism
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:11.560]  Catholic school forced to ban words mother and father because that hurt
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:17.200]  somebody that may not have mother and father and then here's the very writer
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:24.160]  with Buzzfeed if you can call it that Lauren Brantz has whole cartoons about
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:30.000]  not having a gender and how you don't know what you're having is it a boy or
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:36.320]  girl let the state decide and let its programming decide not you so this is
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:41.320]  the final assault to depopulate the planet it's in all the UN documents it's
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:45.000]  in John P. Holder in the former White House science ours own book
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.880]  ecoscience how they would confuse gender use chemicals and food and water to do
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:52.360]  this they've now done it they demonize me all day for covering it even though
[01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:56.920]  it's admitted without further ado here is the report with Millie Weaver the full
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:03.200]  report just gone live on info wars.com Disney caught in shocking sexualization
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:11.040]  of babies they've now made babies new sex items this is truly the next level of
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:16.500]  depravity from Disney. I was out and about the other day I went to Target to
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:20.520]  find some children's books for my two-year-old when I happened to come
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:28.160]  across this book feminist baby that's right you heard me they're already
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:33.920]  indoctrinating children with feminism just to make sure that this was not just
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:39.480]  a gag present I went to Disney books.com which is listed on the back of the book
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:44.760]  and sure enough Disney has it listed for zero to two-year-olds well first of all
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:52.560]  how does a child ages zero to two even grasp the concept of feminism well who
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:59.760]  better than to explain it to them than rainbow snatch. Good morning little Vays
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:07.440]  Z's rainbows and purple penguins today we're gonna have storytime with drag
[01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:16.920]  queens and I'm rainbow snatch I identify as a trans multi-dimensional non-binary
[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:24.920]  being so please refer to me as my proper pronoun as they so today we're gonna be
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:33.080]  reading a very very special book written by a powerful woman author who's very
[01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:42.520]  smart her name is Lauren Brands feminist baby by Lauren Brands published by
[01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:53.640]  Disney Hyperion feminist baby loves to dance feminist baby says no to pants
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:54:10.800]  this is promoting pedophilia with children selling them to take off their
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:15.640]  clothes and then a picture of a naked baby looking all empowered and proud it's
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:21.360]  no wonder that Disney published this book however from a perspective of a
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:27.200]  parent this disturbs me because you're promoting children taking their clothes
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:33.680]  off peeing and pooping everywhere give me a break feminist baby likes pink and
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:39.080]  blue likes pink or blue so they're obviously promoting the whole you can
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:43.080]  choose whatever gender you want to be
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:53.520]  feminist baby chooses what to wear it's her choice her body to choose what she
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:58.440]  wears one of the things I don't like about this already is it's telling the
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:03.840]  children that they have a choice over their parents choice mom says put this
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:08.600]  on you're going to church no I'm not I'm wearing a ninja turtle costume sorry
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:14.640]  I'm a feminist baby with a new makeup challenge full face using only kids
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:21.080]  makeup I'm like girl Jesus take the wheel I am a boy that loves to wear makeup
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:29.600]  and if you don't like it she doesn't care
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:45.920]  feminist baby makes lots of noise feminist baby throws her toys
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:55.240]  well it looks like feminist baby is gonna be spending an awful lot of time in

[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:42.520]  this is promoting the whole gender role thing where you see these hippie LGBTQ
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:45.840]  parents where they're having their little boys wear dresses and play with
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:49.960]  Barbie dolls but also cars and the girls and you can't even tell who's what
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:53.280]  what's what but the odd thing is it seems like they're always kind of pushing
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:56.440]  the little boys into the Barbies and stuff a little bit more than the then
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:03.000]  they're pushing the girls into you know Xbox or Ninja Turtles

[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:41.840]  Brantz to write this book and think that it's even gonna make any sense to two
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:46.000]  year olds but it's another thing that be having it being published and
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.960]  distributed by Disney but is it any wonder when you've seen this whole
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:57.120]  pedophile complete corrupt culture in Hollywood and in big corporations like
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:01.040]  Disney we've seen the Weinstein scandal we've seen all of these scandals
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:06.640]  Corey Feldman coming out talking about pedophilia in the movie industry so when
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:11.920]  you see things like you know promoting little children to take off their pants
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:18.240]  it's no surprise when you find out that it's Disney and of course their first
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:23.240]  word is not papa it smashed the patriarchy that the big mega corporations
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:27.040]  that run slave factories in China came up with how do we make the public
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:30.960]  become enslaved well just sabotage their family they'll be so pathetic they'll
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:35.880]  never stop us sir good and then even Sean Parker comes out and tells you it's
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:40.280]  the plan and you don't care because you're Lauren Brantz and you're paid for to
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:45.280]  do this and she's got her little sickening event because most people that
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:50.160]  read Buzzfeed obviously don't have children that's admitted so you go
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:55.600]  there she has a weekly cartoon putting down family putting down sexes putting
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:59.280]  down men and women I mean talk about a cult like space aliens arrived and said
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:03.000]  there are no women there are no children stop having children your baby
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:11.960]  doesn't want to come out because Trump is here and it goes on and on and on the
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:17.160]  dad says his baby's beautiful but see that's a microaggression she does cough
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:21.760]  cough cough I'm smart and capable to yeah absolutely daddy you don't say I'm
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:25.840]  beautiful that was hateful of daddy that's half me that they've liked to me
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:30.760]  it's just teaching her kids to be total basket cases freaking out over what
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:35.400]  words people use because they're about to get useless college educations this
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:38.680]  is the rearguard action of the folks that sold them worthless educations to
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:42.520]  turn them into jibbering basket cases so they never figure out who screwed them
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:48.120]  over so there you go feminist baby sexualizing children targeting
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:52.800]  children like true predators and on store shelves at Target we gotta stop
[02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:56.680]  shopping with all these people after years of research working with top
[02:04:56.680 --> 02:05:00.560]  developers here in the United States with the latest cutting-edge science
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:07.440]  we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids one of them is a powerful
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:12.560]  pro digestive enzyme carnivore for being able to break down meat other
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:18.880]  proteins better and then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:24.360]  culture of the very best strains in fluorolive advanced restoration and we
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:29.160]  also have an everyday extremely affordable fluorolive everyday maintenance
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:35.600]  but all of these are the very cutting-edge top-of-the-line probiotics and
[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:41.440]  digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price that is my goal here
[02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:46.360]  is to bring you the very best at the lowest price when you purchase it an
[02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:51.280]  m4store.com you know you are also financing the attack on the globalist
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:57.120]  and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide from the front lines
[02:05:57.120 --> 02:06:03.040]  of the information war it's Alex Jones
[02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:26.560]  in all major cultures targeting children with religion with political ideas
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:33.200]  with medical operations with drugs is illegal because it's up to the parents
[02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:36.240]  it's up to their grandparents is up to the community how they want them to be
[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:40.160]  introduced to the world but for the advertisers and the big global combines
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:46.120]  they crave more than anything on earth early access to your children so they
[02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:53.800]  can habituate them or train them and create attitudes and behaviors and
[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:59.280]  habits that literally let them own your child now a good parent teaches children
[02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:03.360]  to think for themselves teaches them the classics about how to think about how
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:09.680]  big the universe is the relationship to others but if you look at modern leftist
[02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:13.480]  agenda it's the opposite of what classical leftist like Thomas Jefferson
[02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:19.320]  would teach like feminist baby a book we reviewed that shows the sexualization
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:23.280]  of little girls and little boys and like their pent-up girls sticking their
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:26.440]  butts out and that you know they're feminist and they throw fits and they
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:30.080]  can be boys if they want I mean if you wanted to create a mentally ill person
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:34.880]  that ends up being a basket case this is how you do it but it's by design this
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:41.880]  is an this is a virus a political virus to absolutely break down society and
[02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:50.760]  culture but that said we now have us legislator calls out EA games the
[02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:54.360]  biggest in the world and Disney's predatory practices would Star Wars
[02:07:54.360 --> 02:08:01.280]  themed online casino you know I ran into this about six seven years ago my son
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:05.600]  Rex who you all knows a great guy and he's 15 years old now but back when he
[02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:10.760]  was about I don't know eight nine years old maybe younger it was longer than
[02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:15.160]  maybe six seven years old he stayed with my parents for the weekend and they
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:19.760]  let him use their iPhone to play a video game that looked innocuous where you
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:24.960]  battled dragons but then I I got him back on Monday he stayed there over the
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:30.120]  weekend while my former wife and I went out on a vacation short vacation to the
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:34.760]  beach and and we came back and my parents a few weeks later said my gosh we
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:39.800]  had a $400 bill on our credit card Rex was playing this I forget the name of
[02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:41.840]  it some dragon game you're trying to get treasure
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:51.480]  and it was six seven eight years ago right when iPhones have come out and then I learned later that even though my
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:54.880]  children didn't have iPhones they would ask me to download games and I learned
[02:08:54.880 --> 02:09:01.640]  almost every time that it was military games or geometric games or Pac-Man type
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:08.480]  games that just to even be able to win the level you have to pay money this
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:13.880]  just happened on vacation about six months ago I was in Hawaii with my
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:19.780]  children and on the plane they said hey dad we've downloaded this game can we
[02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:24.280]  play it and I said once we land you can and it was it was what's the game
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:28.080]  super doodle were you like what's the game where you have like a long nose and
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:32.360]  you jump upwards as you go up again I'm teleprompter free I don't pre-plan the
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:36.360]  stuff I'm talking about doodle jump doodle jump doodle jump so they're
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:40.920]  playing doodle jump in the taxi to the hotel and we get to the hotel and we're
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:43.800]  checking in and now we're in the room and I go let's go to the beach and they
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:50.640]  go hold on dad I've I've almost gotten past the level but if you'll just pay
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:55.720]  $5 I can clear this last level and I went doodle jump that I played at the
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:10:01.160]  arcade or that I even had on a desktop it costs money now like it's a coin
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:06.640]  machine in my house so talk about exploitation of children it's still
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:13.760]  ongoing but imagine in a few hours playing on my dad's iPhone years ago my
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:21.000]  son racked up four hundred dollars in charges tied to his Apple ID and to his
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:28.760]  credit card and so now we've got EA one of the biggest or not the biggest video
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:34.320]  game manufacturers and producers and actual game creators and Disney working
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:39.680]  together to target kids with Star Wars games where you get tricked into paying
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:45.480]  money to be able to play the game even though it's supposedly a free game so
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:49.760]  now representative Chris Lee Democrat of Hawaii held a press conference to talk
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:56.440]  about this this is the casino gulag that eight nine years ago Max Kaiser was
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:01.840]  told by high-level folks in New York was the plan so this is where they are it's
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:05.240]  very predatory it's whether targeting our children we should all be aware of
[02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:13.560]  it here it is we are here today to ensure future protections for kids youth
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:18.720]  and everyone when it comes to the spread of predatory practices in online
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:23.560]  gaming and the significant financial consequences that it can have on families
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:28.560]  and has been having on families around this nation this game is a Star Wars
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:34.640]  themed online casino designed to lure kids into spending money it's a trap and
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:38.720]  this is something that we need to address to ensure that particularly kids
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:43.920]  who are underage and pause or not back this up it's a trap like Admiral Ackbar
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:48.440]  would say that's what the wiki leaks and that's what the Facebook and that's
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:51.840]  what the Twitter and Google document show is that we're exploiting you we're
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:56.840]  making you alone we're giving you anxiety then we're getting your money
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:03.240]  they're not like selling you something you need like a car or medicine or close
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:08.080]  great it's no no no get you in here suck your parents money out and not let
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:13.320]  your parents even know what you bought into let's continue a Star Wars themed
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:20.280]  online casino designed to lure kids into spending money it's a trap and this is
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:23.280]  something that we need to address to ensure that particularly kids who are
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:29.880]  underage who are not psychologically and and emotionally mature enough to be
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:34.680]  able to gamble which is why gambling is prohibited under 21 are protected from
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:39.960]  being trapped into these cycles which have compelled many folks to spend
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:45.080]  thousands of dollars in gaming fees online we're looking at legislation this
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:49.240]  coming year which could prohibit access or prohibit the sale of these games to
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:53.480]  folks who are underage in order to protect families as well as prohibiting
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:57.040]  different kinds of mechanisms in those games we've been talking with several
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:01.320]  other states as well legislators there who are looking at the same thing I
[02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:05.080]  think this is an appropriate time to make sure that these issues are addressed
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:09.000]  before this becomes the new norm for every game one of the things that's
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:13.120]  really disturbing about this to me is that this is previously a business
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:17.040]  practice that was mostly seen in the mobile gaming market on your iPad your
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:22.320]  iPod games and now it's moved into the main event this is a triple A title
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:28.280]  that's being released by the world's largest gaming studio and it has the
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:31.440]  most popular intellectual property in the world attached to it and it's
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:35.240]  marketed squarely at children some of you folks who are a little older may
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:39.840]  remember a character by the name of Joe Camel he's not around anymore and we
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:43.720]  didn't allow Joe Camel to encourage your kids to smoke cigarettes and we
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:48.040]  shouldn't allow Star Wars to encourage your kids to gamble that's right Disney
[02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:52.120]  is over here targeting and sexualizing your children with feminist baby with
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:56.680]  her sticking your butt out saying I'm sexy you know I'm a sex symbol I don't
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:00.400]  wear pants if I don't want to I'm a feminist I can be a boy if I want to
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:04.880]  and finally saying feminist baby can be whatever she dreams but you're gonna
[02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:08.720]  tell her what to dream right we're gonna buy this at Target put out by Disney
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:14.440]  and then we've got Disney over here hiring convicted pedophiles to run
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:19.280]  movie productions with children and Harvey Weinstein's the guy hiring him
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:25.520]  well I tell you imagine the top folks that defend Harvey Weinstein what type
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:29.720]  of people are they I think we're gonna be learning here on the air very very
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:37.080]  soon about those types of individuals but this is it and just like Sean Parker
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:42.680]  former president of Facebook said two weeks ago we exploit you with dopamine
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:48.440]  and psychological warfare it's designed to manipulate and control you to not
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:53.880]  empower you but to make you weak and make you depressed and make you controlled
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:15:01.400]  so we can run and destroy your life fully control you fully dominate you and
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:06.880]  now I can't believe my blind spot that I knew about these gambling games six seven
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:11.680]  years ago you can hand your child your iPhone for an hour you got a $400 bill
[02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:16.520]  on your hands why didn't I ever cover this thank God this this this Democrat

[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:27.640]  again I just ran into doodle jump six months ago is now paid to get past the
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:31.840]  level it will not let you get past unless you pay money and they're not
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:35.360]  telling you when you download it that's the case and it's tied to your credit
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:40.480]  card so we've got regular gambling you know why not put casinos and inside the
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:44.840]  public schools we've got it controlled for a reason and it shows how exploitive
[02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:49.080]  the left is and how they're targeting children it's about controlling markets
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:56.240]  and absolutely wrecking society have you ever lost your power and wanted to

[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:21.320]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:28.400]  lines of the info war okay I began to get politically aware 25 years ago I'd
[02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:31.800]  read about globalist organizations and their goals and I would read the name
[02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:36.800]  Ted Malik and Ted Malik again is served on the executive board of the World
[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:41.280]  Economic Forum that's one of the most powerful public globalist organizations
[02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:45.600]  have not the most powerful but then even before he began to get really critical
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:48.600]  of it in the last 10 years I'd already you know read some of his writings that
[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:52.960]  were promoting kind of an Americana system worldwide but since he's been
[02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:56.440]  joining us the last year and a half wow what what a great asset to have joined
[02:20:56.440 --> 02:21:00.200]  us because he predicted the beginning of the breakup of the EU many years ago
[02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:04.880]  we're now seeing that accelerate I want him to chronicle since he last joined us
[02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:09.920]  a few months ago what's happened since then attempts to prop up this anti-free
[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:15.880]  market facade it's attacks on families it's political goals why it's ally with
[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:20.400]  the most radical forms of Islam and then what he really thinks Trump is up to
[02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:26.680]  trying to counter this Ted Malik Ted Malik.com joins us also has a new book
[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:31.160]  out we'll tell you a little bit about coming up later dealing with business
[02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:36.440]  common sense business and more in fact here it is right here I've taken my
[02:21:36.440 --> 02:21:40.560]  copy home and read it a month ago but Nico just hand me another copy principles
[02:21:40.560 --> 02:21:45.400]  for profitable leadership so clearly the whole agenda of the globalist is to
[02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:49.680]  make you Steinmeade to handicap you so they can have an organized centralized
[02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:54.080]  economy well we know from North Korea Venezuela Cuba Russia under communism
[02:21:54.080 --> 02:21:58.360]  that is a nightmare we know the free market systems the way to go so in this
[02:21:58.360 --> 02:22:02.120]  segment let me just get the weather forecast from him when we see their
[02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:05.840]  their attempts to overthrow Trump saying as a Russian agent we see the attempts
[02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:12.120]  to stop nationalism in Europe is it fair to say it's failing with Merkel about
[02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:16.760]  to be out McCron's trying to sound like that's coming up next segment a populist
[02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:23.360]  now I mean I mean really in evidence we see victory but in rhetoric I hear them
[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:28.640]  saying we've all been defeated what's the what's the truth from your perspective
[02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:35.200]  well the truth is the battle is still on and we have seriously not won that
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:41.600]  battle the war is is maybe in the early stages and I think that we have to take
[02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:47.200]  it to them I just got out of the year the the British Parliament I was just
[02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:52.000]  there minutes ago and I was talking to a number of conservative MPs and I would
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:57.160]  say there's only a fraction of those British conservative MPs will understand
[02:22:57.160 --> 02:23:03.760]  the war that we're facing and the fact that socialism and worse are at their
[02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:07.760]  doorsteps in some in some ways some of them even capitulate to the
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:14.480]  centralizing and statist orientations in Europe so it's it's a fraction of
[02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:18.760]  conservatives frankly that know what we're up against whether it's in the
[02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:22.720]  United States in the Republican Party or in the Conservative Party of Great
[02:23:22.720 --> 02:23:27.840]  Britain when you get to the continent in Europe it's even a smaller number so
[02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:32.080]  we're fighting the battle but the war is still very much on and I just I just
[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:37.120]  heard your last segment to tie into it Alex the war is also one in the culture
[02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:42.680]  it's not just in politics this globalist orientation is out to destroy our
[02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:47.880]  families destroy our cultures and I've written about this recently to take away
[02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:52.960]  the entire virtue of manliness and we're gonna talk about that because I was
[02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:55.960]  gonna get into that day it's funny you sent me an article unbeknownst we're on
[02:23:55.960 --> 02:24:02.160]  the same wavelength here but what you said is very very critical I think
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:08.320]  really astute yes it's a tiny minority of leadership against corrupt
[02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:13.560]  authoritarian globalism but all over the world it's super hot and people are
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:17.880]  hungry for it it's like there's the market people want it it's good it makes
[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:22.400]  sense it works the best it's been tested over and over again but then there's not
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:27.480]  that many high priests of it is what's funny and so many people buy into the
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:31.480]  globalist model they think cozying up to it will give them personal power from a
[02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:34.240]  Machiavellian perspective and I'm not saying this to be Machiavellian is just
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:39.600]  true the greatest place to get personal success and power and morally so help
[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:44.480]  people would to get back into Americana free market and anti-authoritarian
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:49.160]  globalism I mean it's crazy it's super hot Trump gets it he's he's leading it
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:52.600]  but there aren't other people jumping on board even though the population's
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:59.080]  ready I agree Peter Teal who's quite an astute observer and of course a very
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:06.280]  wealthy Silicon Valley investor said that there's a there's a bull market in
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:11.120]  free market politics and we have to we have to ride this bull market and I
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:15.080]  think Trump is doing precisely that it's a very critical juncture this week in
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:20.680]  the United States the Brexit decision is actually at a critical turning point in
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:25.400]  the next month and in Europe there are a number of political elections coming up
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:30.440]  early in the next year in Italy and in other countries where we can take this
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:35.800]  fight to them and move it to the next level you're the expert in Europe and
[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:38.160]  again you know your degree and your whole background is understanding
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:42.480]  communities and global markets and you know how they all tie together as
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:45.960]  international political economy so geopolitical economy system and
[02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:50.720]  understanding those interactions but you see Italy voting against EU expansion
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:54.520]  you see France politically moving away you see Merkel in deep trouble you see
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:58.200]  Czech Republic voting to be anti-globalist you see Austria voting in a
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:01.960]  patriot I mean it and it goes on and on I mean that's what I'm saying all the
[02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:07.520]  indicators show when when when right if you look at the barometer there's a lot
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:12.280]  of wins that's not to say that we've again won the war and it's not to say
[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:17.880]  that you know the EU is not going to fight back that there aren't globalists
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:24.120]  I mean all over the place in the media in politics in the culture so by no
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:30.320]  means is this a done deal it's just that the tide is falling out and Trump and
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:35.640]  Brexit are frankly the bellwethers when it comes to that tide so we need to keep
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:42.240]  pushing every front we need to defend the family we need defend religious
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:46.960]  institutions across the board no one denomination all them we need to defend
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:52.720]  our civic associations we need to defend our free schools we need to defend our
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:57.680]  free-thinking think tanks particularly those that favor free market oriented
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:03.360]  policies and we need to basically I want to challenge your audience we need to
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:09.800]  buy and shop at those companies that are part of a domestic supply chain and
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:13.880]  what you just said is the total revolution spend some time on that
[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:17.440]  before you go to break economically voting with your dollars that's one of
[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:24.400]  the greatest powers we have indeed we have the wallet and I'm not saying we
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:28.440]  need to boycott everything or we need to you know use all the tricks of the left
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:34.360]  well yeah nobody's perfect but just be conscious of your power you had a great
[02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:38.560]  segment you just talked about Disney and other country companies that are
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:45.640]  exploiting young children well let's teach Disney a lesson well I want to
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:48.120]  hear about this we got about a minute till break how do you think we do that
[02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:54.280]  sir well I think we look at the businesses where Disney is is doing
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:57.960]  those things and we basically say we're not putting up with that any longer
[02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:02.520]  we're not buying the books that they put out we're not attending the movies that
[02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:06.680]  they want us to attend we're not gonna watch their channel we're gonna turn it
[02:28:06.680 --> 02:28:12.960]  off and maybe parents can take control again I mean this is a is also a really
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:19.640]  radical idea maybe we can have in loco parentus again in families and parents
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:24.960]  can be parents for a change and can you believe in 2017 that's a radical
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:30.960]  statement I mean wow how far we've slid and hit the book is common sense
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:33.960]  business principles for profit leadership I learned so much from the book
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:37.320]  you can get it obviously everywhere but I again I wouldn't get it from the big
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:41.720]  globalist combines I buy directly from his side or your local bookstore because
[02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:44.360]  if you don't keep those places alive they're gonna have one big giant

[02:31:56.920 --> 02:32:01.200]  congress sure has a lot on the agenda including reauthorization of mass
[02:32:01.200 --> 02:32:05.520]  surveillance the current authorization for the controversial section 702
[02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:09.600]  expires December 31st and it's the first time Congress has faced
[02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:14.400]  reauthorization since Edward Snowden revealed the NSA's mass surveillance
[02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:19.040]  apparatus civil libertarians have urged Congress to take this reauthorization
[02:32:19.040 --> 02:32:23.400]  as an opportunity to implement meaningful reforms to shield innocent
[02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:27.080]  Americans from mass surveillance but with the clock running out Congress appears
[02:32:27.080 --> 02:32:31.360]  poised to just jam through reauthorization meanwhile the Supreme Court
[02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:35.960]  has just took up a blockbuster case the privacy of emails photos stored in the
[02:32:35.960 --> 02:32:40.240]  cloud even heart rate history from a smartwatch could be at stake the case
[02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:44.280]  carpenter versus us will determine whether the history of cell phone
[02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:48.800]  locations stored by a phone service provider is searchable without a warrant
[02:32:48.800 --> 02:32:55.000]  it's a legal theory known as the third-party doctrine leon macadoo info wars.com
[02:32:55.000 --> 02:33:00.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:19.880]  it's the most wonderful time you know going back 10 years ago out here the
[02:33:19.880 --> 02:33:24.560]  war on Christmas and I think oh that's made up I did more research that's how
[02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:27.240]  they were like banning people handing out Christmas cards schools let your
[02:33:27.240 --> 02:33:32.080]  first-member right it's not the school that official religion and then now it's
[02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:35.800]  just everywhere the demonization the attacks by the way speaking of this
[02:33:35.800 --> 02:33:41.360]  info you can't find anywhere where I said that there are slave colonies on
[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:46.000]  Mars I don't believe any humans have been to Mars I believe we sent rovers to
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:50.680]  Mars I never said that they say I said we didn't have a moon mission I
[02:33:50.680 --> 02:33:54.120]  absolutely I've had dinner with them I've hung out with Buzz Aldrin had him on
[02:33:54.120 --> 02:33:58.240]  the show I believe we've been to the moon he told me they had a lot of secret
[02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:01.640]  stuff that he couldn't talk about and later that came out in the news the
[02:34:01.640 --> 02:34:04.920]  reason I raised that is they just brought in these stacks of news I saw this
[02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:09.280]  yesterday I didn't respond but I guess they put it now and hundreds of
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:13.680]  publications so now it's a new big push so I should respond just briefly this is
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:18.480]  out of the New York Daily News this is International Business Times that's a
[02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:24.800]  bunch of others Alex Jones claims Las Vegas massacre was phony Alex Jones
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:30.080]  suggests the Vegas massacre was shooting was fake I did not say that
[02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:35.720]  Zach who was in Army Special Operations Command and I've confirmed who he is and
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:39.560]  he's actually been contacted by the feds over and I'm not supposed to get into it
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:45.960]  it's this is not a Netflix series okay this is actually the real deal okay
[02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:49.480]  because it's true they don't just come kill you they ask you to stop talking
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:52.520]  about it just like stranger things or something
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:58.120]  Zach we know Zach is he sent us his info months ago I looked up who the caller
[02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:02.520]  was couldn't believe it the voice matches did a Skype with him to confirm it
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:07.000]  and he's telling us what really happened in Vegas and how it was this Islamic
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:11.240]  Civil War and what Trump was doing next the FBI came and grabbed him he's now
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:16.080]  left the country he's part Muslim is his mother was Muslim I'm not gonna say
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:20.040]  we is he's actually been in the news before as a famous intelligence analyst
[02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:25.600]  and and and army you know hero and stuff and so I'm explaining that the
[02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:31.000]  official story of it being one lone guy is his phonies the $3 bill they just
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:34.800]  come out edit it together and say that I said it didn't happen this is what they
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:40.680]  do but clearly they're major league threatened by this so I want to say I
[02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:44.640]  don't know anything else that Zach told me off air because I don't let people
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:47.880]  tell me secret stuff off air if you're gonna say it say on air but he didn't
[02:35:47.880 --> 02:35:52.560]  say anything secret he gave his opinion as a citizen of what's happening he's
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:57.000]  now left the US we checked the caller ID we've got that on the phone system he
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:02.520]  he called from Morocco so this isn't make believe this is the real show where
[02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:07.800]  we have guests at fleet of Morocco okay so this is going on now Ted Malik you
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:10.920]  know he's the former board member of the Davos group and you know head up the
[02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:15.040]  Aspen Institute has met the very highest levels of the system it's not all one
[02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:19.480]  monolithic system but he's been criticizing globalism being authoritarian
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:23.160]  for a long time so I want to give him the floor now to get into what's
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:25.640]  happening with Brexit what's happening in Europe what's happening with these
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:30.240]  fights with the unelected EU he heads up the Theodore Roosevelt Institute as
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:35.960]  well he's got the new book out common sense business but I'm sorry I had to
[02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:38.940]  segue with that they're just really hitting us with with with this
[02:36:38.940 --> 02:36:47.880]  information well what's happening in Europe is clearly that nation states
[02:36:47.880 --> 02:36:55.800]  are trying to reassert their influence and their importance in this era of a
[02:36:55.800 --> 02:37:02.600]  new world economic order and of globalism so the powers that be whether
[02:37:02.600 --> 02:37:08.720]  it's the United Nations or the European Union or any one of their agents and
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:12.840]  there are a number of them particularly in the world of publications in the
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:18.280]  world of media are trying to snuff out and put down all of these national
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:25.520]  leaders whether it's urban in Hungary the presidency in Poland the Brexit Nigel
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:32.400]  of Raj and the Conservatives in the UK anywhere that this occurs they'd like to
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:37.920]  put it out put the fire out put it away demonize it call them racist call them
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:44.720]  all names but the fact is that this is a growing crescendo that this ball is like
[02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:50.040]  a snowball rolling down the mountain and more and more entities more and more
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:54.400]  people more and more communities more and more nation states are now saying
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:59.600]  we've had enough we're taking back control we are going to be independent
[02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:06.400]  everywhere I go they pick up Trump's line we're going to make Italy great again
[02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:12.360]  we're gonna make Poland great again we're gonna make Romania great again you
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:17.920]  can fill in the blank so he has unleashed something it's a power in the world
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:24.240]  that has to do with the resurgence of the nation state and again I agree we
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:27.040]  shouldn't put too positive a prognosis on this because we're having a lot of
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:30.160]  victories but they're pushing back there's they're striking back they're
[02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:34.680]  getting more nasty they're suing everybody in tarnation that just tries to
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:39.720]  promote free market they're getting more and more shrill just at a gut level
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:43.160]  mr. Malik is you know you're a smart guy it's how you got to be one of the board
[02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:47.240]  members of the Davos group and so respected across the world what is the
[02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:51.200]  sense not just of yourself but other people who are pragmatic free market
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:56.520]  common sense successful world citizens and none of us are against being a world
[02:38:56.520 --> 02:39:01.360]  citizen which against forced globalism what is your pragmatic sense versus what
[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:06.000]  these zealots are pushing they're like rabid dogs because we don't want an
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:13.440]  unelected EU I mean what's their problem well I think that if you look at the you
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:18.160]  know man and woman in the street obviously they don't know everything
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:23.640]  that's happening but they see this burdensome regulatory state which is
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:30.320]  very taxing which dries up the cost of goods which has basically seen all of
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:35.280]  or many of their manufacturing jobs flee to other countries like China and
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:40.280]  Mexico and they're saying we have to push back we have to have other kinds of
[02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:46.000]  political leaders to take this fight to the globalists if you take the the
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:52.440]  discussion within the political circles I think that they're still a minority of
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:58.600]  people but they're ascended who are able to coalesce different coalitions
[02:39:58.600 --> 02:40:03.840]  exactly and if it's ascended and it's historical and it's renaissance base and
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:08.680]  it's unstoppable if people get behind it why aren't more people joining it and
[02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:12.000]  that's what I'm saying the paradox of it's super popular it's the sexiest
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:19.240]  avant-garde thing and then there's so few leaders in it well I think there are
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:25.600]  leaders and we have to you know applaud those who have stepped out of the
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:29.920]  establishment to be that kind of leader sure yourselves and people like Matt
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:34.840]  drudge or Ron Paul or Donald Trump or Nigel Farage I mean yes I mean I know
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:37.520]  there are a lot of great leaders hundreds but per capita you should have
[02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:44.080]  thousands of leaders correct and we should have more alternative outlets we
[02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:50.360]  should have more radio and television broadcasts we could even penetrate
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:54.720]  universities and think tanks I think more than we're doing so I'm not saying
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:58.300]  that we should have a five-year plan that this is going to be centrally planned a
[02:40:58.300 --> 02:41:04.280]  lot of it is spontaneous a lot of it just you know sort of takes place but we
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:10.000]  have to encourage and fan those flames so I'm I'm actually from where I sit I'm
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:15.680]  mildly if not more than mildly encouraged by what I see happening I agree but
[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:18.640]  let's look at worst case scenario briefly we'll come back into manliness and
[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:22.520]  the big article you want to get into another topic you want to cover again
[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:25.960]  mr. Malik author of common sense business and then you know former one of
[02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:29.800]  the managers of the Davos group let's talk worst case scenario how can the
[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:38.000]  Empire of status strike back well I think that they control the media to a
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:42.600]  large extent at least the mainstream media so they try to choke us off they
[02:41:42.600 --> 02:41:47.720]  obviously are bringing lawsuits against alternative voices they are trying to
[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:53.960]  paint everyone who criticizes them with you know a very dark rush calling us
[02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:59.480]  names authoritarian and worse so that they have their means and we have to
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:04.840]  basically be aware of what they're doing how they're doing it and people like
[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:08.760]  Soros who are funding it that's right we've got to alert the people that are
[02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:12.480]  out there you're not just followers we're not communist you are the vanguard
[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:15.280]  the listeners and people that watch this show are people that have been
[02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:18.480]  politically involved and aware of this for decades you're the brain trust you're
[02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:22.160]  the reason we're here I don't just say patronizingly you're right beside us you
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:26.920]  are not just beside us they're the heart of this
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:33.560]  populist movement that means that it is not only popular but it's something that
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:39.800]  the average normal person needs to join it needs to resist and it needs to
[02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:45.440]  basically vote with their mind share vote with their political vote and also
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:49.320]  this is very critical I think we need to learn how to do this vote with our
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:54.680]  wallets that's right we'll be back folks stay with us I know I don't have to
[02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:59.240]  remind most of you of the fact that culturally societally economically
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:04.440]  spiritually militarily the planet's sitting on top of giant time with
[02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:09.520]  populations and globalism and the neural orders manipulation of people's
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:14.160]  minds things are getting crazy we're trying to fix the country and fix the
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:18.880]  planet we've also got to have rearguard actions to be prepared the number one

[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:26.440]  they were charging people a hundred two hundred dollars for the formula and I
[02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:30.520]  came up with our own formula working with scientists and developers non GMO

[02:44:55.160 --> 02:45:00.160]  fake news has become so synonymous with CNN the news network wants to ban it
[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:05.200]  CNN is now pushing an effort to ban the term fake news an opinion piece argues
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:09.400]  that the term has become meaningless and lost its power because politicians have
[02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:14.040]  hijacked it as a way to undermine the media establishment the authors to cry
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:17.880]  the fact that a majority of people now believe the mainstream media pedals
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:22.400]  fabricated stories of course the real reason media elites want to clamp down
[02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:26.880]  on the term fake news is because its original intention to smear and
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:31.240]  discredit any dissenting opinions has completely backfired this was
[02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:35.600]  illustrated yet again by president Trump's latest triggering tweet when he
[02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:39.880]  suggested that a fake news trophy should be awarded to the network that has been
[02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:43.840]  responsible for the most inaccurate reporting the fake news narrative is
[02:45:43.840 --> 02:45:47.800]  actually acted as a boomerang showing the mainstream media to be the most

[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:25.520]  alex jones right ted malik's our guest you can follow him on twitter at ted
[02:47:25.520 --> 02:47:31.160]  malik very important to do that during the break I was back there in the
[02:47:31.160 --> 02:47:35.800]  break room getting a glass of iced tea and I saw it on fox news on the bottom
[02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:40.640]  of the screen donald trump is a destructive force for america okay the
[02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:45.960]  stock market's up hundreds of billions of new jobs 1.6 million new jobs double
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:51.080]  the amount of veterans getting service 70% less illegals coming across
[02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:55.640]  optimism up crushing the back of political correctness making americans
[02:47:55.640 --> 02:48:03.640]  feel good again on and on and on and so we've got davos man on who says davos
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:08.680]  man is dead that's ted malik i mean the consummate insider but never a bad guy
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:13.320]  promoting americana from the inside and they're saying trump is a currently
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:18.200]  destructive force and this is what the republicans on again if i put gas in my
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:22.920]  card it runs smooth and i get good gas mileage it's good gas if i put bad gas
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:28.440]  in it sputters and smoke comes out i know that place has got bad gas we've
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:32.520]  gone from sputtering and backfiring and on fire to start to cruise pretty smooth
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:36.600]  down the road they're going that's bad gas that's bad gas and i'm like pretty
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:40.120]  good gas so ted malik what do you make of that and then we get in this article
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:46.440]  you sent me that i was reading from american greatness calm the forgotten
[02:48:46.440 --> 02:48:50.760]  great american male who's your daddy and again in any culture the strength of
[02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:52.920]  the men and the women is the strength of the culture
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:56.280]  this men and women against each other and then the quotes they've got of james
[02:48:56.280 --> 02:48:58.520]  dean in here and what does it mean to me a man
[02:48:58.520 --> 02:49:02.520]  this is pretty powerful but just briefly how do you gauge a trump presidency
[02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:06.360]  well i mean i gauge it by stability and the economy
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:10.200]  and and and and optimism and it hasn't been this good since the middle of the
[02:49:10.200 --> 02:49:15.480]  reagan administration well that's that's actually a very good
[02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:19.160]  a trajectory because we are back now i think
[02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:23.560]  through the period when ronald reagan through supply side economics
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:27.560]  and cultural transformation saw america come back and
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:32.200]  and i still hear the music in my left ear it's morning in america
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:35.800]  again and i i think we're going to see we are beginning to see that
[02:49:35.800 --> 02:49:38.600]  and with the tax package if it goes through now
[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:43.480]  we'll see an even bigger swing the stock market continues to go up
[02:49:43.480 --> 02:49:47.240]  unemployment is down confidence is way up every single number
[02:49:47.240 --> 02:49:52.200]  i was just as i told you with a number of europe
[02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:56.440]  conservative politicians in the uk those people are excited about donald
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:49:59.880]  trump coming to the uk to meet the queen
[02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:02.920]  for a state visit probably in february
[02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:06.520]  because the uk needs to take a lesson from
[02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:11.000]  the donald trump playbook uh so the rest of the world
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:17.720]  needs to watch what trump is doing and actually take notes and i'll say this
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:21.320]  growing up all those sentimentality and everything i thought it was annoying
[02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:24.440]  but now that i realize there are forces that want to remove all that
[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:28.120]  now i realize how precious it is because it's easy to be young and dumb and
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:31.480]  rebellious but then once you get older and you see wait we're replacing stuff
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:35.320]  that was the vanguard of revolutionary human empowerment
[02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:40.040]  with a bunch of old-fashioned tyranny i don't want that
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:44.840]  well i i mean i wrote this article for instance and then i think that
[02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:49.320]  politics is downstream from culture so our culture has become
[02:50:49.320 --> 02:50:55.960]  uh very coarse very pornographic and very anti-man so i asked the question
[02:50:55.960 --> 02:51:01.320]  have we lost this virtue of manliness you know whatever happened to manhood
[02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:05.080]  uh boys are not doing as well in school
[02:51:05.080 --> 02:51:09.080]  uh their males are seen as bad men live shorter lives
[02:51:09.080 --> 02:51:11.960]  so you wrote in defensive masculinity i've got this other one it doesn't say
[02:51:11.960 --> 02:51:13.880]  who wrote it it's an excellent article i read it
[02:51:13.880 --> 02:51:17.960]  during the breaks the forgotten great american male which one of these is yours
[02:51:17.960 --> 02:51:21.640]  no those are both my articles so i'm trying to beat this drug you know not
[02:51:21.640 --> 02:51:25.240]  as some kind of warrior who shoots his dinner every night
[02:51:25.240 --> 02:51:28.200]  uh okay well just to be clear the internet cut off your name yeah these
[02:51:28.200 --> 02:51:31.960]  really are great can i post these info wars
[02:51:31.960 --> 02:51:36.520]  absolutely the question is james deans question
[02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:43.080]  from rebel without a cause uh that is a 1955 movie a classic
[02:51:43.080 --> 02:51:48.840]  when his son asks them what do you do when you have to be a man
[02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:53.800]  and the answer today is i don't know worse still i don't have a clue i have no
[02:51:53.800 --> 02:51:58.920]  guideline i have no rules i have no masters i have no script
[02:51:58.920 --> 02:52:05.320]  so that's why i facetiously ask who is your daddy in the year 2025
[02:52:05.320 --> 02:52:08.040]  well that's critical and instead they're telling little boys you're really a
[02:52:08.040 --> 02:52:11.000]  girl to literally sabotage have you seen the
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:14.840]  shan parker videos where facebook admits it was a plan to sabotage
[02:52:14.840 --> 02:52:18.440]  people i mean this is cold-blooded
[02:52:18.440 --> 02:52:22.840]  oh i believe it is it's very calculated and we're trying they're trying to move
[02:52:22.840 --> 02:52:26.600]  us either to a girly man culture or to a
[02:52:26.600 --> 02:52:29.720]  androgynous culture so that there is no longer
[02:52:29.720 --> 02:52:33.960]  any notion of a kind of john wane or jimmy steward man
[02:52:33.960 --> 02:52:38.600]  and i think we have to fight back i know that you have a great father
[02:52:38.600 --> 02:52:41.560]  i have a great father i'd be willing to argue
[02:52:41.560 --> 02:52:45.800]  that most people who are successful in business most people have made a dent
[02:52:45.800 --> 02:52:49.480]  in the universe have had very significant parental
[02:52:49.480 --> 02:52:54.440]  and particularly father relationships so why would the establishment assault
[02:52:54.440 --> 02:52:56.680]  that i mean they tell us they don't want any competition
[02:52:56.680 --> 02:53:00.120]  it's like a grizzly bear that goes because if you don't have fathers and
[02:53:00.120 --> 02:53:03.320]  you don't have strong families then somebody else is going to
[02:53:03.320 --> 02:53:06.440]  take up that vacuum who's going to take up that vacuum
[02:53:06.440 --> 02:53:09.960]  that's going to be either feminist it's either going to be the state
[02:53:09.960 --> 02:53:13.480]  or it's going to be the global institutions and that's why
[02:53:13.480 --> 02:53:19.320]  at the local level at the family level at the parental level we have to
[02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:23.480]  take back and be responsible human beings
[02:53:23.480 --> 02:53:26.760]  plus we're happy when we do that that's when we're fulfilled
[02:53:26.760 --> 02:53:32.440]  being grovelant supine minions of the of the hollywood culture
[02:53:32.440 --> 02:53:36.520]  is a joke and i mean how does that fit in the collapse of hollywood
[02:53:36.520 --> 02:53:40.520]  and the whole collapse of their moral authority
[02:53:41.240 --> 02:53:44.680]  well i think this is this has happened very quickly here just frankly in the
[02:53:44.680 --> 02:53:48.920]  last few months when we see the whole thing is quite a paper tiger
[02:53:48.920 --> 02:53:53.000]  and it becomes very transparent what is happening in hollywood what they've
[02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:56.040]  tried to push on us and who some of their
[02:53:56.040 --> 02:54:00.120]  uh leading lights were whether it's a wine sign or
[02:54:00.120 --> 02:54:05.080]  kevin spacey or other demented people i mean even the media stars like charlie
[02:54:05.080 --> 02:54:10.280]  rose now have been exposed so uh i mean it's almost uh you know
[02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:15.480]  no day goes past now when we don't find you know another fallen victim to this
[02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:18.600]  false impression that's what i was about to say everything they were
[02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:22.360]  telling us about culture being rapist and evil i guess was projection because
[02:54:22.360 --> 02:54:25.400]  that's what they're doing like i'm not like running around just grabbing on
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:31.400]  women everywhere and this is like a like you said it's like a madness
[02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:34.840]  well it is basically taken over the culture
[02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:38.760]  and if we could get back to this virtue of manliness
[02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:44.440]  the notion of a gentle man which actually has a very long history and it
[02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:49.160]  has to do with flourishing human beings and strong cultures and these were
[02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:52.920]  rooted originally in christendom in western europe
[02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:55.800]  we'd be doing the entire world a great service
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:54:59.240]  wow well i really enjoyed reading your book a month ago and i got it folks of
[02:54:59.240 --> 02:55:01.720]  course can find it wherever they want to get it but if they buy it
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:05.160]  from a smaller site unlike amazon uh you know that would actually help fund the
[02:55:05.160 --> 02:55:07.960]  real economy but uh i hope you'll come back and join us
[02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:10.680]  soon i know you're going to be coming to austin soon so we should have you in
[02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:13.640]  studio not just have dinner look forward to having theater
[02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:17.720]  roosevelt malik uh in studio whether people can follow him on twitter
[02:55:17.720 --> 02:55:21.400]  at ted malik where else should folks follow you
[02:55:21.400 --> 02:55:25.480]  well i think twitter is the best place but just read these articles that we
[02:55:25.480 --> 02:55:29.720]  keep putting out and there are any number of great places i try to put them
[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:33.000]  and spray them all over uh some of them are in mainline
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:36.680]  media some of them are alternative media and then there's the number of books
[02:55:36.680 --> 02:55:40.760]  that i've written i think i've written 15 books so there's no shortage of places
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:44.920]  to go how many people in closing inside the main power
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:48.520]  structure because so many of my run into actually know what's going on
[02:55:48.520 --> 02:55:52.200]  but they say the big money men on top most of them uh you know want this
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:56.360]  authoritarian system what percentage of folks inside the power structure are
[02:55:56.360 --> 02:55:59.640]  like tuned into what you're tuned into versus i know it's an oversimplification
[02:55:59.640 --> 02:56:02.920]  but how many people are awake
[02:56:03.880 --> 02:56:09.080]  well i'd like to say that there's uh 10 or 15 percent that are there already
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:12.200]  there are probably another 10 or 15 percent that are
[02:56:12.200 --> 02:56:16.120]  inclined and willing and i've been you know obviously teaching in
[02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:19.880]  universities so i'm trying to influence the next generation of people
[02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:23.640]  i mean i think that we have to do those on every front i was for five years
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:28.040]  chairman of an organization called great dads which i recommend
[02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:33.000]  parents this is fathers covening making a covenant with their children to be

[02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:43.880]  attack by very cold-blooded people the future war is not
[02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:47.080]  targeting armies it's it's targeting people themselves

[03:00:15.880 --> 03:00:21.960]  live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones the global of social
[03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:26.600]  engineers are evil but they're also smart
[03:00:26.600 --> 03:00:31.320]  they're very cold-blooded and they know this assures the sun came up this
[03:00:31.320 --> 03:00:34.280]  morning that if they try to make their sons
[03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:37.480]  sit down when they go to the bathroom when they urinate
[03:00:37.480 --> 03:00:42.520]  and teach them their girls and take them to drag queen events where they got to
[03:00:42.520 --> 03:00:46.120]  give five dollar bills to naked and dancing men like to do here in awesome
[03:00:46.120 --> 03:00:50.200]  that of most those boys are going to rebel and want to be super alpha males
[03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:53.560]  let's see they got chemicals in the food and water they've got social
[03:00:53.560 --> 03:00:56.120]  suppression
[03:00:57.080 --> 03:01:03.640]  so that they can push as hard as they can to to actually
[03:01:03.640 --> 03:01:06.920]  politically go in
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:10.040]  and
[03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:16.680]  militarily or via force via the police keep people from breaking outside of
[03:01:16.680 --> 03:01:20.760]  those parameters now paul watson joins us taking over the
[03:01:20.760 --> 03:01:24.040]  sour. paul i saw a shocking report out of the
[03:01:24.040 --> 03:01:26.920]  express news out of the daily mail on a bright bar
[03:01:26.920 --> 03:01:29.960]  where they're going to have your girl scouts
[03:01:29.960 --> 03:01:34.280]  as they call them girl guides over there are now going to have 25 year old men
[03:01:34.280 --> 03:01:37.480]  leading them and they're going to take showers with the five year old girls
[03:01:37.480 --> 03:01:41.000]  that's been officially announced and i'm sure you saw a report
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:45.960]  that's up on info wars dot com the video now about feminist baby
[03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:50.280]  where the feminist baby is naked and she she's rebellious and she's a boy and
[03:01:50.280 --> 03:01:54.040]  i mean the full on assault on children by disney
[03:01:54.040 --> 03:01:58.040]  and all these people it's like what is their in game how did they get so
[03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:00.920]  organized what is going on again new disney book
[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:04.440]  targets babies for sexualization and gender confusion
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:10.280]  feminist baby it's up on info wars dot com paul what's your take on this
[03:02:10.280 --> 03:02:14.280]  well it's another example of the sickness that we're descending into
[03:02:14.280 --> 03:02:18.200]  the whole point about sexualizing children like i didn't even have any
[03:02:18.200 --> 03:02:21.880]  sexual thoughts whatsoever about anything till it's probably you know
[03:02:21.880 --> 03:02:26.520]  eight or nine it's like kids that age don't even involve them and they know
[03:02:26.520 --> 03:02:30.120]  if you sexualize them young it creates mental illness and
[03:02:30.120 --> 03:02:34.360]  degeneracy that's the plan exactly well what you've obviously got
[03:02:34.360 --> 03:02:38.200]  with a lot of this is parents transposing this idea that they need to
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:42.280]  brainwash their kids and that this is their role to be political social
[03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:46.440]  justice activists which is why now you have parents dressing up their little
[03:02:46.440 --> 03:02:50.360]  boys in pink dresses giving them toys even though all
[03:02:50.360 --> 03:02:54.600]  the science shows that boys girls naturally gravitate towards the
[03:02:54.600 --> 03:02:57.560]  toys that correspond with their biological gender
[03:02:57.560 --> 03:03:02.120]  that's science that's settle but you have these demented deranged parents
[03:03:02.120 --> 03:03:06.520]  who think that it's their duty not to say oh i'll let them decide and do whatever
[03:03:06.520 --> 03:03:12.280]  they want that's not even it they in but they overtly transpose their demented
[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:16.840]  social justice ideology onto their children and i mean that's child abuse
[03:03:16.840 --> 03:03:20.600]  if you're just as camille baglia said teaching a three-year-old they're really
[03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:25.160]  a girl or a boy when they're not that is child abuse
[03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:28.760]  exactly and they have all these viral videos alex where it's
[03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:33.000]  you know kids or teenagers who have transitioned into a different gender and
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:36.120]  like they actually look like the gender they've supposedly
[03:03:36.120 --> 03:03:40.360]  transitioned into and it's like this is the evil example that the right is
[03:03:40.360 --> 03:03:42.840]  throwing at you to say that this is all wrong no
[03:03:42.840 --> 03:03:47.640]  i mean we've had actual cases numerous different times where they've used this
[03:03:47.640 --> 03:03:50.600]  these transgender people and they're not even
[03:03:50.600 --> 03:03:55.160]  making the effort if you're a guy with a massive beard and you put on a dress
[03:03:55.160 --> 03:03:59.000]  that doesn't make you transgender you're a pervert and they've done it several
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.720]  times again we're not against anybody individually
[03:04:01.720 --> 03:04:07.480]  it's organized pushed to kids let them chase butterflies with a butterfly net
[03:04:07.480 --> 03:04:10.920]  or play badminton or go in the woods and do an egg hunt
[03:04:10.920 --> 03:04:14.840]  or or go to the planetarium don't teach them how to be trannies when they're
[03:04:14.840 --> 03:04:19.480]  two years old no i mean even if you talk to gay
[03:04:19.480 --> 03:04:23.240]  people like a lot of them actually went out with women and they weren't sure
[03:04:23.240 --> 03:04:27.400]  until they hit the late teens in some cases or at least mid teens
[03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:30.440]  now they're going in with like five six-year-old kids
[03:04:30.440 --> 03:04:34.440]  this is completely deranged alex all right stay there i'm gonna introduce you

[03:07:02.920 --> 03:07:06.280]  society they're following a scientific plan
[03:07:06.280 --> 03:07:09.320]  i'm not saying space aliens are running this
[03:07:09.320 --> 03:07:12.840]  but if you look at the culture attacks and the breakup of families and the
[03:07:12.840 --> 03:07:16.360]  chemicals in the food and water all of it
[03:07:16.360 --> 03:07:22.040]  is to end our species as we know it so we're on a planet in deep space all i'm
[03:07:22.040 --> 03:07:27.320]  saying is this is big and those of us resisting it
[03:07:27.320 --> 03:07:30.600]  the establishment can claim well you're just trying to keep a cancer going
[03:07:30.600 --> 03:07:34.200]  we're trying to save the earth from the cancer
[03:07:34.200 --> 03:07:38.120]  that's humanity if you believe them but then they're the ones involved in genetic
[03:07:38.120 --> 03:07:41.800]  engineering and chimeras and all the things that are actually
[03:07:41.800 --> 03:07:46.120]  damaging the earth and building more nuclear reactors
[03:07:46.120 --> 03:07:49.800]  you could say that they're just insane but there's a focused plan
[03:07:49.800 --> 03:07:53.720]  worldwide to break up families to poison the earth
[03:07:53.720 --> 03:07:56.760]  and to do this paul what do you think is at the bottom of the rabbit hole and
[03:07:56.760 --> 03:08:00.920]  then you take over and throw into this special report
[03:08:00.920 --> 03:08:03.960]  yeah it's a long video alex it's about eight minutes long so i'll probably go
[03:08:03.960 --> 03:08:06.600]  to it in the next segment where we get a chance but
[03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:10.760]  i mean look at modern art for example they've exalted ugliness as beauty now
[03:08:10.760 --> 03:08:13.800]  you're getting students at university level being
[03:08:13.800 --> 03:08:17.080]  taught that believing in objective beauty so
[03:08:17.080 --> 03:08:20.600]  believing that a vista or landscape is beautiful and yeah you can have
[03:08:20.600 --> 03:08:23.640]  different tastes you can like like different styles of art
[03:08:23.640 --> 03:08:29.000]  but beauty is beauty okay you know an example i give in this video
[03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:33.560]  that's not beauty a turd stuffed in a toilet roll holder which is one of the
[03:08:33.560 --> 03:08:39.000]  examples that's not beauty like they had a 46 million dollar sale
[03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:42.520]  of this painting which wasn't much more extravagant than that one you're
[03:08:42.520 --> 03:08:45.400]  showing now which is basically a guy got a
[03:08:45.400 --> 03:08:49.640]  a brush stuck it on the end of a pole and did that what you see right there
[03:08:49.640 --> 03:08:53.000]  just a bunch of red splodges looks like a toddler's gone
[03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:59.240]  gone nuts with a bottle of ketchup or whatever 46 million dollars that sold
[03:08:59.240 --> 03:09:03.160]  for at the same auction that the 450 million dollar
[03:09:03.160 --> 03:09:07.720]  Leonardo da Vinci painting sold at and this is treated in the guardian
[03:09:07.720 --> 03:09:11.800]  they call this guy this artist who did this like the most intelligent and
[03:09:11.800 --> 03:09:16.520]  eloquent artist of our age and they say it they print it with a
[03:09:16.520 --> 03:09:19.640]  straight face well as you know paul
[03:09:19.640 --> 03:09:24.200]  it's discordium and it's about selling a fraud and having rich billionaires
[03:09:24.200 --> 03:09:27.320]  by worthless garbage while people starve to death everywhere
[03:09:27.320 --> 03:09:31.560]  this is their religion to assault the in the innate beauty we know in our
[03:09:31.560 --> 03:09:36.280]  connection with god they even write that's what they're doing as the cia
[03:09:36.280 --> 03:09:39.240]  as you know you've covered it declassified that ugly architecture ugly
[03:09:39.240 --> 03:09:43.320]  art was meant to sabotage our basic bearings
[03:09:43.320 --> 03:09:47.880]  so that we think we're insane because we love a beautiful sunset they go no
[03:09:47.880 --> 03:09:50.600]  we love raping a small child to death slaying their throat
[03:09:50.600 --> 03:09:54.200]  that's beautiful they're teaching us how objective it is
[03:09:54.200 --> 03:09:59.720]  we just need to tune into their satanism well it's it's pushing this nihilistic
[03:09:59.720 --> 03:10:03.320]  mindset that everything is meaningless that you can't achieve anything that
[03:10:03.320 --> 03:10:07.000]  you can't contribute anything to the legacy of human achievement
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:09.800]  which you know in art and you know you could pick it up pick it up from the
[03:10:09.800 --> 03:10:13.720]  renaissance 700 years ago now we've literally got
[03:10:13.720 --> 03:10:17.800]  this like some guy getting a brush and just moving it around and then charging
[03:10:17.800 --> 03:10:21.800]  for what it is is rembrandt no one can duplicate the way he picked up light
[03:10:21.800 --> 03:10:25.240]  with oil even today computers can't do it so there's no
[03:10:25.240 --> 03:10:28.440]  rembrandts so a bunch of people go well i'm doing a stick figure you're going to
[03:10:28.440 --> 03:10:30.920]  pay 10 million and i'm liberal i'm going to say it's the most
[03:10:30.920 --> 03:10:34.040]  beautiful thing so you're going to pay for it with taxpayer money to drive up
[03:10:34.040 --> 03:10:36.680]  the value i mean that's what it is it's losers getting
[03:10:36.680 --> 03:10:41.080]  together saying we're losers we're going to pull down true beauty
[03:10:41.080 --> 03:10:45.240]  no exactly and you know it's partly financial as well they buy this vastly
[03:10:45.240 --> 03:10:49.960]  inflated overpriced art to launder money they give it as charitable donations
[03:10:49.960 --> 03:10:54.440]  later on down the line to basically avoid tax it's a massive scam
[03:10:54.440 --> 03:10:58.200]  by a small collection of collectors and art galleries
[03:10:58.200 --> 03:11:02.120]  and they call it high culture so then when the young generation looks at this
[03:11:02.120 --> 03:11:04.360]  and says well they're they're saying that this
[03:11:04.360 --> 03:11:09.400]  like a urinal is high culture a turd stuffed in a toilet roll is high culture
[03:11:09.400 --> 03:11:12.680]  i want nothing no part of that i'm going to play video games i'm going to do
[03:11:12.680 --> 03:11:16.360]  whatever else so they make it deliberately impossible
[03:11:16.360 --> 03:11:22.920]  for anyone to break into it they lower the bar on high art to dynamite it
[03:11:22.920 --> 03:11:26.680]  exactly and so again it drags down the collective
[03:11:26.680 --> 03:11:30.360]  encouragement that society has that younger generations have to to get up
[03:11:30.360 --> 03:11:33.880]  and go and to be creative because there are modern artists that are supremely
[03:11:33.880 --> 03:11:36.520]  talented but none of them are going to get in any of
[03:11:36.520 --> 03:11:40.680]  these galleries because again like what we're seeing with the grammies today
[03:11:40.680 --> 03:11:44.680]  there's this pressure to have an overlay of social justice consciousness
[03:11:44.680 --> 03:11:48.840]  so even if your your art can be complete crap and sometimes it's literally
[03:11:48.840 --> 03:11:52.920]  trash but as long as you say that it's got some social message
[03:11:52.920 --> 03:11:57.160]  which oh just by coincidence pushes some far left deranged cliche
[03:11:57.160 --> 03:12:01.080]  then it's perfectly fine then you get in the art galleries and again this is the
[03:12:01.080 --> 03:12:04.520]  biblical story something ugly trying to pull down what's beautiful
[03:12:04.520 --> 03:12:09.160]  feminist baby shows the naked baby you know this has been put out as you know
[03:12:09.160 --> 03:12:13.080]  by disney and then it says i'm ugly i play with trash i don't do what my
[03:12:13.080 --> 03:12:15.800]  parents say you know i do all these bad things
[03:12:15.800 --> 03:12:20.360]  i do whatever i want they're teaching rebellion they're teaching failure
[03:12:20.360 --> 03:12:25.240]  they're teaching just pure garbage exactly and again they're trying to
[03:12:25.240 --> 03:12:29.000]  they're trying to present it as counterculture it's not counterculture
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:32.200]  when you control the entirety of the dominant culture
[03:12:32.200 --> 03:12:35.800]  whether it be hollywood whether it be the music industry whether it be art
[03:12:35.800 --> 03:12:39.400]  whether it be media right you're the dominant culture you can't be the
[03:12:39.400 --> 03:12:41.880]  dominant culture and the counterculture
[03:12:41.880 --> 03:12:45.720]  so they push all this transgender crap all this feminist baby crap
[03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:49.320]  it's like rebelling against your parents no you're conforming it's the
[03:12:49.320 --> 03:12:53.000]  ultimate act of conformity to go along with this deranged
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:57.720]  insanity that the dominant culture is poshing on a regular basis
[03:12:57.720 --> 03:13:02.360]  and now it's it's even backfiring on them like i've made videos where i
[03:13:02.360 --> 03:13:05.720]  break down the fact that the more hollywood gets into this social
[03:13:05.720 --> 03:13:09.400]  justice this diversity obsession the more their ticket
[03:13:09.400 --> 03:13:12.920]  prices their sales crater i mean they just had the worst
[03:13:12.920 --> 03:13:16.040]  hollywood just like the nfl just like all of it
[03:13:16.040 --> 03:13:19.720]  paul you're taking over after the break uh but just showing people the article
[03:13:19.720 --> 03:13:23.640]  on info wars dot com uh that has the uh video in it
[03:13:23.640 --> 03:13:29.560]  with millie weaver breaking it all down uh you look at this
[03:13:29.560 --> 03:13:34.840]  and it's titled uh new disney book targets babies for sexualization
[03:13:34.840 --> 03:13:39.320]  and gender confusion feminist baby children's book sexualizes infants
[03:13:39.320 --> 03:13:43.880]  scroll up a little bit or scroll down you can see we blurred the naked baby
[03:13:43.880 --> 03:13:48.680]  because the way they show this with the baby's butt sticking out in your face
[03:13:48.680 --> 03:13:51.960]  saying i do what i want i wear no pants then you learn i'm a rock star i'm
[03:13:51.960 --> 03:13:55.400]  sexualized you know and then the same artist says daddy
[03:13:55.400 --> 03:13:58.040]  saying she's pretty as bad i'm not pretty
[03:13:58.040 --> 03:14:02.200]  the girls can't be pretty i mean this is just mental illness

[03:22:15.240 --> 03:22:19.800]  under constant attack let's get into the elizabeth warren
[03:22:19.800 --> 03:22:22.440]  situation of course this broke yesterday with trump
[03:22:22.440 --> 03:22:27.240]  again for probably about the 200th time referring to her as pocahontas
[03:22:27.240 --> 03:22:32.840]  suddenly the media decided to get all offended over it and pick him up on it
[03:22:32.840 --> 03:22:36.600]  even though the media itself the mainstream media has reported for
[03:22:36.600 --> 03:22:42.280]  years now that senator elizabeth warren's supposed native american heritage
[03:22:42.280 --> 03:22:46.200]  is probably a load of bunk oh but suddenly it's so credible it's so
[03:22:46.200 --> 03:22:49.560]  believable because we can attack trump using this
[03:22:49.560 --> 03:22:53.560]  i want to flash back to an article put out by cnn
[03:22:53.560 --> 03:22:57.240]  i think this was last year actually during the election cycle
[03:22:57.240 --> 03:23:02.040]  entitled here's the deal with elizabeth warren's native american heritage
[03:23:02.040 --> 03:23:06.360]  and even they admit maybe but doubtfully
[03:23:06.360 --> 03:23:12.920]  maybe she might be 132 native american one part out of 32 native american
[03:23:12.920 --> 03:23:16.920]  they cite the washington post their fact checker
[03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:22.360]  which decided against judging the issue also even the washington post and cnn
[03:23:22.360 --> 03:23:28.040]  aren't prepared to commit to saying that elizabeth warren has any native american
[03:23:28.040 --> 03:23:31.480]  heritage at all oh but now trump's the racist and it's
[03:23:31.480 --> 03:23:34.600]  a racial slur even though it's a racial slur
[03:23:34.600 --> 03:23:38.440]  aimed at a white woman with blonde hair and blue eyes
[03:23:38.440 --> 03:23:44.120]  how completely ridiculous is that when they themselves report as recently as
[03:23:44.120 --> 03:23:47.480]  last year that she had it was doubtful she had
[03:23:47.480 --> 03:23:51.080]  any native american heritage oh but we can get offended about it
[03:23:51.080 --> 03:23:54.760]  so we're going to treat it as if it's the height of credibility
[03:23:54.760 --> 03:23:58.520]  now we have an article out of daily call an avajo co-talker breaks silence
[03:23:58.520 --> 03:24:02.440]  destroys fake indian elizabeth warren with epic wall liner
[03:24:02.440 --> 03:24:06.440]  actually in the gateway pundit now he was asked he was one of the
[03:24:06.440 --> 03:24:09.800]  native americans an actual native american who was at the ceremony with
[03:24:09.800 --> 03:24:13.000]  trump he was asked about the pocahontas comment he
[03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:17.400]  said quote the marines made us yell geronimo when we jumped out of
[03:24:17.400 --> 03:24:22.600]  planes and that didn't offend me either so he doesn't care about it
[03:24:22.600 --> 03:24:26.680]  once again it's the deranged trump derangement syndrome obsessed left
[03:24:26.680 --> 03:24:29.400]  getting offended on behalf of other people
[03:24:29.400 --> 03:24:33.000]  when those people themselves don't really give a damn
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:37.560]  now before donald trump even used the racist slur which isn't a racist slur
[03:24:37.560 --> 03:24:42.440]  because she's a white woman pocahontas phil mar did it without
[03:24:42.440 --> 03:24:45.720]  elizabeth warren objecting this is out of bright bar
[03:24:45.720 --> 03:24:48.920]  elizabeth warren responded to the president's pocahontas pope by calling
[03:24:48.920 --> 03:24:52.120]  it racist and sending out a fundraising appeal
[03:24:52.120 --> 03:24:54.920]  pleading with donors to strike back at a bully
[03:24:54.920 --> 03:24:58.440]  so she immediately used it to make money obviously
[03:24:58.440 --> 03:25:01.640]  but when talk show host bill mar made the same quip
[03:25:01.640 --> 03:25:06.760]  the massachusetts senator merely made a point about the popularity progressivism
[03:25:06.760 --> 03:25:12.680]  so bill mar said to elizabeth warren i think this was last year again
[03:25:12.680 --> 03:25:16.680]  quote they don't like you pocahontas earlier this year in fact and the
[03:25:16.680 --> 03:25:20.840]  liberal audience laughed hysterically and warren neither
[03:25:20.840 --> 03:25:24.440]  lectured the laughter's nor scolded the joker she did not respond with a
[03:25:24.440 --> 03:25:29.240]  fundraising letter or denounced mar's racist speech on national television
[03:25:29.240 --> 03:25:33.720]  and she simply had no reaction whatsoever so bill mar can say it
[03:25:33.720 --> 03:25:38.360]  it's not racist nobody cares nobody gets offended
[03:25:38.360 --> 03:25:42.520]  now we have this it gets even worse for elizabeth warren headline
[03:25:42.520 --> 03:25:46.760]  elizabeth warren ancestor rounded up native americans during horrific
[03:25:46.760 --> 03:25:51.880]  trail of tears so now it appears that her ancestors actually
[03:25:51.880 --> 03:25:56.200]  conspired in the oppression of native americans
[03:25:56.200 --> 03:26:00.360]  not only is senator elizabeth warren lying about a native american heritage
[03:26:00.360 --> 03:26:02.920]  but it turns out one of the lawmakers ancestors rounded up
[03:26:02.920 --> 03:26:07.160]  cherries during the trail of tears according to warren her native american
[03:26:07.160 --> 03:26:11.160]  heritage comes from an oklahoma territory marriage license application
[03:26:11.160 --> 03:26:15.000]  from 1894 by her alleged great great-granduncle william drake
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:19.320]  crawford from here warren says her native american heritage comes from that
[03:26:19.320 --> 03:26:22.840]  william j crawford's mother o.c. sarah smith crawford
[03:26:22.840 --> 03:26:28.200]  again nobody can even confirm that they're saying possibly 132 native american
[03:26:28.200 --> 03:26:33.480]  but can't confirm it well breitbart news reports today
[03:26:33.480 --> 03:26:36.520]  in an article that no evidence supports that claim and the o.c.
[03:26:36.520 --> 03:26:39.640]  sarah smith crawford had no cherry oki heritage
[03:26:39.640 --> 03:26:44.040]  she was listed as white in the census of 1860
[03:26:44.040 --> 03:26:47.560]  was most likely half swedish and half english
[03:26:47.560 --> 03:26:52.600]  yeah i'm probably more native american than elizabeth warren at this point
[03:26:52.600 --> 03:26:55.880]  she was also scottish german or some combination thereof
[03:26:55.880 --> 03:26:59.800]  so she was european white european but the most
[03:26:59.800 --> 03:27:04.040]  stunning discovery about the life of o.c. sarah smith crawford
[03:27:04.040 --> 03:27:08.520]  is that her husband mrs warren's great great grandfather was apparently a
[03:27:08.520 --> 03:27:11.320]  member of the tennessee militia who rounded up cherry
[03:27:11.320 --> 03:27:14.920]  cherry oki's from their family homes in southeast in united states
[03:27:14.920 --> 03:27:17.720]  and herded them into government-built stockades
[03:27:17.720 --> 03:27:22.040]  in what was then called ross's landing now chattanooga tennessee
[03:27:22.040 --> 03:27:25.080]  the point of origin for the horrific trail of tears
[03:27:25.080 --> 03:27:30.120]  which began in january 1837 so it turns out
[03:27:30.120 --> 03:27:33.720]  her ancestors were actually involved in the roundup
[03:27:33.720 --> 03:27:38.440]  of native americans there's no evidence whatsoever this person she points to is
[03:27:38.440 --> 03:27:41.720]  evidence of her native american ancestry
[03:27:41.720 --> 03:27:47.560]  was native american at all she was european swedish english scottish german
[03:27:47.560 --> 03:27:50.760]  that's not native american she's white she has blue eyes
[03:27:50.760 --> 03:27:54.760]  she's about as native american as rachel dolezal
[03:27:54.760 --> 03:27:59.240]  is african-american which is none whatsoever
[03:27:59.240 --> 03:28:03.800]  but again this is something we can get offended about you saw the faces
[03:28:03.800 --> 03:28:07.720]  of those reporters in the white house press briefing room yesterday
[03:28:07.720 --> 03:28:12.120]  grilling the press secretary sanders about this
[03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:16.760]  subject they were all head up with righteous indignation over this racial
[03:28:16.760 --> 03:28:21.880]  slur launched against an innocent victim a native american no
[03:28:21.880 --> 03:28:25.720]  no that nobody can even confirm it cnn
[03:28:25.720 --> 03:28:31.080]  washington post they both investigated it no native american heritage was found
[03:28:31.080 --> 03:28:34.200]  they don't they didn't go on record to even claim it by
[03:28:34.200 --> 03:28:38.280]  so of course she used it in the heart of law school application
[03:28:38.280 --> 03:28:42.360]  to try and give her an advantage over everybody else by claiming to be a
[03:28:42.360 --> 03:28:44.680]  minority it's a complete scam yet they're trying to
[03:28:44.680 --> 03:28:47.320]  recycle it again it's not going to work we'll be back on the

[03:33:30.680 --> 03:33:34.040]  what you probably didn't see is the sale of another painting
[03:33:34.040 --> 03:33:39.160]  for about 46 million dollars and for the benefit of radio viewers
[03:33:39.160 --> 03:33:43.480]  listeners this video that we're about to play shows this artist painting if you
[03:33:43.480 --> 03:33:46.520]  want to call it that looks like a toddler's gone mad with a bottle of
[03:33:46.520 --> 03:33:49.480]  ketchup okay it's your typical modern art meaningless
[03:33:49.480 --> 03:33:54.040]  dross that takes absolutely no talent this video breaks it down the true
[03:33:54.040 --> 03:33:57.400]  agenda behind modern art this is latest atrocities
[03:33:57.400 --> 03:34:00.440]  in modern art here's the video
[03:34:00.440 --> 03:34:04.840]  davinci painting just sold for 450 million dollars but what you may have
[03:34:04.840 --> 03:34:07.400]  missed at the same auction was the sale of this
[03:34:07.400 --> 03:34:10.600]  monstrosity how much do you reckon did somebody buy it for 20
[03:34:10.600 --> 03:34:15.800]  dollars for a laugh no 46 million dollars 46 million dollars for
[03:34:15.800 --> 03:34:18.760]  something that resembles what would probably happen if a two-year-old
[03:34:18.760 --> 03:34:22.760]  toddler was left on its own with a bottle of ketchup listen to the absolute
[03:34:22.760 --> 03:34:26.440]  tripe they spout to describe it red is the color of wine but also a blood and
[03:34:26.440 --> 03:34:28.920]  these canvases encompass both essential pleasure and violent debauchery
[03:34:28.920 --> 03:34:31.560]  associated with the god this contrast is echoed in the paintings combination of
[03:34:31.560 --> 03:34:34.760]  euphoric loops saw at once and the million flags of paint that ooze and
[03:34:34.760 --> 03:34:37.800]  cascade down the canvas the unfurling gestures of these paintings were made
[03:34:37.800 --> 03:34:40.520]  like Henry Matisse's works in old age with a brush affixed to the end of a
[03:34:40.520 --> 03:34:42.920]  pole which lends them their vitality and scale
[03:34:42.920 --> 03:34:47.400]  what a load of bollocks that gibberish is another example of obscurantism a
[03:34:47.400 --> 03:34:50.520]  rhetorical device modern art snobs use to disguise the
[03:34:50.520 --> 03:34:53.560]  fact that their art is completely meaningless
[03:34:53.560 --> 03:34:57.400]  it's just a fancy way of confusing people so their initial discernment is
[03:34:57.400 --> 03:35:00.840]  temporarily suspended making them afraid of criticizing
[03:35:00.840 --> 03:35:05.320]  such art for fear of appearing uncultured or ignorant in reality their
[03:35:05.320 --> 03:35:09.320]  first instinct is totally correct a vast majority of modern art
[03:35:09.320 --> 03:35:13.240]  is talentless trash sometimes it's literally trash and the
[03:35:13.240 --> 03:35:17.880]  entire industry is a price-fixing scam where galleries and auction houses in
[03:35:17.880 --> 03:35:21.160]  coordination with elitist collectors keep values
[03:35:21.160 --> 03:35:25.720]  grossly inflated collectors also gift crappy inflated modern art as a
[03:35:25.720 --> 03:35:30.040]  charitable donation so they can avoid paying tax others buy
[03:35:30.040 --> 03:35:33.480]  modern art simply as a way to launder money it took Da Vinci
[03:35:33.480 --> 03:35:37.320]  three years to paint the last supper the bloke who did this just stuck a brush
[03:35:37.320 --> 03:35:41.480]  to a pole dipped it in paint went like that a few times and hey presto that'll
[03:35:41.480 --> 03:35:45.000]  be 46 million dollars please he spent just as much time
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:49.000]  thinking up her name for it and after i'm sure what was an intense period of
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:51.720]  internal debate he eventually settled on
[03:35:51.720 --> 03:35:56.440]  untitled oh but wait it's part of a series because it really looks like a lot
[03:35:56.440 --> 03:35:59.400]  of forethought went into the other one given that it looks
[03:35:59.400 --> 03:36:03.560]  almost identical the guardian called the artist Sai Twombly
[03:36:03.560 --> 03:36:07.640]  quote the most intelligent and emotionally eloquent artist of our age
[03:36:07.640 --> 03:36:11.720]  yeah our age is sh** isn't it here's another spectacular work from
[03:36:11.720 --> 03:36:15.400]  the most intelligent and emotionally eloquent artist of our age what
[03:36:15.400 --> 03:36:20.120]  endless list of titles did Twombly agonize over before naming this one
[03:36:20.120 --> 03:36:25.480]  oh it's called untitled again i call it testing a biro pen what makes this all
[03:36:25.480 --> 03:36:29.640]  the more ironic is that twombly was obsessed with Leonardo da Vinci which is
[03:36:29.640 --> 03:36:33.640]  like the schlub who designed this being obsessed with his embad
[03:36:33.640 --> 03:36:37.160]  kingdom brunel the age of trump derangement syndrome has only
[03:36:37.160 --> 03:36:40.920]  intensified the belief that anything can be considered art if it serves to
[03:36:40.920 --> 03:36:45.160]  amplify some demented far left political cliche the carpet
[03:36:45.160 --> 03:36:53.000]  if you look very closely you see you see it's made up of thousands and thousands
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:36:59.240]  of african babies oh it's like he's literally walking on on african baby
[03:36:59.240 --> 03:37:04.440]  yes and like so he's like the west and the african babies are like africa
[03:37:04.440 --> 03:37:08.040]  that's a very good interpretation remember the black lives matter supporting
[03:37:08.040 --> 03:37:13.000]  performance artist who twerked a giant fat ass once for every time an african
[03:37:13.000 --> 03:37:16.760]  american was killed by a cop yeah that was my favorite now a transgender
[03:37:16.760 --> 03:37:21.000]  artist has collected 200 gallons of urine to protest trump
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:26.360]  yeah stop piling piss isn't art it's a mental illness this artist embarked on a
[03:37:26.360 --> 03:37:29.240]  quote observation of zeitgeist through the so-called
[03:37:29.240 --> 03:37:33.640]  thanato political dimension of contemporary biopolitical practices
[03:37:33.640 --> 03:37:37.000]  what actually happened is that she breastfed her own dogs which is closer
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:41.640]  to animal abuse than it is art but who am i to judge this genius didn't even
[03:37:41.640 --> 03:37:45.000]  bother slapping a few splodges of paint on a canvas and instead just
[03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:48.680]  literally wrote the words please imagine a boring abstract painting but why
[03:37:48.680 --> 03:37:52.600]  even bother writing anything when you can just glue cardboard boxes to the wall
[03:37:52.600 --> 03:37:56.360]  having already blown half a million dollars on a blue ring
[03:37:56.360 --> 03:38:01.000]  calgary wasn't finished yet artists always say their aim is to move people
[03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:05.800]  with their work well a massive new sculpture in calgary is definitely
[03:38:05.800 --> 03:38:10.920]  moving a lot of people there into writing hate mail just off the trans canada
[03:38:10.920 --> 03:38:13.640]  highway stands calgary's latest public art
[03:38:13.640 --> 03:38:18.600]  installation both work towers the project cost half a million dollars
[03:38:18.600 --> 03:38:22.920]  the museum of modern art in new york mohmer remains as cancerous as ever
[03:38:22.920 --> 03:38:27.880]  this piece of art celebrates quote downtown counterculture exactly what's
[03:38:27.880 --> 03:38:32.040]  artistic or counterculture about some pouting soy boy flouncing
[03:38:32.040 --> 03:38:34.920]  around in front of a camera your guess is as good as mine
[03:38:34.920 --> 03:38:38.040]  it's like even like the reductive nature of this like his color scheme is so
[03:38:38.040 --> 03:38:41.000]  fascinating yeah his color scheme is so fascinating he's
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:44.440]  literally used one color respondents to the twitter
[03:38:44.440 --> 03:38:48.200]  thread reacted with their own pieces all of which were actually more intricate
[03:38:48.200 --> 03:38:51.560]  than the dross hanging in the gallery share photos on instagram showing how
[03:38:51.560 --> 03:38:54.280]  you interpret the hijab as part of a modern wardrobe
[03:38:54.280 --> 03:38:58.200]  yeah the hijab is so modern that women all over the middle east who refuse to
[03:38:58.200 --> 03:39:02.120]  wear it or simply let it slip or subjected to abuse beatings imprisonment
[03:39:02.120 --> 03:39:06.200]  and death so modern so progressive next up at
[03:39:06.200 --> 03:39:10.120]  mohmer share photos showing how you interpret the chastity bell as part of
[03:39:10.120 --> 03:39:13.320]  a modern wardrobe but given how insufferably boring and
[03:39:13.320 --> 03:39:17.240]  pointless their exhibitions are it was thoughtful of mohmer to provide this
[03:39:17.240 --> 03:39:20.520]  jigsaw puzzle for visitors oh no that's a piece of art too
[03:39:20.520 --> 03:39:25.640]  no an unfinished jigsaw puzzle is not art it's an unfinished jigsaw puzzle if
[03:39:25.640 --> 03:39:29.000]  people say it's art it's art um i think that's
[03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:31.640]  absolutely rubbish so you could say anything is art
[03:39:31.640 --> 03:39:37.080]  you just could say everything is art but the point is that is my shoe art
[03:39:37.080 --> 03:39:40.360]  if people say it is i have to then judge it on those terms i think that's a
[03:39:40.360 --> 03:39:44.200]  totally ridiculous argument well i never heard anything more ludicrous in my
[03:39:44.200 --> 03:39:47.560]  life when it's sort of a replica sports shirts they're not art
[03:39:47.560 --> 03:39:51.160]  they're replica sports shirts just because you move them to a different
[03:39:51.160 --> 03:39:54.760]  location and devoted a poncy pretentious monologue to them doesn't
[03:39:54.760 --> 03:39:58.200]  suddenly make them art they're still replica sports shirts just
[03:39:58.200 --> 03:40:01.400]  like sticking a piece of plastic s*** through a toilet roll holder
[03:40:01.400 --> 03:40:04.520]  doesn't change the fact that it's just a piece of plastic s*** up through a
[03:40:04.520 --> 03:40:07.640]  toilet roll holder art that has to be in a gallery to
[03:40:07.640 --> 03:40:11.160]  be art isn't art some kids left a pineapple in the
[03:40:11.160 --> 03:40:14.440]  middle of an exhibition and people mistook it for art thinking that
[03:40:14.440 --> 03:40:18.600]  everything is subjective that there are no objective standards of beauty and
[03:40:18.600 --> 03:40:23.240]  that anything can be considered art isn't a refined opinion it's
[03:40:23.240 --> 03:40:27.240]  dumb if you think that you're not sophisticated you're a clown
[03:40:27.240 --> 03:40:30.200]  students are now being taught that believing in objective standards of
[03:40:30.200 --> 03:40:33.960]  beauty and art is cultural fascism beauty has fallen into
[03:40:33.960 --> 03:40:38.440]  disrepute for some reason people have
[03:40:38.440 --> 03:40:42.280]  marginalized the pursuit of beauty there's been a huge cultural
[03:40:42.280 --> 03:40:46.520]  shift an almost deliberate attempt to expel
[03:40:46.520 --> 03:40:50.360]  beauty from the place in human life that it naturally occupies
[03:40:50.360 --> 03:40:53.080]  which is the center the message that art has been
[03:40:53.080 --> 03:40:57.080]  perpetrating for the last 50 or even 100 years
[03:40:57.080 --> 03:41:01.160]  that in the end that our aspirations to be something better
[03:41:01.160 --> 03:41:06.040]  are all self-deception and delusion of course there is natural beauty and
[03:41:06.040 --> 03:41:08.680]  there's the beauty of the human face and the human form
[03:41:08.680 --> 03:41:13.320]  there's the beauty of animals and the beauty of landscape
[03:41:13.320 --> 03:41:19.480]  everybody is aware of that it stands there as an independent witness to the
[03:41:19.480 --> 03:41:23.880]  meaning of the universe what kind of damage is all this doing to the fabric
[03:41:23.880 --> 03:41:27.880]  of western civilization 700 years after the start of the
[03:41:27.880 --> 03:41:32.600]  renaissance and this is where we've arrived if this is what we call high
[03:41:32.600 --> 03:41:36.360]  culture an endless parade of meaningless debris that promises
[03:41:36.360 --> 03:41:40.760]  nothing and delivers nothing what does this say about our society
[03:41:40.760 --> 03:41:44.760]  what does this say about our contribution to the grand tapestry of
[03:41:44.760 --> 03:41:48.680]  mankind's collective achievement what does this say about how we've let
[03:41:48.680 --> 03:41:53.320]  these culture vultures tarnish and defile the legacy of beauty
[03:41:53.320 --> 03:41:56.440]  handed down by our ancestors we mustn't be afraid to
[03:41:56.440 --> 03:42:00.920]  loudly proclaim the emperor has no clothes we mustn't be afraid to call
[03:42:00.920 --> 03:42:05.320]  out abstract modern art for precisely what it is a wretched ugly
[03:42:05.320 --> 03:42:09.080]  manifestation of post-modernism an insult to our heritage
[03:42:09.080 --> 03:42:14.360]  a desecration of our human potential
[03:42:15.640 --> 03:42:19.800]  there you have it latest atrocities in modern art
[03:42:19.800 --> 03:42:25.240]  video is up on pause.com right now and again we see the same process in

[03:44:24.200 --> 03:44:27.880]  is tolerant modern liberalism is a counterfeit
[03:44:27.880 --> 03:44:32.680]  of thomas geverson's classical liberalism they are the anti-liberal

[03:45:01.160 --> 03:45:05.720]  of giant time bomb with populations and globalism
[03:45:05.720 --> 03:45:09.160]  and the new world order's manipulation of people's minds
[03:45:09.160 --> 03:45:13.240]  things are getting crazy we're trying to fix the country and fix the planet
[03:45:13.240 --> 03:45:16.520]  we've also got to have rearguard actions to be prepared

[03:45:59.320 --> 03:46:03.560]  pretty much scares me the most i mean i try to make sure that i
[03:46:03.560 --> 03:46:07.400]  don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but
[03:46:07.400 --> 03:46:11.560]  right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything

[03:47:22.520 --> 03:47:27.000]  well the grammy nominations came out today and the left is all over twitter
[03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:32.120]  celebrating the fact that very few white performers or artists were
[03:47:32.120 --> 03:47:36.760]  nominated for grammy's in fact i posted a tweet about an hour ago
[03:47:36.760 --> 03:47:41.720]  from a huffington post actually it was retweeted by the huffington post so a
[03:47:41.720 --> 03:47:46.280]  kind of semi endorsement from another verified liberal on twitter called
[03:47:46.280 --> 03:47:50.520]  jenna amatully who celebrate the fact that quote no white men were
[03:47:50.520 --> 03:47:53.640]  nominated uh for the album top album awards at the
[03:47:53.640 --> 03:47:58.280]  grammy's with the words white men are cancelled
[03:47:58.280 --> 03:48:01.960]  she's actually happy that there are no white men up for receiving a big
[03:48:01.960 --> 03:48:04.920]  grammy award this year which of course ties in with this
[03:48:04.920 --> 03:48:07.800]  article which is up on drudgereport.com
[03:48:07.800 --> 03:48:12.840]  grammy awards shocker for cbs's top pop stars ed sheer and lady auger snubbed
[03:48:12.840 --> 03:48:17.640]  no country acts in main categories now before the break i was talking about
[03:48:17.640 --> 03:48:21.480]  how everything is being politicized with the nfl
[03:48:21.480 --> 03:48:25.960]  and the take a knee controversy of course that's harmed them massively
[03:48:25.960 --> 03:48:29.880]  viewership is down espn espn is collapsing
[03:48:29.880 --> 03:48:33.640]  people just aren't turning up for the games because they don't want politics
[03:48:33.640 --> 03:48:37.720]  injected into absolutely everything they're sick of it
[03:48:37.720 --> 03:48:41.480]  in fact there was a big poll a few weeks ago that showed the vast majority of
[03:48:41.480 --> 03:48:45.560]  americans don't want politics injected into their sports
[03:48:45.560 --> 03:48:49.400]  that's the one time they want to get away from it they go to a movie theater
[03:48:49.400 --> 03:48:52.200]  they want to get away from it because it's just constant
[03:48:52.200 --> 03:48:57.160]  incetin everything politicized everything divisive
[03:48:57.160 --> 03:49:01.240]  they're sick to the back teeth of it but as i said with the modern art
[03:49:01.240 --> 03:49:04.920]  again you have this crappy modern art that gets put in galleries
[03:49:04.920 --> 03:49:09.240]  simply because the artist claims it has some social message to send
[03:49:09.240 --> 03:49:14.280]  even if it's literally you know an unmade bed or a few splodges of pain
[03:49:14.280 --> 03:49:18.200]  or in some cases absolutely nothing just a white canvas on a wall
[03:49:18.200 --> 03:49:22.680]  as long as they claim it has some some social justice message to communicate
[03:49:22.680 --> 03:49:26.120]  then it gets in there and now we're seeing it with the grammy's
[03:49:26.120 --> 03:49:30.760]  taylor swift of course has been attacked by cosmopolitan magazine and others
[03:49:30.760 --> 03:49:33.960]  over the past few weeks because she hasn't contracted
[03:49:33.960 --> 03:49:37.080]  trump derangement syndrome yeah taylor swift had the
[03:49:37.080 --> 03:49:41.000]  temerity to not inject herself into this partisan
[03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:44.200]  political bickering over the past 12 15 months
[03:49:44.200 --> 03:49:48.120]  so now she's being attacked for not saying anything
[03:49:48.120 --> 03:49:51.720]  like she may say something that might offend a bunch of people but no not
[03:49:51.720 --> 03:49:54.680]  even that she's not said anything about donald
[03:49:54.680 --> 03:49:57.480]  trump anything about the presidential election
[03:49:57.480 --> 03:50:02.360]  so now she's being attacked and lo and behold this article explains it
[03:50:02.360 --> 03:50:06.120]  taylor swift will not perform at the grammy's she'll not be performing her
[03:50:06.120 --> 03:50:08.600]  song look what you made me do
[03:50:08.600 --> 03:50:13.080]  milie syris won't be singing malibu there are no country music acts performing
[03:50:13.080 --> 03:50:17.800]  at the grammy's basically white people have been expunged from the awards to
[03:50:17.800 --> 03:50:21.640]  a large degree in the nominations at least and you know
[03:50:21.640 --> 03:50:25.480]  doesn't even matter this is supposed to be a meritocracy it shouldn't even be an
[03:50:25.480 --> 03:50:28.360]  issue but the left is all over twitter
[03:50:28.360 --> 03:50:32.280]  celebrating the fact that basically hardly any white people have been
[03:50:32.280 --> 03:50:36.600]  nominated for grammy's and in this article they point out
[03:50:36.600 --> 03:50:41.320]  the mere act of not having a country music act performing or nominated
[03:50:41.320 --> 03:50:44.040]  is going to crush them when it comes to viewership
[03:50:44.040 --> 03:50:47.320]  we've seen the same process again with the nfl with hollywood
[03:50:47.320 --> 03:50:51.400]  hollywood just had its worst summer season in years and years their income is
[03:50:51.400 --> 03:50:54.840]  plummeting and it's partly to do with the fact
[03:50:54.840 --> 03:50:58.520]  that all this politicization all this social justice all this diversity
[03:50:58.520 --> 03:51:01.400]  obsession is being injected into movies
[03:51:01.400 --> 03:51:05.160]  at the expense of plot at the expense of character development
[03:51:05.160 --> 03:51:09.000]  everything's just a recycling of superhero franchises
[03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:13.240]  people are getting sick of it nobody's got any new ideas nobody's prepared
[03:51:13.240 --> 03:51:17.000]  to take risks because again they're being judged on
[03:51:17.000 --> 03:51:21.240]  oh how many non-white characters are in the lead how much diversity is in your
[03:51:21.240 --> 03:51:26.040]  movie not if it's a good movie like who cares
[03:51:26.040 --> 03:51:29.000]  but now it's in the grammy's and now they're saying that taylor swift won't
[03:51:29.000 --> 03:51:32.120]  perform there are no country music acts performing
[03:51:32.120 --> 03:51:36.760]  and you know god forbid taylor swift would remain silent on politics
[03:51:36.760 --> 03:51:41.080]  because she's the authority right we must hear from taylor swift
[03:51:41.080 --> 03:51:45.000]  about the presidential transition and the trump administration's
[03:51:45.000 --> 03:51:49.240]  legislative agenda if what what are we gonna do if you don't hear from the
[03:51:49.240 --> 03:51:53.480]  noted expert taylor swift on any of that
[03:51:53.480 --> 03:51:56.680]  in fact it's become quite a funny meme over the past couple of weeks which i've
[03:51:56.680 --> 03:52:02.040]  joined in on which people accusing taylor swift of
[03:52:02.040 --> 03:52:05.400]  being involved in a deafening silence over everything from
[03:52:05.400 --> 03:52:09.160]  you know the the fall of the macabre regime in zimbabwe
[03:52:09.160 --> 03:52:13.240]  to the threat that the development of artificial intelligence poses to the
[03:52:13.240 --> 03:52:18.200]  survival of humanity how dare taylor swift not comment
[03:52:18.200 --> 03:52:23.240]  on any of that her silence is deafening and she's complicit
[03:52:23.240 --> 03:52:26.440]  now she's being punished by the looks of it by the grammy's
[03:52:26.440 --> 03:52:30.040]  she won't perform her single this again is an outgrowth
[03:52:30.040 --> 03:52:35.240]  of this incessant obsession with injecting politics into everything
[03:52:35.240 --> 03:52:38.440]  you remember last year at the grammy's there was a huge pressure
[03:52:38.440 --> 03:52:42.120]  for every winner of an award who got up and gave a speech
[03:52:42.120 --> 03:52:46.440]  to say something about donald trump because it was in february it was right
[03:52:46.440 --> 03:52:49.800]  after the inauguration it was right when the whole muslim ban was going into
[03:52:49.800 --> 03:52:52.680]  effect they were under pressure to say something the
[03:52:52.680 --> 03:52:55.960]  ones who didn't were the ones who got highlighted
[03:52:55.960 --> 03:53:00.680]  that's the level of indoctrination and cult like witch hunt mob behavior
[03:53:00.680 --> 03:53:04.440]  amongst the left to the point where it's not even if you say something that
[03:53:04.440 --> 03:53:07.880]  offends them it's if you don't say anything at all
[03:53:07.880 --> 03:53:11.560]  if you don't join the cult amplify the mantra
[03:53:11.560 --> 03:53:15.640]  and that's the trap that taylor swift being caught in god forbid as a
[03:53:15.640 --> 03:53:19.640]  pop star she would just want to focus on making records and
[03:53:19.640 --> 03:53:23.160]  performing at concerts no no no you have to get on the bandwagon
[03:53:23.160 --> 03:53:27.000]  because we're intolerant we're hateful we will hunt you down
[03:53:27.000 --> 03:53:31.880]  that's the progressive left and now it's taking place again at the grammy's
[03:53:31.880 --> 03:53:36.600]  fox news reports and this is hilarious feminism site medusa magazine shuts
[03:53:36.600 --> 03:53:41.320]  down after founder admits it was pure satire what appeared to be a far
[03:53:41.320 --> 03:53:44.680]  left feminism magazine has shut down after its creator revealed that the
[03:53:44.680 --> 03:53:49.640]  entire project was a joke filled with over the top satire packaged as
[03:53:49.640 --> 03:53:54.600]  liberal talking points designed to mock legitimate feminist and their supporters
[03:53:54.600 --> 03:53:57.960]  so basically the owner the founder of this website
[03:53:57.960 --> 03:54:02.360]  came out and said look feminist social justice worries the far left are so
[03:54:02.360 --> 03:54:06.920]  deranged they're so over the top that our efforts to mock them
[03:54:06.920 --> 03:54:10.920]  by producing satirical articles which are way over the top
[03:54:10.920 --> 03:54:15.480]  isn't working anymore it's not funny because we can't compete with them
[03:54:15.480 --> 03:54:19.160]  they're so demented they're so deranged we can't even think up
[03:54:19.160 --> 03:54:23.160]  think of anything that would be more ludicrous than what they're actually
[03:54:23.160 --> 03:54:25.880]  doing so now he's shutting down the website and it's
[03:54:25.880 --> 03:54:29.880]  interesting because a lot of news outlets actually fell for these articles
[03:54:29.880 --> 03:54:33.080]  thinking they were real gateway pundit
[03:54:33.080 --> 03:54:36.680]  russian news sources and others including info wars
[03:54:36.680 --> 03:54:41.160]  so mea culpa there this was so close to the bone this was so accurate to what
[03:54:41.160 --> 03:54:44.600]  feminists were actually doing that we fell for it we thought it was real
[03:54:44.600 --> 03:54:48.120]  now they're shutting down the website because of po's law
[03:54:48.120 --> 03:54:52.280]  which basically means that the satirical content is not
[03:54:52.280 --> 03:54:56.280]  far enough removed from the actual insanity that's taking place
[03:54:56.280 --> 03:55:00.280]  people can no longer tell the difference so now they're having to shut down the
[03:55:00.280 --> 03:55:05.560]  entire website absolutely hilarious bbc news reports
[03:55:05.560 --> 03:55:09.720]  teenager 17 guilty of plotting cardiff terror attack a teenager from south
[03:55:09.720 --> 03:55:13.640]  wales have been has been found guilty of plotting a terror attack in cardiff
[03:55:13.640 --> 03:55:19.560]  a 17 year old planned to bomb a justin beaver concert
[03:55:19.560 --> 03:55:23.800]  in the name of alla now this 17 year old kid was white
[03:55:23.800 --> 03:55:28.120]  and he was british so tell me again about how criticizing islam
[03:55:28.120 --> 03:55:31.960]  is racist now fact check islam is not a race
[03:55:31.960 --> 03:55:36.360]  you get white jihadists who plan terror attacks just the same as you get
[03:55:36.360 --> 03:55:40.360]  persian jihadists just the same as you get arab jihadist planning terror attacks
[03:55:40.360 --> 03:55:44.440]  islam's not a race and that's yet another example of it
[03:55:44.440 --> 03:55:48.840]  meanwhile also in the uk we have a massive problem here with islamic
[03:55:48.840 --> 03:55:51.560]  schools they're now going in and finding
[03:55:51.560 --> 03:55:55.960]  material let me pull up the article here this is out of rt
[03:55:55.960 --> 03:56:00.760]  where the actual material is teaching children in schools
[03:56:00.760 --> 03:56:04.680]  the headline is beating wives if they refuse sex is okay according to books
[03:56:04.680 --> 03:56:08.600]  in britain's islamic schools this is out of rt
[03:56:08.600 --> 03:56:12.440]  the books sanction domestic violence and say women should never refuse their
[03:56:12.440 --> 03:56:15.480]  husband sex are among a series of sexist materials that inspectors
[03:56:15.480 --> 03:56:20.040]  have found in britain's islamic schools so they contain quotes such as quote
[03:56:20.040 --> 03:56:22.920]  the wife is not allowed to refuse sex to her husband
[03:56:22.920 --> 03:56:27.640]  or leave the house where she lives without his permission
[03:56:27.640 --> 03:56:31.800]  this is being taught to boys and girls in british schools and in fact they go
[03:56:31.800 --> 03:56:35.720]  through it and they're replicating they were they're regurgitating in
[03:56:35.720 --> 03:56:38.920]  exams in essays what they read in these books
[03:56:38.920 --> 03:56:44.520]  so this is yet another example of how an actual misogynistic sexist anti-woman
[03:56:44.520 --> 03:56:47.400]  belief system is being allowed to penetrate at the
[03:56:47.400 --> 03:56:51.640]  very root of society what a feminist got to say about it
[03:56:51.640 --> 03:56:55.480]  absolutely nothing and it's happening in british schools right now
[03:56:55.480 --> 03:56:59.480]  kids being taught to treat women as second-class citizens but because it's
[03:56:59.480 --> 03:57:02.360]  in muslim schools oh we can't do anything about it
[03:57:02.360 --> 03:57:05.320]  because we have to be politically correct because we really care about
[03:57:05.320 --> 03:57:08.040]  women's rights but let's just ignore that okay
[03:57:08.040 --> 03:57:12.360]  time magazine says trump not as person of the year perhaps linda saw saw
[03:57:12.360 --> 03:57:16.680]  of course the woman who said to ayan hercialli the muslim reformist sex
[03:57:16.680 --> 03:57:20.200]  muslim reformist she could take her vagina away because she's progressive
[03:57:20.200 --> 03:57:23.320]  like that now it appears that time magazine
[03:57:23.320 --> 03:57:27.880]  may make linda saw saw the person of the year this is who they want to
[03:57:27.880 --> 03:57:31.800]  represent hijab and all the new america
[03:57:31.800 --> 03:57:34.760]  absolutely incredible she ought to take advantage of those
[03:57:34.760 --> 03:57:38.200]  passions and almost all the comments to wrap it up for the fourth hour
[03:57:38.200 --> 03:57:41.880]  war room is coming up next don't go away
[03:57:41.880 --> 03:57:45.400]  the term fake news has become so synonymous with cnn
[03:57:45.400 --> 03:57:50.040]  the news network wants to ban it cnn is now pushing an effort to ban the term
[03:57:50.040 --> 03:57:54.200]  fake news an opinion piece argues that the term has become meaningless
[03:57:54.200 --> 03:57:57.640]  and lost its power because politicians have hijacked it
[03:57:57.640 --> 03:58:01.400]  as a way to undermine the media establishment the authors decry the
[03:58:01.400 --> 03:58:05.160]  fact that a majority of people now believe the mainstream media pedals
[03:58:05.160 --> 03:58:09.640]  fabricated stories of course the real reason media elites want to clamp down
[03:58:09.640 --> 03:58:13.240]  on the term fake news is because its original intention
[03:58:13.240 --> 03:58:16.120]  to smear and discredit any dissenting opinions
[03:58:16.120 --> 03:58:20.200]  has completely backfired this was illustrated yet again by president
[03:58:20.200 --> 03:58:24.440]  trump's latest triggering tweet when he suggested that a fake news
[03:58:24.440 --> 03:58:28.440]  trophy should be awarded to the network that has been responsible for the most
[03:58:28.440 --> 03:58:32.840]  inaccurate reporting the fake news narrative is actually acted as a boomerang
[03:58:32.840 --> 03:58:37.000]  showing the mainstream media to be the most consistently dishonest entity of
