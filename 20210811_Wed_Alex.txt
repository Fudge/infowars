[00:00.000 --> 00:05.680]  clear message that is coming through this is becoming a pandemic of the
[00:05.680 --> 00:10.400]  unvaccinated scientific evidence experts say proves fully vaccinated
[00:10.400 --> 00:15.240]  people are protected in two ways. Essentially vaccines block you from
[00:15.240 --> 00:21.680]  getting and giving the virus. I want to be clear while vaccinated people can
[00:21.680 --> 00:25.580]  spread the virus if they get a breakthrough infection. The fact that
[00:25.580 --> 00:31.220]  vaccinated people who do have a breakthrough infection are clearly
[00:31.220 --> 00:36.620]  capable of transmitting the infection to an uninfected person. Why are the
[00:36.620 --> 00:40.100]  doctors not here in the brief room to take our questions? You know what,
[00:40.100 --> 00:44.740]  kill you. I would I would argue that we had the president of the United
[00:44.740 --> 00:49.500]  States speak to this yesterday. He gave a more than 30 minute speech about
[00:49.500 --> 00:55.300]  where we are as a country. I mean, he is a trusted voice. He's the leader of
[00:55.300 --> 00:59.820]  our country. No, but we heard from him, right? We heard from the president
[00:59.820 --> 01:03.980]  yesterday. We heard from the president about the Delta variant and vaccinations
[01:03.980 --> 01:09.420]  in general. We have roughly 350 million people vaccinated in the United
[01:09.420 --> 01:18.980]  States. I'm actually quite proud of the medical services from Europe, the
[01:18.980 --> 01:22.900]  United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, Latin America,
[01:22.900 --> 01:29.780]  Eastern Europe, Russia. The vast majority of the people speaking up who are
[01:29.780 --> 01:34.740]  doctors and scientists and epidemiologists and nurses are saying the
[01:34.740 --> 01:37.740]  vaccines don't work and are killing most people. And the statistics show
[01:37.740 --> 01:42.580]  that I'm a Mayo Clinic trained board certified pathologist board
[01:42.580 --> 01:46.060]  certified and anatomic and clinical pathology. So yes, I have expertise in
[01:46.060 --> 01:50.220]  immunology and virology. This is where we are right now. So does that look like
[01:50.220 --> 01:55.020]  a pandemic? It was. It's not anymore. We're in an endemic now. Statistically,
[01:55.020 --> 02:00.340]  the pandemic is over in Idaho. You statistically, once we're below a set
[02:00.340 --> 02:04.460]  percentage, we are not in a pandemic right now. Is the disease present? Sure,
[02:04.460 --> 02:09.100]  it is. Is it widespread? No. You know, we're still doing maybe 500 to 600
[02:09.100 --> 02:14.220]  patient tests a day. At most, we're seeing 2% per day right now. And so the
[02:14.220 --> 02:17.500]  numbers are going way down. There's numbers are still high in a few states,
[02:17.500 --> 02:21.940]  but we're getting past that point. And here's why. Coronavirus is are seasonal.
[02:21.940 --> 02:25.500]  They follow a six to nine month life cycle. And no matter what we do, they're
[02:25.500 --> 02:28.620]  going to do what they do. And then they're going to fade. What happened to
[02:28.620 --> 02:32.500]  SARS? What happened to Merz? What would what did we do to stop them? Nothing.
[02:32.700 --> 02:39.260]  They did their thing. Um, average COVID-19 death age 78.6 average age of
[02:39.260 --> 02:44.340]  death in North America every year 78.6. What are our highest risk factors?
[02:44.340 --> 02:51.100]  Obesity low vitamin D levels. Advanced age 90% of deaths in the state have
[02:51.100 --> 02:56.060]  been over 70 years of age. That's the risk population. We have stopped our
[02:56.060 --> 02:59.460]  society for something that's taking people that are already at that death
[02:59.460 --> 03:03.580]  risk age. Anyway, the virus is fragile. These are just little tidbits. It's
[03:03.580 --> 03:07.660]  fragile. It doesn't live outside. UV light fractionates. It kills it, blows
[03:07.660 --> 03:12.460]  it apart. Ventilation in the wind blows it away. It is insanity to wear a mask
[03:12.460 --> 03:19.220]  outside. It is absolute insanity. And that's and that's science. That's
[03:19.220 --> 03:23.260]  science. There is not one study that has shown any super spreader event to have
[03:23.260 --> 03:27.780]  occurred outside. They have all been indoors with poor ventilation. I just
[03:27.780 --> 03:31.000]  think that we're kidding ourselves. We think kids wearing mask helps. You're
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.020]  probably even makes it worse. You should also know that no vaccine, even the
[03:35.020 --> 03:40.060]  ones I support and would give to myself and my children ever stops infection
[03:40.060 --> 03:44.580]  in 2014. There was outbreak of mumps in the National Hockey League. The only
[03:44.580 --> 03:47.300]  people who came down the symptoms for the people who are unvaccinated or
[03:47.300 --> 03:51.020]  unknown vaccine status. Boy, that sounds like a great argument for vaccines. But
[03:51.020 --> 03:54.300]  a question that you should ask yourself knowing that half of the people who came
[03:54.300 --> 03:58.700]  down with symptomatic disease had no contact with an unvaccinated or
[03:58.700 --> 04:03.980]  unknown vaccine status individual. Where did they get the disease? And the
[04:03.980 --> 04:08.980]  answer was from the vaccinated individuals. No vaccine prevents you from
[04:08.980 --> 04:13.500]  getting infection. You get infected. You shed pathogen. This is especially true
[04:13.500 --> 04:17.940]  of viral respiratory pathogens. You just don't get symptomatic from it. So you
[04:17.940 --> 04:21.460]  cannot stop spread. You cannot make these numbers that you've planned on get
[04:21.460 --> 04:25.220]  better by doing any of the things you're doing because that is the nature of
[04:25.220 --> 04:29.100]  viral respiratory pathogens and you can't prevent it with a vaccine because
[04:29.100 --> 04:32.900]  they don't do the very thing you're wanting them to do. But just imagine you
[04:32.900 --> 04:36.380]  say, where are the scientists? Wouldn't they speak up? They all speak up and
[04:36.380 --> 04:42.860]  they get silenced or the head? Three scientists came up with the
[04:42.860 --> 04:47.340]  world government plan that we're now under. One of them is Paul Erlich and his
[04:47.340 --> 04:51.660]  organization, his society that wants the population, is saying don't worry about
[04:51.660 --> 04:57.140]  all those dead people. If you like what somebody said, there's been Nazi murders
[04:57.140 --> 05:01.460]  in Germany and they went, well Hitler says it's not happening. You've got amazing
[05:01.460 --> 05:05.620]  shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for dogs, beds for
[05:05.620 --> 05:08.860]  cats. All amazing products at already very low prices, hiring thousands of
[05:08.860 --> 05:12.460]  thousands of Americans with promo code Alex with MyPilla.com or
[05:12.460 --> 05:16.140]  Frankspeech.com or in New York sites, they get the very best discount. It's an
[05:16.140 --> 05:20.940]  amazing deal. You get my six pack of towels for $39.99, normally $199. You
[05:20.940 --> 05:25.940]  can get my Geese and Dream Sheets, normally $100 a set as low as $49.99 a
[05:25.940 --> 05:30.220]  set. I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support
[05:30.220 --> 05:35.340]  right now for what's going on. Myself, I need the cybersymposium. I just lost a
[05:35.340 --> 05:38.820]  million dollar week revenue by telling Fox, you know what, I'm not gonna succumb
[05:38.820 --> 05:42.380]  to your cancel culture. We're gonna bring the word out on our own. Your best
[05:42.380 --> 05:46.580]  special is using the promo code Alex and you're supporting us getting the word
[05:46.580 --> 05:52.700]  out with Alex's great show, Impelmorse and you're supporting MyPilla, 2,500
[05:52.700 --> 05:56.340]  employees and I haven't had to lay anybody off in spite of trying to be an
[05:56.340 --> 06:12.060]  attack beautiful. You're an example of resistance, Mike Lindell, Godspeed. Big
[06:12.060 --> 06:18.540]  brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[06:18.540 --> 06:27.380]  so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. First, I want
[06:27.380 --> 06:32.300]  to play the puppet in chief in a press conference yesterday saying he may
[06:32.300 --> 06:39.700]  announce nationwide mandates for masks and yes, lockdowns of non-essential
[06:39.700 --> 06:43.060]  businesses. Now that they've had the speech ready for weeks, they were talking
[06:43.060 --> 06:49.340]  about this day, August 11th being when it would happen. When I brought that up
[06:49.340 --> 06:53.740]  last week, I said, us bringing it up may make them move the date or they may
[06:53.740 --> 06:58.020]  change it on their own accord. But I stand by my sources and Jack the subject
[06:58.020 --> 07:02.620]  sources that they were looking at today as the day to announce new nationwide
[07:02.620 --> 07:06.900]  mandates. And last night, Biden said he's looking at the law, which he always
[07:06.900 --> 07:10.700]  says before he does it when he violates the law and that would violate
[07:10.700 --> 07:15.980]  federalism, it would violate the different areas of the Constitution that
[07:15.980 --> 07:19.620]  separate the states from the federal government. And so it's quite the
[07:19.620 --> 07:24.540]  draconian mandate. But he's definitely lined up and ready to do it, which will
[07:24.540 --> 07:28.060]  again fulfill another one of our predictions as accurate. I would love to
[07:28.060 --> 07:32.940]  be proven wrong by putting pressure on them and not having them do it. But I
[07:32.940 --> 07:35.860]  think you can bet your bottom dollar at this point they're going to move forward
[07:35.860 --> 07:40.140]  lockdowns because it is after all the permanent emergency that Clause Schwab
[07:40.140 --> 07:44.860]  for the UN and Bill Gates want. It is the great reset. Here is the Puppet in
[07:44.860 --> 07:53.300]  Chief. The things that I find a little disingenuous. When I suggest that
[07:53.660 --> 08:01.060]  people in zones where there is a high risk where the masks like you all are
[08:01.060 --> 08:05.180]  doing. I'm told the government should get out of the way.
[08:05.180 --> 08:11.980]  And not do that. They don't have the authority to do that. And I find it
[08:11.980 --> 08:16.580]  interesting that some of the very people are saying that who are whole
[08:16.580 --> 08:22.820]  government positions are people who are threatening that if a school teacher
[08:23.420 --> 08:31.500]  asked the student if they've been vaccinated or if a principal says that
[08:31.500 --> 08:35.820]  everyone in my school should wear a mask or the school board vote for it. That
[08:35.820 --> 08:41.100]  governor will nullify that. That governor has the authority to say you
[08:41.100 --> 08:45.900]  can't do that. I find that totally counterintuitive and quite frankly
[08:45.900 --> 08:49.340]  disingenuous. Do you have presidential powers to intervene in states like
[08:49.340 --> 08:54.500]  Texas and Florida where they are banning mask mandates? I don't believe
[08:54.500 --> 09:03.100]  that I do thus far. We're checking that. So there you go, ladies and
[09:03.100 --> 09:06.060]  gentlemen. They're gearing up. They're getting ready to do it. Whether it's
[09:06.060 --> 09:09.460]  today or next week, we have put major pressure on them because their program
[09:10.060 --> 09:15.140]  of enslavement is not going well. And speaking of mask, the M95, the supposedly
[09:15.140 --> 09:20.580]  best mask you can get to stop viruses and other particular getting through into
[09:20.580 --> 09:25.260]  your nasal cavity or into your throat and your lungs says on the back, this
[09:25.260 --> 09:30.820]  product is an ear loop mask. This product is not a respirator and will not
[09:30.820 --> 09:39.740]  provide any, any, any, any protection against COVID-19 coronavirus or other
[09:39.740 --> 09:44.180]  viruses or contaminants. Let me read that again. This product is an ear loop
[09:44.180 --> 09:51.700]  mask. This product is not, not a respirator and will not provide any
[09:51.700 --> 09:56.780]  protection against COVID-19 coronavirus or other viruses or contaminants. Let's
[09:56.780 --> 10:00.580]  just read it one more time. This product is an ear loop mask. This product is
[10:00.580 --> 10:07.260]  not, not, not a respirator and will not, not, not, not, not, not, not, not, not,
[10:07.260 --> 10:12.420]  not, not, not, not, not, not, not, not, not provide any, any, any, any protection
[10:12.420 --> 10:20.220]  against COVID-19, COVID-19 coronaviruses or other viruses, viruses or other
[10:20.220 --> 10:28.980]  contaminants. I'm not trying to be obnoxious here. You can go, we did it, to
[10:28.980 --> 10:35.500]  the local Walgreens or CVS or Walmart and you can go in and find boxes of them and
[10:35.500 --> 10:42.660]  they say the same damn thing on them because see they'd have liability for
[10:42.660 --> 10:46.980]  unfair trade practices and fake advertising, false advertising under
[10:46.980 --> 10:53.500]  federal and state law if they did that. You got all the studies and all the test
[10:53.500 --> 10:58.340]  people smoking and blowing out smoke out of them and a particular smokes bigger
[10:58.340 --> 11:03.300]  than the coronavirus and it's been likened to, you can fly 3, 4, 5 depending on
[11:03.300 --> 11:12.820]  the mask, 747s through the holes in the mask with the 747 being the size of the
[11:12.820 --> 11:18.420]  virus, much bigger than the virus per capita. So why is all that important?
[11:18.420 --> 11:22.660]  Because there's a war on logic, a war on reality, a war on science, a war on
[11:22.660 --> 11:29.220]  common sense. I'm going to cover next segment. Rand Paul came out and he's
[11:29.220 --> 11:34.420]  given several speeches on this now yesterday. Senate testimony has been
[11:34.420 --> 11:42.420]  censored in Senate hearings with medical experts, C-SPAN. His speeches have been
[11:42.420 --> 11:47.900]  censored on the floor and his speeches on Newsmax and now his response to the
[11:47.900 --> 11:57.180]  censorship got censored and his account has been frozen for seven days and if he
[11:57.180 --> 12:01.900]  uploads anything else saying mask or worthless or masks don't work, he will
[12:01.900 --> 12:06.540]  be terminated off of YouTube and you know all the rest of Big Tech will follow.
[12:06.540 --> 12:12.100]  He'll be unpersed like President Trump and the Congress sits there and takes it
[12:12.100 --> 12:15.580]  when they're acting beyond being a publisher following the directives of a
[12:15.580 --> 12:20.020]  foreign multinational corporate conglomerate called the UN and the
[12:20.020 --> 12:28.820]  WHO run by Fauci and Bill Gates. The CDC is a non-governmental quasi-governmental
[12:28.820 --> 12:32.540]  creation as well that says oh no one has to pay their rent anymore, oh we're
[12:32.540 --> 12:35.940]  going to federalize everything and put people in work camps. I've got the damn
[12:35.940 --> 12:42.300]  battle planned right here. Oh and I got more on that by the way today. It's called
[12:42.300 --> 12:45.540]  a power grab. People say well you can't do that. Well if we sit there and take it
[12:45.540 --> 12:53.260]  they can do it. Now you understand that and people should demonstrate this
[12:53.260 --> 12:58.660]  again. Senator Paul ought to get up with a box of M95 mask, point out that they're
[12:58.660 --> 13:03.820]  the best mask a consumer can buy. The one we're supposed to wear. Either the
[13:03.820 --> 13:06.740]  politicians all wear these cloth ones because you can't breathe through an
[13:06.740 --> 13:11.540]  M95. I don't blame them so it's total Kabuki Theater. With an M95 it's even
[13:11.540 --> 13:20.420]  more ridiculous with a cloth mask. So that's what's going on here. You know
[13:20.420 --> 13:24.580]  there's one way to make a mask actually work but only for about 20 seconds. You
[13:24.580 --> 13:27.580]  got to soak it in water and that's when you got to go into a burning house to
[13:27.580 --> 13:30.980]  get your kid or whatever you get a wet rag put over your face and it'll work
[13:30.980 --> 13:34.660]  for a little while through smoke. You better have goggles on and don't try
[13:34.660 --> 13:38.100]  that at home folks you'll die probably but there's one way to make cloth work.
[13:38.100 --> 13:45.380]  Soak it in water and again doesn't work very long. Nothing works. It's all a lie.
[13:45.380 --> 13:53.740]  It's like giving somebody a bandaid for a gunshot wound. It is ridiculous. It's
[13:53.740 --> 13:57.700]  like chopping somebody's head off and giving them an aspirin. It's ridiculous.
[13:57.700 --> 14:06.380]  It's redundant but we are relegated, segregated, imprisoned in the phantom
[14:06.380 --> 14:11.380]  zone here of infowars.com and man.video and we're kicking ass thanks to you
[14:11.380 --> 14:15.300]  reaching millions of people a day. But if we were allowed out on the playing field
[14:15.300 --> 14:18.380]  of ideas we would have hundreds of millions a day. Fought to be in jail.
[14:18.380 --> 14:21.420]  Bill Gates to be in jail. Klaus Schwab to be in jail. They would never have done this
[14:21.420 --> 14:25.140]  but they took over the internet when they launched all this where the internet
[14:25.140 --> 14:29.220]  kill switch selectively enforced and now they're blocking governors having
[14:29.220 --> 14:35.660]  hearings and senators having hearings and governors giving speeches and it's
[14:35.660 --> 14:41.140]  criminal. So if we let the UN and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Big Tech do
[14:41.140 --> 14:45.660]  this to us while Larry Page is living on his private island in Fiji and
[14:45.660 --> 14:53.300]  Sergey Brin then we deserve it. Seriously and now they're coming for our
[14:53.300 --> 14:58.740]  children with TV ads all over the news saying oh soon it'll be approved for
[14:58.740 --> 15:04.060]  children. Children and then that's approved for emergency use and now
[15:04.060 --> 15:08.300]  they're gonna kill our kids and may our children will stir and bury him and put
[15:08.300 --> 15:12.340]  up with that human sacrifice to show our fealty to the Democratic Party and the
[15:12.340 --> 15:17.820]  Socialist and the Chai comms. Even in common with China they don't censor a
[15:17.820 --> 15:22.820]  member of the Politburo when they're on TV unless they go and arrest them. But
[15:22.820 --> 15:27.060]  here they do so we're only one inch away from them just coming for our guns
[15:27.060 --> 15:30.340]  and everything else they've set the whole thing up. You got Democrats taking
[15:30.340 --> 15:34.660]  their kids in to sign them up for studies to be injected with it. I mean
[15:34.660 --> 15:38.860]  you hear about lab rats and stuff that Fauci tests on but that's okay he's got
[15:38.860 --> 15:44.940]  kids now the whole public's being guinea pig tested on in this new form of human
[15:44.940 --> 15:50.020]  sacrifice of our children. History is repeating itself yet again. We'll play
[15:50.020 --> 15:55.660]  in the censored Rand Paul speech on the other side. Thanks for keeping us on the
[15:55.660 --> 15:59.780]  air. Only you the listeners have done this. I salute you. If you're concerned
[15:59.780 --> 16:03.100]  about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[16:03.100 --> 16:07.220]  electricity this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:07.220 --> 16:12.700]  Here's why. We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock. These

[18:02.860 --> 18:06.940]  basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you
[18:06.940 --> 18:11.180]  wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your
[18:11.180 --> 18:14.500]  show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival
[18:14.500 --> 18:18.420]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out
[18:18.420 --> 18:21.260]  with that too you had you know with a deep burden source you know and I got
[18:21.260 --> 18:25.220]  really excited about that so I took it and then in two weeks I went from brain
[18:25.220 --> 18:30.460]  fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again
[18:30.460 --> 18:34.700]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[18:34.700 --> 18:38.260]  years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your

[20:20.860 --> 20:31.300]  I came here looking for something I couldn't find anywhere else I don't
[20:31.300 --> 20:41.940]  want to be nobody just want a chance to be myself I've done a thousand miles of
[20:41.940 --> 20:53.660]  filming yes I've worn blisters on my heels trying to find me something better
[20:53.660 --> 21:01.260]  on the streets of Bakersfield welcome back the Alex Jones show really
[21:01.260 --> 21:07.040]  appreciate you all tuning in today so one of the hundreds of things that the
[21:07.040 --> 21:14.820]  WTO and the WHO and the United Nations the control our country won't let our
[21:14.820 --> 21:19.700]  elected leaders say over the main communication system and won't let
[21:19.700 --> 21:24.500]  citizens take clips of and repeat talk about election meddling policy meddling
[21:24.500 --> 21:37.500]  talk about mafia bullying tactics is that mask do not protect you they do 0 0 0 to
[21:37.500 --> 21:44.820]  protect the person wearing them from outside groups they do depending on the
[21:44.820 --> 21:52.060]  mass 10 20 30 percent on stopping if you are infected and that's why Senator
[21:52.060 --> 21:59.980]  Paul who's a medical doctor said if you're sick you should stay away from
[21:59.980 --> 22:07.300]  people and yes if you have to wear an M95 mask it does something but the claim
[22:07.300 --> 22:11.620]  that it keeps children safe and that people that aren't sick should wear it
[22:11.620 --> 22:20.780]  is preposterous and is a sign of control and subservience and look at all these
[22:20.780 --> 22:27.380]  articles WUSA TV channel 9 they've all done it verified fact check why a
[22:27.380 --> 22:32.220]  face max box says it provides no protection to the wearer you try to
[22:32.220 --> 22:37.340]  put this out on Twitter Facebook YouTube Google any of them Apple they won't let
[22:37.340 --> 22:41.620]  you put these articles out local news national news and again that's not just
[22:41.620 --> 22:48.500]  censorship that's cartels of big media who admittedly get together and meet they
[22:48.500 --> 22:54.100]  just met a few weeks ago up in the Idaho and they decide what the new things
[22:54.100 --> 22:58.580]  are you can't say you can't criticize the open border you can't criticize gun
[22:58.580 --> 23:03.260]  control you can't criticize drag queen story time you can't criticize the UN
[23:03.260 --> 23:07.540]  you can't criticize George Soros you can't say the lockdown shouldn't happen
[23:07.540 --> 23:18.340]  you can't you can't criticize anything they want that is a giant cartel agenda
[23:18.340 --> 23:23.700]  of fear and now they're selling all the baby toys with mask on it this is a
[23:23.700 --> 23:28.380]  permanent thing that you're a patient you're sick you're dirty you're bad
[23:28.380 --> 23:32.620]  you're a bad person and all these major psychological groups have come out and
[23:32.620 --> 23:37.140]  said this is causing massive suicide massive problems depressing children
[23:37.140 --> 23:40.380]  screwing them up making them think they're bad making them live in fear and
[23:40.380 --> 23:45.340]  of course that's the plan and we sit here and we take it from the corrupt
[23:45.340 --> 23:49.620]  teachers unions and the big banks and all of it
[23:51.660 --> 23:55.660]  surgeon general warns the public stop buying face masks says they don't work
[23:55.660 --> 24:02.620]  which was true back in February of last year but you can't say it now see how
[24:02.620 --> 24:07.260]  that works so here ladies and gentlemen is the censored part of the newsmax video
[24:07.260 --> 24:12.180]  they also according to senator Paul censored one of his Senate floor
[24:12.180 --> 24:16.420]  speeches where he said it as well that's been taken down and so jamming
[24:16.420 --> 24:18.900]  America's communications that's what these criminal groups are doing while
[24:18.900 --> 24:22.860]  they help China oppress their own population and countless other
[24:22.860 --> 24:26.300]  authoritarian countries and then we'll see the response video that's the senator
[24:26.300 --> 24:31.580]  put out which is now also been removed and had his account suspended next it
[24:31.580 --> 24:35.980]  will be terminated he's been told here it is private he said in emails in last
[24:35.980 --> 24:40.500]  spring that most of the fact most of the masks you can get over the counter don't
[24:40.500 --> 24:43.700]  work because the virus particles are too small and go right through them that's
[24:43.700 --> 24:47.620]  still true they don't work there's no value and yet we're mandating them by
[24:47.620 --> 24:51.740]  law because and this is where I really have the disagreement with Fauci one he's
[24:51.740 --> 24:55.700]  not telling the truth but he's promulgating bad science there's pseudo
[24:55.700 --> 24:59.940]  science so your eighth graders running the half mile or the mile outside
[24:59.940 --> 25:05.700]  wearing a mask is probably going to not be good for their health it's not
[25:05.700 --> 25:09.140]  comfortable and there's no science to say you're preventing disease it's
[25:09.140 --> 25:13.100]  really just a disservice to the public the main thing about the mask when he
[25:13.100 --> 25:17.500]  said they didn't work at all was he didn't want by people buying the N95 mass
[25:17.500 --> 25:20.820]  and people in the hospital the doctors not having enough so he just admits that
[25:20.820 --> 25:26.380]  he lied but it was a lie for our own good supposedly now that's what got
[25:26.380 --> 25:31.140]  censored all true all completely true here's his response video again also
[25:31.140 --> 25:37.020]  taken down by the thought police recently I shared a video on my YouTube page it
[25:37.020 --> 25:40.660]  was an interview between myself and a journalist where we discussed a variety
[25:40.660 --> 25:46.180]  of topics including the science behind wearing masks apparently because I
[25:46.180 --> 25:50.980]  dared to contradict dr. Fauci and the government YouTube has removed my video
[25:50.980 --> 25:56.700]  if you want to see the video it's up on rumble.com rumble.com does not censor
[25:56.700 --> 26:01.380]  the news YouTube said the video violated their policy because of my
[26:01.380 --> 26:05.020]  comments on masks and that they don't allow videos that contradict
[26:05.020 --> 26:09.980]  government's guidance on COVID YouTube may be a private entity but they're
[26:09.980 --> 26:13.020]  acting like an arm of the government censoring those who present an
[26:13.020 --> 26:18.340]  alternative view to the science deniers in Washington people like dr. Fauci who
[26:18.340 --> 26:22.480]  have lied to the American people time and time again about masks here's the
[26:22.480 --> 26:27.540]  thing what I said in that video is actual science most of the mask you get
[26:27.540 --> 26:32.260]  over the counter don't work they don't prevent infection saying cloth masks
[26:32.260 --> 26:37.140]  work when they don't actually risks lives as someone may choose to care for a
[26:37.140 --> 26:41.740]  loved one with COVID while only wearing a cloth mask this is not only bad
[26:41.740 --> 26:46.300]  advice but also potentially deadly misinformation what I said in the
[26:46.300 --> 26:51.060]  interview that YouTube censored is the truth it's fact if you want to hear
[26:51.060 --> 26:55.260]  exactly what I said go ahead check out the video on my rumble channel the
[26:55.260 --> 27:00.060]  channel's name is Rand Paul here's some of the science for the YouTube science
[27:00.060 --> 27:05.260]  deniers a Danish study of 6,000 participants found that wearing a
[27:05.260 --> 27:09.700]  surgical mask did not significantly reduce a person's risk of COVID-19
[27:09.700 --> 27:14.060]  infection compared to the risks facing those who did not wear masks a
[27:14.060 --> 27:22.460]  Vietnamese study of 1,600 participants found that cloth masks allow for 97%
[27:22.460 --> 27:27.860]  penetration of particles the same size as the virus this study also found that
[27:27.860 --> 27:32.700]  cloth mask wearers had a higher rate of infection than the control group who
[27:32.700 --> 27:38.100]  wore no masks now when it comes to n95 masks I have always said that those do
[27:38.100 --> 27:42.820]  work dr. Fauci knew that too which is why he originally lied to the public and
[27:42.820 --> 27:46.860]  said that the mask don't work he feared not enough health workers would be able
[27:46.860 --> 27:52.460]  to buy n95 masks if the public were buying them he justified his lies by
[27:52.460 --> 27:56.620]  explaining that he was trying to shape human behavior like so many
[27:56.620 --> 28:02.900]  Fauciism he lies to us for our own good or so he believes ask any doctor or
[28:02.900 --> 28:08.460]  nurse what masks they wear when they go into a COVID patients room only an n95
[28:08.460 --> 28:13.020]  mask because the other masks don't work let's stop right there and again those
[28:13.020 --> 28:18.260]  are not even 50% effective but it does do something so this is all a giant
[28:18.260 --> 28:22.580]  complete lie and it doesn't matter he's elected in the government at the highest
[28:22.580 --> 28:28.500]  level of the legislative branch and he can't talk to you over Facebook Twitter
[28:28.500 --> 28:32.340]  Google YouTube any of it they're all together in a cartel they're not just
[28:32.340 --> 28:36.220]  working with a select party in government and a foreign power the
[28:36.220 --> 28:41.380]  United Nations but they are carteling together to agree to have the same
[28:41.380 --> 28:45.340]  message so it's not just one company has this policy the other has that policy
[28:45.340 --> 28:49.940]  that's bad enough they're all lockstep together which is why the battle plan to
[28:49.940 --> 28:53.460]  take over is called operation lockstep from the Rockefeller Foundation who's
[28:53.460 --> 28:59.460]  in charge of US government policy and now censoring sitting US senators hey
[28:59.460 --> 29:04.260]  everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture me too but
[29:04.260 --> 29:07.780]  listen after all the research all the conflicting studies after all the
[29:07.780 --> 29:12.020]  squabbling there's one thing almost everyone agrees on it's that immune
[29:12.020 --> 29:15.740]  system health can literally be the difference between life and death you
[29:15.740 --> 29:19.780]  probably already believe that I certainly do so here's the thing I wanted
[29:19.780 --> 29:24.060]  to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually
[29:24.060 --> 29:28.740]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support now you'll

[33:45.980 --> 33:53.060]  don't love you love you by that welcome back ladies and gentlemen we are
[33:53.060 --> 34:03.820]  broadcasting worldwide and to say that I've reached information overload is
[34:03.820 --> 34:08.820]  putting it extremely extremely lightly but I think you're all in that same
[34:08.820 --> 34:13.220]  position and that's the globalist plan is to overwhelm us so much with the
[34:13.220 --> 34:16.980]  tearing that we just give up and roll over and let them take over completely
[34:16.980 --> 34:22.020]  but that is far worse than the position we're already in and much more hellish
[34:22.020 --> 34:26.700]  and God's watchings and we've got children to defend and a lot of innocent
[34:26.700 --> 34:35.820]  people so we're not gonna let that happen now I was about to go live today
[34:37.700 --> 34:45.380]  and going over literally hundreds of articles I noticed a theme last night in
[34:45.380 --> 34:52.100]  this morning doing research I've been doing research since 5 a.m. this morning
[34:52.100 --> 34:58.060]  of major victory so I intended to come in today and write a headline about major
[34:58.060 --> 35:01.540]  victory and the globalists are in trouble and I got so busy with all the
[35:01.540 --> 35:07.940]  other news that came out and came up that I forgot about that big stack of
[35:07.940 --> 35:12.620]  news I've got right here all the victories and even more coming in as we
[35:12.620 --> 35:20.500]  speak they just brought me more victories big ones and and that reminded
[35:20.500 --> 35:25.460]  me of that I was gonna have a whole show about victory but as bad as things are
[35:25.460 --> 35:28.780]  we need to know what's working what's good and where we're winning and we're
[35:28.780 --> 35:32.700]  making some major headway against the globalist effect if you watch them on
[35:32.700 --> 35:37.660]  CNN or MSNBC or even in the foreign news they look upset they look really like
[35:37.660 --> 35:40.260]  they're fighting their lives because they are I mean they have committed
[35:40.260 --> 35:45.780]  incredible crimes and so there were two things I wanted to hit today now
[35:45.780 --> 35:49.580]  they're going after our children and now this is truly an existential threat and
[35:49.580 --> 35:54.740]  how it's on us if we don't stop them and I mean it I mean it is on us if we
[35:54.740 --> 36:02.580]  don't stop them and for me it's not a courage issue you got to stop them the
[36:02.580 --> 36:07.940]  right way or they can use your action against them as a victory so it's a
[36:07.940 --> 36:11.260]  it's like threading the needle but my brain's working around the clock
[36:11.260 --> 36:17.620]  believe me I got gray hair for a reason
[36:20.020 --> 36:27.220]  so we've got that big area and how that as a binary point orbits the other and
[36:27.220 --> 36:35.020]  it orbiting itself the big victories that are happening but then I was
[36:35.020 --> 36:40.660]  reminded watching the clips this morning of Senator Paul who is a medical doctor
[36:40.660 --> 36:48.740]  on top of it trained in epidemiology trained in virology that's what he was
[36:48.740 --> 36:54.620]  first gonna do trained in pathology that's what he was for years and then he
[36:54.620 --> 36:58.020]  wanted to make money because his wife I don't blame her wanted money to live in
[36:58.020 --> 37:01.220]  a nice house and a lot of doctors don't make a lot of money these days he went
[37:01.220 --> 37:07.020]  to be an optometrist and then on to do eye surgeries we come up top eye surgeon
[37:07.020 --> 37:13.820]  that's where you make the money but here he is
[37:16.140 --> 37:21.740]  laying out things that are on the damn box of the mask even the M95 says can't
[37:21.740 --> 37:28.900]  protect you because it's not you know 100% it's not even close but the cloth
[37:28.900 --> 37:37.300]  mask zero and he can't get that information out and that just shows you
[37:37.300 --> 37:40.860]  how the abuse of these globalists has been operating where we've been under
[37:40.860 --> 37:49.060]  their thumbs so long that we just become accustomed to it and that's how
[37:49.060 --> 37:54.460]  tyrants get you is just by increment taking more and more away where we just
[37:54.460 --> 37:59.020]  accept it so I have the incredible abuse of our children a stack of that where
[37:59.020 --> 38:03.500]  they're now calling them murderers first it was drunk drivers and criminals not
[38:03.500 --> 38:07.700]  wearing masks and and now adults are murderers if you're not wearing a mask
[38:07.700 --> 38:14.140]  and now children are murderers Oklahoma school board members says massless
[38:14.140 --> 38:20.780]  children will commit murder in push for school mandate then I got a clip of a
[38:20.780 --> 38:24.700]  mother out in California I went destroyer played yesterday I didn't see it
[38:24.700 --> 38:27.700]  my list but I want to make sure it gets added I want to air her start of the
[38:27.700 --> 38:37.100]  next hour where this mother oh it is on the list good job where the mother just
[38:37.100 --> 38:43.900]  destroys them and explains tyrants are zero the humans are a hundred percent
[38:43.900 --> 38:47.540]  the tyranny's always fall and she basically explains to them how to cow
[38:47.540 --> 38:53.380]  eat the cabbage she says we fix your brakes and we took your food and see
[38:53.380 --> 38:56.260]  that's what always happens when a tyranny goes long enough and if men
[38:56.260 --> 39:02.860]  actually roll over historically the women just start poisoning everybody so
[39:02.860 --> 39:06.700]  look for that to begin that that's already starting and that's what I've
[39:06.700 --> 39:11.620]  said if you're the domestic help of these globalist take really good care of
[39:11.620 --> 39:16.260]  and tuck them in real tight at night because we should bow down to them and
[39:16.260 --> 39:21.660]  let them murder our children and let them chemtrail us and I think we should
[39:21.660 --> 39:30.380]  not hair a little hair on their chinny chin chin but I don't think we're to
[39:30.380 --> 39:35.580]  that point yet are we having to tuck them in at night because there aren't
[39:35.580 --> 39:45.060]  when there is the absence of men women will become men and it's not that
[39:45.060 --> 39:48.140]  women are even cowards they're not they're looking for direction like
[39:48.140 --> 39:52.020]  anybody else but see when there is no direction women are going to take things
[39:52.020 --> 39:56.500]  into their own hands just watch it's going to happen sorry started but the
[39:56.500 --> 39:59.500]  globalists are so scared you know their children are going to take matters of
[39:59.500 --> 40:04.380]  their own hands that's why these globalists all live alone by themselves
[40:04.380 --> 40:06.860]  and locked their doors at night and have armed guards because they know they're
[40:06.860 --> 40:11.780]  bad people and they know that they're going to push and push and push and push
[40:11.780 --> 40:18.620]  and censor and prod and bully till we come for them and they think we're so
[40:18.620 --> 40:24.020]  stupid they've set up the societal calamity the societal clash the
[40:24.020 --> 40:30.700]  societal fault lines the battle lines are on of your gay or straight white or
[40:30.700 --> 40:36.980]  black or where you live or what your income is when it's about your
[40:36.980 --> 40:43.340]  political affiliation pro-human or anti-human and it's about what you
[40:43.340 --> 40:48.540]  stand for and so they hope as they implode the economy and solidly control
[40:48.540 --> 40:52.980]  to then stir up riots and go look it's the black people and then have the state
[40:52.980 --> 41:00.580]  side with the quote black people so that when there's a revolution it's white
[41:00.580 --> 41:07.380]  against black instead of against the globalist humans I'm for the red
[41:07.380 --> 41:11.260]  revolution but not the one of the communists see they always invert
[41:11.260 --> 41:16.300]  everything we've all got red blood the blood of Christ frees us and heals us so
[41:16.300 --> 41:23.620]  I call for fighting fire with fire I call for countering the red terror with
[41:23.620 --> 41:29.860]  the red blood of Jesus and coming together with our red blood and saying
[41:29.860 --> 41:33.940]  you think you scare us with your red star gonna spill our blood we're more
[41:33.940 --> 41:37.180]  than happy when the rubber meets the road to spill blood but believe it's
[41:37.180 --> 41:40.740]  gonna be a lot more your blood getting spilled than ours and we don't have
[41:40.740 --> 41:45.220]  anything to prove good people are killing machines organized focused ready
[41:45.220 --> 41:50.820]  committed we don't want to kill to empower ourselves or to steal something or
[41:50.820 --> 41:55.100]  to feel like we're men we only kill to protect the innocent but when the killing
[41:55.100 --> 42:01.780]  starts the killing is gonna go for a long time and those that started the
[42:01.780 --> 42:10.060]  fight are gonna reap the whirlwind but I'll tell you this most of these slaves
[42:10.060 --> 42:13.660]  of the system don't even know what they're part of and that's why it's key
[42:13.660 --> 42:17.180]  for us to give the testament of the reality to understand what's going on
[42:17.180 --> 42:22.580]  okay so I'm gonna try to reset here there it's just so much to cover so much
[42:22.580 --> 42:27.940]  incredible news but I will you know we've already hit the censorship of our
[42:27.940 --> 42:31.740]  government of our elected officials by this foreign multinational evil coming
[42:31.740 --> 42:41.020]  in that's taking over and when we return I want to just hit the latest with all
[42:41.020 --> 42:47.500]  these top scientists coming out and confirming the really really powerful
[42:47.500 --> 42:51.020]  information that the covid vaccine is a bio weapon the next hour I'm gonna lay
[42:51.020 --> 42:56.740]  out the good news and boy is there a lot of it stay with us
[42:58.180 --> 43:02.740]  it's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021
[43:02.740 --> 43:07.420]  we're seeing world government world IDs being announced forced inoculations all
[43:07.420 --> 43:11.060]  the tyranny we warned of is down here but on the good side there is also a
[43:11.060 --> 43:15.300]  global awakening the likes of which this planet has never seen so truly the
[43:15.300 --> 43:19.060]  battle between good and evil is now front and center that's why I want to

[43:56.660 --> 44:01.620]  at infowarstore.com so when I first started taking survival skills
[44:01.620 --> 44:05.740]  basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you
[44:05.740 --> 44:09.940]  wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your
[44:09.940 --> 44:13.260]  show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival
[44:13.260 --> 44:17.180]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out
[44:17.180 --> 44:20.260]  with that shield you had you know with a deeper source you know and I got really
[44:20.260 --> 44:24.900]  excited about that so I took it and then in two weeks I went from brain fog to
[44:24.900 --> 44:29.300]  like literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again
[44:29.300 --> 44:33.500]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[44:33.500 --> 44:37.060]  years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your

[44:44.180 --> 44:47.820]  amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[44:47.820 --> 44:51.620]  we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to
[44:51.620 --> 44:55.940]  take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother I thank you so

[46:04.500 --> 46:09.060]  gone for beta testing to operational the globalist are out of the open with
[46:09.060 --> 46:13.540]  their planetary depopulation takeover their robot takeover but the good news
[46:13.540 --> 46:16.620]  is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working
[46:16.620 --> 46:20.300]  across the planet for decades to get ready for this to be able to find it

[46:24.620 --> 46:28.100]  happening we have a real chance of defeating it if we ask God for guidance
[46:28.100 --> 46:32.260]  we will defeat it so prayer is essential research is essential getting
[46:32.260 --> 46:36.180]  prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential at the same
[46:36.180 --> 46:40.340]  time supporting info wars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air

[47:01.580 --> 47:08.100]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:32.580 --> 47:40.900]  all right next hour we got some really good news that monster that gun
[47:40.900 --> 47:45.700]  grabbing anti-american who works with that other piece of trash Millie and
[47:45.700 --> 47:49.700]  other piece of garbage on array that ran the gun confiscation during Carina
[47:49.700 --> 48:00.140]  Katrina they have had to back off forced inoculation of the troops in the fine
[48:00.140 --> 48:04.140]  print I'm gonna be covering that for you coming up the start of the next hour
[48:04.140 --> 48:08.380]  that is just the beginnings of the good news as we begin to turn the tide
[48:08.380 --> 48:13.940]  against these monsters but this is key beyond key it's it's it's seminal and
[48:13.940 --> 48:23.700]  it is absolutely the genesis foundation of everything we do they shoot for a
[48:23.700 --> 48:33.540]  million miles of power grab we push them back 800,000 miles but they still get
[48:33.540 --> 48:39.100]  200,000 miles on us you got to push them all the way back and annihilate them
[48:39.100 --> 48:42.420]  politically you got to remove them or they grow back like a tumor you don't
[48:42.420 --> 48:46.660]  go into a cancer and cut 80% of it out no he just grows right back and then it
[48:46.660 --> 48:51.900]  metastasizes then it's too late now you got cancer all over your body so the
[48:51.900 --> 48:57.540]  reason they do all these outrageous things is the more they hail Mary the
[48:57.540 --> 49:00.900]  more they move the ball down the field because we never take the quarterback
[49:00.900 --> 49:06.500]  out we never go and dig them out of their holes that they're running their
[49:06.500 --> 49:11.860]  systems out of in the big foundations and so I don't want them to trick us in
[49:11.860 --> 49:15.620]  any race wars or any blowing up buildings or any type of offensive
[49:15.620 --> 49:21.060]  violence that is all no no we need to violently with the truth assault them
[49:21.060 --> 49:26.060]  and expose them and light them up politically so that everyone knows
[49:26.060 --> 49:29.620]  they're the author of all the destruction that's coming and then if
[49:29.620 --> 49:33.300]  they're blamed for what they're doing they'll be destroyed by their own
[49:33.300 --> 49:39.340]  political weight understand they need to blame it on all sorts of other side
[49:39.340 --> 49:44.460]  issues as long as they get to blame everything they're doing right now will
[49:44.460 --> 49:48.860]  end up being hung on them where it deserves to be instead of being put on
[49:48.860 --> 49:52.220]  our children with the news saying they're little germ carriers and they're
[49:52.220 --> 49:56.260]  causing the new big outbreak and by the way there were the same number of deaths
[49:56.260 --> 50:00.140]  and illnesses last year as the year before this year I don't just have it
[50:00.140 --> 50:05.380]  anecdotally I've got the sources there is horrible COVID all over the world
[50:05.380 --> 50:10.580]  right now and it's not the COVID of last year that was the exaggerated hyped up
[50:10.580 --> 50:16.660]  virus it's the spike protein sloughing off and shedding and spreading but the
[50:16.660 --> 50:22.900]  majority 95% around the world's the number of people ill took the shot and
[50:22.900 --> 50:28.100]  that's even mainline news now so first Biden says oh it's a hundred percent you
[50:28.100 --> 50:31.660]  can't get cover you take the shot you said it again last night but it surrogates
[50:31.660 --> 50:35.500]  go well no no it's just not as serious if you take it so since when does an
[50:35.500 --> 50:42.460]  inoculation partway work that's not how it works this is not an inoculation this
[50:42.460 --> 50:48.780]  is a gene therapy and they always planned over a year ago they said oh you'll
[50:48.780 --> 50:54.700]  need booster shots this is a gene therapy this is not a vaccine and so what
[50:54.700 --> 50:59.020]  they've done is removed a large portion of the world's immune system where
[50:59.020 --> 51:03.100]  they're gonna need these shots now on a routine basis for every cold virus that
[51:03.100 --> 51:11.860]  comes along but then every shot ends up making them sick they're only making it
[51:11.860 --> 51:17.060]  worse and yeah yesterday the Secret Service was directing Puppet Biden on
[51:17.060 --> 51:21.820]  where to go back into the building where the proper entrance was and he didn't
[51:21.820 --> 51:28.900]  know and went and got lost and they just let him in to another door you think oh
[51:28.900 --> 51:33.420]  that's a joke on the globalist so that's a joke on us they put him in knowing he
[51:33.420 --> 51:38.780]  was cognitively bad and knowing he would degenerate like this and knowing it
[51:38.780 --> 51:43.860]  would create a constitutional crisis and they've got all the crises lined up for
[51:43.860 --> 51:48.140]  next year that's when the real super lockdowns are gonna happen they're
[51:48.140 --> 51:52.620]  already putting them in as you see right now but doing it more stealthily so you
[51:52.620 --> 51:56.900]  can't create opposition against it so they can kill the real economy consolidate
[51:56.900 --> 52:04.420]  control as they prepare the death blow there it is Swedish expert claims
[52:04.420 --> 52:08.700]  people could require as many as five covid vaccine shots not an expert it's
[52:08.700 --> 52:13.100]  a PR firm person they were always planning that Justin Trudeau's already
[52:13.100 --> 52:18.700]  bought the shots out to 2026 he's gonna make you take them to travel or live
[52:18.700 --> 52:25.700]  experimental shots to see by having experimental shots no one has any
[52:25.700 --> 52:29.500]  liability because the law is not even being followed it's just a wild wild
[52:29.500 --> 52:35.580]  west let's go over these headlines study finds most highly educated
[52:35.580 --> 52:41.020]  Americans are also the most vaccine hasn't it yeah the majority of the CDC
[52:41.020 --> 52:45.620]  won't take the shots very powerful article by Paul Joseph Watson I suggest
[52:45.620 --> 52:49.500]  you share it the left's always about how educated they are and how they're all the
[52:49.500 --> 52:55.260]  smart people but that's not the case also the higher your earnings are the more
[52:55.260 --> 53:00.980]  you don't take it because you know how to read covid cases fell 40% in the UK
[53:00.980 --> 53:05.700]  after restrictions were lifted proving the experts wrong yet again yes stay in
[53:05.700 --> 53:09.500]  your house by yourself not sunshine makes regular viruses make you sick then
[53:09.500 --> 53:16.020]  they call it covid Lindsay's logic he actually says on video you need to get
[53:16.020 --> 53:22.500]  vaccinated because I took the shot and got sick Fauci supports vaccine mandates
[53:22.500 --> 53:26.900]  and says now isn't the time for individual freedom oh no it's time for you
[53:26.900 --> 53:32.220]  that ran the Wuhan lab and then own the vaccine stocks to take over
[53:32.220 --> 53:37.460]  judge orders man to get covid injection or face jail time this is happening all
[53:37.460 --> 53:41.140]  over the country it's happened several times in Houston this is now happening
[53:41.140 --> 53:49.620]  in Hamilton County judge in Ohio so now the judge is a doctor I've seen cases
[53:49.620 --> 53:55.180]  now where judges one in Texas ordered the the person's like five-year-old kid
[53:55.180 --> 54:00.260]  it's like three or four or five was a small child to take the shot and the
[54:00.260 --> 54:04.100]  people went in the divorce hearing the judge said I'm not gonna give it to
[54:04.100 --> 54:07.220]  either one of you you must give the child the covid shot they said it's not
[54:07.220 --> 54:13.700]  approved the judge said I don't care I rule earth you can't even get the
[54:13.700 --> 54:16.740]  experimental shot for kids yet but the judge doesn't care because they're a
[54:16.740 --> 54:24.020]  virtue signaler this is coming up next hour in fact I'm gonna play this first
[54:24.020 --> 54:29.060]  talk about victory how about success about fighting back step on info wars
[54:29.060 --> 54:33.500]  calm mom destroys County board over covid restrictions mask and vaccines
[54:33.500 --> 54:39.380]  that is coming up start of the next hour that's another very powerful report
[54:39.380 --> 54:43.220]  from John Baum here at the start of the report that's in the John bound section
[54:43.220 --> 54:47.820]  of band on video suggest you share it a desperate message from the real medical
[54:47.820 --> 54:51.540]  community I'm very proud of the real medical community the vast majority are
[54:51.540 --> 54:56.020]  fighting back speaking up against the censorship at every place they can County
[54:56.020 --> 55:00.980]  Commission city councils County fairs churches school boards state
[55:00.980 --> 55:05.660]  legislatures Congress but they're being censored by multinational corporations
[55:05.660 --> 55:14.460]  in bed with China how outrageous this is a war of will for our children now
[55:14.460 --> 55:18.140]  they're coming with the deadly injections that don't even protect our
[55:18.140 --> 55:21.020]  children and make them sick and are we gonna put up with it and have their
[55:21.020 --> 55:24.260]  blood and their pain on our hands as we already put up with all the autistic
[55:24.260 --> 55:28.420]  children that green lit this massive escalation because we didn't stop what
[55:28.420 --> 55:34.660]  happened to our artistic boys the globalist set up the attack this is so
[55:34.660 --> 55:38.820]  bombshell I'll cover this after I cover that bombshell study finds mRNA
[55:38.820 --> 55:42.700]  vaccine may cause tragic and even catastrophic side effects major
[55:42.700 --> 55:47.860]  University extremely prestigious and another major University in Canada we
[55:47.860 --> 55:53.620]  made a big mistake cover vaccine spike protein travels from the injection site
[55:53.620 --> 56:02.780]  and causes organ damage that's coming up there is so much to get to today all
[56:02.780 --> 56:10.540]  right separately ladies and gentlemen I am energized because when we have the

[56:21.660 --> 56:27.420]  people but because of the COVID lockdowns not from COVID but from the
[56:27.420 --> 56:30.860]  globalist COVID didn't do this the globalist did it a lot of our products
[56:30.860 --> 56:33.540]  we couldn't get in because we use high quality organic high-end products we
[56:33.540 --> 56:36.700]  could buy plenty of stuff from China I could buy all the charcoal toothpaste I
[56:36.700 --> 56:41.060]  wanted from China for one-third the price but I didn't do it six months later

[1:00:08.060 --> 1:00:10.660]  victories against the globalist if you're a lot of you're asking why aren't
[1:00:10.660 --> 1:00:14.660]  you at the cyber symposium well I took the airplane I was supposed to get on
[1:00:14.660 --> 1:00:18.020]  this morning breaking down and then not being able to get another flight till
[1:00:18.020 --> 1:00:21.340]  this evening and then only getting one day of the symposium I took that as a
[1:00:21.340 --> 1:00:24.740]  thing to just stay here I was on the fence I wanted to go it's so jam packed
[1:00:24.740 --> 1:00:28.460]  it's got a lot of great information you got a feed of it up on info wars.com and
[1:00:28.460 --> 1:00:32.900]  so I just decided to stay here with my family and with the crew which is my
[1:00:32.900 --> 1:00:37.220]  family but here's a Dr. Frank I was just getting a cup of coffee like 30 minutes
[1:00:37.220 --> 1:00:42.700]  ago we have OAN on in the coffee room not Fox anymore and I saw this guy up
[1:00:42.700 --> 1:00:47.140]  there laying out little factoids that are absolutely key the way these big
[1:00:47.140 --> 1:00:52.620]  companies use words here it is the behind closed doors tried to make it so
[1:00:52.620 --> 1:00:56.900]  that these machines were allowed to connect to the internet they would be
[1:00:56.900 --> 1:01:05.740]  allowed to break allowed allowed was was the EAC and and and they had the what
[1:01:05.740 --> 1:01:10.820]  is the board yes the board members with dominion voting you know all the the
[1:01:10.820 --> 1:01:14.300]  ESS hard inner civic all the companies that they would be allowed during the
[1:01:14.300 --> 1:01:18.060]  election to be connected they tried to sneak it in and Philip Stark who is on
[1:01:18.060 --> 1:01:23.180]  the you know an EAC board member is in a lawsuit trying to stop that bill or not
[1:01:23.180 --> 1:01:28.740]  that bill but that amendment to their rules so yes yes one of the things you've
[1:01:28.740 --> 1:01:32.820]  noticed is that there's a phrase and there's a phrase you'll hear all the
[1:01:32.820 --> 1:01:36.620]  time it says the machines are not connected to the internet have you
[1:01:36.620 --> 1:01:41.220]  noticed they all say that exactly that way that's a very parsed sentence
[1:01:41.220 --> 1:01:45.540]  deliberately said in that way and you know sort of like what the definition of
[1:01:45.540 --> 1:01:51.540]  is is remember that the definition of is is I get I'll do her next so there's
[1:01:51.540 --> 1:01:54.780]  this the phrase the machines are not connected to the internet well if you
[1:01:54.780 --> 1:01:58.500]  think about it if the machines off right now that's a true statement the
[1:01:58.500 --> 1:02:01.100]  machines are not connected to the internet the machines over that's sort
[1:02:01.100 --> 1:02:06.620]  of true also that did they didn't say the machines cannot be connected to the
[1:02:06.620 --> 1:02:10.340]  internet they didn't say that didn't they they said they are not connected to
[1:02:10.340 --> 1:02:13.980]  the internet which which I think by extrapolation what they're trying to
[1:02:13.980 --> 1:02:17.580]  get you to think in your head is that they are not connected during the
[1:02:17.580 --> 1:02:23.060]  election but then you even heard Patrick say a minute ago that some of the
[1:02:23.060 --> 1:02:26.340]  precinct workers as soon as the election is over they like to turn on the
[1:02:26.340 --> 1:02:31.620]  internet and have it upload the data for them so in other words the machines can
[1:02:31.620 --> 1:02:35.620]  connect to the internet come on you saw you saw that a personal case he's got
[1:02:35.620 --> 1:02:40.340]  photographs of the of the card that's embedded you saw it in the movie you that
[1:02:40.340 --> 1:02:44.900]  just got the 3g and 4g cell phone card there well I guess there's a cell phone
[1:02:44.900 --> 1:02:49.620]  count as the internet you see what I mean this is a parsed sentence right this
[1:02:49.620 --> 1:02:53.940]  is a parsed sentence and besides we have the recordings so you know let's stop
[1:02:53.940 --> 1:03:00.580]  arguing about it yesterday from Montana right from Montana you bet 46 of the
[1:03:00.580 --> 1:03:07.180]  56 counties in Montana use ESNS machines the 10 counties that hand count are all
[1:03:07.180 --> 1:03:14.060]  green on Seth Kessels map so the county Republican chair says no problem in
[1:03:14.060 --> 1:03:20.740]  Montana we don't use dominion any comments yeah that this is one of those
[1:03:20.740 --> 1:03:25.820]  situations where you're being distracted by the dialogue the dialogue makes it
[1:03:25.820 --> 1:03:30.740]  sound like there's one company that's the problem no all of the machines are
[1:03:30.740 --> 1:03:35.220]  hacked because it's not just about dr. Frank another point there is that if you
[1:03:35.220 --> 1:03:39.060]  look at the specific software and this was a discussion yesterday this is a
[1:03:39.060 --> 1:03:44.540]  great discussion SQL management software that's installed SQL yeah so it's
[1:03:44.540 --> 1:03:50.060]  basically a database management program installed these equipment that's not
[1:03:50.060 --> 1:03:54.500]  authorized by the EAC but you don't even need to go into the dominion system or
[1:03:54.500 --> 1:03:58.700]  the ESNS machine the heart system you can go right to the server manipulate the
[1:03:58.700 --> 1:04:02.460]  data so that's really what they were showing in the in the little voting booth
[1:04:02.460 --> 1:04:07.900]  that hacker piece is an SQL manager and so it goes into the actual database
[1:04:07.900 --> 1:04:12.660]  changes it and pushes it back through the router and to make the change on the
[1:04:12.660 --> 1:04:18.220]  actual system so it's manipulating the database not necessarily the votes but
[1:04:18.220 --> 1:04:21.860]  it will make sure that at the server level all right so that's the type of
[1:04:21.860 --> 1:04:25.540]  stuff that's going on and these companies have said they're gonna sue anybody
[1:04:25.540 --> 1:04:28.780]  that carries any of it well I mean whether you agree with the info or not
[1:04:28.780 --> 1:04:31.660]  people have a right to hear this they have a right to report on it cover it so
[1:04:31.660 --> 1:04:36.940]  whatever happens happens we're all in to defend the Republic and dominion has
[1:04:36.940 --> 1:04:39.980]  been decertified a whole bunch of states states thought that they weren't a good
[1:04:39.980 --> 1:04:44.940]  system and so I think it's very legitimate what's going on up in Sioux
[1:04:44.940 --> 1:04:50.180]  Falls South Dakota and that's why we're covering it but regardless this is a
[1:04:50.180 --> 1:04:56.860]  fight that needs to happen as we say no to these hackable machines
[1:04:59.820 --> 1:05:04.260]  you've got amazing shoes amazing pillows towels sheets beds for humans
[1:05:04.260 --> 1:05:07.820]  beds for dogs beds for cats all amazing products at already very low prices

[1:05:23.340 --> 1:05:28.100]  dollars a set as low as $49.99 a set I took everything and just passed the
[1:05:28.100 --> 1:05:32.740]  savings on because we need support right now for what's going on myself I need
[1:05:32.740 --> 1:05:36.500]  this for the cyber symposium I just lost a million dollar week revenue by
[1:05:36.500 --> 1:05:39.980]  telling Fox you know what I'm not gonna succumb to your cancel culture we're
[1:05:39.980 --> 1:05:43.780]  gonna bring the word out on our own your best specials use the promo code
[1:05:43.780 --> 1:05:48.540]  Alex and you're supporting us getting the word out with Alex's great show
[1:05:48.540 --> 1:05:54.180]  implorers and you're supporting my pillow 2,500 employees and I haven't had
[1:05:54.180 --> 1:05:58.060]  to lay anybody off in spite of trying to be an attacking camp you're an example
[1:05:58.060 --> 1:06:01.340]  of recesses Mike Lindell Godspeed
[1:06:06.340 --> 1:06:16.820]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:06:16.820 --> 1:06:23.220]  all right I see so much positive news every day but I tend to only give you
[1:06:23.220 --> 1:06:28.700]  the bad news because the one thing I won't put up with my crew is them
[1:06:28.700 --> 1:06:32.180]  holding any bad news back for me and they're a great crew but I want to know
[1:06:32.180 --> 1:06:37.340]  bad news yesterday I don't want to know it later I want to see it up front I
[1:06:37.340 --> 1:06:45.860]  want to deal with it and so when I get up here I remember 15 years ago off
[1:06:45.860 --> 1:06:50.260]  record and I agreed to meet him off record I met with some globalist second
[1:06:50.260 --> 1:06:55.980]  tier well-known names right beneath the top people and they said Alex the same
[1:06:55.980 --> 1:06:59.060]  it's always the same speech don't you want to be a star instead of on a
[1:06:59.060 --> 1:07:04.460]  crusade you're gonna fail the public's dumb you know you'll never be able to
[1:07:04.460 --> 1:07:09.260]  save them don't you get when you put on all this bad news you just scare them
[1:07:09.260 --> 1:07:12.340]  and demoralize them they're a bunch of cowards they're not gonna rally and fight
[1:07:12.340 --> 1:07:18.340]  like you will you're our kind of people and I'm like really cuz you don't feel
[1:07:18.340 --> 1:07:22.500]  like my type of people I don't feel empowered close to God around you guys
[1:07:22.500 --> 1:07:28.940]  and I've told these people his face so I don't tell those stories like ooh the
[1:07:28.940 --> 1:07:33.940]  globalist tried to get me on their team they do that to everybody oh the devil
[1:07:33.940 --> 1:07:38.260]  tried to collect me and put me in his pocket oh I'm special no this happens
[1:07:38.260 --> 1:07:45.340]  to anybody that's prominent unless you were not awake and didn't know what was
[1:07:45.340 --> 1:07:50.380]  going on because you were naive then you get in the system like Saul of Tarsus
[1:07:50.380 --> 1:07:54.340]  on the road to Damascus and then you either wake up or you have that flash
[1:07:54.340 --> 1:08:00.060]  of light moment you have to wake up flash of light moment you can have the
[1:08:00.060 --> 1:08:03.900]  throughout your life see things learn things from family and understand how
[1:08:03.900 --> 1:08:07.100]  the world really works because of the blessing of being in a good family and
[1:08:07.100 --> 1:08:14.180]  you've been at the right place the right time like I did or you can be born into
[1:08:14.180 --> 1:08:17.220]  an evil family and evil system and know the truth from the beginning but decide
[1:08:17.220 --> 1:08:20.220]  to serve evil so there's those that serve evil from the beginning there's
[1:08:20.220 --> 1:08:23.940]  those that because they want power serve evil there are those that are ignorant
[1:08:23.940 --> 1:08:27.380]  and naive and buy into the corrupt system because they think it's actually
[1:08:27.380 --> 1:08:32.980]  good who wake up later then there's those of us that grow up in a family that
[1:08:32.980 --> 1:08:37.020]  knows what's going on and then see what's really happening and and and are
[1:08:37.020 --> 1:08:42.500]  part of a larger quest to defeat the system that I then later discovered it's
[1:08:42.500 --> 1:08:46.500]  not like some secret society or written rule or it's way beyond the devil system
[1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:53.660]  it's just it is and it's it's amazing but then they come to you and they try
[1:08:53.660 --> 1:09:03.780]  to get you to join with them and it's mind-blowing and the one thing they've
[1:09:03.780 --> 1:09:06.260]  told me over and over again because I've had at least six meetings with the
[1:09:06.260 --> 1:09:17.060]  globalist like a seven you count over the phone and hell I guess eight if you
[1:09:17.060 --> 1:09:21.940]  count the Atlantic monthly editor coming down here but that that's what
[1:09:21.940 --> 1:09:33.620]  that was too but but the reason this is important is they always say Alex you're
[1:09:33.620 --> 1:09:38.700]  just scaring them you think you're empowering them to fight back you're
[1:09:38.700 --> 1:09:45.100]  actually scaring them they're not gonna fight now and I I remember always
[1:09:45.100 --> 1:09:49.460]  saying I'm betting on humanity I think if people know how horrible this is
[1:09:49.460 --> 1:09:53.940]  they're going to wake up and decide to fight you instead of being slaves and
[1:09:53.940 --> 1:10:00.180]  being destroyed and see in that paradox is basically the universe people that
[1:10:00.180 --> 1:10:03.900]  believe in humanity and believe that want to face the truth and believe in
[1:10:03.900 --> 1:10:08.700]  making the world better and people that believe humanity's garbage and trash so
[1:10:08.700 --> 1:10:12.940]  you might as well treat them like trash and use them and destroy them because
[1:10:12.940 --> 1:10:16.380]  you could never build them up but you yourself has fallen too you're
[1:10:16.380 --> 1:10:20.340]  pretending you're doing all this evil to fill the place of evil but you're
[1:10:20.340 --> 1:10:24.380]  really moral and good when that's not what you're doing but that's the
[1:10:24.380 --> 1:10:33.780]  perspective of most of the Satanist and Luciferians and so I've always told you
[1:10:33.780 --> 1:10:40.940]  the very worst stuff going on because I believe if you know your neighbors being
[1:10:40.940 --> 1:10:45.740]  raped and killed in a basement you're gonna go try to save them at least call
[1:10:45.740 --> 1:10:51.740]  9-1-1 but see there's that process of domestication you don't go save the
[1:10:51.740 --> 1:10:58.180]  neighbor now you call 9-1-1 I mean I'm not looking for adventure I'm not
[1:10:58.180 --> 1:11:01.380]  looking for a fight but if I saw my neighbor being hit on the head with a
[1:11:01.380 --> 1:11:07.420]  pistol and drug into the house by robbers I'd call 9-1-1 I'd say the
[1:11:07.420 --> 1:11:11.500]  address maybe not cuz the cops probably come shoot me too now I probably would
[1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:15.580]  even call the cops I just get my shotgun or get my get my assault rifle I'd go
[1:11:15.580 --> 1:11:19.020]  over there and go to town on those people because it's the right thing to do
[1:11:19.020 --> 1:11:23.460]  it's what I'm designed to do I can't help it it's like water going downhill
[1:11:23.460 --> 1:11:30.180]  from the mountaintop to the sea it's on a mission you can't stop it and so the
[1:11:30.180 --> 1:11:33.940]  whole process of life is specializing people and putting you in this area or
[1:11:33.940 --> 1:11:39.460]  that area or I do this or I do that but I don't do this I don't do that until
[1:11:39.460 --> 1:11:49.020]  we're these domesticated jellyfish that just stand back and watch I've told the
[1:11:49.020 --> 1:11:52.380]  story many times I'll get into the positive news here today it's important
[1:11:52.380 --> 1:11:57.700]  to understand this and I'm not a hero I know the story it was easy I'm into a
[1:11:57.700 --> 1:12:04.660]  Madeline French restaurant not a fancy French restaurant it's like this chain
[1:12:04.660 --> 1:12:08.020]  of restaurants it's like almost fast food with decent food I think they've gone
[1:12:08.020 --> 1:12:10.180]  bankrupt or something they're not in Austin anymore I don't know why I'm
[1:12:10.180 --> 1:12:13.420]  telling that part of story so my brain works as table remember and I'm in there
[1:12:13.420 --> 1:12:23.260]  with my ex-wife and my son is like a year and a half old Rex and this woman
[1:12:23.260 --> 1:12:27.900]  this fat woman starts turning purple and choking well I'd gone to the bathroom
[1:12:27.900 --> 1:12:32.500]  and I come back out and my ex-wife wife at the time goes this woman's choking
[1:12:32.500 --> 1:12:37.140]  she's at this big table like six seven people she probably weighs 300 pounds
[1:12:37.140 --> 1:12:41.220]  probably five feet tall no one's helping her she's turning blue she's
[1:12:41.220 --> 1:12:47.860]  starting to fall the table and I walk over and I go to the Heimlich maneuver and
[1:12:47.860 --> 1:12:51.700]  they all look at me like I'm a space alien and back then I was in really good
[1:12:51.700 --> 1:12:55.620]  shape I could have picked layup over my head probably and I'm looking at these
[1:12:55.620 --> 1:12:59.740]  people and they're going 9-1-1 9-1-1 9-1-1 like parrots I mean they probably said
[1:12:59.740 --> 1:13:04.260]  20 9-1-1 9-1-1 and I'm just gonna get and I have skirt pushing my way they
[1:13:04.260 --> 1:13:07.700]  start going hey are you authorized hey what are you doing you don't know her
[1:13:07.700 --> 1:13:13.380]  hey what so I get her and I do a Heimlich twice and a huge piece of bread comes
[1:13:13.380 --> 1:13:20.820]  out of her mouth huge glob she was turned out she was down syndrome huge glob
[1:13:20.820 --> 1:13:23.860]  comes out so they don't care about their daughter their daughters and they're
[1:13:23.860 --> 1:13:29.380]  just feet half a freaking loaf of bread in her mouth and I'm smart in that I
[1:13:29.380 --> 1:13:34.140]  know rat-like people are I said well he was pretty fat I had to pick her up to
[1:13:34.140 --> 1:13:38.580]  get that bread out of her first time I didn't have a boom and I took a fire
[1:13:38.580 --> 1:13:45.380]  department training course I was like 13 on the swim team and they go oh thank
[1:13:45.380 --> 1:13:49.780]  you you're a hero oh oh and then I was right looking everyone is she hurt is
[1:13:49.780 --> 1:13:53.820]  she hurt and I got my ex-wife and I said let's get out of here because they
[1:13:53.820 --> 1:13:57.780]  would have sued me for saving her that's the spirit of the left they were
[1:13:57.780 --> 1:14:01.940]  gonna wait till she died the average cop comes in like 15 minutes the average
[1:14:01.940 --> 1:14:06.340]  ambulance about 50 minutes they were gonna let her die chirping and squawking
[1:14:06.340 --> 1:14:17.300]  9-1-1 9-1-1 9-1-1 9-1-1 9-1-1 9-1-1 9-1-1 9-1-1 9-1-1 9-1-1 and they're
[1:14:17.300 --> 1:14:21.900]  like they were having discussions on it well who's gonna call 9-1-1 so like 20
[1:14:21.900 --> 1:14:25.380]  seconds I'm like sitting there watching this happen and that's what's happened to
[1:14:25.380 --> 1:14:30.620]  America everybody just sits there like it's somebody else's job to do oh you
[1:14:30.620 --> 1:14:34.380]  don't want to save her because if you do you know you might break her rib I think
[1:14:34.380 --> 1:14:38.420]  I did feel a rib kind of go in a little bit hey it's better than that lady is
[1:14:38.420 --> 1:14:45.300]  alive with a broken rib than dead right but but the point is they don't want to
[1:14:45.300 --> 1:14:48.740]  save you they don't want to save me they don't want to help us and and they
[1:14:48.740 --> 1:14:52.500]  think you're gonna hear all this bad news and get in a fetal position but I
[1:14:52.500 --> 1:14:55.660]  know you're like me you're not gonna get in a fetal position here and all this
[1:14:55.660 --> 1:15:00.300]  you're gonna do something about it just like we built this organization thanks

[1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:12.140]  squabbling there's one thing almost everyone agrees on it's that immune
[1:17:12.140 --> 1:17:15.860]  system health can literally be the difference between life and death you
[1:17:15.860 --> 1:17:19.900]  probably already believe that I certainly do so here's the thing I wanted
[1:17:19.900 --> 1:17:24.140]  to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[1:17:24.140 --> 1:17:28.860]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support now you'll
[1:17:28.860 --> 1:17:32.500]  have to sign a waiver but you can check out what I've discovered at stronger
[1:17:32.500 --> 1:17:37.380]  defense dot com no cures or treatments there instead little known but shocking

[1:18:01.460 --> 1:18:04.940]  of cell phones all day long because they're super computers controlled by
[1:18:04.940 --> 1:18:08.740]  big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go what we do but because they
[1:18:08.740 --> 1:18:12.380]  have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate I
[1:18:12.380 --> 1:18:16.700]  still have one because this Trojan horse this Promethean fire has a lot of
[1:18:16.700 --> 1:18:21.100]  power but when I'm not using it I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage a

[1:18:58.220 --> 1:19:02.660]  now at infowarstore.com so when I first started taking survival skills
[1:19:02.660 --> 1:19:06.820]  basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you
[1:19:06.820 --> 1:19:11.020]  wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your
[1:19:11.020 --> 1:19:14.340]  show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival
[1:19:14.340 --> 1:19:18.260]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out
[1:19:18.260 --> 1:19:21.100]  with that too you had you know with a deep burden source you know and I got
[1:19:21.100 --> 1:19:25.060]  really excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain
[1:19:25.060 --> 1:19:30.340]  fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again
[1:19:30.340 --> 1:19:34.580]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[1:19:34.580 --> 1:19:38.100]  years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your
[1:19:38.100 --> 1:19:41.300]  supplements they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I
[1:19:41.300 --> 1:19:45.060]  like recently is knockout it literally like if you want to sleep just take it
[1:19:45.060 --> 1:19:48.900]  it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[1:19:48.900 --> 1:19:52.700]  we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to
[1:19:52.700 --> 1:19:56.860]  take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother I thank you
[1:19:56.860 --> 1:20:00.220]  so much for your call and Godspeed
[1:20:00.220 --> 1:20:07.500]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:31.220 --> 1:20:36.260]  all right we are back live I'm Alex Jones your host I'm about to give you
[1:20:36.260 --> 1:20:42.940]  the good news there is a lot of it but first stop before I play the clips the
[1:20:42.940 --> 1:20:51.060]  Pentagon press secretary has reversed the communist globalist thug Austin and
[1:20:51.060 --> 1:20:56.220]  Millie who's just as bad or worse and said oh no there'll be religious
[1:20:56.220 --> 1:20:59.900]  exemptions and medical exemptions of troops that don't want to take the
[1:20:59.900 --> 1:21:05.180]  experimental gene therapy injection so you see there's major pushback that's
[1:21:05.180 --> 1:21:11.020]  just one of like ten different positive pieces of news but first let me tell you
[1:21:11.020 --> 1:21:16.020]  what the real positive news is there are so many city council and county
[1:21:16.020 --> 1:21:20.940]  commissioner and school board and state house videos going viral despite what
[1:21:20.940 --> 1:21:24.740]  big tech of the chai comms the Democrats want that I could spend all day
[1:21:24.740 --> 1:21:30.580]  watching incredible eloquence and it's that action of you marching against the
[1:21:30.580 --> 1:21:37.540]  globalist of you taking action that is absolutely incredible and nothing is
[1:21:37.540 --> 1:21:44.300]  going to stop you keep doing it they try to make it hard to make you go sign up
[1:21:44.300 --> 1:21:48.220]  beforehand do all this crap just do it and go speak up and just get in the game
[1:21:48.220 --> 1:21:54.020]  so out of all the positive things that are happening I'm about to cover this
[1:21:54.020 --> 1:21:58.140]  lady I love it because they're coming with violence to assault us with
[1:21:58.140 --> 1:22:02.100]  experimental Nuremberg violating deadly poison that they know on record doesn't
[1:22:02.100 --> 1:22:06.020]  work destroys your immune system gives you blood clots and then sluffs and is
[1:22:06.020 --> 1:22:11.900]  causing the so-called covid cases mainline science says 95% of the new
[1:22:11.900 --> 1:22:16.620]  cases are of the vaccinated the deaths the vaccinated and they're calling it
[1:22:16.620 --> 1:22:19.900]  covid and they're giving it to other people which is what the top scientists
[1:22:19.900 --> 1:22:25.740]  warned so there's so many amazing moms and teachers and women kick and ask but
[1:22:25.740 --> 1:22:30.580]  this lady mom destroys county board of recovered restrictions masking vaccines
[1:22:30.580 --> 1:22:36.340]  this is Stephanie kinsley she does a great job at the Clark County board of
[1:22:36.340 --> 1:22:46.100]  commissioners here she is my name is Stephanie kinsley S-T-E-P-G-N-I-E-K-I-N-S-L-E-Y
[1:22:46.100 --> 1:22:51.740]  I was just I'm not even speaking to you guys anymore because you've all shown us
[1:22:51.740 --> 1:22:55.900]  that you're in somebody's pocket you can smirk all you want man if you're
[1:22:55.900 --> 1:23:01.540]  please okay for now when your people are pro but this is your this guy who just
[1:23:01.540 --> 1:23:05.860]  voted for these maps and now he won't learn them himself so we all know you're
[1:23:05.860 --> 1:23:11.460]  someone's pocket you used to be my uncle's neighbor and you're miss kinsley if
[1:23:11.460 --> 1:23:17.980]  I could ask you to please speak my car million dollars trying to figure out
[1:23:17.980 --> 1:23:22.080]  where all these missing children go how about that's more important than COVID
[1:23:22.080 --> 1:23:27.340]  which had kids have a ninety nine point nine nine five percent surviving yeah all
[1:23:27.340 --> 1:23:31.900]  the Democrats seem to be really favored if they're not killing babies through
[1:23:31.900 --> 1:23:37.700]  parenthood they're sticking needle in their arm we all late years they were
[1:23:37.700 --> 1:23:42.220]  the ninety nine percent people stop listening to these people this is to
[1:23:42.220 --> 1:23:46.300]  everyone watching stop listening to these people there's nothing different
[1:23:46.300 --> 1:23:50.900]  first until they prove to me that we had a valid election this is nothing more
[1:23:50.900 --> 1:23:57.580]  than a monarchy this country has a 100% success rate on taking down monarchy
[1:23:57.580 --> 1:24:02.260]  100% then we then look what happened in France after we get it we'll just get
[1:24:02.260 --> 1:24:08.380]  the whole ball rolling across the globe all over again yes 100% you guys know
[1:24:08.380 --> 1:24:13.300]  your line you know you're wrong and you can smirk and ignore us all you want
[1:24:13.300 --> 1:24:18.020]  play on your phones it doesn't take away the fact you know you're doing what you
[1:24:18.020 --> 1:24:21.300]  know you're doing wrong you know you're hurting kids and you're letting
[1:24:21.300 --> 1:24:25.300]  children suffer so everyone who's putting a map on their child and putting a
[1:24:25.300 --> 1:24:29.420]  needle in their child's arm to prevent them from dying from something they have
[1:24:29.420 --> 1:24:33.620]  no chance of dying from in the first place you're capitulating to tyrants
[1:24:33.620 --> 1:24:39.860]  you're acquiescing to fascists and this is gonna win in my favor you guys a
[1:24:39.860 --> 1:24:44.660]  hundred percent success rate on this side tyrants have a hundred percent
[1:24:44.660 --> 1:24:49.260]  failure rate in this country no matter what your little smurfs had to do about
[1:24:49.260 --> 1:24:54.980]  it we're the ones who put your brakes in your cars who makes your meals who
[1:24:54.980 --> 1:25:03.260]  gets your pharmacy we're everywhere that's exactly what Thomas Jefferson said
[1:25:03.260 --> 1:25:06.980]  so if you don't like her you don't like America that's a female Thomas Jefferson
[1:25:06.980 --> 1:25:11.020]  right there I guarantee she probably even read Jefferson but she instinctively
[1:25:11.020 --> 1:25:16.060]  gets it when the government fears the people there is liberty when the people
[1:25:16.060 --> 1:25:20.620]  fear the government there is tyranny and I don't need to make my bones these
[1:25:20.620 --> 1:25:24.620]  people I don't want to fight with the scum but you're starting one with us in
[1:25:24.620 --> 1:25:29.060]  your push in it and we know what you're gonna do you're gonna blow up a school
[1:25:29.060 --> 1:25:32.740]  shoot up something and blame it on us we already know that nobody's gonna buy it
[1:25:32.740 --> 1:25:38.060]  when you do it scumbags our targets aren't the police they're not innocent
[1:25:38.060 --> 1:25:42.340]  people in a federal building it's not the FBI it's not all that it our enemies
[1:25:42.340 --> 1:25:48.180]  are the ruling corrupt globalist class and we're not physically targeting
[1:25:48.180 --> 1:25:51.980]  anybody you're targeting us with an assault but we're pointing out that
[1:25:51.980 --> 1:25:56.700]  you're attacking us and the universe doesn't work that way for every action
[1:25:56.700 --> 1:26:04.220]  there is an opposite and equal reaction and I'm here as a warning sign to you
[1:26:04.220 --> 1:26:15.620]  this way death stop now stop now stop now you are in grave danger and I'm
[1:26:15.620 --> 1:26:18.860]  talking to the minions of Satan the actual servants of Satan know this and
[1:26:18.860 --> 1:26:21.940]  they've got a plan to destroy life and that's their mission and their sign
[1:26:21.940 --> 1:26:26.100]  on to it but for most the idiots because we tell you we've had like we had the
[1:26:26.100 --> 1:26:32.940]  head was like Cornell head chemist head of the chemistry department in front of
[1:26:32.940 --> 1:26:41.300]  UT Dr. Conn I think it was Cornell point is one of those top universities 10
[1:26:41.300 --> 1:26:44.860]  years ago and he comes with a Harvard studies about hydrofluorescent
[1:26:44.860 --> 1:26:51.340]  acid fluoride lowering IQ cancer and the city council laughed at him he came
[1:26:51.340 --> 1:26:55.100]  all the way here to speak for three minutes and they got up and laughed and
[1:26:55.100 --> 1:27:03.580]  walked out that I mean again because they get five million dollars a year in
[1:27:03.580 --> 1:27:07.780]  Austin from these big companies as subsidies to put that in our water why
[1:27:07.780 --> 1:27:11.540]  do they do that it's an attack on our fertility an attack on all of us and
[1:27:11.540 --> 1:27:16.500]  it's a sick joke to them it's their religion to assault us and assault us
[1:27:16.500 --> 1:27:20.540]  but if you tried to inject an Austin City Council member with fluoride and
[1:27:20.540 --> 1:27:23.940]  kill them they put you in a super max prison for it as a terrorist but when
[1:27:23.940 --> 1:27:28.700]  they put it in your water and it kills you slowly then it's funny isn't it I
[1:27:28.700 --> 1:27:32.860]  don't think anybody should hold down the mayor and inject him with hydrofluorescent
[1:27:32.860 --> 1:27:40.140]  acid he'd die in minutes I'm just saying stop slowly killing us too because the
[1:27:40.140 --> 1:27:45.180]  universe is gonna bite you in the ass all right the military coming out saying
[1:27:45.180 --> 1:27:50.740]  okay we need to have objections for medical reasons and others oh whoa whoa
[1:27:50.740 --> 1:27:55.220]  whoa whoa because commerce is like hey you can't do that that's illegal which it
[1:27:55.220 --> 1:28:00.100]  is all of this an experimental vaccine that's illegal but they're tricking us
[1:28:00.100 --> 1:28:04.900]  to do it now they're trying to bully us it's just pushing pushing pushing and
[1:28:04.900 --> 1:28:10.980]  now calling children murderers if they don't wear a mask they want to see if
[1:28:10.980 --> 1:28:13.940]  you'll let convicted pedophiles come out of Dracula in story time they want to see
[1:28:13.940 --> 1:28:17.180]  if they can call your children murderers they want to see if they can close the
[1:28:17.180 --> 1:28:20.900]  churches they want to see what they can get away with they want to trample you
[1:28:20.900 --> 1:28:25.700]  and train you and break you and condition you to be happy to go outside
[1:28:25.700 --> 1:28:30.660]  and show them a phone with a scanner so you can even go eat food someplace or
[1:28:30.660 --> 1:28:35.540]  have a job they want you on your knees do you think you're gonna be safer on
[1:28:35.540 --> 1:28:42.940]  your knees to these people or are you gonna be in a better place saying no to
[1:28:42.940 --> 1:28:52.180]  them now that's the question I'm asking you now living on your knees is the most
[1:28:52.180 --> 1:28:59.980]  dangerous place to be I choose on my feet in attack so many people say to me
[1:28:59.980 --> 1:29:05.380]  Alex please stop being so negative well for me admitting I've gotten a rotten
[1:29:05.380 --> 1:29:11.060]  tooth and going in a root canal is not negative it hurts it stinks it's got
[1:29:11.060 --> 1:29:14.740]  pus coming out of it I go to the doctor they fix it that's not negative I'm not
[1:29:14.740 --> 1:29:19.180]  living in denial and so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection
[1:29:19.180 --> 1:29:23.540]  that we feel yet but now it's come to the surface that's actually a positive
[1:29:23.540 --> 1:29:28.220]  thing and so yeah Trump did an overall a great job they stole the election we
[1:29:28.220 --> 1:29:34.420]  can't get down about that we have forced them out in the open so now they're
[1:29:34.420 --> 1:29:37.540]  trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed they're scared
[1:29:37.540 --> 1:29:41.440]  that's why instead of saying oh we're a bunch of losers look what happened no
[1:29:41.440 --> 1:29:45.060]  we're a bunch of winners they're trying to suppress us let our light of truth
[1:29:45.060 --> 1:29:49.340]  shine and tell everybody what's happening your own website your own show
[1:29:49.340 --> 1:29:53.900]  my show other articles other videos just keep sharing however you can and
[1:29:53.900 --> 1:29:57.580]  realize we're an information war we're gonna win this together and the fight
[1:29:57.580 --> 1:30:05.220]  starts them for us dot com there's one central fact of criminal psychology the
[1:30:05.220 --> 1:30:10.740]  criminologist all agree on and that it's criminals are extremely pathological
[1:30:10.740 --> 1:30:14.980]  even more the general public they do the same things over and over again and
[1:30:14.980 --> 1:30:20.660]  criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again well
[1:30:20.660 --> 1:30:27.060]  guess what it was Anthony Fauci and eugenicist globalist that ran the roll
[1:30:27.060 --> 1:30:31.140]  out of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that
[1:30:31.140 --> 1:30:34.860]  actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral
[1:30:34.860 --> 1:30:39.300]  research of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body
[1:30:39.300 --> 1:30:44.420]  and create autoimmune disorders the problem for them was the viruses would
[1:30:44.420 --> 1:30:49.300]  then break down and would be non-lethal down the road that's why they need to
[1:30:49.300 --> 1:30:53.100]  roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19
[1:30:53.100 --> 1:30:56.580]  vaccine destroys your immune system basically giving you the equivalent of
[1:30:56.580 --> 1:31:02.580]  HIV that's right ladies and gentlemen the ultimate fluoride free charcoal

[1:32:58.060 --> 1:33:01.540]  of recesses Mike Lindell Godspeed
[1:33:01.540 --> 1:33:19.700]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:31.540 --> 1:33:44.780]  everybody once lost is lost forever John Adams and that's why the chains are
[1:33:44.780 --> 1:33:49.140]  going on worldwide with these social credit scores and QR codes be able to
[1:33:49.140 --> 1:33:54.180]  go down the street or go to the grocery store it's here so this isn't a total
[1:33:54.180 --> 1:34:01.500]  and complete victory but it's a partial one in the press secretary a Kirby
[1:34:01.500 --> 1:34:06.740]  with a Pentagon saying soldiers with pre-existing conditions advice from
[1:34:06.740 --> 1:34:11.380]  doctors might not have to take the COVID vaccines they're trying to leave a
[1:34:11.380 --> 1:34:14.660]  little escape valve there for people they want to be able to keep in because
[1:34:14.660 --> 1:34:18.780]  the left's not taking this they want to use this to purge people they know are
[1:34:18.780 --> 1:34:25.180]  patriots out of the military services will make call on religious exemptions
[1:34:25.180 --> 1:34:30.940]  to COVID-19 vaccines but you just can't announce that you've got to have a
[1:34:30.940 --> 1:34:36.020]  member of the church you go to the preacher say that that is their stance
[1:34:36.020 --> 1:34:39.500]  in the Baptist church and all these groups you think are Christian even though
[1:34:39.500 --> 1:34:45.620]  this has fetal genomes in it the average so-called Baptist church won't even
[1:34:45.620 --> 1:34:48.620]  send that in for you or the Catholic Church tell the Pope says you should
[1:34:48.620 --> 1:34:52.380]  take it so those aren't real churches those are dens of devils but that is at
[1:34:52.380 --> 1:34:56.620]  least someone of a victory at one level here is the press secretary for the
[1:34:56.620 --> 1:35:01.940]  Pentagon if I can switch gears John this requirement in the military that
[1:35:01.940 --> 1:35:06.260]  everyone be vaccinated could you give me a timeline on that the secretary was
[1:35:06.260 --> 1:35:10.100]  clear and as message to the force yesterday Neil that that we're that
[1:35:10.100 --> 1:35:14.540]  we're going to be asking the president for a waiver to make these vaccines
[1:35:14.540 --> 1:35:20.460]  mandatory by mid-September unless FDA licensure comes first and of course then
[1:35:20.460 --> 1:35:24.780]  at that point the secretary has the authority once the FDA has approved the
[1:35:24.780 --> 1:35:28.020]  drugs to go ahead and make them mandatory for the troops so it's really a
[1:35:28.020 --> 1:35:34.620]  matter of weeks so if a soldier for whatever reason personal otherwise does
[1:35:34.620 --> 1:35:41.500]  not want to be vaccinated what happens well a member of the military who wants
[1:35:41.500 --> 1:35:44.980]  to claim a religious exemption can certainly do that there's a process for
[1:35:44.980 --> 1:35:49.700]  that it's not you know it's not a blanket check I mean you've got you've
[1:35:49.700 --> 1:35:54.420]  got to go through a process to get that approved troops who have a pre-existing
[1:35:54.420 --> 1:35:57.740]  medical conditions or on the vise of their physician might not have to take
[1:35:57.740 --> 1:36:01.260]  the vaccine but if you're just objecting because you're objecting once it's become
[1:36:01.260 --> 1:36:04.980]  mandatory that's a lawful order and our expectation is that you're going to obey
[1:36:04.980 --> 1:36:09.780]  that order nobody is looking for strong punitive disciplinary measures here
[1:36:09.780 --> 1:36:14.180]  frankly we believe that most troops will respond positively to the order just
[1:36:14.180 --> 1:36:17.740]  like they do and every other mission critical order that they're issued but
[1:36:17.740 --> 1:36:23.820]  there are enough tools it's not a lawful order he just said like he's a
[1:36:23.820 --> 1:36:29.420]  Supreme Court it's a lawful order and they use a Supreme Court ruling from
[1:36:29.420 --> 1:36:32.780]  over a hundred years ago to say it is but that ruling's been overturned by the
[1:36:32.780 --> 1:36:36.620]  Supreme Court since then the same order said they could sterilize poor black
[1:36:36.620 --> 1:36:44.820]  women Hitler use that order for what he did with the third Reich on record look
[1:36:44.820 --> 1:36:50.820]  up the Nuremberg trial so when you're informed it's crazy if he gets a waiver
[1:36:50.820 --> 1:36:54.780]  if the Secretary of Defense gets a waiver from the president a waiver of
[1:36:54.780 --> 1:37:00.660]  what federal law that you can't give experimental injections the troops and
[1:37:00.660 --> 1:37:03.780]  they keep calling it a vaccine everything coming out of the his mouth is a
[1:37:03.780 --> 1:37:12.140]  lie a vaccine is an attenuated bacteria or virus so that your body learns how
[1:37:12.140 --> 1:37:16.220]  to recognize an outside force without having to face a force that can
[1:37:16.220 --> 1:37:21.940]  replicate so that the next time it comes in the body immediately attacks it
[1:37:21.940 --> 1:37:27.180]  it's a real science it's got problems the shots can be contaminated if there's
[1:37:27.180 --> 1:37:34.460]  anything else in the shot your body will become allergic to that your body
[1:37:34.460 --> 1:37:38.980]  will attack that it'll have an autoimmune response to that but that's a
[1:37:38.980 --> 1:37:51.220]  real technology it's got problems this isn't a vaccine it is a GMO gene
[1:37:51.220 --> 1:37:57.740]  therapy and it's caused more side effects than all vaccines since they
[1:37:57.740 --> 1:38:04.060]  started the reporting system in the 1980s in a year less than a year this only
[1:38:04.060 --> 1:38:13.900]  started here seven months ago and the swathe of destruction is incredible so
[1:38:13.900 --> 1:38:17.580]  they can't even at this point make troops take it because the FDA hasn't
[1:38:17.580 --> 1:38:22.580]  approved it because they know they'll have no credibility ever again doing
[1:38:22.580 --> 1:38:27.540]  this this is a big deal they can't even get the agency they control to do it so
[1:38:27.540 --> 1:38:31.980]  they want to say look we made the troops now let's make five-year-olds in
[1:38:31.980 --> 1:38:37.060]  elementary skill one day it's the troops got to take an experimental shot now you
[1:38:37.060 --> 1:38:41.580]  know the old days it'd be a rabbit or a guinea pig or a rat or a pig or a cow now
[1:38:41.580 --> 1:38:47.860]  it's your troops now it's your children don't need to tell if we had real
[1:38:47.860 --> 1:38:50.820]  searches in this country they'd be organizing protest out front on the
[1:38:50.820 --> 1:38:53.860]  military bases they protect our troops they're not medical experiments
[1:38:53.860 --> 1:38:57.780]  they're not lab rats pointing out the vaccine doesn't protect you and it
[1:38:57.780 --> 1:39:01.620]  fountains a Chinese agent and that it's a foreign bio attack on America and that
[1:39:01.620 --> 1:39:06.340]  China won't even take the vaccine fountains produced or that India won't
[1:39:06.340 --> 1:39:11.940]  or the majority of people sick took the shot no because it's a Psyop and that's
[1:39:11.940 --> 1:39:17.460]  how a Psyop works to see what they can get away with what they can carry out
[1:39:17.460 --> 1:39:22.620]  against us because they need to depopulate us America is not part of the
[1:39:22.620 --> 1:39:27.060]  new world order America needs to be stunted and collapsed and poisoned so
[1:39:27.060 --> 1:39:30.500]  that we can be brought down to size to be folded into world government and they
[1:39:30.500 --> 1:39:33.900]  wouldn't do it because the nuclear weapons up front they got to do it
[1:39:33.900 --> 1:39:39.940]  covertly and that's what this is every checklist you go off of to break down the
[1:39:39.940 --> 1:39:45.460]  country to undermine it to bankrupt destroy it they're following it here's
[1:39:45.460 --> 1:39:49.580]  some more interesting news you in globalist arriving in UK for climate
[1:39:49.580 --> 1:39:54.540]  summit won't face COVID restrictions imposed on British citizens all other
[1:39:54.540 --> 1:39:58.220]  foreign travelers and citizens will be put in quarantine and controlled but

[1:40:08.300 --> 1:40:13.180]  good news Southwest Airlines American Airlines and Delta will not require
[1:40:13.180 --> 1:40:16.380]  employees to get faxed because the majority of them say they're gonna
[1:40:16.380 --> 1:40:22.180]  quit if we stand together this all goes away but if they ever get the majority
[1:40:22.180 --> 1:40:28.380]  then it's gonna collapse like dominoes so they're trying to get a vaccine
[1:40:28.380 --> 1:40:32.060]  passport to make flyers to do it but their own people in the White House
[1:40:32.060 --> 1:40:36.420]  won't take the shots and and the Pentagon brass won't take the shots

[1:44:02.380 --> 1:44:06.780]  275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was
[1:44:06.780 --> 1:44:10.900]  barely holding on to a job and I heard dr. group on your show and I listened to
[1:44:10.900 --> 1:44:14.740]  it so the first one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it
[1:44:14.740 --> 1:44:17.740]  worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too
[1:44:17.740 --> 1:44:20.580]  you have you know with a deeper source you know and I got really excited about
[1:44:20.580 --> 1:44:25.620]  that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally
[1:44:25.620 --> 1:44:30.380]  like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with
[1:44:30.380 --> 1:44:34.620]  people again and over the course of the next couple of years I got my health
[1:44:34.620 --> 1:44:38.100]  back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements there they're all

[1:47:36.260 --> 1:47:50.060]  I've been playing this song written by Dave Mustaine back in like 1989 or
[1:47:50.060 --> 1:47:59.820]  whatever it was 1988 even earlier a long time and here on air I've talked a
[1:47:59.820 --> 1:48:05.780]  lot about we'll come to that moment when the four horsemen come and knock him
[1:48:05.780 --> 1:48:12.220]  and here we are as they come for our children all of us with a deadly poison
[1:48:12.220 --> 1:48:17.180]  that makes our body attack itself and grows mad cow disease inside our bodies
[1:48:17.180 --> 1:48:22.220]  and even US senators that expose it or censored off the internet we just lay
[1:48:22.220 --> 1:48:28.100]  here and take it but not you not this audience you're an audience of activist
[1:48:28.100 --> 1:48:33.620]  men and women in the arena and I salute and I thank you all and I've got a lot
[1:48:33.620 --> 1:48:37.140]  of other critical news important information and I'm going to open the
[1:48:37.140 --> 1:48:42.740]  phones up in the next hour so we can hear from the forgotten that aren't
[1:48:42.740 --> 1:48:50.260]  supposed to be heard open phones for people to tell us their vaccine stories
[1:48:50.420 --> 1:48:55.460]  we'll load the phones with 20 or 30 callers they'll all tell you what happened
[1:48:55.460 --> 1:48:59.340]  with the vaccines and how horrible they were and maybe one leftist will sneak
[1:48:59.340 --> 1:49:04.060]  through and make jokes and laugh about it well how you laugh at your own people
[1:49:04.060 --> 1:49:09.580]  being attacked and killed like this while you laugh like a fool if you are a
[1:49:09.580 --> 1:49:19.820]  fool at your own destruction that's coming up as well separately you know I
[1:49:19.820 --> 1:49:22.700]  was thinking about something this morning I thought I ought to tell people a
[1:49:22.700 --> 1:49:34.340]  story but I can't because I had to sign an unisclosure to do it and I wish in
[1:49:34.340 --> 1:49:44.180]  hindsight I wouldn't have signed an unisclosure but let me just tell you
[1:49:44.180 --> 1:49:54.100]  this way I recently met with representatives of the globalist and
[1:49:54.100 --> 1:50:03.860]  they told me as if I didn't know this we are criminals like you know you seen
[1:50:03.860 --> 1:50:11.860]  the godfather movie we control things and our job is to destroy you and then I
[1:50:11.860 --> 1:50:19.060]  said well what is it you want and it was just like the James Bond movie I guess
[1:50:19.060 --> 1:50:25.500]  with Goldfinger you expect me to talk he goes no mr. Bond we expect you to die
[1:50:25.500 --> 1:50:31.540]  and I already know that but you have to understand they've converted way down
[1:50:31.540 --> 1:50:35.860]  low in the pyramid now this was pretty high up in it their own people were the
[1:50:35.860 --> 1:50:38.980]  average leftist knows they're depopulating they know they're gonna
[1:50:38.980 --> 1:50:43.020]  take over and sack the cities and take over your houses and businesses like
[1:50:43.020 --> 1:50:48.460]  Venezuela they are looking forward to that strutting around in your house
[1:50:48.460 --> 1:50:54.700]  demanding sex with your wife demanding your food demanding your business I mean
[1:50:54.700 --> 1:51:00.100]  that dog ain't gonna hunt here with 400 million firearms but they don't care
[1:51:00.100 --> 1:51:05.580]  because we've put up with it so far because discretion's the better part of
[1:51:05.580 --> 1:51:13.860]  valor as they say but talk about sticking your pecker in a light socket
[1:51:13.860 --> 1:51:22.180]  that's what they're doing so it's a very very very very dangerous time but
[1:51:22.180 --> 1:51:25.860]  they're like we're criminals we're gonna destroy you I'm like well you did you
[1:51:25.860 --> 1:51:39.580]  didn't think I knew that you met with me to tell me you're evil and then I like
[1:51:39.580 --> 1:51:42.660]  the like like like like these detractors out there that are little minions and
[1:51:42.660 --> 1:51:49.460]  don't know what's going on they attack us on senselessness this whole system
[1:51:49.460 --> 1:51:55.100]  Hollywood the left the dollar it's going bye bye this country is gonna be a death
[1:51:55.100 --> 1:52:01.100]  zone but the minions don't care about being destroyed they just want to
[1:52:01.100 --> 1:52:06.700]  imagine that they're the winners it's like a video game and they just know on
[1:52:06.700 --> 1:52:11.980]  Twitter or Facebook or YouTube or Google or Apple or wherever or Reddit if they
[1:52:11.980 --> 1:52:15.860]  attack America and attack truth and justice they just know they're allowed
[1:52:15.860 --> 1:52:20.180]  to post they're not even getting money or power they just want to alarm live
[1:52:20.180 --> 1:52:28.660]  action role play that they're in charge and they're not so this is a spiritual
[1:52:28.660 --> 1:52:33.820]  crisis and everybody knows it but I've got next hour we'll take your calls but
[1:52:33.820 --> 1:52:39.740]  also have just coming in today in Austin just where I live every five minutes
[1:52:39.740 --> 1:52:44.620]  they come in and give me a new article of another restaurant another hotel
[1:52:44.620 --> 1:52:51.940]  another wedding venue where you can't go if you're not injected with this poison
[1:52:51.940 --> 1:52:55.780]  they call a vaccine and if you don't accept this medical ID and because they
[1:52:55.780 --> 1:53:00.340]  say we want to keep everyone safe even though when you take the shot it makes
[1:53:00.340 --> 1:53:06.060]  you create mutants and makes you shed and and actually you're admittedly who's
[1:53:06.060 --> 1:53:09.740]  making everyone sick they don't care and guess what I looked at the business
[1:53:09.740 --> 1:53:17.060]  owners and I love women go to my house that's all there is my son's 18 he's
[1:53:17.060 --> 1:53:21.020]  moved out I'm sitting there with my wife and a bunch of women I should I hang
[1:53:21.020 --> 1:53:27.540]  out with women I love women but do you know who every person in Austin is
[1:53:27.540 --> 1:53:30.980]  shutting their business down unless you take a shot it's women who want to be
[1:53:30.980 --> 1:53:36.260]  impregnated psychically by Bill Gates it's and by Fauci and by Jeffrey Epstein
[1:53:36.260 --> 1:53:42.380]  what it is this is all Epstein plan and they just they want to have the foreign
[1:53:42.380 --> 1:53:46.820]  stuff put in them they want the dead baby DNA they want the jellyfish DNA they
[1:53:46.820 --> 1:53:51.060]  want the prions they're like it's a thrill to them because their dads were
[1:53:51.060 --> 1:53:55.100]  so nice to them their brothers were so nice they want a bad boy that'll slap
[1:53:55.100 --> 1:53:58.940]  around a little bit and they're gonna slap you around too and they're just
[1:53:58.940 --> 1:54:02.540]  turned over to Satan with a Jezebel spirit and it's a whole stack of women
[1:54:02.540 --> 1:54:09.980]  well good please please don't let me in your business please so I'll never give
[1:54:09.980 --> 1:54:18.380]  you I mean this is a good thing evil's trying to make us join it by raping us
[1:54:18.380 --> 1:54:24.380]  and trying to force it on us like oh we'll withdraw Target and Walmart we'll
[1:54:24.380 --> 1:54:30.060]  withdraw Amazon we'll withdraw the airplanes will withdraw if you don't
[1:54:30.060 --> 1:54:34.460]  take this poison because they're trying to make you get in bed with them
[1:54:34.460 --> 1:54:40.900]  genetically literally in your body spiritual to satanic rape and I'm like
[1:54:40.900 --> 1:54:45.180]  thank God you're telling me you want me to stick some dirty needle in me from
[1:54:45.180 --> 1:54:53.180]  some psychotic Bill Gates and Fauci I'm done good please and they want our
[1:54:53.180 --> 1:54:57.460]  children they want to wear masks they say they're murderers if they don't and
[1:54:57.460 --> 1:55:07.060]  they want us to let let them run every facet of our lives because that's it
[1:55:07.060 --> 1:55:10.940]  they're people that gave themselves over to rape they gave themselves over to
[1:55:10.940 --> 1:55:16.580]  globalist control and now they just think the Valhalla is coming I'm virtue
[1:55:16.580 --> 1:55:21.220]  signaling I've got the app I want you to show you've had this shot that doesn't
[1:55:21.220 --> 1:55:24.540]  protect you and then they'll just take more and more and more because they're
[1:55:24.540 --> 1:55:30.620]  spiritually dead and because they are wedded to the state they're the women
[1:55:30.620 --> 1:55:35.340]  they're the boss and the state told them women are the boss because the state
[1:55:35.340 --> 1:55:40.380]  targeted women knowing they're the most compliant so just like these wonderful
[1:55:40.380 --> 1:55:43.100]  women fighting back against tyranny and I'll play some clips of coming up next
[1:55:43.100 --> 1:55:49.100]  hour Hitler said first you get the women then you got the children so follow
[1:55:49.100 --> 1:55:54.220]  the men because 80% of advertising targets women it did then it does now
[1:55:54.220 --> 1:55:57.340]  because men do what women want and children do what women want we love
[1:55:57.340 --> 1:56:02.660]  women but if the state can come in and get that relationship with your wife or
[1:56:02.660 --> 1:56:07.140]  girlfriend they got everything and they want us all dead I'm gonna go to break

[1:59:08.020 --> 1:59:12.900]  announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the

[1:59:51.220 --> 2:00:02.740]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:14.500 --> 2:00:18.780]  all right I'm gonna give the number out and hit all the big news coming up next
[2:00:18.780 --> 2:00:22.380]  segment but here's part of the special report a desperate message from the real
[2:00:22.380 --> 2:00:28.620]  medical community there is a clear message that is coming through this is
[2:00:28.620 --> 2:00:34.060]  becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated scientific evidence experts say proves
[2:00:34.060 --> 2:00:39.740]  fully vaccinated people are protected in two ways essentially vaccines block you
[2:00:39.740 --> 2:00:46.060]  from getting and giving the virus I want to be clear while vaccinated people
[2:00:46.060 --> 2:00:50.380]  can spread the virus if they get a breakthrough infection the fact that
[2:00:50.380 --> 2:00:56.100]  vaccinated people who do have a breakthrough infection are clearly
[2:00:56.100 --> 2:01:01.540]  capable of transmitting the infection to an uninfected person why are the
[2:01:01.540 --> 2:01:05.220]  doctors not here in the brief room to take our questions you know what kill
[2:01:05.220 --> 2:01:10.460]  you I would I would argue that we had the president of the United States speak
[2:01:10.460 --> 2:01:15.220]  to this yesterday he gave a more than 30 minute speech about where we are as a
[2:01:15.220 --> 2:01:22.380]  country I mean he is a trusted voice he's the leader of our country no but we
[2:01:22.380 --> 2:01:25.700]  heard from him right we heard from the president yesterday we heard from the
[2:01:25.700 --> 2:01:31.780]  president about the Delta variant and vaccinations in general we have roughly
[2:01:31.780 --> 2:01:40.540]  350 million people vaccinated United States I'm actually quite proud of the
[2:01:40.540 --> 2:01:46.220]  medical services from Europe the United States Canada Australia New Zealand
[2:01:46.220 --> 2:01:53.900]  Africa Latin America Eastern Europe Russia the vast majority of the people
[2:01:53.900 --> 2:01:57.900]  speaking up who are doctors and scientists and epidemiologists and nurses
[2:01:57.900 --> 2:02:01.900]  are saying the vaccines don't work and are killing most people and the
[2:02:01.900 --> 2:02:06.900]  statistics show that I'm a Mayo Clinic trained board certified pathologist
[2:02:06.900 --> 2:02:10.940]  board certified in anatomic and clinical pathology so yes I have expertise in
[2:02:10.940 --> 2:02:15.100]  immunology and virology this is where we are right now so does that look like a
[2:02:15.100 --> 2:02:19.980]  pandemic it was it's not anymore we're in an endemic now statistically the
[2:02:19.980 --> 2:02:25.180]  pandemic is over in Idaho you statistically once we're below a set
[2:02:25.180 --> 2:02:29.420]  percentage we are not in a pandemic right now is the disease present sure it
[2:02:29.420 --> 2:02:34.580]  is is it widespread no you know we're still doing maybe 500 to 600 patient tests
[2:02:34.580 --> 2:02:39.780]  a day at most we're seeing 2% per day right now and so the numbers are going
[2:02:39.780 --> 2:02:43.420]  way down there's numbers are still high in a few states but we're getting past
[2:02:43.420 --> 2:02:47.940]  that point and here's why coronavirus is are seasonal they follow a six to nine
[2:02:47.940 --> 2:02:51.580]  month life cycle and no matter what we do they're going to do what they do and
[2:02:51.580 --> 2:02:55.020]  then they're going to fade what happened to SARS what happened to MERS what
[2:02:55.020 --> 2:03:00.460]  would what did we do to stop them nothing they did their thing average
[2:03:00.460 --> 2:03:06.820]  COVID-19 death age 78.6 average age of death in North America every year 78.6
[2:03:06.820 --> 2:03:13.900]  what are our highest risk factors obesity low vitamin D levels advanced age
[2:03:13.900 --> 2:03:19.020]  90% of deaths in the state have been over 70 years of age that's the at-risk
[2:03:19.020 --> 2:03:23.180]  population we have stopped our society for something that's taking people that
[2:03:23.180 --> 2:03:27.780]  are already at that death risk age anyway the virus is fragile these are just a
[2:03:27.780 --> 2:03:31.740]  little tidbits it's fragile it doesn't live outside UV light fractionates it
[2:03:31.740 --> 2:03:36.780]  kills it blows it apart ventilation in the wind blows it away it is insanity to
[2:03:36.780 --> 2:03:44.460]  wear a mask outside it is absolutely and that's and that's science that science
[2:03:44.460 --> 2:03:48.460]  there is not one study that has shown any super spreader event to have occurred
[2:03:48.460 --> 2:03:53.020]  outside they have all been indoors with poor ventilation I just think that we're
[2:03:53.020 --> 2:03:56.500]  kidding ourselves if we think kids wearing mask helps it probably even
[2:03:56.500 --> 2:04:00.860]  makes it worse you should also know that no vaccine even the ones I support and
[2:04:00.860 --> 2:04:06.700]  would give to myself and my children ever stops infection in 2014 there was
[2:04:06.700 --> 2:04:10.260]  outbreak of mumps in the national hockey league the only people who came down the
[2:04:10.260 --> 2:04:13.420]  symptoms with the people who are unvaccinated or unknown vaccine status
[2:04:13.420 --> 2:04:16.420]  boy that sounds like a great argument for vaccines but a question that you
[2:04:16.420 --> 2:04:19.420]  should ask yourself knowing that half of the people who came down with
[2:04:19.420 --> 2:04:24.540]  symptomatic disease had no contact with an unvaccinated or unknown vaccine
[2:04:24.540 --> 2:04:30.100]  status individual where did they get the disease and the answer was from the
[2:04:30.100 --> 2:04:34.940]  vaccinated individuals no vaccine prevents you from getting infection you
[2:04:34.940 --> 2:04:39.340]  get infected you shed pathogen this is especially true of viral respiratory
[2:04:39.340 --> 2:04:44.100]  pathogens you just don't get symptomatic from it so you cannot stop spread you
[2:04:44.100 --> 2:04:47.340]  cannot make these numbers that you've planned on get better by doing any of
[2:04:47.340 --> 2:04:50.860]  the things you're doing because that is the nature of viral respiratory
[2:04:50.860 --> 2:04:54.940]  pathogens and you can't prevent it with a vaccine because they don't do the very
[2:04:54.940 --> 2:05:02.020]  thing you're wanting them to do I have gotten so many requests and so many
[2:05:02.020 --> 2:05:06.260]  complaints from listeners in the last six plus months of where is the activated

[2:06:26.020 --> 2:06:30.900]  your calls ladies and gentlemen well we have a lot of chilling developments I'm
[2:06:30.900 --> 2:06:33.220]  talking about positive things that have been happening I'll get more into that
[2:06:33.220 --> 2:06:38.100]  in a second but you've seen a puppet Biden come out yesterday and say I may
[2:06:38.100 --> 2:06:42.820]  issue national mandates on mask I may issue national mandates on stay at
[2:06:42.820 --> 2:06:46.900]  home all that same kind of crap this is the day from our sources they were
[2:06:46.900 --> 2:06:50.180]  looking at doing it I said they're looking at doing it I did not say they
[2:06:50.180 --> 2:06:53.860]  would do it today in fact talking about it backs them off because they don't want
[2:06:53.860 --> 2:07:00.140]  to legitimize what we're saying so I love to basically put them off balance
[2:07:00.140 --> 2:07:07.700]  this is out of Fox News judge grants Dallas County authority to issue mask
[2:07:07.700 --> 2:07:12.980]  mandates in defiance of Governor Abbott's order so now we have these petty
[2:07:12.980 --> 2:07:17.900]  judges in the blue cities every major city in Texas is now Democrat control
[2:07:17.900 --> 2:07:22.420]  judge grants Dallas County that's the county Dallas is in like where I'm from
[2:07:22.420 --> 2:07:27.420]  where I was born the authority to issue mass mandates in defiance of Governor
[2:07:27.420 --> 2:07:33.140]  Abbott's order a Dallas judge has ordered Greg Abbott's ban on mass mandates
[2:07:33.140 --> 2:07:40.300]  does not help combat the pandemic to the judge is a doctor now a Dallas judge
[2:07:40.300 --> 2:07:44.460]  has ruled Governor Abbott's ban on mass mandates does not help combat the
[2:07:44.460 --> 2:07:49.580]  pandemic it grants Dallas County the authority at least for now to go ahead
[2:07:49.580 --> 2:07:54.660]  and defy the governor's order to require mass which do nothing the group of
[2:07:54.660 --> 2:07:58.380]  Texas parents is fighting to give school districts the power to issue mass
[2:07:58.380 --> 2:08:02.580]  mandates yeah you got the other parents want your kid wearing a mask that
[2:08:02.580 --> 2:08:07.060]  psychologically totally screws them up Dallas County judge Clay Jenkins
[2:08:07.060 --> 2:08:11.980]  declares he has the authority as well that guy's always pushing BLM crap you
[2:08:11.980 --> 2:08:15.220]  name it the power struggle between state and local governments continued
[2:08:15.220 --> 2:08:20.580]  inside Dallas County civil court Tuesday and judge Tanya Parker's courtroom
[2:08:20.580 --> 2:08:27.900]  these are the same judges that have been shutting down people that cut hair for a
[2:08:27.900 --> 2:08:33.100]  year they're going bankrupt you're not essential Walmart they're open the
[2:08:33.100 --> 2:08:37.660]  grocery store is open the power companies open the hospitals open you're
[2:08:37.660 --> 2:08:41.220]  not essential people don't need to have their hair done you just need to go
[2:08:41.220 --> 2:08:46.660]  bankrupt and shut up and lose your house and live on the street meanwhile
[2:08:46.660 --> 2:08:49.340]  talk about the abuse of children let's hit this right now and I'll give the
[2:08:49.340 --> 2:08:56.540]  number up the left is always targeted children it's what they do it's what
[2:08:56.540 --> 2:09:00.740]  they're obsessed with they are predators that want our life force than
[2:09:00.740 --> 2:09:05.860]  want our future but if they can't abort them in the mother they want to try to
[2:09:05.860 --> 2:09:09.100]  poison them and dump them down culturally and then get them to cut their
[2:09:09.100 --> 2:09:14.700]  genitals off their breasts off with a transgender transhumanist agenda that
[2:09:14.700 --> 2:09:21.300]  statistically causes the highest levels of disease and suicide but here it is
[2:09:21.300 --> 2:09:29.380]  out of Axios CDC urges pregnant people to get vaccinated against COVID-19 it's
[2:09:29.380 --> 2:09:36.300]  not authorized for anybody it's an emergency injection and they can't even
[2:09:36.300 --> 2:09:46.700]  get it authorized from the FDA for the military or under 12th so they go hey
[2:09:46.700 --> 2:09:51.020]  we don't count a baby inside the womb as a human we urge women to take this
[2:09:51.020 --> 2:09:56.900]  even though it's a genetic therapy and in a New England Journal of Medicine
[2:09:56.900 --> 2:10:09.260]  studying 80 plus percent of the women who were in the first trimester who took
[2:10:09.260 --> 2:10:16.260]  the shot of the GMO lost their baby now you think about diabolical evil they
[2:10:16.260 --> 2:10:20.380]  are seeing us as animals seeing us as overpopulated they're pretending like
[2:10:20.380 --> 2:10:24.420]  they're a superclass above us a new species of globalist or like aliens they
[2:10:24.420 --> 2:10:30.620]  think and they're gonna order us to kill our babies and in call our children

[2:10:47.820 --> 2:10:51.900]  Democrats are calling for it to be considered premeditated murder not to
[2:10:51.900 --> 2:10:57.540]  wear a mask who never think they come up with something like this so nonsensical
[2:10:57.540 --> 2:11:04.220]  but that's how the psyops behavioral psychologists run all of this 80% of
[2:11:04.220 --> 2:11:06.860]  pregnant women who got vaccinated for COVID during first second

[2:11:30.220 --> 2:11:33.500]  important part of child development however kids aren't socializing as much
[2:11:33.500 --> 2:11:37.540]  through the pandemic they mean the made-up fearmongering which doctors say
[2:11:37.540 --> 2:11:43.540]  is leading to concerning outcomes we've seen language delays oh language
[2:11:43.540 --> 2:11:49.220]  delays and more social anxiety inability of a child to leave their parent or go

[2:12:41.700 --> 2:12:49.020]  mutants and new viruses so they came up with a mutated virus which they basically
[2:12:49.020 --> 2:12:53.260]  created an autoimmune response to the body it programs the body to make the
[2:12:53.260 --> 2:12:56.820]  virus and they claim that's a counter even though all the scientists went
[2:12:56.820 --> 2:13:01.740]  that'll actually kill everybody they went shut up Google doesn't let you talk

[2:17:59.340 --> 2:18:04.540]  so when I first started taking survival skills basically I was 275 pounds
[2:18:04.540 --> 2:18:08.500]  overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding
[2:18:08.500 --> 2:18:12.300]  on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it so the
[2:18:12.300 --> 2:18:15.940]  first one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked
[2:18:15.940 --> 2:18:19.300]  pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too you had you
[2:18:19.300 --> 2:18:22.140]  know with a deep burden source you know and I got really excited about that so I
[2:18:22.140 --> 2:18:27.100]  took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my
[2:18:27.100 --> 2:18:31.780]  brain was enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with people
[2:18:31.780 --> 2:18:35.860]  again and over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back
[2:18:35.860 --> 2:18:39.100]  and I religiously take basically all of your supplements there they're all
[2:18:39.100 --> 2:18:43.620]  absolutely amazing supplements the one I like recently is knockout literally like
[2:18:43.620 --> 2:18:47.260]  if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point
[2:18:47.260 --> 2:18:51.500]  is we have to get ourselves clean that's a break free of the globalist system and
[2:18:51.500 --> 2:18:54.940]  the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand.
[2:18:54.940 --> 2:18:59.180]  Beautifully said brother I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[2:18:59.180 --> 2:19:04.940]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by
[2:19:04.940 --> 2:19:09.260]  the lies we are told and the only way to see through this illusion is with our
[2:19:09.260 --> 2:19:14.780]  higher senses which is why fluoridated water is a big problem. Consuming too much
[2:19:14.780 --> 2:19:19.460]  fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its
[2:19:19.460 --> 2:19:24.140]  natural functions natural functions which have been known for millennia. The
[2:19:24.140 --> 2:19:27.900]  Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system the chakra aligned with the
[2:19:27.900 --> 2:19:32.980]  pineal gland is the third eye also described as the seat of the soul the
[2:19:32.980 --> 2:19:36.860]  pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and
[2:19:36.860 --> 2:19:42.660]  otherwise unseen dimensions of reality. Fluoride free water is essential to
[2:19:42.660 --> 2:19:47.900]  keeping our pineal gland healthy. Our water filtration systems with the proper
[2:19:47.900 --> 2:19:52.860]  filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the propure shower head
[2:19:52.860 --> 2:20:03.940]  will seal the deal. Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com.
[2:20:03.940 --> 2:20:07.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:16.020 --> 2:20:21.580]  Well in about seven seconds most telephones and cable TV radio systems
[2:20:21.580 --> 2:20:29.700]  will be taken over by FEMA and president Joe Biden in a martial law drill. That's
[2:20:29.700 --> 2:20:41.780]  1220. Yep so folks tell us what you see tell us what you see unfolding and going
[2:20:41.780 --> 2:20:45.020]  on but maybe he's gonna postpone it they did announce all these big
[2:20:45.020 --> 2:20:49.020]  announcements for today they have the White House ready for it but a lot of
[2:20:49.020 --> 2:20:54.740]  politicians are 20 30 minutes late so we'll watch that as it all unfolds. I
[2:20:54.740 --> 2:20:59.100]  love this graphic I love this meme I'm sure Twitter will ban it because you're
[2:20:59.100 --> 2:21:04.460]  not allowed to criticize the takeover but it's a man looking at an old-fashioned
[2:21:04.460 --> 2:21:08.500]  box strap the type I would use to catch birds and squirrels just as I thought it
[2:21:08.500 --> 2:21:12.420]  was cool I let him go once we did it when I was a child and you just put a rope to
[2:21:12.420 --> 2:21:17.460]  it hide in the shed hide the tent hide behind the bushes the squirrel or
[2:21:17.460 --> 2:21:21.660]  rabbit or bird gets in there you pull the stick and it falls on them well it's
[2:21:21.660 --> 2:21:26.100]  his freedom pass does he want to climb under there and do that I mean this is
[2:21:26.100 --> 2:21:35.060]  ridiculously obvious this is a total takeover let's play this Pentagon clip
[2:21:35.060 --> 2:21:42.460]  first I remember again in mainline Pentagon documents 25 years ago about
[2:21:42.460 --> 2:21:45.900]  we've been tasked by DARPA and the Rockefeller Foundation as well as the
[2:21:45.900 --> 2:21:50.420]  Carnegie Foundation to end war to end war we must end the family and the human
[2:21:50.420 --> 2:21:55.500]  mammal dynamic we have a plan to put humans in tanks from birth with virtual
[2:21:55.500 --> 2:21:58.940]  reality once computer systems are up to that level where people will live in
[2:21:58.940 --> 2:22:02.220]  peace and we'll be able to have a mainframe computer that guides them
[2:22:02.220 --> 2:22:06.860]  through life and the power of their own heat will run the computers that was a
[2:22:06.860 --> 2:22:12.180]  theoretical DARPA plan from the 1977 they made the movie The Matrix out of it
[2:22:12.180 --> 2:22:17.060]  yep they're doing the EAS right now so I guess they've national periodic test
[2:22:17.060 --> 2:22:25.100]  EAS emergency alert system there it is it's taking over keep keep keep going
[2:22:25.100 --> 2:22:30.620]  with it oh that's right the engineers are telling us oh no we can't air the
[2:22:30.620 --> 2:22:36.580]  tones if we air the tones that can take over the scramblers of the radio
[2:22:36.580 --> 2:22:41.980]  station but that's not the tones that's the old system that would launch tones
[2:22:41.980 --> 2:22:47.420]  to take over the radio or TV station now they don't need the tones because
[2:22:47.420 --> 2:22:51.260]  they're hardwired and everything but I won't explain it to the engineers anyways
[2:22:51.260 --> 2:22:56.860]  the point is is that it is that we're you can show the image of it I don't know
[2:22:56.860 --> 2:23:01.220]  who told you you can't show that but that's not the case mad at anybody but
[2:23:01.220 --> 2:23:04.900]  my god what a broke back country we can't even show you the emergency alert
[2:23:04.900 --> 2:23:09.220]  okay it doesn't exist right now but I mean I'm walking off at this point I
[2:23:09.220 --> 2:23:14.140]  mean I it's like I live in a twilight zone it's like a year and a half ago
[2:23:14.140 --> 2:23:18.700]  during the lockdown I told you it's all BS we're an essential company we can
[2:23:18.700 --> 2:23:23.860]  stay open no one believe me took me weeks to convince anybody of it not mad I'm
[2:23:23.860 --> 2:23:27.980]  not mad let's go rebroadcast though what do we got here what do we got here am I
[2:23:27.980 --> 2:23:32.860]  allowed to show a video off this of my show am I allowed to be on air
[2:23:32.860 --> 2:23:40.300]  probably not nothing's allowed I'm so free Rand Paul can't talk no one can talk
[2:23:40.300 --> 2:23:43.660]  air with everyone
[2:23:45.460 --> 2:23:51.220]  attempts to divert while King Obama attempts to divert the public from
[2:23:51.220 --> 2:23:55.700]  interrupting his sophisticated celebration of elitists flaunting their
[2:23:55.700 --> 2:24:00.940]  disregard of their own totalitarian COVID orders upon the peasants this is
[2:24:00.940 --> 2:24:05.460]  going to be safe this is a sophisticated vaccinated crowd and and this is just
[2:24:05.460 --> 2:24:09.980]  about optics it's not about safety and the bewildered compromise puppets sleepy
[2:24:09.980 --> 2:24:15.100]  Joe can't even manage to remember the amount of people he supposedly presides
[2:24:15.100 --> 2:24:23.140]  over we have roughly 350 million people vaccinating the United States 350
[2:24:23.140 --> 2:24:29.380]  million people vaccinated in the United States Joe the population is only 330
[2:24:29.380 --> 2:24:35.700]  million and Dr. Gain of Fauci continues to recklessly lead the spin on what will
[2:24:35.700 --> 2:24:40.900]  amount to a violation of the Nuremberg code of astronomical proportions two
[2:24:40.900 --> 2:24:44.020]  things you do with children who are non-vaccinated and that's the
[2:24:44.020 --> 2:24:49.020]  recommendation you surround them with those who can be vaccinated whoever
[2:24:49.020 --> 2:24:54.540]  they are teachers personnel in the school anyone get them vaccinated so
[2:24:54.540 --> 2:24:58.380]  protect the kids with a shield of vaccinated people for the kids who can't
[2:24:58.380 --> 2:25:03.980]  get vaccinated that's the reason why we're having a strong recommendation
[2:25:03.980 --> 2:25:07.980]  that in the schools everybody should wear a mask whether or not you are
[2:25:07.980 --> 2:25:13.140]  vaccinated the vaccine lie continues to float to the surface in countries where
[2:25:13.140 --> 2:25:18.260]  the majority of the public is vaccinated yet COVID is spreading through the
[2:25:18.260 --> 2:25:24.620]  vaccinated masses like wildfire Iceland's chief epidemiologist admitted that the
[2:25:24.620 --> 2:25:30.020]  only way possible to achieve herd immunity is for the virus to infect 70 to
[2:25:30.020 --> 2:25:35.180]  80 percent of the population and that natural immunity must replace the failed
[2:25:35.180 --> 2:25:40.460]  measures of the vaccines by increasing hospital capacity and tightening border
[2:25:40.460 --> 2:25:45.980]  restriction the majority of Iceland is vaccinated yet the vaccinated continue
[2:25:45.980 --> 2:25:51.140]  to be infected in Denmark the state's serum Institute Denmark's infectious
[2:25:51.140 --> 2:25:56.060]  disease agency has said it no longer believes it will be possible to achieve
[2:25:56.060 --> 2:26:00.860]  herd immunity through vaccination implying that COVID-19 could circulate
[2:26:00.860 --> 2:26:05.780]  for years to come but the authorities will not listen to the science instead
[2:26:05.780 --> 2:26:11.020]  preferring totalitarian lockdown measures which will incubate and increase
[2:26:11.020 --> 2:26:16.140]  the spread UK's travel minister has declared that vaccines will be required
[2:26:16.140 --> 2:26:21.580]  to travel forever more while London's globalist mayor Sadiq Khan wants to
[2:26:21.580 --> 2:26:26.620]  make traveling on a train unmasked illegal and Australia will lock down
[2:26:26.620 --> 2:26:31.900]  any citizen returning from abroad Western civilization is under full blown
[2:26:31.900 --> 2:26:37.100]  assault by a totalitarian soft-kill weapon dominated by the submissive whims
[2:26:37.100 --> 2:26:42.500]  of owned politicians what videos has zero knowledge of science egg dawn by
[2:26:42.500 --> 2:26:47.300]  propaganda new vaccine mandates are being rolled out across the country
[2:26:47.300 --> 2:26:56.660]  by some school officials they're considering vaccine mandates to enact
[2:26:56.660 --> 2:27:02.820]  a compulsory mandatory vaccination law he's an advocate for a vaccine mandate
[2:27:02.820 --> 2:27:07.140]  for all school employees while also pushing for mandatory masks for
[2:27:07.140 --> 2:27:12.260]  children unmasked mandates and vaccine mandates we've got to push that as a
[2:27:12.260 --> 2:27:17.420]  requirement to make sure that we know who is vaccinated every day more
[2:27:17.420 --> 2:27:21.500]  businesses are implementing their own vaccine mandates the only way forward is
[2:27:21.500 --> 2:27:26.180]  to shut down the border and give center stage to the doctors fighting to break
[2:27:26.180 --> 2:27:30.020]  through the censorship I'm actually a functional family medicine physician
[2:27:30.020 --> 2:27:33.380]  that means I am specially trained in immunology and inflammation regulation
[2:27:33.380 --> 2:27:36.980]  and everything being recommended by the CDC and the state board of health is
[2:27:36.980 --> 2:27:40.580]  actually contrary to all the rules of science so things you should know about
[2:27:40.580 --> 2:27:44.020]  coronavirus and all other respiratory viruses they are spread by aerosol
[2:27:44.020 --> 2:27:46.980]  particles which are small enough to go through every mask and I would hope this
[2:27:46.980 --> 2:27:51.420]  board would start asking itself before it considers taking the advice of the CDC
[2:27:51.420 --> 2:27:55.660]  the NIH and the state board of health why we are doing things about this that we
[2:27:55.660 --> 2:27:59.900]  didn't do for the common cold influenza or respiratory syncytial virus and then
[2:27:59.900 --> 2:28:04.220]  ask yourself why is a vaccine that is supposedly so effective having a
[2:28:04.220 --> 2:28:08.500]  breakout in the middle of the summer when respiratory viral syndromes don't do
[2:28:08.500 --> 2:28:12.060]  that and to help you understand that you need to know the condition that is
[2:28:12.060 --> 2:28:15.940]  called antibody mediated viral enhancement that is a condition done
[2:28:15.940 --> 2:28:20.940]  when vaccines work wrong as they did in every coronavirus study done in animals
[2:28:20.940 --> 2:28:26.340]  on coronaviruses after the SARS outbreak and done in respiratory
[2:28:26.340 --> 2:28:31.940]  syncytial virus where a vaccine used in a venerable individual done the wrong way
[2:28:31.940 --> 2:28:35.580]  which why it cannot be done right for a respiratory virus which has a very low
[2:28:35.580 --> 2:28:39.620]  pathogenicity rate causes the immune system to actually fight the virus wrong
[2:28:39.620 --> 2:28:45.380]  and let the virus become worse than it would with native infection and that is
[2:28:45.380 --> 2:28:50.420]  why you're seeing an outbreak right now 75% of people who had COVID-19 positive
[2:28:50.420 --> 2:28:56.300]  symptom cases in Barnstable, Massachusetts outbreak were fully vaccinated it's
[2:28:56.300 --> 2:29:00.180]  time for us to resist they can't arrest all if you're concerned about the power
[2:29:00.180 --> 2:29:04.980]  grid and all of your kids own supply of off-grid electricity this will be the
[2:29:04.980 --> 2:29:09.620]  most important message you'll hear this year here's why we now have a small
[2:29:09.620 --> 2:29:14.060]  number of solar generators back in stock these emergency backup systems
[2:29:14.060 --> 2:29:18.220]  provide a life-saving backup power when you need it most and unlike gas
[2:29:18.220 --> 2:29:23.380]  generators solar generators run quietly emit no dangerous fumes and produce an
[2:29:23.380 --> 2:29:28.100]  endless supply of free electricity from the Sun whether it's wildfires dangerous
[2:29:28.100 --> 2:29:32.260]  weather power grid issues or just getting off the grid you'll never have to
[2:29:32.260 --> 2:29:36.940]  suffer through painful power outages again even better all this week radio
[2:29:36.940 --> 2:29:42.220]  listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses to go to my solar

[2:30:44.820 --> 2:30:47.180]  designed on one of the top guys in the country he didn't want his name on it
[2:30:47.180 --> 2:30:49.900]  because obviously the political issues but we had to pay a lot of money for this
[2:30:49.900 --> 2:30:53.540]  formulation just for the design of it and we believe it is the best strongest
[2:30:53.540 --> 2:30:56.980]  but healthiest energy out there and you're saying that it's made your life

[2:33:02.340 --> 2:33:07.660]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:07.660 --> 2:33:24.020]  there's a man going round taking names and he decides who to free and who to
[2:33:24.020 --> 2:33:33.100]  blame everybody won't be treated all the same there'll be a golden letter
[2:33:33.100 --> 2:33:42.580]  reaching down when the man comes around all right ladies and gentlemen we are
[2:33:42.580 --> 2:33:47.700]  back live I'm gonna take your phone calls on your arm we'll stand up first I
[2:33:47.700 --> 2:33:51.740]  want to air this because I talked about airing it quite a bit today the Pentagon
[2:33:51.740 --> 2:33:58.540]  is back out announcing that they want implantable microchips to stop COVID and
[2:33:58.540 --> 2:34:04.140]  digital passports to buy and sell to stop COVID and none of it has anything to do
[2:34:04.140 --> 2:34:17.500]  with stopping COVID so here's KL KTLA in California the biggest TV station out
[2:34:17.500 --> 2:34:23.940]  there saying how cool it is sort of cool but you're gonna have this bio chip in
[2:34:23.940 --> 2:34:34.620]  you that is going to monitor and track and control you for the system and you've
[2:34:34.620 --> 2:34:38.220]  already seen this on 60 minutes but that's where all this goes Klaus Schwab
[2:34:38.220 --> 2:34:42.060]  said this is the end game none of this has to do with freedom we all know that
[2:34:42.060 --> 2:34:46.740]  and how do you get sheep who are being targeted by this to figure it out you
[2:34:46.740 --> 2:34:50.940]  can say well screw the sheep let him get destroyed they're gonna be used as
[2:34:50.940 --> 2:34:57.740]  weapons against us so to save ourselves we got to save them here it is this is
[2:34:57.740 --> 2:35:02.020]  sort of cool scientists at the Pentagon are developing a microchip that can
[2:35:02.020 --> 2:35:07.340]  detect viruses in the blood including COVID-19 the chip would be inserted just
[2:35:07.340 --> 2:35:12.300]  under the skin and alert the user if the coronavirus is present I knew it the
[2:35:12.300 --> 2:35:17.620]  military has not said I knew it was coming has been deployed and you see how
[2:35:17.620 --> 2:35:22.900]  that works oh you can either have all the deadly shots we want to give you every
[2:35:22.900 --> 2:35:28.660]  month or you can do a PCR test it's a fraud or have a microchip in you all
[2:35:28.660 --> 2:35:32.620]  the time but there'll be another chip when we need the chip in your brain to
[2:35:32.620 --> 2:35:39.060]  always more with these psychos and you've got endless people it'll take a
[2:35:39.060 --> 2:35:43.980]  paycheck to get up there on these panel shows make it look like it's normal but
[2:35:43.980 --> 2:35:51.700]  none of this is normal I was watching CNN clip this morning they're like yes
[2:35:51.700 --> 2:35:56.100]  it's like drunk driving it's like you're terrorist if you don't wear a mask and
[2:35:56.100 --> 2:35:59.940]  the next are children terrorists coming up and they have all the whole panel go
[2:35:59.940 --> 2:36:05.460]  well they are terrorists see you're learning how you're a terrorist now
[2:36:05.460 --> 2:36:16.060]  wear the mask the symbol of slavery it's just too much isn't it and now into the
[2:36:16.060 --> 2:36:20.700]  communist takeover program that will go to your calls Virginia teacher resigns
[2:36:20.700 --> 2:36:24.860]  after ordered to snitch on the centers of Oak agenda what do you think the
[2:36:24.860 --> 2:36:29.980]  Pentagon is now the military what is a white supremacist they're pro-gun they're
[2:36:29.980 --> 2:36:34.860]  pro-america same thing here oh did somebody in school criticize hearing that
[2:36:34.860 --> 2:36:39.380]  white people are inherently evil and that communism's good well let's suspend
[2:36:39.380 --> 2:36:44.500]  them just like senator Paul suspended off YouTube why he said the mask don't
[2:36:44.500 --> 2:37:08.100]  work which is on the box of the mask let's hear from teacher Laura Morris
[2:37:08.100 --> 2:37:14.780]  Valerie political ideologies that do not square I am as a believer in Christ after
[2:37:14.780 --> 2:37:18.620]  reading about the lack of consideration for the growing population of concern
[2:37:18.620 --> 2:37:23.260]  citizens in this division clearly evidence by this empty room tonight where
[2:37:23.260 --> 2:37:27.740]  you shut the doors to the public as well as the emails sent by the superintendent
[2:37:27.740 --> 2:37:33.540]  last year reminding me that a dissenting opinion is not allowed even to be spoken
[2:37:33.540 --> 2:37:38.340]  in my personal life going so far as to send it forward to my colleagues and I am
[2:37:38.340 --> 2:37:41.540]  encouraging us to fill it out if we hear one another speaking against the
[2:37:41.540 --> 2:37:45.500]  controversial policies being promoted by this school board and adopted in this
[2:37:45.500 --> 2:37:50.460]  county not only that but within the last year I was told in one of my so-called
[2:37:50.460 --> 2:37:55.180]  equity trainings that white Christian able-bodied females currently have the
[2:37:55.180 --> 2:38:00.380]  power in our schools and that quote this has to change clearly you've made your
[2:38:00.380 --> 2:38:04.380]  point you no longer value me or many other teachers you've employed in this
[2:38:04.380 --> 2:38:09.820]  county so since my contract outlines the power that you have over my employment
[2:38:09.820 --> 2:38:14.060]  in my public school I thought it necessary to resign in front of you
[2:38:14.060 --> 2:38:19.860]  school board I quit I quit your policy I quit your training and I quit being a
[2:38:19.860 --> 2:38:24.820]  cock in a machine that tells me to push highly politicized agendas on our most
[2:38:24.820 --> 2:38:31.020]  vulnerable and children I will find employment elsewhere I encourage all
[2:38:31.020 --> 2:38:38.020]  parents and staff in this county to flood the private schools and that's who
[2:38:38.020 --> 2:38:43.020]  they are Bill Gates the UN their control of everything the mayors most the
[2:38:43.020 --> 2:38:47.260]  police departments the schools they're attacking the police because they're not
[2:38:47.260 --> 2:38:53.100]  in full control the average officer yet this isn't a takeover coming this is a
[2:38:53.100 --> 2:38:59.420]  takeover happening now I want to go to Bruno I want to go to Josh Oliver Joe
[2:38:59.420 --> 2:39:06.620]  Cody Dana George Carlos and Trish please don't thank me I love you too let's just
[2:39:06.620 --> 2:39:10.180]  get to the next person we won't have time for these calls let's go ahead and
[2:39:10.180 --> 2:39:15.420]  talk to Bruno in Florida thanks for calling her on the air hey Alex I'm
[2:39:15.420 --> 2:39:20.660]  here in Florida I thought I was saved from the mass mandate my daughter is
[2:39:20.660 --> 2:39:27.380]  going to a Christian private school and on Friday last Friday I got an email and
[2:39:27.380 --> 2:39:36.020]  the school a Christian private school decided to mandate the mask back indoor
[2:39:36.020 --> 2:39:43.420]  I'm devastated I whenever I heard the news of school board going wanting to put
[2:39:43.420 --> 2:39:48.780]  the mask back on our kids again I was I was relaxed about it because I thought
[2:39:48.780 --> 2:39:51.900]  okay my daughter is going to a Christian private school it's never gonna
[2:39:51.900 --> 2:39:56.100]  happen there and it just so happened and we are here in Florida and that's after
[2:39:56.100 --> 2:40:01.980]  the order from our governor the census prohibiting the schools to but the
[2:40:01.980 --> 2:40:06.220]  cities and counties and the Democrats and the corporations are saying no it's
[2:40:06.220 --> 2:40:12.860]  about power isn't it it is and just so you know I talked to the lower principal
[2:40:12.860 --> 2:40:18.620]  personal not personally through email and she told me that the decision came
[2:40:18.620 --> 2:40:24.900]  from the Florida council of independent schools and then if you keep asking like
[2:40:24.900 --> 2:40:29.300]  they'll do most of most of the staff members in the school they don't do not
[2:40:29.300 --> 2:40:33.540]  agree with this decision and they tell me that you was the board the school board
[2:40:33.540 --> 2:40:39.620]  and then I asked her can I meet these people can I offer some arguments well
[2:40:39.620 --> 2:40:43.860]  that's it they've got lawyers that scare by a lawsuit that run the councils the
[2:40:43.860 --> 2:40:47.500]  control people through terror you just go talk to school and say listen let's all
[2:40:47.500 --> 2:40:52.660]  just quietly ignore this they'll send out email six by in a communist takeover
[2:40:52.660 --> 2:40:56.140]  everybody has to start ignoring it or they're gonna win I think this the answer
[2:40:56.140 --> 2:41:01.780]  is just quietly get the school to not enforce it yeah I was fortunate enough
[2:41:01.780 --> 2:41:05.860]  to be able to get a note from my from my daughter's doctors saying that she
[2:41:05.860 --> 2:41:10.060]  does not require to a mess my daughter thank God is not wearing a mask but it
[2:41:10.060 --> 2:41:14.740]  hurts my heart to see all these little children four-year-olds with masks on
[2:41:14.740 --> 2:41:19.780]  most of them wearing their the cloth mask then no you just said it it hurts my
[2:41:19.780 --> 2:41:24.780]  heart and as a man I can tell you're a man you're not a violent person but but
[2:41:24.780 --> 2:41:28.060]  as a man when you know they're hurting children doesn't it make you as a man
[2:41:28.060 --> 2:41:32.420]  think about how we're supposed to help these children yes it does and and I'm
[2:41:32.420 --> 2:41:36.660]  trying to be effective I'm gonna get involved into the school try to wake up
[2:41:36.660 --> 2:41:40.900]  these people like these parents that willingly will cover their their
[2:41:40.900 --> 2:41:45.700]  child's face makes no sense to me why would you do and you to take them the
[2:41:45.700 --> 2:41:49.220]  major studies it makes the children think they're dirty and bad and ugly and
[2:41:49.220 --> 2:41:54.820]  screws them up bad and makes them unhealthy yes sir but for some reason all
[2:41:54.820 --> 2:41:59.260]  these Christians I Alex and let me tell you something Alex I came from Brazil
[2:41:59.260 --> 2:42:05.220]  Brazil was a great country fifty seven years ago the culture was destroyed by

[2:42:29.180 --> 2:42:34.140]  successful Brazilians are not patriotic people and they're trying to do the same

[2:47:30.860 --> 2:47:35.620]  last week he was on for an hour and he had this big Pfizer whistleblower on it
[2:47:35.620 --> 2:47:39.700]  was blood curdling last time I checked that interviews got 800,000 views on
[2:47:39.700 --> 2:47:44.180]  Band-Aid video on top of the millions that watched it here so look forward to
[2:47:44.180 --> 2:47:50.260]  Dr. Kaufman next hour but I get frustrated because I've covered 20% of
[2:47:50.260 --> 2:47:54.180]  what I was ready to cover and a lot of it's my fault not getting to it all so
[2:47:54.180 --> 2:47:58.660]  I'm co-host of the war with Owen Schroyer today 3 p.m. Central after the
[2:47:58.660 --> 2:48:02.340]  next hour I called out when he wants me on we're gonna do it let me just show
[2:48:02.340 --> 2:48:07.860]  you this real quick this is a cool thing we made Rob do about a week ago two
[2:48:07.860 --> 2:48:13.060]  weeks ago said hey my buddy is in Pennsylvania he said a gas pump look at
[2:48:13.060 --> 2:48:17.580]  this info war sticker this is an actual photo I can't believe that the key the
[2:48:17.580 --> 2:48:24.100]  way they got keyed it looks so almost fake but but that's we've got the photo of
[2:48:24.100 --> 2:48:28.620]  the guy that had keyed this trying to get it off of a gas bomb and we took a
[2:48:28.620 --> 2:48:32.020]  photo of it and now the bumper stickers that's one of the new stickers we throw
[2:48:32.020 --> 2:48:38.020]  in every order is the what are we calling it the punished info or sticker
[2:48:38.020 --> 2:48:45.740]  and that is a blow-up of the real photo so there you go that's that's kind of
[2:48:45.740 --> 2:48:48.980]  weird stuff around here I think it turned out pretty cool except the
[2:48:48.980 --> 2:48:53.500]  scrape marks almost look artificial like but that that's the actual that's how
[2:48:53.500 --> 2:49:00.420]  the person scratches the key did so that's that piece of information by the
[2:49:00.420 --> 2:49:06.020]  way the toothpaste is back in stock the charcoal activated charcoal with real
[2:49:06.020 --> 2:49:09.940]  peppermint so good for your teeth has no additives that has no fillers my dad a

[2:49:30.780 --> 2:49:36.500]  welcome you say your niece was faxed many years ago without parents knowing
[2:49:36.500 --> 2:49:41.620]  yeah we've seen hundreds of cases in Texas Alabama New York areas of Europe
[2:49:41.620 --> 2:49:46.100]  where decades ago they were injecting children without telling parents they
[2:49:46.100 --> 2:49:50.100]  got caught doing in Australia wide last month and the health minister said big
[2:49:50.100 --> 2:49:56.180]  deal get over it go ahead right well here's the thing this Jones they my
[2:49:56.180 --> 2:50:00.020]  niece said that they separated the boys from the girls she didn't see the boys
[2:50:00.020 --> 2:50:07.420]  but it's all girls at the school and when she went home her arm was sore and my
[2:50:07.420 --> 2:50:11.580]  brother you know what's wrong with your arm and she told him that they had
[2:50:11.580 --> 2:50:17.060]  vaccinated her and not to tell him so he immediately called the police went to
[2:50:17.060 --> 2:50:23.340]  the school he was told to wait outside he got the police go into the school they
[2:50:23.340 --> 2:50:29.340]  come back out tell my brother is now out in the school and they leave I mean
[2:50:29.340 --> 2:50:34.540]  just plain as that I mean it's you know we done what we done don't worry about it
[2:50:34.540 --> 2:50:41.100]  who cares that's exactly what they said in Australia they said get over it big
[2:50:41.100 --> 2:50:47.380]  deal right right fortunately for him you know my brother was an army ranger so
[2:50:47.380 --> 2:50:51.580]  he's calm and cool collective he's collected the nurses names of people
[2:50:51.580 --> 2:50:56.820]  that were involved in this yeah I don't he's called lawyers to no avail none
[2:50:56.820 --> 2:51:00.620]  of them would return his call so I guess well listen I misread the screen I
[2:51:00.620 --> 2:51:03.940]  thought it happened 12 years ago you're saying she's 12 years old this just
[2:51:03.940 --> 2:51:12.820]  happened in Dayton Ohio so this just happened in Dayton Ohio yes he doesn't
[2:51:12.820 --> 2:51:17.460]  catering but Dayton Ohio and they're just they're not gonna do anything about it
[2:51:17.460 --> 2:51:21.700]  yeah well that's that's attempted I mean that's a criminal Nuremberg violation
[2:51:21.700 --> 2:51:25.060]  wow I would love to get your name and number and try to get your brother on
[2:51:25.060 --> 2:51:30.100]  so to walk through this because I read the screen wrong and I apologize
[2:51:30.100 --> 2:51:34.420]  what did they inject her with the sheet they said don't tell your parents I mean
[2:51:34.420 --> 2:51:39.100]  think about how criminal these people are right right and it was her and her
[2:51:39.100 --> 2:51:45.780]  best friend as she says like 25 30 girls only girls not boys that she they may
[2:51:45.780 --> 2:51:50.620]  have done the boys in a different area but this is only the girls don't tell
[2:51:50.620 --> 2:51:54.580]  your parents they gave her the shot and now she's having an issue with her eyes
[2:51:54.580 --> 2:51:58.620]  tight I guess in her left eye no I bet sir I want to get your name a number I
[2:51:58.620 --> 2:52:03.740]  want to come to Ohio can you get me in touch with your brother absolutely damn
[2:52:03.740 --> 2:52:07.660]  right it's time to pick a place and make a stand those are damn criminals in
[2:52:07.660 --> 2:52:11.140]  there that's equivalent of rape I mean they literally put genetic material into
[2:52:11.140 --> 2:52:19.020]  her without the consent of her parents or her yes yes and you know like I said
[2:52:19.020 --> 2:52:24.180]  he's very patient and you know he's sweet to see what's gonna if anybody's
[2:52:24.180 --> 2:52:29.260]  going to help them if not then you know he has to at least have to you know well
[2:52:29.260 --> 2:52:32.700]  he needs to file a lawsuit against them and get them all in deposition so this
[2:52:32.700 --> 2:52:36.180]  is a criminal organization a criminal group but they've been caught all the
[2:52:36.180 --> 2:52:40.140]  world doing it California passed a law to inject well than up without parental
[2:52:40.140 --> 2:52:43.100]  consent yeah there it is North Carolina is not
[2:52:43.100 --> 2:52:48.820]  required political consent for COVID-19 vaccine but some providers do what so you
[2:52:48.820 --> 2:52:53.380]  can't sell liquor have sex with a kid you can't sell them a real estate policy
[2:52:53.380 --> 2:52:57.100]  you can't sell them an insurance policy because they're not at the age of
[2:52:57.100 --> 2:53:04.300]  consent but North Carolina put that back up probably not even true but the
[2:53:04.300 --> 2:53:09.460]  state can shoot kids up without consent that's bull man God this is a revolution
[2:53:09.460 --> 2:53:14.340]  against everything we built George I'm gonna put you on hold give me your name
[2:53:14.340 --> 2:53:19.780]  a number I want to talk to your brother okay that's follow that up I'm sure it's
[2:53:19.780 --> 2:53:27.380]  true I mean this is just unbelievable the state wants your children the state
[2:53:27.380 --> 2:53:33.780]  is globalist run that's Georgia Nevada's brothers in Ohio Carlos in Canada
[2:53:33.780 --> 2:53:38.940]  frequent caller Carlos what is your take on the situation thank you Alex well
[2:53:38.940 --> 2:53:48.700]  what we have here is a sophisticated more evil because mr. I guess Fauci has
[2:53:48.700 --> 2:53:56.780]  gone full full Monty on everybody on this one there is an article on Spiegel
[2:53:56.780 --> 2:54:03.220]  online March 12th 2010 and they did a review and I am certain that Spiegel is
[2:54:03.220 --> 2:54:09.380]  now doing a review on this one on this pandemic this reconstruction of a mass
[2:54:09.380 --> 2:54:16.020]  hysteria the swine flu pandemic of 2009 and what it basically says is that when
[2:54:16.020 --> 2:54:22.620]  the swine flu emerged in 2009 the World Health Organization officials estimated
[2:54:22.620 --> 2:54:28.700]  that between two and seven point four million could die of the H1N1 the
[2:54:28.700 --> 2:54:35.580]  panic that ensued mounted worldwide as it turns out it was a dot but there were
[2:54:35.580 --> 2:54:41.740]  companies like Tamiflu produced Tamiflu this company was Gilead Sciences if
[2:54:41.740 --> 2:54:47.580]  a familiar name in the current pandemic and the German magazine the Spiegel
[2:54:47.580 --> 2:54:53.300]  that the analysis of this reconstruction of the hysteria and wrote that in May
[2:54:53.300 --> 2:55:00.660]  bit May 9 2009 about three weeks before this one flu was declared the pandemic
[2:55:00.660 --> 2:55:05.740]  30 senior representatives of pharmaceutical companies met with
[2:55:05.740 --> 2:55:10.740]  World Health Organization director General Chen and United Nations
[2:55:10.740 --> 2:55:16.020]  Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had who had borders the vaccine industry was
[2:55:16.020 --> 2:55:22.220]  mainly interested in one question the decision to declare phase six what was
[2:55:22.220 --> 2:55:28.300]  phase six phase six acted as a switch that would allow bells on the industry's
[2:55:28.300 --> 2:55:33.860]  cash registers to ring risk-free because many pandemic vaccine contracts had
[2:55:33.860 --> 2:55:37.740]  already been signed Germany for example signed an agreement with British
[2:55:37.740 --> 2:55:42.580]  firm Glaxo Smith Klein sure once they declare the pandemic which it wasn't
[2:55:42.580 --> 2:55:48.660]  then everybody has to buy the product exactly that was 2009 my province of
[2:55:48.660 --> 2:55:56.140]  Quebec bought two billion dollars worth of Tamiflu from Gilead Sciences who was
[2:55:56.140 --> 2:56:05.700]  behind Gilead Sciences Donald Rumsfeld who purchased Gilead Sciences thereafter
[2:56:05.700 --> 2:56:15.660]  George Soros in March 2020 2019 actually I began to do research in 2020 I call
[2:56:15.660 --> 2:56:20.700]  your program mentioning Wuxi and mentioning all of these same players in
[2:56:20.700 --> 2:56:26.660]  this new pandemic and now we see what is going on I recently took the time to
[2:56:26.660 --> 2:56:32.980]  read the reset book by Carl Schwab and there you see that they've picked it
[2:56:32.980 --> 2:56:40.740]  back an economic agenda and on top of that agenda is a the Rothschild agenda
[2:56:40.740 --> 2:56:47.260]  to revamp the whole financial system so you're gonna have this pandemic and then
[2:56:47.260 --> 2:56:53.180]  you're gonna see a reset not only in the in the work environment with robotics and
[2:56:53.180 --> 2:56:58.660]  g5 and so on but you're going to see an economic collapse and that is what is
[2:56:58.660 --> 2:57:02.380]  really being done all under their control conditions because what they want to do
[2:57:02.380 --> 2:57:06.020]  is to protect their wealth never mind the rest of the world that's right they've
[2:57:06.020 --> 2:57:09.300]  set up a scam and at the end of their Ponzi scheme instead of going to jail
[2:57:09.300 --> 2:57:13.060]  like Bernie Madoff we all become their slaves we get locked in our houses and
[2:57:13.060 --> 2:57:17.020]  we become prisoners under COVID hysteria and the average leftist does it because
[2:57:17.020 --> 2:57:20.740]  they like to sit at home and watch Netflix for free even though soon they'll
[2:57:20.740 --> 2:57:23.900]  have no job and be starving to death beautifully said Carlos all right

[2:58:52.460 --> 2:58:56.580]  basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you
[2:58:56.580 --> 2:59:00.780]  wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Grip on your
[2:59:00.780 --> 2:59:04.100]  show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival
[2:59:04.100 --> 2:59:08.060]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out
[2:59:08.060 --> 2:59:10.860]  with that too you have you know with a deep burden source you know and I got
[2:59:10.860 --> 2:59:14.840]  really excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain
[2:59:14.840 --> 2:59:20.100]  fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again
[2:59:20.100 --> 2:59:24.300]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[2:59:24.300 --> 2:59:27.860]  years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your
[2:59:27.860 --> 2:59:31.260]  supplements there they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I like
[2:59:31.260 --> 2:59:34.980]  recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's
[2:59:34.980 --> 2:59:38.660]  amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[2:59:38.660 --> 2:59:42.460]  that's a break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to
[2:59:42.460 --> 2:59:46.780]  take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother I thank you so
[2:59:46.780 --> 2:59:56.900]  much your call and Godspeed you're listening to the Alex Jones show

[3:00:29.260 --> 3:00:33.140]  calls and get them in there let's go ahead and talk to Oliver and pencil
[3:00:33.140 --> 3:00:39.300]  Vangio thanks for holding well I teacher in May of this year take the first
[3:00:39.300 --> 3:00:46.900]  shot of the Moderna vaccine and then two weeks later she got the second shot two
[3:00:46.900 --> 3:00:53.620]  days later she was full blood clots and dead I had a cousin take the Moderna
[3:00:53.620 --> 3:01:01.100]  shot she didn't take the second shot because the first shot made her heart
[3:01:01.100 --> 3:01:05.740]  for five days feel like it was coming out of her chest she wised up she didn't
[3:01:05.740 --> 3:01:10.820]  do it she's still alive I use the religious exemption for my children in
[3:01:10.820 --> 3:01:16.620]  school in Pennsylvania here it works every time some dough needles in my kids
[3:01:16.620 --> 3:01:23.020]  that's it the new world order is gone for the kill shot on us I know it I feel
[3:01:23.020 --> 3:01:27.460]  it but we're gonna beat them well that's the thing sir I don't just have the
[3:01:27.460 --> 3:01:31.660]  VAERS reporting I don't just have all the documents I know a bunch of people
[3:01:31.660 --> 3:01:34.700]  who died or had heart attacks when they took it including young people and then
[3:01:34.700 --> 3:01:37.540]  I run into people on the street everywhere telling me the same thing I
[3:01:37.540 --> 3:01:43.420]  mean they are killing us this is insane and they're just normalizing it to test
[3:01:43.420 --> 3:01:48.140]  to see if they can give quote booster shots that Israel says are killing even
[3:01:48.140 --> 3:01:52.860]  more people because every time we don't resist they just up the attack they're
[3:01:52.860 --> 3:01:58.220]  going for the Georgia guide stones right now people wake up Oliver let me ask you
[3:01:58.220 --> 3:02:02.540]  this did the local school teachers family wake up when she died my daughter
[3:02:02.540 --> 3:02:08.660]  talked to her stepdaughter on Facebook and she says yes my stepmom died from
[3:02:08.660 --> 3:02:13.700]  the vaccine she was healthy she's 41 years old she she paid softball still
[3:02:13.700 --> 3:02:19.340]  it didn't smoke didn't drink you know so boom after the second shot two days
[3:02:19.340 --> 3:02:25.460]  later at rush to the hospital couldn't walk full blood clots dead it's a shame
[3:02:25.460 --> 3:02:29.660]  they're going it's a shame brother they killed her and they did it through people
[3:02:29.660 --> 3:02:32.900]  that thought they were heroes it's all been scripted it's all a behavioral
[3:02:32.900 --> 3:02:36.940]  psychologist wargame but there's good psychologists and people fighting back
[3:02:36.940 --> 3:02:40.100]  on the other side one of the psychiatrists he's coming up thank you so
[3:02:40.100 --> 3:02:43.460]  much Oliver god bless you I hear the pain in your voice I know how real it is
[3:02:43.460 --> 3:02:47.100]  believe me I've had losses as well I have a family member took one shot that's
[3:02:47.100 --> 3:02:50.580]  super sick hasn't taken the next shot yet but won't talk to me now because they
[3:02:50.580 --> 3:02:55.380]  don't want to be wrong it's it's weird pigheadedness Joe in Indiana then Cody
[3:02:55.380 --> 3:03:00.940]  and Trish welcome Joe hey Alex I was going I just wanted to make too quick
[3:03:00.940 --> 3:03:06.540]  real point you know how do they go and make you know a distinguished change
[3:03:06.540 --> 3:03:11.020]  the thing distinguished between the the first variant of Delta variant you know
[3:03:11.020 --> 3:03:15.100]  you can't test which one which is ridiculous people need to wake up that
[3:03:15.100 --> 3:03:18.140]  they admit they're just turning up computers to find whatever they want
[3:03:18.140 --> 3:03:23.100]  it's total bull it's like you can have dead silence in a room with soundproofing
[3:03:23.100 --> 3:03:28.860]  no sound you can turn a microphone up until it finally hears sound and does
[3:03:28.860 --> 3:03:32.660]  feedback and that's they set it for what they want and then they turn it up till
[3:03:32.660 --> 3:03:37.500]  it finds it one thing Alex I should want to say when people when you want to
[3:03:37.500 --> 3:03:40.740]  make a difference you hear people out in society talking about it
[3:03:40.740 --> 3:03:45.660]  there's that simple fact out to them about that besides the fact that the
[3:03:45.660 --> 3:03:49.420]  brainwave that is most active when you're sleeping is called the Delta
[3:03:49.420 --> 3:03:53.180]  brainwave like come on let's go they're using plain words in our in plain
[3:03:53.180 --> 3:03:58.020]  sight but if people are just it you know starting to wake up wake them up with
[3:03:58.020 --> 3:04:01.580]  plain simple fact they can understand like that like how do you tell this
[3:04:01.580 --> 3:04:05.980]  between the first one in this Delta and why didn't the second the third one get
[3:04:05.980 --> 3:04:13.100]  a special name brother it's all in our face I totally agree with you they
[3:04:13.100 --> 3:04:17.740]  cooked up an artificial virus so they could create a vaccine for that that
[3:04:17.740 --> 3:04:22.700]  then kills you so the virus is real it's it's not a very dangerous virus almost
[3:04:22.700 --> 3:04:26.340]  everyone has died of something else but now there is mass death from the
[3:04:26.340 --> 3:04:29.900]  vaccine and they admit it but they think the public's too ignorant to admit it
[3:04:29.900 --> 3:04:34.060]  but you hear how many people know their family members have died from this we're
[3:04:34.060 --> 3:04:36.980]  gonna bring Fauci and others to justice don't worry one way or another they'll
[3:04:36.980 --> 3:04:40.060]  be brought to justice tell the universe works thank you Joe but these
[3:04:40.060 --> 3:04:43.580]  psychotics can't help but they have to kill so don't think they're invincible
[3:04:43.580 --> 3:04:48.140]  just because they have this much hutzpah or bravada or hubris and do this realize
[3:04:48.140 --> 3:04:52.700]  that's their nature their nature is to kill still destroy Cody and Tresh and
[3:04:52.700 --> 3:04:56.180]  then dr. Kaufman takes over

[3:06:58.780 --> 3:07:03.300]  talking about blood curdling with this doctor that's gonna come on and that's
[3:07:03.300 --> 3:07:08.540]  exactly what happened to my grandmother she was having heart palpitations went
[3:07:08.540 --> 3:07:13.340]  to the ER they went to draw blood to test and as it was filling the vial it
[3:07:13.340 --> 3:07:19.980]  quadded instantly and they had to redraw a second time and it's just it blows me
[3:07:19.980 --> 3:07:27.220]  away that people don't see that sort of stuff and it it's scary well you know the
[3:07:27.220 --> 3:07:30.980]  term blood curdling for those that don't know when milk becomes stagnant and
[3:07:30.980 --> 3:07:35.620]  basically curdles and little balls it's called blood curdling or milk curdling
[3:07:35.620 --> 3:07:40.700]  so the blood is literally curdling in the body after these injections wow so
[3:07:40.700 --> 3:07:46.540]  the very term blood curdling which means horror fear death yes yes it was
[3:07:46.540 --> 3:07:51.340]  quite stunning and then the last the color you had about his niece losing
[3:07:51.340 --> 3:07:55.580]  her eyesight I know someone else that got the Johnson and Johnson and their
[3:07:55.580 --> 3:07:59.820]  eyesight they're you know in their 60s and now they're going blind and they
[3:07:59.820 --> 3:08:04.540]  were perfectly fine before and people just don't want to accept the truth I
[3:08:04.540 --> 3:08:08.740]  think it's so horrible they just have to deny it and so they allow it to happen
[3:08:08.740 --> 3:08:13.420]  that's the psychology what's happening is this is modern war it's biological war
[3:08:13.420 --> 3:08:17.380]  by the globalist they've got to get rid of the population Americans think they
[3:08:17.380 --> 3:08:21.380]  are owed all this debt Americans want all these services and so the decisions
[3:08:21.380 --> 3:08:26.180]  just made to stun the society create cloud and piven and collapse the
[3:08:26.180 --> 3:08:29.380]  society I mean that's what the Rockefeller Foundation said they would
[3:08:29.380 --> 3:08:33.420]  do and and so it's a new type of war if it was tanks and airplanes we would
[3:08:33.420 --> 3:08:37.500]  stand up and defeat it but no instead it comes in white lab coats and most of
[3:08:37.500 --> 3:08:41.340]  people doing it Cody think they're part think they're good they're
[3:08:41.340 --> 3:08:46.020]  compartmentalized they don't even know exactly and that's the scary part you
[3:08:46.020 --> 3:08:51.060]  know they say the the pathway to hell is paving good intention and that's
[3:08:51.060 --> 3:08:55.780]  exactly what we're living right now amazing time Cody what else happened to
[3:08:55.780 --> 3:09:00.540]  your grandmother so as far as after that nothing else but it's scared her and
[3:09:00.540 --> 3:09:04.060]  there was mention of you know oh you have to get a third round of booster and
[3:09:04.060 --> 3:09:10.380]  she said how that's not happening and so she's she's lucky where she is now
[3:09:10.380 --> 3:09:16.180]  she's in her 80s so you know only time will tell but it it certainly gave her
[3:09:16.180 --> 3:09:21.700]  quite a shock so I'm just thankful she's still here and continue to fight the
[3:09:21.700 --> 3:09:27.580]  good fight you know you know it's it's insane and the main line medical
[3:09:27.580 --> 3:09:30.940]  literature says it causes massive blood clots I mean all these vaccines they're
[3:09:30.940 --> 3:09:33.820]  not vaccine all right last caller than our special guest those takes over
[3:09:33.820 --> 3:09:39.260]  Trisha Michigan go ahead and thanks for holding hi this is Trisha Michigan I've
[3:09:39.260 --> 3:09:44.860]  been trying to be patient with calling you know try to make this quick but send
[3:09:44.860 --> 3:09:49.500]  a shot out there to Brandon and Michigan for all the stickers I probably ran
[3:09:49.500 --> 3:09:53.860]  across them never met them don't know them and Alice's awesome breakdown which
[3:09:53.860 --> 3:09:58.260]  I identify with Jesus is my Lord and Savior and I'm not taking a shot I have
[3:09:58.260 --> 3:10:02.820]  all the documentation you have that you present I have it for in case I need it
[3:10:02.820 --> 3:10:07.900]  but I will lose my job over that because I know to save my life I shall surely
[3:10:07.900 --> 3:10:13.140]  lose it and I'm so thankful to God Alex that you are fulfilling the calling on
[3:10:13.140 --> 3:10:17.900]  your life don't ever get up give up we're all in this together and I'm a woman in
[3:10:17.900 --> 3:10:26.100]  the marina with you and I just want to say I use all the product I love the
[3:10:26.100 --> 3:10:30.640]  iodine and there's not too many shirts that I don't have I'm a walking bill
[3:10:30.640 --> 3:10:34.020]  board that's all I wear to work or wherever I'm at I get compliments on them
[3:10:34.020 --> 3:10:38.940]  all and I have two shirts from down there in January 6th of course you know I
[3:10:38.940 --> 3:10:41.780]  just wait for somebody to ask me questions because I can't wait to
[3:10:41.780 --> 3:10:46.620]  reach a truth bomb them and it's just any in offense don't don't let fear hold
[3:10:46.620 --> 3:10:51.420]  you back because it's just fake evidence appearing real my grandson that you
[3:10:51.420 --> 3:10:56.500]  signed that bullhorn for down in DC when I hopped the back of the fence he knows
[3:10:56.500 --> 3:11:01.140]  that we go to church we went to Trump parades and he knows Alex Jones in the
[3:11:01.140 --> 3:11:06.740]  wound care Joe is awesome if you can't if you want to know how well it works my
[3:11:06.740 --> 3:11:10.900]  daughter-in-law was bringing him over here for me to babysit and he touched
[3:11:10.900 --> 3:11:13.940]  the curling iron and burned his hands severely and I went right for the wound
[3:11:13.940 --> 3:11:17.580]  care Joe put it on his finger and it stopped he stopped crying right then
[3:11:17.580 --> 3:11:21.700]  in there so what better person to support the wound care well you're awesome
[3:11:21.700 --> 3:11:26.100]  Trace what was your what's your call on government Whitmer in the mandates well
[3:11:26.100 --> 3:11:32.700]  I can tell you what I don't support her one bit my dad passed away is beginning
[3:11:32.700 --> 3:11:37.140]  of all this which I know it was COVID because the facility who was in there
[3:11:37.140 --> 3:11:41.260]  was two times that people were ill and put in his room and I ran across a couple
[3:11:41.260 --> 3:11:45.860]  of the nurses later on that was working right with my dad and they ended up
[3:11:45.860 --> 3:11:51.100]  quitting cuz they couldn't handle all the death and I'm not gonna follow her
[3:11:51.100 --> 3:11:55.940]  cuz she's not she's not God and like I said the Lord may he get all the honor
[3:11:55.940 --> 3:12:01.980]  and glory and all we say and do cuz in Luke 10 I've been just waiting for a
[3:12:01.980 --> 3:12:07.980]  long time to get back to talk with you again but Luke 10 chapter chapter 10
[3:12:07.980 --> 3:12:13.300]  verse 3 go your ways behold I send you forth as lambs among the wolves and
[3:12:13.300 --> 3:12:17.940]  that's what we are fighting where you know there's no doubt this is a very
[3:12:17.940 --> 3:12:21.020]  evil corporate global takeover and I really appreciate your call and thank
[3:12:21.020 --> 3:12:24.140]  you so much Trish now I want to hear what our guest host has to say and I
[3:12:24.140 --> 3:12:27.540]  apologize for taking 10 minutes of the time away I'll be on the war room today
[3:12:27.540 --> 3:12:30.540]  because I got so much to cover I haven't gotten to all these businesses in
[3:12:30.540 --> 3:12:35.300]  Austin saying you got to have the injection and proof to come in them now
[3:12:35.300 --> 3:12:42.140]  restaurants banks stores hotels wedding venues we're gonna cover this first
[3:12:42.140 --> 3:12:45.700]  hour of the war room in about 50 minutes I want to hand the baton over to
[3:12:45.700 --> 3:12:50.580]  Dr. Andrew Kaufman who went to MIT and MD for the medical university of South
[3:12:50.580 --> 3:12:54.540]  Carolina and he's a psychiatrist which is a medical doctor and he's been a very
[3:12:54.540 --> 3:12:59.780]  well-spoken leading exposure of the tyranny we're witnessing so I want to
[3:12:59.780 --> 3:13:04.140]  hand the baton to him right now Dr. Kaufman thank you so much Alex it's
[3:13:04.140 --> 3:13:09.660]  great to be here and thank you for having me once again I want to say that
[3:13:09.660 --> 3:13:15.780]  I'm Dr. Andrew Kaufman coming to you live from Central New York on this sunny
[3:13:15.780 --> 3:13:21.940]  day of August 11th 2021 and I'm hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show
[3:13:21.940 --> 3:13:30.420]  today and we have a very let's see information-filled hour as usual and I'm
[3:13:30.420 --> 3:13:35.940]  gonna have two stories today the first story that I want to announce is called
[3:13:35.940 --> 3:13:41.340]  freedom collectivism and totalitarianism and I was very reassured to hear some
[3:13:41.340 --> 3:13:46.140]  of the comments from the callers with Alex just a moment ago because it seems
[3:13:46.140 --> 3:13:50.700]  that this audience is a little bit more awake to the situation than others but
[3:13:50.700 --> 3:13:55.820]  I'm gonna cover the historical philosophical and recent events that add
[3:13:55.820 --> 3:14:01.500]  up to this collectivist and totalitarian takeover and give you some
[3:14:01.500 --> 3:14:07.820]  concrete suggestions about what to do but the first story I'm going to discuss
[3:14:07.820 --> 3:14:14.060]  tonight is I'm going to tell you about the fraud that is called the delta
[3:14:14.060 --> 3:14:18.100]  variant and I want to assure you that this is a completely made-up and
[3:14:18.100 --> 3:14:24.620]  fabricated construct and I'm going to lay out the exact scientific principles
[3:14:24.620 --> 3:14:32.180]  that demonstrate how misinterpreted and false this notion is and of course as we
[3:14:32.180 --> 3:14:37.020]  know this is what is being used to manipulate us and to justify new
[3:14:37.020 --> 3:14:42.500]  policies as we mentioned from Governor Whitmer and many other authority
[3:14:42.500 --> 3:14:48.220]  figures so I've been very critical of virology and that they do these
[3:14:48.220 --> 3:14:53.180]  experiments which are really a tissue culture and they call viral isolation
[3:14:53.180 --> 3:15:00.660]  now this is their standard as flawed as it is for how to prove the existence of
[3:15:00.660 --> 3:15:05.300]  a virus well let me tell you that they have never even attempted this
[3:15:05.300 --> 3:15:10.740]  experiment for any variant including the delta variant now if this is their
[3:15:10.740 --> 3:15:16.100]  experiment that they used to actually prove that a specific virus exists and
[3:15:16.100 --> 3:15:21.220]  they haven't even attempted it well how can they say that this exists of course
[3:15:21.220 --> 3:15:29.620]  this is a major flaw in reasoning now they have only called this a thing with
[3:15:29.620 --> 3:15:35.180]  many other thousands of variants based on this computer simulated in silico
[3:15:35.180 --> 3:15:39.060]  genome sequencing and I'm going to review that in just a moment when we
[3:15:39.060 --> 3:15:43.420]  come back after the break but I want to also tell the viewers out there that if
[3:15:43.420 --> 3:15:49.380]  you want to learn about the real biology and the real ways of healing like some

[3:16:31.380 --> 3:16:36.260]  healthy in a crazy COVID culture me too but listen after all the research all
[3:16:36.260 --> 3:16:39.740]  the conflicting studies after all the squabbling there's one thing almost
[3:16:39.740 --> 3:16:44.020]  everyone agrees on it's that immune system health can literally be the
[3:16:44.020 --> 3:16:47.660]  difference between life and death you probably already believe that I
[3:16:47.660 --> 3:16:51.300]  certainly do so here's the thing I wanted to get past the craziness and
[3:16:51.300 --> 3:16:55.740]  find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate
[3:16:55.740 --> 3:17:00.380]  some efficacy in immune support now you'll have to sign a waiver but you

[3:19:06.220 --> 3:19:10.740]  the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses which
[3:19:10.740 --> 3:19:15.780]  is why fluoridated water is a big problem consuming too much fluoride forms
[3:19:15.780 --> 3:19:19.780]  phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural
[3:19:19.780 --> 3:19:24.340]  functions natural functions which have been known for millennia the Hindu
[3:19:24.340 --> 3:19:27.780]  chakras aligned with the endocrine system the chakra aligned with the

[3:19:32.900 --> 3:19:36.780]  pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and
[3:19:36.780 --> 3:19:42.540]  otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free water is essential to

[3:20:15.460 --> 3:20:21.580]  tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show
[3:20:21.580 --> 3:20:29.700]  hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones show once again I'm your guest host
[3:20:29.700 --> 3:20:36.180]  Dr. Andrew Kaufman here live from central New York on this day of August 11th
[3:20:36.180 --> 3:20:42.900]  2021 before the break I started talking about the lie that they call the Delta
[3:20:42.900 --> 3:20:46.780]  variant and I also announced the true healing conference there so please do
[3:20:46.780 --> 3:20:53.140]  check that out to come see us in person but back to the Delta variant so I had
[3:20:53.140 --> 3:20:57.300]  mentioned that there have been no attempts to isolate not only the Delta
[3:20:57.300 --> 3:21:02.780]  variant but any other variant and that this has been discovered by an inability
[3:21:02.780 --> 3:21:07.660]  to validate and repeat an experiment and get the same results which I'm
[3:21:07.660 --> 3:21:13.300]  referring to this in silico or computer simulated genome sequencing that's
[3:21:13.300 --> 3:21:18.740]  really the only pseudo evidence they have at all to say that there is such a
[3:21:18.740 --> 3:21:25.220]  thing as any variant and they report a lot of properties about this in terms of
[3:21:25.220 --> 3:21:30.100]  how it behaves clinically like is it transmissible is it cause severe
[3:21:30.100 --> 3:21:35.740]  illness well it turns out that they didn't actually study the virus itself
[3:21:35.740 --> 3:21:40.260]  but they looked at some experiments that I will describe with monoclonal
[3:21:40.260 --> 3:21:45.940]  antibodies pseudo viruses which are essentially lab created simulated
[3:21:45.940 --> 3:21:51.340]  viruses and of course more computer model modeling and I also want you to
[3:21:51.340 --> 3:21:57.540]  know that there is no test for any variant so we have these variety of
[3:21:57.540 --> 3:22:02.940]  diagnostic tests like the PCR test the antigen test antibody test the lateral
[3:22:02.940 --> 3:22:09.100]  flow test etc and of course all these are experimental diagnostic tests and
[3:22:09.100 --> 3:22:14.140]  none have actually been validated but they are all only for the original
[3:22:14.140 --> 3:22:20.820]  version of the made-up SARS-CoV-2 and none of these tests have been studied
[3:22:20.820 --> 3:22:27.620]  or gotten any type of emergency use authorization or any other permission
[3:22:27.620 --> 3:22:31.620]  from the government to sell them in fact I don't even think they've been
[3:22:31.620 --> 3:22:37.900]  developed so there is no way for any person to go and get a test for any
[3:22:37.900 --> 3:22:42.780]  variant so how do they actually know that this thing is real or that people
[3:22:42.780 --> 3:22:49.060]  have it so if we could go to the next slide I want to discuss an outbreak that
[3:22:49.060 --> 3:22:55.060]  was reported in Cape Cod Massachusetts a vacation destination and I did mention
[3:22:55.060 --> 3:22:59.820]  this briefly last week but it is important to go over this because what we
[3:22:59.820 --> 3:23:06.900]  can see here is a lot of contradictions so what happened here is that we had in
[3:23:06.900 --> 3:23:12.020]  this vacation area this summer a an alleged outbreak of a a couple hundred
[3:23:12.020 --> 3:23:19.980]  people with COVID-19 now of course we are using an invalid test to denote that
[3:23:19.980 --> 3:23:25.180]  these people have COVID so really this whole study could be tossed aside but
[3:23:25.180 --> 3:23:30.220]  let's just take it at face value and look at what they found well they reported
[3:23:30.220 --> 3:23:37.540]  that in Massachusetts overall the population about 69% have been vaccinated
[3:23:37.540 --> 3:23:44.140]  okay now in this outbreak of all the people who were diagnosed as having
[3:23:44.140 --> 3:23:50.940]  COVID in this outbreak they said 74% of them were fully vaccinated now that is
[3:23:50.940 --> 3:23:56.660]  a higher percentage than the number of people who've been vaccinated overall so
[3:23:56.660 --> 3:24:03.620]  what this suggests is that you actually have an increased risk of getting sick
[3:24:03.620 --> 3:24:09.820]  with this particular illness whatever it is if you are vaccinated because the
[3:24:09.820 --> 3:24:14.700]  percentage of vaccinated people in this outbreak were higher than in the general
[3:24:14.700 --> 3:24:20.100]  population so vaccinated people were overrepresented in this outbreak sample
[3:24:20.100 --> 3:24:26.820]  now despite that later down the paragraph after it reports these critical
[3:24:26.820 --> 3:24:32.660]  statistics there is a recommendation to that the vaccine is the most important
[3:24:32.660 --> 3:24:39.340]  strategy to use to protect against this illness now how is that the best strategy
[3:24:39.340 --> 3:24:44.420]  when it actually increases your risk of getting sick so this is what happens when
[3:24:44.420 --> 3:24:48.340]  you read some of these official documents is that you see these obvious
[3:24:48.340 --> 3:24:52.660]  inherent contradictions and this is a great sign that what you're reading is
[3:24:52.660 --> 3:24:57.620]  propaganda rather than science now even if we talk about the severity of the
[3:24:57.620 --> 3:25:01.940]  illness out of the few people that were hospitalized as a result of this
[3:25:01.940 --> 3:25:08.820]  outbreak 4 out of 5 of them 80% were vaccinated so it's not that they are
[3:25:08.820 --> 3:25:12.980]  more likely to get sick but have less severe illness it's actually they're
[3:25:12.980 --> 3:25:17.460]  more likely to get sick and they have more severe illness and that's
[3:25:17.460 --> 3:25:23.100]  essentially what this is telling you now it also reports here that 89% of these
[3:25:23.100 --> 3:25:28.380]  cases were with the Delta variant but that doesn't exist so that number is
[3:25:28.380 --> 3:25:32.460]  really meaningless but they put such a high percentage in there because they
[3:25:32.460 --> 3:25:36.460]  want to scare us intimidate us and that is the way that they're going to
[3:25:36.460 --> 3:25:42.260]  justify further lockdowns mask mandates and whatever else they might come up
[3:25:42.260 --> 3:25:47.340]  with next and we have some ideas about what's in the pipeline now once again it
[3:25:47.340 --> 3:25:53.100]  mentions in this report that antibody studies were used to make some of these
[3:25:53.100 --> 3:25:56.620]  determinations so let's look a little bit closer of this if we could check out
[3:25:56.620 --> 3:26:01.900]  the next slide please now I just want to make one more point because that is not
[3:26:01.900 --> 3:26:07.220]  the only study showing that people who are vaccinated are not protected we have
[3:26:07.220 --> 3:26:12.700]  this other publication here talking about breakthrough infections with the
[3:26:12.700 --> 3:26:17.020]  Delta variant so I believe that we're going to see more and more reporting
[3:26:17.020 --> 3:26:22.620]  about this but the CDC director Rachelle Walensky as you'll see in the next slide
[3:26:22.620 --> 3:26:30.580]  is not quite confident enough to make a bold statement but she is acknowledging
[3:26:30.580 --> 3:26:37.460]  that quote the Delta variant after vaccination may be contagious and spread
[3:26:37.460 --> 3:26:42.700]  the virus to others so she doesn't say that the Delta variant will make people
[3:26:42.700 --> 3:26:48.220]  who are vaccinated sick but she says that it will cause vaccinated people to be
[3:26:48.220 --> 3:26:55.180]  able to spread this alleged variant virus to others now I have to beg the
[3:26:55.180 --> 3:27:00.700]  question what exactly does a vaccine accomplish if it does not prevent
[3:27:00.700 --> 3:27:08.740]  transmission of the illness now if we go to the next slide this is the page on
[3:27:08.740 --> 3:27:14.620]  the CDC website where they actually talk about what a variant is so they define
[3:27:14.620 --> 3:27:18.860]  it and they give a classification system and the classification system is
[3:27:18.860 --> 3:27:26.700]  actually based on the potential health threat rather than you know the Greek
[3:27:26.700 --> 3:27:32.140]  letters as we have come to know and interestingly they don't even follow
[3:27:32.140 --> 3:27:38.180]  their own definitions about what classification to put for a particular
[3:27:38.180 --> 3:27:44.860]  variant however in this article it doesn't actually discuss how they
[3:27:44.860 --> 3:27:49.180]  determined that there is a variant in the first place and it also doesn't
[3:27:49.180 --> 3:27:54.820]  directly discuss how they determine the clinical characteristics of such a
[3:27:54.820 --> 3:27:59.220]  variant so you have to look to the reference sections and dig a little
[3:27:59.220 --> 3:28:06.300]  bit deeper now it does say in a footnote that the variants are determined by the
[3:28:06.300 --> 3:28:12.460]  in silica in silico genome sequence so we know that at least has been confirmed
[3:28:12.460 --> 3:28:18.620]  but you know after the break I'm going to talk about the crazy method that they
[3:28:18.620 --> 3:28:27.300]  use to ascertain any clinical information about these variants because as
[3:28:27.300 --> 3:28:33.420]  you know these variants don't actually exist so they can't actually take the
[3:28:33.420 --> 3:28:39.460]  variant out of a sample purify it and study it so what exactly do they do
[3:28:39.460 --> 3:28:45.140]  I'll tell you that it will completely astonish you the links that they go to
[3:28:45.140 --> 3:28:52.580]  make up pseudoscientific information in order to create the fear that will get
[3:28:52.580 --> 3:28:58.340]  us to go along with whatever they say we'll be back with more after the break
[3:28:58.340 --> 3:29:03.260]  you know listeners call into the show and they thank me and it makes me feel
[3:29:03.260 --> 3:29:09.180]  pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer for
[3:29:09.180 --> 3:29:13.460]  financial support and for word of mouth and then we're all this together and I
[3:29:13.460 --> 3:29:16.860]  you know it gets old having to come to you and say hey I got great products
[3:29:16.860 --> 3:29:20.100]  please bomb or we won't be here on air but it's true for the only media
[3:29:20.100 --> 3:29:23.740]  organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is
[3:29:23.740 --> 3:29:27.420]  not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut down
[3:29:27.420 --> 3:29:30.780]  everybody else they crippled all the other groups and we're still here and
[3:29:30.780 --> 3:29:35.020]  as this whole new world order comes out in the open our credibility is going up
[3:29:35.020 --> 3:29:38.300]  that's why we've got to be taken off here that's why America it's got to be
[3:29:38.300 --> 3:29:41.900]  taken down you can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still
[3:29:41.900 --> 3:29:46.340]  quasi-free you can't have info wars has been proven right be it on air with all
[3:29:46.340 --> 3:29:49.660]  the craziness that's about to unfold because if you think stuff's bad now
[3:29:49.660 --> 3:29:53.640]  just get ready so thank you all and get an info or store com get some great
[3:29:53.640 --> 3:29:57.540]  2020 election shirts supplements and so much more they're wonderful products and
[3:29:57.540 --> 3:30:03.300]  they support the info we're thank you the world is awakening the world is
[3:30:03.300 --> 3:30:07.260]  beginning to understand the globalist paradigm they are discovering the
[3:30:07.260 --> 3:30:12.060]  globalist the elites the manipulation the CFR the trilateral commission the
[3:30:12.060 --> 3:30:18.660]  Bilderberg group the bohemian grove the club of Rome and so even though it seems
[3:30:18.660 --> 3:30:23.260]  like the globalists are winning the truth is they've had to come out the open
[3:30:23.260 --> 3:30:28.740]  to attack human freedom because they're actually losing we have forced them out
[3:30:28.740 --> 3:30:33.100]  in the open so as bad as these times are a lot of negative things are about to
[3:30:33.100 --> 3:30:38.140]  happen realize humanity is winning you've got a trust in the plan of God and
[3:30:38.140 --> 3:30:43.700]  trust in the plan of God's justice that is invincible that is ethereal
[3:30:43.700 --> 3:30:48.940]  timeless and unstoppable so don't trust in man trust in God to lead God and
[3:30:48.940 --> 3:30:52.460]  director soul and then take action against the globalist and realize you've
[3:30:52.460 --> 3:30:57.020]  got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you we will never back down
[3:30:57.020 --> 3:31:01.580]  from the globalist and we will never surrender I preach about the dangers of
[3:31:01.580 --> 3:31:05.380]  cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech
[3:31:05.380 --> 3:31:09.060]  that are spying on us everywhere we go what we do but because they have great
[3:31:09.060 --> 3:31:13.180]  cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate I still have
[3:31:13.180 --> 3:31:17.100]  one because this Trojan horse this Promethean fire has a lot of power but
[3:31:17.100 --> 3:31:21.660]  when I'm not using it I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage a privacy

[3:33:01.380 --> 3:33:14.180]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:33:17.180 --> 3:33:23.300]  all right thank you hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm your
[3:33:23.300 --> 3:33:28.260]  host Dr. Andrew Kaufman coming to you live from central New York before the
[3:33:28.260 --> 3:33:33.260]  break we were speaking about the lie that is the Delta variant and I was
[3:33:33.260 --> 3:33:39.660]  going over the CDC's explanation for how they learn information about the
[3:33:39.660 --> 3:33:44.500]  clinical presentation and the behavior of these variants and if we could have
[3:33:44.500 --> 3:33:51.620]  the next slide I want to highlight that since they cannot actually get these
[3:33:51.620 --> 3:33:56.700]  viruses from nature because they don't actually exist they go to the great
[3:33:56.700 --> 3:34:05.220]  length of synthesizing what they call a pseudo virus excuse me now this is a
[3:34:05.220 --> 3:34:11.340]  laboratory creation that they essentially make a fake version of the
[3:34:11.340 --> 3:34:15.940]  virus in order to conduct research because they can't get the real virus
[3:34:15.940 --> 3:34:22.060]  and so you can see in this article that is on the slide this describes the
[3:34:22.060 --> 3:34:28.500]  procedure that was referenced by the CDC so we created VSV that is another fake
[3:34:28.500 --> 3:34:36.740]  virus based SARS-78 CoV2 pseudo viruses that contain each of the individual
[3:34:36.740 --> 3:34:45.500]  mutations as well as one with all eight mutations of the B.1.1.7 variant or the
[3:34:45.500 --> 3:34:53.460]  UK Delta 8 and etc. etc. now that B.1.1.7 is the code name for the Delta
[3:34:53.460 --> 3:35:00.300]  variant just to confuse you but what I would like to explain that they are
[3:35:00.300 --> 3:35:05.660]  actually doing here is they took the results of the computer simulated genome
[3:35:05.660 --> 3:35:11.140]  sequencing which they say is enough to tell that that there is something
[3:35:11.140 --> 3:35:17.580]  different about this sequence and they took those mutated sequences or that
[3:35:17.580 --> 3:35:22.620]  they didn't get the same result as the original SARS virus which was also a
[3:35:22.620 --> 3:35:29.540]  computer simulation and they used an actual machine to synthesize those
[3:35:29.540 --> 3:35:35.500]  sequences of genetic material in the laboratory and then they put those in
[3:35:35.500 --> 3:35:40.900]  this other virus particle that was a particle from a cell culture that they
[3:35:40.900 --> 3:35:45.380]  they purified out and they emptied and then they're putting this material
[3:35:45.380 --> 3:35:50.860]  inside of it and then what they do is they take these synthetic pseudo virus
[3:35:50.860 --> 3:35:56.780]  particles that they have concocted in the laboratory and they add them to a cell
[3:35:56.780 --> 3:36:03.060]  culture now they say that what will happen is that this synthetic pseudo
[3:36:03.060 --> 3:36:09.060]  virus will invade the cells in that culture and then what they do is they
[3:36:09.060 --> 3:36:16.100]  mix different monoclonal antibodies that they say are for the SARS coronavirus
[3:36:16.100 --> 3:36:22.940]  with the cell culture and depending on how they react that's how they
[3:36:22.940 --> 3:36:28.620]  guesstimate what the clinical response so for example there are these
[3:36:28.620 --> 3:36:33.420]  monoclonal antibodies that they have you know identified and I'm not even going
[3:36:33.420 --> 3:36:40.980]  to get into that this research also is based on a a lot of false assumptions
[3:36:40.980 --> 3:36:46.060]  but let's take it at face value once again that they have an antibody for
[3:36:46.060 --> 3:36:51.380]  example that's called a neutralizing antibody and they say that this is the
[3:36:51.380 --> 3:36:56.260]  antibody that actually protects you from the infection so when they add the
[3:36:56.260 --> 3:37:03.780]  neutralizing antibody to this pseudo virus cell culture big mess they can say
[3:37:03.780 --> 3:37:09.140]  well how tight does it bind does it react with this neutralizing antibody
[3:37:09.140 --> 3:37:15.580]  and if it doesn't react very well then they say it causes a more severe illness
[3:37:15.580 --> 3:37:20.780]  or they might say based on the same kind of experiment that it is more or less
[3:37:20.780 --> 3:37:27.260]  transmissible but not once did they ever do a clinical study with people who were
[3:37:27.260 --> 3:37:32.060]  infected with this because they would have to first prove that it exists then
[3:37:32.060 --> 3:37:38.340]  find out a way to reliably identify it and then look at you know people with
[3:37:38.340 --> 3:37:42.740]  this variant versus another variant that they do the same way and ascertain the
[3:37:42.740 --> 3:37:47.740]  information over time but this is not really done for example when we're
[3:37:47.740 --> 3:37:52.980]  talking about the issue of asymptomatic transmission the notion that people
[3:37:52.980 --> 3:37:58.900]  without symptoms can transmit disease to other people there are real-world
[3:37:58.900 --> 3:38:04.420]  studies and they all show that there was no transmission but that wasn't good
[3:38:04.420 --> 3:38:09.140]  enough to justify the policies of social distancing and lockdowns so what did
[3:38:09.140 --> 3:38:14.260]  they do is they created a computer simulation study and they tweaked the
[3:38:14.260 --> 3:38:19.420]  parameters on that simulation in order to make sure it showed that social
[3:38:19.420 --> 3:38:25.500]  isolation was effective at reducing transmission the problem was is that
[3:38:25.500 --> 3:38:30.700]  these illnesses don't exist inside of a computer or on a silicon wafer they
[3:38:30.700 --> 3:38:35.860]  exist in the real world people in the real world experience illness and
[3:38:35.860 --> 3:38:41.780]  sickness and if we ever want to truly understand what is making people ill we
[3:38:41.780 --> 3:38:49.980]  need to put aside all of this false and fraudulent research and actually study
[3:38:49.980 --> 3:38:58.100]  what is really in nature all right well I'm gonna shift gears now and get into
[3:38:58.100 --> 3:39:02.300]  my second story but I hope that was helpful and illuminating about the
[3:39:02.300 --> 3:39:09.740]  Delta variant and if we could please go two slides to the quote with freedom
[3:39:09.740 --> 3:39:15.300]  and I want to start off with just a little bit of a monologue here because
[3:39:15.300 --> 3:39:22.220]  many of you out there and many others who may not be listening they've been
[3:39:22.220 --> 3:39:27.820]  having these kinds of thoughts okay the thoughts of this will all end soon if we
[3:39:27.820 --> 3:39:34.380]  just stick it out or I'll just take the weekly PCR test it's better than the
[3:39:34.380 --> 3:39:41.060]  Vax or I'll get a religious exemption I'll get a medical exemption I will get
[3:39:41.060 --> 3:39:48.180]  a fake vaccine card I'll take the least harmful of the vaccines I'll wear a mask
[3:39:48.180 --> 3:39:57.220]  if I have to I have to travel so I'll do what's required I need my job my kids
[3:39:57.220 --> 3:40:03.620]  need to be in public school so I can work well if you've experienced these
[3:40:03.620 --> 3:40:11.780]  thoughts or impulses you are no longer living in freedom now you may not
[3:40:11.780 --> 3:40:17.460]  realize this yet you may falsely believe that you are still free but the truth is
[3:40:17.460 --> 3:40:22.220]  that you're not and I'm going to lay out the evidence for that during this story
[3:40:22.220 --> 3:40:27.980]  today and in fact if you act on these thoughts and impulses not only are you
[3:40:27.980 --> 3:40:36.060]  not free but you are actually helping the elites plan to establish a totalitarian
[3:40:36.060 --> 3:40:42.980]  state where no one has any semblance of freedom at all do you think that it's not
[3:40:42.980 --> 3:40:48.540]  already happening well I would request that you think again and if you're
[3:40:48.540 --> 3:40:55.340]  waiting for the time to stand firm the time to say no once and for all thinking
[3:40:55.340 --> 3:41:00.340]  that there will be a breaking point there will be a threshold well I'd like to
[3:41:00.340 --> 3:41:06.340]  tell you that the time is right now in fact as I see it this is really your
[3:41:06.340 --> 3:41:12.780]  last chance because if you stand up now there may be some consequences you may
[3:41:12.780 --> 3:41:18.020]  have to walk away from a job you may have to take your child out of school you
[3:41:18.020 --> 3:41:23.460]  may have to end even your marriage or other significant relationships you may
[3:41:23.460 --> 3:41:31.100]  alienate yourself from your family you may decrease your financial position but
[3:41:31.100 --> 3:41:38.460]  I want to tell you that these are all very mild and minor things to risk given
[3:41:38.460 --> 3:41:45.140]  the circumstance because if you wait if you delay in the future once the state
[3:41:45.140 --> 3:41:51.020]  is established and we see this happening on a day-to-day basis right now then you
[3:41:51.020 --> 3:41:56.180]  will risk something much much greater we've seen this over and over again in
[3:41:56.180 --> 3:42:02.220]  history that people who become disobedient once the totalitarian state
[3:42:02.220 --> 3:42:10.100]  is established will be killed they will be imprisoned they will be in forced
[3:42:10.100 --> 3:42:17.260]  labor camps suffering torture and other forms of human rights abuse right now
[3:42:17.260 --> 3:42:22.300]  those consequences have not come into existence especially not in the United
[3:42:22.300 --> 3:42:28.300]  States but we really have to act now is the time to start saying no start
[3:42:28.300 --> 3:42:36.300]  standing up because freedom is the only thing the only way that it is worth it
[3:42:36.300 --> 3:42:41.540]  to live look at all the suffering that we have observed from people living
[3:42:41.540 --> 3:42:46.340]  under the communism of the Soviet Union all throughout my childhood our pop
[3:42:46.340 --> 3:42:52.100]  culture was filled with stories about their plight and their suffering that
[3:42:52.100 --> 3:42:57.140]  we thought in the United States we would never experience so I'm gonna discuss
[3:42:57.140 --> 3:43:01.260]  the philosophy behind this we are at info wars are proud to announce the

[3:47:17.340 --> 3:47:32.340]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[3:47:32.340 --> 3:47:51.340]  Hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm your guest host, Dr. Andrew Kaufman on this fourth hour today on August 11th. Before the break, I was talking a bit about freedom and totalitarian and the timing and the situation that we are in right now.
[3:47:51.340 --> 3:48:03.340]  And if we could put up the slide on freedom, I want to talk a little bit about what freedom is and what people have said about freedom because it is really one of the most important aspects to life.
[3:48:03.340 --> 3:48:15.340]  Freedom is the air we cannot do without, that we breathe without even noticing it until the time comes when deprived of it, we feel that we are dying.
[3:48:15.340 --> 3:48:21.340]  And I have felt like this under the current regime. We could have the next slide please.
[3:48:21.340 --> 3:48:35.340]  The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs or impede their efforts to obtain it.
[3:48:35.340 --> 3:48:51.340]  Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily or mental or spiritual. And that is a principle that it is imperative that we embody in the current climate.
[3:48:51.340 --> 3:49:10.340]  Now, there is a destructive political force that is threatening this freedom. And we have all talked about it using different names, but I want to get at the actual philosophy that is behind this political march toward totalitarianism.
[3:49:10.340 --> 3:49:30.340]  And this is called collectivism, if we could have the next slide. And collectivism is a type of societal structure which the individual is subordinate to the whole, or the collective, the society, the nation, etc.
[3:49:30.340 --> 3:49:43.340]  And collectivism is in contrast to individualism, where the individual, the man or the woman is the most important and that their rights and interests are emphasized.
[3:49:43.340 --> 3:49:56.340]  And that is the philosophy, in fact, that the United States of America is founded upon and the one that was ingrained in me as being of the most importance ever since I was a child.
[3:49:56.340 --> 3:50:01.340]  We could have the next slide.
[3:50:01.340 --> 3:50:18.340]  So, this is from Ludwig von Mises. The individual has to subordinate himself to and conduct himself for the benefit of society and to sacrifice his selfish private interests to the common good.
[3:50:18.340 --> 3:50:34.340]  Now, this is the attitude of the collectivist and we have seen this play out in the current pandemic situation. And in fact, we have learned that this was actually a purposeful narrative that was devised by psychologists on the people.
[3:50:34.340 --> 3:50:48.340]  So, what I'm talking about is that when I was, you know, I've never actually worn a mask, not for once. And of course, I also lost my last job as a psychiatrist for refusing to do so.
[3:50:48.340 --> 3:50:57.340]  So, when I was out in public, many times I faced a lot of social pressure and ostracism and people were downright disrespectful.
[3:50:57.340 --> 3:51:11.340]  But one of the things that we maskless folks have heard was your killing grandma, as if, first of all, that there's any basis that you're not wearing a mask could have an effect on another person.
[3:51:11.340 --> 3:51:23.340]  But they're essentially saying that it's your responsibility to protect the safety of other people and that your own safety is a second fiddle to that goal.
[3:51:23.340 --> 3:51:37.340]  Now, we don't have to look far in history if you could bring up the next slide to see that collectivism was the philosophical underpinning of all communist, fascist and social dictatorships.
[3:51:37.340 --> 3:51:44.340]  And we have this quote from none other than Hitler, the common good before the individual good.
[3:51:44.340 --> 3:51:56.340]  The first of many parallels that we'll see between the Nazi regime, the communist regimes of the Soviet Union, the People's Revolution in China.
[3:51:56.340 --> 3:52:13.340]  And the list goes on and on because if we come up with a list of collectivist supporters, we're going to find not only Hitler, but also Lenin and Stalin, Polpa, Mao Zedong and others.
[3:52:13.340 --> 3:52:23.340]  So, in a collectivist system, the good of the society or the collective or the nation is put before that of the individual.
[3:52:23.340 --> 3:52:34.340]  However, what is in the good interest of the society? How does one determine that? Because the society is not a concrete thing.
[3:52:34.340 --> 3:52:43.340]  In other words, it's an abstract concept that makes up the totality of all the individuals in a community who live side by side with one another.
[3:52:43.340 --> 3:52:56.340]  And all those individuals have needs and things that would be good for their welfare, but there is no objective way to say what is good for the whole community, society or nation at large.
[3:52:56.340 --> 3:53:08.340]  And this is very convenient for those collectivist leaders because what it means is that they are the ones who get to decide what is in the best interest.
[3:53:08.340 --> 3:53:20.340]  In other words, they make the decisions for the collective and you as an individual are supposed to follow their instructions or else face the consequence even giving your life to the state.
[3:53:20.340 --> 3:53:29.340]  So, if we look at the next slide to see what's happening now is we see the collectivist leader who is the new director of the CDC.
[3:53:29.340 --> 3:53:41.340]  Dr. Rachelle Walensky, by the way, who is an academic position scientist and then suddenly was made the head of the CDC and now has all of this political power.
[3:53:41.340 --> 3:53:52.340]  And she is abusing this power severely because the CDC director which is an appointed position, not part of the legislature, not a judge.
[3:53:52.340 --> 3:54:02.340]  And she directed the moratorium on evictions to be extended without having any authority based in law to do so.
[3:54:02.340 --> 3:54:11.340]  So, this is an example of a technocrat, a scientific designated expert for the state making policy.
[3:54:11.340 --> 3:54:21.340]  Now, in our nation we have legislative powers given specifically to the Congress and the House of Representatives and they are the only ones who can make law.
[3:54:21.340 --> 3:54:38.340]  But what we have seen over and over again during this march toward the totalitarian state is that laws have been made by governors and officials for the CDC and the National Institutes of Health.
[3:54:38.340 --> 3:54:48.340]  Without any legislative process or approval and even in many cases law enforcement officers are enforcing these which are not laws.
[3:54:48.340 --> 3:55:01.340]  What this is is called the color of law and it is extremely illegal and an excellent basis to sue people who are trying to impose this tyranny on you.
[3:55:01.340 --> 3:55:14.340]  Now, the next slide here is anti-vaccine extremism is akin to domestic terrorism so that you can see censorship and scapegoating are a big part of the current agenda.
[3:55:14.340 --> 3:55:24.340]  And we've seen those in every totalitarian regime to poison public opinion against vaccinations could result in countless American deaths.
[3:55:24.340 --> 3:55:27.340]  That is akin to domestic terrorism.
[3:55:27.340 --> 3:55:36.340]  So, does this mean that we will have soldiers knocking at our doors to arrest us and incarcerate us or even to take us out?
[3:55:36.340 --> 3:55:51.340]  If we talk about the objective science which shows that vaccines in general and especially the pseudo genetic COVID vaccines are extremely dangerous.
[3:55:51.340 --> 3:55:58.340]  Now, if we go skip two slides here and I want to show another aspect which is reporting on your neighbor.
[3:55:58.340 --> 3:56:04.340]  We see coronavirus in Minnesota where to call if you see people who aren't social distancing.
[3:56:04.340 --> 3:56:09.340]  Once again, we find the same policies being supported in Nazi Germany.
[3:56:09.340 --> 3:56:13.340]  If we could have the next slide after that please.
[3:56:13.340 --> 3:56:33.340]  And now this is a very, very concerning about what is going on in France right now because they are enacting a major surveillance state with requiring to have a digital passport showing your vaccine and health status and eventually even to buy groceries.
[3:56:33.340 --> 3:56:59.340]  So, we can see the development of all of the aspects of collectivism and totalitarianism have already entered our nation and other nations across the world seemingly in lockstep according to an agenda carried out by a higher elite group who is really running this whole show.
[3:56:59.340 --> 3:57:06.340]  And if we could just have the next slide here because I want to give you some words of hope and encouragement.
[3:57:06.340 --> 3:57:19.340]  The great citizens of a country are not those who bend the knee before authority, but rather those who against authority if need be are adamant as to the honor and freedom of that country.
[3:57:19.340 --> 3:57:29.340]  And one more quote from Henry David Thoreau. Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty. The obedient must be slaves.
[3:57:29.340 --> 3:57:37.340]  So this is your opportunity to exhibit that disobedience that embodies the human spirit.
[3:57:37.340 --> 3:57:49.340]  With that, I would like to remind everyone to please sign up for your free registration at the True Healing Conference because we will be embodying that spirit of freedom and disobedience.
