[08:29.940 --> 08:35.740]  alive Obama administration officials have gone from arrogantly admitting they were spying
[08:35.740 --> 08:40.300]  on Trump to denying it and saying it's totally insane and calling for the chairman of the
[08:40.300 --> 08:46.700]  House Intelligence Committee Nunez to resign because he dare go talk to the president
[08:46.700 --> 08:51.260]  and confer and show him more documentation of exactly who was illegally spying on him
[08:51.260 --> 08:56.100]  and then leaking it because they can spy on foreign leaders while the president elects
[08:56.100 --> 09:00.620]  talking to him but you can't be then sharing that information domestically or giving it
[09:00.620 --> 09:12.700]  to the press well now we have video last night on MSNBC Obama's defense deputy just admitted
[09:12.700 --> 09:19.660]  spying on Trump the former assistant secretary of defense Evelyn Farkas also signed the state
[09:19.660 --> 09:25.500]  department has caused controversy after she appeared to admit during an interview on MSNBC
[09:25.500 --> 09:29.940]  that Obama administration spied on Donald Trump's transition team in order to gain intelligence
[09:29.940 --> 09:37.500]  for political use excuse me excuse me ladies and gentlemen if you're a radio listener I'll
[09:37.500 --> 09:42.220]  give you the headline but here it is from March 1st it was also reported in January in the
[09:42.220 --> 09:48.300]  New York Times the exact same headline Obama administration rushed to preserve intelligence
[09:48.300 --> 09:55.420]  of Russian election hacking including spying on the president the incoming president they
[09:55.420 --> 10:02.220]  admitted all that but the reason I go back to this I'm gonna play that clip coming up
[10:02.220 --> 10:07.780]  is it illustrates just again the fact that they think you have no memory they think that
[10:07.780 --> 10:14.740]  you are a complete and total absolute moron let me just do this it's kind of a game I've
[10:14.740 --> 10:18.660]  been playing for decades and I've never actually done it successfully but let me just try to
[10:18.660 --> 10:24.300]  maybe cover 50 headlines of what's coming up so you get an idea let's just start here
[10:24.300 --> 10:28.980]  then I'll go back to the more detailed Chomsky Trump may stage false flag terror attack to
[10:28.980 --> 10:36.060]  rally support we're gonna respond to that I thought false flags didn't exist Chomsky

[10:43.180 --> 10:47.420]  and it actually dovetails with Michael Moore says Trump will cause human extinction even

[14:10.540 --> 14:15.780]  Ergun again and his foreign minister saying to Europe you will do whatever we say politically
[14:15.780 --> 14:20.460]  with us you will give us all this aid you will open your borders further to us or we

[14:37.100 --> 14:44.700]  burn down every city we will launch a holy war or that translates jihad so oh have the
[14:44.700 --> 14:49.780]  Turk nationals in and then have them directed by their Islamist leader because they let
[14:49.780 --> 14:53.300]  the Turks in the last 50 years because they weren't the radical Muslims that fact they
[14:53.300 --> 14:59.780]  were the old Christians that got overrun by the Muslims when the western empire of the
[14:59.780 --> 15:10.140]  old holy Roman empire finally fell maybe the eastern empire excuse me Khan stand to noble
[15:10.140 --> 15:17.860]  which is now what's what's constant to noble now the capital of Turkey Istanbul and everybody
[15:17.860 --> 15:22.620]  goes and goes look at the incredible architecture of the Muslims those are churches like the
[15:22.620 --> 15:33.100]  blue mosque oh but there's their friends now oh let them all in and then boom we will burn
[15:33.100 --> 15:39.940]  your cities Turkish dictator Ergun threatened Europe on the same day the London attack
[15:39.940 --> 15:46.180]  by Tara scum think about that no see I say I never go through the whole stack without
[15:46.180 --> 15:54.100]  stopping but it's it's it's hard to do here's a big one that I'll be covering in battle
[15:54.100 --> 15:59.540]  DNC ask all staffers for resignation letters major reorganization of credit party underway
[15:59.540 --> 16:07.020]  NBC News so so so when the Democrats fire everybody because there's such a boatload
[16:07.020 --> 16:13.300]  of just trash and an anti-American scum but but their their failures they're gonna bring
[16:13.300 --> 16:18.540]  even a worse group but better believe it it's totally normal to fire everyone but when Trump
[16:18.540 --> 16:26.420]  has 40 was it 3 or 6 of the US attorneys fired Bill Clinton fired 93 that was totally normal
[16:26.420 --> 16:34.820]  but when when when Trump starts kicking out Democrats oh it's unheard of the outrage excuse
[16:34.820 --> 16:43.140]  me for breathing again that's how stupid they think you are are you that dumb let's see
[16:43.140 --> 16:51.060]  here is oh battle DNC ask all staffers resignation White House Trump was right on the this came
[16:51.060 --> 16:57.380]  out last week but more news from the police on the Jewish center bomb threats and it turns
[16:57.380 --> 17:03.380]  out it was a young Jewish man Spencer went on to say those who accuse the right of being
[17:03.380 --> 17:10.100]  behind the attacks need to be called out and it turns out the 19 year old Jewish man named
[17:10.100 --> 17:15.220]  Michael Kedar who had dual Israeli citizenship and was of course a big leftist was behind
[17:15.220 --> 17:19.540]  it because you need to say that the Trump supporters are putting swastikas up and knocking
[17:19.540 --> 17:25.780]  over Jewish cemeteries because that's why he's married in to Orthodox Jewish family and as
[17:25.780 --> 17:33.980]  Jewish grandkids because he's he's so anti-Semitic but it never ends does it it just never ends
[17:33.980 --> 17:38.660]  the false flags never end and that's what the left is so famous for and that brings me
[17:38.660 --> 17:48.700]  now before we go to break to know Chomsky Trump may stage false flag terror attack to
[17:48.700 --> 17:52.660]  rally support now control corporate media always makes a joke about me and says that
[17:52.660 --> 17:59.220]  I say every terror attacks a false flag well I introduced false flag in the last 18 years
[17:59.220 --> 18:03.940]  or so I didn't really cover it a lot the first few years before 9 11 even happened because
[18:03.940 --> 18:12.460]  Oklahoma City 19 years ago or 20 years ago now man was a false flag we had the newscast
[18:12.460 --> 18:17.060]  the police I interviewed them all they saw the feds by name planning bombs the feds
[18:17.060 --> 18:22.380]  said they weren't there I guess I got to skip the break they were planning bombs they said
[18:22.380 --> 18:31.940]  they weren't there we got their hotel receipts it all unfolded we know by name who planted
[18:31.940 --> 18:35.500]  the bombs people saw them doing they said what are you doing oh we're doing telephone
[18:35.500 --> 18:45.380]  work she said you don't like telephone repair men and we had her on Jane Graham many times
[18:45.380 --> 18:53.900]  we've had other witnesses on gray sticks of butter in the stairwell areas and she would
[18:53.900 --> 18:57.540]  go up and down it for exercise at lunch they were in there on the days before wiring and
[18:57.540 --> 19:04.140]  all in and I read the police officers head of the canine unit many others that they didn't
[19:04.140 --> 19:12.420]  kill like Terrence Yankee it was cop of the year of the first to respond and so yes there
[19:12.420 --> 19:18.580]  are pure staged events false flags where you use a sheep dipped guy like Tim McVeigh put
[19:18.580 --> 19:23.660]  into special CIA operations in the army who was then pissed off they were actually going
[19:23.660 --> 19:29.260]  to bomb a nursery and said I'm not part of this so you saw what they did to him they
[19:29.260 --> 19:32.780]  were going to burn Elohim City that was being run by the Southern Poverty Law Center these
[19:32.780 --> 19:41.260]  are nasty people folks but then Chomsky the pseudo intellectual funded by the big foundations
[19:41.260 --> 19:46.940]  comes out and tells you that Trump's gonna stage a terror attack with no proof no nothing
[19:46.940 --> 19:52.740]  and so I have a comment on Steve Watson's article that's up on info wars dot com that
[19:52.740 --> 19:59.580]  deals with all of this it's at the bottom the real false flag is opening Europe up to
[19:59.580 --> 20:04.260]  Islamic invaders five million plus and then using that crisis to revoke the liberties
[20:04.260 --> 20:08.220]  and freedoms of the people in those nations who are fighting for their very survival the
[20:08.220 --> 20:13.180]  real false flags allowing thousands of unvetted Islamist refugees in the United States with
[20:13.180 --> 20:20.020]  the same aim to merge the left with Islamo fascism and use the uncompatibility of orthodox
[20:20.020 --> 20:25.860]  Islam to force us to have political correctness Sharia light laws to not stir up the Muslims
[20:25.860 --> 20:39.700]  which they now are openly saying and doing isn't that just darling Chomsky Trump may stage
[20:39.700 --> 20:46.980]  false flag terror attack to rally support incident could be blamed on vulnerable people
[20:46.980 --> 20:50.820]  the five million jihadis that are in Europe eighty percent military aged men brought in
[20:50.820 --> 20:55.700]  by Merkel opened up three million more in North Africa ready to come in the ordering countries
[20:55.700 --> 21:00.340]  they'll be fined hundreds of thousands of euros per refugee they don't let in since
[21:00.340 --> 21:04.780]  when does the UN and the EU run those countries since they announced they'll march an EU army
[21:04.780 --> 21:10.780]  in and take over any military doesn't submit the arrogance but people are rolling over
[21:10.780 --> 21:19.340]  the cuckold Germans the cuckold French the coasters people that are in to being cocked
[21:19.340 --> 21:24.980]  and what is cooking folks it's getting in to being dominated and controlled getting
[21:24.980 --> 21:30.700]  into being subservient it's Stockholm syndrome it's watching ten guys line up right in front
[21:30.700 --> 21:36.180]  of you and gang bang your wife and tell you you're a little piece of nothing right in
[21:36.180 --> 21:40.620]  front of you a lot of men get into it and that's what's going on here ladies and gentlemen
[21:40.620 --> 21:47.260]  this is a cuckold west that bows down to these no bodies the pseudo intellectuals like
[21:47.260 --> 21:53.460]  Chomsky who only tells you about one spectrum of the control system and then he sits there
[21:53.460 --> 21:57.500]  when Trump has the whole power structure against him and is actually trying to deliver real
[21:57.500 --> 22:03.660]  prosperity the average people and fabulous wealth the elites as well bring back old-fashioned
[22:03.660 --> 22:12.020]  Americana he sits there worshipped by the foppish pseudo intellectuals leftist professor
[22:12.020 --> 22:17.980]  Noam Chomsky has charged that it's possible President Trump will stage a terror attack
[22:17.980 --> 22:23.740]  in order to offset initial policy problems and quell opposition speaking with the left
[22:23.740 --> 22:31.260]  website alternate Chomsky it's just oh Chomsky oh who floats when it's magic suggested that
[22:31.260 --> 22:35.700]  Trump could organize a false flag incident to rally supporters who are discovering that
[22:35.700 --> 22:42.460]  his promises are built on sand oh yes 300 billion in new jobs hundreds of major factories
[22:42.460 --> 22:48.100]  and companies coming back consumer confidence the best in 16 years the best small business
[22:48.100 --> 22:52.140]  numbers since 1984 the last big recovery we really had on and on and on and on it would
[22:52.140 --> 22:58.580]  take too long to recite it all wouldn't it renouncing we're a secure border nation sovereign
[22:58.580 --> 23:02.660]  breaking the back of political correctness actually going after the jihadi armies Obama
[23:02.660 --> 23:09.460]  and the globalist turned loose cleaning up what the globalist started just wars of defense
[23:09.460 --> 23:14.540]  trying to vet the Islamic hordes you're bringing in that it already come in and invaded Syria
[23:14.540 --> 23:19.580]  as the invasion point as they did two times in the last century into Turkey and then trying
[23:19.580 --> 23:24.380]  to get into Europe and you're the traders you know what you've done you hate the West
[23:24.380 --> 23:30.660]  so much that there's been a bosom for you to grow like vipers you want to conquer us
[23:30.660 --> 23:35.660]  so much like you want to conquer Russia with your filth and you're you're you're degenerate
[23:35.660 --> 23:41.060]  collectivist slavery that you know is slavery that you know puts you in charge over the
[23:41.060 --> 23:51.220]  people I call him a neo-trotsky I he says Trump with no evidence as Trump sits there
[23:51.220 --> 23:56.540]  and takes him all over the news saying killing and and COG Democrats going around the Pentagon
[23:56.540 --> 24:00.940]  trying to organize a violent overthrow and he sits there and just takes it and takes
[24:00.940 --> 24:05.260]  it and takes it while he desperately tries to reverse all the tyranny and the shadow
[24:05.260 --> 24:10.140]  government and the deep state and floor seven openly in the WikiLeaks block him and try
[24:10.140 --> 24:15.180]  to cheat us and try to stop everything we're doing and you just sit there going on on
[24:15.180 --> 24:24.620]  Chomsky oh let me tell you how it is yes he might do a false flag when I came out and
[24:24.620 --> 24:28.980]  said our government at the highest levels work with Saudi Arabia to take a place on
[24:28.980 --> 24:35.460]  9-11 to then attack countries that were actually westernized and not Wahhabis like Iraq who
[24:35.460 --> 24:42.060]  we shut up who was CIA run followed his orders to invade Kuwait that's fact that's the classified
[24:42.060 --> 24:48.180]  people go oh but he gassed the Kurds using CIA directives and and weather reports that's
[24:48.180 --> 24:53.540]  all been in the news I get our military that allied with the Kurds which is fine I don't
[24:53.540 --> 24:56.900]  think they're bad people in there in the region comparatively speaking they're not really
[24:56.900 --> 25:03.740]  as radical but the point is is that the facts are facts but oh that's not Chomsky he doesn't
[25:03.740 --> 25:10.420]  give you any facts like that he just goes oh oh oh oh oh oh my god here let me act like
[25:10.420 --> 25:17.540]  I'm no Chomsky let me read this article like I'm no Chomsky and yes Chomsky well Trump
[25:17.540 --> 25:23.340]  may stage false flag terror attack to rally support incident could be blamed on vulnerable
[25:23.340 --> 25:31.140]  people Professor Chomsky is charged that it's possible President Trump will stage a terror
[25:31.140 --> 25:46.780]  attack in order to offset initial policy problems and quell opposition oh my god the big foundations
[25:46.780 --> 25:53.220]  that fund the university's funding oh we sell anti-establishment I'm sorry speaking speaking
[25:53.220 --> 25:58.060]  with left-leaning website alternate Chomsky suggested that Trump could organize a false
[25:58.060 --> 26:02.780]  flag incident to rally supporters who are discovering that his promises are built on
[26:02.780 --> 26:09.900]  sand they're all hands on deck trying to plunge the stock market bankrupt everything
[26:09.900 --> 26:14.020]  so they can finally get you under their dirty thumbs finally dictate the terms of your surrender
[26:14.020 --> 26:18.420]  better clingers no matter what color you are they want your guns and they want you on that
[26:18.420 --> 26:25.260]  on that gulag plantation learning to lick those boots in order to in order to maintain
[26:25.260 --> 26:29.340]  his popularity oh but let's put some more fake polls out there you know hell they had
[26:29.340 --> 26:36.140]  to kill her at like 78 in some polls and CNN on election day you know why not why not
[26:36.140 --> 26:41.700]  say Trump Trump has a negative 200 like like let's say the Democrats have an approval rating
[26:41.700 --> 26:49.220]  of 100 and Trump has a negative of 200 no one in America likes Trump not one person CNN
[26:49.220 --> 26:54.700]  that's your fake news and why don't you just go that far but see he's actually being honest
[26:54.700 --> 27:00.540]  to everybody just like to their own troops more was like you know Trump's gonna win watch
[27:00.540 --> 27:04.980]  cuz they knew the real polls just like I did they knew the big data mining information
[27:04.980 --> 27:10.340]  Google and others had Bloomberg has the high-level business folks that billionaires like Trump
[27:10.340 --> 27:17.060]  get access to Google only gives and Bloomberg only gives super executive class access to
[27:17.060 --> 27:21.620]  stuff they've got that's better than the NSA that the NSA is jacked into to select global
[27:21.620 --> 27:26.700]  corporations that's why everybody wants to kiss globalist but is to get entree into that
[27:26.700 --> 27:36.100]  data swamp they see we're blind we sleep they live but don't you know there were people
[27:36.100 --> 27:40.380]  inside Bloomberg and other areas that were leaking intel to Trump he knows other billion
[27:40.380 --> 27:46.100]  billionaires that aren't playing along with the new order at least on their real actions
[27:46.100 --> 27:52.580]  like Peter teal and others so they all know this so look oh a little Freudian slip here
[27:52.580 --> 27:57.580]  in order to maintain his popularity the Trump administration will have to try to find some
[27:57.580 --> 28:02.740]  means of rallying with support and changing with this course from the policies they're
[28:02.740 --> 28:07.100]  carrying out which are basically a wrecking ball to something else or wrecking ball to
[28:07.100 --> 28:14.260]  the horrible globalist scumbag system we're in the professor also headed at such a stage
[28:14.260 --> 28:18.780]  terror tech to be blamed on vulnerable people the poor little sweet Muslims that kill each
[28:18.780 --> 28:22.940]  other everywhere they live and won't let anybody else live in their countries like 99% Muslim
[28:22.940 --> 28:28.220]  but that's okay because they're vulnerable people and he represents compassion and love
[28:28.220 --> 28:32.500]  and good just like the pope who won't let anybody into the Vatican that calls for Italy
[28:32.500 --> 28:38.620]  to bring on millions more quote refugees running around raping killing and going on welfare
[28:38.620 --> 28:43.380]  maybe scapegoat saying well I'm sorry I can't bring your jobs back which he's actually doing
[28:43.380 --> 28:48.380]  because these people are preventing it and the typical scapegoats goes to vulnerable people
[28:48.380 --> 28:54.660]  immigrants terrorist scapegoats are terrorist oh okay well I love that while the terrorist
[28:54.660 --> 29:00.460]  or scapegoats those portal terrorists he actually said that headline here ought to be Chomsky
[29:00.460 --> 29:05.820]  calls terrorist scapegoats and builds them as portal victims Muslims and elites this
[29:05.820 --> 29:10.820]  is the best unintentional comedy when you're awake they're like reading to a man in a trance
[29:10.820 --> 29:16.820]  and then the sweet little terrorist Trump one star he's done when you have a little vampire
[29:16.820 --> 29:22.220]  purse by your bed oh I know Chomsky oh no one rolls out this liberal carpet and everyone
[29:22.220 --> 29:32.420]  just falls down oh he's here oh my god a five year old can write his books oh he's so intellectual
[29:32.420 --> 29:38.420]  maybe scapegoats saying oh maybe oh I like oh maybe oh maybe maybe pull a rabbit out of
[29:38.420 --> 29:43.140]  his rear end well I'm sorry I can't bring back your jobs because these bad people are preventing
[29:43.140 --> 29:47.700]  it and the typical scapegoats vulnerable people immigrants terrorist Muslims and elites oh
[29:47.700 --> 29:54.580]  the elites oh the poor those are the poor people no Chomsky's defending the elite since
[29:54.580 --> 30:01.740]  everyone the elites the Muslims everyone against the poor need Americans Los Angeles mayor Eric
[30:01.740 --> 30:06.260]  Garcetti Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel and New York City council members have all thought
[30:06.260 --> 30:11.300]  back against Jeff Sessions threat to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities this is an interesting
[30:11.300 --> 30:15.860]  choice to make considering the very concept of sanctuary cities permits breaking the law
[30:15.860 --> 30:19.980]  and all of the news stories surfacing daily regarding illegal immigrants committing violent
[30:19.980 --> 30:24.260]  crime how about this from the daily caller the same day these cities said they would
[30:24.260 --> 30:29.500]  remain sanctuary cities three Iraq refugees arrested in association with a terrorist omitting
[30:29.500 --> 30:34.740]  information on refugee applications lying about background information and one is associated
[30:34.740 --> 30:40.020]  with a multiple hostage situation in an underground bunker but in these cities they would be welcome
[30:40.020 --> 30:44.620]  right back this is an example of how partisan the anti-trump extreme leftist liberals have
[30:44.620 --> 30:49.180]  become they've abandoned all logic common sense and even the rule of law if this is
[30:49.180 --> 30:53.540]  going on in a city near you I would either get out or call your local leaders to let
[30:53.540 --> 30:58.700]  them know if they stand for this they no longer have your vote for info wars dot com this

[35:56.140 --> 36:01.220]  This has come out Carol quickly wrote an 1100 page book for the state department the CIA
[36:01.220 --> 36:07.220]  a thousand copies were published because it was government funded they couldn't block
[36:07.220 --> 36:11.140]  the republishing of it by groups affiliated with the john bursa society in the eighties
[36:11.140 --> 36:12.140]  and nineties.
[36:12.140 --> 36:15.220]  We sell the book by the way and hardcover it in full restore dot com that's a separate
[36:15.220 --> 36:21.180]  issue and it was the head of the Georgetown political science and bill and hillary clinton's
[36:21.180 --> 36:31.740]  mentor in the CIA but they explain how they would create and control these leftist professors
[36:31.740 --> 36:38.580]  who would then lead the opposition to globalism and then at a critical time they would support
[36:38.580 --> 36:44.420]  globalism and um chomsky is the main guy he's like the fake counterpart to the brazilian
[36:44.420 --> 36:50.860]  brzezinski that's pushing the worldwide tyranny and then somebody like chomsky you know you
[36:50.860 --> 36:53.860]  read his books and i didn't learn anything from was already knew it all from reading
[36:53.860 --> 36:57.340]  actual globalist books were just straight up manuals on how they were doing it but he
[36:57.340 --> 37:04.460]  would do it from kind of a leftist communist perspective but as the left hero you know
[37:04.460 --> 37:12.340]  battling the evil corporations but then notice 1999 came and they staged false flags there
[37:12.340 --> 37:18.500]  to blame the demonstrators who were mainly liberals at the WTO in seattle very legitimate
[37:18.500 --> 37:26.820]  group of people and from that point on all the professors flipped they got their orders
[37:26.820 --> 37:31.500]  and they flipped and became pro globalist pro corporate world government and to read
[37:31.500 --> 37:36.900]  him now saying trumps gonna stage terror attacks to blame on the muslims and quote the elites
[37:36.900 --> 37:44.620]  and other vulnerable groups so now chomsky is defending the precious elites and the devos
[37:44.620 --> 37:50.460]  man and globalism it has to be propped up i mean that's what brzezinski said last week
[37:50.460 --> 37:56.780]  in a speech that's what john mccain said last week last friday in a speech they're hitting
[37:56.780 --> 38:05.980]  the panic button in every elite publication financial times of london atlantic monthly
[38:05.980 --> 38:11.860]  foreign affairs public affairs of the washington post and when you read these papers i read
[38:11.860 --> 38:15.980]  them every day it's yeah we're getting ready to overthrow trump and use cog to do it we're
[38:15.980 --> 38:19.580]  going to suspend congress for six months and we'll reorganize the country and we know best
[38:19.580 --> 38:24.660]  and we're getting the military ready just you know atlantic monthly no big deal and chomsky
[38:24.660 --> 38:33.820]  thinks it's all wonderful oh because trumps the elite and he's not delivering on his promises
[38:33.820 --> 38:39.980]  so he needs to blow something up now i mean he's delivering on his promises i can't believe
[38:39.980 --> 38:43.420]  he's getting anything done the way he's under attack and the open mutiny going on and then
[38:43.420 --> 38:49.740]  this guy can't admit that populism classic americana free market knocks the socks off
[38:49.740 --> 39:03.220]  that produced maryland road the 57 chevy shattern rockets rock and roll everything the whole
[39:03.220 --> 39:08.740]  world's culture then globalists hijacked it and turned it into evil but it was wild wild
[39:08.740 --> 39:17.940]  west sexy and it came in hundreds of flavors and you could start out poor and become the
[39:17.940 --> 39:23.020]  rich span america you could be the president you could be from some small guy in fredersburg
[39:23.020 --> 39:29.180]  texas and end up being the head of the u.s navy but under their system now that's not
[39:29.180 --> 39:35.020]  how it works you got to be part of the elite this guy is such a fraud he is such a fraud
[39:35.020 --> 39:39.020]  and any real leftist out there summer when the left actually stood for some good things
[39:39.020 --> 39:43.260]  but it was always controlled by the big foundations to keep the globalist enemy which would just
[39:43.260 --> 39:50.500]  be kind of americana classical thomas jefferson liberalism on a very short lease and that's
[39:50.500 --> 39:56.140]  just gone now all the real liberals i know say what happened to liberals when they start
[39:56.140 --> 40:00.580]  beating people up and you know it's when they got scared of what trumps can do because
[40:00.580 --> 40:08.340]  you believe tv shows that he's hitler and because it hundreds of universities people
[40:08.340 --> 40:13.580]  paint swastikas on the wall and knock over jewish tombstones and in every case get caught
[40:13.580 --> 40:25.580]  and confess it's so obvious they reportedly have not been real cross burnings in this
[40:25.580 --> 40:30.940]  country that have been documented over a decade when my dad was a kid and his dad stood against
[40:30.940 --> 40:34.020]  the kkk and stuff like that and he's texas and ran as a republican and did things like
[40:34.020 --> 40:37.740]  that my dad said you overplay it like there were a bunch of threats and a big deal they
[40:37.740 --> 40:45.140]  were hated and seen as toothless losers in the early 1960s son i mean sure every once
[40:45.140 --> 40:48.420]  in a while i you know somebody say something rude to my family or we'd be in a grocery
[40:48.420 --> 40:51.660]  store or something and somebody walk over and say something mean to my grandmother but it
[40:51.660 --> 40:59.060]  was always trashy people but i mean it's just i believe me i know i mean the clan the clan
[40:59.060 --> 41:05.340]  was a was a a a joke horrible thing to be associated with by the 1950s when eisenhower
[41:05.340 --> 41:11.420]  other people said this is degenerate and it already become a gang you know since the civil
[41:11.420 --> 41:15.020]  war was a paramilitary force at first during the occupation of south but that's all just
[41:15.020 --> 41:20.460]  history folks and they just don't think you know any of it and they have these charlatans
[41:20.460 --> 41:28.900]  like noam chomsky who sits there like a garden gnome like yoda and goes and then he comes
[41:28.900 --> 41:37.620]  out and talks about elites the poor elites no one that knows history can argue with the
[41:37.620 --> 41:45.340]  fact that the left was anti-globalist and so was the libertarian movement and the conservative
[41:45.340 --> 41:51.500]  arm of the public who wouldn't be against foreign tpp and imf and world bank and wto foreign
[41:51.500 --> 41:55.740]  secret groups running us i don't care what color you are where you came from left right
[41:55.740 --> 42:03.500]  center no one should be for that that's why i was against it and made a film about it
[42:03.500 --> 42:12.460]  the takeover but you read chomsky's writings now it is disgusting he is for the most elite
[42:12.460 --> 42:16.340]  corporations and their consolidation of control and the censorship you see happening and all
[42:16.340 --> 42:23.180]  the rest of it and you talk to his followers they are the dumbest pseudo intellectuals
[42:23.180 --> 42:26.580]  you've ever talked to they don't know any facts they don't know anything and i don't
[42:26.580 --> 42:33.700]  try to say that to put them down to feel good i feel bad that there's just generations
[42:33.700 --> 42:38.260]  of people with worthless college degrees who just feel like num chomsky's their god and
[42:38.260 --> 42:45.260]  he's not folks num chomsky like the pope like the communist president in china is a dictator
[42:45.260 --> 42:53.340]  like urgun all these people are dirt bags and they all hate donald john trump because
[42:53.340 --> 43:00.860]  donald trump wants prosperity for everybody now i'm done on that because i've got a lot
[43:00.860 --> 43:05.500]  to cover here but speaking of eugenics we just played that silent green intro michael
[43:05.500 --> 43:10.340]  moore says trump will cause human extinction liberal propagandist michael moore said monday
[43:10.340 --> 43:18.700]  afternoon on twitter that president donald trump will cause the extinction of human
[43:18.700 --> 43:24.980]  life on earth now if you actually get into what the leftist and the globalists are pushing
[43:24.980 --> 43:30.740]  and you just heard statements from top leftists like bill marr they want massive population
[43:30.740 --> 43:35.740]  reduction they want less people they don't realize massive populations built the cities
[43:35.740 --> 43:42.460]  built the technologies built the systems but this cloistered you know heavily armed
[43:42.460 --> 43:51.420]  hypocrite with mansions all over the country he supports the whole abortion factory system
[43:51.420 --> 43:56.660]  he supports the whole globalist program that he tells you trump will extinct all life on
[43:56.660 --> 44:02.740]  earth historians of the near future will mark today march 28 2017 is the day of the extinction
[44:02.740 --> 44:11.460]  of human life on earth begins thanks to donald trump what meanwhile hp v vaccine paralyzes
[44:11.460 --> 44:17.380]  12 year old aspiring pop star daily mail and they admit it does it it kills people it's
[44:17.380 --> 44:21.780]  all part of the eugenics operation but it's okay because ap reports felony charges for
[44:21.780 --> 44:28.140]  two secretly filmed plant parenthood in california but if you're exposing crime and committing
[44:28.140 --> 44:33.060]  a crime to do it by the letter of the law but only targeting the health care health
[44:33.060 --> 44:38.500]  care practitioners you're covered you're given immunity under common law but see they're
[44:38.500 --> 44:43.100]  all up there happy see it's the crime isn't keeping babies alive the crime isn't harvesting
[44:43.100 --> 44:46.460]  their organs the crime isn't telling people that you're selling their babies parts and
[44:46.460 --> 44:52.580]  making sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars it looks like an eight and a half month old
[44:52.580 --> 44:58.540]  baby no no no the crime is videotaping it now those folks are heroes absolute heroes and
[44:58.540 --> 45:04.580]  what's happening in the uk well they had the lisbon treaty a few decades ago and suddenly
[45:04.580 --> 45:10.580]  it was a treaty but the uk never voted people of england and scotland other areas of wales
[45:10.580 --> 45:16.820]  never voted to enter the european union and now they make over 90 percent of their laws
[45:16.820 --> 45:23.420]  that's admitted that's not debatable and the e u parliament is elected but it's ceremonial
[45:23.420 --> 45:29.100]  and advisory is the term to the council that has immunity and is above the law oh and i
[45:29.100 --> 45:34.700]  forgot the best part tax exempt why not it's now threatening an e u army takeover they
[45:34.700 --> 45:38.300]  weren't ready to roll that out two years ago when we first started exposing with lord
[45:38.300 --> 45:43.460]  montan so they said oh conspiracy theorists claim they've seen secret draft plans for
[45:43.460 --> 45:52.780]  an e u army to block countries they now call them states from leaving but guess what a few
[45:52.780 --> 45:56.180]  months ago they released the exact same draft and admit it's true just like we have a federal
[45:56.180 --> 46:00.420]  government the civil war wouldn't let us leave they're now saying but see we voted to enter
[46:00.420 --> 46:04.100]  into this we were at least part of it had a revolutionary war together and a shared group
[46:04.100 --> 46:08.700]  the french the germans that you know the the the swedes i mean these people are as different
[46:08.700 --> 46:14.500]  as night and day culturally that's why they have countries they're they're not they didn't
[46:14.500 --> 46:19.620]  get along but the globalists want to force flood europe now with even more incompatible
[46:19.620 --> 46:26.780]  people islamist and others and then referee the whole melee and a giant false flag that
[46:26.780 --> 46:31.500]  gnome chomsky and others have been cheerleading of flooding us with totally incompatible
[46:31.500 --> 46:36.460]  drags of the islamic world who invaded syria wanting some free land and got their asses
[46:36.460 --> 46:40.880]  kicked into europe but they're now taking over there running around like mobs of mobs
[46:40.880 --> 46:54.980]  of psychotic leprosy covered vermin cultural leprosy but the good news is they move forward
[46:54.980 --> 47:00.580]  and it's popular in the uk and the prime minister has announced they're going forward with the
[47:00.580 --> 47:06.740]  pullout nice the farad celebrates article 50 day you've been triggered and they lasted
[47:06.740 --> 47:10.700]  him for decades in parliament and then in the EU parliament they're not laughing now they

[47:16.620 --> 47:23.700]  lines you bet wheels off your vehicle you bet crash your airplane you bet the pilot
[47:23.700 --> 47:29.260]  is pretty much a vegetable farage climbed out blood pouring out all over what's seven

[47:48.220 --> 47:53.220]  prisoners torture each other for not wearing the veil but that's okay they've got un programs
[47:53.220 --> 47:59.060]  running all over european tv we played it showing rock stars and movie stars hot blonde
[47:59.060 --> 48:05.780]  saying i wear the hajib and saying you wear the hajib telling the telling german women

[48:45.580 --> 48:49.780]  weekend where they all flicked off the monument designed to remember the millions murdered
[48:49.780 --> 48:54.180]  by the totalitarian ideology most of the responses on twitter to those pictures mock the idea
[48:54.180 --> 48:58.100]  that there should be a memorial for the many innocent people who died as a result of communist
[48:58.100 --> 49:04.340]  policies they've gone to universities they've got worthless degrees they literally believe
[49:04.340 --> 49:08.620]  living under some communist general like you do in china or north korea or venezuela collapsing

[54:45.180 --> 54:49.920]  movement so they can control black people and get them on welfare and destroy their
[54:49.920 --> 54:53.300]  families in it took him 3040 years to get it going and look what they've done
[54:53.300 --> 54:58.620]  I mean Margaret Sanger's papers are public. There's films. There's books written on it. That's the same thing with Carol Quigley
[54:58.620 --> 55:05.500]  I mean, I read stuff. He wrote in the early 60s about the creation of people like num Chomsky word for word
[55:06.220 --> 55:08.220]  Not my opinion
[55:08.580 --> 55:11.460]  And that's why I get so upset
[55:13.380 --> 55:18.500]  You should read tragedy and hope it's the size of a Dallas phone book back when they had big phone books
[55:18.500 --> 55:20.500]  It's
[55:21.900 --> 55:27.020]  Like this has a 1980s phone book in a big city go read for yourself and then you'll go if you actually read the whole book
[55:27.020 --> 55:29.020]  You'll see it go. Oh my god. This guy
[55:29.420 --> 55:34.500]  See the State Department couldn't figure out how to run things. They're like we're we're communists, but we're not communists
[55:34.500 --> 55:39.340]  We're fascist, but we're not we want dictators. We don't want free countries. Both parties are gonna be controlled
[55:39.340 --> 55:41.340]  We're gonna have a controlled left and right
[55:41.340 --> 55:47.820]  And then so they wrote this book show a thousand people could understand it because they weren't Machiavelli
[55:48.140 --> 55:53.140]  So I mean, it's not my opinion about Chomsky. He is a horrible person, but I'm done ranting
[55:53.980 --> 56:00.980]  But it's like a rape fan, you know, it looks all nice and candy puppy. That's how they act. Oh liberal. Oh my gosh
[56:01.260 --> 56:03.700]  Communism is really good. You're gonna like it get in the car
[56:03.700 --> 56:10.300]  They don't normally you know say rape down on the side, but if you're actually coming to China
[56:10.300 --> 56:14.020]  They do that we're gonna rape you of your life and cut your organs out and sell it
[56:14.620 --> 56:19.300]  Now before I go any further, I want to get to the border. We got a bunch of guests coming up today and need to tell you about that
[56:20.060 --> 56:24.940]  She plugged twice an hour. I don't need to find her operation. The toothpaste will sell out today

[56:52.660 --> 56:57.980]  They hate Roger Stone. They call us effective dangerous, you know stone MVP
[56:57.980 --> 57:03.580]  They're not attacking us because you know, we're fun to make fun of they're attacking us because we're radical Americans
[57:03.700 --> 57:07.420]  They're radical globalists. We're radically challenging them. We don't just
[57:08.180 --> 57:11.220]  Eat around the edges as Barry Goldwater said
[57:11.940 --> 57:13.940]  Extremism and defense of liberty is no vice
[57:14.220 --> 57:17.340]  So I'm telling you folks you want to see us really get aggressive

[58:54.500 --> 58:59.660]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most
[58:59.660 --> 59:05.140]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system
[59:05.140 --> 59:12.700]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host

[1:00:01.860 --> 1:00:20.620]  Oh, it's tell Alpancho says distance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's alex jones. Love that Merle Haggard
[1:00:20.620 --> 1:00:35.620]  The desert's quiet Cleveland's cold so the story is we're told I don't need your prayers is true
[1:00:35.620 --> 1:00:45.420]  Save a few save a few left it to all right. He only did what he had to. I want to get out on a boat somewhere and take my children fishing
[1:00:45.420 --> 1:00:51.020]  Let's put some Merle Haggard on Merle Haggard George straight
[1:00:51.020 --> 1:01:01.020]  Willie Nelson well and Jennings white Yocum little Charlie Daniels little Hank Williams little Hank Williams Jr.
[1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:21.020]  43 years I've been alive. It's when one hell of an adventure so far. What an amazing world we live in just filled with magic
[1:01:21.020 --> 1:01:34.020]  Every major study shows the so-called left are empty unhappy suicidal people and now they're becoming hateful. They are so mean
[1:01:34.020 --> 1:02:03.020]  Millie we were talking about her with her child at the Whole Foods this morning and a cute little son and he's a toddler now people come over and hiss at her and her rude and her mean and a laugh at her and somebody ran into her with a shopping car and all these trendies laughed at her and I said I said Millie you're super good looking number one and you got a great looking son and they just don't like the fact you're so feminine
[1:02:03.020 --> 1:02:32.020]  I mean you got a gender you're powerful humans are powerful they don't like it they don't like women using their power of creativity and and and just in love and beauty and everything there is and men being strong and honorable that there it's a total assault on the species scientifically by the robber barons and the British royalty starting in the 1850s in England adopted here by 1900
[1:02:32.020 --> 1:02:45.020]  All of it the health departments everything I'm not saying it's all bad but it was set up to be bad humans are so good we even take their evil agendas and some good comes out of it but I've read that's not exaggerate
[1:02:45.020 --> 1:02:56.020]  30 plus books on eugenics written by the founders of it the top people Galton you name it I mean when I tell you this stuff this is not my opinion
[1:02:56.020 --> 1:03:13.020]  people are depressed they're unhealthy they're dying and again I'm not ever up here on some holy mountain like I'm Mr know it all Mr Beachbody I just know what's happening to me I know what screens times doing I know it bathing and all this electromagnetic radiation does to me but I do it in a war
[1:03:13.020 --> 1:03:31.020]  but notice Steve Jobs didn't let his kids play with a computer and iPad people don't believe that when I say it I saw some articles saying I was a liar he like gave interviews before he died saying that there's literally tens of thousands of articles and studies saying screen time rewires your brain brain damages you as all this crap to you
[1:03:31.020 --> 1:03:56.020]  unless you're consciously dealing with it see a book as I said this is key to know this is incontrovertible a book and that was a New York Times article or he said that I should add a book like let's click on it's it's it's it's linked to the dawn's article for radio listeners I want to show them the actual New York Times article if you guys scroll down there it is a piece entitled Steve Jobs was a low tech parent there you go
[1:03:56.020 --> 1:04:08.020]  oh more fake news we're conspiracy theories but but getting back to what I was saying you read a book you have to visualize it
[1:04:08.020 --> 1:04:28.020]  that's why I don't like pornography because it just cheapens it and lowers libido the study show but if you're I'm not really into like sex novels or anything but I've read in books in literature sexual passages that are so much more arousing in your heart not not not in your growing
[1:04:28.020 --> 1:04:39.020]  because it's it's about passion and love and see they don't want you resonating with that or if you listen to radio it shows IQs go up you have to visualize it as well
[1:04:39.020 --> 1:05:00.020]  see TV you go into that trance and then they got you then they can bring in those savage messages to assault you and your children and we all just have to break with these people entirely unless we watch them to analyze them and to show our children like you in Africa say that's a crocodile elite you don't get close to it you just show them the enemy and then that's it
[1:05:00.020 --> 1:05:17.020]  while some liberal cities are fighting for the rights of law-breaking non-citizen migrants others are cutting funds to schools that are too white Walter Reed Middle School in North Hollywood is having funds cut because their school student body is too white and this has led to layoffs and increased class sizes
[1:05:17.020 --> 1:05:32.020]  think schools have issues leave it to Democrats to make it worse think about this if the tables were turned if Republicans were moving funds from schools because they were too black to schools that had a more diverse student body there would be outrage and rightfully so but this is what Democrats are doing
[1:05:32.020 --> 1:05:53.020]  while shaming anyone who makes decisions or judgments based on someone's identity the Democrats make policy based on identity while shaming people who make policy based on identity what do you expect in California where they continue to elect people like Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters to mentally ill politicians that appear to have no clue what's even going on
[1:05:53.020 --> 1:06:15.020]  America let's stop electing morons for info wars dot com this is Owen shroyer you ever wonder what happened to America they lost we want to see what trumps up against revelation the movie dot info because of what we did on this day changes come to America
[1:06:15.020 --> 1:06:36.020]  the nation has been hijacked by international forces bent on global governance when I was a boy it was okay to be proud of the flag heritage mom and apple pie gobs school reality had a future and beef was for supper revelation dawn of global government
[1:06:36.020 --> 1:06:55.020]  we're the solution Americans ain't nothing more to it than that starring Alex Jones Charlie Daniels and special ops general Jerry Boykin theatrical screenings on demand DVDs now available want to shed some tears over the red white and blue Americans need to see this film

[1:08:01.020 --> 1:08:25.020]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[1:08:25.020 --> 1:08:41.020]  in mere moments we're going to step on my new popular TV slash radio host out of the great Canadian wilderness of liberal brainwashing run him here in just a moment Brexit's moving forward in the UK globalism is in collapse all across the planet
[1:08:41.020 --> 1:09:01.020]  Trump may stage a false flag terror attack to rally support and target the vulnerable elite and other victims just no chance he's not calling the crony capitalist the scumbags of the planet that are out of the radical Islam the victims the elite and Islam are the poor little babies that are totally incompatible with themselves
[1:09:01.020 --> 1:09:16.020]  their countries are 99% Muslim for a reason and the left again is totally double down on this we'll talk to step on my little about that the Trump bump consumer confidence hit 16 year high but again they're putting everything they can against Trump
[1:09:16.020 --> 1:09:33.020]  openly saying they want to drive down the stock market to teach him and us a lesson just like they tried to drive down the British stock market they're in London in the city of London to teach them a lesson at the arrogance of we're going to teach you a lesson by driving down your stock market and making sure you don't get jobs
[1:09:33.020 --> 1:09:48.020]  and then turn around and go Trump's failing Trump's failing Trump's failing I'm surprised he's gotten anything done this open rebellion the articles on info wars dot com last time about this they have Atlantic monthly with former top Obama officials saying we're moving with COG to overthrow
[1:09:48.020 --> 1:10:04.020]  Trump and that means physically and have six months under executive orders go read it to where they can suspend Congress and have new elections and they said the whole Republican parties infiltrate with Russians we've got to get rid of all of them
[1:10:04.020 --> 1:10:19.020]  what do you call it when you destroy entire political party political genocide folks by the way I'm not embellishing this okay I'm an expert on COG just because I've watched the PBS documentaries and CNN used to report on it and I've read books on it but this is if there's a nuclear war killing
[1:10:19.020 --> 1:10:34.020]  the president this is the designates may now have TV shows or designates takeover priming the public just like they have the new shows on HBO and on Showtime and CBS where homeland and Alex Jones characters really racist and puts out fake news and there's a woman president
[1:10:34.020 --> 1:10:44.020]  they thought she'd be in all the scripting is still lined up for that like the Chelsea book where she heads the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation worldwide for global government
[1:10:44.020 --> 1:11:00.020]  so there is quite a calamity going on we'll also get into did Obama's defense deputy just admit spying on Trump that's Paul Watson yes she says we were spying and he got all the intel he could to share it but that was in the March 1st article Obama administration rushed to preserve intelligence on Russian election hacking
[1:11:00.020 --> 1:11:15.020]  New York Times Matthew Rosenberg and we have the January 20th where Rosenberg said they were wiretapping Trump Tower member we have the communiques of Flynn we have him so I want to ask Devon Malin who's a smart guy
[1:11:15.020 --> 1:11:32.020]  in many facets are they winning are they losing is this total mental illness is there a method that matters because because we do not have memories of goldfish I mean some people do but a large contingent have longer memories and the real scientific polls coming out
[1:11:32.020 --> 1:11:46.020]  Trump's like 65% right now just like I told you during the election they've got Gallup polls one days 36 one days 55 it's all crap folks on people on landlines I won't get into polling technology everybody knows just like jobless numbers it's it's or inflation numbers
[1:11:46.020 --> 1:12:00.020]  it's fake Trump comes out and says they're fake numbers oh no one ever said that it's admitted fact every economist will tell you that just like he said most these cross burnings and church burnings and Jewish center attacks or false flags more like almost all of them I can't remember one
[1:12:00.020 --> 1:12:18.020]  that was real they just admitted the 19 year old Jewish liberal was doing it running around engaging in all these attacks so where do we start I mean there's so much to go over here I just don't know just in a general atmosphere of their incredible deception
[1:12:18.020 --> 1:12:38.020]  where Derspiegel's here and says that I said you want to suck my sausage I didn't say that I mean it's like CBS anchor under fire for censoring Kennedy interview this is what oh who was the female anchor that got sued because people recorded the anti gun deal
[1:12:38.020 --> 1:12:52.020]  and a Katie Couric Katie Couric and then they just released the hours the actual focus group where they'd say well why do you think guns aren't causing the crime well people do it in areas that you know have gun control they have higher gun laws but she'd cut to them going just waiting
[1:12:52.020 --> 1:13:01.020]  because they'll rotate and ask you to sit there like you don't know what you're doing show you scratching your nose but you can't answer well he did that to
[1:13:01.020 --> 1:13:16.020]  head couple so again I've gotten to the point where no exaggeration I now have people like Buzzfeed and the Rolling Stone and the New York Times and people chasing me down the street they follow me around now I mean I'll be walking down the street
[1:13:16.020 --> 1:13:25.020]  and reporters run up demanding to talk to me and I just say sorry you're not real reporters just make up whatever you want I'm not going to sit for your interview
[1:13:25.020 --> 1:13:35.020]  so you can act like you did a real interview and pretend you're a journalist I'm not going to do it unless it's live now leave me alone
[1:13:35.020 --> 1:13:44.020]  but then they go further they just want to shut down media matters run by the Democrats and Soros publicly wants to be completely banned off Google and banned off YouTube
[1:13:44.020 --> 1:13:58.020]  banned off advertising I mean they're calling for my annihilation tortious interference classic but they don't care because they got the big war chest and they're arrogant but all over the world people are turning against Soros
[1:13:58.020 --> 1:14:15.020]  they're turning against globalists so I kind of set the table here I'm a lot to cover but I also want to ask our friend what areas he wants to get into and then Roger Stones coming up hosting the fourth hour stuff on Maladu free domain radio dot com stuff on Maladu on Twitter
[1:14:15.020 --> 1:14:22.020]  YouTube free domain radio as well a lot going on thanks for joining us via Skype I just threw a lot out there what do you want to tackle first
[1:14:22.020 --> 1:14:31.020]  oh let's just talk about the incipient victory of reason and evidence Alex I am pumped I'm thrilled today it's Brexit Day
[1:14:31.020 --> 1:14:43.020]  breaking free of the raft that is going over the Niagara into collectivized status nightmare so this I think is the beginning of the crack up of the EU I know there have been some setbacks but I think it's beautiful
[1:14:43.020 --> 1:14:57.020]  the fact that the EU this great collective mess that was foisted on Europe against the will of the citizenry they had to have referendum after referendum after vote till they got the one that they wanted the fact that this experiment is cracking up in a similar time frame
[1:14:57.020 --> 1:15:04.020]  that the Soviet Union cracked up shows that there is still reason and sanity in human affairs and I'm very excited about what's coming up
[1:15:04.020 --> 1:15:24.020]  I agree with you I mean clearly even globalist admit the tide's going out there in crisis their answers more wars and an alliance with Islam that can't even tie it shoelaces and they're constantly killing each other what the hell is the left with marches everywhere putting a jibs on women and I mean I can't even make something up this absurd
[1:15:24.020 --> 1:15:40.020]  well here's the thing right so this this collectivism that happened in Europe. Now the Democrats have a big problem in that they lost right they had a very experienced candidate running against the first time newbie and they lost so they have to come up with some reason that protects the elites as to why they lost
[1:15:40.020 --> 1:15:55.020]  so now it's all Russia and all this kind of crap right it's the same thing when you had two giant world wars in Europe in the 20th century within the space of a couple of decades the elites were facing rebellion within their own ranks so they had to make up this story as to why we we had all these
[1:15:55.020 --> 1:16:11.020]  terrible wars and 50 million people got killed and so on and their answer was Alex you know what caused these wars borders yes it's border so if we get rid of borders it's not the elite it's not the military industrial complex and it sure as hell isn't central banking never want to touch that it's
[1:16:11.020 --> 1:16:21.020]  borders like in other words if your home gets robbed the problem is your wall so if we take down your walls everything's going to be fine and so by the way in Austin zoning was fallacious
[1:16:21.020 --> 1:16:34.020]  in Austin zoning they are now under 21 not allowing walls on new homes or apartments no gates no nothing but the elites all live in the old part of the city and are building bigger walls you cannot make this up and of course since you mentioned
[1:16:34.020 --> 1:16:48.020]  the fact that absolutely globalism was the answer to these wars that they admittedly stirred up to bring in the League of Nations of the UN David Rockefeller who just died last week admitted in his memoirs reflections and other books he wrote that his family actually
[1:16:48.020 --> 1:17:03.020]  engineered this and they even helped fund Hitler and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute to control the full spectrum I mean talk about nastiness they don't want us to have nations so we can get together and resist their globalist operation
[1:17:03.020 --> 1:17:18.020]  well and people of course think that the EU was some spontaneous organization of the masses like oh we're facing giant consolidated totalitarianism on behind the Soviet block and so on so what we need is another giant layer of bureaucracy and central planning because that's how you fight communism
[1:17:18.020 --> 1:17:34.020]  it's the socialism I've never for the life of me understood that logic that's like fighting a headache by side cutting your own head off but of course it was the American elites who helped fund the origins of the EU it came out of precursors to the CIA they never funded less than half of the groups of advocating for it
[1:17:34.020 --> 1:17:45.020]  it is a globalist centralized CIA based collectivist nightmare and finally finally Europe seems to be waking up from this nightmare
[1:17:45.020 --> 1:17:50.020]  Stefan it's dangerous to pause for me because I'll run over you but look what you're saying
[1:17:50.020 --> 1:17:53.020]  I'm giving you room to speak Alex I feel it's the only simple thing to do
[1:17:53.020 --> 1:18:04.020]  what you're saying is not your opinion I mean you are literally stating reality and I love how they keep saying you know the right wing is in its own bubble the left wing is in its own bubble I'm not right wing but I didn't like Bush when he was doing they called me a leftist
[1:18:04.020 --> 1:18:19.020]  I'm a nationalist a common sense guy I'm somebody that wants sovereignty I want local government America isn't perfect with the Bill of Rights Constitution to help a lot better than what North Korea and you know Venezuela have look what's happening so it's not that America ever even reached 10% of its potential
[1:18:19.020 --> 1:18:28.020]  but it was going in the right direction and so I agree with you what's happening is prima facie it's not like we're here just making up our own narrative and we're the fake news
[1:18:28.020 --> 1:18:34.020]  no they have brought in 5 million Muslims 80% of our military age men they are running around like they own the place
[1:18:34.020 --> 1:18:42.020]  the left is literally bringing them in like reinforcements and Peter Sutherland of the EU and UN says they're trying to get rid of Europe because it has a middle class
[1:18:42.020 --> 1:18:56.020]  I mean what's weird is in their white papers they tell the truth and it's so crazy and so bad that in public they lie and I'm wondering why would the elite want to blow up the west that gives them this safety net for even elites
[1:18:56.020 --> 1:19:01.020]  why would they want to bring an authoritarianism when it's the most unstable system what the hell are they doing
[1:19:01.020 --> 1:19:16.020]  well people who are focused on political power or drug addicts right we know this from studies in monkeys that as you rise through the hierarchy of the ranks you get endorphins you get all of these wonderful happy brain joy juices flooding through your system
[1:19:16.020 --> 1:19:26.020]  and it becomes an you become an addict they literally are addicts of course they're not playing with their own money they're playing with our lives and the lives of our children and the security of our institutions
[1:19:26.020 --> 1:19:37.020]  but it's no you can't expect sense out of these people anymore that you can say well well that gambling addict why on earth would he end up losing his home losing his house losing his wife lying face down in a ditch with a dead hooker
[1:19:37.020 --> 1:19:45.020]  I mean that's what addicts do they continue to escalate until they're either cured or they crash and I think we're kind of poised between the two at the moment
[1:19:45.020 --> 1:19:55.020]  exactly so I see what you're saying globalism crony capitalism on fire the fake left backing globalism and trouble establishment right wing being voted out everywhere as well
[1:19:55.020 --> 1:20:02.020]  I mean I think Paul Ryan's probably worse than Pelosi because he's actually smart and then I see Pelosi will play the clip when we come back after a break in about 10 minutes
[1:20:02.020 --> 1:20:11.020]  she literally in multiple speeches thinks Bush is still president Maxine Waters thinks Russia invaded Korea doesn't even say north or south
[1:20:11.020 --> 1:20:19.020]  and then you can say oh we're cherry picking no that was in one press conference at what we don't even play they give me press conferences every couple days that's even crazier
[1:20:19.020 --> 1:20:33.020]  she is literally has neurological disorders I'm sad for she's clearly almost 80 she clearly you know has a lot of facelifts and stuff but the point is she's got a rotten brain and so does Maxine Waters and they are in command
[1:20:33.020 --> 1:20:38.020]  and I mean it's that to me that's what's horrifying is these people are out of their minds
[1:20:38.020 --> 1:20:46.020]  well there is a battle on I would say a big picture time is the battle is between those who are competent and those who are incompetent but greedy
[1:20:46.020 --> 1:20:51.020]  right like I'm incompetent and opera singing so I don't try and dominate the stage of the match I mean that's that's the way it was
[1:20:51.020 --> 1:21:05.020]  so incompetent people hate competition which is why everyone's trying to shut down alternative media these days because mainstream media is terrible wretched compromised and lacks even the basic integrity that would allow a snail to stay inside its own home
[1:21:05.020 --> 1:21:16.020]  and so in Europe and in other places they're trying to cut down competition between countries why is there so much centralization of regulation and control of a currency and control of interest rates in Brussels
[1:21:16.020 --> 1:21:28.020]  because they don't want individual countries to cut their rates and attract more investment because competition diminishes the power of centralized oligarchical authority and so they love layering more and more regulations
[1:21:28.020 --> 1:21:39.020]  this is why power tends to aggregate to the Fed to the federal government rather than allowing states to compete because California will keep spending and spending and spending but what's happening is so many people are fleeing California at some point
[1:21:39.020 --> 1:21:52.020]  they're going to run out of tax livestock so this movement to centralize and make sure everyone's running off the same standard is just a way for incompetent bureaucrats to never face competition from slightly more competent bureaucrats in other countries
[1:21:52.020 --> 1:22:11.020]  so let me ask you this again great opportunity global awakening happening but like you said they're incompetent but greedy I don't understand it I mean the more quote power I get the more concerned I am the more careful I am the more I watch what I say when I say something wrong I apologize for it
[1:22:11.020 --> 1:22:23.020]  you know I have children I guess I'm getting older but as I get more quote power I feel more humble and like a steward thinking about the whole species I don't say that that goody two shoes it's really true
[1:22:23.020 --> 1:22:33.020]  then I watch these people that claim they care about everybody but as you know statistically we're not left to right but using that paradigm leftist and Canadian studies British studies six seven times more likely to steal
[1:22:33.020 --> 1:22:45.020]  but just but many more times likely just to to to virtue signal that they're actually giving and telling everyone how to act and then I think back when I was like 18 my mom threw me out of the house I just graduated high school
[1:22:45.020 --> 1:22:57.020]  and we'd moved houses and you know she bought some oriental rugs that today I think are awesome looking and I was like I don't like these well why don't they that color my mom looked at my dad she goes David get him the hell out of here
[1:22:57.020 --> 1:23:06.020]  and she's also mad I was bringing my girlfriends in to make it you know they were being rude to her in the kitchen or whatever and so she's like you know get him the hell out of here she loves me but it's time for you to be gone buddy
[1:23:06.020 --> 1:23:16.020]  so it was only at that point that I genetically needed to have my own house that I was telling my mother what to do and I think it's the same thing they've never built their own houses so of course they want to micromanage everybody else's
[1:23:16.020 --> 1:23:24.020]  because once you have your own family have your own house have your own friends you would never get involved with somebody else because you're too busy with your own life
[1:23:24.020 --> 1:23:38.020]  well here's the thing Alex I mean I think I can speak for both of us our power as you call it is not coercive it's not political we can't force anyone to do a damn thing we can't force people to listen we can't force people to support you can't force people to buy it
[1:23:38.020 --> 1:23:42.020]  I don't want them to I mean it's like I don't want them to get in bed with you because she wants you you don't want to rape her
[1:23:42.020 --> 1:23:56.020]  so yeah our authority is earned through slowly gathered credibility in the free market of ideas and yes we make mistakes we have to backtrack we're human beings and that's natural if we claim to never make mistakes we would have as much credibility as the mainstream media
[1:23:56.020 --> 1:24:14.020]  so your power which is influences gained incrementally over the course of many years of interacting in the free market you have a reputation which as you know takes decades to build and can take 10 minutes to completely destroy it's not the same as political power what we have is an addiction in a sense to communication through truth
[1:24:14.020 --> 1:24:24.020]  but we're not dependent upon any coercion for our audience so we don't have that kind of corrupting power we have earned influence power through hopefully being correct more than we're wrong
[1:24:24.020 --> 1:24:31.020]  and again this is not about stuff I'm all in there Alex Jones but you're a leading guy reaches tens of millions a week from millions a week probably hundreds of millions a week soon
[1:24:31.020 --> 1:24:45.020]  10 of Paul Watson and I just get excited seeing you become even more popular Paul other people but somebody other talks to us I get around them and they are just obsessed with it being them them them even if they have a good message they're blinded by the competition
[1:24:45.020 --> 1:24:59.020]  not realizing the greater competition is against the globalist and then wanting to end competition so I get a thrill out of a guy that's got a super gorgeous wife or a really cool painting they've painted I admire them I don't get upset by their skill
[1:24:59.020 --> 1:25:17.020]  and again talking about us some of the different types that are out there so that we can all psychoanalyze ourselves but also what's happening in the world because I just don't understand people that want to pull everybody else down so they can be on top instead why don't we lift everybody else up but don't take something for me that you steal
[1:25:17.020 --> 1:25:30.020]  then they call that greatness that I want to be independent and my own person like I value my individualism so much that I guess it's a cult of individualism and then I see con artist ripping people off and it pisses me off so you're you're a smart guy when it comes to this
[1:25:30.020 --> 1:25:37.020]  and I think we're similar in this what what do you call that then and how do we get other people infected with that
[1:25:37.020 --> 1:25:51.020]  you know when I was in high school I wrote a couple of plays and I was in a theater group and we did rehearsals and once we went to a friend of mine's place and man his family was like loaded beyond anything you could conceive of I mean I've never seen that kind of wealth
[1:25:51.020 --> 1:26:02.020]  I certainly hadn't before and I was like I was at his house looking around and I grew up you know very very poor single mom households and all that kind of stuff and I looked at all of that stuff I tell you Alex
[1:26:02.020 --> 1:26:12.020]  I looked at that and I thought you know I'd like to get me some of that when I get over this is really nice I didn't feel resentful I felt enthusiastic I felt empowered I felt like
[1:26:12.020 --> 1:26:20.020]  wow this is what is available in life maybe I could go out and get me some and then I became an entrepreneur the software field built a company sold a company and so on
[1:26:20.020 --> 1:26:29.020]  and that I think is the difference whereas some people I had another guy who came over who basically was resentful and sour and saying everything negative about this guy's place and he said
[1:26:29.020 --> 1:26:36.020]  you know the only reason this guy has stuff is that there's a hundred poorer people in the world and I said no it's not a pie
[1:26:36.020 --> 1:26:45.020]  it's not a pie like I get more you get less it's growth if I have a kid it's not like I've stolen children from someone else I've made that kid with my wife myself
[1:26:45.020 --> 1:26:54.020]  this made a new cool entity that can interface with their kids you've made the world richer and that's the thing all the statistics all the historians all the economists admit
[1:26:54.020 --> 1:27:05.020]  I mean probably 99% of them are communists that when you create incredible wealth it's not based on slavery free market it then builds the lowest base of the poor go up even higher
[1:27:05.020 --> 1:27:13.020]  no one can debate that so but again we have the ultra rich who are promoting anti wealth because they don't want competition and they even admit it
[1:27:13.020 --> 1:27:20.020]  and that's what's so frustrating in fact did you ever notice losers would see somebody that won the baseball game or won the football game or had the best looking girlfriend
[1:27:20.020 --> 1:27:28.020]  or you go over to somebody's house they've got an Olympic size pool that's bigger than your dad's house you're thinking man this is really great I love hanging out here boy I want to stay friends with this person
[1:27:28.020 --> 1:27:35.020]  because they're so fun you know how they got a private jet isn't that cool and then you bring your buddy over with them they're like yeah these people are scum you know I heard they're getting divorced
[1:27:35.020 --> 1:27:48.020]  you know I heard he's a loser they'll like say somebody successful as a loser so they feel good about themselves and that was the ickiest thing that I saw losers were always attacking winners just making crap up so they'd feel good
[1:27:48.020 --> 1:27:58.020]  well but it's a great way of gaining strategies it's a great strategy for gaining resources if you don't want to go out and earn them yourself right so I had a comment on my YouTube channel the other day
[1:27:58.020 --> 1:28:06.020]  because I've done a truth about sort of Native Americans and the relationship that they had the indigenous Americans with the Europeans and so on and someone just posted underneath and they said
[1:28:06.020 --> 1:28:14.020]  when will white people stop feeling guilty about things they weren't even alive for and it's like well when we stop paying for it you know because it's a great resource
[1:28:14.020 --> 1:28:22.020]  if you can convince a rich person that he's rich because his family stole from you then he may cough up resources through the state or through charity to give to you
[1:28:22.020 --> 1:28:30.020]  it's a way of getting resources without actually having to go through the effort of earning them yourself by inflicting guilt and self-attack on other people
[1:28:30.020 --> 1:28:37.020]  it's you know it's amoral at best but it's a fairly decent strategy for just getting resources if you kind of suck in general
[1:28:37.020 --> 1:28:46.020]  it is crazy there's a lot of news topics to cover and I've already thrown a lot of points when we come back to Stefan what do you want to hit first
[1:28:46.020 --> 1:28:52.020]  oh yeah well let's talk about Michael Moore let's talk about global warming let's mix it all up with that kind of stuff
[1:28:52.020 --> 1:28:58.020]  in the minute we have though getting back to the Native Americans I have a little bit of Native American me I'm proud of the Native American it's great
[1:28:58.020 --> 1:29:06.020]  but I've studied the history I mean they would come and say we're going to kill you if you don't help fight this other tribe they were just as barbarous and out of control as the Europeans
[1:29:06.020 --> 1:29:13.020]  and how they're like made like these little sweet saints by the media it's it's total crap and I had family that was in the Trail of Tears
[1:29:13.020 --> 1:29:21.020]  and because there wasn't just one folks I mean I've got Comanche background and you know that's like the coolest Indian by the way you know all the other stuff
[1:29:21.020 --> 1:29:26.020]  that's Native American whatever I'll use the political incorrect term it doesn't matter it's just that none of the real history is there
[1:29:26.020 --> 1:29:33.020]  so let's briefly talk about that some after we get into Michael Moore and so much more and talk about how will the globalist strike back though
[1:29:33.020 --> 1:29:41.020]  we're not going to give up we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen on the other side info wars.com forward slash show spread that link if you want to see the truth about Native Americans
[1:29:41.020 --> 1:30:07.020]  go see the movie The Revenant that's very very accurate we'll be back stay with us.
[1:30:12.020 --> 1:30:21.020]  Donald Trump in order to gather intelligence for political purposes get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration
[1:30:21.020 --> 1:30:32.020]  Trump folks if they found out how we knew what we knew about their the staff the Trump staffs dealing with Russians that they would try to compromise those sources and methods
[1:30:32.020 --> 1:30:40.020]  meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence then I had talked to some of my former colleagues and I knew that they were trying to also help get information to the help
[1:30:40.020 --> 1:30:51.020]  well it appears Ms. Farkas was so caught up in the discussion that she didn't even realize the significant admissions she was making about Obama spying on Trump's team
[1:30:51.020 --> 1:31:11.020]  and releasing classified intelligence to the public that's why you have a leaking and you can learn more right now at info wars.com

[1:32:06.020 --> 1:32:09.020]  Dr. Group you took years for you to develop DNA force for us
[1:32:09.020 --> 1:32:15.020]  it's been something that I've been working on for a long time Alex because I think it's very very important
[1:32:15.020 --> 1:32:21.020]  what the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our telomeres
[1:32:21.020 --> 1:32:24.020]  telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes
[1:32:24.020 --> 1:32:26.020]  and when it runs out you start dying
[1:32:26.020 --> 1:32:30.020]  we chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials

[1:32:35.020 --> 1:32:38.020]  it works to repair nerve growth factor
[1:32:38.020 --> 1:32:41.020]  so this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount

[1:33:00.020 --> 1:33:13.020]  this is a island that at its widest level is what 12 miles from shore to shore
[1:33:13.020 --> 1:33:29.020]  and at a smallest level or smallest location it's seven miles between one shore and the other
[1:33:29.020 --> 1:33:31.020]  is that correct?
[1:33:31.020 --> 1:33:37.020]  I don't have the exact dimensions but to your point sir I think Guam is a small island
[1:33:37.020 --> 1:33:50.020]  my fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize
[1:33:50.020 --> 1:33:59.020]  I stand here as a freed slave
[1:33:59.020 --> 1:34:05.020]  we've seen nothing that we can work but I can work with President Bush on and I'm disappointed
[1:34:05.020 --> 1:34:11.020]  because I thought that there might be some interest because of what he said in the campaign
[1:34:11.020 --> 1:34:13.020]  what are we going to do?
[1:34:13.020 --> 1:34:21.020]  How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting whether he's talking about the travel ban
[1:34:21.020 --> 1:34:27.020]  the way that he's targeting Muslims or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin
[1:34:27.020 --> 1:34:35.020]  and the Kremlin and knowing that they have hacked our DCCC and DNC
[1:34:35.020 --> 1:34:44.020]  and knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families
[1:34:44.020 --> 1:34:47.020]  and...
[1:34:47.020 --> 1:34:48.020]  What is Aleppo?
[1:34:48.020 --> 1:34:50.020]  Yeah, in Aleppo
[1:34:53.020 --> 1:34:55.020]  You are correct
[1:34:58.020 --> 1:34:59.020]  Way to go
[1:34:59.020 --> 1:35:10.020]  The fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea
[1:35:19.020 --> 1:35:23.020]  We're going back to Stefan Malinu of freedomandradio.com here in just a moment
[1:35:23.020 --> 1:35:31.020]  I'm going to show your host, do I have to tell you they're attacking us, they take anything I do and they twist it
[1:35:31.020 --> 1:35:36.020]  they edit what I say, I'm not anti-gay, they cut it and say I'm anti-gay
[1:35:36.020 --> 1:35:42.020]  on co-bear, I mean it's just unbelievable, that's because we're so effective, I'm proud of that
[1:35:42.020 --> 1:35:46.020]  Now they're also trying to intimidate everybody else, like if you criticize us we're going to come after you
[1:35:46.020 --> 1:35:52.020]  Good, you're so discredited, you've got the dumbest people to still believe you at 60 minutes and all the rest of it
[1:35:52.020 --> 1:35:56.020]  Go ahead and make up whatever steaming piles of bologna you want to
[1:35:56.020 --> 1:36:01.020]  I'm not worried about it, I'm looking for thinking people of every race, color and creed
[1:36:01.020 --> 1:36:07.020]  It's so frustrating though to see those that fall to the brainwashing and all the editing and the rest of crap
[1:36:07.020 --> 1:36:11.020]  They're pushing their censorship, I'm going to ask Stefan in a minute where he thinks that's going
[1:36:11.020 --> 1:36:16.020]  But we shall, I go out and research the very best gravity fence filters, Pro Pure, Alexa Pure
[1:36:16.020 --> 1:36:23.020]  The very best out there that have the 9999 this and 100% that, hundreds and hundreds of chemicals in the food and water
[1:36:23.020 --> 1:36:28.020]  The biggest thing you do for yourself and your family is the water you cook with and everything else you should put through a gravity fence filter
[1:36:28.020 --> 1:36:35.020]  Reverse osmosis is good as well but it cuts out the good minerals, so that's a backup, I have that too
[1:36:35.020 --> 1:36:39.020]  But you can find a whole bunch of different really great systems, the lowest prices out there
[1:36:39.020 --> 1:36:41.020]  And support the broadcast and free speech and what we're doing

[1:36:52.020 --> 1:36:59.020]  Because they get targeted by the Democratic Party and the media and the corporations of the banks
[1:36:59.020 --> 1:37:04.020]  They just openly racketeer together and say just shut them down or we're going to shut you down
[1:37:04.020 --> 1:37:07.020]  We're going to take your banking license, we're going to come after your newspaper
[1:37:07.020 --> 1:37:13.020]  You know, we're not going to let you promote what you're doing because it's popular, it's good
[1:37:13.020 --> 1:37:19.020]  So we have a super combo, get survival shield, the good halogen, X2, nation iodine and bio tricillinium
[1:37:19.020 --> 1:37:24.020]  We got the very strongest mustard seed organic certified best lab in the country
[1:37:24.020 --> 1:37:29.020]  It's like $10 less than crap stuff, they sell it whole foods, I mean it's just so good
[1:37:29.020 --> 1:37:34.020]  Super combo, so get those two things go together, now here's the deal
[1:37:34.020 --> 1:37:44.020]  Talk to your doctor about this because selenium is so powerful that it will get you souped up
[1:37:44.020 --> 1:37:46.020]  But you can't take too much selenium
[1:37:46.020 --> 1:37:52.020]  When it comes to X2, if you've been deficient in the good halogen and everything else, your thyroid stuff
[1:37:52.020 --> 1:37:58.020]  Full of bad halogens like fluoride and bromine, bromide, that's what they'll absorb
[1:37:58.020 --> 1:38:00.020]  There could be some fireworks
[1:38:00.020 --> 1:38:04.020]  And this is one of the only things when it talks about iodine that the CDC admits
[1:38:04.020 --> 1:38:09.020]  They'll have way lower IQs, deformities, you name it, in utero if you don't have enough iodine
[1:38:09.020 --> 1:38:14.020]  You've got to have selenium, you've got to have iodine, but if you've not had it, you've been deficient a while
[1:38:14.020 --> 1:38:20.020]  It's like, just get ready, because I mean mother nature's got some compounds that'll blow you away
[1:38:20.020 --> 1:38:27.020]  Almost all the stuff you get at stores is synthetic, it's got to be organic, it's got to be bioidentical for you to absorb
[1:38:27.020 --> 1:38:31.020]  But I've never liked the medical stuff about growth hormone, you get synthetic growth hormone, you don't absorb it
[1:38:31.020 --> 1:38:33.020]  You've got to get the real stuff
[1:38:33.020 --> 1:38:38.020]  And it's the same thing with all this, InfowarsLive.com or888-2533139
[1:38:38.020 --> 1:38:44.020]  InfowarsStore.com is the umbrella site for amazing survival goods, camping goods, preparedness goods

[1:38:50.020 --> 1:38:58.020]  Also, we've got silver bullet, colloidal silver, amazing, everybody knows about colloidal silver, maybe the biggest lab in the country
[1:38:58.020 --> 1:39:02.020]  They're the folks, you know, private label for Whole Foods, ours is $5 less
[1:39:02.020 --> 1:39:07.020]  Just pointing that out, very same stuff, same factory, top factory in the country
[1:39:07.020 --> 1:39:11.020]  And it's got so many great uses and it stores for a long time, 40% off
[1:39:11.020 --> 1:39:14.020]  That'll be sent out in the newsletter today, we sent out exclusive videos, articles, you name it
[1:39:14.020 --> 1:39:18.020]  But then trying to censor us more and more, if we go super low tech and they shut off Infowars
[1:39:18.020 --> 1:39:24.020]  We'll be communicating with you via email, so be sure to sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com
[1:39:24.020 --> 1:39:31.020]  Okay, Stefan, I really want to try to shut up and just mention topics and have you cover them in the 20 minutes or 25 minutes
[1:39:31.020 --> 1:39:35.020]  We've got left with you here before you go to your own work at FreedomainRadio.com
[1:39:35.020 --> 1:39:41.020]  Let's just start here with the censorship, I know you're confident, it's not an act, we are winning
[1:39:41.020 --> 1:39:48.020]  But they're saying use the Federal Elections Commission to sooth Rods and shut him down
[1:39:48.020 --> 1:39:52.020]  As if our speech that say pro-gun is then political speech, so it's regulated
[1:39:52.020 --> 1:39:56.020]  You can't regulate free speech, they just call it political and they claim jurisdiction
[1:39:56.020 --> 1:40:01.020]  They're saying shut me down, they kicked us off Adroll, now they want Google to kick us off the Google ads
[1:40:01.020 --> 1:40:07.020]  This is official Democratic Party, George Soros groups saying in lobbying, they admit they're lobbying
[1:40:07.020 --> 1:40:12.020]  The listeners need to understand, this isn't a game, so like you said, they're losing the intellectual battle
[1:40:12.020 --> 1:40:17.020]  That's why as cornered rats, they're so dangerous
[1:40:17.020 --> 1:40:26.020]  Well, there's an old saying that Churchill had 1941 and 1942 when England began to, or the Allies began to have some successes against Nazi Germany
[1:40:26.020 --> 1:40:31.020]  People were like, ah, the end is inside and he says, nope, nope, this is not the end
[1:40:31.020 --> 1:40:35.020]  It is not even the beginning of the end, it may however be the end of the beginning
[1:40:35.020 --> 1:40:39.020]  And it's the old saying goes, they only shoot at you when you're over the target, right?
[1:40:39.020 --> 1:40:43.020]  You're dumping bombs in the ocean, they don't care, but if you're over the target, they care
[1:40:43.020 --> 1:40:49.020]  So the degree of opposition is the degree of our success and it's going to get worse before it gets better
[1:40:49.020 --> 1:40:55.020]  The left is fully aware of the role that alternative media has played in fighting collectivism
[1:40:55.020 --> 1:41:01.020]  In bringing Donald Trump into the White House, in Brexit and the upcoming elections in France and other places
[1:41:01.020 --> 1:41:07.020]  They know and they understand how much power we have, how much influence we have, and how much better we are
[1:41:07.020 --> 1:41:10.020]  Because you don't try and censor people that you're better than
[1:41:10.020 --> 1:41:13.020]  Like it's the runner who's really fast, who's going to beat you in the race
[1:41:13.020 --> 1:41:17.020]  That you may want to plant something in his bag so he looks better
[1:41:17.020 --> 1:41:21.020]  If you're confident you can win, you don't bother with this stuff, so they don't think they can win and they're right
[1:41:21.020 --> 1:41:25.020]  So they're going to use all of these kinds of tricks and tools, but I think we can get the information out
[1:41:25.020 --> 1:41:32.020]  In a powerful and compelling and wide-reaching enough way to illuminate them for who they are and what they're doing
[1:41:32.020 --> 1:41:36.020]  They're not friends of freedom, they're not friends of the future, they're not friends of free speech
[1:41:36.020 --> 1:41:41.020]  They're not friends of truth and reason and evidence of all the accumulated glories of Western civilization
[1:41:41.020 --> 1:41:48.020]  They are trying to drag the West back down into a very dark, very nasty medieval collectivist hole
[1:41:48.020 --> 1:41:52.020]  And we have to fight like hell to keep from dragging down there
[1:41:52.020 --> 1:41:55.020]  Because once we get down there with the surveillance technology that we have now
[1:41:55.020 --> 1:41:58.020]  It's hard to see how we could ever get back out
[1:41:58.020 --> 1:42:05.020]  Beautifully said, looking at this, our biggest enemies ourselves
[1:42:05.020 --> 1:42:10.020]  If they finally capitulate and start to collapse, they've already admitted economic terror they're trying
[1:42:10.020 --> 1:42:13.020]  I think that's the greatest weakness that they admit with Brexit and the US
[1:42:13.020 --> 1:42:18.020]  They're using economic warfare to try to hurt the economy to make us not like Trump or nationalism
[1:42:18.020 --> 1:42:23.020]  They've gone from this whole invincibility with MSM saying they didn't exist
[1:42:23.020 --> 1:42:26.020]  To now admitting world governments falling apart and it's unelected
[1:42:26.020 --> 1:42:30.020]  I just don't see how they ever thought it was going to go on
[1:42:30.020 --> 1:42:35.020]  Or how Zuckerberg, who thinks he's going to transcend and become some god, or Ray Kurzweil
[1:42:35.020 --> 1:42:40.020]  How these guys, it's like they thought they could take hundreds of acres of people's land in Kauai
[1:42:40.020 --> 1:42:43.020]  That was native land and just owned by people
[1:42:43.020 --> 1:42:48.020]  Surrounding his 700 acres, he wanted more, so Zuckerberg, who calls his users dumb efs
[1:42:48.020 --> 1:42:51.020]  Just thought he'd take it, he finally had to back off
[1:42:51.020 --> 1:42:55.020]  It's like, don't they understand that at the end of the day
[1:42:55.020 --> 1:42:59.020]  When they try to dumb us down, it only blows back on them?
[1:42:59.020 --> 1:43:05.020]  Well, it's just tourism from history that those from the old world never see the new world until it's too late
[1:43:05.020 --> 1:43:08.020]  And that's why we have to double down more than ever
[1:43:08.020 --> 1:43:11.020]  Commit to reaching more people, to be more engaging, to be more entertaining
[1:43:11.020 --> 1:43:14.020]  More entertaining for me sometimes, just to be more goofy
[1:43:14.020 --> 1:43:19.020]  I'll sing to you in Japanese, whatever it takes to entertain people and keep them engaged in the conversation
[1:43:19.020 --> 1:43:23.020]  Is what we need to do, because it is civilization hanging in the balance
[1:43:23.020 --> 1:43:26.020]  We win now, I think we win forever
[1:43:26.020 --> 1:43:28.020]  We lose now, I think we lose forever
[1:43:28.020 --> 1:43:34.020]  The stakes to me are that high, and I am incredibly honored and pleased to be part of this movement
[1:43:34.020 --> 1:43:37.020]  To bring truth, reason, and proven evidence to the world
[1:43:37.020 --> 1:43:40.020]  We are definitely at the crossroads of the species
[1:43:40.020 --> 1:43:43.020]  Yes, and the lies are all falling apart
[1:43:43.020 --> 1:43:45.020]  Michael Moore is screaming about...
[1:43:45.020 --> 1:43:49.020]  Well, to me it's kind of ironic that Michael Moore is screaming about excessive energy consumption
[1:43:49.020 --> 1:43:55.020]  I'd like to see that man attack a buffet, like a great white in a herd of dolphins
[1:43:55.020 --> 1:43:58.020]  But there's this lies all coming apart
[1:43:58.020 --> 1:44:02.020]  They say, oh, we're really terrified about what the temperature might be in 100 years
[1:44:02.020 --> 1:44:07.020]  But what about the national debt? What about the close to $200 trillion America has in unfunded liabilities?
[1:44:07.020 --> 1:44:10.020]  A massive, multi-million dollar nuisance chain around the unborn
[1:44:10.020 --> 1:44:13.020]  Do they not care about that? No, they don't care about that
[1:44:13.020 --> 1:44:16.020]  They care about whether it's one or two degrees higher in 100 years
[1:44:16.020 --> 1:44:20.020]  Oh, it's just them scripting themselves as a savior
[1:44:20.020 --> 1:44:22.020]  I mean, they even admit they're on internal documents
[1:44:22.020 --> 1:44:26.020]  It's all a fraud to take control of all energy, then pick winners and losers
[1:44:26.020 --> 1:44:30.020]  It's the ultimate wicked, villainous energy control plan
[1:44:30.020 --> 1:44:38.020]  Well, and this is what Trump has done that I hugely admire is keystone pipeline and loosening restrictions on coal
[1:44:38.020 --> 1:44:41.020]  Look, a civilization requires energy consumption
[1:44:41.020 --> 1:44:43.020]  That's just the basic reality of it
[1:44:43.020 --> 1:44:46.020]  We're either going to get our energy domestically in North America
[1:44:46.020 --> 1:44:50.020]  Or we're going to ship billions and billions and hundreds of billions of dollars over
[1:44:50.020 --> 1:44:51.020]  To China
[1:44:51.020 --> 1:44:55.020]  To theocratic dictatorships that have been implicated in directly funding terrorism around the world
[1:44:55.020 --> 1:44:56.020]  We either...
[1:44:56.020 --> 1:44:57.020]  Oh, that's my next question
[1:44:57.020 --> 1:45:00.020] ...have jobs ourselves and have incomes ourselves
[1:45:00.020 --> 1:45:04.020]  Or we shovel untold amounts of money to theocratic dictatorships who wish us harm
[1:45:04.020 --> 1:45:06.020]  There's no third option
[1:45:06.020 --> 1:45:10.020]  And the fact that Middle Eastern countries have been shown to be funding certain environmental groups
[1:45:10.020 --> 1:45:14.020]  Is because they want to put the big green barrier up to energy independence in the West
[1:45:14.020 --> 1:45:17.020]  So they can continue to get our money so they can fund groups to attack us
[1:45:17.020 --> 1:45:23.020]  And that to me, it's almost treasonous to freedom to have nothing but opposition
[1:45:23.020 --> 1:45:25.020]  To energy independence from the Middle East
[1:45:25.020 --> 1:45:31.020]  And I feel very strongly about that because I can see the pictures of the people who die from these kinds of attacks
[1:45:31.020 --> 1:45:34.020]  What do you make of Washington D.C. put a little humble memorial
[1:45:34.020 --> 1:45:35.020]  It ought to be bigger than the Washington Monument
[1:45:35.020 --> 1:45:37.020]  For those that died at the hands of communism
[1:45:37.020 --> 1:45:39.020]  The biggest mass murdering regime in history
[1:45:39.020 --> 1:45:42.020]  Conservatively 150 million people last century alone
[1:45:42.020 --> 1:45:44.020]  Then it's where they collapse and everything else
[1:45:44.020 --> 1:45:47.020]  And then a bunch of trendies came out and flipped it off
[1:45:47.020 --> 1:45:50.020]  Saying there's no such thing as victims of communism
[1:45:50.020 --> 1:45:51.020]  What the hell?
[1:45:51.020 --> 1:45:53.020]  What about 60 million Chinese farmers?
[1:45:53.020 --> 1:45:56.020]  What about other 20 million killed by the Chai comms?
[1:45:56.020 --> 1:45:59.020]  Innocent people collectivized and murdered
[1:45:59.020 --> 1:46:02.020]  And David Rockefeller wrote New York Times articles praising it
[1:46:02.020 --> 1:46:05.020]  Now these people, these scumbags
[1:46:05.020 --> 1:46:08.020]  I mean they live in the lap of freedom
[1:46:08.020 --> 1:46:11.020]  Bitching and saying we want North Korea
[1:46:11.020 --> 1:46:12.020]  I mean these people are sick
[1:46:12.020 --> 1:46:14.020]  What do you make of that?
[1:46:14.020 --> 1:46:16.020]  I think it's pure sadism
[1:46:16.020 --> 1:46:19.020]  It is pure horrifying human joy
[1:46:19.020 --> 1:46:22.020]  And the destruction of other people's aspirations and hopes and freedoms
[1:46:22.020 --> 1:46:25.020]  I don't know what kind of toxicity in childhood or in the womb
[1:46:25.020 --> 1:46:30.020]  Or what happens to people that turned them that rancid in their souls
[1:46:30.020 --> 1:46:33.020]  But there have been studies where they show people horrifying injuries
[1:46:33.020 --> 1:46:36.020]  Nails being put through people's hands in simulated ways and so on
[1:46:36.020 --> 1:46:39.020]  And there's a certain small section of the population Alex
[1:46:39.020 --> 1:46:41.020]  Their happy centers light up
[1:46:41.020 --> 1:46:43.020]  Their little brain orgasm centers light up
[1:46:43.020 --> 1:46:46.020]  That's what makes them happy is crushing hopes, crushing aspirations
[1:46:46.020 --> 1:46:49.020]  And of course those who want to commission future crimes
[1:46:49.020 --> 1:46:52.020]  They must bury the bodies of past crimes so nobody can see what they have in store
[1:46:52.020 --> 1:46:54.020]  If everyone knew where communism led to
[1:46:54.020 --> 1:46:57.020]  Which is a higher death count by far
[1:46:57.020 --> 1:46:58.020]  By far than Nazism
[1:46:58.020 --> 1:47:01.020]  It is the most destructive and toxic ideology the world has ever seen
[1:47:01.020 --> 1:47:02.020]  That's not theological
[1:47:02.020 --> 1:47:04.020]  Conservative over 150 million
[1:47:04.020 --> 1:47:05.020]  Well let's expand
[1:47:05.020 --> 1:47:07.020]  Countries that actually were through hardcore communism
[1:47:07.020 --> 1:47:10.020]  Even the communist in China apologized for Malin, his wife
[1:47:10.020 --> 1:47:12.020]  And say he went too far
[1:47:12.020 --> 1:47:15.020]  The Soviets had big debates and apologized for Lenin
[1:47:15.020 --> 1:47:17.020]  And Stalin
[1:47:17.020 --> 1:47:20.020]  They say no, it's perfect, it's wonderful
[1:47:20.020 --> 1:47:23.020]  And f victims of communism
[1:47:23.020 --> 1:47:26.020]  Most of them poor farmers didn't even know what it was
[1:47:26.020 --> 1:47:30.020]  And just look at these people, they are such enemies
[1:47:30.020 --> 1:47:33.020]  Well this is how you know that there's no such thing as zombies Alex
[1:47:33.020 --> 1:47:37.020]  Because if there were, every time one of these douchebags opened their mouths
[1:47:37.020 --> 1:47:41.020]  There would be millions of post-Soviet death zombies
[1:47:41.020 --> 1:47:43.020]  Rising back up from the Holodomir and Ukraine
[1:47:43.020 --> 1:47:47.020]  And there would be millions of them just trying to find and eat their brains
[1:47:47.020 --> 1:47:49.020]  And coming up completely empty handed
[1:47:49.020 --> 1:47:52.020]  It is an unbelievably vicious and evil ideology
[1:47:52.020 --> 1:47:55.020]  And the fact that there are out and out communists teaching all over the place
[1:47:55.020 --> 1:47:58.020]  In universities and think tanks and someone
[1:47:58.020 --> 1:48:00.020]  I was taught by a particular Marxist professor
[1:48:00.020 --> 1:48:01.020]  He wore a little badge of Marx
[1:48:01.020 --> 1:48:03.020]  You can't conceivably be a Nazi
[1:48:03.020 --> 1:48:06.020]  Out there teaching national socialist ideology
[1:48:06.020 --> 1:48:08.020]  But you can be a communist which has a higher death count
[1:48:08.020 --> 1:48:10.020]  And that is the challenge
[1:48:10.020 --> 1:48:12.020]  That is all the stuff we need to expose
[1:48:12.020 --> 1:48:14.020]  But the crime is being planned to come
[1:48:14.020 --> 1:48:17.020]  Exactly, big universities funded by big foundations
[1:48:17.020 --> 1:48:20.020]  The money of the robber barons, creating communism
[1:48:20.020 --> 1:48:22.020]  And these sick little mental patient professors
[1:48:22.020 --> 1:48:26.020]  That couldn't build a barn or run a sandwich shop
[1:48:26.020 --> 1:48:28.020]  Or wipe their own asses
[1:48:28.020 --> 1:48:30.020]  And I'm not a violent guy and I'm not calling for violence
[1:48:30.020 --> 1:48:33.020]  But I see them saying kill Trump, overthrow, murder
[1:48:33.020 --> 1:48:35.020]  We got the article on M4s.com
[1:48:35.020 --> 1:48:38.020]  Where the deep state is openly saying we're preparing to overthrow Trump
[1:48:38.020 --> 1:48:40.020]  We're going to go after opposition
[1:48:40.020 --> 1:48:43.020]  And it's always little wimps fantasizing about violence
[1:48:43.020 --> 1:48:45.020]  I mean, imagine those little wimps
[1:48:45.020 --> 1:48:47.020]  They're desecrating a memorial to the dead
[1:48:47.020 --> 1:48:49.020]  And people actually showed up and said
[1:48:49.020 --> 1:48:50.020]  Just with bare fists, let's go
[1:48:50.020 --> 1:48:52.020]  Oh, they call it hate crimes everywhere
[1:48:52.020 --> 1:48:55.020]  They want to push ideologies that murder people in mass
[1:48:55.020 --> 1:48:57.020]  But they're going to scream bloody murder
[1:48:57.020 --> 1:48:59.020]  If people start kicking their asses
[1:48:59.020 --> 1:49:01.020]  And I'm sorry, at a fundamental level
[1:49:01.020 --> 1:49:03.020]  I see them as rat-like enemies
[1:49:03.020 --> 1:49:05.020]  And just my heart starts beating
[1:49:05.020 --> 1:49:09.020]  They are pencil-necked Iagos to the Othello of the state
[1:49:09.020 --> 1:49:12.020]  So what they want to do is they want to put out all their poisons
[1:49:12.020 --> 1:49:13.020]  And their blogs and their articles
[1:49:13.020 --> 1:49:14.020]  They want to put all this poison out
[1:49:14.020 --> 1:49:16.020]  Trump is Hitler, it's the end of the world
[1:49:16.020 --> 1:49:19.020]  If we know it, he's bringing about the extinction of the human race
[1:49:19.020 --> 1:49:21.020]  By allowing people to burn coal instead of buying...
[1:49:21.020 --> 1:49:23.020]  Run for the hills, Rome's dead!
[1:49:23.020 --> 1:49:26.020]  Yeah, and so what happens is then they get people so inflamed
[1:49:26.020 --> 1:49:29.020]  That other people act out their homicidal fantasies
[1:49:29.020 --> 1:49:32.020]  And then the memorial to dead people
[1:49:32.020 --> 1:49:34.020]  Convinces a boyfriend to go beat him up
[1:49:34.020 --> 1:49:35.020]  And then the memorial to dead people
[1:49:35.020 --> 1:49:37.020]  You got to go piss on it
[1:49:37.020 --> 1:49:39.020]  That's the thing about the communists locally
[1:49:39.020 --> 1:49:41.020]  They go attack the Blue Cat Cafe
[1:49:41.020 --> 1:49:42.020]  It was in an empty lot
[1:49:42.020 --> 1:49:45.020]  It's a cat sanctuary, it's become popular in East Austin
[1:49:45.020 --> 1:49:47.020]  It's owned by these total liberals
[1:49:47.020 --> 1:49:49.020]  I've actually been there before
[1:49:49.020 --> 1:49:51.020]  I don't want to give a little story, we're going to adopt a cat
[1:49:51.020 --> 1:49:52.020]  We got one somewhere else
[1:49:52.020 --> 1:49:53.020]  And we're sitting there
[1:49:53.020 --> 1:49:55.020]  The communists put glue in the keyhole
[1:49:55.020 --> 1:49:56.020]  So you can't feed the cats
[1:49:56.020 --> 1:49:58.020]  Knock the windows out, attack it
[1:49:58.020 --> 1:50:01.020]  And it's like, be as nasty as they can
[1:50:01.020 --> 1:50:03.020]  Be as nasty as they can
[1:50:03.020 --> 1:50:05.020]  It's like, what cult are they from?
[1:50:05.020 --> 1:50:07.020]  Well, if a commie wants to get close to a pussy
[1:50:07.020 --> 1:50:09.020]  All he has to do is look in the mirror
[1:50:09.020 --> 1:50:10.020]  As far as I'm concerned
[1:50:10.020 --> 1:50:11.020]  I hear you, man
[1:50:11.020 --> 1:50:13.020]  It is a cowardly and brutal ideology
[1:50:13.020 --> 1:50:14.020]  If you want to go steal from someone
[1:50:14.020 --> 1:50:16.020]  I completely disagree with it, it's immoral
[1:50:16.020 --> 1:50:18.020]  But if you want to go steal from someone
[1:50:18.020 --> 1:50:20.020]  And you don't want the risk of a physical confrontation
[1:50:20.020 --> 1:50:21.020]  You don't want to be a mugger
[1:50:21.020 --> 1:50:23.020]  Because a mugger might have someone fight back
[1:50:23.020 --> 1:50:24.020]  Pretty strenuously
[1:50:24.020 --> 1:50:25.020]  Well, then you go to the states
[1:50:25.020 --> 1:50:27.020]  And you whisper that all these people are out there
[1:50:27.020 --> 1:50:29.020]  Who've become rich because they've stolen from the poor
[1:50:29.020 --> 1:50:30.020]  And they've stolen from you
[1:50:30.020 --> 1:50:32.020]  So now, please, Mr. Government, get all of the armaments
[1:50:32.020 --> 1:50:34.020]  But why would you pick?
[1:50:34.020 --> 1:50:36.020]  As the rich people in Canada
[1:50:36.020 --> 1:50:38.020]  As the target, the Blue Cat Cafe
[1:50:38.020 --> 1:50:39.020]  A cat sanctuary
[1:50:39.020 --> 1:50:41.020]  It's like they picked the most evil thing
[1:50:41.020 --> 1:50:43.020]  Just the most pathetic
[1:50:43.020 --> 1:50:45.020]  Why the hell would you do that?
[1:50:45.020 --> 1:50:47.020]  Because, again, they see women running
[1:50:47.020 --> 1:50:49.020]  A cat sanctuary as wimps
[1:50:49.020 --> 1:50:52.020]  And they're little pieces of crap
[1:50:53.020 --> 1:50:55.020]  Oh, my gosh, we'll be right back
[1:50:55.020 --> 1:50:57.020]  Stay with us, I mean, it's just unbelievable
[1:50:57.020 --> 1:51:04.020]  Hi there, Dick Holgeier here
[1:51:27.020 --> 1:51:31.020]  This is not that
[1:51:31.020 --> 1:51:35.020]  My experience with Synergy One has been great
[1:51:35.020 --> 1:51:36.020]  My mood is better
[1:51:36.020 --> 1:51:37.020]  My joints feel better
[1:51:37.020 --> 1:51:40.020]  I have more vigor, more stamina
[1:51:40.020 --> 1:51:42.020]  Way increased productivity
[1:51:42.020 --> 1:51:46.020]  My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more
[1:51:46.020 --> 1:51:48.020]  So I recommend Synergy One
[1:51:48.020 --> 1:51:49.020]  It's really good stuff
[1:51:49.020 --> 1:51:59.020]  I'm having great results with it
[1:52:19.020 --> 1:52:21.020]  With a trusted Big Berkey water filter
[1:52:21.020 --> 1:52:24.020]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show
[1:52:24.020 --> 1:52:26.020]  Big Berkey water filters remove chloramines
[1:52:26.020 --> 1:52:27.020]  Pharmaceuticals
[1:52:27.020 --> 1:52:28.020]  BPA
[1:52:28.020 --> 1:52:29.020]  Pesticides
[1:52:29.020 --> 1:52:30.020]  Bacteria and viruses
[1:52:30.020 --> 1:52:32.020]  All forms of fluoride and much more
[1:52:32.020 --> 1:52:34.020]  Big Berkey water filters are the original
[1:52:34.020 --> 1:52:36.020]  And most trusted on the market
[1:52:36.020 --> 1:52:38.020]  The gold standard in water purification
[1:52:38.020 --> 1:52:40.020]  And our filters last three years
[1:52:40.020 --> 1:52:42.020]  At less than two cents per gallon
[1:52:42.020 --> 1:52:44.020]  Big Berkey, the one powerful enough
[1:52:44.020 --> 1:52:45.020]  To purify stagnant pond water

[1:52:55.020 --> 1:52:56.020]  Big Berkey water filters
[1:52:56.020 --> 1:52:59.020]  For the love of clean water
[1:52:59.020 --> 1:53:00.020]  This is Dan Pilla
[1:53:00.020 --> 1:53:02.020]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[1:53:02.020 --> 1:53:04.020]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[1:53:04.020 --> 1:53:06.020]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years
[1:53:06.020 --> 1:53:09.020]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too
[1:53:09.020 --> 1:53:10.020]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement
[1:53:10.020 --> 1:53:11.020]  And I'm telling you
[1:53:11.020 --> 1:53:13.020]  There's no such thing as a hopeless case
[1:53:13.020 --> 1:53:15.020]  Call 800-34 no tax
[1:53:15.020 --> 1:53:17.020]  To finally get free of IRS debt
[1:53:17.020 --> 1:53:18.020]  With the IRS's new programs
[1:53:18.020 --> 1:53:21.020]  There's never been a better time to solve your problem
[1:53:21.020 --> 1:53:23.020]  Call 800-34 no tax
[1:53:23.020 --> 1:53:25.020]  That's 800-34 no tax
[1:53:25.020 --> 1:53:47.020]  Or my website, danpilla.com
[1:53:55.020 --> 1:54:00.020]  The Worldwide Leader in EMF Radiation Protection
[1:54:26.020 --> 1:54:32.020]  And we are back live here with Stefan Malin and my guest
[1:54:32.020 --> 1:54:34.020]  Look, again, I'll say this a thousand times
[1:54:34.020 --> 1:54:36.020]  I'm not up here claiming I'm perfect
[1:54:36.020 --> 1:54:38.020]  Well, I talk about things I should do myself
[1:54:38.020 --> 1:54:41.020]  But you look at the fact that people don't exercise
[1:54:41.020 --> 1:54:42.020]  They don't go outside
[1:54:42.020 --> 1:54:43.020]  Kids don't play outside anymore
[1:54:43.020 --> 1:54:48.020]  All you see is the glowing color of blue TVs at night
[1:54:48.020 --> 1:54:51.020]  There is a breakdown of society
[1:54:51.020 --> 1:54:53.020]  And then a lot of people don't feel fulfilled
[1:54:53.020 --> 1:54:55.020]  Because they didn't go through rites of passage
[1:54:55.020 --> 1:54:58.020]  They're not doing normal human biological activities
[1:54:58.020 --> 1:55:00.020]  And then you read the elite saying
[1:55:00.020 --> 1:55:03.020]  They've designed it all to hijack our modern society
[1:55:03.020 --> 1:55:05.020]  To be as destructive as possible
[1:55:05.020 --> 1:55:07.020]  And then, again, I use the Omega Man
[1:55:07.020 --> 1:55:10.020]  Or the Last Man on Earth analogy of
[1:55:10.020 --> 1:55:12.020]  There's the last guy who isn't a zombie
[1:55:12.020 --> 1:55:14.020]  But some of the zombies still have their intellects
[1:55:14.020 --> 1:55:15.020]  And he's like, listen, I have the cure
[1:55:15.020 --> 1:55:17.020]  It's my antibodies, my blood, you can be human again
[1:55:17.020 --> 1:55:19.020]  They go, dude, we don't want to be human again
[1:55:19.020 --> 1:55:20.020]  And they're killing
[1:55:20.020 --> 1:55:23.020]  Or, you know, a remake with Will Smith
[1:55:23.020 --> 1:55:24.020]  I am legend
[1:55:24.020 --> 1:55:28.020]  And I'm not on some high horse like I'm some great guy
[1:55:28.020 --> 1:55:30.020]  I see the statistics, I see the numbers
[1:55:30.020 --> 1:55:32.020]  I see how pissed they are
[1:55:32.020 --> 1:55:35.020]  I see how the left and the establishment right
[1:55:35.020 --> 1:55:38.020]  Have become just a disease of arrogance
[1:55:38.020 --> 1:55:40.020]  And you can see the arrogance they all have
[1:55:40.020 --> 1:55:42.020]  It's like it's their possession
[1:55:42.020 --> 1:55:44.020]  And then they want to dominate us
[1:55:44.020 --> 1:55:46.020]  With this twisted will
[1:55:46.020 --> 1:55:48.020]  And then they're totally incompetent
[1:55:48.020 --> 1:55:50.020]  And collapse every country they're in control of
[1:55:50.020 --> 1:55:52.020]  So, the big question is
[1:55:52.020 --> 1:55:54.020]  How far does this process go?
[1:55:54.020 --> 1:55:55.020]  And what happens?
[1:55:55.020 --> 1:55:56.020]  Because I asked it earlier and we didn't get to it
[1:55:56.020 --> 1:55:58.020]  Do they ever capitulate?
[1:55:58.020 --> 1:56:01.020]  And then what comes after that, Stefan Malinou?
[1:56:01.020 --> 1:56:04.020]  Well, I guess like dealing with any addicts
[1:56:04.020 --> 1:56:05.020]  There are some who will get better
[1:56:05.020 --> 1:56:06.020]  And some who won't
[1:56:06.020 --> 1:56:09.020]  And we reach with as much information
[1:56:09.020 --> 1:56:10.020]  Those who've been indoctrinated
[1:56:10.020 --> 1:56:12.020]  Like we were talking about communism and so on
[1:56:12.020 --> 1:56:14.020]  A third of millennials believe that
[1:56:14.020 --> 1:56:17.020]  President George W. Bush was responsible
[1:56:17.020 --> 1:56:20.020]  For more deaths than Soviet leader Joseph Stalin
[1:56:20.020 --> 1:56:22.020]  Who killed millions, you know
[1:56:22.020 --> 1:56:24.020]  Just in the forced famine
[1:56:24.020 --> 1:56:27.020]  In the collectivization of farms in Ukraine
[1:56:27.020 --> 1:56:29.020]  Between two and seven million people
[1:56:29.020 --> 1:56:31.020]  So, a lot of it is just
[1:56:31.020 --> 1:56:32.020]  You've been indoctrinated
[1:56:32.020 --> 1:56:33.020]  You don't know what the truth is
[1:56:33.020 --> 1:56:35.020]  You're in the matrix or the state tricks
[1:56:35.020 --> 1:56:37.020]  That's created by government miseducation
[1:56:37.020 --> 1:56:40.020]  So, some people when they get better information
[1:56:40.020 --> 1:56:41.020]  They're thirsty for it
[1:56:41.020 --> 1:56:43.020]  They red pill with enthusiasm
[1:56:43.020 --> 1:56:45.020]  They wake up, they pursue more knowledge
[1:56:45.020 --> 1:56:47.020]  Than other people recoil
[1:56:47.020 --> 1:56:49.020]  And try and avoid it, stick their heads in the sand
[1:56:49.020 --> 1:56:51.020]  But how can you know communism isn't a total nightmare
[1:56:51.020 --> 1:56:53.020]  It's always a horrible nightmare
[1:56:53.020 --> 1:56:56.020]  I mean, they're always saying Cuba's so good
[1:56:56.020 --> 1:56:57.020]  Venezuela's so good
[1:56:57.020 --> 1:56:58.020]  I'm like, what the hell are you talking about?
[1:56:58.020 --> 1:56:59.020]  Canadian healthcare is so good
[1:56:59.020 --> 1:57:00.020]  They're all coming down here
[1:57:00.020 --> 1:57:01.020]  Not that ours is that good
[1:57:01.020 --> 1:57:03.020]  I mean, it's just they're not informed
[1:57:03.020 --> 1:57:06.020]  They're little kids in arrested development
[1:57:06.020 --> 1:57:08.020]  And the whole system is about arresting that development
[1:57:08.020 --> 1:57:11.020]  So, how do we get them out of that?
[1:57:11.020 --> 1:57:12.020]  I think, you know, I hate to say
[1:57:12.020 --> 1:57:13.020]  If I had some big plan
[1:57:13.020 --> 1:57:15.020]  Other than what I've been doing for the last 30 years
[1:57:15.020 --> 1:57:17.020]  I would be doing that big plan
[1:57:17.020 --> 1:57:19.020]  I mean, we have this incredible medium
[1:57:19.020 --> 1:57:20.020]  You and I have in this conversation
[1:57:20.020 --> 1:57:21.020]  Thousands of miles apart
[1:57:21.020 --> 1:57:23.020]  It's going to reach millions and millions of people
[1:57:23.020 --> 1:57:24.020]  They can share it
[1:57:24.020 --> 1:57:26.020]  You know, everybody has their part to play
[1:57:26.020 --> 1:57:28.020]  Listen, people may not have your energy
[1:57:28.020 --> 1:57:30.020]  Your charisma, your enthusiasm
[1:57:30.020 --> 1:57:33.020]  They may not have my particular abilities
[1:57:33.020 --> 1:57:34.020]  And education
[1:57:34.020 --> 1:57:35.020]  But everyone has a part to play
[1:57:35.020 --> 1:57:36.020]  Everything you share
[1:57:36.020 --> 1:57:38.020]  Every little shred of information that you bring up
[1:57:38.020 --> 1:57:39.020]  Every video you share
[1:57:39.020 --> 1:57:42.020]  Every tiny brave post you make on social media
[1:57:42.020 --> 1:57:44.020]  You don't know who that's going to wake up
[1:57:44.020 --> 1:57:45.020]  It could be somebody with infinity
[1:57:45.020 --> 1:57:47.020]  By the way, we're not being patronized
[1:57:47.020 --> 1:57:50.020]  The power literally lies with the people
[1:57:50.020 --> 1:57:52.020]  There are folks who are more articulate than us
[1:57:52.020 --> 1:57:53.020]  That you see to start their own shows
[1:57:53.020 --> 1:57:55.020]  And do it as a duty and not be scared
[1:57:55.020 --> 1:57:57.020]  You should be scared of not doing it
[1:57:57.020 --> 1:57:58.020]  By the way, what do you think of Dumb Chomsky
[1:57:58.020 --> 1:58:00.020]  Saying he thinks Trump will stage a false flag
[1:58:00.020 --> 1:58:01.020]  To bring in Muslims?
[1:58:01.020 --> 1:58:04.020]  Isn't bringing in radical Muslims by the millions?
[1:58:04.020 --> 1:58:05.020]  Isn't that the false flag?
[1:58:05.020 --> 1:58:07.020]  Because they're going to blow stuff up
[1:58:07.020 --> 1:58:10.020]  Then you take our rights when they attack
[1:58:10.020 --> 1:58:12.020]  Well, I think everyone knows
[1:58:12.020 --> 1:58:13.020]  That there are going to be more attacks
[1:58:13.020 --> 1:58:15.020]  I mean, don't you every morning
[1:58:15.020 --> 1:58:16.020]  Just sort of look there and say
[1:58:16.020 --> 1:58:18.020]  Woohoo, no attacks today, yay
[1:58:18.020 --> 1:58:19.020]  That's a good day
[1:58:19.020 --> 1:58:21.020]  And so everyone knows there's going to be more attacks
[1:58:21.020 --> 1:58:22.020]  And there's going to be an escalation
[1:58:22.020 --> 1:58:25.020]  And in particular, if Marine LePan gets in
[1:58:25.020 --> 1:58:27.020]  And begins to start to unravel
[1:58:27.020 --> 1:58:29.020]  Some of the accommodations that have been made
[1:58:29.020 --> 1:58:30.020]  To the immigrant population
[1:58:30.020 --> 1:58:31.020]  Particularly the third world
[1:58:31.020 --> 1:58:32.020]  Let's talk about that
[1:58:32.020 --> 1:58:33.020]  Because we're already being held hostage
[1:58:33.020 --> 1:58:35.020]  Your gun says, do what I say
[1:58:35.020 --> 1:58:36.020]  Or I'll burn up Europe
[1:58:36.020 --> 1:58:37.020]  We got to call the bluff
[1:58:37.020 --> 1:58:39.020]  I mean, you know, you can't pay the pirate
[1:58:39.020 --> 1:58:40.020]  Over and over again
[1:58:40.020 --> 1:58:41.020]  Well, Steph, I'm all in it
[1:58:41.020 --> 1:58:43.020]  We'll talk about paying the pirate
[1:58:43.020 --> 1:58:44.020]  Doesn't work, doesn't turn out well
[1:58:44.020 --> 1:59:13.020]  We'll be back, stay with us
[1:59:14.020 --> 1:59:15.020]  So you can keep food from spoiling
[1:59:15.020 --> 1:59:18.020]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars
[1:59:18.020 --> 1:59:19.020]  Trucks, buses, 18-wheelers
[1:59:19.020 --> 1:59:21.020]  Heavy equipment, even airplanes
[1:59:21.020 --> 1:59:23.020]  The system provides an endless supply
[1:59:23.020 --> 1:59:24.020]  Of off-the-grid electricity
[1:59:24.020 --> 1:59:26.020]  Allowing you to create your own private power grid
[1:59:26.020 --> 1:59:28.020]  Literally anywhere in the world
[1:59:28.020 --> 1:59:30.020]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations
[1:59:30.020 --> 1:59:32.020]  Any time you need to get off the grid
[1:59:32.020 --> 1:59:33.020]  For a while
[1:59:33.020 --> 1:59:35.020]  Go to privatepowergrid.com

[1:59:49.020 --> 2:00:12.020]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show
[2:00:12.020 --> 2:00:19.020]  From the Infowars.com News Center
[2:00:19.020 --> 2:00:21.020]  Deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas
[2:00:21.020 --> 2:00:22.020]  Broadcasting worldwide
[2:00:22.020 --> 2:00:25.020]  You're listening to the voice of human resistance
[2:00:25.020 --> 2:00:30.020]  Against the Technotronic Technocracy Cancouver
[2:00:30.020 --> 2:00:33.020]  You're listening to Alex Jones
[2:00:33.020 --> 2:00:34.020]  Steph, I'm all new
[2:00:34.020 --> 2:00:35.020]  FreedomDomainRadio.com
[2:00:35.020 --> 2:00:36.020]  It's our guest for the five minutes
[2:00:36.020 --> 2:00:37.020]  And I'm gonna open the phones up
[2:00:37.020 --> 2:00:38.020]  Cover a bunch of news
[2:00:38.020 --> 2:00:39.020]  Get to a bunch of clips
[2:00:39.020 --> 2:00:42.020]  I haven't hit yet
[2:00:42.020 --> 2:00:44.020]  The reason I get so serious about this is
[2:00:44.020 --> 2:00:45.020]  I know history
[2:00:45.020 --> 2:00:47.020]  It's from all different sides
[2:00:47.020 --> 2:00:49.020]  It's incontrovertible what we're facing
[2:00:49.020 --> 2:00:51.020]  The globalists are a group of capitalists
[2:00:51.020 --> 2:00:53.020]  That have decided to create a monopoly
[2:00:53.020 --> 2:00:56.020]  And then use socialism and communism to control us
[2:00:56.020 --> 2:00:58.020]  They write white papers admitting it
[2:00:58.020 --> 2:00:59.020]  By the thousands
[2:00:59.020 --> 2:01:01.020]  I mentioned tragedy and hope several times today
[2:01:01.020 --> 2:01:04.020]  That's a 1,100 page book
[2:01:04.020 --> 2:01:05.020]  This is in our opinion
[2:01:05.020 --> 2:01:08.020]  It's not my opinion that they were spying on Trump
[2:01:08.020 --> 2:01:09.020]  They admitted they were
[2:01:09.020 --> 2:01:10.020]  It's not my opinion
[2:01:10.020 --> 2:01:12.020]  Obamacare was written by insurance companies
[2:01:12.020 --> 2:01:14.020]  To screw you over and raise prices
[2:01:14.020 --> 2:01:16.020]  And you not have an open market
[2:01:16.020 --> 2:01:19.020]  And so we just kind of hit that point where
[2:01:19.020 --> 2:01:21.020]  You have a lot of losers that imagine
[2:01:21.020 --> 2:01:22.020]  They're part of the power structure
[2:01:22.020 --> 2:01:24.020]  And that goes for Republican blue bloods
[2:01:24.020 --> 2:01:25.020]  And others as well
[2:01:25.020 --> 2:01:27.020]  I'm with the establishment
[2:01:27.020 --> 2:01:28.020]  I'm compromising
[2:01:28.020 --> 2:01:30.020]  You can't compromise with cancer
[2:01:30.020 --> 2:01:32.020]  Stefan, other points, my friend
[2:01:32.020 --> 2:01:34.020]  Well, I think it's important to remember
[2:01:34.020 --> 2:01:36.020]  When you're looking at the American political landscape
[2:01:36.020 --> 2:01:39.020]  Not just the western political landscape as a whole
[2:01:39.020 --> 2:01:41.020]  Is that the leftists have lost the war of ideas
[2:01:41.020 --> 2:01:43.020]  You could argue they lost the war of ideas
[2:01:43.020 --> 2:01:46.020]  Almost a century ago when Ludwig von Mises
[2:01:46.020 --> 2:01:48.020]  Published his great works against socialism
[2:01:48.020 --> 2:01:50.020]  And collectivism and central planning and so on
[2:01:50.020 --> 2:01:52.020]  The leftists lost the war of ideas
[2:01:52.020 --> 2:01:54.020]  And this is why they're turning to censorship
[2:01:54.020 --> 2:01:57.020]  This is why they're turning to outright vote buying
[2:01:57.020 --> 2:01:59.020]  In general just by offering more and more
[2:01:59.020 --> 2:02:01.020]  Government programs to more and more people
[2:02:01.020 --> 2:02:03.020]  And it's hard to understand things like Obamacare
[2:02:03.020 --> 2:02:06.020]  I mean, the leftists wanted single-payer healthcare for decades
[2:02:06.020 --> 2:02:07.020]  But why did they want it?
[2:02:07.020 --> 2:02:08.020]  They can't stop like Linus Weiler
[2:02:08.020 --> 2:02:09.020]  It doesn't matter who kills them
[2:02:09.020 --> 2:02:11.020]  They want it now because
[2:02:11.020 --> 2:02:13.020]  They want more and more third world migrants
[2:02:13.020 --> 2:02:16.020]  To come to the west because those third world migrants
[2:02:16.020 --> 2:02:17.020]  Come from collectivist cultures
[2:02:17.020 --> 2:02:19.020]  Come from tribal cultures and vote for big government
[2:02:19.020 --> 2:02:22.020]  80%, 85%, 90% in some regions
[2:02:22.020 --> 2:02:24.020]  And among some demographics
[2:02:24.020 --> 2:02:25.020]  They regularly vote for the left
[2:02:25.020 --> 2:02:27.020]  So why did you need Obamacare?
[2:02:27.020 --> 2:02:29.020]  Because it was really, really tough for immigrants
[2:02:29.020 --> 2:02:31.020]  To get the healthcare that they wanted
[2:02:31.020 --> 2:02:32.020]  So they had to pass that
[2:02:32.020 --> 2:02:34.020]  Because they care about people's healthcare
[2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:36.020]  If they did, there wouldn't be so many kids
[2:02:36.020 --> 2:02:37.020]  Being drugged in schools
[2:02:37.020 --> 2:02:39.020]  They'd shut that down right away in my opinion
[2:02:39.020 --> 2:02:41.020]  But what they want to do is they're constantly
[2:02:41.020 --> 2:02:44.020]  Trying to get people in, bribe money, print money
[2:02:44.020 --> 2:02:46.020]  Who are going to vote for the left?
[2:02:46.020 --> 2:02:48.020]  Why? Because they have no arguments whatsoever
[2:02:48.020 --> 2:02:51.020]  Their arguments have been defied by history, by logic
[2:02:51.020 --> 2:02:53.020]  By economics, by the mounting pile of bodies
[2:02:53.020 --> 2:02:55.020]  Of socialism around the world
[2:02:55.020 --> 2:02:56.020]  That's being added to now
[2:02:56.020 --> 2:02:57.020]  People hunting for rats and pigeons
[2:02:57.020 --> 2:02:59.020]  In the sewers of Venezuela
[2:02:59.020 --> 2:03:01.020]  So they've lost the argument for ideas
[2:03:01.020 --> 2:03:02.020]  How it has all become manipulation
[2:03:02.020 --> 2:03:03.020]  It has become ballot stuffing
[2:03:03.020 --> 2:03:05.020]  It has become illegal immigration
[2:03:05.020 --> 2:03:07.020]  And it has become massive vote
[2:03:07.020 --> 2:03:09.020]  Buying in the form of government programs
[2:03:09.020 --> 2:03:11.020]  Sell the world out to be in charge for another week
[2:03:11.020 --> 2:03:12.020]  Even though it all collapses
[2:03:12.020 --> 2:03:14.020]  And the elites are running off to like
[2:03:14.020 --> 2:03:17.020]  The Pacific everywhere, Tasmania, Kauai, you name it
[2:03:17.020 --> 2:03:19.020]  Admitting they think it's all going to collapse
[2:03:19.020 --> 2:03:20.020]  Wow
[2:03:20.020 --> 2:03:21.020]  Well, it is
[2:03:21.020 --> 2:03:23.020]  And all you have to do is ask yourself
[2:03:23.020 --> 2:03:26.020]  If illegal immigrants voted for Republicans
[2:03:26.020 --> 2:03:28.020]  Would the Democrats be so keen on having them in?
[2:03:28.020 --> 2:03:30.020]  And everybody knows deep down what the answer is
[2:03:30.020 --> 2:03:32.020]  They're being used as human pawns
[2:03:32.020 --> 2:03:34.020]  They're not being used as individuals
[2:03:34.020 --> 2:03:36.020]  They're not being appreciated as individuals
[2:03:36.020 --> 2:03:38.020]  They're being used as objects
[2:03:38.020 --> 2:03:40.020]  For the addict to get his power lust
[2:03:40.020 --> 2:03:42.020]  The one drug that drives them mad
[2:03:42.020 --> 2:03:43.020]  And might bring us all down
[2:03:43.020 --> 2:03:45.020]  If we don't fight their addiction
[2:03:45.020 --> 2:03:46.020]  Power, power, power
[2:03:46.020 --> 2:03:48.020]  The greatest drug, the greatest ring
[2:03:48.020 --> 2:03:50.020]  I think we know in which lava pit
[2:03:50.020 --> 2:03:52.020]  Metaphorically they need to end up
[2:03:52.020 --> 2:03:54.020]  To me, the greatest power is the thrill
[2:03:54.020 --> 2:03:56.020]  Of seeing success of everybody
[2:03:56.020 --> 2:03:59.020]  And competition and the huge college
[2:03:59.020 --> 2:04:01.020]  Of open ideas and to see your children
[2:04:01.020 --> 2:04:03.020]  With other children living into the future
[2:04:03.020 --> 2:04:05.020]  And the dreams of humanity
[2:04:05.020 --> 2:04:07.020]  And having individualism and just
[2:04:07.020 --> 2:04:09.020]  All the incredible choices it gives us
[2:04:09.020 --> 2:04:11.020]  It's so sexy compared to
[2:04:11.020 --> 2:04:14.020]  Daughtering, Pelosi and Kim Jong-un
[2:04:14.020 --> 2:04:17.020]  Every state run thing always has
[2:04:17.020 --> 2:04:19.020]  Like this pathetic creature at the head of it
[2:04:19.020 --> 2:04:22.020]  Like Hitler was a pathetic little rat creature
[2:04:22.020 --> 2:04:25.020]  It's like what the hell is this?
[2:04:25.020 --> 2:04:28.020]  It is the greatest glory in humanity
[2:04:28.020 --> 2:04:29.020]  Which is a choice of ideas
[2:04:29.020 --> 2:04:31.020]  You know when I grew up in England Alex
[2:04:31.020 --> 2:04:32.020]  We had three channels
[2:04:32.020 --> 2:04:34.020]  Two of them I think were owned by the government
[2:04:34.020 --> 2:04:36.020]  And the corporation which
[2:04:36.020 --> 2:04:37.020]  You were forced to pay for
[2:04:37.020 --> 2:04:38.020]  Jimmy Saville
[2:04:38.020 --> 2:04:40.020]  So I grew up with two channels
[2:04:40.020 --> 2:04:41.020]  Now you flip on your computer
[2:04:41.020 --> 2:04:42.020]  You have an infinite choice
[2:04:42.020 --> 2:04:45.020]  I love the competition, I love the openness
[2:04:45.020 --> 2:04:47.020]  There's no shortage of audience for the truth
[2:04:47.020 --> 2:04:49.020]  I think we just keep speaking the truth
[2:04:49.020 --> 2:04:50.020]  Keep passionately bringing
[2:04:50.020 --> 2:04:51.020]  And there's nothing they can do
[2:04:51.020 --> 2:04:52.020]  To their mind
[2:04:52.020 --> 2:04:53.020]  They're just going to shut you and I down
[2:04:53.020 --> 2:04:54.020]  Ten morals sprout up
[2:04:54.020 --> 2:04:56.020]  Because people now have the taste
[2:04:56.020 --> 2:04:58.020]  For a larger palette, Steph, I'm all new, amazing
[2:04:58.020 --> 2:04:59.020]  Thank you
[2:04:59.020 --> 2:05:00.020]  Thank you
[2:05:00.020 --> 2:05:02.020]  While some liberal cities are fighting
[2:05:02.020 --> 2:05:05.020]  For the rights of law-breaking non-citizen migrants
[2:05:05.020 --> 2:05:08.020]  Others are cutting funds to schools that are too white
[2:05:08.020 --> 2:05:10.020]  Walter Reed Middle School in North Hollywood
[2:05:10.020 --> 2:05:12.020]  Is having funds cut because their school's
[2:05:12.020 --> 2:05:14.020]  Student body is too white
[2:05:14.020 --> 2:05:17.020]  And this has led to layoffs and increased class sizes
[2:05:17.020 --> 2:05:19.020]  Think schools have issues?
[2:05:19.020 --> 2:05:21.020]  Leave it to Democrats to make it worse
[2:05:21.020 --> 2:05:23.020]  Think about this if the tables return
[2:05:23.020 --> 2:05:25.020]  If Republicans were moving funds from schools
[2:05:25.020 --> 2:05:27.020]  Because they were too black to schools
[2:05:27.020 --> 2:05:29.020]  That had a more diverse student body
[2:05:29.020 --> 2:05:30.020]  There would be outrage
[2:05:30.020 --> 2:05:31.020]  And rightfully so
[2:05:31.020 --> 2:05:33.020]  But this is what Democrats are doing
[2:05:33.020 --> 2:05:35.020]  While shaming anyone who makes decisions
[2:05:35.020 --> 2:05:37.020]  Or judgments based on someone's identity
[2:05:37.020 --> 2:05:40.020]  The Democrats make policy based on identity
[2:05:40.020 --> 2:05:43.020]  While shaming people who make policy based on identity
[2:05:43.020 --> 2:05:45.020]  What do you expect in California?
[2:05:45.020 --> 2:05:48.020]  Where they continue to elect people like Nancy Pelosi
[2:05:48.020 --> 2:05:49.020]  And Maxine Waters
[2:05:49.020 --> 2:05:51.020]  To mentally ill politicians
[2:05:51.020 --> 2:05:54.020]  That appear to have no clue what's even going on
[2:05:54.020 --> 2:05:57.020]  Let's stop electing morons
[2:05:57.020 --> 2:05:58.020]  For Infowars.com
[2:05:58.020 --> 2:06:27.020]  This is Owen Troyer
[2:06:28.020 --> 2:06:30.020]  This is a very interesting story
[2:06:30.020 --> 2:06:32.020]  It's really interesting to see
[2:06:32.020 --> 2:06:34.020]  That we're not going to be able to
[2:06:34.020 --> 2:06:35.020]  Make it as much as we can
[2:06:35.020 --> 2:06:36.020]  To recapture that
[2:06:36.020 --> 2:06:38.020]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal
[2:06:38.020 --> 2:06:39.020]  You used the meat for sustenance
[2:06:39.020 --> 2:06:40.020]  The fat for cooking
[2:06:40.020 --> 2:06:43.020]  But you used the bones for strength
[2:06:43.020 --> 2:06:45.020]  From the outside structure full of minerals
[2:06:45.020 --> 2:06:46.020]  And key cofactors
[2:06:46.020 --> 2:06:48.020]  To the marrow that produces the blood for the body
[2:06:48.020 --> 2:06:51.020]  This is the engine of the life essence
[2:06:51.020 --> 2:06:53.020]  I'm a long way from the caveman
[2:06:53.020 --> 2:06:54.020]  My ancestors were
[2:06:54.020 --> 2:06:56.020]  But I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[2:06:56.020 --> 2:06:58.020]  The ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[2:06:58.020 --> 2:07:27.020]  For Infowars.com
[2:07:29.020 --> 2:07:31.020]  And you're looking for a convenient easy way
[2:07:31.020 --> 2:07:33.020]  To incorporate nutritional raw materials
[2:07:33.020 --> 2:07:35.020]  Into your day to day lives
[2:07:35.020 --> 2:07:38.020]  To guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients
[2:07:38.020 --> 2:07:40.020]  The 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats
[2:07:40.020 --> 2:07:42.020]  And amino acids it needs to do its healing work
[2:07:42.020 --> 2:07:46.020]  You need to check out Infowars.com
[2:07:46.020 --> 2:07:48.020]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition
[2:07:48.020 --> 2:07:50.020]  Head over to Infowars.com
[2:07:50.020 --> 2:07:52.020]  Your body will be very grateful
[2:07:52.020 --> 2:07:55.020]  On the web at Infowars.com
[2:07:55.020 --> 2:07:58.020]  That's Infowars.com
[2:08:26.020 --> 2:08:30.020]  And I gotta hand it to the pedophile network
[2:08:30.020 --> 2:08:33.020]  To pretty much run the planet
[2:08:33.020 --> 2:08:38.020]  You got a lot of nerve
[2:08:38.020 --> 2:08:42.020]  But the people are about to strike back politically
[2:08:42.020 --> 2:08:44.020]  But they had this Washington Post writer
[2:08:44.020 --> 2:08:46.020]  And it's been syndicated across the country
[2:08:46.020 --> 2:08:48.020]  I'm told it was like the paper this morning
[2:08:48.020 --> 2:08:50.020]  Some family read it
[2:08:50.020 --> 2:08:52.020]  Salt Lake City Tribune, Washington Post
[2:08:52.020 --> 2:08:55.020]  You name it, Margaret Sullivan
[2:08:55.020 --> 2:08:58.020]  Alex Jones, sorry excuse for an apology
[2:08:58.020 --> 2:09:01.020]  You know, I'm gonna show you Margaret Sullivan
[2:09:01.020 --> 2:09:03.020]  Some of the folks we're talking about
[2:09:03.020 --> 2:09:06.020]  Like Jerry Epstein and the criminal investigations
[2:09:06.020 --> 2:09:08.020]  Anthony Wiener and then we're gonna show you
[2:09:08.020 --> 2:09:10.020]  Some of the big pedophile arrests going around the country
[2:09:10.020 --> 2:09:12.020]  And kids getting found with little cages
[2:09:12.020 --> 2:09:14.020]  And then you point your finger at me
[2:09:14.020 --> 2:09:16.020]  When I say we've covered a lot of news reports
[2:09:16.020 --> 2:09:19.020]  And there have been false reports out there
[2:09:19.020 --> 2:09:21.020]  That we've mentioned concerning a pizza place
[2:09:21.020 --> 2:09:23.020]  And then you act like we're fake news
[2:09:23.020 --> 2:09:26.020]  Like you, because of that you sit there on your high horse
[2:09:26.020 --> 2:09:28.020]  Shaking your finger at me
[2:09:28.020 --> 2:09:30.020]  I took the high road on something
[2:09:30.020 --> 2:09:32.020]  Because I have integrity
[2:09:32.020 --> 2:09:34.020]  And because when I cover things
[2:09:34.020 --> 2:09:36.020]  It needs to be documented
[2:09:36.020 --> 2:09:39.020]  We're swimming in an ocean of crimes against children
[2:09:39.020 --> 2:09:41.020]  And networks covering it up
[2:09:41.020 --> 2:09:43.020]  To such a massive level
[2:09:43.020 --> 2:09:47.020]  That for probably 10 years I've been in retreat from it
[2:09:47.020 --> 2:09:49.020]  And I had an epiphany this weekend
[2:09:49.020 --> 2:09:51.020]  About the bottom of the hour
[2:09:53.020 --> 2:09:56.020]  I ended up hiring Paul Watson
[2:09:56.020 --> 2:09:58.020]  Because he created a giant online database
[2:09:58.020 --> 2:10:00.020]  It was posting up to 10 articles a day
[2:10:00.020 --> 2:10:02.020]  Of mainstream news in England
[2:10:02.020 --> 2:10:04.020]  But they were catching giant pedophile rings everywhere
[2:10:04.020 --> 2:10:08.020]  Satanism, murder of children, you name it
[2:10:08.020 --> 2:10:10.020]  And I was covering it
[2:10:10.020 --> 2:10:13.020]  I started having Paul write for Info Wars
[2:10:13.020 --> 2:10:19.020]  16 years ago
[2:10:19.020 --> 2:10:22.020]  And I've never seen Paul so pissed yesterday
[2:10:22.020 --> 2:10:24.020]  As he was in the fourth hour when he brought all this up
[2:10:24.020 --> 2:10:26.020]  And what they're saying about all this
[2:10:26.020 --> 2:10:28.020]  Because clearly what this has become is
[2:10:28.020 --> 2:10:31.020]  MSM has come out with all these articles saying
[2:10:31.020 --> 2:10:33.020]  Alex Jones admits he's a liar
[2:10:33.020 --> 2:10:34.020]  There's no pedophilia in the elite
[2:10:34.020 --> 2:10:36.020]  There's no corruption, nothing's happening
[2:10:36.020 --> 2:10:38.020]  It's not what I said
[2:10:38.020 --> 2:10:40.020]  I said, yeah, there were articles out there
[2:10:40.020 --> 2:10:42.020]  About a basement in the place
[2:10:42.020 --> 2:10:44.020]  That weren't real in some cases
[2:10:44.020 --> 2:10:46.020]  And we didn't create those
[2:10:46.020 --> 2:10:48.020]  We didn't report on them for weeks
[2:10:48.020 --> 2:10:50.020]  Our listeners got mad and said, look at this
[2:10:50.020 --> 2:10:52.020]  And we're like, God, that looks pretty crazy
[2:10:52.020 --> 2:10:54.020]  Plus they had some rock bands there
[2:10:54.020 --> 2:10:56.020]  Saying things I'm not going to repeat
[2:10:56.020 --> 2:10:58.020]  And then the media turned it into this whole hysteria
[2:10:58.020 --> 2:11:00.020]  And said it was my, my, my, my story
[2:11:00.020 --> 2:11:02.020]  And I said, no, it's not
[2:11:02.020 --> 2:11:04.020]  And stopped attaching me to whatever new stuff
[2:11:04.020 --> 2:11:06.020]  MSM basically makes up
[2:11:06.020 --> 2:11:07.020]  Because I figured it out
[2:11:07.020 --> 2:11:10.020]  MSM was finding the most obscure rumors online
[2:11:10.020 --> 2:11:12.020]  Probably posting, media's been caught doing this before
[2:11:12.020 --> 2:11:14.020]  False flagging, and then saying I said it
[2:11:14.020 --> 2:11:17.020]  I didn't say Hillary was in the bottom of this pizza place
[2:11:17.020 --> 2:11:19.020]  Killing people to damn lie
[2:11:19.020 --> 2:11:21.020]  They edited tapes of me
[2:11:21.020 --> 2:11:24.020]  On NPR, on CNN, on Fox, everywhere
[2:11:24.020 --> 2:11:26.020]  My lawyers say I have a case, by the way
[2:11:26.020 --> 2:11:29.020]  But I don't have the time to mess with it
[2:11:29.020 --> 2:11:32.020]  Well, I said she's a mass murderer for Syrian Libyan
[2:11:32.020 --> 2:11:34.020]  Killed all these kids, she's responsible
[2:11:34.020 --> 2:11:36.020]  They edited that to it
[2:11:36.020 --> 2:11:41.020]  But it was in a pizza place
[2:11:41.020 --> 2:11:46.020]  And then I come out and I clarify
[2:11:46.020 --> 2:11:48.020]  Because people are innocent until proven guilty
[2:11:48.020 --> 2:11:52.020]  And I don't, I think most stuff said about that place is wrong
[2:11:52.020 --> 2:11:56.020]  That's the very definition of coming out and being honest
[2:11:56.020 --> 2:11:59.020]  And they use that to lie all over the news about
[2:11:59.020 --> 2:12:01.020]  Jones now says his outrageous theory
[2:12:01.020 --> 2:12:04.020]  That Hillary's connected to pedophilia was all a lie
[2:12:04.020 --> 2:12:05.020]  Didn't say that
[2:12:05.020 --> 2:12:08.020]  Hillary Clinton is up to her eyeballs with pedophiles
[2:12:08.020 --> 2:12:10.020]  And pedophilia and representing pedophiles
[2:12:10.020 --> 2:12:12.020]  And Jerry Epstein and Wiener
[2:12:12.020 --> 2:12:15.020]  And we told you first that the child porn investigation
[2:12:15.020 --> 2:12:18.020]  Before it was in the news, we have real law enforcement sources
[2:12:18.020 --> 2:12:23.020]  Just like we do on Hillary falling down
[2:12:23.020 --> 2:12:28.020]  I mean, you see the guess we have on
[2:12:28.020 --> 2:12:34.020]  Former top CIA contractors
[2:12:34.020 --> 2:12:37.020]  Like Mr. Peranto and countless others
[2:12:37.020 --> 2:12:40.020]  I mean, you think, I mean, obviously the president calls me
[2:12:40.020 --> 2:12:41.020]  I talked to the president
[2:12:41.020 --> 2:12:44.020]  Yes, I got big sources
[2:12:44.020 --> 2:12:47.020]  And I told you the president's going to start going after all this
[2:12:47.020 --> 2:12:50.020]  But I read people like Margaret Sullivan weighing in
[2:12:50.020 --> 2:12:52.020]  With her holy other now crap
[2:12:52.020 --> 2:12:55.020]  Hey Margaret, where's your article about Madeline Albright
[2:12:55.020 --> 2:12:57.020]  Admitted a half million Iraqi kids died
[2:12:57.020 --> 2:12:59.020]  Under Madeline Albright's sanctions with Bill Clinton
[2:12:59.020 --> 2:13:00.020]  And they were a good price to pay
[2:13:00.020 --> 2:13:03.020]  And she gets off on talking about dead kids
[2:13:03.020 --> 2:13:05.020]  Hey lady, forget pedophilia
[2:13:05.020 --> 2:13:07.020]  What about that lady?
[2:13:07.020 --> 2:13:09.020]  You don't have Jack Squat to say
[2:13:09.020 --> 2:13:11.020]  Just like you don't about Hillary, I came, I saw he died
[2:13:11.020 --> 2:13:14.020]  Putting the jihadis in over 15 countries
[2:13:14.020 --> 2:13:16.020]  Murdering hundreds of thousands of Syria alone
[2:13:16.020 --> 2:13:18.020]  Blowing up hundreds of churches
[2:13:18.020 --> 2:13:19.020]  Prowing gay people off buildings
[2:13:19.020 --> 2:13:23.020]  And I'm upset and you call me an Islamophobe
[2:13:23.020 --> 2:13:27.020]  Because I don't like wholesale from Cairo, Egypt
[2:13:27.020 --> 2:13:30.020]  To Aleppo, Syria
[2:13:30.020 --> 2:13:34.020]  Hundreds of thousands of gays being murdered
[2:13:34.020 --> 2:13:36.020]  Those are just people to me
[2:13:36.020 --> 2:13:38.020]  I don't care what their sexual preference is
[2:13:38.020 --> 2:13:41.020]  I'm pissed off
[2:13:44.020 --> 2:13:46.020]  But you just sit there and you dehumanize me
[2:13:46.020 --> 2:13:49.020]  And you take my heartfelt correction
[2:13:49.020 --> 2:13:52.020]  And the media twists the living hell out of it
[2:13:52.020 --> 2:13:55.020]  To then say, Jones admits he made it all up
[2:13:55.020 --> 2:13:58.020]  The Clintons aren't connected to pedophilia
[2:13:58.020 --> 2:14:00.020]  You're right, they're not connected
[2:14:00.020 --> 2:14:03.020]  They are pedophilia
[2:14:03.020 --> 2:14:06.020]  Hillary Clinton is a murderer of children
[2:14:06.020 --> 2:14:09.020]  Hillary Clinton is a degenerate witch
[2:14:09.020 --> 2:14:10.020]  Then they have the 60 minutes pieces
[2:14:10.020 --> 2:14:11.020]  Oh, Hillary's not even sick
[2:14:11.020 --> 2:14:12.020]  Look, they murdered her up
[2:14:12.020 --> 2:14:13.020]  She never even fell down
[2:14:13.020 --> 2:14:16.020]  They show you edited video that doesn't show her falling down
[2:14:16.020 --> 2:14:18.020]  When a few seconds later she does
[2:14:18.020 --> 2:14:20.020]  My God, how discredited is the 60 minutes
[2:14:20.020 --> 2:14:22.020]  If I had somebody on the street this morning
[2:14:22.020 --> 2:14:25.020]  I was in a bank
[2:14:25.020 --> 2:14:28.020]  Walk up to me when I was closing an account
[2:14:31.020 --> 2:14:33.020]  There was a liberal area of Austin
[2:14:33.020 --> 2:14:34.020]  And the tellers could hardly even talk
[2:14:34.020 --> 2:14:35.020]  They were so freaked out
[2:14:35.020 --> 2:14:36.020]  I was just staring and shaking their heads
[2:14:36.020 --> 2:14:38.020]  Like the devil had come in
[2:14:38.020 --> 2:14:42.020]  And this guy goes, oh, I saw your buddy Cernovich
[2:14:42.020 --> 2:14:45.020]  On 60 Minutes, boy, he got destroyed
[2:14:45.020 --> 2:14:46.020]  Oh, yeah
[2:14:46.020 --> 2:14:47.020]  And I was like, what?
[2:14:47.020 --> 2:14:49.020]  Cause some arrogant, swole-up host
[2:14:49.020 --> 2:14:51.020]  We even know the name of
[2:14:51.020 --> 2:14:52.020]  Sat there and made jokes
[2:14:52.020 --> 2:14:55.020]  That he said Hillary fell down
[2:14:55.020 --> 2:14:58.020]  And the guy was trying to make me feel small
[2:14:58.020 --> 2:15:01.020]  Like, oh, yeah, surprise, you weren't on there
[2:15:01.020 --> 2:15:03.020]  And I said, do you even know the name of that host on there?
[2:15:03.020 --> 2:15:05.020]  And he goes, no, I don't
[2:15:05.020 --> 2:15:07.020]  I go, notice that
[2:15:07.020 --> 2:15:10.020]  We should know Mike Wallace and Stahl
[2:15:10.020 --> 2:15:11.020]  And all their names, didn't we?
[2:15:11.020 --> 2:15:13.020]  You don't know their name now
[2:15:13.020 --> 2:15:15.020]  What does that mean?
[2:15:15.020 --> 2:15:16.020]  The guy's like, what does it mean?
[2:15:16.020 --> 2:15:18.020]  I went, it means you weren't conscious
[2:15:18.020 --> 2:15:19.020]  While you're watching it
[2:15:19.020 --> 2:15:22.020]  And they're not stars anymore
[2:15:22.020 --> 2:15:24.020]  Nobody knows their name
[2:15:24.020 --> 2:15:25.020]  You know my name
[2:15:25.020 --> 2:15:28.020]  And you know my guest name, Mike Cernovich
[2:15:28.020 --> 2:15:31.020]  You don't know the host name in his big suit
[2:15:31.020 --> 2:15:33.020]  Laughing at Cernovich
[2:15:33.020 --> 2:15:37.020]  And Cernovich laughs back
[2:15:37.020 --> 2:15:40.020]  I mean, I sat there and had
[2:15:40.020 --> 2:15:42.020]  Senior Secret Service tell me
[2:15:42.020 --> 2:15:44.020]  She's having convulsions every 30 minutes
[2:15:44.020 --> 2:15:46.020]  To every 45 minutes
[2:15:46.020 --> 2:15:48.020]  Follow her, there's a black ambulance
[2:15:48.020 --> 2:15:50.020]  Waiting for us
[2:15:50.020 --> 2:15:53.020]  You'll catch it
[2:15:53.020 --> 2:15:54.020]  And then it happened
[2:15:54.020 --> 2:15:55.020]  I said it on air
[2:15:55.020 --> 2:15:56.020]  She's falling down
[2:15:56.020 --> 2:15:57.020]  She's in a black ambulance
[2:15:57.020 --> 2:15:59.020]  You see it happen three weeks later
[2:15:59.020 --> 2:16:01.020]  And their answer is
[2:16:01.020 --> 2:16:05.020]  The Clinton campaign said she's in great health
[2:16:05.020 --> 2:16:07.020]  Well, the Clinton campaign may say
[2:16:07.020 --> 2:16:09.020]  That baboons don't have purple butts
[2:16:09.020 --> 2:16:16.020]  But they do, bro
[2:16:16.020 --> 2:16:20.020]  Scott Pele, I guess this is his name
[2:16:20.020 --> 2:16:23.020]  You talk about a fake arrogant
[2:16:23.020 --> 2:16:26.020]  A feet stuff shirt
[2:16:26.020 --> 2:16:28.020]  Guy that takes himself seriously
[2:16:28.020 --> 2:16:30.020]  Let me act like Scott Pele
[2:16:30.020 --> 2:16:32.020]  Well, you do know
[2:16:32.020 --> 2:16:35.020]  All you want to say that
[2:16:35.020 --> 2:16:38.020]  The campaign says Hillary
[2:16:38.020 --> 2:16:41.020]  Is totally well
[2:16:41.020 --> 2:16:45.020]  I mean, it's like a cartoon character
[2:16:45.020 --> 2:16:49.020]  You're like, hey, this guy's blue
[2:16:49.020 --> 2:16:52.020]  Scott Pele
[2:16:52.020 --> 2:16:54.020]  She was saying to us
[2:16:54.020 --> 2:16:59.020]  Really?
[2:16:59.020 --> 2:17:02.020]  I mean, who comes up with this
[2:17:02.020 --> 2:17:04.020]  But see, for an unconscious person
[2:17:04.020 --> 2:17:07.020]  That looks like credibility
[2:17:07.020 --> 2:17:10.020]  To the type of folks that watch 16 minutes
[2:17:10.020 --> 2:17:11.020]  And you know, back in the day
[2:17:11.020 --> 2:17:13.020]  16 minutes would report on low level corruption
[2:17:13.020 --> 2:17:14.020]  They wouldn't do high level
[2:17:14.020 --> 2:17:16.020]  But they'd show hospitals taking your organs
[2:17:16.020 --> 2:17:17.020]  And killing you
[2:17:17.020 --> 2:17:18.020]  I mean, it was really going on
[2:17:18.020 --> 2:17:20.020]  And they'd show, you know, that Chevrolet
[2:17:20.020 --> 2:17:22.020]  Covered up exploding gas tanks
[2:17:22.020 --> 2:17:28.020]  Now, they're just water bearers
[2:17:28.020 --> 2:17:30.020]  Water carriers
[2:17:30.020 --> 2:17:33.020]  And that's why 60 Minutes has called me
[2:17:33.020 --> 2:17:35.020]  You know what our email says back to them
[2:17:35.020 --> 2:17:41.020]  Makeup, whatever you want
[2:17:41.020 --> 2:17:43.020]  Most people will be scrabbling
[2:17:43.020 --> 2:17:45.020]  Alex, you're turning down
[2:17:45.020 --> 2:17:47.020]  Nightline and Discovery Channel
[2:17:47.020 --> 2:17:48.020]  And History Channel
[2:17:48.020 --> 2:17:50.020]  And CNN and MSNBC
[2:17:50.020 --> 2:17:52.020]  But it's always taped
[2:17:52.020 --> 2:17:54.020]  So they can go
[2:17:54.020 --> 2:17:56.020]  Why do you love Hitler, Alex?
[2:17:56.020 --> 2:17:58.020]  I actually have this happen at one interview
[2:17:58.020 --> 2:17:59.020]  And then they cut to me
[2:17:59.020 --> 2:18:00.020]  From a separate part of the interview
[2:18:00.020 --> 2:18:01.020]  While they're overchanging tapes
[2:18:01.020 --> 2:18:02.020]  Just sit there for a minute
[2:18:02.020 --> 2:18:04.020]  You can see they're not changing tapes
[2:18:04.020 --> 2:18:05.020]  They're looking at each other
[2:18:05.020 --> 2:18:07.020]  They're waiting until you
[2:18:07.020 --> 2:18:11.020]  Make a funny face or something
[2:18:11.020 --> 2:18:13.020]  Why do you love Hitler?
[2:18:13.020 --> 2:18:14.020]  Five minutes before you're like waiting
[2:18:14.020 --> 2:18:17.020]  You're like
[2:18:17.020 --> 2:18:18.020]  Jones couldn't respond
[2:18:18.020 --> 2:18:21.020]  To why he didn't love Hitler
[2:18:21.020 --> 2:18:23.020]  That's what Katie Couric
[2:18:23.020 --> 2:18:24.020]  Got caught in the gun thing doing
[2:18:24.020 --> 2:18:26.020]  Show me one example
[2:18:26.020 --> 2:18:27.020]  Where a gun stopped current
[2:18:27.020 --> 2:18:30.020]  They all had a huge documented evidence
[2:18:30.020 --> 2:18:36.020]  It just cut to all five on the panel going
[2:18:36.020 --> 2:18:37.020]  Because they had him sit there
[2:18:37.020 --> 2:18:38.020]  For 30 minutes saying
[2:18:38.020 --> 2:18:39.020]  Oh, we're just waiting
[2:18:39.020 --> 2:18:40.020]  With cameras on them
[2:18:40.020 --> 2:18:41.020]  But folks were smart
[2:18:41.020 --> 2:18:43.020]  They were there recording the whole thing
[2:18:43.020 --> 2:18:49.020]  Good try, scumbag
[2:18:53.020 --> 2:18:57.020]  Alright, let me be a good boy
[2:18:57.020 --> 2:18:58.020]  And play some clubs
[2:18:58.020 --> 2:18:59.020]  Let me be a good boy
[2:18:59.020 --> 2:19:00.020]  And play some clubs
[2:19:00.020 --> 2:19:02.020]  And then open the phones up
[2:19:02.020 --> 2:19:03.020]  I had a Roger Stone
[2:19:03.020 --> 2:19:04.020]  I was in the fourth hour
[2:19:04.020 --> 2:19:06.020]  Listen, here's the deal
[2:19:06.020 --> 2:19:08.020]  If I told you we were under attack
[2:19:08.020 --> 2:19:09.020]  It'd be a lie
[2:19:09.020 --> 2:19:15.340]  a lie. We're under super savage foaming at the mouth pack of piranhas on PCP
[2:19:18.460 --> 2:19:25.500]  with rabies. A part of the Newark Times article saying that piranhas can't get rabies. I know
[2:19:25.500 --> 2:19:33.260]  it's a figure of speech, but it's a great honor. I love it actually. Then I just don't want to lose
[2:19:33.980 --> 2:19:38.700]  and if they can shut us down, which they're trying to do, you know, some of the years I don't make
[2:19:38.700 --> 2:19:42.460]  a lot of these, hey, they're coming after us things. I mean, they're really coming after us. You can
[2:19:42.460 --> 2:19:47.500]  see it everywhere and they're openly trying to lobby to shut everything we do down. The answer is
[2:19:47.500 --> 2:19:53.820]  pray for us first. Spread the links and know through human intelligence, human action, the
[2:19:53.820 --> 2:19:57.660]  articles, the videos to your friends, your family, your neighbors, call and talk radio,
[2:19:57.660 --> 2:20:03.580]  infowars.com, it's censored. This could backfire. It is backfiring. Infowars to get more traffic than
[2:20:03.580 --> 2:20:07.340]  ever. Prison planning more traffic than ever. If you spread the word now more than ever,
[2:20:07.340 --> 2:20:10.300]  you have great folks like Drudge Report who's linked to us today on the Michael Moore thing,
[2:20:10.300 --> 2:20:12.300]  keep linking to us. But if you keep promoting Drudge as well,
[2:20:13.660 --> 2:20:16.700]  there's not many stalwart groups out there resisting this. If you sign up for our free
[2:20:16.700 --> 2:20:20.860]  newsletters, we can send you stuff via the underground, infowars.com, or slash newsletter.
[2:20:22.780 --> 2:20:29.420]  We can break the back of this globalist operation, but we've got amazing nutraceuticals
[2:20:29.420 --> 2:20:33.740]  and supplements like the bone broth and tumor and more caveman formula that's so amazing.

[2:20:40.700 --> 2:20:45.340]  together. We've got so many other things going in infowars.com. It's so important to make that
[2:20:45.340 --> 2:20:52.620]  physical contribution. Where you physically get something of yourself, you help us, it's symbiotic.

[2:21:01.100 --> 2:21:06.300]  There's hundreds of reviews for caveman, 4.7 star reviews on power reviews,
[2:21:06.300 --> 2:21:10.780]  third party sites unheard of. I really should just read some reviews
[2:21:11.980 --> 2:21:17.180]  for the products. Here's one, Super Combo, Survival Syllidex2, Nacinide, and 30% off,
[2:21:17.180 --> 2:21:20.940]  get individually or together. Let me give you some of these. This is from Monica,
[2:21:20.940 --> 2:21:25.900]  they're known to disclose a place 5.0. This is the best iodine supplement I've ever used.
[2:21:25.900 --> 2:21:29.340]  I've been taking a natural thyroid supplement for a couple of years and notice it wasn't really
[2:21:29.340 --> 2:21:33.420]  working for me. It's usually bound, you can't absorb it, for me as well as it had at first.
[2:21:33.420 --> 2:21:37.820]  I heard about this iodine at taking different supplements, kelp, etc. I started to give it a
[2:21:37.820 --> 2:21:42.780]  try. I noticed a difference immediately. It's from Deep Earth Crystals. It's like alien blood,
[2:21:42.780 --> 2:21:47.420]  it'll eat through concrete before we put it in the gas form. Gotta have DEA licenses to have it.
[2:21:47.420 --> 2:21:52.060]  I mean, we got the real stuff, folks. Oh, you can make anything with iodine. It has been a year
[2:21:52.060 --> 2:21:57.580]  since I first purchased this product and I've been taking it religiously every day. I'll longer
[2:21:57.580 --> 2:22:01.580]  take the other thyroid supplements. Thanks to this amazing product. If you're not taking iodine,
[2:22:01.580 --> 2:22:07.420]  you're missing out. I love them for worse products. Here's another one. This is from
[2:22:07.420 --> 2:22:13.340]  Sierra, another undisclosed location, 5.0. Extra energy and brain boost. Biotrysillinium
[2:22:13.340 --> 2:22:18.620]  is awesome. I take it with nasin iodine and I feel like I have extra energy and a brain boost.
[2:22:18.620 --> 2:22:22.860]  I'll be able to accomplish the day. Let's do this list with ease. I love this product. Thank you.
[2:22:22.860 --> 2:22:28.620]  We recommend it to others. By the way, somebody took my biotrysillinium out of here.
[2:22:30.460 --> 2:22:34.060]  Somebody get me a bottle, please. I don't mean to take that. Thank you.
[2:22:35.980 --> 2:22:41.020]  Oh, actually, I found it falling down the floor. I got it. Well, I forget to take it. I have less
[2:22:41.020 --> 2:22:46.780]  energy. Now, I'll be honest. Whatever it does in the body, it maximizes the hormones and stuff
[2:22:46.780 --> 2:22:49.580]  you've already got. That's what they said in literature. When I take it every day, I have
[2:22:49.580 --> 2:22:55.740]  more energy. I lose weight. I feel great. The hair falls out, which I don't really mind,
[2:22:55.740 --> 2:22:59.900]  but that's a well-known thing with selenium. If it's biotrue, if it's real selenium from
[2:22:59.900 --> 2:23:06.700]  mustard seed, it'll, it'll, you know, I mean, being a man's got side effects. Who needs hair?
[2:23:06.700 --> 2:23:10.380]  I mean, quite frankly, I just don't like being the in-between point, you know? I mean,
[2:23:12.060 --> 2:23:15.260]  women love it when you, you know, if you're manly, you got your head shaved. I mean, it's all just
[2:23:15.260 --> 2:23:20.300]  more Madison Avenue Hollywood crap that women don't like. If you don't have a bunch of hair on your
[2:23:20.300 --> 2:23:28.140]  head, it's a load of BS, ladies and gentlemen. There you go. I just took my selenium and dribbled
[2:23:28.140 --> 2:23:35.740]  stuff down my shirt. Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com. And to say you're funding the tip of the spear is
[2:23:36.460 --> 2:23:43.260]  a cliche, but we're it folks. I just absolutely honored to be here with you and I love you all
[2:23:43.260 --> 2:23:52.460]  and I appreciate you. And let's go ahead and shift into what I mentioned earlier. Here we go.
[2:23:57.820 --> 2:24:03.980]  During the last break, I was back there in the coffee room in the break room and they had
[2:24:03.980 --> 2:24:13.020]  CNN on. And they were like, the Russian narrative understanding the scandal that could bring down
[2:24:13.020 --> 2:24:17.740]  Trump, is he a Russian agent? So now it's not just that his people are Russian agents for daring to
[2:24:17.740 --> 2:24:21.900]  talk to the Russians like you're supposed to do. Now he's a Russian agent and Nunes is a Russian
[2:24:21.900 --> 2:24:27.500]  agent and Rand Paul's a Russian agent. They've said it and I'm a Russian agent. Never been to
[2:24:27.500 --> 2:24:32.300]  Russia, no Russian blood, nothing. We have one great Russian American Marmy veteran here,
[2:24:32.300 --> 2:24:39.340]  is a great lady. I'll hire more Russians who are like her. But we're to the point, I gotta say,
[2:24:39.340 --> 2:24:45.500]  yeah, 70 people, we got a Russian here. Because I'm under criminal investigation to see if I'm
[2:24:45.500 --> 2:24:49.500]  getting directives from the Russians. Does that mean Obama's FBI stay behind groups,
[2:24:49.500 --> 2:24:55.180]  got on our servers and planted something? Hello comrades, what do I do? I promote borders and
[2:24:55.180 --> 2:24:59.820]  sovereignty and the family and Christianity and defeating radical Islam and bringing our jobs
[2:24:59.820 --> 2:25:04.140]  back and making America totally dominant. Thank you for wanting us to be dominant, Putin. Thank you,
[2:25:04.140 --> 2:25:11.260]  Putin. But remember, it was in the New York Times everywhere that they saved intelligence,
[2:25:11.260 --> 2:25:16.060]  they had it. They were giving leaks to the media showing Trump was under Russian control,
[2:25:16.060 --> 2:25:19.500]  but then there was nothing really there. So they had to back off and said Trump wasn't saying it.
[2:25:19.500 --> 2:25:26.780]  I know you know this, but I'm watching this in unmasking names and all of it. They did it.
[2:25:26.780 --> 2:25:30.860]  They admitted they wiretipped, they admitted they did it. So Obama administration rushed to preserve
[2:25:30.860 --> 2:25:35.260]  intelligence of Russian election hacking and shared it with the media, Matthew Rosenberg,
[2:25:35.260 --> 2:25:37.420]  who goes on TV and says, I've been staying and made all this up.
[2:25:41.740 --> 2:25:47.900]  But then meanwhile, it's up on infowars.com, Obama Defense Deputy admitted spying on Trump.
[2:25:49.180 --> 2:25:53.420]  Paul says, did they? I mean, she did. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense,
[2:25:53.420 --> 2:25:58.620]  Evelyn Farkas, has caused controversy after she appeared to admit during an appearance on MSNBC.
[2:25:58.620 --> 2:26:02.460]  So that's the old propaganda. Say you have the evidence you spied. They're like, wait,
[2:26:02.460 --> 2:26:05.740]  you're not supposed to say that. We were, they have no memories. We're telling them that never
[2:26:05.740 --> 2:26:12.540]  happened. Farkas explained to Mika Brzezinski, who literally her father has sworn to destroy Russia.
[2:26:12.540 --> 2:26:20.220]  He just hates Russia. Most polls don't hate Russia. He does. He's completely insane. The
[2:26:20.220 --> 2:26:24.860]  Obama administration scrambled to gather information about the Trump team's alleged ties to Russia.
[2:26:26.940 --> 2:26:30.860]  And it goes on. She was the former head for the Pentagon and the State Department. She was
[2:26:30.860 --> 2:26:36.860]  advisor there of the entire U.S. Russian anti-Russian operation. Just look at this whack job.
[2:26:36.860 --> 2:26:40.060]  But she goes on and tells the truth. Then they flip out.
[2:26:42.220 --> 2:26:45.420]  She was the woman deploying the 5 billion against Ukraine to overthrow their government,
[2:26:45.420 --> 2:26:49.260]  all of it. And they're like, hey, lady, you're not supposed to admit it. She's like,
[2:26:49.260 --> 2:26:54.380]  but it was in the newspaper. I ran the operation. Just no, you didn't. Okay, now Trump's a liar.
[2:26:54.380 --> 2:26:59.180]  It's totally insane that he ever was spied on. You understand? She's like, no, he was. He's a
[2:26:59.180 --> 2:27:03.980]  Russian. We have the evidence. When he was in the transition, he talked to him. That's what
[2:27:03.980 --> 2:27:08.540]  you're supposed to do. He talked to Nunez. Did you hear? He talked to the head of the House
[2:27:08.540 --> 2:27:14.780]  Intelligence Committee. And Trey Gowdy goes, who are you supposed to talk to? I mean, soon Trump
[2:27:14.780 --> 2:27:20.540]  can't talk to his own family. Trump was seen today talking to someone. He's an agent. The
[2:27:20.540 --> 2:27:24.780]  globalists are the ones destroying our country, not the Russians. We have common ground with Russia
[2:27:24.780 --> 2:27:29.100]  and everybody else that wants out from under this. Japan wants to make a deal with Trump to
[2:27:29.100 --> 2:27:34.380]  be actually free. Now from under there, they've never been free. They were organized as an
[2:27:34.380 --> 2:27:38.300]  engine of deindustrialization for the elites to siphon off the money the Japanese made into
[2:27:38.300 --> 2:27:43.420]  China and the sellout of America and Japan. Japan gets it. They're ready to get in bed with us
[2:27:43.420 --> 2:27:49.820]  all the way. So South Korea. Trump knows what's going on, folks. That's why these people that
[2:27:49.820 --> 2:27:55.100]  want to play God over us are crapping their polka-dotted drawers. So let's go to this former
[2:27:55.100 --> 2:28:00.300]  Obama head of Russia operations for the Pentagon, admitting they were spying on Trump. Here it is.
[2:28:01.020 --> 2:28:05.020]  Well, I was, I was urging my former colleagues and, and frankly,
[2:28:05.020 --> 2:28:11.100]  speaking to people on the Hill, Obama officials raised to preserve Russian trail.
[2:28:11.100 --> 2:28:16.620]  That was the version of print that they then had online. But let's start over. Here it is.
[2:28:17.420 --> 2:28:22.620]  Well, I was, I was urging my former colleagues and, and frankly speaking, the people on the Hill,
[2:28:23.340 --> 2:28:27.980]  it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can,
[2:28:27.980 --> 2:28:32.140]  get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration,
[2:28:32.140 --> 2:28:37.660]  because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people who left.
[2:28:37.660 --> 2:28:44.060]  So it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy that the Trump folks, if they found out how
[2:28:44.700 --> 2:28:50.380]  we knew what we knew about their, the staff, the Trump staffs dealing with Russians,
[2:28:50.380 --> 2:28:54.780]  that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have
[2:28:54.780 --> 2:28:59.820]  access to that intelligence. So I became very worried because not enough was coming out into
[2:28:59.820 --> 2:29:05.580]  the open and I knew that there was more. We have very good intelligence on Russia. So then I had
[2:29:05.580 --> 2:29:10.060]  talked to some of my former colleagues and I knew that they were trying to also help get information
[2:29:10.060 --> 2:29:16.380]  to the Hill. A lot going on today. Yeah. Mark, that's why you have the leaking. The circle is now
[2:29:16.380 --> 2:29:20.700]  complete. We're spying on him. We have all the proof, but there's not proof plus the leak's
[2:29:20.700 --> 2:29:30.460]  illegal. So we were never spying. He's insane. Now back to we were spying. We have all the evidence.
[2:29:32.220 --> 2:29:35.580]  Something tells me this lady ain't going to make America great again. Then when our tax is cut
[2:29:35.580 --> 2:29:40.700]  and then want to secure our borders, you know, get with the Russian program making us great again.
[2:29:41.740 --> 2:29:45.180]  Just like Trump did by turning the cold back on that devastated the Russian
[2:29:45.180 --> 2:29:49.820]  gas exports. But that's what Russia would want, right? Devastate their gas exports.
[2:29:51.100 --> 2:29:55.660]  They'll be back. Stay with us. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.380 --> 2:30:06.540]  Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Evelyn Farkas has caused controversy after
[2:30:06.540 --> 2:30:13.020]  she appeared on MSNBC and said the Obama administration spied on Donald Trump in order
[2:30:13.020 --> 2:30:18.700]  to gather intelligence for political purposes. Get as much intelligence as you can before
[2:30:18.700 --> 2:30:24.860]  President Obama leaves the administration. Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew
[2:30:24.860 --> 2:30:30.620]  about their the staff, the Trump staffs dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise
[2:30:30.620 --> 2:30:34.860]  those sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence. Then
[2:30:34.860 --> 2:30:39.180]  I had talked to some of my former colleagues and I knew that they were trying to also help get
[2:30:39.180 --> 2:30:44.380]  information to the Hill. Well, it appears Ms. Farkas was so caught up in the discussion that
[2:30:44.380 --> 2:30:51.100]  she didn't even realize the significant admissions she was making about Obama spying on Trump's team
[2:30:51.100 --> 2:30:55.980]  and releasing classified intelligence to the public. That's why you have a leaking.

[2:31:57.420 --> 2:32:05.340]  Today, we call it bone broth and for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[2:32:05.340 --> 2:32:10.300]  before it became a loss to our modern diets, a processed junk. We are now introducing caveman
[2:32:10.300 --> 2:32:15.980]  by InfowarsLife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root,
[2:32:15.980 --> 2:32:22.380]  shaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula. Caveman,
[2:32:22.380 --> 2:32:26.940]  it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior
[2:32:26.940 --> 2:32:32.060]  ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that. Everyone knew that you used all
[2:32:32.060 --> 2:32:36.140]  the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used
[2:32:36.140 --> 2:32:42.140]  the bones for strength, for the outside structure full of minerals and kiko factors, to the marrow
[2:32:42.140 --> 2:32:47.340]  that produces the blood for the body. This is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from
[2:32:47.340 --> 2:32:52.220]  the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made
[2:32:52.220 --> 2:32:55.980]  us what we were and this is a big part of it. I know you're going to want to check out Caveman,

[2:33:29.980 --> 2:33:35.740]  All right we've covered a plethora of news today to say the least. I'd like to open the phones up
[2:33:35.740 --> 2:33:40.140]  until Roger Stone joins us to cover whatever issue you want to hit on. The toll-free number to join
[2:33:40.140 --> 2:33:49.660]  us is 800-25-99-231-800-25-99-231. Not first-time callers, anybody wants to call, agree, disagree,
[2:33:49.660 --> 2:33:52.620]  whatever the case is. I said probably sometime this week open the phones up for
[2:33:52.620 --> 2:33:59.420]  Democrats because I know you're listening. I mean to really tell me how Trump's bad and hasn't gotten
[2:33:59.420 --> 2:34:05.100]  the best small business number since 1984 and the best consumer confidence index in 16 years and
[2:34:06.540 --> 2:34:11.180]  the media celebrating his defeat. He didn't get Obamacare repealed the first try. Oh my god
[2:34:11.180 --> 2:34:13.980]  it's incredible. Obama took three years to pass it.
[2:34:13.980 --> 2:34:24.140]  And like in the same programs on CNN he's crazy no one's spied on him but we spied on him and
[2:34:24.140 --> 2:34:35.180]  we have the evidence. And it's not lost on these audiences that in the same programs they'll
[2:34:35.180 --> 2:34:39.740]  contradict themselves, the same people. It's like they said we're at war against logic just
[2:34:39.740 --> 2:34:44.300]  be as illogical and lie as much as possible. In fact since the election they've gone from
[2:34:45.260 --> 2:34:49.740]  being horrible liars before the election to being unbelievable liars during it to now
[2:34:52.220 --> 2:34:57.660]  like a cult religiously committing to the most fantastical lies we're spying on Trump. We have
[2:34:57.660 --> 2:35:01.500]  all the evidence blah blah then of course there is no evidence we were never spying on him so of
[2:35:01.500 --> 2:35:09.980]  course we were spying on him. We never said we weren't spying. I know I'm obsessed on this it's
[2:35:09.980 --> 2:35:17.180]  just it's like everything they do it's it's just crazy. Trump's the biggest failure biggest failure
[2:35:17.180 --> 2:35:25.660]  in American history yeah yeah sure. Trump works for the elites I'm Nam Chomsky yeah sure. Meanwhile
[2:35:25.660 --> 2:35:32.380]  in the next sentence he says he's escaped going to the elites and the poor Muslims. Can I go to
[2:35:32.380 --> 2:35:35.980]  these Muslim countries and be a Christian? Can my daughters walk down the streets without hoods
[2:35:35.980 --> 2:35:44.620]  over their heads? The answer is hell no. So shut up stop trying to come where I'm open and I'm free
[2:35:44.620 --> 2:35:50.780]  and piss on me and tell me I'm bad I'm done I don't have any guilt it's over understand I'm pissed off.
[2:35:50.780 --> 2:35:57.660]  Stories on info wars.com we should show it we should tweet it out make a big deal out of it it's
[2:35:57.660 --> 2:36:04.300]  my analysis from yesterday and all the articles and documentation. Oh we mentioned this yesterday
[2:36:04.300 --> 2:36:08.940]  Facebook helps Pakistan identify thought criminals and have them arrested so they can be hung if
[2:36:08.940 --> 2:36:14.300]  they criticize Islam. I mean good god Facebook is just proving itself to China.
[2:36:15.660 --> 2:36:19.820]  I wanted to repost it did we ever repost it was a big thing at the start of the show I wanted to do
[2:36:19.820 --> 2:36:23.580]  I wanted to repost my whole analysis and then tweet it about

[2:36:32.860 --> 2:36:37.100]  they're playing to overthrow Trump using shadow government or you can say shadow government
[2:36:37.100 --> 2:36:41.420]  admits playing to overthrow Trump using violence that was my most important thing of the day
[2:36:41.420 --> 2:36:50.540]  that was all I wanted was that is that posted because I'll just where is it it needs to be

[2:38:30.300 --> 2:38:35.420]  just get that ready and we'll go to Roger later maybe but who knows hell you know who knows because
[2:38:35.420 --> 2:38:39.100]  it's not even a big deal no one even cares that they're openly saying they want to overthrow the
[2:38:39.100 --> 2:38:43.420]  president violently they're gearing up and then they're gonna have to spend congress for six months
[2:38:43.420 --> 2:38:48.300]  and do all this they're openly trying to organize it doesn't matter and I agree I don't care either
[2:38:48.300 --> 2:38:55.020]  totally normal here's John Bounds report Davos man is dead Builderburg man is dead
[2:38:55.020 --> 2:38:57.820]  the guy that found a billerberg literally died as you know a few days ago that rugabeller
[2:38:58.780 --> 2:39:06.060]  the united nations can and shouldn't play an essential role in helping the world find a
[2:39:06.060 --> 2:39:13.420]  satisfactory way of stabilizing world population we are severely lacking in teaching our youth
[2:39:13.420 --> 2:39:19.260]  about the constitution of the united states and about the government of the united states but there's
[2:39:19.260 --> 2:39:24.300]  plenty of money and there's plenty of help from the establishment to teach them about the united
[2:39:24.300 --> 2:39:29.580]  nations but in their own writings they're saying globalism is dead and they're not saying it to
[2:39:29.580 --> 2:39:35.420]  play possum their corrupt system is going to fall now they're just trying to steal as much
[2:39:35.420 --> 2:39:41.820]  money as they can and run to armored redoubts in the pacific ocean globalism is criminal it is
[2:39:41.820 --> 2:39:47.500]  anti-human it is a horrible ideology the worst the world's ever seen it comes out of the eugenics
[2:39:48.060 --> 2:39:55.020]  social Darwinism movement that spawned the fascist like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini
[2:39:55.020 --> 2:40:01.020]  it's bad and Hitler and Mussolini were unorganized morons compared to the globalist but they don't
[2:40:01.020 --> 2:40:05.340]  care if you're white or black they want to dump everybody down and play us off but they use race
[2:40:05.340 --> 2:40:11.980]  politics posing as the left that's the global plan three million north african muslims are waiting
[2:40:11.980 --> 2:40:19.100]  under the un migration slash borders board run by the founder of the ee u peter sutherland and
[2:40:19.100 --> 2:40:26.140]  they're ordering europe right now the ee u under un talk about dictatorship to let three million in
[2:40:26.140 --> 2:40:34.060]  in the next six months three million on top of the five million documented 80 percent of a military
[2:40:34.060 --> 2:40:41.260]  age men flooding in what is that plan migrants in general and in every country in europe make
[2:40:41.260 --> 2:40:48.700]  greater fiscal contributions than they take in benefits all right that's uh the globalist
[2:40:49.420 --> 2:40:53.420]  pushing the whole agenda popping in and we're gonna get your phone calls is roger stony's
[2:40:53.420 --> 2:40:59.580]  gonna be hosting the fourth hour today roger's so much going on i think the word of the hour is
[2:40:59.580 --> 2:41:03.980]  because their whole russia narrative is collapsed they're the ones illegally spying no proof of russia
[2:41:04.540 --> 2:41:09.820]  but expanding into that uh they're now trying to openly call for us to be shut down and censored
[2:41:09.820 --> 2:41:12.860]  that rock is publicly going to google asking that we be banned
[2:41:14.780 --> 2:41:21.180]  alex uh i think that's a very good summary uh coming up at uh three o'clock eastern uh is the
[2:41:21.180 --> 2:41:30.380]  podesta hour because now what we figured out is this entire russian trump collusion meme uh was
[2:41:30.380 --> 2:41:36.700]  invented by podesta himself uh and it's ingenious it distracts attention from the fact that he's
[2:41:36.700 --> 2:41:43.100]  seen his brother and bill and hillary clinton extracting millions and millions from the clique
[2:41:43.100 --> 2:41:51.580]  around uh and it sends the national media uh and all their fellow travelers within the media
[2:41:51.580 --> 2:41:57.980]  into a meeting of friends he's trying to find non-existent links between trump and russia
[2:41:58.860 --> 2:42:04.060]  so i think the american people need to be reminded of of the corruption of the clinton's
[2:42:04.060 --> 2:42:13.420]  and podesta in that part of the world this is his time in the barrel that i was referring to
[2:42:13.420 --> 2:42:19.660]  as you saw the president himself tweeted this several days ago so he gets it uh
[2:42:20.540 --> 2:42:29.340]  calv is a is a campaign of disinformation now as you point out with the russian claims collapsing
[2:42:29.340 --> 2:42:36.220]  and no evidence or proof that would ever hold up in a court of law it becomes clear
[2:42:36.220 --> 2:42:43.500]  that their plan uh to wiretap in essence to put the president uh or candidate for president
[2:42:44.140 --> 2:42:51.100]  under surveillance and then a president elect under surveillance was based on naked political
[2:42:51.660 --> 2:42:57.500]  motives rather than any legitimate concern about russian infiltration into our american
[2:42:57.500 --> 2:43:03.580]  political system this is why they have to go to google and facebook and pressure them
[2:43:04.460 --> 2:43:09.500]  to carry the real news because we are kicking the living we're kicking the living daylights
[2:43:09.500 --> 2:43:14.060]  out of them and i know our audience knows this is fake but they're the foot soldiers the true
[2:43:14.060 --> 2:43:18.860]  commandos the shock troops i know you know this folks we have to keep getting it out because
[2:43:19.740 --> 2:43:25.260]  they've now gone back as i just played 10 minutes ago to saying oh yes we have the secret
[2:43:25.260 --> 2:43:29.980]  intelligence that he's a russian agent so they've gone back full circle to three months ago
[2:43:29.980 --> 2:43:34.220]  as if we have no memory and i keep going back to this goldfish thing but gruber and others
[2:43:34.220 --> 2:43:40.940]  admit it they're betting everything on the public not having memories roger stone yeah it's
[2:43:40.940 --> 2:43:45.580]  absolutely right they continue to have nothing they keep changing their story the new york times
[2:43:45.580 --> 2:43:51.340]  wrote on january 20th that they had emails records of financial transactions and then on the 30th
[2:43:51.340 --> 2:43:57.020]  they added to that telephone intercept transcripts proving collusion between trump associates
[2:43:57.980 --> 2:44:02.300]  and the russians where are they well they had the former head of the pentagon's russia program
[2:44:03.660 --> 2:44:10.060]  assistant secretary of defense evelin farkas saying everything was spied on again but then
[2:44:10.060 --> 2:44:15.660]  there's nothing there now they say nuna is talking to trump is a russian plot now the house intelligence
[2:44:15.660 --> 2:44:20.940]  committee head can't talk to trump these people are crazy now let's be clear about this uh
[2:44:20.940 --> 2:44:26.060]  chuck schumer and adam schiff are desperate because nunez is getting much too close to the truth
[2:44:26.700 --> 2:44:31.660]  nunez is a patriot uh he's not an attorney isn't it crazy though that this is just normal courage
[2:44:31.660 --> 2:44:38.460]  and telling the truth but in a congress full of cowards the guys a superstar well and and the
[2:44:38.460 --> 2:44:44.300]  attempts to discredit him the daily beast today i think the daily beast is actually dictated at
[2:44:44.300 --> 2:44:48.380]  the democratic national committee and they just take it down well they admit that that came out
[2:44:48.380 --> 2:44:56.300]  the wiki leaks i mean this is this is an absurdity nunez is a hero uh info war is listening just as
[2:44:56.300 --> 2:45:01.180]  i verge the followers of stone cold truth should contact his office and commend him for standing
[2:45:01.180 --> 2:45:06.700]  tall in the face of this liberal you know assault he has to talk let's get here he's on the right
[2:45:06.700 --> 2:45:12.700]  thing what do you make of the dnc firing every staffer they've got when trump fires 46 us attorneys
[2:45:12.700 --> 2:45:16.860]  it's the end of the world even though clinton fired 93 totally normal the democrats are firing
[2:45:16.860 --> 2:45:22.460]  all their people well at least they got fired unlike mark rich he took three in the back of the head
[2:45:24.700 --> 2:45:30.940]  uh pardon me uh what's his name uh uh mark the um the uh fellow who handed the documents over not
[2:45:30.940 --> 2:45:37.500]  mark rich but sats rich sats rich his family says it's foul play fired to being shot in the streets
[2:45:37.500 --> 2:45:45.260]  of dc uh and that the sats rich crime is as yet unassolved so everybody should email their friends
[2:45:45.260 --> 2:45:50.220]  their neighbors their co-workers tune in next hour to hear the proof which is we know but now
[2:45:50.220 --> 2:45:56.140]  it's all come out him his brother all of it literally on the russian payroll and we don't
[2:45:56.140 --> 2:45:59.500]  blame the russians that's what we do to them the point is they do that for their country we do it
[2:45:59.500 --> 2:46:05.340]  for ours trump has no connections to russians he's just approaching it as a business deal by
[2:46:05.340 --> 2:46:09.420]  business deal if it's better for america to have coal so what if it hurts russia i mean you know
[2:46:09.420 --> 2:46:13.500]  quite frankly a lot of what he's been doing is devastating russia and i'm sorry for them that's
[2:46:13.500 --> 2:46:18.300]  just the way it is uh but the claim that he's this russian agent that's the more and more getting
[2:46:18.300 --> 2:46:24.860]  put to bed the people should tune in to see all the proof of why podesta cooked this up just like
[2:46:24.860 --> 2:46:30.140]  he's under investigation the fbi weiner for child born we said that first in the news so they get
[2:46:30.140 --> 2:46:34.700]  the media to focus on a pizza place get us to cover it so they can divert off of what they're
[2:46:34.700 --> 2:46:40.060]  doing in new york city they're very very good at that aren't they now it's extraordinary look
[2:46:40.060 --> 2:46:47.340]  some of the incredible investigative work that's being done about um regarding a child sex trafficking
[2:46:47.340 --> 2:46:53.660]  out of hate being done by people who are allied with the top hillary operatives uh this has not
[2:46:53.660 --> 2:46:58.780]  yet i think had the full exploration it needs to have uh in the media but you imagine if we had a
[2:46:58.780 --> 2:47:05.180]  photo of hillary as long as there isn't as long as there is an info wars as long as as long as we
[2:47:05.180 --> 2:47:10.860]  have free access to the internet the truth will always come out well i'm excited uh you'll you'll

[2:49:40.060 --> 2:49:44.060]  if prop arrested five thousand chinese agents tomorrow and arrested the leadership of the
[2:49:44.060 --> 2:49:48.140]  democratic party that's been working with a cog to overthrow the president i would absolutely get
[2:49:48.140 --> 2:49:53.020]  behind it you're gonna get jury trials okay before you get your asses thrown in prison

[2:50:02.300 --> 2:50:07.260]  that's a lot of talk from a one-eyed fat man you're gonna find out in the end aren't you
[2:50:11.340 --> 2:50:15.500]  a little bit of poetry there you can pick it up let's skip this break so we have more time
[2:50:15.500 --> 2:50:20.140]  and just show someone at all this that's point blank let's go ahead and talk to shane in north
[2:50:20.140 --> 2:50:27.340]  carolina you're on the air go ahead concerning gnome chomsky um as a as an absolute gatekeeper
[2:50:27.900 --> 2:50:35.660]  he um he basically was a red flag for me uh several years ago um i was kind of a new to the
[2:50:35.660 --> 2:50:41.340]  nine eleven truth movement and uh came across the video where he was invited as some kind of keynote
[2:50:41.340 --> 2:50:45.980]  speaker and he was attacking me and others and nine eleven truth and saying it doesn't exist and he
[2:50:45.980 --> 2:50:51.740]  was saying it was just irrelevant and it doesn't really matter who did it and oh yeah i forgot it's
[2:50:51.740 --> 2:50:57.180]  irrelevant it doesn't matter who did nine eleven if it was a question about the soddies and 28 pages
[2:50:57.180 --> 2:51:01.420]  which again is just part of it brings it all down exactly now that's what i mean i'm so sick of fake
[2:51:01.420 --> 2:51:06.460]  intellectuals who just act like they've read the classics or act like they've read philosophy
[2:51:06.460 --> 2:51:13.020]  or act like they've read 500 books on world war two they're fakes the guy picks a few big words
[2:51:13.020 --> 2:51:18.860]  to wow a bunch of people that think he's their guru go ahead james corbett did a great piece
[2:51:18.860 --> 2:51:23.900]  uh dedicated to gnome chomsky a couple years back it was all about an hour long piece about
[2:51:23.900 --> 2:51:28.780]  different examples where he's a gatekeeper and richard gauge called him out as being a gatekeeper
[2:51:28.780 --> 2:51:33.260]  you know i think uh you know he doesn't want to implicate his buddies in the most sod for nine
[2:51:33.260 --> 2:51:37.900]  eleven you know or his elite buddies all across the board i mean he's obviously a gatekeeper
[2:51:39.100 --> 2:51:45.100]  i mean absolutely i don't want to just attack chomsky it's just some old guy with hair growing
[2:51:45.100 --> 2:51:49.580]  out the end of his nose with a bunch of weirdos like he's like yoda he sits on little stools and
[2:51:52.060 --> 2:51:58.060]  when he's funded by the power structure the power structure doesn't like trump because if he has his
[2:51:58.060 --> 2:52:03.500]  way their monopolies are over and we're all going to be fabulously rich they were willing to work
[2:52:04.140 --> 2:52:07.820]  look at how each generation gets more wealthy under globalism that's all going to end
[2:52:08.540 --> 2:52:13.260]  everybody comes to america because of the free market is it perfect hell no does america have
[2:52:13.260 --> 2:52:19.820]  problems you bet but she's the she's the sexiest lady there is god bless you i appreciate your
[2:52:19.820 --> 2:52:25.100]  call chain god i love this country see i used to grow up here in how great texas was how great
[2:52:25.100 --> 2:52:31.260]  america was my family i thought it was some type of pride just some type of arrogance i never liked
[2:52:31.260 --> 2:52:36.940]  arrogance i misunderstood it was more reverence because as bad as texas in america is god compared
[2:52:36.940 --> 2:52:42.300]  to the others it was totally different i'd hear this stuff growing up and i read history books and
[2:52:42.300 --> 2:52:48.540]  it was real like this ancestor did this and this ancestor did that and i actually looked it up and
[2:52:48.540 --> 2:52:52.620]  i was like true and i was like wow now i thought everybody must feel this way right they're like
[2:52:52.620 --> 2:52:59.340]  well everybody feels this way and that's what's so frustrating is that there's a whole birthright
[2:52:59.340 --> 2:53:07.260]  for everybody i don't care if you're black hispanic asian white if you're my neighbors i just want
[2:53:07.260 --> 2:53:12.140]  you to be into success and happy and cool and want to have a good time it's what you think it's
[2:53:12.140 --> 2:53:17.500]  what you do it's not what colors you are that's so obvious and so fundamental but you look at the
[2:53:17.500 --> 2:53:25.020]  left today what they push is the complete difference to that quite frankly bureau people that just look
[2:53:25.020 --> 2:53:37.500]  like you this little old you know let's see what they're doing is all forced and it's all just
[2:53:37.500 --> 2:53:42.460]  lowest common denominator a bunch of entitled scumbags trying to rule over by it's not going to go on
[2:53:42.460 --> 2:53:48.460]  forever all right who's up next here Sharon in Ohio Sharon you're on the air Sharon

[2:54:03.500 --> 2:54:08.860]  make sure all of our children are getting all their vaccinations and immunizations and all that
[2:54:08.860 --> 2:54:12.620]  that's been in the news we've covered it we should cover it more its intimidation tactics

[2:54:28.140 --> 2:54:32.860]  you know you would like a red sash and a white shirt with an iron cross and a black cloak at
[2:54:32.860 --> 2:54:37.820]  two a.m knocks on your door and he's got big mesmerizing eyes and black jet black hair comb back

[2:55:01.500 --> 2:55:06.780]  but i just received a letter saying they would be calling about this uh study they're doing
[2:55:06.780 --> 2:55:14.860]  i was apparently chosen by random uh computer and they typically are interested in the names of your
[2:55:14.860 --> 2:55:23.180]  children between the ages of 17 and 37 months or children between teenagers 13 to 17 years now
[2:55:23.180 --> 2:55:26.940]  the middle school i mean you know the elementary school students i guess they feel they've already
[2:55:26.940 --> 2:55:31.020]  got them well you know they're upset you know wasn't enough to maim my grandmother and admittedly
[2:55:31.020 --> 2:55:34.860]  no they gave a tour with the with the polio shot they want to make sure your kids are as brain
[2:55:34.860 --> 2:55:41.260]  damaged and or dead as possible but go ahead i've been a natural health consultant for 30 years sure
[2:55:41.260 --> 2:55:45.420]  you're being you're being targeted no one should talk to these people but but this is so so so so
[2:55:45.420 --> 2:55:51.260]  what's the main report well the main thing is is um i just feel like this is a big fishing
[2:55:51.260 --> 2:55:56.860]  expedition and i don't have any children school age i do have grandchildren and now they're bombing
[2:55:56.860 --> 2:56:02.060]  everybody with this then once they get you on the phone then they harass you then they try to like
[2:56:02.060 --> 2:56:06.620]  claim and to neglect and they try to send cps to your house don't answer the phone when the cdc
[2:56:06.620 --> 2:56:10.220]  calls they're there to give you diseases they're there to hurt you and your family that's their
[2:56:10.220 --> 2:56:16.860]  admitted goal wouldn't be ironic if what's going on with killery is uh you know due to a vaccination
[2:56:16.860 --> 2:56:20.460]  and the immunization of some kind she took you know that would well the elites admit they quote get
[2:56:20.460 --> 2:56:24.220]  the clean vaccines but those can still have adverse reactions by the way if you're a new
[2:56:24.220 --> 2:56:28.940]  listener you can google german elite take clean vaccine or british leader chinese elite take
[2:56:28.940 --> 2:56:32.860]  clean vaccine there's something to learn to immunity it has its own side effects but
[2:56:32.860 --> 2:56:37.660]  they're putting stuff in them folks it's declassified in hundreds of cases people need to know that
[2:56:38.460 --> 2:56:41.020]  they just think you're stupid and so they hope you don't look thank you Sharon
[2:56:42.540 --> 2:56:47.500]  i've got articles today about Gardasil killing more more young women or paralyzing them
[2:56:50.540 --> 2:56:55.100]  let's go ahead and talk to raven in north carolina then we'll go to steven jim raven you're on the
[2:56:55.100 --> 2:57:01.740]  here yeah hey i want to ask a question about senator john mccain and his uh little cabin
[2:57:01.740 --> 2:57:08.060]  boy they're lindsay cram but first i wanted to plug plug real quick a youtube video it's 22 seconds
[2:57:08.060 --> 2:57:16.380]  long uh people can just go to youtube and look up uh freudian slip massage agent and it's a fox news
[2:57:16.380 --> 2:57:22.460]  five uh interview of some small man security expert uh but apparently some people dug into his
[2:57:22.460 --> 2:57:30.620]  background so freudian slip massage agent yeah freudian slip all right but you know i've noticed
[2:57:30.620 --> 2:57:35.820]  that's the very beginning but the two main guys out there at the forefront of all this are
[2:57:35.820 --> 2:57:43.180]  senator john mccain and lindsay graham uh saying everybody's a russian agent um trying to uh derail
[2:57:43.180 --> 2:57:50.300]  the trump uh presidency and uh you know these guys these two guys uh i think an argument can
[2:57:50.300 --> 2:57:54.780]  certainly be made i've long believed that they work for the jewish mafia and you know they keep
[2:57:54.780 --> 2:58:01.180]  saying everybody that is pro trump pro america pro in the interest of the american people uh
[2:58:01.180 --> 2:58:06.140]  works for russia uh how come nobody ever points out that they're working for the jewish mafia
[2:58:07.340 --> 2:58:11.820]  well there is undoubtedly a jewish mafia and the adl will say you're any somatic
[2:58:11.820 --> 2:58:17.900]  no there's a italian mafia irish mafia jewish mafia jamaican mafia when there's mafias there's
[2:58:17.900 --> 2:58:24.860]  dixie mafia and absolutely the jewish mafia then if you criticize it then says you're any somatic
[2:58:24.860 --> 2:58:28.860]  but the jewish mafia is a very powerful mafia you know it's in the godfather movies that are based
[2:58:28.860 --> 2:58:33.180]  on true stories they just change the names absolutely uh and the jewish mafia mainly
[2:58:33.180 --> 2:58:39.100]  feeds on jews so like the wing ringworm so fartik jews they they were killed over a hundred thousand
[2:58:39.100 --> 2:58:44.300]  of them in radiation tests so you know one of the biggest enemies of jews is the jewish mafia
[2:58:44.300 --> 2:58:48.700]  they worked with hitler uh well i mean the main the head of the jewish mafia is george soros he's

[2:59:04.620 --> 2:59:09.820]  the secret to defender body armor is his proprietary process and technology that disperses more
[2:59:09.820 --> 2:59:14.220]  kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor using one of the strongest
[2:59:14.220 --> 2:59:19.980]  synthetic materials ever created called ultra high molecular weight ollie ethylene defender armor
[2:59:19.980 --> 2:59:25.020]  is also super compact and lightweight there's a reason the department of defense chose defender
[2:59:25.020 --> 2:59:30.220]  to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor it works defender body armor
[2:59:30.220 --> 2:59:34.780]  is made right here in america and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification

[3:00:11.260 --> 3:00:19.100]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[3:00:21.340 --> 3:00:25.180]  we've come so far to define the globalist and the fact that they're unelected and they have bad
[3:00:25.180 --> 3:00:34.700]  bad aims bad bad bad will towards us and from here on their defeat is certain the question is
[3:00:34.700 --> 3:00:40.860]  will they destroy the planet in the process well they'll destroy the planet if they win so god wants
[3:00:40.860 --> 3:00:49.580]  us to basically just charge into war politically informationally and never attack until they start
[3:00:49.580 --> 3:00:55.900]  the war and then everything is an attack isn't it and then we know that we're just going to be
[3:00:55.900 --> 3:01:01.900]  stomping on a bunch of scum but it's got to be done hope that's not the case they're the ones openly
[3:01:01.900 --> 3:01:07.820]  planning for war murder of trump you name it by the way we have nano tech body armor exclusively
[3:01:07.820 --> 3:01:13.100]  developed here in america manufactured america we also have defender body armor that is this plastic
[3:01:13.100 --> 3:01:15.740]  system that's been adopted by the defense department that's all i'm supposed to say
[3:01:15.740 --> 3:01:20.620]  say and both systems are different but they're both very very powerful regardless in a collapse

[3:02:14.460 --> 3:02:21.340]  horror writer kill john lennon as crazy as that sounds it's provable all right well listen i mean
[3:02:21.340 --> 3:02:25.500]  i've talked to the linen family and i didn't hear anything about steven king but definitely it was
[3:02:25.500 --> 3:02:33.100]  a setup and i can't tell y'all the stuff i was told but i'm just gonna leave it that but uh
[3:02:33.740 --> 3:02:37.180]  i mean truth stranger than fiction i use a lot of entertainment people for stuff but

[3:02:46.940 --> 3:02:54.140]  or whatever uh brandon in minnesota you're on the air worldwide hey alex i appreciate the
[3:02:54.140 --> 3:02:58.620]  opportunity here first time caller um you know more i've been thinking about the way uh the
[3:02:58.620 --> 3:03:03.740]  events have been uh coming down here i i think that uh really the elite realized that hillary
[3:03:03.740 --> 3:03:07.980]  hillary was all used up she was damaged goods basically threw her away and let tremp uh you
[3:03:07.980 --> 3:03:12.140]  know handed him the election whether he's going to win it or not and this is uh basically i'm
[3:03:12.140 --> 3:03:17.020]  seeing as an opportunity for increased civil unrest to build maybe towards a new major false
[3:03:17.020 --> 3:03:22.620]  flag civil war world war i don't basically some major steps to gain control uh you know of the
[3:03:22.620 --> 3:03:29.660]  of the overall situation again well i just can't believe that we sit here and we calmly talk about
[3:03:29.660 --> 3:03:35.580]  all this when they're in the most prestigious establishment mouthpieces like atlantic monthly
[3:03:35.580 --> 3:03:41.580]  saying let's have an overthrow through cog suspend congress say all republicans or russian agents
[3:03:41.580 --> 3:03:45.820]  have a one party dictatorship i mean they're actually pushing that and they have the former
[3:03:45.820 --> 3:03:50.700]  deputy of the defense department traveling to the pentagon promoting the violent overthrow
[3:03:50.700 --> 3:03:54.220]  imagine you're like walking the pentagon i'm here to promote the violent overthrow
[3:03:55.500 --> 3:03:59.340]  and then they're all over the news saying kill trump and then we say well what do we do if they
[3:03:59.340 --> 3:04:03.180]  try this and i go oh my god alex wants violence he wants whatever they're the ones trying to
[3:04:03.180 --> 3:04:08.300]  organize violence against us and you know in between when they're out well not spitting on
[3:04:08.300 --> 3:04:15.180]  memorials in dc for communist victims i'm just like god almighty but they're such scum it won't
[3:04:15.180 --> 3:04:21.500]  even be satisfying to defeat them except we get them off the backs of our children so that's why
[3:04:21.500 --> 3:04:26.060]  i don't have any fear i'm just like okay but the problems they want to start a war with russia
[3:04:26.060 --> 3:04:31.340]  they're like a moth to flame like the idea of thermal nuclear war is so sexy to them that
[3:04:32.540 --> 3:04:37.340]  they just might blow the planet up in some like you know orgasm of pervertedness i don't know
[3:04:37.340 --> 3:04:41.100]  but brandon thank you so much i'm gonna come back and introduce roger stone straight ahead
[3:04:41.100 --> 3:04:45.420]  i'm gonna go get the article red linked there's no it's a it don't matter how many hours it takes
[3:04:45.420 --> 3:04:51.100]  i'm getting that article red linked on info wars dot com about the deep state admits plan to
[3:04:51.100 --> 3:04:55.020]  volley overthrow trump we're gonna email that out we're gonna facebook and we're gonna twitter
[3:04:55.020 --> 3:05:01.900]  there it is it's red linked oh my god it's so satisfying los angeles mayor eric garcetti
[3:05:01.900 --> 3:05:06.460]  chicago mayor ron emmanuel and new york city council members have all thought back against
[3:05:06.460 --> 3:05:11.260]  jeff sessions threat to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities this is an interesting choice
[3:05:11.260 --> 3:05:16.060]  to make considering the very concept of sanctuary cities permits breaking the law and all of the
[3:05:16.060 --> 3:05:20.460]  new stories surfacing daily regarding illegal immigrants committing violent crime how about
[3:05:20.460 --> 3:05:25.340]  this from the daily caller the same day these cities said they would remain sanctuary cities
[3:05:25.340 --> 3:05:30.380]  three iraq refugees arrested in association with a terrorist omitting information on refugee
[3:05:30.380 --> 3:05:35.580]  applications lying about background information and one is associated with a multiple hostage
[3:05:35.580 --> 3:05:40.540]  situation in an underground bunker but in these cities they would be welcome right back this is
[3:05:40.540 --> 3:05:45.500]  an example of how partisan the anti-trump extreme leftist liberals have become they've abandoned
[3:05:45.500 --> 3:05:50.700]  all logic common sense and even the rule of law if this is going on in a city near you i would
[3:05:50.700 --> 3:05:55.820]  either get out or call your local leaders to let them know if they stand for this they no longer
[3:05:55.820 --> 3:06:03.100]  have your vote for info wars dot com this is oan shroyer this is alex jones i want to tell you about

[3:08:32.300 --> 3:08:39.740]  authoritarian scam you can find openly working with the pakistani government to arrest and
[3:08:39.740 --> 3:08:46.300]  behead people that criticize islam in any way facebook helps pakistan identify

[3:08:57.580 --> 3:09:02.860]  he's got a big live presentation i just saw democratic congressman another press conference
[3:09:02.860 --> 3:09:08.860]  is devastating intel they've got communicates intercepts of trump being a russian spy basically
[3:09:09.500 --> 3:09:13.820]  but first they said that months ago then there was nothing there then they said trump's crazy
[3:09:13.820 --> 3:09:18.060]  we never spied on him now that that's all falling apart because of new ness and others
[3:09:18.060 --> 3:09:22.300]  and all the new york times headline saying he was being spied on trump they've now gone back to
[3:09:22.300 --> 3:09:27.500]  guess we have the shocking info and we want the intel released to the public so now we're back three
[3:09:27.500 --> 3:09:33.340]  months ago it's like would be comical if it wasn't so serious and then my one question roger
[3:09:33.340 --> 3:09:40.300]  you can take over the breakdown is on info wars dot com democrats in the deep state admit plan
[3:09:40.300 --> 3:09:45.340]  to violently overthrow trump have a six month suspension of congress and they're saying all
[3:09:45.340 --> 3:09:49.660]  republicans are suspect maybe they're not even allowed to be in government now that's their
[3:09:49.660 --> 3:09:54.220]  answer to 900 house seats for the republicans an old bunch of governorships and winning the house
[3:09:54.220 --> 3:09:59.500]  and senate and about to take over the supreme court just oh you're all illegitimate the bureaucracy
[3:09:59.500 --> 3:10:06.860]  and msm the opposition party we're deciding you're all russian agents while podesta is literally
[3:10:06.860 --> 3:10:14.140]  and his brother has the ruski's arm up their derrieres for lack of a better term so uh roger
[3:10:14.140 --> 3:10:20.540]  stone i gotta tell you uh this is quite a time to be alive right now and i know we're winning i know
[3:10:21.100 --> 3:10:26.060]  that that that people are waking up culturally they're the briggs that's happening nationalism
[3:10:26.060 --> 3:10:30.860]  is exploding prosperity capitalism hey better than soviet union better than venezuela but they
[3:10:30.860 --> 3:10:36.060]  don't care they seem like they call the death battle they're in a death battle with us so
[3:10:36.060 --> 3:10:40.380]  what do you make of and i hope you'll help me get the word out that they're in atlantic monthly
[3:10:40.380 --> 3:10:45.340]  saying what i predicted they would do because they're using c o g i have my sources c i a you
[3:10:45.340 --> 3:10:49.580]  name it they're actually doing headcounts right now and trying to see who will try to do an arm
[3:10:49.580 --> 3:10:53.500]  to salt on the president you know they're not going to want him to come out of this alive
[3:10:53.500 --> 3:10:58.380]  i know we privately talked about this at dinner before he was even elected that trump's fully
[3:10:58.380 --> 3:11:03.580]  aware of it is it time to reveal that trump's been aware the whole time and obviously surrounding
[3:11:03.580 --> 3:11:09.180]  himself with generals he's not stupid and don't say that in bravada i do it in the hope the leftist
[3:11:09.180 --> 3:11:13.900]  don't we're not trying to trick them into an attempted coup so we can like roll them all up we
[3:11:13.900 --> 3:11:18.860]  want them to stop they could even keep their stolen money you know like you know napoleon
[3:11:18.860 --> 3:11:25.420]  going to alba but they've got to stop roger stone uh alex i think you're exactly right i think we
[3:11:25.420 --> 3:11:31.100]  have the maggots uh on the run you know my mother once told me that if you wanted to disperse a
[3:11:31.100 --> 3:11:37.420]  group of cockroaches that you needed to cast light on them and that is exactly what's happened uh in
[3:11:37.420 --> 3:11:45.580]  the plan you talk about um is a result of the hysteria uh because they have figured out that
[3:11:45.580 --> 3:11:53.820]  we now understand that the entire russian collusion uh with trump argument is a confection
[3:11:54.700 --> 3:12:03.580]  it is a scandal with no evidence whatsoever but it was used as the rationale as the uh as the
[3:12:03.580 --> 3:12:12.300]  justification for spying watergate style on first candidate trump and then president elect trump
[3:12:12.860 --> 3:12:22.220]  so as the russian meme collapses for lack of evidence they now realize that not only are there
[3:12:23.020 --> 3:12:31.020]  naked political motives exposed but they have serious legal liability in both wiretapping
[3:12:31.020 --> 3:12:36.700]  or i should say surveilling the president's and then the way they shared that quote on quote
[3:12:36.700 --> 3:12:45.020]  intelligence that is why the democrats including chuck schumer this this charlatan adam schiff
[3:12:45.900 --> 3:12:52.940]  are desperately trying to shut down the investigation by chairman uh devin newness the chairman is
[3:12:52.940 --> 3:12:58.620]  getting much too close to the truth alex he is going to expose that they lied about having our
[3:12:58.620 --> 3:13:06.220]  president uh under surveillance for political reasons this is a bigger broader scandal than
[3:13:06.220 --> 3:13:10.540]  watergate and what do you make of the former known to bring uh obviously dr corcy in here
[3:13:10.540 --> 3:13:16.220]  info wars dot com dc bureau chief he's setting up we have secretary of defense uh assistant
[3:13:16.220 --> 3:13:22.300]  secretary of defense evelin farkas under obama who had at the russian program he's a big russian
[3:13:22.300 --> 3:13:27.420]  fob saying what we already knew from the news that they were spying on trump the problem
[3:13:27.420 --> 3:13:32.540]  is no evidence was found so now they've gone from denying that they were spying back to oh yes we
[3:13:32.540 --> 3:13:38.620]  spied we have evidence as if we have no memory this is simply astounding well in their bluff has
[3:13:38.620 --> 3:13:45.100]  been called um in the senate uh intelligence committee and in the house intelligence committee
[3:13:45.100 --> 3:13:51.420]  paul manifor and i i also read this fellow carter page i'm ready to testify could we do it tomorrow
[3:13:51.420 --> 3:14:01.500]  please and how about doing it in public so we can deflate this entire uh russian collusion uh myth
[3:14:01.500 --> 3:14:07.660]  but in a clever invention of john pedesta i must admit because it distracted all of us
[3:14:08.220 --> 3:14:12.460]  from his business dealings and the clinton's business dealings with bouton
[3:14:12.460 --> 3:14:19.020]  in sent us on a wild goose chase to try to find non-existent ties between trump and the rooster
[3:14:19.020 --> 3:14:23.820]  by the way we don't put a confidence act in here when we thought trump might lose we admitted we
[3:14:23.820 --> 3:14:27.180]  knew he was winning we'd say it i mean we really are putting out what we truly believe from our
[3:14:27.180 --> 3:14:32.140]  research they're in desperate straits i mean they've been totally caught trump is out maneuvered them
[3:14:32.140 --> 3:14:37.100]  they released secret info lied about what was in it got caught doing it now they now they're back
[3:14:37.100 --> 3:14:41.740]  to saying we have the evidence uh i mean they must think they're constituents of the biggest morons
[3:14:41.740 --> 3:14:46.380]  on earth let's bring in dr corsey to get his take on this i'ma turn it over to you right now roger
[3:14:46.380 --> 3:14:51.660]  stone just briefly we're under attack they're trying for us to be shut down the democratic party is

[3:15:58.380 --> 3:16:06.460]  us so that we can break through the mainstream media blackout on the truth uh i asked dr jerry
[3:16:06.460 --> 3:16:11.580]  coursey to join us today not only because i think that he is perhaps the finest investigative
[3:16:11.580 --> 3:16:17.980]  reporter working in washington today he's also a full disclosure a close friend but because he
[3:16:17.980 --> 3:16:26.700]  is the one who did seminal work uh on the uh activities of john and tony padesta uh and the
[3:16:26.700 --> 3:16:35.100]  clinton foundation and bill and hillary and the other knew of putin associates with whom they were
[3:16:35.100 --> 3:16:38.140]  involved and by the way i'm going to skip this break seven more time but i'm going to just add
[3:16:38.140 --> 3:16:42.540]  the caveat thomas friedman has written a tongue-in-cheek piece but that's how it always starts
[3:16:43.260 --> 3:16:47.820]  saying trump is a chinese agent because trump's exposing the real threat to our sovereignty the
[3:16:47.820 --> 3:16:52.300]  infiltration now they're saying he's a chinese agent in the new york times we should probably add
[3:16:52.300 --> 3:16:57.340]  that in so they're taking all our talking points that trumps accurately putting out that are dead
[3:16:57.340 --> 3:17:02.300]  on they're now inverting it in desperation so sorry go ahead you know you're exactly right alex
[3:17:02.300 --> 3:17:09.820]  last week they were saying that you and info wars are funded by the russians so now you're a russian
[3:17:09.820 --> 3:17:19.500]  agent as well this is the new mccarthyism anyone who isn't for nuclear war over syria is uh is a
[3:17:19.500 --> 3:17:25.340]  treasonous rat is uh is uh in line with putin it's it's an assault we don't want doddering
[3:17:25.340 --> 3:17:30.140]  loons like maxine waters and antsy blows she's starting a nuclear war we love our kids in your
[3:17:30.140 --> 3:17:36.140]  case grandkids so we're bad dr. corsie your breakdown on this well i i think that you're both
[3:17:36.140 --> 3:17:43.420]  exactly right i mean first of all the truth is that the money connections i have always been
[3:17:43.420 --> 3:17:50.620]  between putin and the democrats uh the hillary was funded by putin and and pedestal was very
[3:17:50.620 --> 3:17:56.460]  extensively we've demonstrated that in any number of articles it's been uh reaffirmed by peter schweitzer
[3:17:56.460 --> 3:18:01.340]  and the government accountability institute we just go through it you start with hillary's
[3:18:01.340 --> 3:18:08.060]  decision and working with frank jew strop in canada when they ultimately made this decision to get
[3:18:08.060 --> 3:18:14.620]  20 percent of the us uranium uh in the hands of russia and from that flowed all kinds of contributions
[3:18:14.620 --> 3:18:21.020]  to the clinton foundation clinton foundation still never been investigated i've demonstrated
[3:18:21.020 --> 3:18:26.380]  in my book partners in crime uh you've got charles or tell who's been added for two years showing
[3:18:26.380 --> 3:18:32.860]  that clinton foundation is nothing but a criminal organization so it's a scheme it's a fraud it's not
[3:18:32.860 --> 3:18:39.980]  a charity less than five percent in most cases of the money clinton foundation receives actually goes
[3:18:39.980 --> 3:18:48.300]  any charitable purpose uh then fedesta and the ties with fedestacy it's if you start with hillary
[3:18:48.300 --> 3:18:56.220]  clinton and fedesta and the reset under the obama administration you realize which one cover is that
[3:18:56.220 --> 3:19:02.540]  hillary and fedesta were selling us technology technology transferred to russia and russia
[3:19:02.540 --> 3:19:08.780]  was paying them both handsomely uh the clittens have passed through accounts which is you know what
[3:19:08.780 --> 3:19:14.620]  criminals set up they've never been investigated i am this whole idea is ludicrous to think that
[3:19:14.620 --> 3:19:22.620]  donald trump is going to be investigated for ties with russia when a criminal vex let's vexelberg
[3:19:22.620 --> 3:19:30.140]  billionaire criminal in russia just about own john fedesta they'll put 35 uh million dollars into
[3:19:30.140 --> 3:19:38.460]  foundation groups that fedesta was running fedesta stock in phony corporations that were set up in
[3:19:38.460 --> 3:19:45.580]  the netherlands in the cayman islands uh the whole russia gate connection really goes with the fact
[3:19:45.580 --> 3:19:51.260]  that what hillary and fedesta were desperately concerned about especially even before the
[3:19:51.260 --> 3:19:56.380]  wiki leaks roger and i were working on this way before the wiki leaks ever came out remember you
[3:19:56.380 --> 3:20:00.380]  guys were on writing articles over a year and a half ago so they know we've got a russia problem
[3:20:00.380 --> 3:20:05.820]  what do we do we project it on the trump he wants peace he wants to block radicalism of russia we
[3:20:05.820 --> 3:20:11.580]  just have the media says a russian agent that way it distracts off us and bare minimum we can never
[3:20:11.580 --> 3:20:17.740]  have detente and a peace that's good and maybe even better we just take over the whole government
[3:20:17.740 --> 3:20:23.660]  saying they're all riskies well and see that yeah we take a hard look at it just you know one more
[3:20:23.660 --> 3:20:29.740]  point the the real evidence is that it was always and always has been the democrats who have been
[3:20:29.740 --> 3:20:35.900]  light on russia we went from beginning with when obama said that he was going to be more flexible
[3:20:35.900 --> 3:20:41.020]  in the second term to medvedev didn't think that the mic was live and it was picked up and just
[3:20:41.020 --> 3:20:47.100]  look at the series of events that have occurred russia goes into ukraine into Crimea but it's all
[3:20:47.100 --> 3:20:51.420]  total projection so where is it going as the narrative collapses because doctor course you're
[3:20:51.420 --> 3:20:56.780]  great stone you're great i mean the point is this is important we now have won the debate so where
[3:20:56.780 --> 3:21:03.740]  do they go next well i don't understand this go ahead roger i'm not sure we have i'm not sure
[3:21:03.740 --> 3:21:09.900]  unfortunately that we have completely won the debate i think there are many people in denial
[3:21:09.900 --> 3:21:15.580]  about what the podestas have done here the key thing to remember is because podesta hid his
[3:21:15.580 --> 3:21:22.700]  interest and didn't properly uh reported as required by law he is now blackmailable by
[3:21:22.700 --> 3:21:29.740]  the putin administration or the putin regime uh given the fact that as doctor course he points
[3:21:29.740 --> 3:21:38.460]  out in the so-called reset they bludgeon technology transfers out of obama and hillary clinton they
[3:21:38.460 --> 3:21:46.140]  let him venture into korea and maraud in ukraine did nothing they allowed uh the russian military
[3:21:46.140 --> 3:21:53.500]  in syria still did nothing and now they come along and tell us manifold and stone and trump were in
[3:21:53.500 --> 3:22:01.260]  putin's pocket uh and uh it's time to get tough on putin so uh we must give the people a refresher
[3:22:01.260 --> 3:22:08.540]  about the clinton's corruption uh and the fact that when i wrote podesta's time in the peril will come
[3:22:08.540 --> 3:22:14.700]  we were referring to this enormous body of corruption which thanks to dr coursey and other fine
[3:22:14.700 --> 3:22:21.020]  journalists did become a matter of public record uh this is what they were hiding and this was the
[3:22:21.020 --> 3:22:29.020]  motivation for the fake russian collusion claim dr coursey well in fact roger and i have been
[3:22:29.020 --> 3:22:36.620]  working starting really in july and august last year on these podesta connections i started writing
[3:22:36.620 --> 3:22:43.580]  some articles started researching it we had a peter schweizer's report from russia with money
[3:22:43.580 --> 3:22:49.420]  which was very important in revealing a lot of these connections i started writing for roger
[3:22:49.420 --> 3:22:57.340]  a very detailed memo that was dated august 31st and that would in fact when roger did tweet
[3:22:57.980 --> 3:23:03.340]  saying uh you know some things are going to come out on podesta he's going to basically get his
[3:23:03.340 --> 3:23:09.260]  that was in relationship to what he knew i was developing we were both going to write articles
[3:23:09.260 --> 3:23:16.300]  on and in fact roger and i wrote articles on the podesta corruption money to the clinton from russia
[3:23:16.300 --> 3:23:23.180]  almost at the same time our articles came out right after my august 31 memo in september we
[3:23:23.180 --> 3:23:28.700]  were both publishing on this object and it had nothing to do with the wiki leaks which didn't
[3:23:28.700 --> 3:23:33.980]  really come out until october so the democrats you know being manipulated by the chinese and the
[3:23:33.980 --> 3:23:38.540]  russians is well documented the point is in the listeners all know they listen that you guys are
[3:23:38.540 --> 3:23:44.940]  informed they understand that this is established where do they go from here though well i think
[3:23:44.940 --> 3:23:49.740]  they've already go ahead roger you go ahead you take it first well the next big fight is over the
[3:23:49.740 --> 3:23:55.740]  house intelligence committee hearings because this is only this is the only place where these matters
[3:23:55.740 --> 3:24:00.380]  can be openly and i love how they attack us all by name and now say i'm under criminal investigation
[3:24:00.380 --> 3:24:05.260]  being directed by the russians what the hell i mean now i should be in the senate i want to go in
[3:24:05.260 --> 3:24:09.820]  there and chew their ass i want to go before the house and say what the hell's your problem
[3:24:09.820 --> 3:24:15.660]  well look here's some breaking news right here at info wars dot com i have learned that senator
[3:24:15.660 --> 3:24:24.780]  john mccain met privately with oleg daripaska the uh the billionaire oligarch who has been connected
[3:24:24.780 --> 3:24:33.020]  to a paul manifold and i'm told that the reason for this meeting was to solicit funds to assist
[3:24:33.020 --> 3:24:39.820]  is a presidential campaign through a nonprofit that can take foreign monies well so more projection
[3:24:39.820 --> 3:24:46.380]  senator mccain must become before the senate and explain what he was doing in this secret meeting
[3:24:46.380 --> 3:24:51.980]  with one of putin's closest ally there's your headline daripaska let's take that the very
[3:24:51.980 --> 3:24:55.340]  start of this interview when we put it on youtube right at the first boom that piece
[3:24:55.340 --> 3:25:00.540]  john mccain breaking john mccain met with uh met secretly with putin's right hand man
[3:25:00.540 --> 3:25:08.780]  mccain caught working for russia hell so he needs to clear the air on this i mean i am very
[3:25:09.740 --> 3:25:15.900]  upset to learn that he was colluding with a a known agent of let's go back to course
[3:25:15.900 --> 3:25:19.100]  see them back to you then i'm gonna get out of here but this is a great discussion
[3:25:19.660 --> 3:25:23.020]  is so what you're saying is you report this again before wiki leaks you guys are on record
[3:25:23.020 --> 3:25:27.740]  absolutely it's true they've got such a russia and china problem that there's such cellos to foreign
[3:25:27.740 --> 3:25:33.660]  powers that they they were scared of trump coming in and they knew the intelligence agencies
[3:25:33.660 --> 3:25:38.060]  wanted trump because they're sick of the sellout to globalism period which just means you're like
[3:25:38.060 --> 3:25:42.300]  a two dollar whore to the whole world you show up the american interest that's why they project
[3:25:42.300 --> 3:25:46.300]  all this and everybody else because they're literally guilty of everything they've said
[3:25:47.340 --> 3:25:51.900]  right i mean there's i can't think of a single instance in the obama administration where the
[3:25:51.900 --> 3:25:58.140]  obama administration really stood up to russia it constantly there was capitulation you know
[3:25:58.140 --> 3:26:05.180]  drawing red lines in syria uh the negotiations and and doing nothing when russia sends in the
[3:26:05.180 --> 3:26:13.180]  military including the air force from russia into syria same in iran very closely tied to russia
[3:26:14.300 --> 3:26:20.700]  john predestined and you know together with uh john carrey in the entire obama administration
[3:26:20.700 --> 3:26:27.980]  hillary supported it too they negotiated a deal with iran that basically gave iran a green light
[3:26:27.980 --> 3:26:32.940]  to develop nuclear weapons it's a it's not an enforceable agreement so are you saying there's
[3:26:32.940 --> 3:26:38.060]  really no policy we're just sold out to the heist better well there's a word the clinton see this
[3:26:38.060 --> 3:26:43.580]  is the problem the clinton said this is what the clinton foundation was all about it's not only
[3:26:44.140 --> 3:26:49.500]  played a paid scheme it was a scheme of which the enormity they were sure so trump shouldn't be on
[3:26:49.500 --> 3:26:53.340]  his heels because they're calling him all these names shouldn't session already be beginning
[3:26:53.340 --> 3:26:58.780]  the criminal investigation isn't it time for offense well in fact i thought that was encouraging to
[3:26:58.780 --> 3:27:04.540]  see down trouble for the weekend beginning tweet saying why isn't this russian investigation
[3:27:04.540 --> 3:27:11.420]  including the uranium deal with hillary why isn't including the jolly stock that that predestined
[3:27:11.420 --> 3:27:19.900]  got from from russia or his involvement with vexelber the billionaire criminal in russia very
[3:27:19.900 --> 3:27:25.660]  tightly cannot tie the Putin and how about all the deals they were making that we now had disclosed
[3:27:25.660 --> 3:27:31.500]  roger and i were starting we published both in october my article started on october 6 roger
[3:27:31.500 --> 3:27:39.340]  started october 13 from the research we were doing much of what we based on the report from russia
[3:27:39.340 --> 3:27:45.980]  with money that peter schweitzer did excellent report again google even changed by the way the
[3:27:45.980 --> 3:27:50.780]  link to that i had to get in touch with roger you know with roger and then with peter schweitzer
[3:27:50.780 --> 3:27:55.660]  and say peter you know google is not even linking to your report any longer from russia to love
[3:27:55.660 --> 3:28:02.060]  they had to fix that with with the government accountability institute asking basically checking
[3:28:02.060 --> 3:28:06.940]  why the google link no longer works now we've got the democrats in a lifetime manipulating google
[3:28:06.940 --> 3:28:11.580]  and all this censorship coming in it's an amazing time to be alive right now i'm going to go but
[3:28:11.580 --> 3:28:15.340]  i want to hear what you guys have to say obviously about how trump's doing where you see him going
[3:28:15.340 --> 3:28:21.500]  now you know 70 days in i think today's like day 70 but amazing so you know thanks for letting me
[3:28:21.500 --> 3:28:28.860]  pop in alex thanks for letting us have the opportunity here this is the only place that one
[3:28:28.860 --> 3:28:36.940]  can really get the truth about what's happening in washington uh... the the democrats have unleashed
[3:28:36.940 --> 3:28:44.860]  a harsh attack on chairman devin newness of the house intelligence committee to me uh this guy
[3:28:44.860 --> 3:28:50.460]  is a profile in courage he did exactly the right thing when he learned in fact that the president
[3:28:50.460 --> 3:28:59.260]  of the united states was being uh in uh uh uh illegally uh or at least surreptitiously surveilled
[3:28:59.260 --> 3:29:05.100]  he took that evidence to the president uh he knew of course that if he took it to the minority
[3:29:05.100 --> 3:29:12.060]  members of his committee uh they would work to uh leak it and discredit it um they are desperate
[3:29:12.060 --> 3:29:19.420]  to just re derail this investigation because i think this is the stage on which all of their
[3:29:19.420 --> 3:29:27.260]  lies and fabrications can be exposed we'll be back with dr jerry corsie to lay out where this is
[3:29:27.260 --> 3:29:39.260]  going before you hear it info wars coming up next
[3:29:39.260 --> 3:29:55.900]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:30:00.140 --> 3:30:05.100]  while some liberal cities are fighting for the rights of law-breaking non-citizen migrants others
[3:30:05.100 --> 3:30:09.980]  are cutting funds to schools that are too white walter reid middle school in north hollywood
[3:30:09.980 --> 3:30:15.420]  is having funds cut because their school student body is too white and this has led to layoffs
[3:30:15.420 --> 3:30:20.540]  and increased class sizes think schools have issues leave it to democrats to make it worse
[3:30:20.540 --> 3:30:25.340]  think about this if the tables return if republicans were moving funds from schools because they were
[3:30:25.340 --> 3:30:30.540]  too black to schools that had a more diverse student body there would be outrage and rightfully so
[3:30:30.540 --> 3:30:35.100]  but this is what democrats are doing while shaming anyone who makes decisions or judgments
[3:30:35.100 --> 3:30:40.380]  based on someone's identity the democrats make policy based on identity while shaming people
[3:30:40.380 --> 3:30:45.100]  who make policy based on identity what do you expect in california where they continue to
[3:30:45.100 --> 3:30:51.500]  elect people like nancy polosi and maxine waters two mentally ill politicians that appear to have
[3:30:51.500 --> 3:30:58.540]  no clue what's even going on america let's stop electing morons for info wars dot com this is
[3:30:58.540 --> 3:31:03.180]  oan schreuer it's not just our water we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be
[3:31:03.180 --> 3:31:08.300]  cleaned it's the air we're breathing especially for our children the artificial particulates
[3:31:08.300 --> 3:31:14.220]  the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems the same team based right here
[3:31:14.220 --> 3:31:19.500]  in america that brought you the elects of pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now
[3:31:19.500 --> 3:31:25.260]  developed elects of pure breeze whether it's your home or office yo it's yourself your co-workers
[3:31:25.260 --> 3:31:30.540]  your family your children do the best job you can to purify your air the elite are masters
[3:31:30.540 --> 3:31:35.980]  at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic
[3:31:35.980 --> 3:31:42.060]  effects for themselves the general public doesn't the elects of pure breeze would be a steel at 300
[3:31:42.060 --> 3:31:47.820]  400 500 dollars one of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean this is a system
[3:31:47.820 --> 3:31:51.900]  i'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older more expensive filters that

[3:35:50.860 --> 3:35:58.780]  analysis of how the entire rise of alternative media broke the backs of the mainstream media

[3:36:27.820 --> 3:36:35.900]  fluoride toothpaste since she has the whitest smile of anyone i know i highly commend it to you
[3:36:35.900 --> 3:36:45.900]  now let us go back to dr corcy um i think we have explored the fact that the podestas uh were in
[3:36:45.900 --> 3:36:52.860]  putin's pocket they had a lucrative deal with the state gas utility a lucrative banking deal in
[3:36:52.860 --> 3:37:01.260]  which they were gifted stock in a phony company involved in more money laundering uh their presence
[3:37:01.260 --> 3:37:11.500]  in russia is very clear uh and that the russian collusion argument uh is a is a figment of john
[3:37:11.500 --> 3:37:22.460]  podesta's fertile strategic imagination now in washington the uh the russian meme has collapsed
[3:37:22.460 --> 3:37:31.740]  but and this is very key uh we now realize that it was the rationalization the defense
[3:37:32.780 --> 3:37:43.740]  for the continued surveillance of donald j trump dr corcy broke what should have been a page one
[3:37:43.740 --> 3:37:53.340]  story in every newspaper in the country and that is that donald trump has been under surveillance
[3:37:53.340 --> 3:38:00.460]  that he was under surveillance uh beginning in the end of the bush administration that he
[3:38:00.460 --> 3:38:09.340]  was under surveillance uh on into the obama administration and that the nsa has had a
[3:38:09.340 --> 3:38:17.260]  secret program uh codenamed um uh dragnet somebody with no imagination came up with
[3:38:17.260 --> 3:38:24.940]  that one uh and they were tracking and recording monitoring and recording the phone calls of
[3:38:24.940 --> 3:38:31.660]  numerous into the hundreds of prominent americans and there is no reason to believe that this
[3:38:31.660 --> 3:38:38.220]  surveillance stopped so um if trump was not under surveillance he's one of the few americans who
[3:38:38.220 --> 3:38:46.380]  wasn't dr corcy this was a land just a landmark story and i woke up the next store the next morning
[3:38:46.380 --> 3:38:51.420]  and i said well certainly this will be on page one of the new york times and the washington post
[3:38:51.420 --> 3:39:01.020]  and it will lead on cnn not so tell us about this nefarious federal program well i mean first of all
[3:39:01.020 --> 3:39:09.420]  it started this whole nsa wiretapping started in 2004 and this is a database we got it came from
[3:39:10.220 --> 3:39:17.580]  michael zulu who basically had been working that we released materials that had that like zulu and
[3:39:17.580 --> 3:39:22.300]  chair of our panel's office in maricopa county had been trying to get into the federal record
[3:39:23.020 --> 3:39:29.420]  for years the data that we had showed that there had been wiretapping and really electronic
[3:39:29.420 --> 3:39:35.660]  surveillance not only of uh donald trump but donald trump in a lot of different locations
[3:39:35.660 --> 3:39:40.540]  it's donald trump in york city i'm just reading through the list right now uh trump hotels in
[3:39:40.540 --> 3:39:49.500]  atlantic city his golf courses mar a lago in florida all these different locations for trump in fact
[3:39:49.500 --> 3:39:57.580]  even some of the limousine companies uh that trump had used in those years 2004 through 2009
[3:39:57.580 --> 3:40:02.780]  which is the first year of the obama administration uh we're all under electronic surveillance
[3:40:02.780 --> 3:40:08.860]  and it wasn't only donald trump it was donald trump and his his family his wife is in here
[3:40:09.500 --> 3:40:15.980]  as well as his employees they had a property manager at 69 west 69th street in new york
[3:40:16.940 --> 3:40:24.380]  they had his golf course managers in florida i mean this is it just goes on and on but it was
[3:40:24.380 --> 3:40:30.780]  extensive project dragnet it was operation dragnet surveillance of trump and everybody
[3:40:30.780 --> 3:40:36.060]  related to trump and it extended into his financial records his tax records bank accounts
[3:40:36.060 --> 3:40:40.780]  credit cards as well as electronic surveillance you know donald trump could probably go to the
[3:40:40.780 --> 3:40:49.260]  nsa and say let me back my conversation from uh you know section such a date in 2007 they could
[3:40:49.260 --> 3:40:53.100]  say that you know there are 25 of them where you want to start they're probably still out of the
[3:40:53.100 --> 3:40:59.900]  mall on record yeah i think it's important people realize that these documents grow out of a uh of
[3:40:59.900 --> 3:41:07.900]  a federal trial uh in arizona where it was essentially proved that the uh the government
[3:41:07.900 --> 3:41:15.660]  was spying on sheriff apio during a time that they were attempting to prosecute him most likely
[3:41:15.660 --> 3:41:21.580]  eavesdropping on conversations between the sheriff and his lawyers a rather large no no
[3:41:21.580 --> 3:41:30.060]  as you know the government is mortified that info wars broke this story i stress that we have not
[3:41:30.060 --> 3:41:37.340]  released classified information we have taken databases that were built on disclosures confirmed
[3:41:37.340 --> 3:41:45.980]  by the way by a number of whistleblowers within the cia as to the authenticity and the accuracy
[3:41:45.980 --> 3:41:54.780]  of of these matters so um it is bigger than watergate i mean you around in those days jerry as i
[3:41:54.780 --> 3:42:01.340]  recall a small band of civilians misguided civilians attempted to break into the democratic
[3:42:01.340 --> 3:42:08.860]  national committee uh and place bugs that were antiquated in an attempt to overhear the conversations
[3:42:08.860 --> 3:42:15.900]  of democratic national chairman larry o bryan contrast that with the use of the entire federal
[3:42:15.900 --> 3:42:25.100]  machinery in an unconstitutional way to spy on a prominent american citizen who would become
[3:42:25.100 --> 3:42:33.980]  president it boggles the mind and the excuse or the defense what we had to spy on trump because
[3:42:33.980 --> 3:42:41.260]  he's colluding with the russians well that's collapsing before your very eyes this very
[3:42:41.260 --> 3:42:49.660]  moment this explains the panic in the mainstream media the panic uh in the democratic uh uh uh
[3:42:49.660 --> 3:42:58.940]  caucuses and why chuck schumer and adam schiff are desperate to uh to derail chairman newness's
[3:42:58.940 --> 3:43:05.580]  investigation oh and you're gonna find but if there was anyone that rutan wanted to win the
[3:43:05.580 --> 3:43:12.940]  election in 2016 it was hillary clinton with her top advisor campaign chairman john podesta
[3:43:12.940 --> 3:43:19.020]  because they were the number one category had the candidates for prudent blackmail with all the
[3:43:19.020 --> 3:43:23.900]  money that hillary had received in the bank accounts that money had gone through and i've
[3:43:23.900 --> 3:43:30.860]  published bank account records for the clinton foundation tied to russia done for podesta tied
[3:43:30.860 --> 3:43:38.940]  to russia i had a podesta's brother who is a lobbyist didn't report it right away but for one of the
[3:43:38.940 --> 3:43:46.540]  criminal russian banks and the podesta's were pooten was all over the hillary found bill
[3:43:46.540 --> 3:43:54.300]  hillary clinton foundation pooten was all over podesta and his brother owned them and was prepared
[3:43:54.300 --> 3:43:59.260]  to cure in hillary one to produce all these records and the democrats are desperately
[3:43:59.260 --> 3:44:04.780]  afraid of that they won't have hillary be investigated as part of this uh senator or
[3:44:04.780 --> 3:44:09.740]  house intelligence committee investigation but that's where it should start pooten's
[3:44:09.740 --> 3:44:15.020]  you know laughing at all this i mean you gotta get a perspective on this by the way the democrats
[3:44:15.020 --> 3:44:21.500]  always change the man the change the narrative uh first you know it was um they knew that you know
[3:44:21.500 --> 3:44:29.340]  was roger stone had been involved and i and with podesta and i'm sorry with wiki leaks well it's
[3:44:29.340 --> 3:44:36.060]  ridiculous first of all the times don't work you were in touch with lucifer after lucifer revealed
[3:44:36.060 --> 3:44:42.940]  all the information that he had taken and by the way you know what why does anyone think that
[3:44:43.580 --> 3:44:48.380]  astound would need roger stone to hack podesta i mean you know who are you roger computer
[3:44:48.380 --> 3:44:53.020]  genius just spend your evening reading computer programming books are you really a wizard at
[3:44:53.820 --> 3:45:00.620]  hacking i mean i don't think i don't think that astound needed your help at all more likely that
[3:45:00.620 --> 3:45:08.220]  these documents were walked out of the podesta's office by someone who was upset at the treatment
[3:45:08.220 --> 3:45:13.500]  the bernie sanders have been given and by the way let's go to the real heart of the issue the real
[3:45:13.500 --> 3:45:20.860]  problem here is that it wasn't the hack that destroyed hillary it was all that podesta had
[3:45:20.860 --> 3:45:26.540]  written in these hacks the corruption that was rampant in the democratic party the stealing of
[3:45:26.540 --> 3:45:33.500]  the election from bernie sanders the the admission that hillary is a terrible candidate the conspiracy
[3:45:33.500 --> 3:45:40.140]  including with google to get all their data and dump all the data on google clicks and use for them
[3:45:40.140 --> 3:45:46.620]  for money and raising for hillary it goes on and on the corruption was at the heart the stink was
[3:45:46.620 --> 3:45:50.780]  at the heart of the democratic party and that's why the democrats had to say well you know we
[3:45:50.780 --> 3:45:56.380]  couldn't have lost this election somebody had to steal it from us so you know i mean well maybe
[3:45:56.380 --> 3:46:00.700]  roger you should have inspired like hillary clinton and started a foundation maybe you should have
[3:46:00.700 --> 3:46:05.580]  sold russia 20 percent of the iranium of the united states now then we'd really have something to
[3:46:05.580 --> 3:46:10.380]  talk about that's what hillary did nobody cares yeah you should have been like it's it's quite
[3:46:10.380 --> 3:46:15.580]  ordinary yeah you should have been like podesta why didn't you get a bunch of russian stock
[3:46:15.580 --> 3:46:21.180]  yeah where's my god all this money got a trolley and no where is my stock but now i have to i've
[3:46:21.180 --> 3:46:26.780]  gone over the transcript now several times of the performance of this fellow adam schiff
[3:46:26.780 --> 3:46:32.220]  and as you may have seen i said on abc this weekend that i thought he was full of schiff
[3:46:32.220 --> 3:46:41.020]  this guy uses distortions misrepresentations inferences half truths non-truths to weave a
[3:46:41.020 --> 3:46:50.940]  tale which is all conjecture in projection and makes a case that i knew in advance about the
[3:46:50.940 --> 3:47:00.540]  hacking of podesta's email having never said that whatsoever uh he is it is all um conjecture
[3:47:00.540 --> 3:47:07.740]  on his part he has nothing i'm very disappointed jerry that i haven't heard from the house select
[3:47:07.740 --> 3:47:15.260]  committee because i'm anxious to testify i will come voluntarily and i would like to testify in
[3:47:15.260 --> 3:47:24.540]  public having been slimed in public i would like to uh have an opportunity to respond in public
[3:47:24.540 --> 3:47:30.620]  that's the american way and as i said earlier i'm really anxious to be called by the senate
[3:47:30.620 --> 3:47:35.900]  intelligence committee because i want to ask senator mccain i hope well he'll sit in having
[3:47:35.900 --> 3:47:42.380]  attacked me and demanded that i'd be questioned about his secret meeting with olig daripaska the
[3:47:43.260 --> 3:47:50.700]  the tycoon oligarch who is close to putin and what was it that the senator was asking
[3:47:50.700 --> 3:47:59.180]  mr daripaska for i think the american people really need to know this also i think about your
[3:47:59.980 --> 3:48:05.340]  the american people got to understand that the leaking by the obama administration has been
[3:48:05.340 --> 3:48:12.380]  systematic and it's been out of intelligence that they've gotten whenever they've been clearly i think
[3:48:12.380 --> 3:48:18.380]  flinn's case is going to be general flinn's case is going to be the the primer on this when they
[3:48:18.380 --> 3:48:23.820]  found out that general flinn had any ties to turkey which had to be found out through electronics
[3:48:23.820 --> 3:48:30.620]  surveillance it wasn't being made public by general flinn the leak on that which was a crime to leak
[3:48:31.420 --> 3:48:37.660]  is part of the democratic operatives machine who have taken this intelligence game through
[3:48:37.660 --> 3:48:44.220]  electronic surveillance aimed at their political opponents and to release it in public through
[3:48:44.220 --> 3:48:50.380]  leaking it to willing reporters who are sitting there like laugh dogs willing to you know bark
[3:48:50.380 --> 3:48:56.060]  out every day at the press conferences questions that are you know what did you stop beating your
[3:48:56.060 --> 3:49:04.220]  wife type questions about president trump there's no open mind you know first it's shown the ties
[3:49:04.220 --> 3:49:10.940]  between uh putin and and pedestrian history the money ties are extensive the mainstream media
[3:49:10.940 --> 3:49:16.300]  does nothing to cover it flinn foundation is corrupt it is not a foundation but it's a
[3:49:16.300 --> 3:49:23.420]  criminal enterprise the accounting is fraudulent uh no one in the irs or the fbi investigates it
[3:49:23.420 --> 3:49:31.260]  it goes on and on to where you know the to them first is uh well you know the uh this is all
[3:49:31.260 --> 3:49:38.540]  it was all because wiki leaks from the dot the across all these emails well fine you know
[3:49:38.540 --> 3:49:44.140]  did wiki leaks write the emails for podesta i could remember for a while the democrats tried to say
[3:49:44.140 --> 3:49:48.700]  these aren't the real emails they were written they're fake well turned out the emails were
[3:49:48.700 --> 3:49:54.940]  legitimate and wiki leaks prove that through authenticating various of the emails and the
[3:49:54.940 --> 3:50:02.060]  democrats were stuck with the fact for instance that donald brazil head of the dnc was beating
[3:50:02.060 --> 3:50:07.740]  questions the hillary the corruption's solidly on the side of the democrats and they are now
[3:50:07.740 --> 3:50:14.380]  running a witch hunt which you know should make uh joe mccarthy tail gunner joe ought to be rolling
[3:50:14.380 --> 3:50:20.620]  in his grave because here are the democrats who you know since the russian revolution has done
[3:50:20.620 --> 3:50:27.180]  everything they can to support russia are now suddenly russia baiting because they think that
[3:50:27.180 --> 3:50:35.340]  they have a way to embarrass trump well trump you know even putin laughed at it yes trump brought his
[3:50:35.340 --> 3:50:41.340]  beauty pageant over there from said uh you know i think the dossier that came out of london jerry
[3:50:41.340 --> 3:50:46.220]  i'm dr. course i'm afraid we have to end it there thank you for joining us at info wars
