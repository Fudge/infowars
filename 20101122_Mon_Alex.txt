[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:27.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27.000 --> 00:38.000]  We're live, my friends. It is Monday, the 22nd day of November 2010, as we kick off this Thanksgiving week.
[00:38.000 --> 00:45.000]  The TSA is bracing for the opt-outers who don't want to be put in the microwave.
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.000]  I was looking at some of the TSA-released images where they're trying to console the public.
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  Even in the TSA, Naked Body Scan, released images, you can see the bones in people's fingers.
[00:57.000 --> 01:05.000]  The radiation is penetrating that deep, and they admit they've been giving the public de-rezzed images.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  And we've got all these top radiologists and scientists on record saying these things are dangerous.
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  There have been huge developments on that front that's coming up after the break.
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  Also, a great article from the Economic Collapse blog. It's up on infowars.com.
[01:19.000 --> 01:29.000]  Full spectrum dominance. Eight examples of how the government is attempting to take control of our food, our health, our money, and even our dignity.
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  A top U.S. military officer says Al Qaeda threat from Yemen is serious.
[01:34.000 --> 01:45.000]  You notice right as the population says no to the Naked Body Scanners, magically the toner cartridges get mailed, and now that there's more pressure, Yemen's going to try to strike.
[01:45.000 --> 02:01.000]  And I noticed that two days before the German bomb event of last week, magically the Germans were saying that they were bracing for more bombs on planes.
[02:01.000 --> 02:21.000]  German government warns a possible November terror attack, and then there was a bomb last, what, Friday on that German plane, or Thursday, and it turned out over the weekend it was the U.S. government.
[02:21.000 --> 02:32.000]  Now, the evidence shows that's what happened with the printer cartridges, and the British government said these are not bombs, and Obama said, I'm giving a press conference. They are bombs. Check them again.
[02:32.000 --> 02:44.000]  It's kind of like Bush saying, Saddam did have WMDs. My daddy sold them to them. Check the receipt. You know, that's a popular joke, but that's basically what went on there.
[02:44.000 --> 02:57.000]  So you need to check those bombs again, because like Karnak, the Magnificent, back to the days of Johnny Carson putting the envelope up to his head and saying, yes, let me see what it may be.
[02:57.000 --> 03:06.000]  It's the same thing here. The British say this is not a bomb, and Obama's like, yes it is. I'm 6,000 miles away. Yes it is.
[03:06.000 --> 03:22.000]  They stand to gain from it. They get to fear monger, shirt off, and others get to make millions of dollars individually. Off of the machines being put in, we get trained how to be slaves, and in plain view of everyone,
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  Obama tells them, you need to re-diagnose those packages, and oh, guess what? The President was right. They were bombs.
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  So there's been new developments on that front. We're there talking about al-Qaeda hitting us over Thanksgiving, hitting us over Christmas.
[03:36.000 --> 03:46.000]  Look, we don't like sticking our hands in your pants, in your underwear, but it's got to be done, or al-Qaeda's going to get you. But the border is wide open.
[03:46.000 --> 03:58.000]  Also, huge developments on the economic front, pessimistic fed to slash growth forecast. I thought the recession ended a year and a half ago, back in June of 2009.
[03:58.000 --> 04:13.000]  You notice that in Ireland, and in Spain, and in Greece, and in Portugal, the list goes on and on. The bigger the bailouts, totaling 60% of the Irish economy, in just one bailout for Ireland they're talking about,
[04:13.000 --> 04:22.000]  they admit that ahead of the next bailout, that oh, that won't fix it either. See, it's a mathematical black hole. It's impossible to pay off.
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.000]  This is the Bankster system where they hold us hostage. That's coming up.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  Head of the UN climate body admits surprise at fury over blunder and report.
[04:33.000 --> 04:49.000]  They're spinning the climate gate email debacle as errors. It's not errors. They're in there talking about how to lie and say the earth is warming.
[04:49.000 --> 05:00.000]  Alright, it's all coming up. Plus, Geraldo Rivera goes back on record again, questioning Building 7 collapse. He's got a lot of courage. It's all coming up. Stay with us.
[05:20.000 --> 05:28.000]  Number 3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[05:28.000 --> 05:35.000]  Number 4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[05:35.000 --> 05:44.000]  Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science.
[05:44.000 --> 05:52.000]  One of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[05:52.000 --> 06:00.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[06:00.000 --> 06:07.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[06:12.000 --> 06:20.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[06:20.000 --> 06:29.000]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[06:29.000 --> 06:39.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't.
[06:39.000 --> 06:46.000]  We turn jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans. Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[06:46.000 --> 06:52.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[06:52.000 --> 06:59.000]  Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it. Others don't.
[06:59.000 --> 07:10.000]  Hello, Alex Jones has told you about the delicious, safe, easy-to-fix and very storable food from eFoodsDirect.
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  Well, here's the great news. It's that time of year and their holiday special is here.
[07:15.000 --> 07:21.000]  Two holiday-priced packs for you to put into your reserve for a secure future or share with others.
[07:21.000 --> 07:31.000]  The first is a six-month bulk supply in number 10 cans and the second is a five-week supply of quick and easy meals, including delicious bakery items shipped in heavy-duty totes.
[07:31.000 --> 07:40.000]  Both are special values for the holidays. When you order two or more of these special holiday packs, you'll get free shipping on the entire order.
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.000]  These holiday packs are all special combinations of food that are not available at any other time of the year.
[07:45.000 --> 07:58.000]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex. That's 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[07:58.000 --> 08:22.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:29.000 --> 08:43.000]  The TSA is now beginning to completely collapse. Public opinion is solidly against them, despite the fact that they've been putting out fake polls of how they enjoy over 80% support.
[08:43.000 --> 08:55.000]  Those polls fly in the face of just common street buzz and many other scientific polls that show the complete opposite of what CBS News and others are reporting.
[08:55.000 --> 09:05.000]  Most polls show over 90%, including Reuters, 96% against the TSA and what they're doing, and folks saying they're not going to fly in record numbers.
[09:05.000 --> 09:17.000]  And tourism is completely imploding. Record numbers of people refusing to fly or travel. We've seen this trend since 2006 accelerating.
[09:17.000 --> 09:36.000]  That is all coming up as well today. We are live. It is Monday, the 22nd day of November, 2010. We're going to get Joel Scousen, political analyst, on to talk about a host of issues with us today in the third hour.
[09:36.000 --> 09:49.000]  He's also got some new breaking news. Terrorism, conspiracy in the UK involving the Bank of England, Lord James to the House of Lords, eye-laundered money for the IRA.
[09:49.000 --> 10:11.000]  And it's come out for a long time in England, even in the BBC and Guardian, that the British government ran the violent arm of the IRA for decades to demonize the peaceful arm of the IRA and as a pretext to keep troops in Northern Ireland.
[10:11.000 --> 10:29.000]  So this is the oldest trick in the book. You stage events as a pretext to use force against a wider group you wish to persecute. That is coming up. We'll also get his take on the economy, on stage terror, on what's happening politically in this nation and a lot more today.
[10:29.000 --> 10:45.000]  Also, we've got a lot of other amazing news here in the stack. In fact, let me just go ahead and start going through the headlines themselves. Then I'm going to fire the toll-free number out and have wide open phones throughout the full transmission.
[10:45.000 --> 10:57.000]  Pessimistic Fed to slash growth forecast. Federal Reserve says things aren't as good as they previously said. Nobody's buying their propaganda now, so to have some credibility, they're telling a little bit of the truth.
[10:57.000 --> 11:14.000]  Bloomberg reports Ireland is second Euro nation to seek aid as banks wobble. They want to bail out that's roughly 60% of their total economy and they go on to report here that that's not even expected to help, but they still are going to do it.
[11:14.000 --> 11:26.000]  The bigger the bailouts, the bigger the hole is. Again, it's a black hole, mathematically impossible to pay back. It's designed that way to transfer all wealth to the private central banks.
[11:26.000 --> 11:44.000]  The Irish-EU IMF rescue would dwarf Greek bailout on bank cost. Ireland will seek emergency international aid, totaling as much as 60% of the size of its economy, dwarfing the Greek bailout to save its banks and bolster its finances.
[11:44.000 --> 12:00.000]  It will last for 95 billion euros or 130 billion US dollars from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates Unicredit SA put the package as much as 85 billion euros while Deutsche Bank sees a 90 billion euro plan.
[12:00.000 --> 12:20.000]  The 110 billion euro aid for Greece in May was an equivalent of 47% of its gross domestic product. And they will have to massively increase taxes to give the money to the private central banks who will then loan them money back at interest.
[12:20.000 --> 12:31.000]  Oh yes, this is what it's all about. Being in the euro or in the North American Union is about being straightjacketed by the banks so they can then suck you dry.
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  We told you this is where the euro was leading. It was set up to do this. Many other founders admitted that.
[12:36.000 --> 13:02.000]  Analyst, Irish EU bailout may not stop Portugal follow-up. Of course it won't stop a Portugal follow-up, as Reuters is saying. It's designed to do that. The European Union bailout of Ireland may give short-term relief to markets, but despite Eurozone hopes may not prevent markets from pushing Portugal to get EU assistance unless a more general solution is found soon.
[13:02.000 --> 13:18.000]  Here's a report out of CNBC. In bailout, Spain will be the biggest. Oh yes, Spain's coming after Ireland and Portugal. And then it's going to be England. And then it's going to be France. And then it's going to be Germany and every other country.
[13:18.000 --> 13:34.000]  When you look at the European Union, it is a holding company of unelected bureaucrats over the nations, just like the World Trade Organization's group of unelected bureaucrats, that the governments have signed their authority over to.
[13:34.000 --> 13:50.000]  And it's a receivership arm. And after they're done bankrupting Europe, they'll bankrupt them again and again and again until you live like people in Nigeria or Argentina. Continuing, the biggest bailout the European Union will have to do if it comes to it will be Spain.
[13:50.000 --> 14:08.000]  And it's worrying that there is not a set mechanism of how to go about it. And of course, the bailouts work two ways. The Germans and others have to pay tax money in. The Brits have to pay tax money in to bail out Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Eastern European nations as well.
[14:08.000 --> 14:18.000]  Notice it started with them two years ago. The taxpayers have got to pay for that. Then they go into more debt to the bankers. Then they get loans from the bankers at the national level.
[14:18.000 --> 14:28.000]  And they have to pay taxes on that. And then the Irish and others, they've got to pay back to the same bankers. And it's all just made up zeros and ones out of a computer.
[14:28.000 --> 14:44.000]  This is the mega fraud. So of course, the big banks lobbied for big government and high debt rates and higher interest rates. And as Ireland loses its credit rating, the cost to service their debt just last week doubled.
[14:44.000 --> 15:04.000]  See how you never get out of it mathematically. So it goes into Spain in this report. Continuing, Geithner says Obama opposes depriving Fed of employment mandate. They're always spending it like you're not going to take away the power of the private Federal Reserve to save America.
[15:04.000 --> 15:20.000]  We're not going to take the mandate away to create jobs. Then you read the mandate. It's the mandate, the unelected bureaucratic power outside of government as Greenspan told their news hour last year that they are unregulatable.
[15:20.000 --> 15:36.000]  Remember Dick Cheney saying I'm not even part of the executive. I'm in my own branch. It's just made up. It's like Bush ordering people to torture and saying because he can. No, he can't. You're not above the law or TSA saying they can stick their hands down their your pants.
[15:36.000 --> 15:48.000]  No, they can't just because they say their God doesn't make it so. And they're also in the news saying let's not politicize the Federal Reserve. Come on, let's leave it outside of debate outside of criticism.
[15:48.000 --> 16:06.000]  You just forget it exists and let's not discuss its role. It's dominant role. It's it's complete role in governing our economy and our society and creating this crisis. They're also in the Associated Press saying that.
[16:06.000 --> 16:18.000]  Crisis of fiat currency US dollar surplus is converted into gold. Something's going on that our government does not want you to know about. Very few journalists have written about it and little or nothing has appeared in mainstream media.
[16:18.000 --> 16:26.000]  The story can be one of the major stories of our time. This is fresh out from Bob Chapman today, international forecaster up on info wars.com.
[16:26.000 --> 16:37.000]  Some of the big stars have tried to destroy gold as a backing for currencies for many years. Presently, the major media won't touch the story and that is understandable.
[16:37.000 --> 16:51.000]  Something we have been writing about for years is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization known as SCO. Few have been listening and few have been interested in what their mission is and what they've been up to.
[16:51.000 --> 17:02.000]  Others are large oil producers and some like China are large oil users. Some have very large dollar surpluses as well. Some are large commodity and gold and silver buyers.
[17:02.000 --> 17:16.000]  In fact, members are in a great part responsible for driving these prices higher. It is debatable, but we believe there is a conscious effort to accumulate gold and silver, dump dollars and back their currencies with gold.
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.000]  Then he goes through the evidence of that, a major move into gold. That's why it's been going up.
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  So you've got some of the globalist interest buying gold and silver while the big mega central banks try to drive it down.
[17:27.000 --> 17:40.000]  And there's more and more protesting against the private central banks going on. International soccer star reclaim your power by pulling your money out of your bank December 7th.
[17:40.000 --> 17:48.000]  And it says most Americans haven't heard of him, but Eric Cantona is a huge international soccer star known throughout Europe and much of the world.
[17:48.000 --> 18:00.000]  Cantona is calling for Europeans to pull their money out of the banks December 7th and he goes into the New World Order. He goes into how these banks are controlling everything, how they're engineering, control of our society, how they're the real enemy.
[18:00.000 --> 18:07.000]  The world is awake and staring at the true ruling class.
[18:07.000 --> 18:18.000]  Here's another key story from Cryptone.com. Could millionaires fleeing the U.S. cause a wild card economic event? Absolutely. We'll be breaking that down.
[18:18.000 --> 18:31.000]  So that's just some of what is in the economic stack here today on the front of 9-11 Truth. We'll play this video later.
[18:31.000 --> 18:38.000]  Haroldo expands his 9-1-1 comments, says WTC collapse reminiscent of control demolition.
[18:38.000 --> 18:46.000]  Judge Andrew Napolitano put him on the hot seat and said, so you're questioning 9-11 Truth.
[18:46.000 --> 18:55.000]  So you're saying the folks that talk about that aren't bad. And Haroldo says, no, it looks like they could be right and it looks like it could be a controlled demolition.
[18:55.000 --> 19:07.000]  It's, quote, reminiscent of one. So a week and a half ago, Haroldo on his own show said that he thinks 9-11 Truth has legitimate concerns and it looks like Building 7 could have been blown up.
[19:07.000 --> 19:15.000]  And then when he went on Judge Napolitano's show, he basically said the same thing. This is a big deal.
[19:15.000 --> 19:23.000]  So I've got a lot of problems with Haroldo Rivera over the years, but you've got to give people credit where credit is due.
[19:23.000 --> 19:33.000]  Now, people will spin that. Alex endorses Fox News. Alex endorses Haroldo Rivera, which is always a red herring, paper tiger, straw man.
[19:33.000 --> 19:41.000]  I'm just saying I'm giving credit where credit is due. Kind of like when Glenn Beck comes out and says the government may stage terror attacks a new Oklahoma city and blame it on the American people.
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  That's a big deal. I mean, you have to give credit where credit is due.
[19:45.000 --> 19:58.000]  I want to get into the huge. I mean, every day it just gets bigger as you've seen and noticed. Latest developments on TSA, they are beginning to capitulate, but they're going to come in with the stage terror.
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  But first, I want to take your phone calls.
[20:00.000 --> 20:06.000]  Still worrying? From GMO to organic food in jeopardy divided by economic turmoil, there is still an answer.
[20:06.000 --> 20:10.000]  With just a little knowledge easily acquired, you will literally see food everywhere.

[20:15.000 --> 20:20.000]  Wild food is economical, nutritious, freely available, abundant and free for the taking.
[20:20.000 --> 20:24.000]  It is a skill that takes little time to learn, but stays with you for life.
[20:24.000 --> 20:30.000]  And now, for a limited time, it's all on sale. It's called the Bye Bye Old Website Sale. Can you guess what's coming?
[20:30.000 --> 20:35.000]  Absolutely everything's on sale across the board, including our already discounted packages.

[20:40.000 --> 20:47.000]  This was the only one in 2010 so far. We've been lucky to keep our prices the same since 2008, but who knows what the future will bring.

[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.000]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[21:20.000 --> 21:26.000]  The United Nations would take over America. The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[21:26.000 --> 21:34.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.000]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[21:39.000 --> 21:42.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[21:42.000 --> 21:48.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[21:59.000 --> 22:02.000]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  Are we going to see economic growth? Slide into a recession or at worst depression.
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.000]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[22:13.000 --> 22:17.000]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasuries are a safe haven.
[22:17.000 --> 22:22.000]  But what do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[22:22.000 --> 22:27.000]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.
[22:31.000 --> 22:36.000]  Discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[24:19.000 --> 24:26.000]  You notice the bullies of the TSA have come out and said,
[24:26.000 --> 24:32.000]  we don't care what you say, what you do, just don't fly, drive a car.
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.000]  And so millions of Americans are saying, okay, we won't fly.
[24:36.000 --> 24:44.000]  And they're calling the different tourism outfits, they're calling the theme parks, the hotels, the airlines, and saying, I'm not flying.
[24:44.000 --> 24:54.000]  That's the biggest thing you can do because then industry will put pressure on the federal government that's trying to basically federalize and nationalize travel.
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  The feds do want to kill our economy. That's been stated.
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.000]  They want a post-industrial world, but they want to do it slowly. They don't want you to notice.
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.000]  Here's the TSA capitulating. First, they won't grab the genitals of pilots.
[25:08.000 --> 25:14.000]  Then they wouldn't be as rough with children under 12, but their new video came out this weekend,
[25:14.000 --> 25:23.000]  just shot in the last few days of a five-year-old having a shirt pulled off and then having a skin rubbed by the male TSA worker.
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  It was very bizarre and creepy running his hands through his hair. It's over.
[25:27.000 --> 25:35.000]  Now, as people focus in on what's going on, it's over. TSA Pat Down went too far, agency chief says.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  TSA administrator says search of passengers' underwear should have never happened.
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  All over the country, they stick their hands in your pants.
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  We covered it three weeks ago, people couldn't believe it, but now it's been in hundreds of publications.
[25:49.000 --> 25:56.000]  They're not at hundreds of airports accidentally sticking their hands down in your pants and patting your genitals by accident.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  They were ordered to do that. They're such liars at TSA.
[26:00.000 --> 26:07.000]  Here's another one. In shift, TSA chief says screenings to be minimally invasive. They'll just bring them right back.
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.000]  We got to get rid of the TSA altogether, ladies and gentlemen.
[26:11.000 --> 26:18.000]  By the way, I saw it in the news today that Hezbollah is reportedly down on the border now.
[26:18.000 --> 26:27.000]  The organization out of Palestine, quote, advising the cartels.
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.000]  And I have no doubt of that going on. We're going over that report.
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.000]  But here you have a wide open southern border. You've got Hezbollah down there.
[26:37.000 --> 26:48.000]  But then we've got to pull the colostomy bag or the urine bag. I forget the scientific name.
[26:48.000 --> 26:55.000]  The urnology, instead of colostomy, it's urnology bag. Please don't pull that off. That's connected.
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.000]  No, yes, no, no. And then they just, yeah. And then it starts, the urine starts pouring out.
[27:00.000 --> 27:03.000]  I mean, I'm sorry to get graphic here, but it's mainstream news.
[27:03.000 --> 27:09.000]  You don't even have a nurse touching you or a doctor. It's a TSA person. What's this?
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.000]  It's my colostomy bag. What that? Literally. What that?
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  The guy starts jerking on the guy's colostomy bag. He punches him.
[27:18.000 --> 27:25.000]  I mean, what do you expect to do? What are these $10 an hour goons?
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  Oh, the federal government is so sick.
[27:28.000 --> 27:35.000]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls and I'm already getting into TSA. The good news is they're beginning to cave in.
[27:35.000 --> 27:44.000]  The bad news is they're going to strike back. And I'm not the only one that's been saying this the last three and a half weeks since we kicked the story off.
[27:44.000 --> 27:51.000]  Glenn Beck has now come out and the video is up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[27:51.000 --> 27:59.000]  He has now come out and he is saying he was actually on the Palatino show. That's a hot show on Vox Business Network.
[27:59.000 --> 28:11.000]  And he is saying that the TSA is going to use whatever event happens as a pretext to crack down on our liberties and freedoms.
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  In fact, here's the exact quote.
[28:13.000 --> 28:23.000]  Beck, Obama will blame terror attack on TSA resistance. And so that is the rest of the story. But I want to go even further after we take a round or two of calls
[28:23.000 --> 28:35.000]  and get into the evidence of the government or elements of it staging the toner attacks and staging the German event last week that's been confirmed.
[28:35.000 --> 28:45.000]  But I've talked to people on the street. They heard about the German bomb, but none of the people I've talked to on the street know that it was retracted and that it was a U.S. government drill.
[28:45.000 --> 28:52.000]  So see, they put it out for two days, bomb on German plane, then they retract it in the back of the paper. This is the tactic that's going on.
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  This is what's happening on this front.
[28:55.000 --> 29:05.000]  So we're going to be discussing that coming up, how the Empire is basically going to strike back on this front.
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.000]  But we'll go to Justin, Matt, Joe, Dennis, Casey on the other side.
[29:10.000 --> 29:19.000]  Then I'm going to get back into what's happening with the economy and more on the TSA and how the system is going to respond to this.
[29:19.000 --> 29:32.000]  Because this is a lot bigger than just churned off, making some money off naked body scanners. It's a lot bigger than just make work for out of work people who can't get jobs at the post office because it's getting ready to go out of the business and falling apart.
[29:32.000 --> 29:40.000]  This is a lot more than that. This is about the federal government power grabbing and taking over all transportation nationwide.
[29:40.000 --> 29:50.000]  So we'll look at all of this coming up, but this is a big place for the American people to show their power and for the American people to learn how much power they've really got.
[29:50.000 --> 30:00.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.000 --> 30:10.000]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com. This is the place to get you started buying or selling a home, finding a realtor and getting any real estate questions answered.

[31:32.000 --> 31:36.000]  Let's talk to the owner of 5star soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[31:36.000 --> 31:46.000]  Founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business? I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[31:46.000 --> 32:09.000]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a one to two month soap sampler. Thank you.
[32:17.000 --> 32:24.000]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[32:24.000 --> 32:28.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:28.000 --> 32:35.000]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[32:35.000 --> 32:46.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[33:09.000 --> 33:20.000]  From Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:20.000 --> 33:28.000]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, we're here live back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m. on your phone calls here in just a moment.
[33:28.000 --> 33:34.000]  But just briefly getting back to the TSA, and I know I keep repeating this, but I want to be clear.
[33:34.000 --> 33:47.000]  For now, almost a month, we've been pointing out that if people start protesting this and saying no, that the TSA will try to fearmonger and further intimidate you,
[33:47.000 --> 33:59.000]  but then they will fold like a house of cards, and it will be yet another example of how the corporate globalist Borg are not invincible, are not unstoppable.
[33:59.000 --> 34:10.000]  And it's now being called, last week by mainstream news, AP, Reuters, you name it, a grassroots revolt that isn't just about the TSA,
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.000]  it's about people being tired of the government being involved in our lives.
[34:15.000 --> 34:24.000]  And now you've got people protesting the banks, and it transcends left-right, it transcends black-white,
[34:24.000 --> 34:30.000]  it's humans that are sick of being treated like slaves, and that's what scares the system.
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.000]  That's why the right-wing media has been trying to make this all about Obama and Napolitano,
[34:35.000 --> 34:43.000]  and whereas they're unsavory, jackbooted thugs, they are still just front people for the same agenda that's been growing for decades.
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  And that's why the left has been trying to make it about the right-wing.
[34:46.000 --> 34:56.000]  This is about the out-of-control military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about, and that JFK, a Democrat, warned us about.
[34:56.000 --> 35:05.000]  And once we get past fighting with each other over labels and start talking about common sense, we've got a chance to fix this country.
[35:05.000 --> 35:12.000]  Right now, let's go to your phone calls. Let's talk to Justin in Kansas. Justin, you're on the ear.
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.000]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing? Good, sir. Good to talk to you. What's on your mind?
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.000]  Well, one thing, mainly, my girlfriend works up with the Irwin Army Hospital up at Fort Riley,
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  and she brought me home a document the other day that kind of creeped me out.
[35:26.000 --> 35:36.000]  It's from Admiral Mullen. It's a self-help guide to anti-terrorism, and this is up on their website at the Irwin Army Hospital.
[35:36.000 --> 35:42.000]  And basically, it's a, well, it's a guide to anti-terrorism for the average citizen or soldier.
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.000]  It says, this is designed to assist in making your family less vulnerable to terrorists.
[35:47.000 --> 35:52.000]  It goes on to say you and your family are a vital yet vulnerable military resource.
[35:52.000 --> 35:59.000]  It just goes on and on about how you go to defend yourself against these invisible terrorists that we have everywhere.
[35:59.000 --> 36:06.000]  Oh, yeah, it's all about this mental illness that they're just, and I've seen these federal and state training manuals.
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.000]  It's, does your neighbor wear blue jeans? I'm not joking. In Texas, the federal manual said that.
[36:10.000 --> 36:16.000]  Is it a woman with a baby carriage? Do they have a cell phone? Do they have a camera? Are they taking pictures?
[36:16.000 --> 36:23.000]  Do they criticize the government? Do they have gas tanks in their garage? Do they lock their desk?
[36:23.000 --> 36:33.000]  These, basically, they're profiling everyone, but the real terrorist who's been caught doing chemical, biological studies on us secretly,
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.000]  who has been caught committing all these crimes, it's the government.
[36:38.000 --> 36:44.000]  But they never have us look at who openly is the most murderous group in history, i.e. governments.
[36:44.000 --> 36:50.000]  Now, slowly, give me the name of the report and the website, because I want to pull this up.
[36:50.000 --> 36:57.000]  The name of the report is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Guide, 5260, a self-help guide to anti-terrorism.
[36:57.000 --> 37:05.000]  I'd say it slowly. Chairman of the Joint, oh, there it is. It's the CJCS Guide.
[37:05.000 --> 37:14.000]  Yeah, it's the CJCS Guide, 5260, Anti-Terrorism, Personal Protection Guide, a self-help guide to anti-terrorism.
[37:14.000 --> 37:20.000]  Let's scroll down. Tell me exactly what it goes through. Give us some of the highlights.
[37:20.000 --> 37:25.000]  Sure, sure. Well, like in the table of contents here, I mean, it's telling you how to respond to chemical threats,
[37:25.000 --> 37:34.000]  respond to biological threats, how to isolate personal guidance, how to protect your house,
[37:34.000 --> 37:40.000]  personal identification, do not discuss your military affiliation, job tiles, responsibility with strangers.
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  If you're taking hostage, it tells you what to do to survive, preparing your family, staying in control, dealing with your captors.
[37:46.000 --> 37:54.000]  And it just things like that. It just goes on and on and on about invisible threats that people think that are out there
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  and that have been brainwashed and believing. It's insane.
[37:57.000 --> 38:02.000]  Of course, the real threat in Kansas is tornadoes and a tree fallen on your house.
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  Why aren't they giving you reports on how to protect yourself from a tornado?
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  Absolutely. At the very end of the document is a personal data section.
[38:10.000 --> 38:17.000]  It wants you to fill out a military member or DOD employee or civilian, your full name, your passport, social security number,
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.000]  your rank, your address, place of birth. At the very end, all the medical problems you may have.
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  At the very end, it says, attach two photographs, one full-length front view, one full-length side view.
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.000]  Attach one complete fingerprint card. It's also prudent to have an audio recording or a DNA and a DNA sample.
[38:31.000 --> 38:36.000]  So basically, it's a biometric deal here. They're trying to get information on all of us.
[38:36.000 --> 38:42.000]  Well, they've admitted that's going to be the new global money is going to be your thumbprint or retina scan.
[38:42.000 --> 38:49.000]  After the private fellow reserve system globally, the Federal Reserve is just one tentacle or one head of the Hydra,
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.000]  after the private banking system sets up their world government opening, which they're now doing,
[38:53.000 --> 38:59.000]  they have to first then bankrupt all the other currencies, then they're going to force everyone onto this cashless system
[38:59.000 --> 39:05.000]  and everything you do is going to be tracked and traced. They're already putting in huge fines for garage sales
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  or selling cupcakes or anything. I mean, just everything must be surveilled.
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.000]  They're turning the world into one giant prison.
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  Justin, I appreciate your call and the points you've made here today.
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.000]  Let's talk to Matt in Minnesota. Matt, you're on the year.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  Hey, Alex. Hey, buddy.
[39:22.000 --> 39:29.000]  Hey, in regards to TSA really quick, maybe you're an awesome InfoWars team contract on this video, but last night,
[39:29.000 --> 39:35.000]  Whoopi Goldberg was on Huckabee talking about her book and Huckabee is kind of talking about TSA and he's like,
[39:35.000 --> 39:41.000]  hey, listen, I'm concerned about this new TSA stuff. This is like a police state and Whoopi Goldberg goes,
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  well, yeah, this is a police state and you should love it.
[39:45.000 --> 39:51.000]  It's just sort of a funny video that I think would be interesting if you guys found and put it up on InfoWars.
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.000]  Well, I did actually see that this morning. The Drudge Report,
[39:56.000 --> 40:04.000]  we ought to do a blurb about all of these ditzy people like,
[40:04.000 --> 40:09.000]  oh, who's the big music star who shaved her head and went crazy?
[40:09.000 --> 40:15.000]  Britney Spears. Remember Britney Spears saying, I think we should just do whatever the president says and just shut up and not think?
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  Well, that's like Gloria Allred saying, quote, I like being felt up.
[40:20.000 --> 40:27.000]  So she's saying, women, you should like strangers you don't know grabbing your breast.
[40:27.000 --> 40:34.000]  And they've actually got the video up on Drudge Report that says, I like being felt up.
[40:34.000 --> 40:41.000]  And TSA boss regrets ABC News staffer getting their underwear searched.
[40:41.000 --> 40:46.000]  So see, just a few weeks ago, they tried to deny the fact that they stick their hands in your underwear.
[40:46.000 --> 40:54.000]  Now that's mainstream news. But we have Gloria Allred, the famous lawyer who's always about women's rights and women not being touched.
[40:54.000 --> 41:03.000]  But then there's the larger issue. It's now confirmed that they're taking people's children away from them into private areas,
[41:03.000 --> 41:09.000]  even three, four, five-year-olds and strip searching them and touching them.
[41:09.000 --> 41:17.000]  So how do you teach your children? Don't let strangers touch you or don't go alone with somebody you don't know.
[41:17.000 --> 41:23.000]  And now these minimum wage weirdos that went and got the jobs to touch people's genitals,
[41:23.000 --> 41:28.000]  they are now taking your child away from you crying and touching their genitals.
[41:28.000 --> 41:34.000]  Just this morning, I was in there on YouTube watching news clips of this and my children walked in and my wife came in and said,
[41:34.000 --> 41:40.000]  you can't watch that. And we had to explain to them the government's bad.
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.000]  They're wanting to put their hands down your pants just because they heard the news, you know, playing on YouTube.
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.000]  And I shouldn't have to have that discussion with my children that, yes, we've told you, don't let strangers touch you.
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.000]  Don't let anybody stick their hand down your pants. Don't go anywhere with somebody alone.
[41:55.000 --> 42:00.000]  And now just all over the radio, all over the news, it's about the government doing this to them.
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.000]  This is so sick and out of control, but government knows that they can get away with this.
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  They can get away with anything.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  Go ahead, caller, finish up your point.
[42:11.000 --> 42:17.000]  Oh, yeah, I was going to say, I mean, I locally here in Minnesota, I try to call on the radio shows as much as possible.
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.000]  And I think a lot of the people are waking up to this, this TSA tyranny and they're standing up against it.
[42:21.000 --> 42:26.000]  You know, I real quick had a comment regarding the Geraldo 9-11 stuff.
[42:26.000 --> 42:33.000]  That's pretty exciting. And I know you've been on for all the show before. Do you think he would ever come on your show?
[42:33.000 --> 42:39.000]  And do you think there will ever be a Alex Jones going back discussion either on his show or your show?
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  I just feel like it's going to happen someday. And do you ever think that that would happen?
[42:43.000 --> 42:49.000]  Well, I would obviously go on their shows if they invited me. I've been on Geraldo's a few times and we sat around the office talking about,
[42:49.000 --> 42:59.000]  is he a closet 9-11 truther? But I don't think Beck will probably have me on because he's taken so much of my research and the work we do.
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.000]  He knows that that parallel and that connection has been made.
[43:04.000 --> 43:12.000]  And so I don't think Beck, you know, wants to further up my visibility, but it doesn't matter what Glenn Beck does.
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.000]  Glenn Beck, and I'm not saying it's an audience I don't want. I want everybody.
[43:16.000 --> 43:22.000]  I mean, I just get up here and cover the news. I don't sit here and do market analysis of, you know, who we're targeting or who listens.
[43:22.000 --> 43:30.000]  It just so happens we have a very diverse audience, but we have one of the youngest audiences in talk radio from stations that do get the ratings and look at them.
[43:30.000 --> 43:40.000]  And from the demographics we see online, we have, you know, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, you know, right through 100 years old.
[43:40.000 --> 43:49.000]  But we're really strong in the young people and the 18 to 35, the most coveted demographic and a Glenn Beck isn't.
[43:49.000 --> 43:54.000]  You know, Glenn Beck does a lot of his big speeches at retirement homes and that's fine.
[43:54.000 --> 44:00.000]  It's just that Glenn Beck is the past. This radio show is the future.
[44:00.000 --> 44:08.000]  But Glenn Beck has been forced to cover more and more hardcore issues to stay relevant because in the past, you know, 15 years ago,
[44:08.000 --> 44:21.000]  the separation between the real world material, the full spectrum breakdown that I'm covering and the shuttered condensed spectrum that a leftist or a right winger covers.
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.000]  Those were universes apart. It was a huge gulf.
[44:24.000 --> 44:33.000]  Now the membrane between mainstream media and alternative media is just very, very thin at see through.
[44:33.000 --> 44:41.000]  And so there's an acceleration of mainstream news and media covering the information we cover here. I appreciate your call.
[44:41.000 --> 44:47.000]  But on that subject, I didn't know that my cousin Buckley was going to be in town.
[44:47.000 --> 44:52.000]  Buckley Hammond, who was the first guy to ever run my access TV show for about a year and a half.
[44:52.000 --> 44:57.000]  I did it on my own and Buckley did it for about two years and my cancer took over for a few years after that.
[44:57.000 --> 45:07.000]  And did a great job. But Buckley, you know, going to college here in Austin when I was first starting access TV, he's a really smart guy and he ran the show for several years.
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.000]  He had David Eich books when I never heard of David Eich.
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  You know, when I first got on there, I hadn't heard of David Eich.
[45:12.000 --> 45:15.000]  He was the first guy to give me a David Eich book and I was like, man, this is crazy.
[45:15.000 --> 45:21.000]  But, you know, back then that was my view. It's changed some because, you know, so much crazy stuff comes out.
[45:21.000 --> 45:32.000]  But, you know, the point is he was into this stuff at the same time I was or even more into reality, into questioning the limited spectrum of information that the mainstream corporate media gives us.
[45:32.000 --> 45:39.000]  But this morning we were having breakfast and he just boiled it down so well.
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.000]  And I was kind of paraphrasing him a moment ago.
[45:42.000 --> 45:51.000]  He said, take like a Naomi Klein who writes for Rolling Stone or a Matt Taibbi.
[45:51.000 --> 46:03.000]  People like that just five or six years ago attacked the conspiracy culture, attacked people that talked about the private fellow reserve, went after people that criticize the system.
[46:03.000 --> 46:17.000]  But now today they sound more and more like you, but from a little bitty, narrow window they're looking through with their kind of leftist, progressive template, they see it all through that.
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  And we all look through rose-colored darklies.
[46:19.000 --> 46:31.000]  But he described my view from the beginning from not coming from some ideological angle or some left-right system, though I'm influenced by all the thought that's out there, but more like a dragonfly.
[46:31.000 --> 46:42.000]  With hundreds of eyes, with the composite eyes, just seeing things from all these different angles and then the problem is trying to articulate that.
[46:42.000 --> 46:52.000]  But if anyone wanted to describe that membrane between alternative media, anybody that looks at things from a different perspective than left-right,
[46:52.000 --> 47:07.000]  and the establishment media, the left-right reservation, that that wall is being decimated right now, that that wall is being removed right now.
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.000]  And so that's what's happening.
[47:09.000 --> 47:26.000]  And so the system denied all of this existed so long that now that it's all coming out in the open, we've planted all these seeds, and now the tyranny is almost like rain and sunshine on the seeds.
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  It's making them sprout up from everywhere.
[47:29.000 --> 47:39.000]  I mean, just with the work I've done, not counting all the other great patriots out there, I've done five, six thousand radio interviews the last ten years, conservatively.
[47:39.000 --> 47:43.000]  I have done thousands of my own radio show.
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  I have made 20-plus films.
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.000]  We've been seeing hundreds of millions of times in just the last few years on YouTube.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  I mean, it's an exponential.
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.000]  And if you watched something I did ten years ago, it's pertinent and seems like I said it today.
[47:57.000 --> 48:02.000]  People say, wow, I mean, here's a quick example and I'm going back to your calls.
[48:02.000 --> 48:12.000]  A year before 9-11, six months before 9-11, three months before 9-11, two months before 9-11, I was saying they're prepping the public for stage terror attacks.
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.000]  They're going to bring in the military on the streets and more control.
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  It's going to be done incrementally because I could see all the preparations.
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  I was going to the urban warfare drills.
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.000]  I was reading the Rand Corporation documents and CFR documents that were public.
[48:25.000 --> 48:40.000]  Then by mid-July of 2001, I was able to go on air and say specifically they're going to blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  I knew he was former CIA on record.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  That's a fact, folks.
[48:44.000 --> 48:45.000]  We didn't know that.
[48:45.000 --> 48:46.000]  That's on record.
[48:46.000 --> 48:47.000]  I mean, that's admitted.
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.000]  Go check it out for yourself.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  Tim Osmond was his code name.
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.000]  I could see they were prepping the public for it.
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  I knew they were massing troops in and around Afghanistan.
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  I could see them getting the public ready for it.
[48:59.000 --> 49:06.000]  It was all going on out of the open.
[49:06.000 --> 49:12.000]  And I went on air for two hours.
[49:12.000 --> 49:17.000]  I had a two-hour TV show at the time once a week on top of the radio show locally.
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.000]  And I went over this.
[49:18.000 --> 49:26.000]  Well, it just so happened that I would then do the show live, tape it, and then turn it back into access TV to air one more time as a tape show.
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.000]  At least one more time that they are charged to air it.
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.000]  It aired at about four o'clock in the afternoon on 9-11, two months later.
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  Hundreds of phone calls.
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.000]  Most of them saying, wow, how do you already know this?
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  That's an inside job.
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  But some saying, how dare you say it's an inside job?
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.000]  It was a two-month-old show.
[49:48.000 --> 49:52.000]  I did the show before that happened.
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.000]  And my good buddy, Jimmy Vaughn, that's what finally really woke him up.
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.000]  He was already researching this information, the blues legend.
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.000]  But he watched the show live when it happened.
[50:03.000 --> 50:09.000]  And then he remembered people talking about the re-airing of it later.
[50:09.000 --> 50:19.000]  But that's the issue is the power that we have to accurately predict what's going to happen because we know how the globalists operate.
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  That is massive.
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  We're going to come back and try to hurry through calls.
[50:23.000 --> 50:30.000]  Joe, Dennis, Casey, Darren, Marcy, and others.
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.000]  And you know what?
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  I haven't gotten into the full TSA news, the new UN carbon tax info.
[50:35.000 --> 50:40.000]  I haven't gotten into the economic news, but it's all coming up at first.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  I'm going to attempt to race through your phone calls.
[50:42.000 --> 50:48.000]  By the way, don't forget you can watch this radio show and live streaming video at prisonplanet.tv.

[52:04.000 --> 52:09.000]  Charity is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[52:09.000 --> 52:12.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[52:12.000 --> 52:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[52:17.000 --> 52:22.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cares.
[52:22.000 --> 52:27.000]  Now being expanded nationwide, this documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[52:34.000 --> 52:39.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[52:39.000 --> 52:45.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[52:45.000 --> 52:48.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.
[52:52.000 --> 53:21.000]  This is Alex Jones with 5 Good Reasons You Should Consider Buying a Solar Power Generator.
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[53:28.000 --> 53:31.000]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[53:31.000 --> 53:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[53:35.000 --> 53:40.000]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[53:40.000 --> 53:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[53:45.000 --> 53:51.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[53:51.000 --> 54:18.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[54:18.000 --> 54:22.000]  Well, Drudge Report just updated.
[54:22.000 --> 54:32.000]  I gave Nemo the assignment because the TSA has announced they want checkpoints on the trains and subways next.
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  They've already been beta-testing it.
[54:34.000 --> 54:40.000]  And Curt Nemo today did an article on it, and it's red-linked on Drudge Report.
[54:40.000 --> 54:45.000]  TSA searches our trains and subways next.
[54:45.000 --> 54:52.000]  And it goes on to go over the facts.
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.000]  So good job, Nemo, on that story.
[54:56.000 --> 55:02.000]  The next story we need, well, we're going to get that report done.
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  There's another key angle that needs to be covered.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  Okay, let's go back to your phone calls here.
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.000]  And again, I could care less about being linked on the biggest website in the world.
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  If my story was about OJ Simpson or something.
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  I care because this is a real issue.
[55:18.000 --> 55:23.000]  If they get away with putting their hands down our pants, they can get away with anything.
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  It's very, very simple.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  And I'm glad that people are hopping mad about this.
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  Let's talk to Joe in Pennsylvania.
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  Joe, you're on the air.
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.000]  How you doing, Alex?
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  Good.
[55:33.000 --> 55:41.000]  I got a TSA story and a suggestion if it's okay if I have enough time.
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.000]  I went on vacation back in September and I didn't really think too much about the whole
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  humiliation thing, the way they pat you down.
[55:48.000 --> 55:55.000]  I wasn't thinking about it, but I'm in a wheelchair and the guy's feeling me up.
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.000]  He's got my arm stretched out and he's doing the whole breast feeling, everything like that.
[55:59.000 --> 56:03.000]  And when he, you know, he got all done and stuff and I'm like, is that it?
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  And he's like, he looked at me like, yeah.
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.000]  And I said, well, aren't you going to check underneath my seat there?
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.000]  I have some plastic down there.
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  I was being sarcastic with them.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  Some plastic down there.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  Aren't you going to look underneath my foot pedals?
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  And he kind of looked at me like with his dumbfounded look.
[56:20.000 --> 56:21.000]  Like, uh...
[56:21.000 --> 56:22.000]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  They don't check where bombs could really be.
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.000]  Look, the number one threat has always been in the cargo.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  Almost none of that gets checked.
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  Look, it's all about training us.
[56:32.000 --> 56:37.000]  Now, again, the average TSA worker doesn't know that because they don't know how to tie their shoe laces on average.
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.000]  I mean, who else could they get to do this humiliating job all day?
[56:41.000 --> 56:45.000]  And he looked at you like he's usually the big bubble type, you know what I mean?
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  Yeah, I know.
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.000]  I know what you mean.
[56:47.000 --> 56:55.000]  But my other suggestion, I was listening to Max Kaiser last week with you guys and, you know, everybody buy a silver dollar.
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  And I was trying to think of a way it could be coordinated.
[56:58.000 --> 57:06.000]  I don't know anything about setting up websites or anything, but you have a vast array of different radio show hosts and people that you know.
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  And we all subscribe.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  You know, we subscribe to your websites and stuff.
[57:09.000 --> 57:25.000]  What would you think about putting up a petition where your listeners that pay and subscribe made a commitment like on a certain day, like on the 11th of December to buy that silver dollar.
[57:25.000 --> 57:32.000]  And you just threw through all of your radio shows that their listeners would all commit to do that.
[57:32.000 --> 57:37.000]  Joe and Joe, I hear you and I appreciate your call. This show is powerful, but it's not that powerful.
[57:37.000 --> 57:44.000]  Our power is to get a pebble rolling downhill that causes a rock slide.
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  We are able to trigger chain reactions.
[57:47.000 --> 57:51.000]  Even mainline corporate media has trouble setting the agenda now.
[57:51.000 --> 57:56.000]  We've gotten to the point where even the big mega dinosaur media can't set a lot of the agendas.
[57:56.000 --> 58:04.000]  It's the alternative media and all those voices in a fight with the corporate media now for the heart and soul of society.
[58:04.000 --> 58:21.000]  It's the idea of everybody buying silver and knowing that by buying silver in an uncoordinated way that that will force the hand of the big banks that are short silver and that have been manipulating the market.
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  That will reveal their naked shorting.
[58:23.000 --> 58:30.000]  So that's the real power. That's the real issue on that front.
[58:30.000 --> 58:37.000]  Plus talk show hosts, most talk show hosts in the patriot movement are so jealous of yours truly that they can't be worked with.
[58:37.000 --> 58:40.000]  They'd rather be in their obscurity with 100 listeners at least.
[58:40.000 --> 58:48.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:51.000 --> 58:59.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[58:59.000 --> 59:04.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[59:04.000 --> 59:10.000]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[59:10.000 --> 59:15.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[59:15.000 --> 59:25.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[59:25.000 --> 59:32.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[59:32.000 --> 59:39.000]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  We are now into hour number two.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  Joel Scalson, always extremely important of World Affairs Brief, will be joining us on a host of issues and breaking information dealing with government-sponsored terror that ties into what we see happening with the TSA and more.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  But right now, let's keep hammering through those calls.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  Casey and Indiana, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  Hey, Alex. How's it going?
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  Good.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  I've got some information and a question about FEMA camps. I live in central Indiana near Grissom Air Force Base, which has been shut down for a long time.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  It is on the list of FEMA detention centers.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  But tomorrow, President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will be visiting Kokomo, Indiana, a few miles from Grissom, to unveil a new solar panel facility and discuss a town saved by the stimulus since Chrysler and GM have factories there.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  But I have friends that work for a construction company that have recently been working on a project at Grissom.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  They're building some new buildings and stuff.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  And they were told no work tomorrow because Obama will be at the Air Force Base.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  And I didn't know if you had any information if there's a correlation with the President's appearances and the FEMA locations like if he's inspecting them.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  Well, that would be speculation, but the Emergency Centers Act is so key to read the entire bill because it's a blueprint for what they've already built and designed.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  It's just an attempt to get it more funding.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  Six mega regional FEMA command centers, threat fusion centers that also have different forms of stockades, prisons, and then mass holding areas for the general public.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  So it's dual use. It's areas for disasters. It's areas to hold people during civil insurrection. It's all in the bill.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  And it's everything that we had reverse engineered from studying the camps, from studying Rex 84 and the fragments of declassified evidence we had previously.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  It was a total vindication to tell us you were absolutely right, that is, researchers, on what they put together.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  But basically a lot of the stimulus money is going into the old bases.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  They proposed in the 80s under the COG, Continued Government, to make the old bases government emergency centers and to quote bring in local law enforcement and merge them in under federal control.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  Now Bush senior began that. Clinton accelerated it. And so the rumors came out by the workers and others that were inside under Bush.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  It went public in Houston Chronicle, Wall Street Journal reported on them being camps for citizens.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  They also use them as a cover story for foreigners.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  You've got corrections Corporation of America on record last year and this year lobbying to build more camps quote for the illegals, but they're really for citizens.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  So it's very, very serious. And so we know that they're accelerating this program Casey.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  Okay. Yeah, I just didn't know if you had any information about it because it wasn't disclosed to the public that he's going to be at the Air Force Base.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  He's only supposed to be talking at this solar panel facility.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  And the only reason I have the information about him being at the base is that my friends work for the construction company that are laying the gas lines and everything at these new buildings on the detention center.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  Yeah, well, that's how they do it is a lot of times they don't announce exactly where the president's going to be.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  So in case there is some lone nut or something and believe it, there are those out there as well that they don't know how to find them or know where he's going to be at.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  But again, that's also part of all this elaborate protection they give POTUS puppet in chief to create the illusion that he's actually running things so they can scapegoat presidents down the road.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  That's why they built a mile long bulletproof tunnel in India.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  That's why they pulled all the coconuts down in Mumbai.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  So one wouldn't hit him in the head.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  All this ridiculous pageantry and hype so that we never look at the Federal Reserve and the real ruling class.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  I appreciate your call. Great points, Casey.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  Uh, Julio, Darren, Marcy, James, your call is coming up 800-259-9231.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  I'm going to try to hurry through them.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  We've been doing a little bit better job and I'm going to try to go even faster on the other side.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  Love different angles.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  The callers take us in.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  infowars.com, BrazilBloona.tv, stay with us.

[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at prismplanet.tv.

[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  All right, we're going back to your phone calls then into the economy.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  The big developments on the TSA full-scale revolt against tyranny as they begin to cave in.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  Major cracks in the facade have now turned into giant gaping holes in their fraud.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  They do and have been putting TSA on the streets.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  I want to get into their master plan on that front and I want to continue with your phone calls.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  I first, though, wanted to remind listeners that just because you're awake,
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  just because you know more about the New World Order than I do on many fronts,
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  I'm always amazed by the emails and comments and letters I'm sent and the astute understanding that people have.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  We're all working together becoming more knowledgeable.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  The general public is awake now to a certain extent.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  That's a big part of the equation, but they don't know exactly what's going on.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  Now is the time to reach out to the public.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  Now is the time to give them high-quality, well-produced documentary films.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  And when you give them a film with a professionally done cover, shrink-wrapped, that's got a brief description on the back,
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  they are more apt to watch it, and that is someone's mind that you are literally unlocking.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  Now we have a special going right now at infowars.com.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  It's only going through Christmas. It's the Essential Alex Jones.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  It is my five newest and most powerful films for $24.95 apiece.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  $24.95 apiece, that is less than $5 apiece, the Obama deception, in-game, terror storm, fall of the republic,
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  police state for the rise of FEMA, and even if you already have one or more of these films,
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  get them. Give them to your friends and family.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  I don't care if they're a Muslim or a Jew and don't practice Christmas.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  Say Happy Hanukkah or whatever. Just give them the material if they're an atheist.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  So what? They love Christmas.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  The point is that we need to wake people up here.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  And we've got a bunch of other specials.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  You can get one copy of any title and get three more titles free.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  That's with all of our top films.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  We're not discounting our old films.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  We're discounting our newest, most powerful films at infowars.com.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  And until Christmas, we're also running a special we do every year in the middle of November into December,

[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  You get 5.3 months free.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  That's what the special comes out to.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  You pay for 6.7 months.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  You get 5.3 months free with a yearly membership at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  Or you can get a trial membership for a month, 5.95.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  My book, Paul Watson's book, expanded extras.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  We've had a new Jesse Ventura video interview.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  A new Willie Nelson.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  All of the Catherine Austin fits.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  I mean, look at the new interviews every day or two.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  Going up, in fact, we had these ready last week.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  They're going up the next few days.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  They're on the server now.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  We've got Dr. Russell Blalock.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  We've got a whole bunch of other never before seen interviews.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  Sit down, video, professional interviews.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  You can burn them right there, burn them to disc.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  Give them to everyone you know.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  Any subject you want to cover, any subject you want to burn a copy of a subject,
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  higher quality audio, commercial free podcast of the show.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  And it funds our operation, prisonplanet.tv, prisonplanet.tv,
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  or infoawards.com by the books, t-shirts, materials.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  All orders get a free citizen rule book.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  And your purchase makes this transmission possible.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  You can also call toll-free, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  Or you can also write to us at PO Box 1-9-549, Austin, Texas, 787-60.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  And I want to thank all of you for your support over the years.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  We couldn't have done it without you.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  And this information wouldn't be all over the place and literally on fire if it wasn't for you.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  We are the spearhead.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  We together are the tip of the spear.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  Let's go to Julio in Illinois. Julio, thanks for holding.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  Alex Jones, happy early Thanksgiving to you and all the freedom lovers worldwide.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  Around last year during Christmas, listening to you talking about the Christmas Day CIA bombing,
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  fake bombing that took place.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  I knew then and there that 2010 was going to be a pivotal year in the Info War.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  And it turned out to be exactly that.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  Well, for everyone who is awake with the so-called TSA thing, show your friends who have been molested by these pigs at TSA.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  Show them police state 4 rise of FEMA.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  I mean, that film pretty much lays the groundwork for what's currently going on and what's going to happen next.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  It covers the full history, the current operations and the future spectrum.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  If somebody sees Police State 4, they will have a master's degree in the police state.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  I mean, cops should see this.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  And when cops do see it, they freak out because they know it's all accurate.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  They had never just put all the pieces together.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  Secondly, in terms of J. Rockefeller, the scum in West Virginia, talking about, you know, the little bug inside of him.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  Maybe it's his RFID chip or maybe it's the devil.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  I don't know. Talking about trying to get rid of Fox and MSNBC.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  People need to look up electronic media law by Roger Sadler to understand the rules of what the FTC actually can and can't do.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  The FTC has no regulation over cable satellite systems. They have no regulation over satellite systems.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  No, they're just announcing that they have the regulation over it.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  Just like TSA is announcing they can stick your hand down your pants.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  They can't. This is brazen tyranny.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  Just wading into the middle of things and openly calling for censoring the web.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  They're doing this because they are in deep trouble.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  They think we're all ignorant.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  And one last thing, someone called earlier about FEMA camps, if people can look up the Cancun Climate Conference coming up in Cancun, Mexico on the 29th.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  It talks about in that website, in one of their documents, Mexico is getting set to relocate their citizens in high concentrated greenhouse pollutant areas to a special camp.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  And people, it's in their website. People just Google.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, that's why I love taking calls because I saw that two weeks ago.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  I looked at it.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  I saw it two weeks ago on their website and my mouth dropped. I showed my roommate this.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  I'm like, this is how they're going to get it.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  No, no, no, I got to stop you. I got to stop you right now, Julio.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  This is my biggest frustration. This is my biggest problem.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  And I literally just got chills when Julio said that. And then after the chills, I had like a hot flash of anger and literally began sweating the minute he said that.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  And I just got chills again. I just got chills again. I just got chills again.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  You know why I'm getting chills? Because my gut is telling me, Alex, you aren't professional. You suck.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  Alex, you've got to go to the next level. You've got to get yourself together.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  You were sent that by listeners two weeks ago. You confirmed it was real.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  It tied into Agenda 21. It tied into everything and was another key confirmation matrix point that confirmed hundreds of other data points.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  And I printed it at home, didn't bring it, didn't cover it, and then it makes me angry to think of how many other things I'm aware of and I don't cover.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  And then, and then literally my mind explodes into fractal understanding and awareness of just how diabolical this green neo feudalistic serfdom is, how they are openly going to herd people into these labor camp sectors.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  All the official UN maps of over half the U.S. off limits, the checkpoints to track us, and this green tyranny that Club of Rome talks about merging with the quote anti-terror system that they wrote about in 1991.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  And I meant to give that to Watson. So let me stop you, Julio, because again, I saw it. I printed it out.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  But now I forget the name of it. Give me the website, the name of the paper, and where it is. We'll pull it up right now.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  Oh, I see. That's the problem. I'm currently driving right now and I don't have a computer.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  Alex, if you just Google, it's right on the UN CanTune website. It's underneath the documents tab. I apologize for this, but it's on their own website.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  No, it's not you. It's not I'm not growling because of you, Julio. Whenever I constantly see hardcore stuff and I'm so overwhelmed that then I don't even...
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  And just while you did this, while you spurred my memory, I've had like 10 or 15 other things pop up in my head to the point of I just want to smash the microphone,
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  tump the desk over, and run screaming down the street. If people knew how hardcore it is, how much worse it is than we can tell you, how fast they're moving.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  World government openly. And I can't handle it all anymore. I'm sick of it. I'm tired of the globalists. They're so evil.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  I mean, Julio, they admittedly murder our troops and chemical weapons test, release biological weapons in the New York subway,
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  radiate foster children, murder people, inject children with syphilis. They get caught and we still sit here and trust the government and have debates about did they stage the terror attacks or not.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  Of course they stage the terror attacks. Now listen, what section was this under? So I guess we just pull up the UN subsection.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  But a lot of times they create a whole new URL. Is it the CanTune meeting? What's it called?
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  It's the, you just had a Google UN CanTune conference and it takes you, it's like the first or second link on Google. It takes you to the exact website.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  I know, I've seen it. That's my frustration. Okay, UN, as soon as I settle down, I'll be able to remember.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  UN Climate Conference, and then think back, we'll need to then search the term on the site, sustainability, communities, Mexico, is that it?
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  Yeah, it talks about, it says Mexico leading the way. It's under the documents tab.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  Okay, Mexico leading the way, but you're a long time listener, Julio. You've been calling for years. Do you remember the stories I told of when I was 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 years old?
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  Every year, my parents' favorite holiday destination, because it was only two hours away from Austin via plane, was CanTune.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  We'd fly in, we'd stay one day at a hotel, then we'd get in the car and we'd drive to cenotes, ruins.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  We'd drive way down into southern Mexico, where the Mexicans actually stay when they're on vacation, ten times more beautiful than CanTune.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  And I would see all these little UN signs everywhere. I'll tell folks when we come back, great job Julio, spurring my memory on that.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  But anyways, the UN kicked almost all the poor Mexicans who own their own land, who'd been there for thousands of years off their own property.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  The UN did this, and then forced them up to Mexico City, and that was part of a UN program. So yes, the UN now is going to do the same thing again in Mexico.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:11.000]  We'll be right back.
