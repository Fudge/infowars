[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:35.520]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:35.520 --> 00:40.480]  get ready ladies and gentlemen this is gonna be another incredibly important
[00:40.480 --> 00:44.560]  global transmission jam-packed with guests analysis you name it we're gonna
[00:44.560 --> 00:49.600]  be here for the next four hours Paul Joseph Watson will honcho and quarterback
[00:49.600 --> 00:54.000]  the fourth hour today we have a very special a group of in studio guest as
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.400]  well I'll tell you about in the next segment this is another information
[00:58.400 --> 01:03.000]  overload but I must cover it all the situation the Middle East and North
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.040]  Africa has been destabilized by design we predicted exactly what would now
[01:08.040 --> 01:12.320]  begin to unfold five years ago with a destabilization program that began in
[01:12.320 --> 01:19.040]  Libya and the stage to Arab Spring run by MI6 the CIA Massad and other major
[01:19.040 --> 01:25.680]  Western governments and NATO now the destabilization is intensifying but not
[01:25.680 --> 01:31.800]  going exactly how they had wanted it to go and the Russians basically have moved
[01:31.800 --> 01:38.160]  tactical nuclear weapons obviously up to their borders and into Syria and are
[01:38.160 --> 01:42.160]  basically telegraphing that they're prepared to use them but that's only
[01:42.160 --> 01:46.400]  after the Saudis announced okay we have nukes okay we're gonna send in a
[01:46.400 --> 01:51.160]  multi-hundred thousand person army into Syria and you better not fight us
[01:51.160 --> 01:55.720]  Assad or we'll use nukes on you so the whole situation is hurtling towards
[01:55.720 --> 02:02.280]  crisis but this just broke just broke 30 minutes ago as I was shooting a live
[02:02.280 --> 02:08.680]  Facebook mentions warning of this this is from Reuters it's also in the
[02:08.680 --> 02:14.800]  Associated Press and we will see if this holds but US Russia US Russia reach
[02:14.800 --> 02:23.680]  deal on ceasefire in Syria to begin February 27th or in about five days so
[02:23.680 --> 02:29.320]  we're gonna be going over that also now we're hearing that we have to reinvade
[02:29.320 --> 02:36.840]  Libya to kick out the al Qaeda that Hillary and Obama put in charge and I
[02:36.840 --> 02:40.680]  said when they did it I said watch in a few years they'll be saying we have to
[02:40.680 --> 02:44.000]  reinvade to kick them out but it won't be to actually kick them out it'll be to
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.280]  fight anybody fighting them and if you actually read closely they're not
[02:47.280 --> 02:51.040]  bombing Benghazi al Qaeda's home base in North Africa really their global
[02:51.040 --> 02:55.320]  command base now even more than Syria and they're going to actually go after
[02:55.320 --> 03:00.040]  the opposition which is what they're doing so the the the attack on al Qaeda
[03:00.040 --> 03:06.040]  is actually to protect them and it'll even come out like it has him Iraq and
[03:06.040 --> 03:10.440]  Syria that's the case it'll just be in the back of the newspaper but this is
[03:10.440 --> 03:15.840]  how truly sickening the controllers are using the fog of war that's coming up
[03:15.840 --> 03:22.440]  Donald Trump has turbocharged to the lead with 60 plus delegates his closest
[03:22.440 --> 03:28.600]  rival only has eight delegates that's Ted Cruz and Hillary despite being down
[03:28.600 --> 03:33.480]  in polls has now stolen Nevada as she stole New Hampshire and as she stole
[03:33.480 --> 03:40.120]  Iowa and I mean she stole the first two openly and she lost by 20 points in
[03:40.120 --> 03:43.760]  New Hampshire but got the delegates most of the delegates so that's how that
[03:43.760 --> 03:47.040]  works and they're now in the New York Times why they just broke it the New
[03:47.040 --> 03:52.160]  York Times is so cutting-edge give them a Pulitzer right now that the super
[03:52.160 --> 03:56.760]  delegates don't matter you the election doesn't matter because the super
[03:56.760 --> 03:59.840]  delegates will will do what the party tells them and they're all going for
[03:59.840 --> 04:04.280]  Hillary so Bernie could win a landslide he's gonna lose the nomination my gosh
[04:04.280 --> 04:09.120]  that I just learned that from the New York Times this morning we broke it down
[04:09.120 --> 04:11.920]  years ago we broke it down this year we predicted it would happen it's now
[04:11.920 --> 04:15.680]  happening and our own Richard Reeves will be popping in at 12 noon for about 15
[04:15.680 --> 04:21.520]  minutes from Nevada ahead of the Republican caucus tomorrow and then we
[04:21.520 --> 04:24.720]  also of course are going to be covering things right through Super Tuesday on
[04:24.720 --> 04:30.960]  March 1st so we are in the field on that front I've not even begun to scratch the
[04:30.960 --> 04:38.040]  surface of the New York Times again has a big announcement the Sun is yellow in
[04:38.040 --> 04:45.280]  color oh no it's even more stupid than that scientists ponder the prospect of
[04:45.280 --> 04:53.160]  contagious cancer it's viral well that's the main call what oh and it's
[04:53.160 --> 04:58.200]  weaponized this government made it a wall what
[04:58.200 --> 05:02.680]  Jim Bush is out of the presidential race the former Florida governor has
[05:02.680 --> 05:07.120]  dropped out of the 2016 White House race after losing the South Carolina primary
[05:07.120 --> 05:11.200]  badly to billionaire Donald Trump who secured a strong victory with nearly a
[05:11.200 --> 05:14.640]  third of the vote Bush formally launched his campaign back in June about six
[05:14.640 --> 05:18.040]  months after he announced he would run for top office was supported by the
[05:18.040 --> 05:22.000]  right to rise political action committee which had raised in excess a hundred
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.960]  million dollars for his campaign launch but no amount of money could save Bush a
[05:25.960 --> 05:30.200]  dorky candidate that one point actually beg the audience to please clap for him
[05:30.200 --> 05:33.600]  after his speech it was hilariously thrown off the stage at another speech
[05:33.600 --> 05:37.520]  for going over his allotted time people are simply tired establishment candidates
[05:37.520 --> 05:41.000]  who want amnesty for illegals flooding into the country it also didn't help
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.720]  that bush blew off the idea of releasing the missing 28 pages from the 9 11
[05:44.720 --> 05:48.360]  report which were classified not because the national security but because they
[05:48.360 --> 05:52.200]  reveal Saudi Arabia's involvements in the attacks for more election news check
[05:52.200 --> 06:00.840]  out info worse.com prisonplanet.tv this is Kid Daniels reporting thousands of
[06:00.840 --> 06:05.400]  years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the
[06:05.400 --> 06:10.520]  drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a
[06:10.520 --> 06:16.760]  defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs
[06:16.760 --> 06:22.280]  they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there
[06:22.280 --> 06:26.760]  are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water
[06:26.760 --> 06:31.720]  and the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and
[06:31.720 --> 06:36.720]  accelerate our journey towards death I personally counter this onslaught with

[08:06.040 --> 08:09.560]  Waging war on corruption
[08:09.560 --> 08:18.720]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War
[08:18.720 --> 08:24.120]  The joint chiefs of staff last year this year as well have come out you can pull up
[08:24.120 --> 08:31.720]  their statements and warned that the world is in the most dangerous geopolitical
[08:31.720 --> 08:38.960]  season that they've ever seen the British Ministry of Defense in 2007 as
[08:38.960 --> 08:43.000]  well as the Pentagon put out detailed reports that basically mirrored each
[08:43.000 --> 08:49.400]  other predicting that the world would enter global crisis by 2016 into 2022
[08:49.400 --> 08:54.840]  because of demographic cliffs and other major issues you want to pull up those
[08:54.840 --> 09:00.040]  reports just type in flash mobs brain ships a grim future you'll get the
[09:00.040 --> 09:06.600]  London Guardian that leaks and links to the British Ministry of Defense report
[09:06.600 --> 09:11.560]  and then you can also in the same article find the US report that's
[09:11.560 --> 09:15.320]  another reason when you tune in you notice what we cover and warn about
[09:15.320 --> 09:19.800]  just keeps happening the social engineers the big think tanks know full
[09:19.800 --> 09:27.880]  well what's going on they just don't normally put it in the newspaper but
[09:27.880 --> 09:34.960]  more and more the establishment media doesn't want to be obsolete or passé so
[09:34.960 --> 09:42.680]  they are admitting more and more of it we had scientists on 16 17 years ago that
[09:42.680 --> 09:48.560]  microwave radiation from cell phones severs the tails basically off of
[09:48.560 --> 09:53.160]  sperm it vibrates them off so I can take a snake and sit there and shake it you
[09:53.160 --> 09:57.040]  know the tail crack off anybody's ever tried to catch a snake notice a lot
[09:57.040 --> 10:00.440]  times the tail snaps off for a lizard same deal with these cells you just get
[10:00.440 --> 10:04.520]  them with like an ultrasound basically is what radiation does that wavelength
[10:04.520 --> 10:09.040]  and it rattles them apart that's been known forever oh it's mainstream news
[10:09.040 --> 10:16.160]  today oh my gosh don't keep yourself on your pocket you're like well I'm not
[10:16.160 --> 10:20.720]  using it when it's in my pocket it's sending messages back and forth it's on
[10:20.720 --> 10:27.400]  all the time folks oh the New York Times admits scientists ponder the prospect
[10:27.400 --> 10:37.540]  of contagious cancer they've known that cancer was transmissible for over a
[10:37.540 --> 10:43.200]  hundred years in rat studies before 1900 I mean I've made films on this
[10:43.200 --> 10:49.640]  subject they know that over a hundred million Americans got cancer from SV
[10:49.640 --> 10:54.720]  40 in the first 20 years plus of the polio vaccine you just type into a
[10:54.720 --> 11:03.440]  search engine CDC documents on SV 40 in cancer and you'll get stuff released in
[11:03.440 --> 11:10.440]  the 70s from the 60s where they predict that 98 million was the number they used
[11:10.440 --> 11:17.160]  from their actuaries got cancers that were non-existent or rare that's why
[11:17.160 --> 11:21.840]  there's all these hundreds of new cancers and then here's the big one every
[11:21.840 --> 11:26.480]  major vaccine you look at that deals with virus or attenuated just so happens
[11:26.480 --> 11:29.800]  magically to have all these other weird viruses in it and it's not an accident
[11:29.800 --> 11:34.400]  it's the Rockefeller Foundation operation I've had top brain surgeons and
[11:34.400 --> 11:37.240]  others on who've read the medical literature I've read it too but I mean
[11:37.240 --> 11:41.200]  Russell Blalock and others
[11:42.920 --> 11:47.760]  coming on to talk about the fact that it was a deliberate program of course
[11:47.760 --> 11:53.280]  folks things were even more toxic in our environment in the 20s and 30s and I
[11:53.280 --> 11:58.160]  mean they used to dump toxic waste mercury lead arsenic stuff worse than
[11:58.160 --> 12:03.800]  that right in the rivers and we didn't have cancer rates like this people ate
[12:03.800 --> 12:10.920]  bigger calorie meals than we do now why are we dying more and I've got all this
[12:10.920 --> 12:18.680]  world news to cover it's just that just on the medical end of things it's known
[12:18.680 --> 12:27.160]  and I've had the survivors and the nurses and people on in famous cases
[12:27.160 --> 12:31.920]  where people got killed to cover up what was going on in weaponized cancer
[12:31.920 --> 12:36.640]  research in the early 60s and of course it's been declassified that was a plan to
[12:36.640 --> 12:42.160]  basically put cancer viruses into a a sauce that would be put on Fidel
[12:42.160 --> 12:49.440]  Castro's food so this is personal for me and it's personal for everybody else
[12:49.440 --> 12:54.640]  because chances are your grandparents you lost your mom your dad you name it you
[12:54.640 --> 12:57.600]  wonder why the military has such high rates of cancer there's a lot of reasons
[12:57.600 --> 13:02.320]  but the biggest one is the vaccines and the fact of the New York Times would
[13:02.320 --> 13:08.280]  come out with an article going you know what scientists ponder the prospect of
[13:08.280 --> 13:12.520]  contagious cancer from vaccines
[13:15.000 --> 13:22.280]  ladies and gentlemen cancer is part of the immortal cell line and if you don't
[13:22.280 --> 13:27.600]  know what that is it's it's they call it the immortal cell line in medical
[13:27.600 --> 13:31.200]  literature it's one of the most highly studied things and one of the most
[13:31.200 --> 13:40.160]  secret things but the cells actually are basically zombies they're they're
[13:40.160 --> 13:42.680]  undead
[13:43.040 --> 13:49.480]  basically vampire cell lines and I don't mean vampires like Count Dracula I mean
[13:49.480 --> 13:59.200]  look it up immortal cell lines there are some cancer cells
[13:59.200 --> 14:08.600]  that do not die unless you burn them that's how powerful they are and the
[14:08.600 --> 14:13.320]  leader obsessed with it because if you can figure out how to get that in the
[14:13.320 --> 14:20.160]  rest of the body but not have it mutate then you basically live forever this is
[14:20.160 --> 14:23.640]  a big deal and and and it's what the globalists are obsessed with and this is
[14:23.640 --> 14:28.520]  just more of these realms we expose here but look at this article scientists
[14:28.520 --> 14:37.120]  ponder the prospect of contagious cancer oh my goodness that's why elites pay to
[14:37.120 --> 14:42.680]  have fresh surgical tools used and they go to private elite clinics in
[14:42.680 --> 14:46.800]  Switzerland and in Germany and other areas this is in the medical news but
[14:46.800 --> 14:51.240]  it's not popularly known because they understand that there are immortal cell
[14:51.240 --> 14:57.640]  lines or close to immortal cell lines of cancer that gets stuck to those pieces
[14:57.640 --> 15:05.080]  of equipment even if you put it in a autoclave even if you dip them in acid
[15:05.080 --> 15:09.080]  you can look this up there's also things that aren't even really cancer cells
[15:09.080 --> 15:14.560]  they're more like crystals but they have a cellular replication system similar
[15:14.560 --> 15:23.760]  to biological cells call it nature's nanotech prions is one name of them
[15:23.760 --> 15:28.200]  spongiform encephalopathy and all that stuff's totally coming from it but is
[15:28.200 --> 15:33.120]  this is the stuff going on out there we're back in 1900 medicine bacteria and
[15:33.120 --> 15:36.920]  viruses and all this and and there's stuff way more complex than that was
[15:36.920 --> 15:42.680]  organic and that's been artificially created so scientists ponder the
[15:42.680 --> 15:48.000]  prospect of contagious cancer for all its peculiar heart cancer comes with a
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.240]  saving grace if nothing else can stop a tumor's mad evolution the cancer
[15:52.240 --> 15:55.720]  ultimately dies along with its host everything the malignant cells have
[15:55.720 --> 16:01.000]  learned about outwitting the patient's defenses and those of the oncologist is
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.840]  erased the next case of cancer is another victim must start anew it talks
[16:06.840 --> 16:16.640]  about recent papers about contagious cells and viruses this is like this is
[16:16.640 --> 16:20.440]  like the New York Times coming out and saying there may have been two brothers
[16:20.440 --> 16:28.960]  in Kitty Hawk out on the planes get this they may have actually invented and
[16:28.960 --> 16:37.320]  documented get ready for it powered flight in 2016 give the New York Times a
[16:37.320 --> 16:43.960]  Pulitzer prize folks did you know that did you know that that that that that
[16:43.960 --> 16:48.600]  that most cancers viral oh my gosh did you know it's declassified they put it
[16:48.600 --> 16:53.080]  in the vaccines to kill us you little worm I mean how do these worms write
[16:53.080 --> 16:56.400]  these articles to condition us and get us to accept the next phase when their
[16:56.400 --> 17:01.440]  own families will be killed they don't care it's too much fun to walk into the
[17:01.440 --> 17:05.440]  New York Times because the minute they try to write an article about what's
[17:05.440 --> 17:09.240]  really going on they'll be out on their butts and won't be able to drink coffee
[17:09.240 --> 17:15.280]  at Starbucks with their New York Times name tag and I mean people are enemies
[17:15.280 --> 17:19.000]  of humanity I don't know about the particular person maybe any idiot George
[17:19.000 --> 17:30.760]  Johnson and by the way people think I'm being mean to George Johnson if you
[17:30.760 --> 17:34.160]  don't know and you're writing articles about this you're a you're the biggest
[17:34.160 --> 17:37.600]  idiot and I read your article you clearly are not an idiot so there you go
[17:37.600 --> 17:42.000]  this is a revelation of the method it's like telling somebody that's been locked
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.160]  up in a basement for 20 years that there's you know that that again I'm
[17:46.160 --> 17:50.240]  gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna discover the Sun for you the way they talk to their
[17:50.240 --> 17:53.120]  and people that read the New York Times think they're like really smart like
[17:53.120 --> 17:58.840]  it's channeling the mind of God I've talked to people that I see people have

[30:37.280 --> 30:41.520]  and if Syria falls Russia will be geopolitically isolated from the rest of
[30:41.520 --> 30:44.880]  the world which is exactly what the globalists want so they can easily

[34:59.160 --> 35:04.120]  part of it and show all the other people watching TV or listening or reading
[35:04.120 --> 35:09.360]  about it that look it's safe to go to the waterhole and drink there's no 20 foot
[35:09.360 --> 35:14.840]  crocodile gonna shoot out and grab you and drag you into the muck to our
[35:14.840 --> 35:19.480]  programming our instincts it must be safe it's fun there's no predators here
[35:19.480 --> 35:24.640]  there's no big lions or tigers there's no big crocodiles there's nothing gonna
[35:24.640 --> 35:30.040]  eat you because look Zuckerberg doesn't look scary he's got a great t-shirt on
[35:30.040 --> 35:36.040]  little white tennis shoes he's smiling look a little smile it's a little smile
[35:36.040 --> 35:40.200]  he calls his users that trusting dumb efforts and he's walking by the dumb
[35:40.200 --> 35:44.560]  efforts right there and they've all got that goggles hooked on but notice he
[35:44.560 --> 35:54.080]  doesn't he's upright he's bipedal he doesn't have a earpiece in he doesn't
[35:54.080 --> 35:58.440]  have a phone in his hand he doesn't have a phone in his front pocket he's
[35:58.440 --> 36:02.120]  strutting by his prisoners
[36:02.120 --> 36:10.160]  but you notice he is a military man he always wears that gray t-shirt
[36:10.160 --> 36:15.200]  there's the bling and all that matter to him the bling is nothing but bait on the
[36:15.200 --> 36:20.040]  end of a hook to lure you in people say oh a lot a lot of virtual reality and I
[36:20.040 --> 36:23.440]  you know I think it's great yeah but the way they're designing it and rolling it
[36:23.440 --> 36:29.720]  out is designed to put you into a proto matrix the beginnings of the wire head
[36:29.720 --> 36:33.720]  to culture that the Pentagon and others admit they believe is what the elite have
[36:33.720 --> 36:43.760]  chosen to be our evolution where you then are self-contained and even provide
[36:43.760 --> 36:53.800]  power with your body's heat to run the system isn't that just special in my
[36:53.800 --> 36:57.320]  book the scent and a tyranny out of print that's on prison planet TV it's
[36:57.320 --> 37:02.040]  online for free to I show some of the declassified army documents from 77 that
[37:02.040 --> 37:06.680]  the Federation of Scientists put out the Pentagon asked it to be reclassified
[37:06.680 --> 37:11.760]  actually after we publicized it and it talked about what they called Skynet and
[37:11.760 --> 37:15.480]  how they would use GPS to control everything and to have remote control
[37:15.480 --> 37:23.800]  cars and track everything we do through the internet this is in 77 and how we
[37:23.800 --> 37:27.520]  would all hook into the internet as a hive mind he's the word hive and then
[37:27.520 --> 37:32.240]  finally end up living in pods self-contained pods and we would choose
[37:32.240 --> 37:36.120]  to live in virtual reality
[37:40.280 --> 37:50.380]  isn't that just darling and you're like wow matrix came out in 99
[37:50.380 --> 37:55.920]  Terminator came out in the 80s Skynet yeah yeah they just take what they're
[37:55.920 --> 38:00.280]  really doing and then fictionalize it just like X files just like you know I
[38:00.280 --> 38:04.960]  can't wait cuz Chris Carter says he's game to meet I'm even asking to an
[38:04.960 --> 38:10.120]  interview yet but I'm sure he'll do it I know that one of his big actors you know
[38:10.120 --> 38:14.960]  came to the house one time I was in town he called a producer on news that can
[38:14.960 --> 38:18.120]  come over and here he was and he wasn't there really to interview me he was there
[38:18.120 --> 38:21.880]  to say you know the CIA planted that lone government episode where they fly
[38:21.880 --> 38:25.760]  the jumbo jet in the World Trade Center to bring in martial law they use a
[38:25.760 --> 38:31.040]  drill to cover it up and they want to blame countries that didn't do it but
[38:31.040 --> 38:34.880]  really it's a rogue group in the government that carried out 9-11 and he
[38:34.880 --> 38:38.120]  said all he all he knows is that Chris Carter said that story was planted on
[38:38.120 --> 38:43.640]  him by the CIA but that he was basically too scared to talk about and we reached
[38:43.640 --> 38:46.520]  out to Carter and I don't know that story is exactly accurate that's in the
[38:46.520 --> 38:51.800]  midst of time you know like nine ten years ago that Dean Haglin came to my
[38:51.800 --> 38:54.660]  house you know the interview is there he said less in the interview but said a
[38:54.660 --> 39:03.300]  lot of it but I'm gonna get to go out to California and meet with Carter I look
[39:03.300 --> 39:07.560]  forward to doing that not because oh he's one of the biggest TV producers out
[39:07.560 --> 39:10.940]  there or not because you know they might want me to do a cameo or something on the
[39:10.940 --> 39:14.000]  X files I mean I've been in movies I've been on TV I've been there I've done it
[39:14.000 --> 39:20.400]  it's interesting but it's it's it's not that big a deal the big deal is I want
[39:20.400 --> 39:26.440]  to ask him about that and of course they might call him I'm threatening now
[39:26.440 --> 39:30.200]  but but he knows he doesn't have to answer if he doesn't want to it's just
[39:30.200 --> 39:35.200]  this is how close we're getting to it folks I mean you want to know if Don
[39:35.200 --> 39:41.160]  Levin was an inside job there was an hour-long hit TV program X file spinoff
[39:41.160 --> 39:46.200]  Lone Gunman where a criminal element of the government hijacks a jet by remote
[39:46.200 --> 39:52.240]  control claims hijackers are on board but really it's remote controlled locked
[39:52.240 --> 39:58.160]  down and they're gonna fly at the World Trade Center and blame Afghanistan
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.960]  think about that
[40:05.480 --> 40:09.400]  in fact we ought to put a piece together with just my talk about this today and
[40:09.400 --> 40:12.880]  with the original clips we actually bought the DVD set to have an HD back
[40:12.880 --> 40:21.760]  there but see now I'm that close to unraveling that riddle one or other
[40:21.760 --> 40:26.520]  stories Chris Carter has and he said just come on out I've just been quite
[40:26.520 --> 40:28.960]  frank with you busy to get out there when I'm gonna get out there I want to
[40:28.960 --> 40:31.960]  kill two birds with one stone I still need to call Joe Rogan and you know his
[40:31.960 --> 40:35.200]  podcast a few other things few other bucket list things when I go out there
[40:35.200 --> 40:39.040]  but the joke he's saying come out come out come on the show so I'm finally get
[40:39.040 --> 40:42.640]  that done after all these years but I digress I want to get into all the big
[40:42.640 --> 40:46.800]  news now but but but Zuckerberg in the photo he's walking upright he's a man
[40:46.800 --> 40:51.160]  he's not encumbered by all this tech he's like Steve Jobs it said I never let
[40:51.160 --> 40:54.920]  my kids be on any type of computer or iPhone or iPad it reprograms the brain
[40:54.920 --> 41:03.000]  it lowers IQ it sucks you into a false reality see for me I use an iPad like a
[41:03.000 --> 41:09.960]  TV set or a newspaper I watch stuff on it I read things on it I use it as a
[41:09.960 --> 41:14.920]  tool and then I I put programming on it to counter the globalist like to always
[41:14.920 --> 41:20.880]  say I don't watch a lot of TV I'm on TV last few years I've been on five
[41:20.880 --> 41:24.480]  different shows and series couple of my basically hosts they didn't say I was the
[41:24.480 --> 41:27.120]  host but you know they interviewed me for six hours and I'm the main you know
[41:27.120 --> 41:33.640]  guy on all of them I'm not watched one of the shows I'll be in a hotel room or
[41:33.640 --> 41:37.320]  something or be my kids will be now let them watch TV like twice a week be
[41:37.320 --> 41:40.840]  scrolling through history channel discovery though daddy daddy or to your
[41:40.840 --> 41:45.560]  TV show I'm like we're not watching that and the elite are the same way they
[41:45.560 --> 41:53.360]  understand that this is basically something that limits your humanity now
[41:53.360 --> 42:00.720]  I will say I will go see a Cohen brothers movie the new one hell Caesar is
[42:00.720 --> 42:06.360]  excellent I'm not gonna spoil it but it's anti-communist but very
[42:06.360 --> 42:13.760]  sophisticated and it is really deep now I will say I don't say this in the
[42:13.760 --> 42:18.200]  latest fashion I don't think hardly anybody but the Cohen brothers are gonna
[42:18.200 --> 42:26.160]  are gonna get it now it's a big hit it has rave reviews and it's multi-faceted
[42:26.160 --> 42:30.600]  see what Hollywood was like in the 50s see a lot of famous scenes in Hollywood
[42:30.600 --> 42:39.880]  redone see it in HD color see how the studios worked and operated but it's
[42:39.880 --> 42:51.440]  really a Christ allegory in a very pro-Christian film and almost anti
[42:51.440 --> 42:59.560]  orthodox Jew it was just unbelievably sophisticated I've got to go see it two
[42:59.560 --> 43:08.400]  or three more times because it was so sophisticated but I digress it's got a
[43:08.400 --> 43:14.720]  lot of facets to it so it's not something you go drink a few beers and watch you
[43:14.720 --> 43:20.800]  you want to go really pay attention to it to try to get all the levels and of
[43:20.800 --> 43:31.640]  course the main character is a Christ figure himself it's strong very esoteric
[43:31.640 --> 43:44.000]  very hidden all right let's continue here ladies and gentlemen let me give you
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.120]  the secret of the film it's saying you're not gonna have communism and
[43:48.120 --> 43:52.040]  collectivism from a centralized top-down system you're going to have it
[43:52.040 --> 43:56.360]  through something like Jesus Christ because it's not communism it's
[43:56.360 --> 44:04.600]  individualism and professionalism and love exercise to everyone then frees
[44:04.600 --> 44:08.840]  humanity and allows people to excel at what they themselves are good at but
[44:08.840 --> 44:14.680]  that we're not all equal in every way we're just born equally free if we have
[44:14.680 --> 44:19.480]  that potential and I'm dumbing that down
[44:19.480 --> 44:29.280]  but it basically says Jesus Christ can fix the world I mean are the Coen
[44:29.280 --> 44:32.960]  Brothers closet Christians or something I just couldn't believe it and by the
[44:32.960 --> 44:36.800]  way it's not done double-edged and I just don't get the sophistication that it
[44:36.800 --> 44:41.560]  was something that different audiences see as as as as for them that's that's a
[44:41.560 --> 44:46.520]  classic paradigm no no no that's not I watched it very very closely okay I
[44:46.520 --> 44:49.360]  digress we've got big guests coming up and a ton of news I can get into it
[44:49.360 --> 44:53.920]  right now I'm just going to run through this stuff fast here but before I do
[44:53.920 --> 44:59.640]  that supermail vitality is basically sold out today we're gonna have to pull it
[44:59.640 --> 45:02.200]  if you have to hold back some bottles for folks that are signed up with auto
[45:02.200 --> 45:06.680]  ship the way to never sell out of any of the products that we've developed or
[45:06.680 --> 45:10.600]  have is to sign up for auto ship the particular items you want you can set
[45:10.600 --> 45:13.920]  up for a month two months three months whatever you want cancel anytime but you
[45:13.920 --> 45:24.520]  get 10% off 10% off on it and things that are sold out we hold back stuff for
[45:24.520 --> 45:29.400]  folks that are on auto ship as a necessity supermail will sell out today
[45:29.400 --> 45:35.400]  but it will be available if you sign up for auto ship super female is still
[45:35.400 --> 45:38.680]  available probably will sell out next week and it basically is almost the same
[45:38.680 --> 45:43.320]  formula a little bit tweak for women but but men can take it isn't harmful but
[45:43.320 --> 45:47.200]  these are powerful formulas just just try them and your purchase helps fund
[45:47.200 --> 45:52.560]  the broadcast you really can't lose on that front now this is what fellow in
[45:52.560 --> 45:56.720]  Boise Idaho said guide said this is a far superior to other products I've
[45:56.720 --> 46:00.240]  tried in the past stamina and clarity especially in the mornings with no
[46:00.240 --> 46:03.720]  running out of gas in the afternoon it works for me and I have noticed a better

[46:29.120 --> 46:35.040]  great mood I love this stuff yeah it sits over the top just all I know is most

[46:37.840 --> 46:39.960]  really notice something in the morning of their men I'm just gonna leave it at

[47:28.600 --> 47:31.360]  the three minutes before break in the next whole six minutes segment then I'm
[47:31.360 --> 47:35.200]  gonna go into detail in the next hour before our guest joins us and Reeves is
[47:35.200 --> 47:40.400]  popping in as well let me just do it this way starting with this stack already
[47:40.400 --> 47:44.040]  began with but then going through it. Scientist part of the prospect of
[47:44.040 --> 47:52.400]  contagious cancer. New York Times. Super condom backed by Texas A&M and Gates
[47:52.400 --> 47:59.480]  Foundation targets diseases uh-huh uh-huh Gates has got some medicine he wants you
[47:59.480 --> 48:06.920]  to put on your Hitler had a tiny deformed member I must have been using
[48:06.920 --> 48:15.000]  Bill Gates condoms as well as one testicle historian claims. MWC 2016
[48:15.000 --> 48:21.160]  Shoney puts AI assistant in one's ear yes the chipping of the brain begins the
[48:21.160 --> 48:27.840]  creeping in the the the the warming into the wires. I'm not starting with the most
[48:27.840 --> 48:31.800]  important news I'm just getting right into it. US scrambles to contain growing
[48:31.800 --> 48:39.600]  ISIS threat in Libya New York Times that our government put there. Crowd cheers
[48:39.600 --> 48:44.240]  this German migrant hotel is burned out even as they try to stop firefighters
[48:44.240 --> 48:49.840]  battling the blaze. Yep the Germans are getting mad. Largest ever US South Korea
[48:49.840 --> 48:53.880]  drill planned as a warning to North Korea. North Korea threatens to nuke the
[48:53.880 --> 49:00.840]  South. Across Europe gay migrants face abuse in asylum shelters. Well it's okay
[49:00.840 --> 49:07.720]  when the Muslims do it. Zika has been linked to burnt effects now maybe
[49:07.720 --> 49:12.800]  causing paralysis. Yeah that's exactly what our buyer weapons expert said he
[49:12.800 --> 49:17.120]  said it's actually a bunch of stuff it's not just Zika that's a cover. The US
[49:17.120 --> 49:22.120]  states where recession is already a reality and it breaks down how Moody's
[49:22.120 --> 49:25.400]  and other analytics say that a bunch of US states are already in deep recession
[49:25.400 --> 49:28.960]  or depression. Yeah again the depressions here it's just not evenly
[49:28.960 --> 49:36.000]  distributed. Now let's get into the really important meat and potatoes right
[49:36.000 --> 49:41.800]  now and I'll cover the election when we come back. EU has no plan B of Britain
[49:41.800 --> 49:47.880]  votes to quit EU. That's Reuters. Well about 90% of the laws it was 80% get
[49:47.880 --> 49:51.520]  made by the EU. It's totally wrecking the country. It's designed to suck them
[49:51.520 --> 49:59.560]  right. Even the super ultra liberal mayor of London backs the British exit or
[49:59.560 --> 50:04.840]  Brexit because the Brits now understand the EU is a tyranny. They're founders
[50:04.840 --> 50:12.160]  people like you name it what's his name I have I don't have a teleprompter.
[50:12.160 --> 50:16.360]  Peter Sutherland with the founder of the EU now they head of the quote migrant
[50:16.360 --> 50:21.080]  office that's the invasion office says we want to end the western culture it's
[50:21.080 --> 50:23.720]  bad you can pull up his quotes we want to bankrupt we want to take everybody
[50:23.720 --> 50:30.080]  over want to end and wealth remember that came out last week that the carbon
[50:30.080 --> 50:33.760]  taxes about making you poor so we're get to all that so even the Liberals now
[50:33.760 --> 50:39.680]  are against it. EU referendum Cameron sets June date for UK vote but here's the
[50:39.680 --> 50:43.240]  big secret they're probably gonna shoot it down at the end even though it's
[50:43.240 --> 50:46.960]  popular to get out just like Scotland claiming people the last minute didn't
[50:46.960 --> 50:51.240]  want to but have the politicians act like they're against it because upwards
[50:51.240 --> 50:57.360]  of 85% don't want to be in the euro that's my call stay with us.

[54:41.400 --> 54:46.360]  think I'm old buddy but no no I'm like 15 years then before he got married again
[54:46.360 --> 54:51.280]  before he had his daughters everything all right side issue boys got some cool
[54:51.280 --> 54:56.240]  classic cars speaking of the Cullen brothers movie they've got this Texas
[54:56.240 --> 55:02.200]  cowboy character do you think's real dumb and then of course he's real smart
[55:02.200 --> 55:07.960]  and actually helps save the day you know just stuff like that because it shows
[55:07.960 --> 55:12.520]  all these Easterners making fun of him thinking he's stupid I mean the Cullen
[55:12.520 --> 55:18.360]  brothers just really get it on so many levels they really do because that's a
[55:18.360 --> 55:21.440]  whole thing in places like Texas where people act real friendly and nice they
[55:21.440 --> 55:24.440]  are friendly and nice they don't show off and tell you what's really going on
[55:24.440 --> 55:29.280]  behind their eyes and then they can just get sophisticated on you in about half
[55:29.280 --> 55:33.240]  a second flat and then nothing is focused on the east coast or Europe or
[55:33.240 --> 55:36.480]  whatever they just come around I think people in Texas or other areas ride
[55:36.480 --> 55:40.720]  horses to work or if we do you know that we can hardly tire shoelaces and it's
[55:40.720 --> 55:44.040]  kind of the opposite living in big cities is what domestication my experience
[55:44.040 --> 55:51.480]  okay so EU has no plan no B plan and Britain votes no to quit one and mayor

[57:04.320 --> 57:09.280]  to get to but let me start getting into what's coming up we'll have Richard
[57:09.280 --> 57:13.520]  Reeves pop in from Nevada with the big Republican caucus coming up tomorrow
[57:13.520 --> 57:17.360]  he'll be joining us via video connection and we've got special guests I'm gonna
[57:17.360 --> 57:20.440]  tell you about the start of the next hour they're gonna be in studio I don't
[57:20.440 --> 57:23.840]  usually have my head spinning with a guest I mean I know this guy is and
[57:23.840 --> 57:27.000]  this other guy they got with them and all this intrigue and Kevin Booth takes
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.920]  like three four five years to make a film so it's always changing which is
[57:30.920 --> 57:38.320]  good he said shows on Showtime you name it and I've been a consultant on some of
[57:38.320 --> 57:42.560]  them and been in some of them but the point is this turned out to be a film
[57:42.560 --> 57:46.080]  about the drug war in marijuana and now it's turned into Eastern Europe and
[57:46.080 --> 57:49.960]  Al-Qaeda training bases and political dissidents and I've seen some of the
[57:49.960 --> 57:55.360]  footage that you know that's an upcoming film I mean it's crazy Kevin's got to go
[57:55.360 --> 57:58.320]  around all these bodyguards and stuff it's just wild so they're gonna be in
[57:58.320 --> 58:03.600]  studio I'll tell you about those guests coming up as well Russia is threatening
[58:03.600 --> 58:09.240]  to use tactical nuclear weapons in Syria well that's just part of the default
[58:09.240 --> 58:12.600]  setting of nature of the United States and Russia that if you have a force
[58:12.600 --> 58:16.080]  overwhelmed by a ground force use tactical nuclear weapons to defeat them
[58:16.080 --> 58:20.760]  but that's a big deal that Saudi Arabia says they're about to invade with
[58:20.760 --> 58:24.280]  ground troops in Syria and say what you want folks I don't take sides there I
[58:24.280 --> 58:30.120]  never been to Russia not lionizing Vladimir Putin my issue is Syria is
[58:30.120 --> 58:34.320]  invited putting in this is on Russia's doorstep the West is starting these wars

[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:05.560]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:13.000]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.880]  Richard Reeves is popping in for five minutes for the next segment and I'm
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.720]  going to tell you about the big guess we've got coming in here at the bottom
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:28.440]  of the hour I was getting into the Russia situation but I'm going to do that
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:33.640]  some with our guest because they're their home base is over in Eastern Europe
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:39.520]  and they can speak to that as well so we'll explore this along with the war on
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:45.480]  drugs and more our guest has a company valued at four billion dollars and is
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:55.160]  one of the biggest suppliers of accoutrements for the farming of certain
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:01:00.280]  things I'll just leave it at that until they're in studio with us coming up in
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:07.600]  t-minus 31 minutes in this short little segment though I want to get into the
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:11.400]  iPhone situation then we'll come back into the election then into Russia then
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:19.680]  into more but I'm not here trying to start a fight with anybody I don't wish
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:25.360]  harm upon the Muslims even the evil Wahhabist I just wanted to stop doing
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:30.840]  horrible things to people I don't want to be in a fight with some of the American
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:35.040]  militia who are very patriotic people but who are infiltrated in many cases and
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:41.600]  being manipulated like a magician's trick I don't want to be in a fight with
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.440]  the police I don't want to be in a fight with Black Lives Matter I don't want to
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:52.600]  be in a fight with anybody so I went and met with Lewis Farrakhan I know there's
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:58.200]  different factions in federal agencies I know the FBI has done a lot of really
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:03.040]  good things but also there are different elements of the FBI and different
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:06.720]  administrations that have been really bad things and I've tried to really study
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.120]  this Apple situation I've talked to engineers and others and they say that
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.400]  the algorithm to get into an iPhone is connected to the passcode and that there
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:20.880]  is a master key that Apple has and that if that gets out it would compromise the
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.600]  entire platform of the biggest company in the world and that could cause a
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:28.520]  depression in and of itself the FBI director has come out and I've got his
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:35.400]  quote he says don't panic it's not the end of the world and he comes off as
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.080]  better than some of the last directors so far what he's done so I reserve
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:44.600]  judgment and he says all we want is into this particular phone well why don't
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.720]  you have a relationship then to have a deal with Apple where you can go in and
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:52.000]  then Apple opens it for you and then you don't get the code but here's what I
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.320]  said in a video message of Trump saying I think overall he's wrong on this not
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:58.980]  that he's wrong he's right morally to say hey they got a warrant give him the
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.640]  code let him into the you know let him into that particular phone but but see
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.040]  it could let them into more than just that instead of precedent it's not that
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:11.160]  Apple's a good company they're very evil run some of the worst factories they
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:16.800]  they fund anti-gun stuff they're bad news I'm not defending Apple I'm saying
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:22.360]  that the users of it understand that if you start compromising its encryption
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.160]  and things because that's what the FBI wants they want it all in the past they
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.720]  have they're making it a cause celeb right now about this particular phone
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.120]  just to kind of dumb the debate down to put pressure on Apple but that's kind of
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:37.360]  blown up in the FBI's face here at his market watch FBI boss to Apple backers
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:42.320]  stop saying the world is ending we don't want to break anyone's encryption or
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.800]  set a master key loose on the land yet but what have other agencies of the
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:49.000]  government done and big banks keep you know releasing 30 million so security
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.360]  numbers at a pop it's the big institutions that are full of mercenaries
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:56.080]  and groups you're not telling me then the whole federal government you get
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.720]  thousands of people with access to stuff like this that isn't gonna get sold
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:03.320]  and leaked or that your computers are gonna get broken into by God knows who
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:08.640]  and release come on big corporations are the number one leakers next is the
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:14.080]  federal government and other governments so no you don't need this and but at
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:20.080]  the same time Apple is it should get them into the phone separately they can
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:26.400]  go to the ISP and the cellular provider the day after that they keep that stuff
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:30.280]  for years by law they've got where they went who they called well the web
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.440]  addresses they went to give me a break the whole history's there so the whole
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:38.440]  things are red herring on every front and then Trump kind of walked into it
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.920]  going hey give them the code we're gonna boycott you and it's more than just give
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:48.720]  them the code but I get it some of Apple's encryption gets in the way of
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.680]  the FBI and I'm sure with some of the stuff they're doing the things but
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.760]  overall we're all being spied on and we're less free than ever so folks
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.280]  don't buy it anymore
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:02.640]  Jeb Bush is out of the presidential race the former Florida governor has
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:07.080]  dropped out of the 2016 White House race after losing the South Carolina primary
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:11.120]  badly to billionaire Donald Trump who secured a strong victory with nearly a
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.560]  third of the vote Bush formally launched his campaign back in June about six
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.000]  months after he announced he would run for top office was supported by the
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.920]  right to rise political action committee which had raised in excess a hundred
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.880]  million dollars for his campaign launch but no amount of money could save Bush a
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.760]  dorky candidate who at one point actually beg the audience to please clap
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.960]  for him after his speech it was hilariously thrown off the stage at
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:36.200]  another speech for going over his allotted time people are simply tired
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.640]  establishment candidates who want amnesty for illegals flooding into the
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.840]  country it also didn't help that bush blew off the idea of releasing the
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:46.720]  missing 28 pages from the 9-11 report which were classified not because of
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.200]  national security but because they reveal Saudi Arabia's involvement in the

[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:54.320]  lead them in here and give them a turn is because Kevin Booth my old friend
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:09:01.200]  filmmaker started making a film about marijuana and hemp and then it turned
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:08.760]  into one about Eastern Europe Vladimir Putin both sides of that equation and I
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:12.680]  mean Kevin has been there in the foreign Eastern European countries they
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:17.000]  discovered the Al-Qaeda training camps a lot of his films turn out like this
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.600]  because he just shoots for sometimes five years and then it just turns into
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:24.440]  something completely different you talk about fly on the wall this is it to give
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:27.800]  an example I've started out in two of his films and it ended up not being in a
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.840]  meant the end he's always I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm like I don't care man that's
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.000]  cool the point is is I get the consult on them so this is gonna be pretty
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:42.240]  powerful interview coming up so definitely stay with us for all of that
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:47.240]  we've also got his buddy Ivan joining us a former high-tech startup
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.240]  entrepreneur and political activist working for three years to overthrow the
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:55.560]  mafia regime in Bulgaria and Kevin spent a lot of time over there Kevin and
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:59.680]  hopefully be in studio with us as well we're gonna go to Richard Reeves here in
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:06.000]  just a moment if your stations out there just joined us the big news is Russia
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.480]  has reached a deal with the US according to Reuters to have a Syrian ceasefire on
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:16.240]  February 27th we'll see if that holds up and that's good because the Saudi
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.080]  Arabians have threatened to put tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:25.720]  of ground troops into Syria to battle the Russians there and the Assad regime to
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:29.120]  prop up their al-Qaeda and ISIS forces and Russia has threatened to use
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:33.920]  tactical nuclear weapons after Saudi Arabia last week said we have nukes and
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:38.640]  we'll use them so things are escalating in a big big way finishing up with a
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:45.360]  whole Apple iPhone situation I've studied it I have looked at it in depth
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:50.520]  and it's a red herring the FBI can go to the internet service provider and the
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:55.160]  cellular provider and get the entire history of who they called what websites
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:11:02.760]  they visited and what they did also there are ways to go around the
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.880]  encryption you don't go through it you go around it you don't go through the
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:11.000]  interface that's basically impossible you go around it and the FBI director
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.240]  says hey we don't want the master key that we're not going to turn it loose
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.880]  they're turning this into a fake referendum saying let us into this one
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.880]  terrorist phone to make it look like all encryption is this simple or this
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:27.800]  simple of an issue to sell the idea of a major takeover of more of our rights the
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:30.480]  truth is we've never been more surveilled and we've never been more
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.480]  unsafe we've gone from al-Qaeda being three thousand people to now ISIS being
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.640]  two hundred thousand with our own government funding it and the Justice
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:42.320]  Department blocked the FBI two years ago from stopping the two shooters when
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:46.720]  they were specifically investigating them they have the Justice Department come
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:51.720]  down and say we might indict you for civil rights violations don't investigate
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:59.120]  this mosque don't investigate these two particular people amazing but the Justice
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.400]  Department says their main focus is patriots and Liberty groups even though
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.480]  statistically the crime rates one of the lowest out there and they want to change
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:13.160]  the Patriot Act to say material support for anyone that's anti-government that's
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:19.160]  like Ron Paul but that's where this is going if we let them get there we have
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.000]  to fight now for free speech and stop them getting there not roll over and
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.880]  say oh that's scary I better shut up that will guarantee our enslavement will
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:32.040]  just be like one more third world country that lives in fear you go to a
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.720]  freer country folks will talk about the government they'll talk about issues
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.360]  they'll get on camera you go to third world countries folks are scared you go
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:41.760]  to Spain people are scared not what was a first world nation they banned free
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.800]  speech there last year now Germany's doing it now France is doing it using
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:54.520]  the radical jihadists they brought in as the pretext to take everybody else's
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:13:00.000]  rights so that's coming up as well now getting into the huge election news we're
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.440]  going to Richard Reeves here in about 60 seconds in Nevada with the Republican
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:11.040]  caucuses tomorrow Hillary got 50 plus percent and got all the delegates and
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:16.360]  they're talking about Sanders being out within two weeks see it doesn't matter
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.240]  that he won by 20 points in New Hampshire they just stole that they had
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.000]  Hillary people registering after they voted the Justice Department is in the
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.240]  news today saying that they're gonna make sure that illegal aliens can vote and
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:32.200]  no one checks IDs all across the United States I mean this is the ongoing
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:38.920]  criminal activity of Loretta Lynch who may be our new Supreme Court justice
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:49.120]  so continuing first Massachusetts poll shows Trump with huge lead and Trump is
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:59.040]  at 50% Marco Rubio at 16 Kasek at 13 Carson at 10 and boy they are really
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:07.840]  trying to prop up these people right now they are really trying to prop up
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:15.560]  Marco Rubio wiggle room RNC video highlights Hillary's bare-faced lies
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:21.240]  we're gonna play that clip coming up the next segment delegate count leaving
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:25.960]  Bernie Sanders with steep climb oh the New York Times goes on to admit it
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:29.680]  doesn't matter if he wins Hillary gets the delegates because well that's how
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:35.400]  the Democrats change the rules she's not stealing they change the rules like
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.600]  saying oh child molestations legal now we said so well no it's not I don't care
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.760]  if you say it's legal I don't care of Obama signs an executive order saying the
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:48.440]  border is open it's treason he doesn't have that power thanks to super
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.560]  delegates Hillary might be assured of nominee oh just doesn't matter it's so
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.680]  magic here's an article I mentioned the Obama administration wants to make sure
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:03.880]  non-citizens vote the upcoming election but they just did they just admit it the
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:08.080]  union say there's no split they'll support Hillary Clinton the requiem for
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.160]  the Bush dynasty the fall the Bush dynasty vanity fair that's exactly what
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:18.240]  happened and that's the message here now Reeves is about to be kicked out of
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:20.760]  wherever he is we're gonna Reeves right now Richard Reeves what's happening
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:25.320]  there in Nevada where are you all right Alex we are at Trump International
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:29.320]  Hotel where there's a big event scheduled here for Donald Trump and I heard
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.760]  you earlier talking about the situation with Facebook where they're trying to
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:36.880]  bring in the zombies to be controlled and managed by the globalist Facebook and
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:42.080]  other social media outlets similar to Facebook and you're right I mean Alex
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.440]  they've the new world order the globalists have to be they are apoplectic
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:49.400]  they are in a big hurry because the mainstream press yesterday was
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:54.320]  absolutely going crazy with how do we stop Trump the punditry they're all
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.440]  upset over what's going on that it looks like Trump may now be invincible
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:02.600]  which he really is but look for this we one thing we haven't talked about Alex
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:09.480]  is that Donald Trump and Fox and Roger Ailes are at war they are at war and you
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:13.920]  know that's like last week Donald Trump set up an interview with Joe Scarborough
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:18.120]  MSNBC that was a recorded interview on a Wednesday afternoon that was to be
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:24.120]  played right up next to O'Reilly at 8 p.m. Eastern and that to me signaled buddy
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:28.920]  the war is on so Trump is taking on Fox Trump is taking on the Pope Trump
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:33.720]  Trump is taking on 9-11 truth Trump is taking on the RNC Trump is taking on
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:37.880]  the establishment Trump is taking on all comers he is like King Kong on the
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:42.640]  Empire State Building just swatting off all comers and now look for the New
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:48.040]  World Order to rally all their globalist operation mainstream media outlets to go
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:53.560]  to war against Donald Trump now Richard I know that you're gonna be covering the
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.800]  situation live tomorrow and of course the next day you've done a great job out
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:01.200]  there on the trail what do you make of him coming out for 9-11 truth I mean a
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.160]  lot of people think that that's why Jeb got out quicker because he promised to
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:08.480]  stay in knowing that Trump was gonna keep bringing that up and we were told
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.400]  five months ago by the Trump folks that they were planning to bring that up and
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:15.480]  just watch and Trump said to me I'm not gonna let you down he hasn't let us down
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:18.840]  this was amazing well lots of straws that break the
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:23.040]  camel's back and I think that 9-11 truth thing that you know Donald Trump kept
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.480]  doubling down tripling down etc us getting the news out about asking Jeb
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:32.440]  for the 28 pages you name it all that plus the pressure on the establishment
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:38.080]  GOP to finally decide okay which of our horses are we gonna put all our all our
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:42.760]  money on and that now clearly is the billionaire toy boy Marco Rubio which
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:47.480]  yesterday that's the first time I'd really kind of caught that he's got he's
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:52.080]  inbred with political correctness so I think that is yet another big Achilles
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:56.880]  Hill that I'll ask the info warriors get us the research about the political
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:00.080]  correctness of Marco Rubio because that's a huge Achilles Hill because that's
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:04.040]  part of what all this election is about is we got to stop political correctness
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:08.040]  and we've got to stop so many things that are going on that's how we know
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.800]  Trump's for real everything he's doing is causing irreparable damage to the
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:16.520]  globalist their political correctness of their anti-father figure garbage their
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:21.160]  their their war with Russia garbage their regime change garbage we got a
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.160]  minute and a half Richard we're gonna check him with you on the nightly news
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:27.280]  again this evening seven o'clock but specifically you're there you got your
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:30.520]  to the ground what are the numbers looking like for Donald Trump in Nevada
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:35.080]  well the latest numbers reported are that Donald Trump should win the Cox's
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:39.400]  which you know the South Carolina primary was less than 48 hours away it
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:43.680]  seems like just a second ago and now tomorrow already here come the
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:49.320]  Cox's so everything is accelerating Texas is already early voting I'm sure
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:53.840]  many other states that vote on Super Tuesday March 1st are already early
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.160]  voting so things are starting to really really happen fast and on the
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:01.440]  Democrat side you were talking about Hillary and Bernie and all that we went
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:05.320]  by a venue yesterday as we were leaving South Carolina Greenville South Carolina
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.320]  it looked like a National Geographic scene from Antarctica with all the
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:15.560]  penguins all piled up around a you know a big ice flow that venue was loaded with
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:19.240]  Bernie Sanders supporters so I don't think Bernie's gonna go away I don't
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:23.000]  think Bernie's supporters are gonna go away so New World Order go ahead and
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.960]  install Hillary as the Democrat nominee because I think they're gonna have a big
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:31.000]  revolt with that with those supporters for Bernie they're not gonna lock step
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.240]  go in for Hillary in a general election they are not they're gonna split they're
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.320]  gonna stay home they're gonna go independent they're gonna go Trump so
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.800]  go ahead New World Order put Hillary up there because the Hillary Clinton ship
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:47.200]  hit an iceberg in late December early January she hit the info warrior ice
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:54.480]  bird absolutely that's what the Democrats tried to flusher but she's holding on with blackmail Richard Reeves reporting from Nevada on the Nevada

[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:33.680]  truth I've always tried to always always some people are gonna call that wiggle
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:38.240]  room that you just gave yourself always always tried you know you're asking me
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:43.640]  to say have I ever I don't believe I ever have I don't believe I ever have I
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.040]  don't believe I ever will I'm gonna do the best I can to level with the American
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.760]  people I try not to tell lies Leanne McAdoo with info wars.com let me level
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:57.080]  with you America here's just a small sampling of Hillary's whoppers there's
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:01.200]  the Benghazi hearing using a secret private server to hide her activities
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:05.240]  lying about not sharing classified information on that secret server I
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:09.320]  remember landing under sniper fire there was supposed to be some kind of a
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:13.000]  greeting ceremony at the airport but instead we just ran with our heads down
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.560]  to get into the vehicles problem is that's not what happened and we should
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:22.320]  know CBS News accompanied the first lady and daughter Chelsea on that Bosnia
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:26.520]  trip that senator Clinton talking to me on the military flight into Tuzla and
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:29.800]  these are the pictures we recorded of the greeting ceremony when the plane
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:35.920]  landed I remember landing under sniper fire there was no greeting ceremony to
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:40.800]  turkey whitewater Watergate defending a rapist threatening all of Bill's
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:45.360]  bimbos in an effort to keep them quiet then claiming to run a campaign for
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:51.640]  women I really just want everybody to take a deep breath and relax and just
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:56.920]  you know sit back because here they come again we're going to have to just ride
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.280]  through this as we have you know the vast right-wing conspiracy that you're
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.120]  a criminal that's just part of a detailed report up on info wars.com by
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:08.160]  Liam McAdoo I suggest you go see it forward to your friends and family
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:12.000]  especially liberal Democrats that think this lady's good because I really thought
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.440]  about it I think Bernie Sanders is better than her and he's bad news I mean
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.320]  this lady is just a complete monster but continuing the reason I want to play
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:24.360]  part of McAdoo's report I try not to lie is the name of that report is because
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:30.240]  the RNC has put out this video called Wiggle Room it's 42 seconds long on the
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:35.240]  lies of Hillary also an effective tool here it is. Jimmy Carter famously said
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.960]  I will not lie to you he got elected because he made one promise to the
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:44.200]  American people let's go back to 1976 I'll never tell a lie I'll never make a
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:47.560]  misleading statement you talk about leveling with the American people have
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:53.960]  you always told the truth I did not email any classified material to anyone on
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:58.960]  my email I've always tried to the video circulating on the internet that has
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:05.040]  led to these protests I've always tried to I did not send classified material I've
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:09.400]  always tried to what difference at this point does it make some people are
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:18.320]  going to call that Wiggle Room. There you go and and really this is a
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:22.960]  referendum on Americans rejecting the Republican establishment in the Bushes
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:28.920]  rejecting the Clintons I mean how much baloney how much bull are we going to
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:32.280]  take and the public's caught on the point where they're not going to take
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:37.960]  any more of it the problem is that geopolitically our elite is starting
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:43.360]  wars with China starting wars with Russia starting wars in the Middle East and
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.720]  has just gone collectively insane does that mean the communist Chinese are
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:50.920]  good they're horrible does that mean the Russians don't have a bunch of problems
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:55.440]  they got a lot of bad stuff it doesn't matter our elite is sitting on top of us
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:01.840]  taking our freedoms and then trying to get us into larger conflicts as
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:08.440]  political distractions for what they're doing here at home and they're gearing
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:12.120]  up in every way they can to take basic American freedoms we're gonna go to break
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:19.280]  and come back with Kevin Booth and two of the subjects of his new film that
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:24.040]  doesn't up that I don't think even has a working title yet and so we're gonna be
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:29.120]  going inside Eastern Europe inside the United States with what's happening with
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:33.400]  the drug war this thing is so multifaceted but I find it interesting
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:37.760]  that George Soros has been pushing for marijuana decriminalization which I
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.320]  support because I'm against the police state and the drug war but that it's
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:46.040]  also then connected in to political operations in Eastern Europe and the
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:49.720]  whole fight against who will control those former satellites of the Soviet
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:54.400]  Union so it gets very opaque when you really break it all down but we're gonna
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:58.520]  try to drill in to it with folks with different angles and different
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.720]  perspectives straight ahead please don't forget that if you want to stay in

[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:56.360]  network
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:02.440]  Putin has reportedly threatened to launch tactical nukes at Turkey if the ISIS
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:06.200]  supporting country invades Syria with Saudi Arabia the Russians have about 20
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:09.720]  thousand troops in Syria helping the Syrian government fight ISIS and Putin
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.840]  warned the Turkish president that Moscow's prepared to use tactical
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:17.280]  nuclear weapons to protect its troops if Turkey attacks since Turkey is part of
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:21.320]  NATO any such conflict could quickly escalate until full-scale nuclear
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:25.200]  confrontation said award-winning Iran contra journals Robert Perry who's
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:28.920]  tipped off about the warning Moscow's apparent threat to repel a Turkish
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:32.400]  invasion of Syria with nukes follows a warning by the Russian Prime Minister
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:36.480]  that another world war will erupt if the US and its allies send ground troops
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:41.080]  into Syria and if Syria falls Russia will be geopolitically isolated from the
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:44.720]  rest of the world which is exactly what the globalists want so they can easily
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:48.600]  hijack and control the country and further adding to the threat of world

[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:20.520]  Libya to Turkey it is a big idea a new world order how is it that this
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:25.080]  organization is so well funded so organized. Lamek state linked militants
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:30.080]  have gained a stronger foothold in Libya seizing new economically vital areas of
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:35.880]  country. The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel Hakim Belhaj and
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:41.160]  of course he was on to the teeth by NATO. A world in which there is the very real
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:45.000]  prospect of a new world order. The Russians say they're negotiating with
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.640]  North Korea to hold joint military exercise Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:54.680]  teaming up creating an ominous alliance against the United States. Israel's
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:58.560]  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:02.760]  that the US government is negotiating with Iran. Saudi Arabia is apparently
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:07.440]  prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks on Iran. We
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:12.840]  have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order. I set up a
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:18.960]  foundation in Ukraine and created an important part in events now. Ukraine is
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:22.880]  set to receive the first tranche of international monetary fund aid package
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:29.040]  but we had broker the deal to transition power in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin is on
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:36.280]  the move. Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:42.560]  measure of the opportunities presented by this new and involving world order.
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:35:05.440]  Ladies and gentlemen we're live broadcasting worldwide. I'm your host
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:08.520]  Alex Jones. Now we've got a whole building full of guests today. We've got
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:11.720]  another guest coming in to join us as well or at least from the control room
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:17.120]  in the next hour. We've also got Kevin Booth one of my you know good friends
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:22.640]  known Kevin for for 21 years Kevin. Kevin was there when I decided to change
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:30.080]  over from being Bill Hicks. That's the that's the ongoing joke. There's so
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:32.600]  many of those videos. Kevin you were trying to explain this to me about a
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:35.640]  year ago and then when you came to visit for Christmas and we're over at the
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:38.480]  house with a family because you are family. I spent a lot of Christmas with
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:42.040]  your mom and dad where they passed but you and your wife Trey were back in
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:47.320]  town from Hollywood and you were trying to explain this to me and I got it but
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:51.120]  it was so amazingly complex. I said this is gonna be a great film and for folks
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:53.880]  that don't know Kevin Booth is he's made a lot of big films written some best
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:58.320]  selling books. It's also Bill Hicks is producer before he died and has made a
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:01.800]  lot of serious documentaries like American drug war one and two and a lot
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.480]  of times he sets out to make a film about one thing. He started out making
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:09.560]  American drug war about alcoholism and his parents who I've had a few drinks
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:13.720]  with. God rest her souls great people and then it turned into a drug war film
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:18.600]  because he was exposing that. So you talk about a true fly on the wall that's
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:23.040]  kind of how you do it and it's almost 65 years to make a film so why don't you
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:27.600]  introduce Big Mike to everybody tell us who he is his background and then you
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:31.760]  kind of take over this segment because where do we begin with the guy with the
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:37.680]  biggest hemp and marijuana growing factory system and a nutrient
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:43.040]  system in the world and can tell us about multinational connections and or how
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:48.240]  you got into Eastern European elections and the Russians and then you guys
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:52.480]  found Al-Qaeda training camps. Are you told me this a year ago now that's
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:56.040]  actually in the news. So wild stuff that you've discovered I've seen some of the
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:59.720]  footage Kevin and it's something out of a James Bond movie I mean really scary
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.840]  this is not stuff you see on the discovery channel or history channel or
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:07.200]  even vice so I can't wait to see the film and I just want to say don't take
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:11.200]  another three years to put it out just hurry up and do it so so that's my rant
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:13.960]  thanks for coming in guys I guess you guys flew in on your private jet Big Mike
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:18.320]  and tell us specifically where we should start this story Kevin. Well I'd like to
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.760]  start with just introducing a Big Mike and we've known each other for many
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:25.640]  years he's actually helped with financing some of my other projects in the
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:30.920]  past and I was coming to him to work on another marijuana documentary
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:35.680]  and he said I've got this other thing that I want to point you towards in the
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:40.000]  meantime and it's Bulgaria and of course my response was you know I thought
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.920]  he was out of his mind. Next thing you know it I'm in Bulgaria and it's the
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:48.160]  weirdest place on earth and I'm just going to give the mic over to Big Mike
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:52.640]  here to tell the story but basically you know he has a company Advanced
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:56.560]  Nutrients is the biggest company on the globe that makes it they don't make
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:00.000]  marijuana they make everything you need to grow the finest cleanest cannabis
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.800]  there is you know a working to make it a clean safe medicine. Mike moved a
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:09.160]  research section of his company there and that's when he fell into all these
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:14.680]  things. Right so I heard the Bulgarian Academy of Science was laying off some
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:19.320]  really bright scientists so I said let's go over there and give a go see what's
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.880]  going on there. Did you have a previous connection to Bulgaria? No no and so when
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:30.920]  over there we were also able to obtain a license to legally research cannabis
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:35.160]  there and we had it for the last nine years we're allowed to keep one kilo of
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:39.280]  a product for research purposes all the rest we have to burn and destroy there's
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.280]  cameras in there go straight to the police stations the whole bed and so
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:48.480]  because of that and I'm involved there and I'm going there one Christmas I said
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:53.240]  I want to donate some money and help these people and they said we can't do
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:56.920]  that I go well why they go well there's no charity you know wait wait hang on
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:01.160]  this is three years ago this isn't like you know 20 30 years ago there's no
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:04.920]  charity where I can donate money and feed people they go no I go okay we're
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:08.920]  gonna start one and they looked at me like I was out of my mind like out of
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:11.600]  my mind they said you can't do that here you don't understand this is Bulgaria
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:17.120]  you're wasting your time don't bother doing it we're different of course I'm
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:22.760]  American and so I we just don't roll that way do we and I just said no we're
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:27.760]  going to do it so from the inception to the last family that was fed was
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:31.880]  exactly three weeks 21 days they were like how'd you get it done so fast as a
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:36.200]  little to set our minds to it and we got it done now it's a big charity there we
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:40.160]  have celebrities we just last Christmas we got done feeding 26,000
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:45.480]  needy Bulgarians and so I was wondering like how the hell do I get all this
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:49.520]  resistance like what's happening here why is everyone like this and why is
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:53.560]  their mindset the way it is and I started peeling back the layers of the
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:59.640]  onion and lo and behold there was this corrupt government that was just out of
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:05.640]  control stealing billions of dollars from the people with no foreign policy and
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:10.480]  as I started digging deeper and deeper I saw there's a Putin connection you have
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:15.800]  Russia literally here this people have first of all people have to understand
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:22.600]  Bulgaria is an EU country and a member of NATO and here the top officials are
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:28.560]  taking bribes directly from Russia from Putin against the interests of the West
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:33.800]  if you say I'm an EU country if you say you're with me NATO then you're with the
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:38.760]  West and clearly that hasn't happened there and you have all this money coming
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:44.280]  in from Russia swaying the opinions of what has to go on and these same leaders
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:50.320]  turns out they have a big cigarette tax scam going and they're giving money to
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:56.240]  ISIS and now we have very good information that there's an ISIS training
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:01.640]  camp in the mountains of Bulgaria no one is paying attention now now are the
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:05.160]  Russians connected to the ice just to give a little bit of a historical
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:08.040]  background it's people need to know because a lot of people don't know the
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:13.440]  history of Bulgaria that that during World War two you've shown me we can
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:16.920]  visit the Christmas a lot of footage right at my house yeah I mean it is
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:21.600]  amazing the stuff you've got I mean it makes stuff like out of Mexico and
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:25.200]  their drug war stuff look I mean it's just it's like a Twilight Zone episode
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:30.040]  well people need to understand that that Bulgaria state they had a German king
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:33.120]  during World War two because of that the Nazis didn't invade but then what
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:36.840]  happened was when Germany lost the war the Russians basically claimed it as
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:41.040]  their own and so Bulgaria became the People's Republic of Bulgaria for 45
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:47.280]  years so Russia basically the Soviet Union controlled Bulgaria for 45 solid
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:50.640]  years so you have all these people when you go there now it's like rats living
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:53.640]  in a maze but the maze has been picked up but they don't know that the maze has
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:56.680]  been picked up and so that's a great allegory yeah so the basically you
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:59.640]  invent that one that's really good so well I did now I'm gonna trademark that
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:04.040]  rule but the point is that we bring your wife in here too
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:15.960]  at a certain point so basically what happened when it was when communism fell
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:22.600]  the KGB put mafia their their mafia in place of the government and so you had
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:26.240]  a better call it a stay-behind network yeah basically and that and so that's the
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:31.040]  government that's really still there today and and the people there have the
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:33.680]  mindset of that they're still living under communism in fact a lot of the
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.960]  old people still look at communism as the good old days because at least they
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:39.680]  didn't have to worry about a roof over their head well here's my issue when
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:42.240]  you were first a few years ago talking to big Mike and stuff and I looked up big
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:45.360]  Mike as I'm not an expert on him but things like wow this guy is the kingpin
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:48.840]  of you know all these high-quality products for folks and you know is
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:51.800]  trying to help a lot of charities around the world Africa you name it and I'm
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:54.920]  all for decriminalization who has a lot of great uses but I'm not in the total
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:57.880]  camp where it's the Messiah and it's God and let's give it to kids or whatever
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.680]  because you know some people in their mom's basement of course they'll be in
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:03.520]  their mom's basement anyways police are gonna be stoned I guess so I guess we
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:07.320]  already have the proclivity to be a bomb like Bernie Sanders who didn't work to
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:11.520]  leave us 40 and probably smoked a lot of pot by looking at him that you'll
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:14.560]  really be in your mom's basement just deeper in there the bag of Cheetos but
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:19.200]  I'm gonna stop right there I know Russia is incredibly corrupt I know it's got
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:24.920]  mafia's it uses basically as an arm of the FSB former KGB that's how it works
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:30.120]  at the same time I know our government runs more narcotics than Russia does
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:34.800]  and pays everybody off as well and so my issue is the Russians aren't in
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:40.640]  Mexico trying to manipulate foreign policy through that we are there in
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:46.160]  Eastern Europe yeah which I get it's it's it's a vacuum but George Soros the
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:53.520]  weirdo Nazi collaborator showing up is not the liberator and so my problem is
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:57.160]  I just see the West and the East want to make money off conflict and wars in the
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:00.480]  areas but you've lived there you've worked there you've been there a bunch I
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:06.040]  will defer to you guys Kevin a big Mike what who do you think the bad guys
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:15.040]  really are in this Putin thousand percent is the Russians like before the
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:22.800]  World War two Bulgaria was the third wealthiest nation in Europe it was one
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:26.560]  of the major banking centers they were wildly successful then communism came
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:31.440]  for 50 years followed by 25 more years of so-called democracy but it was the
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:37.560]  same guys using the same techniques and ideology and and now we are in this
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:45.320]  situation that we're in so and and Russia has this huge huge influence over
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:51.440]  them and yet they're in EU country they're in NATO country you know we need
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:54.400]  to do something about that we need to get in there and we need to stop it now
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:57.360]  because we're gonna have another Afghanistan you agree with George
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:02.960]  Soros look I'm not a politician not a political person like you're
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:07.160]  appending on that I'm just a business guy no no no something wrong I get it you
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:11.680]  you just have a business you just tell it like you see it and I agree with your
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:16.080]  perspective from your perspective what I'm saying here is you're certainly in
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:19.280]  the business you're involved in aware of what Soros is up to have you ever met
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:23.080]  Soros no never have it's okay we had no I I wouldn't care if I didn't my
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:27.160]  visors buddies with him I still have him on sure sure it was involved in the
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:31.600]  legalization process of cannabis early on so far I haven't seen his name thrown
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:36.000]  around anyway why do you think he was I have no idea but I'm glad somebody did
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.200]  I'm glad there was three billionaires actually they got together and really
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:43.800]  started pushing this and now the marijuana soros gonna open the door up for
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:48.200]  you well yeah they like they open the door for the for cannabis yeah in the
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:56.080]  country like as far as I'm concerned hell Mary you say hell no I don't care
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:01.160]  about that what I care about is the outcome in the end result and that is
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:05.680]  medical marijuana becomes available to the people of America as well as
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:10.520]  legalization for recreational use I want to see both that we're just wasting
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:14.640]  our time we're wasting our money our resources I mean we have an industrial
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:17.920]  prison complex that you're well aware of you know I've heard you talk about that
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:22.400]  I agree about that we do have that and they needed to fill the jails well now
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:28.360]  that cannabis is now medical cannabis that's changing I've talked to people
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:31.880]  in the prison complex and they said they're letting the marijuana people
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:35.040]  out and they're bringing real criminals in sure what do you think of Obama
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:39.320]  because one thing I was hoping with him is I am pretty criminalization and then
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:43.480]  all these states legalized it for medical use we don't want to have you know
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:46.080]  people that smoke pot in prison and it does have a lot of you know medical
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:50.440]  uses that's admitted it's really a miracle drug medicine as Kevin was saying
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:53.960]  but I don't think that's debatable and then it just seems like I've seen more
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:57.800]  federal raids more federal harassment have you in the last eight years under
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:01.400]  Obama experienced more or less pressure because you're just trying to supply
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:05.440]  folks for industrial hemp no THC or for the other I mean you should be allowed
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:09.400]  to sell the lights and the equipment and the nutrients for the plants yeah we
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:16.560]  sell the new the electrolytes plants crave so so no like in the beginning a
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:19.840]  long time ago there was a lot of pressure it's becoming less and less and
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:25.640]  less pressure now there are instances where they're using like they went up
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:28.720]  to Northern California just recently and they busted a bunch of people over
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:34.160]  water rights right I mean what I look at is the government the DEA they're in
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:37.520]  their death throws they know that this thing is coming to an end and it's
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:41.720]  coming very very right so they're moving into other rackets well yeah I
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:44.960]  apparently saw and I'm glad they're out of ours and they need to stay out and
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:48.560]  they need people and should allow people to heal themselves with you know
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:52.320]  that's what happened on record they made alcohol illegal for 10 years rare it
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.400]  crippled the size of organized crime corrupted the police and when that
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:58.360]  ended they had to have something you know they actually said we've got to make
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:01.960]  marijuana illegal no one knew what it was it's only smoked you know the
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:05.520]  Southwest and stuff and so they were able to get it illegal by making reefer
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:09.320]  madness where you smoke pot murder everybody it's the opposite you know
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:13.520]  that's that's all off it does that folks and then they were able to ban it so
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:17.880]  they had something new to sell and then once it was banned then the police
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:21.600]  departments and others in the big cities rolled it out to the public right
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.960]  well you can think you know Dupont for that in 1937 they hired some lobbyists
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:29.320]  and got the laws changed before that it was legal and why did Dupont do that
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:33.160]  they want to shut down him well no yeah exactly exactly because they want to
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:36.200]  shut down help because they don't have a chemical to break it down but they had a
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:40.840]  chemical called sulfuric acid that was great for cotton and so they said hey
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:45.520]  the cotton industry's got that was another anglerish right and help you know
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:48.320]  we're gonna put that to the wayside that's in fact you just get another part
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:52.480]  of the equation yeah exactly Dupont came in and others and said we don't like
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:55.680]  him if you can grow it anywhere it's better than cotton the Constitution's
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:59.320]  written on hemp paper that's correct you know what I love is these brainwashed
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:04.240]  people that go I can't believe you're in this peddling marijuana now Alex I saw
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:08.400]  in your magazine you know advertisements to decriminalize marijuana in Texas I
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:13.000]  can't believe it even even some distant family we're ashamed of you and I'm like
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:19.960]  do you understand that this was an ad for hemp that has no THC and all of our
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:24.400]  rope and sails and clothes was made out of it because it's superior to cotton do
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:28.880]  you understand that I just don't like a pothead in the family and that you just
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:32.200]  can't get through to them well I think something to bring up too is the fact
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:36.760]  that the that the our own Department of Health took out a patent or got the
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:42.200]  patent for cannabinoids and 2003 so that's a pretty interesting thing so
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:47.320]  while the FDA is putting out press releases saying that marijuana has no
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:52.480]  medicinal benefits our own Department of Health is basically trying to patent
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:56.400]  marijuana for its medicinal benefits and they have marinal which is what
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:00.800]  doesn't work a synthetic version of THC which is a category three drug
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:06.120]  where out marijuana the whole plant is a category one along with heroin LSD and
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:10.320]  cocaine right the pharmaceutical companies want to have the little kids I
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:14.520]  run into are on some form of speed and you look at the molecule it's like
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:18.600]  methamphetamine oh it is yeah oh yeah it's an epidemic in this country it's a
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:22.480]  huge epidemic okay yeah let's put the kids on methamphetamine that makes their
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:26.000]  hearts expand shrinks their brain literally but marijuana throw the book
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.600]  at them yeah that's the way it is yeah big Mike when we come back and I want to

[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.960]  afford it he wasn't a rich man by any means at less than $107 per month

[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:29.520]  Kelly Lazar Jack did I say it right is in here with Big Mike and Big Mike was
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:31.680]  just telling me during the break the reasoning he also knows what's happening
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:35.280]  with Russia and Eastern Europe is you yourself you're saying I have an Estonian
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:39.360]  background yes my mother was Estonia my father was Latvia and all my life I grew
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:44.480]  up hearing the tears of communism you know and what rush what Russia did I can
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:49.600]  remember asking my father yeah you know will we ever be able to go back to our
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:53.120]  our countries and and see what's going on I'd love to be able to see like where
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.040]  you grew up and went to school and all that stuff he goes son you'll probably
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:03.560]  never he goes you might see it in your lifetime if you're lucky he didn't see
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:06.800]  he died before that happened I get tears in your eyes oh yeah yeah it's this like
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:11.440]  it's emotional right so I have a bunch of relatives Estonia the wall comes down
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:16.240]  we go to get reunited if you can imagine my mother's in separate for 54 years right
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:23.760]  from her family now we're yeah we're reunited and I see what what it looks
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:28.880]  like and then I kept going back and it got better and better and better and
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:33.320]  now Estonia is a great country you know good infrastructure things work
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:38.400]  properly and I'm in Bulgaria so for you your your pro-west pro-eu that they
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:42.440]  may not be perfect but you see countries under Russia still go to hell well in
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:47.160]  this case why did Estonia move themselves to greatness and Bulgaria
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:51.320]  didn't and then when I dug down it was because of the mindset it was because
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:55.800]  the leaders it was because of just horrible horrible corruption and just
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:59.600]  psychological abuse to the people of Bulgaria and that's that's what they're
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:04.760]  doing they're using the same exact mind control techniques that they used in
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:09.560]  communism today in a demacro a democratic society and the people haven't
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:12.840]  realized the analogy that you gave is perfect they don't realize they're free
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:16.120]  it's like the elephant has got the chain when they're a baby they chain him down
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:19.920]  he realizes he can't lift his foot up when he's an adult they just put the
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:23.320]  chain around him and he doesn't try to move because he thinks he can't same
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:27.440]  thing but the West is involved I mean we're I mean we're not saying the West
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:30.840]  isn't involved in Bulgaria we've had times where we're trying to bring to the
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:34.580]  attention about ISIS to the the American Embassy over there the American
[01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:39.280]  Embassy refuses to talk to us in Bulgaria and so there's definitely I
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:43.080]  mean John Kerry's been coming over there doing energy deals so there's there's a
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:47.520]  lot I mean we're not saying the West isn't like coming to Bulgaria well sure
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:49.920]  I mean look at Ukraine I mean the Russians have been horrible things
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:53.120]  especially the Soviet Union to Ukraine but the Nazis did bad stuff as well I
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.680]  mean it's all just a circus and then you've got Joe Biden's son coming in
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:00.960]  and getting the energy deal for all the gas in the country yeah I mean it just
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:05.400]  sounds like it sounds like we're getting more corrupt and and and then Russia
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:08.720]  basically is the way it's always been or what's the word there is Russia worse
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:13.720]  than it used to be or is it better or the same look Russia's there like we have
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:17.920]  our interests they have their interests clearly though you're a member of the
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:22.800]  EU you're a member of NATO you back you back the West that's what they wanted we
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:31.040]  have a military base there an Air Force base in Bulgaria and like you need to
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:35.440]  back the house and the house is the West and and they're not doing that they
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:42.720]  have let's give you an instance so America has something called Chabruka
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:48.640]  and that is our pipeline that we want to put through there Russia has South
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:53.200]  Stream they want to put that through Shell wants to go off the Black Sea and
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:58.200]  drill for oil and now that's being blocked so what does Russia do they hire
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:05.280]  a PR company in Bulgaria gave them $20 million to go and say hey this is bad
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:09.880]  we don't want this you know all the things so there's this fight between
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:14.160]  Westinghouse is there wanting to build a nuclear power plant no we don't want that
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:19.440]  what then and then well okay but however you would then have Russia wanting to
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:22.840]  build a nuclear power plant that's even worse that's right like like who are you
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:27.040]  gonna trust more like I trust us way more than I trust Russia and you sure
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:31.480]  don't want to talk yo electric be sure to build on a fault line though in a

[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:48.600]  want to talk about all this but what is it like for your girlfriend I know she's
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:53.000]  seen a lot of this Kelly just as an observer you know to this you're saying
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.320]  you're not really political what do you take away from the whole state of the
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:59.400]  world and what's happening with the drug war and what's happening in eastern
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:05.360]  Europe and all of it I it's you can talk about your time when you're in
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:11.360]  Bulgaria just now very emotional very emotional I didn't know how I was gonna
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:16.560]  take it you know I got there the first couple of days and I kind of freaked out
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:21.600]  was really emotional I've been with a security team before yeah so it was it
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:29.040]  was really different but once I kind of got you know was able to grasp that just
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:33.880]  the more we were out in the cities and you know we went out and we you know did
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:38.640]  our charity and everything my emotions just kind of took over me just seeing
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:43.840]  how the country is and how the people are and very heavy on my heart you know
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:48.280]  and I would imagine both you've traveled a lot of countries before starting to
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:52.440]  yeah I mean yes yes would you say Bulgaria is one of the worst all
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:57.520]  places you've seen big Mike yeah yeah yeah absolutely I mean I was in India
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:01:59.960]  I had an officer for seven years and when you go back to Bulgaria you go well
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:04.280]  it's a little bit better right but I mean it's bad of all the EU countries in
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:10.480]  Europe it's by far the worst the worst Wow Kevin the Russians I mean one of
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:13.520]  the first things I noticed when I first flew into Bulgaria that was an
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:17.960]  expecting is just the view of thousands of these Russian-looking tenement
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:21.240]  buildings and and so you picture this place that was once as beautiful
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:26.760]  European nation and I think it was just all in the 80s that they built just all
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:32.240]  these these concrete ghettos and now all the people are forced to live in them
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:35.480]  I mean these you'll see a lot of these buildings have windows they have like
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:39.640]  yeah class yeah these people live in Cuba well I mean Bernie Sanders once
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:43.760]  communism I mean that's a wonderland where all the 40-year-old bombs can live
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:48.840]  imagine a nation run by 40-year-old bombs I got a step like like clearly
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:53.920]  communism doesn't work look at the Russian economy it's 1.8 trillion
[02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:59.920]  versus the American economy which is almost 15 trillion 1.8 trillion versus
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:04.040]  15 trillion clearly like people say bad things about capitalism and all this
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:08.720]  because they become lazy butch because it you're right our poor are richer than
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:11.920]  most people around the world and so they see the people with wealth and then
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:16.480]  it's class envy they're mad that there's a bunch of wealth they don't have that's
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:20.520]  the problem with and communism creates dependency but also creates the little
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:25.360]  commas are managers the political police who then you don't excel because you
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:29.360]  write the best player come with the best product you excel because you're in
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:32.640]  charge and somebody's got to come kiss your butt to save me in the movies like
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:35.840]  that film based on a true story the lives of others about East Germany do you
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:43.480]  see that film no I didn't well folks ought to watch it I see it Kevin

[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:58.320]  into the state of the world right now and speaking of Russia you're asking me
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:01.640]  about World War and stuff and is it true you know this country has nooks in that
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:05.480]  country has nooks I was always told where Saudi Arabia got their nooks
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:10.000]  where Iran got their nooks and now that's coming out in the news and I was
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.520]  told this by high-level military people and back then they're like you know
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:15.680]  you're wrong saying Iran didn't gonna get a nuke with those reactors they
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:20.200]  already got them and then by the 3rd or 4th general that told me that and then
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:24.000]  family told me that or I was telling family and they said how do you know
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.680]  that and I said well I was told this my son he was yeah that's right and and
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:32.960]  that's their biggest fear is that I ran and that Saudi Arabia are gonna get a
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:35.920]  nuclear war well now that's in the news this week when we come back with big

[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:07.600]  out of the 2016 White House race after losing the South Carolina primary badly
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:11.440]  to billionaire Donald Trump who secured a strong victory with nearly a third of
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:15.160]  the vote Bush formally launches campaign back in June about six months after he
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:18.600]  announced he would run for top office was supported by the right to rise
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:22.120]  political action committee which had raised in excess a hundred million
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:25.760]  dollars for his campaign launch but no amount of money could save Bush a
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:30.040]  dorky candidate that one point actually beg the audience to please clap for him
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:33.440]  after his speech it was hilariously thrown off the stage at another speech
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:36.920]  for going over his allotted time people are simply tired establishment
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:40.640]  candidates who want amnesty for illegals flooding into the country it also didn't
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:44.120]  help that bush blew off the idea of releasing the missing 28 pages from the
[02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:48.080]  9-11 report which were classified not because of national security but because
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:51.720]  they reveal Saudi Arabia's involvement in the attacks for more election news

[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:40.280]  she's been traveling around with the guys checking all this out I want to
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:44.560]  play a three-minute clip a kind of a trailer working title and Kevin was
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:49.200]  here around Christmas he didn't have it yet Ghost Nation and so we have Big Mike
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:54.920]  the biggest producer of basically marijuana and hemp fertilizer in the
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:58.400]  world and he's been the most successful because I guess from the reviews out
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:04.000]  there he's got the best response and folks again to all the people out there
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:08.760]  that say I can't believe on your show you're promoting Mary Warner it's all a
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:14.440]  psyop ladies and gentlemen it decriminalized it it takes the money out of it it takes
[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:18.400]  the crime out of it this is simply someone multinationally selling
[02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:21.360]  fertilizer for plants and I would imagine your fertilizer works on other
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:25.280]  plants too doesn't it oh it does is it's funny we have lettuce growers they use
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:29.960]  our organic products to grow organic lettuce the guys are breaking world
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:34.920]  records we have the records growing for the biggest was the biggest tomato 8
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:39.480]  pounds the biggest watermelon 309 longest gourd the records just stacking up
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:42.800]  so these there's these guys who grow on it and they want you know the they can
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:45.520]  grow the biggest plant of whatever they use advanced nutrients and just
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:50.160]  smashing records have stood for 20 years what about competing against GMO like
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:55.320]  like well first of all I'm not a fan of GMO at all like what Monsanto has done
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:10:01.600]  to the American farmer is criminal they do not allow in a lot of EU countries
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:07.840]  them to do what they've done to the American farmer Monsanto is an evil
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:13.120]  company if you look at their passported directors it's a who's who in government
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:16.600]  they don't like a law give us going and change it and they're gonna try to come
[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:22.680]  into our space and they're you know they're gonna make a run at it and we
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:25.960]  have to be really really careful do we really want most Monsanto in there
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:32.000]  making franken plants that people are consuming as medicine God only knows
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  what they'll do look at they do with roundup now we got superweeds they
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.720]  actually leave the pharmacological crop market where they have plants actually
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:42.680]  producing chemicals and producing quote drugs and then it can jump into other
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:46.680]  plant species that's just crazy and you know where they're doing it because I
[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:51.800]  got a call once I just said I declined but they they're underground they're
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:57.200]  literally underground in places in warehouses that are non-descript and
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:01.560]  they're doing this genetic Frankenstein plants where they're they're taking
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:05.720]  genes you know from different animals and they're just totally knows what
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:09.600]  they're doing now that's in the medical literature now but but but not
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:13.120]  generally known but here you are as an insider just in that you're an industrial
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:17.800]  you know a producer of organic products to help grow plants and so you're
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:21.000]  actually getting contacted that's where this is going on effect right here in
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:26.000]  Austin they have when you say underground non-descript warehouses all over
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.240]  that even have front offices and everything but you go in it goes through
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:34.480]  a bio seal you name it it's about level three containment and they've got
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:38.800]  pharmacological crops growing in there right now because plants can produce
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:43.480]  anything in fact they engineered protogen about 12 years ago engineered HIV
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:48.440]  that grew in corn corn's the best plant for growing pharmacological crops you
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:52.280]  program and it grows it inside of it and it was an attenuated virus was the
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:56.840]  word they had guys in spacesuits up by Waco they were growing the stuff
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:12:02.680]  outdoors they had guys in spacesuits there with flamethrowers knocking it out
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:05.320]  and then I reported people didn't believe it even though it was in the
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:10.640]  Associated Press guys in spacesuits with flamethrowers what I will say is
[02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:15.840]  Monsanto had we took we test on other also other crops as well we we are our
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:20.680]  test spot was right next to Monsanto's in Bulgaria and the Monsanto scientists
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:26.560]  came over to our scientists and go how did you grow corn like that and we of
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:29.520]  course they didn't say anything and we actually swapped here you take a few of
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:34.560]  our ears we'll take a few of yours we tested we had 14% more protein in our
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:40.400]  corn of the biofuel with a yield of another 30% higher so I'm like a little
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:44.240]  company called advanced nutrients 50 million dollar your company up against
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:50.160]  this multi-billion dollar giant and we kicked their we kicked her butts like I'm
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:55.160]  happy I'm proud of that I mean it's kind of cool Kevin again your film
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:13:00.480]  sometimes takes six seven years to make how long until this this new film
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:08.480]  Ghost Nation comes up I mean we're hoping to be in festivals by July and then
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:11.680]  after that a cable network will buy it or you already under contract yeah no

[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:29.920]  type of thing well I'm really happy for your success because your films have all
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:33.400]  been really successful and it you know it's good to see you just over the
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:38.480]  decades you're continuing to put out such great research introduce this clip
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:42.440]  we're about to play for folks this is just a trailer that we just finished
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:47.600]  cutting and I don't know hopefully it's self-explanatory and right now so this
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:52.080]  is working title ghost nation that's nice let's go ahead and roll it
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:59.120]  the corruption in Bulgaria is the reason that we are so poor
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:11.000]  the politicians were trying to make us be invisible all the media were saying
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:15.760]  there are three hundred to five hundred people while they were thousand I mean
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:22.120]  tens of thousands I'll tell my kids to tell you if something happens to me
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:31.600]  we don't have capitalism and democracy we have the math
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:15:01.320]  that's just guy home your kneesassen i'll be there come in
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:05.320]  There is a strong bet coming from Russia.
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:17.320]  Also, we should not forget about ISIS.
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:21.320]  Only one country is between ISIS and Bulgaria. It's Turkey.
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:24.320]  To stop the flow of terrorists.
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:27.320]  Maybe we are doing this, but we must do more.
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:30.320]  Who is killing? Who is attacking? Who is assaulting?
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:34.320]  Without any reason. Or with any reason. It doesn't matter.
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:41.320]  The threat of direct terror attack is so strong in Bulgaria.
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:50.320]  And what they did was, as soon as they started attack,
[02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:54.320]  they started to spread their videos over the internet
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:57.320]  and started to spread propaganda.
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:02.320]  For you, out of Paris, France, several people have been killed.
[02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:05.320]  A shooting in central Paris.
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:09.320]  I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:12.320]  coming across the Mexican border in Texas.
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:14.320]  The war is over.
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:16.320]  The war is over.
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:18.320]  The war is over.
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:20.320]  The war is over.
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:22.320]  The war is over.
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:24.320]  We are coming to the state of America.
[02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:26.320]  We are coming.
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:28.320]  We are coming.
[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:30.320]  We are coming.
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:32.320]  We are coming.
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:34.320]  We are coming.
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:37.320]  I don't know if I will breathe, but I'm very angry.
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:40.320]  I will become more and more angry.
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:41.320]  No, they don't.
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:43.320]  No, they don't.
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:47.320]  He's not a policeman. He's not a cop.
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:49.320]  He's not a cop.
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:17:09.320]  If Western civilization is not away, it's a problem.
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:12.320]  Now, Kevin, if they're fighting communism,
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:15.320]  what's the thing with the red fists and red flags?
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:17.320]  I don't know.
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:18.320]  I don't know.
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:20.320]  It's just a graphic.
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:22.320]  It's just rising up against the power.
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:24.320]  No, I get it.
[02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:26.320]  That's a good point.
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:29.320]  We can't let governments expropriate symbols.
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:32.320]  It's like in India, they want them to take swastikas down.
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:35.320]  They were there 3,000 years ago or at Native American lodges.
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:38.320]  People were saying, take them down to Sun symbol.
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:40.320]  Every culture uses it.
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:42.320]  It doesn't belong to Hitler.
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:45.320]  But at the same time, you see a fist and a red background.
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:46.320]  I'm not saying change it.
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:48.320]  I'm just asking.
[02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:50.320]  Full of red, white and blue in there, Cory.
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:52.320]  Five minutes.
[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:54.320]  We'll get it posted again.
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:57.320]  For radio listeners, this looks like a huge budget film.
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:17:59.320]  In fact, I was hearing it has a pretty big budget.
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:01.320]  Yeah, definitely the biggest budget I've ever had, sure.
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:03.320]  What's the budget?
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:05.320]  What's the budget, Mike?
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:07.320]  1.4.
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:09.320]  That's pretty good, yeah.
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:11.320]  And I saw a lot of drone footage in there.
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:13.320]  It looks really good.
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:15.320]  I've seen a lot of people drone over gangsters' homes
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:17.320]  and politicians' homes.
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:19.320]  Now, you were saying a bunch of hardcore stuff
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:21.320]  while the trailer was planned.
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:23.320]  I totally agree with it.
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:25.320]  Because a lot of this is a whole ISIS angle.
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:27.320]  Because you've got Putin coming in from one side.
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:29.320]  You've also got ISIS coming in.
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:31.320]  And then you've got the West.
[02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:33.320]  I guess three different factions.
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:35.320]  Big Mike?
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:37.320]  Here you've got the House of Saud.
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:39.320]  The House of Saud goes and they build these mosques
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:41.320]  all over the place.
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:42.320]  They're building a lot in Macedonia.
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:44.320]  They're building some in Bulgaria,
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:46.320]  not as much as in Macedonia and Albania.
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:48.320]  However, each one of these points,
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:51.320]  and here's the dangerous part in Bulgaria,
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:55.320]  they don't force them to adopt the Bulgarian language.
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:59.320]  They allow them not to speak Bulgarian.
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:01.320]  So it creates ghettos.
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:03.320]  So it creates ghettos, but it creates isolation.
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:05.320]  And in that isolation around that mosque,
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:09.320]  you now have the ability to recruit terrorists.
[02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:10.320]  And that's the problem.
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:13.320]  Now Putin is fighting ISIS in Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia.
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:15.320]  Saudi Arabia is fighting war on Russia.
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:18.320]  So again, who are the factions?
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:20.320]  It's confusing.
[02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:22.320]  You sit there and you try to get,
[02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:24.320]  you peel back and you think,
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:26.320]  okay, we finally get like,
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:28.320]  we kind of understand it now, what's going on?
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:30.320]  And it just gets worse and worse.
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:32.320]  Who is the job of the hot creature that you said is a bad guy?
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:34.320]  Because I noticed the arrogance.
[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:36.320]  We're going to skip this break.
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:38.320]  We're going to cut the music there.
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:40.320]  Who is that guy?
[02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:42.320]  Oh, Pepski.
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:44.320]  Is he a Mr. Universe?
[02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:46.320]  He's a pig.
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:48.320]  And literally is.
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:53.320]  He controls the majority of the media in Bulgaria.
[02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:55.320]  Is he a Russian puppet?
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:57.320]  Oh, he not only is he a Russian puppet,
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:19:59.320]  he's an ISIS puppet.
[02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:01.320]  And that's the problem.
[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:03.320]  This guy, the second largest party in Bulgaria
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:05.320]  is a party called Depase.
[02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:08.320]  He is one of their leaders.
[02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:10.320]  Now, now I asked you this earlier in a break.
[02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:12.320]  You said he's connected to ISIS.
[02:20:13.320 --> 02:20:14.320]  What's the proof?
[02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:16.320]  You said it's in the German news.
[02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:18.320]  It's in the German news.
[02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:20.320]  It was in the German news,
[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:22.320]  but it was also German intelligence substantiated said,
[02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:24.320]  yes, this is true.
[02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:26.320]  These guys, by the way,
[02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:28.320]  it's the four biggest political parties.
[02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:30.320]  Their leaders all have a cigarette tax scam going.
[02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:33.320]  And because of that, they involve ISIS
[02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:36.320]  and payments are going to ISIS.
[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:38.320]  So wake up.
[02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:40.320]  I'm telling the American politicians,
[02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:42.320]  wake up and do something about it.
[02:20:43.320 --> 02:20:44.320]  This is government of mafias.
[02:20:45.320 --> 02:20:46.320]  And because the people lay down
[02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:48.320]  and have an attitude of putting up with it,
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:50.320]  all these corrupt interests come in.
[02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:52.320]  And I guess what you're saying is
[02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:54.320]  out of the Soviet Union, they got their will broken.
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:20:56.320]  And so now they just expect to live under tyranny.
[02:20:57.320 --> 02:20:58.320]  And so it's all these competing factions
[02:20:58.320 --> 02:20:59.320]  that's very, it's very confusing.
[02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:01.320]  I mean, there's no, just, I mean,
[02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:04.320]  to say there's like Putin against the West is just,
[02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:06.320]  Why do you call it ghost nation?
[02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:08.320]  That's a great term.
[02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:10.320]  It wasn't a real nation because it's,
[02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:12.320]  when you go there, it's, it's,
[02:21:13.320 --> 02:21:14.320]  There's no real government.
[02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:16.320]  They're not trying to govern.
[02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:18.320]  All they're trying to do is steal
[02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:20.320]  and make deals with ISIS
[02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:22.320]  and make deals with Putin.
[02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:24.320]  And yet they say, hey, protect us.
[02:21:25.320 --> 02:21:26.320]  You know, give us EU status.
[02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:27.320]  Okay. We did that.
[02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:29.320]  And this is still happening.
[02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:31.320]  If America stepped in very quickly,
[02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:33.320]  they could end this very, very quickly.
[02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:35.320]  And the EU.
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:37.320]  It could be over within a year.
[02:21:38.320 --> 02:21:40.320]  Are you sure the Russians wouldn't try to come in?
[02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:43.320]  It's an EU nation.
[02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:45.320]  It's a NATO nation.
[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:47.320]  They would be stupid if they cried.
[02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:49.320]  Anything's possible.
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:51.320]  Like, look, Obama has a weak foreign policy.
[02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:53.320]  We all know that.
[02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:55.320]  He allows himself to get bullied.
[02:21:56.320 --> 02:21:59.320]  And like, you take a guy like Trump,
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:01.320]  Trump, I don't think he's going to allow
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:03.320]  what happened.
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:05.320]  Bush, even like the things that I have about Bush,
[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:07.320]  some of the bad things that I think about him,
[02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:09.320]  he was very strong foreign policy.
[02:22:10.320 --> 02:22:11.320]  Putin wouldn't try that under Bush.
[02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:13.320]  He wouldn't try it under Trump.
[02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:16.320]  But yet Obama, there's no foreign policy.
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:18.320]  And so he, he's just going around,
[02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:20.320]  he's doing whatever he's going to do.
[02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:22.320]  Obama's too busy trying to turn the world over to a new caliphate.
[02:22:23.320 --> 02:22:24.320]  You were talking about that during the break.
[02:22:25.320 --> 02:22:26.320]  Well, yeah.
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:28.320]  And so if you look at what ISIS wants,
[02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:30.320]  they have a map.
[02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:33.320]  And it's like, this is our nation we want to create.
[02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:35.320]  It's the Ottoman Empire.
[02:22:36.320 --> 02:22:37.320]  ISIS map of worldwide caliphate.
[02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:39.320]  Let's put that up on the screen.
[02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:41.320]  Yeah, that is it.
[02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:43.320]  It's the old Ottoman Empire.
[02:22:44.320 --> 02:22:45.320]  They want it back.
[02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:47.320]  And that includes Spain.
[02:22:47.320 --> 02:22:48.320]  Oh, no, Ottoman Empire.
[02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:52.320]  It was 500 years then in 1880, 1887.
[02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:54.320]  See, here's the problem.
[02:22:55.320 --> 02:22:56.320]  In 1887, the Russians came in.
[02:22:57.320 --> 02:22:58.320]  Mosul invasions were in the 800s, 600s and 800s.
[02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:00.320]  And they got repulsed.
[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:02.320]  They finally went all the way to Rome.
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:04.320]  That's what the Pope asked, 200 foot walls was for that invasion.
[02:23:05.320 --> 02:23:06.320]  They went from 100 feet to 200 feet.
[02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:08.320]  And he says, and now they lie,
[02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:10.320]  there are no walls around the Vatican.
[02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:12.320]  I mean, this is the New York Times, folks,
[02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:14.320]  that just announced today that most cancers viral,
[02:23:14.320 --> 02:23:16.320]  when Rockefeller was messing with it.
[02:23:17.320 --> 02:23:18.320]  Oh, yeah, there's their map right there.
[02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:20.320]  I'm sorry.
[02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:22.320]  I interrupted.
[02:23:23.320 --> 02:23:24.320]  That's what ISIS thinks they deserve to have.
[02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:27.320]  You know that Spain used to be blonde-haired blue-eyed folks.
[02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:30.320]  And they got taken over for 300 years.
[02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:33.320]  And then Europe had an invasion called the LaRica Conquista
[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:37.320]  and kicked the North Africans out.
[02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:40.320]  So that's what they think is theirs.
[02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:42.320]  Yeah, and people, look,
[02:23:42.320 --> 02:23:43.320]  people in America should be worried.
[02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:45.320]  People in the EU definitely should be worried
[02:23:46.320 --> 02:23:47.320]  if you look at that map.
[02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:49.320]  That's what they, that's their end game.
[02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:51.320]  Exactly.
[02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:53.320]  My issue is Iraq was pro-west,
[02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:55.320]  a bunch of Jordan is,
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:23:57.320]  a bunch of other countries.
[02:23:58.320 --> 02:24:00.320]  Egypt, they had women go to college,
[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:02.320]  women don't have to cover their faces up,
[02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:04.320]  all this stuff.
[02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:06.320]  They like America.
[02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:08.320]  Our government's trying to overthrow all those countries
[02:24:09.320 --> 02:24:10.320]  and putting Saudi run Al Qaeda ISIS crazies
[02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:11.320]  who literally keep women chained up,
[02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:14.320]  like, like, like a pet snail or something.
[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:16.320]  And that supposedly is okay.
[02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:19.320]  And the left won't even criticize it
[02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:21.320]  and actually is bringing the refugees in
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:23.320]  or mainly these crazy Wahhabis.
[02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:25.320]  What do you think the end game plan is?
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:27.320]  You've been over there, you've witnessed it.
[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:30.320]  What do you think Merkel and Hollande and Obama are doing?
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:32.320]  They're asleep at the wheel.
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:34.320]  Like, I don't know, I'm not,
[02:24:35.320 --> 02:24:36.320]  I'm not like the superpundit when it comes to politics,
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:38.320]  but the way, from my viewpoint,
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:39.320]  they're asleep at the wheel.
[02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:41.320]  Let me talk about Turkey.
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:43.320]  People don't realize Turkey's a member of NATO.
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:46.320]  They do, they're going to do five billion dollars
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:48.320]  with the business with the U.S. for F-35 fighters.
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:50.320]  So we kind of, we have a military,
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:52.320]  I think it's a submarine base there,
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:54.320]  Navy base somewhere there,
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:56.320]  and they just kind of turn a blind eye
[02:24:57.320 --> 02:24:58.320]  to what Turkey does.
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:00.320]  And here's, this is horrible,
[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:02.320]  they're allowing ISIS soldiers
[02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:04.320]  to come in through Iraq
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:06.320]  and they're coming in through Turkey
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:07.320]  and they're going back into Syria
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:09.320]  and they're slaughtering people.
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:11.320]  I've had pictures showing to me,
[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:13.320]  I was about a year and a half ago,
[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:15.320]  I was in Beirut,
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:17.320]  I was there with an Armenian community
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:19.320]  and they showed me pictures.
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:21.320]  These are horrific pictures
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:23.320]  and these ISIS soldiers went in,
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:25.320]  decimated these people,
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:27.320]  were brought back in ambulances
[02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:29.320]  across the border,
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:31.320]  back into Turkey
[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:33.320]  and put back into Iraq.
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:35.320]  There was a woman who reported on that.
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:37.320]  Two weeks later, she's dead.
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:39.320]  Wow.
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:41.320]  Well, to Putin's credit,
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:43.320]  he sent in troops, planes,
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:45.320]  he's battling Turkey,
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:47.320]  he says Turkey, you're running Al-Qaeda,
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:49.320]  Turkey, you're stealing the oil
[02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:51.320]  and proved it.
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:53.320]  And so Turkey's now threatening to attack Russia
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:55.320]  and Russia's threatening to attack them.
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:57.320]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:25:59.320]  I don't think there is a good guy overall in this.
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:01.320]  I just wonder why the West
[02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:02.320]  and the East,
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:04.320]  like the country you're talking about,
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:06.320]  instead they're involved in Syria
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:08.320]  trying to overthrow it
[02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:10.320]  to put Saudi Arabia in charge.
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:12.320]  Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:14.320]  Well, we know weapons manufacturers
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:16.320]  make money out of crisis
[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:18.320]  and people keep saying none of this makes sense.
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:20.320]  It makes more conflict, more war.
[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:22.320]  Eisenhower warned us
[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:24.320]  about the military industrial complex.
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:26.320]  Kelly, your view on this.
[02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:28.320]  I don't,
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:29.320]  I don't know where.
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:31.320]  You don't know where to begin.
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:33.320]  No, I can't.
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:35.320]  You're doing good.
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:37.320]  I can't.
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:39.320]  It's all.
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:41.320]  Does the world sound like it's closer
[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:43.320]  to World War Now
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:45.320]  or when you were a little girl
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:47.320]  and there was a Cold War going on?
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:50.320]  The Cold War when you were younger.
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:52.320]  Does that world sound scarier
[02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:54.320]  than this new world we're in?
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:56.320]  No, it seems scarier now.
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:26:58.320]  And I don't know if it's because,
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:01.320]  like, I don't know.
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:03.320]  Everything,
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:05.320]  everything that I'm finding out
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:07.320]  and just, you know,
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:09.320]  everything that's going on,
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:11.320]  everything's really scary.
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:13.320]  Why do you think unified Europe
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:15.320]  and the United States
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:17.320]  would have the exact same policy
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:19.320]  because they're doing this on purpose?
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:21.320]  Would bring in five million in the last two years,
[02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:23.320]  radical Islamic refugees
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:25.320]  to each other if someone catches
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:27.320]  their daughter out without her face covered?
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:29.320]  I mean, they will kill you,
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:31.320]  stone your daughter to death.
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:33.320]  This is the most unliberal,
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:36.320]  psychotic group of numbskull idiots.
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:38.320]  Why would you bring them in
[02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:40.320]  and why would the left
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:42.320]  who claims they're so liberal
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:44.320]  and about people's rights
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:46.320]  bring in stone age lunatics?
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:48.320]  That only knows.
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:50.320]  I don't know.
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:52.320]  Kevin, create chaos.
[02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:54.320]  I win something.
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:27:56.320]  You do win something.
[02:27:57.320 --> 02:27:58.320]  You know, Kevin's actually a tough guy
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:00.320]  and another incarnation.
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:02.320]  He actually started Ninja Bachelor Party.
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:05.320]  You know, that thing is so famous underground now.
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:07.320]  Somebody ought to remake it.
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:09.320]  Yeah, I know.
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:11.320]  I have people talking to us about that.
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:13.320]  Yeah.
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:15.320]  What's going on with Russell Crowe?
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:17.320]  I can't talk about any of that.
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:19.320]  It's cool and mysterious.
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:21.320]  Let's drop that subject right now.
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:23.320]  Hey, seriously, though,
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:25.320]  what do you think about
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:27.320]  the new X-Files character
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:29.320]  and have another premiere tonight
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:31.320]  and Chris Carter.
[02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:33.320]  By the way, I'll come out.
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:35.320]  I'm coming out to LA in the next month.
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:37.320]  You see you, Joe Rogan and Chris Carter.
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:39.320]  Excellent.
[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:41.320]  We got to have you up at the marijuana mansion then.
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:43.320]  Yeah, coming to the marijuana mansion.
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:45.320]  No, I don't have to smoke.
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:46.320]  I'll sign all the way to Beverly Hills.
[02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:48.320]  270.
[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:50.320]  Gentlemen, Jack, for you.
[02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:52.320]  No, I'm just joking.
[02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:54.320]  I don't drink.
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:56.320]  I don't drink before five.
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:28:58.320]  I'm joking.
[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:00.320]  It's a Christian family show.
[02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:02.320]  I actually have lost a lot of weight
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:04.320]  not drinking as much, so I've cut back
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:06.320]  to maybe a beer every once in a while.
[02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:08.320]  Alcohol has a lot of sugar in it.
[02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:10.320]  You know what?
[02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:12.320]  I used to drink a lot of wine
[02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:14.320]  when I was little.
[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:16.320]  You don't look like you need to lose any weight.
[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:18.320]  Let's just stand up, please, man.
[02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:20.320]  Let's see what the marijuana did to you.
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:22.320]  Let's see.
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:24.320]  Take a spin.
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:26.320]  Anyway, folks, we got to have some fun.
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:28.320]  Oh, come on.
[02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:30.320]  Come on.
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:32.320]  Just stand up.
[02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:34.320]  This is my candy.
[02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:36.320]  Very good.
[02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:38.320]  I wanted to say, why don't they get you
[02:29:39.320 --> 02:29:40.320]  to play the new Wonder Woman?
[02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:41.320]  Do what?
[02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:43.320]  She almost is.
[02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:45.320]  With those heels.
[02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:47.320]  Listen, Kelly, thank you for coming in.
[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:49.320]  We're going to bring in your Eastern European friend,
[02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:51.320]  the plus activist, the Empire.
[02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:53.320]  Stay with us.
[02:29:54.320 --> 02:29:55.320]  We're going to bring in, what's your name, Ivan?
[02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:57.320]  Alex Jones.
[02:29:58.320 --> 02:29:59.320]  Who would have thought?
[02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:01.320]  We'll be back. Stay with us.
[02:30:02.320 --> 02:30:03.320]  Putin has reportedly threatened
[02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:05.320]  to launch tactical nukes at Turkey
[02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:07.320]  if the ISIS-supporting country
[02:30:07.320 --> 02:30:09.320]  is helping the Syrian government fight ISIS.
[02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:11.320]  And Putin warned the Turkish president
[02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:13.320]  that Moscow is prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons
[02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:15.320]  to protect its troops if Turkey attacks.
[02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:17.320]  Since Turkey is part of NATO,
[02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:19.320]  any such conflict could quickly escalate
[02:30:20.320 --> 02:30:21.320]  into a full-scale nuclear confrontation,
[02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:24.320]  said award-winning Iran-contrajournalist Robert Perry,
[02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:26.320]  who was tipped off about the warning.
[02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:28.320]  Moscow's apparent threat to repel
[02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:30.320]  a Turkish invasion of Syria with nukes
[02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:32.320]  follows a warning by the Russian prime minister
[02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:34.320]  that another world war will erupt
[02:30:34.320 --> 02:30:36.320]  if the U.S. and its allies send ground troops into Syria.
[02:30:37.320 --> 02:30:39.320]  And if Syria falls, Russia will be geopolitically
[02:30:40.320 --> 02:30:41.320]  isolated from the rest of the world,
[02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:43.320]  which is exactly what the globalists want,
[02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:45.320]  so they can easily hijack and control the country.
[02:30:46.320 --> 02:30:48.320]  And further, adding to the threat of world war,
[02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:50.320]  Saudi Arabia is currently staging
[02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:52.320]  the biggest war game the region has seen
[02:30:53.320 --> 02:30:54.320]  in 25 years, according to Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:30:55.320 --> 02:30:56.320]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:30:58.320 --> 02:30:59.320]  When cells become toxic, they die early,
[02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:01.320]  and aging sets in.
[02:31:01.320 --> 02:31:03.320]  No one has put together a formula
[02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:05.320]  that focuses directly on brain health,
[02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:07.320]  nerve growth factors,
[02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:09.320]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:10.320 --> 02:31:11.320]  Just one of the key compounds,
[02:31:12.320 --> 02:31:14.320]  BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:31:15.320 --> 02:31:16.320]  You want the best that's out there

[02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:58.320]  from ProPure today.
[02:31:59.320 --> 02:32:00.320]  Thousands of years ago,
[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:02.320]  there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:04.320]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[02:32:05.320 --> 02:32:06.320]  giving the warriors of the tribe
[02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:09.320]  a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:11.320]  Sixty years ago,
[02:32:12.320 --> 02:32:13.320]  when foreign air forces were approaching
[02:32:14.320 --> 02:32:15.320]  filled with bombs,
[02:32:16.320 --> 02:32:17.320]  they had drums of their own,
[02:32:18.320 --> 02:32:19.320]  air raid sirens.
[02:32:20.320 --> 02:32:21.320]  But in the 21st century,
[02:32:21.320 --> 02:32:23.320]  there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:25.320]  Pathogens added to the food and water,
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:27.320]  into the lining of plastics
[02:32:28.320 --> 02:32:29.320]  that destroy our vitality,
[02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:31.320]  turn off our hormones
[02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:33.320]  and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:35.320]  I personally counter this onslaught
[02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:37.320]  with Anthroplex.
[02:32:38.320 --> 02:32:39.320]  Anthroplex is designed with
[02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:41.320]  known, organic, concentrated herbs
[02:32:42.320 --> 02:32:44.320]  to create the basic foundation
[02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:46.320]  to normal metabolic activity
[02:32:47.320 --> 02:32:48.320]  inside the human body.
[02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:50.320]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:52.320]  It's time for us to take our bodies back
[02:32:53.320 --> 02:32:54.320]  into our own hands
[02:32:55.320 --> 02:32:56.320]  and it starts at infowarslife.com
[02:32:57.320 --> 02:32:58.320]  with Anthroplex.
[02:32:58.320 --> 02:33:00.320]  Resistance to Tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:02.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:03.320 --> 02:33:04.320]  You know, Kevin told me about
[02:33:05.320 --> 02:33:07.320]  working on this film about a year and a half ago
[02:33:08.320 --> 02:33:09.320]  when it was in its embryonic stage.
[02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:11.320]  And I think it's very important
[02:33:12.320 --> 02:33:13.320]  to have a sense of the word
[02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:15.320]  of the word.
[02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:17.320]  And I think it's very important
[02:33:18.320 --> 02:33:19.320]  to have a sense of the word
[02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:21.320]  of the word.
[02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:23.320]  And I think it's very important
[02:33:24.320 --> 02:33:25.320]  to have a sense of the word
[02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:27.320]  of the word.
[02:33:27.320 --> 02:33:29.320]  It's going to take you down
[02:33:30.320 --> 02:33:31.320]  in the middle of the world
[02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:33.320]  and you know, in America,
[02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:35.320]  there was a film about a year and a half ago
[02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:37.320]  when it was in its embryonic stage
[02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:39.320]  and then it was taken to turn into Eastern Europe
[02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:41.320]  and you know, how horrible Putin was
[02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:43.320]  and all this stuff.
[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:45.320]  And I said, well, you're going to find
[02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:47.320]  it's a whole bunch of factions
[02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:49.320]  and you're not going to be able to even
[02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:51.320]  figure out who they are.
[02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:53.320]  And as you turn into more of
[02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:59.640]  Europe you look at Latin America we are becoming just like that as we become a system based on
[02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:04.200]  what group we're in not a system based on what you produced and free association.
[02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:09.480]  Now we're going to go back to our guest we have another guest in here with us as well who's really
[02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:14.440]  got an interesting story who has been over there and actually witnessed all of this who's a native
[02:34:14.440 --> 02:34:21.720]  of Bulgaria and a big part of the upcoming film as well and I was talking to Daria who's an American
[02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:27.320]  been in the US military and was a graduate of the defense language school and been out at Fort Bragg
[02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:33.480]  and she was excited when she saw Tim Kennedy the famous Green Beret in here beyond that that guy
[02:34:33.480 --> 02:34:37.560]  has been I'm not allowed to say the stuff he's been part of but the most elite army units there are
[02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:42.280]  and actually no folks separately know him and they go you know that guy killed Zachari
[02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:46.920]  you know was basically his bare hands all sorts of but you know Biggs is a really great guy too
[02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:53.000]  he's famous for when press was with him these Alcada guys were shooting RPGs at him and they
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.440]  ran out of you know machine gun bullets and Biggs literally crawled with a rock jumped over and
[02:34:56.440 --> 02:35:00.040]  stabbed the guy around the neck that's kind of cool I mean I'm not saying it's cool to kill people
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:03.080]  but it's just cool these type of you know folks that can do stuff like this it's pretty neat
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:09.880]  but I'm digressing often to all that we're going to be discussing it in great detail in upcoming
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:15.000]  films and more what is happening domestically here in the United States mirroring what's
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:20.920]  happening overseas but before I go any further liver shield is back in stock and this is concentrated
[02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:27.000]  known organic herbs that are designed to just make your liver basically relax

[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:10.520]  with the liver shield in the water and then you take eight ounces of virgin olive oil lay on your

[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:23.560]  it's why if we could keep it in stock it would be our best seller times two but because these herbs
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:27.800]  are so hard to get this is not an artificial scarcity pitch people know it's been gone two months

[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:23.080]  passionate about what i do i i love the cannabis plant i've had a love affair
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:27.960]  with it for i've been doing for 33 years growing and it had to stop you from working for 15 hours
[02:39:27.960 --> 02:39:32.120]  a day been successful that's right and yeah so that's the whole other topic people think like
[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:36.200]  there's an easy button out there and they think oh cannabis guys they just like they're growing a
[02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:40.200]  weed and they're sticking the ground let me tell you it's the hardest work i ever did when i was
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:47.320]  growing outdoors and and indoors it's a lot of work it's very manual but i've had a love of the plant
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:54.920]  and i've studied it researched it and our line of nutrients will take a cannabis plant
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:40:00.760]  and bring it to its true genetic potential at least the best way that i know possible i know
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:06.200]  so many troops and they keep going who never liked marijuana super conservative guys but
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:11.000]  prozac doesn't work stuff doesn't work from the five six tours they've been on they have
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:15.560]  anxiety attacks they wake up you know and grab their gun at three a.m you know with flashbacks
[02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:20.840]  and they go look i just smoked marijuana once a day at night i don't drink as much anymore it works
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:25.800]  great and it's got that effect sure it can be damaging but it's just something else god gave
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:31.400]  us i'm so sick of this hating it personally and kevin knows this i'm not a big marijuana guy no uh
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:34.680]  because i mean i don't care whether it's the you the two different types whatever it is my brain's
[02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:38.440]  already going too fast it doesn't have a calming effect on me it doesn't match everybody's i get
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:42.520]  really paranoid it well it also depends on the strain that you're smoking here's what people
[02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:46.680]  don't like sativa and indica right but and so they say sativa will give you up and it will get
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:51.480]  you low but what's we'll take you down but what's what's more important is action this is what you're
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:55.400]  going to see in the future you're going to see a cannibinoid profile but just as important
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:41:00.680]  is terpenes because the terpenes modulate the cannibinoids so um that's why the synthetic
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:04.440]  doesn't work because it's not the whole yeah it's not a whole plant extract and they have to work
[02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:09.240]  with whole plant extract that's why ours all of our products are cold pressed because it kills it
[02:41:09.240 --> 02:41:13.800]  and you don't upload it unless it's cold pressed by the way cold press is excellent like you cold
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:18.040]  press you're rocking the house dude that's good we we do cold we're some of the only people that
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:24.840]  cold press uh herbs and there's no alcohol to to we cold press it to a pure oil my time about
[02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:28.680]  that'll be evil that i cold press herbs and sell them but we're kind of in the same line
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:34.600]  these are these are plants god gave us absolutely is and what's what's what people don't realize is
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:40.520]  our body is wired for weed we have what's called an endocannibinoid system and two studies just came
[02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:45.480]  out of uh a study came out of germany from uh the hamburg university and heidelberg university
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:52.120]  that said runners high is not endorphins it is the endocannibinoid system releasing cannibinoids
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:58.680]  into our body now you're running high like runners high high once you hit that 20th wind sprint you
[02:41:58.680 --> 02:42:03.160]  get high that does feel like marijuana well go ahead yeah it is and so what runners high with
[02:42:03.160 --> 02:42:08.120]  a really feeling is the endocannibinoid system working to take away the pain we're wired for weed
[02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:13.160]  look chinese medicine they've been using this plant for 5 000 years it's there
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:20.440]  it's there for us to use response is it legal in china no god no like no drugs are like that's
[02:42:20.440 --> 02:42:24.120]  death penalty are they executed they're radical there that's the most i think they've been probably
[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:28.040]  more radical than islam is you know when it comes out i don't know why because the british use the
[02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:32.200]  whole drug thing to take them over well they'll be amores yeah yeah you know your stuff you say
[02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:35.960]  you're not political you're historical i don't know look we'll keep going keep telling us you're
[02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:41.640]  right down and we're gonna go to your guest oh so so anyways so our i've had this love affair with
[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:46.760]  a plant obviously the war on drugs doesn't work we spend a lot of money i believe that it was
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:51.880]  perpetuated by the industrial military that's industrial military the industrial prison complex
[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:59.480]  and now the truth has come out and the genie's out of the bottle and it's not going to go back
[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:05.400]  at all and i know this because there's there's two sides of this equation there's what i call
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:09.880]  our community and then there's the investors who are coming in and it's a mixture of both but some
[02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:14.520]  of the investors are some of the biggest donors to political campaigns you can tell some guy oh
[02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:19.960]  that 10 million 20 million dollar investment that you made i'm sorry but i gotta vote against that
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:26.440]  that's not gonna happen so in one way this kind of thing is good it ensures the future of medical
[02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:31.080]  marijuana and but then the other the other way is you got these these guys coming in here who
[02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:36.280]  just it's it's purely for profit yeah there's nothing wrong with profit you need profit to do
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:41.000]  all kinds of things i couldn't make the movie that we're doing now but you've got to make profit
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:46.920]  morally was something that helps people in my view i agree like i i feel so good getting up every
[02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:51.160]  morning and and doing what i do well one reason you've dominated and are getting bigger and bigger
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:55.400]  because i'm in marine the trade publications by this weekend before you came in i knew who
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:44:00.200]  you were before but i kind of did a closer look is i went to some of the biggest organic manufacturers
[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:04.360]  of vitamins and minerals and supplements in the last four or five years because i already had a
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:08.840]  bunch of sponsors that were great but i was like why don't i just do this myself and they go we wish
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:13.960]  we had people like you no one wants to actually put this into a product where the bottle costs 10
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:18.840]  dollars you know the product and you sell it for 20 you still make a profit or it costs 18 bucks you
[02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:24.280]  sell it for 40 we're still making a profit to fund our operation we need it but they say people put
[02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:29.240]  two dollars a product in and then sell it for 50 with fancy marketing just as a business guy if i was
[02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:34.360]  a sociopath i would want to sell something that works so good they want to come back to me i don't
[02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:38.840]  understand where you put it into marketing but not into what it really does why don't i sell
[02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:43.320]  something that blows somebody away and helps them and then helps me and then they're totally hooked
[02:44:43.320 --> 02:44:49.080]  i mean doing the right thing even midterm is always best but they teach the general public
[02:44:49.080 --> 02:44:55.000]  screw somebody over today win quick that's not how the world got built no you can't do it i mean
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:59.160]  our companies have been running for 16 years we're in our eighth generation of nutrients
[02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:04.440]  that we're working on and i've never cut corners and i've had my cfo's go like what the hell are
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:09.000]  you doing i go no this is where it's going to be and there there's some products that my margins
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:13.240]  are so low it should sell for three times the amount what about this what about when you can't
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:17.400]  get an ingredient and then your people are so religious about they're like no we just won't
[02:45:17.400 --> 02:45:22.760]  have it and then we have to wait till we get it or change the formulation because we're that neurotic
[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:28.120]  i mean oh yeah and when you spend a lot of money what happens eventually if it picks up is he
[02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:33.240]  get economies of scale sometimes so suddenly you get it exactly and then better deals open up yeah
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:37.560]  i think one of the ironies of the drug war is that it has created guys like big mic because of the
[02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:42.760]  drug war if it wasn't for the drug war you wouldn't have this incredible science and all these people
[02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:48.120]  so passionate about growing great marijuana i mean the the drug warriors have actually created
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:52.040]  their own worst nightmare which i think is the ultimate well for every action there's an opposite
[02:45:52.040 --> 02:45:57.880]  in equal reaction you just said it introduce me to this guy this guy listen i was in i was in
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:04.520]  bulgaria and i met this guy i was introduced through a a friend and him and his brother
[02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:10.120]  iscren and i talked to these guys for a while i go this dude's like really smart i come out find
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:15.800]  out like he's a member of mensa and he's like the smartest computer guy i've ever met in my life
[02:46:16.360 --> 02:46:23.640]  and he's politically passionate in a country where i didn't know top from bottom in the beginning
[02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:29.560]  and he has been instrumental in leading me through the land mines and avoiding them and
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:35.640]  pointing me in the right direction all of us in the right direction and his name is evan here we
[02:46:35.640 --> 02:46:41.320]  call him ivan so this is this is ivan and he's been your guide he was your guide uh in bulgaria
[02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:48.120]  not just a guy like no this guy's beyond the god he's he's a passionate warrior to change the
[02:46:48.120 --> 02:46:54.520]  government inspiration for great extent oh yeah we're on all right so so so give us the you know
[02:46:54.520 --> 02:46:58.440]  three four minutes spiel up front about what's really happening in eastern europe what's happening
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:03.240]  in bulgaria i mean who are the factions what was it like growing up there i mean he spent his whole
[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:10.680]  life there i'm one of the few people that actually left just didn't leave the country so i was feeling
[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:18.120]  really bad i mean all the guys my age and girls left so just it's coming it's it's becoming worse
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:25.800]  and worse and worse and worse so it's i was completely non-political guy up until five six years ago
[02:47:25.800 --> 02:47:31.000]  then i just saw that the problem is not the people it's not the country it's the the ruling class
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:36.280]  the guys that are actually how'd you say you said behind the left behind network or something like
[02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:43.160]  that stay behind network yeah so they are kind they are the drivers the thugs and the security guys of
[02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:49.640]  the former communist leaders our prime minister is a is the former security guy former um dictator
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:56.520]  that ruled us for 45 years um torus yeah so it's like at some point you understand that you have
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:02.680]  to do something i mean it's easier not to look at it not to do anything just don't don't watch the news
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:09.240]  don't do anything about it it's easier who are the factions i mean is it the the russians uh everybody
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:15.400]  it's i mean the russians have their clothes they are for 80 years or close so 45 plus four yeah 80
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:24.600]  years uh now we have we have um the islam we have everybody i mean everything that has a benefit
[02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:30.200]  there or a profit goes in and because the government is weak they're like so corrupt
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:34.680]  from my research i mean we know the russians are there influence russian mafia but is the islamic
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:40.440]  threat growing it is i mean it's something that actually needs to be controlled are they sweet
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:46.040]  and loving to you once you give in to them i don't really know i mean i i don't have experience in
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:51.160]  that stuff but but you can actually see it and there are a lot of decent people coming in running
[02:48:51.160 --> 02:48:55.800]  from the from the conflict as well so it's a mix they're bad guys they're good guys but then the
[02:48:55.800 --> 02:49:00.280]  bad guys use those communities as their base of course yeah of course and it's the usual thing
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:05.000]  you're just you you have to isolation you have the the scared people you have people all all my
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  people are just most of bogie are just trying to avoid them so we have this isolation that you can
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:15.400]  hide and that's it people are in denial in europe and eastern europe about the invasion which is
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:21.080]  making it even worse because people just want to well i don't see that yeah i mean uh they they
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:26.680]  need to do something i mean it's like getting out of control and because we we and i'm a normal guy
[02:49:26.680 --> 02:49:32.680]  i mean i know what's wrong i know how to fix it we created a system for electronic voting and the
[02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:37.960]  government didn't want it because they're dead because they they fake all the elections completely
[02:49:37.960 --> 02:49:43.320]  by the way this is pentagon level security it was unbreakable platform and when we were
[02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:49.320]  running we ran in the last election our our polls indicated we had between 11 and 12 of the vote
[02:49:49.320 --> 02:49:53.800]  you're running a political party oh yeah well i sort of well so we started a political movement
[02:49:53.800 --> 02:49:57.240]  and that political movement turned into a political party they're back the head of guy that no i know
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:00.920]  i should have sent it up front and that's why when kevin told me this like a year ago oh these
[02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:05.800]  people are cia are they george soros well okay well listen a lot of times though i'm not saying you are
[02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:10.040]  i don't think you are the point is is that obviously you you haven't been approached by the state
[02:50:10.040 --> 02:50:15.960]  department no i have not and i actually wish they would come to me and go hey like okay what you're
[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:21.880]  doing we understand it's a good thing and give us some funding so we can get the right people elected
[02:50:21.880 --> 02:50:26.040]  in that country well i think you're legit i mean i mean i come off that you know you're a real
[02:50:26.040 --> 02:50:29.320]  entrepreneur you really are doing this for the right reasons you've got to know though it's a
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:33.320]  good thing you do have a bunch of security because uh if you actually get this going the russians are
[02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:38.280]  going to come after you i've already been threatened but and i've been offered here's the here's the
[02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:44.280]  thing i've had two major parties in bulgaria come and offer me all the marijuana business if the party
[02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:48.200]  that i started with that i sort of started this at the front yeah right you've been offered all the
[02:50:48.200 --> 02:50:52.200]  marijuana business in the country a monopoly if you'll play ball with them right and if it's
[02:50:52.200 --> 02:50:55.640]  some marijuana guy that's my my agenda i tell absolutely not stay right there we're gonna come

[02:54:15.160 --> 02:54:19.240]  hour with our guest you say some powerful stuff during the breaks bro you were just talking up
[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:24.600]  donald trump big mic right i look at all the candidates who's out there who's for medical
[02:54:24.600 --> 02:54:30.280]  marijuana who's not hillary clearly isn't you know she's kind of waiting to see what the populist
[02:54:30.280 --> 02:54:35.960]  says i don't like that kind of position i like trump trump seven 1990 all drugs should be legal
[02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:42.280]  he supports medical marijuana for the states and even legalization at the state level he's a business
[02:54:42.280 --> 02:54:48.680]  man uh he's great at playing the media obviously but uh i hope that it's it will be around between
[02:54:48.680 --> 02:54:55.000]  hillary and trump and i hope trump wins but hillary's got one hell of a political machine
[02:54:55.880 --> 02:54:59.240]  and she will steal elections she's been stealing from bernie sanders in plain view
[02:54:59.960 --> 02:55:05.320]  and he went to hampshire she gets the delegates because she said so that sounds like that sounds
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:10.280]  like what you're talking about with your elections yeah exactly yeah you guys were getting into the
[02:55:10.280 --> 02:55:14.360]  election over there so what happened you were saying the uh not of the election what happened oh
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:22.360]  so and then the day of the election came and we ended up with 0.401 percent of the vote but guess
[02:55:22.360 --> 02:55:27.400]  who counts the votes the top four political parties that's like letting the fox guard the henhouse
[02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:33.480]  like what's going on here and no one e you could simply step in they said well we have observers
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:39.080]  well there's 11 000 polling stations they sent 200 people there like really and when we're there
[02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:43.160]  they actually the political parties were starting to fight over who gets the votes from the other
[02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:48.200]  parties and it was a big to do and we had a big press we just walked out in the middle of the
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:53.880]  you have a bunch of footage of this right we want we we walked out and the media came and just
[02:55:53.880 --> 02:56:01.160]  we're surrounded by cameras now now one second of that made it to the news that was censored it
[02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:06.440]  was censored yeah this is really where the story started yeah what do you guys think is going to
[02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:11.320]  end up happening in the middle east with this proxy war between iran and sari arabia with russia
[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:19.560]  and i'm gonna love it you know i for first off american he's a strong leader who's not going to take
[02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:27.720]  what's happening to us what putin's doing and push back and they they need to just get stronger
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:33.560]  on their stance with russia and putin i mean the guy is obviously like he's a medical a
[02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:38.440]  rabid mad dog and they're allowing him let's see let's see let's here's i don't get it i agree russia
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:42.120]  has corruption and problems but you're just talking about al-qaeda doing all these horrible things in
[02:56:42.120 --> 02:56:48.600]  isis who's fighting them yeah oh yeah i i understand that yeah i mean even trump says hey we should
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:55.720]  just leave him alone in syria look just because he's fighting isis on one front doesn't make him
[02:56:55.720 --> 02:57:02.040]  a good guy what is his end game what is his agenda that's what's really important control of the
[02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:08.840]  middle east maybe control of oil i don't know well i'd like him to eternally solve this new energy
[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:13.560]  and things they have just get rid of oil well you know here's the big thing it was happening
[02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:20.600]  bulgaria they run the russians supply energy to bulgaria and they have to pay 30 higher than
[02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:25.320]  they sell that energy to other countries why because some politician bulgaria made a deal
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:33.000]  paola was paid out and they got to recoup that that loss it's very bulgaria has enough energy
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:38.840]  and resources to be independent right perspective of eastern europeans that have had russia sitting on
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:43.560]  them for eight sixty seventy years you're sick of them well no no yeah i'm not only am i sick of
[02:57:43.560 --> 02:57:49.320]  them but here's russians pootons play pootons play is about energy and selling their their resources
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:55.320]  and shoving it down people's throats rather than being in a competitive competitive marketplace yeah yeah
[02:57:55.320 --> 02:58:01.640]  and i've been being able to be in a competitive marketplace and let the market dictate instead
[02:58:01.640 --> 02:58:05.800]  he wants to dictate well he's getting hammered right now because the soddies and others have
[02:58:05.800 --> 02:58:12.600]  lowered oil prices to bankrupt russia so my point is i i get me in that will change though that will
[02:58:12.600 --> 02:58:17.480]  go back up yeah like always well it's a huge war i'll tell you that i'm gonna come back get some

[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:48.040]  condense it other points you want to make about what you your perspective about what's happening
[03:00:48.040 --> 03:00:55.400]  in eastern europe i mean it's i can speak about bogara because apparently now romania is ahead
[03:00:55.400 --> 03:01:01.720]  of us 10 years you just stop monitoring romania their judicial system but they're continuing
[03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:08.120]  morning monitoring hours so the problem is that there is no control i mean the corruption so big
[03:01:08.120 --> 03:01:15.240]  and the the the the the prosecutor's office and that and the judges they're controlled by by the
[03:01:15.240 --> 03:01:20.600]  government which is not democratic because we need to in democracy you have the separations of the
[03:01:20.600 --> 03:01:30.440]  three powers like so it's this needs to change i mean people understand that now and this actually
[03:01:30.440 --> 03:01:38.760]  uh helps everything else happening i mean like um the corruption going out the fan just the russians
[03:01:38.760 --> 03:01:44.360]  do whatever they want everybody does more or less whatever they want so i kind of reached the place
[03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:50.360]  the place where you remember if you recall marquis de lafayette said insurrection is the most
[03:01:50.360 --> 03:01:56.040]  indispensable of duties to fight the government when the government violates your rights insurrection
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:02:01.800]  is one of the most indispensable of duties well thomas jefferson said that when the
[03:02:02.760 --> 03:02:06.360]  government fears the people there is liberty when the people for the government there is tyranny
[03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:09.880]  they're trying to expand the patriot act to just criticizing the government they're
[03:02:09.880 --> 03:02:12.760]  going to come arrest you that in fact i'm going to cover that when i come back with paul watson
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:17.480]  after you guys are gone briefly and this just shows what they want to do here but the answer is
[03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:22.840]  don't get scared of that say no to that reach out the government's full of good people as well
[03:02:22.840 --> 03:02:26.760]  they want to say no to the special interests that are controlled in our country so just like
[03:02:27.480 --> 03:02:32.200]  you guys have been you know fighting back against the russian foot on your neck because that's what
[03:02:32.200 --> 03:02:36.840]  big powers do globalists are much bigger than russia much more powerful they're coming in with

[03:05:02.360 --> 03:05:08.040]  dropped out of the 2016 white house race after losing the south carolina primary badly to billionaire
[03:05:08.040 --> 03:05:12.680]  donald trump who secured a strong victory with nearly a third of the vote bush formally launched
[03:05:12.680 --> 03:05:16.920]  his campaign back in june about six months after he announced he would run for top office he was
[03:05:16.920 --> 03:05:21.560]  supported by the right to rise political action committee which had raised in excess of a hundred
[03:05:21.560 --> 03:05:26.680]  million dollars for his campaign launch but no amount of money could save bush a dorky candidate
[03:05:26.680 --> 03:05:31.000]  who at one point actually begged the audience to please clap for him after his speech it was
[03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:35.240]  hilariously thrown off the stage at another speech for going over his allotted time people are
[03:05:35.240 --> 03:05:39.960]  simply tired establishment candidates who want amnesty for illegals flooding into the country it
[03:05:39.960 --> 03:05:44.760]  also didn't help that bush blew off the idea of releasing the missing 28 pages from the 9 11 report
[03:05:44.760 --> 03:05:49.080]  which were classified not because of national security but because they reveal saudi arabia's

[03:08:18.040 --> 03:08:25.080]  well in that last hour and a half interview you really got a perspective on
[03:08:26.680 --> 03:08:32.680]  more western eastern europeans but also further east not liking being under the soviet boot for so
[03:08:32.680 --> 03:08:40.040]  long and i get from their perspective it looks like a tyranny but i look at things very cold
[03:08:40.040 --> 03:08:45.240]  bloodedly just geopolitically about who's really making the moves who's doing the most depression
[03:08:45.240 --> 03:08:50.280]  who puts cancer viruses and vaccines who's trying to break up families who's saying don't use the
[03:08:50.280 --> 03:08:57.640]  word mother and father and the tyranny coming out of brussels belgium and new york city and london
[03:08:57.640 --> 03:09:07.960]  england and paris france and berlin germany makes the russian tyranny look like a lobotomized weasel
[03:09:07.960 --> 03:09:18.280]  compared to lax luther or lax luther and that's what i'm pointing out here the anglo-american
[03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:23.320]  power elite has about 70 percent of the power and a lot of top political scientists agree with me on
[03:09:23.320 --> 03:09:29.800]  with that number and they're the ones breathing down my neck and they're the ones jacking with
[03:09:29.800 --> 03:09:33.320]  everybody i mean here is the new york times scientists ponder the prospect of contagious
[03:09:33.320 --> 03:09:38.520]  cancer oh it turns out the viruses are giving it to you yeah and you put them in the vaccines it's
[03:09:38.520 --> 03:09:49.560]  been public for decades sv 40 was just the beginning and i read official government documents
[03:09:50.920 --> 03:09:56.840]  about 98 million people they believed contracted cancer many of which died from sv 40 alone in
[03:09:56.840 --> 03:10:04.520]  the polio vaccine and they think it's funny then you learn it's not a mistake and they're now getting
[03:10:04.520 --> 03:10:12.920]  around until in the public oh you can get cancer from a virus oh oh really really oh my gosh that's
[03:10:12.920 --> 03:10:19.320]  like saying the right brothers just discovered flight in 2016 it's it's just ridiculous and it
[03:10:19.320 --> 03:10:24.840]  makes me want to throw up now continuing here i want to hand the baton to paul joseph watson
[03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:28.120]  i didn't mention i didn't get to this yesterday i didn't get to it today i'm gonna do it briefly now
[03:10:29.160 --> 03:10:32.600]  and i think i'm gonna shoot a special video on this to really detail it because
[03:10:34.600 --> 03:10:36.040]  if you're a coward out there
[03:10:38.440 --> 03:10:42.760]  or you come from a perspective of fear you would read a headline like this and it would have a
[03:10:42.760 --> 03:10:50.280]  bad effect backing info wars may soon be considered material support of terrorism doj looking to tweak
[03:10:50.280 --> 03:10:56.440]  patriot act and prosecute anti-government extremist and by that extension being pro-life uh are being
[03:10:56.440 --> 03:11:00.680]  pro-property right or pro-second amendment they're coming after everybody but yes it it does
[03:11:01.240 --> 03:11:07.640]  they have on this national security council this splc ceo the fbi doesn't even listen to the splc
[03:11:07.640 --> 03:11:13.080]  they've been delisted the adls is credited but the homeland security just set up groups in the
[03:11:13.080 --> 03:11:19.320]  justice department above the fbi and these other agencies to who to their credit know the southern
[03:11:19.320 --> 03:11:28.440]  property law center is full of prunes to quote dan rather and so they want to be able to say that if
[03:11:28.440 --> 03:11:33.160]  you give money to a foreign group you didn't know they were connected to terrorism but later it turns
[03:11:33.160 --> 03:11:39.560]  out they were you could be imprisoned well that's unconstitutional a but b it's foreign groups and
[03:11:39.560 --> 03:11:45.640]  it's under war powers they're doing that and we always said they're gonna end up using this against
[03:11:45.640 --> 03:11:49.720]  domestic groups and they admit they want to use it against returning veterans veterans christians
[03:11:49.720 --> 03:11:53.400]  gun owners conservatives libertarians you know remember we broke those secret documents that's
[03:11:53.400 --> 03:11:59.800]  now mainstream they admit that so this is only part of this creeping move and it's it's meant to
[03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:04.040]  intimidate everybody these law enforcement magazines and stuff that say if you see a get out of the
[03:12:04.040 --> 03:12:08.600]  un sticker just go ahead and arrest and bring them in and chiefs there's a quote out of i think it was
[03:12:08.600 --> 03:12:13.640]  weapons and tactics of law enforcement i saw like 15 years ago i bought it to 711 and it was like you
[03:12:13.640 --> 03:12:18.040]  know telling people how great it is to arrest people for their speech well all that did was wake
[03:12:18.040 --> 03:12:23.400]  the cops up so the good news is they're trying to start a civil war but people aren't buying into it
[03:12:24.600 --> 03:12:30.840]  the problem is they're able to get enough leftist whack jobs in these positions of power at the fbi
[03:12:30.840 --> 03:12:34.680]  and other places where they can selectively persecute and target patriots and if they can get
[03:12:34.680 --> 03:12:41.960]  patriots to act stupid and be led in there by informants and do dumb stuff like what you saw
[03:12:41.960 --> 03:12:48.360]  out in um oregon we're walking into a trap we're winning ground informationally
[03:12:49.720 --> 03:12:55.960]  we don't need to get into a shooting war plus the globalists have a plan for a shooting war
[03:12:55.960 --> 03:13:02.680]  and they want the liberty movement the basis of good americana rule of law people who do
[03:13:02.680 --> 03:13:07.720]  see our country trampled we see the rule on the toilet we see a globalist occupation that's trying
[03:13:07.720 --> 03:13:13.400]  to submit and and complete the takeover of the states we have the moral high ground we can go in
[03:13:13.400 --> 03:13:20.520]  in suits and ties get people elected run for office file lawsuits change things they want to get a
[03:13:20.520 --> 03:13:26.360]  physical fight going that will tear up the police tear up the feds tear up the citizenry and will
[03:13:26.360 --> 03:13:33.560]  make the feds go to pure secret policing activity death squads you name it then that will escalate
[03:13:33.560 --> 03:13:38.920]  the civil war but after a couple years of that folks it'll just settle down they'll have a quote
[03:13:39.800 --> 03:13:47.240]  armistice deal with the quote rebel leaders who will be globalist if they can work it that way
[03:13:47.240 --> 03:13:52.280]  or groups they control and then they'll still continue the the covert war against the american
[03:13:52.280 --> 03:13:56.920]  people but they'll claim that it's been de-escalated now now these are standard procedures run in
[03:13:56.920 --> 03:14:02.680]  third world countries by both the communist and the fascist and the cia when it adopted fascist
[03:14:02.680 --> 03:14:08.680]  models in the last 50 years believe me we don't want to go down this road they want to put us
[03:14:08.680 --> 03:14:13.640]  into a thug culture a destabilized culture the good news is the military and police i talk to
[03:14:13.640 --> 03:14:19.000]  them all the time on air and off air from top generals retired to you know top people in the
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:27.160]  military currently and then by top i mean in in the officer class i'd say mid-level but even higher
[03:14:27.160 --> 03:14:33.560]  and i've talked to other prominent people that talk to similar people and the same people and others
[03:14:33.560 --> 03:14:39.000]  and they totally get it that the foreign banks want to end america take everybody's pensions
[03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:43.720]  make us a third world country arrest the former leadership of the military and the police and
[03:14:43.720 --> 03:14:50.520]  really bring in a a a a a a soviet model he won't be soviet but it'll be a soviet model
[03:14:50.520 --> 03:14:57.640]  of implementation, just like Homeland Security hired the former head of the Stasi to set up their
[03:14:57.640 --> 03:15:03.960]  spy grids. They are setting up a nightmare scenario. I mean, Hillary's on TV saying,
[03:15:03.960 --> 03:15:10.360]  don't say father and mother, and, you know, we need fun camps for men. We've reached that Rubicon.
[03:15:12.120 --> 03:15:17.480]  And I genuinely know that if we fall for a physical civil war, we're idiots.
[03:15:17.480 --> 03:15:22.920]  I mean, they want to brand this whole thing through Black Lives Matter, because they could go
[03:15:22.920 --> 03:15:28.360]  to the left of civil war or right wing civil war, and they're looking at both or separately.
[03:15:30.920 --> 03:15:33.400]  And there couldn't be a more important subject that I'm covering right now.
[03:15:35.240 --> 03:15:38.600]  They could push for either one of those scenarios or both at the same time.
[03:15:38.600 --> 03:15:48.520]  And who do they aim at? The local cops, people in uniform, white people, a Marine Corps veteran
[03:15:49.400 --> 03:15:53.160]  is in a McDonald's and has a tattoo show. He's white. He's a Marine.
[03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:55.560]  People have been programmed to be racially based. They attack.
[03:15:57.560 --> 03:16:01.720]  That's not going to hurt George Soros and the globalist if citizens get killed and veterans
[03:16:01.720 --> 03:16:10.680]  get killed and cops get shot. We need to have empathy for the people in the government because
[03:16:10.680 --> 03:16:15.320]  not all of them took houses from old ladies. Not all of them are involved in criminal activity.
[03:16:15.320 --> 03:16:18.520]  In fact, a lot of them aren't. They're in a criminal system. The whole thing's criminal.
[03:16:18.520 --> 03:16:23.160]  There isn't hardly a job out there you can get that is completely moral because the system's
[03:16:23.160 --> 03:16:31.000]  breaking down. But the government and the military and the police need to know we really have been
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:35.160]  partially taken over. Now the globalists are completing that and have empathy for the American
[03:16:35.160 --> 03:16:39.960]  people. Man, there's all this empathy for these illegals. They deserve to come here. They deserve
[03:16:39.960 --> 03:16:44.360]  all this free stuff. But an old lady losing her house, the IRS, over $10,000 in taxes,
[03:16:44.360 --> 03:16:48.600]  she can't pay because of medical bills is evil. And you don't hear Republicans or Democrats trying
[03:16:48.600 --> 03:16:59.080]  to stop that. So that's what it comes down to is we really need to not be stupid and let them
[03:16:59.080 --> 03:17:03.960]  trick us into, and folks, I used to see what happened at Waco when I was a younger man. I was
[03:17:03.960 --> 03:17:10.280]  smart but not as smart as I am now or wise. And I would get mad and angry and think, well,
[03:17:10.280 --> 03:17:13.000]  they want to start a shooting war. That's that. I'm not going to start it myself, but that will
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:18.520]  show them. That is just so dumb. Now that doesn't mean if they false flags and come after people
[03:17:18.520 --> 03:17:24.600]  and take our liberties. That doesn't mean we have a right to defend ourselves. But if we've gotten
[03:17:24.600 --> 03:17:28.760]  to that point, it means that we've lost the first face. Paul Watson, I know you got a lot to cover
[03:17:28.760 --> 03:17:34.200]  today. Any take on the last hour and a half, other big news breaking, the fall of the House of Bush,
[03:17:34.200 --> 03:17:38.120]  Hillary stealing more elections. What's on your radar today coming up? Paul Joseph Watson from
[03:17:38.120 --> 03:17:44.040]  London, England. Well, we're going to look at the free speech issue again, Alex, from the perspective
[03:17:44.040 --> 03:17:49.800]  of social media because what's happening on Facebook and Twitter is being mirrored in the
[03:17:49.800 --> 03:17:54.360]  real world. You know, people are being arrested for their tweets. They're being harassed,
[03:17:54.360 --> 03:18:00.760]  interrogated for, quote, hate speech every day. Yeah. But that's being broadened. The definition
[03:18:00.760 --> 03:18:07.320]  of hate speech and harassment is being broadened by social media, and then it's being replicated in
[03:18:07.320 --> 03:18:14.200]  the real world. So people are hurting someone's feelings are disagreeing. And then it's, and
[03:18:14.200 --> 03:18:19.720]  then it's adopted. Sorry, go ahead. Yeah, that's not the issue because it's, you know, if you,
[03:18:19.720 --> 03:18:23.880]  for example, in Holland, there was a guy who said that their country's refugee policy was, quote,
[03:18:23.880 --> 03:18:29.960]  a bad plan. He got a home visit by police. So it doesn't matter what you think constitutes hate
[03:18:29.960 --> 03:18:35.320]  speech or harassment. If we allow them to redefine it, then it's going to come back on us through
[03:18:35.320 --> 03:18:40.760]  official state oppression. This is government intimidation and setting the precedent to start
[03:18:40.760 --> 03:18:46.120]  disappearing people. We have to exercise our free speech in Europe in the US so aggressively
[03:18:46.120 --> 03:18:50.520]  that they're forced to back off or they'll get to the next level. And we've now reached the next
[03:18:50.520 --> 03:18:55.880]  level. And we're desperately trying to stop a civil war. Same thing in Europe, Paul. What do
[03:18:55.880 --> 03:19:01.000]  you think? And I'm going to skip this network break. What do you think is happening, Paul,
[03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:05.400]  with the situation in Germany with the migrant center burned and folks are cheering it? I mean,
[03:19:05.400 --> 03:19:12.120]  are they pushing the Germans into open revolt? Well, I've said all along, Alex, that if you
[03:19:12.120 --> 03:19:18.120]  leave a vacuum and you don't address legitimate concerns from the German people, you're going
[03:19:18.120 --> 03:19:23.320]  to create that vacuum which will be filled by extremists on both sides. It's going to be filled
[03:19:23.320 --> 03:19:29.160]  with Islamists on the one hand, who advocate these migrants traveling to Europe and basically
[03:19:29.160 --> 03:19:34.600]  trying to conquer the entire continent, which we've seen top imams call for. And then on the other
[03:19:34.600 --> 03:19:39.800]  side, you're going to get neo-Nazis who physically attack migrants, in many cases, innocent people
[03:19:39.800 --> 03:19:45.080]  and burn down migrant centers. So if you create that vacuum and the only people that German
[03:19:45.080 --> 03:19:50.920]  citizens have to turn to to represent their legitimate concerns are these extremists,
[03:19:50.920 --> 03:19:55.640]  then you're going to empower extremists. I've been saying that for months and months and months.
[03:19:55.640 --> 03:20:01.000]  We saw it in Sweden with a Polish group that tried to attack a migrant center in Sweden.
[03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:05.240]  Now we're seeing it here in Germany as well. So that is only going to increase, which is why
[03:20:05.240 --> 03:20:10.920]  all these top security experts are warning about civil unrest in all these major European cities.
[03:20:10.920 --> 03:20:16.200]  That has been created by the policies of people like Merkel and now they're going to reap the
[03:20:16.200 --> 03:20:22.440]  whirlwind. What about Hollande saying if any country, Alexa, right winger that he disagrees with,
[03:20:22.440 --> 03:20:26.520]  they're going to put sanctions on the country and not let you travel to the EU. This is so
[03:20:26.520 --> 03:20:32.520]  dictatorial. France is still under a civil emergency. They're giving awards to the socialist
[03:20:32.520 --> 03:20:39.480]  government who brought the Islamist jihad scum bags into the country. Well, of course,
[03:20:39.480 --> 03:20:45.560]  the irony of those comments that Hollande made is that he said that those measures would be
[03:20:45.560 --> 03:20:52.040]  necessary to ban right wing parties, even if they're democratically elected in the name of
[03:20:52.040 --> 03:20:59.080]  protecting democracy. So they annul the vote of the people, the democratic vote in the name of
[03:20:59.080 --> 03:21:06.120]  protecting democracy. We have now reached pure 1984. Yeah. And it's because they're propaganda
[03:21:06.120 --> 03:21:11.080]  campaigns against the likes of Marine Le Pen and in Britain Nigel Farage are completely failing,
[03:21:11.080 --> 03:21:16.680]  because again, these are the populace like Donald Trump, they're representing embracing
[03:21:17.240 --> 03:21:21.880]  people's genuine concerns. When there's no one left to embrace that, then that's what's going
[03:21:21.880 --> 03:21:28.600]  to happen. So again, yet banning right wing parties that are democratically elected in the
[03:21:28.600 --> 03:21:34.680]  name of protecting democracy, you couldn't get any more Orwellian than that. It is over the top
[03:21:34.680 --> 03:21:39.800]  bazaar. And then the very people that bring them the jihadis get awards for hurting the public.
[03:21:39.800 --> 03:21:45.160]  Simply amazing. Paul, I'm going to punch you out here and let you take over. Great job. I know
[03:21:45.160 --> 03:21:50.040]  you have a lot of stuff to cover, a lot of information. But briefly, since you're in the UK,
[03:21:51.800 --> 03:21:58.600]  in the United Kingdom, what is going on? You know, is the prime minister for the EU against it?
[03:21:59.160 --> 03:22:03.880]  Is the mayor foradded against it? They flip flop back and forth. Where do you think this vote's
[03:22:03.880 --> 03:22:08.760]  going to go that they've called to have the UK get out of the EU? Because because if the UK leaves
[03:22:08.760 --> 03:22:12.440]  the EU, I think that's going to trigger a domino effect of everybody else bailing.
[03:22:13.960 --> 03:22:19.320]  Well, it is. And that's why the prime minister Cameron basically pulled off this bluff. He went
[03:22:19.320 --> 03:22:25.480]  to the EU to negotiate a better deal to try and bolster the campaign to stay in the EU.
[03:22:25.480 --> 03:22:31.400]  But if you actually analyze this so-called deal he made with the EU, nothing whatsoever changes.
[03:22:31.400 --> 03:22:36.040]  So he didn't obtain any new special provisions that would bolster British sovereignty.
[03:22:36.040 --> 03:22:41.160]  He achieved absolutely nothing. So now in the aftermath of that, of course, Cameron is committed
[03:22:41.160 --> 03:22:46.280]  to staying in the EU. But what's interesting is that not only Michael Gove, who's quite well
[03:22:46.280 --> 03:22:53.160]  respected Conservative Party member, but Boris Johnson, who is one of the very few politicians
[03:22:53.160 --> 03:23:00.360]  in Britain that has a higher popularity than negativity rating, he's come out to leave.
[03:23:00.360 --> 03:23:05.960]  He wants Britain to leave the EU. So now they're saying that that's going to sway a third of people
[03:23:05.960 --> 03:23:10.120]  who are undecided. They're going to support to leave simply because of Boris Johnson's
[03:23:10.120 --> 03:23:16.120]  endorsement to leave. So that is a huge story. So again, going forward, it comes down to who's
[03:23:16.120 --> 03:23:21.720]  going to advocate leaving and staying. Some polls have shown that it's 50-50. Others have shown that
[03:23:21.720 --> 03:23:27.800]  the vote to stay is significantly ahead. The vote's going to be in about four months' time.
[03:23:27.800 --> 03:23:32.200]  It's going to be June 23. And as he said, it's going to be huge because it could
[03:23:32.200 --> 03:23:39.880]  create that domino effect where the EU completely loses any possibility of becoming the federal
[03:23:39.880 --> 03:23:47.080]  superstate that it was always designed to be. That's right. Paul, I want to finally here
[03:23:48.360 --> 03:23:52.120]  get your take on the US election briefly, and then I'm going to hand the baton over.
[03:23:52.120 --> 03:23:58.040]  In fact, I'm going to do that after I leave. I want you to give your take until you go to
[03:23:58.040 --> 03:24:02.760]  break on the US election on Trump on what your gut thinks is going to end up unfolding here
[03:24:02.760 --> 03:24:08.280]  because I legitimately want to hear that myself. I respect your view. But what about this? This
[03:24:08.280 --> 03:24:13.320]  image of Mark Zuckerberg says so much about our future. I agree with the Verge and I agree with
[03:24:13.320 --> 03:24:19.240]  Drudge linking to that, that it does say it all. Drudge said the rise of the Facebook zombies.
[03:24:19.240 --> 03:24:25.640]  Talk about Plato's allegory of the cave where they have these things projected on the cave wall by
[03:24:25.640 --> 03:24:31.400]  their controllers. He's walking by. Jobs didn't let his kids use iPads or any of this stuff. He
[03:24:31.400 --> 03:24:36.280]  said it was dumbing them down. Here's Zuckerberg walking by. He's a human bipedal. They're all
[03:24:36.280 --> 03:24:41.000]  sitting there like squat prisoners. They've all got basically digital hoods over their heads with
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:46.200]  his reality being pumped to them. They sleep. He lives. This is the beginning of the matrix taking
[03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:52.280]  over. This really says it all. What do you have to say to that particular photo? Paul Joseph
[03:24:52.280 --> 03:24:58.760]  Watson from London? Well, it's, you know, it's the singularity, isn't it? Ray Kurzweil's
[03:24:58.760 --> 03:25:04.440]  man merging with machine. Ultimately, the elite want to actually merge with computers to escape
[03:25:04.440 --> 03:25:09.480]  death. They want to download their brains into computers. What's positive though is that there's
[03:25:09.480 --> 03:25:14.120]  kind of a backlash. There's an article on Drudge, which is out of the Financial Times.
[03:25:14.120 --> 03:25:18.200]  People are going back to simple phones. People are getting back. There's been a movement for
[03:25:18.200 --> 03:25:24.120]  years for old tech. People are now prizing it. Exactly, Paul. Because I mean, all the studies
[03:25:24.120 --> 03:25:29.560]  show that it makes you miserable. If you constantly glued to your phone all day, you start to feel
[03:25:29.560 --> 03:25:34.760]  overwhelmed. You don't have any headspace whatsoever. I mean, I've done experiments myself,
[03:25:34.760 --> 03:25:40.920]  just staying off social media for half a day. Your mind is 100% clearer. And as you said,
[03:25:40.920 --> 03:25:45.560]  this article, you know, a lot of professional people, they're using smartphones in the day,
[03:25:45.560 --> 03:25:48.840]  but as soon as the nighttime comes, as soon as they're going out in the evening,
[03:25:48.840 --> 03:25:53.800]  they're reversing back to these quote, dumb phones. So they're only going to take emergency
[03:25:53.800 --> 03:25:57.960]  calls. So they're not constantly checking social media. Exactly. That's what I'm having to force
[03:25:57.960 --> 03:26:02.280]  myself to do. And it's part of my job to always know what's going on. So I actually have a home
[03:26:02.280 --> 03:26:07.800]  phone with crew that's on staff. And then they call me if there's something big enough. But I get
[03:26:07.800 --> 03:26:11.960]  home at six, seven, I turn the thing off. I try to turn it off during the weekend or
[03:26:12.840 --> 03:26:16.600]  but see, I'm not checking Facebook status and trying to be trendy. This is our job.
[03:26:16.600 --> 03:26:21.080]  And we use as a tool. But still, I got to go outside. I got to go for a hike with my kids. I
[03:26:21.080 --> 03:26:24.840]  got to go swimming. I got to go barbecue. I've got to get away from these little devils.
[03:26:26.200 --> 03:26:31.720]  You have to switch off because they're physically rewiring your brains. That's been proven. And
[03:26:31.720 --> 03:26:36.840]  they've been proven to make people depressed. Anyone who spends too much time on social media
[03:26:36.840 --> 03:26:41.400]  becomes depressed because they're seeing their friends. They're seeing all these photos of
[03:26:41.400 --> 03:26:46.680]  their friends having fun at parties and nightclubs. And they think that that's the day to day life
[03:26:46.680 --> 03:26:52.520]  of everyone. Yeah, people only go out to have fake experiences to show off to people online.
[03:26:53.320 --> 03:26:58.200]  Yeah, it's virtue signaling. Meanwhile, people have a real of their life. People who are in my
[03:26:58.200 --> 03:27:04.040]  house. The reality of day to day existence. So people who don't have that life feel depressed,
[03:27:04.040 --> 03:27:09.640]  feel lonely, and it makes them even more melancholy. And that accelerates the social class envy.
[03:27:09.640 --> 03:27:14.200]  Unless it's your job. And you have to go on it. But to a great extent, as he said,
[03:27:14.200 --> 03:27:17.640]  when you go out, just leave it behind, even if it's just for an hour or two.
[03:27:17.640 --> 03:27:22.440]  Well, when people come to my house, as you know, Paul, I say, turn the phones off, no Facebook,
[03:27:22.440 --> 03:27:26.840]  no Twitter, do not send pictures of us standing around the Christmas tree together. And people
[03:27:26.840 --> 03:27:30.840]  have done it and I blow up at them. People I've known for a while. I literally tell them,
[03:27:30.840 --> 03:27:35.080]  you ever do that again, you're out of my life. Do you understand? Do you understand? And I'm not
[03:27:35.080 --> 03:27:40.920]  trying to be mean about this. It's just I want to just absolutely go to the moon. I get so angry
[03:27:40.920 --> 03:27:45.240]  when people just just try to document their lives and everything you're doing. We only do this to
[03:27:45.240 --> 03:27:49.000]  document tyranny and document people fighting back against it. But I'm going to get off my
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:52.840]  high horse. Paul, great job. I want to thank all the listeners and viewers for their support.

[03:28:28.840 --> 03:28:33.800]  I want to ask you this. How big is it Trump coming out for 911 truth? Did it make Jeb drop out?
[03:28:33.800 --> 03:28:37.400]  Your take on the election for a few minutes when we come back and then get into all your other
[03:28:37.400 --> 03:28:42.760]  subjects. Paul Watson, take over. Thank you, my friend. Okay. Thanks, Alex. No, I mean,
[03:28:42.760 --> 03:28:48.360]  the Trump Saudi Arabia thing was absolutely huge. It really seems to have polarized the
[03:28:48.360 --> 03:28:54.280]  conservatives, the neocon element against him. But you know, as he proved in South Carolina, it's
[03:28:54.280 --> 03:28:59.000]  having no effect whatsoever. The attacks are having no effect. He continues to search forward
[03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:05.640]  because he's a true populist and he embraces and represents people's genuine frustrations.
[03:29:05.640 --> 03:29:10.360]  And there's been a lot of propaganda about Trump recently that, you know, he's only supported by
[03:29:10.360 --> 03:29:15.000]  dumb people who have a third grade reading level. Those are his, you know, the tone of his speeches,
[03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:21.080]  et cetera. Now, from what I've read today, he's starting to have a broader appeal to,
[03:29:21.080 --> 03:29:27.000]  you know, high paid professionals. This is not, he's not supported by an army of dumb people.
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:31.640]  More and more intelligent people are getting behind his message. The GOP establishment now
[03:29:31.640 --> 03:29:36.840]  that Bush is out will have to face up to the fact that they will have to embrace him and support
[03:29:36.840 --> 03:29:42.520]  him and abandon this idea of a broken convention. So it's going to be very exciting going forward
[03:29:42.520 --> 03:29:46.680]  and we're going to get more into it after the break on the Alex Jones show live. Stay with us
[03:29:46.680 --> 03:29:53.480]  for the fourth hour overdrive. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN
[03:29:53.480 --> 03:30:02.200]  radio network. Putin has reportedly threatened to launch tactical nukes at Turkey if the ISIS
[03:30:02.200 --> 03:30:07.080]  supporting country invaded Syria with Saudi Arabia. The Russians have about 20,000 troops in Syria
[03:30:07.080 --> 03:30:11.400]  helping the Syrian government fight ISIS. And Putin warned the Turkish president that Moscow's
[03:30:11.400 --> 03:30:15.960]  prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons to protect its troops if Turkey attacks.
[03:30:15.960 --> 03:30:21.160]  Since Turkey is part of NATO, any such conflict could quickly escalate into a full-scale nuclear
[03:30:21.160 --> 03:30:25.720]  confrontation. Said award-winning Iran contrarianals Robert Perry, who was tipped off about the
[03:30:25.720 --> 03:30:30.520]  warning. Moscow's apparent threat to repel a Turkish invasion of Syria with nukes follows
[03:30:30.520 --> 03:30:35.080]  a warning by the Russian prime minister that another world war will erupt if the U.S. and its
[03:30:35.080 --> 03:30:40.520]  allies send ground troops into Syria. And if Syria falls, Russia will be geopolitically isolated
[03:30:40.520 --> 03:30:44.760]  from the rest of the world, which is exactly what the globalists want, so they can easily
[03:30:44.760 --> 03:30:49.960]  hijack and control the country. And further adding to the threat of world war, Saudi Arabia is
[03:30:49.960 --> 03:30:54.120]  currently staging the biggest war game the region has seen in 25 years, according to
[03:30:54.120 --> 03:31:13.720]  Paul Joseph Watson. And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a
[03:31:13.720 --> 03:31:32.920]  new system. Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality

[03:33:20.120 --> 03:33:25.960]  We're back on the Alex Jones show live fourth hour overdrive now as we got into before the
[03:33:25.960 --> 03:33:31.800]  break there with Alex. We really need to focus again on this Twitter free speech issue because
[03:33:31.800 --> 03:33:37.240]  this is why it matters. It doesn't matter if you don't use Twitter. It doesn't matter if you don't
[03:33:37.240 --> 03:33:43.720]  use Facebook or any form of social media. What we see in the online world is being replicated
[03:33:43.720 --> 03:33:51.000]  in the real world. In the United Kingdom, something like 30,000 people a year are arrested
[03:33:51.000 --> 03:33:57.560]  for their tweets. And yes, a significant portion of those tweets are going to be violent, hateful.
[03:33:57.560 --> 03:34:01.560]  They're going to break laws and people are rightly going to be arrested for it.
[03:34:02.280 --> 03:34:08.280]  But then we have cases like the one in Canada with Gregory Allen Elliott who went through a
[03:34:08.280 --> 03:34:16.280]  multi-year court case at great expense, basically ruined his life and his career for what? He got
[03:34:16.280 --> 03:34:22.920]  on Twitter and disagreed with some feminists because now according to feminists, disagreeing
[03:34:22.920 --> 03:34:31.720]  with them or saying you suck is a form of harassment, is a form of cyber violence. So when
[03:34:31.720 --> 03:34:37.880]  you're getting home visits for disagreeing with people on social media, that's why it's a problem
[03:34:37.880 --> 03:34:43.640]  in the real world. That's why saying, oh, let's just build a platform different to Twitter isn't
[03:34:43.640 --> 03:34:48.840]  a solution. That's why saying, oh, Twitter is a private company at consensus who it likes
[03:34:49.480 --> 03:34:56.360]  isn't the issue. Yes, that's true. But increasingly, social media, Twitter especially,
[03:34:56.360 --> 03:35:02.280]  is becoming a kind of public commons. Even people inside Twitter consider it to be a
[03:35:02.280 --> 03:35:08.040]  form of public communications utility. So the fact that they've now introduced as we
[03:35:08.040 --> 03:35:15.720]  documented a few weeks ago, this trust and safety council that said freedom of expression begins
[03:35:15.720 --> 03:35:24.440]  with safety. This new Orwellian council to police free speech on Twitter, this is why it's of concern.
[03:35:24.440 --> 03:35:31.640]  Because as we documented, not one single group on Twitter's trust and safety council
[03:35:31.640 --> 03:35:38.600]  is a robust defender of free speech, not one group is conservative. And in fact, feminist
[03:35:38.600 --> 03:35:45.720]  frequency led by Anita Sarkeesian is the group that considers disagreeing with feminists
[03:35:45.720 --> 03:35:53.720]  to be harassment. So as we predicted, conservative voices are now being silenced on Twitter.
[03:35:53.720 --> 03:35:59.160]  So even if you push aside the whole public commons issue, and that people are getting home
[03:35:59.160 --> 03:36:04.760]  visits from police in the Netherlands for saying that their country's refugee policies are, quote,
[03:36:04.760 --> 03:36:11.400]  bad plan, even if you push aside all that, it's rampant hypocrisy on the part of Twitter.
[03:36:11.400 --> 03:36:17.480]  And it's why their stock price is plummeting. It's why prominent people on Twitter with millions
[03:36:17.480 --> 03:36:23.880]  and millions of followers like Stephen Fry last week are quitting because these professionally
[03:36:23.880 --> 03:36:31.720]  outraged social justice mobs are running rampant. And Twitter is bending to their authority,
[03:36:31.720 --> 03:36:38.680]  and in fact, hiring them, working alongside them to censor free speech. And again, if we allow
[03:36:38.680 --> 03:36:44.920]  the definition of harassment to be broadened to disagreeing with a feminist is cyber violence
[03:36:44.920 --> 03:36:49.560]  and harassment, then we're going to have real problems for free speech in the real world.
[03:36:49.560 --> 03:36:55.560]  And now on Friday night, they censored another conservative voice. This is out of reason.com.
[03:36:56.440 --> 03:37:00.840]  Did Twitter's Orwellian Trust and Safety Council get Robert Stacey McCain banned?
[03:37:02.200 --> 03:37:07.560]  Remember a few days ago when Twitter elevated anti-gamegate leader Anita Sarkeesian to its
[03:37:07.560 --> 03:37:13.480]  Trust and Safety Council, an imperious sounding committee with Robespierre's powers to police
[03:37:13.480 --> 03:37:19.800]  discussion on the social media platform. The goal, according to Twitter, was to make it easier for
[03:37:19.800 --> 03:37:26.040]  users to express themselves freely and safely. Well, one user who won't be expressing himself
[03:37:26.040 --> 03:37:31.880]  at all is Robert Stacey McCain, a conservative journalist blogger, self-described anti-feminist
[03:37:31.880 --> 03:37:37.720]  and prominent gamegate figure who was banned from Twitter on Friday night. Clicking on his page,
[03:37:37.720 --> 03:37:43.640]  redirects to quote, this account is suspended message that encourages users to reread Twitter's
[03:37:43.640 --> 03:37:50.200]  policies on abusive behavior. So again, what was his crime? Well, he basically disagreed
[03:37:50.200 --> 03:37:55.400]  with Anita Sarkeesian. Twitter doesn't even provide you with the reason for your account
[03:37:55.400 --> 03:38:01.720]  being suspended. And with journalists, this is a huge deal. People spend years and years
[03:38:01.720 --> 03:38:06.920]  building up their Twitter accounts. They put hundreds and hundreds of hours of work into it.
[03:38:06.920 --> 03:38:14.200]  And in an instant, it's gone because this individual dared to disagree with a feminist
[03:38:14.200 --> 03:38:20.840]  because he had the wrong politics. His account has been suspended. He started a second account,
[03:38:20.840 --> 03:38:27.080]  which was also quickly suspended. So don't expect it to come back any time soon. And this is the
[03:38:27.080 --> 03:38:32.440]  hypocrisy that I'm talking about. While this conservative is being suspended for little more
[03:38:32.440 --> 03:38:39.800]  than disagreeing with feminists for having the wrong politics, there's a kill Donald Trump
[03:38:39.800 --> 03:38:49.240]  account that was on Twitter active for six months without being suspended. Now, I published this
[03:38:49.240 --> 03:38:56.600]  article on Infowars.com earlier this afternoon. Twitter bans conservative blogger, kill Trump
[03:38:56.600 --> 03:39:02.280]  account, still active six months later. As Twitter suspended the account of yet another
[03:39:02.280 --> 03:39:07.080]  conservative for the crime of having the wrong politics, an account called kill Donald Trump
[03:39:07.080 --> 03:39:14.680]  that advocates assassinating the Republican front runner is still active six months later.
[03:39:14.680 --> 03:39:23.080]  This is the hypocrisy. Now, of course, literally minutes, it was probably about 10 minutes after
[03:39:23.080 --> 03:39:30.280]  this article was published, Twitter suspended this account. But it took them six months to do so.
[03:39:30.280 --> 03:39:37.720]  And it took a major publication to point it out. Despite the fact that this account had been retweeting
[03:39:38.360 --> 03:39:46.600]  open direct death threats from leftists who wanted to want to assassinate Donald Trump.
[03:39:46.600 --> 03:39:53.480]  And in fact, direct tweets from this account itself, again, advocating the assassination
[03:39:53.480 --> 03:39:59.160]  of the potential next president of the United States. That remains online for six months.
[03:39:59.800 --> 03:40:05.880]  A conservative blogger who criticizes feminism, his account is gone in an instant and it ain't
[03:40:05.880 --> 03:40:12.520]  coming back. This is the hypocrisy with Twitter. It's been taken over by social justice warriors
[03:40:12.520 --> 03:40:19.240]  who hate free speech, whose entire raise on debtor and motive is to censor free speech and turn
[03:40:19.240 --> 03:40:25.480]  the internet into one giant safe space. Listen to these tweets that were being sent out by this
[03:40:25.480 --> 03:40:32.040]  account for six months. This was active. This is a quote. This is one of the tweets that
[03:40:32.040 --> 03:40:39.720]  bleeping bleep Donald Trump should effing die. Anyone got any people go to his election and
[03:40:39.720 --> 03:40:46.360]  shoot him with a sniper? Okay, that was on Twitter for six months. Here's another one.
[03:40:47.720 --> 03:40:54.680]  Anyone know a person that can kill Donald Trump? Direct violation of Twitter's terms of service.
[03:40:54.680 --> 03:41:00.440]  Of course, it's a death threat. It's a crime. It remained on Twitter for six months because their
[03:41:00.440 --> 03:41:07.800]  trust and safety council has nothing to do with stemming actual abuse and threats.
[03:41:07.800 --> 03:41:12.520]  It's to do with policing discussion. It's to do with silencing conservative voices.
[03:41:13.480 --> 03:41:20.280]  Now, as soon as I published this article, I began to receive other tweets from other leftists
[03:41:20.280 --> 03:41:25.720]  who had openly advocated assassinating Donald Trump. And this is an issue we covered multiple
[03:41:25.720 --> 03:41:32.440]  times over the past six months. After every single debate, there's an explosion of tweets on Twitter
[03:41:32.440 --> 03:41:38.440]  from leftists advocating the assassination of Donald Trump. In the majority of cases,
[03:41:38.440 --> 03:41:43.160]  nothing happens to these accounts. They're not suspended. Here's another one. This has been
[03:41:43.160 --> 03:41:50.040]  online for 48 hours. Again, the user has not been suspended. Quote, I have no pain in my heart or
[03:41:50.040 --> 03:41:56.760]  morality. When I say if Trump selected, I will perform an assassination attempt on him and that
[03:41:56.760 --> 03:42:03.400]  I will succeed. There's another account which I've retweeted on my timeline, which basically says
[03:42:03.400 --> 03:42:10.760]  the same thing. So we have a constant deluge of people openly advocating. And in some cases,
[03:42:10.760 --> 03:42:17.080]  actually saying they will directly plan the assassination of Donald Trump. Twitter does
[03:42:17.080 --> 03:42:24.920]  absolutely nothing. But they will censor a conservative journalist for criticizing feminism.
[03:42:24.920 --> 03:42:31.400]  They will de-verify a prominent conservative journalist, Milo Yiannopoulos, again, for what
[03:42:31.400 --> 03:42:38.200]  reason nobody knows. We've got sources inside Twitter that Yiannopoulos spoke to that said
[03:42:38.200 --> 03:42:43.480]  they were shadow banning conservatives, which means that their tweets are not showing up on
[03:42:43.480 --> 03:42:49.640]  the timelines of people who follow them. So again, they're skewing Twitter to this leftist
[03:42:49.640 --> 03:42:57.000]  perspective because its director, its CEO, Jack Dorsey, is in with that crowd. He's in with Obama.
[03:42:57.000 --> 03:43:02.120]  He's in with the Black Lives Matter hate group. And when Twitter becomes a public commons,
[03:43:02.760 --> 03:43:09.800]  and these are the actions they take to censor free speech, to suspend, to ban conservative voices,
[03:43:09.800 --> 03:43:14.840]  then yes, we should be concerned about it. Doesn't matter again if you don't use Twitter.
[03:43:14.840 --> 03:43:22.040]  It matters because this is having real world consequences. And yeah, here we have the
[03:43:23.320 --> 03:43:29.880]  Council on American Islamic Relations. Hamas supporting care takes on Trump accuses GOP
[03:43:29.880 --> 03:43:36.040]  frontrunner of inciting violence against Muslims. So again, because Donald Trump gave a speech
[03:43:36.680 --> 03:43:42.840]  in which he alluded to a historical event, they're calling for him to be censored for his hate speech.
[03:43:42.840 --> 03:43:50.840]  Meanwhile, every single day on Twitter, there are people advocating for the assassination of Trump.
[03:43:51.560 --> 03:43:57.480]  There are Islamists advocating all manner of violence again, nothing whatsoever happens to them.
[03:43:58.040 --> 03:44:03.160]  So it really is a key issue going forward. Because people again, as I've said, Gregory
[03:44:03.160 --> 03:44:07.960]  Allen Elliott, and he's not the only one, they've had their lives ruined over tweets.
[03:44:07.960 --> 03:44:13.000]  This isn't just, oh, my account suspended. I can't go on Twitter again. Oh, well, never mind.
[03:44:13.720 --> 03:44:19.400]  They're getting arrested. They're getting put up in court for this. So if we allow the definition
[03:44:19.400 --> 03:44:25.960]  of harassment to be expanded to you, sending a message to a feminist saying, I disagree with
[03:44:25.960 --> 03:44:32.680]  you, you're a liar, and that's hate speech, then it's a dangerous and chilling precedent for free
[03:44:32.680 --> 03:44:39.880]  speech. Because of course, it also intimidates people against criticizing feminism, against
[03:44:39.880 --> 03:44:46.280]  criticizing gun control, you name it, against criticizing Hillary Clinton. So you create
[03:44:46.280 --> 03:44:53.080]  this environment in which people self-censor. They're afraid to express their opinions because
[03:44:53.080 --> 03:44:58.600]  they might get their account suspended, or even further, they might get harassed by the state.
[03:44:58.600 --> 03:45:03.320]  So this is why we need to stand up to this. And this is why I've emphasized it over and over again.
[03:45:04.600 --> 03:45:09.320]  Moving on, though, we had a shooting over the weekend, of course, in Michigan.
[03:45:10.600 --> 03:45:16.600]  An Uber driver basically went on a rampage. It was completely random. This was an Uber driver
[03:45:16.600 --> 03:45:21.960]  who was targeting people randomly, targeting people who he was picking up in his vehicle.
[03:45:21.960 --> 03:45:28.680]  And yet how did the perpetually outraged left react? Well, of course, they whined and complained
[03:45:28.680 --> 03:45:35.080]  about the fact that it wasn't being described as terrorism, because the guy was white. So again,
[03:45:35.080 --> 03:45:42.120]  we need to remind them. This is the definition of terrorism, the use of violent acts to frighten
[03:45:42.120 --> 03:45:48.680]  the people in an area as a way of trying to achieve a political goal. It doesn't matter
[03:45:48.680 --> 03:45:55.000]  what the skin color is of the person carrying out the violence. That doesn't make them a terrorist.
[03:45:55.000 --> 03:46:00.200]  What makes them a terrorist is if they're carrying out that violence in pursuit of a political goal.
[03:46:00.200 --> 03:46:06.600]  Okay? Dillon Roof, white. Did he carry out his massacre of people in Charleston, black people
[03:46:06.600 --> 03:46:13.400]  in Charleston, as part of a political motive? Yes, he's a terrorist. Is mile Brinsley in New
[03:46:13.400 --> 03:46:19.800]  York City? Did he kill two New York police officers in pursuit of a political goal? The
[03:46:19.800 --> 03:46:26.200]  answer is yes. It was part of a Black Lives Matter revenge attack. Violence plus political
[03:46:26.200 --> 03:46:33.800]  motive equals terrorism. Being white is not a political motive. And yet again, we had this
[03:46:33.800 --> 03:46:38.920]  cacophony of Black Lives Matter supporters have left this coming out after this tragic
[03:46:38.920 --> 03:46:45.240]  shooting in Michigan, asserting that it was terrorism purely because the shooter was white.
[03:46:46.120 --> 03:46:52.200]  When in reality, there was no political motive whatsoever by the very nature of the attack.
[03:46:52.200 --> 03:46:58.360]  It was completely random. It was a not case. Who knows what kind of meds he was on or what
[03:46:58.360 --> 03:47:05.240]  kind of meds he just got off. But again, no political motive whatsoever. Being white is not
[03:47:05.240 --> 03:47:11.160]  a political motive. Yeah, every time there's a mass shooting, we have to point this out again
[03:47:11.160 --> 03:47:18.360]  and again and again. Meanwhile in San Bernardino, for days and weeks afterwards, even as it became
[03:47:18.360 --> 03:47:25.240]  immediately clear that this was an Islamist terror attack, this was an act of jihad. The
[03:47:25.240 --> 03:47:31.800]  left continued and even Obama suggested as much as a day afterwards that it had more to do with
[03:47:31.800 --> 03:47:38.360]  workplace violence. So again, it's not related to the skin color. It doesn't matter whether they're
[03:47:38.360 --> 03:47:44.280]  Arab, whether they're black or white, it's related to political motive. And again and again, we have
[03:47:44.280 --> 03:47:50.360]  to point out the definition of terrorism, because these people are so stupid, they don't know what
[03:47:50.360 --> 03:47:59.320]  it is, or will deliberately ignore what it means in order to be racist and identify an entire
[03:47:59.320 --> 03:48:06.040]  race of people as terrorists simply because of their skin color. Now, remaining on the argument
[03:48:06.040 --> 03:48:10.760]  of guns and gun control, of course, we've heard that in the aftermath of the shooting in Michigan.
[03:48:10.760 --> 03:48:17.960]  Well, the CDC has come out with an inconvenient study in terms of the Obama administration's push
[03:48:17.960 --> 03:48:24.920]  for more gun control regulation. Americans are more likely to be killed by accidental poisoning
[03:48:24.920 --> 03:48:31.320]  and flu than by guns. This is a study that came out last week, it's received virtually no media
[03:48:31.320 --> 03:48:43.880]  attention. But the figures show that there were 33,636 firearms related deaths in 2013, with 21,175
[03:48:43.880 --> 03:48:55.960]  being suicides. So to put this into context, you had 31,240 Americans who died in accidental
[03:48:55.960 --> 03:49:02.920]  falls. This means that Americans face a bigger threat from tripping in the shower or slipping on
[03:49:02.920 --> 03:49:09.160]  ice than they do being shot dead. And again, we have to point this out over and over whenever
[03:49:09.160 --> 03:49:15.640]  the stats come out. We have to point out the FBI statistics, the Department of Justice statistics
[03:49:16.200 --> 03:49:23.080]  that show gun violence in America has declined drastically since the 90s. But again, facts
[03:49:23.080 --> 03:49:28.680]  don't fit the agenda. So this is going to get ignored once again. And you can go down the list
[03:49:28.680 --> 03:49:36.680]  here. I mean, they don't even treat homicides as its own individual category. The number one killer
[03:49:36.680 --> 03:49:47.240]  of Americans is heart disease, 611,000 deaths per year. And you can go down the list. Diseases,
[03:49:47.240 --> 03:49:56.520]  Alzheimer's, diabetes, flu and pneumonia kills 56,979 Americans a year. Again, far more than
[03:49:56.520 --> 03:50:02.760]  deliberate gun homicides. But you're not going to hear these statistics because they don't fit the
[03:50:02.760 --> 03:50:08.440]  current agenda. Now, of course, any gun death is horrible, and we need to try and reduce that. But
[03:50:09.160 --> 03:50:13.640]  to claim that it's an exploding problem and that it's getting more and more severe is clearly
[03:50:13.640 --> 03:50:20.520]  disproven by these facts. So we've got that article up on infowars.com. We were talking
[03:50:20.520 --> 03:50:25.560]  about this with Alex briefly. Basically, the French president came out and said that
[03:50:25.560 --> 03:50:32.360]  if the people of a European country vote in a quote, far right party, which is of course any
[03:50:32.360 --> 03:50:37.720]  party that isn't completely socialist like his government, that the EU should step in and just
[03:50:37.720 --> 03:50:43.400]  disregard those elections as they've done with EU treaty votes and suspend that country from the
[03:50:43.400 --> 03:50:50.920]  European Union. Again, a nulling democracy in the name of protecting democracy, completely chilling,
[03:50:50.920 --> 03:50:55.400]  completely Orwellian. We'll get into it more after the break. This is the Alex Jones show live

[03:52:12.920 --> 03:52:16.680]  I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it. And I really
[03:52:16.680 --> 03:52:20.520]  wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right there. I popped two

[03:54:04.600 --> 03:54:23.880]  We are back. It's the final segment of the fourth hour overdrive. So basically in the spirit of
[03:54:23.880 --> 03:54:30.520]  the European Union, which every time a country voted against joining a treaty, they simply annulled
[03:54:30.520 --> 03:54:36.280]  the vote and told them to vote again, again the democratic virtues of the European Union in full
[03:54:36.280 --> 03:54:43.720]  force. Now French President Hollande is saying if the members of an EU state, if the voting public
[03:54:43.720 --> 03:54:51.160]  of an EU member state votes in a quote far right party, he's obviously referring to Marine Le Pen,
[03:54:51.160 --> 03:54:59.480]  then the EU should simply annull that vote and ban that country from the EU, all in the name of
[03:54:59.480 --> 03:55:06.680]  protecting democracy by annulling the democratic will of the people of that country. Again, completely
[03:55:06.680 --> 03:55:13.160]  Orwellian. And why are people voting for quote far right parties? Well, it's because the refugee
[03:55:13.160 --> 03:55:19.800]  crisis is now completely crippling Europe. We have this article out of spicer.com. Norwegian
[03:55:19.800 --> 03:55:26.680]  government, we will abandon international law if Sweden collapses. Norway is ready to abandon the
[03:55:26.680 --> 03:55:33.560]  Geneva Convention if Sweden collapses. The border will be closed by force and Swedish refugees will
[03:55:33.560 --> 03:55:40.200]  be rejected without the possibility to see asylum. So now the Norwegian government is openly talking
[03:55:40.200 --> 03:55:46.840]  about a collapse of Sweden because of this migrant influx. We have the German Interior Minister,
[03:55:46.840 --> 03:55:52.200]  Thomas de Mazier, saying that there are two weeks left to resolve the migration crisis
[03:55:52.200 --> 03:55:58.680]  before basically they have to shut down the border altogether, which is what we reported last week,
[03:55:59.240 --> 03:56:06.040]  EU to close borders to refugees on March the 1st. This is getting so out of hand, it shows no signs
[03:56:06.040 --> 03:56:12.040]  of abating that they could close down the border entirely to any refugees, because again, this
[03:56:12.040 --> 03:56:19.320]  is a completely failed policy. Again, going back to Sweden, we have the Gateway Pundit reporting,
[03:56:19.320 --> 03:56:25.720]  Swedish police admit there are now 53 no-go zones. They dare not enter and cannot control.
[03:56:26.600 --> 03:56:32.200]  Danish reporter Jeppe Joel from Newspeak TV described the deteriorating situation in Sweden,
[03:56:32.200 --> 03:56:37.240]  a once-petal country that is now regarded as the rape capital of the West. So the police have
[03:56:37.240 --> 03:56:42.280]  basically come out and admitted the conspiracy theory. Remember after the Charlie Hebdo attacks
[03:56:42.280 --> 03:56:48.920]  in Paris, they said that the idea of there being no-go Muslim ghetto areas was a conspiracy theory
[03:56:48.920 --> 03:56:55.480]  invented by the evil right-wing Fox News. They said the same thing about London. Now the Swedish
[03:56:55.480 --> 03:57:02.680]  police are admitting it. Of course, we went into one in Molenbeek. Again, another conspiracy theory.
[03:57:02.680 --> 03:57:08.280]  ISIS has said that they want to bring in more refugees, radicalize them, and create more of
[03:57:08.280 --> 03:57:14.520]  these no-go areas as centers of power. And the backlash against that continues. We mentioned
[03:57:14.520 --> 03:57:21.880]  the refugee center in Germany. Germans cheer as refugee center burns, crowds stop, firefighters
[03:57:21.880 --> 03:57:28.440]  from extinguishing blaze. This is the point I've made over and over again. If you don't allow
[03:57:28.440 --> 03:57:34.920]  legitimate criticism from concerned citizens, if you team up with Facebook and ex-Starsie members,
[03:57:34.920 --> 03:57:41.640]  as the German government has done, to censor criticism of this refugee policy, then you create
[03:57:41.640 --> 03:57:47.080]  a vacuum that will be filled by extremists. So you're going to see more and more of these
[03:57:47.080 --> 03:57:53.400]  refugee centers being attacked. And take this for an example of crushing free speech again.
[03:57:53.400 --> 03:57:59.560]  Dutch Pegida leader arrested for failing to take off a pickaxe. I spoke about before the break,
[03:57:59.560 --> 03:58:04.840]  you know. Dutch people being visited, getting home visits from police, for tweets saying that
[03:58:04.840 --> 03:58:11.080]  country's migrant policy is both bad plan. This is what it's all about. It's pressure from above,
[03:58:11.080 --> 03:58:16.520]  pressure from below. This is only going to get worse. This is going to cause civil unrest.
[03:58:16.520 --> 03:58:21.800]  That's what top security experts throughout Europe are warning about. And it appears to be coming
[03:58:21.800 --> 03:58:28.040]  to a head over the next two weeks, with March 1st being that key watershed date. That's going to
[03:58:28.040 --> 03:58:32.840]  wrap it up for the show. Be sure to stay tuned for the Infowars Nightly News. Alex will be back
[03:58:32.840 --> 03:58:41.480]  with a live show tomorrow 11 to 2. Of course, breaking news, infowars.com.
