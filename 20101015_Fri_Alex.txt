[10:29.000 --> 10:35.120]  year sir. Mr. Jones marathon man. Good to have you here. I had some questions for
[10:35.120 --> 10:42.440]  Tarpley and then a call Paul Craig Roberts but I can how about the
[10:42.440 --> 10:50.000]  Federal Reserve Act isn't that set to expire here? It is. 2012 or 2013? Yeah
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.640]  2013 and they want to redo with even more power that's what they're getting
[10:53.640 --> 10:59.400]  positioned for that's a good point Matt. Won't that won't that force a real
[10:59.400 --> 11:04.520]  debate finally if Mr. Paul's audit the Fed bill doesn't get something you know
[11:04.520 --> 11:08.720]  to exactly notice how this is all coming up and the fight is being joined right at
[11:08.720 --> 11:14.960]  that point and the crimes of these these these larcenous swindling mega
[11:14.960 --> 11:19.960]  criminals arch record award-winning criminals I mean they are the grand
[11:19.960 --> 11:26.720]  champions of ridiculous obvious evil and when humanity is being given a
[11:26.720 --> 11:31.680]  choice right now wake up take action resist or just get ready for absolute
[11:31.680 --> 11:36.800]  degradation. This is a science fiction nightmare is all I can call it and it's
[11:36.800 --> 11:41.080]  just insane trying to we wake people up and the amount of friends I have that
[11:41.080 --> 11:48.160]  you know just don't even want any part of it you know and it's oh no I was
[11:48.160 --> 11:53.480]  funny because have you ever seen that movie Johnny Mnemonic? No but I've heard
[11:53.480 --> 11:57.720]  about it. Well about the high-tech and low-tech where they give the technology
[11:57.720 --> 12:03.760]  to the transhumanist and there's a big disease all around called from all the
[12:03.760 --> 12:07.720]  radiation in the in the airwaves from all the digital you know electronics and
[12:07.720 --> 12:12.080]  stuff which is actually a you know a disease and then I think that's kind of
[12:12.080 --> 12:15.400]  where we're heading I don't know who directed that or you know well that's
[12:15.400 --> 12:18.760]  their plan all of this has been engineered it's a predictive programming
[12:18.760 --> 12:24.640]  frequency pollution. Have you seen Shutter Island you want you want to see evil thrown
[12:24.640 --> 12:30.960]  right in your face pure evil check out that that movie and you'll just be blown
[12:30.960 --> 12:36.320]  away I think. Yeah Rob Jacobson was telling me see that and I bought the DVD
[12:36.320 --> 12:38.560]  but I haven't watched it yet on the treadmill because I don't really like horror
[12:38.560 --> 12:42.640]  movies I just I see too much of it in the real world but give us the basic plot
[12:42.640 --> 12:47.720]  of Shutter Island. It's the Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Land he's some
[12:47.720 --> 12:53.240]  like Nazi general given the Capitol right around in the street talking about
[12:53.240 --> 12:57.880]  how the Nazis are still in this country and they're running experiments on
[12:57.880 --> 13:02.480]  prisoners and just pure evil just thrown in your face it was it just kind of
[13:02.480 --> 13:05.840]  blew me away but man I appreciate everything you're doing the money bomb I
[13:05.840 --> 13:13.280]  hope it goes well I hope we keep waking more people up. Set your SSIDs on your
[13:13.280 --> 13:17.080]  routers to infowars.com print the planet and blast that out everywhere man keep
[13:17.080 --> 13:20.480]  doing what you're doing. Thank you sir yeah that's another thing after the show
[13:20.480 --> 13:25.640]  ended yesterday the official three-hour transmission or it's four hour that day
[13:25.640 --> 13:35.000]  we we had the four top search terms in order very very exciting on that front
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  and info wars money bomb that search term stayed in there till late at night I
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.160]  mean we normally have search term we do it you know stays up there two or three
[13:42.160 --> 13:45.800]  hours maybe an hour sometimes I mean this was like said to be seven eight
[13:45.800 --> 13:50.920]  nine ten hours I was like midnight it was the top search that had a huge huge
[13:50.920 --> 13:54.760]  effect and then all these people out there reading newspaper articles and
[13:54.760 --> 13:58.400]  blogs about it they you know the we're getting what's really valuable not them
[13:58.400 --> 14:01.760]  tuning in as new listeners donating for the operation but we're tuning in
[14:01.760 --> 14:06.480]  hearing the truth and all those guests we had on so very very exciting in fact
[14:06.480 --> 14:10.480]  we probably ought to do another search term today there's some huge new 9-11
[14:10.480 --> 14:16.520]  news in fact Watson's coming up I want him to cover that new World Trade Center
[14:16.520 --> 14:19.660]  CBS clip that NIST had where they're talking about bombs bringing down the
[14:19.660 --> 14:23.560]  towers but that's a top story at prison planet calm let's make sure we have that
[14:23.560 --> 14:28.640]  video loaded so we can so we can get to that what I tell you Dr. Paul Kirk
[14:28.640 --> 14:33.240]  Roberts love the last hour uninterrupted interview because I am so
[14:33.240 --> 14:39.120]  absolutely tired that I was just real calm and almost like a Georgia gentleman
[14:39.120 --> 14:45.960]  like him he was just very very pleased very very pleased that I've been on the
[14:45.960 --> 14:53.040]  air this long and I'm getting quite delirious right about this time talking
[14:53.040 --> 14:58.920]  about the complete collapse of our society so it's probably a good thing
[14:58.920 --> 15:03.600]  I'm gonna be out of here in about an hour and Watson's filling in because because
[15:03.600 --> 15:11.920]  I'm not even tired right now I am exhausted think about Strom Thurman
[15:11.920 --> 15:17.560]  when he was 60 something years old doing a 24-hour 18-minute record filibuster
[15:17.560 --> 15:21.560]  can't go to the bathroom can't have anything to eat can have a drink of

[24:56.520 --> 25:02.200]  bank of america downgraded by bond markets on full closure credit markets
[25:02.200 --> 25:06.280]  Bernanke sees case for more fellow reserve quantitative easing or Reuters
[25:06.280 --> 25:10.120]  that's more money printing more more robbing your the value of your dollars
[25:10.120 --> 25:15.480]  governments again says no increase for the next two years in social security
[25:15.480 --> 25:18.920]  with inflation that's a cut in your social security but yeah
[25:18.920 --> 25:25.000]  it's how they roll uh u.s consumer sentiment dips to weakest level
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  since july well there's a recovery the government said so i mean come on
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.080]  if the government says the moon is made of cheese it is and everybody knows
[25:33.080 --> 25:37.560]  that china warns us against making yon dispute a scapegoat for flagging
[25:37.560 --> 25:43.480]  economy uh Bernanke again
[25:43.480 --> 25:47.720]  continues with all of his plans to uh devalue the dollars boosting the
[25:47.720 --> 25:51.720]  economy uh democratic funding uh fades
[25:51.720 --> 25:55.480]  so they're going back to the republicans uh that's just some of what's
[25:55.480 --> 25:58.680]  coming up wiki leaks being listed as terrorists and having their funding
[25:58.680 --> 26:02.840]  block that's in the one in guardian us today uh but right now let's go back to
[26:02.840 --> 26:09.320]  laura in montana montana welcome to the airwaves
[26:09.320 --> 26:13.800]  well hello uh i have never called your show before i thank you for your show
[26:13.800 --> 26:18.200]  we've contributed and my husband is a nine eighty nine eleven engineer
[26:18.200 --> 26:22.280]  thank you so much laura you're welcome and he came on board
[26:22.280 --> 26:28.040]  within the last year he's done uh even a presentation for the uh rhino
[26:28.040 --> 26:32.920]  republicans here in billings montana a first step into a wider world how how
[26:32.920 --> 26:35.560]  did that go
[26:35.560 --> 26:41.560]  well it did really well he took uh clips off he videoed uh clips off of youtube
[26:41.560 --> 26:45.480]  for the uh building seven that was the key point
[26:45.480 --> 26:49.640]  and i think he opened some questions again which is all we want to do
[26:49.640 --> 26:53.800]  for people and he handed out their brochures and so forth
[26:53.800 --> 26:58.520]  uh but uh so anyway that did go well i think
[26:58.520 --> 27:02.200]  i called because i have two questions not sure if these were
[27:02.200 --> 27:05.880]  for dr roberts or jerald seleni but here they are maybe
[27:05.880 --> 27:10.280]  you have had interaction with them that could answer these questions
[27:10.280 --> 27:13.560]  and i just wondered what is the point in owning gold
[27:13.560 --> 27:17.240]  coins or having an ira and gold bullion which is only
[27:17.240 --> 27:21.320]  as good as the questionable reliability of the brokerage firm
[27:21.320 --> 27:25.560]  what's the point since george soros and his bunch of fees
[27:25.560 --> 27:29.320]  plan to roll the existing american and foreign currencies into the new world
[27:29.320 --> 27:35.000]  currency or the sdr's then won't the price of gold plummet at that point
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.480]  well they're they're having a coordinated evaluation and all the
[27:39.480 --> 27:43.000]  estimates are the this this new global currency isn't one you'll hold in your
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.200]  hand it's the directive that the central banks will
[27:46.200 --> 27:49.480]  control what your currency is worth and the interest rate so it's a global
[27:49.480 --> 27:52.280]  system openly run by the banks they already run it
[27:52.280 --> 27:57.080]  you know the big six mega banks uh and that it'll be only valued a little bit
[27:57.080 --> 28:01.080]  more uh than the sub uh currencies this is an
[28:01.080 --> 28:04.840]  inflationary global system that they brought in and and
[28:04.840 --> 28:08.360]  nothing is perfect but what currency can you get into
[28:08.360 --> 28:12.200]  now that isn't being devalued in a concerted coordinated effort
[28:12.200 --> 28:16.520]  uh so regardless and in my view you know gold's up four times in the last
[28:16.520 --> 28:20.600]  nine years ten years four fold and so you know there's nothing
[28:20.600 --> 28:23.160]  perfect in this world but gold and silver's the best place to be and
[28:23.160 --> 28:27.240]  people with small budgets silver's a great place to be was five dollars
[28:27.240 --> 28:31.720]  an ounce ten years ago now it's uh almost 25 dollars an ounce right now
[28:31.720 --> 28:34.440]  that's spot you know it's it's more to actually get it because they have to
[28:34.440 --> 28:37.320]  ship it to you and the cost they had to get to acquire it there's got to be some
[28:37.320 --> 28:40.920]  markup you know just for the the the wheels of
[28:40.920 --> 28:46.600]  commerce to operate unless you're a money changing neural loader scum like
[28:46.600 --> 28:49.400]  hillary clinton i mean look at that witch there behind me on the computer
[28:49.400 --> 28:53.320]  screen um we take the images from info wars dot
[28:53.320 --> 28:56.280]  com and the rotator and we just randomly put thousands of images in here
[28:56.280 --> 28:58.920]  as they just kind of randomly rotate people are like what does this pop up
[28:58.920 --> 29:03.480]  then why does that pop up then uh but i hope that uh that answers your uh
[29:03.480 --> 29:07.640]  question uh laura uh there is no hundred percent thing to do out there
[29:07.640 --> 29:10.600]  there is no silver bullet but the closest thing to it is silver and gold
[29:10.600 --> 29:14.040]  right so it's called silver yeah i know if you had invested in apple you could
[29:14.040 --> 29:17.720]  say you've made a lot of money too and of course we can't use the gold coins
[29:17.720 --> 29:21.240]  because it's not legal to use it right now
[29:21.240 --> 29:26.760]  but what you do is see see you see you buy a gold coin and then as they hyper
[29:26.760 --> 29:31.240]  inflate the gold coin goes up in value and so you don't have inflation
[29:31.240 --> 29:34.200]  destroying it because even though the dollar's worth less when you cash the
[29:34.200 --> 29:39.960]  coin in you get the uh uh inflation reverted back you
[29:39.960 --> 29:42.360]  know what i'm gonna get ted anerson on after the break laura
[29:42.360 --> 29:45.560]  because and i'm gonna stay there i'm gonna have him talk to you can can you
[29:45.560 --> 29:49.800]  get let me make sure i can get him make sure we can get ted in here right now

[32:06.360 --> 32:10.120]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[32:10.120 --> 32:13.800]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[32:13.800 --> 32:17.960]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[32:17.960 --> 32:21.160]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[32:21.160 --> 32:23.800]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[32:23.800 --> 32:27.720]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[32:27.720 --> 32:31.240]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[32:31.240 --> 32:34.360]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[32:34.360 --> 32:37.080]  onages number five a solar power generator
[32:37.080 --> 32:40.760]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe
[32:40.760 --> 32:44.120]  in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old
[32:44.120 --> 32:49.080]  sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[32:49.080 --> 32:53.160]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun

[35:16.920 --> 35:21.080]  i'm so dingy and so simple i'm trying to explain it to laura and they've just
[35:21.080 --> 35:24.600]  now tracked down ted i wasn't gonna have him on right now but but ted's
[35:24.600 --> 35:28.200]  waiting in the wings 30 plus years in the golden solar business let me try to
[35:28.200 --> 35:31.880]  just explain this very simply will you guys hand me my wallet it's over there
[35:31.880 --> 35:35.720]  i don't think there's any cash in it does somebody have cash uh i think i
[35:35.720 --> 35:39.160]  use my cash paying for pizzas or something
[35:39.160 --> 35:42.440]  somebody give me some cash some ones some fives i'm gonna try to explain this
[35:42.440 --> 35:45.560]  right now on tv and the radio to everybody
[35:45.560 --> 35:53.400]  if gold nine years ago was 268 dollars an ounce thank you sir
[35:53.400 --> 35:59.800]  thank you mad ryan equally insane via sleep deprivation
[35:59.800 --> 36:06.440]  if if if gold was 268 dollars i think that was just
[36:06.440 --> 36:10.280]  low or ted can correct me nine ten years ago
[36:10.280 --> 36:13.320]  because the dollar hadn't been you know devalued to the point it is
[36:13.320 --> 36:18.920]  gold's really still at 260 dollars it's just that the dollar's been devalued
[36:18.920 --> 36:26.040]  see you you you buy gold when it's 268 dollars an ounce and nine years later
[36:26.040 --> 36:30.520]  or ten years later that'll give me the actual numbers i know it's roughly nine
[36:30.520 --> 36:34.760]  and a half years or so then today even though the dollar's been devalued the
[36:34.760 --> 36:37.960]  way i escaped this hyperinflation that they've been
[36:37.960 --> 36:42.040]  covering up it's now out in the open is i go and i sell that gold coin to a
[36:42.040 --> 36:45.000]  gold dealer and he buys it from spots you can put a
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.040]  little three four percent markup to pay for his little building or
[36:48.040 --> 36:51.720]  shipping or whatever and and then and then i get
[36:51.720 --> 36:58.280]  1400 dollars or more for a one ounce coin is there's the markup there
[36:58.280 --> 37:04.840]  and so i don't have 268 dollars back i have 1400 dollars back
[37:04.840 --> 37:08.840]  and so people say well well how do i use coins at a store
[37:08.840 --> 37:11.960]  well you go and exchange that gold or silver
[37:11.960 --> 37:15.000]  and and and then you better spend the money quick though if you're in hyper
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.920]  inflation so you get 1400 and then every day it's being
[37:18.920 --> 37:23.720]  devalued more you know gold might be 2000 six months or a year or even less
[37:23.720 --> 37:27.560]  so so yeah you don't want to get that cash back right then and then just save
[37:27.560 --> 37:31.240]  it because then you'll lose it then see this destroys savings it destroys
[37:31.240 --> 37:33.160]  basic common sense and i want to finish up with
[37:33.160 --> 37:37.080]  laura and then i'm promised i'll get to keith david raven uh steve
[37:37.080 --> 37:40.120]  uh kevin and others that are patiently holding there
[37:40.120 --> 37:44.040]  uh because uh i don't lean on the callers a lot of talk show hosts hang on
[37:44.040 --> 37:47.560]  them and need to take them we haven't taken many calls in 24 plus hours as
[37:47.560 --> 37:50.680]  you've noticed quite frankly i just may go to the next day this feels pretty
[37:50.680 --> 37:53.480]  good actually i'm starting to hit my third wind here
[37:53.480 --> 37:57.960]  but ted did i explain that correctly or uh am i wrong
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.680]  well you're certainly doing really well here gold was at 248 dollars now and
[38:02.680 --> 38:05.720]  said it's low okay so i started buying a few coins at
[38:05.720 --> 38:10.200]  268 so i'm an idiot but go ahead no no not an idiot it's just i mean how do
[38:10.200 --> 38:14.040]  you follow it every day i mean i i'm in the business so i have to uh that's a
[38:14.040 --> 38:17.960]  really good question laura man i i tell you if you if you look at history i
[38:17.960 --> 38:21.240]  mean the history of money uh if you know when they
[38:21.240 --> 38:24.440]  opened up the egyptian tomb six thousand years ago you found that they
[38:24.440 --> 38:27.640]  were buried with gold they weren't buried with paper currency at that time
[38:27.640 --> 38:32.200]  because paper currency developed from gold itself gold
[38:32.200 --> 38:36.360]  was money people were trading gold coins for goods and services and it was
[38:36.360 --> 38:39.640]  considered legal tender actually there was no such thing as
[38:39.640 --> 38:44.360]  legalizing tender tender itself was developed from the free market
[38:44.360 --> 38:47.800]  people go on they would dig gold out of the ground turn it into a coin and had
[38:47.800 --> 38:49.880]  a certain value and buy certain goods and
[38:49.880 --> 38:53.080]  wares and they didn't want to haul it with them and they were going to another
[38:53.080 --> 38:57.720]  country there were banks or or or money houses say in
[38:57.720 --> 39:01.240]  greece and then you could go over to it what you know israel or you could go up
[39:01.240 --> 39:04.440]  to demascus in syria or you could go over to
[39:04.440 --> 39:08.920]  roam or you could go over to babelon or you could go over to persia
[39:08.920 --> 39:12.280]  or you could go over to northern india and they understood
[39:12.280 --> 39:17.000]  and you would have a note uh that uh because they were in trade that this is
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.960]  a symbol of my 100 talents of gold and you could redeem it there for a small
[39:21.960 --> 39:26.200]  fee for the transfer and that's how paper came out or
[39:26.200 --> 39:30.200]  notes deeds to houses it all goes back to gold deeds to gold
[39:30.200 --> 39:34.200]  yep that's exactly right it was just a certificate for it was the specie gold
[39:34.200 --> 39:37.240]  was the specie and that was a certificate for that said that you had
[39:37.240 --> 39:41.800]  a specie stored typically at a goldsmith the goldsmith were the people that made
[39:41.800 --> 39:45.240]  the raw gold that you dug out of the ground that were nuggets and flakes and
[39:45.240 --> 39:48.680]  this type of thing and melted it down and turned it into a
[39:48.680 --> 39:51.720]  a round coin that was recognizable and the goldsmith
[39:51.720 --> 39:54.760]  had a reputation to make sure that it was pure
[39:54.760 --> 39:59.000]  and uh and therefore his reputation stood and you were able to trade that
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.520]  piece of gold in the marketplace because the next person knew that this was
[40:02.520 --> 40:06.600]  the goldsmith that they could trust when you had a note that said that you had
[40:06.600 --> 40:09.960]  gold on deposit with them because you're afraid to carry it with you
[40:09.960 --> 40:14.440]  that note was acceptable just as the gold was because they knew they could
[40:14.440 --> 40:18.280]  trust that smith um the united states currency is no
[40:18.280 --> 40:22.200]  different we had the continental system previous to
[40:22.200 --> 40:25.720]  the currency that we have now and the currency that we have now
[40:25.720 --> 40:29.400]  was supposed to be uh representing specie again it
[40:29.400 --> 40:32.440]  meant that you had gold and silver and deposit there was nothing more than a
[40:32.440 --> 40:35.560]  certificate that you could exchange back for that gold and silver that's what
[40:35.560 --> 40:39.000]  gold back means yep the gold back currency and of
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.320]  course in 1933 franklendy roosevelt when he confiscated
[40:43.320 --> 40:46.840]  gold in 1933 he took the gold from the people
[40:46.840 --> 40:50.200]  but uh and and then recently right at that time
[40:50.200 --> 40:55.240]  devaluated it from 22 an ounce to 36 an ounce just within the next year
[40:55.240 --> 40:59.080]  after he received the gold from the people or took it from the people
[40:59.080 --> 41:03.880]  then uh inflation continued on and we had an exchangeable currency for gold
[41:03.880 --> 41:08.280]  for foreigners but not for domestic people and in 1971 nixon had to shut
[41:08.280 --> 41:11.080]  that window as well so now we're sitting here with a fully
[41:11.080 --> 41:15.160]  fiat system that has no specie behind it at all and the fee and so because it
[41:15.160 --> 41:18.200]  has nothing backing it it's in competition against
[41:18.200 --> 41:22.040]  it's great great grand daddy it's almost like the paper is the devil
[41:22.040 --> 41:26.280]  waging war against the creator and i mean i don't mean that in a religious way
[41:26.280 --> 41:29.960]  but it's an analogy you've got the devil who's the fake counterfeit
[41:29.960 --> 41:34.360]  and it's waging war against gold that is the the source of the money the real
[41:34.360 --> 41:37.320]  value so so then yeah so now we have what's called
[41:37.320 --> 41:40.760]  legal tender laws rather than the open market saying hey gold is worth this
[41:40.760 --> 41:44.840]  so silver's worth that now we have a legal tender law that says hey you
[41:44.840 --> 41:48.600]  have to accept this piece of paper in exchange for your goods and services and
[41:48.600 --> 41:51.400]  it will leave all debts at the court level
[41:51.400 --> 41:54.920]  you know and i understand all that but you know the reality is is that they're
[41:54.920 --> 41:58.280]  printing the money i mean Bernanke came out today saying that he's
[41:58.280 --> 42:02.440]  going to continue to increase money supply water down the system and
[42:02.440 --> 42:05.000]  devaluate the thing so it just comes down to the point
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.760]  where do i want to store my wealth do i trust my wealth to be stored
[42:08.760 --> 42:13.640]  in paper currencies or certificates of deposit or wherever whatever it is
[42:13.640 --> 42:19.240]  in denominations of u.s dollar or do i feel more comfortable with having my
[42:19.240 --> 42:23.000]  wealth stored in gold and so historically we have gold or silver and
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.920]  it's being borne out now again as another example in lifetime
[42:26.920 --> 42:30.040]  it doesn't matter if they're devaluing the currency because you can always get
[42:30.040 --> 42:33.640]  that gold turned back into that silver and get the money at whatever level
[42:33.640 --> 42:37.160]  it is and not lose things through inflation
[42:37.160 --> 42:40.200]  exactly and it doesn't need to have a legal tender law
[42:40.200 --> 42:43.960]  in order for it to show value yeah i mean what do they give is the old
[42:43.960 --> 42:47.160]  analogy what are they in world war two in vietnam even
[42:47.160 --> 42:50.680]  today what do fighter pilots carry on them they carry
[42:50.680 --> 42:54.120]  british sovereigns because it's here's the queen of england you know who this
[42:54.120 --> 42:58.360]  lady is this is 24 karat gold they can fall down in africa
[42:58.360 --> 43:01.960]  they could fall down in the middle of south american jungle
[43:01.960 --> 43:04.680]  you know with the natives and they're gonna go
[43:04.680 --> 43:08.440]  hookah booga and bow down to that gold they know what it is
[43:08.440 --> 43:11.560]  yeah they call the whole value universally where the united states
[43:11.560 --> 43:16.280]  dollar is only about trust and and credibility
[43:16.280 --> 43:20.440]  and and how well people receive it as something of value
[43:20.440 --> 43:24.600]  and as soon as we lose faith in that currency because we've printed too much
[43:24.600 --> 43:28.440]  we've resorted to too much inflation foreigners won't want it the united
[43:28.440 --> 43:31.960]  states people won't want it and you lose that faith that's where
[43:31.960 --> 43:35.400]  hyperinflation and as gold goes up it competes and
[43:35.400 --> 43:39.320]  and shows naked and bear the fraud of the derivative scam now i'm
[43:39.320 --> 43:43.240]  causing the mortgages to implode uh bank of america again downgraded by bond
[43:43.240 --> 43:48.360]  markets on foreclosure credit markets so uh lora did we answer your question
[43:48.360 --> 43:52.520]  well uh you did yes and no um at that point
[43:52.520 --> 43:56.520]  what my fear is is at that point especially the late comers that buy
[43:56.520 --> 43:59.880]  gold i know you guys bought gold way back when it was 250
[43:59.880 --> 44:04.360]  but you're looking at people that now are what might be considered late comers
[44:04.360 --> 44:08.440]  i don't know well ma'am you've got to do an analysis at at 1980 inflation it's
[44:08.440 --> 44:14.680]  $2,500 an ounce so after we pass the 2,500 uh rubric
[44:14.680 --> 44:17.800]  but then inflation will increase so much more maybe four thousand but then
[44:17.800 --> 44:21.640]  there's another example alex in 19 we'll just we'll just say
[44:21.640 --> 44:29.080]  1991 gold was at 260 dollars an ounce well you go back to 1971
[44:29.080 --> 44:32.600]  gold was sitting at 36 dollars an ounce so
[44:32.600 --> 44:36.440]  would you be considered a latecomer at 256 dollars an ounce
[44:36.440 --> 44:41.880]  when 1971 gold was at 20 36 dollars an ounce the fact of the matter is is that
[44:41.880 --> 44:44.360]  what happened is is that gold is still buying that
[44:44.360 --> 44:50.200]  that man's suit and shoes and a tie where the united states dollar has
[44:50.200 --> 44:53.160]  you know i mean at that time i mean i mean you go back
[44:53.160 --> 44:57.160]  uh 500 years ago you could buy the finest suit of clothes for silver
[44:57.160 --> 45:00.680]  i mean i mean for a gold one ounce coin you could still buy a very fine suit
[45:00.680 --> 45:05.000]  you know for 1400 dollars so it's the same deal i mean i i don't know how to
[45:05.000 --> 45:08.600]  explain this to people and they're mining less gold now this
[45:08.600 --> 45:12.440]  year and last year than they're selling so that that adds to the equation
[45:12.440 --> 45:15.240]  correct head yeah that's right i mean see gold has a
[45:15.240 --> 45:19.480]  monetary value that it's had for thousands and thousands of years
[45:19.480 --> 45:24.040]  and you know i i i don't believe that there's going to be some miraculous
[45:24.040 --> 45:26.520]  thing that happens that's going to change that all around
[45:26.520 --> 45:29.720]  that is going to make the united u.s. federal reserve note that we carry in
[45:29.720 --> 45:33.880]  our pocket all of a sudden gain you know what a hundred percent of its value
[45:33.880 --> 45:37.800]  200 percent of its value and force the price all right ed will be between the
[45:37.800 --> 45:40.360]  two of us we're being obnoxious and i apologize
[45:40.360 --> 45:43.240]  laura you've got the floor for 60 seconds i've got to get to other people
[45:43.240 --> 45:49.080]  but uh go ahead and make a point okay i just was worried about uh that when
[45:49.080 --> 45:52.280]  they at the point they changed to a new world currency
[45:52.280 --> 45:56.440]  that that might be the point when gold plummet and then people coming in late
[45:56.440 --> 45:59.800]  might lose a lot of money the one other thing i wanted to say was about the
[45:59.800 --> 46:02.280]  federal reserve printing and their latest announcement
[46:02.280 --> 46:06.200]  announcement to print another 500 billion well you and i all
[46:06.200 --> 46:08.680]  we all know that a lot of that money went into
[46:08.680 --> 46:12.200]  wall street and the stock market for the purpose
[46:12.200 --> 46:16.680]  and now lately i think for the purpose in my opinion is sedating the baby
[46:16.680 --> 46:19.960]  boomers and keeping them from worry so that they won't
[46:19.960 --> 46:25.080]  uh you know crash the system or try to uh fight the system as it will they'll
[46:25.080 --> 46:28.680]  go out now and they'll be at their golf courses i don't know what you think
[46:28.680 --> 46:32.280]  about that ted but it seems to me they're trying to do that to pump up the
[46:32.280 --> 46:35.560]  stock market look at what's happened in the last couple months me
[46:35.560 --> 46:39.160]  that's all i had to say laura laura good planning i don't know
[46:39.160 --> 46:44.840]  yeah great questions great points and uh thanks thank you thank you uh it's
[46:44.840 --> 46:50.040]  it's that we already have the global currency it's 97 percent on average
[46:50.040 --> 46:53.400]  and that can correct me if i'm wrong of money it's digital worldwide
[46:53.400 --> 46:56.760]  so the globalists are already issuing sdrs for years they're just expanding
[46:56.760 --> 46:59.880]  that these international bankers now don't even need our country they just go
[46:59.880 --> 47:02.840]  oh we have five trillion we'll loan it to you if you give us everything you've
[47:02.840 --> 47:05.800]  got uh i mean they just like oh here i own the planet
[47:05.800 --> 47:09.880]  yeah and then oh bail me out or i'll destroy the economy i mean this is
[47:09.880 --> 47:13.320]  it's it's it's lunacy via the public's ignorance
[47:13.320 --> 47:17.400]  of basic facts our revolutionary war was over the money system
[47:17.400 --> 47:21.960]  uh all the other major presidents 1913 it's always about this read the
[47:21.960 --> 47:26.440]  declaration of independence read the federalist papers this is the issue
[47:26.440 --> 47:30.200]  not the dallas cowboys not if you got wrinkles
[47:30.200 --> 47:33.320]  not if your belly's hanging out no one cares
[47:33.320 --> 47:37.640]  it's money okay if you give a bunch of private bankers the power to create
[47:37.640 --> 47:41.800]  fiat currency you will wake up homeless on the continent your forefathers
[47:41.800 --> 47:43.640]  conquer ted i'm gonna come back with our calls
[47:43.640 --> 47:46.440]  get into some other issues and uh bob chapman's coming up perhaps you'll
[47:46.440 --> 47:49.080]  pop in with him and paul watson's coming up but uh
[47:49.080 --> 47:54.120]  briefly uh gold again right up there at what 1380 bucks or whatever
[47:54.120 --> 47:57.720]  even on profit taking it's bouncing right back up uh you are running out of the
[47:57.720 --> 48:01.160]  gold and silverly bought a few weeks ago what is today's offer briefly
[48:01.160 --> 48:04.680]  well 385 20 to be exact was the high today and

[48:10.840 --> 48:15.240]  walking liberty halves 1177 silver at 25 dollars an ounce
[48:15.240 --> 48:18.280]  i mean we are just touching that just a little bit earlier today
[48:18.280 --> 48:22.120]  i mean that is just absolutely out of this one alexa
[48:22.120 --> 48:25.320]  the the thing that the thing that ponders me i mean i just want to get as
[48:25.320 --> 48:28.680]  many creature from juckle islands that the book you know that
[48:28.680 --> 48:31.960]  600 page book in as many people's hands as possible
[48:31.960 --> 48:35.960]  and the reason why it's like the best piece of literature that describes
[48:35.960 --> 48:40.040]  and explains what uh what what what the what our caller just was talking about
[48:40.040 --> 48:43.960]  laura i mean she's didn't quite know why gold would be a good idea i mean it's
[48:43.960 --> 48:47.240]  this book isn't even written about gold but you'll understand by the time you're
[48:47.240 --> 48:53.320]  done reading it um 800 686 237 800 686 237
[48:53.320 --> 48:57.080]  especially a free silver dollar and then you know for paying for the book it's
[48:57.080 --> 49:00.600]  i know ted pays 10 bucks for the book and then he's giving you a free silver
[49:00.600 --> 49:04.280]  dollar uh that is uh about what 25 dollars for him
[49:04.280 --> 49:09.720]  to get so it's 25 and 10 is 35 and it was 10 bucks
[49:09.720 --> 49:13.880]  years ago alex they're closer to 15 no ted i know you're paying 10

[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.880]  and suddenly out of nowhere this bizarre cloud
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:47.480]  pops up with pinkish red lightning yeah well they admit they have giant
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.480]  weather modification programs going on everywhere but just like mercury in the

[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.600]  through your walls with x-rays they admit but
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:15.080]  that's only to keep you safe from scary men with big beards

[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.960]  could stop them from staging the next terror attack so

[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:41.560]  wtc collapses the search term keep keep saying that every 30 minutes or so
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.920]  watson please and remind folks about the money bomb i hand the
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:48.360]  reins in the last hour and 45 minutes of worldwide transmission
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:51.560]  to paul joseph watson of prismplanet.com
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:56.600]  god bless you all i salute you all this has been an amazing 25 plus hours and
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:03.160]  now we go into 26 and 27th hour with paul joseph watson
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:07.000]  thank you very much alex info wars money bomb
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:13.480]  dot com the phone number to donate is 8882533139
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:17.560]  and as alex has been discussing we're basically within touching distance
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:21.320]  once we account for the checks that are going to come in the mail over the next
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:27.960]  several days where within touching distance of that 500k target
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:32.760]  you've doubtless been watching the uh outstanding live video stream the free
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:37.400]  video stream uh with all these amazing interviews on info wars dot com
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:42.360]  and in fact i've read several comments on there already saying that basically
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:45.720]  these are some of the best interviews people have heard with
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:50.360]  uh salente people like alan watt lord montan the best interviews they've ever
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.400]  conducted and all that has been streaming out for free
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:57.240]  overnight it was interesting i tuned in this morning
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:02.120]  alex's time at about 4am and his his voice sounded about two octaves lower
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:07.400]  which was put a different spin on things but he sounds a lot more sparky
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:11.160]  um at this moment in time but i mean this is where
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:14.600]  all your support goes it goes to produce the kind of interviews
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:19.240]  with the equipment required that make them look and sound like pbs
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.640]  quality interviews and it's uh just a testament to how far
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.840]  we've come and how many people we've been able to reach
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.960]  in such a short space of time if you think about it
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.960]  i mean when i visited alex's office back in
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:39.720]  2005 in austin he basically had three employees working in this dingy little
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:43.560]  studio um and they had to do everything you know customer
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:46.280]  service making videos running the websites
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.720]  it was a skeleton crew to say the least
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:53.320]  um and you know you don't go from that to where we are now
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:56.760]  even though we're still in comparison to these
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:01.240]  foundation funded media organizations a miniscule operation
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:05.000]  but just in the past five years i mean
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.720]  the advance in sophistication and the delivery of content
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:14.600]  is amazing to behold and that's solely because of the support that you provided
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.200]  um which has been poured straight back into the operation
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:23.480]  just a year before that uh in 2004 we launched prison planet dot tv and the
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:26.760]  result of that support combined with the two money
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:30.280]  bombs we've been able to reach millions more
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:35.160]  because you know unlike people like media matters our primary motivation is to
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:39.560]  tell the truth uh we work at dam site harder than any
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.160]  of them and the biggest reason behind why we're
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:46.600]  able to pierce the veil of the corporate media lockdown
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:50.520]  is because our listeners support us financially on a regular basis so we
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:55.000]  don't have to take money from lobbyists and foundations that pollute
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.480]  our message with propaganda people like George Soros
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:05.480]  and General Electric so that's why we need your continued to support
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:10.440]  to push us over that 500k level and you can contribute at info wars

[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.440]  honestly i think we should just trust our president and every decision that he
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:07.480]  makes and we should just support that you know and um be faithful in what
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.360]  happens do you trust this president yes i do
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:13.800]  do you have confidence in the president and his national security team
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:18.600]  to lead the war at this stage i do i do i have confidence in the president and i
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:41.240]  believe that um he is well aware of the severity of the situation
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.840]  that's right ladies and gentlemen just trust the government don't support
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:49.400]  independent media don't donate to info warsmoneybomb.com
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:56.360]  at 888-253-3139 but in all seriousness this is about
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:01.560]  supporting independent media and supporting independent media is the key
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:06.120]  in the continued struggle for a new 9-11 investigation
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:10.680]  because basically the alternative media are the only ones reporting on the
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:15.320]  continual bombshell revelations that are emerging from the suppressed
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.680]  nist footage of the world trade center attacks
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:23.720]  as well as hard scientific analysis of the world trade center rubble
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:26.200]  and this is what we're going to be talking about we're going to be taking
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:29.640]  your calls shortly as well bob Chapman in the second hour
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:34.280]  we have confirmation from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:38.440]  via architects and engineers for 9-11 truth that in addition
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:41.640]  to the Fermi and the molten rivers of steel
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:45.560]  that were documented and found in the rubble of the world trade center
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:51.240]  quote a technologically advanced highly energetic material
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:54.760]  has been discovered in the world trade center dust
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:59.160]  and we've got pictures of this on prismplanet.com right now
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.600]  and what they've discovered essentially were these highly energetic
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:09.080]  and highly explosive red chips of material that basically have no
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:12.760]  business being there in the rubble they could not have been caused by the
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:16.920]  impact of airliners or in a conventional collapse of the
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:20.120]  building and get this when the University of
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:23.880]  Copenhagen tested these samples they discovered that
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:28.280]  they were nano-engineered iron oxide and aluminium
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:33.080]  particles that quote exhibit the same characteristics as advanced
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:38.120]  energetic materials developed in US national laboratories in the years
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:42.040]  leading up to 9-11 so these were man-made highly
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:45.960]  energetic highly explosive materials that have been
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:50.200]  newly discovered in this world trade center dust that the University
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:56.120]  of Copenhagen has been analyzing we're talking about hard scientific evidence
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:27:00.920]  and this is why the 9-11 truth movement continues to struggle
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:05.480]  for this new investigation because NIST and the 9-11 commission
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:10.760]  completely refused to even consider evidence that pertain to explosives
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:14.280]  the 9-11 commission ignored hundreds of survivors
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:18.200]  professionals firefighters first responders who reported
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:25.080]  numerous secondary explosions at all levels of the twin towers and WTC-7
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:28.920]  despite the fact that the perimeter wall sections
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:33.880]  you know many of them weighing tons literally tens and tens of tons
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:38.600]  were ejected laterally at 60 miles per hour to a distance of
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:44.040]  600 feet in the collapse of the twin towers
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:47.720]  but NIST in its final report refused to study
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:51.240]  any other aspect of the twin towers collapse other than
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:57.240]  quote the initiation collapse so they failed completely to explain
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:01.080]  not only how the towers were pulverized but how they fell at near
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:05.800]  freefall speed so given the characteristics of the collapse of
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:09.480]  the twin towers which resembled controlled demolition
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:14.520]  and given the fact that later detailed analysis of the rubble
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:19.960]  found these highly explosive particles what were the media and the authorities
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:25.160]  on the scene reporting first before this official story about 19 men with
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.760]  box-cutters acting at the behest of a man in the cave
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:37.560]  was in polls play the first clip
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:41.240]  do you have the first clip the cnn cbs clip
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:44.360]  Marcia Kramer who's in the newsroom for a further update Marcia
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:48.920]  we have a number of updates number one um cnn is now reporting that there was a
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:52.920]  third explosion at the world trade center probably an explosion from the
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:56.200]  ground that caused world trade center one to collapse
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:00.440]  on top of itself again there was a third explosion it's unclear what caused it
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:04.840]  whether it was a bomb or whether the first plane that crashed into the tower
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:09.320]  had somehow been pooby trapped with a bomb that was time to explode
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:13.800]  later after the crash had occurred but cnn is reporting that there was a third
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:17.320]  explosion that caused world trade center one to collapse
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:20.840]  within itself and then collapse on other surrounding buildings
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:24.520]  but you know it's interesting here to reflect okay cut the clip
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:27.400]  now that has been released as a result of a lawsuit
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:30.680]  brought by the journal of 9 11 studies and we'll be back
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:34.520]  after the break to explain why nist is engaged in a cover-up
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:38.840]  over this and other 9 11 evidence pertaining to how not only the twin
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:43.400]  towers but building seven were brought down by means of explosives
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:50.120]  info was money bomb com stay tuned
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:53.960]  we're on the march the empire's on the run
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:58.760]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:02.920]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:06.920]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:10.920]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:14.360]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:17.240]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:20.760]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:24.360]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:28.280]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:31.880]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:34.920]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:38.040]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:41.480]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:44.520]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my

[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:08.760]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:11.720]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:14.920]  americans at home i've determined this influence
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:18.920]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:24.120]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:28.680]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:33.400]  cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:36.600]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:39.880]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:42.840]  checkout to? today seems like nobody does care and
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:47.880]  right now in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:52.840]  yet your copy of fall of the republic on dvd at info wars.com
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:59.880]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:15.800]  it's the moneybomb marathon on friday october 15th the google search term for
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:21.080]  today is wtc collapse and just before the break we played
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:24.840]  a cbs clip from the morning of 9 11 where they
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:28.600]  state quite clearly that there was a ground level
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:34.520]  explosion that caused world trade center one to collapse on top of itself
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:37.960]  so we have the mainstream media reporting what the
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:43.880]  hard scientific evidence nine years later now proves
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:47.160]  so we have the characteristics of the building collapse
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:50.600]  directly indicating controlled demolition we have the
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:53.960]  official reports the first reports on the scene just
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:58.920]  has happened with the oklahoma city bombing about secondary explosions
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:01.960]  being responsible for the collapse of the building
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.640]  so what were the firefighters who were actually
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:09.400]  inside the lobby of the twin towers shortly before
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:14.280]  their collapse also saying at the same time play the clip
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:20.600]  what happened he's in the explosion he's in the lobby the third explosion the whole
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.280]  lobby collapsed on us what was it like what was it like
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:28.360]  horrible it's like hell you don't want to know the whole building just collapsed
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:32.600]  inside the lobby is that a secondary explosion yes it was that was the plan
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:35.880]  yeah definitely secondary explosion we was inside waiting to go upstairs
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:38.680]  and on the way upstairs the whole thing blew
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:41.640]  and we just just collapsed on the way inside the lobby similar to the first
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:44.280]  tower coming down second I don't know about the first one but I know the
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:47.880]  second was terrible then it was a third one too after that one
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:51.960]  explosion after that that's right everybody was inside the building
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:55.720]  waiting to go upstairs and they just they just let loose everything just let
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:59.720]  loose inside the building so what would you tell me cut the clip
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:04.200]  so the characteristics of the collapse the hard scientific evidence
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:08.520]  and the very firefighters on the scene every one of them screams controlled
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:11.880]  demolition and then you take the testimony
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:16.600]  from all the WTC janitorial workers William Rodriguez
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:20.760]  Anthony Salta Machia Kenneth Johanneman Marlene Cruz
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:26.280]  Philip Morelli all of them described basement explosions in the twin towers
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:31.000]  both before and after the planes hit but there there's a reason you haven't
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.040]  heard or seen these last two videos that we
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:37.560]  played in the nine plus years since the attacks
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:40.920]  and that's because NIST the organization that was tasked
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:44.600]  with investigating the collapse of the twin towers
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:48.680]  sat on them blocked them dragged their feet on releasing them
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:52.760]  even in defiance of a freedom of information act request
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:56.520]  the journal for 9-11 studies had to file a lawsuit
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:02.280]  merely to get these videos released and why was NIST so keen on keeping them
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:05.720]  out of the public domain because every single
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:10.200]  clip that we've had the chance to study over the past two weeks
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:14.120]  that has been released as part of this three terabyte
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:17.960]  data pack of photographic and video evidence
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:21.000]  that was forced by the lawsuit to be released
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  has contained direct evidence of controlled demolition
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.760]  and indeed on several video clips which are posted up
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:32.040]  at the bottom of the story you can link to the previous stories
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:36.360]  on our feature article today on prismplanet.com
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:40.360]  these clips show evidence of NIST actually editing out
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:44.200]  the collapse of the penthouse on world trade center seven
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:50.520]  they show NIST editing out the audio of the collapse of world trade center seven
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:54.840]  in the immediate moment preceding its collapse
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:58.600]  we have clear evidence that NIST does only not only engage in a cover-up but
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:02.840]  also tampered with evidence remember they sat on this for months
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:06.760]  they had to be sued they had to have the threat of a lawsuit against them before
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:10.840]  they could release this so let's talk about building seven
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.680]  the 47-story structure that was not hit by a plane
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:19.720]  had limited fires over eight floors yet collapsed almost within its own footprint
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:23.560]  at freefall speed on the afternoon of 9-11 the NIST
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:27.400]  reports concluded that world trade center seven collapsed
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:33.320]  as a result of the never before observed quote new phenomenon of thermal
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:38.360]  expansion never before observed in the history of building fires
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:42.280]  we've seen similar sized buildings in madrid china
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:45.080]  elsewhere in different places around the world suffer
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:50.520]  raging fires for 24 hours or more and they didn't succumb to quote
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:54.760]  thermal expansion but on this one day in history
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:59.720]  we're told it happened for the first and the only time in the nine years since
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:03.880]  the attacks of 9-11 now if you're engaged in a cover-up
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:07.080]  and you're determined to come to a preset conclusion
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:12.680]  any evidence pertaining to explosives contributing to the collapse of WTC seven
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:17.320]  has to be kept out of the report and even after they were forced to release
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:21.640]  these videos they edited out the audio of the collapse
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:26.200]  of world trade center seven and now you're going to see why here's
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.720]  another video that NIST fought tooth and nail to
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:33.320]  prevent from becoming public see if you can guess why
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:38.360]  and this is an eyewitness video footage of building seven from about a dozen
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:54.280]  blocks away before it's collapsed play the third clip
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:12.920]  last explosion was something with this uh now there's a lot of police activity
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:19.480]  and sirens and and uh more smoke rising from the ground
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:23.880]  new smoke so there was some kind of additional explosion but i don't know
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:29.080]  what it was definitely smoke rising from the ground
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:32.600]  maybe it was a federal building or something like that
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:46.600]  okay okay so we got pretty late
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:55.960]  it's now 11 o'clock
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:03.480]  it's still here continuing explosions but
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:06.440]  i don't know what it is
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:34.440]  there's a lot of smoke
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:44.440]  it's another explosion
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:50.280]  now what you just heard was an eyewitness by the name of Richard Peskin
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:55.080]  describing continuous explosions from the direction of building seven
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:59.080]  and if you watch the youtube video there's numerous explosions
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:02.600]  including a particularly loud one which you probably picked up near the end
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:06.280]  there at the 149 mark in the video
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:11.320]  so why did NIST try to block this video from being released it's not as if it's
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.800]  showing anything sensitive it's filmed from a good
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:17.400]  dozen blocks away from a high-rise building
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:22.120]  because again it contains evidence in regard to WTC7
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:28.120]  of explosions the very thing they're trying to keep out of the public domain
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:33.400]  now it's not just the videos NYPD officer Craig Bartmer
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:38.120]  he was running away from WTC7 at the moment of its collapse
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:41.480]  and what did he hear quote boom boom boom boom boom
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:45.320]  I know an explosion when I hear it what did former
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:50.200]  Air Force special operations for search and rescue officer Kevin Mcpadden
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:55.000]  and numerous others here and were told immediately before the collapse of
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.600]  World Trade Center seven a demolition style countdown
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:04.440]  preceding the destruction of the building every single video backs up the
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:08.200]  fact that seven was brought down by explosives in this
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:13.720]  three terabyte data release from NIST if it doesn't show that then it shows
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:17.480]  them editing things out like the collapse of the penthouse
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:20.760]  like the audio track from a close-up video
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:26.040]  as WTC7 collapsed so you combine this
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:29.560]  and every single video we've looked at in the past two weeks points in the same
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:32.520]  direction you combine it with the new study
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:35.880]  by the University of Copenhagen concerning
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:40.040]  the discovery of these highly explosive chips of oxide and aluminium
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:43.400]  particles in the World Trade Center dust
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:48.120]  and they say they're identical to energetic materials developed and man-made
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:51.400]  in US laboratories in the years preceding 9-11
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:55.560]  you add this to the thermite you add this to the rivers of molten steel
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:43:00.600]  that the firefighters reported that NIST refused to even acknowledge existed
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:04.040]  even though numerous firefighters testified to them
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:09.320]  photographic evidence video evidence doesn't exist said NIST
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:13.080]  the time I mean the time for denial is over we've got so much evidence of
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:17.160]  controlled demolition we're swimming in it and the problem is Watson Alex Jones
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:21.320]  here popping back in line during this historic 27-hour transmission
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:25.720]  is we haven't really gotten into BBC getting the Reuters internal release that
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:30.360]  WTC7 had fallen in its own footprint 25 minutes before it did
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:34.200]  we haven't even gotten into all the other evidence and buried Jennings I mean it
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:37.560]  just goes on and on and local newscast saying
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:40.920]  they're going to blow up seven well how'd they plant bombs in a supposed
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:43.080]  burning building and now we're talking about the other
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:47.000]  towers and all the witnesses they did it the only question is is the
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.120]  public have the courage to face it and that's why this radio show is so
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:53.560]  important before 9-11 on the day of 9-11
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:57.640]  I came out told the truth put the info out this platform is so
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:00.760]  key not just to expose the past but when they do
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:04.200]  other stuff and we're really having a big effect that's why I want to thank
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:08.520]  everybody that's calling 888-25-33139 for the
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:17.560]  info wars moneybomb.com operation again 888-25-33139 or infowarsmoneybomb.com
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:19.960]  now you got a lot of callers Paul I'm gonna let you get on to the news and
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:22.680]  them and then with the Chapman take calls on the economy and
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:25.480]  everything that's happening plus wiki leaks you know they're terrorists though
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:29.400]  we're shutting down their their websites you know link to getting money
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:32.600]  I mean I mean this is really getting wild what's going on here but
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:36.520]  here we are just covering the facts the emperors and new clothes
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:39.800]  he's absolutely naked in front of everybody and
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:43.320]  it's just it's just it's painful to admit we have a murdering terrorist running
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:46.600]  things but I mean it's painful admit most the mortgages are frauds and fakes
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:49.480]  it's painful admit they're stealing the dead and dying veterans death
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:51.560]  benefits it's painful to admit they're putting
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.360]  bisphenol in everything it's painful to admit they're putting mercury in the
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:57.960]  shots and telling us it's good for our kids it's painful but it's the truth
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:01.480]  and things are only going to get more painful in the real world if we don't
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:05.080]  face the pain and admit what's going on and say no
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:08.680]  to this culture of a bunch of people that roll over to everything
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:12.840]  and it's like a national and global religion to be gullible idiots and to
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:15.960]  buy into whatever the tv and the government tells you I mean come on
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:19.320]  folks you know there's no greater concentration of
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:23.720]  criminals and scumbags and psychopaths and sociopaths and control freaks and
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:27.160]  perverts and weirdos and and larcenist scum
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:32.440]  than in government and the fortune 100 okay and as long as you're in naive
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:35.800]  atta they're going to keep winning so everybody send a strong message to the
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:39.320]  globalist let's hit 500 000 today we're very close info war
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:44.280]  was moneybomb.com and search this key term three letters
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:48.120]  together as an abbreviation uh or compound what would be the abbreviation
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:53.000]  or compound uh what abbreviation
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.440]  wtc three words i mean three letters together
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:46:03.080]  wtc collapse two words wtc and collapse into google over and over again
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:06.520]  and see how they like that i mean we're you know the globalist have gone past
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:09.720]  the point of return so why shouldn't they go completely nuts to steal everything
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:13.480]  and blow stuff up we passing over a point of return why shouldn't we defeat
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:17.000]  these people wtc collapse searching on google god

[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:27.160]  callers waiting in the wings uh sure they'll have
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:30.680]  vital information for us and then we have uh
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:34.440]  bob what's funny wants it a lot of callers are great but i mean they may ask
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:42.120]  you why you're in league with uh the uh with colonel sanders but the point is
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:46.200]  i shouldn't screw around folks i want to commend everybody wonderful job back to
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:51.640]  paul watson joining us from red codistan thank you paul
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:55.560]  that's right but the point i wanted to make was um
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:47:00.280]  you know with the the platform that we were able to grow as a result of uh
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:04.280]  prison planet dot tv members and previous money bombs
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:09.000]  enhanced the profile of uh 9 11 truth groups like we are changed and they
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.240]  were able to uh get themselves in the in the media especially with
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:17.800]  regard to supporting 9 11 first responders firefighters
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:21.800]  who had these health claims because of the government's lie in the very hours
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:25.160]  after the attack that the air was safe to breathe
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:28.600]  and now after nine years of people saying oh they're never going to get
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:32.040]  compensation just yesterday a judge ordered that
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:35.640]  they would be paid an additional 47 and a half million
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:40.200]  compensation to what they've already received so after nine years of pressing
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:44.920]  on that front um the 9 11 first responders are finally getting
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:49.240]  some form of compensation only half the battle's done obviously but it just goes
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:53.400]  to show that a 9 11 investigation can come
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:57.480]  through this uh exposure of not only the videos released by
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:01.400]  niss but the hardcore scientific evidence that has now emerged
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:05.400]  of these explosive particles in the dust of the world trade center
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:10.440]  so you know let's not allow it to take 50 years like it did with tonkin or the
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:13.800]  Reichstag fire to the truth to be confirmed
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:17.160]  we're coming up on the 10th anniversary next year let's make the 10th
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:22.200]  anniversary the year in which a new independent 9 11 investigation
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:26.520]  is achieved we achieved the compensation with the help of 9 11
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:30.520]  truth groups for the first responders so let's get a new 9 11
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:35.880]  investigation launched in 2011 we got tons of
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:38.680]  callers waiting in the wings so we're going to go to some now
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:45.080]  um steven in miss yori i think it is steven you're on the air
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:50.440]  hello yes steven what's on your mind today

[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:13.240]  working hard on my end here we're uh you guys have inspired
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:17.560]  some colleagues in mind uh myself to put together an alternative media
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:21.640]  publication and um this this new video footage man
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:25.000]  that you just put out here that's that they've finally uncovered after nine
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.920]  years is groundbreaking uh towards the truth movement and
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:32.520]  it's just it's so inspiring to see just how many callers are calling in to
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:36.200]  support the money bomb and i mean let's come on everybody let's get that
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:38.280]  five hundred a thousand mark and let's get some
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:41.960]  high quality equipment in here and and get the army moving forward we are the
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:45.400]  army we the people we need to bring that back
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:49.720]  that's exactly right and i mean yeah every single video i've looked at from
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:53.640]  this nist release which happened uh you know about a month ago every
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:58.040]  single video that comes out has controlled demolition in it
[01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:01.320]  there's no wonder why they sat on it for that amount of time
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:05.000]  in defiance of this foia request and the lawsuit
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.880]  because obviously they were trying to hide something they were engaged in a

[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:48.440]  millions more people we had a caller just before the
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:52.680]  break Dave in Chile who was talking about geoengineering and i mean
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:56.600]  this is becoming more and more public on a daily basis we know
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:00.200]  that the people running this geoengineering program
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:04.200]  are talking about terraforming the atmosphere by distributing
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:08.920]  sulfur particles in the atmosphere via jet engines
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:11.960]  now go and research the effect that sulfur has
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:16.120]  on the human body on the immune system and then you might
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:20.680]  come to a conclusion as to why the people running it like John P. Holdren
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:24.360]  the eugenicist are also the people interested in
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:28.440]  putting sterilants in your water supply
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:33.720]  sulfur particles lower the reaction of the immune system to keep out disease
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:38.440]  that's just one of the bad health side effects of geoengineering
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:41.160]  and these people have said they're going to do it obviously
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:45.880]  with these scientific programs being always more advanced than they allow
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:49.240]  the public arena to know of we can be assured that
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:53.480]  the jet trails that stay in the air for literally two hours
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:57.000]  are not part of a natural process and i know
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.840]  personally because i live basically right on the flight path of Birmingham
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:05.560]  airport i see them coming over every five minutes
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:10.520]  and normal jet trails are supposed to disappear after five minutes behind the
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:13.960]  plane they don't hang in the air for hours and form
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:17.640]  mass cloud systems that block out the sun and when you've got these kind of
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:21.160]  people talking about erecting spaceships in the upper
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:26.280]  atmosphere to block out the sun in the name of stopping global warming
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:31.400]  you know nothing is beyond them truly the mad scientists have taken control of
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:35.320]  our environment in pursuit of this neo eugenicist
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:40.680]  agenda davin chili finish up what you were saying before the break
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:44.440]  yeah i just wanted to mention the fact that what woke me up
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:51.160]  was wtc7.net back in 2003 it was a real eye opener
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:55.400]  and you know i meet a lot of tourists down here in chili
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:57:01.720]  and i always ask him this question on september the 11th 2001
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:08.360]  how many buildings fell and they always always always say two
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:13.160]  and i tell them no it was three the third building
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:17.560]  was 47 stories tall that's almost as tall
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:21.240]  as the tallest buildings in toronto i don't know what
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:26.600]  what's the tallest building in in the uk right now it's probably the
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:31.720]  bt tower or the gurkid in london which aren't really even as big as wtc7
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:36.920]  like you said in any major city that would dominate the skyline
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:44.040]  now how the devil does a 47 story tall building fall like that and the other
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:48.360]  thing that really struck me and i saw your article on the prismplanet.com
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:53.400]  where it had the videos where it shows that they ended out the penthouse
[01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:58.040]  now why the devil did they do that you know it really makes you i want to ask
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:02.200]  some questions about what's going on in these people's minds at nist
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:07.880]  and also it brings to mind the idea of what is going on in the mind of the
[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:12.920]  average american when they say to me oh only two building
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:17.480]  buildings fell and oh you're making it up and why would the government do it
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:23.160]  you know it's obvious why because they want control
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:26.760]  you're right i mean building seven is the key to 9 11 truth
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:31.240]  we'll be back after the break tommy noel in illinois stay there your calls

[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:15.400]  oh well you know it's funny we're playing a Britney Spears clip just a second ago
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:19.400]  and that's something that i don't know what the music scene
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:24.120]  in the uk is like i'm sure you know how awful it is here in america
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:28.840]  and i was wondering if um yeah i just want your opinion on
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:33.560]  just a just a quick thing here over over in england in the 70s of course we had
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:38.760]  the punk scene uh the sex pistols which stood up in the end as a punk scene in
[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:42.200]  london or in england all over the uk stood up to the national
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:46.760]  front racism things of that nature and out of control government
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:51.960]  a uh oh gosh i think the employment rate amongst the youth was close to 75
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:56.200]  percent unemployed from uh 18 to 25 i believe was the
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:02:01.480]  statistics in 78 and uh i wonder if uh just your opinion on
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:05.800]  since that since that scene since the punk scene in england
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:09.320]  uh new york and then what ended up spawning a great scene over in san
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:12.040]  francisco i don't know how much you like punk rock or not
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:18.040]  but i wonder if uh just your opinion on since since that time um
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:23.640]  there has been very few relevant bands hit the mainstream with anything to say
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:27.720]  anything on the ball and here we are eight years of
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:32.280]  eight years of bush two years of sataro nine years of war
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:37.160]  uh under clinton it's uh 17 years of bombing
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:43.160]  and you know and and nobody's got anything to say about it nobody cares
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:46.520]  and uh i wonder if uh i just wondering your opinion on
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:50.840]  with the consolidation of media if that's definitely uh something to it and
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:53.880]  if the independent music scene is starting to rise up
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:58.520]  like out there out of out in the uk again uh seems like y'all start everything
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:03.480]  good um including the revolutionary war um
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:07.800]  you know i just wonder what's your opinion on that and will we ever see
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:12.520]  did people rise up out of the stupor uh musically
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:19.560]  artistically and finally stand up and and use their music and their talent
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:24.920]  and their uh to inspire the way johnny rotten inspired me a 14-year-old
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:29.640]  redneck from the middle of missouri to get smarter to go to work
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:34.600]  to to to you know to be more you know and i just wonder what your opinion on
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:38.520]  that and i say thanks a lot and uh everybody contribute i'll
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:43.320]  contribute 25 more dollars at patriot 1776 on the message board to use lower

[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:52.520]  thanks a lot thanks appreciate it yeah i mean as you said from my
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:56.440]  perspective the uh underground anti-establishment music
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:04:00.600]  scene has never gone away it's always been there since the 60s
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:05.400]  the only difference nowadays is that as you said the media consolidation is so
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:10.440]  tight that those underground artists you know especially in the rap genre of
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:13.800]  which there are tons and tons people like paris
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:17.640]  they just don't get the attention people only buy what's shoved in front of
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:23.560]  their faces by mtv which is this vulgar transhumanist crap
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:27.720]  like lady gargar Beyonce and all the rest of it
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:31.080]  which is designed to keep them locked into this
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:37.160]  slave-like mentality where their entire culture is based around frivolous
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:41.080]  nothingness and meaningless sex that's basically how they've tried to control
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:43.880]  an entire generation of young people with this bad
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:48.600]  build-up on system through music and the entertainment history

[02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:07.880]  again on friday and it's nice being with you for change
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:11.640]  good to have you here bob now what i want to talk about
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:15.720]  is basically one of the most important topics right now which is being
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:18.520]  completely ignored by the corporate media
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:23.240]  as they obsess as you know about the rescue of chili and miners and whatever
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:27.960]  other distractions are going on and this is foreclosure gate
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:32.280]  the revelation that predatory lending institutions
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:35.640]  were aggressively signing people up for mortgages
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:38.920]  that they knew they couldn't pay in order to
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:44.520]  bundle and securitize them and set sell them on seven ways to sunday as
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:50.120]  triple a rated but what in reality were junk investments
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:55.240]  and i mean bob the happy clappers on cmbc are pointing at the
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:10:00.440]  11 000 stock market as a sign that everything's hunky dory
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:04.040]  but people are saying that this foreclosure gate could be the final
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:07.800]  nail in the u.s economy that it could cause
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:12.120]  thousands of financial institutions to collapse what's your take
[02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:19.240]  on foreclosure gate well you people have covered it pretty good
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:25.720]  but i think um first of all they're going to hold it
[02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:31.160]  off the radar screen until after the election if they can
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:35.480]  um i rather think they got caught blindsided on this one
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:40.920]  and uh i didn't think i don't think they thought that the
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:46.120]  public or the court system would catch up on to what they had done
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:50.520]  i reported over three years ago that
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:56.600]  this was a dastardly mess uh... the rating agencies all lied about the
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:59.400]  ratings they said they were triple a and they were triple b which is a
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:04.840]  difference between a ten and a four and the ten being triple a
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:09.720]  and the packaging was helter skelter
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:13.640]  and in the meantime since then
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:19.400]  these collateralized debt obligations which are the bonds in which the
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:23.320]  the mortgages are housed packaged they call them
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:28.920]  tranche and goodness knows an original might have
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:34.120]  been traded a hundred times or more since it came about
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:38.760]  and so they knew what they were doing and they were making a lot of money
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:43.080]  and uh they didn't care about the consequences later
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:46.520]  so here we are approximately three years later and finally
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:50.840]  people have got through the court system and the court system is said well
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:54.280]  uh at least in the case of this one federal judge that
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:58.280]  uh you can't do that and you don't have to
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:01.400]  pay until we find out who actually owns this thing
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:05.640]  and who have you been paying money to and what have they been doing with it
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:10.520]  and uh it's interesting coming out of uh florida whereas
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:14.440]  another judge is florida and florida is just not even reading them and
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:17.880]  batting them through you know like one a minute
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:23.240]  that is foreclosures and so uh they're going to try to keep this out of the
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:27.640]  news as much as they can uh what has been done is
[02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:33.960]  egregious uh it's criminal and uh i'm waiting to see
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:37.960]  what becomes of it like everybody else uh are
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:42.520]  experienced with the court system has been dreadful
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:46.760]  uh they do what they want to do in behalf of those who
[02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:53.560]  are behind government and control it and so i think uh there's a good chance
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:58.840]  we could we could have prosecutions here and is a good chance
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:03.480]  especially with 50 attorney generals getting involved
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:10.280]  that perhaps there may be charges and if there are charges
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:14.040]  could the system come down and the answers yes so
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:18.920]  we're not going to know until we get there but it is deplorable
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:22.600]  i mean that that's the risk precisely if
[02:13:22.600 --> 02:13:27.160]  you know these charges do come down and uh people completely lose faith in
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:30.920]  mortgages they don't even know who owns their
[02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:34.760]  mortgage and they think that there's a pretty good possibility
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:39.000]  that if they just stop paying for their mortgage that nobody's going to come
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.080]  after them because of the mass confusion that this has created
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:47.560]  then i mean this could completely topple everything do you think that
[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:51.880]  people are genuinely going to go down that route and just say well
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:55.560]  i'm going to take this risk and just stop paying my mortgage because
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:59.640]  this foreclosure thing is just going to topple over completely is that going to
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:04.520]  be the case it could be but what you must do first
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:09.160]  is you must go to the people who you are paying
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:15.000]  and ask to see the mortgage and if they tell you that they don't have it it's
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:20.040]  over in timbuktu and um they're just collecting for the
[02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:24.680]  international timbuktu corporation bank uh then
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:31.320]  you might stop paying because let's say you paid the house off
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:36.200]  how could you get the deed it's a good question
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:40.200]  if they don't know where it is i mean who does know where it is
[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:47.480]  i mean is it packaged in some uh a bs system or bond
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:53.640]  that nobody knows where it is and it might take six months to find it
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:57.800]  and then you have to unravel the whole bond
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:02.200]  thousands and thousands of mortgages to find this one
[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:08.280]  these banks don't have any records to speak of and they did that deliberately
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:12.680]  if they ever get into this mess and that's what they're in to now
[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:16.520]  so the the attorney generals have to be aggressive
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:21.720]  and they have to say look we want to see everything what's it going to cost
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:25.400]  if nothing happens to the lenders
[02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:29.560]  a minimum of ten billion dollars
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:36.440]  they're talking in the financial publications of five or six billion
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:41.160]  it's going to cost more than that and the banks are going to get hurt by it
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:44.920]  that's where their shares are down yesterday and today
[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:48.360]  and that's understandable it's a fair amount of money and it's going to
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:54.600]  affect earnings uh yesterday uh we saw jp morgan chase
[02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:58.760]  trading over 40 it's now close to 37
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:02.920]  so people on wall street are taking this very seriously
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:06.760]  they're saying gee where the heck is this all going
[02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:12.600]  and maybe it will threaten our system in fact
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:19.480]  this is a kind of thing that unexpectedly the
[02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:26.680]  untoward event that nobody ever expects will happen then does
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:33.960]  and that's how banking systems collapse it's just something out of the blue
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:39.160]  these bankers never thought they were going to get caught well they did
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:45.640]  and can they wiggle out we'll see but it's going to cost them a lot of money
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:49.480]  and it's going to enrage the public even more than it's
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:54.440]  enraged already and especially going into an election
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:17:00.200]  couldn't have came out at a worse time particularly for incumbents
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:05.160]  and so we got away to a while it's just like
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:09.800]  the proposed legislation that they want to shove down our
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:15.640]  throats on taking out
[02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:22.280]  retirement plans for people and giving them a government guaranteed
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:27.320]  annuity and which is not worth the paper it's written on
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:30.120]  they're going to try that before the end of the year
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:33.720]  and also within that structure they're trying to
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:40.280]  and will try to inject a five percent mandatory payroll tax
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:44.280]  to further fund social security which is broke and has been
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:49.240]  since its inception and there's a whole bunch of other issues
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:57.080]  they want to put a one percent tax on financial transactions including
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:18:01.080]  if you sent me a check and i put it in the bank
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:07.000]  they would charge one percent just to have the check come into the bank
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.520]  they charge you one percent the other end as well
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:13.960]  and they they would like to get that passed to
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:19.080]  continue to fund this outrageous deficit spending that's been going on for
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:23.560]  years and and then there's a whole block
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:27.800]  of things that the administration wants
[02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:31.640]  two hundred billion in tax credits for business
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:35.800]  for plant and equipment a hundred billion dollars for big business
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:40.360]  for research i mean those two group that group
[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:43.800]  with those two issues is ludicrous because
[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:47.080]  they're sitting on three trillion dollars in cash
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:50.760]  i mean they need money or a break tax wise
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:55.560]  like they need a hole in the head what they ought to do is stop firing people
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:19:01.320]  and then we wouldn't have 22 and three quarter percent unemployment
[02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:05.960]  and then they're going to try to get 50 billion dollars
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:09.400]  passed in infrastructure and they'll probably get that
[02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:13.080]  because it puts people to work and Bob i mean going
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:17.960]  going back to the pensions um i've noticed all this propaganda in recent
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:23.080]  days from people like MSNBC saying that it would be stupid and foolish for
[02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:26.840]  americans to cash in on their pensions early to
[02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:30.120]  fund things like you know their kids going through college
[02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:33.720]  but you know if we're going to see what's unfolding in europe right now which is
[02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:37.320]  the riot police cracking people's heads because they're
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:41.720]  angry and incensed over a two-year rise in the retirement age
[02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:45.800]  then i mean it makes perfect sense for americans to try and get their pensions
[02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:49.960]  out now because in two years there may be nothing left whatsoever if the
[02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:53.400]  government's talking about seizing them and confiscating them in
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:56.360]  this manner uh we'll talk about it after the break

[02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:03.560]  most americans believe famine and hunger will never happen

[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:50.120]  before the break the rage um in relation to the uh possible confiscation of
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:55.000]  private 401k pensions which uh the government was having hearings on
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:58.360]  last week today we're seeing people in france
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:02.760]  throwing rocks at riot police we've seen the greeks engaged in
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:07.320]  running street battles what do you think the u.s government will do if the
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:10.600]  middle classes of america as virtually everyone
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:15.640]  is now predicting hit the streets and begin to engage in a similar kind of
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:20.040]  widespread civil disobedience what's going to happen
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:22.920]  well i think it eventually will come to that
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:28.040]  um we have to wait to see after the election
[02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:35.640]  uh what form any legislation takes and this could be a last gasp
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:42.360]  by the current administration while they still have the
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:47.240]  approving warm bodies there to pass this kind of legislation
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:51.320]  i mean you saw what happened to the the health care bill
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:55.400]  and uh of the financial regulation two bills that should have never been
[02:25:55.400 --> 02:26:00.200]  passed but were and and uh you're going to see
[02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:05.720]  the same fight develop uh over this and they're going to try to ram it through
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:09.880]  because it's a good opportunity for them to do that and they may never
[02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:13.880]  uh get as good an opportunity again and they'll go after
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:18.120]  the one percent tax and uh they'll go after the
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:23.960]  what the administration thinks they need to keep the economy going in in the way
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:29.800]  of uh stimulus we'll call it and and so if this sort of legislation is
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:33.640]  passed most everybody out there doesn't know
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:37.320]  that it's pending only a handful of people
[02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:40.680]  uh we talk about it here on this station and
[02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:44.120]  i've talked about it in others and of course in my publication
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:48.440]  but there's only a handful of publications have even picked up on it
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:54.760]  and what i'm afraid of here is for lack of knowledge this thing could come up
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:58.440]  and they get a party line vote they could get it passed
[02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:02.680]  and it'll be devastating because people have individually
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:08.520]  anywhere from fifteen thousand to a million dollars in IRAs
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:12.280]  and 401ks and some of them are seen over in the millions
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:16.920]  not many and i do see lots of that sort of thing because people come to me
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:20.680]  and ask advice which we don't charge for and so lots of
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:24.840]  lots of people want uh my opinion on things and
[02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:30.360]  so all of this would be lost because you're getting a government promise in
[02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:33.320]  return and that promise is not what the paper
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:36.360]  it's written on because the government's broke
[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:39.960]  and i mean how can they have the arrogance i mean people like
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:44.520]  gilarducci you know the architects of all this the senators behind it
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:49.160]  kasey sanders and harkin you know where do they get off on just calmly
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:54.760]  introduced in a piece of legislation that robs people of their entire future
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:58.040]  their children's inheritance with you know
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:01.880]  barely a care in the world i mean should americans
[02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:04.840]  just liquidate their pensions immediately i mean i know there's a bunch
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:09.560]  of taxes associated with it but would you advise people to do that just to
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:14.680]  avoid having them stolen completely well first of all
[02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:17.800]  no matter what you do you're going to pay taxes
[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:21.400]  whether you cash it in and it exists eight years from now
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:25.960]  or now i mean hopefully you'll pay more taxes later
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:31.080]  because it appreciated in value but the point is here you got to pay taxes
[02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:37.480]  so that is not even a consideration the consideration is twofold
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:42.120]  number one if you're under fifty nine and a half there's a ten percent penalty
[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:46.280]  but if you take the risk and they pass this legislation
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:49.800]  you're going to end up with a worthless piece of paper
[02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:56.680]  so me personally my feeling is if i had an ira
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:29:02.040]  or a 401k i would liquidate it i would pay the taxes
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:06.840]  and i would pay the penalty if i was under fifty nine and a half
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:11.720]  and which i'm not incidentally i'll be seventy five tomorrow
[02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:19.320]  and uh... i think that that the to me the most prudent thing to do
[02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:23.720]  uh... is is going to liquidation and
[02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:27.240]  you can you can do that in a semi painless way
[02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:32.360]  if you have an ira or 401k and you get stocks in it
[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:39.000]  in order to not have to pay commission you can set up a personal account
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:45.960]  and transfer those securities into it it's a it's a it's a taxable event
[02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:51.800]  but you're avoiding two steps okay we'll talk about it after we're on the march
[02:29:51.800 --> 02:30:00.040]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.040 --> 02:30:03.240]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:30:03.240 --> 02:30:07.240]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:30:07.240 --> 02:30:11.000]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:14.600]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:17.560]  it's true total government control of electricity
[02:30:17.560 --> 02:30:21.080]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:24.680]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:28.600]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:30:28.600 --> 02:30:32.120]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:35.240]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:38.280]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:41.800]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the

[02:33:27.240 --> 02:33:30.120]  again to Bob Chapman in a moment taking your calls
[02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:34.120]  Ted Anderson and Midasresources.com
[02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:38.200]  Ted welcome to the show gold's down a little today it's taken a
[02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:43.000]  breather from its gargantuan rise which is a perfect buying opportunity i would
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:46.840]  suggest on the website we've been tracking ebay
[02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:49.880]  for the past couple of weeks and it's ridiculous i mean
[02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:56.120]  they're selling american buffalos at $200 plus over spot even the us min
[02:33:56.120 --> 02:34:03.640]  you know $200 plus markup we're talking you know 1625 for a 2009
[02:34:03.640 --> 02:34:08.440]  american buffalo one ounce gold coin on ebay and not much less if you buy
[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:11.400]  through the us min of course the us min announced
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:17.400]  last week that they would be stopping restock of 2009 gold
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:21.080]  buffalo coins and that has only spurred more demand
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:27.160]  so compared to the astounding 15 percent markups that are happening on ebay at
[02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:30.680]  the moment Ted what kind of deal can you offer to
[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:35.080]  Alex Jones listeners today well the buffalo here at Genesis
[02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:39.000]  and Midasresources is obviously a lot lower than that let me just i'll pull
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:42.360]  that price up in a second but
[02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:47.480]  the the the market is just hot and and the problem
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:51.400]  is that the mint runs out of plant chats and so
[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:55.880]  you know the price gets bit up it's just you're dealing with the finite supply
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:34:58.760]  and that's just the way it is it looks to me like our
[02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:03.560]  buffalos are running right around just under $1,500 a piece
[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:06.840]  and it's not surprising to me that ebay prices are going up because
[02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:10.360]  i mean you can go to local dealers i'm not in england so i can't measure what's
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:14.280]  going on over there but there's not there's not enough supply to go around
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:16.600]  it's getting to the point where it's real scarce
[02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:20.200]  people are trying to buy they're not able to do it every now and then you run
[02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:23.240]  into this time where you know there's there's more people wanting to buy
[02:35:23.240 --> 02:35:26.040]  than there are items to go around and then of
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:30.440]  course prices go up now we did see a high today
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:38.200]  in the gold market of 1385 dollars an ounce i mean silver hit 2477
[02:35:38.200 --> 02:35:41.880]  a little bit of profit taking like you said currently right now gold
[02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:48.760]  1367 30 24 22 on the spot for silver both of those are really good
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:52.920]  buy you know one of the best books out there on
[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:56.200]  the federal and the federal reserve system is this creature from jekyll
[02:35:56.200 --> 02:35:59.400]  island and g edward griffin who was up with alex
[02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:04.600]  jones here just a short while ago just like about a week ago
[02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:08.200]  was talking about the chemtrails video that he was
[02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:12.520]  that he just put out but the the creature from jekyll island book he wrote
[02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:16.920]  a new chapter added to one of his chapters in there
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:21.880]  and it's kind of funny we had about a thousand of the old print in
[02:36:21.880 --> 02:36:26.120]  and now that's gone we have over 600 orders that we're trying to fill
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:30.040]  and the new books will be coming probably within about a week week and a half
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:33.560]  but everybody's going crazy about the fact that i'm putting a silver dollar
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:38.520]  in there i've been doing this for years we're selling this for 2645
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:43.800]  and to be able to pick up a silver dollar for 2645 even on places like evay
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:46.600]  delivered is just impossible right now
[02:36:46.600 --> 02:36:49.400]  so here you get the book you get the silver dollar the whole thing is a
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:53.400]  package but between that and the and the
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:57.960]  frank coin that we're selling right now at 299 which is a european frank you
[02:36:57.960 --> 02:37:01.640]  may have seen him over there it's a it's a coin that contains a
[02:37:01.640 --> 02:37:04.040]  fifth of an ounce of gold just short of that
[02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:09.000]  and uh at 299 you get a full year subscription to bob Chapman's newsletter
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.360]  the international forecaster it it really works well
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:16.440]  for people to get that combination because you know i'm less facet there's
[02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:20.440]  so much uh you know so much going on economically that you really need to be
[02:37:20.440 --> 02:37:24.200]  kept up on this and and and that's the other thing too i mean
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:28.440]  for me even you know alex talks about this but i even have to keep so much
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:31.880]  cash on hand to cover payroll and to do the various different things as a
[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:36.280]  company uh to uh to just operate and and i look
[02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:40.120]  at that and i go you know i'd probably be better off just keeping that in gold
[02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:43.000]  and i know there's a lot of people that have been listening out there but you
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.640]  know you've got your money deposited at the bank or your
[02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:49.160]  you're sitting in the stock market you have annua tees
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:54.520]  you know you have a 401k plan uh pension of some sort
[02:37:54.520 --> 02:37:57.800]  and you're wondering man i really should get moving on this and i
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:01.400]  i just need to say this is not a fire drill here
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:04.520]  with what's going on here in the united states this is not
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:08.120]  this is not a pretend thing or it's not the fake or those
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:12.360]  you know a dry run here we're really watching the united states dollar fall
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:16.280]  to pieces and uh and legislation that makes you
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:20.440]  you know should send chills down your spine if you have any assets at all
[02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:24.760]  people really need to get into gold and silver now and uh so the thing to do is
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:33.800]  to call us at 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:37.640]  ask for that cbo report that the congress put out talks about what the
[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:41.960]  what they're up to it really makes a plain and clear sense about what's going
[02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:44.920]  on pick up a copy of the international forecaster
[02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:48.520]  pick up the frank uh you know and and and the other thing i haven't
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:51.080]  really had a chance to put a plug in here for alex either
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:55.960]  but it's so very important very very important even if it's one dollar
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:39:00.920]  to go over to uh the info wars money bomb dot com
[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:04.920]  and and and and make a donation i mean make a difference i mean alex has been
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:11.640]  working all these years to do you know bring forth the issues that he has
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:15.880]  it wouldn't be there if it wasn't for him this guy has had more charisma
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:20.600]  and has had a bigger impact and anybody that have worked with in the
[02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:23.640]  entire industry and i've been sitting here trying to do the
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:28.280]  same thing he has and he's just he's got a knack for it and i really i really
[02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:32.600]  must say if you have even an extra dollar make sure you donate it to him
[02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:38.280]  because it's just it's gonna it's gonna make such a big difference so
[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:43.000]  i mean it's amazing to me just 10 years ago when i started listening to alex on
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:47.080]  gcn i heard your adverts and at that time
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:53.080]  gold was about what 300 or even less i mean it's touching 1400
[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:56.920]  it's almost parabolic and it's only going higher
[02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:59.480]  we're going to move on to call us now thanks ted

[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:26.120]  just real quick things i read on the internet

[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:39.080]  web then i want to get to my question on drudge report said soldier testifies
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:45.560]  he was ordered to delete fort hood videos from a cell phone
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:50.200]  on a huffington post you know uh the drug launder
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:57.960]  well fargo won't halt foreclosures even though employee approved 500 foreclosures
[02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:06.200]  without reading the paperwork um and that toxic chemical reform collapses as
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:10.440]  industry fluxes its muscles and on raw story it says
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:17.000]  there's an ebb quote unquote epidemic half of us teens have mental disorders
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:21.640]  but yeah i saw that we posted that today uh send those articles to me
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:25.320]  uh what's in a prison planet dot com and i'll get them posted uh what's your
[02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:31.160]  question for bob today okay i'm on i'm on a fixed income i'm i'm on
[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:37.800]  disability and i only get uh i get less than 450
[02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:44.120]  dollars a month and um i get i ordered some uh
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:47.720]  some of those walking coins like 11 of those uh
[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:57.000]  walking half dollars from uh from uh gcn but what what what do i do
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:03.240]  about try i mean i'm i'm living with having to live with my folks
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:07.000]  and it's hard to try to get them to understand what's going on even though
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:11.720]  they realize it and i'm really worried i i want to
[02:42:11.720 --> 02:42:18.040]  stock up on food and what what can i do to get them to
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:24.040]  realize it's it's getting it's going to get really really really bad
[02:42:24.040 --> 02:42:30.920]  bob Chapman i think um
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:35.880]  there's so many people who are in a position that you're in
[02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:41.960]  and uh it it it used to leave people speechless but it doesn't anymore
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:46.120]  and real unemployment uh even if you are able to work is up to 22 and three
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:50.280]  quarter percent and so you know you might have a job
[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:57.000]  anyway um i think you you have to do the best you
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:01.960]  can with what you've got uh there's no more money that's going to be coming
[02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:05.560]  to you and i think you're fortunate to be able to
[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:11.400]  live with your parents because um otherwise what would you do
[02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:16.760]  i know and i was wondering if it would be good to put maybe half
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:21.720]  you know i'm not how do i put this would it be a good
[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:27.080]  idea to put maybe half of that money that i get from social security because i
[02:43:27.080 --> 02:43:32.440]  also get food stamps but half of that invest that into a
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:37.160]  silver or maybe some gold if that's a possibility would that be a good idea
[02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:41.880]  hey yes it would be a good idea but i i i didn't know that you were able to save
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:44.280]  money out of that which i think is phenomenal
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:49.240]  i think it's important too uh that you speak with your mother and father
[02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:54.200]  about having food put away dehydrated and freeze dried foods and
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:58.600]  and have a water filter and hopefully something that you can defend your
[02:43:58.600 --> 02:44:04.360]  family with uh some nasty things happen uh those are very important things too
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:10.360]  but the coins are as well needless to say okay thanks for the call steven uh
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:13.480]  we're going to move on yeah basically i mean most people
[02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:17.240]  can't even afford to buy gold they've been financially raped to such an
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:20.600]  extent but it's about becoming as self-sufficient as
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:23.320]  possible you know if you if you can't afford gold
[02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:26.280]  silver is a lot cheaper if you can't afford that then
[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:29.640]  just storeable food growing your own food and trying to become
[02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:33.480]  as uh immune to the economic collapse as it's possible
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:37.880]  within your means we're going to move on to knoll in illinois knoll you're on the
[02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:41.480]  air go ahead hey how you doing paul i'm going to
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:45.880]  send as much money as i can uh through the mail for the money bomb
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:49.480]  uh alex the the entire crew i can't say enough words about how
[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:53.400]  great of a job you guys do and it's an honor to speak with bob chatman uh
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:56.520]  before i get to my question about um i've been trying to get a hold of you
[02:44:56.520 --> 02:45:01.640]  guys for a while i go to the same university uh that uh doctor
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:04.920]  doug rocky uh dr du went to and i'm trying to
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:08.680]  i'm trying to hunt him down to see if i can get an interview with him my school
[02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:12.040]  is a huge uh rotc military institution we're the
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:15.880]  only military non-military university to have a military nickname
[02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:19.400]  if anyone in the crew if i could stay on hold after i'm done here
[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:23.080]  talk to someone possibly get that it'd be great i'm trying to wake up
[02:45:23.080 --> 02:45:27.960]  as uh as many of our future soldiers and officers as possible uh
[02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:34.760]  bob my question to you uh is uh the way you see gold and silver can
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:40.840]  continue to rise uh what what do you think is in the mind of the elite like
[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:45.160]  george soros who looks i can't even describe what george soros really looks
[02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:48.120]  like but what do you think those uh those evil corrupt
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:51.960]  people are going to do to try to uh suppress gold and silver
[02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:57.080]  and for a college student like myself uh how how should i get into the into the
[02:45:57.080 --> 02:46:01.320]  silver market i know gold is is way out of my my league but in terms of silver
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:05.720]  i know i need to get like uh water filters and stock up with food but in
[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:09.800]  terms of silver what is uh your best uh i guess
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:15.880]  bargain in terms of getting silver well my feeling is this and i'm currently
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:22.520]  doing that and that is a pre 1964 90 dimes quarters and halves
[02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:27.080]  i mean that's the cheapest way to buy silver and everybody knows what those
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:29.960]  coins are and so that has been my preference
[02:46:29.960 --> 02:46:34.920]  followed by uh the uh walking liberties as well
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:43.160]  as uh as the um as the silver regals and but that's an easy way to get in
[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:46.200]  and as as long as you can find a dealer who can
[02:46:46.200 --> 02:46:50.280]  who was willing to sell to you in small amounts
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:55.080]  and uh and so that's the way to approach it that's why i do it
[02:46:55.080 --> 02:47:00.200]  and even at the end of the call uh gotta move on bob we've got tons of callers
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:03.240]  for you and not much time so we're gonna move on to
[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:08.520]  shannon in mississippi shannon your question for bob Chapman
[02:47:10.040 --> 02:47:17.080]  shannon you're on the air go ahead we dropped shannon bob air force based
[02:47:17.080 --> 02:47:20.520]  bob you're on the air go ahead

[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:31.400]  mr Chapman i'm sorry but i'm sitting here watching
[02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:36.920]  uh a sweep of base housing right now and i thought i'd want to mention it to
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:42.200]  you guys a sweep of what sorry
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:46.200]  of base housing i'm actually on an air force base
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:50.120]  and they're claiming they're doing sweeps for unexploded ordinance and people's
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:53.160]  cross spaces they're systematically shutting down
[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:57.800]  uh a full street at a time it's been going on for a couple weeks
[02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:01.160]  and they're basically telling people to leave their houses for six hours while
[02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:05.000]  they post fully geared security force posts uh personnel on both ends of the
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:08.760]  street and they're searching the entire houses
[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:11.880]  i just wonder if you guys are planning similar to this happen at other places
[02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:15.400]  or if you got any idea what might be going on other than
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:18.920]  i don't know bugging or searching for weapons in the catalog and there i
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:23.160]  have no idea what they're doing my real name is
[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:29.240]  go ahead i have i've not heard of that but that's outrageous
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:32.520]  of course in the military send me an email on it bob and send me the

[02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:49.640]  watson it's a great honor to be on the show that's okay go ahead what's your
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:52.200]  question today my question is i was wondering what the
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:55.720]  official explanation for the government explanation
[02:48:55.720 --> 02:49:00.280]  for the world trade center seven collapse was
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:04.280]  it was the fire the official the official government explanation
[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:08.920]  by nist was that it collapsed as a result of what they called
[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:13.240]  thermal expansion and they claimed that the building
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:18.360]  collapsed from the outward walls in which is completely contradicted by all
[02:49:18.360 --> 02:49:22.360]  the video evidence which shows first the penthouse collapsing
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:25.800]  and then the structure collapsing demolition style
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:29.800]  freefall so their very official story is contradicted
[02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:34.200]  um just by watching a simple video of the collapse of the world trade center
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:37.160]  the collapse was initiated at the penthouse
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:40.760]  that's why nist edited out that penthouse footage
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:44.440]  in their recent release of three terabytes worth of
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:48.120]  video footage and photographs so they're trying to cover up they're trying
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:53.400]  to cover up the very nature of the collapse of world trade center seven
[02:49:53.400 --> 02:49:57.000]  bj in arizona you're on the air with bob Chapman go ahead bj
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:02.200]  fellas um bob i have a question when this all first started and they bailed
[02:50:02.200 --> 02:50:07.000]  out the banks wasn't it about kind of preventing the derivatives and
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:11.960]  counterparty risk from imploding and wouldn't what's going on now
[02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:16.760]  kind of be the nuke on the derivatives
[02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:21.560]  well first of all uh yes part of what they uh
[02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:26.440]  were pretending to do uh was to protect the derivative structure
[02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:30.200]  and it's understandable why they would do so because there's no regulation
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:34.360]  and i've done what they wanted to do in that theater so to speak
[02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:38.280]  and they didn't want that thing touched if they can because they knew
[02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:42.440]  that if the derivative structure started to crumble
[02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:46.200]  the whole financial system would go down i mean we're talking
[02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:51.800]  uh one point five quadrillion uh dollars with the derivatives
[02:50:51.800 --> 02:50:55.560]  okay we'll be back after the break with mark and steve in florida

[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:45.560]  in florida go ahead thank you bob i got a question
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:51.560]  us postal service section 323 priority male international insurance
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:55.160]  they talk about special drawing rights where the dollar
[02:54:55.160 --> 02:55:02.600]  has a value of 65.76 sdr special drawing rights what is that and is that
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:07.160]  the imf taking over the u.s economy
[02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:10.200]  well it's a good question i hadn't seen that before
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:17.560]  uh that must be how many uh units of the sdr needed to buy a dollar
[02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:21.080]  i'm just guessing at that the sdr is a special
[02:55:21.080 --> 02:55:25.800]  uh a drawing right uh which the imf issues
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:29.640]  are usually in exchange for other things like dollars
[02:55:29.640 --> 02:55:33.720]  and that might be the official exchange rate that they're using
[02:55:33.720 --> 02:55:38.040]  for those contributors like china recently contributed
[02:55:38.040 --> 02:55:42.680]  and receive sdrs they're just another fiat currency
[02:55:42.680 --> 02:55:47.560]  backed by nothing more than the word of the imf and members who
[02:55:47.560 --> 02:55:55.160]  contribute and control the imf and so uh it may be in preparation
[02:55:55.160 --> 02:55:58.520]  but i haven't seen anything like it anyplace else
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:02.440]  but uh it's it's interesting that you had found that
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:07.720]  um it might be the beginning of a wave of the future especially
[02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:11.800]  uh in as much as the postal service is part of the government
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:19.960]  you can get it at the usmail website section 323.62 and it says one sdr
[02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:26.040]  is equal to a dollar 52 us okay thanks for the call
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:30.360]  that's also part of the bank or global currency that we've reported on before
[02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:35.080]  uh steve in florida your question for bob Chapman go ahead steve
[02:56:35.080 --> 02:56:39.640]  yeah how you doing there watching every time i go ahead i get you
[02:56:39.640 --> 02:56:43.800]  i just wanted to say i wanted to ask him um about the uh
[02:56:43.800 --> 02:56:47.240]  this whole banking fraud system we've got working uh
[02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:51.960]  will will we be in dishonor for 70 years like we have previously if uh we go
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:54.520]  through with um basically telling the banks they
[02:56:54.520 --> 02:56:57.720]  can't take the houses unless they get their stuff in order and i wanted to
[02:56:57.720 --> 02:57:01.720]  plug uh november 5th rom paul sign waving i hope
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:09.480]  people can get behind it so bob what's your reaction to that
[02:57:09.480 --> 02:57:14.360]  well i don't know exactly what he means ron paul november 5th
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:18.440]  i think he was before he was talking about um how the government will react
[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:21.880]  if people just stay in their homes and refuse to be kicked out with the four
[02:57:21.880 --> 02:57:25.400]  closures oh yeah yeah well that's the first question
[02:57:25.400 --> 02:57:29.160]  um uh the government did they can't do anything about it
[02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:32.600]  are they going to have to come up with some sort of a solution
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:39.320]  and probably 50 percent of the uh of the uh mortgages are being held by
[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:43.320]  fannie may and freddy mac jenny may and fha which now belong to the
[02:57:43.320 --> 02:57:47.880]  government and uh uh so the government's responsible
[02:57:47.880 --> 02:57:53.000]  and that is the taxpayers and so uh i think they'll be frozen in their tracks
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:57.800]  i don't know what they'll do i mean that that that kind of an event
[02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:02.360]  also uh would take the dollar down take the market down
[02:58:02.360 --> 02:58:06.360]  uh which certainly if people were foreigners who owned
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:10.760]  a us treasuries or agency securities i think they would think twice about
[02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:16.280]  buying them and so the bottom line is it could create a financial panic
[02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:19.720]  and i think okay we've come to the end of the show thanks bob
