[00:00.000 --> 00:12.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.320 --> 00:21.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.120 --> 00:32.040]  Tuesday June 15th 2010 this is the Alex Jones show my name's Paul Joseph Watson
[00:32.040 --> 00:37.240]  editor and writer for prisonplanet.com I'll be sitting in for the first hour
[00:37.240 --> 00:42.280]  while Alex is away and afterwards we'll have another rebroadcast of the best
[00:42.280 --> 00:48.320]  interviews of the past week or so as was yesterday I want to get your calls
[00:48.320 --> 00:54.080]  lined up fairly quickly we'll go to them at the bottom of the hour so the
[00:54.080 --> 01:04.680]  studio number is 8882012244 that's 8882012244 and we're going to get into
[01:04.680 --> 01:09.440]  the latest on the oil spill and how it's being used as we've documented
[01:09.440 --> 01:15.520]  previously to push this nightmare green economy that we've seen decimate
[01:15.520 --> 01:22.240]  countries like Spain already and how Obama is using it to move towards the
[01:22.240 --> 01:27.000]  nationalization of the oil industry and government takeover of business now
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.160]  we're also going to get into this quote new story on this trillion dollars worth
[01:33.160 --> 01:37.920]  of mineral deposits that have been discovered in Afghanistan and debunk it
[01:37.920 --> 01:44.440]  for the pro-war PR stunt that it is but first I want to get into this video
[01:44.440 --> 01:49.480]  everybody's talking about it this confrontation between this Democratic
[01:49.480 --> 01:54.640]  Congressman Bob Etheridge and these two college kids and you've probably already
[01:54.640 --> 01:59.480]  seen the video it's on prisonplanet.com for those of you who haven't but you
[01:59.480 --> 02:05.080]  you can barely avoid it over the past 24 hours and basically it shows this
[02:05.080 --> 02:08.920]  Democratic Congressman Etheridge walking down the street after a Pelosi
[02:08.920 --> 02:14.400]  speech and he's confronted by these two college kids who merely ask him if he's
[02:14.400 --> 02:20.200]  supports the Obama agenda and now what's interesting after that is that
[02:20.200 --> 02:26.080]  Etheridge goes completely nuts grabs the kids arm starts throwing punches at the
[02:26.080 --> 02:32.280]  camera and then grabs him around the neck in a kind of mini half Nelson while
[02:32.280 --> 02:35.560]  these kids are trying to say what you're doing what's going on we're only asking
[02:35.560 --> 02:43.200]  a question now in the 24 hours since this came out we learned the fact that
[02:43.200 --> 02:48.720]  the government immediately got hold of it and start issuing talking points on
[02:48.720 --> 02:55.840]  how the corporate media should debunk this story and just like the castrated
[02:55.840 --> 03:00.320]  little sheep that they are you know people like Chris Matthews MSNBC and
[03:00.320 --> 03:04.760]  those that work at the Washington Post and the rest of the establishment
[03:04.760 --> 03:11.280]  Neolib blogosphere immediately clicked their heels and started following these
[03:11.280 --> 03:17.120]  orders in trying to dismiss this video confrontation with the congressman as
[03:17.120 --> 03:22.880]  some kind of parties and stun and even going to the lens of not only absolving
[03:22.880 --> 03:28.080]  Etheridge of blame but trying to tell us basically that down is up and that it
[03:28.080 --> 03:32.320]  was Etheridge not the college kids who asked him a question and were assaulted
[03:32.320 --> 03:36.240]  but it was Etheridge that was attacked and assaulted by the college kids who
[03:36.240 --> 03:41.520]  immediately asked him a question I mean let's get one thing clear to the
[03:41.520 --> 03:45.920]  corporate media who followed their orders beautifully like the castrated
[03:45.920 --> 03:51.080]  cheap they are you're not going to make this go away by trying to take the focus
[03:51.080 --> 03:56.840]  away from Etheridge's bizarre control freak behavior this guy's supposed to be
[03:56.840 --> 04:01.360]  a public servant so you're not going to be able to demonize people who ask
[04:01.360 --> 04:07.440]  questions of public servants by claiming it's all a Republican stun and that it's
[04:07.440 --> 04:13.040]  contrived in a vent and invented which is exactly what they're now trying to do
[04:13.040 --> 04:18.040]  through these White House talking points that have gone out to the media I
[04:18.040 --> 04:22.400]  don't even care if these kids were Republican Party operatives that's not
[04:22.400 --> 04:28.000]  the issue the issue is the Etheridge this establishment Neolib is acting like
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.520]  a nutcase on a power trip and his behavior is emblematic of how our
[04:34.520 --> 04:38.800]  representatives see us as basically turds on a sidewalk that they could treat
[04:38.800 --> 04:43.200]  like crap when in reality they're public servants but play the video we'll get
[04:43.200 --> 04:47.440]  into how the media is spinning this after the break this is the Alex Jones show

[08:12.520 --> 08:20.040]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:20.040 --> 08:28.520]  Alex Jones Paul Joseph Watson singing for Alex Jones on this Tuesday
[08:28.520 --> 08:33.520]  edition Alex will be back tomorrow now we're talking about this confrontation
[08:33.520 --> 08:37.880]  between the college kids and this congressman Bob Etheridge which is
[08:37.880 --> 08:43.360]  causing debate across the political spectrum and basically what we've
[08:43.360 --> 08:48.280]  learned in the 24 hours since this emerged as a news story from Andrew
[08:48.280 --> 08:53.880]  Breitbart's big government website is the fact that the White House Democratic
[08:53.880 --> 08:58.760]  Party official put out these talking points where he was basically ordering
[08:58.760 --> 09:03.080]  the media to try and spin this confrontation in which Etheridge
[09:03.080 --> 09:07.240]  physically assaults these people asked him if he was supporting the Obama
[09:07.240 --> 09:13.000]  agenda they put out these talking points mandating the corporate media to spin
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.920]  this as a contrived partisan setup in an attempt to discredit it now I'm afraid
[09:19.920 --> 09:22.840]  it's just not going to work because you're never going to take attention and
[09:22.840 --> 09:28.440]  focus away from what the story is the heart of it which is Etheridge's bizarre
[09:28.440 --> 09:35.600]  insane reaction his ego power trip to merely being asked a question you're
[09:35.600 --> 09:40.720]  just not going to spin it by saying it's it's a Republican setup because as
[09:40.720 --> 09:44.960]  you've seen and heard as listeners of the Alex Jones show over the past several
[09:44.960 --> 09:50.400]  years neocons have been confronted in exactly the same way remember David
[09:50.400 --> 09:54.920]  from this is the guy that wrote Bush's axis of evil speech this is the guy who
[09:54.920 --> 10:00.360]  was confronted by we are change members back in 2008 when they asked him about
[10:00.360 --> 10:05.960]  9-11 and if you watch the clip which is on the website from behaved almost
[10:05.960 --> 10:10.560]  exactly the same way as Etheridge did in this new video clip you know he's
[10:10.560 --> 10:14.680]  swatting away the camera he's assaulting the people asking the questions he's
[10:14.680 --> 10:20.120]  pushing them away so I don't care who's being confronted whether it's a
[10:20.120 --> 10:23.920]  Democrat or Republican and I don't care who's asking the questions the key
[10:23.920 --> 10:30.520]  issue is the reaction of the individual being confronted and you have to ask
[10:30.520 --> 10:37.000]  why the establishments in such a blind panic over this story and it's because
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.840]  they're petrified that a couple of college kids with a with a flip camera
[10:41.840 --> 10:47.120]  can change the course of a state election I mean you're not going to turn
[10:47.120 --> 10:50.720]  reality on its head by claiming that Etheridge was being attacked and
[10:50.720 --> 10:55.440]  assaulted by these kids which is now what they're trying to do. Etheridge in the
[10:55.440 --> 10:59.840]  24 hours since this emerged as a news story has been forced to issue an
[10:59.840 --> 11:05.080]  apology for his behavior in the incident and yet Democrats and the
[11:05.080 --> 11:11.120]  libtard neo-lib establishment are still trying to spin it as a contrived
[11:11.120 --> 11:17.080]  parties and stun when Etheridge has already apologized for it. Politico
[11:17.080 --> 11:21.680]  reported last night that this Democratic Party official was sending out a set of
[11:21.680 --> 11:27.080]  talking points and it said quote push hard with blogs the lack of credibility
[11:27.080 --> 11:31.560]  inherent to anything Breitbart does or posts given its role in the debunked
[11:31.560 --> 11:38.000]  acorn videos and so this is a memo from the government going out to the
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.280]  corporate media and the neo-lib blogs telling them how to respond to this
[11:43.280 --> 11:48.160]  incident and you'd think it would be an uphill struggle because you know
[11:48.160 --> 11:52.680]  Etheridge has already apologized he's already accepted blame for it and yet
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.480]  they're still trying to make out as if the kids asking him the question were
[11:57.480 --> 12:03.320]  the ones engaging in ambush journalism and even one blog suggests that he was
[12:03.320 --> 12:08.160]  that these kids asking the question were in fact attacking Etheridge and he was
[12:08.160 --> 12:13.880]  defending himself I mean you've seen the clip he's got the kid by you know by the
[12:13.880 --> 12:20.720]  neck he's almost strangling him in a kind of half Nelson for a second and it's
[12:20.720 --> 12:26.320]  just amazing how quickly the mainstream media followed orders and we had this
[12:26.320 --> 12:32.080]  coordinated spin which centered mainly as you would expect around Chris Matthews
[12:32.080 --> 12:37.520]  another host on fms NBC we've got the Chris Matthews clip linked up in the
[12:37.520 --> 12:42.960]  article today on prisonplanet.com in which again he he tries to undermine the
[12:42.960 --> 12:46.440]  people who asked the question by claiming that the congressman was
[12:46.440 --> 12:51.360]  ambushed and he doesn't even mention the fact that he was physically grappling
[12:51.360 --> 12:56.120]  and assaulting with this young student who asked the question and we're gonna
[12:56.120 --> 13:03.360]  exemplify this now by playing an MSNBC clip in which they sigh so-called
[13:03.360 --> 13:08.400]  Democrats has blasting the people allegedly behind this video so they're
[13:08.400 --> 13:14.840]  trying to create this notion that the people to blame for this confrontation
[13:14.840 --> 13:20.280]  are the kids who are asking him the question so listen to this spin from
[13:20.280 --> 13:25.360]  MSNBC this is a two-minute clip there's a pause in the middle but it's only for a
[13:25.360 --> 13:30.160]  few seconds so we'll go to this MSNBC clip now and North Carolina
[13:30.160 --> 13:34.040]  representative Bob Etheridge is apologizing for a video that is all
[13:34.040 --> 13:38.040]  over the internet people are buzzing about it the video shows him confronted
[13:38.040 --> 13:43.640]  by two camera men as he leaves a fundraiser
[13:43.640 --> 13:51.640]  Do you fully support the Obama agenda? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?
[13:51.640 --> 14:00.640]  Who are you? I'm here for a project. Who are you? Who are you?
[14:00.640 --> 14:08.760]  Who are you? So in a written statement just a short time ago the congressman
[14:08.760 --> 14:13.240]  said quote I deeply and profoundly regret my reaction and I apologize to all
[14:13.240 --> 14:16.280]  involved throughout my many years of service to the people of North Carolina
[14:16.280 --> 14:20.160]  I've always tried to treat people from all viewpoint to respect no matter how
[14:20.160 --> 14:25.120]  intrusive and partisan our politics can become this does not justify a poor
[14:25.120 --> 14:29.560]  response I have and will always work to promote a civil public discourse
[14:29.560 --> 14:32.920]  Meanwhile though there are some Democrats that are blasting the people
[14:32.920 --> 14:37.040]  allegedly behind this video it first appeared on Andrew Byteborg's
[14:37.040 --> 14:41.840]  conservative blog biggovernment.org Byteborg you might recall was partly
[14:41.840 --> 14:46.440]  responsible for that notorious acorn video featuring conservative James O'Keefe
[14:46.440 --> 14:49.840]  when he dressed as a pimp after a separate video project O'Keefe pleaded
[14:49.840 --> 14:57.320]  guilty to a misdemeanor for entering Senator Mary Landry's office so that's
[14:57.320 --> 15:02.920]  the clip and if you listen to it carefully the host tries to use the
[15:02.920 --> 15:10.040]  fact that the guy who got the infamous acorn scoop pleaded guilty to a trespassing
[15:10.040 --> 15:14.680]  misdemeanor which is you know has no relation to the actual acorn story
[15:14.680 --> 15:20.160]  whatsoever they try to use that as a conduit through which to imply that
[15:20.160 --> 15:25.240]  these college students who asked the question of the congressman were somehow
[15:25.240 --> 15:32.600]  engaging in a criminal act by asking this public servant a question and then
[15:32.600 --> 15:38.040]  this host then you know parents Chris Matthews debunked smear of blaming the
[15:38.040 --> 15:43.520]  kid who supposedly engaged in an ambush again undermining the people who asked
[15:43.520 --> 15:50.120]  the question while failing completely to explore why the congressman reacted in
[15:50.120 --> 15:56.360]  such an aggressive and bizarre manner now they guess even worse than that not
[15:56.360 --> 15:59.520]  only are they trying to portray etherage as the victim of the incident
[15:59.520 --> 16:03.840]  after this government memo went out saying what talking point station go
[16:03.840 --> 16:09.040]  from there's a website politically illustrated again this neo-lib
[16:09.040 --> 16:15.000]  establishment website which ran with a headline quote Bob etherage defends
[16:15.000 --> 16:20.640]  himself against student attack on sidewalk so that's right now you know if
[16:20.640 --> 16:25.480]  someone punches your camera grabs you by the neck grabs you by the arm and
[16:25.480 --> 16:31.480]  basically puts you into a half Nelson then you better be concerned that they
[16:31.480 --> 16:35.360]  don't charge you with attacking them because now these neo-lib websites are
[16:35.360 --> 16:40.800]  saying that etherage was defending himself from an attack when he's grabbing
[16:40.800 --> 16:47.000]  the guy around almost around the throat an assault in this individual and the
[16:47.000 --> 16:53.480]  Washington Post even reported that etherages assault of this student who
[16:53.480 --> 16:59.400]  was asking him the question was quote a hug a hug he's grabbing him round the
[16:59.400 --> 17:03.920]  neck he's squeezing his arm he's throwing punches at the camera and the
[17:03.920 --> 17:09.480]  Washington Post reports it as a hug you know imagine if someone like Rand Paul
[17:09.480 --> 17:13.840]  who was of course was completely savage because he expressed this nuanced
[17:13.840 --> 17:19.760]  philosophical position on the Rachel Maddow show imagine if Rand Paul had been
[17:19.760 --> 17:24.440]  walking down the street and somebody had asked him a question about his position
[17:24.440 --> 17:28.080]  on the Civil Rights Act and then imagine if Rand Paul had like grabbed
[17:28.080 --> 17:32.360]  somebody around the neck and start throwing punches at the camera do you
[17:32.360 --> 17:36.240]  think the media the corporate media would then just try and explain it away
[17:36.240 --> 17:42.920]  as a hug and a contrived setup or would they politically lynch Rand Paul for
[17:42.920 --> 17:48.240]  weeks on end as they did with the civil rights sphere of course they would but
[17:48.240 --> 17:53.280]  this is an establishment Democrat you know he's an Obama minion so they're
[17:53.280 --> 17:58.840]  gonna protect him and why are they so keen to protect him not only because you
[17:58.840 --> 18:04.120]  know he's one of their own but because his North Carolina Congressional seat
[18:04.120 --> 18:09.920]  was seen as a safe bet now it's under threat from whichever anti incumbent
[18:09.920 --> 18:14.640]  candidate wants to challenge him we've seen the wave of success that anti
[18:14.640 --> 18:18.960]  incumbent candidates have had over the past few months and this opens the door
[18:18.960 --> 18:24.440]  in North Carolina for another one to step in and take advantage of the fact
[18:24.440 --> 18:28.880]  that Etheridge has been completely publicly disgraced and shamed by his
[18:28.880 --> 18:35.880]  shameful behavior but again it's it's a sterling example of the fact that two
[18:35.880 --> 18:39.600]  college kids with a little flip camera can change the course of a state
[18:39.600 --> 18:46.240]  election it's this kind of in-your-face political activism the media smears it
[18:46.240 --> 18:51.320]  as ambush journalism but I mean that's what they engage in on a routine basis
[18:51.320 --> 18:56.960]  especially people like Chris Matthews and MSNBC when they're attacking grassroots
[18:56.960 --> 19:02.120]  Americans as you know domestic extremists and violent radicals they
[19:02.120 --> 19:05.540]  engage in ambush questions and journalism but then they accuse the
[19:05.540 --> 19:13.400]  independent media of doing it but I mean again it exemplifies the fact that when
[19:13.400 --> 19:18.640]  people like Etheridge are confronted you know by the rabble by the independent
[19:18.640 --> 19:24.760]  media by the people they're supposed to represent that they react in this way
[19:24.760 --> 19:29.960]  which just shows how they viewers how they think of us as basically dirt and
[19:29.960 --> 19:34.920]  the fact that they're not public servants they're overlords so the
[19:34.920 --> 19:38.880]  establishment is running scared in a blind panic because this just
[19:38.880 --> 19:43.600]  shows the power of alternative media and the internet to change the future
[19:43.600 --> 19:49.160]  course of the country in getting these anti incumbent candidates in and kicking

[26:16.880 --> 26:21.800]  went out starting to see come to fruition especially with the growth of
[26:21.800 --> 26:26.240]  the independent media which is exemplified no better by this
[26:26.240 --> 26:31.120]  confrontation of the congressman which we were discussing before the break but
[26:31.120 --> 26:36.200]  now we're going to move on to Afghanistan now we've got a situation
[26:36.200 --> 26:41.560]  where polls at the moment are showing the maximum opposition to the occupation
[26:41.560 --> 26:46.120]  of Afghanistan since the invasion you know the surge is failing we've just
[26:46.120 --> 26:50.360]  had one of the bloodiest weeks in the conflict which is now you know nine
[26:50.360 --> 26:58.400]  years old the UK is signaling that there could be a pullout of troops after you
[26:58.400 --> 27:02.840]  know more British troops died in the past couple of weeks so lo and behold
[27:02.840 --> 27:07.640]  the New York Times comes to the rescue you know the the helpful progenitor of
[27:07.640 --> 27:13.640]  myths about weapons of mass destruction and yellow cake from Niger you know the
[27:13.640 --> 27:17.440]  New York Times this big liberal newspaper that routinely supports the war
[27:17.440 --> 27:22.240]  whether it's George W Bush or Barack Obama in office with this big announcement
[27:22.240 --> 27:27.200]  that they found a trillion dollars worth of gold aluminium copper iron and other
[27:27.200 --> 27:32.360]  minerals in the mountains of Afghanistan thus providing the perfect
[27:32.360 --> 27:39.000]  justification and motivation for Obama to prolong the occupation you know
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.360]  Obama the peace candidate the anti-war candidate the candidate of change more
[27:43.360 --> 27:48.920]  troops deployed more us troops deployed than at any time during George W Bush's
[27:48.920 --> 27:54.920]  presidency that's that's a peace candidate Barack Obama there and if you
[27:54.920 --> 27:59.280]  just merely scratch the surface on research in this new announcement they
[27:59.280 --> 28:04.280]  call it of these vast mineral deposits in Afghanistan you will know that it's
[28:04.280 --> 28:09.320]  basically as raw story calls it in their article which is posted on prison
[28:09.320 --> 28:16.160]  planet dot com a PR scam designed to hoodwink Americans and as well as
[28:16.160 --> 28:20.600]  Afghan civilians into thinking that they will ultimately somehow be the
[28:20.600 --> 28:25.240]  beneficiaries of all this just like you know we were told that Americans would
[28:25.240 --> 28:32.680]  get would reap the bounty of the Iraqi oil and you know this is nothing more
[28:32.680 --> 28:38.200]  than a contrived and regurgitated story the Soviets the Soviets knew as far
[28:38.200 --> 28:45.120]  back as 85 the Afghanistan contained these minerals 25 years ago and in fact
[28:45.120 --> 28:51.640]  a 2007 US Geological Survey report said the same thing that Afghanistan was
[28:51.640 --> 28:57.400]  rich with these minerals people who were living in Kabul in the 70s as he's
[28:57.400 --> 29:01.720]  quoted in the raw story article talks about how everybody knew about the fact
[29:01.720 --> 29:05.280]  that these deposits were in the mountains of Afghanistan so we're talking
[29:05.280 --> 29:10.720]  about a story that's nearly 40 years old and the New York Times reports it
[29:10.720 --> 29:16.720]  yesterday as if it's something new and why are they reporting it because the
[29:16.720 --> 29:20.280]  New York Times the establishment media basically they're just reigning off a
[29:20.280 --> 29:25.640]  Pentagon press release are desperate for some pro-war grist amidst this
[29:25.640 --> 29:30.360]  plethora of failures that they're willing to recycle a story that's four
[29:30.360 --> 29:35.240]  decades old and will continue to dig into this and we'll get to your calls
[29:35.240 --> 29:40.240]  after the break this is the Alex Jones show stay tuned

[30:11.760 --> 30:15.800]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[30:15.800 --> 30:19.640]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:19.640 --> 30:23.880]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:23.880 --> 30:28.080]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:28.080 --> 30:32.400]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:32.400 --> 30:36.160]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[30:36.160 --> 30:40.320]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[30:40.320 --> 30:43.320]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by

[33:18.720 --> 33:24.040]  welcome back to the live show show is Paul Joseph Watson here on this Tuesday
[33:24.040 --> 33:29.760]  June the 15th there's a very strange breaking story about how general David
[33:29.760 --> 33:35.120]  Petraeus has basically collapsed during the Senate Armed Services Committee
[33:35.120 --> 33:40.600]  hearing today while discussed discussing the war in Afghanistan so that's an
[33:40.600 --> 33:45.400]  interesting breaking story that will certainly be posted up on prisonplanet.com
[33:45.400 --> 33:49.520]  we were talking about Afghanistan before the break and the discovery of these
[33:49.520 --> 33:54.560]  you know the discovery as if it didn't happen four decades ago which it did
[33:54.560 --> 34:01.120]  of these vast mineral deposits of gold lithium iron copper and others and how
[34:01.120 --> 34:05.840]  they supposedly you know now represents a justification for maintaining the
[34:05.840 --> 34:11.160]  occupation of the country of course it's a complete scam it's pro-war public
[34:11.160 --> 34:17.200]  relations done because we knew that Afghanistan contained these minerals as
[34:17.200 --> 34:22.200]  much as four decades ago so the fact that they're now bringing it out in the
[34:22.200 --> 34:28.680]  midst of all this failure surrounding the surge the potential pullout of UK
[34:28.680 --> 34:33.880]  troops polls showing massive opposition greater than ever to the
[34:33.880 --> 34:38.640]  Afghanistan war pretty much tells you why they're doing it and why it came out
[34:38.640 --> 34:43.880]  of the New York Times it's a PR stunt designed to try and rally Americans
[34:43.880 --> 34:49.440]  around supporting the idea that the troops under Obama the anti-war candidate
[34:49.440 --> 34:53.560]  who now has more troops deployed than George W. Bush ever did should keep them
[34:53.560 --> 35:01.280]  in Afghanistan for another decade and beyond I want to talk about this I want
[35:01.280 --> 35:06.480]  to talk about the BP oil spill which is what people in the prisonplanet forum
[35:06.480 --> 35:11.000]  certainly want to know about they want to hear from people in the area so we're
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.120]  going to go to calls now on the first caller is Joe in Wisconsin Joe you're
[35:15.120 --> 35:20.560]  on the air hi Paul I want to talk about checks and balances and this North
[35:20.560 --> 35:25.400]  Carolina guy fits right in with that any government big enough to give you
[35:25.400 --> 35:30.440]  anything you want is big enough to take it away and our 1776 government said we
[35:30.440 --> 35:36.000]  had any legal rights based on something bigger than they were and what if our
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.600]  government gave us our rights well secular government isn't quite benign it
[35:41.600 --> 35:46.880]  just needs something a bigger force than it is that gives you your rights so that
[35:46.880 --> 35:51.240]  they can't take it away it's also why we here in America have a second amendment
[35:51.240 --> 35:59.000]  it just needs something to hold it in check well that's right and I mean the
[35:59.000 --> 36:04.760]  attacks on the second amendment and the fact that rights are inalienable you know
[36:04.760 --> 36:10.680]  God-given is apparent on a daily basis and we have the growth of this status
[36:10.680 --> 36:17.040]  mindset with a welfare state especially in Europe whereby government affords
[36:17.040 --> 36:21.320]  people their rights and they're not natural rights and that's obviously as
[36:21.320 --> 36:26.720]  you mentioned purely so that government can then take away those rights at a
[36:26.720 --> 36:31.600]  late stage which is why now with the growth of global governance they're
[36:31.600 --> 36:38.400]  trying to make as a acquiesce under this UN charter which the UN affords as
[36:38.400 --> 36:43.080]  those rights and the UN can take them away when every man is born free and
[36:43.080 --> 36:48.280]  rights are God-given as he's outlined not only in the Constitution but what it
[36:48.280 --> 36:54.000]  originated from which was the Magna Carta in England so you're exactly right
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.440]  and we'll go to the next caller which is Marcus in Iowa Marcus you're on the
[36:58.440 --> 37:05.880]  end hey yeah I'm sorry I'm a little nervous today at 1037 a.m. central time
[37:05.880 --> 37:14.360]  and 10th of cold Florida I was watching Obama give his speech and on the oil spill
[37:14.360 --> 37:24.560]  he said that it was a it was a exercise that went bad more or less a training
[37:24.560 --> 37:34.400]  exercise Howard Jones also proved that 9-11 was and so the 7705 is that 1037
[37:34.400 --> 37:41.480]  a.m. YouTube it do whatever find it so yep so you're saying that Obama said
[37:41.480 --> 37:47.880]  that the accident was caused as a result of a training exercise presumably
[37:47.880 --> 37:52.720]  based around how they would react to an oil spill and you're saying that this
[37:52.720 --> 37:58.040]  was an exercise that quote went wrong is that what Obama's claiming now that's
[37:58.040 --> 38:03.360]  exactly what he said if you want me to do a word-for-word I have it paused and
[38:03.360 --> 38:12.120]  recorded well and I will say a schedule if you were email that clip to me at
[38:12.120 --> 38:17.680]  Watson at prisonplanet.com email it to me and we will play it after the next
[38:17.680 --> 38:23.600]  break we'll definitely not know if it's on YouTube I have it stated to my TV or
[38:23.600 --> 38:32.240]  on my TV okay well I'll do a quick Google search and we'll definitely delve
[38:32.240 --> 38:36.400]  into it after the break if that's accurate which if it if it is then is a
[38:36.400 --> 38:43.360]  massive story we know Tony Hayward the BP oil chief sold his stock in BP
[38:43.360 --> 38:48.680]  immediately before the disaster Goldman Sachs which was which is now headed by
[38:48.680 --> 38:54.400]  Peter Sutherland who was a former CEO of BP dumped millions of dollars worth
[38:54.400 --> 39:01.840]  of stock before the accident there were these unusual alterations to the
[39:01.840 --> 39:05.840]  hydraulic equipment that occurred right before the accident happened so we had
[39:05.840 --> 39:10.920]  all these indicators of at least for knowledge and if now that they were
[39:10.920 --> 39:14.680]  running exercises based around the premise of an oil spill right before
[39:14.680 --> 39:19.160]  this happened then that is a massive smoking gun because of course as we
[39:19.160 --> 39:27.000]  saw with 9-11 and 7-7 the London bombings the simulation and exercise
[39:27.000 --> 39:32.680]  surrounding real-world events gives them culpable deniability for if any
[39:32.680 --> 39:37.200]  evidence occurs which points to sabotage so that would be a massive story and
[39:37.200 --> 39:42.880]  we'll definitely check into that just after the next break we're going to go
[39:42.880 --> 39:50.120]  to Mark in Florida Mark you are on the air yeah I was watching CNN this morning
[39:50.120 --> 39:55.840]  and there were signs of businesses on the coast and it was saying Mr. President
[39:55.840 --> 40:00.320]  waived the Jones Act and implement FEMA now I'm obviously familiar with FEMA I
[40:00.320 --> 40:03.000]  was just wondering if you knew what what is what are they talking about by
[40:03.000 --> 40:09.840]  waving the Jones Act the Jones Act I'm not sure I haven't heard about that one
[40:09.840 --> 40:16.240]  there's a story here out of the Miami Herald Florida Republicans ask Obama to
[40:16.240 --> 40:22.600]  waive Jones Act and that's being reported by the associated press US Senator
[40:22.600 --> 40:27.840]  George Lemieux and US Representative Jeff Miller want President Barack Obama to
[40:27.840 --> 40:33.880]  waive a law they say is keeping foreign oil skimmers out the Gulf of Mexico the
[40:33.880 --> 40:37.800]  Florida Republicans sent a letter to Obama Monday and plan to discuss the
[40:37.800 --> 40:43.600]  issue within Tuesday during his president's visit to Pensacola and the
[40:43.600 --> 40:48.640]  Jones Act according to this article bars foreign ships from carrying cargo and
[40:48.640 --> 40:55.240]  passengers between foreign ports so basically it's another method of trying
[40:55.240 --> 41:00.000]  to keep people out of the area I presume now we know that they're keeping the
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.720]  media out of the area and that's very suspicious to say the least so yeah it
[41:05.720 --> 41:11.600]  shows up they're very keen to keep foreigners out of the area and the US
[41:11.600 --> 41:19.640]  media as well we're gonna go to Gary in Grand Isle in New Orleans Gary you're
[41:19.640 --> 41:23.560]  on the air what's on your mind today I think I just wanted to kind of give
[41:23.560 --> 41:28.120]  everyone a live report of what's going on in Grand Isle last week I was here
[41:28.120 --> 41:32.480]  and there was much more activity going on as far as the local people were
[41:32.480 --> 41:37.880]  concerned but now I've come back a week later and it's basically a deserted
[41:37.880 --> 41:43.120]  island where there's only camouflage colored trucks there's homeland
[41:43.120 --> 41:47.360]  security trucks you know like regular white pickups all over these to be all
[41:47.360 --> 41:53.720]  global type corporations here if you go on the beach you're on watched at all
[41:53.720 --> 41:57.560]  times and you're not allowed to get close to the boom and people will just
[41:57.560 --> 42:01.200]  come approach you and then there's just basically security up and down the beach
[42:01.200 --> 42:05.920]  and there's four wheelers just every few minutes want to go by and you'll see
[42:05.920 --> 42:10.200]  some sort of strange looking military truck go by and it seems like a lot of
[42:10.200 --> 42:14.600]  activity but not that much cleanup because the only people cleaning up seems
[42:14.600 --> 42:20.400]  to be people from Jamaica and the Philippines and they just kind of walk
[42:20.400 --> 42:24.880]  along with these little bitty bags and they'll take a tiny shovel scoop it up
[42:24.880 --> 42:30.560]  and I'm the president of practice parish Billy Nungaster said that the
[42:30.560 --> 42:35.000]  locals are actually going out and getting their own shop back and just going
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.440]  out and cleaning it up their cells where they're just using five gallon buckets
[42:38.440 --> 42:43.240]  and this is one other thing I wanted to comment on last I'd like for you to
[42:43.240 --> 42:47.520]  explain to me what I heard I was listening to see an end and the House of
[42:47.520 --> 42:53.880]  Commons actually stated that they needed to make sure that the cleanup remained
[42:53.880 --> 43:00.200]  global and can you explain to me what that means I think basically what that
[43:00.200 --> 43:05.200]  means I mean as you just mentioned you've got a federal takeover in my mind
[43:05.200 --> 43:09.960]  from everything I've seen and this is backed up by locals who live in the
[43:09.960 --> 43:14.800]  affected areas the cleanup crews the local creep clean up authorities are
[43:14.800 --> 43:19.400]  not being allowed to do their jobs and this is an exact replica of what
[43:19.400 --> 43:24.960]  happened after Hurricane Katrina where the local authorities were trying to
[43:24.960 --> 43:30.520]  fix the problem but the feds FEMA especially as you just mentioned we're
[43:30.520 --> 43:36.000]  actually sabotaging the attempt to you know clean up the aftermath of Hurricane
[43:36.000 --> 43:42.640]  Katrina and get things back online and this is a thing that's common throughout
[43:42.640 --> 43:47.280]  eyewitness reports in the area that the federal takeover is basically nothing
[43:47.280 --> 43:53.280]  more than a police or a law enforcement response on the federal level it's not
[43:53.280 --> 43:57.960]  even an intent to fix the problem or to clean up the oil from the beaches it's
[43:57.960 --> 44:02.720]  just about keeping people out of the area and preventing local authorities who
[44:02.720 --> 44:09.200]  could be doing their job in cleaning up what they can from having any successful
[44:09.200 --> 44:14.600]  positive impact on the drastic situation that has affected the area Obama said
[44:14.600 --> 44:18.760]  as soon as the accident occurred that he would be sending swap teams to the area
[44:18.760 --> 44:24.000]  so just as under George W Bush we're seeing an exact same response as with
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.240]  the Hurricane Katrina event and it seems like they want the crisis to get
[44:28.240 --> 44:34.720]  worse and worse because Obama in an email he sent out yesterday said that this
[44:34.720 --> 44:40.800]  is an attempt to get the green economy back on track get the cap and trade the
[44:40.800 --> 44:47.040]  carbon tax back on track which has been derailed recently so from everything you
[44:47.040 --> 44:51.680]  said and especially if now we're learning that this was after a matter of some
[44:51.680 --> 44:58.040]  kind of exercise then very suspicious goings on we're going to go to our next
[44:58.040 --> 45:06.520]  call now which is Jane in Ontario Jane you're on the earth hi hi Jane I just
[45:06.520 --> 45:10.560]  wanted to point out something that I noticed in the media coverage you played
[45:10.560 --> 45:17.520]  earlier about the atridge incident yeah go ahead the anchor referred to the
[45:17.520 --> 45:22.800]  students as camera men rather than students which suggests that they're
[45:22.800 --> 45:28.600]  mature professionals rather than the young students that they actually are
[45:28.600 --> 45:33.640]  your point but I that's what Chris Matthew said as well it's they're
[45:33.640 --> 45:38.280]  basically trying to smear the people these college kids who are asking the
[45:38.280 --> 45:43.560]  question as Republican plans and this is an effort to take attention away from
[45:43.560 --> 45:50.000]  the insane aggressive and bizarre and emblematic of thugs and people on an
[45:50.000 --> 45:55.680]  ego power trip which is exactly what etherage was engaged in at the time so
[45:55.680 --> 45:58.440]  yeah they're trying to undermine the people who asked the question and shift
[45:58.440 --> 46:02.120]  the blame and shift the focus of the story which is what the White House the
[46:02.120 --> 46:06.960]  government memo told them to do and they click their heels and immediately did
[46:06.960 --> 46:12.120]  it especially MSNBC with Chris Matthews Mike in Louisiana Mike you're on the
[46:12.120 --> 46:15.840]  air go ahead hey Paul listen I know you guys do a great job over there of
[46:15.840 --> 46:19.400]  investigative reporting and I want to let you know what I found out talking to a
[46:19.400 --> 46:24.000]  fellow that was very deeply engaged in the oil field business for 30 years and
[46:24.000 --> 46:31.480]  was aware of and actually spoke to one of the CEOs of one of the neighboring
[46:31.480 --> 46:39.080]  lease holders to the oil VP deepwater horizon area and he relayed to me that
[46:39.080 --> 46:43.960]  and you guys I guess with your abilities maybe you can check this out but
[46:43.960 --> 46:48.840]  that the the head of the deepwater oil rig only had about five days
[46:48.840 --> 46:55.320]  experience before this all happened so you know for such a valuable asset it's
[46:55.320 --> 47:00.200]  interesting that BP would throw a rookie in charge and and and think that they
[47:00.200 --> 47:06.120]  would get some kind of a some other outcome other than complete and utter
[47:06.120 --> 47:11.240]  human and human error you know and one other thing to nexus through this which
[47:11.240 --> 47:14.240]  is interesting is that you know the flood insurance program has not been
[47:14.240 --> 47:18.840]  refunded yet it hasn't been the money hasn't been reallocated to get that
[47:18.840 --> 47:23.160]  going so a lot of the loan closings in this area and around that have been
[47:23.160 --> 47:28.640]  needing flood insurance lenders have or insurance agents have been writing it
[47:28.640 --> 47:33.320]  but basically on the good faith that retroactively they'll be funded once
[47:33.320 --> 47:38.680]  Congress actually appropriates the money so I find it kind of it kind of
[47:38.680 --> 47:41.640]  interesting that we've kind of got these things going on at the same time and
[47:41.640 --> 47:44.880]  just Congress just quote-unquote hasn't been able to get their act together and
[47:44.880 --> 47:50.600]  and get it funded yeah well on the first point I mean you're saying that they
[47:50.600 --> 47:54.800]  threw this rocky in just five days before the accident happened we had the
[47:54.800 --> 48:01.320]  story last week where the Houston attorney Tony Busby said that the deep
[48:01.320 --> 48:05.960]  water horizon managers knew that the not only did the oil rig have problems
[48:05.960 --> 48:11.760]  before the explosion but people were actually on board the ship as it was
[48:11.760 --> 48:17.000]  burning after the explosion happens saying quote are you f-ing happy are
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.800]  you f-ing happy the rigs on fire I told you this was gonna happen so the people
[48:22.800 --> 48:27.800]  on board the rig knew that it had problems and that you know the safety
[48:27.800 --> 48:31.920]  procedures were out of whack they were not being followed properly and at every
[48:31.920 --> 48:38.640]  single stage of this BP story it seems that in the initial stage they wanted
[48:38.640 --> 48:44.480]  the explosion to happen they financially positioned themselves beforehand for it
[48:44.480 --> 48:49.920]  to happen and now with the absolute sinking of BP stocks these people have
[48:49.920 --> 48:53.200]  protected themselves because they sold the stocks right before the accident
[48:53.200 --> 48:58.400]  happened and then in the aftermath of the accident the federal government is
[48:58.400 --> 49:02.960]  preventing local authorities from effectively cleaning up the spill and
[49:02.960 --> 49:07.720]  the beaches around the area that it affects so every stage of this story
[49:07.720 --> 49:12.800]  both before during and after it seems they want to make it worse and that
[49:12.800 --> 49:18.680]  indeed they had foreknowledge that it would occur in the first place and now
[49:18.680 --> 49:24.600]  Obama's come out with this email promoting this nightmare green economy
[49:24.600 --> 49:30.320]  which was derailed basically before the accident and is now back on track the
[49:30.320 --> 49:36.200]  cap and trade the carbon tax in the name of reducing our dependence on oil we
[49:36.200 --> 49:40.920]  know the effect that this has had with Spain who instituted these green
[49:40.920 --> 49:48.440]  economy measures two years ago now Spain has a 20 percent unemployment rate
[49:48.440 --> 49:55.080]  because for every quote green job that's created 2.2 jobs are lost this is
[49:55.080 --> 49:59.200]  deindustrialization this is the post-industrial revolution that the
[49:59.200 --> 50:03.480]  globalists won and whether this was contrived or whether it was just an
[50:03.480 --> 50:09.880]  accident the BP oil spill has fundamentally advanced the globalist
[50:09.880 --> 50:18.200]  agenda to create artificial scarcity this idea that we have to completely
[50:18.200 --> 50:23.960]  eviscerate the oil industry and you know move to this green economy and they're
[50:23.960 --> 50:31.520]  making the situation worse with their every action and to me I mean the fact
[50:31.520 --> 50:37.320]  that BP put out the camera footage of the oil spill where you see it emerging
[50:37.320 --> 50:43.640]  from the well and then they announced oh now it's in HD oh great so BP's putting
[50:43.640 --> 50:47.760]  out this footage which makes everyone focus on how bad the problem is and
[50:47.760 --> 50:52.160]  they're only promoting how bad the problem is so there's an agenda to hide
[50:52.160 --> 50:56.800]  this and make it appear bad along with all the foreknowledge that they were
[50:56.800 --> 51:00.240]  involved in it happening so we'll explore this further after the break with
[51:00.240 --> 51:04.360]  more callers we all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most
[51:04.360 --> 51:08.080]  trusted name of water filtration as an authorized Berkey dealer for over four

[54:17.680 --> 54:22.760]  it's the final segment of this first hour of the Alex Jones show Alex will be
[54:22.760 --> 54:27.360]  back tomorrow live and we'll have rebroadcasts of interviews coming up in
[54:27.360 --> 54:32.160]  the following three hours now we're going to go to Joe in Ohio Joe you're on
[54:32.160 --> 54:36.240]  the air hey Paul thanks for taking my call it's nice to have you you're
[54:36.240 --> 54:41.720]  pretty refreshing big Alex Jones fan but thanks for picking up the slack I've
[54:41.720 --> 54:46.800]  sort of a selfish question I'm reading a lot of Chomsky lately a lot of gnome
[54:46.800 --> 54:54.120]  Chomsky and that led me to find David Barsamian and when I found Barsamian I
[54:54.120 --> 54:59.400]  found a great interview with he and Ralph Nader and I was really struck because
[54:59.400 --> 55:03.480]  the interview they were basically saying the same things that you and Alex say
[55:03.480 --> 55:09.120]  all the time so my question for you is where's the marriage between these
[55:09.120 --> 55:13.680]  respected renowned eloquent individuals and the truth or communities
[55:13.680 --> 55:22.160]  specifically the InfoWars community um gnome Chomsky and I mean I started off
[55:22.160 --> 55:26.720]  reading Chomsky when I first started you know getting aware of how the world
[55:26.720 --> 55:33.440]  works you know 10 12 years ago but everything that Chomsky's done certainly
[55:33.440 --> 55:38.920]  in the past five or six years has been completely to the detriment of the you
[55:38.920 --> 55:44.960]  know quote truth of community or patriot community I mean he was asked about 9
[55:44.960 --> 55:50.160]  11 and asked whether he thought 9 11 was an inside job or merely that the
[55:50.160 --> 55:55.520]  official story was not as the government would have us believe and Chomsky
[55:55.520 --> 56:00.760]  responded basically that he didn't care and for me that was a damning
[56:00.760 --> 56:09.240]  indictment of the fact that Chomsky is not only in 2010 not relevant but many
[56:09.240 --> 56:14.680]  have claimed that he's merely you know a deep cover operative I don't think that
[56:14.680 --> 56:19.120]  I think he's just this left-wing ideologue that panders to his own
[56:19.120 --> 56:25.520]  audience but everything that we've seen I mean back in I think it was 2001 Alex
[56:25.520 --> 56:30.440]  interviewed gnome Chomsky and suffice to say I don't think they really saw
[56:30.440 --> 56:37.400]  right to I so to my mind Chomsky doesn't have any relevance with the
[56:37.400 --> 56:42.680]  movement that's taking place now and indeed I rarely even read or see anything
[56:42.680 --> 56:47.600]  of Chomsky in the modern era so I don't even know what he's doing at the moment
[56:47.600 --> 56:53.360]  but he certainly doesn't seem relevant to what's going on politically in 2010
[56:53.360 --> 57:02.360]  now we're going to go to Mark in Minnesota Mark you're on the air
[57:02.360 --> 57:07.480]  seems these days that a lot of people are acting like thugs are electrical
[57:07.480 --> 57:13.520]  elected officials are people within the federal government and even the BP
[57:13.520 --> 57:17.480]  executives so corporate and everything it seems like the only ones that aren't
[57:17.480 --> 57:23.160]  acting like thugs at this time are the real patriots of this country but what I
[57:23.160 --> 57:28.040]  wanted to ask you about Paul was you had a great article on the false flag the
[57:28.040 --> 57:32.880]  oil spill leaning towards the false leg but I I read somewhere and I can't
[57:32.880 --> 57:39.160]  remember where I read it that the owner of the oil rig was said to collect or
[57:39.160 --> 57:43.480]  was going to collect two hundred and some million dollars twice what the oil
[57:43.480 --> 57:47.080]  rig was worth I was just wondering if you in your research have you had ran
[57:47.080 --> 57:53.200]  across any that or confirmed anything about that yeah I think I came across that
[57:53.200 --> 57:57.960]  a few days ago it wasn't in the original article I wrote but yeah I'll
[57:57.960 --> 58:02.880]  definitely dig into it what's confirmed is the fact that Goldman Sachs sold
[58:02.880 --> 58:07.600]  their stock in BP before this happened at Tony Hayward the CEO of BP sold his
[58:07.600 --> 58:13.080]  stock before that so though numerous financial agendas and motivations at
[58:13.080 --> 58:18.160]  work and what I find interesting is this idea that the oil in that region is
[58:18.160 --> 58:22.440]  naturally replenishing that it's abiotic so if that's true the so-called
[58:22.440 --> 58:26.160]  relief wells that they're now putting in are going to have no effect whatsoever
[58:26.160 --> 58:30.760]  and as many experts are predicting this could drag on for years so we've got to
[58:30.760 --> 58:34.840]  watch that this is the Alex Jones show we've come to the end of the hour Alex

[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:19.640]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:30.800]  Alex Jones they had exhausted all forms of peaceful worldly resistance in
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:35.260]  appealing to the king and the corrupt regional governors and was the
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:40.280]  Massachusetts colony that had the appeal to heaven flag also adopted by the
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:46.660]  Navy after the war started and John Paul Jones and so I have made my appeal to
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:52.780]  heaven I ran out of time in the last hour to get into IMF global taxes can
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:57.780]  only be enforced through global government bankers prepared to assault
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:04.180]  Americans with VAT transaction taxes London Guardian with a new financial VAT
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:11.220]  tax I will cover this in the last hour today another chilling article that
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:20.160]  dovetails with the report by Paul Joseph Watson where the ADL is calling for law
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:27.440]  enforcement action against myself Ron Paul and others in a report they southern
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.560]  probably law center actually did that one of their report the ADL for myself and
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:37.400]  others we have the full report up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:43.520]  we have a video coming up the last hour DHS boss says Tea Party will engage in
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:49.720]  violence this is an article up at info wars.com that Curt Nemo has done I think
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.680]  it's key for him to add a link at the top though to Watson's articles you can
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:57.680]  put both these together also with what the ADL is doing ADL calls for major
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.840]  law enforcement operation to deal with Obamacare critics I talked about this
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:08.400]  two weeks ago when it first was in testimony in Congress and then I kept
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.840]  getting emails saying why haven't I covered it so I covered it three or four
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.640]  more times I got more email saying why that I covered it so we've got Bill
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.880]  Murphy we've had on years ago back on the show coming up in the next segment
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:22.040]  but because so much is happening he was gonna be on for full hour probably on
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:26.240]  about 40 minutes because I need to after he's on with us have time to get into
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:30.280]  all this other news here and the Dick Morris saying Bill Clinton personally
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.640]  orchestrated 93 Waco tragedy and ties it into the government staging terror
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:39.840]  basically this is big news on that front coming up but we'll be talking to Bill
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:47.120]  Murphy after the break with the Gold Antitrust Action Committee we'll be
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:52.480]  discussing that with him he's the chairman and director of the GATA and
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.320]  that is coming up with a really important news with whistleblowers and
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.400]  others coming out proving that Goldman Sachs connected JP Morgan and others
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:05.000]  suppressing gold and silver prices a giant price fixing keeping the price
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.120]  down so won't compete with their derivatives and their other fraudulent
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:18.200]  instruments so that is coming up in the next segment but I don't know that I
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.520]  have the ADL openly call for law enforcement to come after us just
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:27.200]  and to make up stuff and create strong and arguments against us it just now
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.000]  the Southern Poverty Law Center doing it because these are serious soldiers I
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.840]  mean the ADL serious soldiers so is the Southern Poverty Law Center running
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:38.320]  Elohim City and government documents been released them tied into McVeigh and
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:41.760]  what happened there I mean they don't play games that's what we've been trying
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:48.760]  to explain to people I mean this is a military force we're fighting and have
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:52.560]  the mainstream media always wrapping them in patriotism and all this they're
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:04:00.680]  the opposite of patriotism the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center and this
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.520]  pretty much a hundred percent confirms they're gonna physically come after us
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:14.040]  or through law enforcement and when this burden comes upon me this realization
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:19.880]  of how right we've been it's a burden of responsibility but I better make every
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:23.360]  radio show in the time I've got allotted whether it's a day or a hundred
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:28.320]  years I better make it count I better be on I better be focused I better use
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:34.720]  every minute I've got but to do that I've got a rest do that I've got to get
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:40.760]  right with God completely God's been calling me to take time off to go away

[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:09.360]  he's the T-Rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network well he
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:15.800]  testified it was on a c-span for the CFTC he had about five minutes so he read
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:21.120]  the information very very quickly so we get into the record and he's a Bill
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:26.000]  Murphy chairman and director of gata gold anti-trust action committee we've
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.960]  had him on over the years several times other members of Gata and so there've
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:36.200]  been some huge new developments that have even ended up in a few mainstream
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.400]  newspapers in the last two weeks whistleblowers in the US and England and
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:43.960]  others coming out with JP Morgan Chase and others fixing gold and silver market
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.840]  now we've known this has gone on for a while but but now we're getting
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:51.360]  specifics and they've been harassed they've had a lot of problems since
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:54.760]  they've been exposing this we'll talk about that but this is a big deal because
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:09:01.080]  we've got the manipulation and the fact that Goldman Sachs and others were
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:05.520]  telling people to invest in derivatives while they were planning to implode them
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:09.840]  by design they've now been indicted for that you've got more and more coming out
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:13.200]  but one of the biggest scams is the suppression of the gold and silver
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:18.520]  market and kind of a reverse carry trade that they've been using there and so
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.960]  even if you don't like silver and gold or aren't into real assets this deals
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:29.280]  with the overall fraud and it's really a central issue and so he'll be with us
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:33.880]  for about the next 40 minutes or so and he won't have to hurry through his
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:38.040]  information so mr. Murphy thanks for coming on with us you've got the floor
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:42.400]  great to be here Alex one thing that I know that some of your listeners may not
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:45.240]  care about gold and silver but they certainly care about the economy and
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:52.200]  the financial markets and January 31st 2008 got a place of 264,000 dollar
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.120]  full-page color ad in the Wall Street Journal and which was a couple of months
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.560]  before everything fell apart in that ad we talked about catastrophe and
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:05.640]  disaster coming because of the directly from the suppression of the price of
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.360]  gold and it has to do with the relationship between gold and interest
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:12.040]  rates and had they let the price of gold trade freely it would have been much
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:16.080]  much higher would have been more a warning sign it would have the
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.520]  thermometer would have been off but there wouldn't have been maybe such risk
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:23.600]  taking but interest rates would have been so low they were for so long and so it
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.280]  directly affected every one of your listeners because they've artificially
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:31.920]  kept the price of gold way below where it should be if it go to kept pace with
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:35.600]  inflation it would be twenty three hundred dollars an ounce and even even
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.920]  trading with platinum another precious metal used to trade before the
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.440]  suppression scheme about the same price platinum I think it's 1730 dollars
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:52.160]  today and gold is something like 1140 absolutely the suppression of gold and
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:57.480]  silver is key to their entire derivatives fraud and allowed them to do what
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:03.800]  they've done now they're now calling for world government financial taxes VAT on
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:09.240]  all banks and institutions paid to the elite banks they're involved in all or
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.600]  nothing takeover right now and this information could bring them down you're
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.760]  starting to get some major traction break down how it works and the latest
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:22.280]  information well the gold antitrust action committee was formed in January
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.760]  1999 by my colleague Chris Powell myself but Chris is the editor of a daily
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:29.880]  newspaper and to expose the manipulation the gold price by a bunch of
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:33.840]  billion banks like Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase and then we realized that
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.560]  that the government was involved with also the Fed and the Treasury and we've
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:42.680]  been on this 11 years and that we finally got a little daylight I was on
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:47.160]  somehow I got a CNBC 11 years ago Ron and Son and that was the last time the
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:50.600]  American public heard from me in the mainstream we've been banned ever since
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.200]  and we got a break with this commodity futures trading commission where there's
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:59.920]  a great commissioner there named Bart Shilton was like Elliot Ness and he's
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:05.640]  really trying to do the right thing and he got me to got me on the docket to make
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:10.440]  a presentation in front of the CFTC and that was on television of course the only
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:15.960]  thing that the TV feed that went down was when I was speaking and as soon as I
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:19.520]  was done the feed gets back on it's very interesting because what most people
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.880]  don't know Chairman Getzer when it started said we know we're not going to
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.120]  get into specific allegations we're not we don't want to go there and Bart
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.920]  Shilton got to live it he went red in the face he said are we going to have
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:36.280]  censorship and Chairman Getzer back down and then the TV feed went off so but in
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:39.720]  that presentation I talked about how there's concentration of positions by
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:45.520]  JP Morgan Chase and HSBC and other big bank are ridiculous and they're way
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:49.720]  more than any other in any other commodity market in terms of this
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.760]  concentration issue and we then went on to explain you know what the
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:57.480]  manipulation was all about and so on so it was quite a show because they it was
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.960]  a whistleblower showed up and they wouldn't let him speak he was thought he
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.200]  was going to the name Andrew let's stop right there Mr. Murphy because I want to
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:09.560]  go over that and take your time on this but it seemed a backfire that they cut
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:14.720]  the TV feed when you were testifying because it was recorded it did end up
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:20.840]  getting out on the web and so I mean that really highlighted what you were
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:23.840]  saying for people and then that they wouldn't let the whistleblower speak I
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:29.800]  mean there's a serious cover up here go ahead yeah well there is and what
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.520]  happened was this whistleblower Andrew McGuire got a hold of one of our
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:38.120]  directors Adrian Douglas and we wrote up what Andrew McGuire had to say and
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:43.240]  basically he told the CFTC by emails three four five months in advance what
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:47.640]  shape Morgan JP Morgan was going to do ahead of time he says here's what they're
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:52.600]  going to do and when and it happened and we had these emails and I read out with
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.640]  JP Morgan that their traders were laughing at the public and ripping them
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:59.760]  off that they're making all this money the public is a bunch of dopes because
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.200]  they get suckered all the time by these people that are acting in a collusive
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:08.640]  action and so this the emails showed up you know wouldn't see it to see it
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:13.040]  afterwards I was able to present the press with these emails and so on and
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:18.000]  then the next day Andrew McGuire and his wife were hit by a car outside of London
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.600]  it was a wild story where he was hit and then the guy tried to get away and hit
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:26.000]  two more cars and there was a helicopter chase and you can't get much
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.440]  wilder than this did they catch the guy yeah but when we haven't heard a thing
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:35.080]  about it since that silence but they caught him well I don't know what's
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:42.720]  happened this is amazing again this is really at the foundation it's like one
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:48.320]  of the bottom cards in a giant tower of cards that are about to topple their
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:54.080]  manipulation of precious metals so please continue well you know we're one
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.040]  of our major issues especially if they were concerned about you know what gold
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:01.680]  and silver is really where the one of the people who's actually a critic of
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:06.080]  ours so we were to do conservative that basically there's the amount of gold and
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.200]  silver trading today is a hundred to one compared to what they they actually have
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:15.280]  there in the in London in their vaults and gold and silver and there's a we
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.440]  believe at some point just like what happened was made off when some of these
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.640]  other scandals should a lot of people all want to go get their gold so at the
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:27.120]  same time you could end up having a default and it's going to get quite
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.240]  wild I believe in the month ahead and the major thing is that we've now because
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:37.040]  of the CFTC appearance according to the mainstream it seems bizarre to me but I
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.640]  guess that gives us credibility so now there's a great deal more interest in
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:47.400]  what we have to say and it's spreading all over the world now in layman's terms
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:52.840]  explain to people why the system wants to suppress gold and silver and how they
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.560]  do it well they do it two ways one was physical gold which they have to put in
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.440]  the marketplace they take old surreptitiously from central banks and
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:03.000]  beat it into the system and then they use it with under with derivatives on the
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.360]  on the comics and other financial markets into when you say play with it with the
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:13.000]  price and in the paper market and one the banks make money by flushing the
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.320]  specs out and over the past even though we've been a 10-year bull market they
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:21.760]  do it all the time pick up 30 40 $50 at a pop and for the US government think
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:26.040]  about it what happens every time the price of gold goes nuts it's people say
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.800]  what it's too much inflation crisis bad for the dollar it's bad for wall
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:35.440]  street it's bad for the politician it's bad for business a rising gold prices
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:39.040]  is it the weather right or wrong suggested something's wrong at least
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:44.800]  that's what the because it reveals the worthless fiat nature of the hyper
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:49.280]  inflated derivative scam that's correct and I know that's also what it does
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.720]  in other words we're printing all this money and so on if the gold price
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:55.480]  would rally a hundred dollars tomorrow everyone would be jumping up and down
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.720]  about just what you're talking about but because they keep knocking it down
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:03.680]  this there's very little conversation it's kind of just subdued
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:10.480]  continue so it's I think it's going to get very exciting when it's ironic that
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.400]  God is very well known in Russia but hardly known at all the United States
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:21.440]  because we have no free press here and we had a conference in August of 2005
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.600]  which one of President Putin's top economic advisors Andre Baikov came
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.800]  price of gold was 436 and it wasn't going anywhere so it was the best
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:34.520]  company was ever at and two days later the gold price exploded and rallyed
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:39.520]  three hundred dollars in the next nine months and at that conference I said and
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:44.400]  was my opinion that it was 436 and the price of gold is going to go to three
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.280]  to five thousand dollars an ounce of that's what will be needed to clear the
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.120]  market so we have a long way to go for any of your listeners that are
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:54.940]  interested in what I believe is a great investment even though we've been up
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:18:00.040]  ten years in a row now and and clearly though they're losing control because
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:07.000]  it's gone from 300 bucks to 1145 where we stand today so if you look at the
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.360]  graph they're able to push the beach ball under water but then over time it
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:16.840]  continues to only go up they can't hold it down well it's a good point and what
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:20.640]  what we call it is it's a managed retreat what they do is they never allow
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:24.840]  too much excitement to ever enter the market for example seven times as
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:29.880]  your gold has gone up exactly 2% it's a book called a 2% rule right they don't
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.880]  allow it to go up more than that they they they work over the shares for
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.080]  example one of the big funds years ago Oppenheimer lent the chairs to JP
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:42.280]  Morgan one of the you know keep the camp you know Kings of the gold cartel to to
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:46.560]  work over the share market so they never allow too much excitement to enter the
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.240]  picture so gradually it's like a stealthful market some of it was an
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:54.760]  article the other day that said 93% of investors believe gold is going to go
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:19:02.160]  down from here if that isn't bullish I don't know what is absolutely so so 93%
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:06.360]  believe that it's going to go up no 93% think it's going to go down now
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:11.120]  there was isn't the public is either neutral to bear and by the way God has
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.360]  been right for the past ten years about what the price of gold was going to do
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:20.960]  yet if you go look at the records of the Wall Street firms they've been neutral
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:25.400]  to bearish almost every one of them all the way up I can't imagine any other
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:29.360]  sector or market where Wall Street could be so and there's still that way today
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:36.880]  because I'm not again to put that in layman's terms it's it's it's well
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:41.000]  there's nobody bullish and that when markets top out it's when everyone's
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.160]  bullish and there's too much excitement and through the hasn't there's almost no
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.760]  enthusiasm about gold now exactly but but the point is they're always saying
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:52.360]  because they're paid to and they're always wrong that it's gonna go down and
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:55.440]  it's a bad investment right but the people are ignoring them and they're
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:59.080]  losing all credibility stay there let's talk about this whistleblower story when

[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:28.960]  Bill Murphy the head of Gata reveals whistleblower and gold price
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:34.160]  suppression is the YouTube video they cut the TV feed when he testified and
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:38.840]  they wouldn't let Andrew McGuire the independent metals trader turn whistle
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.880]  blower at the center of a storm for exposing what is the largest fraud in
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:50.840]  history Max Kaiser a year before they took down Iceland was in the
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:55.360]  capital in the fanciest hotel in the bar and there were Goldman Sachs people
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.240]  bragging about what they were planning to do there and so he went out on TV about
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:03.160]  it and of course then later it happened but let's talk about this whistleblower
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:06.560]  himself I mean from your own research you can confirm but now you've gotten the
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:11.960]  emails and I remember for 10 years different whistleblowers went to the
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:17.440]  different federal regulatory agencies with dossier showing exactly how made
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:23.320]  off was stealing 50 to 100 depending how you look at it billion dollars and they
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.160]  would never do anything about that so please continue yeah well we we compare
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:30.440]  ourselves to Harry Markopoulos who went to the FCC for 10 years and to look at
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:35.000]  this it's a fraud we've been going to the CFTC for 10 years saying look at this
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.760]  is a fraud I met with the Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert the Senate banking
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:43.560]  committee to join economic committee we went to President Bush is a good friend
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:48.400]  here in Texas boyhood friends I got a fax back from Lawrence Lindsay is is the
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:52.080]  economic advisor time so we really gone after this thing and we really got a
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:55.640]  break here with this Andrew McGuire because he's a four ironically he's a
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:59.720]  former Goldman Sachs trader and it's another bar story what happened was he
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:02.880]  was out with these JP Morgan guys he's known him for years and they were
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:06.240]  laughing at him and they probably had built too much to drink was saying how
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:09.240]  you know how what what they were doing in the in the in the gold market and so he
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:15.880]  got bad and he said you know I mean this is just wrong and so that's when you know
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:20.520]  we got his information he's been a member of my my website LeMettropolecafe.com
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:27.120]  for three or four years I met him in London he's a stand-up guy he's a
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:30.240]  smart guy he deals with agent banks and in the
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:36.240]  bullion market and he just came forth and just dropped this bombshell on the
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:41.280]  CFTC so they're gonna have a tough time letting this one go because what do you
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:45.080]  explain to the public especially if these marked gold and silver markets blow
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:50.400]  up like we think is going to occur now now let's be specific and I've talked a
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:53.800]  lot of high-power people from Wall Street that also live here in Austin part
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:58.560]  of the year and and we've discussed this case and they say absolutely when you go
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:02.040]  to these elite bars and you're an elite trader with one of the big firms and
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:06.280]  you're in a different division they they are so arrogant and brazen all they
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.480]  talk about is how we're scum fools how they're gonna take over everything that's
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:15.480]  right and and and they just constantly laugh and joke and so the because they
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:18.920]  know the government is run by their alumni I mean look at Goldman Sachs
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.960]  they've got every major regulatory position filled well I have to treasure
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:25.640]  as a goldman I still call it government sex because half the people at the
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.120]  team at the Treasury come from Goldman Sachs just like JP Morgan is the
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:33.120]  feds bank but that's the issue is any people ought to start going into these
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:38.000]  bars these elite bars which better wear a $2,000 suit and and and and start
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.560]  just recording these guys but again he sent them emails and Andrew sent emails
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:48.240]  to the CFTC to their legal counsel saying here's what's gonna happen and
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.560]  when and he said watching it in certain days they seem to attack around job
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:57.320]  reports certain government auctions and the option expires install and he said
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:01.240]  this is exactly what they're going to do and the last time I think one point he
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.160]  mentioned it I think the price went down like 30 or 40 bucks
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:10.080]  for hours that's a lot so these things this is this is just a bombshell that's
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:16.160]  slowly working its way around and it's like and festering and it's finally it's
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:20.720]  given us the attention that we've earned after working on this stuff for over a
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.760]  decade and by the way we're not just we're not just idle just talk about
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:28.360]  we're suing the Fed it was very difficult today for me to listen to
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:33.880]  President Obama talk about transparency derivatives financial market reform when
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:37.760]  he's allowing what's occurring in the gold and silver markets so what we did
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.840]  President Obama wants more transparency we went to the Freedom of
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:46.480]  Information Act and God asked them to tell us what the US was doing in the
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:51.160]  gold swap area just a gold transaction kind of thing and they said got back to
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:56.120]  us and said no they're exempt from telling us that their secrets and so
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:59.480]  we're suing him in federal court to try to get to the truth it's the American
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:05.200]  people's gold not theirs well I mean come on Obama passed the stimulus package
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:09.320]  that gave banks more power and it retroactively let all the banks keep
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:13.120]  all their bonuses and run all their scams and it's not just me saying this I
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:16.840]  mean I'm reading what the Texas Banking Association saying and their analysis is
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:21.680]  identical to mine that this new regulatory framework of the G20 and the
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:26.200]  national level gives the select banks JP Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs and a handful
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:29.720]  of others the power to take over all the healthy regional banks that aren't in
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:35.440]  derivatives and sets up a value-added tax on all financial transactions that's
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:41.600]  paid to the coffers of the IMF and World Bank and then fenced directly in to the
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:46.360]  private central banks I mean this is so incredible and it's being billed as
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:49.720]  getting the rich bankers stay there let's talk about how they manipulate gold
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:56.080]  on the other side now we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones and
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:03.920]  the GCN radio network the question is where should the American people draw
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:11.360]  their line in the sand a republic is based on a constitution which
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:15.760]  protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:19.000]  voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land they think they're
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:24.760]  on our water children our education our money we have to define who we are and
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:29.680]  what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the patriot
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:34.480]  uprising we have the facts we have the Constitution we have the Bill of Rights
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:38.760]  we have common law knowledge is power ladies and gentlemen and I'm so excited
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:42.840]  to be able to offer you don't tread on me rise the republic tyranny is upon us
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:47.040]  but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising a new

[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:07.120]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:11.160]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:15.080]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:19.080]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:23.640]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:27.680]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:31.480]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:35.080]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:39.440]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:24.000]  bill murphy the chairman and director of gata gold antitrust action committee is
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.640]  our guest let's get back into more with the whistleblower said how we know the
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:34.680]  big banks and governments fix the price of gold and silver the way they make
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:39.280]  profits out of this how this is detrimental to the public and how we
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:44.360]  support gata and what you're doing because clearly there's a fuse going to
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:50.840]  this keg of TNT that could blow this this this this Ponzi scheme this fraud
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:56.400]  sky high and really reveal all these crimes that have been committed this is
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:00.640]  clearly illegal but we want to make sure that fuse that's now burning burns
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:06.280]  faster hotter and doesn't you know sometimes you light a firecracker it
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:11.240]  doesn't burn all the way it it it stops it sputters so how do we ensure this is
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:16.360]  a touchdown for the good guys well it shows like this are a big help Alex and
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:21.120]  and we're trying to be as as visible as possible because that's once people look
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:24.920]  at it and really study the evidence they go good grief and if I might say you know
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:29.440]  on some of the subjects you're talking about it's not just gold there's a lot
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:32.560]  of people that didn't talk about the punch protection team which is the working
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:36.760]  group and financial markets which president I think treasurer head of the
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:42.400]  SEC and head of the CFTC work to stabilize the markets and there's
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:45.240]  something I've never heard one other person mentioned called the counter
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:49.280]  party risk management group and if any of your people are interested they can
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:53.240]  do a Google counterparty risk management group and you'll see it's
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:57.560]  excuse me it's a group of the hedge funds and some of the big Wall Street firms
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:00.800]  and you'll see their their main mantra it's head up by a lot of the golden
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:05.880]  sex people is to create quote stability in the market and they're behind the
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:09.520]  scenes working on on the stock market that's one reason we believe you've
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:14.080]  had this steady up go you know cheese first seems like forever it just never
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:18.080]  seems to correct and just goes up a little bit every day and so on so it's
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:21.880]  pervasive in our markets in addition to gold and silver which by the way they're
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:25.920]  just they're tiny little markets for these people even if they lost money on
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.120]  this it's like would be like a lost leader for the government if you think
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.560]  of the trillions now when we talk in those numbers these days what the
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:35.600]  government's doing the little gold market it's just this little barometer
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.480]  that they want to have to use and that's why they work it over in the physical
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:42.800]  market and the derivatives and tack at certain times and flush out the
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:46.880]  speculators get people to moralize it then it goes right back up again like
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:50.480]  you said earlier like a beach ball it's emerge they can't keep it down and we'll
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:54.480]  be we have a we have a long way to go here and we're working very hard at it
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:36:00.760]  I talk about the gold market every day at LeMettropoleCafe.com and people can
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.600]  sign up for a two-week free trial then if they like it it's a subscription but
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:10.640]  the GATA site they do it at www.gata.org it's a free site Chris Powell puts out
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:14.200]  emails all the time he just does a fantastic job to alerting people what's
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:18.720]  going on so they can keep abreast of the situation and you know we know when we
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:23.480]  maybe we're gonna get a break with the district court in our lawsuit against it
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:26.640]  to try to get information from the Fed I know the Fed's petrified of the gold
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:30.440]  issue which is why they you know they they're fighting Ron Paul and his built
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:33.840]  on it said yeah because this isn't just a little bitty market I mean in the
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:38.800]  aggregate it is but it could become the biggest market and it would unseat all
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:42.520]  of their fraudulent paper and and and now we've got Bloomberg and others
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:46.800]  reporting federal regulators are going in telling public and private pension
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:54.240]  funds threatening them to invest people's savings in quote failed banks and so
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:37:00.480]  this is all coming to a head right now and this is so important to expose this
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:06.160]  situation I didn't mean by the way to diminish the gold and silver issue or
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:10.000]  the size of it just in terms of like if you talk about market caps or anything
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.640]  like this it's it's a tiny market but it's actually the most important market
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:17.720]  for just what you're talking about when that goes it would be headlines all over
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:21.480]  the world because gold silver not just American markets they're their world
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:26.560]  markets and it's going to be a major major story and it unseeds all of the
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:31.520]  major global currencies that are being debased in a concerted effort on record
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:35.240]  by the G20 so that people don't recognize it's kind of like in the US you
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:38.440]  know they've got a debased currency in Mexico because it's three to one four to
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:43.000]  one but instead now with the euro and all the other major currencies they're
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  devaluing them basically simultaneously yes that's right right right to the point
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.840]  matter of fact I mentioned Russia earlier like the NBC of Russia studio one
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:56.760]  came here about two weeks ago with a camera person and a reporter they're
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.840]  doing a big story on this and they said it's so ironic that God is very well
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:05.600]  known in Russia and not known at all in the United States well Russia if you
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:10.160]  actually Anthony Sutton and others got the US government documents on this and
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:15.800]  of course he worked for the Senate that the large central banks here and in
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:21.680]  England funded the communist and when the Russians in the late 90s kicked out
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:26.000]  the oligarchs it turned out they were all fronts for Western brokerage houses
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.600]  and banks and Russia's got its own problems but Russia is now in many
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:34.600]  cases more free market than we are they pay people to have children though our
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:38.600]  government wants a one-child policy they've arrested the oligarchs they're
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:43.880]  talking about world government they're talking about the new world order and
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:48.480]  they're covering all these subjects because for the first time in close to a
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:54.880]  hundred years there appears to be a real fissure between Russia and the Anglo
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:59.720]  American banking establishment well I know that the Bank of England has been
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:04.160]  very responsible for the gold price oppression scheme and right now it's a
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:08.480]  big deal the gold subject because Gordon Brown's running for reelection and he
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:12.120]  sold half their gold right at the bottom of the market and I've had this
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:16.400]  all laid out with his connection with Goldman Sachs the brilliant banks were
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:20.160]  in trouble back then they needed supply so he sold England's gold at the bottom
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:23.480]  it's costing billions and billions of dollars and we're trying to make some
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:27.760]  A with this one before the election over there in England absolutely that's the
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:31.320]  top of thing they do and of course you go back to 1933 when they made physical
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:36.200]  holding of gold illegal and then they jacked with the price a few years ago
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:40.360]  they doubled it after all our gold had basically been shipped to Europe so they
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:46.040]  run these scams other points that are important for people to be made aware of
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:50.840]  looking into your crystal ball and and talking to people in the markets I don't
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:54.360]  want you to make a prediction but if you had to deadwreck and how do you see this
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:40:00.160]  unfolding probably like every other scandal whether it's a revco a brokerage
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:05.640]  house or or Enron or made off it blows up and then all of a sudden everyone's
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:10.680]  run around say how could this have happened and everybody you know people
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:14.040]  delve into the facts of the story and that's how it's exposed unfortunately and
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:17.520]  it's likely gonna likely to be the way it's gonna happen here where silver and
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:21.760]  gold just absolutely explodes there's some defaults in the marketplace people
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:27.160]  can't deliver on their promises to deliver you know the physical bullying
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:31.160]  of people and it'll be a huge huge commotion that's how I think it's gonna
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:37.160]  play out what's the time frame next two three years yeah you know I guess Jesus
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:41.320]  so tough about the time frame you know it's me it could happen in two weeks or
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:45.800]  two years it's just one of these things had we not had the financial scandal made
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:49.600]  off would still be trucking right along and a lot of this is up to the listeners
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:53.640]  of this show we have several million listeners if they get the censored video
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:58.640]  of you and others out to people if they get the censored documents out if they
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:02.560]  put pressure I mean that's why Obama politically now is going after with the
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:07.160]  sec Goldman with you know five million dollar fine slap on the wrist an
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:11.560]  investigation maybe some underling will go on probation they're having to at
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:15.640]  least do that because it's political suicide if they don't we need to force
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:18.720]  this out all the way into the open because even though this is a white
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:23.200]  wash investigation it's now opening up more lawsuits it's now legitimizing
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:27.240]  those of us that have exposed the corruption of the main pilots of this
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:31.440]  banking cartel Goldman Sachs that's right the irony is is that it's right now
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:37.400]  the two hot shows are HSBC and JP Morgan Chase what Goldman Sachs was the ring
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.800]  leader in this thing for I don't know six seven eight nine years they've
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:43.680]  disappeared of late it might be because they're concentrating on the stock market
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:47.960]  I don't know but they had everywhere everywhere we look for a period of eight
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:52.080]  or nine years Goldman Sachs was everywhere on this particular issue yes
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:56.160]  yeah they're now top of the heap the top of the heap their underlings are now
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:01.520]  carrying on this operation oh yes I believe he is I think the most important
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:05.960]  point you made is 90 plus percent I think you have the number of 93 percent I'm
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:11.600]  looking at news today gold weaker as grease debt issue back on front burner
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:15.720]  well that's the same reason this is the commentary is ludicrous in this industry
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:20.720]  last week goes up because of the growth of the other great problems then it's
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:24.720]  down is if these people hit the market and they did then the reporters just talk
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:29.040]  about anything it's you can have a go quite go could be up 50 bucks on the
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:33.040]  on the on the Greek debt problems well that's what I was about to say just as
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:38.320]  a layman here but I've done a lot of research having major currency crises
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:43.080]  that even in the words of Merkel and the words of Soros could bring down the
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:48.960]  euro this could bring down the euro and by every barometer that should shoot
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:53.420]  gold straight up and there's all these headlines about gold down $5 or
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:58.040]  four and a half dollars but let me give you the exact number folks gold's down
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:03.320]  $4.70 right now and and the media is saying because currencies are in
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:07.960]  trouble currencies are ludicrous this is what happens over the years and we've
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:11.080]  seen this any followers I know there's a bunch of people listening on your show
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:15.200]  the worst the situation or the better it is for gold or the more reasons for
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:20.040]  people to go to gold that's when the gold cartel attacks the price because I
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:25.120]  want to diffuse the barometer tone down the thermometer they do it all the time
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:29.400]  it's it's just again it's ridiculous for for people to say gold's going down
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:35.480]  because of the crisis you know just it does no it is nuts but but again they
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:38.680]  know people are looking at a month to month or week to week graph you look
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:41.160]  at the year graph you look at the two year the three year the four year the
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:46.720]  five gold's going straight up and if it continues like this what another ten
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:52.760]  years we'll be looking at $2,000 announced $2,000 probably in another year not
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:57.720]  ten years well absolutely but I mean even in a suppressed market even if they
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:02.800]  continue this scam you know in ten years it would double again that's a great
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:06.160]  investment of course what's happening is they're running out of available
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:11.320]  central bank gold people think that the gold industry says there's 30,000 tons
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:14.680]  of gold and central bank balls will according to the work of our guys which
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:19.240]  are pretty pretty tough shelf guys there's less than 15,000 tons and European
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:22.840]  central banks were selling 4 to 500 tons of gold a year the past three or four
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:27.120]  months they haven't sold an ounce it's drying up it's think of an army that's
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:31.160]  running out of ammunition the bad guys are running out of ammunition all they
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:34.800]  can do is have a rear guard action but it's painful on these depths it's just
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:39.160]  it you know we should be at 2,300 not not not what we are here well I just did
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:43.720]  the math and and I was wrong I was just throwing you know a basic number out
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:49.960]  there if if gold is up almost fourfold in the last ten years then it's
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:56.000]  exponential if it was doubling you know basically every three four years then
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.400]  you're right another year and a half or so it should be well above 2,000 but but
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:04.240]  I was saying even in their rigged market you know we could be looking at 2,000
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:08.640]  3,000 4,000 the sky's the limit from all of your research and I know you guys are
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:13.080]  conservative where should gold be for real inflation right now $2,300
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:16.680]  that's what it would be and that's according to many other people had it
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:20.880]  kept pace with inflation and that's just the published inflation numbers much
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:25.640]  less the real inflation numbers so we have a long way to go again if I can
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:28.920]  stress this the bad guys are running out of ammunition to keep the price down
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:34.640]  and you're going to see some kind of major league fireworks sometime this year
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:40.600]  but they do have a lot of money behind the scenes they're running out of
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:44.400]  physical gold that's the proof that's their problem well they've gone through
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:50.040]  about a thousand tons per year for 15 years so what and there's a supply-demand
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:55.200]  deficit of say that amount and there they've kept the price under control on
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:59.920]  the way up by using this physical goal but they're hitting the wall one of our
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:04.040]  guys our consultants predicted if we had a conference in Durban South Africa
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:08.760]  May 10th 2001 he said in seven to ten years they're gonna run out enough gold
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:12.000]  to keep the price from really taking off well we're right in the middle of that
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:18.320]  zone right now Wow so we could see this in the next month of the next two years
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:22.480]  but time is on our side yeah it's coming and it's inevitable I mean it's just a
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:26.160]  matter of how much again how much ammunition they can come up with at a
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:31.680]  given time to meet the growing physical market demand so it's very exciting very
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:35.720]  frustrating on a day-to-day basis but again we've been up ten years in a row
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:40.840]  and as you said earlier the acceleration phase is still out of us all right in
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:45.640]  closing we have the head of Gata Bill Murphy chairman director of Gata on
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:49.320]  with us going back to the whistleblower you say he and his family were hit by a
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:54.320]  car remember seeing that in the news that the person ran and that we haven't
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:58.240]  heard what's happened since then how was Andrew McGuire doing if you had a
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:01.600]  chance to talk to him is he getting good he talks to my colleague Adrian Doug
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:05.840]  Doug was quite a bit he's getting there's a bunch of interviews people they're talking
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:11.280]  to him over there and I think he's going further with the legal counsel the CFPC
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:15.040]  so there's stuff going on behind the scenes and it's it's a process you know
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:19.160]  these investigations do take a long time on well let me do this with you let me
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:23.440]  put you on hold and have my producer talk to you I would like to get you or
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:28.480]  your other colleague on with mr. McGuire for a full hour sometime next week I
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:32.440]  think people need to hear directly from the whistleblower who saw these JP
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:36.600]  Morgan Chase people you know rubbing their hands together in Glee do you
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:41.040]  think that's doable mr. Murphy I'd be fine with me I have to go to Miami to
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:45.600]  meet somebody at the Financial Times next week but I'd love to do it it's a
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:49.520]  just have to see what Andrew's schedule is okay and you also talk about your
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:57.560]  other colleague I'm sure he'd love to do it sure I mean just the more the
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:00.240]  merrier getting your different perspectives here I want to thank you for
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:04.400]  your tireless 11-year effort it's certainly bearing fruit I mean there
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:10.280]  you were 260 something bucks an ounce back when you started and it's a 1145
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:15.680]  today and so we're having a great victory I'm gonna put you on hold sir and
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:20.840]  try to iron some of those basics out right now about getting the whistleblower
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:25.160]  on the show at your convenience Andrew McGuire perhaps we can get his contact
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:28.040]  info from you thank you so much for joining us sir
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:32.880]  anytime Alex all right amazing information we're gonna get his info now
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:43.400]  with jaren and get that set up I tell you folks AP sued now it's 10 years ago
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:48.560]  and got all the internal minutes of the meetings between the big 10 well companies
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:52.200]  how they said there's too much oil we're gonna promote peak oil we're gonna tell
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:55.640]  the school kids and everybody there's no oil we're gonna fund the environmental
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:00.480]  movement to brainwash people about this and we're gonna buy up the independent
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:05.840]  refineries and shut them down and we're gonna restrict oil that way and the
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.520]  Pentagon comes out last week and says there's no more oil and within two years
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:15.280]  you're all gonna be paying seven bucks a gallon water there's more water than
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:21.040]  ever there's all these ways to get water even in areas like southern California
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:25.160]  but they tell you even in areas of washing water like England oh you're
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:28.720]  gonna pay double triple quadruple now there's no water when England has more
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:32.760]  water than any other island nation and it's just the giant aquifers everywhere
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:38.360]  incredible precipitation huge reservoirs and it's just scams it's in here in
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:44.800]  Austin they just say hey we are going to give you a 2.6 billion this is Austin

[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:52.360]  than all the taxes every year combined just one new tax bigger than everything

[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:03.680]  going to do it we're lawless scum and who do they pay the money to the banks and
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:06.880]  the city of Austin has taken almost all the pension funds and invested it in the
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:10.360]  derivatives and now the bankers have come to them and said you better raise a
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:13.560]  bunch of taxes because there's gonna be no money and they go into I mean it's

[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:15.880]  all right we're back this is Ted Anderson I am covering for Alex for the
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:19.640]  moment on this particular segment he'll be back on again right after this but I
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:24.280]  just wanted to get in he asked me if I would come up during this segment he'll
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:30.240]  be back live tomorrow looking at the news I tell you there's so many stories on
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:33.440]  what's going on in gold I didn't know which one to touch but I think probably
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:37.560]  the one from Reuters is going to be the most significant one that'll affect
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:41.480]  people here in the United States and it just the the the heading says this US
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:47.040]  golds gains as safety play after Greece rate cut and what does that mean well
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:52.800]  Moody's stepped in and downgraded the credit rating of Greece down to you
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:58.720]  know junk bond status and why is that significant here in the United States and
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:02.560]  the reason the probably the main reason that I can think of is that the United
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:08.920]  States is about two years behind Greece as far as how much how much government
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:16.000]  obligation there is in relationship to to the GDP or the production of what the
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:21.360]  United States citizens produce once we get up above a hundred percent of our
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:27.040]  GDP we're going to be sitting in the same position as Greece and that means
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:31.320]  that we're going to have to pay higher interest for people to lend us money
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:36.760]  driving our costs up on our debt and the United States can't even afford its
[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:41.680]  obligations where we're at right now with zero percent interest you know if
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:45.560]  the people that are trading in the bond market knows what this means for those of
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:49.640]  you have further interest and would like to know what's going on in the markets
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:54.440]  what does this mean to you how will this affect your portfolio the best
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:58.880]  suggestion that I can give you is picking up a subscription to Bob Chapman's
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:02.560]  newsletter the international forecaster I mean he really does cover this he
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:07.200]  covers it well he explains it in layman's terms that the average person can
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.320]  understand you don't have to be a sophisticated investor to figure out
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:15.640]  what the heck he's trying to say higher interest rates just means a slowing of
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:21.880]  the economy it means a higher cost to the anybody that's trying to borrow money
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:26.520]  including if you're looking to buy a home or anything like that and and of
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:29.520]  course the United States obligations to go up through the rough I don't know
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:32.800]  how they're gonna cover it there's just simply not enough money being taxed out
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:36.720]  of the citizens you can't take more than they're already taking it's
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:42.240]  it's way past what I considered a safe zone and of course that's what's
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:46.240]  inspiring people to buy gold and that's what's pushing investors into the gold
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:53.240]  at this time we have gold running up as high as $1233 an ounce today and and
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:58.320]  you know no kidding because Europeans are watching this happen to them and now
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:01.520]  here in the United States we're gonna be suffering through the same process that's
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:05.480]  just it's a shame that we put ourselves into this position there's no excuse for
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:09.960]  it but we are still offering if you want that international forecaster
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:16.520]  subscription for free Bob charges $159 per year but if you buy one Frank from
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:22.640]  us at 265 we'll buy that subscription for you and I mean I do buy it I mean I
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:26.320]  have to pay Bob for this but we'll buy it for you and you'll either get it by
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:31.040]  email four times a month or you're gonna get it by snail mail two times a month
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:35.480]  but either way I just need to say it's what you need to do if you want to
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:39.960]  understand what's going on in the marketplace right now gold is trading
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:44.640]  at that 1230 level so it is going up prices are rising due to the fact that
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:49.080]  there we're having further erosions in Europe and the Europeans are starting to
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:53.240]  shore up their portfolios and they know that there's a risk in buying US
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:58.920]  government treasury bills treasury bills are that are the obligations in the
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:03.880]  United States that come due every 30 60 90 days because they have such a short
[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:09.880]  term expiration period and they have a tendency to have very little fluctuation
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:13.640]  in the marketplace again if you need to understand what affects long-term bonds
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:22.480]  get Bob newt Chapman's newsletter by calling us a 1-800-686-2237 just pick

[02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:15.920]  so Bob Chapman I can't say on air what TV network the person works for that you
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:21.880]  were just mentioning can I I don't think you should they know that they monitor
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:26.440]  all these programs they just get more mad and try to figure out what to do
[02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:31.440]  about it but these people aren't gonna go away and we're not gonna go away
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:36.320]  either and we're just gonna keep on doing what we're doing which is waking
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:40.880]  people up to the truth and it'll all fall in place and and if we don't do a
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:45.320]  good enough job he'll step in the Lord and he'll help us just like you said
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:49.360]  earlier so let's just keep on doing what we're doing but you're gonna help us
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:54.760]  out there especially help people like the gentleman and his wife who just on
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:58.840]  here it's incredible what they're going through and I'm sure these sort of
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:05.000]  things are going on throughout the country and I see reports every day
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.160]  that dwarf even that it's just I know these people it's it's it's it's
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:12.440]  happening all around us for the average person in government those even
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:15.440]  involved in corruption they're compartmentalized they don't get the big
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:18.960]  picture they haven't studied it I mean now the government's openly announcing
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:23.040]  every week they're gonna start taking pension funds I mean that's now what the
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:25.680]  good guys do and they're gonna use Homeland Security to make sure it
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:29.880]  happens I mean this is pure evil they've thrown their lot in with pure evil
[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:34.920]  it's not too late for a lot of these guys that work for evil to make the
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:41.920]  decision to join the Patriots an exit and you know that's where they get them
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:46.120]  they they need to make a living and of course the economy is terrible and if
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:49.800]  you leave your post to where are you gonna work they're not even hard at heart
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:54.920]  hiring garbage garbage collectors it's bad out there and it's gonna get a lot
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:59.960]  worse and so these people one of them are trapped they say well I don't want to do
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:04.320]  that well if you don't you're out of here you just like the the policeman they
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:09.680]  say look you're gonna write 40 tickets a month and that's the end of it if you
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:14.480]  don't you know you're gonna either be demoted or we're gonna replace you and
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:17.840]  then they lie about it and say there aren't quotas but now they admit there's
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:24.040]  quotas finally after you know what a hundred years
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:29.120]  you know some states are really dreadful and I gotta let it today from
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:33.920]  someone who lived in New Jersey and he's I mean it's incredible I mean they
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:39.080]  they need to raise revenues so badly but they're there it doesn't matter whether
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:43.720]  you break the law and fractions they're gonna pull you over anyway
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:48.080]  if they need the money well that's what Robin Hood went through and that's what
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:51.840]  all of our ancestors regardless of what color you are where you came from this
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:54.800]  is the old fight you get corrupt government it gets filled with
[02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:59.200]  criminals they start robbing everybody and there's no doubt we've got a really
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:04.480]  bad brand of tyranny taking over the West but the people are waking up Dr.
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:07.600]  Frederick Whitehurst thinks things are better now than they were a decade ago
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:12.640]  we just now know things are bad so it seems like it's worse he thinks the tide
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:20.080]  is starting to turn do you agree don't know I hope he's right but I never do
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:26.720]  things on hope I always try to deal with the cold hard facts that I can see and
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:31.920]  what I might be able to back into knowing the only way you can understand
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:37.000]  these people particularly at the other level upper levels is understanding the
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:43.320]  very sophisticated criminal mind and if you can understand whether you know the
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:48.040]  next thing that this criminals gonna do you can stop them and we know what they
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:54.680]  gonna do the invisible government right there you've got it right there in the
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:59.200]  DVD that's what we're gonna get out to people so they can better understand
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:04.520]  what they're dealing with people in $4,000 suits running around robbing the
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:10.400]  world do you agree that they're gonna stage events very very soon to be blind
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:16.080]  on the tea party yes and it just won't be the tea party to be all over the place
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:21.040]  and they don't have to be major events they can be small ones that they want
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:26.480]  to keep people's minds and turmoil that's why they create these wars people
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:30.760]  don't worry about economics and finance that they think the three boys who are
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:36.240]  over in Afghanistan Iraq and say Haiti are gonna get killed tomorrow morning
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:39.720]  they're more concerned about that and that's why they have these words of
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:43.480]  course they want to get rid of people too and they want to destroy the economy
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:47.240]  so that everybody's too busy trying to pay the rent and pay the car payment the
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:52.080]  insurance payment or fighting off the CPS to stand up against corruption Bob

[02:06:00.620 --> 02:06:04.000]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.960]  generator. Number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:12.200]  triple your electric bill. Number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:16.480]  much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true total government
[02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:20.840]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number
[02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:24.920]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:29.480]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four
[02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:33.600]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of
[02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:37.560]  families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five a solar power
[02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:41.400]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks I
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:44.080]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:50.080]  Science one of my old sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[02:08:01.880 --> 02:08:10.320]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:17.200]  A couple months ago Texas Monthly, I guess we're four now, called me to an in-depth
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:20.480]  interview. I thought it was going to be a bad hit piece because mainstream media
[02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:25.560]  always does hit pieces but it was pretty fair. I mean I'd say 80% accurate and I'd
[02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:28.960]  actually interviewed the reporter who exposed truly a Texas drug dealing and
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:33.360]  how they had right at half the black population of the town in the jail owned
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:37.280]  by the local boss hog and they were planting drugs on him and that's Nate
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:43.600]  Blasley and then they said yeah we've got Dan Winters doing the photo shoot and I
[02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:49.440]  don't, I mean I like photography but I'm not a photography expert or a
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:53.120]  photography buff but I knew the name Dan Winters because he's in the top two or
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:56.920]  three, four reporters not just in the U.S. but in the world. Time magazine,
[02:08:56.920 --> 02:09:02.840]  Newsweek, I mean you name it, this guy has photographed all the top politicians,
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:06.960]  all the top writers, all the top spiritual leaders, Hollywood folks, Brad Pitt,
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:10.320]  you name it, we're going to be showing some of those images for PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:16.440]  viewers, for radio listeners they can go to danwintersphoto.com and look at some
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:20.680]  of these and so I mean I don't know who top photographers are but I knew who Dan
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:25.280]  Winters was and then he built a whole stage, a whole set for me out in his
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:29.440]  place out in the Texas Hill Country and then he was telling me in between the
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:34.160]  shoots you know all these wild stories about different politicians or people he
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:39.640]  refused to photograph or and so he's here until the end of the show end of the
[02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:43.920]  hour and so we're very very honored to have him here with us Dan Winters began
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:47.000]  his career in photography as a photojournalist in his hometown in
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:51.480]  Ventura County California widely recognized for his celebrity portraits,
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:55.320]  scientific photography and photojournalistic stories, he's won over 100
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:10:00.160]  national and international awards, his wide range of publications and clients
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:03.240]  include Esquire, Fortune, Entertainment Weekly, Texas Monthly Rolling Stone,
[02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:09.040]  Nike, Microsoft, Warner Brothers and Sony and in 2003 Dan was honored by Kodak as
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:15.680]  photo icon in their biographical legends series so he is a photography icon and
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:19.080]  he is here with us Dan thanks for being here. Good to see you Alex, good to see you.
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:24.640]  You bet. Last time it was under totally different circumstances but I'm at the
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:28.280]  receiving end of the sharp stick now rather than you so it's good to be here.
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:31.720]  Well I tell you you did an amazing job I mean yeah I was pretty thrilled. These are
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:34.120]  some incredible photos in fact we'll put some of the photos he took of me up
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:37.760]  there and then some of the others. You're here I appreciate you coming in I mean
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:41.560]  you're on the big conspiracy terrace show. Yeah that's good that's good I'm you
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:44.640]  know the thing about you and the thing about what you do and what you guys do I
[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:49.680]  think is that you know it's more than a full-time job to keep keep track of all
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:54.800]  this stuff and so you know you know the normal Joe goes to work he comes home
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:58.720]  from work he kicks back he has his beer he watches Fox News he doesn't have time
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:02.160]  to pay attention to stuff and so I've always admired people regardless of
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:05.360]  whether a position was that kind of really pay attention to this stuff and
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:09.280]  you know I've done I've dabbled in it you know and I think the most kind of
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:14.480]  almost one of the most sort of insulting or at least kind of patronizing sort of
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:18.160]  responses that that people give me whenever I talk about these issues is
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:23.840]  you know instantly that you're like demoted to oh you're a conspiracy
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:27.520]  theorist rather than having like an open-minded conversation about something
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:31.280]  that you've looked into it's like you know I looked into you know flight 93 for
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:35.120]  example you know I became curious I'm interested in aerospace I heard some of
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:38.120]  the reports well you know they were making cell phone calls and this and
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:41.520]  that and I'm like well you know the infrastructure for a cell phone call from
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:45.920]  30,000 feet isn't in place and it's you know I have no idea what happened it's
[02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:49.440]  neither here nor there but I question it from like a scientific standpoint like
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:52.480]  well how did that happen you know so I start researching that and I start
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:56.120]  researching like capabilities in the Eastern corridor altitudes that cell
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:12:00.000]  phone signals will reach etc etc and it like doesn't make sense you know and
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.600]  then there's all these cell phone or communications experts and technicians
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:06.920]  and you know electronics technicians that you can find online that are saying
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:10.880]  like hey you know it's neither here nor there but I can tell you right now that
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:14.040]  no one made a cell phone call from 30,000 and it came out last year in FBI
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:18.120]  documents that the solicitor general had never got a call from his wife and
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:23.680]  didn't talk to her FBI admitted that it came out two weeks ago the ACLU sued and
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:27.040]  got the documents where Cheney ordered the commission not to look at the attacks
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.320]  and it was a cover-up we have six of the ten commissioners saying it's a criminal
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:33.760]  cover-up John Farmer but then we're not supposed to even ask questions as
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:36.880]  citizens I know we're supposed to sit down and shut up well you know you look
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:39.640]  at it too and you look at the evidence and you look oftentimes what happens is
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:43.760]  with any crime scene is you know the first responders are the only ones that
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:47.360]  get any imagery after that it's completely closed off so they made this
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:53.240]  like ridiculous airplane-shaped pit in the ground that had some smoldering
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:56.840]  numbers almost like they put some charcoal in there and ignited it you know
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:01.000]  and the official sort of FBI and they handled it as crime scenes so the FBI
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:05.160]  handled the site the FBI shouldn't is that right yes so they made this really
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:09.720]  ridiculous looking airplane-shaped crater that was smoldering and that was
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:15.080]  obviously to sort of you know to please the media with you know some sort of
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:19.560]  like visual and and and there was this ridiculous diagram that came out that I
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:25.680]  saw that I wish I had actually brought that was the official FAF FBI version
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:28.640]  of how the crash took place and what happened and so basically what they said
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:33.640]  is the airplane came down in a straight dive hit the ground and the entire plane
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:36.920]  went under the ground that and they had a diagram they'd drawn meanwhile
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:40.360]  separately the state police said an eight mile debris field engines five
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:44.240]  miles away I know I know which indicates high altitude you know
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:48.680]  catastrophic failure at high altitude which indicates a missile obviously you
[02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:52.160]  know you know it's kind of like it's the most ridiculous thing and and once
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:55.040]  again you know my friends instantly you know they're like well what do you think
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:58.160]  happened what do you think this what do you think that I'm like you know look I
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:02.800]  don't know I don't I don't know why I don't know how I I can tell you though
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:06.800]  that that aircraft didn't hit the ground in one piece because obviously you know
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:10.840]  an engine isn't gonna end up five miles away from a crash site you can look at
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:14.800]  you know crash site after crash site after crash site that you know that's
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:18.640]  been investigated by the FBA that's widely photographed and when a plane you
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:23.600]  know breaks up an altitude the debris field you know flight 111 over over you
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:30.280]  know in new Lockerbie no no that was 111 was the one in in Nova Scotia Nova
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:34.120]  Scotia yeah that was the we know debris fields even when they crash into
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:37.760]  mountains or fields that they're normally hundreds and hundreds of yards long
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:41.320]  absolutely contained reasonably contained right but at altitude the
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:45.360]  Lockerbie one how big was the debris field there massive yes high altitude
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:49.920]  burst etc so you know it's one of the things where it's so insulting you know
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:53.560]  if you do you know if you if you have an open mind you have an understanding of
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:56.440]  some of these things which you know I'm interested in these things and you do
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:01.720]  two hours of research with existing imagery you you know it's it's ludicrous
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:06.120]  that you would try to be sold that line then you've got building seven well
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:08.880]  building seven I know you're an expert on I don't know as much about it but I
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:12.560]  have researched the panic on one quite a bit and that's another one that's
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:17.400]  absolutely ludicrous there's no engine holes and there's a 16-foot hole there's
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:20.880]  a 16-foot hole no engine holes and if you know you know the structural
[02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:24.000]  integrity of an aircraft once it's compromised those things are made out
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.480]  of thin aluminum they you know once it's compromised those things well you know
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:31.920]  they'll crush so easily right but the engines are these masses right of
[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:36.120]  titanium they're heavy heavy heavy they're not gonna break up though you know
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:41.200]  it's like if you see any imagery of car bombs in the Middle East for example you
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:44.200]  know you have the entire car completely disintegrated right but there's always
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:48.000]  an engine block sitting there that thing does not break up you know it's the one
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.560]  piece that like stays intact so you know when you see well you even on the
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:56.280]  debris field in flight 93 right the debris fields eight miles wide there's
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:59.600]  an engine five miles away the photographs of the engine are the engine is
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:04.760]  intact it's an engine so when in it when the when the when the cruise missiles
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:09.280]  what I think in it hit the Pentagon on either side of that hole there should
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:12.520]  have been massive holes and the windows aren't even broken it's like it was
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:16.720]  insulting and then later after hours of fire part of the roof caves in exact and
[02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:20.360]  they try to show that on the news we have hundreds of these big high-def photos
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:23.600]  that the government even took and it's a smoking hole that looks like a perfect
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:27.120]  missile blasts and everybody smelled cordyte then they released some blurry
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:31.160]  image six years after that doesn't even show anything and say there's the
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:34.520]  there's the plane exactly meanwhile they had hundreds of high-def cameras they
[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:38.040]  won't release those right of course and and the in the one image that they do
[02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:43.400]  release if you lay a fifth 757 over the size of that image it's dwarfed you know
[02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:47.840]  it's a small it's a small it has a small profile small signature and 757 would
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:51.360]  dwarf that thing and make a bigger hole and the wings and the engines it's it's
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:56.440]  like ludicrous and the fact that it you know happened to hit the you know mainly
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:17:00.880]  unoccupied section of the Pentagon right it was under construction why did they
[02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:03.920]  think we're so dumb I don't know I don't know and you know the other thing too is
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:08.920]  I know a lot of pilots I've flown quite a bit in my life the idea that you know
[02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:14.120]  setting up an approach to hit a runway starts 20 or 30 or 50 miles away from
[02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:17.760]  the runway as you get into your approach you set it up and you go into like a
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:22.320]  controlled descent and basically you fly the aircraft right to the ground right
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:26.200]  so the idea that these guys and you know it's precision it's precision to hit a
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:30.840]  runway it's precision to hit the end of runway and so you and so what you do is
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:36.320]  you you take these guys that supposedly like took some classes on how to steer
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:40.240]  an aircraft and you're trying to sell me the idea that they were able to hit the
[02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:45.520]  Pentagon precisely put it into a put it into a controlled descent get into
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:49.680]  ground effect and you know hit it like what 12 feet above the ground like
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:53.720]  perfect like perfect like hundreds of top pilots said they couldn't do that on
[02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:56.880]  their best day I know they couldn't even do it they couldn't be that precise
[02:17:56.880 --> 02:18:00.200]  with it because you know getting in into ground effect where you're riding on
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:05.040]  that air cushion and ride it right into that even when they've had 50 60 miles to
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:09.640]  get ready you come in and only the best pilots can set them down smooth but
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:14.120]  still you they have to time it just right and that's why runways 9,000 feet and
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:17.480]  the plane comes in like this it doesn't come in near them perfectly it's
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:20.480]  ridiculous so tell me about building 7 because you know more about that no no
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:24.080]  Dan we've got you here that's why I knew you'd be perfect for radio because you
[02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:26.400]  and I were just you know really hit it off and we're talking you said you had a
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:30.400]  lot of friends that were listeners and I'm just honored to have you here and I

[02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:01.720]  I don't know I feel really fortunate about it but also I on some level I'm not

[02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:12.600]  radio network well one of the top photographers in the world I mean I've
[02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:16.400]  looked him up as some say the top photographer in the world I mean there's
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:19.280]  no one more prolific and we're honored to have him we're gonna be scrolling
[02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:24.720]  through some of the politicians movie stars you name it religious leaders that
[02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:29.120]  he has photographed a prison planet dot TV viewers or you can go to Dan Winters
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:33.640]  photo.com to see a lot more because he has computers in his office and I'd be
[02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:38.520]  seeing photos of Schwarzenegger and photos of Al Gore but they're all so
[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:43.760]  unique and and just almost like a lens take the spirit of somebody and then
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:47.160]  magnify it I think that's what Dan Winters does and we're gonna talk about
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:53.080]  how you're able to do that or is it just a kind of a idiot savant I'm saying
[02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:55.640]  you're an idiot you know what I mean like some some I mean I see I think of
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:58.640]  myself with political stuff sometimes it's just you just know you have that
[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:03.080]  talent but going back to the term conspiracy theorist you're right it's
[02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:08.200]  just a label they throw on people to say oh this information can't be looked at
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:13.400]  this information it's a way to downgrade it but really just questioning the
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:17.200]  system is what any free humans supposed to do I mean here's the globe and mail
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:21.840]  today the dangerously unbalanced world of global governance they're admitting
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:25.160]  world governments being established it's run by the banks but but then they
[02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:28.440]  say you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't want to be a slave of banks exactly
[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:32.200]  exactly and then there's that you know and I'm sure you've probably used the
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:35.960]  quote on your show probably on more than one occasion but there's that great
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:41.000]  quote by gearing from the Nuremberg trials that says you know the normal
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.760]  people don't want war but after all it's not the normal people that are making
[02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:48.240]  the policy you know the it's the politicians that are making the policy
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:51.400]  and it's very easy to bring the normal people along all you have to do is
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:54.600]  convince them that they're being attacked and denounce the pacifist the
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:59.440]  pacifist for lack of patriotism patriotism it works every time and that is
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:03.040]  so true you know the the whole idea of like questioning anything I mean even
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:07.040]  the fact that you know how contrived the term patriot act was you know so it
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:10.720]  implies that if you like if you resisted at all that oh man you're not
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:14.440]  patriotic or the new freedom initiative to put half of America's kids on
[02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:18.840]  psychotropic drugs that's a new freedom yeah absolutely absolutely what about
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:22.320]  the I mean talk locally you know what about the the police chief in Austin
[02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:27.040]  with the mandatory you know if you refuse breathalyzer the mandatory blood
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:30.600]  test without even having warrants where they take you to a hospital and they
[02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:34.440]  violate your physical body to get blood out of you and now they're trying to the
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:38.360]  cops to do it it's unbelievable to me that anybody would stand for that for
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:42.120]  one second I mean clearly historically there's been policies that have been
[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:45.600]  administered that if you know if it's taken a while to get rid of them because
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:48.680]  you have to go through the appellate courts into the Supreme Court and then
[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:52.080]  suddenly it's deemed like unconstitutional but in the meantime you
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:55.520]  know people are being and believe me you know I think drunk driving is aberrant
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:58.840]  and I would not participate in at all but the idea that you can actually like
[02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:02.240]  take blood out of someone's body well they undermine the Bill of Rights and
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:06.120]  Constitution for a supposed greater good but we know they're scientifically
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:09.840]  really just targeting the general population it's like homeland security
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:12.480]  we've gotten their internal documents it's really all pointed at the American
[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:16.800]  people from the beginning absolutely I did a I did a really interesting piece
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:20.760]  and I wish I had actually given you the photograph but I was hired by a magazine
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:28.200]  to actually Esquire and they were doing a piece on the FA on FAA and the and the
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:35.160]  TSA people and the way they screen and that what the the the guy that is was
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:40.400]  the head of the program within the FAA to test screening and he was at X Navy
[02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:45.160]  Seal and his job he had a small group of individuals and their job was to breach
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:48.720]  airport security and so what they would do is they'd look for patterns they'd
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:52.000]  go into airport they'd look for patterns they do exactly what you would do if you
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:55.640]  were trying to breach our airport security you would educate yourself on
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:27:58.920]  what it was on their on their methods on their means and then you would do it
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:03.000]  right so the whole idea of like the TSA screening and stuff while I agree there
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.760]  should be some kind of you know checks and balances for people getting on an
[02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:11.480]  airplane it's such a band-aid when we go on jobs we carry on you know $25,000
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:15.920]  with the cameras and we carry them on and it's a big case full of electronic
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:21.840]  equipment that no one in no one in the TSA has any idea what they're looking at
[02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:24.560]  and they'll open it up and they'll kind of look through it and they'll close it
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:28.120]  up I mean who knows what the hell those well we know and then they've admitted
[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:32.240]  all this TSA grabbing women's breasts grabbing men's genitals putting us
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:37.760]  through naked body scanners is to train us to have our privacy violated space
[02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:43.520]  violated yes exactly exactly so give back that s-square story so I the guy
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:47.960]  who's writing are the guy that's being focused on as a guy that's the head of
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:53.960]  this you know sort of like rogue entity within the TSA slash FAA whose job is to
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:57.600]  violate our breach airport security so you know what they do is they look for
[02:28:57.600 --> 02:29:00.560]  patterns and he came up with this whole method at Kennedy said look you know
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:03.760]  there's like three flights to the Middle East at like four o'clock in the
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:07.960]  afternoon out of Kennedy and he said we've watched very closely the way TSA
[02:29:07.960 --> 02:29:10.560]  goes through stuff and they basically don't even look at anything the stuff's
[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:13.680]  going on so he said that would be a prime target so they make a bomb looking
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:17.560]  device they put it in a bag and it gets through so he was doing this so my
[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:21.280]  assignment from magazine was okay why don't you what we need you to do is we
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:25.640]  need you to figure out how to take down an aircraft so I said okay so once again
[02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:29.880]  I go online I spend maybe six seven hours researching it I figure out what kind
[02:29:29.880 --> 02:29:34.600]  of explosive to make how you can make it it's not detectable by any of the carbon
[02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:39.480]  based testing methods that the TSA uses Dan winners got a break that was a

[02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:30.720]  archived at prison planet dot tv charlie sheen quits two and a half men and i'll
[02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:35.920]  normally get into entertainment news but this is not really stemming from the
[02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:39.360]  problems he's had you know good friend of mine nine eleven truth or really smart
[02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:42.640]  guy great guy i can just tell you all the stuff you've heard in the news it's
[02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:49.680]  made up or exaggerated uh and uh his enemies will you know declare victory
[02:33:49.680 --> 02:33:55.440]  but a year ago he told me he wanted this to be his last season and uh just a few
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:34:00.160]  months ago he told me before the thing happened on christmas day uh that he
[02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:04.080]  probably wasn't gonna re-up his tv show but here's the new york post troubled
[02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:08.320]  charlie sheen says he's leaving hit cbs tv show two and a half men at the end of
[02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:13.200]  the season sheen who returned to a men's set last month after stent rehab
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:16.880]  will call it quits after taping his final episode april night see that's not even
[02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:20.080]  true i know charlie wasn't drinking wasn't using drugs drinks way too much
[02:34:20.080 --> 02:34:24.960]  coffee and smoked marlboro reds so i spent a lot of time with him uh but
[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:30.320]  he went to a uh basically a spa so that under the stress he wouldn't go back on
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:33.680]  alcohol or drugs he'd been off of for years so that's a lie here from his
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:40.480]  enemy the new york post uh but um his uh spokesman um stan rosenthal did not
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:45.040]  deny the report charlie's deal is only through this current season he told
[02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:48.960]  people so there's the inside scoop here folks charlie quit because he wants to
[02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:55.040]  spend time with his family and a sick of eight plus seasons and the new york
[02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:58.800]  posts and others are spinning this like his problem with his wife brook
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:02.080]  who's a nice person like that's why he's quitting that may have been the cherry
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:06.080]  on top but uh there's that info dan i apologize for digressing off into fluff
[02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:09.360]  but charlie's my friend i wanted to back him up and set this the record straight
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:12.000]  i don't think it's fluff he's done some good work i think
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:15.680]  well you know everybody's human and people love to see somebody big
[02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:18.960]  in trouble and and you know even when limbaugh got caught
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:23.680]  in stuff worse than what she's involved in i wasn't sharing his downfall
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:26.960]  even though i disagree with him passionately because i just don't
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:30.400]  i only cheer for real tyrants going down you know people like hitler or
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:33.520]  stalliner mount i agree totally and i think the i think
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:36.640]  you're absolutely right about it i think we love watching people ascend the
[02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:39.600]  ladder but we like watching the ladder fall over much better
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:43.440]  and it's you know what i think it is is i think that you know the
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:47.280]  the the media and the way the media works and the way publishing works etc
[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:50.720]  and i'm a part of it so i mean i'd be one i you know i should be pointing the
[02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:53.440]  finger back at myself but the idea is to create a lure
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:56.720]  to create a lure so that someone feels larger than life and i think
[02:35:56.720 --> 02:36:00.480]  you know we talk about uh why film and why
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:04.480]  celebrities specifically like actors and and film why
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:08.160]  for some reason it is such a part of our collective consciousness and i think
[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:11.280]  it's for that very reason you know i can go see
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:15.280]  i can go see the hurt locker and you can go see the hurt locker completely
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:19.040]  separately but we have a we have a an experience
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:22.480]  that provides connectivity and so you and i both now
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:26.320]  are connected through seeing that film we can talk about it we can talk about
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:29.040]  the issues around it etc so i think that's one reason and
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:32.880]  you know it stems and i think it's sick wanting to see somebody fall
[02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:36.160]  when this happens to our own families and neighbors this is sick this shows a
[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:39.840]  sickness and i see it getting progressively worse that people love
[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:43.200]  to see somebody in trouble but but but i interrupted you go ahead
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:46.880]  well i think to get to what you're saying right now too i think that
[02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:50.320]  you know i think that when someone gets really angry
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:54.400]  at someone who's suffering rather than look at it from love and detachment and
[02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:57.920]  with compassion i think it says something about the individual
[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:01.120]  you know that's that's throwing the stones you know he
[02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:04.640]  he who is without sin may he cast the first stone i mean to
[02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:08.400]  do a biblical quote it's absolutely spot on you know we are all
[02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:11.920]  we're all fallible we're all failed we all have our own problems
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:15.360]  i realized several years ago that you know the one thing that we all have in
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:19.520]  common is that we all have problems period we all have problems and i think
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:22.560]  our role in life is to try to work through those problems and that's the
[02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:25.840]  human condition absolutely 100 so yeah it is
[02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:30.000]  yeah i only want to bring down people that are hurting masses of innocents and
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:34.000]  who are consciously setting people up consciously hurting others
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:38.400]  consciously launching wars torturing people betraying
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:42.080]  that's why i hate these politicians and bush of course and obama
[02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:46.320]  expanding wars wiretapping continuing the torture continuing the arrest
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:50.880]  and and watching him use all of this hope that people had put into him against
[02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:53.760]  them and again i don't personally hate obama i know
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:57.760]  he's a puppet who they plan to destroy it's just that i
[02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:02.880]  realize that the institution itself is just so ruthless yeah the institution
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:06.320]  and i think that's a good point i worked with i worked with him
[02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:08.880]  you know he seemed like one of those guys you'd want to go out and have a beer
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:12.320]  with he seemed like a totally cool guy i believe truthfully that when he was
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:15.920]  campaigning he has a lot of you know ethos that he
[02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:19.440]  adheres to that he really believes in but i think when you get in that office
[02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:22.480]  and they see the first day that you're briefed
[02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:26.000]  you know it's all bets are off you know i mean the first day was like a work
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:29.680]  closing closing guantanamo and i saw a photograph recently that was the most
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:34.160]  ironic photograph it was a picture of one of the one of the guards or one of
[02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:37.120]  the um you know one of the officials at guantanamo
[02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:40.960]  hanging his photo up in the lobby when you come in
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:44.480]  you know it's the most ironic image considering you know if you've ever been
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:47.360]  to a military installation when you walk in the main building
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:50.720]  there's the chain of command so you know you walk in a building during bush's
[02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:53.520]  administration and bush was in the middle and then on either side there
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:56.080]  were photographs of the chain of command that goes down
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:38:59.200]  so at guantanamo there's the chain of command and there's
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:02.320]  obama the photograph of obama right in the middle and you know
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:06.160]  true once again you know i mean i i i truly believe like i wouldn't
[02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:09.360]  i wouldn't i won't weep when kissinger drops i won't week when rock
[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:13.200]  Rockefeller drops i don't think you know i don't think honestly anybody will
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:16.160]  and that's really unfortunate you know that they've lived a life like that but
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:19.280]  you know once again you know i try to view these things yeah their human journey
[02:39:19.280 --> 02:39:23.600]  is just a tragic event of power and avarice now i interrupted you with a
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:26.160]  break let's go back to that esquire piece
[02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:29.680]  that you were talking about recap it and then tell us about it
[02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:32.560]  okay the the assignment to get back to it there
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:36.640]  esquire was doing a piece on airport security and the idea of you know how
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:40.560]  difficult my assignment was dan research and illustrate how
[02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:42.960]  difficult it would be to take down an airliner
[02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:46.640]  and in initially i thought well that's kind of an irresponsible job it's
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:49.680]  it's kind of irresponsible to illustrate that but then i thought about it i
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:53.120]  thought well it's actually more irresponsible not to illustrate how
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:56.000]  easy it is because anybody that wants to take down an
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.720]  airliner is going to take down an airliner period you know they're going
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:00.640]  to do it they're going to do the research required
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:04.480]  and they're going to figure it out so i started looking into it and i spent
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:08.560]  several hours on the internet and i i you know i came up with a formula for an
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:13.600]  explosive that was non-detectable by the by the screening that's used now which
[02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:17.280]  is all carbon-based detection this is a chemical element it's
[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:21.360]  it's got 80 percent of the destructive power or the explosive force a tnt
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:24.960]  and it can be made at your house it can be carried
[02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:29.520]  so the method i came up with is this you know you get three guys working
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:32.000]  together and this is all based on the fact that these
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.640]  guys are going to off themselves but there doesn't seem to be a shortage of
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:37.920]  guys that are willing to and you're doing this drill to try to
[02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:41.280]  stop this from happening or to try to illustrate to people like hey look how
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:44.640]  easy this is you know look how easy it would be to do this you know and
[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:47.680]  it's almost like a wake-up call it's like oh my god you know like
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:51.280]  you know we think these guys are or you know the security is
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:54.640]  such a band-aid you know it's you know right after 9-11 what was it like you
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:57.360]  couldn't walk two feet away from your bag without getting like
[02:40:57.360 --> 02:41:01.360]  scolded right now it's like i'll leave my bag at the gate ask someone to watch it
[02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:04.080]  go to the bathroom come back it's like no one's worried there was a national
[02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:06.960]  guard in the airport when we go back to the point that most of its
[02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:10.400]  manufactured if you had time to see the underwear bombing i totally agree
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:13.680]  you know it's i mean the state department says they were ordered by a us
[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:16.080]  intelligence agency to help him get on the plane
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:19.760]  yeah okay so there you go so it's the same thing it's the whole idea of like
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:22.960]  you keep them in fear you know threat level orange threat level yellow threat
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:25.600]  level red i'll laugh when i hear that stuff when i'm at the
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:28.640]  airport because it reminds me of that gearing quote it's like you know keep
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:30.960]  them in fear keep them feeling like they're being repressed
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:35.040]  let me get back to the f-square thing so so i i i figure out the whole process
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:38.400]  to do this you know you get three guys you have two guys carrying the explosive
[02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:41.600]  device and they're groin once again usually
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:44.880]  and this might be changing but usually even with a pat down
[02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:48.000]  they don't go right to that area you know so you can get that in
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:53.360]  and and then you you take in a nine-volt battery some
[02:41:53.360 --> 02:41:57.440]  wire a couple flashlight bulbs a i used a timer
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:02.480]  was a timer off of a dog feeder right that i bought it you know academy or
[02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:05.120]  something and so i took all the ideas you take all
[02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:08.880]  this stuff in independently which is it'd be all be very easy to get in
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:12.000]  the only thing i thought would be difficult was maybe some duct tape so i
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.520]  thought well what you do is you'd line your entire bag with duct tape
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:18.160]  and then you could get it in and then you could pull the strips off and use it
[02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:21.520]  but then you go into the little kiosk you buy a couple bottles of coke
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:25.280]  and you all go to the men's room one guy goes into the handicap stall
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:29.040]  he spends about 15 minutes assembling the thing getting it all ready to go
[02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:32.720]  puts it on his bag takes it into the plane and then the research further was
[02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:35.680]  well okay so he blows it up in the plane it might compromise
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:38.160]  you know the hull it might do this it might do that but it probably wouldn't
[02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:42.000]  take it down so what you do then which is also another one of these ridiculous
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:45.840]  band-aids is that you know once 9-11 happened they reinforced all the
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:48.400]  cockpit doors you know they made these kevlar doors
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:51.680]  you can't get in but what they didn't do is they didn't reinforce the bulkhead
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:55.600]  behind the captain or the co-pilot all they did is do a door
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:43:00.320]  so 757 and a couple other aircrafts have a in the first class cabin they have a
[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:03.520]  a bathroom that immediately backs up against the
[02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:06.800]  cockpit so you go in there and you detonate it and it's done and you know
[02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:11.280]  this was you know six hours of research on my part and so the idea is that
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:15.440]  it's incredibly simple to do this how long ago did you do that for esquire
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:18.960]  it was like two years ago and i wish i had brought that image with me because
[02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:23.360]  what i did is i did a still life of all of the elements that were required
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:26.800]  what should we google uh dan winters esquire how to bomb a plane
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:31.440]  let's see do that it was esquire or best life i'm thinking after i said esquire
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:36.960]  i was thinking it might be best like do uh dan winters uh best life bomb
[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:40.320]  and i bet it'll dan winters best life bomb did you guys have any luck because
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:42.800]  you wanted to also show people how fake the photo is
[02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:45.920]  with the newspaper and the rifle of lee harvey oswald in the front yard
[02:43:45.920 --> 02:43:50.000]  where the shadows are all wrong okay well we'll show that first and but
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.240]  we're running out of time here and there's something i mean i knew it'd be great
[02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:55.200]  to have you on the radio because you've got so much knowledge and we're so
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:59.680]  similar in so many ways and our perspectives uh but i mean you were
[02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:02.000]  telling me stories and i don't know if some of them are off record or if you
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:05.360]  want to tell stories but what are some interesting stories about movie stars
[02:44:05.360 --> 02:44:08.960]  or politicians or rick perry or whatever that you can tell
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:12.560]  okay rick perry the hair politician the funniest story about rick perry i
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:16.560]  photographed him twice um you know he is the consummate
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:22.080]  the consummate smooth guy he comes in you almost instantly have a nickname he
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:25.120]  remembers your name it's this whole politician thing you know i've been
[02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:28.480]  other politicians you know of a good friend of mine jack valenti who just
[02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:32.960]  passed recently he told me if you don't like bush don't spend 10 minutes in a
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:36.000]  room with him because you'll love him because he's that kind of you know
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.880]  you instantly get a nickname you instantly feel like you know has that
[02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:42.800]  ability to make you feel special you know and you know i you know i was offered
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:45.840]  twice to photograph him newsweek offered me a cover
[02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:49.360]  uh the the uh day after the election the initial
[02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:52.400]  election when he was when he was uh first photo president
[02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:56.640]  and i turned it down because i just fundamentally like i fundamentally
[02:44:56.640 --> 02:45:00.720]  can't like photograph someone well you know he he looks more like a demon
[02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:06.320]  when he does the smiles or like an evil clown that when he does that laughing
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:10.560]  i mean it it it upsets me and uh you know he had me arrested one time for just
[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:12.720]  asking him a question i don't know if you've ever googled
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:15.840]  alex jones arrested for asking governor question at a press conference okay
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:18.400]  and i asked him about the world government they they just drug me out and
[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:21.680]  arrest me right well i had a funny i had a funny
[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:26.000]  run in with rick perry at bicycle sports shop i went in there to get something
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.880]  and he was in there and he was in his bike outfit and he had his assistants
[02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:31.600]  with the big file of faxes and a couple of the
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:36.080]  capital police with him and uh so i heard him i was in there and i was kind of
[02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:39.360]  listening and i heard him talking to his assistant he said like okay i'm going to
[02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:43.440]  go for a bike ride from 10 to 12 they don't want to meet bill for lunch
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:45.920]  then after that i'm going to do this and go for a run then i'm going to go
[02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:48.720]  sweat you know this and i'm listening to all this
[02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:51.920]  and uh as soon as he finished it i was standing right next to him and i said uh
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:56.000]  you planning on doing any governing today because it sounds like his day was
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:59.520]  full of recreation you know but uh yeah these guys you know most of these
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:03.120]  guys and i think the point you brought up about bush's laugh my experience with
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:07.680]  politicians is they don't really know what they're
[02:46:07.680 --> 02:46:11.360]  supposed to do and so they have this kind of fake smile that they throw on and
[02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:16.000]  it's you know i've photographed phil graham one time and i and i and i said uh
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:19.280]  i said he kept doing this really bizarre smile and i was trying to get a shot
[02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:22.320]  that felt natural like we were talking about earlier you were talking about
[02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:25.920]  the idea of how to kind of like capture the essence of someone you know and
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:29.280]  when they're not taking direction and they're they're they're doing what they
[02:46:29.280 --> 02:46:32.160]  think a photograph is supposed to be you know i think a lot of people think like
[02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:35.920]  oh great photos of a sunset or something you know it's like super passe but
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:39.440]  once again the sunset inspires all of us people look at a photo of the sunset
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:42.560]  and it takes them to that point whatever the most common sort of genre of
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:46.720]  photographs but phil graham said uh i said yeah um maybe just relax your
[02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:50.000]  mouth maybe just do something serious and he said boy i worked on this smile for
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:54.720]  a long time i'm gonna smile so and it was the more painfully
[02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:58.160]  forced like smile you could possibly imagine but uh i don't even know where
[02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:01.840]  we're at i like to photograph like out in the country old shot up washing
[02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:05.600]  machines in the way the bullets have gone through and the rust
[02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:09.360]  absolutely yeah that's the kind of stuff i like yeah not that i'm i mean i
[02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:13.760]  i just like photographs you know that are of an old barn or old woman or
[02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:16.880]  sure sure i love all of your photos great thanks
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:20.720]  but because it does so i was accurate when i said that you
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:24.160]  somehow draw out the essence of people i try to and you know i think to a
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:27.200]  certain extent it's like a i've called it before i said i've called it a
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:33.200]  manufactured intimacy and i think the idea behind you know the the the range
[02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:38.080]  of human expression and human emotion is is so wide that i think what i try to
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:41.760]  do is i try to capture sort of like usually except for the the case with
[02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:45.520]  your crazy uh screaming photograph is that um but that's a part of your
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:48.400]  personality and see that was an accurate representation i suppose right
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:51.840]  but uh the idea is to just try to go to a place
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:54.880]  that feels pensive that feels introspective that feels
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:47:58.320]  you know quiet oftentimes it doesn't feel like it's you know manufactured
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:01.920]  doesn't feel like it's in genuine you know it's it's capturing a moment of
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:04.160]  that individual but i think it's a reflective moment
[02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:07.680]  and i think people respond to reflective moments why did you choose this photo
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:11.200]  as the cover page when you open the magazine i didn't the magazine did and
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:15.040]  i would have hoped what i was hoping is that the screaming photo
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:20.000]  was by itself with the um my dream would have been the screaming photo was by
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:24.960]  itself and the typography on one side and then you turned to that photo and
[02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:29.440]  then the last photo was the one in the set you know i'd hope for that but i was
[02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:33.120]  really happy was so first show me in the screaming and then show the the calm
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:36.160]  yeah i like that yeah just kind of jump back and forth because once again
[02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:40.960]  and i really like this very flattering photo yeah it is you like that one
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:43.840]  it's your new headshot exactly well that's what i look like to myself and i'm
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:46.400]  looking in the mirror you know brushing my teeth and then i'm not really
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:50.880]  photogenic i mean i'm not i'm not very narcissistic but the
[02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:53.120]  same time you're looking at photos of yourself it's like that didn't really
[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:56.800]  look like me of course absolutely and but your photos because i've met some of
[02:48:56.800 --> 02:49:00.800]  these famous people in person the photos you take of people is what they
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:03.360]  really look like yeah yeah that's a challenge when you're
[02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:06.000]  shooting someone famous by the way because you've seen them
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:10.480]  represented in the media so many times it's like how do you make that quintessential
[02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:13.440]  image and still have it to be a recognizable image and what i try to
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:16.720]  do in my photographs and i think to a large extent i'm successful
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:21.600]  is to try to create a timeless iconic image so that is not to use like fancy
[02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:24.560]  tricky lighting stuff to keep it really simple
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:29.040]  there he is let's quit looking at me now back in fact we don't have much time
[02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:31.600]  run through some of the other photos at the end of that that we haven't seen of
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:34.720]  other people go ahead did we finally harvey oswald photo yet
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:37.280]  we're gonna show don't we come back sorry dan go ahead all right no problem
[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:41.120]  i'm in here directing while i'm on tv where we are you're dry here just
[02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:43.440]  continue the direction of the flow of the conversation
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:46.640]  no it's just you were saying uh you were talking about how to
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:49.680]  oh to create a genuine moment and still have it be
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:53.600]  uh uh an accurate representation of what that individual looks like
[02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:57.280]  because once again you know people that are really widely known in the news and
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:49:59.760]  stuff it's very difficult to create an image that
[02:49:59.760 --> 02:50:02.880]  stands out and that's going to connect to you because you've seen so many of them
[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:06.320]  so the idea of trying to create you know try to heighten it to the point where it
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:09.360]  becomes iconic i guess ultimately and you know
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:13.120]  through the history of photography there are those single images that represent
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:16.320]  to everyone you know if i said lincoln there are a couple photographs even
[02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:18.960]  though he was photographed you know he wasn't actually photographed that many
[02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:22.720]  times like 12 times i think but there are a couple you know there's that one at
[02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:25.600]  the end of the war shortly before he was killed where you just see
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:29.040]  how completely decimated he had become from the war it looks like a corpse
[02:50:29.040 --> 02:50:32.320]  already unbelievable yeah just there's the iwo jima marines
[02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:36.000]  how exhausted they look with the triumph absolutely there's the uh sailor
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:39.120]  kissing the beautiful woman in new york alfred eisenstadt and you could just
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:41.760]  capture that they're going to be having a great time together that night
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:46.480]  joe rosenthal with the flag raising shot and alfred eisenstadt with the uh

[02:50:58.720 --> 02:51:02.160]  dan winters
[02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:06.000]  so you think the mass of gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe
[02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:09.840]  think again benzine a toxic gas emitted from crude oil
[02:51:09.840 --> 02:51:14.000]  and a known carcinogen is now airborne traveling hundreds even thousands of
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.720]  miles inland whether you lived in the gulf or not
[02:51:16.720 --> 02:51:20.320]  benzine and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions

[02:54:14.560 --> 02:54:19.440]  well there's the famous setup photo a photo shot from back in 1963 before they
[02:54:19.440 --> 02:54:23.600]  had photo shot of lee harvey oswald as a photographer
[02:54:23.600 --> 02:54:26.960]  what is wrong with that photograph well you know there are a lot of things
[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:30.800]  wrong with it the most obvious thing for me is
[02:54:30.800 --> 02:54:37.360]  that the light is coming from his left from an angle and at a pretty low
[02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:40.400]  angle in the sky because you can see the shadow
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:43.520]  coming back from his body at about 10 o'clock
[02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:47.600]  so that would indicate a light source that's off his axis at about
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:51.680]  five o'clock and so that's inconsistent then
[02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:55.120]  with the lighting that's on his face the lighting that's on his face if you'll
[02:54:55.120 --> 02:54:58.400]  notice the shadow goes straight down from his nose
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:02.480]  12 o'clock 12 o'clock overhead his eyes
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:06.320]  both eye sockets are dark which indicates also an overhead light source
[02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:10.400]  so it's clearly a photograph that was staged the interesting thing about that
[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:13.600]  is the entire house was cleaned out the day of the
[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:17.760]  assassination by the dallas police department completely every single thing
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:21.600]  every dish every fork every knife every sheet everything
[02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:24.720]  and then two days later suddenly someone goes back to the house and supposedly
[02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:29.120]  finds the photo in the house and brings it in so it's clearly a fake photo and
[02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:32.160]  the thing about it is back then yeah they didn't have photoshop but what they
[02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:35.760]  could do is work at an incredibly large scale so they could have made a 20 by
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:38.880]  24 print of the the person standing in for the
[02:55:38.880 --> 02:55:42.240]  image made a big giant print of a head shot from oswald
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:45.760]  that they had combined them and then re-photographed it and the
[02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:49.760]  print that they found was three inches by three inches so very difficult all right
[02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:52.320]  we don't have much time i want to have you back some time no no i could have
[02:55:52.320 --> 02:55:55.600]  you for five hours uh shifting gears again i don't want to get
[02:55:55.600 --> 02:55:58.720]  i believe we do have a space program that went to the moon i've talked to top
[02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:02.800]  astronauts but they wanted to fake some photos for the public to not show the
[02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:06.880]  public what we really have what do you think of those moon photos well i think
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:09.760]  the most interesting thing about the moon photos is that there
[02:56:09.760 --> 02:56:12.320]  there are some problems with them there's some definite problems with them you know
[02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:17.280]  there i've i've actually photographed conrad grissom and
[02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:19.760]  harrison schmitt harrison schmitt was the last person
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:23.200]  that sat foot on the moon conrad obviously we've interviewed him yeah exactly
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:27.360]  schmitt's amazing geologist um you know and the thing about it is
[02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:30.720]  that the the lighting is really inconsistent those photographs based on
[02:56:30.720 --> 02:56:34.320]  you know the light source on the moon would be one singular source it would
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:38.560]  be the sun only so either you got light on you or you don't so the shadows are
[02:56:38.560 --> 02:56:41.600]  all pure black and the highlights are all pure white
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:43.520]  because they're illuminated so the problem with
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:48.800]  you know the the photograph of of aldrin coming down off the limb you know
[02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:51.840]  that entire uh it's it's backlit and so the
[02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:54.800]  limb should be black it shouldn't be illuminated but it's illuminated but
[02:56:54.800 --> 02:56:57.920]  instead there's angles everywhere of our yeah there's multiple shadows there's
[02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:00.400]  directional shadows there was a great uh there was a great
[02:57:00.400 --> 02:57:04.320]  photograph that nasa had that are a film image that they had released
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:08.160]  which they've since pulled you know i think it got in under the radar and some
[02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:10.240]  people got it and they questioned it and it got pulled
[02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:13.840]  of the flag on the moon blowing yes you know you've seen that okay
[02:57:13.840 --> 02:57:18.080]  so as a top photographer who knows the whole science of it this is suspicious
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:21.120]  it's suspicious and you know i've looked in that and watched the documentary a
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:24.400]  funny thing happened on the way to the moon which there's a lot more stuff on
[02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:27.760]  there that's really inconsistent it was almost part of the same interest i had
[02:57:27.760 --> 02:57:31.200]  with the uh with the 9-11 stuff with the pentagon you know something seemed
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:33.760]  weird and we have a right to question it you look
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:36.720]  unfortunately we're down to a minute and a half let's show the photo of his
[02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:40.080]  father here and and i described what i got from it
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:43.520]  you know that that it's you know it's almost like
[02:57:43.520 --> 02:57:47.120]  the sistine chapel where god's reaching down but also he's old he's wise he's
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:49.920]  strong but you said vulnerable yeah i think there's a lot of
[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:52.880]  vulnerability in that image you know especially in his eyes
[02:57:52.880 --> 02:57:56.320]  you know it looks like to me you know that was a perfect photograph that's my
[02:57:56.320 --> 02:57:59.360]  favorite that i've ever done there are some of my son actually that would
[02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:02.720]  that would uh that would compete with that one for favorite photo but
[02:58:02.720 --> 02:58:05.920]  you know he and i took a walk i usually always have a camera with me
[02:58:05.920 --> 02:58:09.760]  we were we took a walk out in his house in the high desert in california
[02:58:09.760 --> 02:58:13.040]  and the light was absolutely stunning there was a little breeze it was one of
[02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:16.240]  those things where it's like hey can i do a portrait of you real quick dad
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:20.160]  yeah you know shot 10 frames done finished the walk
[02:58:20.160 --> 02:58:23.920]  processed the film stunning you know you caught that magic
[02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:27.200]  moment perfect i mean the hair blowing for me it was really the magic moment

[03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:25.040]  under military control we're going to go over that
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:28.800]  we're going to get into stories out of new jersey his home state cops in new
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:33.040]  jersey town given keys to homes as part of your safety
[03:01:33.040 --> 03:01:36.320]  we have all these brinks commercials running where it shows a thug busting
[03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:40.160]  into a woman's house and she calls 911 how about she shoots them
[03:01:40.160 --> 03:01:43.840]  so we'll talk about the fight between freedom and liberty
[03:01:43.840 --> 03:01:47.280]  and the collectivist and the tyrants that are trying to take over
[03:01:47.280 --> 03:01:51.040]  our society and rush limbaugh is talking about obama might try to suspend
[03:01:51.040 --> 03:01:54.800]  elections i mean they're going to lose so the only way
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:01:57.840]  they could try to get away with this is to suspend elections
[03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:01.200]  they're trying to demonize the tea parties the patriots
[03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:04.320]  no doubt they're staging many of these brick through the window events
[03:02:04.320 --> 03:02:08.000]  democrats have been caught doing this before there is a lot of anger out there
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:12.480]  violence is not the answer judge napolitano great to have you here with us
[03:02:12.480 --> 03:02:18.320]  alex it's a pleasure what a fabulous intro man i'm riveted listening to you
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:21.680]  well we're riveted having you here okay i could bring up a lot of subjects but
[03:02:21.680 --> 03:02:25.280]  what's important to you right now what do you what's number one on your
[03:02:25.280 --> 03:02:28.320]  front burner the the laws of freedom at the hands of the
[03:02:28.320 --> 03:02:31.200]  government which happens with every tick of the clock
[03:02:31.200 --> 03:02:34.640]  i kiddingly say in the beginning of that book which you were very kind to
[03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:38.640]  to mention alex that uh when i told friends i was writing a book about
[03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:42.480]  the government and lies and that it was 4 000 pages long everybody laughed and
[03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:45.360]  said were you able to get all the lies in the 4 000 pages
[03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:49.040]  of course the publisher made the publisher made me stop at 300 pages but
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:53.760]  it shows you the the uh the perception that the
[03:02:53.760 --> 03:02:56.720]  public has is that the government does lie to us
[03:02:56.720 --> 03:03:00.640]  has been lying to us and we accept these lies and are willing
[03:03:00.640 --> 03:03:04.800]  to laugh about it even though every one of those lies i talk about in the book
[03:03:04.800 --> 03:03:07.680]  and even many that you just mentioned in the introduction
[03:03:07.680 --> 03:03:12.240]  destroys our liberty destroys our freedom by inducing us to make political
[03:03:12.240 --> 03:03:16.560]  decisions on erroneous information that the government claims is true
[03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:20.640]  and when we give up this liberty and lose this property
[03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:26.000]  we don't get it back absolutely when we come back i want to get into the
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:29.200]  health care bill i want to talk about what's next for these guys the
[03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:32.800]  blanket amnesty the national worker id for citizens
[03:03:32.800 --> 03:03:36.880]  that illegals are exempt from i've read the bill it's the same thing in this
[03:03:36.880 --> 03:03:40.880]  bill the health care bill it talks about how we have to have an electronic
[03:03:40.880 --> 03:03:46.720]  medical id card but it says illegals are again exempt from that
[03:03:46.720 --> 03:03:50.720]  no surprise that they would do something like that
[03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:56.240]  in order a to control us b to know where we are and what we're doing
[03:03:56.240 --> 03:03:59.600]  and see to create a permanent underclass
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:03.200]  fully dependent upon them the next thing you know is that they'll allow those
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:05.840]  folks to vote and you know which way they'll vote
[03:04:05.840 --> 03:04:08.720]  in favor of the party or the group or the candidate
[03:04:08.720 --> 03:04:12.560]  that gives them as big a piece of the pie to which we contribute at the point of

[03:08:14.640 --> 03:08:17.360]  new book lies the government told you mid power
[03:08:17.360 --> 03:08:22.640]  the deception in american history uh judge i get up here every day and rant
[03:08:22.640 --> 03:08:26.720]  and rave and and actually cover the laws the
[03:08:26.720 --> 03:08:30.880]  subsections the bills i give people chapter and verse and still some
[03:08:30.880 --> 03:08:33.680]  call in and say are you really telling the truth
[03:08:33.680 --> 03:08:40.320]  here's page 65 of the signed bill and it's in section bi eligibility for
[03:08:40.320 --> 03:08:44.880]  health plan and this is the actual section of the bill
[03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:50.080]  and it says may allow for the use of a machine readable identification card
[03:08:50.080 --> 03:08:54.080]  and they have another bill where they make citizens have a national ID card to
[03:08:54.080 --> 03:08:58.080]  have a job but the illegals are exempt uh and
[03:08:58.080 --> 03:09:02.400]  you have a what eight percent approval rating for read
[03:09:02.400 --> 03:09:06.400]  uh ten percent for Pelosi 11 percent for congress
[03:09:06.400 --> 03:09:10.880]  they know that 80 percent of the public is against this healthcare takeover
[03:09:10.880 --> 03:09:14.560]  we know the insurance companies wrote it it's actually a scam
[03:09:14.560 --> 03:09:19.600]  uh the establishment knows what they're doing is unconstitutional and lawless
[03:09:19.600 --> 03:09:22.080]  but they're going ahead with it and that's why
[03:09:22.080 --> 03:09:25.920]  rush limbaugh and i agree with him i'm glad he's really coming out now and
[03:09:25.920 --> 03:09:30.800]  telling it like it is right said that they may suspend elections because he
[03:09:30.800 --> 03:09:34.480]  says there's no way they they can win and that it appears they're
[03:09:34.480 --> 03:09:37.680]  putting in a police state control grid but as you know
[03:09:37.680 --> 03:09:41.040]  this was all set up in the last 20 30 years in this nation
[03:09:41.040 --> 03:09:45.440]  it's bipartisan judge depolitano what is the state of our union
[03:09:45.440 --> 03:09:48.400]  the state of our union is that it is a bipartisan
[03:09:48.400 --> 03:09:52.160]  movement toward a police state and we don't have two parties in this country
[03:09:52.160 --> 03:09:56.160]  alex even though most people think we do your listeners know that we have one
[03:09:56.160 --> 03:09:59.600]  party the big government party there's a republican wing
[03:09:59.600 --> 03:10:03.600]  that likes war and deficits and assaults our civil liberties there's a
[03:10:03.600 --> 03:10:07.920]  democratic wing that likes welfare and taxes and assaults our commercial
[03:10:07.920 --> 03:10:10.880]  liberties but they basically will feed each other
[03:10:10.880 --> 03:10:14.240]  because they're not interested in freedom they don't believe in fidelity
[03:10:14.240 --> 03:10:19.040]  to the constitution they're just interested in power i mean on my radio
[03:10:19.040 --> 03:10:22.640]  show last month i asked the number three ranking democrat in the house of
[03:10:22.640 --> 03:10:26.880]  representatives congressman jim climburn congressman where in the
[03:10:26.880 --> 03:10:30.160]  constitution is the government authorized to regulate
[03:10:30.160 --> 03:10:34.640]  health care and he said to me judge most of what we do down here referring to
[03:10:34.640 --> 03:10:37.680]  washington is not authorized by the constitution
[03:10:37.680 --> 03:10:40.960]  where in the constitution is it prohibited that we
[03:10:40.960 --> 03:10:44.560]  regulate health care the very fact that he would
[03:10:44.560 --> 03:10:51.360]  ask that question shows a a tremendous 180 degree misunderstanding of the
[03:10:51.360 --> 03:10:54.320]  federal government the congress is not a general
[03:10:54.320 --> 03:10:57.760]  legislature it doesn't exist in order to right
[03:10:57.760 --> 03:11:01.200]  every wrong it exists only to exercise power
[03:11:01.200 --> 03:11:07.680]  in 17 unique discrete specific well-defined set out areas in a piece
[03:11:07.680 --> 03:11:12.480]  of paper called the constitution to which he took an oath to uphold at least
[03:11:12.480 --> 03:11:15.200]  he was candid enough to acknowledge they're not upholding it
[03:11:15.200 --> 03:11:21.680]  but what is to become of us alex if the government decides the extent of its
[03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:26.640]  own powers if the government freely admits it violates its oath
[03:11:26.640 --> 03:11:30.800]  to uphold the constitution and if whenever financial
[03:11:30.800 --> 03:11:35.760]  or civil liberties are involved both sides of the government republican and
[03:11:35.760 --> 03:11:39.280]  democrat agree the president signs a new patriot act
[03:11:39.280 --> 03:11:42.480]  and he signs it in in the counter cover of darkness
[03:11:42.480 --> 03:11:46.160]  because he's afraid those to whom he promised he wouldn't do so might see a
[03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:49.920]  picture of him of him doing it the president when he was a senator
[03:11:49.920 --> 03:11:53.120]  blasted george w bush for conducting an illegal war
[03:11:53.120 --> 03:11:56.720]  he's killed as many people as bush ever did and is sending
[03:11:56.720 --> 03:12:02.080]  drones to to pakistan in more so in one year than bush didn't eat
[03:12:02.080 --> 03:12:06.400]  there there is very little change that comes about
[03:12:06.400 --> 03:12:11.520]  the elections in this country unless and until people well there is very little
[03:12:11.520 --> 03:12:16.240]  change judge and uh once they start violating the bill of
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:20.000]  rights and constitution the sky is the limit as you know as a constitutional
[03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:23.280]  law scholar and as a judge but the general public is just now
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:27.120]  beginning to discover this what about last week when they were still trying
[03:12:27.120 --> 03:12:31.200]  to just deem and pass this whole thing uh without even
[03:12:31.200 --> 03:12:35.120]  uh having the house vote on it i mean at least we forced them
[03:12:35.120 --> 03:12:38.720]  to back off of that but that gives us a window
[03:12:38.720 --> 03:12:43.840]  into their lawless mindset exactly it shows us that they would
[03:12:43.840 --> 03:12:47.440]  had caused to become law not only that which
[03:12:47.440 --> 03:12:51.200]  they haven't read and we know they haven't read it because they made promises
[03:12:51.200 --> 03:12:54.800]  that their their scriveners found out last night aren't in there
[03:12:54.800 --> 03:12:58.800]  but that they haven't even voted on at least we shamed them into voting on it
[03:12:58.800 --> 03:13:04.400]  at least we know that bart stupak is no more pro life than barack obama at
[03:13:04.400 --> 03:13:08.000]  least we know where people truly stand on all of this
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:12.160]  because the the uproar from people all across the political spectrum
[03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:15.600]  forced them to vote how odd and quaint alex
[03:13:15.600 --> 03:13:19.040]  that our representatives should actually vote on something
[03:13:19.040 --> 03:13:23.760]  and that we should be able to know how they voted you know when the
[03:13:23.760 --> 03:13:27.280]  extension of the patriot act was enacted in the senate
[03:13:27.280 --> 03:13:31.680]  it was done by a voice vote so that no senator was recorded
[03:13:31.680 --> 03:13:35.680]  as to how he or she voted on it and when they changed the the definition of the
[03:13:35.680 --> 03:13:39.760]  word financial institution to mean a doctor's office a lawyer's office the
[03:13:39.760 --> 03:13:42.560]  post office a computer server anything under the
[03:13:42.560 --> 03:13:46.080]  work under the sun which would let them serve a self-written search warrant on
[03:13:46.080 --> 03:13:49.600]  it that vote was taken by voice vote so there's no record
[03:13:49.600 --> 03:13:53.120]  of how anybody voted on it at least this time we have a record
[03:13:53.120 --> 03:13:56.800]  so we want to vote the bums out we know who the bums are
[03:13:56.800 --> 03:14:02.800]  and on top of that we have bills in the last decade introduced
[03:14:02.800 --> 03:14:07.200]  to make them read the bills act and they fight that
[03:14:07.200 --> 03:14:11.040]  to the nail that ron paul introduces every year
[03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:17.360]  two simple four-line bills every member of congress shall certify under oath
[03:14:17.360 --> 03:14:21.200]  that he or she has read a bill before voting for against it
[03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:24.560]  and every bill this is the second one that is introduced
[03:14:24.560 --> 03:14:27.600]  must cite in the constitution the authority for the bill
[03:14:27.600 --> 03:14:32.960]  neither of those proposals as simple basic and rational as could be
[03:14:32.960 --> 03:14:36.880]  a junior in high school social studies could understand them
[03:14:36.880 --> 03:14:40.480]  neither of those has seen the light of day neither of them ever makes it
[03:14:40.480 --> 03:14:44.000]  to a committee for hearing but there may be some hope
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:48.080]  because you could have said the same thing about his proposal to audit the fed
[03:14:48.080 --> 03:14:51.680]  10 years ago now it has passed the house of representatives
[03:14:51.680 --> 03:14:55.200]  what will happen in the senate i don't know but his persistence
[03:14:55.200 --> 03:14:58.400]  has caused the american public to be aware of these things
[03:14:58.400 --> 03:15:02.640]  and cause the public to pressure power hungry members of congress
[03:15:02.640 --> 03:15:08.000]  occasionally to do the right thing judge andrew napolitano
[03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:12.560]  as a constitutional expert as a former judge
[03:15:12.560 --> 03:15:16.960]  reading over the bill and over the subsections there's so many things that
[03:15:16.960 --> 03:15:21.440]  are unconstitutional and then there's also deception
[03:15:21.440 --> 03:15:26.560]  even the ap admits this doesn't protect people with self
[03:15:26.560 --> 03:15:30.800]  with with already existing conditions with children
[03:15:30.800 --> 03:15:35.680]  that is the one that mrs palosi and company are stumbling over this morning
[03:15:35.680 --> 03:15:39.920]  alex because they promised uh democrats and the
[03:15:39.920 --> 03:15:44.160]  democrats promised their constituents that children with
[03:15:44.160 --> 03:15:48.960]  pre-existing conditions would be covered immediately now put aside the fact
[03:15:48.960 --> 03:15:52.800]  that the federal government has no authority whatsoever
[03:15:52.800 --> 03:15:56.560]  take it to the bank no authority whatsoever
[03:15:56.560 --> 03:16:00.000]  to regulate health care and to tell insurance carriers
[03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:04.480]  who they may insure but even if you're for socialism this is another ripoff
[03:16:04.480 --> 03:16:07.280]  just like communism under the soviets was a ripoff
[03:16:07.280 --> 03:16:11.280]  or socialism in england's a ripoff anytime they get a big pool of money
[03:16:11.280 --> 03:16:14.560]  they're gonna steal most of it they're not gonna give it of course because
[03:16:14.560 --> 03:16:18.000]  sooner or later you run out of other people's money but in this particular
[03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:23.280]  case they lied to their own people the socialist monstrosity that they passed
[03:16:23.280 --> 03:16:26.400]  didn't even have in it the clauses that they used
[03:16:26.400 --> 03:16:30.080]  to sell it on the american people one of which is this
[03:16:30.080 --> 03:16:33.920]  your children will be taken care of from the minute the president signs it
[03:16:33.920 --> 03:16:37.760]  baloney they didn't even read what they wrote they didn't even write
[03:16:37.760 --> 03:16:41.760]  what they wrote they just took passages and put it together by the way did you
[03:16:41.760 --> 03:16:45.440]  hear who praised the president's signing of this
[03:16:45.440 --> 03:16:48.640]  legislation just about 15 minutes before i was
[03:16:48.640 --> 03:16:53.600]  happy to come on your air let me guess fidel Castro fidel Castro
[03:16:53.600 --> 03:16:59.520]  praised obama care that's an endorsement if ever there was one
[03:16:59.520 --> 03:17:03.200]  well the state is god under the new world order
[03:17:03.200 --> 03:17:08.400]  system let's get into the unconstitutionality of this and how
[03:17:08.400 --> 03:17:11.840]  you would attack it i don't think attorney general suing
[03:17:11.840 --> 03:17:15.600]  or joining their suit is enough we need to have states nullify
[03:17:15.600 --> 03:17:18.960]  under the ninth and tenth amendment and to not just roll
[03:17:18.960 --> 03:17:22.320]  this back but you're not going to take our highway funds you're not going to
[03:17:22.320 --> 03:17:25.520]  take our education funds i mean i think this is a wake-up call
[03:17:25.520 --> 03:17:30.800]  for people to really start reversing the fact that for a hundred plus years
[03:17:30.800 --> 03:17:34.880]  the federal government has been expanding its authority into areas that
[03:17:34.880 --> 03:17:38.400]  are completely illegal well you know it's one thing alex
[03:17:38.400 --> 03:17:42.160]  for a state legislature and a governor to sign a piece of paper saying we
[03:17:42.160 --> 03:17:45.600]  stand on our tenth amendment and we are a sovereign state
[03:17:45.600 --> 03:17:49.600]  it would be quite another for a state legislature to enact legislation that
[03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:53.120]  did the following prohibits state employees from
[03:17:53.120 --> 03:17:58.000]  enforcing federal law indict federal officials
[03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:02.000]  who come into the state with the intention of enforcing federal law
[03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:07.040]  that conflicts with state law impose a real estate tax on federal property
[03:18:07.040 --> 03:18:09.760]  within the state now i know that that has been unlawful
[03:18:09.760 --> 03:18:13.280]  for the past 200 years but suffice it to say we have a different supreme court
[03:18:13.280 --> 03:18:16.400]  now that might look at this at this uh differently
[03:18:16.400 --> 03:18:20.000]  dragged before county and state grand juries
[03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:23.520]  federal officers who insist on enforcing federal law
[03:18:23.520 --> 03:18:28.320]  that is unconstitutional within the states the states really have to stand
[03:18:28.320 --> 03:18:31.440]  up for their sovereignty they have to do more than say
[03:18:31.440 --> 03:18:34.320]  we are a sovereign state that has to be teeth
[03:18:34.320 --> 03:18:39.040]  to their proclamation of sovereignty now i would like to see
[03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:43.280]  the popular election of senators done away with i would like to see
[03:18:43.280 --> 03:18:47.120]  state legislatures send members of the senate
[03:18:47.120 --> 03:18:51.120]  to the senate because then they wouldn't be stealing power from the states
[03:18:51.120 --> 03:18:53.840]  or those senators would soon be out of their jobs
[03:18:53.840 --> 03:18:57.760]  the federal government didn't begin to grow to gargantuan proportions
[03:18:57.760 --> 03:19:01.680]  until the progressive era with the popular election of senators who were
[03:19:01.680 --> 03:19:05.600]  able to pander to the collectivist impulses of the masses
[03:19:05.600 --> 03:19:08.400]  and deliver as big a piece of pie as they could
[03:19:08.400 --> 03:19:11.840]  and create the permanent underclass that relied on them
[03:19:11.840 --> 03:19:17.760]  for support and returned it with votes very well said and let's come back and
[03:19:17.760 --> 03:19:22.480]  talk about constitutional ways to apply what you just
[03:19:22.480 --> 03:19:25.200]  discussed because if we do get the grand juries
[03:19:25.200 --> 03:19:29.280]  to start investigations and call for indictments uh if we do get the states
[03:19:29.280 --> 03:19:33.200]  to pass laws saying our employees will not comply with this
[03:19:33.200 --> 03:19:36.400]  that's all completely constitutional and other ideas
[03:19:36.400 --> 03:19:40.400]  other solutions because there's a lot of people listening right now
[03:19:40.400 --> 03:19:43.520]  folks are paying attention to these issues right now
[03:19:43.520 --> 03:19:48.640]  folks are angry now is the time to take what judge napolitano is saying and i
[03:19:48.640 --> 03:19:53.760]  totally agree with him and to put it into force now is the time the
[03:19:53.760 --> 03:19:56.880]  democrats have said they think you're going to forget about this and they
[03:19:56.880 --> 03:19:59.920]  could slowly implement it and that's how they're going to domesticate us
[03:19:59.920 --> 03:20:03.120]  we say no
[03:20:03.120 --> 03:20:06.560]  are you wondering about your retirement portfolio are you confident that the

[03:24:07.440 --> 03:24:14.480]  empires nations republics corruption grows slowly like an infection and then
[03:24:14.480 --> 03:24:19.200]  it blooms and the nation falls and the elites that have
[03:24:19.200 --> 03:24:22.560]  become wealthy and powerful will use a police state
[03:24:22.560 --> 03:24:27.040]  to try to maintain control of the population that they've robbed
[03:24:27.040 --> 03:24:30.960]  and we've seen a premeditated development of this police state
[03:24:30.960 --> 03:24:34.960]  in their internal documents to suppress the american people it's the same thing
[03:24:34.960 --> 03:24:37.680]  worldwide and now you have these elites going
[03:24:37.680 --> 03:24:42.320]  offshore forming a global government openly saying a bank of the world
[03:24:42.320 --> 03:24:45.200]  that you will pay all your carbon taxes too we're going to talk about that in the
[03:24:45.200 --> 03:24:48.960]  next segment with judge andrew depolitano author
[03:24:48.960 --> 03:24:51.680]  best-selling author of multiple books his new book is out we'll tell you about
[03:24:51.680 --> 03:24:54.160]  the book and get into it before he leaves us
[03:24:54.160 --> 03:24:58.160]  but getting back into solutions on this obama care judge right
[03:24:58.160 --> 03:25:03.120]  am i right in saying that this is pretty much the make it or break it issue if
[03:25:03.120 --> 03:25:06.640]  we give into this and if we can't defeat this
[03:25:06.640 --> 03:25:09.840]  then uh the sky's the limit for these tyrants
[03:25:09.840 --> 03:25:14.560]  it is and uh vice president biden admitted as much yesterday when he said
[03:25:14.560 --> 03:25:17.680]  if we hadn't passed this we would have been toothless and now that we've passed
[03:25:17.680 --> 03:25:21.760]  this uh we have a lot else that we need to do first of all
[03:25:21.760 --> 03:25:25.680]  we know that the next eight months is going to be a rush to legislation because
[03:25:25.680 --> 03:25:28.720]  they know they're not stupid they know that they will never have the
[03:25:28.720 --> 03:25:31.520]  majorities in the congress after november if there is a
[03:25:31.520 --> 03:25:34.480]  november election that they have now so they're going to try and
[03:25:34.480 --> 03:25:38.880]  regulate as much as they can in the next eight months but but think about
[03:25:38.880 --> 03:25:43.520]  how insidious this is the supreme court has ruled countless times
[03:25:43.520 --> 03:25:47.040]  that the the most private conversation you have
[03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:51.040]  the one most utterly immune from governmental intrusion
[03:25:51.040 --> 03:25:55.360]  is with your physician more so than with your spouse it's with your physician
[03:25:55.360 --> 03:25:58.880]  this legislation purports with the stroke of a pen
[03:25:58.880 --> 03:26:02.800]  to do away with generations of that protection
[03:26:02.800 --> 03:26:07.520]  by putting a federal bureaucrat between you and your physician
[03:26:07.520 --> 03:26:11.040]  and permitting the bureaucrat to dictate to the physician
[03:26:11.040 --> 03:26:15.360]  what services are available to you and how much money is available
[03:26:15.360 --> 03:26:19.680]  for those services and it says they can share it with any federal agency they
[03:26:19.680 --> 03:26:22.240]  want and it says that those decisions by the
[03:26:22.240 --> 03:26:25.440]  bureaucrat are not appealable everything under the sun that the
[03:26:25.440 --> 03:26:29.120]  government does except the supreme court because that's the last appeal
[03:26:29.120 --> 03:26:31.760]  is appealable but this legislation says it's not
[03:26:31.760 --> 03:26:34.640]  appealable so they violate your right to privacy
[03:26:34.640 --> 03:26:38.480]  they violate your right to talk to your physician without the government there
[03:26:38.480 --> 03:26:41.920]  they violate your right to the privacy of your medical records
[03:26:41.920 --> 03:26:45.520]  they decide how much money is available to pay your physician
[03:26:45.520 --> 03:26:49.360]  for the services that you may need is this the government
[03:26:49.360 --> 03:26:54.720]  that the framers gave us or is this as you say alex so nicely
[03:26:54.720 --> 03:26:58.560]  the breaking point is this the point beyond which
[03:26:58.560 --> 03:27:03.760]  they cannot go now that leads us to the constitutional challenges to me
[03:27:03.760 --> 03:27:08.400]  the violation of privacy and the order that all Americans
[03:27:08.400 --> 03:27:12.560]  shall purchase something whether they want it need it can afford it
[03:27:12.560 --> 03:27:16.800]  already have it or not purchase something that the government approves of
[03:27:16.800 --> 03:27:21.280]  are the two most obvious unconstitutional aspects of this
[03:27:21.280 --> 03:27:25.040]  there are many others it's against the constitution for the congress
[03:27:25.040 --> 03:27:28.720]  to tell a state legislature how it must legislate
[03:27:28.720 --> 03:27:32.160]  and how it must spend that's called commandeering
[03:27:32.160 --> 03:27:35.840]  the legislature that's been prohibited for many years but the congress does it
[03:27:35.840 --> 03:27:39.360]  and gets away with it anyway but hold on hold on that's another key
[03:27:39.360 --> 03:27:42.960]  point you just rattled off is that and we've heard the state
[03:27:42.960 --> 03:27:45.840]  legislatures and governors and attorney generals talk about this and it's in the
[03:27:45.840 --> 03:27:49.360]  bill that in some cases doubles the amount of
[03:27:49.360 --> 03:27:52.080]  money that states must levy to give to medicare and
[03:27:52.080 --> 03:27:56.000]  medicaid yes it does yes it does now normally when the congress
[03:27:56.000 --> 03:28:00.080]  wants to control a state legislature it bribes it so for example
[03:28:00.080 --> 03:28:03.360]  did you ever wonder why speed limits are the same all around the country
[03:28:03.360 --> 03:28:07.520]  did you ever wonder why the blood alcohol content in a person's veins
[03:28:07.520 --> 03:28:10.880]  sufficient to charge them for drunk driving is the same in every state
[03:28:10.880 --> 03:28:14.880]  did all 50 states just magically adopt the same standards no
[03:28:14.880 --> 03:28:19.040]  the congress adopted the standards was told by its lawyers these standards
[03:28:19.040 --> 03:28:22.160]  wouldn't fly because the constitution doesn't authorize the congress to do
[03:28:22.160 --> 03:28:25.440]  this so the congress went to the states and said here's
[03:28:25.440 --> 03:28:29.680]  hundreds of millions of dollars to repave your highways but if you accept
[03:28:29.680 --> 03:28:34.400]  this money you have to legislate about speed limits and blood alcohol content
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:38.160]  as we want that's a bribe if you or i alex or anybody
[03:28:38.160 --> 03:28:41.760]  listening to us now went to a state legislature and said here's cash
[03:28:41.760 --> 03:28:45.520]  now right below the way i want it we would be arrested and rightly so
[03:28:45.520 --> 03:28:50.560]  for attempted bribery in this case with this health care legislation
[03:28:50.560 --> 03:28:54.560]  there is no bribe there is an outright command
[03:28:54.560 --> 03:28:58.720]  from the congress to the state legislatures you shall
[03:28:58.720 --> 03:29:02.960]  license more physicians you shall spend more money
[03:29:02.960 --> 03:29:07.200]  when the congress does that that's called commandeering
[03:29:07.200 --> 03:29:11.920]  a state legislature and the supreme court in the past 15 years
[03:29:11.920 --> 03:29:15.680]  has twice prohibited the congress from doing that so that's another
[03:29:15.680 --> 03:29:19.280]  unconstitutional aspect of this it invades
[03:29:19.280 --> 03:29:23.840]  an area of state sovereignty the regulation of the medical profession
[03:29:23.840 --> 03:29:29.840]  reserved to the states so we're right back to the declaration of independence
[03:29:29.840 --> 03:29:33.920]  where they talk about unelected governors coming in and overriding the
[03:29:33.920 --> 03:29:39.280]  legislatures commanding them taxation without representation
[03:29:39.280 --> 03:29:43.360]  the democrats know this is all illegal and i guess that's why limbaugh and
[03:29:43.360 --> 03:29:46.240]  others are openly saying they may try martial law
[03:29:46.240 --> 03:29:49.520]  now they want to take over the internet with cyber security we'll talk about it
[03:29:49.520 --> 03:29:53.280]  all straight ahead stay with us we're on the march
[03:29:53.280 --> 03:30:01.680]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[03:33:06.400 --> 03:33:14.160]  scores of new taxes 16,500 plus IRS agents
[03:33:14.160 --> 03:33:18.160]  they decide what type of medical care you're allowed to have under insurance
[03:33:18.160 --> 03:33:22.160]  they then tax your medical savings accounts
[03:33:22.160 --> 03:33:26.080]  it forces the working poor to go out and get insurance it lowers
[03:33:26.080 --> 03:33:30.320]  the quality of the standards judge Andrew Napolitano
[03:33:30.320 --> 03:33:35.200]  is our guest judge you're right when you make the point this is the mad rush
[03:33:35.200 --> 03:33:38.000]  and now that they've already done something this unpopular
[03:33:38.000 --> 03:33:42.480]  and committed political suicide right Harry saying hey we got to go ahead and
[03:33:42.480 --> 03:33:45.360]  pass the carbon tax we got to go ahead and pass
[03:33:45.360 --> 03:33:49.520]  blanket total amnesty we've got to go ahead
[03:33:49.520 --> 03:33:54.160]  and pass cybersecurity which even the Associated Press says allows Obama to
[03:33:54.160 --> 03:33:57.760]  completely shut the web off if he so chooses
[03:33:57.760 --> 03:34:01.760]  they want to pass the new enemy belligerence
[03:34:01.760 --> 03:34:05.680]  act that says for any intelligence value or such other matters
[03:34:05.680 --> 03:34:09.440]  as the president considers you may be secretly arrested
[03:34:09.440 --> 03:34:14.800]  and interrogated and held i mean they are and Lindsey Graham is arguing for
[03:34:14.800 --> 03:34:17.840]  similar legislation do you know how how hideous that piece of
[03:34:17.840 --> 03:34:22.080]  legislation it is it actually says the only way you can get out of
[03:34:22.080 --> 03:34:27.120]  military confinement and even appear before a judge Alex
[03:34:27.120 --> 03:34:31.840]  is if the house and senate intelligence committees vote to let you out
[03:34:31.840 --> 03:34:36.240]  what a perversion of our system of justice that instead of having
[03:34:36.240 --> 03:34:41.360]  judges say to the government thou shalt not violate the right of any person
[03:34:41.360 --> 03:34:45.200]  because the Constitution protects persons not just good persons and not just
[03:34:45.200 --> 03:34:48.080]  Americans but all persons they would have themselves
[03:34:48.080 --> 03:34:51.760]  politicians assume the judicial role and decide
[03:34:51.760 --> 03:34:56.160]  who can get away from the waterboarding and into a federal prison
[03:34:56.160 --> 03:35:00.640]  instead this is an orgy this is an orgy of power grabbing
[03:35:00.640 --> 03:35:04.160]  yes it is by the executive and yes it is the
[03:35:04.160 --> 03:35:08.080]  a legislative and again i hear all these neocons on radio and tv saying
[03:35:08.080 --> 03:35:11.920]  oh we don't want to let al qaeda go but the point is we know
[03:35:11.920 --> 03:35:15.520]  that all of this is written and we have the homeland security internal documents
[03:35:15.520 --> 03:35:19.600]  this whole thing is designed and pointed at returning veterans
[03:35:19.600 --> 03:35:24.640]  gun owners conservatives libertarians this is for the american people you know
[03:35:24.640 --> 03:35:27.920]  when janet the head of the department of homeland
[03:35:27.920 --> 03:35:32.080]  security janet what's her name announced that the most dangerous
[03:35:32.080 --> 03:35:34.640]  people on the planet where the groups you just
[03:35:34.640 --> 03:35:39.200]  indicated right to lifers people believe in the second amendment
[03:35:39.200 --> 03:35:43.920]  uh returning veterans from the wars people who think taxes are too high and
[03:35:43.920 --> 03:35:48.080]  the government is too onerous i got in an argument on air with one of my
[03:35:48.080 --> 03:35:51.680]  fox colleagues who said to me well she knows that
[03:35:51.680 --> 03:35:55.040]  you are in favor of second amendment rights and she knows your pro life and
[03:35:55.040 --> 03:35:58.000]  she knows you're against the irs but how does she know
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:02.240]  who that everybody else feels that way i said because she can capture
[03:36:02.240 --> 03:36:06.240]  her agents can capture every keystroke on your computer
[03:36:06.240 --> 03:36:10.000]  how can she do that he says because she has the power
[03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:14.400]  under the patriot act which you i won't tell you which fox colleague this was
[03:36:14.400 --> 03:36:17.600]  but you can probably guess which you supported
[03:36:17.600 --> 03:36:20.720]  when your guy george w bush was in the white house
[03:36:20.720 --> 03:36:24.160]  now it's in the hands of those who would use this power against you
[03:36:24.160 --> 03:36:27.760]  what are you crazy don't you realize liberty once given up
[03:36:27.760 --> 03:36:33.760]  and put in the hands of the government as power never comes back
[03:36:33.760 --> 03:36:38.000]  when will they learn when will they learn alex the patriot act wasn't enough
[03:36:38.000 --> 03:36:41.920]  for them to learn from now it's being used on them the neocons themselves
[03:36:41.920 --> 03:36:45.760]  this monstrosity from mccain and lindsay graham where they can lock up any
[03:36:45.760 --> 03:36:49.360]  american they want and waterboard the person until the legislature says to
[03:36:49.360 --> 03:36:56.000]  stop this is not america this is not america
[03:36:56.000 --> 03:36:59.680]  let's talk about the heart and soul of the republican party
[03:36:59.680 --> 03:37:04.560]  the the leadership predominantly are as you said just the other wing of the
[03:37:04.560 --> 03:37:07.120]  big government party they're the twins right
[03:37:07.120 --> 03:37:13.360]  and everywhere if george w bush had proposed obama care
[03:37:13.360 --> 03:37:16.880]  the republicans that are screaming the loudest now would be supporting it
[03:37:16.880 --> 03:37:20.480]  that's what i think of their fidelity to the constitution
[03:37:20.480 --> 03:37:23.600]  to the primacy of the individual and to the free market
[03:37:23.600 --> 03:37:29.440]  to them it's just a game of r versus d it has nothing to do with the natural
[03:37:29.440 --> 03:37:32.640]  law or human liberty i'm sorry for interrupting you i wanted to get that
[03:37:32.640 --> 03:37:35.360]  in because no no it's me no i totally agree
[03:37:35.360 --> 03:37:38.960]  republicans claim to be pure here they're no more pure than the other side
[03:37:38.960 --> 03:37:42.560]  they just happen to be in the minority so it's convenient and comfortable
[03:37:42.560 --> 03:37:47.680]  for them to oppose this monstrosity well i agree with you let me
[03:37:47.680 --> 03:37:52.400]  then pose the question this way for you we've seen top republican strategists
[03:37:52.400 --> 03:37:56.240]  come out against ran paul and say they've got to defeat them they're now
[03:37:56.240 --> 03:38:00.320]  allowing the head election official who's running against ran paul and the
[03:38:00.320 --> 03:38:04.320]  republican party to
[03:38:04.320 --> 03:38:08.880]  not recuse himself but run the election that he himself
[03:38:08.880 --> 03:38:12.720]  is running in correct the associated press up so i want to get your take on
[03:38:12.720 --> 03:38:14.960]  that we have all these other republican strategists
[03:38:14.960 --> 03:38:18.000]  demonizing the tea parties demonizing the birthers
[03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:21.920]  we know his name's berry sataro we know he gave up a citizenship became an
[03:38:21.920 --> 03:38:24.800]  indonesian regardless of what happened in kenya and where
[03:38:24.800 --> 03:38:28.960]  they're smoked there's fire we know that the main line blue blood
[03:38:28.960 --> 03:38:32.800]  leadership is attempting to demonize
[03:38:32.800 --> 03:38:36.640]  and shut down debate and stop the american people
[03:38:36.640 --> 03:38:39.600]  from using the republican party to take our country back
[03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:43.840]  what what are your expert recommendations because those were
[03:38:43.840 --> 03:38:47.520]  i mean absolutely spot on earlier on what the state should do with obama
[03:38:47.520 --> 03:38:51.840]  care what is your recommendation for the american people
[03:38:51.840 --> 03:38:54.960]  to not just let the republicans play the part of opposition
[03:38:54.960 --> 03:38:58.640]  and then get in power and and basically go along with all this
[03:38:58.640 --> 03:39:02.480]  i think the american people should vote out of office and and aggressively
[03:39:02.480 --> 03:39:06.000]  hound out of office lawfully obviously not only
[03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:09.680]  everyone who voted for obama care but everyone who voted for tarp
[03:39:09.680 --> 03:39:13.280]  proposed by george w bush everyone who voted for the first two
[03:39:13.280 --> 03:39:16.400]  stimuluses that we've had in the past four years
[03:39:16.400 --> 03:39:20.320]  which came from george w bush everyone who voted for the patriot act which came
[03:39:20.320 --> 03:39:23.680]  from george w bush everyone who voted for any tax increase now
[03:39:23.680 --> 03:39:28.640]  that would be about 93 to 94 percent of the congress these
[03:39:28.640 --> 03:39:33.120]  people's voting records must be revealed the collusion
[03:39:33.120 --> 03:39:37.280]  of ran pull being forced to run against the guy who was in charge of counting
[03:39:37.280 --> 03:39:40.640]  the ballots even joe stowman wouldn't have been
[03:39:40.640 --> 03:39:43.760]  so bold as to do that he would have put a crony in
[03:39:43.760 --> 03:39:47.280]  to count the ballots but in kentucky the republicans are
[03:39:47.280 --> 03:39:51.120]  forcing ran pull to run against the guy who will decide who wins the
[03:39:51.120 --> 03:39:54.640]  the election the american public cannot put up with that they need to find
[03:39:54.640 --> 03:39:58.560]  to file lawsuits they need to listen to you they need to listen to what i
[03:39:58.560 --> 03:40:02.400]  attempt to do at fox they need to educate themselves they need to know
[03:40:02.400 --> 03:40:05.360]  what their rights are and they cannot take this take this
[03:40:05.360 --> 03:40:09.120]  sitting down now alex you know i have been privileged to be the keynote
[03:40:09.120 --> 03:40:13.200]  speaker at many of these tea parties these folks are not going away
[03:40:13.200 --> 03:40:15.920]  they are not going to be co-opted by the republicans
[03:40:15.920 --> 03:40:19.280]  they are as much a threat to the republican leadership thank god
[03:40:19.280 --> 03:40:22.560]  as they are to the democratic leadership because they understand
[03:40:22.560 --> 03:40:26.240]  that the constitution was written to keep the government
[03:40:26.240 --> 03:40:31.120]  off the people's backs not to find sneaky ways for the government to do it
[03:40:31.120 --> 03:40:36.720]  and get away with it let's expand into ran pull ron paul's son i mean in many
[03:40:36.720 --> 03:40:40.400]  polls he's 10 points ahead right he's a shoe into win
[03:40:40.400 --> 03:40:43.520]  and this illustrates in the republican leadership admits this
[03:40:43.520 --> 03:40:48.640]  this isn't just an anti-democrat incumbency this is an anti-incumbent
[03:40:48.640 --> 03:40:54.240]  period and the guy he's running against is getting all this aig banker money
[03:40:54.240 --> 03:40:58.320]  he's a globalist and then meanwhile he's going to run the election
[03:40:58.320 --> 03:41:03.520]  and i talked to uh uh a ran paul's uh people two days ago and they talked
[03:41:03.520 --> 03:41:07.600]  about they went to the commission and they said unanimously no
[03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:12.240]  he can run uh your election but then we looked at past rulings in other states
[03:41:12.240 --> 03:41:15.040]  they've always said someone has to recuse themselves
[03:41:15.040 --> 03:41:18.080]  if they're the state's head election official
[03:41:18.080 --> 03:41:23.840]  uh and and are running uh i mean again it just shows how
[03:41:23.840 --> 03:41:26.880]  every form of common sense and checks and balances
[03:41:26.880 --> 03:41:30.720]  are being removed and when you have a real constitutionalist running for an
[03:41:30.720 --> 03:41:34.240]  office income the republican party to try to destroy them
[03:41:34.240 --> 03:41:39.280]  they they fear someone like ran paul just as much as they fear his father
[03:41:39.280 --> 03:41:42.400]  ran paul because of their utter fidelity to the
[03:41:42.400 --> 03:41:46.800]  constitution and to the natural law and to the belief that the individual
[03:41:46.800 --> 03:41:49.440]  is greater than the greater than the government
[03:41:49.440 --> 03:41:53.360]  even in my home state of new jersey notorious
[03:41:53.360 --> 03:41:57.920]  for corruptions and political prosecutions it is against the law
[03:41:57.920 --> 03:42:02.480]  for the collector of the ballots to be on the ballot when he's collecting them
[03:42:02.480 --> 03:42:06.480]  it's almost inconceivable that this could be happening in kentucky right
[03:42:06.480 --> 03:42:11.120]  underneath our noses and the courts won't uh won't interfere with it
[03:42:11.120 --> 03:42:14.800]  listen i'm i i think that ran paul will win the primary
[03:42:14.800 --> 03:42:19.200]  and will win the election and will be an unbelievable asset in the united
[03:42:19.200 --> 03:42:22.800]  state senate in spite of this i can't advise him as to whether or not he
[03:42:22.800 --> 03:42:26.160]  should file a lawsuit candidly i don't think he needs to do so
[03:42:26.160 --> 03:42:29.520]  but but there's a general principle of law that if
[03:42:29.520 --> 03:42:33.920]  the government's behavior appears to be in a conflict
[03:42:33.920 --> 03:42:37.520]  then the person that is creating the appearance of a conflict
[03:42:37.520 --> 03:42:40.560]  should step back this guy can run against ran paul
[03:42:40.560 --> 03:42:44.640]  or this guy can count the votes in the election that ran paul is running in but
[03:42:44.640 --> 03:42:47.600]  nobody in their right mind would say that he could do both
[03:42:47.600 --> 03:42:51.760]  at the same time and be absolutely honest that's too much of a temptation
[03:42:51.760 --> 03:42:55.360]  for a human being to have to endure and for the electorate to have to
[03:42:55.360 --> 03:42:59.360]  abide by well i mean you've got all the election officials under him
[03:42:59.360 --> 03:43:02.640]  that are being promised jobs in the u.s senate absolutely they're all political
[03:43:02.640 --> 03:43:06.720]  appointees alex so he can take them to well he's not going to go to the senate
[03:43:06.720 --> 03:43:10.480]  but he can promise to take them to the senate with him so will they
[03:43:10.480 --> 03:43:14.240]  look the other way when a when a group of absentee ballots
[03:43:14.240 --> 03:43:18.560]  suddenly disappears into the river or suddenly shows up in somebody's trunk
[03:43:18.560 --> 03:43:24.320]  this will force dr paul ran paul to hire more poll watchers to hire more people
[03:43:24.320 --> 03:43:27.920]  to watch the government because the government cannot be trusted
[03:43:27.920 --> 03:43:31.760]  to run an honest election because the guy running the election
[03:43:31.760 --> 03:43:36.240]  is running against ran paul this is just absurd
[03:43:36.240 --> 03:43:40.800]  well i mean if this precedent gets set this new corrupt precedent
[03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:43.440]  pretty soon the only people that can get elected anywhere
[03:43:43.440 --> 03:43:47.440]  will be the head of election suddenly that'll be the only person that can run
[03:43:47.440 --> 03:43:50.800]  and win and then they'll become kings and their
[03:43:50.800 --> 03:43:54.480]  kids will be the only ones that can win sort of like alexander hamilton when
[03:43:54.480 --> 03:43:57.360]  he wanted george washington to be a king you know what i think will happen
[03:43:57.360 --> 03:44:00.640]  ran paul wins by such a large number that all of their
[03:44:00.640 --> 03:44:04.800]  sneaking and trickery will not be enough to affect the outcome
[03:44:04.800 --> 03:44:08.160]  and this collector of ballots who also wants to be on the senate
[03:44:08.160 --> 03:44:12.320]  will be relegated to the dustbin of history where he belongs
[03:44:12.320 --> 03:44:15.520]  well we're already running out of time it's always amazing having and we got
[03:44:15.520 --> 03:44:19.200]  15 minutes left here i want to get into the book lies the
[03:44:19.200 --> 03:44:24.160]  government told you but first specifically the democrats and
[03:44:24.160 --> 03:44:27.760]  and lynsey graham the republicans they all know
[03:44:27.760 --> 03:44:31.120]  that carbon dioxide isn't bad they all know that china
[03:44:31.120 --> 03:44:35.520]  isn't going to make the cuts they all know that this will industrial
[03:44:35.520 --> 03:44:39.680]  uh be industrial suicide and we have all these big environmentalists
[03:44:39.680 --> 03:44:43.600]  saying they want to destroy our economy why does government
[03:44:43.600 --> 03:44:48.720]  want to destroy the economy government wants to control us
[03:44:48.720 --> 03:44:52.720]  because of what's saying augustin called libido dominandi look we all know about
[03:44:52.720 --> 03:44:56.560]  certain types of libido this is a lust for power
[03:44:56.560 --> 03:45:01.600]  before the civil war we sent people to our state houses and to congress
[03:45:01.600 --> 03:45:06.160]  who were interested in liberty who were concerned with confining the government
[03:45:06.160 --> 03:45:10.080]  with assuring that it did not a fear would interfere with our natural rights
[03:45:10.080 --> 03:45:12.560]  with our civil liberties and with our property rights
[03:45:12.560 --> 03:45:16.400]  since the civil war we have sent people to the government by and large there
[03:45:16.400 --> 03:45:19.200]  are exceptions both before the civil war and afterwards
[03:45:19.200 --> 03:45:22.560]  but by and large people who are not interested in liberty but people who are
[03:45:22.560 --> 03:45:25.680]  interested in power power for its own sake
[03:45:25.680 --> 03:45:29.360]  power in and of itself power to control other people
[03:45:29.360 --> 03:45:34.160]  government attracts those who lust for power ron poll
[03:45:34.160 --> 03:45:37.920]  and rand poll and ron polls colleagues in the house
[03:45:37.920 --> 03:45:40.800]  and if there are any in the senate i'm unaware of them
[03:45:40.800 --> 03:45:45.280]  are the exception to the rule but for the most part this is the type of human
[03:45:45.280 --> 03:45:50.400]  being that the government attracts and this type of illicit
[03:45:50.400 --> 03:45:54.240]  aggregation of power gets worse and worse and worse because
[03:45:54.240 --> 03:45:57.040]  when they get power they hand it off to the successors
[03:45:57.040 --> 03:46:00.960]  just like mike churtoff handed it off to janet napolitano and i know what
[03:46:00.960 --> 03:46:04.560]  you're thinking the answer is no we are not related
[03:46:04.560 --> 03:46:10.400]  this happens generation after generation after generation that's why i am not
[03:46:10.400 --> 03:46:14.240]  optimistic about our future because it will take a generation
[03:46:14.240 --> 03:46:20.880]  of doctors paul to change this to stop it to reverse it well that's what g ever
[03:46:20.880 --> 03:46:23.840]  griffin and others have said though we have to have the long view of history
[03:46:23.840 --> 03:46:25.920]  we're not going to beat these people overnight
[03:46:25.920 --> 03:46:29.120]  we've got to do everything we can and start resisting now
[03:46:29.120 --> 03:46:33.200]  just to slow it down and then stop it and then start
[03:46:33.200 --> 03:46:37.760]  reversing it but the good news is this is really open people's eyes up the
[03:46:37.760 --> 03:46:42.160]  carbon taxes the open borders uh the takeover of the health care bill
[03:46:42.160 --> 03:46:46.400]  the fact that it is just pure robbery not even you know benevolent socialism
[03:46:46.400 --> 03:46:50.240]  which which is an oxymoron uh do you agree
[03:46:50.240 --> 03:46:54.400]  though that the battle lines are now drawn and that the awakening is
[03:46:54.400 --> 03:46:57.520]  exploding i do and i believe that the the great
[03:46:57.520 --> 03:47:01.920]  mass of independent voters are on the side of liberty in this
[03:47:01.920 --> 03:47:06.080]  i believe that the average man and woman who accepted the government for what it
[03:47:06.080 --> 03:47:10.000]  was now fear it and now need to understand
[03:47:10.000 --> 03:47:13.360]  that they can change it when i told a crowd in florida the other night
[03:47:13.360 --> 03:47:17.280]  that that we have the power to abolish the irs the place went
[03:47:17.280 --> 03:47:21.200]  wild with enthusiasm and a couple people said to me
[03:47:21.200 --> 03:47:24.880]  i didn't know that i thought it was in the constitution i thought we had to have
[03:47:24.880 --> 03:47:28.720]  income taxes we have the power if we work hard enough
[03:47:28.720 --> 03:47:32.560]  and educate ourselves to throw the yoke of tyranny
[03:47:32.560 --> 03:47:36.720]  off of us okay judge judge i'm going to give you the floor
[03:47:36.720 --> 03:47:41.280]  for the last 12 minutes and we're going to skip this network bright coming up
[03:47:41.280 --> 03:47:44.640]  i'm going to sit back and i want you to give us a speech a rant
[03:47:44.640 --> 03:47:48.400]  cover the book any issues you want to cover and i'll say bye to you because
[03:47:48.400 --> 03:47:51.440]  i always get so intrigued and i want to back up what you're saying i'm always
[03:47:51.440 --> 03:47:53.600]  adding things i want at the end of the interview
[03:47:53.600 --> 03:47:58.000]  shut up but before we do that i want to encourage viewers to support this radio
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:48:01.200]  show and to support our films we have two new films coming out
[03:48:01.200 --> 03:48:05.600]  in the middle of april order them at info wars dot com invisible empire
[03:48:05.600 --> 03:48:09.600]  a new world order defined and police state for the rise
[03:48:09.600 --> 03:48:13.680]  of female you'll also see them premiere at prison planet dot tv and super high
[03:48:13.680 --> 03:48:17.120]  quality but go by the dvds make copies give them
[03:48:17.120 --> 03:48:19.840]  everyone you know because one of the most effective things
[03:48:19.840 --> 03:48:23.360]  that we have ever done is these films
[03:48:23.360 --> 03:48:26.960]  and this unlocks people's minds it shows them the predatory nature
[03:48:26.960 --> 03:48:30.160]  of this global elite please go to info wars dot com
[03:48:30.160 --> 03:48:33.680]  purchase the books the videos the materials because they're key tools to
[03:48:33.680 --> 03:48:37.120]  wake your friends and family up and it supports this broadcast now
[03:48:37.120 --> 03:48:40.560]  the the only caveat of provides though i'm gonna sit back and shut up judge
[03:48:40.560 --> 03:48:44.560]  is before you get into the book and taxes and the nature of slavery and bondage
[03:48:44.560 --> 03:48:48.560]  and we what we're truly going under global government is openly being
[03:48:48.560 --> 03:48:51.360]  announced why do you think they're finally admitting
[03:48:51.360 --> 03:48:54.640]  that okay it's a world government it's going to be run by banks
[03:48:54.640 --> 03:48:59.040]  and what is the nature of this world government from your research and then
[03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:03.040]  tie that in to the overarching system of why they
[03:49:03.040 --> 03:49:06.240]  want a global government so no one can run and flee
[03:49:06.240 --> 03:49:09.920]  and set up societies that are free because then that competes
[03:49:09.920 --> 03:49:14.320]  with the collectivist and outshines them in every case so speak to that
[03:49:14.320 --> 03:49:17.360]  and then you've got the floor in the last 11 minutes on any issue you want to
[03:49:17.360 --> 03:49:20.160]  cover oh you are so kind and so generous to me
[03:49:20.160 --> 03:49:24.000]  alex and i'm deeply grateful uh to be here look i'm just a simple night
[03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:28.000]  watchman that's employed by fox my job is to watch the government in the
[03:49:28.000 --> 03:49:31.120]  nighttime when it doesn't think that people are watching it and it doesn't
[03:49:31.120 --> 03:49:34.640]  want people to look at it to see what it is doing to steal
[03:49:34.640 --> 03:49:37.760]  our freedom and to steal our property the one world
[03:49:37.760 --> 03:49:40.560]  government has been around since the progressive era
[03:49:40.560 --> 03:49:44.800]  and you're right alex these people are enormously patient
[03:49:44.800 --> 03:49:47.520]  obviously the people who came up with this concept
[03:49:47.520 --> 03:49:51.440]  are no longer with us but their successors are they aren't wealthier
[03:49:51.440 --> 03:49:55.200]  they are more sophisticated and they are just as committed as their
[03:49:55.200 --> 03:49:59.600]  predecessors where they simply want control they want power
[03:49:59.600 --> 03:50:05.440]  for the the the joy of exercising power in and of itself power corrupts
[03:50:05.440 --> 03:50:09.920]  absolute power corrupts absolutely they don't want to have to answer to voters
[03:50:09.920 --> 03:50:14.000]  they don't want to have to answer to a constitution that limits their behavior
[03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:17.440]  they want to be able to take whatever property they can whether they call it
[03:50:17.440 --> 03:50:20.880]  eminent domain whatever they want to call the process by which
[03:50:20.880 --> 03:50:25.200]  they take it they want to protect us cradle to grave
[03:50:25.200 --> 03:50:29.040]  so that we are totally dependent upon them for everything
[03:50:29.040 --> 03:50:32.240]  so they can decide who will be in their group and who won't
[03:50:32.240 --> 03:50:38.160]  if you read George Orwell's 1984 he was just off by a couple of years
[03:50:38.160 --> 03:50:42.240]  but almost everything that was in there was predicted
[03:50:42.240 --> 03:50:49.600]  and we see it now the use of law to assault liberty and to steal property
[03:50:49.600 --> 03:50:54.480]  do you remember alex studying basic american history the king of england
[03:50:54.480 --> 03:50:59.840]  had ingenious ways to tax us the last straw was the stamp
[03:50:59.840 --> 03:51:03.200]  fact it required that every colonist have on every
[03:51:03.200 --> 03:51:06.640]  piece of paper in his or her home a stamp every book
[03:51:06.640 --> 03:51:10.880]  every bank draft every mortgage every lease every deed every pamphlet
[03:51:10.880 --> 03:51:13.520]  even a poster that was going to be nailed to a tree
[03:51:13.520 --> 03:51:17.040]  had to have the king stamp on it imagine having to go
[03:51:17.040 --> 03:51:20.000]  yet we have enough difficulties with the postal office as it is you had to go to
[03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:24.240]  a foreign postal office in the colonies and buy the king stamp question
[03:51:24.240 --> 03:51:28.480]  how did the government know if you had the king stamp on every piece of paper
[03:51:28.480 --> 03:51:32.720]  in your house answer the parliament enacted the towns and acts
[03:51:32.720 --> 03:51:36.160]  which permitted british soldiers to write their own search warrants
[03:51:36.160 --> 03:51:39.920]  and thus they would show up at your home and hand you a piece of paper
[03:51:39.920 --> 03:51:43.520]  on which they had purported to authorize themselves to enter your home
[03:51:43.520 --> 03:51:47.600]  ostensibly to look for the stamps of course they would confiscate alcohol
[03:51:47.600 --> 03:51:50.800]  they would confiscate furniture which you couldn't demonstrate you had paid
[03:51:50.800 --> 03:51:53.520]  taxes on they would even sometimes kick you out of
[03:51:53.520 --> 03:51:57.200]  the house and take it over for days or weeks or months
[03:51:57.200 --> 03:52:00.400]  we fought a revolution we won the revolution
[03:52:00.400 --> 03:52:05.440]  we wrote a constitution we added the fourth amendment to that constitution
[03:52:05.440 --> 03:52:10.160]  which next to the right to life is the greatest right there is the right to be
[03:52:10.160 --> 03:52:13.520]  left alone and it says the government can't come on to
[03:52:13.520 --> 03:52:17.520]  your property and can't seize what you have and can't intrude into your
[03:52:17.520 --> 03:52:21.520]  privacy unless it goes to a judge and demonstrates to a neutral judge that
[03:52:21.520 --> 03:52:24.960]  it is more likely than not that you are committing crime
[03:52:24.960 --> 03:52:29.120]  fast forward 200 years to the patriot act what does the patriot act do
[03:52:29.120 --> 03:52:33.600]  it allows federal agents to write their own
[03:52:33.600 --> 03:52:36.960]  search warrants we have elected a government
[03:52:36.960 --> 03:52:43.440]  that has done the very same thing to us which was the last straw when we
[03:52:43.440 --> 03:52:47.840]  broke away from an island 3 000 miles away
[03:52:47.840 --> 03:52:52.640]  that was regulating us as if we were chattel and as if we were slaves to them
[03:52:52.640 --> 03:52:56.240]  when jefferson wrote in the in the declaration of independence
[03:52:56.240 --> 03:52:59.520]  the words that every school child knows alex by heart
[03:52:59.520 --> 03:53:02.720]  all men are created equal and endowed by their creator
[03:53:02.720 --> 03:53:07.520]  with certain inalienable rights and that among these is life liberty and the
[03:53:07.520 --> 03:53:12.160]  pursuit of happiness he wedded the american soul
[03:53:12.160 --> 03:53:16.720]  to the idea of the natural law that our rights come from nature from our
[03:53:16.720 --> 03:53:21.120]  humanity that we are created in the image and likeness of god and as he is
[03:53:21.120 --> 03:53:25.600]  perfectly free he has given us the gift of perfect freedom
[03:53:25.600 --> 03:53:31.600]  in philadelphia in 1787 when they argued all summer about how the government
[03:53:31.600 --> 03:53:34.240]  should look and what the constitution should be
[03:53:34.240 --> 03:53:37.760]  they began with an argument about what is the source of our rights
[03:53:37.760 --> 03:53:41.600]  and alexander hamilton the big government guy of the day
[03:53:41.600 --> 03:53:45.360]  the guy who said debt was good even in 1787
[03:53:45.360 --> 03:53:48.720]  argued that without the government there can be no rights
[03:53:48.720 --> 03:53:51.840]  and the same government that gives rights can take them away
[03:53:51.840 --> 03:53:55.760]  madison repute refuted him toe to toe point to point
[03:53:55.760 --> 03:53:59.760]  and said our rights come from our humanity madison won
[03:53:59.760 --> 03:54:04.000]  read the first amendment it doesn't say congress shall grant
[03:54:04.000 --> 03:54:07.840]  freedom of speech it says congress shall make no law
[03:54:07.840 --> 03:54:12.560]  abridging the freedom of speech why do i emphasize the word the
[03:54:12.560 --> 03:54:16.240]  because the framers recognized that freedom of speech
[03:54:16.240 --> 03:54:19.920]  pre-existed the government pre-existed the country
[03:54:19.920 --> 03:54:24.160]  came by virtue of our birth and the purpose of the first amendment
[03:54:24.160 --> 03:54:27.680]  was to assure that congress and ultimately the president and
[03:54:27.680 --> 03:54:32.320]  eventually the courts and one day the states could not interfere
[03:54:32.320 --> 03:54:36.240]  with the basic freedoms the right to think as you wish
[03:54:36.240 --> 03:54:39.920]  the right to say what you think the right to publish what you say the right
[03:54:39.920 --> 03:54:44.560]  to worship or not to worship the right to come and go as you see fit
[03:54:44.560 --> 03:54:47.760]  the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances
[03:54:47.760 --> 03:54:51.280]  the right to defend yourself alex by any
[03:54:51.280 --> 03:54:54.960]  technologically advanced means that are available
[03:54:54.960 --> 03:54:58.720]  at any given time which includes the right to shoot
[03:54:58.720 --> 03:55:02.160]  at the government when it is taken over by tyrants
[03:55:02.160 --> 03:55:05.920]  and then of course the right to be left alone in the fourth amendment all of
[03:55:05.920 --> 03:55:10.160]  these rights are natural to us and every person in the
[03:55:10.160 --> 03:55:13.600]  government takes an oath to uphold the constitution
[03:55:13.600 --> 03:55:18.080]  meaning upholding the inviolability of these rights
[03:55:18.080 --> 03:55:22.160]  but in my years on the bench and i write about this uh in the book
[03:55:22.160 --> 03:55:25.120]  every time the government was in front of me alex
[03:55:25.120 --> 03:55:29.200]  it wasn't to enforce the constitution it wasn't to protect
[03:55:29.200 --> 03:55:32.480]  someone's rights it was to find some sneaky or
[03:55:32.480 --> 03:55:36.960]  ingenious way to get around the constitution
[03:55:36.960 --> 03:55:43.280]  but claim that they were enforcing it now my new book and i'm i'm very happy
[03:55:43.280 --> 03:55:48.160]  to tell you that as of a few minutes ago it's number 13 on the new york times
[03:55:48.160 --> 03:55:52.000]  bestseller bestseller list that doesn't mean the times approves of the book
[03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:56.720]  hardly it means that the most public counter of book sales
[03:55:56.720 --> 03:56:00.080]  is ranking me number 13 which is very good because then it gets published in
[03:56:00.080 --> 03:56:03.440]  that list and a lot of folks that don't watch fox or
[03:56:03.440 --> 03:56:08.640]  listen to alex jones or don't know me uh will be exposed to the book the book
[03:56:08.640 --> 03:56:12.960]  posits the following why do we expect that the government
[03:56:12.960 --> 03:56:16.320]  will lie why do we know that the government lies
[03:56:16.320 --> 03:56:20.560]  and do nothing about it would linden johnson have beaten barry goldwater in
[03:56:20.560 --> 03:56:23.360]  64 if we knew that he was secretly planning
[03:56:23.360 --> 03:56:26.960]  to invade north vietnam as he accused goldwater of doing
[03:56:26.960 --> 03:56:31.360]  would fdr have been elected in 44 re-elected in 44 if the public had
[03:56:31.360 --> 03:56:35.520]  known that he caused pearl harbor because he needed an excuse
[03:56:35.520 --> 03:56:40.720]  to enter world war two would george w bush have been re-elected in 2004
[03:56:40.720 --> 03:56:44.160]  if people knew that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq and
[03:56:44.160 --> 03:56:45.920]  that he knew it and ought to have known it
[03:56:45.920 --> 03:56:49.200]  that he was torturing people and lying about it that he was listening to
[03:56:49.200 --> 03:56:51.920]  people's phone calls and capturing their computer strokes
[03:56:51.920 --> 03:56:57.120]  all in violation of federal law that's what the book challenges americans
[03:56:57.120 --> 03:57:01.120]  alex to be aware of to recognize to reject
[03:57:01.120 --> 03:57:05.920]  and to correct my dear friend i've enjoyed all my time with you
[03:57:05.920 --> 03:57:11.120]  and in closing why do we put up with the line why have we gotten to a point
[03:57:11.120 --> 03:57:15.760]  where it's just accepted they lie but then that 20 percent that supports the
[03:57:15.760 --> 03:57:19.440]  government health bills still believe they're getting something free
[03:57:19.440 --> 03:57:24.160]  and the system is going for broke because they passed the point of no
[03:57:24.160 --> 03:57:26.960]  return they have committed so many crimes they're so
[03:57:26.960 --> 03:57:30.640]  lawless they've stolen so much they know the country's going bankrupt
[03:57:30.640 --> 03:57:34.640]  bloomberg reports the feds are openly getting ready to take pension funds
[03:57:34.640 --> 03:57:37.680]  to fund their operations and to fund the banks
[03:57:37.680 --> 03:57:41.120]  they have decided to go all the way just like hitler
[03:57:41.120 --> 03:57:44.640]  or stalin or mal and it's time for the public to wake up
[03:57:44.640 --> 03:57:48.960]  i mean you mentioned the stamp act here is new jersey cbs television
