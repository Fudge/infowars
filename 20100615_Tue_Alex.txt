[00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:06.449]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.449 --> 00:00:08.211]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:09.973]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.973 --> 00:00:11.575]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:13.117]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:17.301]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:21.366]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.353]  It's Tuesday, June 15th, 2010.
[00:00:28.353 --> 00:00:30.535]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:35.881]  My name's Paul Joseph Watson, editor and writer for PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:38.744]  I'll be sitting in for the first hour while Alex is away.
[00:00:39.324 --> 00:00:44.106]  And, um, afterwards we'll have another rebroadcast of the best interviews of the past week or so.
[00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:50.949]  Um, as was yesterday, I want to get your calls, um, lined up fairly quickly.
[00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.151]  Uh, we'll go to them at the bottom of the hour, so, um, the studio number is 888201.
[00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:20.685]  2244 that's 888 201 2244 and we're gonna get into the latest on the oil spill and how it's being used as we've documented previously to push this nightmare green economy that we've seen decimate countries like Spain already and how Obama is using it to
[00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:26.928]  Move towards the nationalization of the oil industry and government takeover of business.
[00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:41.796]  Now we're also going to get into this, quote, new story on this trillion dollars worth of mineral deposits that are being discovered in Afghanistan and debunk it for the pro-war PR stunt that it is.
[00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:44.698]  But first I want to get into this video.
[00:01:44.698 --> 00:01:45.958]  Everybody's talking about it.
[00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:55.400]  This confrontation between this Democratic Congressman, Bob Etheridge, and these two college kids, and you've probably already seen the video.
[00:01:56.242 --> 00:02:03.125]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com for those of you who haven't, but you can barely avoid it over the past 24 hours.
[00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:17.372]  And basically it shows this Democratic Congressman Etheridge walking down the street after a Pelosi speech, and he's confronted by these two college kids who merely ask him if he supports the Obama agenda.
[00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:22.455]  And now what's interesting after that is that Etheridge goes completely nuts
[00:02:23.115 --> 00:02:34.328]  Grabs the kid's arm, starts throwing punches at the camera, and then grabs him round the neck in a kind of mini half-Nelson, while these kids are trying to say, what are you doing?
[00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:34.989]  What's going on?
[00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.132]  We're only asking a question.
[00:02:38.132 --> 00:02:40.515]  Now, in the 24 hours since this came out,
[00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:53.200]  We learned the fact that the government immediately got hold of it and start issuing talking points on how the corporate media should debunk this story.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.845]  And just like the castrated little sheep that they are, people like Chris Matthews, MSNBC,
[00:03:00.505 --> 00:03:29.092]  And those that work at the Washington Post and the rest of the establishment neolib blogosphere immediately clicked their heels and started following these orders in trying to dismiss this video confrontation with the congressman as some kind of partisan stunt and even going to the lens of not only absolving Etheridge of blame but trying to tell us basically that down is up and that it was Etheridge
[00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:37.458]  Not the college kids who asked him a question and were assaulted, but it was Etheridge that was attacked and assaulted by the college kids who merely asked him a question.
[00:03:38.607 --> 00:03:41.328]  Um, I mean, let's get one thing clear.
[00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:54.590]  To the corporate media who followed their orders, um, dutifully, like the castrated sheep they are, um, you're not gonna make this go away by trying to take the focus away from Etheridge's bizarre control freak behaviour.
[00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:06.732]  Um, this guy's supposed to be a public servant, so you're not gonna be able to demonise people who ask questions of public servants by claiming it's all a Republican stunt.
[00:04:06.852 --> 00:04:07.193]  I don't
[00:04:19.065 --> 00:04:23.490]  I don't even care if these kids were Republican Party operatives, that's not the issue.
[00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:37.147]  The issue is that Etheridge, this establishment neolib, is acting like a nutcase on a power trip and his behaviour is emblematic of how our representatives see us as basically turds on a
[00:04:37.547 --> 00:04:42.072]  Sidewalk that they could treat like crap when in reality they're public servants.
[00:04:42.072 --> 00:04:46.356]  We'll play the video We'll get into how the media is spinning this after the break.
[00:04:46.356 --> 00:04:47.557]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:47.557 --> 00:04:48.738]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:49.259]  Stay tuned!
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.301]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:10.702]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:05:10.702 --> 00:05:18.084]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:22.965]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:42.657]  As powder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:05:42.657 --> 00:05:46.541]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[00:07:30.376 --> 00:07:31.617]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:36.181]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:07:36.181 --> 00:07:41.985]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:07:41.985 --> 00:07:45.628]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:07:45.628 --> 00:07:48.350]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:08:06.862 --> 00:08:08.642]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.642 --> 00:08:10.383]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.383 --> 00:08:11.984]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.984 --> 00:08:13.524]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.524 --> 00:08:17.726]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.726 --> 00:08:21.788]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.882 --> 00:08:29.505]  It's Paul Joseph Watson sitting in for Alex Jones on this Tuesday edition.
[00:08:29.505 --> 00:08:31.886]  Alex will be back tomorrow.
[00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:49.078]  Now we're talking about this confrontation between the college kids and this congressman Bob Etheridge which is causing debate across the political spectrum and basically what we've learned in the 24 hours since this emerged as a news story from Andrew Breitbart's
[00:08:49.358 --> 00:09:08.681]  Big government website is the fact that the White House, a Democratic Party official, put out these talking points where he was basically ordering the media to try and spin this confrontation in which Etheridge physically assaults these people who asked him if he was supporting the Obama agenda.
[00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:18.123]  They put out these talking points mandating the corporate media to spin this as a contrived partisan setup in an attempt to discredit it.
[00:09:18.763 --> 00:09:33.809]  Now, I'm afraid it's just not going to work, because you're never going to take attention and focus away from what the story is, the heart of it, which is Etheridge's bizarre, insane reaction, his ego power-tripped to merely being asked a question.
[00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:49.541]  You're just not going to spin it by saying it's a Republican setup, because as you've seen and heard as listeners of the Alex Jones Show over the past several years, neocons have been confronted in exactly the same way.
[00:09:49.541 --> 00:09:57.687]  Remember David Fromm, this is the guy that wrote Bush's Axis of Evil speech, this is the guy who was confronted by We Are Change members.
[00:09:58.047 --> 00:10:01.549]  Back in 2008 when they asked him about 9-11.
[00:10:01.549 --> 00:10:10.013]  And if you watch the clip, which is on the website, Fromm behaved almost exactly the same way as Etheridge did in this new video clip.
[00:10:10.013 --> 00:10:16.115]  You know, he's swatting away the camera, he's assaulting the people asking the questions, he's pushing them away.
[00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:18.657]  So I don't care who's being confronted.
[00:10:19.697 --> 00:10:28.699]  Whether it's a Democrat or Republican, and I don't care who's asking the questions, the key issue is the reaction of the individual being confronted.
[00:10:28.699 --> 00:10:36.381]  And you have to ask why the establishment's in such a blind panic over this story.
[00:10:36.381 --> 00:10:45.443]  And it's because they're petrified that a couple of college kids with a flip camera can change the course of a state election.
[00:10:45.443 --> 00:10:45.683]  I mean,
[00:10:46.483 --> 00:10:54.248]  You're not going to turn reality on its head by claiming that Etheridge was being attacked and assaulted by these kids, which is now what they're trying to do.
[00:10:54.248 --> 00:11:03.674]  Etheridge, in the 24 hours since this emerged as a news story, has been forced to issue an apology for his behaviour in the incident.
[00:11:03.674 --> 00:11:15.241]  And yet Democrats and the LibTard neo-Lib establishment are still trying to spin it as a contrived partisan stunt, when Etheridge has already apologised for it.
[00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:34.235]  Politico reported last night that this Democratic Party official was sending out a set of talking points and it said, quote, push hard with blogs the lack of credibility inherent to anything Breitbart does or posts given its role in the debunked Acorn videos.
[00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:43.923]  So this is a memo from the government going out to the corporate media and the neolib blogs telling them how to respond to this incident.
[00:11:45.103 --> 00:12:09.924]  Um, and you'd think it would be an uphill struggle because, you know, Etheridge has already apologised, he's already accepted blame for it, and yet they're still trying to, uh, make out as if the kids asking him the question were the ones, um, engaging in ambush journalism and even one blog suggests that he was, that these kids asking the question were in fact attacking Etheridge and he was defending himself.
[00:12:09.924 --> 00:12:11.165]  I mean, you've seen the clip.
[00:12:11.866 --> 00:12:14.468]  He's got the kid by, you know, by the neck!
[00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:19.091]  He's almost strangling him in a kind of half-Nelson for a second.
[00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:25.516]  And, uh, it's just amazing how quickly the mainstream media followed orders.
[00:12:25.516 --> 00:12:34.043]  Um, and we had this coordinated spin, uh, which centered mainly, as you would expect, around Chris Matthews and other hosts on MSNBC.
[00:12:34.043 --> 00:12:39.367]  Um, we've got the Chris Matthews clip linked up in the article today on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:40.067 --> 00:12:47.773]  In which, again, he tries to undermine the people who asked the question by claiming that the congressman was ambushed.
[00:12:47.773 --> 00:12:54.737]  And he doesn't even mention the fact that he was physically grappling and assaulting with this young student who asked the question.
[00:12:55.738 --> 00:13:08.082]  And we're going to exemplify this now by playing an MSNBC clip in which they cite so-called Democrats as blasting the people allegedly behind this video.
[00:13:08.082 --> 00:13:09.383]  So they're trying to create this...
[00:13:11.047 --> 00:13:18.231]  notion that the people to blame for this confrontation are the kids who are asking him the question.
[00:13:18.231 --> 00:13:21.392]  So listen to this spin from MSNBC.
[00:13:21.392 --> 00:13:22.893]  This is a two-minute clip.
[00:13:22.893 --> 00:13:28.136]  There's a pause in the middle but it's only for a few seconds so we'll go to this MSNBC clip now.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.842]  Do you fully support the Obama agenda?
[00:13:30.842 --> 00:13:31.282]  Who are you?
[00:13:31.282 --> 00:13:31.502]  Who are you?
[00:13:56.049 --> 00:13:57.469]  We're just here for a project, sir.
[00:13:57.469 --> 00:13:58.090]  Who are you?
[00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.490]  Please let go of my arm, sir.
[00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.430]  Who are you?
[00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:01.651]  Sir, sir, sir, please.
[00:14:01.651 --> 00:14:02.451]  Congressman, sir.
[00:14:02.451 --> 00:14:03.351]  Let go of me.
[00:14:03.351 --> 00:14:04.632]  Who are you?
[00:14:04.632 --> 00:14:05.792]  Okay.
[00:14:05.792 --> 00:14:16.656]  So in a written statement just a short time ago, the congressman said, quote, I deeply and profoundly regret my reaction and I apologize to all involved throughout my many years of service to the people of North Carolina.
[00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:23.218]  I've always tried to treat people from all viewpoints with respect, no matter how intrusive and partisan our politics can become.
[00:14:23.218 --> 00:14:23.918]  This does not
[00:14:24.438 --> 00:14:26.199]  Justify a poor response.
[00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:29.841]  I have and will always work to promote a civil public discourse.
[00:14:29.841 --> 00:14:35.424]  Meanwhile though, there are some Democrats that are blasting the people allegedly behind this video.
[00:14:35.424 --> 00:14:39.987]  It first appeared on Andrew Breitbart's conservative blog biggovernment.org.
[00:14:39.987 --> 00:14:47.911]  Breitbart, you might recall, was partly responsible for that notorious acorn video featuring conservative James O'Keefe when he dressed as a pimp.
[00:14:47.911 --> 00:14:53.394]  After a separate video project, O'Keefe pleaded guilty to misdemeanor for entering Senator Mary Landrieu's office.
[00:14:56.957 --> 00:15:16.215]  So that's the clip, and, um, if you listen to it carefully, the host tries to use the fact that, um, the guy who got the infamous acorn scoop pleaded guilty, um, to a trespassing misdemeanor, which is, you know, has no relation to the actual acorn story whatsoever.
[00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:18.437]  They try to use that as a conduit
[00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:47.247]  Through which to imply that these um... college students who asked the question of the congressman was somehow uh... engaging in uh... a criminal act by asking this uh... public servant a question and then this host then you know parents chris matthews debunk smear of uh... blaming the kid who who supposedly engaged in an ambush again undermining the people ask the question while failing completely to uh... explore
[00:15:48.087 --> 00:15:52.649]  Why the congressmen reacted in such an aggressive and bizarre manner.
[00:15:52.649 --> 00:15:55.610]  Now, it gets even worse than that.
[00:15:55.610 --> 00:16:12.538]  Not only are they trying to portray Etheridge as the victim of the incident, after this government memo went out saying what talking points they should go from, there's a website politically illustrated, again this neoliberal establishment website, which ran with a headline, quote,
[00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:18.874]  Bob Etheridge defends himself against student attack on sidewalk.
[00:16:18.874 --> 00:16:19.514]  So that's right.
[00:16:19.514 --> 00:16:35.785]  Now, you know, if someone punches your camera, grabs you by the neck, grabs you by the arm, and basically puts you into a half Nelson, then you better be concerned that they don't charge you with attacking them, because now these neolib websites are saying that
[00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:44.946]  Etheridge was defending himself from an attack when he's grabbing the guy almost around the throat and assaulting this individual.
[00:16:46.062 --> 00:16:55.791]  Um, and the Washington Post even reported that Etheridge's assault of this student who was asking him the question was quote, a hug!
[00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:58.273]  A hug!
[00:16:58.273 --> 00:17:06.000]  He's grabbing him round the neck, he's squeezing his arm, he's throwing punches at the camera, and the Washington Post reports it as a hug!
[00:17:06.741 --> 00:17:31.633]  You know, imagine if someone like Rand Paul, who of course was completely savage because he expressed this nuanced philosophical position on the Rachel Maddow Show, imagine if Rand Paul had been walking down the street and somebody had asked him a question about his position on the Civil Rights Act, and then imagine if Rand Paul had like grabbed somebody around the neck and started throwing punches at the camera.
[00:17:32.153 --> 00:17:39.216]  Do you think the media, the corporate media, would then just try and explain it away as a hug and a contrived set-up?
[00:17:39.216 --> 00:17:46.679]  Or would they politically lynch Rand Paul for weeks on end, as they did with the civil rights sphere?
[00:17:46.679 --> 00:17:48.099]  Of course they would!
[00:17:48.099 --> 00:17:54.242]  But this is an establishment Democrat, you know, he's an Obama minion, so they're gonna protect him!
[00:17:55.342 --> 00:17:55.402]  I'm
[00:18:13.237 --> 00:18:30.495]  Wave of success that anti-incumbent candidates have had over the past few months and this opens the door in North Carolina for another one to step in and take advantage of the fact that Etheridge has been completely publicly disgraced and shamed by his shameful behavior.
[00:18:32.602 --> 00:18:41.769]  But again, it's a sterling example of the fact that two college kids with a little flip camera can change the course of a state election.
[00:18:41.769 --> 00:18:45.251]  It's this kind of in-your-face political activism.
[00:18:45.251 --> 00:18:51.256]  The media smears it as ambush journalism, but, I mean, that's what they engage in on a routine basis.
[00:18:51.976 --> 00:19:02.003]  Especially people like Chris Matthews and MSNBC when they're attacking grassroots Americans as, you know, domestic extremists and violent radicals.
[00:19:02.003 --> 00:19:08.607]  They engage in ambush questions and journalism but then they accuse the independent media of doing it.
[00:19:08.607 --> 00:19:11.709]  But, I mean, again it exemplifies the fact that
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:33.765]  When people like Etheridge are confronted, you know, by the rabble, by the independent media, by the people they're supposed to represent, that they react in this way which just shows how they view us, how they think of us, as basically dirt, and the fact that they're not public servants, they're overlords.
[00:19:33.765 --> 00:19:39.687]  So, the establishment is running scared in a blind panic because this just shows the power
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.221]  We'll be back after the break.
[00:20:01.218 --> 00:20:01.559]  Fact.
[00:20:01.559 --> 00:20:03.161]  4 million people in the U.S.
[00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:05.284]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:20:05.284 --> 00:20:05.804]  Fact.
[00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:09.489]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the 8th leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:20:09.489 --> 00:20:10.110]  Fact.
[00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:15.617]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:20:15.617 --> 00:20:15.898]  Fact.
[00:20:16.238 --> 00:20:20.420]  One in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.982]  Fact, anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.
[00:20:24.982 --> 00:20:32.825]  Protect your liver by visiting researchedherbs.com and learning more about the world's number one selling all natural liver support formula, LIV52.

[00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.811]  Don't wait to protect your liver.
[00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:47.693]  Visit us at ResearchedHerbs.com or call 1-800-973-1486.

[00:21:01.004 --> 00:21:05.070]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:10.979]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:12.080]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.126]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:16.767 --> 00:21:30.573]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:30.573 --> 00:21:36.176]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:36.176 --> 00:21:42.079]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:21:46.084 --> 00:21:48.287]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:21:48.287 --> 00:21:48.347]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.403 --> 00:22:04.905]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:22:04.905 --> 00:22:06.166]  Tyranny is here.
[00:22:06.166 --> 00:22:09.889]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:22:09.889 --> 00:22:12.331]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:17.735]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:22:18.195 --> 00:22:24.860]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:30.844]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:22:30.844 --> 00:22:34.547]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:22:35.027 --> 00:22:39.290]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:45.255]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:22:45.255 --> 00:22:48.818]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:22:48.818 --> 00:22:50.779]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:22:50.779 --> 00:22:51.900]  It's here.

[00:23:01.024 --> 00:23:01.765]  The problem.

[00:23:04.347 --> 00:23:07.070]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.752]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[00:23:09.752 --> 00:23:12.234]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[00:23:12.234 --> 00:23:18.180]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water

[00:24:56.310 --> 00:25:00.832]  You know, this is what pays for the Mammoth bandwidth bills every month.
[00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:09.575]  And, you know, the cost of putting most of our material out for free, which is what Alex Jones does, which is what we do on a regular basis.

[00:25:47.834 --> 00:25:49.315]  That's infowarshop.com.

[00:25:59.478 --> 00:26:03.279]  And that is the best information out there for waking up other people.
[00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:05.740]  So that's infowarshop.com.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:25.388]  And of course, you know, this all goes towards growing our operation and increasing our outreach in the information war that we're now starting to see come to fruition, especially with the growth of the independent media, which is exemplified no better by this
[00:26:26.761 --> 00:26:31.006]  Confrontation of the Congressman, which we were discussing before the break.
[00:26:31.006 --> 00:26:34.350]  But now we're gonna move on to, uh, Afghanistan.
[00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:34.470]  Now...
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:44.446]  We've got a situation where polls at the moment are showing the maximum opposition to the occupation of Afghanistan since the invasion.
[00:26:44.446 --> 00:26:45.806]  You know, the surge is failing.
[00:26:45.806 --> 00:26:51.770]  We've just had one of the bloodiest weeks in the conflict, which is now, you know, nine years old.
[00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:56.053]  The UK is signalling that there could be a pullout of troops.
[00:26:57.834 --> 00:27:01.978]  After, you know, more British troops died in the past couple of weeks.
[00:27:01.978 --> 00:27:05.642]  So, lo and behold, the New York Times comes to the rescue.
[00:27:05.642 --> 00:27:12.569]  You know, the helpful progenitor of myths about weapons of mass destruction and yellow cake from Niger.
[00:27:13.129 --> 00:27:29.325]  You know, the New York Times, this big liberal newspaper that routinely supports the war, whether it's George W. Bush or Barack Obama in office, with this big announcement that they found a trillion dollars worth of gold, aluminium, copper, iron and other minerals in the mountains of Afghanistan.
[00:27:30.265 --> 00:27:38.807]  Thus providing the perfect justification and motivation for Obama to prolong the occupation.
[00:27:38.807 --> 00:27:43.247]  You know, Obama the peace candidate, the anti-war candidate, the candidate of change.
[00:27:43.247 --> 00:27:49.989]  More troops deployed, more US troops deployed than at any time during George W Bush's presidency.
[00:27:49.989 --> 00:27:53.569]  That's a peace candidate, Barack Obama there.
[00:27:53.569 --> 00:27:57.230]  And if you just merely scratch the surface on research in this
[00:27:57.971 --> 00:28:03.548]  New announcement they call it of these vast mineral deposits in Afghanistan.
[00:28:03.548 --> 00:28:04.992]  You will know that it's basically...
[00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:28.769]  Uh, as Raw Story calls it in their article, which is posted on PrisonPlanet.com, a PR scam designed to hoodwink Americans and, uh, as well as Afghan civilians into thinking that they will ultimately somehow be the beneficiaries of all this, just like, you know, we were told that, uh, Americans would get, would reap the bounty of the Iraqi oil.
[00:28:30.094 --> 00:28:35.622]  And, you know, this is nothing more than a contrived and regurgitated story.
[00:28:35.622 --> 00:28:42.992]  The Soviets, the Soviets knew as far back as 85 that Afghanistan contained these minerals 25 years ago.
[00:28:44.724 --> 00:28:47.265]  And in fact, a 2007 U.S.
[00:28:47.265 --> 00:28:54.567]  Geological Survey report said the same thing, that Afghanistan was rich with these minerals.
[00:28:54.567 --> 00:29:04.390]  People who were living in Kabul in the 70s, as is quoted in the Raw Story article, talked about how everybody knew about the fact that these deposits were in the mountains of Afghanistan.
[00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:13.132]  So we're talking about a story that's nearly 40 years old and the New York Times reports it yesterday as if it's something new.
[00:29:13.132 --> 00:29:14.852]  And why are they reporting it?
[00:29:14.852 --> 00:29:31.456]  Because the New York Times, the establishment media, basically they're just reaning off a Pentagon press release, are desperate for some pro-war grist amidst this plethora of failures that they're willing to recycle a story that's four decades old.
[00:29:32.256 --> 00:29:36.019]  And we'll continue to dig into this, and we'll get to your calls after the break.
[00:29:36.019 --> 00:29:37.821]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:37.821 --> 00:29:50.832]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:50.832 --> 00:29:52.233]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.233 --> 00:29:54.775]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.775 --> 00:29:57.458]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.168 --> 00:30:04.711]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.711 --> 00:30:05.631]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.631 --> 00:30:09.054]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.054 --> 00:30:09.914]  Number 2.
[00:30:09.914 --> 00:30:14.797]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.797 --> 00:30:15.538]  It's true.
[00:30:15.538 --> 00:30:20.421]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.421 --> 00:30:21.241]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.241 --> 00:30:24.824]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.824 --> 00:30:28.526]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:29.527]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:32.289]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.289 --> 00:30:35.972]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.972 --> 00:30:36.752]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.752 --> 00:30:40.915]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.915 --> 00:30:45.659]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:45.959 --> 00:30:50.124]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:04.136 --> 00:31:05.397]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:05.397 --> 00:31:09.061]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:09.061 --> 00:31:11.564]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:11.564 --> 00:31:16.990]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:24.099]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:24.099 --> 00:31:30.088]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:33.773]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:31:34.253 --> 00:31:38.536]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:38.536 --> 00:31:44.479]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:44.479 --> 00:31:48.041]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:48.041 --> 00:31:50.002]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:50.002 --> 00:31:51.143]  It's here.

[00:32:00.492 --> 00:32:03.493]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:03.493 --> 00:32:08.815]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:08.815 --> 00:32:10.856]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:10.856 --> 00:32:15.877]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:15.877 --> 00:32:17.058]  How much do you want?
[00:32:17.058 --> 00:32:17.778]  When do you want it?
[00:32:18.178 --> 00:32:20.060]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.141]  When will you need it?
[00:32:21.141 --> 00:32:23.344]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:23.344 --> 00:32:24.665]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:24.665 --> 00:32:26.207]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:26.207 --> 00:32:31.472]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:31.472 --> 00:32:35.056]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:35.056 --> 00:32:38.520]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.101]  How much will you need?
[00:32:40.101 --> 00:32:41.002]  We don't know.
[00:32:41.002 --> 00:32:42.103]  How much do you want?
[00:32:42.103 --> 00:32:43.024]  All you can get.
[00:32:43.024 --> 00:32:44.125]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:44.125 --> 00:32:47.168]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:49.871]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:33:19.545 --> 00:33:21.667]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.667 --> 00:33:25.551]  It's Paul Joseph Watson here on this, uh, Tuesday, June the 15th.
[00:33:25.551 --> 00:33:39.383]  Um, there's a very strange breaking story about how, um, General David Petraeus has basically collapsed during a, uh, Cerny Armed Services Committee hearing today, um, while discuss- discussing the war in Afghanistan.
[00:33:39.383 --> 00:33:45.208]  So that's, um, an interesting breaking story that we'll, uh, certainly be posting up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:46.409 --> 00:34:07.548]  We were talking about Afghanistan before the break and the discovery of these, you know, the discovery, as if it didn't happen four decades ago, which it did, of these vast mineral deposits of gold, lithium, iron, copper and others, and how this supposedly, you know, now represents a justification for maintaining the occupation of the country, of course.
[00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:23.050]  It's a complete scam, it's pro-war public relations stunt because we knew that Afghanistan contained these minerals as much as four decades ago so the fact that they're now bringing it out in the midst of all this
[00:34:24.654 --> 00:34:40.429]  Failure surrounding the surge, the potential pullout of UK troops, polls showing massive opposition, greater than ever, to the Afghanistan war pretty much tells you why they're doing it and why it came out of the New York Times.
[00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:45.815]  It's a PR stunt designed to try and rally Americans around supporting the idea that
[00:34:46.335 --> 00:34:59.901]  The troops under Obama, the anti-war candidate who now has more troops deployed than George W. Bush ever did, should keep them in Afghanistan for another decade and beyond.
[00:34:59.901 --> 00:35:01.082]  I want to talk about this.
[00:35:01.082 --> 00:35:07.925]  I want to talk about the BP oil spill, which is what people in the Prison Planet Forum certainly want to know about.
[00:35:07.925 --> 00:35:10.786]  They want to hear from people in the area.
[00:35:10.786 --> 00:35:14.788]  So we're going to go to calls now, and the first caller is Joe in Wisconsin.
[00:35:14.788 --> 00:35:15.508]  Joe, you're on the air.
[00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:18.010]  Hi, Paul.
[00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:23.756]  I wanted to talk about checks and balances, and this North Carolina guy fits right in with that.
[00:35:23.756 --> 00:35:27.940]  Any government big enough to give you anything you want is big enough to take it away.
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:35.107]  And our 1776 government said we had inalienable rights based on something bigger than they were.
[00:35:35.107 --> 00:35:37.970]  And what if our government gave us our rights?
[00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:41.551]  Well, secular government isn't quite benign.
[00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:48.474]  It just needs something, a bigger force than it is, that gives you your rights so that they can't take it away.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:51.795]  It's also why we here in America have a Second Amendment.
[00:35:51.795 --> 00:35:54.076]  It just needs something to hold it in check.
[00:35:56.926 --> 00:36:07.671]  Well, that's right, and I mean, the attacks on the Second Amendment and the fact that rights are inalienable, you know, God-given, is apparent on a daily basis.
[00:36:07.671 --> 00:36:14.034]  And we have the growth of this statist mindset with a welfare state, especially in Europe,
[00:36:14.674 --> 00:36:16.196]  We're good to go.
[00:36:30.353 --> 00:36:52.525]  Global governance they're trying to make us acquiesce under this UN Charter which the UN affords us those rights and the UN can take them away when every man is born free and rights are God-given as is outlined not only in the Constitution but what it originated from which was the Magna Carta in England.
[00:36:52.525 --> 00:36:57.667]  So you're exactly right and we'll go to the next caller which is Marcus in Iowa.
[00:36:57.667 --> 00:36:58.588]  Marcus you're on the air.
[00:36:59.847 --> 00:37:03.108]  Hey, yeah, sorry, I'm a little nervous.
[00:37:03.108 --> 00:37:14.911]  Today at 10.37 AM Central Time in Pensacola, Florida, I was watching Obama give his speech on the oil spill.
[00:37:14.911 --> 00:37:16.651]  He said that it was a
[00:37:21.278 --> 00:37:24.060]  Exercise Act went bad, more or less.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.901]  A training exercise.
[00:37:25.901 --> 00:37:29.043]  Alex Jones also proved that 9-11 was, and so did 7705.
[00:37:29.043 --> 00:37:30.083]  Um, it's at 1037 AM.
[00:37:30.083 --> 00:37:31.704]  YouTube it, do whatever, find it.
[00:37:38.966 --> 00:37:55.231]  So you're saying that Obama said that the accident was caused as a result of a training exercise, presumably based around how they would react to an oil spill, and you're saying that this was an exercise that, quote, went wrong.
[00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:57.892]  Is that what Obama's claiming now?
[00:37:57.892 --> 00:37:59.612]  That's exactly what he said.
[00:37:59.612 --> 00:38:06.094]  If you want me to do a word-for-word, I have it paused and recorded.
[00:38:06.094 --> 00:38:08.375]  Well, I know you are on a tight schedule.
[00:38:09.614 --> 00:38:14.879]  If you were, email that clip to me at watsonatprisonplanet.com.
[00:38:14.879 --> 00:38:18.763]  Email it to me and we will play it after the next break.
[00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:19.824]  We'll definitely check you out.
[00:38:19.824 --> 00:38:21.625]  Okay, I do not know if it's on YouTube.
[00:38:21.625 --> 00:38:23.447]  I have it saved to my DVR on my TV.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:37.447]  Okay, well, I'll do a quick Google search and we'll definitely delve into it after the break, if that's accurate, which if it is, then is a massive story.
[00:38:37.447 --> 00:38:45.432]  We know Tony Haywood, the BP oil chief, sold his stock in BP immediately before the disaster.
[00:38:45.432 --> 00:38:52.317]  Goldman Sachs, which is now headed by Peter Sutherland, who was the former CEO of BP, dumped
[00:38:53.059 --> 00:38:56.291]  Um, millions of dollars worth of stock before the accident.
[00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:58.339]  Um, there were these, um...
[00:38:59.685 --> 00:39:21.455]  Unusual alterations to the hydraulic equipment that occurred right before the accident happened, so we had all these indicators of at least foreknowledge, and if now that they were running exercises based around the premise of an oil spill right before this happened, then that is a massive smoking gun, because of course, as we saw with 9-11 and 7-7, the London bombings,
[00:39:24.296 --> 00:39:35.587]  The simulation and exercise surrounding real-world events gives them culpable deniability for if any evidence occurs which points to sabotage.
[00:39:35.587 --> 00:39:42.553]  So that would be a massive story and we'll definitely check into that just after the next break.
[00:39:42.553 --> 00:39:45.136]  We're going to go to Mark in Florida.
[00:39:45.136 --> 00:39:46.097]  Mark, you are on the air.
[00:39:47.577 --> 00:39:58.884]  Yeah, I was watching CNN this morning and there were signs of businesses on the coast and it was saying, uh, Mr. President, waive the Jones Act and implement FEMA.
[00:39:58.884 --> 00:40:00.305]  Now, I'm obviously familiar with FEMA.
[00:40:00.305 --> 00:40:04.208]  I was just wondering if you knew, what are they talking about by waiving the Jones Act?
[00:40:06.226 --> 00:40:10.507]  The Jones Act, I'm not sure, I haven't heard about that one.
[00:40:10.507 --> 00:40:13.468]  There's a story here out of the Miami Herald.
[00:40:13.468 --> 00:40:21.890]  Florida Republicans ask Obama to waive Jones Act, and that's being reported by the Associated Press.
[00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:32.933]  US Senator George Lemieux and US Representative Jeff Miller want President Barack Obama to waive a law they say is keeping foreign oil skimmers out of the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:40:33.833 --> 00:40:43.505]  The Florida Republican sent a letter to Obama on Monday and planned to discuss the issue with him Tuesday during the President's visit to Pensacola.
[00:40:43.505 --> 00:40:51.755]  The Jones Act, according to this article, bars foreign ships from carrying cargo and passengers between foreign ports.
[00:40:53.297 --> 00:40:57.638]  Basically, it's another method of trying to keep people out of the area, I presume.
[00:40:57.638 --> 00:41:04.080]  Now, we know that they're keeping the media out of the area, and that's very suspicious, to say the least.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:14.703]  So, yeah, it shows that they're very keen to keep foreigners out of the area, and the US media as well.
[00:41:14.703 --> 00:41:19.244]  We're going to go to Gary in Grand Isle in New Orleans.
[00:41:19.244 --> 00:41:20.125]  Gary, you're on the air.
[00:41:20.125 --> 00:41:21.025]  What's on your mind today?
[00:41:22.131 --> 00:41:22.591]  Hi, thank you.
[00:41:22.591 --> 00:41:27.033]  I just wanted to kind of give everyone a live report of what's going on in Grand Island.
[00:41:27.033 --> 00:41:42.557]  Last week I was here and there was much more activity going on as far as the local people were concerned, but now I've come back a week later and it's basically a deserted island where there's only camouflaged colored trucks.
[00:41:42.557 --> 00:41:46.118]  There's Homeland Security trucks, you know, like regular white pickups all over.
[00:41:46.118 --> 00:41:48.739]  It seems to be all global type.
[00:41:49.944 --> 00:42:16.395]  Um, corporations here, if you go on the beach, you're watched at all times, and you're not allowed to get close to the boom, and people will just come approach you, and there's just basically security up and down the beach, and there's four-wheelers just every few minutes want to go by, and you'll see some sort of strange-looking military truck go by, and it seems like a lot of activity, but not that much cleanup, because the only people cleaning up seems to be people from Jamaica,
[00:42:17.433 --> 00:42:38.446]  And, um, the Philippines, and they just kind of walk along with these little bitty bags, and they'll take a tiny shovel, scoop it up, and, um, the, uh, president of Parkland's Parish, Billy Nungesser, said that the locals are actually going out and getting their own shop back, and just going out and cleaning it up themselves, where they're just using five-gallon buckets.
[00:42:39.486 --> 00:42:41.888]  And there's just one other thing I wanted to comment on.
[00:42:41.888 --> 00:42:44.651]  Lastly, I'd like for you to explain to me what I heard.
[00:42:44.651 --> 00:42:55.543]  I was listening to CNN, and the House of Commons actually stated that they needed to make sure that the cleanup remained global.
[00:42:55.543 --> 00:42:57.365]  And can you explain to me what that means?
[00:42:58.931 --> 00:43:04.516]  I think basically what that means, I mean, as you just mentioned, you've got a federal takeover.
[00:43:04.516 --> 00:43:17.307]  In my mind, from everything I've seen, and this is backed up by locals who live in the affected areas, the cleanup crews, the local cleanup authorities, are not being allowed to do their jobs.
[00:43:17.307 --> 00:43:25.935]  And this is an exact replica of what happened after Hurricane Katrina, where the local authorities were trying to fix the problem,
[00:43:26.215 --> 00:43:39.688]  But the Feds, FEMA especially, as you just mentioned, were actually sabotaging the attempt to clean up the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and get things back online.
[00:43:39.688 --> 00:43:40.549]  And this is a thing that's...
[00:43:41.946 --> 00:43:53.034]  Common throughout eyewitness reports in the area that the federal takeover is basically nothing more than a police or a law enforcement response on the federal level.
[00:43:53.034 --> 00:43:57.937]  It's not even an intent to fix the problem or to clean up the oil from the beaches.
[00:43:57.937 --> 00:44:06.904]  It's just about keeping people out of the area and preventing local authorities who could be doing their job in cleaning up what they can from
[00:44:07.524 --> 00:44:13.809]  Having any successful or positive impact on the drastic situation that has affected the area.
[00:44:13.809 --> 00:44:19.174]  Obama said, as soon as the accident occurred, that he would be sending SWAT teams to the area.
[00:44:19.174 --> 00:44:25.879]  So, just as under George W. Bush, we're seeing an exact same response as with the Hurricane Katrina event.
[00:44:25.879 --> 00:44:29.883]  And it seems like they want the crisis to get worse and worse.
[00:44:29.883 --> 00:44:36.048]  Because Obama, in an email he sent out yesterday, said that this is an attempt to
[00:44:37.506 --> 00:44:39.566]  Get the green economy back on track.
[00:44:39.566 --> 00:44:45.788]  Get the cap and trade, the carbon tax, back on track, which has been derailed recently.
[00:44:45.788 --> 00:44:57.190]  So, from everything you said, and especially if now we're learning that this was aftermath of some kind of exercise then, very suspicious goings-on.
[00:44:57.190 --> 00:45:00.511]  We're going to go to our next caller now, which is Jane in Ontario.
[00:45:00.511 --> 00:45:02.772]  Jane, you're on the air.
[00:45:02.772 --> 00:45:04.412]  Hi.
[00:45:04.412 --> 00:45:04.792]  Hi, Jane.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:14.364]  Um, I just wanted to point out something that I noticed in the media coverage you played earlier about the Etheridge incident.
[00:45:14.364 --> 00:45:15.204]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:45:15.204 --> 00:45:26.689]  Um, the anchor referred to the students as cameramen rather than students, which suggests that they're mature professionals rather than the young students that they actually are.
[00:45:26.689 --> 00:45:28.890]  Yeah, well...
[00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.731]  That's what Chris Matthews said as well.
[00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:41.377]  They're basically trying to smear the people, these college kids who are asking the question, as Republican plants.
[00:45:41.377 --> 00:45:51.003]  And this is an effort to take attention away from the insane, aggressive and bizarre and emblematic of thugs and people on an ego power trip.
[00:45:51.543 --> 00:45:55.287]  Um, which is exactly what Etheridge was engaged in at the time.
[00:45:55.287 --> 00:46:09.901]  Um, so yeah, they're trying to undermine the people who ask the question and shift the blame and shift the focus of the story, which is what the White House, the government memo, told them to do, and they clicked their heels, uh, and immediately did it, especially MSNBC with Chris Matthews.
[00:46:09.901 --> 00:46:12.744]  Um, Mike in Louisiana, Mike, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:46:13.812 --> 00:46:38.368]  Hey Paul, listen, I know you guys do a great job over there of investigative reporting and I want to let you know what I found out talking to a fellow that was very deeply engaged in the oil field business for 30 years and was aware of and actually spoke to one of the CEOs of one of the neighboring leaseholders to the OLBP Deepwater Horizon area and he relayed to me that
[00:46:39.526 --> 00:46:50.912]  And you guys, I guess, with your abilities, maybe could check this out, but the head of the Deepwater Oil Rig only had about five days' experience before this all happened.
[00:46:50.912 --> 00:47:07.481]  So, you know, for such a valuable asset, it's interesting that BP would throw a rookie in charge and think that they would get some kind of other outcome other than complete and utter human error, you know?
[00:47:09.227 --> 00:47:15.070]  And one other thing to nexus through this, which is interesting, is that the flood insurance program has not been refunded yet.
[00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:19.271]  The money hasn't been reallocated to get that going.
[00:47:19.271 --> 00:47:25.754]  So a lot of the loan closings in this area and around that have been needing flood insurance.
[00:47:25.754 --> 00:47:36.179]  Lenders or insurance agents have been writing it, but basically on the good faith that retroactively they'll be funded once Congress actually appropriates the money.
[00:47:36.679 --> 00:47:45.809]  So, I find it kind of interesting that we've kind of got these things going on at the same time and Congress just quote-unquote hasn't been able to get their act together and get it funded.
[00:47:47.432 --> 00:47:54.400]  Yeah, well, on the first point, I mean, you're saying that they threw this rookie in just five days before the accident happened.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:08.375]  We had the story last week where, um, the Houston attorney, Tony Busby, um, said that the Deepwater Horizon managers knew that the, not only did the oil rig have problems before the explosion, um, but
[00:48:09.366 --> 00:48:16.992]  People were actually on board the ship as it was, um, burning after the explosion happened saying, quote, Are you effing happy?
[00:48:16.992 --> 00:48:18.413]  Are you effing happy?
[00:48:18.413 --> 00:48:19.554]  The rig's on fire.
[00:48:19.554 --> 00:48:21.775]  I told you this was gonna happen.
[00:48:21.775 --> 00:48:29.421]  So, the people on board the rig knew that it had problems and that, you know, the safety procedures were out of whack.
[00:48:29.421 --> 00:48:31.382]  They were not being followed properly.
[00:48:31.382 --> 00:48:37.367]  And at every single stage of this BP story, it seems that, um, in the initial stage, they
[00:48:38.127 --> 00:48:38.688]  Well, I think
[00:48:57.262 --> 00:49:05.766]  The federal government is preventing local authorities from effectively cleaning up the spill and the beaches around the area that it affects.
[00:49:05.766 --> 00:49:16.490]  So at every stage of this story, both before, during and after, it seems they want to make it worse and that indeed they had foreknowledge that it would occur in the first place.
[00:49:18.453 --> 00:49:30.242]  And now Obama's come out with this email promoting this nightmare green economy, which was derailed basically before the accident, and is now back on track.
[00:49:30.242 --> 00:49:36.107]  The cap and trade, the carbon tax, in the name of reducing our dependence on oil.
[00:49:36.107 --> 00:49:44.213]  We know the effect that this has had with Spain, who instituted these green economy measures two years ago.
[00:49:45.123 --> 00:49:54.808]  Now Spain has a 20% unemployment rate, because for every, quote, green job that's created, 2.2 jobs are lost.
[00:49:54.808 --> 00:49:56.989]  This is de-industrialisation.
[00:49:56.989 --> 00:50:00.031]  This is the post-industrial revolution that the globalists want.
[00:50:00.811 --> 00:50:28.271]  And whether this was contrived or whether it was just an accident, the BP oil spill has fundamentally advanced the globalist agenda to create artificial scarcity, this idea that we have to completely eviscerate the oil industry and, you know, move to this green economy, and they're making the situation worse with their every action.
[00:50:28.271 --> 00:50:28.691]  And to me,
[00:50:31.021 --> 00:50:41.966]  I mean, the fact that BP put out the camera footage of the oil spill, where you see it emerging from the well, and then they announced, oh, now it's in HD!
[00:50:41.966 --> 00:50:42.547]  Oh, great!
[00:50:42.547 --> 00:50:47.269]  So BP's putting out this footage, which makes everyone focus on how bad the problem is.
[00:50:47.697 --> 00:50:50.339]  And they're only promoting how bad the problem is.
[00:50:50.339 --> 00:50:58.306]  So there's an agenda to hype this and make it appear bad, along with all the foreknowledge that they were involved in it happening.
[00:50:58.306 --> 00:51:00.889]  So we'll explore this further after the break with more callers.

[00:52:01.246 --> 00:52:06.210]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:07.190]  What have we got?
[00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:09.652]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.652 --> 00:52:10.653]  A republic.
[00:52:10.653 --> 00:52:13.295]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:13.295 --> 00:52:15.577]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:15.577 --> 00:52:17.598]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:17.598 --> 00:52:19.279]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:19.279 --> 00:52:20.600]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.201]  Children?
[00:52:21.201 --> 00:52:22.322]  Our education?
[00:52:22.322 --> 00:52:23.142]  Our money?
[00:52:23.142 --> 00:52:26.805]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:27.165 --> 00:52:32.132]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:32.132 --> 00:52:33.173]  We have the facts.
[00:52:33.173 --> 00:52:34.315]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:34.315 --> 00:52:35.236]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:35.236 --> 00:52:36.117]  We have common law.
[00:52:36.117 --> 00:52:38.641]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.641 --> 00:52:42.426]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:47.468]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:47.468 --> 00:52:48.968]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:48.968 --> 00:52:50.068]  Don't tread on me.

[00:53:02.793 --> 00:53:04.813]  Remain in your houses.
[00:53:04.813 --> 00:53:08.694]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:11.941]  Will they do it?
[00:53:11.941 --> 00:53:14.542]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:53:14.542 --> 00:53:21.006]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:53:21.006 --> 00:53:23.208]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:53:23.208 --> 00:53:25.229]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:32.353]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:53:32.353 --> 00:53:37.275]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:53:37.275 --> 00:53:43.018]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:53:43.018 --> 00:53:51.442]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[00:53:51.442 --> 00:53:53.943]  That's martiallawsurvival.com.

[00:54:18.479 --> 00:54:22.042]  It's the final segment of this first hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:22.042 --> 00:54:29.709]  Alex will be back tomorrow live and we'll have rebroadcasts of interviews coming up in the following three hours.
[00:54:29.709 --> 00:54:31.670]  Now we're going to go to Joe in Ohio.
[00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:32.471]  Joe, you're on the air.
[00:54:34.102 --> 00:54:35.323]  Hey Paul, thanks for taking my call.
[00:54:35.323 --> 00:54:36.124]  It's nice to have you.
[00:54:36.124 --> 00:54:37.685]  You're pretty refreshing.
[00:54:37.685 --> 00:54:41.107]  Big Alex Jones fan, but thanks for picking up the flack.
[00:54:41.107 --> 00:54:43.089]  I have sort of a selfish question.
[00:54:43.089 --> 00:54:46.191]  I'm reading a lot of Chomsky lately.
[00:54:46.191 --> 00:54:52.556]  A lot of Noam Chomsky, and that led me to find David Barsamian.
[00:54:52.556 --> 00:54:57.700]  And when I found Barsamian, I found a great interview with he and Ralph Nader.
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:03.585]  And I was really struck because the interview, they were basically saying the same things that you and Alex say.
[00:55:04.426 --> 00:55:05.046]  All the time.
[00:55:05.046 --> 00:55:18.396]  So my question for you is, where's the marriage between these respected, renowned, eloquent individuals and the Truth or Communities, specifically the Infowars community?
[00:55:18.396 --> 00:55:27.222]  Um, Noam Chomsky, and I mean, I started off reading Chomsky when I first started, you know, getting aware of how the world works.
[00:55:28.032 --> 00:55:30.674]  You know, ten, twelve years ago.
[00:55:30.674 --> 00:55:42.324]  But everything that Chomsky's done, certainly in the past five or six years, has been completely to the detriment of the, you know, quote, truther community, or patriot community.
[00:55:42.324 --> 00:55:51.172]  I mean, he was asked about 9-11, and asked whether he thought 9-11 was an inside job, or merely that the official story was...
[00:55:52.353 --> 00:56:06.691]  Not as the government would have us believe and Chomsky responded basically that he didn't care and for me that was a damning indictment of the fact that Chomsky is not only in 2010 not relevant but
[00:56:09.114 --> 00:56:13.977]  Many have claimed that he's merely, you know, a deep cover operative.
[00:56:13.977 --> 00:56:14.737]  I don't think that.
[00:56:14.737 --> 00:56:19.841]  I think he's just this left-wing ideologue that panders to his own audience.
[00:56:19.841 --> 00:56:27.506]  But everything that we've seen, I mean, back in, I think it was 2001, Alex interviewed Noam Chomsky.
[00:56:27.506 --> 00:56:32.490]  And suffice to say, I don't think they really saw eye to eye.
[00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:36.653]  So, to my mind, Chomsky doesn't have any relevance with
[00:56:37.333 --> 00:56:38.393]  Hey Paul, it seems these days that
[00:57:04.912 --> 00:57:15.519]  A lot of people are acting like thugs, or elected officials, or people within the federal government, and even the BP executives, so corporate and everything.
[00:57:15.519 --> 00:57:21.924]  It seems like the only ones that aren't acting like thugs at this time are the real patriots of this country.
[00:57:21.924 --> 00:57:30.810]  But what I wanted to ask you about, Paul, was you had a great article on the Paul's flag, the oil spill leaning towards the Paul's flag.
[00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:33.732]  But I read somewhere, and I can't remember where I read it,
[00:57:34.986 --> 00:57:44.941]  The owner of the oil rig was set to collect or was going to collect 200 and some million dollars twice what the oil rig was worth.
[00:57:44.941 --> 00:57:49.288]  I was just wondering if in your research have you had ran across any of that or confirmed anything about that?
[00:57:51.621 --> 00:57:54.924]  Yeah, I think I came across that a few days ago.
[00:57:54.924 --> 00:58:00.008]  It wasn't in the original article I wrote, but yeah, I'll definitely dig into it.
[00:58:00.008 --> 00:58:08.815]  What's confirmed is the fact that Goldman Sachs sold their stock in BP before this happened, that Tony Hayward, the CEO of BP, sold his stock before that.
[00:58:08.815 --> 00:58:13.999]  So, there were numerous financial agendas and motivations at work.
[00:58:13.999 --> 00:58:20.545]  What I find interesting is this idea that the oil in that region is naturally replenishing, that it's abiotic.
[00:58:20.965 --> 00:58:30.272]  So if that's true, the so-called relief wells that they're now putting in are going to have no effect whatsoever, and as many experts are predicting, this could drag on for years.
[00:58:30.272 --> 00:58:32.153]  So we've got to watch that.
[00:58:32.153 --> 00:58:33.274]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:33.274 --> 00:58:34.595]  We've come to the end of the hour.
[00:58:34.595 --> 00:58:36.556]  Alex will be back tomorrow.
[00:58:36.556 --> 00:58:38.418]  Stay tuned for rebroadcasts.
[00:58:38.418 --> 00:58:40.699]  PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:59:53.539 --> 00:59:55.941]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.941 --> 01:00:05.189]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.189 --> 01:00:06.510]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:08.272]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:10.033]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.033 --> 01:00:11.614]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.614 --> 01:00:13.176]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:17.359]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.359 --> 01:00:21.423]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.594 --> 01:00:33.921]  They had exhausted all forms of peaceful, worldly resistance in appealing to the king and the corrupt regional governors.
[01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:38.244]  And it was the Massachusetts colony that had the Appeal to Heaven flag.
[01:00:38.244 --> 01:00:45.368]  It was also adopted by the Navy after the war started, John Paul Jones.
[01:00:45.368 --> 01:00:47.210]  And so I have made my Appeal to Heaven.
[01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:48.590]  I ran out of time in the last hour.
[01:00:49.851 --> 01:00:56.677]  To get into IMF global taxes can only be enforced through global government.
[01:00:56.677 --> 01:01:01.061]  Bankers prepare to assault Americans with VAT transaction taxes.
[01:01:01.061 --> 01:01:04.744]  London Guardian with a new financial VAT tax.
[01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:07.547]  I will cover this in the last hour today.
[01:01:07.547 --> 01:01:15.874]  Another chilling article that dovetails with the report by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:01:17.369 --> 01:01:27.236]  Where the ADL is calling for law enforcement action against myself, Ron Paul, and others in a report.
[01:01:27.236 --> 01:01:29.398]  Southern Poverty Law Center actually did that in one of their reports.
[01:01:29.398 --> 01:01:30.819]  The ADL for myself and others.
[01:01:32.006 --> 01:01:40.230]  We have the full report up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and we have a video coming up in the last hour.
[01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:44.352]  DHS boss says Tea Party will engage in violence.
[01:01:44.352 --> 01:01:48.234]  This is an article up at InfoWars.com that Kurt Nemo has done.
[01:01:48.234 --> 01:01:54.477]  I think it's key for him to add a link at the top, though, to Watson's article so you can put both these together.
[01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:56.578]  Also, with what the ADL is doing.
[01:01:56.578 --> 01:02:01.001]  ADL calls for major law enforcement operations to deal with Obamacare critics.
[01:02:02.037 --> 01:02:09.982]  I talked about this two weeks ago when it first was in testimony in Congress, and then I kept getting emails saying, why haven't I covered it?
[01:02:09.982 --> 01:02:14.025]  So I covered it three or four more times, and I got more emails saying, why haven't I covered it?
[01:02:14.025 --> 01:02:18.868]  So we've got Bill Murphy we've had on years ago, back on the show coming up in the next segment.
[01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:21.690]  But because so much is happening, he was going to be on for a full hour.
[01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:23.231]  He'll probably be on about 40 minutes, because I need to
[01:02:24.471 --> 01:02:28.452]  After he's on with us, we have time to get into all this other news here.
[01:02:28.452 --> 01:02:35.794]  And the Dick Morris saying Bill Clinton personally orchestrated the 93 Waco tragedy and ties it into the government staging terror basically.
[01:02:35.794 --> 01:02:38.695]  This is big news on that front coming up.
[01:02:38.695 --> 01:02:44.797]  But we'll be talking to Bill Murphy after the break with the Gold Antitrust Action Committee.
[01:02:46.698 --> 01:02:46.958]  I think?
[01:03:17.751 --> 01:03:27.117]  I don't know how to have the ADL openly call for law enforcement to come after us and make up stuff and create strawman arguments against us.
[01:03:27.117 --> 01:03:28.738]  Now the Southern Poverty Law Center doing it.
[01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:31.299]  Because these are serious soldiers.
[01:03:31.299 --> 01:03:33.180]  The ADL are serious soldiers.
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:39.264]  So is the Southern Poverty Law Center running Elohim City and government documents have been released and tied into McVeigh and what happened there.
[01:03:39.264 --> 01:03:41.045]  They don't play games.
[01:03:41.045 --> 01:03:43.166]  That's what we've been trying to explain to people.
[01:03:43.166 --> 01:03:44.187]  This is a military force.
[01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:44.627]  We're fighting.
[01:03:48.635 --> 01:03:52.397]  Have the mainstream media always wrapping them in patriotism and all this.
[01:03:52.397 --> 01:03:57.180]  They're the opposite of patriotism, the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:08.706]  And this pretty much 100% confirms they're going to physically come after us through law enforcement.
[01:04:08.706 --> 01:04:14.970]  And when this burden comes upon me, this realization of how right we've been,
[01:04:16.826 --> 01:04:26.149]  It's a burden of responsibility that I better make every radio show in the time I've got allotted, whether it's a day or a hundred years, I better make it count.
[01:04:26.149 --> 01:04:26.970]  I better be on.
[01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:27.790]  I better be focused.
[01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:30.371]  I better use every minute I've got.
[01:04:30.371 --> 01:04:32.352]  But to do that, I've got to rest.
[01:04:32.352 --> 01:04:38.154]  To do that, I've got to get right with God completely.
[01:04:38.154 --> 01:04:45.977]  God's been calling me to take time off, to go away, to stay in a cabin for a month, to really have time to be still.
[01:04:48.479 --> 01:04:56.170]  So that the deeper understanding and the true message I have for people be put out there.
[01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:57.572]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:57.572 --> 01:04:58.273]  Stay with us.
[01:04:58.273 --> 01:04:59.775]  We'll be back on the other side of this quick break.
[01:05:00.543 --> 01:05:04.647]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:02.364]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:06:02.364 --> 01:06:04.746]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:06:04.746 --> 01:06:07.948]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:06:07.948 --> 01:06:13.051]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:06:13.051 --> 01:06:17.573]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:19.935]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:06:19.935 --> 01:06:22.476]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:06:22.476 --> 01:06:25.318]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:06:25.698 --> 01:06:33.316]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:06:33.655 --> 01:06:39.037]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:41.358]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:06:41.358 --> 01:06:45.560]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.640]  And I got news for you.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.981]  You're everyone else.

[01:07:58.312 --> 01:08:01.773]  Thank you.
[01:08:01.773 --> 01:08:07.355]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.033 --> 01:08:14.238]  Well, he testified it was on C-SPAN for the CFTC.
[01:08:14.238 --> 01:08:18.261]  He had about five minutes, so he read the information very, very quickly, so we get into the record.
[01:08:20.053 --> 01:08:25.898]  And he's Bill Murphy, Chairman and Director of GATA Gold Antitrust Action Committee.
[01:08:25.898 --> 01:08:30.321]  We've had him on over the years several times and other members of GATA.
[01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:38.608]  And so there have been some huge new developments that have even ended up in a few mainstream newspapers in the last two weeks.
[01:08:38.608 --> 01:08:39.949]  Whistleblowers in the U.S.
[01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:44.272]  and England and others coming out with JPMorgan Chase and others fixing gold and silver market.
[01:08:44.272 --> 01:08:47.455]  Now we've known this has gone on for a while, but now we're getting specifics
[01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:50.266]  And they've been harassed.
[01:08:50.266 --> 01:08:52.249]  They've had a lot of problems since they've been exposing this.
[01:08:52.249 --> 01:08:53.550]  We'll talk about that.
[01:08:53.550 --> 01:09:06.246]  But this is a big deal because we've got the manipulation and the fact that Goldman Sachs and others were telling people to invest in derivatives while they were planning to implode them by design.
[01:09:06.246 --> 01:09:07.407]  They've now been indicted for that.
[01:09:08.468 --> 01:09:17.880]  Uh, you've got more and more coming out, but one of the biggest scams is the suppression of the gold and silver market and kind of a reverse carry trade that they've been using there.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:21.785]  And so even if you don't like silver and gold or aren't into real assets,
[01:09:23.348 --> 01:09:28.650]  This deals with the overall fraud and is really a central issue.
[01:09:28.650 --> 01:09:34.692]  And so he'll be with us for about the next 40 minutes or so and he won't have to hurry through his information.
[01:09:34.692 --> 01:09:37.413]  So Mr. Murphy, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:09:37.413 --> 01:09:38.053]  You've got the floor.
[01:09:38.659 --> 01:09:39.540]  Great to be here, Alex.
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:46.725]  One thing that I know that some of your listeners may not care about gold and silver, but they certainly care about the economy and the financial markets.
[01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:50.788]  And January 31st, 2008, got a place at $264,000 full-page color ad in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:09:55.046 --> 01:09:55.346]  I think so.
[01:10:10.194 --> 01:10:11.535]  The price of gold traded freely.
[01:10:11.535 --> 01:10:12.555]  It would have been much, much higher.
[01:10:12.555 --> 01:10:15.977]  It would have been more of a warning sign.
[01:10:15.977 --> 01:10:17.377]  The thermometer would have been off.
[01:10:17.377 --> 01:10:19.118]  There wouldn't have been maybe such risk-taking.
[01:10:19.118 --> 01:10:23.060]  Interest rates wouldn't have been so low as they were for so long.
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:30.783]  And so it directly affected every one of your listeners, because they've artificially kept the price of gold way below where it should be.
[01:10:30.783 --> 01:10:33.104]  If gold had kept pace with inflation, it would be $2,300 an ounce.
[01:10:34.725 --> 01:10:40.629]  And even trading with platinum and other precious metals used to trade before the suppression scheme about the same price.
[01:10:40.629 --> 01:10:42.551]  Platinum I think is $1,730 today and gold is something like $1,140.
[01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:50.438]  Absolutely.
[01:10:50.438 --> 01:10:58.841]  The suppression of gold and silver is key to their entire derivatives fraud and allowed them to do what they've done now.
[01:10:58.841 --> 01:11:07.963]  They're now calling for world government, financial taxes, VAT on all banks and institutions, pay to the elite banks.
[01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:13.525]  They're involved in an all-or-nothing takeover right now and this information could bring them down.
[01:11:13.525 --> 01:11:15.705]  You're starting to get some major traction.
[01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:18.306]  Break down how it works and the latest information.
[01:11:18.926 --> 01:11:37.362]  The Gold Antitrust Action Committee was formed in January 1999 by my colleague Chris Powell and myself, the editor of the Daily Newspaper, and to expose the manipulation of the gold price by a bunch of bullion banks like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and then we realized that the government was involved with it also, the Fed and the Treasury.
[01:11:38.218 --> 01:11:42.341]  And we've been on this 11 years, and we finally got a little daylight.
[01:11:42.341 --> 01:11:49.546]  I was on CNBC 11 years ago, Ron and Donna, and that was the last time the American public heard from me in the mainstream.
[01:11:49.546 --> 01:11:51.427]  We've been banned ever since.
[01:11:51.427 --> 01:12:01.254]  And we got a break with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where there's a great commissioner there named Bart Shelton, who's like Elliot Ness, and he's really trying to do the right thing.
[01:12:02.614 --> 01:12:09.477]  Got me on the docket to make a presentation in front of the CFTC, and that was on television.
[01:12:09.477 --> 01:12:15.339]  Of course, the only thing that the TV feed that went down was when I was speaking.
[01:12:15.339 --> 01:12:17.940]  And as soon as I was done, the feed gets back on.
[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:24.363]  It's very interesting, because what most people don't know, Chairman Gensler, when it started, said, we're not going to get into specific allegations.
[01:12:24.363 --> 01:12:26.423]  We don't want to go there.
[01:12:26.423 --> 01:12:28.224]  And Bart Shildon got livid.
[01:12:28.224 --> 01:12:29.264]  He went red in the face.
[01:12:29.264 --> 01:12:30.565]  He said, are we going to have censorship?
[01:12:31.485 --> 01:12:36.092]  And Chairman Gensler backed out and then the TV feed went off.
[01:12:36.092 --> 01:12:42.761]  But in that presentation I talked about how there's concentration of positions by JPMorgan Chase and HSBC and other big banks.
[01:12:43.445 --> 01:12:48.009]  Let's stop right there, Mr. Murphy, because I want to go over that and take your time on this.
[01:13:07.663 --> 01:13:14.228]  But it seemed to backfire that they cut the TV feed when you were testifying because it was recorded.
[01:13:14.228 --> 01:13:16.489]  It did end up getting out on the web.
[01:13:16.489 --> 01:13:24.175]  And so, I mean, that really highlighted what you were saying for people and then that they wouldn't let the whistleblower speak.
[01:13:24.175 --> 01:13:25.696]  I mean, there's a serious cover up here.
[01:13:25.696 --> 01:13:26.577]  Go ahead.
[01:13:26.577 --> 01:13:29.259]  Yeah, well, there is.
[01:13:29.259 --> 01:13:35.103]  And what happened was this whistleblower, Andrew McGuire, got a hold of one of our directors, Adrian Douglas.
[01:13:35.899 --> 01:13:46.607]  We wrote up what Andrew McGuire had to say, and basically he told the CFTC by emails, three, four, five months in advance, what JPMorgan was going to do ahead of time.
[01:13:46.607 --> 01:13:49.509]  He says, here's what they're going to do and when.
[01:13:49.509 --> 01:13:50.210]  And it happened.
[01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:58.616]  And we had these emails, and I read out JPMorgan that their traders were laughing at the public and ripping them off, and they're making all this money, and the public is a bunch of dopes.
[01:13:59.369 --> 01:14:05.073]  Uh, because I get suckered all the time by these people that are acting in, uh, uh, collusive action.
[01:14:05.073 --> 01:14:08.596]  And so, this, the email showed up, uh, you know, Wednesday at P.C.
[01:14:08.596 --> 01:14:13.460]  and afterwards, I was able to present the press, uh, with these emails and so on.
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:18.183]  And then, uh, the next day, Andrew McGuire and his wife were, uh, hit by a car outside of London.
[01:14:18.183 --> 01:14:26.830]  It was a wild story where he was, uh, hit and then the guy tried to get away and hit two more cars and it was a helicopter chase and, uh, you can't get much wilder than that.
[01:14:27.657 --> 01:14:28.738]  Did they catch the guy?
[01:14:28.738 --> 01:14:31.820]  Yeah, but we haven't heard anything about it since.
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:33.200]  Dead silence.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.601]  But they caught him.
[01:14:34.601 --> 01:14:37.623]  Well, I don't know what's happened.
[01:14:37.623 --> 01:14:39.224]  This is amazing.
[01:14:39.224 --> 01:14:42.386]  Again, this is really at the foundation.
[01:14:42.386 --> 01:14:51.531]  It's like one of the bottom cards in a giant tower of cards that are about to topple their manipulation of precious metals.
[01:14:51.531 --> 01:14:52.192]  Please continue.
[01:14:52.711 --> 01:15:00.038]  Well, you know, one of our major issues, especially, we're concerned about, you know, what gold and silver is really where.
[01:15:00.038 --> 01:15:13.652]  One of the people who was actually a critic of ours said we were too conservative, that basically the amount of gold and silver trade in a day is 100 to 1 compared to what they actually have there in London in their vaults in gold and silver.
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:24.586]  We believe at some point, just like what happened with Madoff and some of these other scandals, should a lot of people all want to go get their gold and silver at the same time, you could end up having a default.
[01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:28.728]  And it's going to get quite wild, I believe, in the months ahead.
[01:15:28.728 --> 01:15:38.514]  And the major thing is that we've now, because of the CFTC appearance, according to the mainstream, it seems bizarre to me, but I guess that gives us credibility.
[01:15:38.514 --> 01:15:43.517]  So now there's a great deal more interest in what we have today, and it's spreading all over the world.
[01:15:45.569 --> 01:15:53.152]  Now, in layman's terms, explain to people why the system wants to suppress gold and silver and how they do it.
[01:15:53.936 --> 01:15:54.876]  Well, they do it two ways.
[01:15:54.876 --> 01:15:57.197]  One with physical gold, which they have to put in the marketplace.
[01:15:57.197 --> 01:16:00.919]  They take gold surreptitiously from central banks and feed it into the system.
[01:16:00.919 --> 01:16:06.341]  And then they use it with derivatives on the COMEX and other financial markets.
[01:16:06.341 --> 01:16:09.543]  And they play with the price in the paper market.
[01:16:09.543 --> 01:16:13.945]  And, one, the banks make money by flushing the specs out.
[01:16:13.945 --> 01:16:17.146]  Over the past, even though we've been in a 10-year bull market, they do it all the time.
[01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:20.068]  Pick up $30, $40, $50 at a pop.
[01:16:20.068 --> 01:16:20.728]  And for the U.S.
[01:16:20.728 --> 01:16:22.109]  government, think about it.
[01:16:22.109 --> 01:16:25.691]  What happens every time the price of gold goes nuts?
[01:16:25.691 --> 01:16:27.832]  People say, what, it's too much inflation?
[01:16:27.832 --> 01:16:28.693]  Crisis?
[01:16:28.693 --> 01:16:29.934]  Bad for the dollar?
[01:16:29.934 --> 01:16:31.435]  It's bad for Wall Street?
[01:16:31.435 --> 01:16:32.755]  It's bad for the politicians?
[01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:34.236]  It's bad for business?
[01:16:34.236 --> 01:16:38.879]  A rising gold price, whether right or wrong, suggests that something's wrong.
[01:16:38.879 --> 01:16:39.620]  At least that's what the
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:47.326]  Because it reveals the worthless fiat nature of the hyperinflated derivative scam.
[01:16:47.326 --> 01:16:48.066]  That's correct.
[01:16:48.066 --> 01:16:49.347]  And I know that's also what it does.
[01:16:49.347 --> 01:16:52.129]  In other words, we're printing all this money and so on.
[01:16:52.129 --> 01:16:57.233]  If the gold price were to rally $100 tomorrow, everyone would be jumping up and down about just what you're talking about.
[01:16:57.233 --> 01:17:00.796]  But because they keep knocking it down, there's very little conversation.
[01:17:00.796 --> 01:17:04.299]  It's kind of just subdued.
[01:17:04.299 --> 01:17:05.280]  Continue.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.902]  So it's, I think it's going to get very exciting when
[01:17:09.631 --> 01:17:16.997]  It's ironic that God is very well known in Russia, but hardly known at all in the United States, because we have no free press here.
[01:17:16.997 --> 01:17:26.305]  And we had a conference in August of 2005, which one of President Putin's top economic advisors, Andrei Baikov, came.
[01:17:26.305 --> 01:17:29.248]  Price of Gold was $4.36, and it wasn't going anywhere.
[01:17:29.248 --> 01:17:30.889]  That was the best conference he was ever at.
[01:17:31.707 --> 01:17:37.069]  And two days later, the gold price exploded and rallied $300 in the next nine months.
[01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:47.694]  And at that conference, I said, and was my opinion, that if it was $4.36, then the price of gold is going to go to $3,000 to $5,000 an ounce, and that's what will be needed to clear the market.
[01:17:47.694 --> 01:17:55.898]  So we have a long way to go for any of you listeners that are interested in what I believe is a great investment, even though we've been up 10 years in a row now.
[01:17:57.469 --> 01:18:05.914]  And clearly, though, they're losing control because it's gone from $300 to $1,145, where we stand today.
[01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:13.399]  So, if you look at the graph, they're able to push the beach ball underwater, but then, over time, it continues to only go up.
[01:18:13.399 --> 01:18:14.679]  They can't hold it down.
[01:18:14.679 --> 01:18:16.200]  Well, that's a good point.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.422]  And what we call it is it's a managed retreat.
[01:18:19.422 --> 01:18:23.105]  What they do is they never allow too much excitement to every end of the market.
[01:18:23.105 --> 01:18:26.487]  For example, seven times this year, gold has gone up exactly 2%.
[01:18:27.688 --> 01:18:29.269]  It's a book called the 2% Rule.
[01:18:29.269 --> 01:18:31.630]  They don't allow it to go up more than that.
[01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:32.730]  They work over the shares.
[01:18:32.730 --> 01:18:43.575]  For example, one of the big funds years ago, Oppenheimer lent the shares to JPMorgan, one of the kings of the gold cartel, to work over the share market.
[01:18:43.575 --> 01:18:45.496]  So they never allow too much excitement.
[01:18:46.096 --> 01:18:46.958]  To enter the picture.
[01:18:46.958 --> 01:18:49.602]  So gradually, it's like a stealth bull market.
[01:18:49.602 --> 01:18:55.953]  There was an article the other day that said 93% of investors believe gold is going to go down from here.
[01:18:55.953 --> 01:18:57.496]  If that isn't bullish, I don't know what is.
[01:19:00.592 --> 01:19:01.232]  Absolutely.
[01:19:01.232 --> 01:19:04.054]  So 93% believe that it's going to go up?
[01:19:04.054 --> 01:19:06.256]  No, 93% think it's going to go down.
[01:19:06.256 --> 01:19:10.178]  In other words, the public is either neutral to bearish.
[01:19:10.178 --> 01:19:15.001]  And by the way, God has been right for the past 10 years about what the price of gold is going to do.
[01:19:15.001 --> 01:19:24.387]  Yet, if you go look at the records of the Wall Street firms, they've been neutral to bearish, almost every one of them, all the way up.
[01:19:24.387 --> 01:19:29.410]  I can't imagine any other sector or market where Wall Street could be so, and they're still that way today.
[01:19:30.286 --> 01:19:43.491]  Well, again, to put that in layman's terms, it's... In layman's terms, it means that there's nobody bullish and that when markets top out, it's when everyone's bullish and there's too much excitement and enthusiasm.
[01:19:43.491 --> 01:19:46.353]  There's almost no enthusiasm about gold now.
[01:19:46.353 --> 01:19:53.355]  Exactly, but the point is, they're always saying, because they're paid to and they're always wrong, that it's going to go down and that it's a bad investment.
[01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:53.856]  That's right.
[01:19:53.856 --> 01:19:56.637]  But the people are ignoring them and they're losing all credibility.
[01:19:56.637 --> 01:19:56.977]  Stay there.
[01:19:56.977 --> 01:19:59.598]  Let's talk about this whistleblower story when we get back.
[01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:04.265]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:20:04.265 --> 01:20:06.326]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:20:06.326 --> 01:20:09.087]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:20:09.087 --> 01:20:11.308]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:20:11.308 --> 01:20:12.709]  Okay, here it comes.

[01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:16.551]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:20:16.551 --> 01:20:18.532]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:20:18.532 --> 01:20:22.214]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:20:22.214 --> 01:20:29.979]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.

[01:21:06.377 --> 01:21:09.141]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:21:09.141 --> 01:21:13.648]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:19.005]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[01:22:00.683 --> 01:22:03.625]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:22:03.625 --> 01:22:07.787]  Are we going to see economic growth, slide into a recession, or at worst, depression?
[01:22:07.787 --> 01:22:10.048]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:22:10.048 --> 01:22:15.231]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:17.032]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:18.353]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:22:18.573 --> 01:22:20.054]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:22:20.054 --> 01:22:23.436]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:22:23.436 --> 01:22:28.799]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:22:28.799 --> 01:22:37.904]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[01:22:38.064 --> 01:22:38.665]  We're good to go.
[01:23:00.163 --> 01:23:00.843]  You worry.
[01:23:00.843 --> 01:23:03.205]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:23:03.205 --> 01:23:03.745]  Hi.
[01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:06.526]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:23:06.526 --> 01:23:11.069]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:13.550]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:16.572]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:23:16.892 --> 01:23:18.813]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:23:18.813 --> 01:23:21.614]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:23:21.614 --> 01:23:25.336]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:23:25.336 --> 01:23:29.738]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:33.840]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:39.803]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[01:23:40.163 --> 01:23:42.524]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:23:42.524 --> 01:23:44.624]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[01:23:44.624 --> 01:23:49.286]  So go to Elphinfield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:23:49.286 --> 01:23:50.206]  Start now.
[01:23:50.206 --> 01:23:51.927]  Knowledge is power.
[01:23:51.927 --> 01:23:52.927]  Better take action.
[01:23:52.927 --> 01:23:53.887]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:24:04.594 --> 01:24:07.576]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:24:07.576 --> 01:24:10.479]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:10.479 --> 01:24:13.761]  Bill Murphy, the head of Gatom, reveals
[01:24:27.168 --> 01:24:31.252]  Whistleblower and gold price suppression is the YouTube video.
[01:24:31.252 --> 01:24:44.804]  They cut the TV feed when he testified and they wouldn't let Andrew McGuire, the independent metals trader, turn whistleblower at the center of a storm for exposing what is the largest fraud in history.
[01:24:44.804 --> 01:24:49.028]  Max Keiser, a year before they took down Iceland, was in
[01:24:50.765 --> 01:24:50.865]  The
[01:25:10.859 --> 01:25:11.139]  Yeah, well...
[01:25:26.516 --> 01:25:32.520]  We compare ourselves to Harry Markopoulos who went to the SEC for 10 years and said, look at this, this is a fraud.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.982]  We've been going to the CFTC for 10 years saying, look at this, this is a fraud.
[01:25:35.982 --> 01:25:41.286]  I met with the Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, the Senate Banking Committee, the Joint Economic Committee.
[01:25:41.286 --> 01:25:45.709]  We went to President Bush's good friend here in Texas, boyhood friend.
[01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:47.330]  I got a fax back from Lawrence Wednesday.
[01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:57.778]  His economic advisor said, so we've really gone after this thing, and we've really got a break here with this Andrew McGuire, because he's a former, ironically, he's a former Goldman Sachs trader.
[01:25:57.778 --> 01:25:59.019]  And it's another bar story.
[01:25:59.019 --> 01:26:08.926]  What happened was, he was out with these JPMorgan guys, he's known them for years, and they were laughing at him, and they probably had a little too much to drink, and were saying what they were doing in the gold market.
[01:26:08.926 --> 01:26:10.548]  And so he got mad.
[01:26:10.548 --> 01:26:13.210]  And he said, you know, this is just wrong.
[01:26:13.869 --> 01:26:17.131]  And so that's when, you know, we got his information.
[01:26:17.131 --> 01:26:24.335]  He's been a member of my website, LeMetropoleCafe.com, for three or four years.
[01:26:24.335 --> 01:26:25.836]  I met him in London.
[01:26:25.836 --> 01:26:26.916]  He's a stand-up guy.
[01:26:26.916 --> 01:26:27.837]  He's a smart guy.
[01:26:27.837 --> 01:26:31.098]  He deals with Asian banks and in the bullion market.
[01:26:31.098 --> 01:26:36.641]  And he just came forth and just dropped this bombshell on the CFTC.
[01:26:37.942 --> 01:26:47.889]  They're going to have a tough time letting this one go, because what do you explain to the public, especially if these marked gold and silver markets blow up like we think is going to occur?
[01:26:47.889 --> 01:26:58.116]  Now let's be specific, and I've talked to a lot of high power people from Wall Street that also live here in Austin part of the year, and we've discussed this case, and they say absolutely.
[01:26:58.116 --> 01:27:03.160]  When you go to these elite bars, and you're an elite trader with one of the big firms, and you're in a different division,
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:10.423]  They are so arrogant and brazen, all they talk about is how we're scum, fools, how they're going to take over everything.
[01:27:10.423 --> 01:27:11.063]  That's right.
[01:27:11.063 --> 01:27:17.746]  And they just constantly laugh and joke, because they know the government is run by their alumni.
[01:27:17.746 --> 01:27:18.987]  I mean, look at Goldman Sachs.
[01:27:18.987 --> 01:27:21.188]  They've got every major regulatory position filled.
[01:27:21.188 --> 01:27:29.672]  Well, half the treasurers of Goldman Sachs will call it Government Sachs, because half the people at the team at the Treasury come from Goldman Sachs, just like JPMorgan is the Fed's bank.
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:32.020]  But that's the issue.
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:39.542]  People ought to start going into these bars, these elite bars, which better wear a $2,000 suit, and start just recording these guys.
[01:27:39.542 --> 01:27:41.582]  But again, he sent them emails.
[01:27:41.582 --> 01:27:49.604]  Andrews sent emails to the CFTC, to their legal counsel, saying, here's what's going to happen and when.
[01:27:49.604 --> 01:27:50.604]  And he said, watch it.
[01:27:50.604 --> 01:27:53.085]  At certain days, they seem to attack around job reports.
[01:27:54.294 --> 01:27:57.096]  Certain government auctions and option expires and so on.
[01:27:57.096 --> 01:27:59.878]  He said, this is exactly what they're going to do.
[01:27:59.878 --> 01:28:03.841]  And the last time, I think, at one point he mentioned it, I think the price went down like 30 or 40 bucks.
[01:28:03.841 --> 01:28:06.183]  I'm proud, that's a lot.
[01:28:06.183 --> 01:28:14.029]  So, these things, this is just a bombshell that's slowly working its way around and festering.
[01:28:14.029 --> 01:28:21.174]  And finally, it's given us the attention that we've earned after working on this stuff for over a decade.
[01:28:22.009 --> 01:28:24.855]  And by the way, we're not just idle and just talking about it.
[01:28:24.855 --> 01:28:26.278]  We're suing the Fed.
[01:28:26.278 --> 01:28:33.031]  It was very difficult today for me to listen to President Obama talk about transparency, derivatives, financial market reform.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:37.081]  When he's allowing what's occurring in the gold and silver market.
[01:28:37.081 --> 01:28:40.963]  So what we did, President Obama wants more transparency.
[01:28:40.963 --> 01:28:45.865]  We went to the Freedom of Information Act and got, asked them to tell us what the U.S.
[01:28:45.865 --> 01:28:49.666]  was doing in the gold swap area, just a gold transaction kind of thing.
[01:28:49.666 --> 01:28:55.489]  And they said, got back to us and said, no, they're exempt from telling us that they're secrets.
[01:28:55.489 --> 01:28:58.850]  And so we're suing them in federal court to try to get to the truth.
[01:28:58.850 --> 01:29:00.591]  It's the American people's gold, not theirs.
[01:29:02.372 --> 01:29:03.533]  Well, I mean, come on.
[01:29:03.533 --> 01:29:11.836]  Obama passed the stimulus package that gave banks more power, and it retroactively let all the banks keep all their bonuses and run all their scams.
[01:29:11.836 --> 01:29:13.037]  And it's not just me saying this.
[01:29:13.037 --> 01:29:22.401]  I mean, I'm reading what the Texas Banking Association is saying, and their analysis is identical to mine, that this new regulatory framework at the G20 and the national level
[01:29:23.021 --> 01:29:23.781]  Give us a break.
[01:29:51.212 --> 01:29:55.135]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.135 --> 01:29:57.817]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:05.543]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:30:05.543 --> 01:30:06.544]  What have we got?
[01:30:06.544 --> 01:30:08.986]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:30:08.986 --> 01:30:09.986]  A republic.
[01:30:09.986 --> 01:30:12.648]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:30:12.648 --> 01:30:14.909]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:16.931]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:30:16.931 --> 01:30:18.612]  So they think they own our land?
[01:30:18.612 --> 01:30:19.933]  They think they own our water?
[01:30:19.933 --> 01:30:20.553]  Children?
[01:30:20.553 --> 01:30:21.654]  Our education?
[01:30:21.654 --> 01:30:22.494]  Our money?
[01:30:22.494 --> 01:30:26.137]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:30:26.497 --> 01:30:31.484]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:30:31.484 --> 01:30:32.505]  We have the facts.
[01:30:32.505 --> 01:30:33.666]  We have the Constitution.
[01:30:33.666 --> 01:30:34.568]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:30:34.568 --> 01:30:35.469]  We have common law.
[01:30:35.469 --> 01:30:37.992]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:30:41.857 --> 01:30:46.822]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:30:46.822 --> 01:30:48.324]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:30:48.324 --> 01:30:49.405]  Don't tread on me.

[01:31:00.396 --> 01:31:04.937]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.937 --> 01:31:05.858]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.858 --> 01:31:09.279]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.279 --> 01:31:10.139]  Number 2.
[01:31:10.139 --> 01:31:15.021]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.021 --> 01:31:15.761]  It's true.
[01:31:15.761 --> 01:31:20.642]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.642 --> 01:31:21.463]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.463 --> 01:31:25.044]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.044 --> 01:31:28.725]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.965 --> 01:31:29.745]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.745 --> 01:31:32.506]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.506 --> 01:31:36.188]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.188 --> 01:31:36.988]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.988 --> 01:31:41.130]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.130 --> 01:31:46.172]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:33:05.154 --> 01:33:19.643]  They railed against the crown, another ragtag band.
[01:33:19.643 --> 01:33:24.747]  Bill Murphy, the chairman and director of GATA, Gold Antitrust Action Committee, is our guest.
[01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:45.191]  Let's get back into more of what The Whistleblower said, how we know the big banks and governments fix the price of gold and silver, the way they make profits out of this, how this is detrimental to the public, and how we support GATTA and what you're doing, because clearly there's a fuse going to this keg
[01:33:46.111 --> 01:33:56.196]  Uh, of TNT that could blow this, this, this, this Ponzi scheme, this fraud sky high and really reveal all these crimes that have been committed.
[01:33:56.196 --> 01:34:07.301]  This is clearly illegal, but we want to make sure that fuse that's now burning burns faster, hotter and doesn't, uh, you know, sometimes you light a firecracker, it doesn't burn all the way.
[01:34:07.301 --> 01:34:09.622]  It, it, it stops, it sputters.
[01:34:09.622 --> 01:34:13.084]  So how do we ensure this is a touchdown for the good guys?
[01:34:14.059 --> 01:34:23.304]  Well, shows like this are a big help, Alex, and we're trying to be as visible as possible because once people look at it and really study the evidence, they go, good grief!
[01:34:23.965 --> 01:34:28.247]  And if I might say, you know, on some of the subjects you were talking about, it's not just gold.
[01:34:28.247 --> 01:34:42.193]  There's a lot of people that can talk about the Plunge Protection Team, which is the working group in financial markets, which President, I think, Treasurer, head of the SEC, and head of the CFTC, work to stabilize the market.
[01:34:42.193 --> 01:34:47.776]  And there's something I've never heard one other person mention called the Counterparty Risk Management Group.
[01:34:47.776 --> 01:34:52.418]  And if any of your people are interested, they can do a Google, Counterparty Risk Management Group, and you'll see it.
[01:34:53.961 --> 01:35:05.224]  Excuse me, it's a group of the hedge funds and some of the big Wall Street firms, and you'll see their main mantra, fed up by a lot of the Goldman Sachs people, is to create, quote, stability in the market.
[01:35:05.224 --> 01:35:07.885]  And they're behind the scenes working on the stock market.
[01:35:07.885 --> 01:35:11.946]  That's one reason we believe we've had this steady up-go.
[01:35:11.946 --> 01:35:13.467]  You know, geez, it seems like forever.
[01:35:13.467 --> 01:35:17.288]  It just never seems to correct and just goes up a little bit every day and so on.
[01:35:17.288 --> 01:35:20.849]  So it's pervasive in our markets, in addition to gold and silver, which
[01:35:21.449 --> 01:35:24.631]  By the way, they're tiny little markets for these people.
[01:35:24.631 --> 01:35:28.773]  Even if they lost money on this, it would be like a lost leader for the government.
[01:35:28.773 --> 01:35:49.345]  If you think of the trillions now, when we talk in those numbers these days, what the government's doing, the little gold market is just this little barometer that they want to have diffused, and that's why they work it over in the physical market and the derivatives, and tack at certain times and flush out the speculators, get people demoralized, and then it goes right back up again, like you hit a beach ball, it's submerged, they can't keep it down.
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:56.244]  And we have a long way to go here, and we're working very hard at it.
[01:35:56.244 --> 01:36:02.268]  I talk about the gold market every day at LaMetropoleCafe.com, and people can sign up for a two-week free trial.
[01:36:02.268 --> 01:36:04.490]  And if they like it, it's a subscription.
[01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:08.472]  But the GATA site, go to www.gata.org.
[01:36:08.472 --> 01:36:09.793]  It's a free site.
[01:36:09.793 --> 01:36:11.894]  Chris Powell puts out emails all the time.
[01:36:11.894 --> 01:36:16.938]  He just does a fantastic job alerting people what's going on so they can keep abreast of the situation.
[01:36:17.853 --> 01:36:18.793]  You know, we know.
[01:36:18.793 --> 01:36:25.056]  Maybe we're going to get a break with the district court in our lawsuit against it to try to get information from the Fed.
[01:36:25.056 --> 01:36:31.378]  I know the Fed's petrified of the gold issue, which is why they're fighting Ron Paul and his bill to audit the Fed.
[01:36:31.378 --> 01:36:33.499]  Yeah, because this isn't just a little bitty market.
[01:36:33.499 --> 01:36:40.362]  I mean, in the aggregate it is, but it could become the biggest market and it would unseat all of their fraudulent paper.
[01:36:40.362 --> 01:36:45.104]  And now we've got Bloomberg and others reporting, federal regulators are going in telling
[01:36:45.604 --> 01:36:51.054]  Public and private pension funds threatening them to invest people's savings in quote
[01:36:52.025 --> 01:36:52.866]  We're good to go.
[01:37:22.605 --> 01:37:24.846]  And it's going to be a major, major story.
[01:37:24.846 --> 01:37:34.108]  And it unseats all of the major global currencies that are being debased in a concerted effort on record by the G20 so that people don't recognize.
[01:37:34.108 --> 01:37:38.989]  It's kind of like in the U.S., you know, they've got a debased currency in Mexico because it's 3-to-1, 4-to-1.
[01:37:38.989 --> 01:37:45.491]  But instead now, with the euro and all the other major currencies, they're devaluing them basically simultaneously.
[01:37:46.092 --> 01:37:48.373]  Yes, that's right, right to the point.
[01:37:48.373 --> 01:37:56.636]  Matter of fact, I mentioned Russia earlier, like the NBC of Russia, Studio One, came here about two weeks ago with a camera person and a reporter.
[01:37:56.636 --> 01:37:58.357]  They're doing a big story on this.
[01:37:58.357 --> 01:38:03.219]  And as I said, it's so ironic that God is very well known in Russia and not known at all in the United States.
[01:38:07.546 --> 01:38:08.946]  Anthony Sutton and others got the U.S.
[01:38:08.946 --> 01:38:17.929]  government documents on this, and of course he worked for the Senate, that the large central banks here and in England funded the Communists.
[01:38:17.929 --> 01:38:26.491]  And when the Russians in the late 90s kicked out the oligarchs, it turned out they were all fronts for Western brokerage houses and banks.
[01:38:27.091 --> 01:38:32.632]  And Russia's got its own problems, but Russia is now, in many cases, more free market than we are.
[01:38:32.632 --> 01:38:34.512]  They pay people to have children, though.
[01:38:34.512 --> 01:38:36.553]  Our government wants a one-child policy.
[01:38:36.553 --> 01:38:38.473]  They've arrested the oligarchs.
[01:38:38.473 --> 01:38:40.273]  They're talking about world government.
[01:38:40.273 --> 01:38:43.114]  They're talking about the New World Order.
[01:38:43.114 --> 01:38:56.256]  And they're covering all these subjects, because for the first time in close to 100 years, there appears to be a real fissure between Russia and the Anglo-American banking establishment.
[01:38:56.744 --> 01:39:15.609]  Well, I know that the Bank of England has been very responsible for the gold price suppression scheme, and right now it's a big deal, the gold subject, because Gordon Brown's running for re-election, and he sold half their gold right at the bottom of the market, and I have this all laid out with his connection with Goldman Sachs.
[01:39:15.609 --> 01:39:17.289]  The bullion banks were in trouble back then.
[01:39:17.289 --> 01:39:20.210]  They needed supply, so he sold England's gold at the bottom.
[01:39:20.210 --> 01:39:25.451]  It's cost him billions and billions of dollars, and we're trying to make some pay with this one before the election over there in England.
[01:39:26.821 --> 01:39:28.662]  Absolutely, that's the type of thing they do.
[01:39:28.662 --> 01:39:34.383]  And of course you go back to 1933 when they made physical holding of gold illegal.
[01:39:34.383 --> 01:39:40.125]  And then they jacked up the price a few years ago, they doubled it, after all our gold had basically been shipped to Europe.
[01:39:40.125 --> 01:39:43.646]  So they run these scams.
[01:39:43.646 --> 01:39:54.990]  Other points that are important for people to be made aware of, looking into your crystal ball and talking to people in the markets, I don't want you to make a prediction, but if you had to dead reckon, how do you see this unfolding?
[01:39:56.032 --> 01:40:04.434]  Probably like every other scandal, whether it's Revco or Brokerage House or Enron or Madoff, it blows up.
[01:40:04.434 --> 01:40:07.295]  And then all of a sudden, everyone's running around saying, how could this have happened?
[01:40:07.295 --> 01:40:13.957]  And everybody, you know, people delve into the facts of the story, and that's how it's exposed, unfortunately.
[01:40:13.957 --> 01:40:19.798]  And it's likely to be the way it's going to happen here, where silver and gold just absolutely explode.
[01:40:19.798 --> 01:40:21.539]  There's some defaults in the marketplace.
[01:40:21.539 --> 01:40:22.419]  People can't deliver.
[01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:30.266]  Uh, on their promises to deliver, you know, the physical billion to people and, uh, it'll be a huge, huge commotion.
[01:40:30.266 --> 01:40:33.609]  That's how I think it's gonna play out.
[01:40:33.609 --> 01:40:34.610]  What's the time frame?
[01:40:34.610 --> 01:40:35.671]  Next two, three years?
[01:40:35.671 --> 01:40:39.214]  Yeah, you know, it's... Jesus, so tough about the time frame, you know?
[01:40:39.214 --> 01:40:42.137]  I mean, it could happen in two weeks or two years.
[01:40:42.137 --> 01:40:43.678]  It's just one of these things.
[01:40:43.678 --> 01:40:47.462]  Had we not had the financial scandal, Madoff would still be trucking right along.
[01:40:47.890 --> 01:40:50.251]  And a lot of this is up to the listeners of this show.
[01:40:50.251 --> 01:40:51.451]  We have several million listeners.
[01:40:51.451 --> 01:41:10.836]  If they get the censored video of you and others out to people, if they get the censored documents out, if they put pressure, I mean, that's why Obama politically now is going after, with the SEC, Goldman, with, you know, a $5 million fine, slap on the wrist, an investigation, maybe some underling will go on probation.
[01:41:10.836 --> 01:41:12.337]  They're having to at least do that.
[01:41:12.717 --> 01:41:14.998]  Because it's political suicide if they don't.
[01:41:14.998 --> 01:41:29.506]  We need to force this out all the way into the open, because even though this is a whitewashed investigation, it's now opening up more lawsuits, it's now legitimizing those of us that have exposed the corruption of the main pilots of this banking cartel, Goldman Sachs.
[01:41:29.506 --> 01:41:29.907]  That's right.
[01:41:29.907 --> 01:41:33.148]  The irony is, is that right now the two honchos are HSBC,
[01:41:34.779 --> 01:41:40.663]  And JPMorgan Chase, where Goldman Sachs was the ringleader in this thing for, I don't know, 6, 7, 8, 9 years.
[01:41:40.663 --> 01:41:51.310]  They've disappeared of late, maybe because they're concentrating on the stock market, I don't know, but everywhere we looked for a period of 8 or 9 years, Goldman Sachs was everywhere on this particular issue.
[01:41:51.926 --> 01:41:52.846]  Yes?
[01:41:52.846 --> 01:41:54.667]  Yeah, they're now top of the heap.
[01:41:54.667 --> 01:41:55.267]  Top of the heap.
[01:41:55.267 --> 01:41:59.209]  Their underlings are now carrying on this operation.
[01:41:59.209 --> 01:42:00.129]  Ah, yes, I believe he is.
[01:42:00.129 --> 01:42:03.611]  I think the most important point you made is 90 plus percent.
[01:42:03.611 --> 01:42:05.912]  I think you gave the number of 93 percent.
[01:42:05.912 --> 01:42:07.372]  I'm looking at news today.
[01:42:07.372 --> 01:42:11.934]  Gold weaker as Greece debt issue back on front burner.
[01:42:11.934 --> 01:42:13.675]  Well, that's the same reason.
[01:42:13.675 --> 01:42:15.696]  The commentary is ludicrous in this industry.
[01:42:16.477 --> 01:42:20.480]  Lastly, it goes up because of the Greek problems.
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.601]  Then it's down.
[01:42:21.601 --> 01:42:26.385]  If these people hit the market, then the reporters just talk about anything.
[01:42:26.385 --> 01:42:30.789]  You can have a Coke White Coke and be up 50 bucks on the Greek debt problems.
[01:42:31.732 --> 01:42:32.813]  Well, that's what I was about to say.
[01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:44.283]  Just as a layman here, but I've done a lot of research, having major currency crises that even in the words of Merkel and the words of Soros could bring down the euro.
[01:42:44.283 --> 01:42:50.349]  This could bring down the euro and by every barometer that should shoot gold straight up.
[01:42:50.349 --> 01:42:54.352]  And there's all these headlines about gold down five dollars or four and a half dollars.
[01:42:54.352 --> 01:42:56.734]  Let me give you the exact number, folks.
[01:42:57.595 --> 01:43:03.958]  Gold's down $4.70 right now, and the media's saying because currencies are in trouble?
[01:43:03.958 --> 01:43:05.439]  Currencies are- It's ludicrous!
[01:43:05.439 --> 01:43:06.819]  This is what happens.
[01:43:06.819 --> 01:43:19.705]  Over the years, and we've seen this, any followers I know there's a bunch of people listening on your show, the worse the situation or the better it is for gold, or the more reasons for people to go to gold, that's when the gold cartel attacks the price.
[01:43:19.705 --> 01:43:23.127]  Because they want to diffuse the barometer, tone down the thermometer.
[01:43:23.687 --> 01:43:25.551]  They do it all the time.
[01:43:25.551 --> 01:43:31.080]  It's just, again, it's ridiculous for people to say gold's going down because of the crisis.
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:32.342]  You know, it's just nuts.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:34.760]  No, it is nuts.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:38.421]  But again, they know people are looking at a month-to-month or week-to-week graph.
[01:43:38.421 --> 01:43:43.683]  You look at the year graph, you look at the two-year, the three-year, the four-year, the five, gold's going straight up.
[01:43:43.683 --> 01:43:48.924]  And if it continues like this, what, another ten years, we'll be looking at $2,000 announced.
[01:43:48.924 --> 01:43:53.745]  We'll be looking at $2,000 probably in another year, not ten years.
[01:43:53.745 --> 01:43:55.326]  Well, absolutely.
[01:43:55.326 --> 01:43:58.827]  But I mean, even in a suppressed market, even if they continue this scam,
[01:44:00.930 --> 01:44:02.370]  You know, in 10 years it would double again.
[01:44:02.370 --> 01:44:03.331]  That's a great investment.
[01:44:03.331 --> 01:44:04.191]  Yeah, of course.
[01:44:04.191 --> 01:44:08.372]  What's happening is they're running out of available central bank gold.
[01:44:08.372 --> 01:44:13.073]  People think that the gold industry says there's 30,000 tons of gold in central bank vaults.
[01:44:13.073 --> 01:44:18.834]  According to the work of our guys, which are pretty tough-shelled guys, there's less than 15,000 tons.
[01:44:18.834 --> 01:44:22.015]  European central banks are selling 400 to 500 tons of gold a year.
[01:44:22.015 --> 01:44:25.375]  The past three or four months, they haven't sold an ounce.
[01:44:25.375 --> 01:44:26.176]  It's drying up.
[01:44:26.176 --> 01:44:28.156]  It's like an army that's running out of ammunition.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:31.401]  Well, I just did the math, and I was wrong.
[01:44:31.401 --> 01:44:34.103]  I was just throwing a basic number out there.
[01:44:34.103 --> 01:44:35.643]  If gold is up almost four-fold,
[01:44:47.569 --> 01:44:51.753]  In the last 10 years, then it's exponential.
[01:44:51.753 --> 01:44:56.638]  If it was doubling, you know, basically every three, four years, then you're right.
[01:44:56.638 --> 01:45:00.282]  In another year and a half or so, it should be well above 2,000.
[01:45:00.282 --> 01:45:04.265]  But I was saying even in their rigged market, you know, we could be looking at 2,000, 3,000, 4,000.
[01:45:04.265 --> 01:45:06.367]  The sky's the limit.
[01:45:06.367 --> 01:45:11.913]  From all of your research, and I know you guys are conservative, where should gold be for real inflation right now?
[01:45:12.553 --> 01:45:13.715]  $2,300 an ounce.
[01:45:13.715 --> 01:45:16.477]  That's what it would be, and that's according to many other people.
[01:45:16.477 --> 01:45:22.323]  Had it kept pace with inflation, and that's just the published inflation numbers, much less the real inflation numbers.
[01:45:22.323 --> 01:45:25.005]  So, we have a long way to go.
[01:45:25.005 --> 01:45:35.655]  Again, if I can stress this, the bad guys are running out of ammunition to keep the price down, and you're going to see some kind of major league firework sometime this year.
[01:45:35.655 --> 01:45:37.257]  But, they do have a lot of
[01:45:38.652 --> 01:45:39.852]  Money behind the scenes.
[01:45:56.443 --> 01:45:59.585]  By using this physical goal, but they're hitting the wall.
[01:45:59.585 --> 01:46:01.527]  One of our guys, our consultants, predicted this.
[01:46:01.527 --> 01:46:04.869]  We had a conference in Durban, South Africa, May 10, 2001.
[01:46:04.869 --> 01:46:10.974]  He said in 7 to 10 years, they're going to run out of enough gold to keep the price from really taking off.
[01:46:10.974 --> 01:46:12.695]  Well, we're right in the middle of that zone right now.
[01:46:15.276 --> 01:46:19.997]  Wow, so we could see this in the next month or the next two years, but time is on our side.
[01:46:19.997 --> 01:46:21.857]  Yeah, it's coming, and it's inevitable.
[01:46:21.857 --> 01:46:29.699]  I mean, it's just a matter of how much, again, how much ammunition they can come up with at a given time to meet the growing physical market demand.
[01:46:29.699 --> 01:46:39.401]  So, it's very exciting, very frustrating on a day-to-day basis, but again, we've been up ten years in a row, and as you said earlier, the acceleration phase is still ahead of us.
[01:46:40.396 --> 01:46:46.823]  All right, in closing, we have the head of GATA, Bill Murphy, Chairman and Director of GATA, on with us.
[01:46:46.823 --> 01:46:49.746]  Going back to the whistleblower, you say he and his family were hit by a car.
[01:46:49.746 --> 01:46:56.573]  I remember seeing that in the news, that the person ran, and that we haven't heard what's happened since then.
[01:46:56.573 --> 01:46:57.935]  How is Andrew McGuire doing?
[01:46:57.935 --> 01:46:59.216]  Have you had a chance to talk to him?
[01:46:59.216 --> 01:46:59.717]  Is he getting better?
[01:46:59.957 --> 01:47:03.759]  Yeah, he talks to my colleague Adrian Douglas quite a bit.
[01:47:03.759 --> 01:47:11.404]  There's a bunch of interviews people are talking to him over there and I think he's going further with the legal counsel, the CFTC.
[01:47:11.404 --> 01:47:15.387]  So there's stuff going on behind the scenes and it's a process.
[01:47:15.387 --> 01:47:17.548]  These investigations do take a long time, unfortunately.
[01:47:17.568 --> 01:47:18.948]  Well, let me do this with you.
[01:47:18.948 --> 01:47:22.229]  Let me put you on hold and have my producer talk to you.
[01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:28.411]  I would like to get you or your other colleague on with Mr. McGuire for a full hour sometime next week.
[01:47:28.411 --> 01:47:36.474]  I think people need to hear directly from the whistleblower who saw these JPMorgan Chase people, you know, rubbing their hands together in glee.
[01:47:36.474 --> 01:47:38.094]  Do you think that's doable, Mr. Murphy?
[01:47:38.094 --> 01:47:39.455]  I'd be fine with me.
[01:47:39.455 --> 01:47:45.336]  I have to go to Miami to meet somebody at the Financial Times next week, but I'd love to do it.
[01:47:45.336 --> 01:47:47.357]  I just have to see what Andrew's schedule is.
[01:47:48.254 --> 01:47:52.715]  Okay, and you also talked about your other colleague that's working with him.
[01:47:52.715 --> 01:47:56.236]  He's an oil consultant, but if he's free, I'm sure he'd love to do it.
[01:47:56.236 --> 01:47:56.557]  Sure.
[01:47:56.557 --> 01:47:59.477]  I mean, just the more the merrier, getting your different perspectives here.
[01:47:59.477 --> 01:48:01.718]  I want to thank you for your tireless 11-year effort.
[01:48:01.718 --> 01:48:03.679]  It's certainly bearing fruit.
[01:48:03.679 --> 01:48:08.560]  I mean, there you were, 260-something bucks an ounce back when you started, and it's $1,145 today.
[01:48:11.741 --> 01:48:14.063]  And so we're having a great victory.
[01:48:14.063 --> 01:48:24.070]  I'm going to put you on hold, sir, and try to iron some of those basics out right now about getting the whistleblower on the show at your convenience, Andrew McGuire.
[01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:26.572]  Perhaps we can get his contact info from you.
[01:48:26.572 --> 01:48:28.233]  Thank you so much for joining us, sir.
[01:48:28.233 --> 01:48:29.534]  Anytime, Alex.
[01:48:29.534 --> 01:48:31.115]  All right, amazing information.
[01:48:31.115 --> 01:48:38.121]  We're going to get his info now with Jaron and get that set up.
[01:48:38.121 --> 01:48:39.021]  I tell you, folks,
[01:48:40.453 --> 01:49:04.416]  AP sued, now it's 10 years ago, and got all the internal minutes of the meetings between the Big Ten oil companies, how they said there's too much oil, we're going to promote peak oil, we're going to tell the school kids and everybody there's no oil, we're going to fund the environmental movement to brainwash people about this, and we're going to buy up the independent refineries and shut them down, and we're going to restrict oil that way.
[01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:13.514]  And the Pentagon comes out last week and says there's no more oil, and within two years you're all going to be paying seven bucks a gallon.
[01:49:13.514 --> 01:49:14.255]  Water.
[01:49:14.255 --> 01:49:15.576]  There's more water than ever.
[01:49:15.576 --> 01:49:21.520]  There's all these ways to get water, even in areas like Southern California.
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:27.624]  But they tell you, even in areas of washing water like England, oh you're going to pay double, triple, quadruple, now there's no water.
[01:49:28.044 --> 01:49:30.165]  When England has more water than any other island nation.
[01:49:30.165 --> 01:49:37.710]  I mean, it's just the giant aquifers everywhere, incredible precipitation, huge reservoirs, and it's just scams.
[01:49:37.710 --> 01:49:48.396]  And here in Austin, they just say, hey, we are going to give you a 2.6 billion, this is Austin Energy, tax over the next three years on your natural gas and power.
[01:49:48.396 --> 01:49:53.559]  That's more than all the taxes every year combined, just one new tax bigger than everything combined.
[01:49:53.559 --> 01:49:55.961]  And it's for the earth and for the children, and just shut up!
[01:49:56.718 --> 01:49:58.301]  We're going to do it!
[01:49:58.301 --> 01:50:00.425]  We're lawless scum!
[01:50:00.425 --> 01:50:01.507]  And who do they pay the money to?
[01:50:01.507 --> 01:50:03.591]  The banks!
[01:50:03.591 --> 01:50:07.378]  And the city of Austin has taken almost all the pension funds and invested it in the derivatives.
[01:50:08.407 --> 01:50:08.587]  I don't
[01:50:33.504 --> 01:50:37.588]  Everything that wasn't nailed down, now they're in there with crowbars, stealing what is nailed down.
[01:50:37.588 --> 01:50:38.889]  They've taken the kitchen sink.
[01:50:38.889 --> 01:50:40.010]  They're pulling the tile up.
[01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:41.972]  They're pulling the drapes out.
[01:50:41.972 --> 01:50:44.494]  They're now bulldozing the building for timber.
[01:50:44.494 --> 01:50:47.937]  And we're in here with it collapsing, going, hey, don't enslave us.
[01:50:47.937 --> 01:50:49.719]  And they're saying, shut up, terrorist.
[01:50:49.719 --> 01:50:51.741]  You're planning to stage terror attacks.
[01:50:51.741 --> 01:50:52.882]  We're like, excuse me?
[01:50:52.882 --> 01:50:54.704]  We're just pointing out your crime.
[01:50:54.704 --> 01:50:56.065]  Shut up, terrorist.
[01:50:56.065 --> 01:50:58.187]  The police are going to come arrest you.
[01:50:58.187 --> 01:50:58.867]  And we're, what?
[01:51:01.277 --> 01:51:02.577]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.577 --> 01:51:08.179]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.179 --> 01:51:13.181]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.181 --> 01:51:18.223]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.763 --> 01:51:23.987]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.987 --> 01:51:26.288]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.

[01:52:01.276 --> 01:52:02.257]  Here's a question.

[01:54:12.190 --> 01:54:13.431]  All right, we're back.
[01:54:13.431 --> 01:54:14.532]  This is Ted Anderson.
[01:54:14.532 --> 01:54:17.474]  I am covering for Alex for the moment on this particular segment.
[01:54:17.474 --> 01:54:21.857]  He'll be back on again right after this, but I just wanted to get in.
[01:54:21.857 --> 01:54:24.159]  He asked me if I would come up during this segment.
[01:54:24.159 --> 01:54:27.261]  He'll be back live tomorrow.
[01:54:27.261 --> 01:54:31.244]  Looking at the news, I tell you, there's so many stories on what's going on in gold.
[01:54:31.244 --> 01:54:34.486]  I didn't know which one to touch, but I think probably the one from Reuters
[01:54:35.447 --> 01:54:40.249]  Is going to be the most significant one that will affect people here in the United States.
[01:54:40.249 --> 01:54:41.590]  The heading says this, U.S.
[01:54:41.590 --> 01:54:46.211]  gold gains as safety play after Greece rate cut.
[01:54:46.211 --> 01:54:46.952]  And what does that mean?
[01:54:46.952 --> 01:54:54.555]  Well, Moody's stepped in and downgraded the credit rating of Greece down to junk bond status.
[01:54:55.919 --> 01:54:58.340]  And why is that significant here in the United States?
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:17.730]  And the reason, probably the main reason that I can think of, is that the United States is about two years behind Greece as far as how much government obligation there is in relationship to the GDP or the production of what the United States citizens produce.
[01:55:18.570 --> 01:55:26.538]  Once we get up above 100% of our GDP, we're going to be sitting in the same position as Greece.
[01:55:26.538 --> 01:55:33.784]  And that means that we're going to have to pay higher interest for people to lend us money, driving our costs up on our debt.
[01:55:34.545 --> 01:55:34.825]  I think so.
[01:55:54.116 --> 01:56:00.838]  The best suggestion that I can give you is picking up a subscription to Bob Chapman's newsletter, The International Forecaster.
[01:56:00.838 --> 01:56:02.518]  I mean, he really does cover this.
[01:56:02.518 --> 01:56:03.838]  He covers it well.
[01:56:03.838 --> 01:56:07.759]  He explains it in layman's terms that the average person can understand.
[01:56:07.759 --> 01:56:13.381]  You don't have to be a sophisticated investor to figure out what the heck he's trying to say.
[01:56:13.381 --> 01:56:17.362]  Higher interest rates just means a slowing of the economy.
[01:56:17.362 --> 01:56:18.002]  It means higher costs
[01:56:19.782 --> 01:56:20.722]  I don't know.
[01:56:41.167 --> 01:56:44.149]  And of course, that's what's inspiring people to buy gold.
[01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:46.932]  And that's what's pushing investors into the gold at this time.
[01:56:46.932 --> 01:56:51.975]  We have gold running up as high as $1,233 an ounce today.
[01:56:51.975 --> 01:56:58.140]  And you know, no kidding, because Europeans are watching this happen to them.
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:01.362]  And now here in the United States, we're going to be suffering through the same process.
[01:57:01.362 --> 01:57:04.465]  That's just, it's a shame that we put ourselves into this position.
[01:57:04.465 --> 01:57:05.646]  There's no excuse for it.
[01:57:06.266 --> 01:57:14.857]  But we are still offering, if you want that International Forecaster subscription for free, Bob charges $159 per year.
[01:57:14.857 --> 01:57:21.245]  But if you buy one franc from us at $2.65, we'll buy that subscription for you.
[01:57:21.245 --> 01:57:22.446]  And I mean, I do buy it.
[01:57:22.446 --> 01:57:24.849]  I mean, I have to pay Bob for this, but we'll buy it for you.
[01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:31.372]  And you'll either get it by email four times a month, or you're going to get it by snail mail two times a month.
[01:57:31.372 --> 01:57:37.733]  But either way, I just need to say it's what you need to do if you want to understand what's going on in the marketplace.
[01:57:37.733 --> 01:57:43.015]  Right now, gold is trading at that $1,230 level, so it is going up.
[01:57:43.015 --> 01:57:53.358]  Prices are rising due to the fact that we're having further erosions in Europe, and the Europeans are starting to shore up their portfolios, and they know that there's a risk in buying U.S.
[01:57:53.358 --> 01:57:54.518]  government treasury bills.
[01:57:56.038 --> 01:57:56.578]  I don't think so.
[01:58:14.131 --> 01:58:22.137]  Get Bob Chapman's newsletter by calling us at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:58:22.137 --> 01:58:23.579]  Just pick up one of those francs.
[01:58:23.579 --> 01:58:25.580]  We'll buy the subscription for the year.
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:28.943]  If you'd like to just see a complimentary copy, we'll send you one of those as well.
[01:58:30.063 --> 01:58:33.465]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:58:33.465 --> 01:58:35.846]  And again, Alex Jones, thank you for listening.
[01:58:35.846 --> 01:58:38.108]  I thank you for listening to the show.
[01:58:38.108 --> 01:58:41.449]  You've been a great audience and we look forward to doing so much more.
[01:58:41.449 --> 01:58:45.752]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:58:51.328 --> 01:58:54.332]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:54.332 --> 01:58:59.679]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:59.679 --> 01:59:01.722]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:01.722 --> 01:59:06.728]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:06.728 --> 01:59:07.910]  How much do you want?
[01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:08.631]  When do you want it?
[01:59:09.011 --> 01:59:10.893]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:10.893 --> 01:59:11.974]  When will you need it?
[01:59:11.974 --> 01:59:14.175]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:14.175 --> 01:59:15.517]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:15.517 --> 01:59:17.038]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:17.038 --> 01:59:22.302]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:22.302 --> 01:59:25.445]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:25.885 --> 01:59:29.707]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:29.707 --> 01:59:30.928]  How much will you need?
[01:59:30.928 --> 01:59:31.829]  We don't know.
[01:59:31.829 --> 01:59:32.949]  How much do you want?
[01:59:32.949 --> 01:59:33.870]  All you can get.
[01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:34.970]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:34.970 --> 01:59:38.012]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:38.012 --> 01:59:39.793]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:39.793 --> 01:59:40.714]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:53.723 --> 01:59:56.104]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.104 --> 02:00:09.448]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:09.448 --> 02:00:18.891]  So, Bob Chapman, I can't say on air what TV network the person works for that you were just mentioning, can I?
[02:00:18.891 --> 02:00:20.371]  I don't think you should.
[02:00:20.371 --> 02:00:21.251]  They know.
[02:00:21.251 --> 02:00:22.772]  They monitor all these programs.
[02:00:23.527 --> 02:00:28.810]  They just get more mad and try to figure out what to do about it.
[02:00:28.810 --> 02:00:32.893]  But these people aren't going to go away, and we're not going to go away either.
[02:00:32.893 --> 02:00:37.896]  And we're just going to keep on doing what we're doing, which is waking people up to the truth.
[02:00:37.896 --> 02:00:46.641]  And it'll all fall in place, and if we don't do a good enough job, he'll step in, the Lord, and he'll help us, just like you said earlier.
[02:00:46.641 --> 02:00:49.843]  So let's just keep on doing what we're doing, but you're going to help us out there.
[02:00:51.411 --> 02:00:55.515]  Especially how people like the gentleman and his wife who are just on here.
[02:00:55.515 --> 02:00:57.497]  It's incredible what they're going through.
[02:00:57.497 --> 02:01:02.061]  And I'm sure these sort of things are going on throughout the country.
[02:01:02.061 --> 02:01:03.222]  And we can't have that.
[02:01:05.828 --> 02:01:06.769]  Dwarf even that.
[02:01:06.769 --> 02:01:09.090]  It's just I know these people.
[02:01:09.090 --> 02:01:10.411]  It's happening all around us.
[02:01:10.411 --> 02:01:14.373]  For the average person in government, though, who's even involved in corruption, they're compartmentalized.
[02:01:14.373 --> 02:01:15.834]  They don't get the big picture.
[02:01:15.834 --> 02:01:17.055]  They haven't studied it.
[02:01:17.055 --> 02:01:22.138]  I mean, now the government's openly announcing every week they're going to start taking pension funds.
[02:01:22.138 --> 02:01:26.060]  I mean, that's now what the good guys do, and they're going to use homeland security to make sure it happens.
[02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:28.122]  I mean, this is pure evil.
[02:01:28.122 --> 02:01:30.203]  They've thrown their lot in with pure evil.
[02:01:30.203 --> 02:01:32.504]  It's not too late for a lot of these guys that work for evil to
[02:01:34.628 --> 02:01:38.351]  Make the decision to join the Patriots.
[02:01:38.351 --> 02:01:40.473]  An exit.
[02:01:40.473 --> 02:01:42.234]  And, you know, that's where they get them.
[02:01:42.234 --> 02:01:43.435]  They need to make a living.
[02:01:43.435 --> 02:01:45.957]  And, of course, the economy's terrible.
[02:01:45.957 --> 02:01:48.759]  And if you leave your post, where are you going to work?
[02:01:48.759 --> 02:01:53.282]  They're not even hiring garbage collectors.
[02:01:53.282 --> 02:01:55.965]  It's bad out there, and it's going to get a lot worse.
[02:01:55.965 --> 02:01:58.907]  And so these people, a lot of them are trapped.
[02:01:58.907 --> 02:02:00.268]  They say, well, I don't want to do that.
[02:02:00.268 --> 02:02:01.629]  Well, if you don't, you're out of here.
[02:02:02.662 --> 02:02:08.266]  You just like the policeman, they say, look, you're going to write 40 tickets a month.
[02:02:08.266 --> 02:02:09.487]  And that's the end of it.
[02:02:09.487 --> 02:02:14.390]  If you don't, you know, you're going to either be demoted or we're going to replace you.
[02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:19.414]  And then they lie about it and say there aren't quotas, but now they admit there's quotas.
[02:02:19.414 --> 02:02:21.916]  Finally, after, you know, what, 100 years?
[02:02:24.973 --> 02:02:28.016]  Some states are really dreadful.
[02:02:28.016 --> 02:02:31.380]  I got a letter today from someone who lived in New Jersey.
[02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:33.782]  It's incredible.
[02:02:33.782 --> 02:02:36.265]  They need to raise revenues so badly.
[02:02:36.265 --> 02:02:41.771]  It doesn't matter whether you break the law or infractions.
[02:02:41.771 --> 02:02:44.934]  They're going to pull you over anyway because they need the money.
[02:02:45.734 --> 02:02:53.178]  Well, that's what Robin Hood went through, and that's what all of our ancestors, regardless of what color you are or where you came from, this is the old fight.
[02:02:53.178 --> 02:03:02.824]  You get corrupt government, it gets filled with criminals, they start robbing everybody, and there's no doubt we've got a really bad brand of tyranny taking over the West.
[02:03:02.824 --> 02:03:04.325]  But the people are waking up.
[02:03:04.325 --> 02:03:08.027]  Dr. Frederick Whitehurst thinks things are better now than they were a decade ago.
[02:03:08.027 --> 02:03:11.589]  We just now know things are bad, so it seems like it's worse.
[02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:13.490]  He thinks the tide is starting to turn.
[02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:13.890]  Do you agree?
[02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:15.641]  Don't know.
[02:03:15.641 --> 02:03:22.247]  I hope he's right, but I never do things on hope.
[02:03:22.247 --> 02:03:34.079]  I always try to deal with the cold, hard facts that I can see and what I might be able to back into, knowing the only way you can understand these people, particularly at the upper levels,
[02:03:35.496 --> 02:03:40.457]  is understanding the very sophisticated criminal mind.
[02:03:40.457 --> 02:03:47.299]  And if you can understand, with a, you know, the next thing that this criminal's gonna do, you can stop him.
[02:03:47.299 --> 02:03:52.160]  And we know what they're gonna do, uh, the invisible government.
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:56.441]  Right there, you've got it right there, in the DVD.
[02:03:56.441 --> 02:04:01.042]  That's what we're gonna get out to people so they can better understand what they're dealing with.
[02:04:01.042 --> 02:04:04.823]  People in $4,000 suits, running around, robbing the world.
[02:04:06.385 --> 02:04:12.589]  Do you agree that they're going to stage events very, very soon to be blind on the Tea Party?
[02:04:12.589 --> 02:04:13.430]  Yes.
[02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:15.051]  And it just won't be the Tea Party.
[02:04:15.051 --> 02:04:16.252]  It'll be all over the place.
[02:04:16.252 --> 02:04:18.533]  And they don't have to be major events.
[02:04:18.533 --> 02:04:20.735]  They can be small ones.
[02:04:20.735 --> 02:04:23.797]  They want to keep people's minds in turmoil.
[02:04:23.797 --> 02:04:26.239]  That's why they create these wars.
[02:04:26.239 --> 02:04:35.625]  People don't worry about economics and finance if they think their three boys, who are over in Afghanistan, Iraq, and, say, Haiti, are going to get killed tomorrow morning.
[02:04:37.170 --> 02:04:39.651]  They're more concerned about that, and that's why they have these words.
[02:04:39.651 --> 02:04:41.951]  Of course, they want to get rid of people, too.
[02:04:41.951 --> 02:04:51.914]  And they want to destroy the economy, so that everybody's too busy trying to pay the rent, and pay the car payment, and the insurance payment, or fighting off the CPS to stand up against corruption.
[02:04:51.914 --> 02:04:53.254]  Bob, thanks for spending time with us.
[02:04:53.254 --> 02:04:55.035]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:04:55.035 --> 02:04:56.155]  We'll see you again next Friday.
[02:04:56.155 --> 02:04:57.335]  God bless you.
[02:04:57.335 --> 02:04:57.815]  You got it.
[02:04:57.815 --> 02:04:59.356]  Thank y'all for listening.
[02:04:59.356 --> 02:04:59.976]  You bet.
[02:04:59.976 --> 02:05:00.496]  Dan Winters.
[02:05:02.537 --> 02:05:06.498]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:06.498 --> 02:05:15.360]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:20.001]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:20.001 --> 02:05:30.803]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:31.443 --> 02:05:40.945]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:40.945 --> 02:05:46.387]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:46.387 --> 02:05:53.868]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:53.868 --> 02:05:56.629]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:06:00.350 --> 02:06:04.914]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:04.914 --> 02:06:05.814]  Number one.
[02:06:05.814 --> 02:06:09.237]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.237 --> 02:06:10.118]  Number two.
[02:06:10.118 --> 02:06:15.002]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.002 --> 02:06:15.762]  It's true.
[02:06:15.762 --> 02:06:20.306]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.606 --> 02:06:21.427]  Number 3.
[02:06:21.427 --> 02:06:25.009]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.009 --> 02:06:28.932]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:28.932 --> 02:06:29.733]  Number 4.
[02:06:29.733 --> 02:06:32.495]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.495 --> 02:06:35.838]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.158 --> 02:06:41.102]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.102 --> 02:06:46.166]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:46.166 --> 02:06:50.329]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:50.329 --> 02:06:52.131]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:52.131 --> 02:06:56.734]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:00.154 --> 02:07:04.356]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:07:04.356 --> 02:07:10.739]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:07:10.739 --> 02:07:18.142]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:07:18.142 --> 02:07:23.005]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:07:23.005 --> 02:07:25.146]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:07:27.967 --> 02:07:31.670]  Or see them online at FiveStarSoap.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:07:31.670 --> 02:07:35.394]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:07:35.925 --> 02:07:42.689]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:07:42.689 --> 02:07:46.591]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:07:46.591 --> 02:07:52.955]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:07:52.955 --> 02:07:53.736]  Thank you.
[02:08:02.699 --> 02:08:04.907]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.907 --> 02:08:08.279]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:11.010 --> 02:08:17.815]  A couple months ago, Texas Monthly, I guess three or four now, called me, did an in-depth interview.
[02:08:17.815 --> 02:08:22.938]  I thought it was going to be a bad hit piece, because mainstream media always does hit pieces, but it was pretty fair.
[02:08:22.938 --> 02:08:25.380]  I mean, I'd say 80% accurate.
[02:08:25.380 --> 02:08:36.708]  And I'd actually interviewed the reporter who exposed Thule, a Texas drug dealing, and how they had right at half the black population of the town in the jail owned by the local boss hog, and they were planting drugs on him.
[02:08:36.708 --> 02:08:37.849]  And that's Nate Blaseley.
[02:08:38.682 --> 02:08:43.385]  And then they said, yeah, we've got Dan Winters, uh, doing the photo shoot.
[02:08:43.385 --> 02:08:46.448]  And I don't, I mean, I like photography, but I'm on a photography, uh,
[02:08:47.569 --> 02:08:56.133]  You know, expert or a photography buff, but I knew the name Dan Winters because he's in the top two or three, four reporters, not just in the U.S., but in the world.
[02:08:56.133 --> 02:09:07.578]  Time Magazine, Newsweek, I mean, you name it, this guy has photographed all the top politicians, all the top writers, all the top spiritual leaders, Hollywood folks, Brad Pitt, you name it.
[02:09:07.578 --> 02:09:11.059]  We're going to be showing some of those images for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:09:11.059 --> 02:09:16.722]  For radio listeners, they can go to danwintersphoto.com and look at some of these.
[02:09:18.384 --> 02:09:21.668]  I don't know who top photographers are, but I know who Dan Winters was.
[02:09:21.668 --> 02:09:27.176]  And then he built a whole stage, a whole set for me out in his place out in the Texas Hill Country.
[02:09:27.176 --> 02:09:27.957]  And then he was telling me,
[02:09:28.977 --> 02:09:35.981]  In between the shoots, you know, all these wild stories about different politicians or people he refused to photograph.
[02:09:35.981 --> 02:09:40.664]  And so he's here until the end of the show, end of the hour.
[02:09:40.664 --> 02:09:43.025]  And so we're very, very honored to have him here.
[02:09:43.025 --> 02:09:54.391]  Weatherstan Winters began his career in photography as a photojournalist in his hometown in Ventura County, California, widely recognized for his celebrity portraits, scientific photography, and photojournalistic stories.
[02:09:54.391 --> 02:09:56.933]  He's won over 100 national and international awards.
[02:09:57.613 --> 02:10:06.497]  His wide range of publications and clients include Esquire, Fortune, Entertainment Weekly, Texas Monthly, Rolling Stone, Nike, Microsoft, Warner Brothers, and Sony.
[02:10:06.497 --> 02:10:13.360]  And in 2003, Dan was honored by Kodak as photo icon in their Biographical Legends series.
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:16.641]  So he is a photography icon, and he is here with us.
[02:10:16.641 --> 02:10:17.862]  Dan, thanks for being here.
[02:10:17.862 --> 02:10:18.662]  Good to see you, Alex.
[02:10:18.662 --> 02:10:19.402]  Good to see you.
[02:10:19.402 --> 02:10:21.503]  You bet.
[02:10:21.503 --> 02:10:26.145]  Last time it was under totally different circumstances, but I'm at the receiving end of the sharp stick now.
[02:10:26.625 --> 02:10:28.306]  Rather than you, so it's good to be here.
[02:10:28.306 --> 02:10:29.967]  Well, I tell you, you did an amazing job.
[02:10:29.967 --> 02:10:31.488]  I mean, yeah, I was pretty thrilled.
[02:10:31.488 --> 02:10:32.608]  These are some incredible photos.
[02:10:32.608 --> 02:10:35.990]  In fact, we'll put some of the photos he took of me up there and then some of the others.
[02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.510]  You're here.
[02:10:36.510 --> 02:10:37.551]  I appreciate you coming in.
[02:10:37.551 --> 02:10:39.572]  I mean, you're on the Big Conspiracy Theorist Show.
[02:10:39.572 --> 02:10:40.392]  Yeah, that's good.
[02:10:40.392 --> 02:10:41.513]  That's good.
[02:10:41.513 --> 02:10:50.377]  You know, the thing about you and the thing about what you do and what you guys do, I think, is that, you know, it's more than a full-time job to keep track of all this stuff.
[02:10:50.377 --> 02:10:53.879]  And so, you know, the normal Joe goes to work.
[02:10:54.383 --> 02:10:58.126]  He comes home from work, he kicks back, he has his beer, he watches Fox News.
[02:10:58.126 --> 02:10:59.888]  He doesn't have time to pay attention to this stuff.
[02:10:59.888 --> 02:11:05.834]  And so I've always admired people, regardless of where their position was, that kind of really pay attention to this stuff.
[02:11:05.834 --> 02:11:18.145]  And you know, I've done, I've dabbled in it, you know, and I think the most kind of almost one of the most sort of insulting, or at least kind of patronizing sort of responses that that people give me whenever I talk about these issues is,
[02:11:18.911 --> 02:11:28.459]  You know, instantly that you're like demoted to, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist, rather than having like an open minded conversation about something that you've looked into.
[02:11:28.459 --> 02:11:38.367]  It's like, you know, I looked into, you know, Flight 93, for example, you know, I became curious, I'm interested in aerospace, I heard some of the reports, well, you know, they were making cell phone calls and this and that.
[02:11:38.367 --> 02:11:43.491]  And I'm like, well, you know, the infrastructure for a cell phone call from 30,000 feet isn't in place.
[02:11:43.491 --> 02:11:43.731]  And it's,
[02:11:44.178 --> 02:11:45.839]  You know, I have no idea what happened.
[02:11:45.839 --> 02:11:49.300]  It's neither here nor there, but I question it from like a scientific standpoint.
[02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:50.920]  Like, well, how did that happen?
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:58.402]  You know, so I start researching that and I start researching like capabilities in the Eastern Corridor, altitudes that cell phone signals will reach, etc, etc.
[02:11:58.402 --> 02:12:07.085]  And it like doesn't make sense, you know, and then there's all these cell phone or communications experts and technicians and, you know, electronics technicians that you can find online that are saying like,
[02:12:07.594 --> 02:12:12.599]  Hey, you know, it's neither here nor there, but I can tell you right now that no one made a cell phone call from 30,000 people.
[02:12:12.599 --> 02:12:19.345]  And it came out last year in FBI documents that the Solicitor General had never got a call from his wife and didn't talk to her.
[02:12:19.345 --> 02:12:20.306]  FBI admitted that.
[02:12:20.306 --> 02:12:22.508]  It came out two weeks ago.
[02:12:22.508 --> 02:12:27.112]  The ACLU sued and got the documents where Cheney ordered the commission not to look at the attacks.
[02:12:27.512 --> 02:12:28.334]  And it was a cover-up.
[02:12:28.334 --> 02:12:31.059]  We have six of the ten commissioners saying it's a criminal cover-up.
[02:12:31.059 --> 02:12:31.920]  John Farmer.
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:34.224]  But then we're not supposed to even ask questions as citizens.
[02:12:34.224 --> 02:12:34.625]  I know.
[02:12:34.625 --> 02:12:36.148]  We're supposed to sit down and shut up.
[02:12:36.148 --> 02:12:40.836]  Well, you know, you look at it, too, and you look at the evidence, and you look, oftentimes what happens is, with any crime scene is,
[02:12:41.394 --> 02:12:44.856]  You know, the first responders are the only ones that get any imagery.
[02:12:44.856 --> 02:12:46.737]  After that, it's completely closed off.
[02:12:46.737 --> 02:12:57.344]  So they made this, like, ridiculous, uh, airplane-shaped, uh, pit in the ground that had some smoldering embers, almost like they put some charcoal in there and ignited it, you know?
[02:12:57.344 --> 02:13:00.546]  And the official, sort of, FBI, and they handled it as a crime scene.
[02:13:00.546 --> 02:13:02.207]  So the FBI handled the site?
[02:13:02.207 --> 02:13:03.568]  The FAA shouldn't, is that right?
[02:13:03.568 --> 02:13:04.028]  Yes.
[02:13:04.028 --> 02:13:07.931]  So they made this really ridiculous-looking, airplane-shaped, uh, crater.
[02:13:08.359 --> 02:13:08.619]  That was
[02:13:29.131 --> 02:13:35.133]  The airplane came down in a straight dive, hit the ground, and the entire plane went under the ground.
[02:13:35.133 --> 02:13:36.653]  And they had a diagram they'd drawn.
[02:13:36.653 --> 02:13:41.155]  Meanwhile, separately, the state police said an eight-mile debris field, engines five miles away.
[02:13:41.155 --> 02:13:42.155]  I know, I know.
[02:13:42.155 --> 02:13:48.617]  Which indicates high altitude, you know, catastrophic failure at high altitude, which indicates a missile, obviously.
[02:13:48.617 --> 02:13:51.938]  You know, it's kind of like, it's the most ridiculous thing.
[02:13:51.938 --> 02:13:55.459]  And once again, you know, my friends instantly, you know, they're like, well, what do you think happened?
[02:13:55.459 --> 02:13:56.139]  What do you think this?
[02:13:56.139 --> 02:13:57.200]  What do you think that?
[02:13:57.200 --> 02:13:57.920]  And I'm like, you know, look,
[02:13:58.599 --> 02:13:59.480]  I don't know.
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:00.761]  I don't know why.
[02:14:00.761 --> 02:14:01.922]  I don't know how.
[02:14:01.922 --> 02:14:10.269]  I can tell you, though, that that aircraft didn't hit the ground in one piece because, obviously, you know, an engine isn't going to end up five miles away from a crash site.
[02:14:10.269 --> 02:14:21.098]  You can look at, you know, crash site after crash site after crash site that, you know, that's been investigated by the F.B.A., that's widely photographed, and when a plane, you know, breaks up at altitude, the debris flew, you know, Flight 111 over
[02:14:23.567 --> 02:14:25.608]  You know, in New Zealand.
[02:14:25.608 --> 02:14:26.408]  Lockerbie.
[02:14:26.408 --> 02:14:30.109]  No, no, that was 111 was the one in Nova Scotia.
[02:14:30.109 --> 02:14:30.749]  Nova Scotia.
[02:14:30.749 --> 02:14:32.430]  Yeah, that was... Well, we know debris fields.
[02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:37.972]  Even when they crash into mountains or fields, they're normally hundreds and hundreds of yards long.
[02:14:37.972 --> 02:14:38.572]  Absolutely.
[02:14:38.572 --> 02:14:40.493]  Contained, reasonably contained, right?
[02:14:40.493 --> 02:14:43.774]  But at altitude, the Lockerbie one, how big was the debris field there?
[02:14:43.774 --> 02:14:44.314]  Massive.
[02:14:44.314 --> 02:14:44.694]  Yes.
[02:14:44.694 --> 02:14:46.195]  High altitude, burst, etc.
[02:14:47.182 --> 02:14:49.724]  You know, it's one of those things where it's so insulting.
[02:14:49.724 --> 02:15:04.357]  You know, if you do, you know, if you have an open mind, you have an understanding of some of these things, which, you know, I'm interested in these things, and you do two hours of research with existing imagery, you know, it's ludicrous that you would try to be sold that line.
[02:15:04.357 --> 02:15:05.978]  Then you've got Building 7.
[02:15:05.978 --> 02:15:07.800]  Well, Building 7, I know you're an expert on.
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:11.103]  I don't know as much about it, but I have researched the Pentagon one quite a bit.
[02:15:11.636 --> 02:15:14.817]  And that's another one that's absolutely ludicrous.
[02:15:14.817 --> 02:15:17.258]  There's no engine holes and there's a 16-foot hole.
[02:15:17.258 --> 02:15:18.978]  There's a 16-foot hole, no engine holes.
[02:15:18.978 --> 02:15:25.300]  And if you know, you know, the structural integrity of an aircraft, once it's compromised, those things are made out of thin aluminum.
[02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:29.281]  They, you know, once it's compromised, those things will, you know, they'll crush so easily, right?
[02:15:29.281 --> 02:15:32.682]  But the engines are these masses, right, of titanium.
[02:15:32.682 --> 02:15:34.343]  They're heavy, heavy, heavy.
[02:15:34.343 --> 02:15:35.923]  They're not going to break up.
[02:15:35.923 --> 02:15:40.705]  You know, it's like if you see any imagery of car bombs in the Middle East, for example.
[02:15:41.101 --> 02:15:43.704]  You know, you have the entire car completely disintegrated, right?
[02:15:43.704 --> 02:15:45.946]  But there's always an engine block sitting there.
[02:15:45.946 --> 02:15:47.327]  That thing does not break up.
[02:15:47.327 --> 02:15:50.531]  You know, it's the one piece that, like, stays intact.
[02:15:50.531 --> 02:15:54.675]  So, you know, when you see, even on the debris field in Flight 93, right?
[02:15:54.675 --> 02:15:56.117]  The debris field's 8 miles wide.
[02:15:56.117 --> 02:15:57.458]  There's an engine 5 miles away.
[02:15:57.458 --> 02:15:59.400]  The photographs of the engine are the engine.
[02:15:59.780 --> 02:16:03.122]  And then later, after hours of fire, part of the roof caves in.
[02:16:16.348 --> 02:16:16.608]  Exactly.
[02:16:16.608 --> 02:16:18.290]  And they try to show that on the news.
[02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:25.996]  We have hundreds of these big high-def photos that the government even took, and it's a smoking hole that looks like a perfect missile blast, and everybody smelled cordite.
[02:16:25.996 --> 02:16:32.421]  Then they release some blurry image six years after that doesn't even show anything and say, there's the plane.
[02:16:32.421 --> 02:16:32.681]  Exactly.
[02:16:32.681 --> 02:16:34.423]  Meanwhile, they had hundreds of high-def cameras.
[02:16:34.423 --> 02:16:35.243]  They won't release those.
[02:16:35.243 --> 02:16:36.364]  Right, of course.
[02:16:36.364 --> 02:16:38.466]  And the one image that they do release
[02:16:39.016 --> 02:16:43.180]  If you lay a 757 over the size of that image, it's dwarfed.
[02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:51.006]  You know, it's a small, it's a small, it has a small profile, small signature, and a 757 would dwarf that thing and make a bigger hole and the wings and the engines.
[02:16:51.006 --> 02:16:52.447]  It's, it's like ludicrous.
[02:16:52.447 --> 02:16:59.073]  And the fact that it, you know, happened to hit the, you know, mainly unoccupied section of the Pentagon, right?
[02:16:59.073 --> 02:17:00.514]  It was under construction.
[02:17:00.514 --> 02:17:01.875]  Why do they think we're so dumb?
[02:17:01.875 --> 02:17:02.376]  I don't know.
[02:17:02.376 --> 02:17:02.816]  I don't know.
[02:17:02.816 --> 02:17:06.379]  And you know, the other thing too, is I know a lot of pilots, I've flown quite a bit in my life.
[02:17:07.054 --> 02:17:15.136]  Um, the idea that, you know, setting up an approach to hit a runway starts 20 or 30 or 50 miles away from the runway.
[02:17:15.136 --> 02:17:22.398]  As you get into your approach, you set it up and you go into like a controlled descent and basically fly the aircraft right to the ground, right?
[02:17:22.398 --> 02:17:27.980]  So the idea that these guys and you know, it's precision, it's precision to hit a runway, it's precision to hit the end of runway.
[02:17:28.712 --> 02:17:46.680]  And so you and so what you do is you you you take these guys that supposedly like took some classes on how to steer an aircraft and you're trying to sell me the idea that they were able to hit the Pentagon precisely put it into it put it into a controlled descent get into ground effect and
[02:17:47.284 --> 02:17:47.604]  You think so?
[02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:11.603]  Only the best pilots can set them down smooth, but still they have to time it just right.
[02:18:11.603 --> 02:18:14.044]  And that's why a runway is 9,000 feet.
[02:18:14.044 --> 02:18:15.284]  And the plane comes in like this.
[02:18:15.284 --> 02:18:17.366]  It doesn't come in near them perfectly.
[02:18:17.366 --> 02:18:17.986]  It's ridiculous.
[02:18:17.986 --> 02:18:20.187]  So tell me about Building 7, because you know more about that.
[02:18:20.187 --> 02:18:21.428]  No, no, Dan, we've got you here.
[02:18:21.428 --> 02:18:26.050]  That's why I knew you'd be perfect for radio, because you and I were just, you know, really hit it off and we're talking.
[02:18:26.050 --> 02:18:27.431]  You said you had a lot of friends that were listeners.
[02:18:28.451 --> 02:18:30.272]  And I'm just honored to have you here.
[02:18:30.272 --> 02:18:39.255]  And I wanted to talk about some of the interesting stories with celebrities and politicians and also just get your view on the world and ask how you became such an awesome photographer.
[02:18:39.255 --> 02:18:40.475]  Started when I was a kid.
[02:18:40.475 --> 02:18:41.916]  My favorite thing to do.
[02:18:41.916 --> 02:18:47.698]  I think the thing I'm most grateful for in my life is that, you know, every day I get up and I do exactly what I love to do.
[02:18:47.698 --> 02:18:56.921]  And, you know, I think the majority of the people that are, you know, have an interest, have a hobby, you know, it's an after work and enterprise, you know, it can't be parlayed into a career.
[02:18:57.682 --> 02:18:58.303]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:18:58.303 --> 02:18:59.544]  I feel really fortunate about it.
[02:18:59.544 --> 02:19:04.888]  But also, on some level, I'm not really surprised by it, you know, because it was always my passion.
[02:19:04.888 --> 02:19:06.189]  It was always what I felt like I would do.
[02:19:06.189 --> 02:19:09.332]  If you follow your passion and do it because it's a passion, you're going to be successful.
[02:19:09.332 --> 02:19:09.972]  One hundred percent.
[02:19:09.972 --> 02:19:14.075]  Everybody else I've run into are trying to be famous or trying to be successful.
[02:19:14.075 --> 02:19:15.196]  If you just have passion.
[02:19:15.196 --> 02:19:16.658]  Exactly.
[02:19:16.658 --> 02:19:16.858]  Yeah.
[02:19:16.858 --> 02:19:19.540]  If you know, it's the way you're expressing your passion in the universe.
[02:19:19.540 --> 02:19:25.745]  Someone told me that said if the universe if you have something to give the universe, the universe will be the path to your door.
[02:19:26.243 --> 02:19:26.363]  And I
[02:19:48.246 --> 02:19:49.107]  I do a job.
[02:19:49.107 --> 02:19:53.310]  I'm really respectful and reverent of the fact that the client's trusting me.
[02:19:53.310 --> 02:19:55.811]  They're investing their money in me.
[02:19:55.811 --> 02:19:57.533]  And I knock it out of the park every time.
[02:19:57.533 --> 02:19:57.893]  You do.
[02:19:57.893 --> 02:19:58.633]  Dan Winters.
[02:19:58.633 --> 02:19:59.054]  Stay there.
[02:19:59.054 --> 02:20:00.735]  We're going to break back in just a few minutes.
[02:20:03.547 --> 02:20:04.767]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:04.767 --> 02:20:07.268]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:20:07.268 --> 02:20:09.169]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.

[02:20:40.139 --> 02:20:40.840]  But listen up.

[02:22:01.178 --> 02:22:06.141]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:22:06.141 --> 02:22:07.122]  What have we got?
[02:22:07.122 --> 02:22:09.583]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:22:09.583 --> 02:22:10.604]  A republic.
[02:22:10.604 --> 02:22:13.246]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:22:13.246 --> 02:22:15.507]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:22:15.507 --> 02:22:17.528]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:22:17.528 --> 02:22:19.209]  So they think they own our land?
[02:22:19.209 --> 02:22:20.530]  They think they own our water?
[02:22:20.530 --> 02:22:21.130]  Children?
[02:22:21.130 --> 02:22:22.251]  Our education?
[02:22:22.251 --> 02:22:23.092]  Our money?
[02:22:23.092 --> 02:22:26.754]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:22:27.094 --> 02:22:30.799]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:22:30.799 --> 02:22:32.061]  You have been warned.
[02:22:32.061 --> 02:22:33.102]  We have the facts.
[02:22:33.102 --> 02:22:34.264]  We have the Constitution.
[02:22:34.264 --> 02:22:35.165]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:22:35.165 --> 02:22:36.046]  We have common law.
[02:22:36.046 --> 02:22:38.570]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:38.570 --> 02:22:42.355]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.

[02:23:14.974 --> 02:23:18.936]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[02:23:18.936 --> 02:23:22.898]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[02:23:23.278 --> 02:23:27.864]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.

[02:23:47.899 --> 02:23:51.020]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:08.991 --> 02:24:11.613]  Well, one of the top photographers in the world.
[02:24:11.613 --> 02:24:13.555]  I mean, I've looked him up.
[02:24:13.555 --> 02:24:15.537]  Some say the top photographer in the world.
[02:24:15.537 --> 02:24:18.019]  I mean, there's no one more prolific.
[02:24:18.019 --> 02:24:18.719]  And we're honored to have him.
[02:24:18.719 --> 02:24:23.864]  We're going to be scrolling through some of the politicians, movie stars, you name it.
[02:24:23.864 --> 02:24:28.067]  Religious leaders that he has photographed for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:24:28.067 --> 02:24:31.610]  Or you can go to danwintersphoto.com to see a lot more.
[02:24:31.610 --> 02:24:35.694]  Because he has computers in his office and I'd be seeing photos of Schwarzenegger and photos of
[02:24:36.249 --> 02:24:36.669]  I don't
[02:24:51.055 --> 02:24:52.796]  Kind of an idiot savant.
[02:24:52.796 --> 02:24:55.398]  I'm not saying you're an idiot, but you know what I mean.
[02:24:55.398 --> 02:24:57.660]  I think of myself with political stuff sometimes.
[02:24:57.660 --> 02:24:59.461]  You just know you have that talent.
[02:24:59.461 --> 02:25:03.024]  But going back to the term conspiracy theorist, you're right.
[02:25:03.024 --> 02:25:08.548]  It's just a label they throw on people to say, oh, this information can't be looked at.
[02:25:08.548 --> 02:25:13.952]  This information, it's a way to downgrade it, when really just questioning the system
[02:25:14.612 --> 02:25:16.252]  Is what any free human is supposed to do.
[02:25:16.252 --> 02:25:18.173]  I mean, here's the Globe and Mail today.
[02:25:18.173 --> 02:25:21.273]  The dangerously unbalanced world of global governance.
[02:25:21.273 --> 02:25:23.254]  They're admitting world government's being established.
[02:25:23.254 --> 02:25:24.554]  It's run by the banks.
[02:25:24.554 --> 02:25:28.655]  But then they say you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't want to be a slave of banks.
[02:25:28.655 --> 02:25:29.375]  Exactly.
[02:25:29.375 --> 02:25:42.058]  And I'm sure you've probably used the quote on your show, probably on more than one occasion, but there's that great quote by Goering from the Nuremberg Trials that says, you know, the normal people don't want war.
[02:25:42.557 --> 02:25:45.519]  But after all, it's not the normal people that are making the policy.
[02:25:45.519 --> 02:25:48.541]  You know, it's the politicians that are making the policy.
[02:25:48.541 --> 02:25:50.703]  And it's very easy to bring the normal people along.
[02:25:50.703 --> 02:25:57.528]  All you have to do is convince them that they're being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism.
[02:25:57.528 --> 02:25:58.929]  It works every time.
[02:25:58.929 --> 02:26:00.130]  And that is so true.
[02:26:00.130 --> 02:26:08.256]  You know, the whole idea of like questioning anything, I mean, even the fact that, you know, how contrived the term Patriot Act was, you know, so it implies that if you like
[02:26:08.692 --> 02:26:11.534]  If you resisted at all that, oh man, you're not patriotic.
[02:26:11.534 --> 02:26:16.096]  Or the New Freedom Initiative to put half of America's kids on psychotropic drugs.
[02:26:16.096 --> 02:26:17.037]  That's a new freedom!
[02:26:17.037 --> 02:26:18.558]  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[02:26:18.558 --> 02:26:25.602]  What about the, I mean, talk locally, you know, what about the police chief in Austin with the mandatory, you know, if you refuse breathalyzer
[02:26:26.149 --> 02:26:26.670]  I don't know.
[02:26:40.111 --> 02:26:40.251]  It's
[02:26:59.176 --> 02:27:00.758]  Take blood out of someone's body?
[02:27:15.047 --> 02:27:44.450]  I did a really interesting piece, and I wish I had actually given you the photograph, but I was hired by a magazine to, actually Esquire, and they were doing a piece on FAA and the TSA people and the way they screen, and the guy that was the head of the program within the FAA to test screening, and he was an ex-Navy SEAL, and his job, he had a small group of individuals, and their job was to
[02:27:44.966 --> 02:27:46.347]  Breach airport security.
[02:27:46.347 --> 02:27:48.628]  And so what they would do is they'd look for patterns.
[02:27:48.628 --> 02:27:50.089]  They'd go into airport, they'd look for patterns.
[02:27:50.089 --> 02:27:54.511]  They'd do exactly what you would do if you were trying to breach airport security.
[02:27:54.511 --> 02:27:59.593]  You would educate yourself on what it was, on their methods, on their means, and then you would do it, right?
[02:27:59.593 --> 02:28:07.397]  So the whole idea of like the TSA screening and stuff, while I agree there should be some kind of, you know, checks and balances for people getting on an airplane, it's such a band-aid.
[02:28:07.397 --> 02:28:11.759]  When we go on jobs, we carry on, you know, $25,000 worth of cameras and we carry them on.
[02:28:13.616 --> 02:28:13.716]  It's
[02:28:36.451 --> 02:28:37.552]  Privacy violated.
[02:28:37.552 --> 02:28:38.192]  Space violated.
[02:28:38.192 --> 02:28:38.912]  Yes.
[02:28:38.912 --> 02:28:39.773]  Exactly.
[02:28:39.773 --> 02:28:41.794]  So, get back to that Esquire story.
[02:28:41.794 --> 02:28:56.182]  So, the guy who's writing or the guy that's being focused on is the guy that's the head of this, you know, sort of like rogue entity within the TSA slash FAA whose job is to violate or breach airport security.
[02:28:56.182 --> 02:28:59.904]  So, you know, what they do is they look for patterns and he came up with this whole method at Kennedy.
[02:28:59.904 --> 02:29:04.946]  He said, look, you know, there's like three flights to the Middle East at like four o'clock in the afternoon out of Kennedy.
[02:29:04.946 --> 02:29:05.887]  And he said, we've
[02:29:06.297 --> 02:29:10.239]  Watch very closely the way TSA goes through stuff and they basically don't even look at anything.
[02:29:10.239 --> 02:29:10.900]  This stuff's going on.
[02:29:10.900 --> 02:29:12.541]  So he said that would be a prime target.
[02:29:12.541 --> 02:29:14.082]  So they make a bomb looking device.
[02:29:14.082 --> 02:29:16.163]  They put it in a bag and it gets through.
[02:29:16.163 --> 02:29:16.863]  So he was doing this.
[02:29:16.863 --> 02:29:24.108]  So my assignment for the magazine was, okay, why don't you, what we need you to do is we need you to figure out how to take down an aircraft.
[02:29:24.108 --> 02:29:25.108]  So I said, okay.
[02:29:25.108 --> 02:29:29.090]  So once again, I go online, I spend maybe six, seven hours researching it.
[02:29:29.090 --> 02:29:32.052]  I figure out what kind of explosive to make, how you can make it.
[02:29:32.052 --> 02:29:34.974]  It's not detectable by any of the carbon based,
[02:29:35.410 --> 02:29:38.252]  testing methods that the TSA uses.
[02:29:38.252 --> 02:29:47.237]  Dan Winters got a break that was a short segment long segment coming up let's finish that story when we get back then we'll get into some of the more interesting things you've seen in your life traveling the world.

[02:33:16.791 --> 02:33:19.914]  And we're going to get into some other important issues with him while we're scrolling.

[02:33:27.881 --> 02:33:29.602]  Charlie Sheen quits Two and a Half Men.
[02:33:29.602 --> 02:33:35.047]  And I don't normally get into entertainment news, but this is not really stemming from
[02:33:35.868 --> 02:33:37.188]  The problems he's had.
[02:33:37.188 --> 02:33:40.349]  A good friend of mine, 9-11 truther, really smart guy, great guy.
[02:33:40.349 --> 02:33:42.549]  I can just tell you all the stuff you've heard in the news.
[02:33:42.549 --> 02:33:45.550]  It's made up or exaggerated.
[02:33:45.550 --> 02:33:53.512]  And his enemies will declare victory, but a year ago he told me he wanted this to be his last season.
[02:33:53.512 --> 02:34:02.233]  And just a few months ago he told me, before the thing happened on Christmas Day, that he probably wasn't going to re-up his TV show.
[02:34:02.233 --> 02:34:03.714]  But here's the New York Post.
[02:34:03.714 --> 02:34:04.214]  Troubled.
[02:34:04.214 --> 02:34:05.414]  Charlie Sheen says he's leaving.
[02:34:06.306 --> 02:34:08.146]  CBS TV show Two and a Half Men.
[02:34:08.146 --> 02:34:16.448]  At the end of the season, Sheen, who returned to a men's set last month after a stint in rehab, will call it quits after taping his final episode April 9th.
[02:34:16.448 --> 02:34:17.568]  See, that's not even true.
[02:34:17.568 --> 02:34:18.068]  I know Charlie.
[02:34:18.068 --> 02:34:22.429]  He wasn't drinking, wasn't using drugs, drinks way too much coffee, and smokes Marlboro Reds.
[02:34:22.429 --> 02:34:24.390]  So I spent a lot of time with him.
[02:34:24.390 --> 02:34:32.572]  But he went to a, basically a spa, so that under the stress, he wouldn't go back on alcohol or drugs that he'd been off of for years.
[02:34:32.572 --> 02:34:34.792]  So that's a lie here from his enemy, the New York Post.
[02:34:35.775 --> 02:34:42.001]  But his spokesman, Stan Rosenthal, did not deny the report.
[02:34:42.001 --> 02:34:45.725]  Charlie's deal is only through this current season, he told People.
[02:34:45.725 --> 02:34:47.987]  So there's the inside scoop here, folks.
[02:34:47.987 --> 02:34:53.212]  Charlie quit because he wants to spend time with his family and is sick of eight-plus seasons.
[02:34:53.212 --> 02:34:58.637]  And the New York Post and others are spinning this like it's a problem with his wife, Brooke.
[02:34:58.985 --> 02:35:01.287]  He's a nice person, like that's why he's quitting.
[02:35:01.287 --> 02:35:04.008]  That may have been the cherry on top, but there's that info.
[02:35:04.008 --> 02:35:07.311]  Dan, I apologize for digressing off into fluff, but Charlie's my friend.
[02:35:07.311 --> 02:35:09.432]  I wanted to back him up and set the record straight.
[02:35:09.432 --> 02:35:10.413]  Yeah, I don't think it's fluff.
[02:35:10.413 --> 02:35:12.134]  He's done some good work, I think.
[02:35:12.134 --> 02:35:26.103]  Well, you know, everybody's human, and people love to see somebody big in trouble, and even when Limbaugh got caught in stuff worse than what Sheen's involved in, I wasn't cheering his downfall, even though I disagree with him passionately, because I just don't...
[02:35:27.170 --> 02:35:29.370]  I only cheer for real tyrants going down.
[02:35:29.370 --> 02:35:31.731]  You know, people like Hitler or Stalin or Mao.
[02:35:31.731 --> 02:35:33.031]  I agree totally.
[02:35:33.031 --> 02:35:34.672]  And I think you're absolutely right about that.
[02:35:34.672 --> 02:35:39.773]  I think we love watching people ascend the ladder, but we like watching the ladder fall over much better.
[02:35:39.773 --> 02:35:53.595]  And it's, you know, what I think it is, is I think that, you know, the media and the way the media works and the way publishing works, etc., and I'm a part of it, so I mean, I'd be one, you know, I should be pointing the finger back at myself, but the idea is to create a lure.
[02:35:53.595 --> 02:35:55.976]  To create a lure so that someone feels larger than life.
[02:35:56.892 --> 02:36:07.756]  You know, we talk about why film and why celebrities, specifically like actors and film, why, for some reason, it is such a part of our collective consciousness.
[02:36:07.756 --> 02:36:09.517]  And I think it's for that very reason.
[02:36:09.517 --> 02:36:16.240]  You know, I can go see I can go see The Hurt Locker and you can go see The Hurt Locker completely separately.
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:20.881]  But we have a we have a an experience that provides connectivity.
[02:36:20.881 --> 02:36:24.803]  And so you and I both now are connected through seeing that film.
[02:36:25.236 --> 02:36:27.718]  We can talk about it, we can talk about the issues around it, etc.
[02:36:27.718 --> 02:36:28.860]  So I think that's one reason.
[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:35.025]  And, you know, it stems... And I think it's sick wanting to see somebody fall when this happens to our own families and neighbors.
[02:36:35.025 --> 02:36:35.646]  This is sick.
[02:36:35.646 --> 02:36:41.432]  This shows a sickness, and I see it getting progressively worse, that people love to see somebody in trouble.
[02:36:41.432 --> 02:36:42.873]  But, but, but... I interrupted you.
[02:36:42.873 --> 02:36:43.354]  Go ahead.
[02:36:43.354 --> 02:36:49.900]  Well, I think, to get to what you're saying right now, too, I think that, you know, I think that when someone gets really angry
[02:36:50.487 --> 02:37:04.134]  At someone who's suffering rather than look at it from love and detachment and with compassion I think it says something about the individual, you know, that's that's throwing the stones, you know He he who is without sin may he cast the first stone.
[02:37:04.134 --> 02:37:06.215]  I mean to do a biblical quote.
[02:37:06.215 --> 02:37:09.577]  It's absolutely spot-on You know, we are all we're all fallible.
[02:37:09.577 --> 02:37:10.437]  We're all failed.
[02:37:10.437 --> 02:37:13.839]  We all have our own problems I realized several years ago that you know
[02:37:14.349 --> 02:37:17.633]  The one thing that we all have in common is that we all have problems.
[02:37:17.633 --> 02:37:18.014]  Period.
[02:37:18.014 --> 02:37:18.895]  We all have problems.
[02:37:18.895 --> 02:37:22.299]  And I think our role in life is to try to work through those problems.
[02:37:22.299 --> 02:37:23.741]  And that's the human condition.
[02:37:23.741 --> 02:37:23.761]  100%.
[02:37:23.761 --> 02:37:24.381]  So yeah, it is.
[02:37:24.381 --> 02:37:31.150]  Yeah, I only want to bring down people that are hurting masses of innocents and who are consciously
[02:37:31.850 --> 02:37:38.575]  Setting people up, consciously hurting others, consciously launching wars, torturing people, betraying.
[02:37:38.575 --> 02:37:40.637]  That's why I hate these politicians.
[02:37:40.637 --> 02:37:51.625]  Bush, of course, and Obama expanding wars, wiretapping, continuing the torture, continuing the arrest, and watching him use all of his hope that people had put into him against them.
[02:37:51.625 --> 02:37:53.626]  And again, I don't personally hate Obama.
[02:37:53.626 --> 02:37:56.308]  I know he's a puppet who they plan to destroy.
[02:37:56.308 --> 02:38:00.712]  It's just that I realize that the institution itself is just
[02:38:01.201 --> 02:38:01.982]  So ruthless.
[02:38:01.982 --> 02:38:03.002]  Yeah, the institution.
[02:38:03.002 --> 02:38:04.003]  And I think that's a good point.
[02:38:04.003 --> 02:38:06.404]  I worked with him.
[02:38:06.404 --> 02:38:09.186]  You know, he seemed like one of those guys you'd want to go out and have a beer with.
[02:38:09.186 --> 02:38:10.867]  He seemed like a totally cool guy.
[02:38:10.867 --> 02:38:17.752]  I believe truthfully that when he was campaigning, he has a lot of, you know, ethos that he adheres to that he really believes in.
[02:38:17.752 --> 02:38:24.056]  But I think when you get in that office and the first day that you're briefed, you know, it's all bets are off.
[02:38:24.056 --> 02:38:27.358]  You know, I mean, the first day it was like we're closing Guantanamo.
[02:38:27.759 --> 02:38:30.941]  And I saw a photograph recently that was the most ironic photograph.
[02:38:30.941 --> 02:38:41.107]  It was a picture of one of the guards or one of the officials at Guantanamo hanging his photo up in the lobby when you come in.
[02:38:41.107 --> 02:38:48.952]  You know, it was the most ironic image considering, you know, if you've ever been to a military installation, when you walk in the main building, there's the chain of command.
[02:38:48.952 --> 02:38:55.736]  So, you know, you'd walk in a building during Bush's administration and Bush was in the middle, and then on either side there were photographs of the chain of command that goes down.
[02:38:56.198 --> 02:39:01.861]  So at Guantanamo, there's the chain of command and there's Obama, the photograph of Obama right in the middle.
[02:39:01.861 --> 02:39:08.424]  And you know, once again, you know, I mean, I truly believe like I wouldn't I wouldn't I won't weep when Kissinger drops.
[02:39:08.424 --> 02:39:10.325]  I won't weep when Rockefeller drops.
[02:39:10.325 --> 02:39:10.745]  I don't think
[02:39:11.397 --> 02:39:13.319]  You know, I don't think, honestly, anybody will.
[02:39:13.319 --> 02:39:16.101]  And that's really unfortunate, you know, that they've lived a life like that.
[02:39:16.101 --> 02:39:22.747]  But, you know, once again, you know, I try to view these things... Yeah, their human journey is just a tragic event of power and avarice.
[02:39:22.747 --> 02:39:24.028]  Now, I interrupted you with a break.
[02:39:24.028 --> 02:39:28.332]  Let's go back to that Esquire piece that you were talking about.
[02:39:28.332 --> 02:39:29.793]  Recap it and then tell us about it.
[02:39:29.793 --> 02:39:35.057]  Okay, the assignment, to get back to it, Esquire was doing a piece on airport security.
[02:39:35.057 --> 02:39:38.060]  And the idea of, you know, how difficult my assignment was
[02:39:38.561 --> 02:40:01.627]  Dan research and illustrate how difficult it would be to take down an airliner and in initially I thought well that's kind of an irresponsible job it's it's kind of irresponsible to illustrate that but then I thought about it I thought well it's actually more irresponsible not to illustrate how easy it is because anybody that wants to take down an airliner is gonna take down an airliner period you know they're gonna do it they're gonna do the research required and they're gonna figure it out
[02:40:02.239 --> 02:40:15.389]  So I started looking into it and I spent several hours on the internet and I came up with a formula for an explosive that was non-detectable by the screening that's used now, which is all carbon-based detection.
[02:40:15.389 --> 02:40:16.810]  This is a chemical element.
[02:40:16.810 --> 02:40:23.575]  It's got 80% of the destructive power or the explosive force of TNT and it can be made at your house.
[02:40:23.575 --> 02:40:25.136]  It can be carried.
[02:40:25.136 --> 02:40:27.118]  So the method I came up with is this.
[02:40:28.424 --> 02:40:39.131]  You know, you get three guys working together, and this is all based on the fact that these guys are going to off themselves, but there doesn't seem to be a shortage of guys that are willing to... And you're doing this drill to try to stop this from happening?
[02:40:39.131 --> 02:40:46.035]  Or to try to illustrate to people, like, hey, look how easy this is, you know, look how easy it would be to do this, you know, and it's almost like a wake-up call.
[02:40:46.035 --> 02:40:52.419]  It's like, oh my God, you know, like, you know, we think these guys are, you know, the security is such a band-aid, you know.
[02:40:52.847 --> 02:40:54.588]  You know, right after 9-11, what was it like?
[02:40:54.588 --> 02:40:58.690]  You couldn't walk two feet away from your bag without getting, like, scolded, right?
[02:40:58.690 --> 02:41:02.531]  Now, it's like, I'll leave my bag at the gate, ask someone to watch it, go to the bathroom, come back.
[02:41:02.531 --> 02:41:03.432]  It's like, no one's worried.
[02:41:03.432 --> 02:41:05.333]  There was National Guard in the airport when it happened.
[02:41:05.333 --> 02:41:07.614]  But we go back to the point that most of it's manufactured.
[02:41:07.614 --> 02:41:09.454]  Have you had time to see the underwear bombing?
[02:41:09.454 --> 02:41:10.515]  I totally agree.
[02:41:10.515 --> 02:41:13.756]  You know, it's... I mean, the State Department says they were ordered by a U.S.
[02:41:13.756 --> 02:41:16.137]  intelligence agency to help him get on the plane.
[02:41:16.137 --> 02:41:17.178]  Yeah, okay, so there you go.
[02:41:17.599 --> 02:41:18.561]  So it's the same thing.
[02:41:18.561 --> 02:41:20.707]  It's the whole idea of, like, you keep them in fear.
[02:41:20.707 --> 02:41:23.495]  You know, threat level orange, threat level yellow, threat level red.
[02:41:23.942 --> 02:41:27.663]  I laugh when I hear that stuff when I'm at the airport, because it reminds me of that Gurin quote.
[02:41:27.663 --> 02:41:29.384]  It's like, you know, keep them in fear.
[02:41:29.384 --> 02:41:31.064]  Keep them feeling like they're being repressed.
[02:41:31.064 --> 02:41:32.925]  Let me get back to the F-square thing.
[02:41:32.925 --> 02:41:35.526]  So I figure out the whole process to do this.
[02:41:35.526 --> 02:41:36.586]  You know, you get three guys.
[02:41:36.586 --> 02:41:39.987]  You have two guys carrying the explosive device in their groin.
[02:41:39.987 --> 02:41:47.609]  Once again, usually, and this might be changing, but usually, even with a pat down, they don't go right to that area, you know, so you can get that in.
[02:41:49.935 --> 02:41:56.319]  Then you take in a 9-volt battery, some wire, a couple flashlight bulbs.
[02:41:56.319 --> 02:41:57.379]  I used a timer.
[02:41:57.379 --> 02:42:03.183]  It was a timer off of a dog feeder, right, that I bought at, you know, Academy or something.
[02:42:03.183 --> 02:42:09.026]  And so I took all—the idea is you take all this stuff in independently, which is—it'd all be very easy to get in.
[02:42:09.026 --> 02:42:11.588]  The only thing I thought would be difficult was maybe some duct tape.
[02:42:11.588 --> 02:42:15.170]  So I thought, well, what you'd do is you'd line your entire bag with duct tape.
[02:42:15.683 --> 02:42:18.285]  And then you could get it in, and then you could pull the strips off and use it.
[02:42:18.285 --> 02:42:23.228]  But then you go into the little kiosk, you buy a couple bottles of Coke, and you all go to the men's room.
[02:42:23.228 --> 02:42:25.429]  One guy goes into the handicap stall.
[02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:31.133]  He spends about 15 minutes assembling the thing, getting it all ready to go, puts it on his bag, takes it into the plane.
[02:42:31.133 --> 02:42:34.555]  And then the research further was, well, okay, so he blows it up in the plane.
[02:42:34.555 --> 02:42:36.556]  It might compromise, you know, the hull.
[02:42:36.556 --> 02:42:38.817]  It might do this, it might do that, but it probably wouldn't take it down.
[02:42:38.817 --> 02:42:39.518]  So what you do then,
[02:42:40.427 --> 02:42:46.755]  Which is also another one of these ridiculous band-aids is that, you know, once 9-11 happened, they reinforced all the cockpit doors.
[02:42:46.755 --> 02:42:48.577]  You know, they made these Kevlar doors.
[02:42:48.577 --> 02:42:49.318]  You can't get in.
[02:42:49.318 --> 02:42:54.084]  But what they didn't do is they didn't reinforce the bulkhead behind the captain or the co-pilot.
[02:42:54.084 --> 02:42:55.826]  All they did is do a door.
[02:42:55.826 --> 02:42:59.891]  So 757 and a couple other aircrafts have a, in the first class cabin, they have a
[02:43:00.467 --> 02:43:04.530]  A bathroom that immediately backs up against the cockpit.
[02:43:04.530 --> 02:43:05.871]  So you go in there and you detonate it.
[02:43:05.871 --> 02:43:06.472]  And it's done.
[02:43:06.472 --> 02:43:09.494]  And, you know, this was, you know, six hours of research on my part.
[02:43:09.494 --> 02:43:13.898]  And so the idea is that it's incredibly simple to do this.
[02:43:13.898 --> 02:43:15.599]  How long ago did you do that for Esquire?
[02:43:15.599 --> 02:43:16.520]  It was like two years ago.
[02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:23.526]  And I wish I had brought that image with me because what I did is I did a still life of all of the elements that were required.
[02:43:23.526 --> 02:43:24.646]  What should we Google?
[02:43:24.646 --> 02:43:26.928]  Dan Winters, Esquire, how to bomb a plane?
[02:43:26.928 --> 02:43:27.389]  Let's see.
[02:43:27.389 --> 02:43:27.849]  Do that.
[02:43:27.849 --> 02:43:28.890]  It was Esquire or
[02:43:29.645 --> 02:43:30.285]  Best Life.
[02:43:30.285 --> 02:43:32.807]  I'm thinking after I said Esquire, I was thinking it might be Best Life.
[02:43:32.807 --> 02:43:37.829]  Do Dan Winter's Best Life bomb.
[02:43:37.829 --> 02:43:39.310]  Dan Winter's Best Life bomb.
[02:43:39.310 --> 02:43:40.310]  Did you guys have any luck?
[02:43:40.310 --> 02:43:48.034]  Because he wanted to also show people how fake the photo is with the newspaper and the rifle of Lee Harvey Oswald in the front yard where the shadows are all wrong.
[02:43:48.034 --> 02:43:49.695]  OK, we'll show that first.
[02:43:49.695 --> 02:43:51.035]  But we're running out of time here.
[02:43:51.035 --> 02:43:57.459]  I mean, I knew it'd be great to have you on the radio because you've got so much knowledge and we're so similar in so many ways in our perspectives.
[02:43:59.474 --> 02:44:09.076]  I mean, you were telling me stories, and I don't know if some of them are off-record or if you want to tell stories, but what are some interesting stories about movie stars or politicians or Rick Perry or whatever that you can tell?
[02:44:09.076 --> 02:44:11.077]  Okay, Rick Perry, the hair politician.
[02:44:11.077 --> 02:44:14.657]  The funniest story about Rick Perry, I photographed him twice.
[02:44:14.657 --> 02:44:18.558]  You know, he is the consummate, the consummate smooth guy.
[02:44:18.558 --> 02:44:24.680]  He comes in, you almost instantly have a nickname, he remembers your name, it's this whole politician thing.
[02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:26.020]  You know, and I've been to other politicians.
[02:44:26.901 --> 02:44:34.725]  A good friend of mine, Jack Valenti, who just passed recently, he told me, if you don't like Bush, don't spend 10 minutes in a room with him, because you'll love him.
[02:44:34.725 --> 02:44:37.487]  Because he's that kind of, you know, you instantly get a nickname.
[02:44:37.487 --> 02:44:41.309]  You instantly feel like he has that ability to make you feel special, you know.
[02:44:41.309 --> 02:44:44.190]  And, you know, I was offered twice to photograph him.
[02:44:44.190 --> 02:44:52.615]  Newsweek offered me a cover the day after the election, the initial election, when he was first voted president.
[02:44:52.615 --> 02:44:55.116]  And I turned it down because I just fundamentally like him.
[02:44:55.635 --> 02:44:58.118]  I fundamentally can't, like, photograph someone.
[02:45:04.757 --> 02:45:09.418]  When he does that laughing, it upsets me.
[02:45:09.418 --> 02:45:11.479]  He had me arrested one time for just asking him a question.
[02:45:11.479 --> 02:45:16.040]  I don't know if you've ever Googled, Alex Jones arrested for asking Governor a question at a press conference.
[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:18.901]  I asked him about the world government and they just drug me out and arrested me.
[02:45:18.901 --> 02:45:19.621]  Is that right?
[02:45:19.621 --> 02:45:25.002]  Well, I had a funny run in with Rick Perry at a bicycle sports shop.
[02:45:25.002 --> 02:45:32.664]  I went in there to get something and he was in there and he was in his bike outfit and he had his assistants with the big file of faxes and a couple of the Capitol Police with him.
[02:45:33.284 --> 02:45:35.166]  And so I heard him.
[02:45:35.166 --> 02:45:38.489]  I was in there and I was kind of listening and I heard him talking to his assistant.
[02:45:38.489 --> 02:45:40.812]  He said like, okay, I'm going to go for a bike ride from 10 to 12.
[02:45:40.812 --> 02:45:43.614]  Then I'm going to meet Bill for lunch.
[02:45:43.614 --> 02:45:45.616]  Then after that, I'm going to do this and go for a run.
[02:45:45.616 --> 02:45:47.098]  Then I'm going to go sweat, you know, this.
[02:45:47.098 --> 02:45:48.219]  And I'm listening to all this.
[02:45:48.943 --> 02:45:53.807]  And as soon as he finished it, I was standing right next to him and I said, uh, you planning on doing any governing today?
[02:45:53.807 --> 02:45:57.670]  Because it sounded like his day was full of recreation, you know?
[02:45:57.670 --> 02:46:08.899]  But, uh, yeah, these guys, you know, most of these guys, and I think the point you brought up about Bush's laugh, my experience with politicians is they don't really know what they're supposed to do.
[02:46:08.899 --> 02:46:11.381]  And so they have this kind of fake smile that they throw on.
[02:46:11.381 --> 02:46:14.063]  And it's, you know, I photographed Phil Graham one time and I,
[02:46:15.462 --> 02:46:21.424]  And I said, he kept doing this really bizarre smile and I was trying to get a shot that felt natural like we were talking about earlier.
[02:46:21.424 --> 02:46:30.948]  You were talking about the idea of how to kind of like capture the essence of someone, you know, when they're not taking direction and they're doing what they think a photograph is supposed to be.
[02:46:30.948 --> 02:46:38.050]  You know, I think a lot of people think like, oh, great photos of a sunset or something, you know, it's like super passe, but once again, a sunset inspires all of us.
[02:46:38.050 --> 02:46:43.152]  People look at a photo of the sunset and it takes them to that point, whatever, the most common sort of genre of photographs.
[02:46:43.152 --> 02:46:43.932]  But Phil Graham said,
[02:46:44.784 --> 02:46:47.106]  I said, yeah, um, maybe just relax your mouth.
[02:46:47.106 --> 02:46:48.166]  Maybe just do something serious.
[02:46:48.166 --> 02:46:50.728]  And he said, boy, I worked on this smile for a long time.
[02:46:50.728 --> 02:46:52.009]  I'm going to smile.
[02:46:52.009 --> 02:46:57.093]  So then it was the more painfully forced like smile you could possibly imagine.
[02:46:57.093 --> 02:46:58.794]  But I don't even know where we're at.
[02:46:58.794 --> 02:47:05.859]  I like to photograph like out in the country, old shot up washing machines and the way the bullets have gone through and the rust.
[02:47:05.859 --> 02:47:06.419]  Absolutely.
[02:47:06.419 --> 02:47:07.480]  That's the kind of stuff I like.
[02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:10.602]  Not that I'm, I mean, I, I just like photographs.
[02:47:11.314 --> 02:47:14.717]  You know, that are of an old barn or old woman.
[02:47:14.717 --> 02:47:16.059]  I love all of your photos.
[02:47:16.059 --> 02:47:17.760]  Great, thanks.
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:18.881]  Because it does.
[02:47:18.881 --> 02:47:22.805]  So I was accurate when I said that you somehow draw out the essence of people.
[02:47:22.805 --> 02:47:23.345]  I try to.
[02:47:23.345 --> 02:47:29.671]  And you know, I think to a certain extent it's like a, I've called it before, I've called it a manufactured intimacy.
[02:47:29.671 --> 02:47:36.318]  And I think the idea behind, you know, the range of human expression and human emotion is so wide.
[02:47:36.929 --> 02:47:37.209]  I think?
[02:47:55.097 --> 02:47:56.438]  You know, quiet oftentimes.
[02:47:56.438 --> 02:47:58.419]  It doesn't feel like it's, you know, manufactured.
[02:47:58.419 --> 02:48:00.841]  It doesn't feel like it's ingenuine, you know.
[02:48:00.841 --> 02:48:06.506]  It's capturing a moment of that individual, but I think it's a reflective moment, and I think people respond to reflective moments.
[02:48:06.506 --> 02:48:10.028]  Why did you choose this photo as the cover page when you opened the magazine up?
[02:48:10.028 --> 02:48:10.448]  I didn't.
[02:48:10.448 --> 02:48:11.289]  The magazine didn't.
[02:48:11.289 --> 02:48:24.499]  I would have hoped... What I was hoping is that the screaming photo was by itself with the... My dream would have been the screaming photo was by itself and the typography on one side, and then you turned to that photo.
[02:48:24.983 --> 02:48:27.746]  And then the last photo was the one in the set.
[02:48:27.746 --> 02:48:29.227]  You know, I had hoped for that.
[02:48:29.227 --> 02:48:30.208]  But I was really happy with it.
[02:48:30.208 --> 02:48:33.211]  So first show me in the screaming and then show the calm.
[02:48:33.211 --> 02:48:33.912]  Yeah, I like that.
[02:48:33.912 --> 02:48:35.313]  Yeah, just kind of jump back and forth.
[02:48:35.313 --> 02:48:38.436]  Because once again, and I really like this very flattering photo of you.
[02:48:38.436 --> 02:48:39.117]  Yeah, it is.
[02:48:39.117 --> 02:48:41.179]  You like that one?
[02:48:41.179 --> 02:48:42.180]  It's your new head shot.
[02:48:42.180 --> 02:48:42.541]  Exactly.
[02:48:42.541 --> 02:48:45.724]  Well, that's what I look like to myself when I'm looking in the mirror, you know, brushing my teeth.
[02:48:45.724 --> 02:48:47.445]  And then I'm not really photogenic.
[02:48:47.445 --> 02:48:47.926]  I mean, I'm not
[02:48:49.574 --> 02:48:53.735]  I'm not very narcissistic, but at the same time, you're looking at photos of yourself, it's like, that didn't really look like me.
[02:48:53.735 --> 02:48:55.455]  Of course, absolutely.
[02:48:55.455 --> 02:49:01.556]  But your photos, because I've met some of these famous people in person, the photos you take of people is what they really look like.
[02:49:01.556 --> 02:49:02.536]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:49:02.536 --> 02:49:08.778]  That's a challenge when you're shooting someone famous, by the way, because you've seen them represented in the media so many times.
[02:49:08.778 --> 02:49:12.858]  It's like, how do you make that quintessential image and still have it be a recognizable image?
[02:49:12.858 --> 02:49:16.379]  And what I try to do in my photographs, and I think to a large extent I'm successful,
[02:49:16.846 --> 02:49:19.489]  Is to try to create a timeless, iconic image.
[02:49:19.489 --> 02:49:24.654]  So that is not to use like fancy, tricky lighting stuff to keep it really simple.
[02:49:24.654 --> 02:49:25.074]  There he is.
[02:49:25.074 --> 02:49:27.277]  Let's quit looking at me now.
[02:49:27.277 --> 02:49:29.179]  In fact, we don't have much time.
[02:49:29.179 --> 02:49:32.122]  Run through some of the other photos at the end of that that we haven't seen of other people.
[02:49:32.122 --> 02:49:32.362]  Go ahead.
[02:49:32.902 --> 02:49:34.184]  Did we find the Lee Harvey Oswald photo yet?
[02:49:34.184 --> 02:49:35.766]  We're going to show that when we come back.
[02:49:35.766 --> 02:49:36.446]  Sorry, Dan, go ahead.
[02:49:36.446 --> 02:49:37.427]  All right, no problem.
[02:49:37.427 --> 02:49:39.109]  I'm in here directing while I'm on TV.
[02:49:39.109 --> 02:49:39.770]  Where are we at?
[02:49:39.770 --> 02:49:40.811]  Where are we at?
[02:49:40.811 --> 02:49:43.534]  Here, just continue the direction of the flow of the conversation.
[02:49:43.534 --> 02:49:53.245]  No, it's just you were saying, you were talking about how to... Oh, to create a genuine moment and still have it be an accurate representation of what that individual looks like.
[02:49:53.752 --> 02:50:03.066]  Because once again, you know, people that are really widely known in the news and stuff, it's very difficult to create an image that stands out and that's going to connect to you because you've seen so many of them.
[02:50:03.066 --> 02:50:08.094]  So the idea of trying to create, you know, try to heighten it to the point where it becomes iconic, I guess, ultimately.
[02:50:09.241 --> 02:50:09.501]  It's
[02:50:25.829 --> 02:50:26.630]  Absolutely.
[02:50:26.630 --> 02:50:27.590]  Alfred Eisenstadt.
[02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:30.993]  Joe Rosenthal with the flag-raising shot and Alfred Eisenstadt with the Times Square shot.
[02:50:55.909 --> 02:50:58.632]  A photo with a photographic expert and a lot more.
[02:50:58.632 --> 02:51:02.295]  He's Dan Winters.
[02:51:02.295 --> 02:51:06.038]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[02:51:06.038 --> 02:51:07.360]  Think again.
[02:51:07.360 --> 02:51:15.007]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[02:51:15.007 --> 02:51:21.933]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[02:51:22.233 --> 02:51:30.803]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.

[02:52:01.633 --> 02:52:03.956]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.956 --> 02:52:06.319]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:06.319 --> 02:52:09.544]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:09.544 --> 02:52:14.650]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.650 --> 02:52:18.856]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:19.156 --> 02:52:21.617]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.617 --> 02:52:24.398]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:24.398 --> 02:52:27.300]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:27.300 --> 02:52:34.903]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:35.242 --> 02:52:40.624]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.624 --> 02:52:43.484]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:43.484 --> 02:52:47.165]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:47.165 --> 02:52:48.246]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:48.246 --> 02:52:49.586]  You're everyone else.

[02:53:04.644 --> 02:53:06.305]  That's right, hair.

[02:53:09.508 --> 02:53:11.430]  The drain claw.

[02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:25.843]  Well, there's the famous setup photo of Photoshop from back in 1963 before they had photo shot of Lee Harvey Oswald as a photographer What is wrong with that photograph?
[02:54:25.843 --> 02:54:34.365]  Well, you know, there are a lot of things wrong with it the most obvious thing for me is that the light is coming from his left and
[02:54:35.244 --> 02:54:43.694]  From an angle and at a pretty low angle in the sky because you can see the shadow Coming back from his body at about 10 o'clock.
[02:54:43.694 --> 02:54:56.248]  So that would indicate a light source that's off his axis at about 5 o'clock and so that's inconsistent then with the lighting that's on his face the lighting that's on his face if you'll notice the shadow of
[02:54:56.636 --> 02:54:58.417]  Go straight down from his nose.
[02:54:58.417 --> 02:54:59.698]  12 o'clock.
[02:54:59.698 --> 02:55:01.179]  12 o'clock, overhead.
[02:55:01.179 --> 02:55:06.482]  His eyes, both eye sockets are dark, which indicates also an overhead light source.
[02:55:06.482 --> 02:55:09.303]  So it's clearly a photograph that was staged.
[02:55:09.303 --> 02:55:12.445]  The interesting thing about that is the entire house was cleaned out.
[02:55:12.925 --> 02:55:21.754]  The day of the assassination by the Dallas Police Department, completely, every single thing, every dish, every fork, every knife, every sheet, everything.
[02:55:21.754 --> 02:55:27.520]  And then two days later, suddenly, someone goes back to the house and supposedly finds the photo in the house and brings it in.
[02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:28.961]  So it's clearly a fake photo.
[02:55:28.961 --> 02:55:34.827]  And the thing about it is, back then, yeah, they didn't have Photoshop, but what they could do is work at an incredibly large scale.
[02:55:34.827 --> 02:55:35.668]  So they could have made a 20 by 24 print.
[02:55:37.060 --> 02:55:37.260]  Of course!
[02:55:47.048 --> 02:55:48.769]  Was three inches by three inches.
[02:55:48.769 --> 02:55:49.670]  So very difficult.
[02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:50.610]  All right, we don't have much time.
[02:55:50.610 --> 02:55:51.671]  I want to have you back sometime.
[02:55:51.671 --> 02:55:53.812]  No, no, no, I could have you for five hours.
[02:55:53.812 --> 02:55:58.155]  Shifting gears again, I don't want to get... I believe we do have a space program that went to the moon.
[02:55:58.155 --> 02:56:04.378]  I've talked to top astronauts, but they wanted to fake some photos for the public to not show the public what we really have.
[02:56:04.378 --> 02:56:06.419]  What do you think of those moon photos?
[02:56:06.419 --> 02:56:11.002]  Well, I think the most interesting thing about the moon photos is that there are some problems with them.
[02:56:11.002 --> 02:56:12.203]  There's some definite problems with them.
[02:56:12.203 --> 02:56:13.964]  You know, I've actually photographed
[02:56:14.404 --> 02:56:18.226]  Conrad Grissom and Harrison Schmitt.
[02:56:18.226 --> 02:56:21.168]  Harrison Schmitt was the last person that sat foot on the moon.
[02:56:21.168 --> 02:56:21.848]  Conrad, obviously.
[02:56:21.848 --> 02:56:22.548]  We've interviewed him.
[02:56:22.548 --> 02:56:23.309]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:56:23.309 --> 02:56:24.089]  Schmitt's amazing.
[02:56:24.089 --> 02:56:25.750]  Geologist.
[02:56:25.750 --> 02:56:34.254]  You know, and the thing about it is that the lighting is really inconsistent in those photographs based on, you know, the light source on the moon would be one singular source.
[02:56:34.254 --> 02:56:35.655]  It would be the sun only.
[02:56:35.655 --> 02:56:37.816]  So either you got light on you or you don't.
[02:56:37.816 --> 02:56:39.417]  So the shadows are all pure black.
[02:56:39.907 --> 02:56:42.608]  And the highlights are all pure white because they're illuminated.
[02:56:42.608 --> 02:56:53.050]  So the problem with, you know, the photograph of Aldrin coming down off the LEM, you know, that entire... It's backlit, and so the LEM should be black.
[02:56:53.050 --> 02:56:54.731]  It shouldn't be illuminated, but it's illuminated.
[02:56:54.731 --> 02:56:56.571]  But instead, there's angles everywhere of light.
[02:56:56.571 --> 02:56:58.952]  Yeah, there's multiple shadows, there's directional shadows.
[02:56:58.952 --> 02:57:03.993]  There was a great photograph that NASA had, or a film image that they had released
[02:57:04.437 --> 02:57:06.118]  Which they've since pulled.
[02:57:06.118 --> 02:57:10.401]  You know, I think it got in under the radar and some people got it and they questioned it and it got pulled.
[02:57:10.401 --> 02:57:12.362]  Of the flag on the moon blowing.
[02:57:12.362 --> 02:57:12.663]  Yes.
[02:57:12.663 --> 02:57:14.023]  You've seen that, okay.
[02:57:14.023 --> 02:57:18.246]  So as a top photographer who knows the whole science of it, this is suspicious.
[02:57:18.246 --> 02:57:25.811]  It's suspicious and you know I've looked in that and watched the documentary, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon, which there's a lot more stuff on there that's really inconsistent.
[02:57:25.811 --> 02:57:26.632]  It was almost part of the
[02:57:27.052 --> 02:57:30.116]  Same interest I had with the 9-11 stuff with the Pentagon.
[02:57:30.116 --> 02:57:31.578]  You know, something seemed weird.
[02:57:42.432 --> 02:57:48.858]  You know, it's almost like the Sistine Chapel where God's reaching down, but also he's old, he's wise, he's strong, but you said vulnerable.
[02:57:48.858 --> 02:57:52.981]  Yeah, I think there's a lot of vulnerability in that image, you know, especially in his eyes.
[02:57:52.981 --> 02:57:56.084]  You know, it looks like, to me, you know, that was a perfect photograph.
[02:57:56.084 --> 02:57:57.385]  That's my favorite that I've ever done.
[02:57:57.782 --> 02:58:02.125]  There are some of my son, actually, that would compete with that one for favorite photo.
[02:58:02.125 --> 02:58:04.346]  But, you know, he and I took a walk.
[02:58:04.346 --> 02:58:06.007]  I usually always have a camera with me.
[02:58:06.007 --> 02:58:11.551]  We took a walk out into his house in the high desert in California, and the light was absolutely stunning.
[02:58:11.551 --> 02:58:12.672]  There was a little breeze.
[02:58:12.672 --> 02:58:16.374]  It was one of those things where it's like, hey, can I do a portrait of you real quick, Dad?
[02:58:16.374 --> 02:58:21.017]  Yeah, you know, shot 10 frames, done, finished the walk, processed the film.
[02:58:22.115 --> 02:58:22.975]  Stunning, you know.
[02:58:22.975 --> 02:58:24.436]  You caught that magic moment.
[02:58:24.436 --> 02:58:24.696]  Perfect.
[02:58:24.696 --> 02:58:25.636]  I mean the hair blowing.
[02:58:25.636 --> 02:58:27.316]  For me, it was really the magic moment.

[02:58:51.069 --> 02:58:54.091]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.091 --> 02:58:59.413]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:59.413 --> 02:59:01.454]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:01.454 --> 02:59:06.457]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:06.457 --> 02:59:07.638]  How much do you want?
[02:59:07.638 --> 02:59:08.378]  When do you want it?
[02:59:08.758 --> 02:59:10.639]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:10.639 --> 02:59:11.719]  When will you need it?
[02:59:11.719 --> 02:59:13.921]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:13.921 --> 02:59:15.261]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:15.261 --> 02:59:16.782]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:16.782 --> 02:59:22.044]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.044 --> 02:59:25.186]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:25.626 --> 02:59:29.449]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:29.449 --> 02:59:30.690]  How much will you need?
[02:59:30.690 --> 02:59:31.590]  We don't know.
[02:59:31.590 --> 02:59:32.691]  How much do you want?
[02:59:32.691 --> 02:59:33.612]  All you can get.
[02:59:33.612 --> 02:59:34.713]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:34.713 --> 02:59:37.775]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:37.775 --> 02:59:39.556]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:39.556 --> 02:59:40.457]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:54.045 --> 02:59:55.992]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:55.992 --> 02:59:59.243]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:06.178 --> 03:00:11.004]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:11.004 --> 03:00:12.586]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.586 --> 03:00:14.167]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.167 --> 03:00:18.352]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.352 --> 03:00:22.397]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.708 --> 03:00:30.930]  To the second hour, we're going to simulcast the second, third, and fourth hour live at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:00:30.930 --> 03:00:36.791]  For PrisonPlanet.TV members, I want to say hi to all the great radio listeners out there.
[03:00:36.791 --> 03:00:47.714]  Well, for the full hour, Lies the Government Told You, Myth, Power, and Deception in American History, best-selling author Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, forward by Ron Paul.
[03:00:47.714 --> 03:00:53.096]  It's hardcover, a thick book, but a great quick read on a host of key issues.
[03:00:53.894 --> 03:00:55.436]  He really tells it like it is.
[03:00:55.436 --> 03:01:03.828]  He is the most hardcore constitutionalist who never waivers, who is on mainstream television in the United States.
[03:01:03.828 --> 03:01:04.489]  He's the best.
[03:01:04.489 --> 03:01:05.391]  Better than Lou Dobbs.
[03:01:06.525 --> 03:01:07.866]  Better than anybody out there.
[03:01:07.866 --> 03:01:09.006]  And we like Lou Dobbs here.
[03:01:09.006 --> 03:01:10.847]  We wish he was back on television.
[03:01:10.847 --> 03:01:15.089]  And so we're honored to have him with us to talk about the government takeover of healthcare.
[03:01:15.089 --> 03:01:19.451]  This other draconian legislation introduced by McCain to arrest U.S.
[03:01:19.451 --> 03:01:23.393]  citizens and, quote, interrogate them under military control.
[03:01:23.393 --> 03:01:25.254]  We're going to go over that.
[03:01:25.254 --> 03:01:28.255]  We're going to get into stories out of New Jersey, his home state.
[03:01:28.255 --> 03:01:32.477]  Cops in New Jersey town giving keys to homes as part of your safety.
[03:01:33.237 --> 03:01:37.679]  We have all these Brinks commercials running where it shows a thug busting into a woman's house and she calls 911.
[03:01:37.679 --> 03:01:40.341]  How about she shoots him?
[03:01:40.341 --> 03:01:48.105]  So we'll talk about the fight between freedom and liberty and the collectivist and the tyrants that are trying to take over our society.
[03:01:48.105 --> 03:01:51.666]  And Rush Limbaugh is talking about Obama might try to suspend elections.
[03:01:51.666 --> 03:01:57.950]  I mean, they're going to lose, so the only way they could try to get away with this is to suspend elections.
[03:01:57.950 --> 03:02:00.611]  They're trying to demonize the Tea Parties, the Patriots.
[03:02:01.343 --> 03:02:04.507]  No doubt they're staging many of these brick-through-the-window events.
[03:02:04.507 --> 03:02:06.329]  Democrats have been caught doing this before.
[03:02:06.329 --> 03:02:08.071]  There is a lot of anger out there.
[03:02:08.071 --> 03:02:09.793]  Violence is not the answer.
[03:02:09.793 --> 03:02:12.636]  Judge Napolitano, great to have you here with us.
[03:02:12.636 --> 03:02:13.797]  Alex, it's a pleasure.
[03:02:13.797 --> 03:02:15.359]  What a fabulous intro, man.
[03:02:15.359 --> 03:02:16.680]  I'm riveted listening to you.
[03:02:18.439 --> 03:02:19.840]  Well, we're riveted having you here.
[03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:23.981]  Okay, I could bring up a lot of subjects, but what's important to you right now?
[03:02:23.981 --> 03:02:26.302]  What's number one on your front burner?
[03:02:26.302 --> 03:02:31.363]  The loss of freedom at the hands of the government, which happens with every tick of the clock.
[03:02:31.363 --> 03:02:35.865]  I kiddingly say in the beginning of that book, which you were very kind to mention, Alex, that
[03:02:36.565 --> 03:02:45.472]  When I told friends I was writing a book about the government and lies and that it was 4,000 pages long, everybody laughed and said, were you able to get all the lies in the 4,000 pages?
[03:02:45.472 --> 03:02:48.095]  Of course, the publisher made me stop at 300 pages, but it shows you the...
[03:02:52.658 --> 03:03:16.734]  The perception that the public has is that the government does lie to us, has been lying to us, and we accept these lies and are willing to laugh about it, even though every one of those lies I talk about in the book, and even many that you just mentioned in the introduction, destroys our liberty, destroys our freedom, by inducing us to make political decisions on erroneous information that the government claims is true.
[03:03:16.734 --> 03:03:21.657]  And when we give up this liberty and lose this property, we don't get it back!
[03:03:23.243 --> 03:03:24.424]  Absolutely.
[03:03:24.424 --> 03:03:26.927]  When we come back, I want to get into the health care bill.
[03:03:26.927 --> 03:03:28.849]  I want to talk about what's next for these guys.
[03:03:28.849 --> 03:03:34.615]  The blanket amnesty, the national worker ID for citizens that illegals are exempt from.
[03:03:34.615 --> 03:03:35.856]  I've read the bill.
[03:03:35.856 --> 03:03:38.279]  It's the same thing in this bill, the health care bill.
[03:03:38.279 --> 03:03:44.866]  It talks about how we have to have an electronic medical ID card, but it says illegals are again exempt from that.
[03:03:46.850 --> 03:03:50.873]  No surprise that they would do something like that.
[03:03:50.873 --> 03:04:01.362]  In order, A, to control us, B, to know where we are and what we're doing, and C, to create a permanent underclass fully dependent upon them.
[03:04:01.362 --> 03:04:04.244]  The next thing you know is that they'll allow those folks to vote.
[03:04:04.244 --> 03:04:12.891]  And you know which way they'll vote, in favor of the party or the group or the candidate that gives them as big a piece of the pie to which we contribute at the point of a gun.
[03:04:14.528 --> 03:04:21.793]  Judge Andrew Napolitano, the new book, Lies the Government Told You in Hardcover, hitting bookstores everywhere.
[03:04:21.793 --> 03:04:23.093]  Get it at Amazon.com.
[03:04:23.093 --> 03:04:25.875]  We'll tell you about Judge Napolitano's websites as well.
[03:04:25.875 --> 03:04:26.796]  We're about to go to break.
[03:04:26.796 --> 03:04:28.237]  Long segment coming up.
[03:04:28.237 --> 03:04:30.518]  And we will go through the health care bill.
[03:04:30.518 --> 03:04:32.359]  We will talk about the Republican Party.
[03:04:32.359 --> 03:04:36.382]  I mean, is there any avenue there to try to repeal all this?
[03:04:36.382 --> 03:04:41.085]  We'll talk about the constitutionality with our constitutional law expert, Judge Napolitano.
[03:04:42.037 --> 03:04:43.338]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:04:43.338 --> 03:04:49.381]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:04:49.381 --> 03:04:54.364]  And don't forget, we also have Jesse Ventura's new book at InfoWars.com.
[03:04:54.364 --> 03:04:55.505]  You can get it there.
[03:04:55.505 --> 03:04:59.687]  American Conspiracy is already number four on the New York Times bestseller list.
[03:04:59.687 --> 03:05:00.308]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:00.948 --> 03:05:05.491]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:05:05.491 --> 03:05:06.412]  Number one.
[03:05:06.412 --> 03:05:09.834]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:09.834 --> 03:05:10.694]  Number two.
[03:05:10.694 --> 03:05:15.597]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:15.597 --> 03:05:16.338]  It's true.
[03:05:16.338 --> 03:05:20.881]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:21.201 --> 03:05:22.022]  Number 3.
[03:05:22.022 --> 03:05:25.604]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:05:25.604 --> 03:05:29.527]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:05:29.527 --> 03:05:30.327]  Number 4.
[03:05:30.327 --> 03:05:33.089]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:05:33.089 --> 03:05:36.432]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:36.752 --> 03:05:41.694]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:05:41.694 --> 03:05:46.756]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[03:07:00.464 --> 03:07:02.786]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:07:02.786 --> 03:07:05.168]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:07:05.168 --> 03:07:08.291]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:07:08.291 --> 03:07:13.496]  The Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:07:13.496 --> 03:07:18.020]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:07:18.020 --> 03:07:20.362]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:07:20.362 --> 03:07:22.904]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:07:22.904 --> 03:07:25.747]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:07:26.127 --> 03:07:33.745]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:07:34.082 --> 03:07:39.465]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:07:39.465 --> 03:07:42.327]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:07:42.327 --> 03:07:46.009]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:07:46.009 --> 03:07:47.090]  And I got news for you.
[03:07:47.090 --> 03:07:48.411]  You're everyone else.
[03:07:48.411 --> 03:07:49.912]  Invisible Empire.

[03:08:02.233 --> 03:08:11.341]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:11.341 --> 03:08:13.123]  We're back for the rest of the hour.
[03:08:13.123 --> 03:08:14.644]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is our guest.
[03:08:14.644 --> 03:08:20.830]  The new book, Lies the Government Told You, Midst Power and Deception in American History.
[03:08:20.830 --> 03:08:24.393]  Judge, I get up here every day and rant and rave and actually cover
[03:08:26.044 --> 03:08:33.828]  The laws, the subsections, the bills, I give people chapter and verse and still some call in and say, are you really telling the truth?
[03:08:33.828 --> 03:08:49.257]  Here's page 65 of the signed bill, and it's in section B.I., eligibility for health plan, and this is the actual section of the bill, and it says, may allow for the use of a machine-readable identification card,
[03:08:50.298 --> 03:08:57.574]  And they have another bill where they make citizens have a national ID card to have a job, but the illegals are exempt.
[03:08:57.574 --> 03:08:58.697]  And you have a...
[03:09:00.040 --> 03:09:06.502]  What, 8% approval rating for Reid, 10% for Pelosi, 11% for Congress.
[03:09:06.502 --> 03:09:10.983]  They know that 80% of the public is against this health care takeover.
[03:09:10.983 --> 03:09:12.744]  We know the insurance companies wrote it.
[03:09:12.744 --> 03:09:15.464]  It's actually a scam.
[03:09:15.464 --> 03:09:28.368]  The establishment knows what they're doing is unconstitutional and lawless, but they're going ahead with it and that's why Rush Limbaugh, and I agree with him, I'm glad he's really coming out now and telling it like it is, said that
[03:09:29.048 --> 03:09:36.652]  They may suspend elections because he says there's no way they can win and that it appears they're putting in a police state control grid.
[03:09:36.652 --> 03:09:41.174]  But as you know, this was all set up in the last 20, 30 years in this nation.
[03:09:41.174 --> 03:09:42.195]  It's bipartisan.
[03:09:42.195 --> 03:09:45.477]  Judge Napolitano, what is the state of our union?
[03:09:45.477 --> 03:09:49.879]  Well, the state of our union is that it is a bipartisan movement toward a police state.
[03:09:49.879 --> 03:09:51.820]  I mean, we don't have two parties in this country.
[03:09:52.296 --> 03:09:57.858]  Alex, even though most people think we do, your listeners know that we have one party, the big government party.
[03:09:57.858 --> 03:10:03.360]  There's a Republican wing that likes war and deficits and assaults our civil liberties.
[03:10:03.360 --> 03:10:08.762]  There's a Democratic wing that likes welfare and taxes and assaults our commercial liberties.
[03:10:08.762 --> 03:10:13.003]  But they basically will feed each other because they're not interested in freedom.
[03:10:13.003 --> 03:10:15.824]  They don't believe in fidelity to the Constitution.
[03:10:15.824 --> 03:10:17.305]  They're just interested in power.
[03:10:17.765 --> 03:10:30.997]  I mean, on my radio show last month, I asked the number three ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, Congressman Jim Clyburn, Congressman, where in the Constitution is the government authorized to regulate health care?
[03:10:30.997 --> 03:10:37.783]  And he said to me, Judge, most of what we do down here, referring to Washington, is not authorized by the Constitution.
[03:10:37.783 --> 03:10:42.067]  Where in the Constitution is it prohibited that we regulate health care?
[03:10:42.674 --> 03:10:52.520]  The very fact that he would ask that question shows a tremendous 180-degree misunderstanding of the federal government.
[03:10:52.520 --> 03:10:55.501]  The Congress is not a general legislature.
[03:10:55.501 --> 03:10:58.883]  It doesn't exist in order to right every wrong.
[03:10:58.883 --> 03:11:02.065]  It exists only to exercise power in 17 unique, discrete,
[03:11:03.746 --> 03:11:04.607]  We're good to go.
[03:11:17.745 --> 03:11:39.129]  Alex, if the government decides the extent of its own powers, if the government freely admits it violates its oath to uphold the Constitution, and if, whenever financial or civil liberties are involved, both sides of the government, Republican and Democrat, agree, the President signs a new Patriot Act
[03:11:39.449 --> 03:11:48.471]  And he signs it under cover of darkness because he's afraid those to whom he promised he wouldn't do so might see a picture of him doing it.
[03:11:48.471 --> 03:11:53.272]  The president, when he was a senator, blasted George W. Bush for conducting an illegal war.
[03:11:53.272 --> 03:12:02.554]  He's killed as many people as Bush ever did and is sending drones to Pakistan more so in one year than Bush did in eight.
[03:12:02.554 --> 03:12:08.676]  There is very little change that comes about via elections in this country.
[03:12:09.156 --> 03:12:30.833]  Unless and until people well there is very little change judge and Once they start violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution The sky's the limit as you know as a constitutional law scholar and as a judge But the general public is just now beginning to discover this what about last week when they were still trying to just deem and pass this whole thing without even
[03:12:31.493 --> 03:12:31.653]  Exactly.
[03:12:31.653 --> 03:12:35.618]  It shows us that they would cause to become law not only that which they haven't read,
[03:12:49.193 --> 03:12:56.538]  And we know they haven't read it because they made promises that their scriveners found out last night aren't in there, but that they haven't even voted on it.
[03:12:56.538 --> 03:12:58.939]  At least we shamed them into voting on it.
[03:12:58.939 --> 03:13:04.443]  At least we know that Bart Stupak is no more pro-life than Barack Obama.
[03:13:04.443 --> 03:13:13.289]  At least we know where people truly stand on all of this, because the uproar from people all across the political spectrum forced them to vote.
[03:13:13.289 --> 03:13:15.130]  How odd and quaint, Alex.
[03:13:15.748 --> 03:13:21.971]  That our representatives should actually vote on something, and that we should be able to know how they voted.
[03:13:21.971 --> 03:13:33.736]  You know, when the extension of the Patriot Act was enacted in the Senate, it was done by a voice vote, so that no senator was recorded as to how he or she voted on it.
[03:13:34.016 --> 03:13:51.313]  And when they changed the definition of the word financial institution to mean a doctor's office, a lawyer's office, the post office, a computer server, anything under the sun which would let them serve a self-written search warrant on it, that vote was taken by voice vote, so there's no record of how anybody voted on it.
[03:13:51.313 --> 03:13:55.938]  At least this time we have a record, so when we want to vote the bums out, we know who the bums are.
[03:13:56.989 --> 03:14:07.796]  And on top of that, we have bills in the last decade introduced to make them read the Bills Act, and they fight that tooth and nail.
[03:14:07.796 --> 03:14:14.821]  Do you know that Ron Paul introduces every year two simple four-line bills?
[03:14:14.821 --> 03:14:20.745]  Every member of Congress shall certify under oath that he or she has read a bill before voting for or against it.
[03:14:21.374 --> 03:14:27.699]  And every bill, this is the second one, that is introduced must cite in the Constitution the authority for the bill.
[03:14:27.699 --> 03:14:36.987]  Neither of those proposals, as simple, basic, and rational as could be, a junior in high school social studies could understand them.
[03:14:36.987 --> 03:14:39.089]  Neither of those has seen the light of day.
[03:14:39.089 --> 03:14:42.352]  Neither of them ever makes it to a committee for hearing.
[03:14:42.352 --> 03:14:43.713]  But there may be some hope.
[03:14:43.973 --> 03:14:46.914]  Judge Andrew Napolitano, as a constitutional expert, as a former judge,
[03:15:12.648 --> 03:15:20.070]  Reading over the bill and over the subsections, there's so many things that are unconstitutional.
[03:15:20.070 --> 03:15:21.530]  And then there's also deception.
[03:15:21.530 --> 03:15:30.853]  Even the AP admits this doesn't protect people with already existing conditions with children.
[03:15:30.853 --> 03:15:36.054]  That is the one that Mrs. Pelosi and company are stumbling over this morning, Alex.
[03:15:36.601 --> 03:15:47.492]  Because they promised Democrats and the Democrats promised their constituents that children with pre-existing conditions would be covered immediately.
[03:15:47.492 --> 03:15:52.897]  Now, put aside the fact that the federal government has no authority whatsoever.
[03:15:52.897 --> 03:15:54.459]  Take it to the bank.
[03:15:54.459 --> 03:15:56.241]  No authority whatsoever.
[03:15:56.761 --> 03:15:56.961]  Of course!
[03:16:14.068 --> 03:16:16.871]  Of course, because sooner or later you run out of other people's money.
[03:16:16.871 --> 03:16:20.375]  But in this particular case, they lied to their own people.
[03:16:20.375 --> 03:16:28.705]  The socialist monstrosity that they passed didn't even have in it the clauses that they used to sell it on the American people.
[03:16:29.005 --> 03:16:33.967]  One of which is this, your children will be taken care of from the minute the President signs it.
[03:16:33.967 --> 03:16:34.767]  Baloney!
[03:16:34.767 --> 03:16:36.888]  They didn't even read what they wrote.
[03:16:36.888 --> 03:16:38.768]  They didn't even write what they wrote.
[03:16:38.768 --> 03:16:41.149]  They just took passages and put it together.
[03:16:41.149 --> 03:16:50.392]  By the way, did you hear who praised the President's signing of this legislation just about 15 minutes before I was happy to come on your air?
[03:16:50.392 --> 03:16:51.793]  Let me guess, Fidel Castro.
[03:16:51.793 --> 03:16:55.674]  Fidel Castro praised Obamacare.
[03:16:55.674 --> 03:16:58.315]  That's an endorsement, if ever there was one.
[03:16:59.614 --> 03:17:04.501]  Well, the state is God under the New World Order system.
[03:17:04.501 --> 03:17:09.367]  Let's get into the unconstitutionality of this and how you would attack it.
[03:17:09.367 --> 03:17:13.553]  I don't think Attorney General suing or joining their suit is enough.
[03:17:13.553 --> 03:17:15.095]  We need to have states nullify
[03:17:15.755 --> 03:17:22.540]  Well, you know, it's one thing, Alex, for a state legislature and a governor to sign a piece of paper saying we stand on our Tenth Amendment and we are a sovereign state.
[03:17:45.715 --> 03:17:51.241]  It would be quite another for a state legislature to enact legislation that did the following.
[03:17:51.241 --> 03:17:55.765]  Prohibit state employees from enforcing federal law.
[03:17:55.765 --> 03:18:04.173]  Indict federal officials who come into the state with the intention of enforcing federal law that conflicts with state law.
[03:18:04.173 --> 03:18:06.135]  Impose a real estate tax on federal
[03:18:06.135 --> 03:18:06.935]  We're good to go.
[03:18:34.444 --> 03:18:37.006]  to their proclamation of sovereignty.
[03:18:37.006 --> 03:18:42.131]  Now, I would like to see the popular election of senators done away with.
[03:18:42.131 --> 03:18:54.021]  I would like to see state legislatures send members of the Senate to the Senate, because then they wouldn't be stealing power from the states, or those senators would soon be out of their jobs.
[03:18:54.021 --> 03:18:57.524]  The federal government didn't begin to grow to gargantuan proportions
[03:18:57.924 --> 03:18:58.344]  Very well said.
[03:18:58.344 --> 03:18:59.786]  Let's come back and talk about
[03:19:19.173 --> 03:19:39.453]  Constitutional ways to apply what you just discussed because if we do get the grand juries to start investigations and call for indictments, if we do get the states to pass laws saying our employees will not comply with this, that's all completely constitutional and other ideas, other solutions because there's a lot of people listening right now
[03:19:40.518 --> 03:19:43.620]  Folks are paying attention to these issues right now.
[03:19:43.620 --> 03:19:45.120]  Folks are angry.
[03:19:45.120 --> 03:19:52.684]  Now is the time to take what Judge Napolitano is saying, and I totally agree with him, and to put it into force.
[03:19:52.684 --> 03:19:53.764]  Now is the time.
[03:19:53.764 --> 03:20:00.007]  The Democrats have said they think you're going to forget about this and they can slowly implement it, and that's how they're going to domesticate us.
[03:20:00.007 --> 03:20:00.768]  We say no.
[03:20:03.280 --> 03:20:05.621]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[03:20:05.621 --> 03:20:11.844]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[03:21:14.659 --> 03:21:18.842]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:21:19.162 --> 03:21:21.524]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:21:21.524 --> 03:21:24.406]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:21:24.406 --> 03:21:27.308]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:21:27.308 --> 03:21:34.914]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:21:35.254 --> 03:21:40.635]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:21:40.635 --> 03:21:43.496]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:21:43.496 --> 03:21:47.177]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:21:47.177 --> 03:21:48.257]  And I got news for you.
[03:21:48.257 --> 03:21:49.598]  You're everyone else.
[03:21:49.598 --> 03:21:51.078]  Invisible Empire.

[03:22:01.616 --> 03:22:04.640]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:22:04.640 --> 03:22:09.966]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:22:09.966 --> 03:22:12.009]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:22:12.009 --> 03:22:17.015]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:22:17.015 --> 03:22:18.197]  How much do you want?
[03:22:18.197 --> 03:22:18.938]  When do you want it?
[03:22:19.318 --> 03:22:21.199]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:22:21.199 --> 03:22:22.280]  When will you need it?
[03:22:22.280 --> 03:22:24.481]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:22:24.481 --> 03:22:25.802]  Will there be any food?
[03:22:25.802 --> 03:22:27.343]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:22:27.343 --> 03:22:32.607]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:22:32.607 --> 03:22:35.729]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:22:36.189 --> 03:22:40.013]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:22:40.013 --> 03:22:41.234]  How much will you need?
[03:22:41.234 --> 03:22:42.135]  We don't know.
[03:22:42.135 --> 03:22:43.256]  How much do you want?
[03:22:43.256 --> 03:22:44.176]  All you can get.
[03:22:44.176 --> 03:22:45.277]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:22:45.277 --> 03:22:48.320]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:22:48.320 --> 03:22:50.102]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:22:50.102 --> 03:22:51.023]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:23:01.516 --> 03:23:03.397]  Don't answer it!
[03:23:03.397 --> 03:23:10.000]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.
[03:23:10.000 --> 03:23:12.981]  800-477-9256.
[03:23:12.981 --> 03:23:19.064]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[03:23:19.304 --> 03:23:23.586]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[03:23:23.586 --> 03:23:30.968]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed, without a payment plan, and without attorneys or going to court.

[03:23:47.054 --> 03:23:49.556]  Go to ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[03:23:49.556 --> 03:23:52.138]  That's ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[03:23:52.138 --> 03:23:53.879]  Or call now for free information.
[03:23:53.879 --> 03:23:54.059]  800-477-9256.
[03:23:54.059 --> 03:23:54.239]  That's 800-477-9256.
[03:24:04.344 --> 03:24:17.755]  My friends, if you've studied history and other empires, nations, republics, corruption grows slowly, like an infection, and then it blooms and the nation falls.
[03:24:17.755 --> 03:24:27.183]  And the elites that have become wealthy and powerful will use a police state to try to maintain control of the population that they've robbed.
[03:24:27.183 --> 03:24:32.268]  And we've seen a premeditated development of this police state in their internal documents,
[03:24:32.688 --> 03:24:34.349]  To suppress the American people.
[03:24:34.349 --> 03:24:36.351]  It's the same thing worldwide.
[03:24:36.351 --> 03:24:44.276]  And now you have these elites going offshore, forming a global government, openly saying a bank of the world that you will pay all your carbon taxes to.
[03:24:44.276 --> 03:24:50.541]  We're going to talk about that in the next segment with Judge Andrew Napolitano, author, best-selling author of multiple books.
[03:24:50.541 --> 03:24:51.281]  His new book is out.
[03:24:51.281 --> 03:24:54.343]  We'll tell you about the book and get into it before he leaves us.
[03:24:54.343 --> 03:24:57.626]  But getting back into solutions on this Obamacare, Judge.
[03:24:57.626 --> 03:24:57.966]  Right.
[03:24:58.346 --> 03:25:03.110]  Am I right in saying that this is pretty much the make it or break it issue?
[03:25:03.110 --> 03:25:10.036]  If we give in to this, and if we can't defeat this, then the sky's the limit for these tyrants.
[03:25:10.036 --> 03:25:11.037]  It is.
[03:25:11.037 --> 03:25:16.822]  And Vice President Biden admitted as much yesterday when he said if we hadn't have passed this, we would have been toothless.
[03:25:16.822 --> 03:25:20.285]  And now that we've passed this, we have a lot else that we need to do.
[03:25:21.893 --> 03:25:33.847]  We know that the next eight months is going to be a rush to legislation because they know, they're not stupid, they know that they will never have the majorities in the Congress after November, if there is a November election, that they have now.
[03:25:33.847 --> 03:25:37.912]  So they're going to try and regulate as much as they can in the next eight months.
[03:25:37.912 --> 03:25:40.335]  But think about how insidious this is.
[03:25:40.942 --> 03:25:52.470]  The Supreme Court has ruled countless times that the most private conversation you have, the one most utterly immune from governmental intrusion, is with your physician.
[03:25:52.470 --> 03:25:55.472]  More so than with your spouse, it's with your physician.
[03:25:55.472 --> 03:25:58.474]  This legislation purports with the stroke of a pen
[03:25:58.994 --> 03:26:16.507]  to do away with generations of that protection by putting a federal bureaucrat between you and your physician and permitting the bureaucrat to dictate to the physician what services are available to you and how much money is available for those services
[03:26:16.847 --> 03:26:20.449]  And it says they can share it with any federal agency they want.
[03:26:20.449 --> 03:26:24.072]  And it says that those decisions by the bureaucrat are not appealable.
[03:26:24.072 --> 03:26:30.076]  Everything under the sun that the government does, except the Supreme Court, because that's the last appeal, is appealable.
[03:26:30.076 --> 03:26:32.597]  But this legislation says it's not appealable.
[03:26:32.597 --> 03:26:34.799]  So they violate your right to privacy.
[03:26:34.799 --> 03:26:38.621]  They violate your right to talk to your physician without the government there.
[03:26:38.621 --> 03:26:41.643]  They violate your right to the privacy of your medical records.
[03:26:41.983 --> 03:26:47.907]  They decide how much money is available to pay your physician for the services that you may need.
[03:26:47.907 --> 03:26:51.590]  Is this the government that the framers gave us?
[03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:56.233]  Or is this, as you say, Alex, so nicely, the breaking point?
[03:26:56.233 --> 03:26:59.495]  Is this the point beyond which they cannot go?
[03:27:00.163 --> 03:27:02.744]  Now that leads us to the constitutional challenges.
[03:27:02.744 --> 03:27:14.029]  To me, the violation of privacy and the order that all Americans shall purchase something, whether they want it, need it, can afford it, already have it or not.
[03:27:14.029 --> 03:27:21.012]  Purchase something that the government approves of are the two most obvious unconstitutional aspects of this.
[03:27:21.403 --> 03:27:22.784]  There are many others.
[03:27:22.784 --> 03:27:30.288]  It's against the Constitution for the Congress to tell a state legislature how it must legislate and how it must spend.
[03:27:30.288 --> 03:27:33.429]  That's called commandeering the legislature.
[03:27:33.429 --> 03:27:37.752]  That's been prohibited for many years, but the Congress does it and gets away with it anyway.
[03:27:37.752 --> 03:27:38.632]  Hold on, hold on!
[03:27:38.632 --> 03:27:40.653]  That's another key point you just rattled off.
[03:27:42.354 --> 03:27:52.702]  And we've heard the state legislatures and governors and attorney generals talk about this, and it's in the bill, that it in some cases doubles the amount of money that states must levy to give to Medicare and Medicaid.
[03:27:52.702 --> 03:27:53.963]  Yes, it does.
[03:27:53.963 --> 03:27:54.504]  Yes, it does.
[03:27:54.504 --> 03:27:58.947]  Now, normally, when the Congress wants to control a state legislature, it bribes it.
[03:27:58.947 --> 03:28:03.530]  So, for example, did you ever wonder why speed limits are the same all around the country?
[03:28:03.530 --> 03:28:10.676]  Did you ever wonder why the blood alcohol content in a person's veins sufficient to charge them for drunk driving is the same in every state?
[03:28:11.036 --> 03:28:14.399]  Did all 50 states just magically adopt the same standards?
[03:28:14.399 --> 03:28:15.020]  No!
[03:28:15.020 --> 03:28:35.337]  The Congress adopted the standards, was told by its lawyers these standards wouldn't fly because the Constitution doesn't authorize the Congress to do this, so the Congress went to the states and said, here's hundreds of millions of dollars to repave your highways, but if you accept this money, you have to legislate about speed limits and blood alcohol content as we want.
[03:28:35.337 --> 03:28:36.178]  That's a bribe!
[03:28:36.818 --> 03:28:47.045]  If you or I, Alex, or anybody listening to us now, went to a state legislature and said, here's cash, now write the law the way I want it, we would be arrested, and rightly so, for attempted bribery.
[03:28:47.045 --> 03:28:52.328]  In this case, with this healthcare legislation, there is no bribe.
[03:28:52.328 --> 03:29:00.494]  There is an outright command from the Congress to the state legislatures, you shall license more physicians.
[03:29:00.914 --> 03:29:03.076]  You shall spend more money.
[03:29:03.076 --> 03:29:09.000]  When the Congress does that, that's called commandeering a state legislature.
[03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:14.864]  And the Supreme Court, in the past 15 years, has twice prohibited the Congress from doing that.
[03:29:14.864 --> 03:29:18.186]  So that's another unconstitutional aspect of this.
[03:29:18.186 --> 03:29:25.652]  It invades an area of state sovereignty, the regulation of the medical profession, reserved to the states.
[03:29:26.767 --> 03:29:39.413]  So we're right back to the Declaration of Independence, where they talk about unelected governors coming in and overriding the legislatures, commanding them, taxation without representation.
[03:29:39.413 --> 03:29:42.194]  The Democrats know this is all illegal.
[03:29:42.194 --> 03:29:46.396]  And I guess that's why Limbaugh and others are openly saying they may try martial law.
[03:29:46.396 --> 03:29:48.717]  Now they want to take over the Internet with cybersecurity.
[03:29:48.717 --> 03:29:50.558]  We'll talk about it all straight ahead.
[03:29:50.558 --> 03:29:52.018]  Stay with us.
[03:29:52.018 --> 03:29:53.419]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.419 --> 03:29:54.920]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.936 --> 03:30:01.819]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.819 --> 03:30:04.820]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:30:04.820 --> 03:30:10.162]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:30:10.162 --> 03:30:12.203]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:30:12.203 --> 03:30:17.205]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:30:17.205 --> 03:30:18.386]  How much do you want?
[03:30:18.386 --> 03:30:19.126]  When do you want it?
[03:30:19.506 --> 03:30:21.387]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:30:21.387 --> 03:30:22.468]  When will you need it?
[03:30:22.468 --> 03:30:24.669]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:30:24.669 --> 03:30:25.990]  Will there be any food?
[03:30:25.990 --> 03:30:27.531]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:30:27.531 --> 03:30:32.795]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:30:32.795 --> 03:30:35.917]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:30:36.377 --> 03:30:40.199]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:30:40.199 --> 03:30:41.419]  How much will you need?
[03:30:41.419 --> 03:30:42.320]  We don't know.
[03:30:42.320 --> 03:30:43.440]  How much do you want?
[03:30:43.440 --> 03:30:44.360]  All you can get.
[03:30:44.360 --> 03:30:45.461]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:45.461 --> 03:30:48.502]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:30:48.502 --> 03:30:50.283]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:30:50.283 --> 03:30:51.183]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:31:00.919 --> 03:31:05.903]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:31:05.903 --> 03:31:06.883]  What have we got?
[03:31:06.883 --> 03:31:09.345]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:31:09.345 --> 03:31:10.346]  A republic.
[03:31:10.346 --> 03:31:12.988]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:31:12.988 --> 03:31:15.270]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:31:15.270 --> 03:31:17.291]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:31:17.291 --> 03:31:18.972]  So they think they own our land?
[03:31:18.972 --> 03:31:20.273]  They think they own our water?
[03:31:20.273 --> 03:31:20.914]  Children?
[03:31:20.914 --> 03:31:22.015]  Our education?
[03:31:22.015 --> 03:31:22.835]  Our money?
[03:31:22.835 --> 03:31:26.498]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:31:26.858 --> 03:31:31.844]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:31:31.844 --> 03:31:32.865]  We have the facts.
[03:31:32.865 --> 03:31:34.006]  We have the Constitution.
[03:31:34.006 --> 03:31:34.928]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:31:34.928 --> 03:31:35.809]  We have common law.
[03:31:35.809 --> 03:31:38.332]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:31:38.332 --> 03:31:42.116]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:31:42.216 --> 03:31:47.161]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:31:47.161 --> 03:31:48.663]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:31:48.663 --> 03:31:49.764]  Don't tread on me.
[03:31:49.764 --> 03:31:56.631]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:32:01.926 --> 03:32:08.370]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[03:32:08.370 --> 03:32:13.653]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[03:32:13.653 --> 03:32:27.002]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[03:32:27.962 --> 03:32:32.985]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.

[03:33:09.701 --> 03:33:10.241]  We're good to go.
[03:33:30.365 --> 03:33:31.806]  That is our guest.
[03:33:31.806 --> 03:33:34.108]  Judge, you're right when you make the point.
[03:33:34.108 --> 03:33:35.330]  This is the mad rush.
[03:33:35.330 --> 03:33:44.037]  And now that they've already done something this unpopular and committed political suicide, Kerry's saying, hey, we got to go ahead and pass the carbon tax.
[03:33:44.037 --> 03:33:47.681]  We got to go ahead and pass blanket total amnesty.
[03:33:47.681 --> 03:33:55.608]  We've got to go ahead and pass cyber security, which even the Associated Press says allows Obama to completely shut the web off.
[03:33:56.088 --> 03:34:11.498]  If he so chooses, they want to pass the new Enemy Belligerence Act that says for any intelligence value or such other matters as the President considers, you may be secretly arrested and interrogated and held.
[03:34:11.498 --> 03:34:16.161]  I mean, they, and Lindsey Graham is arguing for similar legislation.
[03:34:16.161 --> 03:34:19.223]  Do you know how hideous that piece of legislation it is?
[03:34:19.223 --> 03:34:24.006]  It actually says the only way you can get out of military confinement
[03:34:24.447 --> 03:34:26.676]  And even appear before a judge, Alex.
[03:34:27.256 --> 03:34:31.958]  is if the House and Senate Intelligence Committees vote to let you out.
[03:34:31.958 --> 03:34:56.751]  What a perversion of our system of justice that instead of having judges say to the government, thou shalt not violate the right of any person, because the Constitution protects persons, not just good persons and not just Americans, but all persons, they would have themselves, politicians, assume the judicial role and decide who can get away from the waterboarding and into a federal prison instead.
[03:34:58.512 --> 03:35:05.214]  This is an orgy of power-grabbing by the executive and the legislative.
[03:35:05.214 --> 03:35:10.077]  And again, I hear all these neocons on radio and TV saying, oh, we don't want to let Al-Qaeda go.
[03:35:10.077 --> 03:35:15.619]  But the point is, we know that all of this is written and we have the Homeland Security internal documents.
[03:35:15.619 --> 03:35:22.442]  This whole thing is designed and pointed at returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[03:35:22.442 --> 03:35:24.262]  This is for the American people!
[03:35:26.003 --> 03:35:36.126]  The head of the Department of Homeland Security, Janet What's-Her-Name, announced that the most dangerous people on the planet were the groups you just indicated.
[03:35:36.126 --> 03:35:45.309]  Right-to-lifers, people who believe in the Second Amendment, returning veterans from the wars, people who think taxes are too high and the government is too onerous.
[03:35:45.309 --> 03:35:47.490]  I got in an argument on air with one of my
[03:35:48.090 --> 03:36:00.076]  Uh, Fox colleagues, who said to me, well, she knows that you are in favor of Second Amendment rights, and she knows you're pro-life, and she knows you're against the IRS, but how does she know that everybody else feels that way?
[03:36:00.076 --> 03:36:03.938]  I said, because she can capture, her agents can capture,
[03:36:04.378 --> 03:36:06.380]  Every keystroke on your computer.
[03:36:06.380 --> 03:36:08.541]  How can she do that, he says?
[03:36:08.541 --> 03:36:20.829]  Because she has the power under the Patriot Act, which you, I won't tell you which Fox colleague this was, but you can probably guess, which you supported when your guy, George W. Bush, was in the White House.
[03:36:20.829 --> 03:36:24.312]  Now it's in the hands of those who would use this power against you.
[03:36:24.312 --> 03:36:25.533]  What, are you crazy?
[03:36:25.533 --> 03:36:31.557]  Don't you realize liberty, once given up and put in the hands of the government as power, never comes back?
[03:36:33.854 --> 03:36:35.255]  When will they learn?
[03:36:35.255 --> 03:36:36.716]  When will they learn, Alex?
[03:36:36.716 --> 03:36:39.317]  The Patriot Act wasn't enough for them to learn from.
[03:36:39.317 --> 03:36:42.039]  Now it's being used on them, the neocons themselves.
[03:36:42.039 --> 03:36:50.063]  This monstrosity from McCain and Lindsey Graham, where they can lock up any American they want and waterboard the person until the legislature says to stop.
[03:36:50.063 --> 03:36:52.805]  This is not America!
[03:36:52.805 --> 03:36:56.107]  This is not America.
[03:36:56.107 --> 03:37:00.329]  Let's talk about the heart and soul of the Republican Party.
[03:37:00.329 --> 03:37:01.810]  The leadership predominantly
[03:37:03.365 --> 03:37:16.991]  If George W. Bush had proposed Obamacare, the Republicans that are screaming the loudest now would be supporting it.
[03:37:16.991 --> 03:37:23.734]  That's what I think of their fidelity to the Constitution, to the primacy of the individual, and to the free market.
[03:37:23.734 --> 03:37:29.777]  To them, it's just a game of R vs. D. It has nothing to do with the natural law
[03:37:29.977 --> 03:37:30.577]  No, I totally agree.
[03:37:46.300 --> 03:37:47.200]  Well, I agree with you.
[03:37:47.200 --> 03:37:50.521]  Let me then pose the question this way for you.
[03:37:50.521 --> 03:37:55.862]  We've seen top Republican strategists come out against Rand Paul and say they've got to defeat them.
[03:37:55.862 --> 03:38:06.705]  They're now allowing the head election official who's running against Rand Paul and the Republican Party to not recuse himself but run the election
[03:38:07.705 --> 03:38:10.007]  That he himself is running in.
[03:38:10.007 --> 03:38:10.608]  Correct.
[03:38:10.608 --> 03:38:11.869]  The Associated Press.
[03:38:11.869 --> 03:38:13.090]  So I want to get your take on that.
[03:38:13.090 --> 03:38:18.215]  We have all these other Republican strategists demonizing the Tea Parties, demonizing the Birthers.
[03:38:18.215 --> 03:38:20.177]  We know his name's Barry Sitaro.
[03:38:20.177 --> 03:38:24.681]  We know he gave up his citizenship and became an Indonesian, regardless of what happened in Kenya.
[03:38:24.681 --> 03:38:26.403]  And where there's smoke, there's fire.
[03:38:26.403 --> 03:38:29.726]  We know that the mainline Blue Blood leadership
[03:38:30.306 --> 03:38:39.752]  is attempting to demonize and shut down debate and stop the American people from using the Republican Party to take our country back.
[03:38:39.752 --> 03:38:42.794]  What are your expert recommendations?
[03:38:42.794 --> 03:38:48.298]  Because those were, I mean, absolutely spot on earlier on what the state should do with Obamacare.
[03:38:48.298 --> 03:38:58.504]  What is your recommendation for the American people to not just let the Republicans play the part of opposition and then get in power and basically go along with all this?
[03:38:58.764 --> 03:39:05.589]  I think the American people should vote out of office, and aggressively hound out of office, lawfully, obviously.
[03:39:05.589 --> 03:39:11.654]  Not only everyone who voted for Obamacare, but everyone who voted for TARP, proposed by George W. Bush.
[03:39:11.654 --> 03:39:18.259]  Everyone who voted for the first two stimuluses that we've had in the past four years, which came from George W. Bush.
[03:39:18.259 --> 03:39:21.802]  Everyone who voted for the Patriot Act, which came from George W. Bush.
[03:39:21.802 --> 03:39:23.583]  Everyone who voted for any tax increase.
[03:39:23.583 --> 03:39:24.384]  Now that would be
[03:39:24.924 --> 03:39:28.447]  About 93 to 94 percent of the Congress.
[03:39:28.447 --> 03:39:31.549]  These people's voting records must be revealed.
[03:39:31.549 --> 03:39:38.313]  The collusion of Rand Paul being forced to run against the guy who was in charge of counting the ballots.
[03:39:38.313 --> 03:39:42.276]  Even Joe Stalin wouldn't have been so bold as to do that.
[03:39:42.276 --> 03:39:44.857]  He would have put a crony in to count the ballots.
[03:39:44.857 --> 03:39:52.042]  But in Kentucky, the Republicans are forcing Rand Paul to run against the guy who will decide who wins the election.
[03:39:52.042 --> 03:39:53.843]  The American public cannot put up with that.
[03:39:53.843 --> 03:39:54.484]  They need to fight.
[03:39:54.824 --> 03:39:55.144]  I think?
[03:40:16.016 --> 03:40:32.078]  They are as much a threat to the Republican leadership, thank God, as they are to the Democratic leadership, because they understand that the Constitution was written to keep the government off the people's backs, not to find sneaky ways for the government to do it and get away with it.
[03:40:32.839 --> 03:40:36.101]  Let's expand into Rand Paul, Ron Paul's son.
[03:40:36.101 --> 03:40:38.322]  I mean, in many polls, he's 10 points ahead.
[03:40:38.322 --> 03:40:40.603]  He's a shoe-in to win.
[03:40:40.603 --> 03:40:46.847]  And this illustrates, and the Republican leadership admits this, this isn't just an anti-Democrat incumbency.
[03:40:46.847 --> 03:40:49.829]  This is an anti-incumbent period.
[03:40:49.829 --> 03:40:53.671]  And the guy he's running against is getting all this AIG banker money.
[03:40:54.411 --> 03:41:22.811]  He's a globalist and then meanwhile he's going to run the election and I talked to Rand Paul's people two days ago and they talked about they went to the Commission and they said unanimously no he can run your election but then we looked at past rulings in other states they've always said someone has to recuse themselves if they're the state's head election official and are running I mean again it just shows how
[03:41:23.957 --> 03:41:34.788]  Every form of common sense and checks and balances are being removed, and when you have a real constitutionalist running for an office, in come the Republican Party to try to destroy them.
[03:41:34.788 --> 03:41:40.735]  They fear someone like Rand Paul just as much as they fear his father, Ron Paul, because of their
[03:41:41.315 --> 03:41:49.621]  Utter fidelity to the Constitution and to the natural law and to the belief that the individual is greater than the government.
[03:41:49.621 --> 03:42:02.611]  Even in my home state of New Jersey, notorious for corruptions and political prosecutions, it is against the law for the collector of the ballots to be on the ballot when he's collecting them.
[03:42:02.611 --> 03:42:07.635]  It's almost inconceivable that this could be happening in Kentucky right underneath our noses
[03:42:07.875 --> 03:42:08.195]  I think?
[03:42:29.611 --> 03:42:38.696]  If the government's behavior appears to be in a conflict, then the person that is creating the appearance of a conflict should step back.
[03:42:38.696 --> 03:42:50.222]  This guy can run against Rand Paul, or this guy can count the votes in the election that Rand Paul is running in, but nobody in their right mind would say that he could do both at the same time and be absolutely honest.
[03:42:50.222 --> 03:42:56.025]  That's too much of a temptation for a human being to have to endure and for the electorate to have to abide by.
[03:42:56.525 --> 03:43:01.207]  Well, I mean, you've got all the election officials under him that are being promised jobs in the U.S.
[03:43:01.207 --> 03:43:01.628]  Senate.
[03:43:01.628 --> 03:43:01.908]  Absolutely.
[03:43:01.908 --> 03:43:04.569]  They're all political appointees, Alex.
[03:43:04.569 --> 03:43:10.092]  So he can take them to, well, he's not going to go to the Senate, but he can promise to take them to the Senate with him.
[03:43:10.092 --> 03:43:18.196]  So will they look the other way when a group of absentee ballots suddenly disappears into the river or suddenly shows up in somebody's trunk?
[03:43:18.656 --> 03:43:33.845]  This will force Dr. Paul Rand Paul to hire more poll watchers, to hire more people, to watch the government because the government cannot be trusted to run an honest election because the guy running the election is running against Rand Paul.
[03:43:33.845 --> 03:43:36.346]  This is just absurd.
[03:43:36.346 --> 03:43:45.131]  Well, I mean, if this precedent gets set, this new corrupt precedent, pretty soon the only people that can get elected anywhere will be the head of election.
[03:43:45.131 --> 03:43:48.113]  Suddenly, that'll be the only person that can run and win and
[03:43:49.065 --> 03:43:53.049]  Then they'll become kings and their kids will be the only ones that can win.
[03:43:53.049 --> 03:43:56.351]  Sort of like Alexander Hamilton when he wanted George Washington to be a king.
[03:43:56.351 --> 03:43:57.532]  You know what I think will happen?
[03:43:57.532 --> 03:44:04.919]  Rand Paul wins by such a large number that all of their sneaking and trickery will not be enough to affect the outcome.
[03:44:04.919 --> 03:44:11.705]  And this collector of ballots who also wants to be on the Senate will be relegated to the dustbin of history where he belongs.
[03:44:12.443 --> 03:44:13.965]  Well, we're already running out of time.
[03:44:13.965 --> 03:44:17.129]  It's always amazing having, and we got 15 minutes left here.
[03:44:17.129 --> 03:44:20.833]  I want to get into the book, Lies the Government Told You, but first...
[03:44:21.704 --> 03:44:29.589]  Specifically, the Democrats and Lindsey Graham, the Republicans, they all know that carbon dioxide isn't bad.
[03:44:29.589 --> 03:44:32.831]  They all know that China isn't going to make the cuts.
[03:44:32.831 --> 03:44:37.814]  They all know that this will be industrial suicide.
[03:44:37.814 --> 03:44:42.057]  And we have all these big environmentalists saying they want to destroy our economy.
[03:44:42.057 --> 03:44:46.120]  Why does government want to destroy the economy?
[03:44:46.560 --> 03:44:49.965]  Government wants to control us because of what St.
[03:44:49.965 --> 03:44:51.968]  Augustine called libido dominandi.
[03:44:51.968 --> 03:44:54.271]  Look, we all know about certain types of libido.
[03:44:54.271 --> 03:44:56.634]  This is a lust for power.
[03:44:56.634 --> 03:45:01.361]  Before the Civil War, we sent people to our state houses and to Congress.
[03:45:01.561 --> 03:45:12.650]  People who are interested in liberty, who were concerned with confining the government, with assuring that it did not interfere with our natural rights, with our civil liberties, and with our property rights.
[03:45:12.650 --> 03:45:16.333]  Since the Civil War, we have sent people to the government, by and large.
[03:45:16.333 --> 03:45:19.376]  There are exceptions both before the Civil War and afterwards.
[03:45:19.376 --> 03:45:24.180]  But by and large, people who are not interested in liberty, but people who are interested in power.
[03:45:24.180 --> 03:45:25.801]  Power for its own sake.
[03:45:25.801 --> 03:45:27.343]  Power in and of itself.
[03:45:27.343 --> 03:45:28.904]  Power to control other people.
[03:45:29.484 --> 03:45:33.065]  Government attracts those who lust for power.
[03:45:33.065 --> 03:45:43.069]  Ron Paul and Rand Paul and Ron Paul's colleagues in the House, and if there are any in the Senate, I'm unaware of them, are the exception to the rule.
[03:45:43.069 --> 03:45:47.990]  But for the most part, this is the type of human being that the government attracts.
[03:45:47.990 --> 03:45:49.691]  And this type of illicit
[03:45:50.551 --> 03:45:57.154]  Aggregation of power gets worse and worse and worse because when they get power, they hand it off to their successors.
[03:45:57.154 --> 03:46:00.615]  Just like Mike Chertoff handed it off to Janet Napolitano.
[03:46:00.615 --> 03:46:01.575]  And I know what you're thinking.
[03:46:01.575 --> 03:46:03.416]  The answer is no.
[03:46:03.416 --> 03:46:04.656]  We are not related.
[03:46:04.656 --> 03:46:09.278]  This happens generation after generation after generation.
[03:46:09.278 --> 03:46:15.240]  That's why I am not optimistic about our future because it will take a generation of Drs.
[03:46:15.240 --> 03:46:19.322]  Paul to change this, to stop it, to reverse it.
[03:46:20.054 --> 03:46:22.257]  Well, that's what G. Edward Griffin and others have said, though.
[03:46:22.257 --> 03:46:23.919]  We have to have the long view of history.
[03:46:23.919 --> 03:46:26.021]  We're not going to beat these people overnight.
[03:46:26.021 --> 03:46:33.911]  We've got to do everything we can and start resisting now just to slow it down and then stop it and then start reversing it.
[03:46:33.911 --> 03:46:34.973]  But the good news is
[03:46:35.593 --> 03:46:37.695]  This has really opened people's eyes up.
[03:46:37.695 --> 03:46:49.084]  The carbon taxes, the open borders, the takeover of the health care bill, the fact that it is just pure robbery, not even benevolent socialism, which is an oxymoron.
[03:46:49.084 --> 03:46:55.289]  Do you agree, though, that the battle lines are now drawn and that the awakening is exploding?
[03:46:55.289 --> 03:47:01.454]  I do, and I believe that the great mass of independent voters are on the side of liberty in this.
[03:47:02.074 --> 03:47:11.242]  I believe that the average man and woman who accepted the government for what it was now fear it and now need to understand that they can change it.
[03:47:11.242 --> 03:47:19.689]  When I told a crowd in Florida the other night that we have the power to abolish the IRS, the place went wild with enthusiasm.
[03:47:19.689 --> 03:47:20.730]  And a couple people said to me,
[03:47:21.385 --> 03:47:22.506]  I didn't know that.
[03:47:22.506 --> 03:47:24.088]  I thought it was in the Constitution.
[03:47:24.088 --> 03:47:26.030]  I thought we had to have income taxes.
[03:47:26.030 --> 03:47:33.579]  We have the power, if we work hard enough and educate ourselves, to throw the yoke of tyranny off of us.
[03:47:33.579 --> 03:47:34.720]  Okay, Judge.
[03:47:34.720 --> 03:47:37.764]  Judge, I'm going to give you the floor for the last 12 minutes.
[03:47:39.265 --> 03:47:41.347]  And we're going to skip this network break coming up.
[03:47:41.347 --> 03:47:51.135]  I'm going to sit back and I want you to give us a speech, a rant, cover the book, any issues you want to cover, and I'll say bye to you because I always get so intrigued and I want to back up what you're saying.
[03:47:51.135 --> 03:47:52.056]  I'm always adding things.
[03:47:52.056 --> 03:47:54.198]  I want at the end of the interview, shut up.
[03:47:54.198 --> 03:47:59.282]  But before we do that, I want to encourage viewers to support this radio show and to support our films.
[03:47:59.562 --> 03:48:02.625]  We have two new films coming out in the middle of April.
[03:48:02.625 --> 03:48:10.353]  Order them at InfoWars.com, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, and Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[03:48:10.353 --> 03:48:14.398]  You'll also see them premiere at PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality.
[03:48:14.398 --> 03:48:20.945]  But go buy the DVDs, make copies, give them to everyone you know because one of the most effective things that we have ever
[03:48:21.827 --> 03:48:25.189]  Done is these films, and this unlocks people's minds.
[03:48:25.189 --> 03:48:28.351]  It shows them the predatory nature of this global elite.
[03:48:28.351 --> 03:48:36.655]  Please go to Infowars.com, purchase the books, the videos, the materials, because they're key tools to wake your friends and family up, and it supports this broadcast.
[03:48:36.655 --> 03:48:44.840]  Now, the only caveat of Proviso, and I'm going to sit back and shut up, Judge, is before you get into the book and taxes and the nature of slavery and bondage, and we
[03:48:45.300 --> 03:48:46.823]  What we're truly going under.
[03:48:46.823 --> 03:48:49.409]  Global government is openly being announced.
[03:48:49.409 --> 03:48:53.997]  Why do you think they're finally admitting that, okay, it's a world government, it's going to be run by banks?
[03:48:54.870 --> 03:49:13.306]  And what is the nature of this world government from your research and then tie that in to the overarching system of why they want a global government so no one can run and flee and set up societies that are free because then that competes with the collectivist and outshines them in every case.
[03:49:13.306 --> 03:49:17.971]  So speak to that and then you've got the floor in the last 11 minutes on any issue you want to cover.
[03:49:17.971 --> 03:49:21.514]  Oh, you are so kind and so generous to me, Alex, and I'm deeply grateful
[03:49:22.194 --> 03:49:22.815]  Uh, to be here.
[03:49:22.815 --> 03:49:25.979]  Look, I'm just a simple night watchman that's employed by Fox.
[03:49:25.979 --> 03:49:32.948]  My job is to watch the government in the night time when it doesn't think that people are watching it and doesn't want people to look at it.
[03:49:32.948 --> 03:49:37.154]  To see what it is doing to steal our freedom and to steal our property.
[03:49:37.154 --> 03:49:40.278]  The one world government has been around since the progressive era.
[03:49:40.698 --> 03:49:42.040]  And you're right, Alex.
[03:49:42.040 --> 03:49:44.983]  These people are enormously patient.
[03:49:44.983 --> 03:49:50.209]  Obviously, the people who came up with this concept are no longer with us, but their successors are.
[03:49:50.209 --> 03:49:54.854]  They are wealthier, they are more sophisticated, and they are just as committed as their
[03:49:55.270 --> 03:49:56.131]  We're good to go.
[03:50:18.687 --> 03:50:21.870]  Whatever they want to call the process by which they take it.
[03:50:21.870 --> 03:50:32.441]  They want to protect us cradle to grave so that we are totally dependent upon them for everything so they can decide who will be in their group and who won't.
[03:50:32.441 --> 03:50:36.384]  If you read George Orwell's 1984, he was just off by a couple of years.
[03:50:38.325 --> 03:50:43.976]  But almost everything that was in there was predicted and we see it now.
[03:50:43.976 --> 03:50:49.186]  The use of law to assault liberty and to steal property.
[03:50:49.730 --> 03:50:53.491]  Do you remember, Alex, studying basic American history?
[03:50:53.491 --> 03:50:57.953]  The King of England had ingenious ways to tax us.
[03:50:57.953 --> 03:51:00.614]  The last straw was the Stamp Act.
[03:51:00.614 --> 03:51:05.976]  It required that every colonist have, on every piece of paper in his or her home, a stamp.
[03:51:05.976 --> 03:51:15.199]  Every book, every bank draft, every mortgage, every lease, every deed, every pamphlet, even a poster that was going to be nailed to a tree, had to have the King's stamp on it.
[03:51:16.058 --> 03:51:23.603]  Imagine having to go, we have enough difficulties with the post office as it is, you had to go to a foreign post office in the colonies and buy the King's stamp.
[03:51:23.603 --> 03:51:29.346]  Question, how did the government know if you had the King's stamp on every piece of paper in your house?
[03:51:29.346 --> 03:51:32.408]  Answer, the Parliament enacted the Townsend Acts.
[03:51:32.888 --> 03:51:36.331]  Which permitted British soldiers to write their own search warrants.
[03:51:36.331 --> 03:51:45.599]  And thus they would show up at your home and hand you a piece of paper on which they had purported to authorize themselves to enter your home, ostensibly to look for the stamps.
[03:51:45.599 --> 03:51:51.805]  Of course they would confiscate alcohol, they would confiscate furniture which you couldn't demonstrate you had paid taxes on.
[03:51:51.805 --> 03:51:56.449]  They would even sometimes kick you out of the house and take it over for days or weeks or months.
[03:51:57.372 --> 03:52:24.068]  We fought a revolution, we won the revolution, we wrote a constitution, we added the Fourth Amendment to that constitution, which next to the right to life is the greatest right there is, the right to be left alone, and it says the government can't come onto your property, and can't seize what you have, and can't intrude into your privacy unless it goes to a judge and demonstrates to a neutral judge that it is more likely than not that you are committing crime.
[03:52:25.074 --> 03:52:27.456]  Fast forward 200 years to the Patriot Act.
[03:52:27.456 --> 03:52:29.257]  What does the Patriot Act do?
[03:52:29.257 --> 03:52:35.002]  It allows federal agents to write their own search warrants.
[03:52:35.002 --> 03:52:52.175]  We have elected a government that has done the very same thing to us, which was the last straw when we broke away from an island 3,000 miles away that was regulating us as if we were chattel and as if we were slaves to them.
[03:52:52.745 --> 03:53:08.543]  When Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence the words that every school child knows, Alex, by heart, all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, and that among these is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:53:09.449 --> 03:53:25.181]  He wedded the American soul to the idea of the natural law, that our rights come from nature, from our humanity, that we are created in the image and likeness of God, and as He is perfectly free, He has given us the gift of perfect freedom.
[03:53:25.755 --> 03:53:37.904]  In Philadelphia in 1787, when they argued all summer about how the government should look and what the Constitution should be, they began with an argument about what is the source of our rights.
[03:53:37.904 --> 03:53:48.552]  And Alexander Hamilton, the big government guy of the day, the guy who said debt was good, even in 1787, argued that without the government there can be no rights,
[03:53:48.892 --> 03:53:49.513]  We're good to go.
[03:54:05.516 --> 03:54:10.638]  It says, Congress shall make no law abridging THE freedom of speech.
[03:54:10.638 --> 03:54:12.659]  Why do I emphasize the word THE?
[03:54:12.659 --> 03:54:22.343]  Because the framers recognized that freedom of speech pre-existed the government, pre-existed the country, came by virtue of our birth.
[03:54:22.343 --> 03:54:33.688]  And the purpose of the First Amendment was to assure that Congress, and ultimately the President, and eventually the courts, and one day the states, could not interfere with the basic freedoms.
[03:54:34.580 --> 03:54:35.766]  The right to think as you wish.
[03:54:36.383 --> 03:54:38.124]  The right to say what you think.
[03:54:38.124 --> 03:54:39.705]  The right to publish what you say.
[03:54:39.705 --> 03:54:42.187]  The right to worship or not to worship.
[03:54:42.187 --> 03:54:44.749]  The right to come and go as you see fit.
[03:54:44.749 --> 03:54:47.911]  The right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
[03:54:47.911 --> 03:55:02.300]  The right to defend yourself, Alex, by any technologically advanced means that are available at any given time, which includes the right to shoot at the government when it is taken over by tyrants.
[03:55:02.300 --> 03:55:05.542]  And then, of course, the right to be left alone in the Fourth Amendment.
[03:55:06.323 --> 03:55:10.204]  Every time the government was in front of me, Alex, it wasn't to enforce the Constitution.
[03:55:27.972 --> 03:55:30.577]  It wasn't to protect someone's rights.
[03:55:30.577 --> 03:55:39.595]  It was to find some sneaky or ingenious way to get around the Constitution, but claim that they were enforcing it.
[03:55:40.672 --> 03:55:49.657]  Now, my new book, and I'm very happy to tell you that as of a few minutes ago, it's number 13 on the New York Times bestseller list.
[03:55:49.657 --> 03:55:52.059]  That doesn't mean the Times approves of the book.
[03:55:52.059 --> 03:55:52.939]  Hardly.
[03:55:52.939 --> 03:56:08.308]  It means that the most public counter of book sales is ranking me number 13, which is very good because then it gets published in that list and a lot of folks that don't watch Fox or listen to Alex Jones or don't know me will be exposed to the book.
[03:56:08.308 --> 03:56:09.829]  The book posits the following.
[03:56:10.689 --> 03:56:14.072]  Why do we expect that the government will lie?
[03:56:14.072 --> 03:56:18.215]  Why do we know that the government lies and do nothing about it?
[03:56:18.215 --> 03:56:27.103]  Would Lyndon Johnson have beaten Barry Goldwater in 64 if we knew that he was secretly planning to invade North Vietnam as he accused Goldwater of doing?
[03:56:27.103 --> 03:56:28.484]  Would FDR have been elected in 44?
[03:56:29.605 --> 03:56:37.012]  Re-elected in 44 if the public had known that he caused Pearl Harbor because he needed an excuse to enter World War II?
[03:56:37.012 --> 03:56:46.101]  Would George W. Bush have been re-elected in 2004 if people knew that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that he knew it and ought to have known it?
[03:56:46.101 --> 03:56:48.443]  That he was torturing people and lying about it?
[03:56:48.443 --> 03:56:53.648]  That he was listening to people's phone calls and capturing their computer strokes all in violation of federal law?
[03:56:54.927 --> 03:57:02.814]  That's what the book challenges Americans, Alex, to be aware of, to recognize, to reject, and to correct.
[03:57:02.814 --> 03:57:06.077]  My dear friend, I've enjoyed all my time with you.
[03:57:06.077 --> 03:57:09.580]  And in closing, why do we put up with the lying?
[03:57:09.580 --> 03:57:18.428]  Why have we gotten to a point where it's just accepted they lie, but then that 20% that supports the government health bill still believe they're getting something free,
[03:57:19.720 --> 03:57:25.002]  And the system is going for broke because they passed the point of no return.
[03:57:25.002 --> 03:57:26.522]  They have committed so many crimes.
[03:57:26.522 --> 03:57:27.443]  They're so lawless.
[03:57:27.443 --> 03:57:28.923]  They've stolen so much.
[03:57:28.923 --> 03:57:30.704]  They know the country's going bankrupt.
[03:57:30.704 --> 03:57:37.126]  Bloomberg reports the feds are openly getting ready to take pension funds to fund their operations and to fund the banks.
[03:57:37.746 --> 03:57:44.812]  They have decided to go all the way, just like Hitler or Stalin or Mao, and it's time for the public to wake up.
[03:57:44.812 --> 03:57:46.373]  I mean, you mentioned the Stamp Act.
[03:57:46.373 --> 03:58:03.306]  Here is New Jersey CBS television, CBS TV, WCBS, cops in New Jersey town giving keys to homes, and the cops are saying, we're putting keys on all your doors, and that we are now going to go into your house,
[03:58:04.508 --> 03:58:17.999]  To make sure you're safe, and now they have zoning laws in Illinois and other places where people wake up and they do inspections without asking to see how many toothbrushes you have to make sure that you don't have more people in your house than you're zoned for.
[03:58:17.999 --> 03:58:18.920]  It is incredible.
[03:58:18.920 --> 03:58:24.285]  Judge Andrew Napolitano, I want to really thank you for joining us and spending time with us.
[03:58:24.285 --> 03:58:26.547]  Fire out your website.
[03:58:26.547 --> 03:58:28.688]  JudgeNap at FoxNews.com.
[03:58:28.688 --> 03:58:29.829]  Alex, it's been a pleasure.
[03:58:29.829 --> 03:58:32.672]  Thanks for letting me share these airwaves with your wonderful listeners.
[03:58:33.212 --> 03:58:36.715]  We appreciate you never compromising and being a true constitutionalist.
[03:58:36.715 --> 03:58:38.536]  God bless and Godspeed.
[03:58:38.536 --> 03:58:39.316]  We'll be right back.
[03:58:39.316 --> 03:58:39.817]  Stay with us.
[03:58:51.314 --> 03:58:55.517]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[03:58:55.517 --> 03:59:01.922]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[03:59:01.922 --> 03:59:09.308]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[03:59:09.308 --> 03:59:14.192]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[03:59:14.192 --> 03:59:16.314]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[03:59:19.116 --> 03:59:22.879]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[03:59:22.879 --> 03:59:25.161]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[03:59:53.420 --> 03:59:55.461]  Direct from Austin.
