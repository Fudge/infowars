[00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.656]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.656 --> 00:00:11.237]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:12.799]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.984]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:21.049]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:32.965]  Another very important broadcast lined up for the listeners today.
[00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:41.476]  Charlie Sheen popping in for an update on our attempt to put 9-11 investigation on the front burner.
[00:00:41.476 --> 00:00:43.258]  We'll be joining us in T-minus 30 minutes.
[00:00:45.387 --> 00:00:55.175]  Two hours from now, Steve Quayle will be joining us with the latest updates on the flu, forced inoculations, and of course, martial law.
[00:00:55.175 --> 00:01:08.186]  There are towns across the country, not just with regular Army, Marines, and National Guard being deployed on the streets in the name of police shortages, even though they've tripled the number of the police in the last 12 years or so.
[00:01:09.434 --> 00:01:21.318]  But now they have private mercenary police unannounced to city councils just arriving, calling themselves national police, quote, guarding local detention centers.
[00:01:21.318 --> 00:01:25.879]  So the private mercs are now being deployed around the country.
[00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:26.679]  This is confirmed.
[00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.381]  Steve Quayle called me frantically, and I missed his call last Friday.
[00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:35.422]  Then I got an alert from him Sunday about different towns having
[00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:40.077]  Paramilitary private mercs deployed in them.
[00:01:40.077 --> 00:01:42.818]  And then this morning, Paul Watson had a big article on it.
[00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:49.042]  A bunch of mainstream media reported on it yesterday, but as if it's a wonderful, good thing.
[00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:56.327]  And locals going, we don't know who this private national police force is, but they guard the local camp that was built.
[00:01:56.327 --> 00:01:57.968]  No one's in it.
[00:01:57.968 --> 00:02:03.852]  We don't know why the camp was built, but now they say they're the police in our town too, and they're going to tell us what to do.
[00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.800]  You can't make this type of stuff up.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.000]  It's just too off the charts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.342]  I mean, I'm laughing because as if it isn't bad enough, they take blood at checkpoints without warrants in Texas now and many other areas of the country.
[00:02:18.342 --> 00:02:27.764]  As if it isn't bad enough that I have a news clip of the police chief of Pittsburgh and the police chief of Oakland in Pennsylvania both saying, look, you're not allowed to be on the streets.
[00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:29.824]  If you do, we attack you.
[00:02:29.824 --> 00:02:34.205]  There's no more protesting, no more meeting at parks.
[00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:34.825]  Martial law.
[00:02:35.902 --> 00:02:42.071]  And then they beat you in the heavy building clubs and hit you with sound cannons and tear gas canisters and rubber bullets if you don't.
[00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:47.780]  I mean, it's just amazing to see tyranny coming down on the American people with both feet.
[00:02:49.087 --> 00:03:03.338]  With the backdrop of endless terror alerts about the bust in Dallas and the bust in Illinois and the FBI went out and created groups and found loners out of prison and told them they'd pay them money if they just helped them build a bomb.
[00:03:03.338 --> 00:03:13.966]  Just out-provocateuring and entrapping so they can then get up and hype on the news and say that Iran's behind it and lie about Iran and say they had a secret facility when Iran's openly building
[00:03:14.853 --> 00:03:18.376]  Centrifuge Uranium Enrichment Centers for Peaceful Uses.
[00:03:18.376 --> 00:03:19.677]  The type of centrifuges they have.
[00:03:19.677 --> 00:03:20.597]  Can't build.
[00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:22.539]  Can't produce fissile material.
[00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.740]  95% what they need for bombs.
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.161]  They make the announcement last week.
[00:03:26.161 --> 00:03:27.882]  Hey, here's one of our new facilities.
[00:03:27.882 --> 00:03:30.464]  And they announced they had to admit their secret facility.
[00:03:30.464 --> 00:03:31.885]  We've caught them.
[00:03:31.885 --> 00:03:35.348]  Oh my gosh, we need to attack immediately with nuclear weapons.
[00:03:37.455 --> 00:03:44.660]  Oh boy, and they're announcing the end of the dollar, they're announcing world government, they're just running all over us like never before seen.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.122]  Saying they need 500,000 troops for Afghanistan.
[00:03:48.122 --> 00:03:50.683]  The left says, yay, that's peace!
[00:03:50.683 --> 00:03:56.607]  Obama's increasing troops, increasing contractors in Iraq, increasing troops in Afghanistan.
[00:03:56.607 --> 00:03:57.648]  It's liberal!
[00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:06.775]  He announces this week, yes, we will have permanent detention, we're expanding it and going to build FEMA centers in America, and we're not closing Guantanamo.
[00:04:06.775 --> 00:04:07.516]  Yay!
[00:04:07.516 --> 00:04:11.680]  I'm hiring nothing but lobbyists, and everything I do is secret.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.220]  Yay!
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.243]  I'm expanding the Patriot Act that Bush got into place.
[00:04:15.243 --> 00:04:16.044]  Yeah!
[00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:16.724]  Liberal!
[00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:21.607]  And if you don't like it, you're a right-wing racist!
[00:04:21.607 --> 00:04:26.009]  If you're not for torturing people, brown people in secret camps, you're racist!
[00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:32.672]  If you're not for expanding the abortion funding and infanticide funding in China and Africa, you're a racist!
[00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:33.552]  He's liberal!
[00:04:33.552 --> 00:04:34.313]  He's black!
[00:04:35.902 --> 00:04:44.645]  And all over the country, videos are coming in from North Carolina and Texas and New Jersey and California of kids worshipping Obama.
[00:04:44.645 --> 00:04:47.406]  Much worse than the video we broke a month ago.
[00:04:47.406 --> 00:04:50.087]  I mean, it is downright absolute god-like worship.
[00:04:50.087 --> 00:04:54.288]  I mean, this is just... It's the worst tyranny I've ever seen.
[00:04:54.288 --> 00:04:56.089]  The most bizarre.
[00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:58.090]  It's almost satirical.
[00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.710]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.963 --> 00:05:07.708]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:13.791]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:16.453]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:23.017]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:05:23.017 --> 00:05:27.079]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:32.402]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:05:32.702 --> 00:05:34.783]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:05:34.783 --> 00:05:36.544]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:39.065]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:05:39.065 --> 00:05:43.787]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:05:43.787 --> 00:05:47.489]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:05:47.489 --> 00:05:50.630]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.511]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:53.551]  One last time.
[00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:54.632]  It's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:06.604]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:06:06.604 --> 00:06:07.945]  And we knew what to do.
[00:06:07.945 --> 00:06:09.947]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:09.947 --> 00:06:16.953]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:16.953 --> 00:06:25.500]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:25.868 --> 00:06:32.971]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:32.971 --> 00:06:36.133]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:40.034]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was BOOM!
[00:06:40.034 --> 00:06:40.334]  BOOM!
[00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:40.655]  BOOM!
[00:06:40.655 --> 00:06:40.975]  BOOM!
[00:06:40.975 --> 00:06:41.215]  BOOM!
[00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:44.973]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:44.973 --> 00:06:51.020]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.963]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:06:53.963 --> 00:06:58.909]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:02.042]  Are you constantly tired?
[00:07:02.042 --> 00:07:03.882]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:07.184]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[00:07:07.184 --> 00:07:10.205]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.

[00:08:00.478 --> 00:08:05.887]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.887 --> 00:08:08.171]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:20.773]  All right, Charlie Sheen's popping in later in the hour.
[00:08:20.773 --> 00:08:24.959]  We have Steve Quayle with breaking news on multi-fronts.
[00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:28.243]  He first told me about this last Friday.
[00:08:28.243 --> 00:08:31.367]  I was so busy finishing Fall of Republic.
[00:08:32.588 --> 00:08:59.677]  I'm getting it delivered for mass production and on other issues I kind of let it fall to the cracks and then was reminded of it when it finally hit mainstream news yesterday and we did a boil down article at PrisonPlanet.com Paul Watson Montana town occupied by private paramilitary security force announcing they're the police and it doesn't matter what the mayor or anybody says a detention center was built in the town
[00:09:00.728 --> 00:09:01.408]  We're good to go.
[00:09:24.215 --> 00:09:30.300]  Decals on the sides of their cars saying that they are the local police force with the name of the town on it.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.042]  And this is happening in other areas of the country.
[00:09:33.042 --> 00:09:35.765]  They've used black water in North Carolina.
[00:09:35.765 --> 00:09:41.329]  They're using black water in California to raid marijuana dispensaries.
[00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:43.031]  Even places that are supposedly legal.
[00:09:43.031 --> 00:09:44.652]  That was in the LA Times.
[00:09:44.652 --> 00:09:46.594]  This is Red Dawn in slow motion.
[00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:51.959]  They're just conquering America without blowing their trumpet announcing it.
[00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:55.802]  This is a covert operation and it's been going on for a long time.
[00:09:55.802 --> 00:10:06.512]  Montana town occupied by private paramilitary security force organization's goal is to quote help US government combat terrorism, patrols the streets of Hardin.
[00:10:07.717 --> 00:10:10.478]  A private security force whose biggest role is helping U.S.
[00:10:10.478 --> 00:10:20.343]  government to combat terrorism, that's on their own site, is now patrolling the streets of a town in Montana, acting as law enforcement, but accountable to nobody and operating completely outside the limitations of the U.S.
[00:10:20.343 --> 00:10:23.144]  Constitution, and a chilling throwback to the brown shirts.
[00:10:24.602 --> 00:10:36.095]  The American Police Force Organization is a paramilitary unit that provides surveillance, investigative, and military services across the world, according to its website, which shows men dressed in military fatigues carrying machine guns.
[00:10:36.095 --> 00:10:39.860]  As part of our mission, APF plays a critical role in helping the U.S.
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:44.405]  government meet vital homeland security and national security defense needs.
[00:10:44.405 --> 00:10:44.765]  And because
[00:10:45.717 --> 00:10:46.737]  They're testing the public.
[00:10:46.737 --> 00:10:53.260]  The public will probably bow down to them and start mowing their yards or trimming their toenails for them.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.721]  I mean, that's how tyranny works.
[00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:57.102]  It's just, it's happening.
[00:10:57.102 --> 00:11:00.784]  Within the last five years, the United States has been far and away our number one client.
[00:11:00.784 --> 00:11:05.426]  Technologies, programs, and services performed by APF have played a very important role in U.S.
[00:11:05.426 --> 00:11:10.408]  military and civilian efforts to protect our homeland and combat terrorism, their website states.
[00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:18.435]  APF, or American Police Force, were originally contracted to provide security at a previously empty jail in Arden.
[00:11:18.435 --> 00:11:20.617]  You look at it, it's a little FEMA center.
[00:11:20.617 --> 00:11:23.239]  Barbed wire system they built.
[00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:25.000]  A small town in Montana.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.381]  In fact, Watson calls that a jail.
[00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:29.524]  If you watch the newscast, it's a detention center, is what they call it on the local news.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:42.885]  But are now patrolling the streets driving SUVs with police department printed on them, despite the fact that Hardin doesn't have a police department.
[00:11:42.885 --> 00:11:47.348]  American Police Force has no jurisdiction in the area because it is a private organization, not a police force.
[00:11:47.348 --> 00:11:55.433]  According to Two Rivers Authority officials, having the private security force patrol the streets was not part of their contract.
[00:11:55.433 --> 00:11:56.994]  And then they had the local mayor on TV.
[00:11:58.903 --> 00:12:00.204]  I have no idea.
[00:12:00.204 --> 00:12:04.827]  I really don't, because that's not been part of any of the discussions we've had with any of them.
[00:12:04.827 --> 00:12:09.971]  Two Rivers Authority, Al Peterson, told KULR8 News.
[00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:12.613]  And again, you can watch that newscast.
[00:12:12.613 --> 00:12:17.996]  I posted the article, Montana town occupied by private paramilitary security firm.
[00:12:17.996 --> 00:12:24.321]  Peterson said that patrolling the streets was on a wish list of APFs, what Captain Michael
[00:12:25.307 --> 00:12:33.776]  So see, they just show up and announce, we're here to patrol, and they have hardened police on the side of their black SUVs.
[00:12:33.776 --> 00:12:37.520]  They're doing this everywhere, mainly Blackwater.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.381]  This is bizarre.
[00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:41.144]  They've got this weird Illuminati double eagle symbol they use.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.482]  I mean, unless they're Serbian, the only other use for it is a classic Illuminati New World Order symbol.
[00:12:47.482 --> 00:12:53.325]  The American police force is a shady outfit shrouded in suspicion, according to an Associated Press report.
[00:12:53.325 --> 00:12:56.247]  Questions over the legitimacy of the organization abound.
[00:12:56.247 --> 00:13:00.229]  Government contract databases show no record of the company.
[00:13:00.229 --> 00:13:04.571]  Security industry representatives and federal officials said they had never heard of it.
[00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:10.774]  On its website, the company lists its headquarters as a building in Washington near the White House that holds virtual offices.
[00:13:10.774 --> 00:13:11.815]  A spokesman for the building
[00:13:12.515 --> 00:13:17.178]  Said American police force never completed its application to use the address.
[00:13:17.178 --> 00:13:20.039]  Sounds like a classic CIA cut out to me.
[00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:28.905]  Furthermore, APF was tasked with filling the empty hardened jail with inmates without any clear indication of where those prisoners would come from.
[00:13:28.905 --> 00:13:32.787]  And you watch the newscast, we keep calling it a jail.
[00:13:32.787 --> 00:13:37.910]  They call it in the newscast, there's several of them, the detention center that was built
[00:13:38.789 --> 00:13:43.051]  And then they just arrived, and no one knew what was going to go in the detention facility.
[00:13:43.051 --> 00:13:46.153]  It's unclear where the company will get the inmates for the jail.
[00:13:46.153 --> 00:13:52.076]  Montana says it isn't sending inmates to the jail, and neither are federal officials in the state, according to the report.
[00:13:52.076 --> 00:14:02.561]  Maybe the inmates will be local population of Hardin, if American police force is allowed to continue to pose as law enforcement outfit in the town, which is exactly what they intend to do, at least for another month.
[00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:12.741]  And people commenting in the comment section of Prison Planet rightfully point out this is as banana republic as it gets.
[00:14:12.741 --> 00:14:15.343]  This is as hardcore third world as it gets.
[00:14:15.343 --> 00:14:19.125]  This is just like Iraq or Afghanistan, totally occupied by private mercs.
[00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:20.465]  And this is not the only case.
[00:14:20.465 --> 00:14:21.646]  This is happening all over the country.
[00:14:23.311 --> 00:14:33.611]  Having a private security force whose stated mission is to help the US government combat terrorism, patrol the streets of small towns in America without even having the authority to do so from local authorities is obviously a frightening pretext.
[00:14:34.705 --> 00:14:39.808]  And Harkins back to private paramilitary forces that helped Adolf Hitler rise to power in Nazi Germany.
[00:14:39.808 --> 00:14:50.633]  Many fear that if martial law is declared in response to a flu pandemic or other emergency, private security forces such as APF will be used by government to oppress citizens by operating outside the law.
[00:14:50.633 --> 00:14:56.216]  This is completely unconstitutional and a flagrant threat to the liberty and security of the population of Hardin.
[00:14:56.676 --> 00:15:07.878]  The county sheriff is effectively breaking the law if he doesn't immediately kick APF out of the area and in the occupation of the town by a private paramilitary army.
[00:15:07.878 --> 00:15:15.179]  And we're going to go ahead and play this little local newscast and then... We have a blind spot.
[00:15:15.179 --> 00:15:23.001]  I tend to report things before they're mainstream news from government documents.
[00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:25.041]  And then once it becomes a big issue,
[00:15:27.734 --> 00:15:29.075]  We don't go back over it enough.
[00:15:29.075 --> 00:15:31.838]  I mean, I mention almost every day, watch out for the Gardasil shot.
[00:15:31.838 --> 00:15:39.105]  It's killed a lot of people and we put up links to mainstream news, but I did about an hour of research last night and my head was spinning.
[00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:46.672]  Literally, hundreds of newscasts on YouTube alone under the term Gardasil deaths, Gardasil illnesses, Gardasil
[00:15:48.266 --> 00:15:49.807]  Adverse reactions.
[00:15:49.807 --> 00:15:50.128]  Hundreds!
[00:15:50.128 --> 00:15:51.068]  I mean, I couldn't watch them all.
[00:15:51.068 --> 00:15:54.431]  I ended up watching, I don't know, 20, 30, 40, I don't know.
[00:15:54.431 --> 00:15:56.993]  My wife said at about 1 o'clock, why don't you come to bed?
[00:15:56.993 --> 00:15:57.874]  You need to get your sleep.
[00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:03.959]  You're supposedly not going to be working as much for the next few months.
[00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:07.382]  I mean, my head is spinning right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:07.382 --> 00:16:10.665]  My head is absolutely, completely spinning.
[00:16:10.665 --> 00:16:12.106]  Because it was worse than I thought.
[00:16:13.186 --> 00:16:19.610]  There are deaths all over Scotland, all over England, all over Europe, all over the United States.
[00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.871]  There are giant women's groups and mainline groups fighting it.
[00:16:22.871 --> 00:16:24.672]  PTAs fighting it.
[00:16:24.672 --> 00:16:26.954]  Mayors fighting it.
[00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:29.395]  And Merck is in a lot of trouble, but they don't care.
[00:16:29.395 --> 00:16:31.036]  They put out Vioxx and everything else.
[00:16:31.036 --> 00:16:32.337]  This is part of their stratagem.
[00:16:32.337 --> 00:16:34.378]  They've already been given government liability protection.
[00:16:34.378 --> 00:16:35.538]  But here's the headline.
[00:16:35.538 --> 00:16:41.702]  Schoolgirl 14 dies and three classmates taken ill after being given new cervical cancer vaccine at one school.
[00:16:43.038 --> 00:16:49.226]  Another article, as you know, last week, they're threatening to take people's children if they complain if their child dies or gets sick.
[00:16:49.226 --> 00:16:54.052]  They threaten to take the other kids if they don't shut up and sign forms agreeing to it.
[00:16:54.052 --> 00:16:58.397]  Even when they start dying from the second shot, they'll say, look, we're going to take your kids, take the third.
[00:16:58.397 --> 00:16:59.258]  There's not even a law.
[00:16:59.258 --> 00:17:01.441]  They just come with weapons in England.
[00:17:03.197 --> 00:17:16.205]  In the fourth hour today, I'm gonna mainly just play testimonies of women and young girls who've had the shot, and they show videos of them, cheerleaders, you know, marathons, you name it.
[00:17:16.205 --> 00:17:20.407]  Now they can't walk, they're paralyzed, drool dripping out of their mouths.
[00:17:20.407 --> 00:17:23.249]  Photos, video of the hellish blood pouring out of them.
[00:17:23.249 --> 00:17:27.732]  I don't know if we're gonna play that, but we're definitely gonna link up to it.
[00:17:27.732 --> 00:17:31.374]  I mean, how do I sit here and calmly go over all of this
[00:17:33.277 --> 00:17:36.639]  And then be laughed at by the mainstream media while all of this is happening.
[00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:41.682]  So we're really going to spend an hour on this today, because at least we can do something about this.
[00:17:41.682 --> 00:17:42.842]  We can't save the world.
[00:17:42.842 --> 00:17:44.663]  We don't have all the answers.
[00:17:44.663 --> 00:17:49.446]  There's too many issues to cover, but at least we can stop drinking fluoridated water and keep our girls.
[00:17:49.446 --> 00:17:53.569]  And now they want to force our boys to take this Gardasil live cancer virus.
[00:17:53.569 --> 00:17:58.892]  Let's go ahead and go to this video out of Hardin, where they've got the troops patrolling around the private mercs.
[00:17:58.892 --> 00:18:00.793]  We'll go to break and come back and cover other news.
[00:18:00.793 --> 00:18:01.213]  Stay with us.
[00:18:02.466 --> 00:18:09.111]  Well, members of the American Police Force showed up in Hardin yesterday driving vehicles with Hardin Police written on them.
[00:18:09.111 --> 00:18:16.337]  As Colorado's Nick Law reports, it created quite a stir, especially because Hardin doesn't have a city police department.
[00:18:16.337 --> 00:18:18.919]  This was the talk of the town in Hardin on Thursday.
[00:18:18.919 --> 00:18:25.284]  Mercedes decked out in the city of Hardin Police Department decals and driven by American Police Force members.
[00:18:25.714 --> 00:18:30.997]  Two Rivers Authority officials say having APF patrol the streets was never part of their agenda.
[00:18:30.997 --> 00:18:32.557]  You know, I have no idea.
[00:18:32.557 --> 00:18:37.180]  I really don't, because that's not anything that's been in the discussions that I've had with any of them.
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:44.243]  As it stands now, the Bighorn County Sheriff's Department is contracted to patrol the city, and APF has no jurisdiction.
[00:18:44.243 --> 00:18:48.485]  If that was changed, Peterson claims it would have to go through the City Council.
[00:18:48.485 --> 00:18:55.389]  As for the jail contract with APF, both sides are yet to agree on a deal, as bondholders rejected it again on Thursday morning.
[00:18:56.004 --> 00:18:57.625]  No, it's a complicated issue.
[00:18:57.625 --> 00:19:00.726]  There's a lot of tax laws that they're working through.
[00:19:00.726 --> 00:19:02.326]  And we're just hoping now.
[00:19:02.326 --> 00:19:04.447]  We thought we were going to get it by Tuesday night.
[00:19:04.447 --> 00:19:06.208]  We're hoping now we can get it by Friday night.
[00:19:06.208 --> 00:19:12.030]  And Two Rivers Authority officials say the contract only deals with the detention facility and the training center.
[00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:17.372]  There's no mention of a homeless shelter, animal shelter, or any other services for the area.
[00:19:17.372 --> 00:19:20.393]  Well, you know, that was never in the contract to begin with.
[00:19:20.393 --> 00:19:25.215]  I think it was just kind of on a wish list of what Captain Michael wanted to do here.
[00:19:25.649 --> 00:19:26.009]  Under wraps!
[00:19:26.009 --> 00:19:26.350]  It's covert!
[00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:27.892]  Can't let the terrorists, the American people, know!
[00:19:27.892 --> 00:19:28.712]  By the way, major newspaper
[00:19:48.226 --> 00:19:53.436]  The Globe is reporting that I am officially on the White House enemies list.
[00:19:53.436 --> 00:19:57.263]  That's been in the news, been in the AP, they have an enemies list.
[00:19:57.263 --> 00:19:58.386]  I'm near the top of the list.
[00:20:01.104 --> 00:20:02.245]  Attention all U.S.
[00:20:02.245 --> 00:20:04.688]  homeowners stuck in high interest rate mortgages.
[00:20:04.688 --> 00:20:08.412]  Are you finding it harder and harder to keep up with your monthly mortgage payments?
[00:20:08.412 --> 00:20:17.421]  Homeowners with all types of credit can now apply for FHA government-insured 30-year fixed rates as low as 4.875% from TopDot Mortgage.
[00:20:17.421 --> 00:20:20.585]  With an FHA loan from TopDot, you can consolidate debt.
[00:20:20.825 --> 00:20:23.667]  Lower your mortgage payments or get cash for any reason.
[00:20:50.725 --> 00:20:51.226]  We're good to go.
[00:21:00.566 --> 00:21:07.232]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:07.232 --> 00:21:15.359]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:15.359 --> 00:21:23.526]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:23.526 --> 00:21:28.290]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:33.833]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:33.833 --> 00:21:38.176]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:38.176 --> 00:21:39.276]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:39.276 --> 00:21:43.779]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:43.779 --> 00:21:45.180]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:48.662 --> 00:21:51.663]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:51.663 --> 00:21:53.924]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.924 --> 00:21:56.565]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.565 --> 00:22:03.608]  It's here.
[00:22:03.608 --> 00:22:08.770]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:16.393]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:22:17.099 --> 00:22:24.549]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:27.874]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:22:27.874 --> 00:22:30.618]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:22:30.618 --> 00:22:31.379]  NSA spying.
[00:22:31.934 --> 00:22:36.278]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:22:36.278 --> 00:22:40.241]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:42.503]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:22:42.503 --> 00:22:46.946]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:22:46.946 --> 00:22:53.952]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:22:59.989 --> 00:23:07.251]  Attention landscapers, house painters, carpet cleaners, pet sitters, gutter cleaners, and anyone who has their own home service business.
[00:23:07.251 --> 00:23:10.692]  Would you love to build a huge and loyal customer base fast?
[00:23:10.692 --> 00:23:11.833]  Well, now you can.
[00:23:11.833 --> 00:23:14.013]  Introducing the Magic Yellow Flyer.
[00:23:14.013 --> 00:23:22.436]  The Magic Yellow Flyer marketing system is the most effective and inexpensive way to build a referral-only service business in a short period of time.
[00:23:22.436 --> 00:23:25.397]  Get new customers and build a solid customer base.
[00:23:25.697 --> 00:23:29.519]  Throw away all of the other ineffective and expensive advertising methods.
[00:23:29.519 --> 00:23:31.260]  You need the Magic Yellow Flyer.
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:36.242]  Corporate America is destroying our country and it's time to rebuild the backbone of America.
[00:23:36.242 --> 00:23:41.125]  No matter what business you're in, the Magic Yellow Flyer marketing system will work for you.
[00:23:41.125 --> 00:23:42.385]  Don't have a home business?
[00:23:42.385 --> 00:23:47.948]  The Magic Yellow Flyer comes with 15 hot home businesses that you can start at a minimum cost.
[00:23:48.148 --> 00:23:50.609]  All over the United States, from Tennessee to New York State,
[00:24:15.219 --> 00:24:21.164]  They are not allowing conservative or libertarian kiosks.
[00:24:21.164 --> 00:24:24.206]  They give them the license at first.
[00:24:24.206 --> 00:24:27.749]  There are pro-Obama and anti-conservative kiosks around the nation.
[00:24:27.749 --> 00:24:28.870]  Those are fine.
[00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:33.914]  But malls all over the country are banning them.
[00:24:33.914 --> 00:24:35.655]  And this is in the news today.
[00:24:35.655 --> 00:24:38.217]  The latest article out of the Johnson City Press.
[00:24:38.217 --> 00:24:40.499]  No more business for no Obama salesman.
[00:24:42.173 --> 00:24:46.674]  And it says he has a business in the mall and he's been told he's not allowed to have it now he's being kicked out.
[00:24:46.674 --> 00:24:49.415]  We see these articles every couple days at different malls.
[00:24:49.415 --> 00:25:03.499]  Now, I just got a Globe World exclusive and it came out a few weeks ago that the White House does have a big enemies list and insiders have now leaked it
[00:25:05.089 --> 00:25:17.814]  Livid president targets loudmouth Glenn Beck, singers Pat Boone and Toby Keith and rival Sarah Palin and they have the list and guess who is number 24 on the list?
[00:25:17.814 --> 00:25:25.578]  This is front page of a big Canadian paper and British papers are both reporting on this right now.
[00:25:27.145 --> 00:25:34.250]  Alex Jones, maker of the anti-Obama films, The Obama Deception and The Fall of the Republic, The Presidency of Barack Obama.
[00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:44.358]  I even beat out Michelle Malkin, she's number 25, author of Culture of Corruption, Obama and His Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks and Cronies.
[00:25:44.358 --> 00:25:49.762]  Boy, this is not good news.
[00:25:49.762 --> 00:25:54.786]  I guess it is good news, depending on the way that you look at it.
[00:25:58.846 --> 00:26:06.351]  Under relentless assaults from a mob of vicious critics, President Barack Obama has drawn up a secret list of enemies he aims to take down one by one.
[00:26:06.351 --> 00:26:22.561]  That's the shocking word from political insiders who tell Globe the White House hit list contains 25 names so far, and it's topped by Fox TV host Glenn Beck, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, Congressman Joe Uli Wilson,
[00:26:23.846 --> 00:26:27.330]  And author Larry Sinclair, who claims he was a gay tryst with Obama.
[00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:36.401]  Incredibly ultra-religious pop legend Pat Boone, who sang the 1950s hit April Love, is also marked for action, as is country star Toby Keith.
[00:26:36.401 --> 00:26:40.605]  Insiders say Boone is part of a group claiming Obama's presidency is illegal.
[00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:49.252]  They insist he was born in Africa, not Hawaii, which would violate a constitutional clause requiring the commander-in-chief be a natural-born American.
[00:26:49.252 --> 00:26:50.433]  This is war!
[00:26:50.433 --> 00:26:55.057]  An insider tells Globe, Obama is going to do whatever he can to discredit these people.
[00:26:55.057 --> 00:27:03.183]  Yeah, they're attacking me mainly from alternative media, making up lies about me, but that actually only gets more listeners to find out the truth and hear the show.
[00:27:03.183 --> 00:27:05.485]  People hear the lies and tune in and find out what we really do here.
[00:27:06.949 --> 00:27:08.871]  So yes, we're under a major attack.
[00:27:08.871 --> 00:27:14.515]  I don't get into it a lot on air, but all the stops have been pulled out against this office and what we do here.
[00:27:14.515 --> 00:27:16.857]  So pray for us, folks.
[00:27:16.857 --> 00:27:19.318]  The article goes on to say he wants them silenced.
[00:27:19.318 --> 00:27:23.321]  He is enraged by the constant attacks on his presidency and against him personally.
[00:27:23.321 --> 00:27:24.462]  He's just had it.
[00:27:24.462 --> 00:27:27.004]  This has become a very personal for him.
[00:27:27.004 --> 00:27:31.548]  Iron-fisted First Lady Michelle is behind her husband's decision to go on the offensive, sources reveal.
[00:27:32.088 --> 00:27:37.730]  He's even held a strategy session with former President Bill Clinton, who is known as a slick political pit bull.
[00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.751]  Yeah, and to have people murdered, I would add.
[00:27:39.751 --> 00:27:40.591]  The Clinton death list.
[00:27:40.591 --> 00:27:44.893]  To discuss ways to destroy his most valuable and outspoken opponents.
[00:27:44.893 --> 00:27:48.114]  His most visible and outspoken opponents, sources say.
[00:27:48.114 --> 00:27:48.875]  Up until now...
[00:27:49.875 --> 00:27:59.517]  Obama has let his foes savage him mercilessly, even though insiders say Michelle has been urging him to fight back, fearing he'd be branded a wimp.
[00:27:59.517 --> 00:28:06.578]  I've been seeing all the liberals, all the fake liberals, like Bill Maher.
[00:28:06.578 --> 00:28:08.699]  I watch that a lot when I'm on the treadmill.
[00:28:08.699 --> 00:28:10.699]  It's always re-airing on HBO.
[00:28:10.699 --> 00:28:14.000]  And he just constantly says, don't be a wimp, attack them, go after them, arrest them.
[00:28:14.895 --> 00:28:18.236]  But the leader of the free world shrugged off the attacks as part of his job.
[00:28:18.236 --> 00:28:26.560]  The final straw came when South Carolina Republican Wilson shouted out, you lie, on national TV as the President addressed Congress about his health care plan on September 9th.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.181]  Obama was absolutely incensed by Wilson.
[00:28:30.181 --> 00:28:33.363]  Sources say that's when Obama said, enough is enough.
[00:28:33.363 --> 00:28:35.524]  He's had it with President Nice Guy.
[00:28:35.524 --> 00:28:36.524]  He's going to fight back.
[00:28:36.524 --> 00:28:43.167]  Immediately after the Wilson incident, Michelle and the President's trusted inner circle got together and drafted the enemies list.
[00:28:44.127 --> 00:28:54.576]  The source adds, the roster includes obvious critics like Wilson and conservative commenters like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly, sources say, but talk show host Beck is the White House number one enemy.
[00:28:54.576 --> 00:28:56.417]  And for good reason, the sources say.
[00:28:56.417 --> 00:29:05.625]  Beck called Obama a racist, well he is part of a racist church, and said the insider, he said the president has a deep-seated hatred for white people and the white culture in the U.S.
[00:29:05.625 --> 00:29:07.527]  is on its way to becoming a fascist state.
[00:29:07.947 --> 00:29:14.980]  Beck also labeled White House environmental advisor Van Jones as an avowed communist, well he admits he is, and a black nationalist who took him down.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:20.209]  In early September, Jones was forced to resign after Beck dug up video in which Jones called Republicans bleepers.
[00:29:21.124 --> 00:29:22.005]  Can't say it.
[00:29:22.005 --> 00:29:25.187]  And revealed Obama's appointee signed a petition for 9-11 truth.
[00:29:25.187 --> 00:29:27.408]  And it goes on for page after page.
[00:29:27.408 --> 00:29:30.030]  Well, this is pretty creepy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.671]  Not allowed to criticize Obama.
[00:29:31.671 --> 00:29:33.312]  Have your kiosks shut down.
[00:29:33.312 --> 00:29:36.274]  Banning free speech at the G20 in Pittsburgh.
[00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:38.075]  Trying to forcibly inoculate people.
[00:29:38.075 --> 00:29:40.277]  He has school children under federal curriculum.
[00:29:40.277 --> 00:29:42.038]  Worshipping him coast to coast.
[00:29:42.038 --> 00:29:45.600]  Something out of Malice China or Nazi Germany.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.222]  Wow, I am very honored to be number 24 on the Top 25 Enemies.
[00:29:51.041 --> 00:29:54.942]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.942 --> 00:30:00.943]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.943 --> 00:30:03.943]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.943 --> 00:30:09.284]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.284 --> 00:30:11.325]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.325 --> 00:30:16.326]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.326 --> 00:30:17.246]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.506 --> 00:30:18.627]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.627 --> 00:30:20.508]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.508 --> 00:30:21.589]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.589 --> 00:30:23.790]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.131]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.131 --> 00:30:26.652]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.652 --> 00:30:31.916]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.916 --> 00:30:35.518]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.518 --> 00:30:38.981]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.321 --> 00:30:40.542]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.542 --> 00:30:41.443]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.443 --> 00:30:42.563]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.563 --> 00:30:43.484]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.484 --> 00:30:44.585]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.585 --> 00:30:47.627]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.627 --> 00:30:49.408]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.408 --> 00:30:50.329]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.078 --> 00:31:06.904]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:06.904 --> 00:31:14.472]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:31:14.472 --> 00:31:20.639]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:23.020]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.521]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:25.521 --> 00:31:37.105]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.105 --> 00:31:38.765]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.765 --> 00:31:40.626]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.626 --> 00:31:46.868]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.532 --> 00:31:55.807]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.807 --> 00:31:57.390]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:58.572]  The people strike back!
[00:32:00.356 --> 00:32:03.138]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[00:32:03.138 --> 00:32:04.379]  I've been so sick.
[00:32:04.379 --> 00:32:06.080]  Will the Life Change Tea help me?
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.921]  Our answer is always the same.
[00:32:07.921 --> 00:32:14.045]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water and air are attacking you this very moment.
[00:32:14.045 --> 00:32:19.949]  Fight back with our all-natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[00:32:19.949 --> 00:32:24.452]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[00:32:24.452 --> 00:32:25.873]  We use results.
[00:32:25.873 --> 00:32:29.736]  Life Change Tea's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[00:32:30.616 --> 00:32:31.016]  We're good to go.
[00:33:02.083 --> 00:33:07.108]  All the leaves are brown and the sky is grey
[00:33:10.174 --> 00:33:11.795]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:11.795 --> 00:33:12.436]  to 3 p.m.
[00:33:12.436 --> 00:33:13.216]  We're here live.
[00:33:13.216 --> 00:33:14.578]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:14.578 --> 00:33:28.969]  Joining us, hopping in with an update on his quest for 9-11 truth, his request for the president to read his 20 bullet points in 20 minutes with the president, and his quest to get the media to not distort what he said, but actually debate him on fair terms.
[00:33:28.969 --> 00:33:30.911]  Charlie Sheen joins us.
[00:33:30.911 --> 00:33:32.412]  Charlie Sheen, good to have you here.
[00:33:32.412 --> 00:33:33.272]  Great to be here, Alex.
[00:33:33.272 --> 00:33:33.713]  How are you, man?
[00:33:35.027 --> 00:33:35.987]  I'm great.
[00:33:35.987 --> 00:33:41.870]  I just told you about that I'm on the White House enemies list to quote be taken out politically.
[00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:46.411]  I'm number 25 on, number 24 of 25.
[00:33:46.411 --> 00:33:48.592]  Now what, what, how, how long is the list?
[00:33:48.592 --> 00:33:52.454]  How many, how many names are on there or, or do we even know?
[00:33:52.454 --> 00:33:53.634]  25 people are on it.
[00:33:53.634 --> 00:33:54.474]  Oh, so you're number 25?
[00:33:54.474 --> 00:33:57.195]  I mean, I'm number 24 of 25.
[00:33:57.195 --> 00:33:57.876]  Ah, excellent.
[00:33:57.876 --> 00:33:59.036]  So you just made the cut.
[00:33:59.036 --> 00:34:00.237]  Congratulations, Alex.
[00:34:00.237 --> 00:34:00.917]  That's fabulous.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.621]  Unbelievable.
[00:34:03.621 --> 00:34:11.671]  So these knuckleheads would compile a list of, you know, singling out people that are searching for the truth.
[00:34:11.671 --> 00:34:14.374]  That are asking these clowns to be accountable for their actions.
[00:34:14.374 --> 00:34:15.935]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:34:15.935 --> 00:34:18.038]  So this is the country we live in today.
[00:34:18.038 --> 00:34:19.239]  Fabulous.
[00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:19.760]  Fabulous.
[00:34:21.047 --> 00:34:35.055]  It's amazing, and you know my film that the White House singles out exposes Bush and Obama and just says that Obama's continuing the wars, the Patriot Act, secret arrest, and that we wish Obama would keep his promises, and I guess I get on a list for this.
[00:34:35.055 --> 00:34:37.137]  Yeah, you're not making anything up.
[00:34:37.137 --> 00:34:41.599]  You're just, you know, you're just pointing to the truth, that's all.
[00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:42.119]  Yikes.
[00:34:42.119 --> 00:34:47.863]  I mean, I guess, um, I guess at this point in the game it's better to be on the enemy's list than the friend's list, right?
[00:34:49.402 --> 00:34:49.904]  Absolutely.
[00:34:49.904 --> 00:34:52.797]  If you're on the friend list, you gotta be employed by Wall Street, you know?
[00:34:53.661 --> 00:34:55.021]  Absolutely.
[00:34:55.021 --> 00:34:58.782]  Charlie, let's get into your 20 minutes with the President.
[00:34:58.782 --> 00:35:04.304]  Megaviral all over the web, millions of views, and your message to the President, the video.
[00:35:04.304 --> 00:35:17.787]  The media attacked you, they distorted what you had to say, they never really mentioned your specific bullet points, like six of the ten Commission members saying that 9-11 was a cover-up, a hoax, a fraud, that there should be a criminal investigation.
[00:35:17.787 --> 00:35:18.927]  Right.
[00:35:18.927 --> 00:35:22.848]  I know this has been frustrating for you and I. Can you speak to that?
[00:35:24.195 --> 00:35:32.902]  Well yeah, it's just, it's exactly what we anticipated would happen, that they would attack the man and not the facts.
[00:35:32.902 --> 00:35:41.949]  But it got so blatant that I think they really showed their hand in how they treated it and how they behaved around it.
[00:35:41.949 --> 00:35:48.875]  And I think that sends such a huge message right there, that you and I
[00:35:50.034 --> 00:35:57.300]  Put forth something that they just, as I said before, they couldn't disassemble, so they tried to disassemble me.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.362]  You know?
[00:35:59.362 --> 00:36:00.323]  Absolutely.
[00:36:00.323 --> 00:36:08.250]  And it's a shame because, you know, we're not, you know, we're not naked shouting from the top of a building, come debate us.
[00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:16.697]  We're just, you know, we're issuing a very calm and reasonable offer to just sit down in an open and fair
[00:36:17.358 --> 00:36:20.700]  Debate Forum and hash this thing out.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.982]  And as you and I were talking yesterday, we did get a nibble.
[00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:36.427]  We got a nibble to O'Reilly's credit, but it's odd to put those two words in the same sentence, O'Reilly and credit.
[00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:41.510]  But it's just we haven't reached an agreement on the terms that we set forth.
[00:36:42.794 --> 00:36:50.555]  And this afternoon we're going to be publishing an article at PrisonPlanet.com that I and Paul Watson are going to be putting together and specifically
[00:36:52.308 --> 00:36:55.550]  Now we can tell people what happened behind the scenes.
[00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:58.631]  Larry King Live contacted you, your publicist.
[00:36:58.631 --> 00:37:02.433]  They wanted to have you on, but then they couldn't find anybody to come on and debate you.
[00:37:02.433 --> 00:37:03.673]  That's correct.
[00:37:03.673 --> 00:37:05.754]  From the other side, we have those emails.
[00:37:05.754 --> 00:37:06.755]  Right, right.
[00:37:06.755 --> 00:37:13.578]  We also then, O'Reilly's people contacted and said, yeah, basically come on our show and we'll slap you around and turn your mic off.
[00:37:13.578 --> 00:37:16.599]  Basically, you said no, we're going to be publishing that email.
[00:37:16.599 --> 00:37:18.260]  You said no, we want to do it.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:25.747]  Neutral, where I get one minute, you get one minute, Good Morning America looked at it and then backed off of it.
[00:37:25.747 --> 00:37:38.801]  I guess that's the nibble, because if they actually put you on TV, and I know this would be huge ratings, so there's no reason they shouldn't, except for the fact is we talked about, I'm just paraphrasing, you know, your analysis that I think is spot on, dead on.
[00:37:39.562 --> 00:37:51.974]  That they know your 20 points are too powerful, and they don't want that discussed, and so they're turning down Charlie Sheen, wanting to have a debate on national TV, which any TV producer would kill to have happen.
[00:37:51.974 --> 00:37:58.480]  Well, no, I mean, yeah, I mean, I can't say that, but if you insist, then thank you.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.724]  But yeah, no, but as I said, I just think it's in keeping with
[00:38:04.147 --> 00:38:05.509]  Well, it certainly is.
[00:38:24.451 --> 00:38:31.896]  Now maybe O'Reilly will agree to debate you somewhere, or maybe even agree on his own show to have a moderator in and to have a real debate.
[00:38:31.896 --> 00:38:37.540]  I mean, it would be as big as Vice President Gore debating Ross Perot, I guarantee it.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.943]  I mean, they could definitely sell tickets to this thing, but they are afraid.
[00:38:40.943 --> 00:38:46.687]  They want a one-sided... Well, just like what we saw with Geraldo Rivera when he was on O'Reilly.
[00:38:46.687 --> 00:38:51.590]  I mean, they pulled out every stop, or that other show that they have on in the middle of the night on Fox.
[00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:53.992]  I mean, this was the most brutal, savage,
[00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:59.204]  Attempted character assassination I've ever seen.
[00:38:59.204 --> 00:39:05.691]  Yeah, it was even worse than the first go-around back in March of 06.
[00:39:05.691 --> 00:39:14.442]  It's almost like they were sending a message, you know, we warned you back then and now we're pulling out all the stops this time.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:32.991]  You know, but again, if, you know, 90% of the comments, of the reader comments, and of the viewer comments, everybody, at least 90%, they kept saying, look at his document, look at his facts, look at his data, look at his information.
[00:39:32.991 --> 00:39:35.073]  Stop going after him.
[00:39:35.073 --> 00:39:41.677]  So people, you know, are very much aware of this sham tactic, you know.
[00:39:42.691 --> 00:39:53.196]  Well, in the final equation, tens of millions of people conservatively read your letter, read your bullet points, and it has definitely re-energized 9-11 Truth.
[00:39:53.196 --> 00:39:55.257]  It was still growing, but not as fast.
[00:39:55.257 --> 00:39:58.899]  So I commend you.
[00:39:58.899 --> 00:40:00.379]  You knew you'd be attacked for this.
[00:40:00.379 --> 00:40:01.780]  Of course.
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.381]  Why did you do it in the final equation?
[00:40:07.437 --> 00:40:17.464]  I have to say that the message I was trying to get out was, New President, New Investigation.
[00:40:17.464 --> 00:40:19.526]  I think that's pretty much it at the end of the day.
[00:40:19.526 --> 00:40:23.308]  New President, New Investigation.
[00:40:23.308 --> 00:40:27.812]  And as you said in the letter, you voted for Obama, you believed all the things he said he was going to do.
[00:40:27.812 --> 00:40:30.254]  Has he kept any of his promises, Charlie?
[00:40:32.097 --> 00:40:34.200]  None that I've observed.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:39.510]  If you discover any that were kept, please bring me up to speed, you know?
[00:40:40.017 --> 00:40:42.218]  Believe me, I'd like to find some.
[00:40:42.218 --> 00:40:46.900]  Now he's saying Guantanamo is going to stay open and they're going to set up camps here in the U.S.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:50.161]  Shifting gears here because I know you've got to get back on the set.
[00:40:50.161 --> 00:40:55.883]  You guys are rehearsing for Two and a Half Men, the top-rated comedy TV show right now.
[00:40:55.883 --> 00:40:58.665]  The contest, now we announced a few weeks ago we're going to have it.
[00:40:58.665 --> 00:41:00.365]  Monday is going to be the official date.
[00:41:00.365 --> 00:41:04.007]  Charlie is judge, jury, executioner.
[00:41:04.007 --> 00:41:06.428]  He is the guy that is going to watch the videos.
[00:41:08.153 --> 00:41:11.195]  And people are going to have one month from next Monday.
[00:41:11.195 --> 00:41:15.438]  We're going to have a special website that we're building just for this.
[00:41:15.438 --> 00:41:19.001]  And I'll have the specific rules that Charlie and I are finalizing in the next few days.
[00:41:19.001 --> 00:41:24.885]  But specifically, Charlie, what are you looking for in the winter here?
[00:41:24.885 --> 00:41:32.951]  I'm just looking for the most interesting interpretation of the material.
[00:41:36.137 --> 00:41:51.480]  I mean, I'm not looking for people to turn it into a song, that might be a little much, but I'm just looking for perhaps the most interesting interpretation, the most passionate interpretation, just something that you and I might not have
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:00.344]  Have thought of in imagining what people are going to present, how they're going to construct this thing, how they're going to create it and present it.
[00:42:00.344 --> 00:42:13.971]  And again, you know, people don't have to have to be off book, meaning no scripts in hand, you know, because I mean, I, you know, you and I wrote the damn thing and there's no way you and I could do it memorized.
[00:42:13.971 --> 00:42:18.734]  So it is fine with with the document in hand if it's just read.
[00:42:18.734 --> 00:42:21.155]  But and again, there's no
[00:42:23.258 --> 00:42:31.681]  There's no constraints on race, on sex, on age, on anything.
[00:42:31.681 --> 00:42:36.423]  It's all about just whatever two people decide to sit down and bring this thing to life.
[00:42:36.423 --> 00:42:43.645]  And however they do it, then the one that strikes me as being the most interesting, that's the one that will award to be the winner.
[00:42:44.246 --> 00:42:50.368]  And there's not only the $13,500 prize, because you want people after taxes to get $10,000 very nicely, Charlie.
[00:42:50.368 --> 00:42:54.229]  I was announcing $10,000 and then you corrected me during the break.
[00:42:54.229 --> 00:42:58.751]  You said, well, make it so they get actually $10,000 after taxes.
[00:42:58.751 --> 00:42:59.951]  Second place will get $1,000.
[00:42:59.951 --> 00:43:01.672]  Third place will get $500.
[00:43:01.672 --> 00:43:04.593]  There's a secret surprise as well.
[00:43:06.173 --> 00:43:12.338]  That is going to be done with some of the best videos that we're going to just leave as a surprise until later.
[00:43:12.338 --> 00:43:15.340]  But this is a contest everybody wants to be involved in.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.741]  I want to see hundreds and hundreds.
[00:43:16.741 --> 00:43:18.662]  I know we're going to see hundreds and hundreds of entries.
[00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:22.365]  We've seen hundreds when I have a thousand dollar prize.
[00:43:22.365 --> 00:43:26.528]  And so in closing, I could paraphrase
[00:43:27.208 --> 00:43:37.363]  Your idea, but we're doing this obviously so that there are hundreds of viral videos with the 20 bullet points and people can boil down the 15 pages or so.
[00:43:37.363 --> 00:43:39.526]  They don't have to read the entire document.
[00:43:39.526 --> 00:43:41.469]  Charlie, closing comments on that.
[00:43:42.762 --> 00:43:59.800]  Well yeah, I'm hoping because there's been a bit of a lull since the publishing of the document and the launching of the video, I'm hoping that this brings it back to the forefront and floods the internet with all these new videos and all this new energy and really
[00:44:00.939 --> 00:44:07.820]  You know, is a slap in the face to Google and what they did to YouTube and what they did to that video, you know.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.501]  Yeah, they clearly put the price on it.
[00:44:09.501 --> 00:44:10.181]  It was obvious.
[00:44:10.181 --> 00:44:15.682]  I mean, come on, it was 100,000 views a day and then suddenly it just came to a screeching halt.
[00:44:15.682 --> 00:44:20.083]  It was, yeah, it was a little suspicious to say the least, you know.
[00:44:20.083 --> 00:44:29.045]  Well, Charlie, I'm going to let you get back to what you're doing, but just to give people a little bit of a hint, this video contest is phase two and throughout the future,
[00:44:30.919 --> 00:44:36.201]  Just so people can get a little bit of foreshadowing, we are planning some other interesting things.
[00:44:36.201 --> 00:44:37.122]  Yes, we are.
[00:44:37.122 --> 00:44:37.742]  Yes, we are.
[00:44:37.742 --> 00:44:48.327]  No, this is not... This is a multi-phase project, and phase one complete, phase two is beginning, and phase three will be a big surprise.
[00:44:48.925 --> 00:44:53.809]  And Phase 2 is all about the listeners and the viewers taking action.
[00:44:53.809 --> 00:44:55.190]  We're giving you the ball.
[00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:56.291]  Run with it.
[00:44:56.291 --> 00:44:59.094]  And, again, there's a Phase 2 to Phase 2.
[00:44:59.094 --> 00:45:01.255]  Charlie, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:45:01.255 --> 00:45:01.756]  Not at all.
[00:45:01.756 --> 00:45:02.577]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:45:02.577 --> 00:45:03.597]  I will talk to you soon.
[00:45:03.597 --> 00:45:04.298]  All right.
[00:45:04.298 --> 00:45:04.979]  Take care, my friend.
[00:45:04.979 --> 00:45:05.419]  Okay.
[00:45:05.419 --> 00:45:06.260]  Bye-bye.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:06.460]  All right.
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:07.941]  There goes Charlie Sheen.
[00:45:07.941 --> 00:45:12.285]  Yeah, very... This guy has got a new idea, and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:33.223]  That is much bigger than even the first and believe me now now by the way I ended up staying up late again last night working on the Gardasil stories and researching what's happening with that and because we got so many hundreds of entries I was not going to not watch them all I finally watched all of them I bit off more than I can chew I got behind
[00:45:34.532 --> 00:45:35.973]  I don't know.
[00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:56.433]  I'm going to announce the winners tomorrow.
[00:45:56.433 --> 00:46:02.156]  I'm going to play the three winning videos, but we're going to get another article out today or tomorrow about it.
[00:46:02.156 --> 00:46:03.656]  I just got so far behind.
[00:46:03.656 --> 00:46:04.817]  I bit off more than I can chew.
[00:46:04.817 --> 00:46:05.917]  I try to do too much.
[00:46:05.917 --> 00:46:13.141]  It's like I'm a mule trying to carry up a big bag of rocks on my back up a mountain, and I kind of slid down a little bit, but that's okay because I kicked.
[00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:16.022]  You ever seen a mule when it gets mad when it's trying to climb up a hill or something?
[00:46:16.022 --> 00:46:18.944]  It gets mad after it falls down and kicks back up the hill.
[00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:33.152]  I've done a little bit of cowboying, so I've seen horses and mules and stuff, you know, when they get mad, like they'll, you'll, well, let's be honest, I was always in there with a hot shot or dehorning them and a few times got on a horse but always got thrown off or hurt.
[00:46:33.152 --> 00:46:40.596]  The real cowboys, they'd be in there with these wild steers that have been out on a big ranch for years and never even been vaccinated or dehorned.
[00:46:40.596 --> 00:46:46.260]  They were getting ready for sale and they'd have incredible workhorses and mules and they'd lasso
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:56.023]  You know, one of those cows or bulls and start dragging them in with two horses or one horse and sometimes that horse will get pulled back and you see that horse get mad and just bustles with pound out.
[00:46:56.023 --> 00:47:03.306]  Those horses would just start bucking, dragging a cow twice their size, a bull twice their size, just going wild.
[00:47:03.306 --> 00:47:09.608]  Anyways, that's that's where that analogy comes from of seeing a horse when it gets pissed off.
[00:47:09.608 --> 00:47:10.228]  Just amazing.
[00:47:10.228 --> 00:47:14.510]  I've seen horses drag cattle through fences just getting wild.
[00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:15.330]  Anyway, side issue.
[00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.433]  Real cowboying, folks.
[00:47:17.433 --> 00:47:18.755]  Not the stuff you see at the rodeos.
[00:47:18.755 --> 00:47:19.616]  It's even more vicious.
[00:47:23.544 --> 00:47:25.965]  That's why I want to make a documentary about real cowboys.
[00:47:25.965 --> 00:47:31.228]  Every time I see a documentary about cowboys, it's some guy that lives on some family ranch and wearing a big fancy hat.
[00:47:31.228 --> 00:47:32.849]  I'm sure he's good with a lasso.
[00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:35.810]  But real cowboys are out at 3 a.m.
[00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:37.611]  at the bar drunk as a skunk.
[00:47:37.611 --> 00:47:46.355]  Then they're driving 18-wheelers hauling gravel, and they go out three, four days a week with no sleep and getting fistfights with each other and drag cattle around.
[00:47:46.355 --> 00:47:48.016]  These people are maniacs.
[00:47:48.016 --> 00:47:48.836]  Side issue.
[00:47:48.836 --> 00:47:52.058]  I just wish I could go make documentaries about stuff like that, the things I've experienced.
[00:47:53.888 --> 00:47:55.689]  It's very macho culture, folks.
[00:47:55.689 --> 00:47:56.390]  Very macho.
[00:47:56.390 --> 00:48:03.155]  I mean, you'll just be sitting there, you know, when I was like six... I did it when I was 13, 14, 15, and some when I was 16 on the summers.
[00:48:03.155 --> 00:48:10.440]  You'd be sitting there, and these guys were so testosterone-ed out.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:11.781]  I'm not even gonna tell the story.
[00:48:11.781 --> 00:48:14.283]  People wouldn't believe it.
[00:48:14.283 --> 00:48:17.545]  They wouldn't believe it.
[00:48:17.545 --> 00:48:18.165]  Side issue.
[00:48:19.915 --> 00:48:22.636]  Some things are just better not told, I think.
[00:48:22.636 --> 00:48:25.057]  Actually, people don't believe it anyways.
[00:48:25.057 --> 00:48:26.498]  This weird-ass life I've got.
[00:48:26.498 --> 00:48:29.419]  I'm now on the White House enemies list.
[00:48:29.419 --> 00:48:30.540]  We're getting Megadeth on.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.400]  We've woken up.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.601]  Naming their new album off of Endgame, my film.
[00:48:33.601 --> 00:48:36.663]  A lot of people were pointing that out.
[00:48:36.663 --> 00:48:41.605]  I actually knew behind the scenes it was named after that, but I wanted to let Dave Mustaine say it on air.
[00:48:41.605 --> 00:48:45.587]  I was getting these emails, you lying bastard, Megadeth urinates on you.
[00:48:45.587 --> 00:48:46.367]  They hate you.
[00:48:46.367 --> 00:48:47.588]  And I was like, yeah, right.
[00:48:48.254 --> 00:49:05.892]  But look, it's just a little bit of satisfaction here, in the face of all this danger, to have the White House to be on their enemies list, to see that we're waking up Bruce Willis and Dave Mustaine and Charlie Sheen and Jesse Ventura and Willie Nelson and just countless other people I can't even name here because they want to be private.
[00:49:05.892 --> 00:49:07.774]  People say, oh, what's the matter if you're waking up celebrities?
[00:49:07.774 --> 00:49:09.156]  That's a gauge of society.
[00:49:09.676 --> 00:49:22.101]  And if the celebrities aren't fake right-wingers or fake leftists anymore, and they've woken up to the paradigm, that is just a signpost or an indicator or a thermostat showing you the Mercury's rising for liberty.
[00:49:22.101 --> 00:49:24.302]  And so it's a blessing.
[00:49:24.302 --> 00:49:26.523]  I'm very honored to be on the White House enemies list.
[00:49:27.796 --> 00:49:39.999]  It's just if I get killed in a carjacking or I get found in a hotel room in a clown suit with heroin needles hanging out of me, I don't dress in clown suits or inject heroin.
[00:49:39.999 --> 00:49:41.739]  And I say that because that's the kind of thing they do.
[00:49:41.739 --> 00:49:49.441]  They kill you and dress you like a woman or they kill a woman and kill you and throw them into a pit.
[00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:57.273]  This is the kind of crap, they walk up in a grocery store parking lot and cap you in the back of the head and take your wallet.
[00:49:57.273 --> 00:50:09.220]  And if that happens, to me, because it says Bill Clinton's involved in this, and he runs hit teams, murder teams, don't forget the Clinton Chronicles and all of that, the death list.
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.762]  If they do kill me, remember that is a victory.
[00:50:11.762 --> 00:50:18.806]  Not a victory for me, I mean, I don't want it to happen and I'll never kill myself and I love life so much it's unbelievable.
[00:50:18.806 --> 00:50:18.987]  But,
[00:50:23.482 --> 00:50:26.464]  In the final equation, it means we're hurting the New World Order.
[00:50:26.464 --> 00:50:27.665]  It means we've got power.
[00:50:27.665 --> 00:50:29.366]  It means we're affecting change.
[00:50:29.366 --> 00:50:33.109]  It means they're scared of us.
[00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:41.054]  Man, I walked out on my front porch last night and there were huge orange and red and pink thunderheads with the sunset hitting them, flashing with lightning.
[00:50:41.054 --> 00:50:42.295]  The moon was out.
[00:50:42.295 --> 00:50:43.096]  Jupiter was out.
[00:50:44.295 --> 00:50:52.759]  It was still daylight, but Jupiter and the Moon were out, and it was just so gorgeous, and I could smell the fresh-cut grass and the oak trees, and I just love God.
[00:50:52.759 --> 00:50:59.663]  I love creation, I love innocence, and I'm so thankful for the position God's put me in, the great honor of standing against the beast.
[00:51:00.367 --> 00:51:07.091]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[00:51:07.091 --> 00:51:08.752]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[00:51:08.752 --> 00:51:13.335]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[00:51:13.335 --> 00:51:21.019]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[00:51:21.019 --> 00:51:23.501]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[00:51:23.601 --> 00:51:24.221]  We're good to go!
[00:51:50.511 --> 00:51:51.572]  1-888-329-7064.
[00:51:51.572 --> 00:51:57.376]  1-888-329-7064 today.
[00:51:57.376 --> 00:51:59.698]  To purchase, you must be 18 or older.
[00:51:59.698 --> 00:52:07.124]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.124 --> 00:52:08.746]  The enemy struck America on September 11.
[00:52:09.744 --> 00:52:11.286]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.286 --> 00:52:12.106]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.106 --> 00:52:12.927]  This is his M.O.
[00:52:12.927 --> 00:52:14.469]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:14.469 --> 00:52:16.431]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:16.431 --> 00:52:23.618]  Enabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:23.618 --> 00:52:24.099]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.099 --> 00:52:29.764]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.425 --> 00:52:33.907]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:33.907 --> 00:52:36.089]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:00.287 --> 00:53:03.668]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:53:03.668 --> 00:53:07.569]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:53:07.569 --> 00:53:11.290]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:18.592]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and

[00:54:59.947 --> 00:55:01.768]  What do you mean I hurt your feelings?
[00:55:01.768 --> 00:55:05.889]  I didn't know you had any feelings.
[00:55:05.889 --> 00:55:09.010]  What do you mean I ain't kind?
[00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:11.151]  I'm just not your kind.
[00:55:11.151 --> 00:55:18.054]  What do you mean I couldn't be the President of the United States of America?

[00:56:19.361 --> 00:56:19.861]  Can you?
[00:56:19.861 --> 00:56:22.021]  Can you put a price on peace?
[00:56:22.021 --> 00:56:24.322]  Peace sells, but who's buying?
[00:56:24.322 --> 00:56:26.202]  The New World Order, that's who.
[00:56:26.202 --> 00:56:29.703]  The eugenicists, as the Gardasil deaths mount.
[00:56:29.703 --> 00:56:33.003]  They admit all the poisons and cancer viruses are in the vaccines.
[00:56:33.003 --> 00:56:36.144]  Crank it up!

[00:57:51.082 --> 00:57:52.283]  24 of 25.

[00:58:50.143 --> 00:58:54.383]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.383 --> 00:58:56.384]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.384 --> 00:59:04.906]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:04.906 --> 00:59:10.467]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.467 --> 00:59:12.087]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.327 --> 00:59:18.829]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:29.891]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:29.891 --> 00:59:30.652]  That's right.
[00:59:30.652 --> 00:59:33.212]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.212 --> 00:59:34.813]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:59:36.613 --> 00:59:37.373]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:37.373 --> 00:59:39.355]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:39.355 --> 00:59:39.875]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.286 --> 01:00:08.047]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.047 --> 01:00:09.808]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.808 --> 01:00:11.388]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.388 --> 01:00:12.949]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.949 --> 01:00:17.151]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.151 --> 01:00:21.193]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.877 --> 01:00:36.779]  I will be announcing in the fourth hour today the winners of our last political poster contest.
[01:00:36.779 --> 01:00:40.381]  It's very hard judging them.
[01:00:40.381 --> 01:00:41.942]  But the best man has won.
[01:00:41.942 --> 01:00:46.584]  So we'll tell you first, second, third place coming up.
[01:00:46.584 --> 01:00:48.165]  My head is spinning.
[01:00:48.165 --> 01:00:50.646]  I mean, I am on the White House enemies list.
[01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:52.487]  Bill Clinton running it.
[01:00:52.487 --> 01:00:54.768]  And Bill Clinton doesn't play games.
[01:00:54.768 --> 01:00:58.010]  This is total creep fest going on here.
[01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:59.771]  And then look at these stacks of articles.
[01:00:59.771 --> 01:01:00.471]  This is coming up.
[01:01:01.727 --> 01:01:03.788]  In the fourth hour, I'm gonna start the fourth hour with this.
[01:01:03.788 --> 01:01:10.833]  Schoolgirl 14 dies and three classmates taken ill after being given new cervical cancer vaccine.
[01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:15.356]  And then I have other reports here in the U.S.
[01:01:15.356 --> 01:01:18.478]  of people dying.
[01:01:18.478 --> 01:01:22.281]  Totally creepy.
[01:01:22.281 --> 01:01:25.983]  And we can show you video and photos of the blood pouring out of them.
[01:01:25.983 --> 01:01:28.725]  I don't know if I'm gonna show those, but you can go find them on YouTube if you want.
[01:01:30.912 --> 01:01:50.163]  It's so hardcore that the globalists are carrying out a soft kill operation right in front of everybody and it's come out in the news that it's got the old flu vaccine, the regular seasonal, and the new one has thimerosal, mercury, squalene.
[01:01:50.163 --> 01:01:51.364]  We have the inserts now.
[01:01:53.735 --> 01:01:57.057]  In fact, guys, did you print me that other insert where she'd highlighted it?
[01:01:57.057 --> 01:02:03.740]  You were telling me when I came in that other insert sheet had come in, where it, she talked about it yesterday, here it is.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:08.563]  But we have a bunch of other inserts, too, that I'm gonna go over coming up.
[01:02:08.563 --> 01:02:15.967]  Yeah, here's the insert, and we've got it all highlighted, so we'll give people a close shot of this coming up.
[01:02:15.967 --> 01:02:16.808]  It's just mind-blowing.
[01:02:16.808 --> 01:02:18.689]  In fact, maybe I should just start getting into this this hour.
[01:02:19.767 --> 01:02:22.069]  And it lists that it can hurt your fertility.
[01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:24.450]  It lists that it can cause cancer.
[01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:25.651]  It just listed everything.
[01:02:25.651 --> 01:02:32.756]  And this is the influenza virus vaccine fluvorin, norvitis.
[01:02:32.756 --> 01:02:40.021]  And we've got all that highlighted.
[01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:43.063]  I mean, it's just, it's just unbelievable.
[01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:45.485]  I keep saying unbelievable because this is unbelievable.
[01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:51.262]  Healthcare workers protest state-mandated H1N1 vaccine in Albany, New York.
[01:02:51.262 --> 01:02:53.843]  Meanwhile, the media is saying no one has to take it.
[01:02:53.843 --> 01:02:56.884]  Massachusetts passing laws to forcibly inoculate.
[01:02:56.884 --> 01:03:00.685]  Mass vaccination against swine flu begins in Australia.
[01:03:00.685 --> 01:03:07.207]  We've got another influenza virus vaccine, Fluzone.
[01:03:07.207 --> 01:03:07.987]  Another one here.
[01:03:07.987 --> 01:03:14.409]  It says multi-dose vial contains thimerosal, a mercury derivative added as a preservative.
[01:03:14.409 --> 01:03:14.829]  There's that.
[01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:20.640]  From one of the other vaccine inserts.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:28.482]  Cancer jab alert after girl dies, BBC.
[01:03:28.482 --> 01:03:35.104]  It's just, and then the financial news I've got is all completely off the charts.
[01:03:35.104 --> 01:03:37.005]  And then we've got these reports.
[01:03:37.005 --> 01:03:42.066]  Montana town occupied by private paramilitary security force.
[01:03:45.538 --> 01:03:47.919]  And they've built some weird FEMA camp in this one town.
[01:03:47.919 --> 01:03:54.241]  Steve Quill coming up in 55 minutes to break all that down with us, the latest flu developments.
[01:03:54.241 --> 01:03:56.522]  Oh man.
[01:03:56.522 --> 01:04:03.265]  We've got a video of Tina Tach beaten to death in melee in Chicago as people beat him to death in the street.
[01:04:03.265 --> 01:04:06.686]  This is shot from a iPhone.
[01:04:06.686 --> 01:04:10.788]  And of course they can't call for banning lead pipes and boards they beat him to death with.
[01:04:10.788 --> 01:04:13.469]  Chicago's this crime capital because they've disarmed the public.
[01:04:14.836 --> 01:04:17.578]  And now I guess they'll call for banning steak knives.
[01:04:17.578 --> 01:04:19.780]  England's actually done that.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:25.325]  And butcher knives, clubs, pipes.
[01:04:25.325 --> 01:04:27.106]  They were using pipes and clubs.
[01:04:27.106 --> 01:04:29.789]  I'm going to play that video.
[01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:32.451]  Mandatory flu vaccination splits workers.
[01:04:32.451 --> 01:04:33.672]  Another headline in the U.S.
[01:04:33.672 --> 01:04:35.273]  It's all happening.
[01:04:35.273 --> 01:04:36.714]  Troops are being deployed everywhere.
[01:04:36.714 --> 01:04:36.774]  And
[01:04:42.406 --> 01:04:46.981]  I'm pinching myself trying to wake up from this CrossFit and Outer Limits episode, a 1984 book.
[01:04:49.082 --> 01:04:50.042]  And the Twilight Zone.
[01:04:50.042 --> 01:04:51.443]  I'm gonna come back.
[01:04:51.443 --> 01:04:52.463]  You want some more Megadeth?

[01:05:00.305 --> 01:05:05.627]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.627 --> 01:05:10.148]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.148 --> 01:05:12.429]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.429 --> 01:05:14.050]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:15.090]  There is a solution.

[01:08:37.261 --> 01:08:41.364]  No, I've reached out for you.
[01:08:41.364 --> 01:08:43.045]  Put it in your head.
[01:08:55.991 --> 01:09:25.498]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
[01:09:37.363 --> 01:09:52.166]  We're good to go.
[01:10:29.052 --> 01:10:36.939]  Dave Mustaine, amazing guitarist, amazing songwriter.
[01:10:36.939 --> 01:10:41.263]  Now fully awake to the New World Order.
[01:10:41.263 --> 01:10:42.664]  Thanks to all of you out there.
[01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:13.408]  Can you believe that we are on the White House enemies list?
[01:11:55.208 --> 01:11:56.429]  Again, we are back live.
[01:11:56.429 --> 01:11:58.890]  Look, I'm just going to open the phones up.
[01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:01.171]  Regroup here.
[01:12:01.171 --> 01:12:02.932]  So much news coming in.
[01:12:02.932 --> 01:12:12.857]  Merck teams, national police forces, world government being openly announced, Gardasil deaths, deadly stuff in the flu vaccine now being admitted.
[01:12:12.857 --> 01:12:15.158]  It's all just off the charts insane.
[01:12:15.158 --> 01:12:16.499]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:18.140]  Dave in Kansas.
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.241]  Dave, you're on the air.
[01:12:19.241 --> 01:12:21.422]  Welcome.
[01:12:21.422 --> 01:12:22.502]  Hey Alex.
[01:12:22.502 --> 01:12:22.802]  Hey buddy.
[01:12:24.235 --> 01:12:34.513]  Hey, um, yeah, I got an idea, uh, for how we can start to take apart this police state and all these, uh, provocateur tactics like they're doing at the G20.
[01:12:36.124 --> 01:12:57.749]  Yeah, for those that don't understand a provocateur tactic, briefly, you'll have peaceful demonstrators, the cops will come out, either with hired thugs or themselves, dressed as anarchists, attack the police, burn a trash can, so they can then attack the peaceful crowds and legitimize the announcements of no protest, no congregating allowed in the city of Pittsburgh or the surrounding suburbs of Oakland.
[01:12:57.749 --> 01:13:02.250]  And we have those clips coming up later where the police chief just says, yeah, you're not allowed to protest, you're not allowed to be on the streets.
[01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:07.293]  And so they do that to rationalize and sell their operations.
[01:13:07.293 --> 01:13:11.016]  They commit false flag attacks.
[01:13:11.016 --> 01:13:13.078]  Yeah, and this could even go deeper.
[01:13:13.078 --> 01:13:17.001]  I mean, this could even include 9-11 and other things.
[01:13:17.001 --> 01:13:23.546]  But it's going to take the help of some of the wealthy listeners out there who know who they are, I guess.
[01:13:23.546 --> 01:13:28.090]  But how about some people with some money set up a program
[01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:43.480]  of cash rewards for anybody in law enforcement or military to come forward and sign an affidavit that they committed a crime on the orders of superiors.
[01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:54.075]  I don't think with the laws that you can give cash rewards to people to come to anything but a grand jury or jury.
[01:13:54.075 --> 01:14:04.540]  Those have to be set up under state laws and that would just be a labyrinth of operatives and disinfo and honeypots and setups and people trying to feed you disinfo and burn you.
[01:14:09.679 --> 01:14:23.109]  They would have to be a member of law enforcement or military and they would sign an affidavit saying that they had personally committed a crime on the orders of one of their superiors.
[01:14:23.109 --> 01:14:27.852]  Yeah, the media would say they were being paid to lie, which is what they do, pay informants to do.
[01:14:27.852 --> 01:14:34.077]  How about the police and military come out because of their oath and tell the truth about how they were ordered to tell lies?
[01:14:36.903 --> 01:14:39.626]  That would be good too, I guess.
[01:14:39.626 --> 01:14:47.453]  I just don't see... He's got to do something about this, because nothing gets done, and they just get away with these tactics over and over again.
[01:14:47.453 --> 01:14:56.341]  Dave, I hear you, but... Dave, I hear you, but... It came out in Denver that the police attacked the police in the Denver Post, and the police admitted it, and nobody got in trouble.
[01:14:57.674 --> 01:15:00.135]  That's one point, one case of many.
[01:15:00.135 --> 01:15:01.416]  One example of many.
[01:15:01.416 --> 01:15:08.880]  We need people in Denver to go to the City Council, to go to the grand juries, state and federal grand juries, and call for indictments for that.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.042]  In Canada last year, they got caught staging attacks on police.
[01:15:13.042 --> 01:15:14.203]  The major papers admitted it.
[01:15:14.203 --> 01:15:16.144]  The Royal Mounted Police admitted they did it.
[01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:18.486]  No one got in trouble.
[01:15:18.486 --> 01:15:26.310]  In the G20, the last meeting five, six months ago, what was it, five or six months ago, in England, in London, the police
[01:15:28.618 --> 01:15:34.101]  Got caught beating a man to death delivering newspapers and then covered that up and were caught provocateuring.
[01:15:34.101 --> 01:15:35.382]  No one got in trouble.
[01:15:35.382 --> 01:15:41.825]  In Greece, earlier this year, the police got caught on national TV attacking storefronts to blame it on the protesters.
[01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:44.422]  No one got in trouble.
[01:15:44.422 --> 01:15:46.384]  So, take 9-11.
[01:15:46.384 --> 01:15:52.829]  We have civil admins, FBI translators saying Bin Laden was taking orders until 9-11 from the CIA.
[01:15:52.829 --> 01:15:53.709]  They gagger.
[01:15:53.709 --> 01:15:54.430]  They shut it down.
[01:15:54.430 --> 01:16:00.014]  The media won't cover it, though a few major magazines and newspapers have covered it, but still, it's a tiny amount of coverage.
[01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:08.321]  AP is reporting that Jesse Trinidad, who we're going to get on this week, like that's somewhere here in my stack, that, uh,
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:11.220]  In fact, reprint that for me, guys.
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:12.600]  I'm having trouble finding it in my stacks.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.321]  I cleaned the desk off this morning and still can't find it.
[01:16:16.321 --> 01:16:27.103]  That they've edited the FBI tapes that he got, and he also got FBI documents that they were surveilling Elohim City, run by the Southern Poverty Law Center, who, by the way, is targeting us viciously right now.
[01:16:27.103 --> 01:16:32.044]  There's evidence they've got black ops going against us in Austin.
[01:16:32.044 --> 01:16:34.565]  And that they were in control of it.
[01:16:34.565 --> 01:16:36.645]  I mean, we have all the evidence here.
[01:16:37.608 --> 01:16:39.469]  We have the information.
[01:16:39.469 --> 01:16:41.510]  And I'm not poo-pooing your point.
[01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:46.713]  It's just that people say, oh, wealthy listeners.
[01:16:46.713 --> 01:16:51.736]  The globalists have all the money in the world and the power, and they can barely carry out their operation.
[01:16:51.736 --> 01:16:59.160]  I mean, sure, it would make things easier for us if we had $10 million or a billion bucks or something, but I wouldn't even know how to spend that money and what to do with it.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.861]  Because it's one thing to have money.
[01:17:00.861 --> 01:17:02.382]  It's another thing to implement a plan.
[01:17:03.587 --> 01:17:10.793]  Our plan is to get the truth out and try to get the people active and to get out there on the street and to take action.
[01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:19.079]  My plan is to try to get more good riders in-house that we can trust, but we are isolated in that we have had people try to infiltrate us and bring us down from within.
[01:17:19.079 --> 01:17:20.580]  I mean, this isn't a game, folks.
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:23.822]  We're on the White House Top 25 Enemies list.
[01:17:23.822 --> 01:17:25.564]  I mean, this isn't a game I'm playing every day.
[01:17:25.564 --> 01:17:29.647]  I try to explain this to people.
[01:17:29.647 --> 01:17:32.009]  And, you know, by the grace of God, I'm still alive.
[01:17:32.759 --> 01:17:44.305]  They also don't want to kill me or set me up because they don't want to underline and highlight that I'm telling the truth and I'm the real deal and that I'm a true leader and involved here trying to energize the people.
[01:17:44.305 --> 01:17:49.768]  If they kill me or set me up, that will underline and highlight everything I've said and done.
[01:17:49.768 --> 01:17:59.794]  But they're entering a phase now, and I've told people this, I can clearly see it with what's happening around my office and other things in my life, that they may just say to hell with that and go ahead and blow the hell out of me.
[01:18:01.983 --> 01:18:03.563]  And I've got to steal myself.
[01:18:03.563 --> 01:18:10.265]  I've got to get my spine up and get in position and take my licks.
[01:18:10.265 --> 01:18:15.867]  I asked for this and this is what I want and this is who I am and may the chips fall where they may.
[01:18:15.867 --> 01:18:20.328]  I passed the point of no return a long time ago, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:23.369]  And it is a distinct pleasure to know I'm on the side of good.
[01:18:23.369 --> 01:18:26.330]  It's a distinct satisfaction to know I'm not a coward.
[01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:27.710]  I haven't disgraced my family name.
[01:18:30.117 --> 01:18:31.817]  But I don't have all the answers.
[01:18:31.817 --> 01:18:34.058]  You out there collectively do.
[01:18:34.058 --> 01:18:38.779]  And it's about getting involved and not letting the feds take over your local communities.
[01:18:38.779 --> 01:18:40.960]  So you want to see the solution.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.580]  It's like V for Vendetta.
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:44.201]  Look in the mirror.
[01:18:44.201 --> 01:18:46.481]  We ought to pull up on YouTube that V speech.
[01:18:46.481 --> 01:18:47.962]  He goes, I know why you did it.
[01:18:47.962 --> 01:18:49.302]  You were afraid.
[01:18:49.302 --> 01:18:52.063]  So you gave these men control.
[01:18:52.063 --> 01:18:56.044]  If you want to know who's really to blame, all you have to do is look in the mirror.
[01:18:56.044 --> 01:18:57.644]  And that is all of us collectively.
[01:18:58.891 --> 01:19:06.595]  But, they can kill me, or set me up, or demonize me, or destroy me, or make lies about me, or pull me over and throw drugs in my car, or whatever they do.
[01:19:06.595 --> 01:19:07.776]  You know, they got a playbook.
[01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:20.222]  I don't know what play they're gonna run, but I know they've already run a lot of plays against me, but because we're so clean, and so, you know, paying all the taxes, doing everything right, worst thing I do is speed sometimes, and I'm late getting to work.
[01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:22.043]  Got a little bit of a lead foot there, but, uh,
[01:19:22.844 --> 01:19:26.929]  You know, if they crush me or destroy me, I was a good person.
[01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:34.719]  I'm not perfect, but I did this righteously, and somebody had to stand up for the innocents, and corruption had to be dealt with.
[01:19:34.719 --> 01:19:39.304]  I'm going to take more calls from Sherry, Jonathan, Barbara, Ken, and others.
[01:19:39.304 --> 01:19:41.046]  When we get back on the other side of this quick break,
[01:19:41.767 --> 01:19:43.629]  And then we've got the vaccine news.
[01:19:43.629 --> 01:19:44.910]  We've got the police state news.
[01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:46.152]  We've got the world government news.
[01:19:46.152 --> 01:19:47.673]  We've got the Steve Quayle joining us.
[01:19:47.673 --> 01:19:49.295]  We've got the flu information.
[01:19:49.295 --> 01:19:51.377]  We've got the Gardasil information.
[01:19:51.377 --> 01:19:53.940]  We've got an absolute overload of information.
[01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:56.483]  But your call is straight ahead on the other side of this break.
[01:19:56.483 --> 01:19:58.224]  Infowars.com is the website.

[01:21:55.579 --> 01:22:07.203]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.203 --> 01:22:13.086]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:13.086 --> 01:22:19.228]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:19.568 --> 01:22:21.530]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:23.992]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:23.992 --> 01:22:37.202]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:38.863]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.863 --> 01:22:40.725]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.725 --> 01:22:46.970]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:22:55.896 --> 01:22:57.479]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.479 --> 01:22:58.661]  The people strike back!
[01:23:00.635 --> 01:23:02.636]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:23:02.636 --> 01:23:09.599]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:23:09.599 --> 01:23:17.983]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:23:17.983 --> 01:23:23.905]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:23:23.905 --> 01:23:25.746]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:23:25.746 --> 01:23:27.867]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:23:28.027 --> 01:23:32.452]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:23:32.452 --> 01:23:34.675]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:23:34.675 --> 01:23:42.443]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:23:42.944 --> 01:23:44.845]  We're not in Kansas anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:12.471]  Key information with Steve Quayle coming up.
[01:24:12.471 --> 01:24:15.093]  Let's go to your calls right now.
[01:24:15.093 --> 01:24:17.614]  Welcome to our lives inside the New World Order.
[01:24:17.614 --> 01:24:20.716]  It's not coming, it's here.
[01:24:20.716 --> 01:24:24.298]  Now we march deeper into the breach.
[01:24:24.298 --> 01:24:25.739]  Into the valley went the 5,000.
[01:24:25.739 --> 01:24:33.083]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sherry in Georgia.
[01:24:33.083 --> 01:24:34.204]  Sherry, you're on the air.
[01:24:34.204 --> 01:24:37.526]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:24:37.526 --> 01:24:38.086]  Good, welcome.
[01:24:39.748 --> 01:24:43.151]  Um, with the anti-Fed revolution, and it's Kerry, by the way.
[01:24:43.151 --> 01:24:46.734]  I'm sorry, it says Sherry, oh, Kerry, okay.
[01:24:46.734 --> 01:24:48.355]  That's okay.
[01:24:48.355 --> 01:25:04.928]  With the anti-Fed revolution picking up speed right now, what is your personal view or your personal opinion on, you know, we've had the unusual activity of the Fed now admitting they've hidden gold swap arrangements and things like that.
[01:25:07.307 --> 01:25:08.628]  Well, A, I'm facing a battle at hand.
[01:25:08.628 --> 01:25:11.349]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall, as a great philosopher once said.
[01:25:28.544 --> 01:25:36.133]  I'm calculating every possible destination of their trajectory on how they're going to counter us auditing the Fed.
[01:25:36.133 --> 01:25:43.121]  And an audit, as the Fed has said, will destroy them because they're so criminal and have engaged in so much insider trading and giving themselves trillions of dollars.
[01:25:43.121 --> 01:25:46.405]  It's a consortium of private banks masquerading as government.
[01:25:46.405 --> 01:25:48.307]  Now we've unmasked them as private.
[01:25:49.608 --> 01:25:54.075]  In national polls, the majority of the American people, over 75%, want to audit it or abolish it.
[01:25:54.075 --> 01:25:55.236]  They now know it's private.
[01:25:55.236 --> 01:25:56.698]  We've had that great victory.
[01:25:56.698 --> 01:26:00.484]  Now we've identified the real government, the illegitimate shadow government.
[01:26:00.484 --> 01:26:05.471]  Ron Paul has a plan to monetize it and phase it out and write off the derivatives.
[01:26:06.232 --> 01:26:08.954]  With a partially gold-backed system after we've done that.
[01:26:08.954 --> 01:26:11.296]  Other people have a purely fiat system.
[01:26:11.296 --> 01:26:13.198]  Different variants of that.
[01:26:13.198 --> 01:26:18.762]  We need to have a national debate and education about fiat currency and fractional reserve banking.
[01:26:18.762 --> 01:26:24.127]  And then get the power of the purse nationalized under the Constitution as it's supposed to be.
[01:26:24.127 --> 01:26:25.488]  Just follow the Constitution.
[01:26:25.488 --> 01:26:27.289]  People keep bashing our system of government.
[01:26:27.289 --> 01:26:31.272]  We don't follow our system of government for a good 50 years completely.
[01:26:31.272 --> 01:26:32.854]  In the last 100, they've been phasing it out.
[01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:34.895]  But in the last 50, it's almost gone since the mid-50s.
[01:26:35.976 --> 01:26:42.258]  So, we have to have a restoration of what the Constitution says, and we'll just do what it says.
[01:26:42.258 --> 01:26:48.179]  And then Congress can decide how that's going to be done, and we'll make sure it's not a private bank again that's doing it.
[01:26:48.179 --> 01:26:50.619]  I mean, we had Andrew Jackson fight it and beat it.
[01:26:50.619 --> 01:26:52.880]  We had other presidents fight it and beat it.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.000]  Lincoln had fights with them.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.121]  He issued his own U.S.
[01:26:55.121 --> 01:26:55.561]  currency.
[01:26:55.561 --> 01:26:56.461]  They killed him over it.
[01:26:56.461 --> 01:26:57.781]  That's on record.
[01:26:57.781 --> 01:26:59.402]  So, this is the big issue.
[01:26:59.402 --> 01:27:00.922]  This has always been the biggest issue.
[01:27:00.922 --> 01:27:04.983]  Because if you let these private banks issue imaginary currency and credit and debt,
[01:27:06.184 --> 01:27:11.887]  We will wake up homeless on the continent our forebearers conquered overnight, within a generation, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[01:27:11.887 --> 01:27:13.747]  I'm paraphrasing his quote.
[01:27:13.747 --> 01:27:15.508]  So, audit the Fed.
[01:27:15.508 --> 01:27:17.429]  First things first.
[01:27:17.429 --> 01:27:18.910]  Nationalize it.
[01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:26.193]  And then we can have a specific debate about the legislation and what Congress does with that new system.
[01:27:26.193 --> 01:27:32.536]  I just, you know, fear, you know, just like anybody else, this anti-Fed revolution turning into an excuse for
[01:27:33.272 --> 01:27:36.534]  People who are already in office to push for global currency.
[01:27:36.534 --> 01:27:38.456]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, yeah, global currency.
[01:27:38.456 --> 01:27:39.937]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[01:27:39.937 --> 01:27:43.880]  That is the Federal Reserve's talking point.
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:50.965]  The Federal Reserve hired the Enron lobbyist, the biggest lobbying firm that handles all the big corruption cases, to run their PR.
[01:27:50.965 --> 01:27:58.870]  And they've said the economy will implode, we'll have martial law, the banks will pull the rug out from under us if we don't submit to them.
[01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:59.651]  It's like, uh,
[01:28:00.728 --> 01:28:09.531]  Professor Black in Fall of the Republic talks about, it's like in Blazing Saddles where the sheriff's surrounded and he says, drop your guns or I'll shoot myself.
[01:28:09.531 --> 01:28:10.672]  That's what they're doing.
[01:28:10.672 --> 01:28:15.893]  And they've also put out through our own ranks, they just want to get rid of the Fed to have a new world government.
[01:28:15.893 --> 01:28:17.234]  They just want a global currency.
[01:28:17.234 --> 01:28:19.174]  If we get rid of it, we'll have a world government.
[01:28:19.174 --> 01:28:20.895]  We already have a Bank of the World.
[01:28:20.895 --> 01:28:22.976]  We already have a world government.
[01:28:23.581 --> 01:28:30.287]  They have SDRs and other digital currencies being traded between the private central banks.
[01:28:30.287 --> 01:28:32.609]  They've already gone to digital money.
[01:28:32.609 --> 01:28:34.210]  They're going to have regionalized currencies.
[01:28:34.210 --> 01:28:36.372]  They're already announcing it.
[01:28:36.372 --> 01:28:38.734]  That are units that are controlled by that body.
[01:28:38.734 --> 01:28:40.236]  That's what the G20 is meeting for.
[01:28:40.236 --> 01:28:41.897]  It's already here.
[01:28:41.897 --> 01:28:48.423]  So we have to save our currency, save the dollar, fix it, and get out of the IMF and World Bank and arrest these bankers.
[01:28:50.429 --> 01:29:07.703]  But again, the bankers know that they're fully discredited, so they only pose as patriots to discredit myself, Ron Paul, and anybody else that sticks their head up to try to warn the people about the real system and say, they want to get rid of the Federal Reserve so we can have a world government!
[01:29:07.703 --> 01:29:15.689]  The Federal Reserve is the regional private consortium governorship of the international banking cartel on record!
[01:29:17.674 --> 01:29:19.375]  We already have a global government.
[01:29:19.375 --> 01:29:21.256]  That's what the carbon tax is.
[01:29:21.256 --> 01:29:23.437]  That's what the Tobin tax is.
[01:29:23.437 --> 01:29:27.798]  That's what all these announcements are for and more money to the IMF and World Bank.
[01:29:27.798 --> 01:29:29.279]  We're in a world government.
[01:29:29.279 --> 01:29:31.540]  We're in the New World Order.
[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:34.541]  They already have us under a global currency.
[01:29:34.541 --> 01:29:35.482]  It's bank to bank.
[01:29:36.596 --> 01:29:37.656]  Okay?
[01:29:37.656 --> 01:29:40.917]  They plan on killing the dollar to bring in the new world currency.
[01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:42.018]  Completely.
[01:29:42.018 --> 01:29:46.199]  Instead, we gotta save the dollar and defeat the bankers.
[01:29:46.199 --> 01:29:51.140]  It's very simple, but you're buying their disinfo black off.
[01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:52.520]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:55.061]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.061 --> 01:29:57.742]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.984 --> 01:30:04.006]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.006 --> 01:30:09.331]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.331 --> 01:30:11.372]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:16.376]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.376 --> 01:30:17.297]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.557 --> 01:30:18.678]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.678 --> 01:30:20.560]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.640]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.842]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:23.842 --> 01:30:25.183]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.183 --> 01:30:26.705]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.705 --> 01:30:31.989]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:31.989 --> 01:30:35.572]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.572 --> 01:30:39.035]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.375 --> 01:30:40.595]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.595 --> 01:30:41.496]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.496 --> 01:30:42.596]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.596 --> 01:30:43.536]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.536 --> 01:30:44.636]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.636 --> 01:30:47.677]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.677 --> 01:30:49.878]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.878 --> 01:30:50.878]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.069 --> 01:31:05.376]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.376 --> 01:31:09.902]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:09.902 --> 01:31:12.185]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.185 --> 01:31:13.807]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:13.807 --> 01:31:14.849]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.069 --> 01:31:23.496]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:32:02.993 --> 01:32:10.857]  As the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:32:10.857 --> 01:32:12.278]  Garden in a Can!

[01:33:16.445 --> 01:33:19.306]  We're going back to your phone calls.
[01:33:19.306 --> 01:33:21.306]  We've got Paul Watson about to come on.
[01:33:21.306 --> 01:33:28.328]  I want to, on air, give him the different points I'd like him to incorporate into an article about us being on the enemies list.
[01:33:28.328 --> 01:33:30.488]  Watson is my most trusted apprentice.
[01:33:32.236 --> 01:33:34.597]  Who's off-site, and we got Aaron also doing a great job.
[01:33:34.597 --> 01:33:37.238]  Everybody here just does a wonderful job.
[01:33:37.238 --> 01:33:41.519]  But Paul, so many times I call him on a political issue and I say, what's your take on this?
[01:33:41.519 --> 01:33:43.380]  And it's exactly my take.
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:48.602]  Not because he follows what I say, but because he has the same understanding of the nexus points.
[01:33:48.602 --> 01:33:50.543]  That's why he is so precious to us.
[01:33:50.543 --> 01:33:54.944]  Paul Watson of PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:54.944 --> 01:33:59.626]  I want to go to Paul here in just a moment, but I want to say something about Fall of the Republic.
[01:34:01.161 --> 01:34:12.513]  We were about to release the Obama deception in four days and the FBI showed up here.
[01:34:12.513 --> 01:34:16.877]  Then they started calling people randomly around the office asking about my film.
[01:34:17.884 --> 01:34:19.845]  And asking about my studios.
[01:34:19.845 --> 01:34:28.489]  And we were saying, and we've been given a federal subpoena, and the subpoena said, don't talk about this case while the investigation's open, about somebody on the message board.
[01:34:28.489 --> 01:34:31.430]  And I said to the FBI, I said, I'm gonna have to have you talk to my lawyers.
[01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:34.291]  I said, what does my film have to do with this?
[01:34:34.291 --> 01:34:38.793]  And they started making inquiries about our servers, here at this office and off-site.
[01:34:38.793 --> 01:34:43.955]  And wanted to know where our servers were located, separately from the investigation.
[01:34:43.955 --> 01:34:47.017]  And then, I got some death threats over the film.
[01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:55.726]  And then I got followed a couple times driving home late at night, cars getting up on my tail, coming up threateningly.
[01:34:55.726 --> 01:34:59.629]  And I said, well, I'm really getting a message here.
[01:34:59.629 --> 01:35:01.491]  And of course, I guess they hadn't looked in my file.
[01:35:01.491 --> 01:35:08.817]  When you come at me and try to attack me and intimidate me, I only, it suddenly gives me giant reservoirs of energy.
[01:35:08.817 --> 01:35:09.998]  And so I released
[01:35:11.223 --> 01:35:15.086]  The Obama Deception, three days early, and it's the most viral film I've ever released.
[01:35:15.086 --> 01:35:16.967]  One of the most viral films in internet history.
[01:35:16.967 --> 01:35:21.030]  More than 20 million views that we know of that we've been able to count.
[01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:24.372]  You can order the DVD to have it in your library at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:25.939 --> 01:35:43.385]  Now it's come out in major publications and it came out a few weeks ago that the White House is compiling lists of people attacking them on the internet, asking White House supporters to spy on their neighbors, to make reports on their neighbors, anything quote fishy, anyone criticizing Obama.
[01:35:44.105 --> 01:35:48.407]  It's now confirmed he wanted to give a speech to the kids and enlist them to serve him.
[01:35:48.407 --> 01:35:52.870]  Now we see the curriculum singing, replacing Jesus' name with his name.
[01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:55.492]  Jesus loves all the little children, red, yellow, black, and white.
[01:35:55.492 --> 01:35:57.132]  They are all equal in his sight.
[01:35:57.132 --> 01:35:59.914]  Obama, President Obama loves the children.
[01:35:59.914 --> 01:36:01.355]  They are all equal in his sight.
[01:36:01.355 --> 01:36:02.936]  You know, red, yellow, black, and white.
[01:36:03.877 --> 01:36:05.978]  And now, so many videos have come in.
[01:36:05.978 --> 01:36:08.059]  I've seen... I didn't count them.
[01:36:08.059 --> 01:36:09.760]  It's got to be more than 10 the last day.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:10.961]  We'll try to play a couple today.
[01:36:10.961 --> 01:36:12.361]  Who did I send you those last night?
[01:36:12.361 --> 01:36:12.882]  Do you have them?
[01:36:12.882 --> 01:36:14.202]  Send a couple, I know.
[01:36:14.202 --> 01:36:16.684]  I mean, just they get worse and worse by the minute.
[01:36:16.684 --> 01:36:18.905]  I mean, they're really deploying troops.
[01:36:18.905 --> 01:36:20.426]  They're really setting up a police state.
[01:36:20.426 --> 01:36:22.046]  They're really deploying mercenaries.
[01:36:22.046 --> 01:36:27.369]  He's really talking about 500,000 troops now in Afghanistan, not 50,000.
[01:36:27.369 --> 01:36:30.571]  He's really saying indefinite secret detention of citizens and foreigners.
[01:36:32.964 --> 01:36:36.486]  I mean, it's really happening.
[01:36:36.486 --> 01:36:40.908]  So that said, that's why we released the Obama deception early.
[01:36:40.908 --> 01:36:54.815]  I hope I don't have to release this film early, because by putting it out with the trailers, by building up the momentum, it will be seen by more people and have a bigger effect if I can launch it on October 21st, on that Wednesday, coming up in about 22 days.
[01:36:54.815 --> 01:36:59.257]  But, I've implemented a plan, it's now been uploaded at remote sites,
[01:37:00.285 --> 01:37:01.426]  Ready.
[01:37:01.426 --> 01:37:06.810]  That if I have to, I will pull the trigger any time to release this film.
[01:37:06.810 --> 01:37:09.712]  If I have to.
[01:37:09.712 --> 01:37:13.035]  I will tell you this though, I've gambled on this film.
[01:37:13.035 --> 01:37:20.360]  It's got close to twice the budget of any film I've made.
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:23.183]  I sent 17 flights out with crews.
[01:37:23.183 --> 01:37:25.784]  Sometimes two crews in two different places at the same time.
[01:37:25.784 --> 01:37:28.787]  Went to Canada, California, Florida, New York, Washington.
[01:37:31.044 --> 01:37:36.889]  Ohio, the list goes on and on to have these interviews in the film.
[01:37:36.889 --> 01:37:42.013]  Fall of the Republic is a quantum level above the Obama deception.
[01:37:42.013 --> 01:37:48.058]  You want to understand the mind control, the police state, how the banks did it, what the new rule order is, what their master plan is.
[01:37:48.058 --> 01:37:54.944]  Pre-order the DVD today and your DVDs will ship in the order that your order came in.
[01:37:55.945 --> 01:37:58.526]  And the powerful extras that are at the end as well.
[01:37:58.526 --> 01:38:04.789]  Regardless, we need your financial support, and you support us by buying the DVDs at InfoWars.com.
[01:38:04.789 --> 01:38:07.290]  I want to thank everybody that has bought the books and t-shirts and materials.
[01:38:07.290 --> 01:38:08.711]  That's how we fund this operation.
[01:38:08.711 --> 01:38:13.833]  We're not like George Soros that has banker bailout money and uses it against the American people to quell free speech.
[01:38:13.833 --> 01:38:20.657]  We're not like the government buying tens of billions of dollars in fake newscasts and product placement and messages and sitcoms and dramas.
[01:38:20.657 --> 01:38:21.597]  We don't have that.
[01:38:21.597 --> 01:38:23.298]  We're a tiny ragtag band
[01:38:24.881 --> 01:38:31.006]  And we need you to fuel our weapons system in the InfoWars and you do that when you buy the books and videos.
[01:38:31.006 --> 01:38:32.087]  So pre-order.
[01:38:32.087 --> 01:38:36.911]  We've got discounts where you can get some of the other films at half off or in one case 75% off.

[01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:54.312]  You can also write to me, the film is $19.95, $5 shipping and handling, to P.O.
[01:38:54.312 --> 01:38:55.253]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[01:38:55.253 --> 01:38:55.533]  P.O.
[01:38:55.533 --> 01:38:56.433]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[01:39:12.176 --> 01:39:20.240]  And we're opening up our solar panels to the people to energize us so we can then build up another burst in the info war at the enemy.
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:23.121]  And make no mistake, we're on the White House enemies list.
[01:39:23.121 --> 01:39:25.762]  Of the 25, we're listed.
[01:39:25.762 --> 01:39:27.663]  Alex Jones for the Obama deception.
[01:39:28.743 --> 01:39:36.326]  Obama has called top bloggers, one guy that made the thing where he plays the part of Thomas Paine, he talks about the country.
[01:39:36.326 --> 01:39:38.827]  That guy on the news got summoned to the White House.
[01:39:38.827 --> 01:39:41.729]  Obama summons bloggers and viral video makers.
[01:39:41.729 --> 01:39:44.130]  And this guy's getting summoned for a million views.
[01:39:44.130 --> 01:39:46.271]  We're 20 million views, at least, for Obama deception.
[01:39:46.271 --> 01:39:48.892]  You better believe they're aware of it and upset.
[01:39:48.892 --> 01:39:51.913]  And now that's proven, specifically from White House sources.
[01:39:51.913 --> 01:39:53.414]  And then this was leaked.
[01:39:53.414 --> 01:39:55.995]  And this article was written to make it sound legitimate.
[01:39:58.687 --> 01:40:05.790]  And I am on the list, and I want to bring Paul Watson up right now.
[01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:13.974]  Paul, what is your view on us being on the enemies list now?
[01:40:13.974 --> 01:40:26.259]  Well, the thing about this, Alex, is the fact that Obama and Pelosi have an enemies list was reported weeks ago, and in the case of Pelosi, months ago.
[01:40:27.811 --> 01:40:40.818]  In fact, the White House encouraged people to inform on Americans and snitch on the biggest enemy to Obama's political agenda, and that was in U.S.
[01:40:40.818 --> 01:40:41.818]  News & World Report.
[01:40:41.818 --> 01:40:49.882]  And that was a form of enlisting the people to be spies, but also to create a focus group to find out who was getting snitched on the most.
[01:40:49.882 --> 01:40:50.682]  I'm sorry, U.S.
[01:40:50.682 --> 01:40:51.583]  News & World Report, go ahead.
[01:40:52.557 --> 01:41:01.603]  Yeah, and then Politico and CBS News also reported in March that Pelosi also keeps the political enemies list.
[01:41:01.603 --> 01:41:07.887]  And Politico also reported that Obama kept one, also in March of this year.
[01:41:07.887 --> 01:41:11.689]  So it's widely acknowledged that these lists are kept.
[01:41:11.689 --> 01:41:19.234]  You talked about Clinton keeping lists of his enemies earlier, of which Vince Foster was undoubtedly one.
[01:41:19.234 --> 01:41:20.275]  We know what happened to him.
[01:41:21.485 --> 01:41:28.969]  But the thing about the Globe is that people will just dismiss it as the Canadian version of the National Enquirer.
[01:41:28.969 --> 01:41:37.633]  Which is fair enough, but the fact is, the fact that Obama's got an enemies list is widely reported by numerous other credible sources.
[01:41:37.633 --> 01:41:40.314]  Well they're saying they got this from a White House source.
[01:41:40.314 --> 01:41:41.915]  We know they have enemies lists.
[01:41:42.935 --> 01:41:44.476]  Yeah, I mean, that's well documented.
[01:41:44.476 --> 01:41:46.056]  I mean, you talked about that for years.
[01:42:05.885 --> 01:42:29.600]  So yeah, it's on the record that they keep these lists and it's no surprise that you'd be on it because the Obama deception blows wide open the left-right paradigm and how Obama is just another puppet for the international banking syndicate, the same ones that controlled Bush and his policies since he was elected have proven that to the nth degree.
[01:42:30.168 --> 01:42:37.414]  Did you know that I'm the only person on the list that isn't a fake right-wing neocon?
[01:42:37.414 --> 01:42:48.802]  We're the only person, it's Limbaugh and Beck and all these other people, Michelle Malkin, we're ahead of her on the list, who only attack him from a glancing angle.
[01:42:48.802 --> 01:42:56.829]  We directly go to the fact that he lied about everything and as citizens we have a right to do this and that's why they've created these enemies list
[01:42:57.745 --> 01:43:12.169]  That's why they told our cameramen you're going to be put on a terror list and laughed at them in Pittsburgh when the police tried to set them up with the army because this is the new America where we all go on lists and if we give into this chilling effect it's over.
[01:43:12.169 --> 01:43:22.032]  Well I mean this goes back to Bosch when the White House had a policy that was later made public by Bosch which was to treat
[01:43:22.754 --> 01:43:37.382]  Quote conspiracy theorists who put out theories about 9-11 which don't agree with the official story as quote terrorist recruiters and that they should be attacked and maligned and we saw that happen imminently after so
[01:43:38.092 --> 01:43:50.901]  I mean, then you've got the DHS document that lists alternative media or people who simply disagree with the official version of any given story to be potentially dangerous, potentially domestic terrorists.
[01:43:50.901 --> 01:43:55.085]  So, it stretches back further than Obama having a list.
[01:43:55.085 --> 01:44:00.829]  I mean, it's what cops and Homeland Security agents are being told is the new enemy in America.
[01:44:02.116 --> 01:44:05.718]  Well, the Globe is in England, it's in the U.S., it's in Canada.
[01:44:05.718 --> 01:44:10.162]  It is one of the biggest periodicals, and it's one of the more serious ones.
[01:44:10.162 --> 01:44:11.763]  It doesn't do a lot of the space alien stuff.
[01:44:11.763 --> 01:44:17.947]  It's got Burt Reynolds dying, Swayze Widows, agony, rigged.
[01:44:17.947 --> 01:44:26.573]  It's got, but the big cover story, this is the cover story right now, is 25 Enemies Obama Wants to Silence.
[01:44:27.649 --> 01:44:35.237]  And this is, you know, it came out about John Edwards in this publication and the Inquirer about his love child and all his lies there.
[01:44:35.237 --> 01:44:38.421]  I have no doubt that this is an accurate report.
[01:44:38.421 --> 01:44:40.523]  Obama's secret enemies list revealed.
[01:44:40.523 --> 01:44:44.247]  25 names that the President wants to silence and why.
[01:44:44.247 --> 01:44:47.251]  And again, I don't use drugs.
[01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:50.456]  I hardly ever drink.
[01:44:50.456 --> 01:44:54.099]  I kind of, you know, go six months without drinking and then spend a month drinking.
[01:44:54.099 --> 01:44:56.600]  Not even that heavily.
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:58.862]  I go off and on cigars.
[01:44:58.862 --> 01:45:01.323]  It's pretty gross, but chewing tobacco and cigarettes.
[01:45:01.323 --> 01:45:04.725]  I like anything tobacco.
[01:45:04.725 --> 01:45:06.446]  I speed.
[01:45:06.446 --> 01:45:09.088]  I race around in my car sometimes.
[01:45:09.088 --> 01:45:10.149]  I'm faithful to my wife.
[01:45:11.601 --> 01:45:12.782]  I don't do anything criminal.
[01:45:12.782 --> 01:45:15.203]  We overpay the phony taxes of the Federal Reserve.
[01:45:15.203 --> 01:45:17.604]  I have outside accounting firms in here.
[01:45:17.604 --> 01:45:31.011]  We try to keep our nose completely clean, Paul, and I don't want to give our enemies any attention, but they're clearly pulling out all the stops against us with foundation money, attacking us from the grassroots and the top, and I just want listeners to know that's being done because we're effective.
[01:45:31.011 --> 01:45:33.452]  Paul Watson.
[01:45:33.452 --> 01:45:37.834]  Yeah, and I mean, we've been attacked from the left most recently.
[01:45:37.834 --> 01:45:41.376]  I mean, their attention span and their memory is
[01:45:42.142 --> 01:46:06.558]  About as short as, you know, it's so finite, because we get attacked by people like ThinkProgress for being right-wing extremists, when on their own website, because they're owned by a different organization, a larger organization, it says that their mission is to push the political agenda of the Obama White House, and then they accuse us of being part of that.
[01:46:07.202 --> 01:46:10.604]  Well it's incredible to be a cover story in one of the biggest
[01:46:28.906 --> 01:46:35.532]  On the stand, newsstand publications, Obama's secret enemies list, and we're on it.
[01:46:35.532 --> 01:46:37.233]  Very, very creepy, Watson.
[01:46:37.233 --> 01:46:41.297]  I want to go back to calls, but I wanted to make sure you were on the same page and you are.
[01:46:41.297 --> 01:46:54.589]  Show all the admissions of his enemies list, show how they wanted to get people tattling on their neighbors, the kids serving him, how they're putting people on watch lists, how they want to put conservatives on no-gun-by lists with no judge or jury.
[01:46:56.032 --> 01:47:05.659]  There's a lot of other points I meant to make when I got you on the line, but I've misplaced them mentally there, but it'll come out of the file cabinet here in a second.
[01:47:05.659 --> 01:47:19.610]  It's just that we are the subject of intimidation, we are the subject of attacks, we know this stuff is going on, and it is very, very creepy to have this going on.
[01:47:19.610 --> 01:47:21.732]  Anything else?
[01:47:21.732 --> 01:47:24.334]  Oh yeah, again, for people who will attack the credibility, I mean,
[01:47:24.986 --> 01:47:28.747]  These tabloid periodicals sometimes break big stories.
[01:47:28.747 --> 01:47:34.128]  There's a reason why the National Enquirer got sent anthrax after 9-11.
[01:47:34.128 --> 01:47:37.129]  It didn't happen by accident, and we know where the anthrax led back to.
[01:47:37.129 --> 01:47:40.850]  They published the Bush daughters falling down drunk on 6th Street in Austin.
[01:47:40.850 --> 01:47:41.510]  Yeah.
[01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:48.072]  And then you've got all the other admissions from CBS, Politico, US News & World Report that these enemies lists are kept.
[01:47:48.072 --> 01:47:50.132]  So that's documented.
[01:47:50.132 --> 01:47:51.813]  Well, I hope I don't get anthrax in the mail.
[01:47:53.939 --> 01:47:56.363]  Well, I won't put anything past them, but hopefully not now.
[01:48:03.595 --> 01:48:05.516]  Well certainly not, because I mean,
[01:48:34.139 --> 01:48:45.684]  I'm getting a lot of emails from black people who voted for Obama and are now, because of the Obama deception and what we've done since, completely awoken to the true paradigm.
[01:48:45.684 --> 01:48:49.785]  So we're reaching the target audience that we need to reach.
[01:48:49.785 --> 01:48:51.506]  We're not preaching to the choir anymore.
[01:48:51.506 --> 01:48:56.748]  We're going out and finding those people that need to be brought out of their sleep.
[01:48:57.435 --> 01:48:58.075]  Well, let's be clear.
[01:48:58.075 --> 01:49:00.596]  We were never preaching to the choir.
[01:49:00.596 --> 01:49:02.117]  That's another false attack.
[01:49:02.117 --> 01:49:03.057]  Oh, you're not effective.
[01:49:03.057 --> 01:49:05.258]  Oh, you're not reaching anybody.
[01:49:05.258 --> 01:49:10.520]  We've always, through our listeners, been reaching more and more people, but now we are growing exponentially.
[01:49:11.514 --> 01:49:15.838]  And with great power, as Spider-Man says, comes great responsibility.
[01:49:15.838 --> 01:49:18.780]  And it is a very daunting task, Watson.
[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:27.228]  I just want to point out, I have my First Amendment, I have my rights, and coming after us is the type of thing that will bring these criminals down.
[01:49:27.228 --> 01:49:31.712]  And I'm kind of proud to be on the list, but I also don't like it.
[01:49:31.712 --> 01:49:35.115]  I would have been just as glad not to be on the list.
[01:49:37.921 --> 01:49:51.368]  I would tie it into the no-fly list and the watch list and what they told our crew, and how this is the total secret police system here in the United States, and there needs to be a congressional investigation of these criminal activities.
[01:49:51.368 --> 01:49:57.291]  Because it's admitted Pelosi has an enemy's list, she's admitted to that, and these people are just outrageous.
[01:49:57.291 --> 01:49:59.952]  And Clinton, the Bushes would kind of ignore you.
[01:49:59.952 --> 01:50:07.196]  They were so arrogant, they would just kill third world populations, stage terror attacks to get their operation going, and are so arrogant, they would, I mean,
[01:50:08.163 --> 01:50:14.929]  The head of the Bush family, George Herbert Walker Bush's wife, Barbara Bush, sat on Larry King Live.
[01:50:14.929 --> 01:50:19.173]  She said, if you talk about my family or mess with my grandchildren, I will kill you!
[01:50:19.173 --> 01:50:20.014]  And King said, what do you mean?
[01:50:20.014 --> 01:50:21.295]  She said, what I just said will kill you.
[01:50:22.267 --> 01:50:23.588]  And the Bushes are like mafia.
[01:50:23.588 --> 01:50:24.569]  They have mafia rules.
[01:50:24.569 --> 01:50:26.430]  They say, you mess with our family.
[01:50:26.430 --> 01:50:33.436]  That's why one time Kevin Booth at his wife's 40th birthday, we're at a steakhouse and there are the Bush daughters drunk with these heavy meddlers.
[01:50:33.436 --> 01:50:34.817]  He goes, let me go get the camera out of my car.
[01:50:34.817 --> 01:50:36.778]  And I said, dude, don't sign your death warrant.
[01:50:36.778 --> 01:50:38.440]  Leave them alone.
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:39.961]  Let's mess with George W. Bush.
[01:50:39.961 --> 01:50:40.541]  It was right up 9-11.
[01:50:40.541 --> 01:50:42.122]  They had federal marshals guarding them.
[01:50:42.122 --> 01:50:42.943]  Federal marshals came over.
[01:50:42.943 --> 01:50:43.584]  So they were fans.
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:46.342]  You know, we're not messing with their families.
[01:50:46.342 --> 01:50:47.423]  Don't mess with our families.
[01:50:47.423 --> 01:50:49.945]  The problem is the Clintons, they don't have any rules.
[01:50:49.945 --> 01:50:51.827]  They go after families, kids.
[01:50:51.827 --> 01:50:53.848]  They're just absolute scum.
[01:50:53.848 --> 01:50:57.852]  Hard to believe they're even worse than Bush, but at least he has some mafia morals here.
[01:50:57.852 --> 01:50:58.573]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:58.573 --> 01:50:59.213]  Thank you, Watson.
[01:50:59.213 --> 01:50:59.894]  Get us a good report.
[01:51:00.214 --> 01:51:01.315]  Another report I gotta call you about.
[01:51:01.315 --> 01:51:04.638]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[01:51:04.638 --> 01:51:06.660]  Now going green can save money.
[01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:12.224]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[01:51:12.224 --> 01:51:20.251]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[01:51:20.251 --> 01:51:26.937]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical
[01:51:26.937 --> 01:51:27.377]  We're good to go.
[01:51:54.639 --> 01:51:56.981]  That's 208-772-4514.
[01:51:56.981 --> 01:52:01.343]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[01:52:01.343 --> 01:52:07.067]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:52:07.067 --> 01:52:08.388]  And we knew what to do.
[01:52:08.388 --> 01:52:10.389]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:52:10.389 --> 01:52:17.414]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:52:17.414 --> 01:52:24.138]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[01:52:24.824 --> 01:52:25.984]  We're safe to breathe.
[01:52:25.984 --> 01:52:28.665]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:28.665 --> 01:52:31.246]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:43.951]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:52:43.951 --> 01:52:46.492]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[01:53:06.167 --> 01:53:19.615]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert urging you to go to Fluscam.com and learn the secrets behind the current flu, who's behind it, the labs it came from, and the vaccine poisons.
[01:53:19.615 --> 01:53:31.203]  Learn why Barack Obama's Science R recommends vaccinations to sterilize people to reduce populations, and why OxySilver is making vaccinations and toxic antibiotics unnecessary.
[01:53:31.983 --> 01:53:35.086]  OxySilver is far safer than colloidal silvers.
[01:53:35.086 --> 01:53:42.972]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting you and your family, it has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[01:53:42.972 --> 01:53:48.516]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.
[01:53:48.516 --> 01:53:51.658]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[01:53:51.658 --> 01:53:54.621]  Call toll-free 888-KO-GERMS.
[01:53:54.621 --> 01:53:57.283]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:53:57.283 --> 01:53:58.764]  Order OxySilver today.
[01:53:58.764 --> 01:54:00.025]  This call could save your life.
[01:54:06.562 --> 01:54:17.405]  Here come old Flattop, he come grooving up slowly.
[01:54:17.405 --> 01:54:23.286]  He got juju eyeball, he want holy roller.
[01:54:23.286 --> 01:54:27.887]  He got hair down to his ears.
[01:54:37.145 --> 01:54:39.307]  We're going toe-to-toe up against the New World Order.
[01:54:39.307 --> 01:54:44.871]  Let's talk to Jonathan in Kansas, then Barbara, Ken, Paul, Edward, and others.
[01:54:44.871 --> 01:54:45.872]  You're on the air.
[01:54:45.872 --> 01:54:48.434]  Go ahead, Jonathan.
[01:54:48.434 --> 01:54:49.314]  Hey, Alex.
[01:54:49.314 --> 01:54:51.596]  I've been a fan of you for a while.
[01:54:51.596 --> 01:54:58.041]  Have you heard of the census worker out of London, Kentucky?
[01:54:58.041 --> 01:55:00.223]  Not London, England, but London, Kentucky.
[01:55:00.223 --> 01:55:00.563]  No, no, no.
[01:55:00.563 --> 01:55:00.863]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:00.863 --> 01:55:01.524]  I've talked about it.
[01:55:01.524 --> 01:55:06.307]  I mean, go ahead and make your point and then I'll make mine.
[01:55:06.307 --> 01:55:06.488]  Right.
[01:55:07.952 --> 01:55:16.560]  He was hanged and mostly naked and when they found him on his chest, it spread.
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:19.783]  So, I think... Do you know what happens?
[01:55:19.783 --> 01:55:22.385]  I mean, let me just tell you.
[01:55:22.385 --> 01:55:31.994]  You're calling from Kansas, but I would imagine you know about Tennessee and areas of Kentucky and Alabama and Texas and even upstate New York.
[01:55:32.791 --> 01:55:40.676]  That if you go in there around those people's marijuana crops or their whiskey stills, that's where it comes from, that's where the culture comes from, they will kill you.
[01:55:40.676 --> 01:55:47.039]  I got out when I was going to Bohemian Grove one year, 2003 to cover it.
[01:55:47.039 --> 01:55:54.404]  I got out in the middle of nowhere to urinate up against a tree and about 200 yards away back in the woods was a shack.
[01:55:55.438 --> 01:55:57.799]  And somebody said, get the hell away from my land.
[01:55:57.799 --> 01:56:00.901]  And I said, I'm just over here stopping by the road.
[01:56:00.901 --> 01:56:02.062]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:02.062 --> 01:56:02.942]  Boom!
[01:56:02.942 --> 01:56:04.043]  Shotgun!
[01:56:04.043 --> 01:56:10.687]  And the shotgun pellets went through the leaves and were falling down on top of me because they shot from 100, 150 yards, whatever, away.
[01:56:10.687 --> 01:56:12.288]  They didn't have a lot of power.
[01:56:12.288 --> 01:56:13.548]  And I got in my car.
[01:56:13.548 --> 01:56:18.451]  Kevin Booth was with me because we went and shot some of the footage that you see in Order of Death.
[01:56:18.451 --> 01:56:21.053]  And we got in the car and sped off all these windy roads.
[01:56:21.713 --> 01:56:26.237]  Because it might be 30 minutes in those hills till you get to a bathroom or a restaurant.
[01:56:26.237 --> 01:56:28.259]  So, let me just tell people.
[01:56:28.259 --> 01:56:35.745]  They're going to try to spin this and demonize people that said the census workers are violating the 5th Amendment, making people answer how many guns do they have.
[01:56:35.745 --> 01:56:38.988]  You know, these 100 plus questionnaires they're giving some people.
[01:56:38.988 --> 01:56:40.249]  They have different versions.
[01:56:40.249 --> 01:56:42.811]  Some have 5 questions, some have 49, some have 120 something.
[01:56:42.811 --> 01:56:46.494]  I've gotten the 49 question one before and this time got the 100 plus question one.
[01:56:50.183 --> 01:56:51.783]  And so, yes, they're trying to spin it.
[01:56:51.783 --> 01:56:56.024]  Oh my God, the Patriot movement's in trouble if somebody killed this guy.
[01:56:56.024 --> 01:57:05.586]  He's in an area, and again, these areas of Tennessee and Kentucky, where they will kill you in a minute.
[01:57:05.586 --> 01:57:07.426]  Go ahead.
[01:57:07.426 --> 01:57:11.887]  Right, yeah, my point exactly.
[01:57:11.887 --> 01:57:17.288]  You know, I just thought it may seem like they're trying to point this at, they mentioned
[01:57:18.237 --> 01:57:23.374]  There wasn't no real major anti-government, you know, sentiments but...
[01:57:24.224 --> 01:57:29.008]  The fact that they brought it up, I always thought that... Yeah, they're looking for anything.
[01:57:29.008 --> 01:57:31.490]  They can kill 1,300,000 Iraqis.
[01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:36.834]  The police can rubber bullet a girl in the face for the Red Sox and kill her and they don't get in trouble.
[01:57:36.834 --> 01:57:39.256]  They can shoot us and kill us all the time.
[01:57:39.256 --> 01:57:41.759]  And then they're out there getting pushy with hillbillies.
[01:57:41.759 --> 01:57:43.740]  Hillbillies will kill you!
[01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:45.221]  I mean, anybody knows that.
[01:57:45.221 --> 01:57:49.105]  Anybody knows you don't get off the dirt roads in many areas of the South?
[01:57:49.765 --> 01:57:51.566]  I mean, I grew up being told that.
[01:57:51.566 --> 01:57:55.426]  You don't go near Hillbilly's property, they will kill you.
[01:57:55.426 --> 01:57:58.627]  Period.
[01:57:58.627 --> 01:58:01.428]  And they're sending him into the woods to people's shacks.
[01:58:01.428 --> 01:58:04.849]  He could have been killed by a mentally ill Vietnam vet.
[01:58:04.849 --> 01:58:07.610]  He could have been, I mean, by a felon.
[01:58:07.610 --> 01:58:11.391]  By somebody growing drugs.
[01:58:11.391 --> 01:58:13.371]  And they put a message, don't come in the woods.
[01:58:13.371 --> 01:58:16.032]  And I think it's not good what happened.
[01:58:16.032 --> 01:58:16.892]  But that's what they do.
[01:58:19.465 --> 01:58:21.786]  There's a lot of areas of East Texas you don't go into.
[01:58:21.786 --> 01:58:23.886]  On the border of Louisiana.
[01:58:23.886 --> 01:58:26.647]  A lot of areas of Louisiana you don't go into.
[01:58:26.647 --> 01:58:28.748]  They want to be left alone.
[01:58:28.748 --> 01:58:30.248]  And they will kill you, Dutton and Hammer.
[01:58:30.248 --> 01:58:32.169]  Anything else?
[01:58:32.169 --> 01:58:32.589]  No.
[01:58:32.589 --> 01:58:33.609]  Thank you.
[01:58:33.609 --> 01:58:37.311]  And I... Blackwater and others try to go into these areas, which they're now trying to do.
[01:58:37.311 --> 01:58:43.172]  They're going to be in a lot of trouble.
[01:58:43.172 --> 01:58:45.673]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.673 --> 01:58:47.974]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.237 --> 01:58:55.478]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:55.478 --> 01:58:57.478]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:57.478 --> 01:59:06.000]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:11.542]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:11.542 --> 01:59:13.162]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:13.402 --> 01:59:19.924]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.924 --> 01:59:30.966]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.966 --> 01:59:31.747]  That's right.
[01:59:31.747 --> 01:59:34.307]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:59:34.307 --> 01:59:35.888]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:59:37.848 --> 01:59:39.009]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:39.009 --> 01:59:40.450]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:59:40.450 --> 01:59:40.950]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.590 --> 02:00:08.350]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:10.091]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.091 --> 02:00:11.691]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.691 --> 02:00:12.591]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.591 --> 02:00:17.432]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.432 --> 02:00:22.573]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.573 --> 02:00:24.614]  Major new developments.
[02:00:24.614 --> 02:00:31.935]  We know Blackwater's being used in North Carolina with police in Southern California raiding marijuana dispensaries that are totally legal.
[02:00:31.935 --> 02:00:32.155]  L.A.
[02:00:32.155 --> 02:00:33.476]  Times.
[02:00:33.476 --> 02:00:34.596]  Another mercenary group
[02:00:35.635 --> 02:00:38.977]  The town built this FEMA camp, this detention center.
[02:00:38.977 --> 02:00:42.619]  They didn't know what it was for, barbed wire fences.
[02:00:42.619 --> 02:00:50.783]  Then this group shows up calling themselves American Police Force and says they want all this acreage.
[02:00:50.783 --> 02:00:59.788]  The mayor says we don't know why they're here, why they've put hardened police on their black SUVs.
[02:00:59.788 --> 02:01:01.249]  And all of this is going on.
[02:01:01.249 --> 02:01:04.571]  First hour we played the local news clip where the
[02:01:05.874 --> 02:01:07.815]  Mayor and others are saying, we don't know why they're here.
[02:01:07.815 --> 02:01:10.517]  We don't know why they say they're our police now.
[02:01:10.517 --> 02:01:13.518]  We played it first hour, the audio.
[02:01:13.518 --> 02:01:24.485]  Ladies and gentlemen, as I got Steve Quayle on the line to go live with us, who told me about this last Friday, was desperately trying to call me, before it broke in the news over the weekend, Steve Quayle was telling me about it.
[02:01:24.485 --> 02:01:26.126]  He has the full intel on it.
[02:01:26.126 --> 02:01:31.509]  He lives up there, very nearby, and he has a huge listenership himself in that area.
[02:01:33.425 --> 02:01:34.626]  And he told me it's down.
[02:01:34.626 --> 02:01:35.747]  We went and checked.
[02:01:35.747 --> 02:01:39.350]  It's been removed off the local TV station website.
[02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:42.032]  This is very, very creepy, but we got some screenshots of it.
[02:01:42.032 --> 02:01:42.933]  So did Steve Quayle.
[02:01:42.933 --> 02:01:43.894]  They're at stevequayle.com.
[02:01:43.894 --> 02:01:47.057]  We'll get those added in an update to our Prison Planet article.
[02:01:47.057 --> 02:01:48.478]  Have Watson or Steve Watson do that.
[02:01:48.478 --> 02:01:51.961]  Montana town occupied by private paramilitary security force.
[02:01:51.961 --> 02:01:54.563]  Report pulled.
[02:01:54.563 --> 02:01:59.868]  Steve Quayle, before we get into it being pulled, tell people what's really happening here.
[02:02:00.555 --> 02:02:11.160]  Well, first of all, Alex, around the country, not just in Montana, but specific areas are being identified as staging grounds for not only the foreign troops... Let me interrupt you.
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:14.202]  You told me off-air a month ago and on-air this was going on.
[02:02:14.202 --> 02:02:15.523]  I just remembered that.
[02:02:15.523 --> 02:02:21.306]  You told me they were pre-positioning mercs in your area and you said this was... I'm sorry, black SUVs.
[02:02:21.306 --> 02:02:22.166]  Go ahead.
[02:02:22.166 --> 02:02:26.708]  Well, the black SUVs... You said they were following you when you even took your family fishing.
[02:02:26.708 --> 02:02:29.770]  Well, the bottom line is that I didn't take my family fishing, but they were strategically
[02:02:30.856 --> 02:02:33.417]  Okay, we said you were in the woods, and then they were... Well, anyways, go ahead.
[02:02:33.417 --> 02:02:49.822]  They were there, and then just recently we had 12 Tajikistan troops, BMWs, these are the same BMWs that you and I talked about meeting... And by the way, the UN admits their main force is Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Egyptian, and Pakistani.
[02:02:49.822 --> 02:02:51.003]  That's their main UN force.
[02:02:51.003 --> 02:02:51.563]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:02:51.783 --> 02:03:09.267]  Right, well listen, the owner of the American Police Force, his real name is Eddie Ali, he goes by a bunch of other names, Jamad Ali, Imad Fazi Ali, and what's interesting is, and the questions swirling around the jail deal, which is, probably you have it on your website, I have it on mine.
[02:03:09.267 --> 02:03:11.208]  They're calling it a jail, it's a giant camp!
[02:03:11.588 --> 02:03:12.289]  Absolutely.
[02:03:12.289 --> 02:03:21.819]  They're downplaying it, and listen, the deal is that some of the officials have been put on leave to put them out of contact, or the people that have made the backroom deals.
[02:03:21.819 --> 02:03:28.045]  This is very similar, Alec, to the Cabazon Indian Reservation deals that went on with the Inslaw Promise software.
[02:03:28.045 --> 02:03:34.712]  What we're seeing here is the full integration of Marcus Wolf, Gennie Primakov, you and I have covered that, you know,
[02:03:34.912 --> 02:03:35.352]  Seven years.
[02:03:35.352 --> 02:03:37.294]  Is this one of the camp operator merc groups?
[02:03:37.294 --> 02:03:37.814]  Yes it is.
[02:04:02.452 --> 02:04:06.235]  But it's probably one of the most lethal camp operator groups.
[02:04:06.235 --> 02:04:09.798]  Now, first of all, too, some stories have said there were three SUVs.
[02:04:09.798 --> 02:04:13.401]  Look, when I post the alert on my website, that's what was posted first.
[02:04:13.401 --> 02:04:14.582]  It was sent to me.
[02:04:14.582 --> 02:04:16.984]  The bottom line is this is from people who live there.
[02:04:16.984 --> 02:04:19.186]  There are people saying, well, I don't see any of that stuff.
[02:04:19.186 --> 02:04:20.367]  It can't be true.
[02:04:20.367 --> 02:04:21.228]  I got news for you.
[02:04:21.228 --> 02:04:25.512]  Before you go knocking stuff, we've done our background and our deep pool.
[02:04:25.512 --> 02:04:30.436]  Sources are all saying, look, we know this guy, the guy that owns the company, but we've never seen
[02:04:30.976 --> 02:04:32.056]  We're good to go.
[02:04:52.043 --> 02:04:53.044]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:04:53.044 --> 02:04:56.668]  I've got key intel points that you can verify when we get back.
[02:04:56.668 --> 02:04:58.971]  Steve Quayle, this is mega important.
[02:04:58.971 --> 02:05:00.612]  Foreign merch now operating as police.
[02:05:00.612 --> 02:05:03.976]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:03.976 --> 02:05:07.620]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.620 --> 02:05:12.184]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.184 --> 02:05:13.606]  These emergency backup systems
[02:05:13.826 --> 02:05:16.728]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:05:16.728 --> 02:05:22.832]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.832 --> 02:05:26.454]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.454 --> 02:05:31.257]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.257 --> 02:05:37.841]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.841 --> 02:05:39.782]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.262 --> 02:05:43.463]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.463 --> 02:05:47.964]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:47.964 --> 02:05:50.185]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.185 --> 02:05:50.465]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.465 --> 02:05:51.185]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:06:00.808 --> 02:06:08.555]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[02:06:08.555 --> 02:06:14.640]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:17.303]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:06:17.583 --> 02:06:23.869]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:06:23.869 --> 02:06:27.933]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:27.933 --> 02:06:33.319]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:06:33.559 --> 02:06:35.641]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:06:35.641 --> 02:06:37.382]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:06:37.382 --> 02:06:39.924]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:06:39.924 --> 02:06:44.648]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:06:44.648 --> 02:06:48.351]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:06:48.351 --> 02:06:51.473]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:51.473 --> 02:06:53.375]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:53.375 --> 02:06:55.496]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:07:01.104 --> 02:07:04.107]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.107 --> 02:07:09.452]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.452 --> 02:07:11.493]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.493 --> 02:07:16.498]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.498 --> 02:07:17.419]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.659 --> 02:07:18.780]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:20.681]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.681 --> 02:07:21.742]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.742 --> 02:07:23.943]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.943 --> 02:07:25.284]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.284 --> 02:07:26.825]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.825 --> 02:07:32.089]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.089 --> 02:07:35.671]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.671 --> 02:07:39.154]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.494 --> 02:07:40.715]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.715 --> 02:07:41.616]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.616 --> 02:07:42.716]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.716 --> 02:07:43.637]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.637 --> 02:07:44.738]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.738 --> 02:07:47.800]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:49.981]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.981 --> 02:07:51.042]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:51.042 --> 02:07:51.322]  Big Brother.
[02:08:06.915 --> 02:08:08.678]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:08.678 --> 02:08:10.441]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.441 --> 02:08:12.023]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.023 --> 02:08:13.586]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.586 --> 02:08:17.772]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.772 --> 02:08:21.818]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:22.898 --> 02:08:28.267]  For PrisonPlanet.tv viewers watching the simulcast radio show, we're showing the video of Pittsburgh.
[02:08:28.267 --> 02:08:36.920]  G20 admitted that, quote, secret private mercenaries were dressed up as military, grabbing protesters and throwing them into cars.
[02:08:38.168 --> 02:08:40.169]  We just showed that video, we'll show it again.
[02:08:40.169 --> 02:08:42.030]  Why do I raise this point now?
[02:08:42.030 --> 02:08:45.813]  They admit Blackwater, other groups are going to be used inside the U.S.
[02:08:45.813 --> 02:08:46.373]  The L.A.
[02:08:46.373 --> 02:08:54.338]  Times and the Washington Times both reported in 1993 and again in 1994 that George Bush Sr.
[02:08:54.338 --> 02:09:01.882]  brought in 3,200 plus Iraqi Republican Guard trained in the 80s by the CIA, brought them in out of Iraq.
[02:09:01.882 --> 02:09:05.705]  They were involved at Elohim City with McVeigh and others in the black op.
[02:09:06.425 --> 02:09:11.470]  We know that then Clinton brought in an additional 2,000 plus, over 5,000 total.
[02:09:11.470 --> 02:09:15.995]  We know they're intimately involved with security firms as their cover.
[02:09:15.995 --> 02:09:17.597]  I'm just throwing that nexus point out.
[02:09:17.597 --> 02:09:24.323]  We don't know if this group's associated with that, but we need to track them back to the Iraqis because this is Arab run.
[02:09:26.149 --> 02:09:27.651]  Stopping there.
[02:09:27.651 --> 02:09:29.613]  We have all of this going on.
[02:09:29.613 --> 02:09:34.198]  We have this FEMA center that the town mayor and others were saying, we don't know why.
[02:09:34.198 --> 02:09:35.540]  It was just built here.
[02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:37.402]  They wouldn't say what it was for.
[02:09:37.402 --> 02:09:42.808]  Black SUVs showed up with the term hardened police, which are not part of the police department.
[02:09:42.808 --> 02:09:45.050]  There's a county there, no police in the small town.
[02:09:46.331 --> 02:09:48.072]  They're telling people don't talk about it.
[02:09:48.072 --> 02:09:48.792]  Don't talk to us.
[02:09:48.792 --> 02:09:49.913]  You'll find out what it's for.
[02:09:49.913 --> 02:09:51.634]  Prisoners are about to be here.
[02:09:51.634 --> 02:10:05.340]  From the evidence, Obama said that in Wyoming and Montana, they had built camps that they were going to put the people from Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo Bay in and other black sites in Eastern Europe and Asia, moving them there.
[02:10:05.340 --> 02:10:07.101]  They've also on the news, U.S.
[02:10:07.101 --> 02:10:12.544]  News & World Report, shown a Supermax that's closed in Montana that they're going to put people in.
[02:10:13.044 --> 02:10:15.005]  I believe this should be followed up on.
[02:10:15.005 --> 02:10:19.968]  From the pieces I have, I believe that's what's happening here.
[02:10:19.968 --> 02:10:22.769]  Steve Coyle, you just heard those analysis points for the first time.
[02:10:22.769 --> 02:10:23.429]  Do you concur?
[02:10:23.429 --> 02:10:26.251]  Oh, I absolutely concur, but it's even beyond that, Alex.
[02:10:26.251 --> 02:10:27.211]  Here's the deal.
[02:10:27.211 --> 02:10:28.072]  Recapital!
[02:10:28.072 --> 02:10:28.672]  Recapital!
[02:10:28.672 --> 02:10:29.412]  I'm going to shut up.
[02:10:29.412 --> 02:10:30.353]  Recapital!
[02:10:30.353 --> 02:10:37.156]  Every one of your listeners must go to the internet and type in Cabazon, C-A-B-A-Z-O-N, plus CIA.
[02:10:37.156 --> 02:10:41.959]  And what you're going to find out, you'll find the history of what went on on the Indian Reservation, pardon Montana,
[02:10:42.319 --> 02:10:42.860]  We're good to go.
[02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:09.163]  With that much authority to even go into the Wayback Machine, which is a machine you can check stories out on the internet that have disappeared off of their original host site.
[02:11:09.163 --> 02:11:14.764]  No one has that kind of power except the major intelligence organizations of the United States.
[02:11:14.764 --> 02:11:24.067]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is probably one of the most sophisticated, clandestine, run programs the country in all has to offer.
[02:11:24.908 --> 02:11:26.449]  And we don't even have the video now.
[02:11:26.449 --> 02:11:27.450]  We should have captured it.
[02:11:27.450 --> 02:11:30.852]  In fact, I meant to tell the guys, but they're overworked to capture that.
[02:11:30.852 --> 02:11:32.413]  I had a bad feeling earlier today.
[02:11:32.413 --> 02:11:39.379]  We played the audio, but before we could get to the video, I wish somebody would have, I bet one of our listeners grabbed it to put it on YouTube.
[02:11:39.379 --> 02:11:47.245]  In fact, check YouTube, go to YouTube, type in Hardin Montana Camp.
[02:11:47.245 --> 02:11:48.846]  And I bet it's on YouTube.
[02:11:48.846 --> 02:11:51.408]  The second you see it, get it before they bring it down.
[02:11:51.408 --> 02:11:52.209]  Sorry, go ahead, Steve.
[02:11:52.469 --> 02:12:02.971]  Okay, again, you need to understand that the original owner that's being represented on this whole American Police Force is a guy by the name of Edward Angelino.
[02:12:02.971 --> 02:12:05.811]  He's known by all his aliases, okay?
[02:12:05.811 --> 02:12:19.854]  And all of the names I read to you, the different aliases and spelling them out, obviously he's got a foreign, it sounds like maybe an Iranian, who is the spokesman for the attorney for the group that just came on
[02:12:20.574 --> 02:12:21.235]  30 days to go.
[02:12:21.235 --> 02:12:31.523]  So what we're trying to do, Alex, is you and I are trying to give the listeners, our cooperative listeners, meaning those that are all... The intel patterns to follow to get us the info.
[02:12:31.523 --> 02:12:32.424]  Absolutely.
[02:12:32.424 --> 02:12:39.490]  And the thing is, is that the idea is that every single... Now here's, ladies and gentlemen, we're teaching you something, and this is critical.
[02:12:39.490 --> 02:12:42.092]  All of the addresses are virtual addresses, Alex.
[02:12:43.383 --> 02:12:48.110]  That was admitted in the local news that it's a shadowy group based by the White House.
[02:12:48.110 --> 02:12:48.551]  Right.
[02:12:48.551 --> 02:12:55.741]  I'm getting emails asking me... By the way, that address is very close to the Iraqi Friends Committee, the group with Chalabi.
[02:12:55.741 --> 02:12:56.743]  I noticed that this morning.
[02:12:57.065 --> 02:12:58.266]  Yeah, well, here's the thing.
[02:12:58.266 --> 02:13:00.708]  Let's spell it out really simply.
[02:13:00.708 --> 02:13:03.090]  They anticipate an event, a false flag.
[02:13:03.090 --> 02:13:06.092]  It will either be nuclear or the vaccination biological.
[02:13:06.092 --> 02:13:13.678]  By the way, we posted the story, I'm sure you're aware of it, that the Canadians have come out and said the H1N1 vaccine is initiating the flu.
[02:13:13.678 --> 02:13:16.340]  Gee, you and I talked about that months ago.
[02:13:16.340 --> 02:13:21.844]  And that they're not going to recommend vaccination, so they're going to have to come up with a false flag.
[02:13:21.844 --> 02:13:23.565]  I think, what was it, the History Channel or someone?
[02:13:23.565 --> 02:13:26.728]  Two different groups of neighbor kids in my neighborhood took it and got sick.
[02:13:27.330 --> 02:13:29.132]  Yep.
[02:13:29.132 --> 02:13:32.214]  But I think the thing that everyone's got to realize is this.
[02:13:32.214 --> 02:13:34.676]  Those camps exist for a reason.
[02:13:34.676 --> 02:13:36.958]  We've told the background of the Garden Plot.
[02:13:36.958 --> 02:13:38.439]  We've told... Look at Tennessee!
[02:13:38.439 --> 02:13:39.340]  Look at Ohio!
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:43.744]  All these shut down state prisons now being run by Homeland Security just sitting there.
[02:13:44.144 --> 02:13:44.524]  I don't know.
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:05.205]  Well, Steve, we've got the mayors and I meant to play this today.
[02:14:05.205 --> 02:14:07.047]  In fact, cue those mayor clips up.
[02:14:07.047 --> 02:14:08.749]  I'll send you from the newsletter when you get a chance.
[02:14:08.749 --> 02:14:10.612]  They're in your IMs.
[02:14:10.612 --> 02:14:13.556]  Where the police chiefs just say, look, you're not allowed to be on the street.
[02:14:13.556 --> 02:14:15.578]  And if you are, we attack you.
[02:14:15.578 --> 02:14:18.041]  This is an incredible martial law admission.
[02:14:18.041 --> 02:14:19.063]  That is martial law.
[02:14:19.721 --> 02:14:21.903]  Well, and here's the thing.
[02:14:21.903 --> 02:14:23.003]  I've told everybody this.
[02:14:23.003 --> 02:14:27.246]  They didn't believe me under the Model Emergency Health Powers Act, which you and I have spoken about.
[02:14:27.246 --> 02:14:30.308]  They have STK orders, those are shoot-to-kill orders.
[02:14:30.308 --> 02:14:34.351]  The point is that I'm getting people saying, well, they can't do this, they can't do that.
[02:14:34.351 --> 02:14:37.734]  They can under the InfraGard that's been covered by mainstream news.
[02:14:37.734 --> 02:14:41.276]  They can even deputize private people with license to kill 007 power.
[02:14:41.276 --> 02:14:42.137]  But let me stop you, Steve.
[02:14:42.817 --> 02:14:54.822]  Recap, for those that don't know what we're talking about, what's going on in Hardin, where it is, what the newscasts were saying, what the, you knew about this before it was on the news, what is, give us the scoop.
[02:14:54.822 --> 02:15:02.065]  The bottom line is a twenty-seven million dollar prison facility is not just a jail, it's twenty-seven million bucks.
[02:15:02.065 --> 02:15:05.586]  No, we had the video, I wish we would have saved it, it was a giant FEMA camp.
[02:15:05.586 --> 02:15:10.008]  Absolutely, and it exists in the realm of an Indian reservation.
[02:15:10.008 --> 02:15:11.629]  Hardin, Montana is about forty-five
[02:15:12.149 --> 02:15:15.510]  Miles east, actually southeast of Billings, Montana.
[02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:19.692]  Billings, Montana is 130 miles away from where I live in Bozeman.
[02:15:19.692 --> 02:15:34.177]  So what we're talking about is the need for, now, ladies and gentlemen, figure 10 to 16,000 acres, that would obviously encounter or, forgive me, encompass a lot of the Native Americans' reservation land.
[02:15:34.177 --> 02:15:39.979]  The problem is there's the jail facility is a giant FEMA camp being manned by foreign
[02:15:40.499 --> 02:15:41.901]  Let me stop you.
[02:15:41.901 --> 02:15:43.082]  You're not saying this.
[02:15:43.082 --> 02:15:48.466]  They brag they're an international merc group in Bosnia, in Serbia, in Iraq, all over the world doing secret ops.
[02:16:01.618 --> 02:16:10.681]  There are these black SUVs that say Harden Police, and the local officials are going, yeah, we've been told they run the camp, and that they run the town now.
[02:16:10.681 --> 02:16:12.861]  I mean, this is Twilight Zone.
[02:16:12.861 --> 02:16:14.362]  Well, it's not even Twilight Zone.
[02:16:14.362 --> 02:16:19.623]  It's the full implementation of the balkanization of the United States, Alex, years ago.
[02:16:19.623 --> 02:16:20.464]  And this is critical.
[02:16:20.464 --> 02:16:21.364]  You've got to let me say this.
[02:16:22.026 --> 02:16:33.515]  Years ago, when I was interviewing Cold War spies and ex-spies from both sides of the Iron Curtain, they told me, the United States is already scheduled to be Balkanized.
[02:16:33.515 --> 02:16:47.086]  And when we went on the Model Cities Exchange programs with different countries around the world, the idea of foreign troops being brought in the United States to keep the order of the disintegration of the United States, we're being Balkanized.
[02:16:47.086 --> 02:16:49.828]  So, the interesting thing, too, on the American Police Force,
[02:16:50.328 --> 02:16:54.389]  They have the Serbian National Crest, okay?
[02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:58.770]  And obviously one of the guys that's running it is Serbian from Montenegro.
[02:16:58.770 --> 02:17:08.172]  But the point is, why do you have a Serbian crest on an American police force site that exists in the virtual realm?
[02:17:08.172 --> 02:17:19.314]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a major intelligence cutout, and in case everybody can't figure it out, Rex84 and all the programs to enslave, imprison, and destroy, and for the record, Alex,
[02:17:19.714 --> 02:17:30.125]  What's the interesting thing about Guantanamo Bay is a lot of the torture that's gone on there can go on on Indian reservations because they're not under the same laws of the United States.
[02:17:30.125 --> 02:17:35.070]  Well, just like they stuck it under a special Guantanamo Bay, which was this weird no-man's land.
[02:17:35.070 --> 02:17:37.012]  That's a great point, Steve.
[02:17:37.012 --> 02:17:38.733]  You knew about this before it was in the news.
[02:17:38.733 --> 02:17:41.276]  What are your intel sources saying specifically?
[02:17:41.937 --> 02:17:48.081]  My intel sources are saying specifically that an event is going to be generated in the next several weeks.
[02:17:48.081 --> 02:17:53.204]  Now look, these guys are as tuned in as they can, but obviously there are things that change that.
[02:17:53.204 --> 02:17:55.605]  Everybody wants you or I to give them a day or an hour.
[02:17:55.605 --> 02:17:56.446]  We can't do that.
[02:17:56.446 --> 02:17:59.047]  We can tell them, look, everything is in place.
[02:18:02.970 --> 02:18:08.552]  Blackwater Z employees up on the Canadian border in Kalispell, Whitefish, Montana.
[02:18:08.552 --> 02:18:11.694]  That's the number we're told from the inside sources.
[02:18:11.694 --> 02:18:29.923]  The amount of foreign troops in Montana right now, it's not just Montana, Michigan, every other border state that borders the Great Lakes or borders the Canadian border, has their pre-positioned men and materials there that there is going to be the false flag, Alex, that we've warned about and warned about and warned about.
[02:18:30.143 --> 02:18:40.931]  Now the locals are getting upset by these black Mercedes SUVs that have Hardin Montana on them and then the Double Eagle Crest just announcing we are your police.
[02:18:40.931 --> 02:18:41.972]  This is insane!
[02:18:41.972 --> 02:18:44.094]  Men with foreign accents stomping around.
[02:18:44.094 --> 02:18:45.895]  I mean, this is Red Dawn happening!
[02:18:46.155 --> 02:19:02.570]  It is Red Dawn happening, and listen, when one of my, and let me tell you how close this is, when my groundskeeper, I have a, you know, full-time groundskeeper, if you will, runs into 12 Tajikistan troops, heavily armed,
[02:19:03.831 --> 02:19:09.398]  30 miles in the wilderness, you know, and I'm the only guy in that part of the country that's private.
[02:19:09.398 --> 02:19:12.361]  You know, they listen to you and I. I've got to tell you a story.
[02:19:12.361 --> 02:19:17.888]  They listen to you and I, and they literally prayed and asked the Lord, this is the day that you and I were on the last time.
[02:19:17.888 --> 02:19:19.029]  Is this stuff real?
[02:19:19.029 --> 02:19:22.954]  It's not that they don't believe me or you, it's just that sometimes people have got to see it with their own eyes.
[02:19:23.174 --> 02:19:23.915]  Let me stop you.
[02:19:23.915 --> 02:19:29.302]  We have found photos of the Two Rivers Detention Center at Hardin, Montana.
[02:19:29.302 --> 02:19:31.004]  This has not been pulled yet.
[02:19:31.004 --> 02:19:33.867]  It only has 301 views.
[02:19:33.867 --> 02:19:36.591]  Oh my, it's a huge facility.
[02:19:36.591 --> 02:19:38.193]  In fact, there's other videos of this.
[02:19:38.193 --> 02:19:39.555]  This thing looks like Dachau.
[02:19:40.219 --> 02:19:42.441]  Well it is, and I've got to tell you something.
[02:19:42.441 --> 02:19:45.243]  This is what people don't understand, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:45.243 --> 02:19:48.686]  This is not where you go to get free meals a day.
[02:19:48.686 --> 02:19:55.492]  This is designed to basically be an absolute, the most dire prison system in the world.
[02:19:55.492 --> 02:19:56.332]  Stay there, Steve.
[02:19:56.332 --> 02:19:56.793]  Stay there.
[02:19:56.793 --> 02:19:58.154]  This is unbelievable.
[02:19:58.154 --> 02:20:00.416]  Foreign troops on the ground policing Americans.
[02:20:01.787 --> 02:20:02.909]  Attention all U.S.
[02:20:02.909 --> 02:20:05.352]  homeowners stuck in high interest rate mortgages.
[02:20:05.352 --> 02:20:09.097]  Are you finding it harder and harder to keep up with your monthly mortgage payments?
[02:20:09.097 --> 02:20:14.985]  Homeowners with all types of credit can now apply for FHA government-insured 30-year fixed rates as low as 4.875% from
[02:20:16.647 --> 02:20:17.247]  I think so.
[02:20:40.143 --> 02:20:42.865]  You will hear your rate for free in just minutes.
[02:20:42.865 --> 02:20:48.389]  These rates are only available for a limited time, so act now to find out your rate for free.
[02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.930]  Call now.
[02:20:48.930 --> 02:20:48.990]  800-511-4300.
[02:20:48.990 --> 02:20:49.130]  800-511-4300.
[02:20:49.130 --> 02:20:49.250]  800-511-4300.
[02:20:49.250 --> 02:20:50.291]  Topdot is a licensed mortgage banker.
[02:20:50.291 --> 02:20:51.271]  Rates based on an APR of 5.20%.
[02:21:03.052 --> 02:21:04.514]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:04.514 --> 02:21:10.562]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:21:10.562 --> 02:21:11.383]  That's right.
[02:21:11.383 --> 02:21:13.986]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:21:13.986 --> 02:21:21.155]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:21:21.696 --> 02:21:29.840]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:35.322]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:21:35.322 --> 02:21:41.145]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:41.145 --> 02:21:45.647]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:21:45.647 --> 02:21:45.907]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.508 --> 02:21:50.991]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:21:50.991 --> 02:21:53.473]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.473 --> 02:21:57.457]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:57.457 --> 02:22:08.108]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:22:08.108 --> 02:22:09.810]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:22:10.748 --> 02:22:12.288]  But who is the enemy?
[02:22:12.288 --> 02:22:13.089]  Bin Laden.
[02:22:13.089 --> 02:22:14.109]  This is his M.O.
[02:22:14.109 --> 02:22:15.429]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:22:15.429 --> 02:22:17.450]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:22:17.450 --> 02:22:24.592]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:22:24.592 --> 02:22:25.072]  Some U.S.
[02:22:25.072 --> 02:22:30.714]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:22:31.434 --> 02:22:34.897]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:22:34.897 --> 02:22:37.119]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:23:01.323 --> 02:23:05.825]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[02:23:05.825 --> 02:23:09.867]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[02:23:09.867 --> 02:23:20.933]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[02:23:20.933 --> 02:23:23.814]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful immune systems
[02:23:26.087 --> 02:23:26.928]  We're good to go.
[02:23:52.705 --> 02:23:55.207]  We will be reporting on this FEMA camp.
[02:23:55.207 --> 02:23:56.548]  The photos are unbelievable.
[02:23:56.548 --> 02:23:58.070]  We're getting them posted up at
[02:24:16.820 --> 02:24:19.642]  PrisonPlanet.com and Paul Watson's story.
[02:24:19.642 --> 02:24:21.664]  There's a whole bunch of different videos and photos.
[02:24:21.664 --> 02:24:28.769]  It is a full camp, barber shops, set up for families.
[02:24:28.769 --> 02:24:30.291]  This is unbelievable.
[02:24:30.291 --> 02:24:31.031]  I mean, look at this one.
[02:24:31.031 --> 02:24:32.673]  Two Rivers Detention Camp Facts.
[02:24:32.673 --> 02:24:34.074]  Click on that one.
[02:24:34.074 --> 02:24:36.716]  That's got a shot of the giant facility.
[02:24:36.716 --> 02:24:40.419]  I mean, this thing even looks bigger than it did on the news, Steve Quayle.
[02:24:41.243 --> 02:24:43.524]  Yeah, and look, Alex, I want to tell everybody something.
[02:24:43.524 --> 02:24:54.930]  One of the most disturbing parts of this is, listen, my source told me that one of the managers at a local business in Hardin, Montana was visited by this new private security force, which is, quote, the new police department.
[02:24:54.930 --> 02:25:01.754]  The guy that was visited is an avid hunter, and they came to inform him that they had a list of all firearms that he owned.
[02:25:01.754 --> 02:25:08.097]  This includes all the residents of our town, and that he would need to take his guns down to have them put a marking device on their
[02:25:08.758 --> 02:25:11.259]  Excuse me, you just dropped a bomb on us.
[02:25:11.259 --> 02:25:12.340]  This is Red Dawn.
[02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:18.465]  They are now... Steve, you don't... Steve, you're... We need to have this business owner on.
[02:25:18.465 --> 02:25:20.246]  He needs to speak out.
[02:25:20.246 --> 02:25:23.729]  Well, again, the deal is that I will track him down, okay?
[02:25:23.729 --> 02:25:24.950]  Or is the town in fear now?
[02:25:25.501 --> 02:25:27.102]  Well, I don't think they're in fear.
[02:25:27.102 --> 02:25:40.392]  A lot of these people are really... I'll tell you what, Montanans, and they're kind of like Texans, you know, they'll only take so much, and from what I'm hearing from the Hardin people, they're getting very, very upset, okay?
[02:25:40.392 --> 02:25:41.993]  But this is a bombshell.
[02:25:41.993 --> 02:25:43.734]  Here's what I'm trying to tell everybody.
[02:25:43.734 --> 02:25:45.336]  Okay, you can use a cutaway.
[02:25:45.336 --> 02:25:47.657]  You can use a false front in Virginia.
[02:25:47.657 --> 02:25:48.198]  You can use a...
[02:25:48.818 --> 02:26:11.157]  An empty office meeting room, but when they start talking, and this was volunteered, that they are going, they have a list of all the firearms that he owned, only the ATF can give that to him, or the FBI, and that they're going to put a marking device on them, and that they would have the people in town, now when people say, well I haven't been told that, well no offense, if you live 40 miles out of Hardin, why would you?
[02:26:11.157 --> 02:26:13.319]  You see, this is all part of it, this is
[02:26:13.839 --> 02:26:15.700]  Hold on!
[02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:16.781]  It's got education.
[02:26:16.781 --> 02:26:18.722]  It's got a school on it.
[02:26:18.722 --> 02:26:21.524]  Just like the FEMA camp up here that they put the illegals in.
[02:26:21.524 --> 02:26:24.085]  The video we've got of the kids on the swings inside.
[02:26:24.085 --> 02:26:26.227]  This is a giant facility, Steve.
[02:26:26.227 --> 02:26:27.607]  How many does it hold?
[02:26:27.607 --> 02:26:35.412]  Well, the expansion module for it, I'm told that they're talking that it will be ready to take five to ten thousand people.
[02:26:36.138 --> 02:26:38.981]  Well, just from the photos we've seen, it looks like it holds more than that.
[02:26:38.981 --> 02:26:43.946]  Well, no, I'm just talking right now, Alex, what's currently there.
[02:26:43.946 --> 02:26:45.307]  I mean, let me share this with you.
[02:26:45.307 --> 02:26:46.629]  When they're talking 10,000 to 16,000 additional acres,
[02:26:50.347 --> 02:26:53.648]  You can only use your mind to project.
[02:26:53.648 --> 02:26:57.668]  I mean, we're talking about, you know, pretty flat land in that area.
[02:26:57.668 --> 02:27:01.849]  Some hills, but the point is that you can make... This is what people don't understand.
[02:27:01.849 --> 02:27:09.631]  The plans to incorporate almost instantaneous places to put large amounts of people.
[02:27:09.631 --> 02:27:15.272]  I mean, you know, we calculated that they can basically put... You name the number, they can put it there.
[02:27:17.649 --> 02:27:22.490]  And the locals were on the news before the news channel pulled it going, we don't know why they built this big camp.
[02:27:22.490 --> 02:27:25.251]  We don't know why they're saying there are police now.
[02:27:25.251 --> 02:27:27.332]  And they admittedly, it's a foreign company?
[02:27:27.332 --> 02:27:33.393]  I mean, Steve, we have found an actual, real facility.
[02:27:33.393 --> 02:27:38.415]  We know they've been shutting down all these other army bases and now in the congressional record they admit that's FEMA camps.
[02:27:39.295 --> 02:27:49.543]  But I mean to have it manned by foreigners and they're now going it's on the news they're going around doing police duties and the local town says we didn't elect them.
[02:27:49.543 --> 02:27:50.663]  I mean this is
[02:27:52.233 --> 02:27:53.854]  I know I'm stunned, Steve.
[02:27:53.854 --> 02:27:57.176]  I just... When you called me last Friday, I've been so focused on other things.
[02:27:57.176 --> 02:28:00.238]  I saw your email and I appreciate you trying to break it with us.
[02:28:00.238 --> 02:28:02.940]  And I didn't fully understand until I saw it this morning on the news.
[02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:08.304]  Because, I mean, you know, I believe you when you tell me stuff, but, like, foreign mercenaries in Hardin?
[02:28:08.304 --> 02:28:09.485]  I went and looked at it.
[02:28:09.485 --> 02:28:10.966]  Population, a couple hundred.
[02:28:10.966 --> 02:28:12.346]  And I'm like, what?
[02:28:12.346 --> 02:28:14.068]  And I didn't go to the links you sent me?
[02:28:14.068 --> 02:28:15.168]  And then, my God, it's...
[02:28:16.609 --> 02:28:19.651]  I mean, even I can't believe this is happening, Steve Coyle.
[02:28:19.651 --> 02:28:29.618]  Well, Alex, one of the things that you've got to know is, and you know I don't harass you, I don't inundate you with stuff, but when I do contact you, it's of a critical importance.
[02:28:29.618 --> 02:28:33.960]  Okay, well you also contacted me two weeks ago to say, look out, I'm under hit team surveillance.
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:34.581]  What is that about?
[02:28:35.151 --> 02:28:44.435]  Well, like I said, the bottom line is that specific people already have what I would call the red list assigned shooters in place.
[02:28:44.435 --> 02:28:46.275]  Now, this is something that people have got to understand.
[02:28:46.275 --> 02:28:55.039]  Look, the man that gave me the red list, the blue list, the green list, the blue list, let me deal with all of the police, all of the military, everybody out there in the intelligence community.
[02:28:55.519 --> 02:29:07.966]  You who are going to facilitate the rounding up of your fellow countrymen will be terminated within 30 to 45 days by the very foreign troops that are here that are just basically taking your names, numbers, and they know your family.
[02:29:07.966 --> 02:29:08.686]  So they're phase two.
[02:29:08.686 --> 02:29:10.527]  This is what the Russians always do.
[02:29:10.527 --> 02:29:13.349]  They use the locals, then phase two, bring in other brigades.
[02:29:13.809 --> 02:29:14.910]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:29:14.910 --> 02:29:20.374]  And so the thing is, is that they're pre-positioning what I call their shooters, okay?
[02:29:20.374 --> 02:29:21.635]  Their assassination teams.
[02:29:21.635 --> 02:29:31.222]  And by the way, I've had multiple law enforcement representatives that listen to this show, your show, my show, our shows, call me and say, you know, it's really weird.
[02:29:31.222 --> 02:29:37.327]  We thought you were fully, you know what, Steve, until we started seeing these guys coming along who were observers in our department.
[02:29:37.327 --> 02:29:41.410]  And we were told by our captains and stuff not to ask any questions.
[02:29:41.810 --> 02:29:43.732]  Then that's now mainstream news.
[02:29:43.732 --> 02:29:48.615]  You said that years ago that they're putting in mercs and regular army and marines and departments.
[02:29:48.615 --> 02:29:49.115]  Stay there.
[02:29:49.115 --> 02:29:51.497]  This is getting heavy.
[02:29:51.497 --> 02:29:52.898]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.898 --> 02:29:55.420]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.420 --> 02:29:58.102]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:04.884]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:04.884 --> 02:30:06.886]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:06.886 --> 02:30:15.415]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.415 --> 02:30:20.960]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:22.582]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:22.802 --> 02:30:29.327]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.327 --> 02:30:40.376]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.376 --> 02:30:41.757]  That's right, clean water.
[02:30:42.017 --> 02:30:42.417]  We're good to go.
[02:31:00.495 --> 02:31:05.802]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:05.802 --> 02:31:10.328]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.328 --> 02:31:12.611]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.611 --> 02:31:14.233]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.233 --> 02:31:15.275]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.495 --> 02:31:23.920]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:31:37.407 --> 02:31:43.428]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[02:32:17.513 --> 02:32:22.276]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[02:32:22.276 --> 02:32:26.198]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[02:32:26.198 --> 02:32:30.340]  AirAndAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[02:32:30.600 --> 02:32:31.060]  All of the water?
[02:33:11.235 --> 02:33:12.996]  I'm going to flush the phone calls.
[02:33:12.996 --> 02:33:16.037]  I apologize to Barbara, Ken, Paul, Edward, John, and others.
[02:33:16.037 --> 02:33:20.220]  If you are in or around Hardin, Montana, Steve has people on the ground.
[02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:22.221]  We're just going to leave it at that.
[02:33:22.221 --> 02:33:24.482]  We need your video shot.
[02:33:24.482 --> 02:33:32.226]  We have found a bunch of videos put out by the locals where they're bragging about the FEMA camp, bragging about the mercs.
[02:33:33.206 --> 02:33:35.108]  They've taken the local news down.
[02:33:35.108 --> 02:33:40.415]  Everybody needs to go to YouTube and type in Two Rivers Attention Centers and you'll get a bunch of videos.
[02:33:40.415 --> 02:33:41.236]  Save them.
[02:33:41.236 --> 02:33:42.318]  Post them on your channels.
[02:33:42.318 --> 02:33:45.221]  They are pulling these.
[02:33:45.221 --> 02:33:48.926]  This is definitely run by a secret Merck group.
[02:33:48.926 --> 02:33:51.890]  The town doesn't know why it was there or they're not supposed to talk about it.
[02:33:52.330 --> 02:33:54.071]  This thing was just built.
[02:33:54.071 --> 02:33:59.595]  They admitted they want to put the new FEMA camps in Wyoming and Montana for the enemy combatants.
[02:33:59.595 --> 02:34:00.956]  That is mainstream news.
[02:34:00.956 --> 02:34:03.178]  I need Paul Watson to add that to his article.
[02:34:03.178 --> 02:34:06.100]  This is off the charts what is happening.
[02:34:06.100 --> 02:34:10.843]  Also, if anything happens to me or anything develops, we're now on the White House enemies list.
[02:34:10.843 --> 02:34:16.787]  You know, mainstream news, Obama's secret enemies list revealed 25 names the president wants to silence and why.
[02:34:16.787 --> 02:34:17.648]  I am in the list of 25.
[02:34:17.648 --> 02:34:18.188]  Alex Jones.
[02:34:20.270 --> 02:34:24.952]  If anything happens to me, Fall of the Republic has been uploaded to remote servers.
[02:34:24.952 --> 02:34:28.294]  It will go up, but then we'll be basically financially bankrupt.
[02:34:28.294 --> 02:34:32.216]  Please buy the DVD in high quality now at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:32.216 --> 02:34:32.996]  Get it.
[02:34:32.996 --> 02:34:34.997]  Make copies of it.
[02:34:34.997 --> 02:34:36.098]  It's just a timetable.
[02:34:36.098 --> 02:34:37.299]  Everything is coming together.
[02:34:37.299 --> 02:34:39.680]  I've got stacks of news about Gardasil killing people.
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:40.840]  We're going to go over that.
[02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:44.922]  I've got stacks of news about the vaccine causing deadly flu.
[02:34:44.922 --> 02:34:48.963]  We've got stacks of articles about enforcing nurses and medical workers and then protesting.
[02:34:48.963 --> 02:34:55.385]  Stacks of news, YouTube videos of regular Army, Marines, National Guard deploying from Tennessee to Arizona.
[02:34:55.385 --> 02:34:56.585]  Locals don't know why they're there.
[02:34:56.585 --> 02:34:57.606]  They're running checkpoints.
[02:34:57.606 --> 02:34:59.386]  The governor of Tennessee says don't do it.
[02:34:59.386 --> 02:35:00.066]  They keep doing it.
[02:35:00.066 --> 02:35:01.427]  I had state reps on about that.
[02:35:01.727 --> 02:35:03.068]  We're being hit from every side.
[02:35:03.068 --> 02:35:05.570]  They had NLE09 last month.
[02:35:05.570 --> 02:35:10.193]  14 countries to quote, take on a foreign, foreigners to quote, take on American terrorists.
[02:35:10.193 --> 02:35:13.675]  That's FEMA's own press release at FEMA.gov.
[02:35:13.675 --> 02:35:20.240]  Steve Quayle, continue with this facility, the intel, the massive announcement that they came to a business owner.
[02:35:21.701 --> 02:35:22.882]  With police department.
[02:35:22.882 --> 02:35:24.784]  Private Mercs with hardened police on it.
[02:35:24.784 --> 02:35:25.865]  Mainstream news.
[02:35:25.865 --> 02:35:26.926]  That's confirmed.
[02:35:26.926 --> 02:35:31.650]  And so we want a list of your... We have a list of your guns and we want you to put a tag on them.
[02:35:31.650 --> 02:35:32.891]  Be specific about this.
[02:35:33.919 --> 02:35:48.526]  Well, I think, you know, as specific as you can get, and as I can get, is, look, we have gone on record, Alex, and are going on record, and still are on record, with the fact that the idea of throwing the United States of America under martial law is a given.
[02:35:48.526 --> 02:35:50.507]  The only question that's open is when.
[02:35:50.507 --> 02:35:54.949]  We are now, ladies and gentlemen, a country occupied by foreign troops.
[02:35:54.949 --> 02:36:02.132]  Those foreign troops know where you live, they know the gun you own, maybe not all of them, but enough to... They have GPS to your front door.
[02:36:02.392 --> 02:36:06.213]  Yeah, and that's for those of us that deserve hellfire missiles.
[02:36:06.213 --> 02:36:09.134]  That's what I was told by a high-ranking military official.
[02:36:09.134 --> 02:36:10.415]  Now, here's the thing, Alex.
[02:36:10.415 --> 02:36:13.936]  This is something I don't think people understand what I said.
[02:36:13.936 --> 02:36:16.077]  We are under foreign occupation.
[02:36:16.077 --> 02:36:18.838]  You can't say the Constitution matters.
[02:36:18.838 --> 02:36:19.698]  It does to you.
[02:36:19.698 --> 02:36:21.158]  It does not to them.
[02:36:21.158 --> 02:36:29.061]  When Obama made the statement that he wants a private military police force, you covered that at length.
[02:36:29.521 --> 02:36:34.663]  What do you think this is, and who do you think these people respond to and follow the money?
[02:36:34.663 --> 02:36:45.468]  How does a $27 million prison just all of a sudden get built on the perimeter or boundaries of an Indian reservation in Montana?
[02:36:46.128 --> 02:36:47.850]  Stays dormant for two years.
[02:36:47.850 --> 02:37:00.425]  Now, by the way, our governor is a great guy, Brian Schweitzer, in my opinion, because he's gone round and round with the hardened officials and our Attorney General said no importation of out-of-state prisoners, okay?
[02:37:01.005 --> 02:37:03.367]  And they're aware of this situation right now.
[02:37:03.367 --> 02:37:05.129]  So there's a war going on.
[02:37:05.129 --> 02:37:09.973]  And we have a states' rights issue versus the federal government's rights.
[02:37:09.973 --> 02:37:16.779]  You know, we were one of the first states that said we won't submit to the confiscation of firearms, especially made in Montana firearms.
[02:37:16.779 --> 02:37:20.222]  The ATF came back and said a federal law trumps state law.
[02:37:20.222 --> 02:37:21.803]  And that's what it all boils down to, Alex.
[02:37:21.803 --> 02:37:22.604]  But here's where we're at.
[02:37:23.044 --> 02:37:28.368]  We are right now experiencing the pre-positioning of foreign troops throughout the country.
[02:37:28.368 --> 02:37:35.772]  We are also seeing pre-positioning of military hardware, I'm talking tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles.
[02:37:35.772 --> 02:37:40.455]  I'm talking, being told specifically, that if necessary, the U.S.
[02:37:40.455 --> 02:37:45.639]  military will bomb entire cities in the United States to deal with, quote, the resistors.
[02:37:46.059 --> 02:38:09.942]  You, by your identification on Obama's hit list, let me tell you what, Obama's hit list is nothing compared to the powers that be, the New World Order's hit list, because they have, and I think this is something that people have got to understand, this does not go on forever without a breaking point, and that's why you must, you must, you must do everything you can to understand
[02:38:11.723 --> 02:38:17.748]  Like you just told people, they've got to have their food, they've got to have a plan, and they've got to be prepared.
[02:38:17.748 --> 02:38:30.558]  Well, Steve, that's what our intel sources are saying, is that that's why they're beating innocent people, going into the university, attacking at the G20, attacking women, releasing police dogs on old women in the shopping district.
[02:38:31.727 --> 02:38:36.294]  Old women with bags saying I'm not allowed to shop and the police are like Billy Club, Attack Dog.
[02:38:36.294 --> 02:38:40.400]  They have been told to do this to drive everybody into rebellion.
[02:38:41.604 --> 02:38:42.464]  Absolutely!
[02:38:42.464 --> 02:38:44.925]  And see, this is the thing, the vilification.
[02:38:44.925 --> 02:38:48.265]  Alex, remember I told you, identify, vilify, nullify, destroy?
[02:38:48.265 --> 02:38:57.007]  We have the DHS report saying gun owners, veterans, gun confiscation, clergy response teams, libertarians, in the Fed, protesters.
[02:38:57.007 --> 02:39:05.329]  My guys had the police come and say that they were terrorists and call them on their phones and say, you're on a watch list now, laughing at them at the G20.
[02:39:05.329 --> 02:39:06.369]  These are sickos!
[02:39:07.793 --> 02:39:09.715]  Well, I gotta tell you something, too.
[02:39:09.715 --> 02:39:10.997]  I will stand by my source.
[02:39:10.997 --> 02:39:15.743]  There are people that obviously work for the federal government saying my source is wrong.
[02:39:15.743 --> 02:39:18.687]  I will stand by her, with her.
[02:39:18.687 --> 02:39:20.629]  She is as solid as they come.
[02:39:20.629 --> 02:39:21.831]  I've had corollary.
[02:39:21.831 --> 02:39:22.872]  Look, let me tell you something, Alex.
[02:39:23.252 --> 02:39:31.454]  I have to have three confirmations by independent people, unknown to each other, usually from the military, intel, and I go out and I pull out all stuff.
[02:39:31.454 --> 02:39:34.095]  Everybody is saying the same thing.
[02:39:34.095 --> 02:39:34.995]  Obama's choosing.
[02:39:34.995 --> 02:39:35.736]  Why Montana?
[02:39:35.736 --> 02:39:48.019]  He's purposely choosing Montana and Wyoming as his testing ground because, number one, we don't have the population to supposedly blow the whistle, and they can buy off the local small-town people, I'm told, for peanuts, okay?
[02:39:49.089 --> 02:40:08.195]  Remember Delta Force in 99 making bribes in major cities the San Antonio police chief refused the bribe went public on this show saying just work with us in black ops for continuity of government they have and then they're choosing Wyoming Montana because the low population because they can outnumber the people with the mercs and intimidate them and beta test
[02:40:08.755 --> 02:40:10.837]  Can they have Merck's as police?
[02:40:10.837 --> 02:40:11.798]  Can they do this?
[02:40:11.798 --> 02:40:13.619]  Can they build FEMA centers?
[02:40:13.619 --> 02:40:23.047]  And then mainstream news, I know Watson and Steve and Kirk can pull these up, in the last few months they've announced that Obama plans to put the Gitmo people in Wyoming and Montana.
[02:40:24.514 --> 02:40:25.355]  Well, absolutely.
[02:40:25.355 --> 02:40:26.375]  And see, this is the deal.
[02:40:26.375 --> 02:40:31.498]  I mean, people have got to understand, Montana has just a little bit under a million people in the whole state.
[02:40:31.498 --> 02:40:33.079]  We're the fourth largest state.
[02:40:33.079 --> 02:40:34.760]  But there's a lot of stuff in Montana.
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:36.281]  We've got a lot of underground bases.
[02:40:36.281 --> 02:40:37.102]  I mean, big ones.
[02:40:37.102 --> 02:40:38.543]  I'm talking huge ones, Alex.
[02:40:39.013 --> 02:40:49.158]  Four square miles underground, and usually when you see these type of camps showing up, they show up in some of the most remote areas of Montana and of Wyoming.
[02:40:49.158 --> 02:41:05.867]  Now listen, we're getting reports from the field of French and intelligence troops in log cabins near the Flaming Gorge Reservoir who've been met by Chinook helicopters and on BMW motorcycles and are having coolers, very small coolers, given to them.
[02:41:05.867 --> 02:41:07.348]  You and I talked about that, okay?
[02:41:07.748 --> 02:41:08.449]  Those are bio-weapons.
[02:41:08.449 --> 02:41:17.661]  You said a month ago you thought they might release the flu on Indian reservations, then the National Post of Canada said flu shots with body bags are being delivered all over.
[02:41:17.661 --> 02:41:18.883]  Absolutely.
[02:41:18.883 --> 02:41:20.565]  Oh my God, it's starting to come together.
[02:41:20.565 --> 02:41:21.606]  Holy mackerel.
[02:41:21.606 --> 02:41:23.389]  Yeah, also Upper Peninsula, Michigan.
[02:41:23.789 --> 02:41:30.933]  The amount of real estate being sold on the borders, especially for hotels, for lodges, any Great Lake lodges.
[02:41:30.933 --> 02:41:36.155]  I mean, I'm in contact, like you are, with a lot of people, and I'm telling you, they are buying a lot.
[02:41:36.155 --> 02:41:43.819]  Well, Steve, NLE09 said troops from 14 countries here with FEMA training to engage American terrorists.
[02:41:44.309 --> 02:41:47.531]  Absolutely, and remember when they landed at, what, Jacksonville, Florida?
[02:41:47.531 --> 02:41:50.932]  Thirteen nations of Latin America?
[02:41:50.932 --> 02:41:52.033]  Major news!
[02:41:52.033 --> 02:42:03.639]  Absolutely, and what about, Alex, the time frame is critical, because I know we don't have that much time left together, but the time frame... Look, 400 border patrol guards are being taken off the Mexican-US border.
[02:42:03.639 --> 02:42:07.041]  That will create a corridor for the Red Dawn scenario.
[02:42:07.041 --> 02:42:10.682]  It is not by chance that Venezuela is seeking nuclear weapons and submarines.
[02:42:10.682 --> 02:42:11.703]  It is not by chance.
[02:42:12.063 --> 02:42:17.907]  That the Cienfuegos submarine base in Cuba, top-secret base, underwater access...
[02:42:21.619 --> 02:42:23.020]  Absolutely, everything.
[02:42:23.020 --> 02:42:29.902]  And look, years ago, I mean, I tracked, I talked to a lot of guys that were international weapons dealers.
[02:42:29.902 --> 02:42:48.068]  You know, a lot of years, they said the amount of weaponry going into the gangs, and I'm not talking about 38 specials or 25... And after you talked about that, the grenade launchers and AK-47s on Costco Chinese government ships being delivered wasn't going to gangs, the LA Times reported it was being bivouacked.
[02:42:48.633 --> 02:42:49.694]  Absolutely.
[02:42:49.694 --> 02:42:55.957]  So it's strategically placed, and what I'm watching, and what I think everybody should be watching is this.
[02:42:55.957 --> 02:42:59.499]  Look, when you see foreign troops, make notes.
[02:42:59.499 --> 02:43:04.422]  And for those of you that have camera phones, for those of you that have video cameras, take them everywhere.
[02:43:04.422 --> 02:43:06.102]  You know, Alex, I'm notorious.
[02:43:06.102 --> 02:43:07.623]  Now I travel with all my stuff.
[02:43:07.623 --> 02:43:08.984]  I'm not going to be caught without
[02:43:09.304 --> 02:43:12.047]  My camera's any longer, and I'm a photographer!
[02:43:12.047 --> 02:43:14.910]  That's my profession before I went into talk radio.
[02:43:14.910 --> 02:43:24.059]  So the thing is, is that we've got to absolutely get photographs, and like you've already made the request to Hardin, this is the thing, you guys.
[02:43:24.059 --> 02:43:24.800]  Everyone listening.
[02:43:25.242 --> 02:43:32.504]  The thing they hate is exposure, and I mean that in the pun sense of the word, as in photographic exposure.
[02:43:32.504 --> 02:43:39.666]  And so when we can get the photos and get them uplinked, and while we've still got time, Alex, listen, we are running out of time.
[02:43:39.666 --> 02:43:43.107]  That's not BS, that's not a talk radio bravado.
[02:43:43.107 --> 02:43:48.808]  Look, when you start identifying enemies of the state, I think there should be an absolute
[02:43:49.208 --> 02:43:55.795]  Everyone who's on that list, and me and others who have been, you know, said, you die soon.
[02:43:55.795 --> 02:44:01.280]  The bottom line is, is that we should be filing a class action suit for hate crimes!
[02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:02.661]  For hate crimes!
[02:44:02.661 --> 02:44:10.569]  Because they're talking about the political assassination, first of all, of free speech, and of anybody that will stand against it.
[02:44:11.281 --> 02:44:13.243]  Well, this is a chilling effect, Steve.
[02:44:13.243 --> 02:44:14.905]  They're attempting to chill our speech.
[02:44:14.905 --> 02:44:17.367]  They told our camera guys, you're going to be on terror list and laugh.
[02:44:17.367 --> 02:44:18.889]  This is their new police state.
[02:44:18.889 --> 02:44:19.970]  They did hire Primakov.
[02:44:19.970 --> 02:44:21.972]  They did hire Marcus Wolf from East Germany.
[02:44:21.972 --> 02:44:22.613]  You were correct.
[02:44:22.613 --> 02:44:25.335]  That came out in congressional budget documents.
[02:44:25.335 --> 02:44:26.937]  They are setting up the Stasi teams.
[02:44:26.937 --> 02:44:27.958]  They have hired the 3.4 million
[02:44:29.179 --> 02:44:32.160]  Girl Scouts to quote spy on their neighbors and help take on terrorists.
[02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:33.680]  AP AFP headline.
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:39.561]  They are training the Boy Scouts of America and the Explorer Scouts to quote take on gun owners and disgruntled veterans.
[02:44:39.561 --> 02:44:41.122]  Front page of the New York Times.
[02:44:41.122 --> 02:44:42.762]  This is really happening.
[02:44:42.762 --> 02:44:46.063]  They really have children coast-to-coast worshiping Obama.
[02:44:46.063 --> 02:44:49.744]  Changing the words from Jesus loves all the little children.
[02:44:49.744 --> 02:44:51.264]  Yellow, red, black and white.
[02:44:51.264 --> 02:44:52.544]  They are equal in his sight.
[02:44:52.544 --> 02:44:54.725]  To President Obama loves all the little children.
[02:44:55.649 --> 02:45:00.455]  Yellow, red, yellow, black and white, they're equal in a sight.
[02:45:00.455 --> 02:45:05.342]  We have entered the twilight zone and they're testing, they're probing right now.
[02:45:05.342 --> 02:45:08.265]  And then as nothing happens, we just get more conditioned to accept it.
[02:45:09.175 --> 02:45:11.736]  But I want to give the number out, Steve.
[02:45:11.736 --> 02:45:12.537]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:45:12.537 --> 02:45:21.782]  I've had private investigators call me, send me photos, video in Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama of the plastic coffins people laughed at.
[02:45:21.782 --> 02:45:23.442]  Now it's admitted it's for the flu.
[02:45:23.442 --> 02:45:28.285]  I've gotten internal documents from the state of New York admitting that they've got mass graves ready.
[02:45:28.285 --> 02:45:34.388]  Illinois and Indiana, emergency managers on the show saying the police are saying get ready for the citizens to attack your police departments.
[02:45:34.388 --> 02:45:34.948]  Harden them.
[02:45:34.948 --> 02:45:35.949]  This was in January.
[02:45:36.629 --> 02:45:37.990]  Get ready for mass graves.
[02:45:37.990 --> 02:45:41.232]  Get ready for millions dead from Chicago and your town in Indiana.
[02:45:41.232 --> 02:45:42.853]  Get ready for total martial law.
[02:45:42.853 --> 02:45:44.774]  We don't know if they're going to do this.
[02:45:44.774 --> 02:45:48.696]  The issue is we've never seen such a massive buildup.
[02:45:48.696 --> 02:45:53.959]  I want to hear specifically from people that have these new camps that have been built in their areas.
[02:45:53.959 --> 02:45:59.702]  I want to hear specifically from people who are in Hardin or what you think about this if you're on
[02:46:00.282 --> 02:46:00.743]  Well, I can.
[02:46:15.370 --> 02:46:16.491]  We're running out of time.
[02:46:16.491 --> 02:46:21.313]  People can no longer just sit back and... Like, I'm getting emails, Alex, as you and I are speaking.
[02:46:21.313 --> 02:46:23.174]  Well, what does this mean to us in Indiana?
[02:46:23.174 --> 02:46:25.816]  There is no state exempt from this.
[02:46:25.816 --> 02:46:27.257]  It is going to be total.
[02:46:27.257 --> 02:46:33.180]  Tommy Frank's infamous statement about us, that the Constitution's gone up, there's a weapon of mass destruction.
[02:46:33.180 --> 02:46:38.803]  Listen, ladies and gentlemen, it's being already put forth on the History Channel that Washington, D.C.
[02:46:38.803 --> 02:46:39.783]  is going to get nuked.
[02:46:39.783 --> 02:46:40.664]  Did you watch that, Alex?
[02:46:40.964 --> 02:46:41.765]  Yes.
[02:46:41.765 --> 02:46:46.909]  Okay, so the thing is, is that neuro-linguistic programming, we're already being trained.
[02:46:46.909 --> 02:46:55.978]  The other thing that people have got to understand, this is the greatest psychological operation ever initiated by any intelligence organization, plural, in the history of the world.
[02:46:55.978 --> 02:46:59.361]  And that's what Dr. Horowitz is trying to get people to understand, too.
[02:46:59.361 --> 02:47:03.785]  The background noise is designed to mess people's brains up, and I've got to tell you something, Alex.
[02:47:04.285 --> 02:47:14.033]  I am absolutely disturbed by the lack of critical thinking by some of the people that have listened to you and listened to me since we both started on the air.
[02:47:14.033 --> 02:47:16.195]  They'll say things like, how do you know this is it?
[02:47:16.195 --> 02:47:28.926]  We can give them 1,000 sources, 2,000, 10,000, 100,000 sources, but if they won't go and read it and see for themselves, they still live in that mind-controlled river of denial.
[02:47:29.226 --> 02:47:29.946]  Well, that's it!
[02:47:29.946 --> 02:47:49.079]  I mean, open world government being announced, open end of the dollar, police saying no one's allowed to protest or even go shopping, attacking old women with police dogs, riding through neighborhoods, sound canoning eight, nine-year-old kids, we have photos, video, total insanity, and people are going, I don't see a police state, I don't see a New World Order, they are under my control.
[02:47:49.079 --> 02:47:54.642]  Let's say somebody's in Texas or Florida or New York and they want to fly to Hardin to see this for themselves.
[02:47:54.642 --> 02:47:58.605]  What is the best town to fly into in Montana to go see this?
[02:47:58.945 --> 02:48:01.627]  Billings, Montana.
[02:48:01.627 --> 02:48:06.350]  And I would encourage everybody up on my website on the alert.
[02:48:06.350 --> 02:48:12.875]  I have both Bacchus and Testers phone numbers to say what is going on up there.
[02:48:12.875 --> 02:48:17.398]  And they say our congressional, excuse me, our senatorial delegation is aware of this.
[02:48:17.398 --> 02:48:17.978]  No, they're not.
[02:48:17.978 --> 02:48:18.679]  They do nothing.
[02:48:19.359 --> 02:48:25.382]  We also have Brian Schweitzer, who, by the way, is a very strong state rights guy.
[02:48:25.382 --> 02:48:30.303]  Probably one of, in my opinion, the leading governors in America who is fighting for state rights.
[02:48:30.303 --> 02:48:35.185]  He understands the global grasp for water, Alex, minerals.
[02:48:35.185 --> 02:48:36.806]  It's all about money, okay?
[02:48:36.806 --> 02:48:37.906]  It's a power grab.
[02:48:37.906 --> 02:48:39.127]  We're being occupied.
[02:48:39.127 --> 02:48:46.930]  They think we're rotten and weak and decadent, and they're just occupying us right out in the open, thinking if they just go about their business like it's no big deal, we'll accept it.
[02:48:47.369 --> 02:48:50.150]  Well, yes, and also, by the way, it's divide and conquer.
[02:48:50.150 --> 02:48:51.610]  And let me go back to it.
[02:48:51.610 --> 02:48:52.590]  Balkanization.
[02:48:52.590 --> 02:49:02.132]  Gee, who knows better about balkanization than the troops that were involved in all the different civil wars and UN police actions than those who were balkanized, okay?
[02:49:02.132 --> 02:49:04.453]  That's the story of the American Police Board.
[02:49:04.453 --> 02:49:06.193]  That's why they pulled down the website.
[02:49:06.193 --> 02:49:09.174]  Please, everybody, go and look at my photo of the day.
[02:49:09.174 --> 02:49:10.775]  Alex, you're welcome to use it, take it.
[02:49:10.775 --> 02:49:15.016]  All those things are absolutely, you know... That's right, you've got it saved.
[02:49:15.016 --> 02:49:16.396]  For those that don't know, recap.
[02:49:17.156 --> 02:49:29.063]  Foreign mercenary group admitted, shows up with black SUVs, the mayor, he's got a different name there, the county head of that area, it's called the Selectman or something, they erased it off the news channel too.
[02:49:29.063 --> 02:49:32.745]  They didn't just pull American Police Force, they pulled the local news channel.
[02:49:32.745 --> 02:49:35.226]  They don't even say the story's gone, it's just gone.
[02:49:35.226 --> 02:49:37.888]  We've got all these videos we're trying to grab right now.
[02:49:38.468 --> 02:49:45.551]  And they're there driving around doing police work with hardened police next to their American Police Force logos.
[02:49:45.551 --> 02:49:47.212]  The locals are saying, why are you here?
[02:49:47.212 --> 02:49:48.533]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:49:48.533 --> 02:49:53.415]  And then you've confirmed they're going to locals saying, we have a list of your guns.
[02:49:53.415 --> 02:49:55.436]  You have to mark them for us and do what?
[02:49:55.916 --> 02:50:00.359]  They have to turn them, they have to bring them in and have them marked, okay?
[02:50:00.359 --> 02:50:02.181]  They put chips in them, okay?
[02:50:02.181 --> 02:50:03.261]  Oh, interesting!
[02:50:03.261 --> 02:50:10.867]  All the warnings, the alerts, and the jumping up and down and screaming we've done about the RFID technology, and now in little old Hardin, Montana.
[02:50:11.367 --> 02:50:13.509]  Or in little old towns in Wyoming.
[02:50:41.087 --> 02:50:44.129]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[02:50:44.129 --> 02:50:45.090]  When the government fears the people,
[02:51:08.107 --> 02:51:09.348]  There is liberty.
[02:51:09.348 --> 02:51:16.333]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy.
[02:51:16.333 --> 02:51:22.036]  If we, the people, do not diligently assert these rights, they may be taken away and lost forever.
[02:51:22.036 --> 02:51:28.841]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[02:51:28.841 --> 02:51:35.025]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[02:51:35.025 --> 02:51:37.207]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[02:51:37.987 --> 02:51:38.307]  I think so.
[02:52:01.178 --> 02:52:03.180]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:52:03.180 --> 02:52:06.784]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:52:06.784 --> 02:52:09.267]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:52:09.267 --> 02:52:12.330]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:52:12.330 --> 02:52:18.116]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:52:18.116 --> 02:52:22.061]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:52:22.381 --> 02:52:27.603]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[02:53:01.573 --> 02:53:05.455]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Calvin Soap.
[02:53:05.455 --> 02:53:15.618]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.
[02:53:15.618 --> 02:53:19.560]  Go to 5starsoaps.com or click on their link at infowars.com.
[02:53:19.560 --> 02:53:21.501]  They have been a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:53:21.501 --> 02:53:25.022]  Calvin Soaps meet the highest standards of quality, purity, and value.
[02:53:25.342 --> 02:53:27.903]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[02:53:27.903 --> 02:53:33.105]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.
[02:53:33.105 --> 02:53:38.126]  Check out their whole line of bath, hair, laundry, and dish soap and more at 5starsoap.com.
[02:53:38.126 --> 02:53:43.048]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:53:43.508 --> 02:53:44.789]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:53:44.789 --> 02:53:53.592]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling toll-free 1-800-340-7091 or check them out online at 5starsoap.com.
[02:53:53.592 --> 02:53:57.133]  Again, go to 5starsoap.com and just try their products.
[02:53:57.133 --> 02:53:58.093]  You're going to love them.
[02:53:58.093 --> 02:54:01.934]  You will never use anything else again.
[02:54:01.934 --> 02:54:07.836]  Steve Quayle is going to be with us another 20 minutes into the next hour.
[02:54:07.836 --> 02:54:08.977]  We're going to be taking your calls.
[02:54:10.430 --> 02:54:13.833]  Steve Quayle, I know he doesn't want the credit, but he gets the credit.
[02:54:13.833 --> 02:54:22.940]  Last Friday, calling me frantically before he even put out his email alert Sunday, saying there are mercenaries, they're policing people, they're intimidating, they're talking to him about their guns.
[02:54:24.386 --> 02:54:26.707]  And I was getting the messages and didn't call me back.
[02:54:26.707 --> 02:54:27.267]  I meant to.
[02:54:27.267 --> 02:54:28.587]  I just get so much going on.
[02:54:28.587 --> 02:54:31.888]  It's like I'm in a batting cage with 100 balls flying at me every minute.
[02:54:31.888 --> 02:54:33.868]  Trying to swing at them all.
[02:54:33.868 --> 02:54:37.449]  Finishing up the Charlie Sheen situation with 9-11.
[02:54:37.449 --> 02:54:38.709]  Finishing up this phase.
[02:54:38.709 --> 02:54:40.510]  Finishing up Fall of the Republic.
[02:54:40.510 --> 02:54:43.250]  It's now on pre-sale at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:43.250 --> 02:54:46.211]  And then I see the local newscast and everything and all the pieces went, whoa!
[02:54:47.809 --> 02:54:51.892]  If you just joined us, we're going to go to phone calls here in just a moment.
[02:54:51.892 --> 02:54:53.893]  You said the locals are getting angry and upset.
[02:54:53.893 --> 02:55:01.239]  I mean, they have the local community leader, the mayor, on the news saying, we don't know why they're running the camp.
[02:55:01.239 --> 02:55:02.360]  We don't know what it's for.
[02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:04.661]  We don't know why they're saying they're our police now.
[02:55:04.661 --> 02:55:07.143]  I mean, this is on so many fronts.
[02:55:07.143 --> 02:55:09.405]  And then you add the part about bring your guns in.
[02:55:09.405 --> 02:55:10.886]  We've got to mark them.
[02:55:10.886 --> 02:55:12.948]  I mean, this is, this is Red Dawn.
[02:55:14.093 --> 02:55:18.758]  Red Dawn and I, but I think it's Red Dawn for the whole country, not just Hardin, Montana, okay?
[02:55:18.758 --> 02:55:22.722]  Because again, the thing is is that I don't think people get it, okay?
[02:55:22.722 --> 02:55:25.404]  The northern borders are being shut off.
[02:55:25.404 --> 02:55:32.772]  Ladies and gentlemen, most people, as things break loose, and Alex on, you know, obviously Texas and New Mexico, Arizona, California,
[02:55:33.713 --> 02:55:39.117]  Florida, the entire Gulf Coast, you know, is going to be a landing zone.
[02:55:39.117 --> 02:55:50.926]  But I don't think people realize that it's already anticipated that most Americans who will want to flee the tyranny... And by the way, this is an open joke in the international espionage community.
[02:55:50.926 --> 02:55:57.712]  It's an open joke that the Americans have bragged about freedom and liberty and their Second Amendment rights, and I've heard them go to me.
[02:55:58.252 --> 02:56:01.276]  But it is happening right before your eyes, Steve.
[02:56:01.276 --> 02:56:02.817]  This is a guy that speaks Russian.
[02:56:02.817 --> 02:56:04.359]  Very good English, okay?
[02:56:04.359 --> 02:56:07.522]  He says, you wonder how we could put up with it.
[02:56:07.522 --> 02:56:09.424]  Look what's going to happen to you.
[02:56:09.424 --> 02:56:12.408]  And Alex, I can't argue, okay?
[02:56:12.408 --> 02:56:15.911]  The thing that you've got to know, too, this is just coming in from a military source.
[02:56:15.911 --> 02:56:18.995]  All military medical training, Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines.
[02:56:19.475 --> 02:56:19.675]  Steve,
[02:56:48.493 --> 02:56:49.554]  This is so incredible.
[02:56:49.554 --> 02:56:55.742]  We found a bunch of YouTube videos of this giant federally FEMA built center.
[02:56:55.742 --> 02:56:59.806]  The locals say we don't know why foreign mercs are manning it or posing as police.
[02:57:01.237 --> 02:57:06.119]  We're going to get those added to Paul Watson's story that's on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:57:06.119 --> 02:57:09.200]  We're going to post that again as our top story.
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:16.543]  I want to go to some phone calls now from people that say they have specific intel on this or other similar areas.
[02:57:16.543 --> 02:57:18.444]  Steve in Texas, you're on the air with Steve Coyle.
[02:57:18.444 --> 02:57:20.045]  Go ahead.
[02:57:20.045 --> 02:57:21.165]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[02:57:21.165 --> 02:57:29.909]  I want to let you know, and Steve also, I actually, once I saw this article on your site and heard you report it, I watched the video and everything.
[02:57:30.629 --> 02:57:32.511]  I actually got the information.
[02:57:32.511 --> 02:57:36.675]  I sent you a fax about an hour ago because I couldn't get through.
[02:57:36.675 --> 02:57:44.403]  I called the Big Horn County Montana Sheriff's Department and I'll give you that number again if you want it.
[02:57:44.403 --> 02:57:45.344]  I had it on the fax.
[02:57:45.344 --> 02:57:48.847]  But I talked to a woman that works directly with the head sheriff.
[02:57:48.847 --> 02:57:50.649]  She said he wasn't in today.
[02:57:50.649 --> 02:57:54.513]  And I brought this up and when I politely mentioned it to her, I was very polite.
[02:57:54.992 --> 02:57:59.775]  Uh, that, uh, of being made aware of the APF invasion of Hardin.
[02:57:59.775 --> 02:58:02.717]  She immediately responded, it's fake.
[02:58:02.717 --> 02:58:03.677]  I said, what?
[02:58:03.677 --> 02:58:04.818]  She said, it's fake.
[02:58:04.818 --> 02:58:08.000]  I said, ma'am, I saw the newscast there.
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:12.863]  They have vehicles there with this logo on there saying Hardin Police.
[02:58:12.863 --> 02:58:16.485]  She said, well, that's been taken off the vehicles as if that made it okay.
[02:58:16.485 --> 02:58:18.426]  And I just told her politely, I said, ma'am,
[02:58:18.934 --> 02:58:24.176]  I want you to please let the Sheriff know, he's sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution.
[02:58:24.176 --> 02:58:35.659]  What this is, is a violation of his jurisdiction, and if he doesn't tell these people to hit the road and oust them, he is guilty of violating his oath.
[02:58:35.659 --> 02:58:37.140]  Stay there, tell me what she said.
[02:58:37.140 --> 02:58:38.440]  I've got your facts right here.
[02:58:41.438 --> 02:58:47.123]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:47.123 --> 02:58:50.766]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:50.766 --> 02:58:54.148]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:58:54.148 --> 02:58:57.771]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:58:57.771 --> 02:59:02.355]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:59:02.355 --> 02:59:03.776]  These emergency backup systems
[02:59:03.996 --> 02:59:06.898]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:59:06.898 --> 02:59:13.002]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:59:13.002 --> 02:59:16.624]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:16.624 --> 02:59:21.447]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:59:21.447 --> 02:59:28.012]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:28.012 --> 02:59:29.953]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:59:30.433 --> 02:59:33.636]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:59:33.636 --> 02:59:38.139]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:59:38.139 --> 02:59:39.921]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:59:39.921 --> 02:59:40.301]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.301 --> 02:59:40.361]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.361 --> 02:59:40.922]  Don't wait.
[02:59:40.922 --> 02:59:41.542]  Call today.
[02:59:41.542 --> 02:59:42.643]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.643 --> 02:59:43.864]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:16.956 --> 03:00:18.919]  Look at this headline from YouTube.
[03:00:18.919 --> 03:00:22.723]  Montana Town dreams of being Guantanamo of the Plains.
[03:00:22.723 --> 03:00:25.806]  I told you they're talking about this being a FEMA camp.
[03:00:27.355 --> 03:00:31.721]  And we were able to find the newscast that was taken down earlier that Steve talked about.
[03:00:31.721 --> 03:00:35.065]  We have that newscast right now.
[03:00:35.065 --> 03:00:41.192]  Let's go to the local Hardin, Montana newscast live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:00:41.192 --> 03:00:42.414]  It's the great part about the web.
[03:00:42.414 --> 03:00:43.575]  Everybody grabs this.
[03:00:43.575 --> 03:00:44.436]  Go ahead and play it, man.
[03:00:45.577 --> 03:00:50.539]  I'm against it.
[03:00:50.539 --> 03:00:51.860]  I don't think it's a good idea.
[03:00:51.860 --> 03:00:54.340]  It's too much of a security risk.
[03:00:54.340 --> 03:00:58.962]  I don't think we want to have Al Qaeda prisoners in Montana.
[03:00:58.962 --> 03:01:00.963]  It's a security risk that I don't think we want to have.
[03:01:02.503 --> 03:01:10.009]  However, Senators Max Baucus and John Tester and Representative Denny Rehberg say they do support the jail in finding viable contracts.
[03:01:10.009 --> 03:01:17.216]  Tuesday, Hardin City Council gave two Rivers Detention Center officials the green light to pursue a contract to accept Gitmo prisoners.
[03:01:17.216 --> 03:01:22.120]  President Barack Obama has said he plans to close Guantanamo by next January.
[03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:26.163]  Jail officials say their facility is secure enough to hold the terror suspects.
[03:01:26.163 --> 03:01:28.065]  We understand this is a long shot at best.
[03:01:28.385 --> 03:01:31.646]  Okay, earlier I was saying I believe this had to do with Gitmo people.
[03:01:49.967 --> 03:01:52.674]  And then I didn't give the guys clear orders.
[03:01:52.674 --> 03:01:56.082]  They found the other article, the other video again.
[03:01:56.082 --> 03:01:58.728]  This was a separate one confirming this has to do with FEMA.
[03:01:59.757 --> 03:02:12.243]  But now they're on the news saying, we don't know what it's for, we don't know why there's foreign mercs here, we don't know why they're sending their local police, and then Steve's saying they have people telling them they've got to come in and mark their guns down with them.
[03:02:12.243 --> 03:02:21.288]  So here's this newscast, and then we were just talking to Steve, and he sent me the facts, he talks to the Sheriff's Department there in Bighorn, and they say no such things going on.
[03:02:21.288 --> 03:02:23.189]  The classic denial response.
[03:02:23.189 --> 03:02:24.950]  Steve Quayle, we've seen this over and over again.
[03:02:25.520 --> 03:02:27.421]  Well, it's standard operating procedure.
[03:02:27.421 --> 03:02:28.421]  Look, here's the deal.
[03:02:28.421 --> 03:02:32.383]  A bureaucrat wants to protect their jobs at all costs.
[03:02:32.383 --> 03:02:35.505]  The sheriff is conveniently gone after this story breaks.
[03:02:35.505 --> 03:02:40.747]  I'm not saying he's avoiding anything, but look, the bottom line is that it's happening.
[03:02:40.747 --> 03:02:46.290]  The bottom line is, you can go to my bloody website, stevequayle.com, check out the photo of the day,
[03:02:46.670 --> 03:02:54.296]  And those of you that are saying, oh this is all crap, you know, go collect your G20 paycheck and then probably, you know, swallow a sword or something.
[03:02:54.296 --> 03:02:56.698]  Alex, it's happening right now.
[03:02:56.698 --> 03:02:58.559]  It's happening before our very eyes.
[03:02:58.559 --> 03:03:09.227]  It's not just happening in Montana and Wyoming, but this thing in Hardin is the most visible because that was the city of Hardin that wanted to fill this unusual prison complex.
[03:03:09.227 --> 03:03:10.528]  And by the way, Ian Bozeman,
[03:03:10.948 --> 03:03:13.730]  We don't have enough space for our prisoners.
[03:03:13.730 --> 03:03:18.233]  Most of Montana, even the local state prisoners, we don't have enough room for.
[03:03:18.233 --> 03:03:26.259]  So the thing that's interesting is that there is a reason why this thing was built and the funding for it
[03:03:26.659 --> 03:03:31.780]  Yeah, how does a little town like Hardin come up with 27 million bucks to build a thing?
[03:03:31.780 --> 03:03:33.221]  Somebody says a bond offering.
[03:03:33.221 --> 03:03:35.241]  Somebody has to buy those bonds.
[03:03:35.241 --> 03:03:37.982]  If you follow the money, you follow the intent.
[03:03:37.982 --> 03:03:40.163]  The money indicates the intent.
[03:03:40.163 --> 03:03:46.304]  So I don't care if everybody, if one man lies, another one swears to it, and everyone says, yeah, these guys are telling the truth.
[03:03:46.304 --> 03:03:48.865]  A lie is a lie, and it is what it is, and it's happening.
[03:03:49.025 --> 03:03:50.186]  Well, Steve, we know in Serbia...
[03:04:04.494 --> 03:04:09.218]  They've had black sites, the secret ghost sites with the kidnap, snatch and grab people.
[03:04:09.218 --> 03:04:10.540]  Absolutely!
[03:04:10.540 --> 03:04:14.163]  We know that they're in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan.
[03:04:14.163 --> 03:04:15.644]  We know they're in Egypt.
[03:04:15.644 --> 03:04:17.126]  We know they're in Germany.
[03:04:17.126 --> 03:04:18.427]  We know they're in Poland.
[03:04:18.427 --> 03:04:20.509]  We know they're in the Czech Republic.
[03:04:20.509 --> 03:04:24.472]  We also know that they are in other areas.
[03:04:24.472 --> 03:04:30.098]  And so this fits the classic MO where they use these private ghost contractors to run this.
[03:04:31.121 --> 03:04:33.743]  Well, and I think that's the thing that people got to do.
[03:04:33.743 --> 03:04:44.691]  By the way, Alex, the whole world, when it comes to someone admitting that a surreptitious plan is underway, goes into the I-know-nothing mode, okay?
[03:04:44.691 --> 03:04:47.453]  What's the best way to get off the hook?
[03:04:47.453 --> 03:04:48.774]  You just play dumb.
[03:04:48.774 --> 03:04:53.678]  I'm sure the caller who called that number... I know nothing!
[03:04:53.678 --> 03:04:54.138]  Nothing!
[03:04:54.138 --> 03:04:54.879]  Nothing!
[03:04:54.879 --> 03:04:58.101]  Many times, due to the compartmentalization... Come on, Jones.
[03:04:59.429 --> 03:05:00.249]  I know nothing!
[03:05:15.197 --> 03:05:16.958]  Food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:16.958 --> 03:05:18.139]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.139 --> 03:05:19.260]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.260 --> 03:05:21.141]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.141 --> 03:05:22.221]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.221 --> 03:05:24.423]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.423 --> 03:05:25.763]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.763 --> 03:05:27.284]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.284 --> 03:05:32.568]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.568 --> 03:05:36.150]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.150 --> 03:05:39.612]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:39.952 --> 03:05:41.172]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.172 --> 03:05:42.073]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.073 --> 03:05:43.193]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.193 --> 03:05:44.113]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.113 --> 03:05:45.213]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.213 --> 03:05:48.254]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:05:50.035 --> 03:05:50.955]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.598 --> 03:06:05.905]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:05.905 --> 03:06:10.431]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.431 --> 03:06:12.714]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:12.714 --> 03:06:14.336]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.336 --> 03:06:15.378]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.598 --> 03:06:24.022]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:07:00.953 --> 03:07:02.534]  Are you constantly tired?
[03:07:02.534 --> 03:07:04.376]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[03:07:04.376 --> 03:07:07.678]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[03:07:07.678 --> 03:07:10.701]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:07:10.701 --> 03:07:17.346]  Liquid Zeolite, available only at RestoreYourHealthNow.com, captures toxins and physically carries them out of your body.
[03:07:17.346 --> 03:07:21.989]  This safe and effective way of detoxifying can easily remove heavy metals and contaminants.
[03:07:21.989 --> 03:07:30.236]  Studies show that Liquid Zeolite captures triggering antigens, which cause allergies, migraines, and asthma, decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.
[03:07:30.316 --> 03:07:30.556]  Yes.
[03:07:30.556 --> 03:07:39.001]  Liquid Zeolite is a tasteless and odorless liquid that when taken daily supports a healthy, happy and active lifestyle in an increasingly toxic world.
[03:07:39.001 --> 03:07:42.303]  And Liquid Zeolite is so gentle that you won't even know you're taking it.

[03:08:02.921 --> 03:08:09.545]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.545 --> 03:08:20.132]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:20.132 --> 03:08:23.294]  The video was pulled.
[03:08:23.294 --> 03:08:24.995]  It is up now.
[03:08:24.995 --> 03:08:25.536]  We have it.
[03:08:27.031 --> 03:08:28.752]  Now, of course they're going to run PSYOPs.
[03:08:28.752 --> 03:08:34.337]  They're going to say there's no world government, no plan to get rid of the dollar as they have open meetings and announce they're doing it.
[03:08:34.337 --> 03:08:41.082]  They're going to announce there's no plan to indoctrinate their kids as they begin changing Christian hymns to worship Obama.
[03:08:41.082 --> 03:08:49.489]  They're going to say there's no gun bills when they've got more than 15 introduced, I've seen, that openly ban the Second Amendment and the Attorney General wants to ban everything he can.
[03:08:49.489 --> 03:08:50.930]  It just gives him dictatorial power.
[03:08:50.930 --> 03:08:55.694]  They say there's no death panels, then they have Newsweek saying death panels, the case for killing Granny.
[03:08:56.354 --> 03:08:57.496]  Headline.
[03:08:57.496 --> 03:09:02.923]  They deny so you'll debate whether it exists or not so you can never mobilize.
[03:09:02.923 --> 03:09:04.965]  So this is just some of what we're dealing with here.
[03:09:04.965 --> 03:09:09.151]  We're going to play this clip in just a moment and go back to Joyce Scott.
[03:09:10.366 --> 03:09:13.068]  Uh, Jeremy, Danny, uh, Joyce hung up in Montana.
[03:09:13.068 --> 03:09:13.829]  Joyce, call back.
[03:09:13.829 --> 03:09:17.071]  I wanted to go to you.
[03:09:17.071 --> 03:09:17.372]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:09:17.372 --> 03:09:20.054]  Uh, keep a line open for Joyce if we can.
[03:09:20.054 --> 03:09:20.374]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:09:20.374 --> 03:09:29.120]  Here is the video clip right now, ladies and gentlemen, from them admitting they don't know why there's mercs.
[03:09:29.961 --> 03:09:32.262]  They're saying they're police and video of it.
[03:09:32.262 --> 03:09:34.083]  They don't know what's going on with the camp.
[03:09:34.083 --> 03:09:35.623]  They don't know who's going to be held in it.
[03:09:35.623 --> 03:09:37.144]  It's a giant facility.
[03:09:37.144 --> 03:09:43.206]  And then we have an earlier newscast where the town wanted to be a FEMA camp to hold political dissonance.
[03:09:43.206 --> 03:09:44.646]  We just played that earlier.
[03:09:44.646 --> 03:09:47.647]  And my gut told me that this was the town I'd heard about a few months ago.
[03:09:47.647 --> 03:09:48.868]  We just confirmed it.
[03:09:48.868 --> 03:09:51.469]  Steve Quayle, let's play it before it goes dead again.
[03:09:51.469 --> 03:09:51.969]  Here's the video.
[03:09:52.520 --> 03:09:59.164]  Well, members of the American Police Force showed up in Hardin yesterday, driving vehicles with Hardin Police written on them.
[03:09:59.164 --> 03:10:06.389]  As Colorado's Nick Law reports, it created quite a stir, especially because Hardin doesn't have a City Police Department.
[03:10:06.389 --> 03:10:08.971]  This was the talk of the town in Hardin on Thursday.
[03:10:08.971 --> 03:10:15.315]  Mercedes decked out in the City of Hardin Police Department decals and driven by American Police Force members.
[03:10:15.765 --> 03:10:21.049]  Two Rivers Authority officials say having APF patrol the streets was never part of their agenda.
[03:10:21.049 --> 03:10:22.610]  You know, I have no idea.
[03:10:22.610 --> 03:10:27.233]  I really don't, because that's not anything that's been in the discussions that I've had with any of them.
[03:10:27.233 --> 03:10:34.297]  As it stands now, the Bighorn County Sheriff's Department is contracted to patrol the city, and APF has no jurisdiction.
[03:10:34.297 --> 03:10:38.540]  If that was changed, Peterson claims it would have to go through the City Council.
[03:10:38.540 --> 03:10:45.445]  As for the jail contract with APF, both sides are yet to agree on a deal, as bondholders rejected it again on Thursday morning.
[03:10:46.055 --> 03:10:47.675]  No, it's a complicated issue.
[03:10:47.675 --> 03:10:50.756]  There's a lot of tax laws that they're working through.
[03:10:50.756 --> 03:10:52.376]  And we're just hoping now.
[03:10:52.376 --> 03:10:54.476]  We thought we were going to get it by Tuesday night.
[03:10:54.476 --> 03:10:56.257]  We're hoping now we can get it by Friday night.
[03:10:56.257 --> 03:11:02.078]  And Two Rivers Authority officials say the contract only deals with the detention facility and the training center.
[03:11:02.078 --> 03:11:07.419]  There's no mention of a homeless shelter, animal shelter, or any other services for the area.
[03:11:07.419 --> 03:11:10.459]  Well, you know, that was never in the contract to begin with.
[03:11:10.459 --> 03:11:15.260]  I think it was just kind of on a wish list of what Captain Michael wanted to do here.
[03:11:15.703 --> 03:11:20.846]  American police force officials plan on staying in the Hardin area for the next month.
[03:11:20.846 --> 03:11:22.547]  And that was Color 8's Nick Law reporting.
[03:11:22.547 --> 03:11:28.630]  The exact details of the contract talks between Two Rivers Authority and American Police Force remain under wraps.
[03:11:28.630 --> 03:11:34.633]  So you buy a bunch of black SUVs, bring in foreign mercs, admittedly run by foreigners, and you're authorities.
[03:11:34.633 --> 03:11:39.856]  Drive a black car, wear a black uniform, got a German Shepherd and a machine gun.
[03:11:39.856 --> 03:11:41.537]  You are now an authority, Steve Coyle.
[03:11:42.346 --> 03:11:49.574]  Well, I think the thing that people have got to understand, and it's really got to sink in, is that we are under occupation.
[03:11:49.574 --> 03:11:51.736]  Look, we watched it happen in Nazi Germany.
[03:11:51.736 --> 03:12:02.428]  By the way, what's happening, and the best illustration is pre-World War II Norway, how the Nazis moved into Norway, moved into Sweden, moved into, obviously, Scandinavia.
[03:12:02.928 --> 03:12:04.509]  And assimilated into the community.
[03:12:33.108 --> 03:12:35.690]  Quote, peacekeepers in the U.S.
[03:12:35.690 --> 03:12:37.831]  Where do those peacekeepers come from?
[03:12:37.831 --> 03:12:38.592]  Well, guess what?
[03:12:38.592 --> 03:12:39.593]  The United Nations.
[03:12:39.593 --> 03:12:50.160]  And isn't it incredible that the CDC, and we've got to bring this in, the Center for Disease Control, and the World Health Organization no longer report H1N1 deaths because there's not enough of them.
[03:12:50.160 --> 03:12:54.483]  So how can you have a pandemic when there's no death to warrant the level six?
[03:12:54.483 --> 03:12:56.084]  This is all manipulated.
[03:12:56.084 --> 03:12:59.746]  It's all absolute programming, and it's all designed to put it under martial law.
[03:12:59.746 --> 03:13:02.048]  And by the way, the Hardin facility isn't for Gitmo.
[03:13:03.068 --> 03:13:05.831]  It's for people who are resistors.
[03:13:05.831 --> 03:13:07.232]  Let me stop you right there.
[03:13:07.232 --> 03:13:10.915]  They admit that in the Homeland Security reports we broke, and the MIAC reports.
[03:13:10.915 --> 03:13:14.518]  Is Steve still there?
[03:13:14.518 --> 03:13:19.202]  Steve, finishing what you said, you talked to the County Sheriff's Department.
[03:13:19.202 --> 03:13:23.665]  Steve, by the way, has given us dozens of good reports, and more than that over the years.
[03:13:23.665 --> 03:13:26.107]  So we can count on what Steve tells us.
[03:13:26.107 --> 03:13:30.411]  We've had Steve on it several times, not Steve Quell, but the other Steve as a guest, about
[03:13:31.400 --> 03:13:31.700]  Bizarre
[03:13:50.532 --> 03:13:54.075]  And I also want to mention, I had an interesting discussion with a woman with City Hall tied in with the City Council.
[03:13:54.075 --> 03:13:55.577]  I wanted to point out first of all,
[03:14:11.604 --> 03:14:14.328]  The guy that's on that newscast, he's not the mayor.
[03:14:14.328 --> 03:14:15.991]  His name's Al Peterson.
[03:14:15.991 --> 03:14:21.078]  He's with the Two Rivers Authority, and if you notice, he used the name Captain Michael.
[03:14:21.078 --> 03:14:22.400]  They said they had a contract.
[03:14:22.400 --> 03:14:22.601]  Well...
[03:14:23.513 --> 03:14:27.574]  First of all, with the Sheriff's Department, the woman, by her response, this is fake.
[03:14:27.574 --> 03:14:38.418]  And then, when I told her what I knew, I mean, she didn't know what to say, but when she said it's taken off the vehicles, in other words, in her mind, that makes it all okay.
[03:14:38.418 --> 03:14:45.120]  And, you know, to summarize all that, I just thought, no, what needs to be removed is these people from your town.
[03:14:45.120 --> 03:14:48.321]  And when I talked to the City Hall woman, you know, I just let her know,
[03:14:48.948 --> 03:14:56.574]  Look, you need to let these people at the City Council know they're there to uphold the laws of your community and to protect the locals.
[03:14:56.574 --> 03:14:58.816]  It's local municipalities.
[03:14:58.816 --> 03:15:01.438]  And she said... Go ahead.
[03:15:01.438 --> 03:15:02.179]  What's that?
[03:15:02.179 --> 03:15:02.659]  Go ahead.
[03:15:02.659 --> 03:15:05.421]  I asked her, who's the Two Rivers Authority?
[03:15:05.421 --> 03:15:09.184]  Well, they're here for economic... they're set up for economic development.
[03:15:09.184 --> 03:15:15.369]  So let's be clear, it's just like LCRA here in Central Texas has SWAT teams, armored vehicles, private jails.
[03:15:15.369 --> 03:15:17.211]  It's a quasi-private group.
[03:15:17.211 --> 03:15:18.292]  They take over towns.
[03:15:18.812 --> 03:15:19.252]  Yes.
[03:15:41.105 --> 03:15:41.926]  I'd like to say one more thing.
[03:15:41.926 --> 03:15:44.327]  I've got to go to other callers or I'm not going to be able to get to others.
[03:15:44.327 --> 03:15:46.628]  Steve, can we keep you to the bottom of the hour another five minutes?
[03:15:46.628 --> 03:15:46.888]  Sure.
[03:15:46.888 --> 03:15:50.070]  Okay, because I want to be able to take calls and get their info.
[03:15:50.070 --> 03:15:51.090]  Let's continue here.
[03:15:51.090 --> 03:15:53.612]  Let's talk to Scott in Nebraska.
[03:15:53.612 --> 03:15:54.252]  You're on the air.
[03:15:54.252 --> 03:15:56.153]  Go ahead.
[03:15:56.153 --> 03:15:58.334]  Yeah, it's the Work Ethic Camp.
[03:15:58.334 --> 03:15:59.635]  I'm in Nebraska.
[03:15:59.635 --> 03:16:05.318]  It's a little town on the western edge of Nebraska right next to Wyoming, Colorado called McCook.
[03:16:05.318 --> 03:16:08.880]  Just Google Work Ethic Camp Nebraska.
[03:16:08.880 --> 03:16:09.200]  This is
[03:16:10.664 --> 03:16:14.728]  It's disguised as a drug rehab prison.
[03:16:14.728 --> 03:16:16.711]  This is a FEMA camp if I've ever seen one.
[03:16:16.711 --> 03:16:19.233]  This is a concentration camp.
[03:16:19.233 --> 03:16:21.616]  Can you see any of that yet?
[03:16:21.616 --> 03:16:23.819]  No, but I'm aware of how they camouflage these.
[03:16:23.819 --> 03:16:25.621]  Notice I said this was really a camp.
[03:16:26.633 --> 03:16:32.175]  For camp x-ray prisoners and then we found mainstream news out of Billings saying that.
[03:16:32.175 --> 03:16:34.216]  Now I'm not bragging about my mind.
[03:16:34.216 --> 03:16:43.860]  When you study this stuff 15, 16, 18 hours a day, you start understanding the patterns and then you know what you're seeing immediately no matter what they say.
[03:16:43.860 --> 03:16:45.641]  But in this case, they're admitting it all.
[03:16:45.641 --> 03:16:46.241]  Steve Quayle.
[03:16:47.128 --> 03:16:51.771]  Well, I think the bottom line is that whatever they do, they always do in plain sight.
[03:16:51.771 --> 03:17:02.176]  And remember, redefining terms is a Hegelian dialectic, and we watched that in Hitler, and you know, you and I start screaming when they start talking about Homeland Security.
[03:17:02.176 --> 03:17:14.163]  By the way, wasn't it just last week that Homeland Security supposedly had done penance for their identifying all of the terrorists, and now they're back up in full force again, and guess who's on the list?
[03:17:14.163 --> 03:17:15.704]  Everybody was on the list before.
[03:17:16.324 --> 03:17:21.507]  Now, Alex, we may be close, but there's a timing issue before you and I have to say goodbye today.
[03:17:21.507 --> 03:17:26.170]  The idea of the timing, it looks like October-November is the time period.
[03:17:26.170 --> 03:17:33.314]  I just got an email in, you need to hear this, the Louisiana State Police are doing explosive ordnance device training.
[03:17:33.314 --> 03:17:36.116]  They're running classes right now for all their parishes.
[03:17:36.116 --> 03:17:39.538]  The policeman in this class told me they're getting ready to raise the terror alert.
[03:17:39.918 --> 03:17:49.223]  Looking at some weird United Nations camera vehicle group on I-20 in Mississippi at this point, and the guy said, he said, thank you, Frank, he's saying, I'm trying to get pictures.
[03:17:49.223 --> 03:17:55.726]  So, the thing is, look, we come out, we speak about the vaccination, they say, okay, we'll just go the next thing.
[03:17:55.726 --> 03:17:57.226]  We identify the next thing.
[03:17:57.226 --> 03:17:58.367]  They just go the next thing.
[03:17:58.367 --> 03:18:04.170]  These people are not without plan DEFG if we expose ABC.
[03:18:04.890 --> 03:18:07.574]  But it still puts people into the same position.
[03:18:07.574 --> 03:18:13.641]  They have got to make sure that if they could not go to a store for 30 days, they could stay where they're at.
[03:18:13.641 --> 03:18:22.493]  By the way, our governor just made a statement, I guess, today, that he's not going to allow anybody with federal authority to take away the guns, the food, or
[03:18:22.913 --> 03:18:27.715]  That is the state rights that we possess and we intend to stand with.
[03:18:27.715 --> 03:18:31.297]  So, you know, again, we've got a very outspoken state governor.
[03:18:31.297 --> 03:18:33.798]  People are asking me, will succession succeed?
[03:18:33.798 --> 03:18:34.378]  No.
[03:18:34.378 --> 03:18:35.959]  We're going to be balkanized.
[03:18:35.959 --> 03:18:41.301]  The only question is, will enough people be gotten out of harm's way in time?
[03:18:41.301 --> 03:18:44.062]  Steve, that's another nexus point.
[03:18:44.062 --> 03:18:48.464]  Your governor said you're going to manufacture guns in the state outside federal control.
[03:18:49.665 --> 03:18:53.188]  Northcom out of Colorado said we're not going to allow that.
[03:18:53.188 --> 03:19:05.216]  And then now Obama's come in with Justice Department letters threatening the states, threatening them with the John Warner Defense Authorization Act that stated homeland security is to block governors and legislatures.
[03:19:05.216 --> 03:19:13.042]  So that's what this is, is a major federalized, internationalized cancer probe that they've put in to this town.
[03:19:13.666 --> 03:19:26.915]  Absolutely, Alex, and one of the things I've got to tell everybody, you've got to understand, and those of you who are Christians have got to pray for the people who are absolutely in state office that are standing up in federal office.
[03:19:26.915 --> 03:19:32.339]  Because, look, they have assassination teams, just like the old video series America.
[03:19:32.339 --> 03:19:36.102]  You remember where the Russians took out the Congress and the Senate?
[03:19:36.102 --> 03:19:37.703]  Well, these guys have got the same plan.
[03:19:37.703 --> 03:19:41.426]  Anybody that doesn't go along, they either pay them off or they blow them away.
[03:19:41.806 --> 03:19:44.528]  When you hear the words water purification what comes to mind?
[03:20:05.469 --> 03:20:08.794]  Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[03:20:08.794 --> 03:20:12.519]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[03:20:12.519 --> 03:20:20.230]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[03:20:22.005 --> 03:20:22.465]  I think so.
[03:20:51.266 --> 03:20:54.009]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:20:54.009 --> 03:20:54.670]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today!
[03:21:02.856 --> 03:21:05.199]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[03:21:05.199 --> 03:21:11.445]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?
[03:21:11.445 --> 03:21:15.590]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman of The International Forecaster.

[03:21:22.737 --> 03:21:23.378]  We're good to go.
[03:21:39.540 --> 03:21:43.362]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero and we knew what to do.
[03:22:09.241 --> 03:22:10.503]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:22:10.503 --> 03:22:17.532]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:22:17.532 --> 03:22:26.064]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:22:26.431 --> 03:22:33.535]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:22:33.535 --> 03:22:36.697]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:22:36.697 --> 03:22:41.821]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[03:22:42.461 --> 03:22:45.542]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:22:45.542 --> 03:22:51.584]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[03:22:51.584 --> 03:22:54.505]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:22:54.505 --> 03:22:59.447]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:23:00.796 --> 03:23:07.743]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Hunter safes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[03:23:07.743 --> 03:23:10.606]  Graf Hunter safes are known as the Rolls Royce of safes.
[03:23:10.606 --> 03:23:15.231]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[03:23:15.231 --> 03:23:19.736]  Whether it's a custom fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[03:23:19.736 --> 03:23:21.658]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[03:23:21.798 --> 03:23:24.361]  At Graph Undersafes, security is their sole purpose.

[03:23:31.069 --> 03:23:35.393]  Graph Undersafes are fire and burglary resistant and have a lifetime warranty.
[03:23:35.393 --> 03:23:41.160]  They have established an unequal reputation of quality for supplying their safes and vault doors to residential customers.
[03:23:41.220 --> 03:23:42.100]  He's going the distance!
[03:23:42.100 --> 03:23:42.881]  He's going for speed!
[03:24:12.119 --> 03:24:12.700]  Steve Quayle.
[03:24:12.700 --> 03:24:15.122]  SteveQuayle.com is our guest.
[03:24:15.122 --> 03:24:18.525]  InfoWars.com is my main website along with PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:24:18.525 --> 03:24:26.613]  We'll continue to have Steve on throughout the week with reports as he learns more with people on the ground there in Montana.
[03:24:26.613 --> 03:24:29.736]  You will definitely have important reports here on this radio show.
[03:24:29.736 --> 03:24:31.437]  Steve, I want to jam in a few final calls.
[03:24:31.437 --> 03:24:34.480]  I'll continue with the calls after you leave us.
[03:24:34.480 --> 03:24:35.441]  Up next here is
[03:24:37.605 --> 03:24:39.767]  Let's talk to Diane in Montana.
[03:24:39.767 --> 03:24:41.788]  Diane in Montana, where this is going on.
[03:24:41.788 --> 03:24:44.330]  But as Steve said, it's happening everywhere.
[03:24:44.330 --> 03:24:46.431]  Diane, what's your info?
[03:24:46.431 --> 03:24:48.013]  Okay, September 9th.
[03:24:48.013 --> 03:24:54.357]  Steve, I don't know if you remember me, from Superior, Montana, which is about 50 miles west of Missoula.
[03:24:54.357 --> 03:24:55.478]  Right.
[03:24:55.478 --> 03:25:02.483]  We had a small incident where there was a bunch of SUVs, black Hummers, you name it.
[03:25:02.483 --> 03:25:03.144]  It was all there.
[03:25:06.027 --> 03:25:06.768]  We're good to go.
[03:25:33.766 --> 03:25:35.827]  Well, I need everybody in the area to get cameras.
[03:25:35.827 --> 03:25:40.590]  They're very cheap now, video cameras, for as cheap as $100 that shoot decent quality.
[03:25:40.590 --> 03:25:43.492]  Everybody needs to be shooting this and uploading it to YouTube.
[03:25:43.492 --> 03:25:43.972]  Steve Coyle.
[03:25:44.482 --> 03:25:57.151]  Well, I think, you know, that's obvious and as we're talking, Alex, I think that people need to become eyes and ears and email you stuff in real time and make, you know, put video important of stuff.
[03:25:57.151 --> 03:26:02.795]  Don't just, you know, go out and just take dormant military vehicles, but vehicles that are motion-like.
[03:26:02.795 --> 03:26:05.657]  The report we just got, and let me share this, too.
[03:26:07.358 --> 03:26:09.079]  People have got to stay up on this.
[03:26:09.079 --> 03:26:11.820]  You know, there are reports of sailors being vaccinated.
[03:26:11.820 --> 03:26:16.663]  I stated, this is critical for people to understand, you guys, the Pentagon, shame on you.
[03:26:16.663 --> 03:26:28.809]  I stated that the easiest way to deal with America before a full-scale assault on this country was to poison the vaccines and then let them be tested on servicemen.
[03:26:28.809 --> 03:26:33.791]  And because this is a matter of national security, Alex, big time, we're not going to get any true reports.
[03:26:33.991 --> 03:26:41.375]  And now we're hearing, Bob Chapman's confirmed with his sources, and he's always been accurate, that they're dying on the ships, not just quarantining them.
[03:26:41.375 --> 03:26:42.255]  Well, absolutely.
[03:26:42.255 --> 03:26:51.821]  And see, this is the thing, too, that people have got to understand, that we have a specific concern out there for whatever it's going to be.
[03:26:51.821 --> 03:26:59.885]  They're going to initially utilize the H1N1, H5N1, whatever else they come up with, but the idea is this.
[03:27:00.345 --> 03:27:04.666]  Let me ask Diane in closing, what did the locals think, and how many FBI FEMA troops were there?
[03:27:04.666 --> 03:27:07.527]  Okay, there were six vehicles when my husband went right by them.
[03:27:07.527 --> 03:27:09.228]  He called back and said, lock down.
[03:27:09.228 --> 03:27:13.749]  I don't know what's going on, if there's escaped prisoners or what.
[03:27:29.432 --> 03:27:33.116]  Same time helicopter came through, right overhead.
[03:27:33.116 --> 03:27:45.989]  Called his secretary who was coming in on I-90, told her to check that area out and look at it, and that's when she saw all the camo guys all over the mountainside just crawling up.
[03:27:45.989 --> 03:27:50.013]  Asked around town, people didn't think anything about it.
[03:27:50.600 --> 03:27:51.961]  Yeah, this is insane.
[03:27:51.961 --> 03:27:53.481]  They're definitely probing and testing.
[03:27:53.481 --> 03:27:55.362]  Thank you so much, Diane.
[03:27:55.362 --> 03:27:57.443]  Let's cram in another call here.
[03:27:57.443 --> 03:28:00.284]  Let's talk to Jeremy in Alaska.
[03:28:00.284 --> 03:28:02.525]  Jeremy, what's your intel?
[03:28:02.525 --> 03:28:03.686]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:28:03.686 --> 03:28:05.407]  Hey, buddy.
[03:28:05.407 --> 03:28:07.267]  Actually, I'm a sovereign.
[03:28:07.267 --> 03:28:08.408]  I'm in Alaska.
[03:28:08.408 --> 03:28:12.030]  I want to commend you on the work that you've done, sir.
[03:28:12.030 --> 03:28:17.112]  You're not responsible for waking me up, but you're definitely one of the people that kept me awake.
[03:28:17.112 --> 03:28:19.493]  I've been studying law over the last year.
[03:28:20.297 --> 03:28:30.024]  And from a Lieutenant Colonel in the Marines for 35 years and also some other people that are international attorneys.
[03:28:30.024 --> 03:28:35.047]  And from what I'm understanding is there's this NAFTA free trade agreement?
[03:28:35.047 --> 03:28:42.172]  Yes, and under that they have a military sharing agreement 2002-2008 to occupy the US with foreign troops.
[03:28:42.172 --> 03:28:44.293]  That is mainstream announcement.
[03:28:44.293 --> 03:28:44.834]  Steve Coyle.
[03:28:45.404 --> 03:28:56.675]  Well, and again, that's absolutely correct, and I think everybody's got to understand this by putting us into a level six bio-emergency under the World Health Organization.
[03:28:56.675 --> 03:29:02.740]  In essence, who just got appointed head of the United Nations Security Council for the first time?
[03:29:02.740 --> 03:29:04.462]  The President of the United States.
[03:29:04.462 --> 03:29:08.386]  Putting it all together, Alex, I don't believe there is a more totalitarian
[03:29:08.826 --> 03:29:12.147]  Alright, Steve Quayle, we will get a report from you tomorrow.
[03:29:12.147 --> 03:29:13.587]  Can you join us again tomorrow?
[03:29:31.092 --> 03:29:31.733]  Yes, I can.
[03:29:31.733 --> 03:29:32.573]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:29:32.573 --> 03:29:33.574]  Thank you, everyone, for listening.
[03:29:33.574 --> 03:29:34.014]  Thank you.
[03:29:34.014 --> 03:29:35.636]  While he's on hold, let's get him set up now.
[03:29:35.636 --> 03:29:44.143]  I'm gonna come back with a recap of this, other key news, announce the contest winners, and you will be hearing more on this show about what's happening up there.
[03:29:44.143 --> 03:29:46.325]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[03:29:46.325 --> 03:29:51.709]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:51.709 --> 03:29:53.110]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.110 --> 03:29:55.632]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.632 --> 03:29:58.335]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.084 --> 03:30:05.328]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.328 --> 03:30:07.330]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.330 --> 03:30:15.859]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.859 --> 03:30:21.404]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.404 --> 03:30:23.026]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.246 --> 03:30:29.770]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.770 --> 03:30:40.818]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.818 --> 03:30:41.598]  That's right.
[03:30:41.598 --> 03:30:44.160]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[03:30:53.927 --> 03:30:58.150]  It's here!
[03:30:58.150 --> 03:31:10.340]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[03:31:10.340 --> 03:31:17.986]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[03:31:18.686 --> 03:31:26.128]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[03:31:26.128 --> 03:31:37.850]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[03:31:37.850 --> 03:31:41.811]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[03:31:41.811 --> 03:31:44.091]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[03:31:44.091 --> 03:31:47.912]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[03:32:01.195 --> 03:32:07.078]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[03:32:07.078 --> 03:32:12.200]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[03:32:12.200 --> 03:32:13.421]  That was then.
[03:32:13.421 --> 03:32:14.721]  This is now.
[03:32:14.721 --> 03:32:17.443]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[03:32:17.443 --> 03:32:23.505]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to 4 hours of real-time audio and video.
[03:32:23.505 --> 03:32:28.768]  The DigiNet Sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings,
[03:32:29.028 --> 03:32:32.711]  Proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[03:32:32.711 --> 03:32:36.174]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[03:32:36.174 --> 03:32:40.657]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[03:32:40.657 --> 03:32:42.158]  Video never lies.

[03:32:52.887 --> 03:32:53.427]  Or call 1-800-637-8255.
[03:33:00.074 --> 03:33:26.811]  I say I shot the sheriff But I swear it was in self-defense, yeah Freedom came my way one day When I started out of town, yeah All of a sudden I saw Sherrif Don Brown
[03:33:31.892 --> 03:33:34.093]  This is a confirmed FEMA camp.
[03:33:34.093 --> 03:33:36.974]  The locals are being secretive about it.
[03:33:36.974 --> 03:33:43.297]  We found an earlier newscast from April of this year
[03:34:02.108 --> 03:34:04.269]  I'm against it.
[03:34:04.269 --> 03:34:08.132]  I don't think it's a good idea.
[03:34:08.132 --> 03:34:10.993]  It's too much of a security risk.
[03:34:10.993 --> 03:34:13.995]  I don't think we want to have Al-Qaeda prisoners in Montana.
[03:34:13.995 --> 03:34:16.016]  It's a security risk that I don't think we want to have.
[03:34:32.930 --> 03:34:40.431]  However, Senators Max Baucus and John Tester and Representative Denny Rehberg say they do support the jail in finding viable contracts.
[03:34:40.431 --> 03:34:47.633]  Tuesday, Hardin City Council gave two Rivers Detention Center officials the green light to pursue a contract to accept Gitmo prisoners.
[03:34:47.633 --> 03:34:52.534]  President Barack Obama has said he plans to close Guantanamo by next January.
[03:34:52.534 --> 03:34:56.595]  Jail officials say their facility is secure enough to hold the terror suspects.
[03:34:56.595 --> 03:34:58.475]  We understand this is a long shot at best.
[03:34:58.875 --> 03:35:06.858]  And really what we're asking for him is just to come out and take a look at our situation and see if it would fit for him.
[03:35:06.858 --> 03:35:07.278]  The U.S.
[03:35:07.278 --> 03:35:16.682]  Justice Department says right now the Gitmo Detainee Review Task Force is determining whether each prisoner will be prosecuted or sent overseas.
[03:35:16.682 --> 03:35:21.343]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is that facility.
[03:35:21.343 --> 03:35:24.185]  Now they have another Supermax that's closed in Montana.
[03:35:24.185 --> 03:35:26.806]  They say they're going to hold people in, including U.S.
[03:35:26.806 --> 03:35:27.246]  citizens.
[03:35:27.246 --> 03:35:27.606]  In fact,
[03:35:28.675 --> 03:35:28.995]  U.S.
[03:35:28.995 --> 03:35:30.477]  News & World Report reported on it.
[03:35:30.477 --> 03:35:32.558]  I need Paul Watson on this.
[03:35:32.558 --> 03:35:34.760]  My best researcher on this.
[03:35:34.760 --> 03:35:37.643]  They're all great, but Paul really can ferret stuff out even when I can't find it.
[03:35:37.643 --> 03:35:47.191]  I remember it was in the news about the Supermax, and then it said, oh, and there's already some terrorists there, some animal rights activists and people are being held, and their families aren't allowed to visit them.
[03:35:47.191 --> 03:35:48.432]  It's like Gitmo.
[03:35:48.432 --> 03:35:49.673]  But that's a Supermax.
[03:35:49.673 --> 03:35:51.995]  This is another bigger facility for whole families.
[03:35:53.114 --> 03:35:56.336]  And then we have this other newscast where they're all being shifty about it now.
[03:35:56.336 --> 03:36:04.101]  Looks like they got the contract when black vehicles saying hardened police show up with foreigners going, we are in gun control.
[03:36:04.101 --> 03:36:06.983]  You must list our firearms with us.
[03:36:06.983 --> 03:36:13.227]  I mean, and since we broke this today, Steve Quayle really broke it this weekend, but it broke big here today.
[03:36:13.227 --> 03:36:16.069]  They pulled the American Police Force site down.
[03:36:16.069 --> 03:36:17.570]  They're pulling videos down.
[03:36:17.570 --> 03:36:19.852]  This is off the charts creepy.
[03:36:20.771 --> 03:36:27.214]  I mean, we have run right into a nest, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:36:27.214 --> 03:36:27.814]  Unbelievable.
[03:36:27.814 --> 03:36:28.654]  Let's go ahead and play it.
[03:36:44.738 --> 03:36:47.319]  This was the talk of the town in Hardin on Thursday.
[03:36:47.319 --> 03:36:54.122]  Mercedes decked out in the City of Hardin Police Department decals and driven by American Police Force members.
[03:36:54.122 --> 03:36:59.404]  Two Rivers Authority officials say having APF patrol the streets was never part of their agenda.
[03:36:59.404 --> 03:37:00.965]  You know, I have no idea.
[03:37:00.965 --> 03:37:05.607]  I really don't because that's not anything that's been in the discussions that I've had with any of them.
[03:37:05.607 --> 03:37:12.110]  As it stands now, the Bighorn County Sheriff's Department is contracted to patrol the city and APF has no jurisdiction.
[03:37:12.648 --> 03:37:16.891]  If that was changed, Peterson claims it would have to go through the City Council.
[03:37:16.891 --> 03:37:23.776]  As for the jail contract with APF, both sides are yet to agree on a deal, as bondholders rejected it again on Thursday morning.
[03:37:24.400 --> 03:37:26.020]  No, it's a complicated issue.
[03:37:26.020 --> 03:37:29.121]  There's a lot of tax laws that they're working through.
[03:37:29.121 --> 03:37:30.742]  And we're just hoping now.
[03:37:30.742 --> 03:37:32.842]  We thought we were going to get it by Tuesday night.
[03:37:32.842 --> 03:37:34.623]  We're hoping now we can get it by Friday night.
[03:37:34.623 --> 03:37:40.444]  And Two Rivers Authority officials say the contract only deals with the detention facility and the training center.
[03:37:40.444 --> 03:37:45.786]  There's no mention of a homeless shelter, animal shelter, or any other services for the area.
[03:37:45.786 --> 03:37:48.807]  Well, you know, that was never in the contract to begin with.
[03:37:48.807 --> 03:37:53.628]  I think it was just kind of on a wish list of what Captain Michael wanted to do here.
[03:37:54.045 --> 03:37:59.206]  American Police Force officials plan on staying in the Hardin area for the next month.
[03:37:59.206 --> 03:38:00.907]  And that was Color 8's Nick Law reporting.
[03:38:00.907 --> 03:38:06.869]  The exact details of the contract talks between Two Rivers Authority and American Police Force remain under wraps.
[03:38:06.869 --> 03:38:09.789]  So, you got a FEMA camp.
[03:38:09.789 --> 03:38:12.830]  You've got a private prison facility there.
[03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:16.631]  The President's looking at putting a FEMA camp there with prisoners.
[03:38:16.631 --> 03:38:17.972]  It's been built recently.
[03:38:18.948 --> 03:38:22.471]  Locals ask about it and are told to shut up.
[03:38:22.471 --> 03:38:33.640]  And then Captain Michael with his foreign merc group, this is an international foreign group, says, oh, it's just a wish list they're driving around with their new patrol vehicles.
[03:38:33.640 --> 03:38:36.922]  Then you call up, the Sheriff's Department goes, we don't know what you're talking about.
[03:38:36.922 --> 03:38:37.783]  None of this exists.
[03:38:37.783 --> 03:38:38.944]  Ha ha.
[03:38:38.944 --> 03:38:43.107]  And here's another whitewash report.
[03:38:43.107 --> 03:38:43.607]  Here it is.
[03:38:45.071 --> 03:38:45.131]  Oh!
[03:39:02.672 --> 03:39:02.752]  Oh!
[03:39:02.752 --> 03:39:02.812]  Oh!
[03:39:17.504 --> 03:39:20.667]  Um, it probably is to those that don't know what's going on.
[03:39:20.667 --> 03:39:28.195]  Carrie Smith is the wife of Two Rivers Authority Executive Director Greg Smith, who was recently placed on administrative leave.
[03:39:28.195 --> 03:39:30.557]  No public explanation has been given.
[03:39:30.557 --> 03:39:37.544]  Carrie wouldn't comment on her husband's paid leave, but says the truth about APF will be revealed and the public has nothing to fear.
[03:39:37.544 --> 03:39:39.566]  You can't panic.
[03:39:39.566 --> 03:39:41.848]  You just go with the flow and everything will be fine.
[03:39:42.327 --> 03:39:46.850]  But other Hardin residents are concerned about the lack of information so far.
[03:39:46.850 --> 03:39:49.592]  I'm concerned about the legitimacy of who they are.
[03:39:49.592 --> 03:39:54.255]  There's a lot of secrecy going on, I guess is what I would say.
[03:39:54.255 --> 03:40:02.360]  American Police Force says it will meet with the media Saturday morning and answer questions regarding the group's secrecy and discuss its future plans for Hardin.
[03:40:02.360 --> 03:40:03.461]  I mean, it's wonderful.
[03:40:03.461 --> 03:40:04.662]  It's gonna be great.
[03:40:04.662 --> 03:40:09.205]  I don't understand who this company is and why they... Where were they two years ago?
[03:40:11.141 --> 03:40:11.961]  That's all I have to say.
[03:40:11.961 --> 03:40:13.842]  Where were they before the ground broke?
[03:40:13.842 --> 03:40:20.404]  The bondholders are yet to approve the contract between Two Rivers Authority and American Police Force.
[03:40:20.404 --> 03:40:22.885]  Now, APF is on site right now.
[03:40:22.885 --> 03:40:24.966]  They're taking inventory of the jail.
[03:40:24.966 --> 03:40:29.928]  They say they'll remain in the area for the next couple weeks to assess the situation.
[03:40:29.928 --> 03:40:35.030]  Reporting live in the newsroom, Nick Long, Colorade News.
[03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:38.111]  Oh, I'm having trouble right now even dealing with this and processing it.
[03:40:43.283 --> 03:40:53.811]  What did the clergy response team say when they finally announced it and had the preachers going, we're training people to go to the camps, turn their guns in, Romans 13, go easy, go with the flow and everything will be alright.
[03:40:53.811 --> 03:40:55.332]  They're reading off a script.
[03:40:55.332 --> 03:40:58.494]  That was from Louisiana, this is from Montana.
[03:40:58.494 --> 03:41:05.439]  And man, talk about spookville, CIA-ville, black sedans running like roaches, when you flip the light on at 3 a.m.
[03:41:05.439 --> 03:41:09.282]  in your apartment and there's like big fat roaches going, and they're like,
[03:41:11.082 --> 03:41:14.784]  Running as fast as they can.
[03:41:14.784 --> 03:41:19.307]  Press conference on Saturday.
[03:41:19.307 --> 03:41:21.508]  We got a FEMA camp for real here, boy.
[03:41:21.508 --> 03:41:24.350]  Because they usually camouflage them and claim them for something else.
[03:41:24.350 --> 03:41:27.392]  We have them red-handed with foreign mercs.
[03:41:27.392 --> 03:41:32.415]  This is very interesting.
[03:41:32.415 --> 03:41:33.415]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:41:33.415 --> 03:41:35.877]  Believe me, you're going to hear some key reports here in the next few days.
[03:41:38.202 --> 03:41:38.802]  Oh boy.
[03:41:38.802 --> 03:41:39.963]  Okay.
[03:41:39.963 --> 03:41:43.726]  I meant to make greater fanfare of this, but I will announce it today.
[03:41:43.726 --> 03:41:46.168]  The article's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:41:46.168 --> 03:41:48.529]  Need to be contacted by the winners.
[03:41:48.529 --> 03:41:51.632]  I'll make the announcement right now.
[03:41:51.632 --> 03:41:52.792]  Where did my first place go?
[03:41:52.792 --> 03:41:57.776]  I had my first place winner here.
[03:41:57.776 --> 03:41:58.877]  Now I don't have it.
[03:41:58.877 --> 03:41:59.337]  Oh, here it is.
[03:41:59.337 --> 03:41:59.938]  First place.
[03:41:59.938 --> 03:42:01.599]  Oh, it's written on the back of a FEMA camp article.
[03:42:01.599 --> 03:42:02.640]  Sorry.
[03:42:02.640 --> 03:42:04.441]  And I'm on the White House enemies list.
[03:42:04.441 --> 03:42:05.322]  You know, there's nothing to...
[03:42:06.337 --> 03:42:11.300]  I just, I'm literally living in a Twilight Zone episode.
[03:42:11.300 --> 03:42:12.381]  I'm on the telephone.
[03:42:12.381 --> 03:42:13.442]  I'm with Charlie Sheen.
[03:42:13.442 --> 03:42:14.222]  The phone rings.
[03:42:14.222 --> 03:42:15.423]  Buzz Aldrin.
[03:42:15.423 --> 03:42:16.724]  This is a month before it came out.
[03:42:16.724 --> 03:42:17.945]  Oh, there's massive water on the moon.
[03:42:17.945 --> 03:42:18.946]  It'll be announced in a month.
[03:42:18.946 --> 03:42:20.547]  I see it on the front page a month later.
[03:42:20.547 --> 03:42:23.429]  I got Dave Mustaine Megadeth over here.
[03:42:23.429 --> 03:42:25.570]  I got making films on the enemies list.
[03:42:25.570 --> 03:42:27.411]  I've got FEMA Camp Surreal.
[03:42:27.411 --> 03:42:30.954]  They're openly doing forced inoculations, openly announcing world government.
[03:42:30.954 --> 03:42:32.675]  You're all in the Twilight Zone here with me.
[03:42:34.520 --> 03:42:45.690]  The soccer moms are driving around dreaming about their football teams and the average person has no idea what's going on.
[03:42:45.690 --> 03:42:46.911]  It's getting too weird, folks.
[03:42:46.911 --> 03:42:51.055]  It's getting too weird.
[03:42:51.055 --> 03:42:52.716]  Okay.
[03:42:52.716 --> 03:43:00.203]  The reason it took me a couple weeks longer to judge these and announce them was because there were hundreds of great entries and I wanted to watch them all.
[03:43:02.005 --> 03:43:03.928]  Then I wanted to get my cruise review.
[03:43:03.928 --> 03:43:10.038]  I had three different people in the office watch the top 10 or 15 contenders.
[03:43:10.038 --> 03:43:12.783]  And they all came up with the same order of the winners.
[03:43:16.303 --> 03:43:24.047]  I guess on the Charlie Sheen contest, is it fair to tell the last winner of the two contests they can't be part of this contest because they keep winning?
[03:43:24.047 --> 03:43:25.528]  But, you know, it's my contest.
[03:43:25.528 --> 03:43:26.348]  Rules, I can do whatever I want.
[03:43:26.348 --> 03:43:28.509]  It's whoever the best winner is.
[03:43:28.509 --> 03:43:31.451]  San Francisco, Bay Area, the U.S.
[03:43:31.451 --> 03:43:32.611]  of Terror.
[03:43:32.611 --> 03:43:33.772]  That's their YouTube channel.
[03:43:33.772 --> 03:43:36.693]  They win first prize on the second.
[03:43:36.693 --> 03:43:37.494]  And we had debates.
[03:43:37.494 --> 03:43:41.316]  I said, should I be like a communist and give it to the second best?
[03:43:41.316 --> 03:43:42.256]  And he already won.
[03:43:42.256 --> 03:43:43.557]  Everybody said, no, give it to the best.
[03:43:44.725 --> 03:43:50.688]  Separately in my office, letting other people judge, they came up with the same winner as I did.
[03:43:50.688 --> 03:43:55.710]  So you gotta give it to the winner.
[03:43:55.710 --> 03:43:56.811]  So that's the end of it.
[03:43:56.811 --> 03:44:00.432]  I asked Rob Dew last week, I said, who do you think's the best?
[03:44:00.432 --> 03:44:01.813]  And he watched a whole bunch of them.
[03:44:01.813 --> 03:44:02.973]  I say 10, 15.
[03:44:02.973 --> 03:44:03.614]  Dew, come on in here.
[03:44:03.614 --> 03:44:08.136]  How many, after I'd already judged them secretly, how many of these did you watch?
[03:44:10.168 --> 03:44:10.608]  How many?
[03:44:10.608 --> 03:44:11.829]  I watched everyone.
[03:44:11.829 --> 03:44:15.651]  Oh, so you watched more than... I watched everyone that was on our contest page.
[03:44:15.651 --> 03:44:16.772]  All three pages.
[03:44:16.772 --> 03:44:18.313]  I watched everyone.
[03:44:18.313 --> 03:44:22.816]  And you came to the same winner separately, not even knowing who I was going to choose?
[03:44:22.816 --> 03:44:25.578]  I really liked... Because I was wanting to take it away from him.
[03:44:25.578 --> 03:44:27.759]  I'm like... Oh yeah, yeah.
[03:44:27.759 --> 03:44:29.440]  We had a meeting here... You said that, yeah.
[03:44:29.440 --> 03:44:31.261]  I said, I think San Francisco is the best.
[03:44:31.261 --> 03:44:32.822]  And you said, well, he won last time.
[03:44:32.822 --> 03:44:34.023]  I don't know if we could do that.
[03:44:34.023 --> 03:44:36.865]  And I said, I mean, he took...
[03:44:37.125 --> 03:44:38.526]  It's kind of like Roger Stalbach.
[03:44:38.526 --> 03:44:39.727]  He won all the Super Bowls.
[03:44:39.727 --> 03:44:40.627]  He's Roger Stalbach.
[03:44:40.627 --> 03:44:41.588]  I mean, he gets to win.
[03:44:41.588 --> 03:44:44.330]  We're not commies here.
[03:44:44.330 --> 03:44:45.090]  You know, like there.
[03:44:45.090 --> 03:44:45.891]  There's Google.
[03:44:45.891 --> 03:44:47.432]  He went and did posters about Google.
[03:44:47.432 --> 03:44:48.673]  He did them about SRI.
[03:44:48.673 --> 03:44:49.533]  In front of their offices.
[03:44:49.533 --> 03:44:52.815]  Yeah, and then he made his own swine flu poster and put that everywhere.
[03:44:52.815 --> 03:44:54.757]  And his posters look good.
[03:44:54.757 --> 03:44:55.717]  They're easy to read.
[03:44:55.717 --> 03:44:57.659]  He went after Facebook.
[03:45:00.140 --> 03:45:04.283]  He went and did, I think, way above and beyond what anybody else did.
[03:45:04.283 --> 03:45:06.205]  Well, we need to keep these posted for a week or two.
[03:45:06.205 --> 03:45:07.626]  They need to get mega viral.
[03:45:07.626 --> 03:45:07.886]  Yeah.
[03:45:07.886 --> 03:45:10.028]  This poster contest is so good.
[03:45:10.028 --> 03:45:11.529]  He wins.
[03:45:11.529 --> 03:45:12.289]  Those folks win.
[03:45:12.289 --> 03:45:13.970]  Los Angeles, we have a new winner.
[03:45:13.970 --> 03:45:14.191]  Yeah.
[03:45:14.191 --> 03:45:15.932]  Los Angeles got second place.
[03:45:15.932 --> 03:45:18.454]  I think it's most of the We Are Change people from Los Angeles.
[03:45:18.454 --> 03:45:20.355]  But it's a separate, yeah, it's Freedom Is Free 1776.
[03:45:20.355 --> 03:45:21.036]  Yeah.
[03:45:21.036 --> 03:45:22.817]  They did great.
[03:45:22.817 --> 03:45:27.641]  Tomorrow, unless we're in Total Martial Law or something, I'll be playing these on air.
[03:45:27.641 --> 03:45:28.781]  And New York.
[03:45:29.602 --> 03:45:31.903]  Who won second place last time, they won third place.
[03:45:31.903 --> 03:45:32.603]  Right, right.
[03:45:32.603 --> 03:45:33.864]  So these are just good filmmakers.
[03:45:33.864 --> 03:45:36.005]  These are good activists, and that's who won.
[03:45:36.005 --> 03:45:39.166]  They do things that are going to get people's attention, which I like.
[03:45:39.166 --> 03:45:40.466]  You know, they were out there doing things.
[03:45:40.466 --> 03:45:42.967]  And then there were some other notables.
[03:45:42.967 --> 03:45:48.410]  Pittsburgh and San Antonio, We Are Change, did really good videos.
[03:45:48.410 --> 03:45:51.891]  They were, I felt, a little too drawn out in order to make the full impact.
[03:45:51.891 --> 03:45:52.631]  Multi-parts.
[03:45:52.631 --> 03:45:53.592]  Yeah, because, you know, if you...
[03:45:54.312 --> 03:46:05.719]  You gotta get the message across, and we put no guidelines in there, but you know, you gotta do it in four to five minutes, I think, to really make it to where people are really gonna watch it and, you know, get the message.
[03:46:05.719 --> 03:46:14.704]  This guy in New York did a lot of crazy stuff, and you know, he kind of lampooned it a little bit in terms of how he was acting.
[03:46:14.704 --> 03:46:17.266]  And by the way, they all deserve to win.
[03:46:17.266 --> 03:46:20.728]  We all win in the fight for liberty, getting people politically
[03:46:21.508 --> 03:46:22.128]  Uh, active.
[03:46:22.128 --> 03:46:30.793]  They all win by getting out, getting involved, showing people how to be grassroots, and how we can bring down the tyranny, if we have to, if they shut down the web and radio, just with posters.
[03:46:30.793 --> 03:46:31.333]  Yeah.
[03:46:31.333 --> 03:46:35.535]  I mean, folks, it's a devastating weapon against the New World Order and the Info War.
[03:46:35.535 --> 03:46:40.057]  And, uh, a little bit racy there on that last one, but it doesn't matter.
[03:46:40.057 --> 03:46:41.878]  He gets, he gets third place.
[03:46:41.878 --> 03:46:45.640]  So, San Francisco, the United States of Terror, first place.
[03:46:46.280 --> 03:46:56.743]  Freedom is free, 1776, L.A., second place, and two Johnny T. gets third place, and they all deserve... That's a very good joke.
[03:46:56.743 --> 03:47:05.025]  So that's $1,600 in prize money to contact us to win again, but luckily we have two of the people that won's contact info already, and we'll do that in a timely manner.
[03:47:05.025 --> 03:47:07.266]  Hopefully we're so busy, it's an insane asylum here of work.
[03:47:07.266 --> 03:47:10.527]  I'm not complaining, I'm saying just give us a break, folks.
[03:47:10.527 --> 03:47:15.188]  It's total war room, White House enemy list, black ops following me, total insanity.
[03:47:16.130 --> 03:47:18.880]  Uh, we're almost strangling each other routinely.
[03:47:18.880 --> 03:47:19.683]  I mean, it is like...
[03:47:21.624 --> 03:47:22.525]  I just can't believe this.
[03:47:22.525 --> 03:47:25.948]  I mean, I said I was going to be taking off, only working eight hours a day the next few weeks.
[03:47:25.948 --> 03:47:27.170]  It's not happening.
[03:47:27.170 --> 03:47:31.954]  I've got some ops going against the New World Order and the peaceful side of things.
[03:47:31.954 --> 03:47:36.018]  Folks just want to watch this channel, InfoWars, and the radio for the next few days.
[03:47:36.018 --> 03:47:37.940]  I'll just leave it there.
[03:47:37.940 --> 03:47:39.542]  But there are the winners there.
[03:47:39.542 --> 03:47:41.784]  We'll play these videos, at least parts of them.
[03:47:41.784 --> 03:47:44.987]  One of them is too racy to play, really, here on the show.
[03:47:45.948 --> 03:47:52.971]  The big new Charlie Sheen one, $13,500 for first place, $1,000 for second, $500 for third.
[03:47:52.971 --> 03:47:58.093]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is happening.
[03:47:58.093 --> 03:47:59.734]  Next week we'll have the rules up.
[03:47:59.734 --> 03:48:01.155]  I have it by Monday.
[03:48:01.155 --> 03:48:02.936]  I've got some other projects I've got to work on now.
[03:48:02.936 --> 03:48:06.137]  No rest for the... I didn't know I was this wicked at saying no rest for the wicked.
[03:48:06.137 --> 03:48:09.458]  How about rest for people who want freedom?
[03:48:09.458 --> 03:48:14.701]  You know, I like hot dogs, but this is like a hot dog eating contest where I've got to eat hundreds of hot dogs is the analogy.
[03:48:17.208 --> 03:48:20.110]  I don't know.
[03:48:20.110 --> 03:48:21.931]  I'm looking forward to seeing the entries from this one.
[03:48:21.931 --> 03:48:25.673]  We got one early on from a guy and he did it all silent.
[03:48:25.673 --> 03:48:27.794]  He kind of turned them into puppet caricatures.
[03:48:27.794 --> 03:48:30.196]  Send that to Charlie.
[03:48:30.196 --> 03:48:31.157]  Okay, well here's the deal.
[03:48:31.157 --> 03:48:32.577]  You've got a month and a week or so.
[03:48:32.577 --> 03:48:33.438]  I'm going to announce the date.
[03:48:33.438 --> 03:48:34.879]  It's roughly going to be a month.
[03:48:34.879 --> 03:48:35.899]  Launching next Monday.
[03:48:35.899 --> 03:48:36.360]  $13,500 prize.
[03:48:36.360 --> 03:48:38.041]  Charlie wants you to get $10,000 after taxes roughly.
[03:48:41.229 --> 03:48:43.831]  And there's no rules but what Charlie Sheen picks.
[03:48:43.831 --> 03:48:45.092]  Right.
[03:48:45.092 --> 03:48:49.756]  And you can condense down 20 minutes with the President, do the whole thing, do part of it, do it however you want.
[03:48:49.756 --> 03:48:55.081]  It can be two black guys, two white guys, two women, a man and a person from China, a woman, it doesn't matter.
[03:48:55.081 --> 03:48:59.785]  You can use sock puppets, you can do animated videos, whatever Charlie thinks is the best.
[03:48:59.785 --> 03:49:00.906]  And he says he's going to watch them all.
[03:49:01.286 --> 03:49:03.247]  Whatever Charlie thinks is the best is going to win.
[03:49:03.247 --> 03:49:05.208]  And with that, thank you Rob Due.
[03:49:05.208 --> 03:49:07.609]  And those winners are posted up on InfoWars.com.
[03:49:07.609 --> 03:49:08.769]  Thank you so much.
[03:49:08.769 --> 03:49:09.869]  Rob, arrested this week.
[03:49:09.869 --> 03:49:17.913]  We didn't even play the clip of the mayor there in Pennsylvania just saying, there's no free speech, you don't go out on the streets or we arrest you.
[03:49:17.913 --> 03:49:25.255]  I mean, this country, banks are taking us over here.
[03:49:25.255 --> 03:49:26.356]  I just keep catching my breath.
[03:49:29.522 --> 03:49:31.443]  I just wish the general public would wake up.
[03:49:31.443 --> 03:49:34.905]  I know we're waking up record numbers of people, but it isn't fast enough.
[03:49:34.905 --> 03:49:39.327]  We got a long way to go and a short time to get there, is the bottom line on this.
[03:49:39.327 --> 03:49:45.871]  And I know we've got more callers calling in with information.
[03:49:45.871 --> 03:49:49.973]  And I'd go into overdrive, but I've got stuff I got to do around here.
[03:49:49.973 --> 03:49:53.335]  Rebroadcast Jam Pack starts in about 10 minutes at InfoWars.com.
[03:49:53.335 --> 03:49:57.097]  I didn't even plug our sponsors today, which means I'll double down tomorrow.
[03:49:59.347 --> 03:50:03.132]  I'm just going to plug our sponsors even though these aren't their paid ads.
[03:50:03.132 --> 03:50:06.155]  Silverlungs.com is great.
[03:50:06.155 --> 03:50:08.878]  Survivalseedbank.com is great.
[03:50:08.878 --> 03:50:10.260]  Diginet.net is wonderful.
[03:50:11.684 --> 03:50:13.025]  Call of Blue is fantastic.
[03:50:13.025 --> 03:50:15.206]  AcolaBlue.com, they make it possible.
[03:50:15.206 --> 03:50:17.347]  MySolarBackup.com.
[03:50:17.347 --> 03:50:18.388]  MySolarBackup.com.
[03:50:18.388 --> 03:50:25.592]  Again, those are just some of the people that I didn't even plug today, and I haven't even really plugged, except once, that Fall of the Republic is available for pre-sale right now.
[03:50:25.592 --> 03:50:28.613]  If you want to get it first, the orders will be shipped out in the order they come in.
[03:50:28.613 --> 03:50:33.636]  It officially comes out October 21st at PrisonPlanet.tv, and your DVD will be in the mail a few days before that.
[03:50:34.076 --> 03:50:38.360]  If you get your orders in early, I can't promise if they come on after the date, it'll be backed up a few days by then.
[03:50:38.360 --> 03:50:40.843]  You always get a surge of orders right when it officially is released.
[03:50:40.843 --> 03:50:48.350]  If you want to get it first, get your orders in at InfoWars.com right now, or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:50:48.350 --> 03:50:49.791]  That's the coordinates.
[03:50:49.791 --> 03:50:50.351]  Get it.
[03:50:50.351 --> 03:50:53.454]  Make it go mega-viral while we still have some semblance of the First Amendment.
[03:50:53.454 --> 03:50:54.896]  888-253-3139.
[03:50:54.896 --> 03:50:58.079]  Or order it online at InfoWars.com.
[03:50:58.079 --> 03:50:58.719]  Get the DVD.
[03:50:58.719 --> 03:50:59.180]  Stay with us.
[03:51:02.423 --> 03:51:06.725]  Food security from eFoodsDirect, the most valuable protection your family can have.
[03:51:06.725 --> 03:51:08.226]  It's a scary world we live in.
[03:51:08.226 --> 03:51:12.608]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death, all from the swine flu.
[03:51:12.608 --> 03:51:16.290]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[03:51:16.290 --> 03:51:23.614]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper, due to the nation's 12 trillion dollar debt, which is why gold is now over a thousand dollars an ounce.
[03:51:24.074 --> 03:51:33.199]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16%, and the solution for every one of these threats to your family is food security from eFoods Direct.
[03:51:33.199 --> 03:51:34.800]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or visit efoodsdirect.com.
[03:51:34.800 --> 03:51:36.481]  Food security for your family
[03:51:43.755 --> 03:51:44.435]  We're good to go.
[03:52:01.855 --> 03:52:07.678]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:07.678 --> 03:52:15.261]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:52:15.261 --> 03:52:21.404]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.824 --> 03:52:23.804]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.804 --> 03:52:26.305]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:26.305 --> 03:52:37.888]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:37.888 --> 03:52:39.568]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.568 --> 03:52:41.429]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.429 --> 03:52:47.650]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.317 --> 03:52:56.590]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:56.590 --> 03:52:58.173]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.173 --> 03:52:59.354]  The people strike back!
[03:53:01.221 --> 03:53:07.923]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[03:53:07.923 --> 03:53:09.604]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[03:53:09.604 --> 03:53:14.185]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[03:53:14.185 --> 03:53:21.847]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[03:53:21.847 --> 03:53:24.308]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[03:53:24.488 --> 03:53:25.109]  I don't know.
[03:53:50.108 --> 03:54:00.315]  Alright, note to John Harmon who we've lost contact with in Minnesota.
[03:54:00.315 --> 03:54:10.381]  We're going to go out with Highway to the Danger Zone.
[03:54:10.381 --> 03:54:15.064]  For all the folks in Montana covering this, who knows who else will be popping into Montana.
[03:54:25.382 --> 03:54:29.743]  Oh yeah, we got a red-hot FEMA camp manned by foreign mercs.
[03:54:29.743 --> 03:54:31.064]  And we are on the job.
[03:54:31.064 --> 03:54:34.165]  Hey, Harmon, you hear me?
[03:54:34.165 --> 03:54:36.065]  Yeah, we completely lost Minnesota.
[03:54:36.065 --> 03:54:39.206]  Hope we're even connected up with those boys.
[03:54:39.206 --> 03:54:40.907]  Lord knows what's going on down there.
[03:54:40.907 --> 03:54:42.727]  Harmon, IM me if you've got us.
[03:54:42.727 --> 03:54:44.388]  Up there in Minnesota, I'm in Texas.
[03:54:44.388 --> 03:54:47.729]  We're listeners out there confused by it.
[03:54:47.729 --> 03:54:49.489]  That's strange.
[03:54:49.489 --> 03:54:49.990]  Oh, he's there.
[03:54:49.990 --> 03:54:51.150]  Okay, I'm gonna take us out then.
[03:54:51.150 --> 03:54:52.811]  We've lost our connection to you.
[03:54:52.811 --> 03:54:54.231]  But you've got our connection to you, right?
[03:54:59.500 --> 03:55:01.341]  I don't know what that means.
[03:55:01.341 --> 03:55:03.162]  Yes?
[03:55:03.162 --> 03:55:03.703]  Yeah, I'm here.
[03:55:03.703 --> 03:55:05.063]  We just lost the backup.
[03:55:05.063 --> 03:55:06.084]  Okay, we lost the backup.
[03:55:06.084 --> 03:55:07.065]  Okay, that's fine.
[03:55:07.065 --> 03:55:11.988]  Look, I meant to get to Jeremy, Dave, Ken, Paul, and everybody else.
[03:55:11.988 --> 03:55:13.589]  We went to Paul.
[03:55:13.589 --> 03:55:17.131]  Tomorrow live 11 to 3 Central.
[03:55:17.131 --> 03:55:18.331]  Tell everybody to tune in.
[03:55:18.331 --> 03:55:20.533]  Obviously, things are getting more and more insane.
[03:55:22.267 --> 03:55:24.168]  We are now on the White House enemies list.
[03:55:24.168 --> 03:55:27.109]  It's been reported they have an enemies list in mainstream media.
[03:55:27.109 --> 03:55:31.971]  Now one of the biggest tabloids out there, but it's not the really corny space alien ones, it's the globe.
[03:55:31.971 --> 03:55:36.353]  Obama's secret enemies list, and I guess that kind of whitewashes it, but I'm on the list.
[03:55:36.353 --> 03:55:39.074]  So we're getting reports coming up at PrisonPlanet.com on that.
[03:55:39.074 --> 03:55:43.236]  We've got all the articles posted, the videos being posted inside the FEMA camp.
[03:55:44.682 --> 03:55:51.326]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com in Paul Watson's article, Montana town occupied by private paramilitary force.
[03:55:51.326 --> 03:55:58.370]  Steve Quayle says they're telling locals that as they take over, they're going to have to come in and register their guns with the private group.
[03:55:58.370 --> 03:56:01.031]  According to Steve, I don't doubt him.
[03:56:01.031 --> 03:56:02.872]  I doubted him 10, 12, 13 years ago.
[03:56:02.872 --> 03:56:05.173]  I mean, I didn't think he was lying, but I had doubted some of it.
[03:56:05.173 --> 03:56:09.295]  And now it's just more and more Steve Quayle.
[03:56:09.295 --> 03:56:10.076]  I wish he wasn't right.
[03:56:12.492 --> 03:56:14.173]  I'm going to contact Coast to Coast AM.
[03:56:14.173 --> 03:56:18.295]  I would imagine they'll want to report from me or Steve on tonight.
[03:56:18.295 --> 03:56:19.976]  This is just becoming totally insane.
[03:56:19.976 --> 03:56:21.176]  FEMA camp confirmed.
[03:56:21.176 --> 03:56:22.397]  We played you the newscast.
[03:56:22.397 --> 03:56:28.500]  In fact, guys, make sure Watson posts that newscast from YouTube months ago in April when they were wanting to make it a FEMA camp.
[03:56:28.500 --> 03:56:31.061]  And now Thar and Merck show up and take it over.
[03:56:31.061 --> 03:56:32.102]  I want to commend the crew.
[03:56:32.102 --> 03:56:34.463]  This place is a war room, literally.
[03:56:35.800 --> 03:56:38.382]  Uh, one of, uh, Rob Dues' best friends.
[03:56:38.382 --> 03:56:40.144]  I wonder why he was so bummed out when he got back.
[03:56:40.144 --> 03:56:44.947]  It wasn't just bummed out that he got arrested by the military and saw Luke tortured.
[03:56:44.947 --> 03:56:46.328]  But one of his best friends died.
[03:56:46.328 --> 03:56:47.709]  He was gonna bury her.
[03:56:47.709 --> 03:56:48.250]  Of cancer.
[03:56:48.250 --> 03:56:49.531]  Young woman.
[03:56:49.531 --> 03:56:50.692]  Dying of cancer.
[03:56:50.692 --> 03:56:51.953]  Happens to everybody now, I guess.
[03:56:51.953 --> 03:56:53.394]  It's part of the new freedom.
[03:56:53.394 --> 03:56:54.315]  Sorry, buddy.
[03:56:54.315 --> 03:56:55.876]  Appreciate you working so hard.
[03:56:55.876 --> 03:56:57.477]  He didn't even tell me why he's been bummed out.
[03:56:57.477 --> 03:57:01.300]  What, she died this weekend?
[03:57:01.300 --> 03:57:03.922]  Oh, so you got the news while you were at the G20.
[03:57:03.922 --> 03:57:04.543]  Sorry to hear that.
[03:57:05.666 --> 03:57:08.011]  Morning got arrested.
[03:57:08.011 --> 03:57:10.236]  Okay, take me out with Highway to the Danger Zone.
[03:57:11.516 --> 03:57:13.798]  This is for everybody out there standing up to the tyranny.
[03:57:13.798 --> 03:57:15.939]  You know you love this corny 80s rock.
[03:57:15.939 --> 03:57:18.862]  Have a little bit of fun as we go out to break here.
[03:57:18.862 --> 03:57:30.610]  And I just want to commend Jaron Neihardt, Paul Hartman, Aaron Dykes, Rob Jacobson, Jason Douglas, Jason Burmas, all the crew, everybody here that makes this radio show possible.
[03:57:30.610 --> 03:57:33.553]  The entire InfoWars team.
[03:57:33.553 --> 03:57:34.814]  Spread the word about the show.
[03:57:34.814 --> 03:57:36.235]  We are the tip of the spear.
[03:57:36.235 --> 03:57:37.576]  We're having an effect.
[03:57:37.576 --> 03:57:39.177]  We're taking on the New World Order.
[03:57:39.477 --> 03:57:41.439]  We know that they're not invincible.
[03:57:41.439 --> 03:57:43.641]  That's why we're in the White House enemies list.
[03:57:43.641 --> 03:57:45.603]  Pray for us, most importantly.
[03:57:45.603 --> 03:57:48.045]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, I'm getting in that F-14.
[03:57:48.045 --> 03:57:52.169]  We're gonna go expose the New World Order.
[03:57:52.169 --> 03:57:53.811]  You just better get ready.
[03:57:53.811 --> 03:57:57.094]  Right here, on the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[03:57:57.094 --> 03:57:59.577]  Crank it up and take us out!
[03:57:59.577 --> 03:58:00.357]  Out there on the air!
[03:58:10.002 --> 03:58:18.827]  The Republic's worth it!
[03:58:18.827 --> 03:58:33.616]  Not a lot, but you're on the edge.
[03:58:51.119 --> 03:58:54.502]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.502 --> 03:58:58.145]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.145 --> 03:59:02.708]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.708 --> 03:59:08.313]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:08.593 --> 03:59:13.356]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.356 --> 03:59:16.978]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:16.978 --> 03:59:21.800]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:21.800 --> 03:59:28.364]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.364 --> 03:59:30.305]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:30.805 --> 03:59:31.905]  Direct to you, and in your face!
[03:59:31.905 --> 03:59:34.427]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
