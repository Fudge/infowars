[00:00.000 --> 00:09.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.720 --> 00:10.720]  You want answers?
[00:10.720 --> 00:12.920]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.920 --> 00:26.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:26.320 --> 00:32.960]  Another very important broadcast lined up for the listeners today.
[00:32.960 --> 00:40.760]  Charlie Sheen popping in for an update on our attempt to put 9-11 investigation on the
[00:40.760 --> 00:41.760]  front burner.
[00:41.760 --> 00:45.480]  We'll be joining us in T-minus 30 minutes.
[00:45.480 --> 00:51.320]  Two hours from now, Steve Quayle will be joining us with the latest updates on the flu, forced
[00:51.320 --> 00:55.320]  inoculations, and of course, martial law.
[00:55.320 --> 00:59.600]  There are towns across the country, not just with regular army marines and national guard
[00:59.600 --> 01:05.840]  being deployed on the streets in the name of police shortages, even though they've tripled
[01:05.840 --> 01:09.560]  the number of the police in the last 12 years or so.
[01:09.560 --> 01:15.800]  But now they have private mercenary police unannounced to city councils just arriving,
[01:15.800 --> 01:21.400]  calling themselves National Police, quote, guarding local detention centers.
[01:21.400 --> 01:25.960]  So the private mercs are now being deployed around the country.
[01:25.960 --> 01:26.960]  This is confirmed.
[01:26.960 --> 01:31.600]  Steve Quayle called me frantically, and I missed his call last Friday.
[01:31.600 --> 01:38.680]  Then I got an alert from him Sunday about different towns having paramilitary private
[01:38.680 --> 01:40.160]  mercs deployed in them.
[01:40.160 --> 01:44.000]  And then this morning, Paul Watson had a big article on it, a bunch of mainstream media
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.120]  reported on it yesterday, but as if it's a wonderful good thing.
[01:49.120 --> 01:54.360]  And locals going, we don't know who this private national police force is, but they guard the
[01:54.360 --> 01:56.360]  local camp that was built.
[01:56.360 --> 01:58.040]  No one's in it.
[01:58.040 --> 02:02.280]  We don't know why the camp was built, but now they say they're the police in our town
[02:02.280 --> 02:05.600]  too, and they're going to tell us what to do.
[02:05.600 --> 02:07.880]  You can't make this type of stuff up.
[02:07.880 --> 02:10.000]  It's just too off the charts, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.580]  I mean, I'm laughing because as if it isn't bad enough, they take blood at checkpoints
[02:14.580 --> 02:19.440]  without warrants in Texas now and many other areas of the country as if it isn't bad enough
[02:19.440 --> 02:24.680]  that I have a news clip with the police chief of Pittsburgh and the police chief of Oakland
[02:24.680 --> 02:27.800]  in Pennsylvania, both saying, look, you're not allowed to be on the streets.
[02:27.800 --> 02:29.960]  If you do, we attack you.
[02:29.960 --> 02:36.000]  There's no more protesting, no more meeting at parks, martial law.
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.760]  And then they beat you in the habitability clubs and hit you with sound cannons and
[02:39.760 --> 02:42.040]  tear gas canisters and rubber bullets if you don't.
[02:42.040 --> 02:49.200]  I mean, it's just amazing to see tyranny coming down on the American people with both feet,
[02:49.200 --> 02:53.840]  with the backdrop of endless terror alerts about the bust in Dallas and the bust in Illinois
[02:53.840 --> 02:59.440]  and the FBI went out and created groups and found loners out of prison and told them they'd
[02:59.440 --> 03:05.980]  pay them money if they just help them build a bomb, just out provocaturing and entrapping
[03:05.980 --> 03:10.240]  so they can then get up and hype on the news and say that Iran's behind it and lie about
[03:10.240 --> 03:16.400]  Iran and say they had a secret facility when Iran's openly building centrifuge uranium
[03:16.400 --> 03:18.400]  enrichment centers for peaceful uses.
[03:18.400 --> 03:22.720]  The type of centrifuges they have can't build, can't produce fissile material, 95% what they
[03:22.720 --> 03:24.800]  need for bombs.
[03:24.800 --> 03:28.000]  They make the announcement last week, hey, here's one of our new facilities and they
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.600]  announced they had to admit their secret facility.
[03:30.600 --> 03:31.600]  We've caught them.
[03:31.600 --> 03:37.320]  Oh my gosh, we need to attack immediately with nuclear weapons.
[03:37.320 --> 03:38.400]  Oh boy.
[03:38.400 --> 03:41.600]  And they're announcing the end of the dollar, they're announcing world government.
[03:41.600 --> 03:46.800]  They're just running all over us like never before seen, saying they need 500,000 troops
[03:46.800 --> 03:48.160]  for Afghanistan.
[03:48.160 --> 03:50.720]  The left says, yay, that's peace.
[03:50.720 --> 03:56.760]  Obama's increasing troops, increasing contractors in Iraq, increasing troops in Afghanistan.
[03:56.760 --> 03:58.440]  It's liberal.
[03:58.440 --> 04:01.360]  The announces this week, yes, we will have permanent detention.
[04:01.360 --> 04:05.840]  We're expanding it and going to build famous centers in America and we're not closing Guantanamo.
[04:05.840 --> 04:07.480]  Yay.
[04:07.480 --> 04:12.160]  I'm hiring nothing but lobbyist and everything I do is secret, yay.
[04:12.160 --> 04:16.720]  I'm expanding the Patriot Act that Bush got into place, yeah, liberal.
[04:16.720 --> 04:21.680]  And if you don't like it, you're a right wing racist.
[04:21.680 --> 04:25.560]  If you're not for torturing people, brown people in secret camps, you're racist.
[04:25.560 --> 04:30.760]  If you're not for expanding the abortion funding and infanticide funding in China and
[04:30.760 --> 04:35.960]  Africa, you're a racist, he's liberal, he's black.
[04:35.960 --> 04:40.920]  And all over the country, videos are coming in from North Carolina and Texas and New Jersey
[04:40.920 --> 04:47.320]  and California of kids worshiping Obama, much worse than the video we broke a month ago.
[04:47.320 --> 04:50.000]  I mean, it is downright absolute godlike worship.
[04:50.000 --> 04:56.160]  I mean, this is just, it's the worst tyranny I've ever seen, the most bizarre.
[04:56.160 --> 04:57.160]  It's almost satirical.
[04:57.160 --> 05:00.080]  We'll be right back.
[05:00.080 --> 05:04.160]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate
[05:04.160 --> 05:07.760]  and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[05:07.760 --> 05:13.880]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for 10 bucks.
[05:13.880 --> 05:16.880]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[05:16.880 --> 05:21.800]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh
[05:21.800 --> 05:23.120]  economic times.
[05:23.120 --> 05:26.240]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class.
[05:26.240 --> 05:27.240]  It doesn't matter.
[05:27.240 --> 05:31.320]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and will tell you how to
[05:31.320 --> 05:32.760]  protect your wealth as well.
[05:32.760 --> 05:34.880]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[05:34.880 --> 05:36.600]  You need to look out for yourself.
[05:36.600 --> 05:39.120]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[05:39.120 --> 05:42.960]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your
[05:42.960 --> 05:43.960]  loved ones.
[05:43.960 --> 05:47.440]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[05:47.440 --> 05:50.760]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[05:50.760 --> 05:52.600]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[05:52.600 --> 05:53.600]  One last time.
[05:53.600 --> 05:54.600]  It's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[05:54.600 --> 06:06.560]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground Sierra
[06:06.560 --> 06:10.120]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[06:10.120 --> 06:15.400]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[06:15.400 --> 06:16.960]  to tell their story.
[06:16.960 --> 06:25.960]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[06:25.960 --> 06:30.720]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world
[06:30.720 --> 06:33.000]  take action against their global masters.
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.160]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[06:36.160 --> 06:41.960]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[06:41.960 --> 06:48.880]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide, download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and
[06:48.880 --> 06:54.000]  aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.680]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[06:57.680 --> 07:00.480]  and bring in martial law.
[07:00.480 --> 07:05.200]  Are you constantly tired, have a hard time concentrating, experience muscle weakness
[07:05.200 --> 07:07.200]  or have problems with digestion?
[07:07.200 --> 07:10.240]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[07:10.240 --> 07:15.880]  Liquid zeolite available only at RestoreYourHelpNow.com captures toxins and physically carries them
[07:15.880 --> 07:16.960]  out of your body.
[07:16.960 --> 07:21.800]  This safe and effective way of detoxifying can easily remove heavy metals and contaminants.
[07:21.800 --> 07:25.920]  Studies show that liquid zeolite captures triggering antigens which cause allergies,
[07:25.920 --> 07:30.360]  migraines, and asthma decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.
[07:30.360 --> 07:35.240]  Liquid zeolite is a tasteless and odorless liquid that when taken daily supports a healthy,
[07:35.240 --> 07:38.680]  happy, and active lifestyle in an increasingly toxic world.
[07:38.680 --> 07:41.840]  The liquid zeolite is so gentle that you won't even know you're taking it.

[08:00.520 --> 08:06.440]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's
[08:06.440 --> 08:11.440]  a war on for your mind.
[08:11.440 --> 08:20.920]  All right, Charlie Sheen's popping in later in the hour.
[08:20.920 --> 08:25.000]  We have Steve Quayle breaking news on multi fronts.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.200]  He first told me about this last Friday.
[08:28.200 --> 08:34.680]  I was so busy finishing Fall of Republic and getting it delivered for mass production and
[08:34.680 --> 08:38.240]  on other issues, I kind of let it fall to the cracks and then was reminded of it when
[08:38.240 --> 08:45.040]  it finally hit mainstream news yesterday and we did a boil down article at PrisonPlanet.com.
[08:45.040 --> 08:52.000]  Paul Watson, Montana Town, occupied by private paramilitary security force announcing they're
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.880]  the police and it doesn't matter what the mayor or anybody says.
[08:55.880 --> 09:02.440]  A detention center was built in the town with federal money.
[09:02.440 --> 09:05.840]  This is all on the local news and then no one really knew what it was for.
[09:05.840 --> 09:11.080]  They said, oh, it'll be for federal prisoners and then now something called American police
[09:11.080 --> 09:20.080]  force has arrived with this bizarre Illuminati double eagle symbol and they're just announcing
[09:20.080 --> 09:27.080]  that we are your police and they've put decals on the sides of their cars saying that they
[09:27.080 --> 09:31.040]  are the local police force with the name of the town on it and this is happening in
[09:31.040 --> 09:33.160]  other areas of the country.
[09:33.160 --> 09:37.560]  They've used black water in North Carolina, they're using black water in California to
[09:37.560 --> 09:44.800]  raid marijuana dispensaries, even places that are supposedly legal that was in the LA Times.
[09:44.800 --> 09:48.000]  This is red dawn in slow motion.
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.080]  They're just conquering America without blowing their trumpet and announcing it.
[09:52.080 --> 09:56.240]  This is a covert operation and it's been going on for a long time.
[09:56.240 --> 10:01.480]  In a town occupied by private paramilitary security force, organization's goal is to
[10:01.480 --> 10:07.640]  quote help US government combat terrorism, patrols the streets of Hardin.
[10:07.640 --> 10:12.160]  A private security force whose biggest role is helping US government to combat terrorism
[10:12.160 --> 10:15.920]  that's on their own site is now patrolling the streets of a town in Montana acting as
[10:15.920 --> 10:19.920]  law enforcement but accountable to nobody and operating completely outside the limitations
[10:19.920 --> 10:24.640]  of the US Constitution and a chilling throwback to the brown shirts.
[10:24.640 --> 10:28.680]  The American police force organization is a paramilitary unit that provides surveillance,
[10:28.680 --> 10:33.080]  investigative and military services across the world according to its website which shows
[10:33.080 --> 10:36.120]  men dressed in military fatigue carrying machine guns.
[10:36.120 --> 10:40.800]  As part of our mission, APF plays a critical role in helping the US government meet vital
[10:40.800 --> 10:46.720]  homeland security and national security defense needs and because they're testing the public,
[10:46.720 --> 10:51.640]  a public will probably bow down to them and start mowing their yards or trimming their
[10:51.640 --> 10:57.320]  toenails for them, I mean that's how tyranny works, it's just, it's happening.
[10:57.320 --> 11:00.040]  Within the last five years, the United States has been far and away.
[11:00.040 --> 11:04.120]  Our number one client, technologies, programs and services performed by APF have played
[11:04.120 --> 11:08.360]  a very important role in US military and civilian efforts to protect our homeland and combat
[11:08.360 --> 11:11.280]  terrorism, their website, states.
[11:11.280 --> 11:16.440]  APF or American police force were originally contracted to provide security at a previously
[11:16.440 --> 11:18.480]  empty jail in Hardin.
[11:18.480 --> 11:23.920]  If you look at it, it's a little FEMA center, bar bar system they built, a small town of
[11:23.920 --> 11:24.920]  Montana.
[11:24.920 --> 11:26.280]  In fact, Watson calls that a jail.
[11:26.280 --> 11:34.640]  If you watch the newscast, it's a detention center, it's what they call on the local news.
[11:34.640 --> 11:39.680]  But are now patrolling the streets driving SUVs with police department printed on them
[11:39.680 --> 11:43.240]  despite the fact that Hardin doesn't have a police department.
[11:43.240 --> 11:46.320]  American police force has no jurisdiction in the area because it is a private organization
[11:46.320 --> 11:47.320]  on a police force.
[11:47.320 --> 11:52.920]  According to two rivers, authority officials having the private security force patrol the
[11:52.920 --> 11:55.520]  streets was not part of their contract.
[11:55.520 --> 11:58.760]  And then they have the local mayor on TV.
[11:58.760 --> 12:00.120]  I have no idea.
[12:00.120 --> 12:04.000]  I really don't because that's not been part of any of the discussions we've had with
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  any of them.
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.800]  Two rivers authority, Al Peterson told K U L R eight news and again, you can watch that
[12:10.800 --> 12:11.800]  newscast.
[12:11.800 --> 12:18.360]  A post in the article, Montana town occupied by private paramilitary security firm, Peterson
[12:18.360 --> 12:23.000]  said that patrolling the streets was on a wish list of APF's.
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.360]  What Captain Michael.
[12:25.360 --> 12:29.720]  So see, they just show up and announce we're here to patrol and they have Hardin police
[12:29.720 --> 12:31.920]  on the side of their black SUVs.
[12:31.920 --> 12:37.600]  I mean, they're doing this everywhere, mainly black water.
[12:37.600 --> 12:38.600]  This is bizarre.
[12:38.600 --> 12:41.880]  They've got this weird Illuminati double Eagle symbol they use.
[12:41.880 --> 12:46.600]  I mean, unless they're Serbian, the only other use for it is a classic Illuminati Neural
[12:46.600 --> 12:47.600]  Order symbol.
[12:47.600 --> 12:50.720]  The American police force is a shady outfit shrouded in suspicion.
[12:50.720 --> 12:56.560]  According to a Associated Press report, questions over the legitimacy of the organization abound.
[12:56.560 --> 13:00.600]  Government contract databases show no record of the country of the company.
[13:00.600 --> 13:04.600]  Security industry representatives and federal officials said they had never heard of it.
[13:04.600 --> 13:08.240]  On its website, the company lists its headquarters as a building in Washington or the White
[13:08.240 --> 13:10.680]  House that holds virtual offices.
[13:10.680 --> 13:15.560]  A spokesman for the building said American police force never completed its application
[13:15.560 --> 13:17.360]  to use the address.
[13:17.360 --> 13:20.240]  Sounds like a classic CIA cut out to me.
[13:20.240 --> 13:25.880]  Furthermore, APF was tasked with filling the empty Hardin jail with inmates without any
[13:25.880 --> 13:28.840]  clear indication of where those prisoners would come from.
[13:28.840 --> 13:32.840]  And you watch the newscast, we keep calling it a jail.
[13:32.840 --> 13:38.760]  They call it in the newscast, there's several of them, the detention center that was built
[13:38.760 --> 13:43.160]  and then they just arrived and no one knew what was going to go in the detention facility.
[13:43.160 --> 13:46.720]  It's unclear where the company will get the inmates for the jail.
[13:46.720 --> 13:50.360]  Montana says it isn't sending inmates to the jail and neither are federal officials in
[13:50.360 --> 13:52.280]  the state, according to the report.
[13:52.280 --> 13:55.680]  Maybe the inmates will be local population of Hardin if American police force is allowed
[13:55.680 --> 14:00.600]  to continue to pose as law enforcement outfit in the town, which is exactly what they intend
[14:00.600 --> 14:04.160]  to do at least for another month.
[14:04.160 --> 14:08.160]  And people commenting in the comment section of Prison Planet rightfully point out this
[14:08.160 --> 14:12.860]  is as banana republic as it gets.
[14:12.860 --> 14:15.440]  This is as hardcore third world as it gets.
[14:15.440 --> 14:19.200]  This is just like Iraq or Afghanistan totally occupied by private mercs.
[14:19.200 --> 14:23.520]  And this is not the only case that's happening all over the country.
[14:23.520 --> 14:27.240]  Having a private security force who stated mission is to help US government combat terrorism
[14:27.240 --> 14:31.160]  patrol the streets of small towns in America without even having the authority to do so
[14:31.160 --> 14:36.480]  from local authorities is obviously a frightening pretext and harkens back to private paramilitary
[14:36.480 --> 14:39.960]  forces that helped Adolf Hitler rise to power in Nazi Germany.
[14:39.960 --> 14:44.400]  Many fear that if martial law is declared in response to a flu pandemic or other emergency,
[14:44.400 --> 14:48.880]  private security forces such as APF will be used by government to oppress citizens by
[14:48.880 --> 14:50.720]  operating outside the law.
[14:50.720 --> 14:54.600]  This is completely unconstitutional and a flagrant threat to the liberty and security
[14:54.600 --> 14:56.720]  of the population of Hardin.
[14:56.720 --> 15:01.120]  The county sheriff is effectively breaking the law if he doesn't immediately kick APF
[15:01.120 --> 15:07.960]  out of the area and in the occupation of the town by private paramilitary army.
[15:07.960 --> 15:13.880]  And we're going to go ahead and play this little local newscast and then we have a blind
[15:13.880 --> 15:15.080]  spot.
[15:15.080 --> 15:23.160]  I tend to report things before their mainstream news from government documents.
[15:23.160 --> 15:29.000]  And then once it becomes a big issue, we don't go back over enough.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.880]  I mean, I mention almost every day, watch out for the Gardasil shot.
[15:31.880 --> 15:34.840]  It's killed a lot of people and we put up links to mainstream news.
[15:34.840 --> 15:41.080]  But I did about an hour of research last night and my head was spinning literally hundreds
[15:41.080 --> 15:48.520]  of newscasts on YouTube alone under the term Gardasil deaths, Gardasil illnesses, Gardasil
[15:48.520 --> 15:49.520]  adverse reactions, hundreds.
[15:49.520 --> 15:51.040]  I mean, I couldn't watch them all.
[15:51.040 --> 15:53.440]  I ended up watching, I don't know, 20, 30, 40.
[15:53.440 --> 15:54.440]  I don't know.
[15:54.440 --> 15:57.960]  My wife said at about one o'clock, why don't you come to bed, you need to get your sleep.
[15:57.960 --> 16:03.920]  You're supposedly not going to be working as much for the next few months.
[16:03.920 --> 16:07.400]  I mean, my head is spinning right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[16:07.400 --> 16:13.320]  My head is absolutely, completely spinning because it was worse than I thought.
[16:13.320 --> 16:18.080]  There are deaths all over Scotland, all over England, all over Europe, all over the United
[16:18.080 --> 16:19.720]  States.
[16:19.720 --> 16:25.080]  There are giant women's groups and mainline groups fighting it, PTAs fighting it, mayors
[16:25.080 --> 16:29.440]  fighting it, and Merck is in a lot of trouble, but they don't care.
[16:29.440 --> 16:31.120]  They put out Vioxx and everything else.
[16:31.120 --> 16:32.120]  This is part of their strategy.
[16:32.120 --> 16:34.440]  They've already been given government liability protection.
[16:34.440 --> 16:39.400]  But here's the headline, school girl 14 dies and three classmates taken ill after being
[16:39.400 --> 16:43.260]  given new cervical cancer vaccine at one school.
[16:43.260 --> 16:46.520]  Another article, as you know, last week, they're threatening to take people's children if they
[16:46.520 --> 16:50.520]  complain, if their child dies or gets sick, they threaten to take the other kids if they
[16:50.520 --> 16:54.200]  don't shut up and sign forms agreeing to it.
[16:54.200 --> 16:56.920]  Even when they start dying from the second shot, they'll say, look, we're going to take
[16:56.920 --> 16:58.480]  your kids, take the third.
[16:58.480 --> 16:59.480]  There's not even a law.
[16:59.480 --> 17:03.280]  They just come with weapons in England.
[17:03.280 --> 17:09.360]  In the fourth hour today, I'm going to mainly just play testimonies of women and young
[17:09.360 --> 17:15.680]  girls who've had the shot and they show videos of them, cheerleaders, you know, marathons,
[17:15.680 --> 17:16.680]  you name it.
[17:16.680 --> 17:21.400]  Now they can't walk their paralyzed rules, dripping out of their mouths, photos, video
[17:21.400 --> 17:23.240]  of the hellish blood pouring out of them.
[17:23.240 --> 17:24.240]  I don't know.
[17:24.240 --> 17:27.680]  We're going to play that, but we're definitely going to link up to it.
[17:27.680 --> 17:34.360]  I mean, how do I sit here and calmly go over all of this and then be laughed at by the
[17:34.360 --> 17:36.720]  mainstream media while all of this is happening?
[17:36.720 --> 17:40.520]  So we're really going to spend an hour on this today because at least we can do something
[17:40.520 --> 17:41.760]  about this.
[17:41.760 --> 17:42.920]  We can't save the world.
[17:42.920 --> 17:44.800]  We don't have all the answers.
[17:44.800 --> 17:48.520]  There's too many issues to cover, but at least we can stop drinking Florida water and keep
[17:48.520 --> 17:49.520]  our girls.
[17:49.520 --> 17:53.680]  And now they want to force our boys to take this Gardasil live cancer virus.
[17:53.680 --> 17:57.800]  Let's go ahead and go to this video out of Hardin where they've got the troops patrolling
[17:57.800 --> 17:58.800]  around the private mercs.
[17:58.800 --> 18:00.840]  We'll go to break and come back and cover other news.
[18:00.840 --> 18:01.840]  Stay with us.
[18:01.840 --> 18:06.840]  Well, members of the American police force showed up in Hardin yesterday, driving vehicles
[18:06.840 --> 18:09.160]  with Hardin police written on them.
[18:09.160 --> 18:13.480]  As colorates, Nick Law reports, it created quite a stir, especially because Hardin doesn't
[18:13.480 --> 18:16.440]  have a city police department.
[18:16.440 --> 18:19.000]  This was the talk of the town in Hardin on Thursday.
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.200]  Mercedes decked out in the city of Hardin police department decals and driven by American
[18:24.200 --> 18:25.800]  police force members.
[18:25.800 --> 18:30.240]  Two rivers authority officials say having APF patrol the streets was never part of their
[18:30.240 --> 18:31.240]  agenda.
[18:31.240 --> 18:34.600]  You know, I have no idea that I really don't because that's not anything that's been in
[18:34.600 --> 18:37.260]  the discussions that I've had with any of them.
[18:37.260 --> 18:41.720]  As it stands now, the Bighorn County Sheriff's Department is contracted to patrol the city
[18:41.720 --> 18:44.260]  and APF has no jurisdiction.
[18:44.260 --> 18:48.520]  If that was changed, Peterson claims it would have to go through the city council.
[18:48.520 --> 18:53.200]  As for the jail contract with APF, both sides are yet to agree on a deal as bondholders
[18:53.200 --> 18:55.440]  rejected it again on Thursday morning.
[18:55.440 --> 18:57.600]  No, it's a complicated issue.
[18:57.600 --> 19:02.360]  There's a lot of tax laws that they're working through and we're just hoping now.
[19:02.360 --> 19:04.520]  We thought we were going to get it by Tuesday night.
[19:04.520 --> 19:06.280]  We're hoping now we can get it by Friday night.
[19:06.280 --> 19:10.480]  And two rivers authority officials say the contract only deals with the detention facility
[19:10.480 --> 19:12.160]  and the training center.
[19:12.160 --> 19:16.160]  There's no mention of a homeless shelter, animal shelter, or any other services for
[19:16.160 --> 19:17.160]  the area.
[19:17.160 --> 19:20.320]  Well, you know, that was never in the contract to begin with.
[19:20.320 --> 19:25.960]  I think it was just kind of on a wish list of what Captain Michael wanted to do here.
[19:25.960 --> 19:30.880]  American police force officials plan on staying in the Hardin area for the next month.
[19:30.880 --> 19:32.520]  And that was Color 8's Nick Law reporting.
[19:32.520 --> 19:36.760]  The exact details of the contract talks between two rivers authority and American police force
[19:36.760 --> 19:39.440]  remain under wraps.
[19:39.440 --> 19:45.120]  Under wraps is it's covert, can't let the terrorists, the American people know.
[19:45.120 --> 19:52.000]  By the way, major newspaper, The Globe is reporting that I am officially on the White
[19:52.000 --> 19:53.560]  House Enemies list.
[19:53.560 --> 19:57.160]  That's been in the news, been in the AP, they have an enemies list.
[19:57.160 --> 20:01.440]  I'm near the top of the list.
[20:01.440 --> 20:04.720]  Attention all U.S. homeowners stuck in high interest rate mortgages.
[20:04.720 --> 20:08.800]  Are you finding it harder and harder to keep up with your monthly mortgage payments?
[20:08.800 --> 20:13.200]  Homeowners with all types of credit can now apply for FHA government insured 30-year fixed
[20:13.200 --> 20:17.520]  rates as low as 4.875% from top-dot mortgage.
[20:17.520 --> 20:22.400]  With an FHA loan from top-dot, you can consolidate debt, lower your mortgage payments, or get
[20:22.400 --> 20:24.000]  cash for any reason.
[20:24.000 --> 20:28.640]  I repeat, you can now refinance your current high interest rate mortgage to a 30-year fixed
[20:28.640 --> 20:31.600]  rate as low as 4.875%.
[20:31.600 --> 20:34.280]  You could save hundreds of dollars every month.
[20:34.280 --> 20:39.560]  Others may call now to learn their fixed rate for free, 800-511-4300.
[20:39.560 --> 20:42.320]  You will hear your rate for free in just minutes.
[20:42.320 --> 20:46.040]  These rates are only available for a limited time, so act now.
[20:46.040 --> 20:56.840]  To find out your rate for free, call now, 800-511-4300, 800-511-4300, 800-511-4300.
[20:56.840 --> 21:00.640]  Top-dot is a licensed mortgage banker, rates based on an APR of 5.20%.
[21:00.640 --> 21:04.920]  In the average, Americans work between 45-50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to
[21:04.920 --> 21:07.320]  retire and live out their golden years.
[21:07.320 --> 21:12.400]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many
[21:12.400 --> 21:15.440]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[21:15.440 --> 21:19.720]  Is this a flaw for enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[21:19.720 --> 21:23.640]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[21:23.640 --> 21:27.400]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[21:27.400 --> 21:28.640]  from Jekyll Island.
[21:28.640 --> 21:32.800]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[21:32.800 --> 21:37.800]  power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[21:37.800 --> 21:39.200]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[21:39.200 --> 21:43.920]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[21:48.760 --> 21:51.840]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[21:56.640 --> 22:07.760]  It's here after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, my new film Terror Storm
[22:07.760 --> 22:08.760]  is complete.
[22:08.760 --> 22:12.480]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating
[22:12.480 --> 22:17.120]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[22:17.120 --> 22:22.160]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in
[22:22.160 --> 22:24.560]  London were carried out by British intelligence.
[22:24.560 --> 22:28.880]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to
[22:28.880 --> 22:35.240]  disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and
[22:35.240 --> 22:36.240]  much, much more.
[22:36.240 --> 22:40.320]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[22:40.320 --> 22:42.560]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[22:42.560 --> 22:47.080]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[23:29.600 --> 23:31.560]  You need the Magic Yellow Flyer.

[23:40.680 --> 23:41.680]  you.

[24:08.680 --> 24:18.440]  All over the United States, from Tennessee to New York State, they are not allowing conservative
[24:18.440 --> 24:22.080]  or libertarian kiosk.
[24:22.080 --> 24:24.280]  They give them the license at first.
[24:24.280 --> 24:28.960]  There are pro-Obama and anti-conservative kiosk around the nation, those are fine.
[24:28.960 --> 24:34.040]  But malls all over the country are banning them.
[24:34.040 --> 24:38.240]  And this is in the news today, the latest article out of the Johnson City Press.
[24:38.240 --> 24:42.280]  No more business for no Obama salesman.
[24:42.280 --> 24:45.440]  And it says he has a business in the mall and he's been told he's not allowed to have
[24:45.440 --> 24:46.440]  it now.
[24:46.440 --> 24:47.440]  He's being kicked out.
[24:47.440 --> 24:50.240]  We see these articles every couple of days at different malls.
[24:50.240 --> 24:56.440]  Now, I just got a globe world exclusive and it came out a few weeks ago that the White
[24:56.440 --> 25:05.360]  House does have a big enemies list and insiders have now leaked it.
[25:05.360 --> 25:10.800]  Good President targets Loudmouth, Glenbeck, Singers Pat Boone, and Toby Keith, and rival
[25:10.800 --> 25:14.320]  Sarah Palin and they have the list.
[25:14.320 --> 25:17.960]  And guess who is number 24 on the list?
[25:17.960 --> 25:24.960]  This is front page of a big Canadian paper and British papers are both reporting on
[25:24.960 --> 25:27.160]  this right now.
[25:27.160 --> 25:32.080]  Alex Jones, maker of the anti-Obama film, the Obama deception in the fall of the Republic,
[25:32.080 --> 25:34.200]  the presidency of Barack Obama.
[25:34.200 --> 25:39.640]  I even beat out Michelle Malkin, she's number 25, author of Culture of Corruption Obama and
[25:39.640 --> 25:42.880]  his team of tax cheats, crooks, and cronies.
[25:42.880 --> 25:48.920]  Boy, this is not good news.
[25:48.920 --> 25:58.960]  I guess it is good news, depending on the way that you look at it.
[25:58.960 --> 26:02.840]  Under relentless assaults from a mob of vicious critics, President Barack Obama has drawn
[26:02.840 --> 26:07.200]  up a secret list of enemies he aims to take down one by one.
[26:07.200 --> 26:12.960]  That's the shocking word from political insiders who tell Globe the White House hit list contains
[26:12.960 --> 26:19.200]  25 names so far and it's topped by Fox TV host Glenbeck, former Alaska Governor Sarah
[26:19.200 --> 26:26.720]  Palin, Congressman Joe Uly, Wilson, and author Larry Sinclair who claims he was a gay trist
[26:26.720 --> 26:27.720]  with Obama.
[26:27.720 --> 26:32.840]  Globally, ultra-religious pop legend Pat Boone who's saying the 1950s hit April Love is also
[26:32.840 --> 26:37.240]  marked for action as is country star Toby Keith insiders say.
[26:37.240 --> 26:41.320]  Boone is part of a group claiming Obama's presidency is illegal.
[26:41.320 --> 26:45.600]  They insist he was born in Africa, not Hawaii, which would violate a constitutional clause
[26:45.600 --> 26:49.360]  requiring the commander in chief be a natural born American.
[26:49.360 --> 26:54.440]  This is war, an insider tells Globe, Obama is going to do whatever he can to discredit
[26:54.440 --> 26:55.440]  these people.
[26:55.440 --> 27:00.040]  They're attacking me mainly from alternative media making up lies about me, but that actually
[27:00.040 --> 27:03.320]  only gets more listeners to find out the truth and hear the show.
[27:03.320 --> 27:07.000]  People hear the lies and tune in and find out what we really do here.
[27:07.000 --> 27:08.840]  So yes, we're under a major attack.
[27:08.840 --> 27:12.600]  I don't get into it a lot on air, but all the stops have been pulled out against this
[27:12.600 --> 27:14.560]  office and what we do here.
[27:14.560 --> 27:16.880]  So pray for us, folks.
[27:16.880 --> 27:19.340]  The article goes on to say he wants them silenced.
[27:19.340 --> 27:23.360]  He is enraged by the constant attacks on his presidency and against him personally.
[27:23.360 --> 27:24.560]  He just had it.
[27:24.560 --> 27:27.160]  This has become a very personal for him.
[27:27.160 --> 27:31.160]  Iron fisted First Lady Michelle was behind her husband's decision to go on the offensive.
[27:31.160 --> 27:35.320]  Sources reveal he's even held a strategy session with former President Bill Clinton,
[27:35.320 --> 27:37.720]  who was known as a slick political pit bull.
[27:37.720 --> 27:41.480]  Yeah, and to have people murdered, I would add the Clinton death list to discuss ways
[27:41.480 --> 27:46.120]  to destroy his most valuable and outspoken opponents, his most visible and outspoken
[27:46.120 --> 27:53.040]  opponents sources say up until now, Obama has let his foes savage him mercilessly, even
[27:53.040 --> 27:58.120]  though insiders say Michelle has been urging him to fight back, fearing he'd be branded
[27:58.120 --> 27:59.120]  a wimp.
[27:59.120 --> 28:04.920]  Yeah, I've been seeing all the liberals on all the fake liberals like, um, oh, that
[28:04.920 --> 28:05.920]  Bill Maher.
[28:05.920 --> 28:10.760]  Yeah, I watched that a lot when I'm on the treadmill, but it's always rearing on HBO.
[28:10.760 --> 28:14.960]  And he just constantly says, don't be a wimp, attack them, go after them, arrest them.
[28:14.960 --> 28:18.240]  But the leader of the free world shrugged off the attacks as part of his job.
[28:18.240 --> 28:22.920]  The final straw came with South Carolina Republican Wilson shouted out, you lie on national TV
[28:22.920 --> 28:26.840]  as a president address Congress about his health care plan on September 9th.
[28:26.840 --> 28:33.480]  Obama was absolutely incensed by Wilson sources say that's when Obama said enough is enough.
[28:33.480 --> 28:35.600]  He's had it with president nice guy.
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.000]  He's going to fight back immediately after the Wilson incident, Michelle and the president's
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.160]  trusted inner circle got together and drafted the enemy's list.
[28:44.160 --> 28:48.880]  The source adds the roster includes obvious critics like Wilson and conservative commentators
[28:48.880 --> 28:51.480]  like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly sources say.
[28:51.480 --> 28:54.680]  The talk show host Beck is the White House number one enemy.
[28:54.680 --> 28:57.920]  And for good reason, the sources say Beck called Obama a racist.
[28:57.920 --> 29:01.080]  Well, he is part of a racist church and said the insider.
[29:01.080 --> 29:05.040]  He said the president has a deep seated hatred for white people and the white culture in
[29:05.040 --> 29:08.080]  the U S is on its way to becoming a fascist state.
[29:08.080 --> 29:11.600]  Beck also labeled White House environmental advisor Van Jones as an avowed communist.
[29:11.600 --> 29:15.960]  Well, he admits he is and a black nationalist and took him down and early September Jones
[29:15.960 --> 29:21.320]  was forced to resign it for Beck dug up video in which Jones called Republicans bleepers.
[29:21.320 --> 29:25.840]  Say it and revealed Obama's appointee signed a petition for 9 11 truth and it goes on for
[29:25.840 --> 29:27.160]  our page after page.
[29:27.160 --> 29:31.760]  Well, this is pretty creepy, ladies and gentlemen, not allowed to criticize Obama.
[29:31.760 --> 29:37.080]  Have your chaos shut down, banning free speech at the G 20 and Pittsburgh trying to forcibly
[29:37.080 --> 29:38.080]  inoculate people.
[29:38.080 --> 29:42.360]  He has school children under federal curriculum, worshiping him coast to coast, something out
[29:42.360 --> 29:44.960]  of malice China or Nazi Germany.
[29:44.960 --> 29:51.160]  Wow, I am very honored to be number 24 on the top 25 enemies.
[29:51.160 --> 29:54.880]  Later on the March, the Empire's on the run.
[29:54.880 --> 29:58.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:58.320 --> 30:04.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[30:04.000 --> 30:08.360]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[30:08.360 --> 30:09.360]  do you want?
[30:09.360 --> 30:14.920]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[30:14.920 --> 30:16.400]  Food is your only ammunition.
[30:16.400 --> 30:17.640]  How much do you want?
[30:17.640 --> 30:18.640]  When do you want it?
[30:18.640 --> 30:20.640]  Now or after the battle starts?
[30:20.640 --> 30:21.760]  When will you need it?
[30:21.760 --> 30:23.880]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[30:23.880 --> 30:25.240]  Will there be any food?
[30:25.240 --> 30:26.680]  Will it make your children sick?
[30:26.680 --> 30:30.840]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[30:30.840 --> 30:32.000]  and be immunized?
[30:32.000 --> 30:35.760]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[30:35.760 --> 30:39.360]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[30:39.360 --> 30:40.600]  How much will you need?
[30:40.600 --> 30:41.600]  We don't know.
[30:41.600 --> 30:42.600]  How much do you want?
[30:42.600 --> 30:43.600]  All you can get.
[30:43.600 --> 30:44.600]  I'm Alex Jones.
[30:44.600 --> 30:52.280]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
[30:52.280 --> 31:01.120]  out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[31:01.120 --> 31:06.560]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[31:06.560 --> 31:12.680]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[31:12.680 --> 31:14.520]  just as well funded.
[31:14.520 --> 31:19.680]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[31:19.680 --> 31:20.680]  of the American people.
[31:20.680 --> 31:25.560]  Well, Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[31:25.560 --> 31:30.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[31:30.760 --> 31:37.200]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[31:37.200 --> 31:40.760]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[31:40.760 --> 31:47.640]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[31:47.640 --> 31:53.120]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in super
[31:53.120 --> 31:55.840]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[31:55.840 --> 32:00.400]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[32:00.400 --> 32:03.080]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[32:03.080 --> 32:06.120]  I've been so sick, will the life change tea help me?
[32:06.120 --> 32:08.000]  Our answer is always the same.
[32:08.000 --> 32:14.200]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water, and air are attacking you this very moment.
[32:14.200 --> 32:20.080]  Fight back with our all-natural, detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[32:20.080 --> 32:24.520]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[32:24.520 --> 32:26.000]  We use results.
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.720]  Life change tea's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[32:30.720 --> 32:35.240]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[32:35.240 --> 32:39.240]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[32:39.240 --> 32:43.000]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[32:43.000 --> 32:54.880]  Our number is 928-308-0408, again that's 928-308-0408, or you can order online at getthetea.com.
[32:54.880 --> 33:10.200]  Let's get the tea.com and remember, we have the cheapest shipping in the industry.
[33:10.200 --> 33:14.920]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. we're here live, I'm Alex Jones, joining
[33:14.920 --> 33:20.880]  us, popping in with an update on his quest for 9-11 truth, his request for the president
[33:20.880 --> 33:26.240]  to read his 20 bullet points and his quest to get the media to not distort what he said
[33:26.240 --> 33:30.880]  but debate him on fair terms, Charlie Sheen joins us.
[33:30.880 --> 33:32.560]  Charlie Sheen, good to have you here.
[33:32.560 --> 33:33.560]  Great to be here, Alex.
[33:33.560 --> 33:34.560]  How are you, man?
[33:34.560 --> 33:35.560]  I'm great.
[33:35.560 --> 33:42.320]  I just told you about that I'm on the White House Enemies list to be taken out politically,
[33:42.320 --> 33:46.600]  a number 24 or 25.
[33:46.600 --> 33:52.040]  Now, how long is the list, how many names are on there, or do we even know?
[33:52.040 --> 33:53.440]  25 people are on it.
[33:53.440 --> 33:55.440]  Oh, so you're number 25.
[33:55.440 --> 33:57.080]  I'm number 24, I'm 25.
[33:57.080 --> 33:58.080]  Ah, excellent.
[33:58.080 --> 34:02.720]  So you just made the cut, congratulations, Alex, that's fabulous.
[34:02.720 --> 34:03.720]  Unbelievable.
[34:03.720 --> 34:10.040]  So these knuckleheads would compile a list, you know, singling out people that are searching
[34:10.040 --> 34:14.880]  for the truth, that are asking these clowns to be accountable for their action, it's just
[34:14.880 --> 34:15.880]  unbelievable.
[34:15.880 --> 34:21.160]  So this is the country we live in today, fabulous, fabulous.
[34:21.160 --> 34:22.160]  It's amazing.
[34:22.160 --> 34:25.840]  And you know, my film that the White House singles out exposes Bush and Obama and just
[34:25.840 --> 34:30.840]  says that Obama's continuing the wars, the Patriot Act, secret arrest, and that we wish
[34:30.840 --> 34:34.520]  Obama would keep his promises, and I guess I get on a list for this.
[34:34.520 --> 34:39.240]  Yeah, you're not making anything up, you just, you know, you're just pointing to the truth,
[34:39.240 --> 34:40.240]  that's all.
[34:40.240 --> 34:41.240]  Yikes.
[34:41.240 --> 34:46.360]  I mean, I guess, I guess at this point in the game, it's better to be on the enemy's
[34:46.360 --> 34:48.600]  list than the friend's list, right?
[34:48.600 --> 34:49.600]  Absolutely.
[34:49.600 --> 34:54.000]  If you're on the friend's list, you've got to be employed by Wall Street, you know.
[34:54.000 --> 34:55.000]  Absolutely.
[34:55.000 --> 35:00.320]  Charlie, let's get into your 20 minutes with the president, mega viral all over the web,
[35:00.320 --> 35:04.360]  millions of views, and your message to the president, the video.
[35:04.360 --> 35:09.560]  The media attacked you, they distorted what you had to say, they never really mentioned
[35:09.560 --> 35:13.920]  your specific bullet points like six of the 10 commission members saying that 9-11 was
[35:13.920 --> 35:17.080]  a cover up, a hoax, a fraud, that there should be a criminal investigation.
[35:17.080 --> 35:18.080]  Right.
[35:18.080 --> 35:23.640]  I know this has been frustrating for you and I, can you, can you speak to that?
[35:23.640 --> 35:30.120]  Well, yeah, it's just, it's exactly what we anticipated would happen, that they would
[35:30.120 --> 35:36.440]  attack the man and not the facts, but it got, it got so blatant that I think they really
[35:36.440 --> 35:41.240]  showed their hand in, in, in how they, and how they treated it, and how they behaved
[35:41.240 --> 35:42.240]  around it.
[35:42.240 --> 35:48.320]  And I think that, I think that, that sends such a, such a huge message right there that,
[35:48.320 --> 35:53.880]  that you and I put forth something that, that they just, as I said before, they couldn't
[35:53.880 --> 35:59.560]  disassemble, so they tried to disassemble me, you know.
[35:59.560 --> 36:00.560]  Absolutely.
[36:00.560 --> 36:05.800]  And it's a shame because, you know, we're not, you know, we're not naked shouting from
[36:05.800 --> 36:10.160]  the top of a building, come debate us, we're just, you know, we're issuing a very calm
[36:10.160 --> 36:16.440]  and, and, and reasonable offer to, to just sit down in a, in an open and, and, and, and
[36:16.440 --> 36:20.840]  fair debate forum and, and hash this thing out.
[36:20.840 --> 36:25.040]  And as you and I were talking yesterday, we did get a nibble.
[36:25.040 --> 36:32.760]  We got a nibble to O'Reilly's credit, but it's, it's, it's odd to put those two words
[36:32.760 --> 36:38.840]  in the same sentence, O'Reilly and credit, but, but it just, we haven't reached an agreement
[36:38.840 --> 36:42.960]  on, on the terms that, that, that we set forth.
[36:42.960 --> 36:47.680]  And this afternoon we're going to be publishing an article at prismplanet.com that I and Paul
[36:47.680 --> 36:53.320]  Watson are going to be putting together, and specifically, now we can tell people what
[36:53.320 --> 36:59.040]  happened behind the scenes, Larry King live contacted you, your publicist, they wanted
[36:59.040 --> 37:03.880]  to have you on, but then they couldn't find anybody to come on and debate you from the
[37:03.880 --> 37:04.880]  other side.
[37:04.880 --> 37:05.880]  We have those emails.
[37:05.880 --> 37:06.880]  Right.
[37:06.880 --> 37:07.880]  Right.
[37:07.880 --> 37:11.600]  We also then O'Reilly's people contacted and said, yeah, basically come on our show
[37:11.600 --> 37:13.600]  and we'll slap you around and turn your mic off.
[37:13.600 --> 37:16.640]  Basically, you said, no, we're going to be publishing that email.
[37:16.640 --> 37:22.160]  You said, no, we want to do it neutral where I get one minute, you get one minute.
[37:22.160 --> 37:25.680]  Good morning America looked at it and then backed off of it.
[37:25.680 --> 37:29.560]  I guess that's the nibble because if they actually put you on TV and they know this
[37:29.560 --> 37:30.560]  would be huge ratings.
[37:30.560 --> 37:31.800]  So there's no reason they shouldn't.
[37:31.800 --> 37:32.800]  Right.
[37:32.800 --> 37:37.400]  Except for the fact is we talked about, I'm just paraphrasing, you know, your, your analysis
[37:37.400 --> 37:42.440]  that I think spot on dead on, that they know your 20 points are too powerful and they don't
[37:42.440 --> 37:43.800]  want that discussed.
[37:43.800 --> 37:48.960]  And so they're turning down Charlie Sheen wanting to have a debate on national TV, which
[37:48.960 --> 37:51.400]  any TV producer would kill to have happened.
[37:51.400 --> 37:55.280]  Well, no, I mean, yeah, I mean, I, I, I can't say that.
[37:55.280 --> 37:58.600]  But if, but if you insist, then thank you.
[37:58.600 --> 38:04.240]  But yeah, no, but I, I, as I said, I just think it's in, it's in keeping with, with
[38:04.240 --> 38:11.440]  how this, this, this very deceptive and dangerous machine operates, you know, and, and as long
[38:11.440 --> 38:17.920]  as they've got, they've got the media under their control, then, then this is the mountain
[38:17.920 --> 38:21.360]  that we must continue to climb, you know.
[38:21.360 --> 38:24.480]  Well it certainly is.
[38:24.480 --> 38:28.960]  Now maybe O'Reilly will agree to debate you somewhere or maybe even agree on his own show
[38:28.960 --> 38:31.920]  to have a moderator in and to have a real debate.
[38:31.920 --> 38:37.400]  I mean, it would be as big as Vice President Gore debating Ross Perot, I guarantee it.
[38:37.400 --> 38:40.960]  I mean, they could definitely sell tickets to this thing, but they are afraid.
[38:40.960 --> 38:46.600]  They want a one-sided, well, just like what we saw with Geraldo Rivera when he was on O'Reilly.
[38:46.600 --> 38:50.560]  I mean, they pulled out every stop or that other show that they have on in the middle
[38:50.560 --> 38:51.560]  of the night on Fox.
[38:51.560 --> 38:57.600]  I mean, this was the most brutal, savage, attempted character assassination I've ever
[38:57.600 --> 38:58.600]  seen.
[38:58.600 --> 39:05.760]  Yeah, it was even worse than the first go-around back in, back in March of 06.
[39:05.760 --> 39:09.880]  It's almost like they were sending a message, you know, we, we, we warned you back then
[39:09.880 --> 39:15.720]  and, and, and now we're gonna, you know, we're, we're pulling out all the stops this time.
[39:15.720 --> 39:22.480]  You know, but again, if, you know, 90% of the comments of the, of the reader comments
[39:22.480 --> 39:28.760]  and of the viewer comments, everybody, at least 90%, they, they kept saying, look at
[39:28.760 --> 39:33.560]  his document, look at his facts, look at his data, look at his information, stop going
[39:33.560 --> 39:35.120]  after him.
[39:35.120 --> 39:41.480]  So people, you know, are, are, are very much aware of, of, of this, this sham tactic, you
[39:41.480 --> 39:42.480]  know.
[39:42.480 --> 39:48.560]  Well, in the final equation, tens of millions of people conservatively read your letter,
[39:48.560 --> 39:53.960]  read your bullet points, and it has definitely re-energized 9-11 truth that was still growing
[39:53.960 --> 39:54.960]  but not as fast.
[39:54.960 --> 39:55.960]  Right.
[39:55.960 --> 39:56.960]  So I commend you.
[39:56.960 --> 39:58.960]  You knew you'd be a, well, no, thank you, Charlie.
[39:58.960 --> 40:00.560]  You knew you'd be attacked for this.
[40:00.560 --> 40:01.560]  Of course.
[40:01.560 --> 40:04.080]  Why did you do it in the final equation?
[40:04.080 --> 40:10.080]  In the final equation, I, I, I have to say that it, that it, that the message I was
[40:10.080 --> 40:17.400]  trying to get out was new president, new investigation.
[40:17.400 --> 40:21.240]  I think that's, that's pretty much it at the end of the day, new president, new investigation.
[40:21.240 --> 40:22.240]  You know.
[40:22.240 --> 40:26.920]  And as you said in the letter, you voted for Obama, you believe all the things he said
[40:26.920 --> 40:27.920]  he was going to do.
[40:27.920 --> 40:30.840]  Has he kept any of his promises, Charlie?
[40:30.840 --> 40:33.520]  Um, none that I've observed.
[40:33.520 --> 40:39.320]  Uh, if you, if you discover any that, that were kept, please, uh, bring me up to speed,
[40:39.320 --> 40:42.280]  you know, believe me, I'd like to, I'd like to find some.
[40:42.280 --> 40:45.880]  Now he's saying Guantanamo is going to stay open and they're going to set up camps here
[40:45.880 --> 40:47.560]  in the U S shifting gears.
[40:47.560 --> 40:49.520]  I know you've got to get back on the set.
[40:49.520 --> 40:53.960]  Uh, you guys are rehearsing for two and a half men, the top rated comedy TV show right
[40:53.960 --> 40:54.960]  now.
[40:54.960 --> 40:58.920]  Uh, the, the contest now, now we announced a few weeks ago, we're going to have it Monday
[40:58.920 --> 41:00.720]  is going to be the official date.
[41:00.720 --> 41:04.040]  Charlie is judge, jury, uh, executioner.
[41:04.040 --> 41:09.280]  He is the guy that is going to watch the videos, uh, and, uh, you, people are going
[41:09.280 --> 41:11.560]  to have one month from next Monday.
[41:11.560 --> 41:15.720]  We're going to have a special website that we're building just for this, uh, and I'll
[41:15.720 --> 41:20.160]  have the specific rules that Charlie and I are finalizing the next few days, but specifically
[41:20.160 --> 41:23.600]  Charlie, what are you looking for in the winter here?
[41:23.600 --> 41:32.280]  Um, I'm, I'm, I'm just looking for, uh, the most interesting interpretation of, of the
[41:32.280 --> 41:37.840]  material and, and you know, um, I mean, I would, I would, you know, I'm not looking
[41:37.840 --> 41:42.880]  for people to turn it into a song and that might be a little much, but I'm just looking
[41:42.880 --> 41:48.640]  for perhaps the most interesting interpretation, the most passionate interpretation, um, just
[41:48.640 --> 41:54.360]  something that, that, that you and I might not have, have thought of in, in imagining
[41:54.360 --> 41:57.840]  what people are going to present, how they're going to, how they're going to construct this
[41:57.840 --> 42:00.200]  thing, how they're going to create it and present it.
[42:00.200 --> 42:06.080]  Um, and, and again, you know, people don't have to, have to be off book, meaning no
[42:06.080 --> 42:11.360]  scripts in hand, you know, because I mean, I, I, you know, you and I wrote the damn
[42:11.360 --> 42:14.000]  thing and there's no way you and I could do it memorized.
[42:14.000 --> 42:20.840]  So it is fine with, with the document in hand, if it's just read, but, um, and again, there's
[42:20.840 --> 42:30.440]  no, um, there's, there's, there's no, uh, constraints on, on, on, uh, on race, on sex,
[42:30.440 --> 42:35.160]  on age, on anything, it's all about just whatever two people decide to sit down and
[42:35.160 --> 42:40.000]  bring this thing to life and however they do it, then the one that, that, that strikes
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.320]  me as, as being the most interesting, that's the one that will award to be the winner.
[42:44.320 --> 42:48.920]  And there's not only the $13,500 prize cause you want people after taxes to get 10 grand
[42:48.920 --> 42:49.920]  very nicely, Charlie.
[42:49.920 --> 42:50.920]  I was announcing, thank you.
[42:50.920 --> 42:51.920]  Thank you.
[42:51.920 --> 42:52.920]  You bet.
[42:52.920 --> 42:55.280]  I was announcing 10 grand and then you corrected me during the break, you said, well, make
[42:55.280 --> 43:00.000]  it so they get actually 10 grand, uh, after taxes, second place, we'll get a thousand,
[43:00.000 --> 43:01.800]  third place, I'll get 500.
[43:01.800 --> 43:08.200]  There's a secret surprise as well, uh, that is going to be done with some of the best
[43:08.200 --> 43:13.920]  videos that we're going to just leave as a surprise until later, but this is a contest.
[43:13.920 --> 43:16.720]  Everybody wants to be involved in, I want to see hundreds and hundreds.
[43:16.720 --> 43:18.720]  I know we're going to see hundreds and hundreds of entries.
[43:18.720 --> 43:22.440]  We've seen hundreds when I have a thousand dollar prize, right?
[43:22.440 --> 43:30.480]  And so, uh, in closing, uh, I could paraphrase your idea, but we're doing this obviously
[43:30.480 --> 43:35.200]  so that there are hundreds of viral videos with the 20 bullet points and people can boil
[43:35.200 --> 43:37.400]  down the 15 pages or so.
[43:37.400 --> 43:39.560]  They don't have to read the entire document.
[43:39.560 --> 43:42.000]  Charlie closing comments on that.
[43:42.000 --> 43:47.200]  Well, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm hoping because there's been a bit of a low since the publishing
[43:47.200 --> 43:51.480]  of the document and, and the launching of the video, I'm hoping that this brings it
[43:51.480 --> 43:56.680]  back to the forefront and, and, and floods the internet with all these new videos and
[43:56.680 --> 44:03.280]  all this new energy and, and, and, and really, um, you know, uh, is a slap in the face to,
[44:03.280 --> 44:07.600]  to Google and what they did or to YouTube and what they did to that video, you know,
[44:07.600 --> 44:09.400]  yeah, they clearly put the brakes on it.
[44:09.400 --> 44:10.400]  It was obvious.
[44:10.400 --> 44:11.400]  I mean, come on.
[44:11.400 --> 44:15.120]  It was a hundred thousand views a day and then suddenly it just came to a screeching
[44:15.120 --> 44:16.120]  halt.
[44:16.120 --> 44:20.520]  It was, yeah, it was a little suspicious to say the least, you know, well, Charlie, I'm
[44:20.520 --> 44:23.560]  going to let you get back to what you're doing, but just to give people a little bit
[44:23.560 --> 44:31.120]  of a hint, this, this video contest is phase two and throughout the future, uh, just so
[44:31.120 --> 44:33.520]  people can get a little bit of foreshadowing.
[44:33.520 --> 44:36.120]  We are planning some other interesting things.
[44:36.120 --> 44:37.120]  Yes, we are.
[44:37.120 --> 44:38.120]  Yes, we are.
[44:38.120 --> 44:44.440]  No, this is not, uh, this is a multi-phase project and, and phase one complete phase
[44:44.440 --> 44:49.000]  two is beginning and, um, phase three will be a big surprise.
[44:49.000 --> 44:53.920]  And phase two is all about the listeners and the viewers taking action.
[44:53.920 --> 44:56.440]  We're giving you the ball, run with it.
[44:56.440 --> 45:00.840]  And again, there's a phase two to phase two, Charlie, thank you so much for spending time
[45:00.840 --> 45:01.840]  with us.
[45:01.840 --> 45:02.840]  Not at all.
[45:02.840 --> 45:03.840]  Thank you, Alex.
[45:03.840 --> 45:04.840]  I will talk to you soon.
[45:04.840 --> 45:05.840]  All right.
[45:05.840 --> 45:06.840]  Take care of my friend.
[45:06.840 --> 45:07.840]  Okay.
[45:07.840 --> 45:08.840]  Bye-bye.
[45:08.840 --> 45:09.840]  All right.
[45:09.840 --> 45:10.840]  There goes Charlie Sheen.
[45:10.840 --> 45:11.840]  Yeah.
[45:11.840 --> 45:13.640]  Very, this guy has got a new idea and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[45:13.640 --> 45:16.880]  That is much bigger than even the first.
[45:16.880 --> 45:17.880]  And believe me.
[45:17.880 --> 45:22.960]  Now, by the way, I ended up staying up late again last night working on the Gardasil stories
[45:22.960 --> 45:25.200]  and researching what's happening with that.
[45:25.200 --> 45:29.520]  And because we got so many hundreds of entries, I was not going to not watch them all.
[45:29.520 --> 45:30.880]  I finally watched all of them.
[45:30.880 --> 45:32.360]  I bet off more than I can shoe.
[45:32.360 --> 45:38.280]  I got behind, uh, on, uh, judging all of these was supposed to announce it a couple
[45:38.280 --> 45:42.360]  weeks ago, the latest thousand dollar contest for your political poster.
[45:42.360 --> 45:47.560]  We've already had the other one and paid out on that, the Obama Joker poster that had huge
[45:47.560 --> 45:48.560]  international success.
[45:48.560 --> 45:55.520]  Thanks to you, but I have judged and at the end of the show today, I'm going to announce
[45:55.520 --> 45:56.520]  the winners tomorrow.
[45:56.520 --> 46:00.520]  I'm going to play the three winning videos, but we're going to get another article out
[46:00.520 --> 46:02.080]  today or tomorrow about it.
[46:02.080 --> 46:04.760]  I just got so far behind, I bet off more than I can chew.
[46:04.760 --> 46:05.760]  I try to do too much.
[46:05.760 --> 46:09.840]  It's like I'm a mule trying to carry up a big bag of rocks on my back of a mountain.
[46:09.840 --> 46:12.240]  And I kind of slid down a little bit, but that's okay.
[46:12.240 --> 46:13.240]  Cause I kicked.
[46:13.240 --> 46:15.960]  You ever seen a mule when it gets mad, when it's trying to climb up a hill or something,
[46:15.960 --> 46:19.560]  and it gets mad after it falls down and kicks back up the hill.
[46:19.560 --> 46:23.600]  I've done a little bit of cowboy and so I've seen horses and mules and stuff.
[46:23.600 --> 46:28.360]  Uh, you know, when they get mad, like they'll, you'll, uh, well, let's be honest, I was
[46:28.360 --> 46:31.560]  always in there with a hot shot or dehorning them and a few times got on a horse, but
[46:31.560 --> 46:34.520]  always got thrown off or hurt the real cowboys.
[46:34.520 --> 46:38.800]  They'd be in there with these wild, uh, steers that have been out on a big ranch for years
[46:38.800 --> 46:43.200]  and ever even been vaccinated to dehorn, they were getting ready for sale and they had incredible
[46:43.200 --> 46:48.920]  work horses and, and mules and they lasso, you know, one of those cows or bulls and start
[46:48.920 --> 46:50.840]  dragging them in with two horses or one horse.
[46:50.840 --> 46:55.360]  And sometimes that horse will get pulled back and you see that horse get mad and just bustles
[46:55.360 --> 46:56.360]  with pound out.
[46:56.360 --> 47:00.720]  Those horses would just start bucking, dragging a cow twice their size, a bull twice their
[47:00.720 --> 47:02.800]  size, just going wild.
[47:02.800 --> 47:07.880]  Anyways, that's, that's where that analogy, uh, comes from, uh, of seeing a horse when
[47:07.880 --> 47:10.200]  it gets pissed off, uh, just amazing.
[47:10.200 --> 47:13.400]  And I've seen horses drag cattle through fences.
[47:13.400 --> 47:14.400]  Just getting wild.
[47:14.400 --> 47:18.800]  Anyway, side issue, real cowboy and folks, not the stuff you see at the rodeos.
[47:18.800 --> 47:19.800]  It's even more vicious.
[47:19.800 --> 47:26.080]  So I don't make a documentary about real cowboys.
[47:26.080 --> 47:29.800]  Every time I see a documentary about cowboys, it's some guy lives on some family ranch
[47:29.800 --> 47:34.880]  and wearing a big fancy hat and sure he's going to the lasso, but real cowboys are
[47:34.880 --> 47:37.720]  out at three AM at the bar drunk as a skunk.
[47:37.720 --> 47:41.600]  Then they're driving 18 wheelers hauling gravel and they go out three, four days a week
[47:41.600 --> 47:46.400]  with no sleep and getting fist fights with each other and drag, uh, drag cattle around.
[47:46.400 --> 47:48.280]  These people are maniacs.
[47:48.280 --> 47:49.280]  Side issue.
[47:49.280 --> 47:51.080]  I just wish I could go make documentaries about stuff like that.
[47:51.080 --> 47:56.080]  The things I've experienced is very macho culture folks.
[47:56.080 --> 47:57.080]  Very macho.
[47:57.080 --> 47:58.080]  I mean, you'll just be sitting there.
[47:58.080 --> 48:01.920]  You know, when I was like six, I did it when I was 13, 14, 15, and someone I was 16 on
[48:01.920 --> 48:05.760]  the summers, he'd be sitting there.
[48:05.760 --> 48:11.400]  And uh, these guys were so testosterone down, uh, I'm not even going to tell the stories
[48:11.400 --> 48:14.320]  that people wouldn't believe it.
[48:14.320 --> 48:16.320]  They wouldn't believe it.
[48:16.320 --> 48:20.040]  Um, side issue.
[48:20.040 --> 48:21.560]  Some things are just better not told.
[48:21.560 --> 48:25.200]  I think actually people don't believe it anyways.
[48:25.200 --> 48:26.200]  That's weird ass life.
[48:26.200 --> 48:30.640]  I've got, I'm now on the white house enemies list, we get mega death on.
[48:30.640 --> 48:33.160]  We've woken up naming their new album off of in game.
[48:33.160 --> 48:36.680]  My film, a lot of people were pointing that out.
[48:36.680 --> 48:37.840]  I actually knew behind the scenes.
[48:37.840 --> 48:41.440]  It was named after that, but I wanted to let Dave Mustaine say it on air.
[48:41.440 --> 48:42.440]  I was getting these emails.
[48:42.440 --> 48:45.640]  You lying, bastard, mega death, urinates on you.
[48:45.640 --> 48:46.640]  They hate you.
[48:46.640 --> 48:51.160]  I was like, yeah, right, but look, it's just a little bit of satisfaction here in the face
[48:51.160 --> 48:55.400]  of all this danger to have the white house to be on their enemies list, to see that we're
[48:55.400 --> 49:01.240]  waking up Bruce Willis and Dave Mustaine and Charlie Sheen and Jesse Ventura and Willie
[49:01.240 --> 49:06.080]  Nelson and just countless other people I can't even name here because they want to be private.
[49:06.080 --> 49:07.920]  People say, oh, it's a matter of you're waking up celebrities.
[49:07.920 --> 49:12.560]  That's a gauge of society and if the celebrities aren't fake right wingers or fake leftists
[49:12.560 --> 49:17.360]  anymore and they've woken up the paradigm, that is just a signpost or an indicator or
[49:17.360 --> 49:22.320]  a thermostat showing you the mercury's rising for liberty.
[49:22.320 --> 49:24.280]  And so it's a blessing.
[49:24.280 --> 49:27.880]  I'm very honored to be on the white house enemies list.
[49:27.880 --> 49:33.200]  It's just if I get killed at a car jacking or I get found in a hotel room in a clown
[49:33.200 --> 49:40.080]  suit with heroin needles hanging out of me, I don't dress in clown suits or inject heroin.
[49:40.080 --> 49:41.800]  And I say that because that's the kind of thing they do.
[49:41.800 --> 49:48.440]  They kill you and dress you like a woman or, you know, or they kill a woman and kill you
[49:48.440 --> 49:51.960]  and throw them in, you know, into a pit.
[49:51.960 --> 49:52.960]  This is the kind of crap.
[49:52.960 --> 49:56.080]  They walk up in a grocery store parking lot and cap you in the back of the head and take
[49:56.080 --> 49:57.080]  your wallet.
[49:57.080 --> 50:03.520]  And if that happens to me, because it says Bill Clinton is involved in this and he runs
[50:03.520 --> 50:05.880]  hit teams, murder teams.
[50:05.880 --> 50:09.280]  Don't forget the Clinton Chronicles and all of that and the death list.
[50:09.280 --> 50:11.840]  If they do kill me, remember that is a victory.
[50:11.840 --> 50:12.840]  Not a victory for me.
[50:12.840 --> 50:15.680]  I mean, I'm not, I don't want it to happen and I'll never kill myself and I love life
[50:15.680 --> 50:16.680]  so much.
[50:16.680 --> 50:26.480]  It's unbelievable, but in the final equation, it means we're hurting the new world order.
[50:26.480 --> 50:27.680]  It means we've got power.
[50:27.680 --> 50:29.360]  It means we're affecting change.
[50:29.360 --> 50:33.200]  It means they're scared of us.
[50:33.200 --> 50:37.680]  Then I walked out on my front porch last night and there were huge orange and red and pink
[50:37.680 --> 50:41.040]  thunderheads with the sunset hitting them, flashing with lightning.
[50:41.040 --> 50:42.320]  The moon was out.
[50:42.320 --> 50:44.320]  Jupiter was out.
[50:44.320 --> 50:47.960]  It was still daylight, but Jupiter and the moon were out and it was just so gorgeous.
[50:47.960 --> 50:52.680]  I could smell the fresh cut grass and the oak trees and I just love God.
[50:52.680 --> 50:53.680]  I love creation.
[50:53.680 --> 50:58.600]  I love innocence and I'm so thankful for the position God's put me in, the great honor
[50:58.600 --> 51:28.560]  of standing against the beast.
[51:28.600 --> 51:35.080]  Right around 50% over smoking regular cigarettes, so get rid of the ashtrays, the smell and
[51:35.080 --> 51:36.080]  the smoke.

[52:00.240 --> 52:05.600]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[52:05.600 --> 52:07.120]  against this country.
[52:07.120 --> 52:09.400]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[52:09.400 --> 52:11.000]  But who is the enemy?
[52:11.000 --> 52:12.000]  Bin Laden.

[52:33.960 --> 52:39.480]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[52:39.480 --> 52:43.320]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and
[52:43.320 --> 52:45.720]  much, much more fabled enemies.

[1:11:56.140 --> 1:11:59.140]  Look, I'm just gonna open the phones up
[1:11:59.140 --> 1:12:01.140]  Regroup here
[1:12:01.140 --> 1:12:03.140]  So much news coming in
[1:12:03.140 --> 1:12:05.140]  Merck teams, national police forces
[1:12:05.140 --> 1:12:07.140]  World government being openly announced
[1:12:07.140 --> 1:12:09.140]  Gardasil deaths
[1:12:09.140 --> 1:12:12.140]  Deadly stuff in the flu vaccine now being admitted
[1:12:12.140 --> 1:12:15.140]  It's all just off the charts insane
[1:12:15.140 --> 1:12:16.140]  Let's go to your phone calls
[1:12:16.140 --> 1:12:18.140]  Dave in Kansas
[1:12:18.140 --> 1:12:21.140]  Dave, you're on the air, welcome
[1:12:21.140 --> 1:12:22.140]  Hey, Alex
[1:12:22.140 --> 1:12:24.140]  Hey, buddy
[1:12:24.140 --> 1:12:26.140]  Hey, yeah, I got an idea
[1:12:26.140 --> 1:12:30.140]  For how we can start to take apart this police state
[1:12:30.140 --> 1:12:33.140]  And all these provocateur tactics
[1:12:33.140 --> 1:12:35.140]  Like they're doing at the G20
[1:12:35.140 --> 1:12:37.140]  Yeah, for those that don't understand
[1:12:37.140 --> 1:12:39.140]  A provocateur tactic, briefly
[1:12:39.140 --> 1:12:40.140]  You'll have peaceful demonstrators
[1:12:40.140 --> 1:12:41.140]  The cops will come out
[1:12:41.140 --> 1:12:43.140]  Either with hired thugs or themselves
[1:12:43.140 --> 1:12:44.140]  Dressed as anarchists
[1:12:44.140 --> 1:12:46.140]  Attack the police, burn a trash can
[1:12:46.140 --> 1:12:48.140]  So they can then attack the peaceful crowds
[1:12:48.140 --> 1:12:50.140]  And legitimize the announcements
[1:12:50.140 --> 1:12:53.140]  Of no protest or no congregating allowed
[1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:54.140]  In the city of Pittsburgh
[1:12:54.140 --> 1:12:57.140]  Or the surrounding suburbs of Oakland
[1:12:57.140 --> 1:12:59.140]  And we have those clips coming up later
[1:12:59.140 --> 1:13:00.140]  Where the police chief just says
[1:13:00.140 --> 1:13:01.140]  Yeah, you're not allowed to protest
[1:13:01.140 --> 1:13:02.140]  You're not allowed to be on the streets
[1:13:02.140 --> 1:13:05.140]  And so they do that to rationalize
[1:13:05.140 --> 1:13:07.140]  And sell their operations
[1:13:07.140 --> 1:13:10.140]  They commit false flag attacks
[1:13:10.140 --> 1:13:13.140]  Yeah, and this could even go deeper
[1:13:13.140 --> 1:13:15.140]  I mean, this could even include 9-11
[1:13:15.140 --> 1:13:16.140]  And other things
[1:13:16.140 --> 1:13:18.140]  But it's gonna take the help
[1:13:18.140 --> 1:13:21.140]  Of some of the wealthy listeners out there
[1:13:21.140 --> 1:13:23.140]  Who know who they are, I guess
[1:13:23.140 --> 1:13:26.140]  But how about some people with some money
[1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:31.140]  Set up a program of cash rewards
[1:13:31.140 --> 1:13:35.140]  For anybody in law enforcement or military
[1:13:35.140 --> 1:13:38.140]  If they'll come forward and sign an affidavit
[1:13:38.140 --> 1:13:41.140]  That they committed a crime
[1:13:41.140 --> 1:13:44.140]  On the orders of the superiors
[1:13:44.140 --> 1:13:45.140]  They'll get cash rewards
[1:13:45.140 --> 1:13:47.140]  I don't think with the laws
[1:13:47.140 --> 1:13:49.140]  That you can give cash rewards
[1:13:49.140 --> 1:13:52.140]  To people to come to anything
[1:13:52.140 --> 1:13:54.140]  But a grand jury or jury
[1:13:54.140 --> 1:13:56.140]  Those have to be set up under state laws
[1:13:56.140 --> 1:13:59.140]  And that would just be a labyrinth of operatives
[1:13:59.140 --> 1:14:02.140]  And disinfo and honeypots and set ups
[1:14:02.140 --> 1:14:04.140]  And people trying to feed you disinfo
[1:14:04.140 --> 1:14:07.140]  And burn you
[1:14:07.140 --> 1:14:09.140]  I mean, they would have to
[1:14:09.140 --> 1:14:12.140]  They would have to be a member
[1:14:12.140 --> 1:14:14.140]  Of law enforcement or military
[1:14:14.140 --> 1:14:16.140]  And they would sign an affidavit
[1:14:16.140 --> 1:14:20.140]  Saying that they had personally committed a crime
[1:14:20.140 --> 1:14:22.140]  On the orders of one of their superiors
[1:14:22.140 --> 1:14:24.140]  Yeah, the media would say
[1:14:24.140 --> 1:14:26.140]  They were being paid to lie
[1:14:26.140 --> 1:14:28.140]  Which is what they do, pay informants to do
[1:14:28.140 --> 1:14:30.140]  How about the police and military come out
[1:14:30.140 --> 1:14:32.140]  Because of their oath and tell the truth
[1:14:32.140 --> 1:14:36.140]  About how they were ordered to tell lies
[1:14:36.140 --> 1:14:39.140]  That would be good too, I guess
[1:14:39.140 --> 1:14:41.140]  I just don't see
[1:14:41.140 --> 1:14:43.140]  We just gotta do something about this
[1:14:43.140 --> 1:14:45.140]  Because nothing gets done
[1:14:45.140 --> 1:14:48.140]  In a way with these tactics over and over again
[1:14:48.140 --> 1:14:50.140]  Dave, I hear you
[1:14:50.140 --> 1:14:52.140]  But it came out in Denver
[1:14:52.140 --> 1:14:54.140]  That the police attacked the police
[1:14:54.140 --> 1:14:56.140]  In the Denver Post and the police admitted it
[1:14:56.140 --> 1:14:58.140]  And nobody got in trouble
[1:14:58.140 --> 1:15:00.140]  That's one point, one case of many
[1:15:00.140 --> 1:15:02.140]  One example of many
[1:15:02.140 --> 1:15:04.140]  We need people in Denver to go to the city council
[1:15:04.140 --> 1:15:07.140]  To go to the grand juries, state and federal grand juries
[1:15:07.140 --> 1:15:09.140]  And call for indictments for that
[1:15:09.140 --> 1:15:11.140]  In Canada last year
[1:15:11.140 --> 1:15:13.140]  They got caught staging attacks on police
[1:15:13.140 --> 1:15:15.140]  Major papers admitted it, the royal amount of police
[1:15:15.140 --> 1:15:18.140]  Admitted they did it, no one got in trouble
[1:15:18.140 --> 1:15:21.140]  In the G20, the last meeting
[1:15:21.140 --> 1:15:23.140]  Five, six months ago, what was it, five or six months ago
[1:15:23.140 --> 1:15:25.140]  In England, in London
[1:15:25.140 --> 1:15:29.140]  The police got caught
[1:15:29.140 --> 1:15:31.140]  Beating a man to death delivering newspapers
[1:15:31.140 --> 1:15:32.140]  And then covered that up
[1:15:32.140 --> 1:15:34.140]  And were caught provocaturing
[1:15:34.140 --> 1:15:35.140]  No one got in trouble
[1:15:35.140 --> 1:15:37.140]  In Greece earlier this year
[1:15:37.140 --> 1:15:39.140]  The police got caught on national TV
[1:15:39.140 --> 1:15:42.140]  Attacking storefronts to blame it on the protesters
[1:15:42.140 --> 1:15:44.140]  No one got in trouble
[1:15:44.140 --> 1:15:46.140]  So take 9-11
[1:15:46.140 --> 1:15:48.140]  We have Sybil Edmonds, FBI translator
[1:15:48.140 --> 1:15:50.140]  Saying bin Laden was taking orders
[1:15:50.140 --> 1:15:52.140]  Until 9-11 from the CIA
[1:15:52.140 --> 1:15:54.140]  They gagger, they shut it down
[1:15:54.140 --> 1:15:55.140]  The media won't cover it
[1:15:55.140 --> 1:15:57.140]  Though a few major magazines and newspapers have covered it
[1:15:57.140 --> 1:15:59.140]  But still it's a tiny amount of coverage
[1:15:59.140 --> 1:16:02.140]  AP is reporting that Jesse Trenadu
[1:16:02.140 --> 1:16:04.140]  Who we're going to get on this week
[1:16:04.140 --> 1:16:07.140]  Like that somewhere here in my stack
[1:16:07.140 --> 1:16:10.140]  That
[1:16:10.140 --> 1:16:12.140]  Reprint that for me, guys, I remember finding it in my stacks
[1:16:12.140 --> 1:16:14.140]  I cleaned the desktop this morning and still can't find it
[1:16:14.140 --> 1:16:18.140]  That they've edited the FBI tapes that he got
[1:16:18.140 --> 1:16:20.140]  And he also got FBI documents
[1:16:20.140 --> 1:16:22.140]  That they were surveilling Elohim City
[1:16:22.140 --> 1:16:24.140]  Run by the Southern Primary Law Center
[1:16:24.140 --> 1:16:27.140]  Who, by the way, is targeting us viciously right now
[1:16:27.140 --> 1:16:30.140]  There's evidence they've got black ops going against us in Austin
[1:16:30.140 --> 1:16:34.140]  And that they were in control of it
[1:16:34.140 --> 1:16:37.140]  I mean, we have all the evidence here
[1:16:37.140 --> 1:16:39.140]  We have the information
[1:16:39.140 --> 1:16:41.140]  And I'm not poo-pooing your point
[1:16:41.140 --> 1:16:44.140]  It's just that
[1:16:44.140 --> 1:16:46.140]  People say, oh, wealthy listeners
[1:16:46.140 --> 1:16:48.140]  The globalists have all the money in the world
[1:16:48.140 --> 1:16:49.140]  And the power
[1:16:49.140 --> 1:16:51.140]  And they can barely carry out their operation
[1:16:51.140 --> 1:16:53.140]  I mean, sure, it would make things easier for us
[1:16:53.140 --> 1:16:55.140]  If we had $10 million or a billion bucks or something
[1:16:55.140 --> 1:16:57.140]  But I wouldn't even know how to spend that money
[1:16:57.140 --> 1:16:59.140]  And what to do with it
[1:16:59.140 --> 1:17:01.140]  Because it's one thing to have money
[1:17:01.140 --> 1:17:03.140]  It's another thing to implement a plan
[1:17:03.140 --> 1:17:05.140]  Our plan is to get the truth out
[1:17:05.140 --> 1:17:06.140]  And try to get the people active
[1:17:06.140 --> 1:17:08.140]  And to get out there on the street and to take action
[1:17:08.140 --> 1:17:13.140]  My plan is to try to get more good riders in-house
[1:17:13.140 --> 1:17:14.140]  That we can trust
[1:17:14.140 --> 1:17:16.140]  But we are isolated in that
[1:17:16.140 --> 1:17:18.140]  We have had people try to infiltrate us
[1:17:18.140 --> 1:17:19.140]  And bring us down from within
[1:17:19.140 --> 1:17:20.140]  I mean, this isn't a game, folks
[1:17:20.140 --> 1:17:23.140]  We're on the White House Top 25 Enemies list
[1:17:23.140 --> 1:17:25.140]  I mean, this isn't a game I'm playing every day
[1:17:25.140 --> 1:17:27.140]  I try to explain this to people
[1:17:27.140 --> 1:17:32.140]  And by the grace of God, I'm still alive
[1:17:32.140 --> 1:17:34.140]  They also don't want to kill me or set me up
[1:17:34.140 --> 1:17:37.140]  Because they don't want to underline and highlight
[1:17:37.140 --> 1:17:40.140]  That I'm telling the truth and I'm the real deal
[1:17:40.140 --> 1:17:42.140]  And then I'm a true leader and involved here
[1:17:42.140 --> 1:17:44.140]  Trying to energize the people
[1:17:44.140 --> 1:17:46.140]  If they kill me or set me up, that will underline
[1:17:46.140 --> 1:17:49.140]  And highlight everything I've said and done
[1:17:49.140 --> 1:17:51.140]  But they're entering a phase now
[1:17:51.140 --> 1:17:52.140]  And I've told people this
[1:17:52.140 --> 1:17:53.140]  I could clearly see it with what's happening
[1:17:53.140 --> 1:17:56.140]  Around my office and other things in my life
[1:17:56.140 --> 1:17:58.140]  That they may just say to hell with that
[1:17:58.140 --> 1:18:01.140]  And go ahead and blow the hell out of me
[1:18:01.140 --> 1:18:03.140]  And I've got to steal myself
[1:18:03.140 --> 1:18:06.140]  I've got to get my spine up
[1:18:06.140 --> 1:18:10.140]  Get in position and take my licks
[1:18:10.140 --> 1:18:12.140]  I ask for this and this is what I want
[1:18:12.140 --> 1:18:14.140]  And this is who I am
[1:18:14.140 --> 1:18:16.140]  And the chips fall where they may
[1:18:16.140 --> 1:18:18.140]  I pass the point of no return a long time ago
[1:18:18.140 --> 1:18:20.140]  Ladies and gentlemen
[1:18:20.140 --> 1:18:23.140]  And it is a distinct pleasure to know I'm on the side of good
[1:18:23.140 --> 1:18:26.140]  It's a distinct satisfaction to know I'm not a coward
[1:18:26.140 --> 1:18:30.140]  I haven't disgraced my family name
[1:18:30.140 --> 1:18:32.140]  But I don't have all the answers
[1:18:32.140 --> 1:18:34.140]  You out there collectively do
[1:18:34.140 --> 1:18:36.140]  And it's about getting involved
[1:18:36.140 --> 1:18:38.140]  And not letting the feds take over your local communities
[1:18:38.140 --> 1:18:41.140]  So you want to see the solution
[1:18:41.140 --> 1:18:44.140]  It's like V for Vendetta, look in the mirror
[1:18:44.140 --> 1:18:46.140]  We ought to pull up on YouTube that V speech
[1:18:46.140 --> 1:18:48.140]  When he goes, I know why you did it
[1:18:48.140 --> 1:18:52.140]  You were afraid, so you gave these men control
[1:18:52.140 --> 1:18:53.140]  If you want to know who's really to blame
[1:18:53.140 --> 1:18:56.140]  All you have to do is look in the mirror
[1:18:56.140 --> 1:18:59.140]  And that is all of us collectively
[1:18:59.140 --> 1:19:01.140]  But they can kill me or set me up
[1:19:01.140 --> 1:19:03.140]  Or demonize me or destroy me
[1:19:03.140 --> 1:19:05.140]  Or make lies about me or pull me over
[1:19:05.140 --> 1:19:07.140]  And throw drugs in my car, whatever they do
[1:19:07.140 --> 1:19:09.140]  They got a playbook, I don't know what play they're going to run
[1:19:09.140 --> 1:19:11.140]  But I know they've already run a lot of plays against me
[1:19:11.140 --> 1:19:14.140]  But because we're so clean and so, you know
[1:19:14.140 --> 1:19:16.140]  Paying all the taxes, doing everything right
[1:19:16.140 --> 1:19:18.140]  Worst thing I do is speed sometimes
[1:19:18.140 --> 1:19:20.140]  And I'm late getting to work
[1:19:20.140 --> 1:19:22.140]  Got a little bit of a lead foot there
[1:19:22.140 --> 1:19:25.140]  But, you know, if they crush me or destroy me
[1:19:25.140 --> 1:19:28.140]  I was a good person, I'm not perfect
[1:19:28.140 --> 1:19:30.140]  But I did this righteously
[1:19:30.140 --> 1:19:33.140]  And somebody had to stand up for the innocence
[1:19:33.140 --> 1:19:35.140]  And corruption had to be dealt with
[1:19:35.140 --> 1:19:38.140]  I'm going to take more calls from Sherry, Jonathan, Barbara
[1:19:38.140 --> 1:19:39.140]  Ken and others
[1:19:39.140 --> 1:19:42.140]  When we get back on the other side of this quick break
[1:19:42.140 --> 1:19:44.140]  And then we've got the vaccine news
[1:19:44.140 --> 1:19:45.140]  We've got the police state news
[1:19:45.140 --> 1:19:46.140]  We've got the world government news
[1:19:46.140 --> 1:19:48.140]  We've got the Steve Quayle joining us
[1:19:48.140 --> 1:19:49.140]  We've got the flu information
[1:19:49.140 --> 1:19:51.140]  We've got the Gardasil information
[1:19:51.140 --> 1:19:54.140]  We've got an absolute overload of information
[1:19:54.140 --> 1:19:56.140]  But your call is straight ahead on the other side of this break
[1:19:56.140 --> 1:20:01.140]  infowars.com is the website, stay with us

[1:22:04.140 --> 1:22:07.140]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[1:22:07.140 --> 1:22:09.140]  We've got to give them a stake
[1:22:09.140 --> 1:22:11.140]  In creating the kind of world order
[1:22:11.140 --> 1:22:13.140]  That I think all of us would like to see
[1:22:13.140 --> 1:22:16.140]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[1:22:16.140 --> 1:22:19.140]  That Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[1:22:19.140 --> 1:22:21.140]  Well, Obama's already fudging
[1:22:21.140 --> 1:22:24.140]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election
[1:22:24.140 --> 1:22:27.140]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[1:22:27.140 --> 1:22:30.140]  Of personality cultists who is imposing the program
[1:22:30.140 --> 1:22:34.140]  Of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[1:22:34.140 --> 1:22:36.140]  That's fascism
[1:22:37.140 --> 1:22:39.140]  It's not about left or right
[1:22:39.140 --> 1:22:41.140]  It's about a one-world government
[1:22:41.140 --> 1:22:44.140]  This film documents who Obama works for
[1:22:44.140 --> 1:22:46.140]  The eyes he is told

[1:24:04.140 --> 1:24:07.140]  We're not in Kansas anymore, ladies and gentlemen
[1:24:10.140 --> 1:24:12.140]  Key information with Steve Cuell coming up
[1:24:12.140 --> 1:24:14.140]  Let's go to your calls right now
[1:24:14.140 --> 1:24:17.140]  Welcome to our lives inside the New World Order

[1:24:19.140 --> 1:24:23.140]  Now we march deeper into the breach
[1:24:23.140 --> 1:24:26.140]  Into the valley went the 5,000
[1:24:28.140 --> 1:24:30.140]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[1:24:30.140 --> 1:24:32.140]  Sherri in Georgia
[1:24:32.140 --> 1:24:34.140]  Sherri, you're on the air
[1:24:34.140 --> 1:24:36.140]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[1:24:36.140 --> 1:24:38.140]  Good, welcome
[1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:41.140]  With the anti-fed revolution
[1:24:41.140 --> 1:24:43.140]  And it's Carrie, by the way
[1:24:43.140 --> 1:24:45.140]  I'm sorry, it's a Sherri, a Carrie, okay
[1:24:45.140 --> 1:24:47.140]  That's okay
[1:24:47.140 --> 1:24:50.140]  With the anti-fed revolution
[1:24:50.140 --> 1:24:52.140]  Picking up speed right now
[1:24:54.140 --> 1:24:56.140]  What is your personal view
[1:24:56.140 --> 1:24:59.140]  Or your personal opinion on, you know
[1:24:59.140 --> 1:25:01.140]  We've had the unusual activity of the fed
[1:25:01.140 --> 1:25:04.140]  Now admitting they've hidden gold swap arrangements
[1:25:04.140 --> 1:25:05.140]  And things like that
[1:25:05.140 --> 1:25:09.140]  This push for this anti-fed revolution
[1:25:09.140 --> 1:25:10.140]  On the flip side of that
[1:25:10.140 --> 1:25:13.140]  How do we know who should be in charge after control has
[1:25:13.140 --> 1:25:16.140]  Or maybe would be regained
[1:25:16.140 --> 1:25:18.140]  So to speak
[1:25:18.140 --> 1:25:21.140]  Well, A, I'm facing a battle at hand
[1:25:21.140 --> 1:25:24.140]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall
[1:25:24.140 --> 1:25:27.140]  As a great philosopher once said
[1:25:27.140 --> 1:25:31.140]  I'm calculating every possible
[1:25:31.140 --> 1:25:33.140]  Destination of their trajectory
[1:25:33.140 --> 1:25:35.140]  On how they're going to counter us
[1:25:35.140 --> 1:25:36.140]  Auditing the Fed
[1:25:36.140 --> 1:25:37.140]  And an audit, as the Fed has said
[1:25:37.140 --> 1:25:39.140]  Will destroy them because they're so criminal
[1:25:39.140 --> 1:25:41.140]  And engage in so much insider trading
[1:25:41.140 --> 1:25:43.140]  And giving themselves trillions of dollars
[1:25:43.140 --> 1:25:45.140]  It's a consortium of private banks
[1:25:45.140 --> 1:25:46.140]  And masquerading as government
[1:25:46.140 --> 1:25:48.140]  Now we've unmasked them as private
[1:25:48.140 --> 1:25:50.140]  And in national polls
[1:25:50.140 --> 1:25:52.140]  The majority of the American people over 75%
[1:25:52.140 --> 1:25:53.140]  Want to audit it
[1:25:53.140 --> 1:25:54.140]  Or abolish it
[1:25:54.140 --> 1:25:55.140]  They now know it's private
[1:25:55.140 --> 1:25:56.140]  We've had that great victory
[1:25:56.140 --> 1:25:58.140]  Now we've identified the real government
[1:25:58.140 --> 1:26:00.140]  The illegitimate shadow government
[1:26:00.140 --> 1:26:03.140]  Ron Paul has a plan to monetize it
[1:26:03.140 --> 1:26:04.140]  And phase it out
[1:26:04.140 --> 1:26:06.140]  And write off the derivatives
[1:26:06.140 --> 1:26:07.140]  With a partially go back system
[1:26:07.140 --> 1:26:08.140]  After we've done that
[1:26:08.140 --> 1:26:11.140]  Other people have a purely fiat system
[1:26:11.140 --> 1:26:13.140]  Different variants of that
[1:26:13.140 --> 1:26:15.140]  We need to have a national debate
[1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.140]  And education about fiat currency
[1:26:17.140 --> 1:26:19.140]  And fractional reserve banking
[1:26:19.140 --> 1:26:21.140]  And then get the power of the purse
[1:26:21.140 --> 1:26:23.140]  Nationalized under the Constitution
[1:26:23.140 --> 1:26:24.140]  As it's supposed to be
[1:26:24.140 --> 1:26:25.140]  Just follow the Constitution
[1:26:25.140 --> 1:26:27.140]  People keep bashing our system of government
[1:26:27.140 --> 1:26:29.140]  We don't follow our system of government
[1:26:29.140 --> 1:26:31.140]  For a good 50 years completely
[1:26:31.140 --> 1:26:33.140]  In the last 100 they've been phasing it out
[1:26:33.140 --> 1:26:35.140]  But in the last 50 it's almost gone
[1:26:35.140 --> 1:26:36.140]  Since the mid-50s
[1:26:36.140 --> 1:26:39.140]  So we have to have a restoration
[1:26:39.140 --> 1:26:41.140]  Of what the Constitution says
[1:26:41.140 --> 1:26:42.140]  And we'll just do what it says
[1:26:42.140 --> 1:26:44.140]  And then Congress can decide
[1:26:44.140 --> 1:26:45.140]  How that's going to be done
[1:26:45.140 --> 1:26:47.140]  And we'll make sure it's not a private bank again
[1:26:47.140 --> 1:26:48.140]  That's doing it
[1:26:48.140 --> 1:26:50.140]  I mean we had Andrew Jackson fight it
[1:26:50.140 --> 1:26:51.140]  And beat it
[1:26:51.140 --> 1:26:52.140]  We had other presidents fight it
[1:26:52.140 --> 1:26:53.140]  And beat it
[1:26:53.140 --> 1:26:54.140]  Lincoln had fights with them
[1:26:54.140 --> 1:26:55.140]  He issued his own US currency
[1:26:55.140 --> 1:26:56.140]  They killed him over it
[1:26:56.140 --> 1:26:57.140]  That's on record
[1:26:57.140 --> 1:26:59.140]  So this is the big issue
[1:26:59.140 --> 1:27:01.140]  This has always been the biggest issue
[1:27:01.140 --> 1:27:02.140]  Because if you let these private banks
[1:27:02.140 --> 1:27:04.140]  Issue imaginary currency and credit
[1:27:04.140 --> 1:27:05.140]  And debt
[1:27:05.140 --> 1:27:07.140]  We will wake up homeless
[1:27:07.140 --> 1:27:08.140]  On the continent our forebearers
[1:27:08.140 --> 1:27:09.140]  Conquered overnight
[1:27:09.140 --> 1:27:10.140]  Within a generation
[1:27:10.140 --> 1:27:12.140]  As Thomas Jefferson said
[1:27:12.140 --> 1:27:13.140]  I'm paraphrasing his quote
[1:27:13.140 --> 1:27:15.140]  So audit the Fed
[1:27:15.140 --> 1:27:16.140]  First things first
[1:27:16.140 --> 1:27:18.140]  Nationalize it
[1:27:18.140 --> 1:27:20.140]  And then we can have a specific debate
[1:27:20.140 --> 1:27:21.140]  About the legislation
[1:27:21.140 --> 1:27:23.140]  And what Congress does
[1:27:23.140 --> 1:27:25.140]  With that new system
[1:27:25.140 --> 1:27:27.140]  I just, you know, fear
[1:27:27.140 --> 1:27:29.140]  You know, just like anybody else
[1:27:29.140 --> 1:27:30.140]  This anti-fed revolution
[1:27:30.140 --> 1:27:32.140]  Turning into an excuse for
[1:27:32.140 --> 1:27:34.140]  People who are already in office
[1:27:34.140 --> 1:27:36.140]  To push for global currency
[1:27:36.140 --> 1:27:38.140]  Yeah, global currency
[1:27:38.140 --> 1:27:40.140]  Man, I appreciate your call
[1:27:40.140 --> 1:27:43.140]  That is the Federal Reserve's talking point
[1:27:43.140 --> 1:27:45.140]  The Federal Reserve hired
[1:27:45.140 --> 1:27:46.140]  The Enron lobbyist
[1:27:46.140 --> 1:27:47.140]  The biggest lobbying firm
[1:27:47.140 --> 1:27:49.140]  That handles all the big corruption cases
[1:27:49.140 --> 1:27:51.140]  To run their PR
[1:27:51.140 --> 1:27:52.140]  And they've said
[1:27:52.140 --> 1:27:53.140]  The economy will implode
[1:27:53.140 --> 1:27:55.140]  We'll have martial law
[1:27:55.140 --> 1:27:57.140]  The banks will pull the rug out from under
[1:27:57.140 --> 1:27:58.140]  So we don't submit to them
[1:27:58.140 --> 1:28:00.140]  It's like
[1:28:00.140 --> 1:28:02.140]  Professor Black in Fall of the Republic
[1:28:02.140 --> 1:28:03.140]  Talks about
[1:28:03.140 --> 1:28:05.140]  It's like in Blazing Saddles
[1:28:05.140 --> 1:28:06.140]  Where the sheriff's surrounded
[1:28:06.140 --> 1:28:07.140]  And he says
[1:28:07.140 --> 1:28:09.140]  Their guns are all shoot myself
[1:28:09.140 --> 1:28:11.140]  That's what they're doing
[1:28:11.140 --> 1:28:12.140]  And they've also put out
[1:28:12.140 --> 1:28:13.140]  Through our own ranks
[1:28:13.140 --> 1:28:14.140]  They just want to get rid of the Fed
[1:28:14.140 --> 1:28:16.140]  To have a new world government
[1:28:16.140 --> 1:28:17.140]  They just want a global currency
[1:28:17.140 --> 1:28:18.140]  If we get rid of it
[1:28:18.140 --> 1:28:19.140]  We'll have a world government
[1:28:19.140 --> 1:28:21.140]  We already have a bank of the world
[1:28:21.140 --> 1:28:23.140]  We already have a world government
[1:28:23.140 --> 1:28:25.140]  They have SDRs
[1:28:25.140 --> 1:28:27.140]  And other digital currencies
[1:28:27.140 --> 1:28:29.140]  Being traded between the private
[1:28:29.140 --> 1:28:30.140]  Central banks
[1:28:30.140 --> 1:28:32.140]  They've already gone to digital money
[1:28:32.140 --> 1:28:34.140]  They're going to have regionalized currencies
[1:28:34.140 --> 1:28:36.140]  They're already announcing it
[1:28:36.140 --> 1:28:38.140]  That are units that are controlled by that body
[1:28:38.140 --> 1:28:40.140]  That's what the G20's meeting for
[1:28:40.140 --> 1:28:41.140]  It's already here
[1:28:41.140 --> 1:28:43.140]  So we have to save our currency
[1:28:43.140 --> 1:28:44.140]  Save the dollar
[1:28:44.140 --> 1:28:45.140]  Fix it
[1:28:45.140 --> 1:28:47.140]  And get out of the IMF and World Bank
[1:28:47.140 --> 1:28:49.140]  And arrest these bankers
[1:28:49.140 --> 1:28:51.140]  But again, the bankers know
[1:28:51.140 --> 1:28:53.140]  That they're fully discredited
[1:28:53.140 --> 1:28:55.140]  So they only pose as patriots
[1:28:55.140 --> 1:28:58.140]  To discredit myself, Ron Paul
[1:28:58.140 --> 1:29:00.140]  And anybody else that sticks their head up
[1:29:00.140 --> 1:29:02.140]  To try to warn the people about the real system
[1:29:02.140 --> 1:29:03.140]  And say
[1:29:03.140 --> 1:29:05.140]  They want to get rid of the Federal Reserve
[1:29:05.140 --> 1:29:07.140]  So we can have a world government
[1:29:07.140 --> 1:29:09.140]  The Federal Reserve
[1:29:09.140 --> 1:29:11.140]  Is the regional private consortium
[1:29:11.140 --> 1:29:13.140]  Governorship of the
[1:29:13.140 --> 1:29:16.140]  International Banking Cartel on record
[1:29:17.140 --> 1:29:19.140]  We already have a global government
[1:29:19.140 --> 1:29:21.140]  That's what the carbon tax is
[1:29:21.140 --> 1:29:23.140]  That's what the Tobin tax is
[1:29:23.140 --> 1:29:25.140]  That's what all these announcements are for
[1:29:25.140 --> 1:29:27.140]  And more money to the IMF and World Bank
[1:29:27.140 --> 1:29:29.140]  We're in a world government
[1:29:29.140 --> 1:29:31.140]  We're in the new world order
[1:29:31.140 --> 1:29:34.140]  They already have us under a global currency
[1:29:34.140 --> 1:29:36.140]  It's bank to bank
[1:29:36.140 --> 1:29:37.140]  Okay?
[1:29:37.140 --> 1:29:39.140]  They plan on killing the dollar
[1:29:39.140 --> 1:29:41.140]  To bring in the new world currency
[1:29:41.140 --> 1:29:42.140]  Completely
[1:29:42.140 --> 1:29:44.140]  Instead, we gotta save the dollar
[1:29:44.140 --> 1:29:46.140]  And defeat the bankers
[1:29:46.140 --> 1:29:47.140]  It's very simple
[1:29:47.140 --> 1:29:49.140]  That you're buying their disinfo black off
[1:29:51.140 --> 1:29:52.140]  We're on the march
[1:29:52.140 --> 1:29:54.140]  The Empire's on the run
[1:29:55.140 --> 1:29:58.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:30:01.140 --> 1:30:02.140]  Hello, this is Alex Jones
[1:30:02.140 --> 1:30:03.140]  With some important questions
[1:30:03.140 --> 1:30:05.140]  If you're going into a battle
[1:30:05.140 --> 1:30:07.140]  And they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[1:30:07.140 --> 1:30:09.140]  How much ammunition do you want?
[1:30:09.140 --> 1:30:11.140]  My answer would be all I can get
[1:30:11.140 --> 1:30:12.140]  In the battle for freedom
[1:30:12.140 --> 1:30:14.140]  And the lives of your loved ones
[1:30:14.140 --> 1:30:16.140]  Food is your only ammunition
[1:30:16.140 --> 1:30:17.140]  How much do you want?
[1:30:17.140 --> 1:30:18.140]  When do you want it?
[1:30:18.140 --> 1:30:20.140]  Now or after the battle starts
[1:30:20.140 --> 1:30:21.140]  When will you need it?
[1:30:21.140 --> 1:30:23.140]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:30:23.140 --> 1:30:25.140]  Will there be any food?
[1:30:25.140 --> 1:30:26.140]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:30:26.140 --> 1:30:27.140]  If there's a quarantine
[1:30:27.140 --> 1:30:29.140]  And you can't feed yourself
[1:30:29.140 --> 1:30:30.140]  Will you go to the gathering center
[1:30:30.140 --> 1:30:31.140]  And be immunized?
[1:30:31.140 --> 1:30:33.140]  You wipe out all these problems
[1:30:33.140 --> 1:30:35.140]  If you have a good food supply
[1:30:35.140 --> 1:30:36.140]  Food is your ammunition
[1:30:36.140 --> 1:30:39.140]  To fight for your freedom and your life
[1:30:39.140 --> 1:30:40.140]  How much will you need?
[1:30:40.140 --> 1:30:41.140]  We don't know
[1:30:41.140 --> 1:30:42.140]  How much do you want?
[1:30:42.140 --> 1:30:43.140]  All you can get
[1:30:43.140 --> 1:30:44.140]  I'm Alex Jones
[1:30:44.140 --> 1:30:45.140]  I want all of you good guys

[1:30:59.140 --> 1:31:02.140]  The illusion created by the power elite
[1:31:02.140 --> 1:31:03.140]  Is a lie
[1:31:03.140 --> 1:31:05.140]  That covers even the food they want you to eat
[1:31:05.140 --> 1:31:07.140]  Will you continue to be their profit center
[1:31:07.140 --> 1:31:09.140]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick
[1:31:09.140 --> 1:31:11.140]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?

[1:33:16.140 --> 1:33:18.140]  We're going back to your phone calls
[1:33:18.140 --> 1:33:21.140]  We've got Paul Watson about to come on
[1:33:21.140 --> 1:33:24.140]  Because I want to on air give him the different points
[1:33:24.140 --> 1:33:28.140]  I'd like him to incorporate into an article about us being on the enemies list
[1:33:28.140 --> 1:33:31.140]  Watson is my most trusted apprentice
[1:33:31.140 --> 1:33:34.140]  Who's off-site and we got Aaron also doing a great job
[1:33:34.140 --> 1:33:37.140]  Everybody here just does a wonderful job
[1:33:37.140 --> 1:33:40.140]  But Paul, so many times I call him on a political issue
[1:33:40.140 --> 1:33:43.140]  And I say what's your take on this and it's exactly my take
[1:33:43.140 --> 1:33:45.140]  Not because he follows what I say
[1:33:45.140 --> 1:33:48.140]  Because he has the same understanding of the nexus points
[1:33:48.140 --> 1:33:50.140]  That's why he is so precious to us
[1:33:50.140 --> 1:33:54.140]  PaulWatsonandprisonplanet.com
[1:33:54.140 --> 1:33:58.140]  I want to go to Paul here in just a moment
[1:33:58.140 --> 1:34:01.140]  But I want to say something about Fall of the Republic
[1:34:01.140 --> 1:34:09.140]  We were about to release the Obama deception in four days
[1:34:09.140 --> 1:34:12.140]  And the FBI showed up here
[1:34:12.140 --> 1:34:15.140]  Then they started calling people randomly around the office
[1:34:15.140 --> 1:34:19.140]  Asking about my film and asking about my studios
[1:34:19.140 --> 1:34:23.140]  And we were saying, and we've been given a federal subpoena
[1:34:23.140 --> 1:34:26.140]  And the subpoena said, don't talk about this case while the investigation is open
[1:34:26.140 --> 1:34:28.140]  About somebody on the message board
[1:34:28.140 --> 1:34:31.140]  And I said to the FBI, I said, I'm going to have to have you talk to my lawyers
[1:34:31.140 --> 1:34:34.140]  I said, what does my film have to do with this?
[1:34:34.140 --> 1:34:38.140]  And they started making inquiries about our servers here at this office and off-site
[1:34:38.140 --> 1:34:42.140]  And wanting to know where our servers were located, separately from the investigation
[1:34:42.140 --> 1:34:47.140]  And then I got some death threats over the film
[1:34:47.140 --> 1:34:52.140]  And then I got followed a couple of times, driving home late at night
[1:34:52.140 --> 1:34:56.140]  Cars getting up on my tail, coming up, threateningly
[1:34:56.140 --> 1:34:59.140]  And I said, well, I'm really getting a message here
[1:34:59.140 --> 1:35:01.140]  And of course, I guess they hadn't looked at my file
[1:35:01.140 --> 1:35:04.140]  When you come at me and try to attack me and intimidate me
[1:35:04.140 --> 1:35:07.140]  It suddenly gives me giant reservoirs of energy
[1:35:07.140 --> 1:35:13.140]  And so I released the Obama Deception three days early
[1:35:13.140 --> 1:35:15.140]  And it's the most viral film I've ever released
[1:35:15.140 --> 1:35:17.140]  One of the most viral films in Internet history
[1:35:17.140 --> 1:35:20.140]  More than 20 million views that we know of that we've been able to count
[1:35:20.140 --> 1:35:25.140]  You can order the DVD to have it in your library at infowars.com
[1:35:25.140 --> 1:35:28.140]  Now, it's come out in major publications
[1:35:28.140 --> 1:35:33.140]  And it came out a few weeks ago that the White House is compiling lists of people
[1:35:33.140 --> 1:35:39.140]  Attacking them on the Internet, asking White House supporters to spy on their neighbors
[1:35:39.140 --> 1:35:42.140]  To make reports on their neighbors, anything, quote, fishy
[1:35:42.140 --> 1:35:45.140]  Anyone criticizing Obama, it's now confirmed
[1:35:45.140 --> 1:35:48.140]  He wanted to give a speech to the kids and enlist them to serve him
[1:35:48.140 --> 1:35:52.140]  Now we see the curriculum singing, replacing Jesus' name with his name
[1:35:52.140 --> 1:35:55.140]  Jesus loves all the little children, red, yellow, black, and white
[1:35:55.140 --> 1:35:57.140]  They are all equal in his sight
[1:35:57.140 --> 1:36:01.140]  Obama, President Obama loves the children, they are all equal in his sight
[1:36:01.140 --> 1:36:03.140]  You know, red, yellow, black, and white
[1:36:03.140 --> 1:36:08.140]  And now, so many videos have come in, I've seen, I didn't count them
[1:36:08.140 --> 1:36:11.140]  It's got to be more than 10 the last day, we'll try to play a couple today
[1:36:11.140 --> 1:36:14.140]  Who, I sent you those last night, you have them, send a couple I know
[1:36:14.140 --> 1:36:16.140]  I mean, just they get worse and worse by the minute
[1:36:16.140 --> 1:36:20.140]  I mean, they're really deploying troops, they're really setting up a police state
[1:36:20.140 --> 1:36:25.140]  They're really deploying mercenaries, he's really talking about 500,000 troops now in Afghanistan
[1:36:25.140 --> 1:36:30.140]  Not 50,000, he's really saying indefinite secret detention of citizens and foreigners
[1:36:30.140 --> 1:36:34.140]  I mean, it's really happening
[1:36:34.140 --> 1:36:40.140]  So that said, that's why we released the Obama Deception early
[1:36:40.140 --> 1:36:45.140]  I hope I don't have to release this film early because by putting it out with the trailers, by building up the momentum
[1:36:45.140 --> 1:36:51.140]  It will be seen by more people and have a bigger effect if I can launch it on October 21 on that Wednesday
[1:36:51.140 --> 1:36:54.140]  Coming up in about 22 days
[1:36:54.140 --> 1:37:01.140]  But, I've implemented a plan, it's now been uploaded remote sites ready
[1:37:01.140 --> 1:37:06.140]  That if I have to, I will pull the trigger any time to release this film
[1:37:06.140 --> 1:37:09.140]  If I have to
[1:37:09.140 --> 1:37:20.140]  I will tell you this though, I've gambled on this film, it's got close to twice the budget of any film I've made
[1:37:20.140 --> 1:37:25.140]  I sent 17 flights out with crews, sometimes two crews in two different places at the same time
[1:37:25.140 --> 1:37:32.140]  Went to Canada, California, Florida, New York, Washington, Ohio
[1:37:32.140 --> 1:37:36.140]  The list goes on and on to have these interviews in the film
[1:37:36.140 --> 1:37:41.140]  Fall of the Republic is a quantum level above the Obama Deception
[1:37:41.140 --> 1:37:47.140]  You want to understand the mind control, the police state, how the banks did it, what the new order is, what their master plan is

[1:38:08.140 --> 1:38:13.140]  We're not like George Soros that has banker bailout money and use it against the American people to quell free speech
[1:38:13.140 --> 1:38:20.140]  We're not like the government buying tens of billions of dollars in fake newscasts and product placement and messages and sitcoms and dramas
[1:38:20.140 --> 1:38:28.140]  We don't have that. We're a tiny ragtag band and we need you to fuel our weapons system in the info war
[1:38:28.140 --> 1:38:31.140]  And you do that when you buy the books and videos
[1:38:31.140 --> 1:38:36.140]  So pre-order, we've got discounts where you can get some of the other films at half off, or in one case 75% off

[1:39:02.140 --> 1:39:11.140]  To P.O.Box.19549, Austin, Texas 78760, P.O.Box.19549, Austin, Texas 78760
[1:39:11.140 --> 1:39:20.140]  And we're opening up our solar panels to the people to energize us so we can then build up another burst in the info war at the enemy
[1:39:20.140 --> 1:39:25.140]  And make no mistake, we're on the White House Enemies list of the 25 we're listed
[1:39:25.140 --> 1:39:28.140]  Alex Jones for the Obama deception
[1:39:28.140 --> 1:39:36.140]  Obama has called top bloggers, one guy that made the thing where he plays the part of Thomas Payne, he talks about the country
[1:39:36.140 --> 1:39:41.140]  That guy on the news got summoned to the White House, Obama summons bloggers and viral video makers
[1:39:41.140 --> 1:39:46.140]  And this guy's getting summoned for a million views, we're 20 million views at least for Obama deception
[1:39:46.140 --> 1:39:52.140]  You better believe they're aware of it and upset, and now that's proven, specifically from White House sources
[1:39:52.140 --> 1:39:56.140]  And then this was leaked, and this article was written to make it sound legitimate
[1:39:56.140 --> 1:40:05.140]  And I am on the list, and I want to bring Paul Watson up right now
[1:40:05.140 --> 1:40:12.140]  Paul, what is your view on us being on the enemies list now?
[1:40:12.140 --> 1:40:27.140]  Well, the thing about this, Alex, is the fact that Obama and Pelosi have an enemies list was reported weeks ago and in the case of Pelosi months ago
[1:40:27.140 --> 1:40:39.140]  In fact, the White House encouraged people to inform on Americans and niche on the biggest enemies to Obama's political agenda
[1:40:39.140 --> 1:40:42.140]  That was in US News and World Report
[1:40:42.140 --> 1:40:50.140]  And that was a form of enlisting the people to be spies, but also to create a focus group to find out who was getting snitched on the most
[1:40:50.140 --> 1:40:52.140]  I'm sorry, US News and World Report, go ahead
[1:40:52.140 --> 1:41:01.140]  Yeah, and then Politico and CBS News also reported in March that Pelosi also keeps the political enemies list
[1:41:01.140 --> 1:41:11.140]  And Politico also reported that Obama kept one also in March of this year, so it's widely acknowledged that these lists are kept
[1:41:11.140 --> 1:41:21.140]  You talked about Clinton keeping lists of his enemies earlier, of which Vint Foster was undoubtedly one, we know what happened to him
[1:41:21.140 --> 1:41:28.140]  But the thing about the globe is that people will just dismiss it as the Canadian version of the National Enquirer
[1:41:28.140 --> 1:41:35.140]  Which is fair enough, but the fact is, the fact that Obama's got an enemies list is widely reported by numerous
[1:41:35.140 --> 1:41:42.140]  Well, they're saying they got this from a White House source, we know they have enemies list
[1:41:42.140 --> 1:41:49.140]  And they specifically target us for the Obama deception and the coming up of the fall of the Republic
[1:41:49.140 --> 1:41:59.140]  And reading this, this reads exactly in line with how they operate and it says, Bill Clinton is running the list, he was the master of enemies list
[1:41:59.140 --> 1:42:05.140]  Yeah, I mean, that's well documented, I mean you talked about that for years
[1:42:05.140 --> 1:42:20.140]  So yeah, it's on the record that they keep these lists and it's no surprise that you'd be on it because the Obama deception blows wide open the left-right paradigm and how Obama is just another
[1:42:20.140 --> 1:42:30.140]  puppet for the international banking syndicate, the same one that controlled Bush and his policies since he was elected, have proven that to the end of the degree
[1:42:30.140 --> 1:42:37.140]  Did you know that I'm the only person on the list that isn't a fake right wing neocon?
[1:42:37.140 --> 1:42:45.140]  We're the only person, it's Limbaugh and Beck and all these other people, Michelle Malkin, we're ahead of her on the list
[1:42:45.140 --> 1:42:54.140]  Who only attack him from a glancing angle, we directly go to the fact that he lied about everything and as citizens, we have a right to do this
[1:42:54.140 --> 1:43:06.140]  That's why they've created these enemies list, that's why they told our cameramen, you're going to be put on a terror list and laughed at them in Pittsburgh when the police tried to set them up with the army
[1:43:06.140 --> 1:43:12.140]  Because this is the new America where we all go on lists and if we give into this chilling effect, it's over
[1:43:12.140 --> 1:43:28.140]  Well I mean this goes back to Bush when the White House had a policy that was later made public by Bush which was to treat quote conspiracy theories, to put out theories about 9-11 which don't agree with the official story
[1:43:28.140 --> 1:43:46.140]  As quote terrorist recruiters and that they should be attacked and maligned and we saw that happen imminently after so I mean then you've got the DHS document that lists alternative media or people who simply disagree with the official version of any given story
[1:43:46.140 --> 1:44:02.140]  To be potentially dangerous, potentially domestic terrorist so it stretches back further than Obama having a list, I mean it's what cops and Homeland Security agents are being told is the new enemy in America
[1:44:02.140 --> 1:44:18.140]  Well the globe is in England, it's in the US, it's in Canada, it is one of the biggest periodicals and it's one of the more serious ones, it doesn't do a lot of the space alien stuff, it's got Burt Reynolds dying, Swayze Widow's agony, rigged, it's got
[1:44:18.140 --> 1:44:34.140]  But the big cover story, this is the cover story right now is 25 enemies Obama wants to silence and this is you know it came out about John Edwards in this publication and the inquirer about his love child and all his lies there
[1:44:34.140 --> 1:44:54.140]  I have no doubt that this is an accurate report Obama's secret enemies list revealed 25 names of the president wants to silence and why and again I don't use drugs I hardly ever drink I kind of go six months without drinking and then spend a month drinking
[1:44:54.140 --> 1:45:14.140]  I'm not even that heavily I go off and on cigars pretty gross but chewing tobacco and cigarettes I like anything tobacco I speed I race around in my car sometimes I'm faithful to my wife I don't do anything criminal we overpay the phony taxes the
[1:45:14.140 --> 1:45:30.140]  fellow deserve I have outside accounting firms in here we try to keep our nose completely clean poll I don't want to give our enemies any attention but they're clearly pulling out all the stops against us with foundation money attacking us from the grassroots and the top and I just want listeners to know that's being done because we're effective
[1:45:30.140 --> 1:45:48.140]  Paul Watson yeah I don't mean with we've been attacked from the left most recently I mean that their attention from their memory is about as short as it you know it's so finite because we get attacked by people like think
[1:45:48.140 --> 1:46:06.140]  think progress for being right wing extremist went on their own website because they're owned by a different organization a larger organization says that their mission is pushed the political agenda of the Obama White House and then they accuse us of being party that
[1:46:06.140 --> 1:46:22.140]  so it's a tax like that they're so easily ridiculed but they come in from both sides so I mean this just goes to show that you know for eight years you railed against Bush and now we're again we're called right wing extremist
[1:46:22.140 --> 1:46:41.140]  well it's incredible to be a cover story in one of the biggest on the stand newsstand publications Obama's secret enemies list and we're on it very very creepy Watson I want to go back to calls but I wanted to make sure you were on the same page and you are show all the
[1:46:41.140 --> 1:46:55.140]  show all the admissions of his enemies list show how they want to get people titling on their neighbors the kids serving him how they're putting people on watch list how they want to put conservatives on no gun by list with no judge or jury
[1:46:55.140 --> 1:47:14.140]  there's a lot of other points I meant to make when I got you on the line but I've misplaced them mentally there but it'll come out of the file cabinet here in a second it's just that we are the subject of intimidation we are the subject of attacks we know this stuff is going on
[1:47:14.140 --> 1:47:21.140]  and it is very very creepy to have this going on anything else
[1:47:21.140 --> 1:47:37.140]  oh yeah again for people who will attack the credibility I mean these tabloid periodical sometimes break big story that is the reason why the National Inquirer got then anthrax after 911 it didn't happen by accident and we know where the anthrax led by
[1:47:37.140 --> 1:47:40.140]  they published the Bush daughters falling down drunk on 6th Street in Austin
[1:47:40.140 --> 1:47:49.140]  yeah and then you've got all the other admissions from CVS political US News and World Report that these enemies list the kept so that's documented
[1:47:49.140 --> 1:47:53.140]  well I hope I don't get anthrax in the mail
[1:47:53.140 --> 1:47:58.140]  well I won't put anything past them but hopefully not now
[1:47:58.140 --> 1:48:12.140]  it really I mean these are people that kill millions of third world innocence murder means nothing to them but the good news is this is out so if anything happens to us everybody knows who to look at first
[1:48:12.140 --> 1:48:31.140]  the Clintons who were openly running the Obama White House with the same crooked grip of bankers that engineered the banking changes that brought us to this point in the 1990s and fall the Republic covers this if the White House didn't like the Obama deception they are sure not going to like fall the Republic Watson
[1:48:31.140 --> 1:48:57.140]  well certainly not because I mean I'm getting a lot of emails from black people who voted for Obama and now because of the Obama deception and what we've done since completely awoken to the truth paradigm so we're reaching the target audience that we need to reach we're not preaching to the choir anymore we're going out and finding those people that need to be brought out of their sleep
[1:48:57.140 --> 1:49:05.140]  well let's be clear we were never preaching to the choir that's another false attack oh you're not you're not effective oh you're not reaching anybody
[1:49:05.140 --> 1:49:23.140]  we're always through our listeners been reaching more and more people but now we are growing exponentially and with great power spider-man says comes great responsibility and it is a very daunting task Watson I just want to point out I have my first amendment I have my rights
[1:49:23.140 --> 1:49:46.140]  coming after us is the type of thing that will bring these criminals down and I'm kind of proud to be on the list but I also don't like it I'd be able to be just as glad not to be on the list I would just I would tie it into the no fly list and the watch list and what they told our crew and how this is the total secret police system here in the
[1:49:46.140 --> 1:50:01.140]  United States and there needs to be a congressional investigation of these criminal activities because it's admitted Pelosi has enemies less she's admitted to that and these people are just outrageous and Clinton the bushes would kind of ignore you they were so arrogant they
[1:50:01.140 --> 1:50:17.140]  would just kill third world population stage terror attacks to get their operation going and are so arrogant they would I mean the head of the Bush family George Herbert Walker Bush's wife Barbara Bush said on Larry King live she said if you talk about my family or mess with my
[1:50:17.140 --> 1:50:29.140]  children I will kill you and King said what do you mean she said well I just said we'll kill you and the bushes are like mafia they have mafia rules they say you mess with our family that's why one time Kevin Booth and his wife's 40th birthday we're at a
[1:50:29.140 --> 1:50:47.140]  steakhouse and there are the Bush daughters drunk with these heavy meddlers he goes let me get the camera out of my car and I said dude don't sign your death warrant leave them alone let's mess with George W. Bush was right at 9 11 had federal marshals guarding them federal marshals came over so they were fans you know we're not messing with their families don't mess with
[1:50:47.140 --> 1:51:00.140]  their families the problem is the Clintons they don't have any rules they go after families kids they're just absolute scum hard to believe they're even worse than Bush but at least he has some mafia morals here we'll be right back thank you Watson get us a good report

[1:55:22.140 --> 1:55:33.140]  you're calling from Kansas but I would imagine you know about Tennessee and areas of Kentucky and Alabama and Texas and even upstate New York
[1:55:33.140 --> 1:55:40.140]  that if you go in there around those people's marijuana crops or their whiskey stills that's where it comes from that's where the culture comes from they will kill you
[1:55:40.140 --> 1:55:55.140]  I got out when I was going to Bohemian Grove one year 2003 to cover it I got out in the middle of nowhere to urinate up against a tree and about 200 yards away back in the woods was a shack
[1:55:55.140 --> 1:56:10.140]  and somebody said get the hell away from my land and I said I must over here stop by the road yes sir boom shotgun and the shotgun pellets went through the leaves and we're falling down on top of me because they shot from a hundred hundred
[1:56:10.140 --> 1:56:21.140]  50 yards whatever away they didn't have a lot of power and I got in my car Kevin booth was with me because we went and shot the some of the footage that you see in order of death and we got in the car and sped off all these windy roads
[1:56:21.140 --> 1:56:33.140]  because it might be 30 minutes in those hills so you get to a bathroom or restaurant so let me just tell people they're going to try to spend this and demonize people that said the census workers are violating the fifth amendment
[1:56:33.140 --> 1:56:44.140]  making people answer how many guns do they have you know these hundred plus questionnaires they're given some people they have different versions some have five questions some have 49 some have 120 something
[1:56:44.140 --> 1:57:06.140]  I've gotten the 49 question one before and this time got the hundred plus question one and so yes they're trying to spend it oh my god the patriot movements in trouble if somebody killed this guy that he's in an area and again these areas of Tennessee and Kentucky where they will kill you in a minute go ahead
[1:57:06.140 --> 1:57:27.140]  right yeah my point exactly you know I just thought it may seem like they're trying to point this out they mentioned that there wasn't no real major anti-government you know sentiments but the fact that they brought it up always thought that
[1:57:27.140 --> 1:57:43.140]  yeah they're looking for anything they can kill a million 300,000 Iraqis the police can rubber bullet a girl in the face and in for the Red Sox and killer and they don't get in trouble they can shoot us and kill us all the time and then they're out there getting pushy with hillbillies hillbillies will kill you
[1:57:43.140 --> 1:57:58.140]  I mean anybody knows that anybody knows you don't get off the dirt roads in many areas of the south I mean I mean I grew up being told that you don't go near hillbillies property they will kill you period
[1:57:58.140 --> 1:58:19.140]  and then they're sending him into the woods to people shacks he could have been killed by a mentally ill Vietnam vet he could have been I mean by a felon by somebody growing drugs and they put a message don't come in the woods and I think it's not good what happened but that's what they do
[1:58:19.140 --> 1:58:31.140]  there's a lot of areas east Texas you don't go into on the border Louisiana a lot of areas Louisiana you don't go into they want to be left alone and they will kill you that are in the hammer anything else

[2:00:22.140 --> 2:00:33.140]  major new developments we know black waters being used in North Carolina with police in Southern California rating marijuana dispensaries that are totally legal L.A. Times
[2:00:33.140 --> 2:00:42.140]  another mercenary group the town built this FEMA camp this detention center they didn't know what it was for barbed wire fences
[2:00:42.140 --> 2:00:59.140]  then this group shows up calling themselves American police force and says they want all this acreage the mayor says we don't know why they're here why they put hardened police on their black SUVs
[2:00:59.140 --> 2:01:10.140]  and all of this is going on first hour we played the local news clip where the mayor and others are saying we don't know why they're here we don't know why they say there are police now
[2:01:10.140 --> 2:01:24.140]  we played it first hour the audio ladies and gentlemen as I got Steve Quill in the line to go live with us who told me about this last Friday was desperately trying to call me before it broke in the news over the weekend Steve Quill was telling me about it
[2:01:24.140 --> 2:01:38.140]  he has the full intel on it he lives up there very nearby and he has a huge listenership himself in that area and he told me it's down we went and checked it's been removed off the local TV station website
[2:01:38.140 --> 2:01:46.140]  this is very very creepy but we got some screenshots of it so did Steve Quill there at Stevequill.com we'll get those added in an update to our prison planet article
[2:01:46.140 --> 2:02:00.140]  have Watson or Steve Watson do that Montana town occupied by private paramilitary security force report pulled Steve Quill before we get into it being pulled tell people what's really happening here
[2:02:00.140 --> 2:02:10.140]  well first of all Alex around the country is not just in Montana but specific areas are being identified as staging grounds for not only the foreign
[2:02:10.140 --> 2:02:22.140]  let me interrupt you you told me off air a month ago and on air this was going on I just remembered that you told me they were pre positioning Merck's in your area and you said this was I'm sorry black SUVs go ahead
[2:02:22.140 --> 2:02:26.140]  well the black SUV you said they were following you when you even took your family fishing
[2:02:26.140 --> 2:02:33.140]  well the bottom line is that I didn't take my family fishing but they were strategically placed where we said you were in the woods and then they were
[2:02:33.140 --> 2:02:42.140]  they were there and then just recently we had 12 Tajikistan troops on BMWs these are the same BMWs that you and I talked about
[2:02:42.140 --> 2:02:52.140]  and by the way the UN admits their main force is Tajikistan Uzbekistan and Egyptian and Pakistani that's their main UN force sorry go ahead
[2:02:52.140 --> 2:03:02.140]  well listen the owner of the American police force his real name is Eddie Ali he goes by a bunch of other names Jamad Ali, Imad Fazi Ali
[2:03:02.140 --> 2:03:09.140]  and what's interesting is and the question swirling around the jail deal which is I probably you have it on your website I have it on my
[2:03:09.140 --> 2:03:11.140]  they're calling it a jail it's a giant camp
[2:03:11.140 --> 2:03:19.140]  absolutely they're downplaying it and listen the deal is is that some of the officials have been put on leave to put them out of contactor
[2:03:19.140 --> 2:03:26.140]  the people that have made the back room deal this is very similar Alec to the Khabib on Indian reservation deal that went on with the
[2:03:26.140 --> 2:03:34.140]  inslaw promise software what we're seeing here is the full integration of Marcus Wolfe get any Premacop you and I have covered that at
[2:03:34.140 --> 2:03:41.140]  you know at length of seven years years but what what's really important I think it will be important for us to quote Masiya
[2:03:41.140 --> 2:03:50.140]  Mafi who described the Santa Ana company as a pleasant spin-off of a major security firm founded 1984 now here I quote him it will
[2:03:50.140 --> 2:03:59.140]  gradually be more clear as things go along what the nature of this entity and what the nature of the jail is for is this is this one of
[2:03:59.140 --> 2:04:07.140]  the camp operator Merck groups yes it is but it's it's probably one of the most believed though camp operator groups now first of all to
[2:04:07.140 --> 2:04:13.140]  the stories of some stories have said there were three SUVs look when I post the alert on my website that's what was both posted
[2:04:13.140 --> 2:04:19.140]  first it was sent to me the bottom line is this is from people who live there there are people saying well I don't see that stuff
[2:04:19.140 --> 2:04:26.140]  it can't be true I got news for you before you go knocking stuff we've done our background and our deep pool sources are all
[2:04:26.140 --> 2:04:33.140]  saying look we know this guy the guy owns the company but we've never seen this name before so what it is it's a bunch of
[2:04:33.140 --> 2:04:40.140]  different and foreign corporations and foreign paramilitary groups that have been hired by our government Alex listen I'm on the
[2:04:40.140 --> 2:04:47.140]  phone with my webmaster Holly Dale and this fight is up immediately while we're on the phone together and she's capturing the
[2:04:47.140 --> 2:04:54.140]  screenshot that goes down because we're talking in real time at the time it's done stay there stay there I've got key intel
[2:04:54.140 --> 2:05:01.140]  points that you can verify when we get back Steve quail this is mega important foreign Merck's now operating as police have you ever wanted
[2:05:01.140 --> 2:05:07.140]  to generate your own supply of electrical power if so this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear
[2:05:07.140 --> 2:05:13.140]  solar powered generators are now available from solutions from science in Thompson Illinois these emergency backup systems
[2:05:13.140 --> 2:05:20.140]  provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes
[2:05:20.140 --> 2:05:27.140]  and produces electricity for free it's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home run some pumps
[2:05:27.140 --> 2:05:34.140]  shortwave radios computers and even keep food from spoiling whether it's hurricanes ice storms brownouts or blackouts
[2:05:34.140 --> 2:05:41.140]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again when the power goes out you'll be ready with a solar powered
[2:05:41.140 --> 2:05:50.140]  generator from solution from science go to my solar backup dot com and get off the grid today that's my solar backup dot

[2:08:23.140 --> 2:08:29.140]  prisonplanet.tv viewers watching the simulcast radio show we're showing the video of Pittsburgh G20 admitted
[2:08:29.140 --> 2:08:37.140]  that quote secret private mercenaries were dressed up as military grabbing protesters and throwing them into cars
[2:08:37.140 --> 2:08:44.140]  we just showed that video will show it again why do I raise this point now they admit blackwater other groups are
[2:08:44.140 --> 2:08:52.140]  going to be used inside the US the LA Times and the Washington Times both reported in 1993 and again in
[2:08:52.140 --> 2:09:00.140]  1994 that George Bush senior brought in 3200 plus Iraqi Republican guard trained in the 80s by the CIA brought
[2:09:00.140 --> 2:09:07.140]  them in out of Iraq they were involved in the city with McVeigh and others in the black off we know that then
[2:09:07.140 --> 2:09:13.140]  Clinton brought in an additional 2000 plus over 5000 total we know they're intimately involved with security
[2:09:13.140 --> 2:09:20.140]  firms as their cover I'm just throwing that nexus point out we don't know if this group is associated with
[2:09:20.140 --> 2:09:28.140]  that we need to track them back to the Iraqis because this is Arab run now stopping there we have all of this
[2:09:28.140 --> 2:09:34.140]  going on we have this FEMA center that the town mayor and others were saying we don't know why it was just
[2:09:34.140 --> 2:09:41.140]  built here they wouldn't say what it was for black SUV showed up with the term hardened police which are not
[2:09:41.140 --> 2:09:47.140]  part of the police department there's a county there no police in the small town they're telling people don't
[2:09:47.140 --> 2:09:52.140]  talk about it don't talk to us you'll find out what it's for prisoners are about to be here from the evidence
[2:09:52.140 --> 2:09:59.140]  Obama said that in Wyoming and Montana they had built camps that they were going to put the people from Camp
[2:09:59.140 --> 2:10:05.140]  X ray at Guantanamo Bay and and other black sites in Eastern Europe and Asia moving them there they've also
[2:10:05.140 --> 2:10:12.140]  on the news US News and World Report shown a supermax that's closed in Montana that they're going to put people
[2:10:12.140 --> 2:10:19.140]  in I believe this should be followed up on from the pieces I have I believe that's what's happening here
[2:10:19.140 --> 2:10:23.140]  Steve Coyle you just heard those analysis points for the first time do you concur
[2:10:23.140 --> 2:10:27.140]  I absolutely concur but it's even beyond that Alex here's the deal
[2:10:27.140 --> 2:10:33.140]  recapital recapital I'm going to shut up recapital every one of your listeners must go to the internet and type in
[2:10:33.140 --> 2:10:40.140]  Cabazon CAB AZON plus CIA and what you're going to find out you'll find the history of what went on on the Indian
[2:10:40.140 --> 2:10:45.140]  reservation hardened Montana is in the area of one of the largest Indian reservations in Montana
[2:10:45.140 --> 2:10:54.140]  Indian reservation is a Native American reservation is a separate legal entity and basically the intelligence
[2:10:54.140 --> 2:11:00.140]  communities look nobody could take down a website while I'm on a phone conversation with that much authority
[2:11:00.140 --> 2:11:06.140]  even go into the way back machine which is a machine you can check stories out on the internet that have disappeared
[2:11:06.140 --> 2:11:13.140]  off of their original host site no one has that kind of power except the major intelligence organizations of
[2:11:13.140 --> 2:11:20.140]  United States so ladies and gentlemen this is probably one of the most sophisticated clandestine
[2:11:20.140 --> 2:11:26.140]  run programs the country and all has to do with what Alex and we don't even have the video now we should have
[2:11:26.140 --> 2:11:32.140]  captured in fact I meant to tell the guys but they're overworked to capture that I had a bad feeling earlier today
[2:11:32.140 --> 2:11:37.140]  we played the audio but before we can get to the video I wish somebody would have I bet one of our listeners
[2:11:37.140 --> 2:11:44.140]  grabbed it to put it on YouTube in fact check YouTube hard go to YouTube type in harden Montana
[2:11:44.140 --> 2:11:52.140]  camp and I bet it's on YouTube the second you see it get it before they bring it down sorry go ahead Steve
[2:11:52.140 --> 2:12:00.140]  okay again you need to understand that the original owner that's being represented on this whole American police
[2:12:00.140 --> 2:12:07.140]  force is a guy by the name of Edward Angelino that he's known by all his aliases okay and all of the names
[2:12:07.140 --> 2:12:13.140]  I read to you of the different aliases and being you know spelling them out obviously he's got a
[2:12:13.140 --> 2:12:19.140]  a foreign if it sounds like maybe an Iranian who is the spokesman for the attorney for the group that just
[2:12:19.140 --> 2:12:25.140]  came on 30 days ago so the what we're trying to do Alex is you and I are trying to give the listeners
[2:12:25.140 --> 2:12:31.140]  our cooperative listeners meaning those that are all were all the intel patterns to follow to get us the info
[2:12:31.140 --> 2:12:37.140]  absolutely and the thing is is that the idea is that every single now here's ladies and gentlemen we're
[2:12:37.140 --> 2:12:43.140]  teaching you something this is critical all of the addresses are virtual addresses Alex they don't exist
[2:12:43.140 --> 2:12:49.140]  that was admitted in the local news that it's a shadowy group based by the White House right I'm getting
[2:12:49.140 --> 2:12:55.140]  nails asking me by the way that address is very close to the Iraqi Friends Committee the group with
[2:12:55.140 --> 2:13:00.140]  Chalabi I noticed that this morning yeah well here's the thing what it basically let's spell it out
[2:13:00.140 --> 2:13:05.140]  really simply they anticipate an event a false flight it will either be nuclear or the vaccination
[2:13:05.140 --> 2:13:10.140]  biological by the way post the story I'm sure you're aware of it that the Canadians have come out and
[2:13:10.140 --> 2:13:17.140]  said the H1N1 vaccine is initiating the flu G you and I talked about that months ago and that that
[2:13:17.140 --> 2:13:22.140]  they're not going to recommend vaccination so they're going to have to come up with a false flight
[2:13:22.140 --> 2:13:27.140]  I think what was it history channel two different groups of neighbor kids in my neighborhood took it and
[2:13:27.140 --> 2:13:34.140]  got sick yep but I think the thing that that everyone's got to realize is this those camps exist for
[2:13:34.140 --> 2:13:40.140]  a reason we've told the background of the garden plot we've told look at Tennessee look at Ohio all
[2:13:40.140 --> 2:13:45.140]  these shut down state prisons now being run by Homeland Security just sitting there right and look at the
[2:13:45.140 --> 2:13:51.140]  whole Pittsburgh I mean you had Jason and others there I mean look at the whole initiation this is I've
[2:13:51.140 --> 2:13:56.140]  got a very important story Alex and and the it's the militarization the police force on my website
[2:13:56.140 --> 2:14:03.140]  today Steve quail dot com to you a while e dot com that everyone has got to realize well Steve Steve
[2:14:03.140 --> 2:14:07.140]  and we've got the mayor's and I meant to play this today in fact you those mayor clips up I sent you
[2:14:07.140 --> 2:14:12.140]  from the news later when you get a chance that there's in your IMS where the police chiefs just say look
[2:14:12.140 --> 2:14:17.140]  I'm not allowed to be on the street and if you are we attack you I mean this is an incredible
[2:14:17.140 --> 2:14:23.140]  martial law admission that is martial law well and here's the thing I told everybody that they didn't
[2:14:23.140 --> 2:14:28.140]  believe me under the model emergency health powers act which you and I've spoken about they have STK
[2:14:28.140 --> 2:14:33.140]  orders of their shoot to kill orders the point is that I'm getting people say well they can't do this
[2:14:33.140 --> 2:14:38.140]  they can't do that they can under the infraguard that's been covered by mainstream news they can even
[2:14:38.140 --> 2:14:44.140]  deputize private people with license to kill 007 power but let me stop you Steve recap for those that
[2:14:44.140 --> 2:14:49.140]  don't know what we're talking about what's going on in harden where it is what the newscast were
[2:14:49.140 --> 2:14:56.140]  saying what you knew about this before it was on the news what is give us the scoop the bottom line is
[2:14:56.140 --> 2:15:02.140]  a twenty seven million dollar prison facility is not just a jail is twenty seven million bucks
[2:15:02.140 --> 2:15:08.140]  so we had the video I wish we would say there was a giant FEMA camp absolutely and it did exist in the
[2:15:08.140 --> 2:15:14.140]  realm of an Indian reservation hard Montana's about forty five miles east of actually southeast
[2:15:14.140 --> 2:15:20.140]  to Billings Montana Billings Montana's 130 miles away from I am where I live in Bozeman so what
[2:15:20.140 --> 2:15:26.140]  we're talking about is the need for now ladies and gentlemen figure 10 to 16,000 acres that would
[2:15:26.140 --> 2:15:34.140]  obviously encounter or forgive me encompass a lot of the Native Americans reservation land the problem
[2:15:34.140 --> 2:15:42.140]  is there's the jail facility is a giant FEMA camp being manned by foreign mercenaries who not only
[2:15:42.140 --> 2:15:49.140]  have no legal jurisdiction but have basically are there under orders from some very powerful
[2:15:49.140 --> 2:15:55.140]  international mercenary groups stop you you're not saying this they brag they're an international
[2:15:55.140 --> 2:16:02.140]  merc group in Bosnia in Serbia in Iraq all over the world doing secret ops there are these black
[2:16:02.140 --> 2:16:08.140]  SUVs that say hardened police and the local officials are going yeah we've been told they run the camp
[2:16:08.140 --> 2:16:14.140]  and that they run the town now I mean this is Twilight Zone well it's not even Twilight Zone it's
[2:16:14.140 --> 2:16:20.140]  full implementation of the Balkanization of the United States Alex years ago and this is critical
[2:16:20.140 --> 2:16:26.140]  you gotta let me say this years ago when I was interviewing Cold War spies and ex spies from
[2:16:26.140 --> 2:16:32.140]  both sides of the Iron Curtain they told me the United States is already scheduled to be
[2:16:32.140 --> 2:16:37.140]  Balkanized and when we went on the Model Cities exchange programs with different countries around
[2:16:37.140 --> 2:16:44.140]  the world the idea of foreign troops being brought in the United States to keep the order of the
[2:16:44.140 --> 2:16:48.140]  disintegration of the United States we're being Balkanized so the interesting thing too on the
[2:16:48.140 --> 2:16:55.140]  American police force they have the Serbian National Crest okay and obviously one of the guys
[2:16:55.140 --> 2:17:02.140]  that's running it is the Serbian from Montenegro but the point is why do you have a Serbian Crest
[2:17:02.140 --> 2:17:09.140]  on an American police force site that exists in the virtual realm you ladies and gentlemen this is
[2:17:09.140 --> 2:17:16.140]  a major intelligence cutout and in case everybody can't figure it out Rex 84 and all the programs to
[2:17:16.140 --> 2:17:22.140]  enslave, imprison and destroy for the record Alex what's the interesting thing about Guantanamo Bay
[2:17:22.140 --> 2:17:28.140]  is a lot of the torture that's got on there can go on on Indian reservations because they're not under
[2:17:28.140 --> 2:17:33.140]  the same laws of the United States well just like they stuck it under a special Guantanamo Bay
[2:17:33.140 --> 2:17:37.140]  which was this weird no man's land that's a great point Steve what are you you knew about this before
[2:17:37.140 --> 2:17:43.140]  it was in the news what are your intel sources saying specifically my intel sources are saying
[2:17:43.140 --> 2:17:49.140]  specifically that an event is going to be generated in the next several weeks now look these guys are
[2:17:49.140 --> 2:17:54.140]  as tuned in as they can but obviously there are things that change that everybody wants you or I to
[2:17:54.140 --> 2:18:00.140]  give them a day or hour we can't do that we can tell him look everything is in place the there's
[2:18:00.140 --> 2:18:08.140]  7000 Blackwater v employees up on the Canadian border in Kalispell Whitefish Montana that's the
[2:18:08.140 --> 2:18:15.140]  number we're told from the inside sources the amount of foreign troops in Montana right now it's
[2:18:15.140 --> 2:18:19.140]  not just Montana Michigan every other border state the borders of Great Lakes or borders of
[2:18:19.140 --> 2:18:26.140]  Canadian border has their pre-positioned men and materials there that there is going to be the
[2:18:26.140 --> 2:18:31.140]  false flag Alex that we've warned about and warned about and warned now the locals are getting upset
[2:18:31.140 --> 2:18:38.140]  by these black Mercedes SUVs that have hardened Montana on them and then the double legal crest
[2:18:38.140 --> 2:18:44.140]  just announcing we are your police this is insane men with foreign accents stomping around I mean
[2:18:44.140 --> 2:18:50.140]  this is red dawn happening it is red dawn happening and listen when one of my and let me tell you
[2:18:50.140 --> 2:18:57.140]  how close this is when what when my groundskeeper I have a you know full-time groundskeeper if you

[2:19:11.140 --> 2:19:15.140]  to tell you story they listen to you and I and they literally prayed and asked the Lord this was
[2:19:15.140 --> 2:19:19.140]  the day that you and I were on the last time is this stuff real it's not that they don't believe
[2:19:19.140 --> 2:19:23.140]  me or you it's just that sometimes people got to see it with their own eyes let me stop you we
[2:19:23.140 --> 2:19:29.140]  have found photos of the two rivers detention center at Hardin Montana this has not been pulled

[2:24:39.140 --> 2:24:44.140]  Coyle yeah and look Alex I want to tell everybody something one of the most disturbing parts
[2:24:44.140 --> 2:24:50.140]  of this is listen my source told me that one of the managers at a local business in Harden
[2:24:50.140 --> 2:24:54.140]  Montana was visited by this new private security force which is quote the new police department
[2:24:54.140 --> 2:24:59.140]  the guy that was visited is an avid hunter and they came to inform him that they had
[2:24:59.140 --> 2:25:04.140]  a list of all firearms that he owned this includes all the residents of our town and
[2:25:04.140 --> 2:25:08.140]  that he would need to take his guns down to have them put a marking device on them now
[2:25:08.140 --> 2:25:15.140]  excuse me you just dropped a bomb on us this is red dawn they are now Steve you don't Steve
[2:25:15.140 --> 2:25:20.140]  Steve you're we need to have this this this business owner on he needs to speak out well
[2:25:20.140 --> 2:25:26.140]  again the deal is that I will track him down okay or is the town in fear now well I don't
[2:25:26.140 --> 2:25:31.140]  think they're in fear a lot of these people are really I'll tell you what Montana and
[2:25:31.140 --> 2:25:36.140]  they're kind of like Texans you know they'll only take so much and from what I'm hearing
[2:25:36.140 --> 2:25:41.140]  from the hardened people they're getting very very upset okay but but this is a bombshell
[2:25:41.140 --> 2:25:46.140]  Alex see here's what I'm trying to tell everybody okay you can use a cutaway you can use a false
[2:25:46.140 --> 2:25:52.140]  front in Virginia you can use an empty office meeting room but when they start talking and
[2:25:52.140 --> 2:25:57.140]  this was volunteered that they are going they have a list of all the firearms that he owned
[2:25:57.140 --> 2:26:02.140]  only the ATF give that to him or the FBI and that they're going to put a marking device
[2:26:02.140 --> 2:26:07.140]  on them and that they would have the the people in town now when people say well I haven't
[2:26:07.140 --> 2:26:11.140]  been told that well no offense you live 40 miles on a heart and why would you you see
[2:26:11.140 --> 2:26:17.140]  this is all part of it this is absolutely it's got bait it's got education it's got a school
[2:26:17.140 --> 2:26:22.140]  on it just like the FEMA camp up here that they put the illegals in the video we've got
[2:26:22.140 --> 2:26:27.140]  other kids on the swings inside this is a giant facility Steve how many does it hold
[2:26:27.140 --> 2:26:34.140]  well the the expansion module for I'm told that they're talking that it will be ready
[2:26:34.140 --> 2:26:38.140]  to take five to ten thousand people well I'm just from the photos we've seen it looks like
[2:26:38.140 --> 2:26:43.140]  it holds more than that well no I'm just talking I'm just talking right now Alex what it was
[2:26:43.140 --> 2:26:47.140]  currently there I mean let me share this with you when they're talking ten to sixteen
[2:26:47.140 --> 2:26:52.140]  thousand ten thousand to sixteen thousand additional acres you can only use your mind
[2:26:52.140 --> 2:26:58.140]  to to project I mean we're talking about you know pretty flat land in that area some hills
[2:26:58.140 --> 2:27:03.140]  but the point is that you can make this is what people don't understand the plans to
[2:27:03.140 --> 2:27:10.140]  to incorporate almost instantaneous places to put large amounts of people I mean you
[2:27:10.140 --> 2:27:17.140]  know we calculated that they can basically put you name the number they can put it there
[2:27:17.140 --> 2:27:21.140]  and the locals were on the news before the news channel pulled it going we don't know why
[2:27:21.140 --> 2:27:25.140]  they built this big camp we don't know why they're saying there are police now and they
[2:27:25.140 --> 2:27:33.140]  admittedly it's a foreign company I mean Steve we have found a actual real facility we know
[2:27:33.140 --> 2:27:37.140]  they've been shutting down all these other army bases and now in the congressional record
[2:27:37.140 --> 2:27:42.140]  they admit that's FEMA camps but I mean to have it manned by foreigners and they're now
[2:27:42.140 --> 2:27:48.140]  going it's on the news they're going around doing police duties in the local town says
[2:27:48.140 --> 2:27:55.140]  we didn't elect them I mean this is I know I'm stunned Steve I just when you called me
[2:27:55.140 --> 2:27:58.140]  last Friday I've been so focused on other things I did I saw your email and I appreciate
[2:27:58.140 --> 2:28:02.140]  you trying to break it with us and I didn't fully understand until I saw it this morning
[2:28:02.140 --> 2:28:06.140]  on the news because I mean you know I believe you when you tell me stuff but like foreign
[2:28:06.140 --> 2:28:11.140]  mercenaries in Hardin I went and looked at it population a couple hundred and and I'm
[2:28:11.140 --> 2:28:17.140]  like what and I didn't go to the links you sent me and then my god it's I mean even I
[2:28:17.140 --> 2:28:21.140]  can't believe this is happening Steve Coyle well Alan Alex one of the things that you
[2:28:21.140 --> 2:28:25.140]  got to know is and you know I don't harass you I don't even date you a stop but when
[2:28:25.140 --> 2:28:31.140]  I do contact you it's it's a critical importance okay well you also contacted me two weeks to
[2:28:31.140 --> 2:28:36.140]  go to say look out I'm under hit team surveillance what is that about well like I said the bottom
[2:28:36.140 --> 2:28:42.140]  line is is that the specific people already have what I would call the red list fine
[2:28:42.140 --> 2:28:46.140]  shooters in place now this is something that people got understand look the man that gave
[2:28:46.140 --> 2:28:50.140]  me the red list the blue list the green was the blue list let me let me deal with all
[2:28:50.140 --> 2:28:55.140]  of the police all of the military everybody out there in the intelligence community you
[2:28:55.140 --> 2:29:00.140]  who are going to facilitate the rounding up of your fellow countrymen will be terminated
[2:29:00.140 --> 2:29:05.140]  within 30 to 45 days by the very foreign troops that are here that are just basically
[2:29:05.140 --> 2:29:09.140]  taking your names numbers and they know their face to this is what the Russians always do
[2:29:09.140 --> 2:29:15.140]  they use the locals and face to bring in other brigades absolutely Alex and so the thing is
[2:29:15.140 --> 2:29:21.140]  is that they're their prepositioning what I call their shooters okay their assassination
[2:29:21.140 --> 2:29:26.140]  teams and by the way I've had multiple law enforcement representatives that listen to
[2:29:26.140 --> 2:29:31.140]  this show your show my show our shows call me and say you know it's really weird we thought
[2:29:31.140 --> 2:29:35.140]  you were fully you know what's even till we start seeing these guys coming along who
[2:29:35.140 --> 2:29:40.140]  are observers in our department and we were told by our captains of stuff not to ask any
[2:29:40.140 --> 2:29:45.140]  questions then that's now mainstream news you said that years ago that they're putting
[2:29:45.140 --> 2:29:51.140]  in Merck's and regular army and Marines and departments stay there this is getting heavy

[2:36:25.140 --> 2:36:31.140]  military police force you covered that at length what do you think this is and who do
[2:36:31.140 --> 2:36:36.140]  you think these people respond to and follow the money how does a twenty seven million
[2:36:36.140 --> 2:36:43.140]  dollar prison just all of a sudden get built on on the perimeter boundaries of an Indian
[2:36:43.140 --> 2:36:49.140]  reservation in Montana stays dormant for two years now by the way our governor is a great
[2:36:49.140 --> 2:36:54.140]  guy Brian Schweitzer in my opinion because he's gone round and round with the hard officials
[2:36:54.140 --> 2:37:01.140]  and our attorney general said no importation of out of state prisoners okay and they're
[2:37:01.140 --> 2:37:07.140]  aware of the situation right now so there's a war going on and we have a state's rights
[2:37:07.140 --> 2:37:11.140]  issue versus the federal government's rights you know we were one of the first states that
[2:37:11.140 --> 2:37:16.140]  said we won't submit to the confiscation of firearms especially made in Montana firearms
[2:37:16.140 --> 2:37:21.140]  ATF came back and said federal law Trump state law and that's what it all boils down to Alex
[2:37:21.140 --> 2:37:26.140]  but here's where we're at we are right now experiencing the prepositioning of foreign
[2:37:26.140 --> 2:37:33.140]  troops throughout the country we are also prepositioning of military hardware I'm talking
[2:37:33.140 --> 2:37:39.140]  tanks Bradley fighting vehicles I'm talking being told specifically that if necessary
[2:37:39.140 --> 2:37:45.140]  the US military will bomb entire cities in the United States to deal with quote the resistors
[2:37:45.140 --> 2:37:51.140]  you by your identification on you know Obama's hit list let me tell you what Obama's hit
[2:37:51.140 --> 2:37:57.140]  list is nothing compared to the powers that be the New World Order's hit list because
[2:37:57.140 --> 2:38:01.140]  they have and I think this is something that people have got to understand this does not
[2:38:01.140 --> 2:38:08.140]  go on forever without a breaking point and that's why you must you must you must do everything
[2:38:08.140 --> 2:38:13.140]  you can to understand what you are like you just told people they've got to have their
[2:38:13.140 --> 2:38:18.140]  food they've got to have a plan and they've got to be prepared if well Steve that's what
[2:38:18.140 --> 2:38:23.140]  our intel sources are saying is that that's why they're beating innocent people going
[2:38:23.140 --> 2:38:28.140]  into the university attacking at the G 20 attacking women releasing police dogs on old
[2:38:28.140 --> 2:38:33.140]  women in the shopping district old women with bags saying I'm not allowed to shop at the
[2:38:33.140 --> 2:38:39.140]  police are like Billy Club attack dog they have been told to do this to drive everybody
[2:38:39.140 --> 2:38:45.140]  into rebellion absolutely and see this is the thing the billification Alex you remember
[2:38:45.140 --> 2:38:51.140]  I told you identify billify nullify destroy we have a DHS report saying gun owners veterans
[2:38:51.140 --> 2:38:58.140]  gun confiscation clergy response teams libertarians in the Fed protesters my guys got had the police
[2:38:58.140 --> 2:39:03.140]  come and say with that they were terrorist and call them on their phones and say you're
[2:39:03.140 --> 2:39:09.140]  on a watch list now laughing at them at the G 20 these are sickos well I gotta tell you
[2:39:09.140 --> 2:39:14.140]  something too I will stand by my source or people that obviously work for the federal
[2:39:14.140 --> 2:39:20.140]  government saying my source is wrong I will stand up by her with her she is as solid as
[2:39:20.140 --> 2:39:25.140]  they come I've had corollary look let me tell you something Alex I have to have three
[2:39:25.140 --> 2:39:29.140]  questions by independent people unknown to each other usually from the military intel
[2:39:29.140 --> 2:39:35.140]  and I go out my car all stuff everybody is saying the same thing Obama's choosing why
[2:39:35.140 --> 2:39:40.140]  Montana he's purposely choosing Montana Wyoming as the testing ground because number one we
[2:39:40.140 --> 2:39:45.140]  don't have the population is supposedly below the whistle and they can buy off the local
[2:39:45.140 --> 2:39:51.140]  small town people I'm told for peanuts okay for peanut remember Delta force in 99 making
[2:39:51.140 --> 2:39:56.140]  bribes in major cities the San Antonio police chief refused the bribe went public on this
[2:39:56.140 --> 2:40:01.140]  show saying just work with us in black ops for continuity of government they have and
[2:40:01.140 --> 2:40:04.140]  then they're choosing Wyoming Montana because the low population because they can outnumber
[2:40:04.140 --> 2:40:10.140]  the people with the mercs and intimidate them and beta test can they have mercs as police
[2:40:10.140 --> 2:40:15.140]  can they do this can they build FEMA centers and then mainstream news I know Watson and
[2:40:15.140 --> 2:40:20.140]  Steve and Kirk can pull these up in the last few months they've announced that Obama plans
[2:40:20.140 --> 2:40:26.140]  to put the get no people in Wyoming and Montana well absolutely and see this is the deal I
[2:40:26.140 --> 2:40:31.140]  mean people gotta understand Montana has just a little bit under a million people in the
[2:40:31.140 --> 2:40:35.140]  whole state where the fourth largest state but there's a lot of stuff in Montana we got
[2:40:35.140 --> 2:40:40.140]  a lot of underground bases I mean big ones I'm talking huge ones Alex four square miles
[2:40:40.140 --> 2:40:46.140]  underground and usually when you see these types of camps showing up they show up in
[2:40:46.140 --> 2:40:51.140]  some of the most remote areas of Montana and the Wyoming now listen we're getting reports
[2:40:51.140 --> 2:40:57.140]  from the field of French and intelligence troops in law cabins near the flaming gorge
[2:40:57.140 --> 2:41:04.140]  reservoir who've been met by shuna helicopters and on BMW motorcycle and are having coolers
[2:41:04.140 --> 2:41:09.140]  very small coolers given to them you and I talked about that okay those are you said
[2:41:09.140 --> 2:41:13.140]  a month ago you thought they might release the flu on Indian reservations then the national
[2:41:13.140 --> 2:41:19.140]  Canada said flu shots with body bags are being delivered all over absolutely oh my god it's
[2:41:19.140 --> 2:41:24.140]  starting to come together a holy mackerel yeah also upper peninsula Michigan the amount of
[2:41:24.140 --> 2:41:30.140]  real estate being sold on the borders especially for hotels for a lot just any great like lodges
[2:41:30.140 --> 2:41:35.140]  I mean I'm in contact like you are with a lot of people and I'm telling you they are buying
[2:41:35.140 --> 2:41:42.140]  a lot they in L. E. O. 9 said troops from 14 countries here with FEMA training to engage
[2:41:42.140 --> 2:41:47.140]  American terrorist absolutely and remember when they landed at what Jacksonville Florida
[2:41:47.140 --> 2:41:54.140]  13 nations of Latin America major news absolutely and what about Alex the time frame is critical
[2:41:54.140 --> 2:41:59.140]  because I know we don't have that much time left together but the time frame look 400 border
[2:41:59.140 --> 2:42:05.140]  patrol guards are being taken off the Mexican U. S. border that will create a corridor for
[2:42:05.140 --> 2:42:10.140]  the red dawn scenario it is not by chance that Venezuela seeking nuclear weapons submarine
[2:42:10.140 --> 2:42:17.140]  that is not by chance that the San Juan Diego submarine base in Cuba top secret base underwater
[2:42:17.140 --> 2:42:25.140]  access plan to Oslon plan of San Diego absolutely everything and look years ago I mean I track
[2:42:25.140 --> 2:42:31.140]  I talked to a lot of guys that were international weapons dealers you know a lot of years they
[2:42:31.140 --> 2:42:36.140]  said the amount of weaponry going into the gangs and I'm not talking about 38 specials
[2:42:36.140 --> 2:42:42.140]  or 20 and after you talked about that the grenade launchers in AK-47s on Costco Chinese
[2:42:42.140 --> 2:42:47.140]  government ships being delivered wasn't going to gangs the L. A. Times reported was being
[2:42:47.140 --> 2:42:53.140]  bivouacked absolutely so it's strategically placed and what I'm watching and what I think
[2:42:53.140 --> 2:42:59.140]  everybody should be watching is this look when you see foreign troops make notes and
[2:42:59.140 --> 2:43:03.140]  for those of you that have camera phones for those of you that have a video cameras take
[2:43:03.140 --> 2:43:08.140]  them everywhere you know Alex I'm notorious now I travel with all my stuff I'm not going
[2:43:08.140 --> 2:43:13.140]  to be caught without my cameras any longer and I'm a photographer but that's my profession
[2:43:13.140 --> 2:43:19.140]  before I went and talk radio so the thing is is that we've got to absolutely get photographs
[2:43:19.140 --> 2:43:24.140]  and like you've already made the request to harden there this is the thing you guys everyone
[2:43:24.140 --> 2:43:30.140]  listening they think they hate is exposure and I mean that in the pun sense of the word as
[2:43:30.140 --> 2:43:35.140]  in photographic exposure and so when we can get the photos and get them uplinked and while
[2:43:35.140 --> 2:43:41.140]  we've still got time Alex listen we are running out of time that's not BS it's not a talk
[2:43:41.140 --> 2:43:47.140]  radio bravado look when you start identifying enemies of the state I think there should
[2:43:47.140 --> 2:43:53.140]  be an absolute everyone who's on that that list and and me and others who have been you
[2:43:53.140 --> 2:43:59.140]  know said you die soon the bottom line is is that we should be finally a class actual
[2:43:59.140 --> 2:44:06.140]  super hate crimes or hate crimes because they're talking about the political assassination
[2:44:06.140 --> 2:44:11.140]  first of all a free speech and of anybody that will stand against it as as well as a
[2:44:11.140 --> 2:44:15.140]  chilling effect Steve they're attempting to chill our speech they told our camera guys
[2:44:15.140 --> 2:44:19.140]  you're going to be on terror list and laugh this is their new police state they did hire
[2:44:19.140 --> 2:44:23.140]  prima cough they did our Marcus Wolfram East Germany you were correct that came out in
[2:44:23.140 --> 2:44:27.140]  congressional budget documents that they are setting up the Stasi teams they have hired
[2:44:27.140 --> 2:44:31.140]  the 3.4 million girl scouts to quote spy on their neighbors and help take on terrorists
[2:44:31.140 --> 2:44:37.140]  AP AFP headline they are training the Boy Scouts of America in the explorer scouts to
[2:44:37.140 --> 2:44:41.140]  quote take on gun owners and disgruntled veterans front page of the New York Times this is
[2:44:41.140 --> 2:44:46.140]  really happening they really have children coast to coast worshipping Obama changing
[2:44:46.140 --> 2:44:51.140]  the words from Jesus loves all the little children yellow red black and white they are
[2:44:51.140 --> 2:44:57.140]  equal in his sight to president Obama loves all the little children yellow red yellow
[2:44:57.140 --> 2:45:02.140]  black and white they're equal in his sight we have entered the twilight zone and they're
[2:45:02.140 --> 2:45:07.140]  testing they're probing right now and then as nothing happens we just get more condition
[2:45:07.140 --> 2:45:15.140]  to accept it but I want to give the number out Steve 1-800-259-9231 that private

[2:45:45.140 --> 2:45:51.140]  seen such a massive build up I want to hear specifically from people that have these
[2:45:51.140 --> 2:45:57.140]  new camps that have been built in their areas I want to hear specifically from people who
[2:45:57.140 --> 2:46:04.140]  are in harden or what you think about this of your own Wyoming or Montana 1-800-259-9231

[2:46:12.140 --> 2:46:19.140]  ahead well again we're running out of time people can no longer just sit back and like
[2:46:19.140 --> 2:46:23.140]  I'm getting emails Alex as you and I are speaking what does this mean to us in Indiana there
[2:46:23.140 --> 2:46:29.140]  is no state except from this it is going to be total Tommy Frank if misstatement about
[2:46:29.140 --> 2:46:33.140]  us but the Constitution's gone if there's a weapons of mass destruction listen ladies
[2:46:33.140 --> 2:46:38.140]  gentlemen it's being already put forth on the history channel that Washington DC is
[2:46:38.140 --> 2:46:43.140]  going to get new did you watch that Alex yes okay so the thing is is that the neuro
[2:46:43.140 --> 2:46:47.140]  linguistic programming we're already being trained the other thing that people got to
[2:46:47.140 --> 2:46:52.140]  understand this is a great psychological operation ever initiated by any intelligence
[2:46:52.140 --> 2:46:57.140]  organizations pearl in the history of the world and that's what Dr. Horowitz is trying
[2:46:57.140 --> 2:47:02.140]  to get people to understand too the background noise is designed to mess people's brains
[2:47:02.140 --> 2:47:08.140]  up and I gotta tell you something Alex I am absolutely disturbed by the lack of critical
[2:47:08.140 --> 2:47:12.140]  thinking by some of the people that have listened to you and listen to me since we both started
[2:47:12.140 --> 2:47:17.140]  on the air they they'll say things well like how do you know this is it we can give them
[2:47:17.140 --> 2:47:24.140]  1000 sources 2000 10,000 100,000 sources but if they won't go and read it and see for
[2:47:24.140 --> 2:47:30.140]  themselves they still live in that mind control river of denial well that's it I mean open
[2:47:30.140 --> 2:47:34.140]  world government being announced open into the dollar police saying no one's allowed to
[2:47:34.140 --> 2:47:39.140]  protest or even go shopping attacking old one with police dogs riding through neighborhoods
[2:47:39.140 --> 2:47:44.140]  sound canning eight nine-year-old kids we have photos video total insanity and people are
[2:47:44.140 --> 2:47:48.140]  going I don't see a police state I don't see a new world order they are under mind control
[2:47:48.140 --> 2:47:52.140]  let's say somebody's in Texas or Florida or New York and they want to fly to Hardin to
[2:47:52.140 --> 2:47:58.140]  see this for themselves what is the best town to fly into in Montana to go see this
[2:47:58.140 --> 2:48:06.140]  Billings Montana and I would encourage everybody up on my website on the alert I have both
[2:48:06.140 --> 2:48:13.140]  the pockets and testers phone numbers to say what is going on up there and they say our
[2:48:13.140 --> 2:48:18.140]  congressional excuse me our senatorial delegation is aware of this no they're not they do nothing
[2:48:18.140 --> 2:48:25.140]  we also have Brian Schweitzer who by the way is a very strong state rights guy probably
[2:48:25.140 --> 2:48:30.140]  one of them my opinion the leading governor is an America who is fighting for state rights
[2:48:30.140 --> 2:48:36.140]  he understands the global grasp for water Alex minerals it's all about money okay it's
[2:48:36.140 --> 2:48:41.140]  a power grab we're being occupied they think we're rotten and weak and decadent and they're
[2:48:41.140 --> 2:48:45.140]  just occupying us right out in the open thinking if they just go about their business like
[2:48:45.140 --> 2:48:49.140]  it's no big deal we'll accept it well yes and also by the way it's divide and conquer
[2:48:49.140 --> 2:48:55.140]  and let me go back to it balkanization gee who knows better about balkanization than
[2:48:55.140 --> 2:49:00.140]  the troops that were involved in all the different civil wars and you and police actions than
[2:49:00.140 --> 2:49:05.140]  those who are balkanized okay that's the story of the American police force that's why they
[2:49:05.140 --> 2:49:09.140]  pulled down the website please everybody go and look at my photo of the day Alex you're
[2:49:09.140 --> 2:49:14.140]  welcome to use it take it there's all those things are are absolutely you know that's
[2:49:14.140 --> 2:49:19.140]  what you've got it saved for those that don't know recap foreign mercenary group admitted

[2:49:25.140 --> 2:49:28.140]  area it's called the select matter something he was on that they erased it off the news
[2:49:28.140 --> 2:49:32.140]  channel to they didn't just pull American police force they pulled the local news channel
[2:49:32.140 --> 2:49:36.140]  they don't even say the story is gone it's just gone and we got all these videos we're
[2:49:36.140 --> 2:49:42.140]  trying to grab right now and they're there coming driving around doing police work with
[2:49:42.140 --> 2:49:47.140]  police next to their American police force logos the locals are saying why are you here
[2:49:47.140 --> 2:49:52.140]  I mean this is insane and then you've confirmed they go they're going to local saying we have
[2:49:52.140 --> 2:49:57.140]  a list of your guns you have to mark them for us and do what they have to turn them they
[2:49:57.140 --> 2:50:03.140]  have to bring them in and have them marked okay they put chips in them okay oh interesting
[2:50:03.140 --> 2:50:07.140]  all the warnings the alerts and the jumping up and down and screaming we've done about
[2:50:07.140 --> 2:50:12.140]  the RFID technology and now in little old hardened Montana or in little old towns in
[2:50:12.140 --> 2:50:18.140]  Wyoming that this is happening to not just in Montana Wyoming but any place that is
[2:50:18.140 --> 2:50:23.140]  sparsely occupied we're getting reports from the upper peninsula Michigan Greg
[2:50:23.140 --> 2:50:27.140]  Evenson's gone into detail with me we're getting reports from different places in Indiana
[2:50:27.140 --> 2:50:33.140]  by the way also warehouses everyone listen to me the places that are being configured
[2:50:33.140 --> 2:50:38.140]  from within our large fifty hundred thousand square warehouse whether they're in Reno
[2:50:38.140 --> 2:50:44.140]  Las Vegas all of the major cities that's what they're doing out and FEMA admits their
[2:50:44.140 --> 2:50:49.140]  retrofitting under tabletop and NLE09 sports stadiums and other holding facilities look
[2:50:49.140 --> 2:50:52.140]  at Katrina the first thing the troops did was not bring food and water but go in the
[2:50:52.140 --> 2:50:56.140]  high and dry areas citizens that were taking care of their property and take their guns
[2:50:56.140 --> 2:51:00.140]  and beat the hell out of them they were beta testing the troops to see if they'd do it
[2:51:00.140 --> 2:51:05.140]  we'll be right back Thomas Jefferson once said when the people fear their government
[2:51:05.140 --> 2:51:10.140]  there is tyranny when the government fears the people there is liberty our God given
[2:51:10.140 --> 2:51:14.140]  right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and

[2:54:52.140 --> 2:54:57.140]  the locals are getting angry and upset I mean they have the local community leader the mayor
[2:54:57.140 --> 2:55:02.140]  on the news saying we don't know why they're running the camp we don't know what it's for
[2:55:02.140 --> 2:55:07.140]  we don't know why they're saying there are police now I mean this is on so many fronts
[2:55:07.140 --> 2:55:11.140]  and then you add the part about bring your guns and we've got to mark them I mean this
[2:55:11.140 --> 2:55:17.140]  is this is red dawn red dawn and I but I think it's red dawn for the whole country not just
[2:55:17.140 --> 2:55:22.140]  hard Montana okay because again the thing is the fact I don't think people get it okay
[2:55:22.140 --> 2:55:28.140]  the northern borders are being shut off ladies and gentlemen most people as things break loose
[2:55:28.140 --> 2:55:34.140]  and Alex on you know obviously Texas and New Mexico Arizona California Florida the entire
[2:55:34.140 --> 2:55:40.140]  Gulf Coast you know is going to be a landing zone but I don't think people realize that
[2:55:40.140 --> 2:55:45.140]  it's already anticipated that most Americans who will want to flee the tyranny and by the
[2:55:45.140 --> 2:55:51.140]  way this is an open joke in the international espionage community it's an open joke that
[2:55:51.140 --> 2:55:56.140]  the Americans have bragged about freedom and liberty and their second amendment rights and
[2:55:56.140 --> 2:56:01.140]  I've heard him go to me but it is happening under your right before your eyes Steve this
[2:56:01.140 --> 2:56:06.140]  is a guy that speaks Russian very good English okay he says you wonder how we could put up
[2:56:06.140 --> 2:56:12.140]  with it look what's going to happen to you and Alex that I can't argue okay the thing
[2:56:12.140 --> 2:56:16.140]  that you've got to know too this is coming in from a military source all military medical
[2:56:16.140 --> 2:56:22.140]  training Army Air Force Navy Marines is being moved to San Antonio because it is being moved
[2:56:22.140 --> 2:56:29.140]  out of all the DC area and other target cities so I'm telling you point blank we are going
[2:56:29.140 --> 2:56:35.140]  to see a false flag event I don't know if it's tied in with the Israeli Iran thing I don't
[2:56:35.140 --> 2:56:39.140]  know but I'm telling you this it's not just going to be a single issue it's going to be
[2:56:39.140 --> 2:56:49.140]  multiple issues concurrently going off at the same time Steve this is so incredible we
[2:56:49.140 --> 2:56:56.140]  found a bunch of YouTube videos of this giant federally FEMA built center the locals say
[2:56:56.140 --> 2:57:01.140]  we don't know why foreign mercs are manning it or posing as police we're going to get those
[2:57:01.140 --> 2:57:06.140]  added to Paul Watson story that's on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com we're going
[2:57:06.140 --> 2:57:11.140]  to post that again as our top story I want to go to some phone calls now from people
[2:57:11.140 --> 2:57:17.140]  that say they have specific intel on this or other similar areas Steve in Texas you're
[2:57:17.140 --> 2:57:23.140]  on the air with Steve Coyle go ahead yeah hey Alex I want to let you know and Steve also
[2:57:23.140 --> 2:57:29.140]  I actually once I saw this article on your site and heard you report I watched the video
[2:57:29.140 --> 2:57:35.140]  and everything I actually got the information I just I sent you a fax about an hour ago
[2:57:35.140 --> 2:57:42.140]  because I couldn't get through I called the Big Horn County Montana Sheriff's Department
[2:57:42.140 --> 2:57:46.140]  and I'll give you that number again if you wanted I had on the fax but I talked to a
[2:57:46.140 --> 2:57:51.140]  woman that works directly with the head sheriff she said he wasn't in today and I brought
[2:57:51.140 --> 2:57:56.140]  this up and when I politely mentioned to her I was very polite that of being made aware
[2:57:56.140 --> 2:58:04.140]  of the APF invasion of hardened she immediately responded it's fake I said what she said it's
[2:58:04.140 --> 2:58:10.140]  fake I said ma'am I saw the newscast there they have vehicles there with this logo on
[2:58:10.140 --> 2:58:15.140]  there saying hardened police she said well that's been taken off the vehicles as if that
[2:58:15.140 --> 2:58:20.140]  made it okay and I just told her politely I said ma'am I want you to please let the
[2:58:20.140 --> 2:58:26.140]  sheriff know he's sworn enough to uphold the Constitution he what this is is a violation
[2:58:26.140 --> 2:58:32.140]  of his jurisdiction and if he doesn't tell these people to hit the road and oust them
[2:58:32.140 --> 2:58:38.140]  he is guilty of violating his own stay there tell me what she said I've got your fax right
[2:58:38.140 --> 2:58:40.140]  here
[2:58:40.140 --> 2:58:48.140]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade we are the GCN
[2:58:48.140 --> 2:58:54.140]  radio network have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power if so
[2:58:54.140 --> 2:58:58.140]  this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear solar power generators
[2:58:58.140 --> 2:59:02.140]  are now available from solutions from science in Thompson Illinois these emergency backup
[2:59:02.140 --> 2:59:07.140]  systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas generators
[2:59:07.140 --> 2:59:12.140]  a solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes and produces electricity for free it's like
[2:59:12.140 --> 2:59:17.140]  having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home run some pumps shortwave
[2:59:17.140 --> 2:59:22.140]  radios computers and even keep food from spoiling whether it's hurricanes ice storms
[2:59:22.140 --> 2:59:27.140]  brownouts or blackouts you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again
[2:59:27.140 --> 2:59:32.140]  when the power goes out you'll be ready with a solar power generator from solution from
[2:59:32.140 --> 2:59:38.140]  science go to my solar backup dot com and get off the grid today that's my solar

[2:59:53.140 --> 3:00:00.140]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[3:00:00.140 --> 3:00:22.140]  look at this headline from YouTube Montana town dreams of being Guantanamo of the plains
[3:00:22.140 --> 3:00:28.140]  I told you they're talking about this being a FEMA camp and we were able to find the
[3:00:28.140 --> 3:00:33.140]  newscast that was taken down earlier that Steve talked about we have that newscast
[3:00:33.140 --> 3:00:40.140]  right now let's go to the local Hardin Montana newscast live at prisonplanet.tv
[3:00:40.140 --> 3:00:46.140]  it's the great part about the web everybody grabs this go ahead and play it man
[3:00:46.140 --> 3:00:52.140]  has Montana congressional delegation speaking out I'm against it I don't think it's a good idea
[3:00:52.140 --> 3:00:58.140]  it's too much of security risk I don't think we want to have al-Qaeda prisoners in Montana
[3:00:58.140 --> 3:01:02.140]  it's a security risk that I don't think we want to have
[3:01:02.140 --> 3:01:07.140]  however Senators Max Baucus and John Tester and Representative Denny Rieberg say they do
[3:01:07.140 --> 3:01:12.140]  support the jail in finding viable contracts Tuesday Hardin City Council gave two Rivers
[3:01:12.140 --> 3:01:17.140]  Detention Center officials the green light to pursue a contract to accept Gitmo prisoners
[3:01:17.140 --> 3:01:22.140]  President Barack Obama has said he plans to close Guantanamo by next January
[3:01:22.140 --> 3:01:26.140]  jail officials say their facility is secure enough to hold the terror suspects
[3:01:26.140 --> 3:01:31.140]  we understand this is a long shot at best and really what we're asking for is just to come out
[3:01:31.140 --> 3:01:36.140]  and take a look at our situation and see if it would fit for him
[3:01:36.140 --> 3:01:41.140]  the U.S. Justice Department says right now the Gitmo detainee review task force is determining
[3:01:41.140 --> 3:01:45.140]  whether each prisoner will be prosecuted or sent overseas
[3:01:45.140 --> 3:01:50.140]  okay earlier I was saying I believe this had to do with Gitmo people
[3:01:50.140 --> 3:01:56.140]  and then I didn't give the guys clear orders they found the other article the other video again
[3:01:56.140 --> 3:02:00.140]  this was a separate one confirming this has to do with FEMA
[3:02:00.140 --> 3:02:04.140]  but now they're on the news saying we don't know what it's for we don't know why there's foreign mercs here
[3:02:04.140 --> 3:02:09.140]  we don't know why they're saying their local police and then Steve's saying they have people
[3:02:09.140 --> 3:02:14.140]  telling them they've got to come in and mark their guns down with them so here's this newscast
[3:02:14.140 --> 3:02:19.140]  he's just talking to Steve and he sent me the facts he talks to the sheriff's department there in Big Horn
[3:02:19.140 --> 3:02:23.140]  and they say no such things going on the classic denial response
[3:02:23.140 --> 3:02:25.140]  Steve Quayle we've seen this over and over again
[3:02:25.140 --> 3:02:32.140]  well it's standard operating procedure look here's the deal a bureaucrat wants to protect their jobs at all costs
[3:02:32.140 --> 3:02:37.140]  the sheriff is conveniently gone after this story breaks I'm not saying he's avoiding anything
[3:02:37.140 --> 3:02:43.140]  but look the bottom line is that it's happening the bottom line is you can go to my bloody website
[3:02:43.140 --> 3:02:48.140]  Steve Quayle.com check out the photo of the day and those of you are saying oh this is all crap
[3:02:48.140 --> 3:02:53.140]  you know go collect your G20 paycheck and then probably you know swallow a sword or something
[3:02:53.140 --> 3:03:00.140]  Alex it's happening right now it's happening before our very eyes it's not just happening in Montana and Wyoming
[3:03:00.140 --> 3:03:09.140]  but this thing in Hardin is the most visible because that was the city of Hardin who wanted to fill this unusual prison complex
[3:03:09.140 --> 3:03:17.140]  and by the way in Bozeman we don't have enough space for our prisons most of Montana even at the local state prisoners
[3:03:17.140 --> 3:03:24.140]  we don't have enough room for so the thing that's interesting is that there is a reason why this thing was built
[3:03:24.140 --> 3:03:32.140]  and the funding for it should how does a little town like Hardin come up with 27 million bucks to build a thing
[3:03:32.140 --> 3:03:38.140]  somebody says a bond offering somebody has to buy those bonds if you follow the money you follow the intent
[3:03:38.140 --> 3:03:44.140]  the money indicates the intent so I don't care if everybody if one man lies another one swears to it
[3:03:44.140 --> 3:03:49.140]  and everyone says yeah these guys are telling truth a lie is a lie and it is what it is and it's happening
[3:03:49.140 --> 3:03:56.140]  and the people that are absolutely behind the American police force are absolutely known to the intelligence community
[3:03:56.140 --> 3:04:02.140]  it is a major major black-off connected with martial law and the...
[3:04:02.140 --> 3:04:09.140]  Well Steve we know in Serbia they've had black sites the secret ghost sites with the kidnap snatch and grab people
[3:04:09.140 --> 3:04:10.140]  Absolutely
[3:04:10.140 --> 3:04:17.140]  We know that they're in Tajikistan Uzbekistan Pakistan we know they're in Egypt we know they're in Germany
[3:04:17.140 --> 3:04:24.140]  we know they're in Poland we know they're in the Czech Republic we also know that they are in other areas
[3:04:24.140 --> 3:04:31.140]  and so this fits the classic MO where they use these private ghost contractors to run this
[3:04:31.140 --> 3:04:38.140]  Well and I think that's the thing that people got to do by the way Alex the whole world when it comes to someone admitting
[3:04:38.140 --> 3:04:44.140]  that a surreptitious plan is underway goes into the I know nothing mode okay
[3:04:44.140 --> 3:04:51.140]  what's the best way to get off the hook you just play dumb I'm sure the caller who called them
[3:04:51.140 --> 3:04:53.140]  I know nothing
[3:04:53.140 --> 3:04:55.140]  They know nothing and they have nothing
[3:04:55.140 --> 3:04:58.140]  Many times due to their compartmentalization
[3:04:58.140 --> 3:05:04.140]  they don't know I know nothing but hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions

[3:08:02.140 --> 3:08:09.140]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[3:08:09.140 --> 3:08:16.140]  it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[3:08:20.140 --> 3:08:26.140]  the video was pulled it is up now we have it
[3:08:26.140 --> 3:08:34.140]  now of course they're gonna run scyops they're gonna say there's no world government no plan to get rid of the dollar as they have open meetings and announce they're doing it
[3:08:34.140 --> 3:08:41.140]  they're gonna announce there's no plan to indoctrinate their kids as they begin changing Christian hymns to worship Obama
[3:08:41.140 --> 3:08:49.140]  they're gonna say there's no gun bills when they got more than 15 introduced I've seen that openly banned the second amendment of the attorney general wants to ban everything he can
[3:08:49.140 --> 3:08:56.140]  it just gives him dictatorial power they say there's no death panels then they have newsweek saying death panels the case for killing granny
[3:08:56.140 --> 3:09:02.140]  headline they deny so you'll debate whether it exists or not so you can never mobilize
[3:09:02.140 --> 3:09:10.140]  so this is just some of what we're dealing with here we're gonna play this clip in just a moment and go back to Joyce Scott
[3:09:10.140 --> 3:09:22.140]  Jeremy Danny Joyce hung up in Montana Joyce call back I wanted to go to you 1-800-259-9231 keep a line open for Joyce if we can 1-800-259-9231
[3:09:22.140 --> 3:09:32.140]  here is the video clip right now ladies and gentlemen from them admitting they don't know why there's Merck's they're saying their police and video of it
[3:09:32.140 --> 3:09:43.140]  they don't know what's going on with the camp they don't know who's gonna be held in it it's a giant facility and then we have an earlier newscast where the town wanted to be a FEMA camp to hold political dissonance
[3:09:43.140 --> 3:09:52.140]  we just played that earlier and my gut told me that this was the town had heard about a few months ago we just confirmed it Steve quail this well let's play it before it goes dead again here's the video
[3:09:52.140 --> 3:10:06.140]  all members of the American police force showed up in Hardin yesterday driving vehicles with Hardin police written on them as colorates Nikola report to created quite a stir especially because Hardin doesn't have a city police department
[3:10:06.140 --> 3:10:16.140]  this was the talk of the town in Hardin on Thursday Mercedes decked out in the city of Hardin police department decals and driven by American police force members
[3:10:16.140 --> 3:10:27.140]  two rivers authority officials say having APF patrol the streets was never part of their agenda you know I have no idea I really don't because that's not anything that's been in the discussions that I've had with any of them
[3:10:27.140 --> 3:10:38.140]  as it stands now the bighorn county sheriff's department is contracted to patrol the city and APF has no jurisdiction if that was changed Peterson claims it would have to go through the city council
[3:10:38.140 --> 3:10:46.140]  as for the jail contract with APF both sides are yet to agree on a deal as bondholders rejected it again on Thursday morning
[3:10:46.140 --> 3:10:56.140]  no it's a complicated issue there's a lot of tax laws that they're working through and we're just hoping now we thought we were gonna get it by Tuesday night we're hoping now we can get it by Friday night
[3:10:56.140 --> 3:11:07.140]  and two rivers authority officials say the contract only deals with the detention facility and the training center there's no mention of a homeless shelter animal shelter or any other services for the area
[3:11:07.140 --> 3:11:16.140]  well you know that that was never in the contract to begin with I think it was just kind of on a wish list of what captain Michael wanted to do here
[3:11:16.140 --> 3:11:21.140]  American police force officials plan on staying in the Hardin area for the next month
[3:11:21.140 --> 3:11:29.140]  as colorates nick law reporting the exact details of the contract talks between two rivers authority and American police force remain under wraps
[3:11:29.140 --> 3:11:42.140]  so you buy a bunch of black SUVs bring in foreign mercs admittedly run by foreigners and your authorities drive a black car wear a black uniform got a German shepherd and a machine gun you are now an authority Steve Coyle
[3:11:42.140 --> 3:11:52.140]  well I think the thing that people got to understand it it's really got to think in is that we are under occupation look we watched it happen in Nazi Germany by the way
[3:11:52.140 --> 3:12:09.140]  what's happening in the best illustration is pre World War two Norway how the Nazis moved into Norway moved into Sweden moved into obviously Scandinavia and assimilated in the community how long Alex have you and I've been reporting on all the anomalies that people are seeing
[3:12:09.140 --> 3:12:24.140]  and now it's here ladies and gentlemen because again and Alex there are four hundred thousand foreign troops the United States people used to give us crap all the time about it and they did they gave me crap until it just you know it just flowed
[3:12:24.140 --> 3:12:39.140]  the bottom line is and then North com comes out and says they want permission from Congress to strategically place four hundred thousand quote peacekeepers in the U.S. where do those peacekeepers come from well guess what the United Nations
[3:12:39.140 --> 3:12:54.140]  it isn't incredible that the CDC we got to bring this in the Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization no longer report each one in one death because there's not enough of so how can you have a pandemic when there's no death to warrant the level six
[3:12:54.140 --> 3:13:05.140]  this is all manipulated it's all absolute programming and it's all designed to put it on a martial law and by the way the heart facility isn't for Jim McGitmo it's for people who are resistors
[3:13:05.140 --> 3:13:14.140]  and let me stop you right there they admit that in the Homeland Security reports we broke and the Mayak reports is Steve still there
[3:13:14.140 --> 3:13:28.140]  Steve finishing what you said you talked to the County Sheriff's Department Steve by the way has given us dozens of good reports and more than that over the years so we know we can count on what Steve tells us I've we've had Steve on it several times not Steve
[3:13:28.140 --> 3:13:42.140]  well but the other Steve is a guest about bizarre stuff going on at universities in East Texas and all these flu drills before this even happened practicing quarantining with army at different universities
[3:13:42.140 --> 3:13:53.140]  Steve you talked to her and she just said none of this is going on but you said well I've seen the newscast with that on the on the on the mercenary vehicles and she said well that's been taken off
[3:13:53.140 --> 3:14:03.140]  so first she denies it but as soon as she knows that you know facts she goes well that's no big deal I mean that is really frightening when the Sheriff's Department is engaged in deception
[3:14:03.140 --> 3:14:15.140]  and I also want to mention I had an interesting discussion with a woman with City Hall tied in with the City Council I want to point out first of all the guy that's on that newscast he's not the mayor his name's Al Peterson
[3:14:15.140 --> 3:14:27.140]  he's with his two rivers authority and if you notice he used the name Captain Michael they said they had a contract well first of all with the Sheriff's Department the woman by her response this is fake
[3:14:27.140 --> 3:14:38.140]  and then when I told her what I knew I mean she didn't know what to say but when she said it's taken off the vehicles in other words in her mind that makes it all okay
[3:14:38.140 --> 3:14:48.140]  and you know to summarize all that I just thought no what needs to be removed is these people from your town and when I talked to the City Hall woman you know I just let her know
[3:14:48.140 --> 3:14:58.140]  look you need to let these people with the City Council know they're there to uphold the laws of your community and to protect the locals it's local municipalities
[3:14:58.140 --> 3:15:18.140]  and I asked her who's the two rivers authority while they're here for economic development so let's be clear it's just like L.C.R.A. here in Central Texas has SWAT teams armored vehicles private jails it's a quasi private group they take over towns
[3:15:18.140 --> 3:15:31.140]  so that guy acting on the news like he's the mayor of two rivers this is just the head of this authority that's done a contract with the American police force that isn't even American
[3:15:31.140 --> 3:15:39.140]  who's now driving around just announcing themselves as an incorporation over the city this is a total takeover good job Steve
[3:15:39.140 --> 3:15:49.140]  I got to go to other callers or I'm not going to be able to get to others Steve can we keep you to the bottom of the hour another five minutes sure okay because I want to be able to take calls and get their info
[3:15:49.140 --> 3:15:55.140]  let's continue here let's talk to Scott in Nebraska you're on the air go ahead
[3:15:55.140 --> 3:16:13.140]  yeah but it's the work ethic camp in Nebraska so little town on the western edge of Nebraska right next to Wyoming Colorado called McCook just Google work ethic camp Nebraska this is it's disguised as a drug rehab prison
[3:16:13.140 --> 3:16:21.140]  but this is this is a female camp if I've ever seen one this is a concentration camp can you can you see that yet
[3:16:21.140 --> 3:16:31.140]  no but I'm aware of how they camouflage these notice I said this was really a camp for camp x-ray prisoners and then we found mainstream news out of buildings saying that
[3:16:31.140 --> 3:16:43.140]  now I'm not bragging about my mind when you study this stuff 1516 18 hours a day you start understanding the patterns and then you know what you're seeing immediately no matter what they say
[3:16:43.140 --> 3:16:46.140]  but in this case they're admitting it all Steve quail
[3:16:46.140 --> 3:16:51.140]  well I think the bottom line is that whatever they do they always do in plain sight
[3:16:51.140 --> 3:17:01.140]  and remember redefining terms is a Hagellian dialectic we watch that in Hitler and you know you and I start screaming when they start talking about home and security
[3:17:01.140 --> 3:17:15.140]  by the way wasn't it just last week that home and security supposedly had done pennants for their identifying all of the terrorists and now they're back up in full force again and guess who's on the list everybody was on the list before
[3:17:15.140 --> 3:17:25.140]  now Alex here we may be close to the timing issue before you and I have to say goodbye today the idea that the timing it looks like October November is the time period
[3:17:25.140 --> 3:17:35.140]  we just got an email in you need to hear this Louisiana State Police are doing explosive ordinance device training they're running classes right now for all their parishes
[3:17:35.140 --> 3:17:45.140]  the policeman this class told me they're getting ready to raise the terror alert looking at some weird United Nations camera vehicle group on I-20 in Mississippi at this point
[3:17:45.140 --> 3:17:55.140]  and the guy said they said thank you Frank you say I'm trying to get pictures so the thing is look we we come out we speak about the vaccination they say okay we'll just go the next thing
[3:17:55.140 --> 3:18:07.140]  we identify the next thing they just go the next thing these people are not without plan DEFG if we expose ABC but it still puts people into the same position
[3:18:07.140 --> 3:18:19.140]  they have got to make sure that if they could not go to a store for 30 days they could stay where they're at by the way our our governor just made a statement I guess today that he's not going to allow anybody
[3:18:19.140 --> 3:18:31.140]  with federal authority to take away the guns of food or that of the state rights that we possess and we intend to stand with so you know again we've got a very outspoken state governor
[3:18:31.140 --> 3:18:41.140]  people are asking me will succession succeed no we're going to be balkanized the only question is well enough people be gotten out of harm's way in time
[3:18:41.140 --> 3:18:53.140]  Steve Steve that's another nexus point your governor said you're going to manufacture guns in the state outside federal control north com out of Colorado said we're not going to allow that
[3:18:53.140 --> 3:19:05.140]  and then now obama's come in with justice department letters threatening the states threatening them with the john warner defense authorization act that stated homeland security is to block governors and legislatures
[3:19:05.140 --> 3:19:19.140]  so that's what this is is a major federalized internationalized cancer probe that they put in to this town absolutely Alex and one of the things I've got to tell everybody you've got to understand and those of you who are Christians
[3:19:19.140 --> 3:19:35.140]  you've got to play hey excuse me if you've got to pray for the people who are absolutely in state office that are standing up in federal office because look they have a fascination team just like the old video service series America you remember where the Russians took out they took out out of Congress
[3:19:35.140 --> 3:19:49.140]  in the Senate well these guys got the same plan anybody that doesn't go along either Pam off or they blow them away at that or set them up and they made that show with Chris Christoverson off of real plans that have been drawn up
[3:19:49.140 --> 3:20:01.140]  but instead of Russians doing it it's his international corporate takeover and just like Operation Valkyrie was used against Hitler they're going to use the continuity of government grid as their playbook and cover to take over

[3:24:31.140 --> 3:24:42.140]  I'll continue with calls after you leave us up next here is let's talk to Diane in Montana Diane in Montana where this is going on
[3:24:42.140 --> 3:24:46.140]  but as Steve said it's happening everywhere Diane what's your info
[3:24:46.140 --> 3:24:54.140]  okay September 9 Steve I don't know if you remember me from Superior Montana which is about 50 miles west of Missoula
[3:24:54.140 --> 3:25:03.140]  right we had a small incident where there was a bunch of SUVs black Hummers you name it it was all there
[3:25:03.140 --> 3:25:09.140]  they even brought a helicopter and it was four miles from my home so when we went to check it out
[3:25:09.140 --> 3:25:17.140]  there was a husband that went down there and talked to them personally they were all over climbing the mountains in camo
[3:25:17.140 --> 3:25:24.140]  dressed up they were armed and they said they were just doing a training exercise called the Sheriff's Office
[3:25:24.140 --> 3:25:33.140]  and we got the same story it's just FBI training but it was FEMA right in Superior and we're probably about maybe 4,000 population
[3:25:33.140 --> 3:25:40.140]  well I need everybody in the area to get cameras they're very cheap now video cameras for as cheap as $100 that shoot decent quality
[3:25:40.140 --> 3:25:44.140]  everybody needs to be shooting this and uploading it to YouTube Steve Cuell
[3:25:44.140 --> 3:25:53.140]  well I think you know that's obvious and as we're talking now I think that people need to become eyes and ears and email you stuff in real time
[3:25:53.140 --> 3:26:04.140]  and make video important of stuff don't just go out and just take dormant military vehicles but vehicles that are in motion like the report we just got
[3:26:04.140 --> 3:26:11.140]  and let me share this too people gotta stay up on this you know there are reports of sailors being vaccinated
[3:26:11.140 --> 3:26:16.140]  I stated this is critical for people to understand you guys the Pentagon shame on you
[3:26:16.140 --> 3:26:25.140]  I stated that the easiest way to deal with America before a full-scale assault in this country was to poison the vaccines
[3:26:25.140 --> 3:26:34.140]  and then let them be tested on servicemen and because of this is a matter of national security Alex big time we're not going to get any true reports
[3:26:34.140 --> 3:26:41.140]  and now we're hearing Bob Chapman's confirmed with his sources and he's always been accurate that they're dying on the ships not just quarantining them
[3:26:41.140 --> 3:26:51.140]  well absolutely and see this is the thing too that people got to understand that we have we have a specific concern out there for whatever it's going to be
[3:26:51.140 --> 3:27:01.140]  they're going to initially utilize the H1N1 H5N1 whatever else they come up with but the idea is this is to scare you
[3:27:01.140 --> 3:27:09.140]  and when we provide the information Alex and God bless you for what you do all the different information that should be an antidote for fear
[3:27:09.140 --> 3:27:19.140]  because that's what we're talking about let me ask Diane in closing what did the locals think and how many FBI FEMA troops were there
[3:27:19.140 --> 3:27:29.140]  okay there were six vehicles when my husband went right by them he called back and said lockdown I don't know what's going on if there's escape prisoners or what
[3:27:29.140 --> 3:27:38.140]  same time helicopter came through right overhead called his secretary who was coming in on I-90 told her to check that area out
[3:27:38.140 --> 3:27:50.140]  and look at it and that's when she saw the camo guys all over the mountainside just crawling up asked around town people didn't think anything about it
[3:27:50.140 --> 3:28:00.140]  yeah this is insane they're definitely probing and testing thank you so much Diane let's cram in another call here let's talk to Jeremy in Alaska
[3:28:00.140 --> 3:28:11.140]  Jeremy what's your intel how you doing Alex hey buddy actually I'm a sovereign I'm in Alaska I want to commend you on the work that you've done sir
[3:28:11.140 --> 3:28:19.140]  you're not responsible for waking me up but you're definitely one of the people that kept me awake I've been studying law over the last year
[3:28:19.140 --> 3:28:31.140]  and I from Lieutenant Colonel in the Marines for 35 years and also some other people that are international attorneys and from what I'm understanding
[3:28:31.140 --> 3:28:42.140]  is there's this NAFTA free trade agreement yes and under that they have a military sharing agreements 2002-2008 to occupy the US with foreign troops
[3:28:42.140 --> 3:28:50.140]  that is mainstream announcements Steve Coyle well and again that's absolutely correct and I think everybody's got to understand this
[3:28:50.140 --> 3:29:02.140]  by putting us into a level six bio emergency under the World Health Organization in essence who just got appointed head of the United Nations Security Council
[3:29:02.140 --> 3:29:17.140]  first time the president of the United States putting it all together Alex I don't believe there is a more totalitarian more disconcerting picture of the partitioning off the selling off the giving off the pirating off of the
[3:29:17.140 --> 3:29:26.140]  United States at that that's in its people and by the way the numbers that they're talking about 50 million people that's a minimum amount of people that the globalist want to kill
[3:29:26.140 --> 3:29:33.140]  all right Steve Coyle we will get a report from you tomorrow can you join us again tomorrow yes I can thank you Alex thank you everyone for listening
[3:29:33.140 --> 3:29:40.140]  thank you while he's on hold let's get him upset up now I'm going to come back with a recap of this other key news announce the contest winners

[3:33:01.140 --> 3:33:11.140]  I say I shot the sheriff but that's where it was in safety first yeah
[3:33:11.140 --> 3:33:22.140]  freedom came my way one day and I started out of town yeah
[3:33:22.140 --> 3:33:31.140]  all of a sudden I saw the sheriff turn around came in to shoot me down
[3:33:31.140 --> 3:33:41.140]  so I shot I shot I shot him down and I say
[3:33:41.140 --> 3:33:47.140]  if I am guilty I will pay
[3:33:47.140 --> 3:33:52.140]  I shot the sheriff
[3:33:52.140 --> 3:33:57.140]  which is a confirmed FEMA camp the locals are being secretive about it
[3:33:57.140 --> 3:34:12.140]  but we found an earlier newscast from April of this year out of KULR 8 News Emily Nats here it is
[3:34:12.140 --> 3:34:20.140]  a potential for detaining terror suspects at the empty two rivers detention facility in Hardin has Montana congressional delegation speaking out
[3:34:20.140 --> 3:34:29.140]  I'm against it I don't think it's a good idea it's too much of security risk I don't think we want to have al-Qaeda prisoners in Montana
[3:34:29.140 --> 3:34:33.140]  it's a security risk that I don't think we want to have
[3:34:33.140 --> 3:34:44.140]  they do support the jail in finding viable contracts Tuesday Hardin city council gave two rivers detention center officials the green light to
[3:34:44.140 --> 3:34:52.140]  pursue a contract to accept Gitmo prisoners president Barack Obama has said he plans to close Guantanamo by next January
[3:34:52.140 --> 3:34:56.140]  jail officials say their facility is secure enough to hold the terror suspects
[3:34:56.140 --> 3:35:06.140]  we understand this is a long shot at best and really what we're asking for him is just to come out and take a look at our situation and see if it would fit for him
[3:35:06.140 --> 3:35:16.140]  the U.S. Justice Department says right now the Gitmo detainee review task force is determining whether each prisoner will be prosecuted or sent overseas
[3:35:16.140 --> 3:35:26.140]  ladies and gentlemen this is that facility now they have another supermax that's closed in Montana they say they're going to hold people in
[3:35:26.140 --> 3:35:34.140]  including U.S. citizens in fact U.S. News and World Report reported on any poll Watson on this a best researcher on this
[3:35:34.140 --> 3:35:40.140]  they're all great but Paul really can ferret stuff out even when I can't find it I remember it was in the news about the supermax
[3:35:40.140 --> 3:35:47.140]  and then it said oh and there's already some terrorists there some animal rights activists and people are being held and their families aren't allowed to visit them
[3:35:47.140 --> 3:35:55.140]  it's like Gitmo but that's a supermax this is another bigger facility for whole families and then we have this other newscast where they're all being
[3:35:55.140 --> 3:36:04.140]  shifty about it now looks like they got the contract when black vehicles saying Hardin police show up with foreigners going we are in control
[3:36:04.140 --> 3:36:13.140]  you must list our firearms with us I mean and since we broke this today Steve Quill really broke this weekend but it broke big here today
[3:36:13.140 --> 3:36:23.140]  they pulled the American police force site down they're pulling videos down this is off the charts creepy I mean we have run right into a nest
[3:36:23.140 --> 3:36:31.140]  ladies and gentlemen unbelievable let's go ahead and play it
[3:36:31.140 --> 3:36:38.140]  of the American police force showed up in Hardin yesterday driving vehicles with Hardin police written on them as colorates
[3:36:38.140 --> 3:36:44.140]  Nick Law reports it created quite a stir especially because Hardin doesn't have a city police department
[3:36:44.140 --> 3:36:52.140]  this was the talk of the town in Hardin on Thursday Mercedes decked out in the city of Hardin police department decals and driven by
[3:36:52.140 --> 3:36:59.140]  American police force members two rivers authority officials say having APF patrol the streets was never part of their agenda
[3:36:59.140 --> 3:37:05.140]  you know I have no idea I really don't because that's not anything that's been in the discussions that I've had with any of them
[3:37:05.140 --> 3:37:12.140]  as it stands now the bighorn county sheriff's department is contracted to patrol the city and APF has no jurisdiction
[3:37:12.140 --> 3:37:20.140]  if that was changed Peterson claims it would have to go through the city council as for the jail contract with APF both sides are yet to agree on a deal
[3:37:20.140 --> 3:37:24.140]  as bondholders rejected it again on Thursday morning
[3:37:24.140 --> 3:37:29.140]  it's a complicated issue there's a lot of tax laws that they're working through
[3:37:29.140 --> 3:37:35.140]  and we're just hoping now we thought we were going to get it by Tuesday night we're hoping now we can get it by Friday night
[3:37:35.140 --> 3:37:40.140]  and two rivers authority officials say the contract only deals with the detention facility and the training center
[3:37:40.140 --> 3:37:45.140]  there's no mention of a homeless shelter animal shelter or any other services for the area
[3:37:45.140 --> 3:37:53.140]  well you know that was never in the contract to begin with I think it was just kind of on a wish list of what Captain Michael wanted to do here
[3:37:53.140 --> 3:37:58.140]  American police force officials plan on staying in the hardened area for the next month
[3:37:58.140 --> 3:38:06.140]  and that was colorates nick law reporting the exact details of the contract talks between two rivers authority and American police force remain under wraps
[3:38:06.140 --> 3:38:16.140]  so you got a FEMA camp you've got a private prison facility there the president's looking at putting a FEMA camp there with prisoners
[3:38:16.140 --> 3:38:26.140]  it's been built recently locals ask about it are told to shut up and then captain Michael with his foreign Merck group
[3:38:26.140 --> 3:38:32.140]  this is an international foreign group says oh it's just a wish list they're driving around with their new patrol vehicles
[3:38:32.140 --> 3:38:38.140]  then you call up the sheriff's department goes we don't know what you're talking about none of this exists haha
[3:38:38.140 --> 3:38:44.140]  and here's another whitewash report here it is
[3:38:44.140 --> 3:38:53.140]  split over what American police forces intentions are but Hardin Meryl candidate Kerry Smith says the group is here to help
[3:38:53.140 --> 3:39:02.140]  oh two days after American police force members arrive in Hardin in black Mercedes police cars the hardened decals are gone
[3:39:02.140 --> 3:39:09.140]  oh with the American police force that's what I'd like to know when we approached the group Friday morning an APF member instructed us
[3:39:09.140 --> 3:39:15.140]  to ensure where the group's leader captain Michael Hilton was minutes later Hilton abruptly left the facility
[3:39:15.140 --> 3:39:21.140]  oh it's mysterious at all um it probably is to those that don't know what's going on
[3:39:21.140 --> 3:39:28.140]  Kerry Smith is the wife of two rivers authority executive director Greg Smith who was recently placed on administrative leave
[3:39:28.140 --> 3:39:36.140]  no public explanation has been given Kerry wouldn't comment on her husband's paid leave but says the truth about APF will be revealed
[3:39:36.140 --> 3:39:43.140]  American police force has nothing to fear oh you can't panic you just go with the flow and everything will be fine
[3:39:43.140 --> 3:39:51.140]  but other Hardin residents are concerned about the lack of information so far I'm concerned about the legitimacy of who they are
[3:39:51.140 --> 3:39:55.140]  there's a lot of secrecy going on I guess is what I would say
[3:39:55.140 --> 3:40:03.140]  American police force says it will meet with the media Saturday morning and answer questions regarding the group's secrecy and discuss its future plans for Hardin
[3:40:03.140 --> 3:40:10.140]  it's going to be great I don't understand who this company is and why they where were they two years ago
[3:40:10.140 --> 3:40:14.140]  that's all I have to say where were they before the ground broke
[3:40:14.140 --> 3:40:20.140]  the bondholders are yet to approve the contract between two rivers authority and American police force
[3:40:20.140 --> 3:40:30.140]  now APF is on site right now they're taking inventory of the jail they say they'll remain in the area for the next couple weeks to assess the situation
[3:40:30.140 --> 3:40:34.140]  reporting live in the newsroom Nick Law tell the right news
[3:40:34.140 --> 3:40:43.140]  oh I'm having trouble right now even dealing with this and processing it ah
[3:40:43.140 --> 3:40:49.140]  one of the clergy response teams say when they finally announced it and had the preachers going we're training people to go to the camps
[3:40:49.140 --> 3:40:54.140]  turn their guns in Romans 13 go easy go with the flow and everything will be alright
[3:40:54.140 --> 3:40:58.140]  they're reading off a script that was from Louisiana this is from Montana
[3:40:58.140 --> 3:41:06.140]  and man talk about spookville CIA will black satans running like roaches when you flip the light on at 3am in your apartment
[3:41:06.140 --> 3:41:14.140]  there's like big fat roaches going and they like running as fast as they can
[3:41:14.140 --> 3:41:19.140]  press conference on Saturday
[3:41:19.140 --> 3:41:26.140]  we got a FEMA camp for real here boy because they use a camouflage him and claim it for something else we have them red handed with
[3:41:26.140 --> 3:41:37.140]  foreign mercs this is very interesting I'll just leave it at that believe me you're going to hear some key reports here in the next few days
[3:41:37.140 --> 3:41:46.140]  oh boy ok I meant to make greater fanfare of this but I will announce it today the articles up on info wars dot com
[3:41:46.140 --> 3:41:51.140]  need to be contacted by the winners I'll make the announcement right now
[3:41:51.140 --> 3:41:57.140]  where did my first place go I had I had my first place winner here
[3:41:57.140 --> 3:42:06.140]  now I don't have it oh here it is first place so it's written on the back of a FEMA camp article sorry and I'm on the White House enemies list you know it's nothing to
[3:42:06.140 --> 3:42:11.140]  I just I'm literally living on a twilight zone episode
[3:42:11.140 --> 3:42:18.140]  I'm on the telephone I'm with Charlie sheen the phone rings buzz Aldrin this is a month before it came out others massive water on the moon will be
[3:42:18.140 --> 3:42:26.140]  announced in a month I see it on the front page a month later I got Dave Mustaine mega death over here I got making films on the enemies list
[3:42:26.140 --> 3:42:34.140]  because FEMA camps are real they're openly doing force inoculations openly announcing world government you're all in the twilight zone here with me
[3:42:34.140 --> 3:42:45.140]  the soccer moms are driving around dreaming about their football teams and the average person has no idea what's going on
[3:42:45.140 --> 3:42:50.140]  it's getting too weird folks it's getting too weird
[3:42:50.140 --> 3:43:01.140]  okay the reason it took me a couple weeks longer to judge these and announce them was because there were hundreds of great entries and I wanted to watch them all
[3:43:01.140 --> 3:43:09.140]  then I wanted to get my cruise review I had three different people in the office watch the top 10 or 15 contenders
[3:43:09.140 --> 3:43:16.140]  and they all came up with the same order of the winners
[3:43:16.140 --> 3:43:24.140]  I guess on the Charlie sheen contest is it fair to tell the last winner of the two contests they can't be part of this contest because they keep winning but
[3:43:24.140 --> 3:43:32.140]  you know it's my contest rules I do whatever I want it's whoever the best winner is San Francisco Bay Area the US of Terror
[3:43:32.140 --> 3:43:41.140]  that's their YouTube channel they win first prize on the second we had debates I said should I be like a communist and give it to the second best
[3:43:41.140 --> 3:43:50.140]  and he already won everybody said no give it to the best separately in my office letting other people judge they came up with the same winner as I did
[3:43:50.140 --> 3:44:00.140]  so you got to give it to the winner and so that's the end of it I asked Rob do last week I said who do you think is the best
[3:44:00.140 --> 3:44:10.140]  and he watched a whole bunch of I say 1015 do come on in there how many after I've already judged them secretly how many of these did you watch
[3:44:10.140 --> 3:44:19.140]  how many I watched everyone also you watch more than I watched everyone that was on our contest page all three pages I watched everyone and
[3:44:19.140 --> 3:44:26.140]  and you came to the same winners separately not even knowing who I was going to choose I really liked was I was I was like wanting to take it away from him I'm like
[3:44:26.140 --> 3:44:34.140]  I was like we had a meeting here you said that yeah I said I think San Francisco is the best and you said well he won last time I don't know if we could do that
[3:44:34.140 --> 3:44:42.140]  and I said I mean he he took it's kind of like Roger Stalbach he won a little Super Bowl he's Roger Stalbach I mean he gets to win well he
[3:44:42.140 --> 3:44:50.140]  you know he took you know like there there's Google he went and did posters about Google he did about SRI in front of their offices yeah he
[3:44:50.140 --> 3:44:58.140]  and then he made his own swine flu poster and put that everywhere so he and his posters look good they're easy to read he had a lot of you know he went after
[3:44:58.140 --> 3:45:06.140]  Facebook you know he went he went and did I think way above and beyond what anybody else did well we need to keep these posted for a week or two
[3:45:06.140 --> 3:45:15.140]  they need to get mega viral yeah this poster contest is so good he wins those folks win Los Angeles we have a new winner yeah Los Angeles got second
[3:45:15.140 --> 3:45:23.140]  place I think it's most of the we are changed people from Los Angeles but it's a separate yet freedom is free 1776 yeah they did great tomorrow
[3:45:23.140 --> 3:45:32.140]  unless we're in total martial arts I think I'll be playing these on air and New York who won second place last time they won third place right
[3:45:32.140 --> 3:45:39.140]  right so these are just good filmmakers these are good activists and they do things that are going to get people's attention which I like you know
[3:45:39.140 --> 3:45:48.140]  they were out there doing things and then there are some other notables Pittsburgh and San San Antonio we are changed did really good videos
[3:45:48.140 --> 3:45:55.140]  they were I felt a little too drawn out in order to make the full multi parts yeah because you know if you'd you got to get the message across
[3:45:55.140 --> 3:46:02.140]  and we put no guidelines in there but you know you got to do it in four to five minutes I think and if to really make it to where people are really
[3:46:02.140 --> 3:46:10.140]  going to watch it and and you know get the message this guy New York did a lot of crazy stuff and and you know any he kind of
[3:46:10.140 --> 3:46:18.140]  lampooned it a little bit in terms of how he was acting and and by the way they all deserve to win which we all win in the fight for liberty
[3:46:18.140 --> 3:46:26.140]  there's getting people politically active they all win by getting out getting involved showing people how to be grassroots and how we can bring down the
[3:46:26.140 --> 3:46:33.140]  tyranny if we have to they shut down the web and radio just with posters yeah I mean folks it's a devastating weapon against the new
[3:46:33.140 --> 3:46:42.140]  world order in the info war and and and a little bit racy there on that last one but it doesn't matter he gets he gets third place so
[3:46:42.140 --> 3:46:54.140]  San Francisco the United States of terror first place freedom is free 1776 LA second place and to Johnny T gets third place and they all
