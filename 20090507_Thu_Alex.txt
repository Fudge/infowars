[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:31.520]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome this is the Alex Jones show may 7th Thursday 2009 I am
[00:31.520 --> 00:36.400]  Jason Burma sitting in Alex will be joining us on later a half hour into the show we're
[00:36.400 --> 00:41.720]  gonna have Stuart Rhodes and now we're also gonna have Mark Dyson discussing his newest book
[00:41.720 --> 00:49.120]  Illuminati fact versus fiction and also the upcoming release of Angels and Demons but I
[00:49.120 --> 00:52.960]  want to go through some of the news especially you know first of all they're
[00:52.960 --> 00:56.080]  going to give the banks more money and now they're talking about you know what
[00:56.080 --> 00:59.600]  maybe we have to bail out the Senate's actually talking about maybe we have to
[00:59.600 --> 01:03.800]  bail out some of these newspapers oh that's gonna be great government-owned
[01:03.800 --> 01:07.880]  media openly government-owned media now we're gonna have to help out the
[01:07.880 --> 01:12.600]  newspapers the newspapers can't go under we have to demonize the alternative
[01:12.600 --> 01:17.280]  media because they're coming up and they're more credible than us and we're
[01:17.280 --> 01:20.120]  just gonna have to bail these guys out that's the bottom line I mean that's
[01:20.120 --> 01:23.640]  why they're putting the alternative media in this lexicon document that we've
[01:23.640 --> 01:27.960]  been talking about now for I think two weeks and we're gonna play this Lou
[01:27.960 --> 01:33.520]  Dobbs clip later in the show it's about six minutes long it's with I think it's
[01:33.520 --> 01:37.400]  representative King out of New York and he's a little bit disingenuous in my
[01:37.400 --> 01:42.000]  opinion he's acting like oh this is a rogue element and oh this is the second
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.600]  document to come out like this no actually it's the third DHS document we
[01:46.600 --> 01:50.080]  got the Virginia Fusion Center one we have the one that they've talked about
[01:50.080 --> 01:55.800]  about the you know veterans and all that and then we have this latest domestic
[01:55.800 --> 02:00.560]  lexicon document and really it should be four because we have the Mayak report
[02:00.560 --> 02:06.480]  as well so he's really disingenuous there Lou Dobbs does cover some of the
[02:06.480 --> 02:09.640]  more hardcore issues but then he doesn't talk about the alternative media and I
[02:09.640 --> 02:13.120]  love Lou Dobbs again he's one of the very few people that really goes after
[02:13.120 --> 02:19.800]  both sides he does go into the anti illegal immigration one and he goes
[02:19.800 --> 02:24.560]  into I believe it is the what was the other one oh yeah anti-technology one
[02:24.560 --> 02:28.480]  and we've been talking a lot of technology on my show the info warrior
[02:28.480 --> 02:34.880]  nine to midnight central but it is just it's insane to me that first of all this
[02:34.880 --> 02:38.360]  document still isn't getting the play that it deserves especially for what it
[02:38.360 --> 02:42.360]  says they're saying oh there's there's these terrorists people planning
[02:42.360 --> 02:47.640]  terrorism at the border on Mexico it's never happened it's it's imaginary and
[02:47.640 --> 02:50.240]  then I was going through the headlines today and it seems like they're still
[02:50.240 --> 02:54.840]  hyping this swine flu is anybody seeing this swine flu where is it apparently
[02:54.840 --> 02:59.640]  we had the one death yesterday remember we didn't actually find any pigs and the
[02:59.640 --> 03:04.200]  news is still kind of reporting that well yeah it's swine avian and human flu
[03:04.200 --> 03:07.800]  all mixed together meanwhile you know they're fear mongering they're saying
[03:07.800 --> 03:12.200]  oh this could combine with HIV and AIDS and all the sudden we'll have airborne
[03:12.200 --> 03:17.800]  AIDS and a whole bunch of people will die and the public is so literally dumb
[03:17.800 --> 03:26.200]  down I mean literally at you know quasi retarded level that somebody puts out a
[03:26.200 --> 03:31.200]  hoax that on Twitter no less on Twitter you know Twitter is the main source of
[03:31.200 --> 03:37.240]  my news someone puts out this hoax on Twitter that there is a zombie virus like
[03:37.240 --> 03:42.680]  the one in 28 days later 28 weeks later or dawn of the dead all that stuff and
[03:42.680 --> 03:50.200]  that's what this is turning into and people believe it zombies really that's
[03:50.200 --> 03:54.400]  how dumb we are and that's why they're openly talking about things like this
[03:54.400 --> 03:58.600]  you know this is the telegraph this is less than a week ago swine flu
[03:58.600 --> 04:04.680]  inflatable mortuaries and express funerals planned for flu pandemic 24
[04:04.680 --> 04:09.600]  hour cremations and express funerals could all be used to dispose of thousands
[04:09.600 --> 04:14.520]  of bodies in the flu pandemic whitehall papers show and they're saying as high
[04:14.520 --> 04:23.640]  as 750,000 people in the UK give me a break meanwhile China is kind of backing
[04:23.640 --> 04:28.920]  off and they're literally stopping most of the quarantines they let Mexico fly a
[04:28.920 --> 04:32.960]  bunch of their citizens out it looks like that Hong Kong thing is going to end
[04:32.960 --> 04:38.440]  early but the World Health Organization is still saying you know what we still
[04:38.440 --> 04:43.200]  might declare level six I think the guy's name is Besser for what and they
[04:43.200 --> 04:49.520]  admit in this article in CNN that they had to re-translate the language of what
[04:49.520 --> 04:53.280]  a pandemic was to declare a level six we'll be back after this is the Alex
[04:53.280 --> 04:58.000]  Jones show info wars.com prisonplanet.tv

[06:06.240 --> 06:11.560]  spear we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I
[06:11.560 --> 06:15.960]  think all of us would like to see the Obama deception completely destroys the
[06:15.960 --> 06:19.920]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people while
[06:19.920 --> 06:24.560]  Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a
[06:24.560 --> 06:28.720]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[06:28.720 --> 06:33.960]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[06:33.960 --> 06:40.440]  that's fascism it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government

[07:50.880 --> 07:54.080]  life-changing tea
[07:54.080 --> 08:08.360]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:10.400 --> 08:18.360]  all right folks we are back why am I still making a big deal out of this
[08:18.360 --> 08:24.880]  flu issue well the headline at a yahoo yesterday was like oh well now that this
[08:24.880 --> 08:29.160]  flu is here it might go away for a little while but it's gonna be back full
[08:29.160 --> 08:34.320]  force full force and winter time just in time for your baxter vaccination again
[08:34.320 --> 08:39.200]  back through the company caught putting two types of alive bird flu let's say
[08:39.200 --> 08:44.920]  again two types of alive bird flu in the vaccinations as well as a live human
[08:44.920 --> 08:49.880]  flu and of course with this they put the face of this woman who recently died
[08:49.880 --> 08:53.800]  really the first case in the United States who supposedly died from this
[08:53.800 --> 08:58.760]  wine flu now they want to say this child died here well he was like two years old
[08:58.760 --> 09:03.400]  and he was a premature baby and he had all sorts of health issues and they're
[09:03.400 --> 09:07.960]  acting like oh it's so big oh it's so bad they quarantine people in some
[09:07.960 --> 09:11.680]  nations apparently Calderon was pretty upset at least in the mainstream media
[09:11.680 --> 09:15.680]  saying that you know he was being discriminated against and I kind of
[09:15.680 --> 09:18.800]  feel for him because I don't know you know he's obviously a pawn just like
[09:18.800 --> 09:22.840]  anybody else but at the same time he's feeling the thrust of this are like oh
[09:22.840 --> 09:27.160]  it's coming from Mexico meanwhile supposedly the only pigs they found the
[09:27.160 --> 09:31.840]  only pigs they found were in Canada and then they blamed it on a Mexican migrant
[09:31.840 --> 09:36.880]  worker doesn't make a lot of sense so anyway um this article is like many
[09:36.880 --> 09:40.320]  experts are predicting that the current outbreak of swine flu much like the
[09:40.320 --> 09:43.760]  regular seasonal flu will subside during the summer months and reappear in the
[09:43.760 --> 09:51.960]  fall that return could come with a vengeance come on oh let's see Len
[09:51.960 --> 09:56.160]  Horovitz was actually quoted in this article I didn't even realize that I
[09:56.160 --> 10:00.720]  wonder if that's the same guy actually it's Horovitz is that how you spell
[10:00.720 --> 10:05.840]  Horovitz or Vitz do you know what out there guys do you know Len Horovitz
[10:05.840 --> 10:10.880]  at W right see it's that's weird because they've got a Len Horovitz in here
[10:10.880 --> 10:16.680]  interesting it's basic fear-mongering I mean UPI is saying that it could get
[10:16.680 --> 10:21.560]  mutated with AIDS and we'd have a live AIDS virus and what's important is
[10:21.560 --> 10:24.400]  they're still saying they could go with level six now if they go with level six
[10:24.400 --> 10:31.000]  you don't have any human rights whatsoever according to the WHO checklist
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.960]  for an influenza pandemic preparedness planning and it says 1.5.1 during a
[10:36.960 --> 10:41.320]  pandemic it is unnecessary to overrule existing legislation or individual
[10:41.320 --> 10:46.040]  human rights examples are the enforcement of quarantine overruling
[10:46.040 --> 10:49.560]  individual freedom of movement use of privately owned buildings for hospitals
[10:49.560 --> 10:53.200]  in other words just taking people's stuff carte blanche and say we're using it
[10:53.200 --> 10:57.480]  you got nothing to say about it off license use of drugs compulsory
[10:57.480 --> 11:02.960]  vaccinations and that intertwines with executive order 13 375 where they say
[11:02.960 --> 11:06.160]  if you don't take the vaccine you're doing at least a year in prison and a
[11:06.160 --> 11:11.440]  $250,000 fine let's see compulsory vaccinations or implementation of
[11:11.440 --> 11:15.560]  emergency shifts in essential services these decisions need a legal framework
[11:15.560 --> 11:19.200]  to ensure transparent assessment and justification of the measures that are
[11:19.200 --> 11:22.920]  being considered and to ensure coherence with international legislation
[11:22.920 --> 11:27.240]  oh international well this is a UN document and international health
[11:27.240 --> 11:30.540]  regulations basically mean you don't have a constitution you don't have a
[11:30.540 --> 11:34.200]  bill of rights and you think you're a sovereign citizen well if you you're
[11:34.200 --> 11:39.720]  part of the sovereign citizen movement you're also named in this DHS lexicon
[11:39.720 --> 11:43.440]  document and you know what I would normally wait for prison planted dot
[11:43.440 --> 11:47.000]  TV to be up to air this but I think it's important that we air this now because
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.880]  Dobs is really the only one who has fair handedly reported on this document this
[11:53.880 --> 11:59.200]  lexicon document everybody else oh Odin worship come on they intertwine it with
[11:59.200 --> 12:05.320]  real bigots real racists real real you know extremist groups and then they
[12:05.320 --> 12:09.560]  just put everybody else in their hacktivism anti-technology anti-illegal
[12:09.560 --> 12:14.400]  immigration of course the patriot movement is their constitutionalists it
[12:14.400 --> 12:18.160]  goes on and on let's play the clip we got it guys roll from the Department of
[12:18.160 --> 12:22.320]  Homeland Security the same department that issued a report suggesting
[12:22.320 --> 12:27.040]  returning war veterans were susceptible to extremist groups also issuing what
[12:27.040 --> 12:33.720]  it calls the quote domestic extremism lexicon in quote it's like a dictionary
[12:33.720 --> 12:38.160]  with definitions for various extremists or a terrorist groups and some
[12:38.160 --> 12:44.000]  definitions I hear is an entry anti-immigration extremism the Department
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.080]  of Homeland Security's definition people who are quote highly critical of the
[12:49.080 --> 12:53.480]  U.S. government's response to illegal immigration and oppose government
[12:53.480 --> 12:58.800]  programs that are designed to extend rights to illegal aliens such as
[12:58.800 --> 13:04.200]  driver's licenses and in-state tuition here's another one single issue
[13:04.200 --> 13:09.560]  extremist groups according to the DHS dictionary there are individuals who
[13:09.560 --> 13:15.120]  focus on a single cause such as animal rights or the environment they are also
[13:15.120 --> 13:21.160]  described as special interest extremists and this anti-technology
[13:21.160 --> 13:27.120]  extremism also referred to as neo-luddites these apparently are
[13:27.120 --> 13:32.520]  individuals who are opposed to technology a DHS spokesperson today told us the
[13:32.520 --> 13:37.960]  dictionary was not authorized that it was recalled shortly after it was let out
[13:37.960 --> 13:43.600]  and state and local law enforcement officials have been told to ignore it
[13:43.600 --> 13:47.320]  joining me now congressman Pete King ranking member of the Homeland Security
[13:47.320 --> 13:52.040]  Committee congressman great to see you thanks for being here thank you a little
[13:52.040 --> 13:59.920]  your reaction to to this document Lou actually it's very distressing no you
[13:59.920 --> 14:03.720]  and I can have a lot of fun with this we can show how ridiculous it is how off
[14:03.720 --> 14:07.240]  target it is but the reality is the Department of Homeland Security is
[14:07.240 --> 14:11.000]  supposed to be defending us against another attack from Islamic terrorism
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.560]  that's the reason this department was created and yet it appears to be the
[14:14.560 --> 14:18.920]  gang that can't shoot straight and also to me it's missing its purpose and you
[14:18.920 --> 14:22.480]  went through all those different definitions of a different type of
[14:22.480 --> 14:27.720]  extremists nowhere in that dictionary do you see the term Islamic extremists so
[14:27.720 --> 14:32.400]  the department was set up primarily let's face it to protect us from another
[14:32.400 --> 14:37.280]  terrorist attack all right let's stop there for a second guys I want to say
[14:37.280 --> 14:41.400]  that no this document does talk about Islamic extremists but says it has
[14:41.400 --> 14:45.000]  nothing to do with them because this is for all of us in fact right here in the
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  very beginning let me go I don't have my marked copy so it may take me just a
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.960]  hot second to find it but this is for non-Islamic extremists here it is right
[14:53.960 --> 14:59.200]  here this product provides definitions of four key terms and phrases that often
[14:59.200 --> 15:05.240]  appear in DHS remember often appear in DHS analysts that address the nature and
[15:05.240 --> 15:10.680]  scope of the threat that domestic non-Islamic let's say it again domestic
[15:10.680 --> 15:16.240]  non-Islamic extremism poses to the United States so yes that is in the
[15:16.240 --> 15:21.160]  document sir did you even read this King see King I don't even want to be
[15:21.160 --> 15:24.920]  apologetic for him and really I wish you would have called him out on the tops
[15:24.920 --> 15:30.240]  this this was issued in late March so this was all over the place before it
[15:30.240 --> 15:33.480]  came out for at least a month it comes out and they say oh we're going to
[15:33.480 --> 15:37.720]  retract it it was never approved meanwhile you read on the bottom and it
[15:37.720 --> 15:42.520]  says this isn't for media use this isn't for you and me if we filed an FOIA and
[15:42.520 --> 15:47.080]  this was never released we wouldn't get to see this document until much later do
[15:47.080 --> 15:50.840]  you understand there are tons the Virginia Fusion Center one is like a
[15:50.840 --> 15:55.400]  couple hundred pages long and it tells you that they're already surveilling
[15:55.400 --> 15:58.880]  these groups in great numbers they already say that all right let's
[15:58.880 --> 16:06.040]  continue with the clip we got it and yet they talk about everything but that in
[16:06.040 --> 16:09.560]  fact the only time they've used the word terrorists since Secretary Napolitano
[16:09.560 --> 16:14.120]  Napolitano took over was you know several weeks ago when they said the
[16:14.120 --> 16:19.280]  returning veterans and anti illegal immigration organizations could be
[16:19.280 --> 16:23.280]  terrorists so this is really wrong and the fact that it's happened twice now
[16:23.280 --> 16:26.800]  shows that it's a department it's really out of control there's a tremendous
[16:26.800 --> 16:31.200]  lack of discipline here my reaction to this with two things one is this
[16:31.200 --> 16:38.480]  document again could have been produced by someone in China under Mao Zedong or
[16:38.480 --> 16:44.160]  it could have been produced in the Nixon administration this is the kind of
[16:44.160 --> 16:50.320]  egregiously offensive product coming from the agency I mean I can't even
[16:50.320 --> 16:54.920]  pronounce them I can't even string the words together that make up this
[16:54.920 --> 16:58.880]  agency what is going on with this agency we're also told by the way that some of
[16:58.880 --> 17:02.560]  the people in the agency are offended because their work has not been
[17:02.560 --> 17:08.160]  supported yeah well yeah too bad for them the fact is that this I believe is a
[17:08.160 --> 17:12.080]  unit that's gotten out of control by the way the civil rights unit within the
[17:12.080 --> 17:15.920]  department of Homeland Security had been opposed to a number of these findings
[17:15.920 --> 17:20.080]  they made and yet this unit was still able to get this report released so this
[17:20.080 --> 17:24.320]  is something that in all seriousness secretary Napolitano has to address this
[17:24.320 --> 17:27.880]  seems to be a rogue element in the department at least I hope it is I hope
[17:27.880 --> 17:31.160]  this is not to reflect the thinking of the department and what you said is
[17:31.160 --> 17:36.800]  really important I'm all right I hope it is come on King give me a break you
[17:36.800 --> 17:41.160]  can't tell you real really come on you don't think this is how many documents
[17:41.160 --> 17:44.600]  have to come out how many times they have to say somebody who is anti
[17:44.600 --> 17:50.920]  technology or alternative media or a constitutionalist or has a Ron Paul
[17:50.920 --> 17:56.880]  bumper sticker before you realize this is the new program NLE09 coming here this
[17:56.880 --> 18:03.160]  summer headed up by our good friends at FEMA to prevent terrorist attacks and
[18:03.160 --> 18:06.960]  the terrorist attack already happens overseas you see and we've got the UK
[18:06.960 --> 18:10.520]  involved we got Australian involved we got Canada involved we got Mexico
[18:10.520 --> 18:15.240]  involved the private sector is going to be involved all state local federal
[18:15.240 --> 18:20.000]  tribal regions are going to be involved it's going to be a mass spying exercise
[18:20.000 --> 18:25.440]  and let me tell you Russia has gotten hip to the exercise game I'm not applauding
[18:25.440 --> 18:30.200]  Russia but last year when they were attacked by Georgia the south those
[18:30.200 --> 18:34.760]  said he a sneak attack everybody was blaming Russia Russia's Russia attacked
[18:34.760 --> 18:38.840]  Georgia oh my god these they're they're ruthless I can't believe it what was
[18:38.840 --> 18:43.880]  really happening is they were running drills on the border with international
[18:43.880 --> 18:47.720]  forces I think including Israelis and American blackwater I think for some of
[18:47.720 --> 18:52.240]  the reports they saw basically blackwater dead bodies there they go kill
[18:52.240 --> 18:56.840]  some people in a sneak attack on south those city of a force rushes hand and
[18:56.840 --> 19:01.000]  everybody blames Russia now I've been reporting on the info warrior that NATO
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.560]  was going to begin war games in Georgia remember Georgia desperately wants to be
[19:05.560 --> 19:09.800]  a part of NATO they've been trying to get NATO into NATO for some time now and
[19:09.800 --> 19:15.320]  they had the third largest commitment of troops in the war on terror over in
[19:15.320 --> 19:20.280]  Iraq and Afghanistan so they're really buddy buddy with us and Russia was
[19:20.280 --> 19:24.940]  throwing a fit I mean throwing a fit saying hey we don't want these war
[19:24.940 --> 19:29.400]  games there's all these protests and now there's a story today where is it in my
[19:29.400 --> 19:39.760]  little stakeroo? Georgia accuses Russia over foiled rebellion you see it's a big
[19:39.760 --> 19:43.320]  propaganda game they're holding the drills they're the ones threatening
[19:43.320 --> 19:46.880]  Russia's sovereignty and Russia's the bad guy and that's what the media will

[25:52.280 --> 25:58.160]  think this is a yes Reuters Georgia said it put down a mutiny at a military base
[25:58.160 --> 26:02.600]  on Tuesday in accused Moscow of trying to ferment a wider rebellion on the eve
[26:02.600 --> 26:07.400]  of NATO war games in the former Soviet Republic Russia Russia which fought a
[26:07.400 --> 26:12.560]  war with neighboring Georgia last year then I'd see always in the beginning of
[26:12.560 --> 26:16.280]  the article they're like they fought a war with Georgia later in the article
[26:16.280 --> 26:19.760]  they actually admit oh it was Georgia who snuck attacks South Ossetia we'll get
[26:19.760 --> 26:24.680]  to that in a moment but it's just it's disgusting how they disguise it denied
[26:24.680 --> 26:29.200]  involvement said uh president Sakasvili was trying to shift the blame for weeks
[26:29.200 --> 26:32.800]  of opposition protest demanding he resigned around 30 tanks and armored
[26:32.800 --> 26:38.480]  personnel carriers entered the Mukheravani tank base 19 kilometers from
[26:38.480 --> 26:42.360]  the Bissell I'm sorry if I'm getting these wrongs I'm just a I'm just an
[26:42.360 --> 26:46.680]  ignorant American folks about three hours after news broke of military uprising
[26:46.680 --> 26:50.680]  Sakasvili later followed them and authorities said the rebellion
[26:50.680 --> 26:54.880]  was over it is not clear how many of the 500 soldiers at the base were
[26:54.880 --> 26:58.320]  involved but the commander was arrested along with seven other military police
[26:58.320 --> 27:03.240]  officers three others are on the run said police who detained 13 civilians
[27:03.240 --> 27:08.480]  they're saying the Pentagon saying this is an isolated incident and let's see
[27:08.480 --> 27:13.120]  here's where they actually admit oh by the way it was Georgia who was in the
[27:13.120 --> 27:17.960]  wrong in the first case last summer see I remember I was subbing on Alex Jones
[27:17.960 --> 27:21.800]  that day as well when the news broke and everybody's like Russia's invading
[27:21.800 --> 27:24.760]  Georgia Russia's invading Georgia and Tarpley had been talking about a
[27:24.760 --> 27:30.320]  conflict with Georgia or Georgia and Russia and us and we didn't fully
[27:30.320 --> 27:32.840]  understand at that point we kind of brought bought into the propaganda and
[27:32.840 --> 27:35.560]  then you see these drills are running you find out oh it's the other way around
[27:35.560 --> 27:39.400]  here's where they admit it Georgia lost a brief war against neighboring Russia
[27:39.400 --> 27:45.400]  last August when Russia crushed in days a Georgian assault on the rebel pro
[27:45.400 --> 27:51.080]  Moscow region of South Ossetia see that crushed in days a Georgian assault do
[27:51.080 --> 27:54.600]  you understand they were defending themselves they were stopping civilian
[27:54.600 --> 28:00.920]  murders is that a bad thing again I'm no Putin fan I know the deal he's KGB FSB
[28:00.920 --> 28:06.920]  you bet he's total new world order he's in on the plan but at the same time he's
[28:06.920 --> 28:12.120]  resisting what NATO is trying to impose on him and I can understand that so I
[28:12.120 --> 28:15.400]  think it's a it's worth covering let's see where that goes these drills are
[28:15.400 --> 28:18.600]  going on who knows we have another breakout in that region you could see
[28:18.600 --> 28:23.640]  another small hot war I could see that going on meanwhile here at home we're
[28:23.640 --> 28:27.560]  just gonna give the bankers more money you gotta love that Obama man I'm
[28:27.560 --> 28:31.800]  watching the TV and people are just all we love him so much and everybody's so
[28:31.800 --> 28:35.000]  full though he's getting that he's getting a burger with Joey Bay look at
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.560]  that he's a regular dude huh mustard on his burger died like that that's a
[28:39.560 --> 28:44.000]  little different I go with ketchup but Obama he goes with mustard he's a good
[28:44.000 --> 28:49.280]  guy and I'm sitting there and then he pulls the really clever joke oh no it
[28:49.280 --> 28:52.640]  can't be on the house you see all these reporters here oh they'll do big stories
[28:52.640 --> 28:57.240]  here just take some of the taxpayers money I'm already giving billions upon
[28:57.240 --> 29:02.680]  billions to the banks soon we're gonna give all sorts of tax breaks to these
[29:02.680 --> 29:07.200]  newspapers apparently they're gonna make them non-profit organizations further
[29:07.200 --> 29:12.400]  government control here it is right here Obama budget keeps 250 billion
[29:12.400 --> 29:16.640]  dollar placeholder for banks the detailed version of President Barack
[29:16.640 --> 29:21.120]  Obama's budget unveiled on Thursday maintains a 250 billion dollar placeholder
[29:21.120 --> 29:29.160]  for additional finance rescue efforts so even more tarp money on top of what
[29:29.160 --> 29:33.560]  they're saying is 3.5 trillion here it's much more we know the da the real
[29:33.560 --> 29:37.880]  number is got to be around 9 10 11 trillion that by now we got to get to
[29:37.880 --> 29:41.800]  Bloomberg they at least tell some of the truth we'll be back after this it's the

[33:30.520 --> 33:34.880]  stand for liberty and we'll save the Republic so help our God that's the
[33:34.880 --> 33:38.800]  motto not on our watch and we really need this at a time that they're putting
[33:38.800 --> 33:42.280]  out all these documents from this document is from late March so it was
[33:42.280 --> 33:45.800]  already in circulation for over a month before it broke and it's going after the
[33:45.800 --> 33:49.640]  alternative media it's going after the patriot movement it's going after gun
[33:49.640 --> 33:55.120]  owners anti illegal immigration people I mean it's absolutely ridiculous and we
[33:55.120 --> 33:59.920]  are honored to have somebody like Stuart Rhodes trying to enlighten his fellow
[33:59.920 --> 34:02.880]  military officers and peace officers thanks for joining us
[34:02.880 --> 34:10.160]  good man so why don't you tell people about your upcoming event the gathering
[34:10.160 --> 34:15.960]  of eagles well what what that is it's a big rally in June in June 13th and June
[34:15.960 --> 34:20.200]  13th in the mall in DC and it's being put on by gathering of eagles it's more
[34:20.200 --> 34:23.280]  than mainstream conservative organization and they put in this big rally on
[34:23.280 --> 34:29.200]  but they in turn invited us keepers and they're characterizing it as a victory
[34:29.200 --> 34:33.240]  in Iraq rally I know it's gonna raise the hackles of some of your listeners but
[34:33.240 --> 34:37.200]  the point is is we're going there is outreach and my goal is to like you
[34:37.200 --> 34:40.680]  said is to reach every single person has ever taken a vote to defend the
[34:40.680 --> 34:45.560]  Constitution current serving military especially and you've got guys who are
[34:45.560 --> 34:49.080]  in Iraq right now in Afghanistan right now and the last thing I want to do is
[34:49.080 --> 34:53.040]  shut them down by by throwing in their face you know oh we don't like the war
[34:53.040 --> 34:56.360]  and think of things so we're going there is outreach only we say neutral on the
[34:56.360 --> 35:01.560]  Iraq war we've got dedicated patriots on both side of that issue so you know
[35:01.560 --> 35:04.640]  maybe some folks might think the cop out of me to say that but I don't think it's
[35:04.640 --> 35:07.560]  a cop out number one we're not here to preach to the choir we're trying to get
[35:07.560 --> 35:10.800]  as many people involved as possible and I always tell people that you're trying
[35:10.800 --> 35:14.280]  to find common ground with somebody so you can show them something which leads
[35:14.280 --> 35:17.640]  them to another thing so you can bring them around to what's really going on
[35:17.640 --> 35:20.800]  in the bigger picture it definitely doesn't happen overnight it takes months
[35:20.800 --> 35:24.920]  sometimes years to come to grips with what's really going on and really things
[35:24.920 --> 35:29.000]  come at such a rapid pace to keep up on the news I mean you literally have to be
[35:29.000 --> 35:32.880]  Alex Jones or Jason Burma's and do this for a living I mean we're on our third
[35:32.880 --> 35:37.080]  DHS document in less than a month that's not including the myac report that's
[35:37.080 --> 35:41.920]  not including you know the NLE 09 exercise we've we've exposed that's not
[35:41.920 --> 35:47.120]  including this WHO pandemic paper where they say you know what there is no
[35:47.120 --> 35:50.480]  Constitution there is no Bill of Rights if we go to level 6 you know we have to
[35:50.480 --> 35:55.480]  cover executive order 13 375 which says if we go to level 6 you have to take the
[35:55.480 --> 36:01.040]  vaccination or you can do a year in prison and a $250,000 fine I mean let's
[36:01.040 --> 36:05.360]  talk about that let's say you know the fear mongering works we get to level 6
[36:05.360 --> 36:09.600]  and there are literally troops of vaccinating us and if we don't take it
[36:09.600 --> 36:13.560]  we're going to prison or paying a fine I mean how it should how should that
[36:13.560 --> 36:18.920]  soldiers military police how should they respond to that well the business
[36:18.920 --> 36:22.640]  thing is is martial law under our Constitution just you can look in the
[36:22.640 --> 36:26.440]  Constitution there's nowhere in there there's no escape clause for government
[36:26.440 --> 36:30.000]  we don't have a counterpart to in the German Constitution they had an escape
[36:30.000 --> 36:33.440]  clause but forget what it's called now but but they had a they had a provision
[36:33.440 --> 36:36.200]  in there that says that you know under certain circumstances they can suspend
[36:36.200 --> 36:39.280]  the Constitution we don't have that counterpart the closest thing to it
[36:39.280 --> 36:42.560]  would be the habeas suspension clause but even that is not an absolute
[36:42.560 --> 36:46.160]  suspension of the Constitution it is one of them to detain you temporarily if
[36:46.160 --> 36:49.800]  Congress declares a suspension but here you're talking about where's the law
[36:49.800 --> 36:53.160]  there's no law that's been enacted and even if there were a lot of that's
[36:53.160 --> 36:57.840]  enacted in your statute can't suspend the Constitution so my response to that
[36:57.840 --> 37:00.560]  would be it's it's a legitimate if there's any kind of quarantine that's
[37:00.560 --> 37:04.800]  put in place this should be done by the state governor using national guard
[37:04.800 --> 37:09.920]  troops in that state only and if there's no law in that state that mandates
[37:09.920 --> 37:14.480]  inoculation you know they can't do it so I mean you tend to be a supercincts
[37:14.480 --> 37:18.360]  per question about whether that law is valid itself but but the threshold the
[37:18.360 --> 37:22.000]  threshold point is you can't just say well you know by executive order under
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.520]  certain circumstances we can just do whatever we want no way you can't do
[37:25.520 --> 37:29.280]  that well I mean you know this administration and the last one they're
[37:29.280 --> 37:32.640]  still feeding off patriot acts one two parts of three that they passed and
[37:32.640 --> 37:36.720]  especially the military commissions act I think of oh for where they officially
[37:36.720 --> 37:40.600]  really ended habeas corpus in this country and they're really blurring the
[37:40.600 --> 37:44.880]  lines between a posicomitatus by having the national guard come in and all
[37:44.880 --> 37:49.360]  sorts of things to fight crime now to go after marijuana growers I mean a they're
[37:49.360 --> 37:53.600]  really trying to introduce a police state here at home in my opinion
[37:53.600 --> 37:57.960]  well even more basic than the statutes all of those statutes you just talked
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.120]  about were just reactions and justifications for what they had
[38:02.120 --> 38:05.960]  already been a serving was an inherent power of the president before the
[38:05.960 --> 38:09.720]  military commissions act which was already detain people as any combatants
[38:09.720 --> 38:13.280]  without any inaction by congressmen and the argument but from the left was is
[38:13.280 --> 38:16.760]  all you don't have it's you know separation the power you don't have any
[38:16.760 --> 38:19.200]  opposition from Congress and so he wouldn't got that that's what the
[38:19.200 --> 38:22.840]  military commissions act is and so that they passed that and said basically you
[38:22.840 --> 38:27.480]  know shut the you know what up you wanted you wanted some opposition from
[38:27.480 --> 38:30.720]  Congress here it is and in the thing goes with the opposition for use of
[38:30.720 --> 38:33.960]  military force that allowed the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq that
[38:33.960 --> 38:38.080]  declared war that was just another of stamping from Congress of the asserted
[38:38.080 --> 38:42.080]  power the senior chair executive power which which they claim they didn't need
[38:42.080 --> 38:45.160]  Congress for and so Congress would become kind of like a little you know
[38:45.160 --> 38:50.240]  debating society and number stamp but the but the greatest threat to us is the
[38:50.240 --> 38:54.040]  idea as you pointed out a minute ago the idea that the president can just set
[38:54.040 --> 38:58.160]  aside the Constitution war time or or just as I did below right today some kind
[38:58.160 --> 39:02.880]  of inherent power but of it elected dictator and folks are waking up now
[39:02.880 --> 39:07.200]  back to the back to the current serving military I think the latest release
[39:07.200 --> 39:12.280]  reports from DHS are the best red pill because they are waking up the
[39:12.280 --> 39:16.840]  military current serving and veterans of what is going on because they're being
[39:16.840 --> 39:20.840]  painted as threats and these people are getting pissed you look I'm gonna post
[39:20.840 --> 39:25.320]  here a little while on our site some videos we found YouTube of veterans and
[39:25.320 --> 39:29.280]  current serve military saying you know you can send me a threat oh okay look
[39:29.280 --> 39:32.280]  if I'm a threat keep my threat to anybody it's because don't look to you
[39:32.280 --> 39:35.600]  because you were destroying the Constitution and so it's backfiring on
[39:35.600 --> 39:39.200]  them the more they try to suppress and show our speech I'm making us afraid to
[39:39.200 --> 39:42.760]  be on a list the more these people are stepping up and saying you know what I'll
[39:42.760 --> 39:46.120]  be ready to run camera and tell you you know if you did your face the
[39:46.120 --> 39:50.400]  Polatino yeah yeah absolutely and you know it is a good thing that we do have
[39:50.400 --> 39:53.880]  people on the inside that are exposing these documents and sending them to
[39:53.880 --> 39:57.400]  outlets like this one and making them public because you know they're
[39:57.400 --> 40:02.240]  acting like oh this document was never approved or authorized yet it's from
[40:02.240 --> 40:07.320]  late March if you read the the clause right here at the bottom it says that
[40:07.320 --> 40:11.440]  this is not for public release they said this is outside of the media or other
[40:11.440 --> 40:15.320]  personnel who don't have the the proper clearance they say that you can file an
[40:15.320 --> 40:19.360]  FOIA request and still be refused for this document and then you go through
[40:19.360 --> 40:22.680]  this broad range I mean let's go over some of the more ridiculous ones
[40:22.680 --> 40:27.840]  alternative media anti-abortion extremism anti-immigration extremism
[40:27.840 --> 40:33.320]  anti-technology extremism I mean anti-technology give me a break the
[40:33.320 --> 40:38.040]  stuff that and it's all lumped in with like Aryan nation and all these real
[40:38.040 --> 40:42.880]  hate groups but at the same time hacktivism hacktivism I mean give me
[40:42.880 --> 40:46.800]  that's basically using a computer for a come up for a political goal well we do
[40:46.800 --> 40:51.040]  that every day here at prison planet info wars we broadcast live not only over
[40:51.040 --> 40:55.120]  the radio but we do I think it's what five hours of video a day video
[40:55.120 --> 41:00.280]  reporting is that hacktivism I mean it's crazy to me they go after left-wing
[41:00.280 --> 41:05.160]  extremism right-wing extremism the militias loan terrorists leaderless
[41:05.160 --> 41:08.360]  resistance leaderless resistance is so broad let's just read that for a second
[41:08.360 --> 41:12.640]  a strategy that stresses the importance of individuals and small cells acting
[41:12.640 --> 41:16.720]  independently anonymously outside formalized organizational structures to
[41:16.720 --> 41:21.160]  enhance operational security and avoid detection it is used by many types of
[41:21.160 --> 41:26.040]  domestic extremists so in other words if they can't pin you down to a group they
[41:26.040 --> 41:30.840]  don't like they'll just say you're a leaderless resistant and classify you as
[41:30.840 --> 41:36.360]  a terrorist anyway it's insanity it's about the lexicon right yes it's a
[41:36.360 --> 41:39.800]  lexicon document but the first thing I noticed about that being a lawyer is I
[41:39.800 --> 41:42.760]  look at the definition and the first definition they give is what it was an
[41:42.760 --> 41:47.680]  extremist and extremist they say is a person who uses violence or the
[41:47.680 --> 41:52.480]  further violence or breaks the law in further to a political goal that's also
[41:52.480 --> 41:57.520]  the very common definition of terrorism and so what they're saying is it they
[41:57.520 --> 42:00.560]  label you an extremist really calling you a terrorism and then they take that
[42:00.560 --> 42:04.800]  term extremist they apply to all of the subgroups militias and the definition
[42:04.800 --> 42:07.920]  of militia it's an extremist organization that believes in the right
[42:07.920 --> 42:11.840]  to seek you know that forms of some militias the Second Amendment but you're
[42:11.840 --> 42:15.120]  already an extremist you're already a terrorist here's what flavor of terrorist
[42:15.120 --> 42:18.800]  are you well you're a militia terrorist or you're an environmental terrorist or
[42:18.800 --> 42:23.440]  you're a anti-abortion terrorist or you're an anti-immigration terrorist you
[42:23.440 --> 42:26.000]  see I'm saying so they've already given you a label extremist which is
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.520]  equivalent to terrorist and then and then they have below militias they've got
[42:29.520 --> 42:33.360]  the other definitions down there to like the also known as and one of them is
[42:33.360 --> 42:37.400]  constitutionalist and so you're a constitutionalist what you are is a
[42:37.400 --> 42:43.040]  militia terrorist it's really absurd if it just makes it so that everybody in
[42:43.040 --> 42:45.840]  this country what they're trying to do is what Stalin did in Germany
[42:45.840 --> 42:49.200]  I mean Stalin did in the Soviet Union what Hitler did in Germany which is
[42:49.200 --> 42:52.640]  make everyone afraid that they will be labeled as an enemy of the state and
[42:52.640 --> 42:56.400]  anyone can be you said so vague and so overbroad that anyone can be an enemy
[42:56.400 --> 43:00.720]  in the state and so they want you to cower in fear and shut the hell up
[43:00.720 --> 43:04.960]  don't speak out don't act to sit at home and wait and hopefully you're not
[43:04.960 --> 43:08.640]  picked out that's what they want you to do but this is not this is not Russia
[43:08.640 --> 43:12.160]  we're not Russian peasants we're not Chinese peasants this is America we're
[43:12.160 --> 43:15.400]  Americans and we're not going to do it we're going to stand up that's why I
[43:15.400 --> 43:19.720]  want folks to come come with us on July 13th at the DC forget about what took
[43:19.720 --> 43:23.600]  about the Iraq war go there on the mall with us we're going to stand there and
[43:23.600 --> 43:27.640]  our theme for the Oath Keepers when we go there is I'm going to have everybody in
[43:27.640 --> 43:31.720]  that audience I hope raise their right hand and swear over or reaffirm their
[43:31.720 --> 43:34.480]  oath to the family constitution and whether they've taken over for their
[43:34.480 --> 43:37.760]  wife or not they could come join us and take that oath and want to do it right
[43:37.760 --> 43:42.200]  there and our theme is going to be we're going to shout our oath in the tyrant's
[43:42.200 --> 43:46.520]  face because we're going to make them understand that this is not like
[43:46.520 --> 43:50.560]  Germany and not like Russia or China we're not going down that same road we
[43:50.560 --> 43:54.480]  are different yeah and it's great that it's going to be out in DC I can't wait
[43:54.480 --> 43:57.640]  to see how that comes about and what what else is really interesting about this
[43:57.640 --> 44:00.840]  document is how the media is treated it really dobs is the only one that's
[44:00.840 --> 44:05.240]  reported on it any type of fair you know I read the Washington Times report on
[44:05.240 --> 44:09.040]  it and they mainly stick to the real extremist stuff and then the goofy stuff
[44:09.040 --> 44:12.920]  like Odin worship and it's a big joke they never mention a patriot movement they
[44:12.920 --> 44:17.000]  never mentioned the fact that they say constitutionalists or people who believe
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.320]  in the Constitution they never mention the alternative media especially because
[44:21.320 --> 44:24.320]  we're threatening them on many levels I mean a lot of these places are going out
[44:24.320 --> 44:27.760]  of business the New York Times is crying that the Boston Globe isn't making a
[44:27.760 --> 44:32.320]  profit and they need to shut down and now the Senate is now going to look into
[44:32.320 --> 44:35.440]  legislation where they're nonprofit organizations and they get a bunch of
[44:35.440 --> 44:39.000]  tax breaks it's not bad enough that the media is so heavily intertwined with the
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.280]  government at this point we've got to take it a step further they're too big
[44:42.280 --> 44:46.120]  to fail you know let's give a bailout to the media I mean it's disgusting the
[44:46.120 --> 44:51.600]  same people that just continually lie and manipulate us on behalf of you know
[44:51.600 --> 44:54.760]  really the puppet masters above the government and you were talking about
[44:54.760 --> 45:00.040]  how the president really isn't above you know the rest of Congress and the
[45:00.040 --> 45:03.880]  Senate people don't understand that we have check what we used to have checks
[45:03.880 --> 45:06.880]  and balances in this country and that there are three branches of government
[45:06.880 --> 45:10.680]  judicial executive and legislative and they're supposed to keep each other in
[45:10.680 --> 45:13.960]  check it's a separation of powers can you just go over that really quickly
[45:13.960 --> 45:17.960]  well we need more basic depression powers the bill of rights and I don't care
[45:17.960 --> 45:20.720]  if Congress gives them a rubber stamp I mean Congress Congress in military
[45:20.720 --> 45:25.200]  commissions act Congress said okay yes we're gonna authorize you to to wipe
[45:25.200 --> 45:28.960]  out habeas corpus and but does not trump the bill of rights so but you're
[45:28.960 --> 45:32.040]  rubbing you know the separation power is important but even more important than
[45:32.040 --> 45:36.040]  that is limitations on on the powers of the federal government it is you know as
[45:36.040 --> 45:39.560]  as Ron Paul always said if it's not a numerated oracle one section eight they
[45:39.560 --> 45:42.080]  don't have the power to do it I don't care if all for all three branches of
[45:42.080 --> 45:45.760]  federal government agree there's a and the bill of rights is our shield and so
[45:45.760 --> 45:48.560]  what's happened though is it's the whether it's unitary executive claim
[45:48.560 --> 45:52.520]  that the president could do it on its own or whether it's a conjunction
[45:52.520 --> 45:56.600]  to hoots with the other two branches giving him authority never granted the
[45:56.600 --> 46:00.480]  Constitution it's it's all a destruction of the bill of rights you know I
[46:00.480 --> 46:04.000]  mean even combatants as it is the most blatant example in the claim that he
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.160]  can just detain you without trial with an indictment and hold your military
[46:08.160 --> 46:12.040]  break for years that's happened to us citizens and people were like oh it's
[46:12.040 --> 46:15.320]  okay they're true they're muslims who cares about that well the thing is it
[46:15.320 --> 46:19.720]  is the court didn't say this is this is a rule that applies to muslim citizens
[46:19.720 --> 46:24.360]  it is said that you know it in the court's Supreme Court case Homney in 2004
[46:24.360 --> 46:28.560]  you know the court said no that any american citizen can be detained as an
[46:28.560 --> 46:32.560]  anti-combat that's what they said you know in this latest dhs document
[46:32.560 --> 46:36.120]  specifically says let me read the sentence right in the first right in the
[46:36.120 --> 46:39.000]  first page the first section this product provides definitions for key
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.840]  terms and phrases that often often appear in dhs analysts that address
[46:43.840 --> 46:48.280]  definitions let's say you know the nature and scope of the threat that
[46:48.280 --> 46:53.920]  domestic non-islamic extremism poses to the united states so this document is
[46:53.920 --> 46:58.640]  all about non-islamic extremism I hope that people get it this has nothing to
[46:58.640 --> 47:03.440]  do with al-ciyeda and the Taliban and the fact that we're over in Iraq and
[47:03.440 --> 47:06.240]  Afghanistan and we're not getting out I mean this president said he was gonna
[47:06.240 --> 47:10.040]  pull us out first in 16 months and then he said 24 months and now he's saying
[47:10.040 --> 47:15.080]  well we'll have 50,000 non-combat troops there till the end of 2011 and take it
[47:15.080 --> 47:19.480]  from there meanwhile they redistribute forces into Afghanistan and say that's a
[47:19.480 --> 47:24.120]  hot war again I mean do you see us getting out of the Middle East anytime soon
[47:24.120 --> 47:28.000]  and you know if so how
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.280]  no I don't think it will happen in
[47:30.280 --> 47:35.000]  Obama anymore than what happened under under Bush but but back to what you're
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.400]  talking about a second ago I mean it was it was the pretext always was it
[47:39.400 --> 47:42.600]  always has been throughout history you know the foreign enemy of foreign threat
[47:42.600 --> 47:47.200]  but then once it's put in place this is exactly what happens it is turned
[47:47.200 --> 47:51.360]  inward like you said that these latest DHS reports don't say squat about
[47:51.360 --> 47:56.240]  Middle Eastern terrorism or threats from abroad they talk about us and that's
[47:56.240 --> 47:59.400]  what the focus is and it's turned inward and this is what I tried to warn
[47:59.400 --> 48:03.160]  conservatives for for the entire time when Bush was in power I kept warning them
[48:03.160 --> 48:06.280]  to look one of these days the shoes gonna be on the other foot and it doesn't
[48:06.280 --> 48:09.120]  matter whether it's a left foot or a right boot what counts as whether the
[48:09.120 --> 48:11.880]  boot of the back of your neck and a lot of them wouldn't listen well now they're
[48:11.880 --> 48:15.520]  starting to wake up and that's that's why with those keepers we're getting such a
[48:15.520 --> 48:19.600]  huge response from from people who would have were asleep during bush are now
[48:19.600 --> 48:23.320]  waking up and realizing that oh crap I mean they can apply it to me a real
[48:23.320 --> 48:26.560]  American you know today thank you what about a real American they can play the
[48:26.560 --> 48:30.240]  real Americans and my answer is always well what is a real American you know
[48:30.240 --> 48:34.560]  so yes they don't see any difference these people have no in their mind they
[48:34.560 --> 48:38.400]  have no no concept of the separation between you and a foreign enemy they
[48:38.400 --> 48:41.520]  want to treat you like a foreign enemy and so that's that's where we are but
[48:41.520 --> 48:45.960]  as far as the question for Iraq and Afghanistan I don't think we're gonna
[48:45.960 --> 48:49.160]  be out of there anytime soon or later well you think we're gonna have an
[48:49.160 --> 48:54.240]  expansion I mean right now I you know I broke the story about a month ago Iran
[48:54.240 --> 48:57.680]  said that they were gonna help us in the war on drugs in Afghanistan yeah they're
[48:57.680 --> 49:01.560]  gonna stop the opium fields there laugh out loud and then on the other hand a
[49:01.560 --> 49:05.800]  couple days ago they just bombed a few Iraqi villages do you think they're
[49:05.800 --> 49:10.640]  coming in as an ally now with this you know left-leaning administration oh what
[49:10.640 --> 49:14.720]  do you think Iran's role is gonna be in the next few years you know I don't know
[49:14.720 --> 49:18.600]  it's hard to say I mean really it really is I mean the way I look at the whole
[49:18.600 --> 49:21.040]  Middle Eastern problem is that we should have just turned it all over to the
[49:21.040 --> 49:26.040]  Arab League in the first place you know I mean after after I've been beating Iraq
[49:26.040 --> 49:28.640]  the best thing they could have done is turn towards the Arab League and said
[49:28.640 --> 49:33.080]  here this is you guys are a bitch about us being there so here it is it's yours
[49:33.080 --> 49:37.080]  now you have the resources you have the ability and was about 12 13 countries in
[49:37.080 --> 49:41.080]  the Arab League they could have taken it to the family so I think the it's kind
[49:41.080 --> 49:43.920]  of like trying to ask me what's the solution to the Iraqi Palestinian or
[49:43.920 --> 49:49.520]  the Israeli Palestinian situation good luck what's the solution get out of there
[49:49.520 --> 49:53.640]  and let them handle themselves is my is my solution but I would have turned over
[49:53.640 --> 49:57.480]  the Arab League because there's a problem with invading Iraq I don't want
[49:57.480 --> 50:00.080]  too much into this way so we try to stay officially neutral but the problem
[50:00.080 --> 50:05.240]  one is they they created a vacuum there you need to cut a second dictator and he
[50:05.240 --> 50:08.200]  created a vacuum they disbanded the army that did everything stupid they
[50:08.200 --> 50:12.920]  possibly could have done to be stabilized place and now you allow it with that
[50:12.920 --> 50:16.680]  vacuum you got former former Iraqi military running around jobless what
[50:16.680 --> 50:19.760]  are they gonna do and then you then you got an occupying military who they're
[50:19.760 --> 50:23.800]  gonna resent and and then if you leave now they're worried that well now no
[50:23.800 --> 50:27.840]  Iran will come in you know you get the Sunnis and Shiites and that perpetual
[50:27.840 --> 50:31.280]  struggle within his law itself and so like I said I would turn over to the
[50:31.280 --> 50:37.960]  Arab League and walk away the website is stewart-roads.blogspot.com and we're
[50:37.960 --> 50:40.840]  gonna come back with them in the final segment and see what you can do if you
[50:40.840 --> 50:44.400]  can't get to the gathering of Eagle events in DC this summer perhaps there's
[50:44.400 --> 50:47.600]  another way to contribute and I'm sure there is we'll be back after this it's

[54:09.320 --> 54:14.080]  your mind alright folks we are back at the Alex Jones show Alex actually going
[54:14.080 --> 54:20.160]  to pop in in about 35 minutes he's got a few stories to break with us and
[54:20.160 --> 54:24.480]  before we go back to Stuart Rhodes I want to tell you go help over at Stuart
[54:24.480 --> 54:28.000]  dash roads dot blogspot.com hopefully he'll give us a couple other websites
[54:28.000 --> 54:32.160]  and ways to help he's going to be at the gathering of the Eagles in DC this
[54:32.160 --> 54:36.280]  summer and I also want to get your take before you go on the Tennessee governor
[54:36.280 --> 54:41.720]  putting troops on the road over at the Kentucky Derby you got the floor okay
[54:41.720 --> 54:46.760]  so what they want to clarify is our actual block for the oath keepers is is
[54:46.760 --> 54:52.400]  oath dash keepers dot blogspot.com both hyphen keepers the one you gave a
[54:52.400 --> 54:56.080]  minute ago is my personal blog which is kind of dormant right now that's a
[54:56.080 --> 55:01.160]  focused on our keepers and the rally is in June 13th and it's being put on with
[55:01.160 --> 55:05.200]  the gathering of the Eagles but the website for it is pro troop events dot
[55:05.200 --> 55:09.160]  com and but like I said just just just remember folks we're going there as
[55:09.160 --> 55:13.480]  outreach and so don't get don't get all twisted up because it's a it's kind of a
[55:13.480 --> 55:17.720]  pro at rack war rally but we're going there as outreach as you said before you
[55:17.720 --> 55:21.480]  have to reach out to people even if you disagree with them on something and we
[55:21.480 --> 55:25.000]  say neutral we've got guys who are dedicated Patriots who are still you
[55:25.000 --> 55:30.080]  know still there in Iraq or Afghanistan who are part of both keepers and they're
[55:30.080 --> 55:33.680]  emotionally tied up with it and we've got guys who are old old Vietnam veterans
[55:33.680 --> 55:37.680]  who are dead city kids and very outspoken and so we just try to stay
[55:37.680 --> 55:43.440]  officially neutral so so what we do by the Tennessee thing about yeah yeah searching
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.640]  people out there at the Kentucky Derby is very American this is part of the
[55:47.640 --> 55:50.440]  conditioning that's been going on for years as you announced the pointing out
[55:50.440 --> 55:54.440]  quite a long time and it's very disturbing and the whole point of it is
[55:54.440 --> 55:59.080]  to break down and condition both the troops and us so the concept and idea
[55:59.080 --> 56:04.320]  that that it's okay to have federal troops on our streets you know helping
[56:04.320 --> 56:08.440]  the ladies cross the street or whatever it is it's part of conditioning and I
[56:08.440 --> 56:12.520]  think it's pretty dangerous what about the national level exercise oh nine
[56:12.520 --> 56:15.600]  that FEMA is about to conduct this summer I believe it's the last week of
[56:15.600 --> 56:19.680]  July into the first week of August have you seen this document yet no I haven't
[56:19.680 --> 56:23.120]  but I knew they were gonna conduct a training but tell me about this well
[56:23.120 --> 56:26.920]  well let me tell you something this one is is off the charts preventing terrorist
[56:26.920 --> 56:31.200]  attack it's going to involve all state local federal tribal and it's going to
[56:31.200 --> 56:37.920]  involve the UK Australia Mexico and Canada and the region six and you know
[56:37.920 --> 56:43.120]  this one I think is really you know it's not only to acclimate the public but
[56:43.120 --> 56:46.880]  it's also to get all these agencies used to working with with each other and you
[56:46.880 --> 56:49.920]  know accepting big brother essentially because they're gonna be sharing all
[56:49.920 --> 56:53.680]  sorts of information they're gonna bring in private institutions I wouldn't be
[56:53.680 --> 56:56.880]  surprised if we saw NATO forces involved with this drill and it's going to be
[56:56.880 --> 57:02.280]  massive right well this I mean we knew they were going to be doing training this
[57:02.280 --> 57:08.840]  summer for potential disruption from an economic collapse and the training was
[57:08.840 --> 57:12.440]  going to be focused on bringing in foreign troops we've heard this through
[57:12.440 --> 57:16.080]  the great line from law enforcement officers and so this is the public face
[57:16.080 --> 57:20.640]  of that what's going on behind the scenes though is it this is not for
[57:20.640 --> 57:26.320]  terrorist attacks it's for it is it you know the second level of excuse is for
[57:26.320 --> 57:30.920]  an economic collapse and so that's what that's what's really all about and of
[57:30.920 --> 57:35.040]  course that could even be a pretext as you know so this is just more of the
[57:35.040 --> 57:39.120]  same there's no provision in our Constitution allows martial law there's
[57:39.120 --> 57:42.400]  no provision in our Constitution allows them to bring in foreign troops using
[57:42.400 --> 57:46.720]  against us if they do that that's going to be an act of war and frankly that's
[57:46.720 --> 57:50.320]  one of the dumbest things they could possibly do I mean to me all this stuff
[57:50.320 --> 57:52.960]  they're doing is just blowing up in their face I don't know if it's if it's
[57:52.960 --> 57:56.280]  some kind of diabolical long-term plan or if they're just really that that
[57:56.280 --> 57:59.960]  autistic when it comes to to how the American people are going to react we're
[57:59.960 --> 58:02.320]  not going to put up with this and last thing last thing is should everything
[58:02.320 --> 58:05.800]  about doing is putting foreign troops in our soil you know yeah but they've done
[58:05.800 --> 58:09.400]  it before and you know Alex Jones exposed it I'm talking about I'm talking
[58:09.400 --> 58:12.600]  about really do you know pull on I guess they've been training and things like
[58:12.600 --> 58:15.680]  that I'm talking about you know blue helmets running around in your streets
[58:15.680 --> 58:19.920]  with with our personal carriers and in searching house to house we'll see how
[58:19.920 --> 58:23.520]  big this drill goes because it looks massive I encourage you to go check out
[58:23.520 --> 58:29.280]  the national level exercise oh nine it's Stuart Rhodes it's oath slash dash

[59:47.640 --> 1:00:05.280]  storable food waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big
[1:00:05.280 --> 1:00:12.120]  brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.120 --> 1:00:19.640]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.640 --> 1:00:24.880]  Alex Jones all right ladies and gentlemen we are back up subbing in for
[1:00:24.880 --> 1:00:32.320]  Alex Alex will be with us in about 30 minutes to break a big story I can't say
[1:00:32.320 --> 1:00:36.960]  what it is but there are stories up on prison planet and info wars that are
[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:41.080]  breaking right now such as this one House bypasses governor's veto to claim
[1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:44.720]  Oklahoma sovereignty although governor Brad Henry vetoed similar
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:48.120]  legislation 10 days early remember the sovereign citizen movement in this
[1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:54.760]  late latest DHS document you're a terrorist sorry anyway approved a
[1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:58.880]  resolution claiming Oklahoma sovereignty unlike House joint resolution
[1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:04.400]  1003 house current concurrent resolution 1028 does not need the
[1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:09.360]  governor's approval the house passed the measure 73 to 22 it now goes to the
[1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:12.880]  Senate we're going to get it done one way or the other said the resolutions
[1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:16.800]  author representative Charles Key of Oklahoma City and you know Key is
[1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:23.480]  actually pretty good he did try to expose a lot of what was going on during
[1:01:23.480 --> 1:01:27.480]  the Oklahoma City bombing so this is encouraging I think our governor is out
[1:01:27.480 --> 1:01:31.440]  of step House Democrats objected saying the issue already had been taken up and
[1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:37.360]  had been vetoed but House Speaker let's see Chris Steele and Republican
[1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:44.080]  Shawnee ruled the veto is not final action he said he expects HCR 1028 will
[1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:50.000]  pass in the Senate HJR 1003 earlier past the House 83 to 18 and want
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:55.480]  approval in the Senate 29 to 18 so again I mean there is hope out there
[1:01:55.480 --> 1:01:59.360]  everybody's like oh you guys never offer any solutions oh you are keeping us in
[1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:03.560]  the box look we're telling you get out there state sovereignty is you know one
[1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:08.080]  step in the right direction oathkeepers is a step in the right direction starting
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:11.880]  a chapter of we are change is a step in the right direction we can have a great
[1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:16.840]  effect if we want to if we want to not just sit back and be armchair
[1:02:16.840 --> 1:02:23.400]  quarterbacks and argue about minutia we can we can make it big folks we could
[1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:28.520]  go big time if we don't want to bow down to Obama the president of the world if
[1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:31.720]  we want to say you know what how about we stop giving the banks money and maybe
[1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:38.560]  it's not a good idea to essentially bail out the newspapers let them go down let
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:42.200]  them go down with the ship they've been lying to us and manipulating us for years
[1:02:42.200 --> 1:02:48.080]  it's time to say set sail goodbye over our Boston Globe I wouldn't mind them up

[1:02:55.160 --> 1:02:59.520]  any seriousness and it's just fading away how many more of these DHS documents
[1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:03.360]  have to come our way and how much more outrageous do they have to get and
[1:03:03.360 --> 1:03:10.120]  broad do they have to get before we step up and saying no no more I'm gonna take

[1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:40.320]  we're going to play the video in a moment I'm going to read this right now
[1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:44.520]  college student shoots kills home invader a group of college students said
[1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:48.280]  they are lucky to be alive and they're thanking the quick thinking of one of
[1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:53.680]  their own police said a fellow student shot and killed one of two masked men
[1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:58.160]  who burst into an apartment channel two action news reporter tom jones met with
[1:08:58.160 --> 1:09:01.840]  uh... one of the students to talk about the incident and this is charles charles
[1:09:01.840 --> 1:09:03.120]  bailey's talking about
[1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:07.600]  uh... apparently his intent was to rape and murder us all all
[1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:10.920]  well we can't defend ourselves we we shouldn't have a second amendment we
[1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:12.640]  should just bow down
[1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:13.580]  to the government
[1:09:13.580 --> 1:09:16.760]  and just let them take care of us and if they can't just you know
[1:09:16.760 --> 1:09:20.120]  he raped and killed like the slaves that we are that makes sense
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:23.200]  uh... bailey said he thought it was the end of his life in the lives of ten
[1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:27.080]  people inside his apartment for a birthday party after two masked men with
[1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:28.920]  guns burst
[1:09:28.920 --> 1:09:30.600]  through the patio door
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:33.560]  they just came in and separated the men from the women is said him your
[1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:37.000]  wallace and cell phone said george williams of the college park police
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:38.680]  department
[1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:40.200]  bailey said to the government
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:43.640]  started counting bullets can you imagine that nightmare if you're not on their
[1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:48.460]  counting bullets as a guy has a gun to your head oh my god
[1:09:48.460 --> 1:09:52.080]  the other guy asked how many bullets he had he said he had enough
[1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:53.520]  my god again
[1:09:53.520 --> 1:09:57.240]  that's one of the student's grabbed a gun out of his backpack and shot the
[1:09:57.240 --> 1:09:58.200]  invader
[1:09:58.200 --> 1:10:00.880]  who was watching the men the government ran out of the apartment
[1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:04.600]  the student then ran into the room where the second gunman identified by
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:06.640]  police is twenty three-year-old uh...
[1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:07.880]  calvin levant
[1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:10.000]  was holding the women
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.880]  apparently the guy was getting to rape his girl getting ready to rape his
[1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:17.200]  girlfriend so he told the girls to get down and started shooting
[1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:19.640]  the guy jumped out of the window said bailey
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:22.980]  uh... neighbor heard the shots and heard someone running nearby
[1:10:22.980 --> 1:10:24.920]  i mean this is incredible
[1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:27.280]  really these people all could have been killed
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:30.120]  very disgusting we have the video yet guys are we pulled up
[1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:34.200]  all right let's play the video
[1:10:34.200 --> 1:10:34.920]  we got it
[1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:38.840]  they thought they were about to die when mass gunman burst in but
[1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:41.200]  it was one of the robbers who ended up dead
[1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:44.800]  police say a man at the party on lake mott drive in college park surprised the
[1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:45.720]  home invaders
[1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:47.480]  when he pulled his own gun
[1:10:47.480 --> 1:10:53.320]  channel is tom jones live at the hospital where one student is recovering
[1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:55.240]  female student was caught
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:10:59.440]  in the middle of the gunfire she is lucky to be alive actually
[1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:02.560]  all those students who are at that party are thankful
[1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:07.200]  thankful that that one student that matters into his own hands
[1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:09.400]  if they hadn't been down or what would happen
[1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:13.160]  charles bailey is talking about the college student who risked his life to
[1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:16.120]  save the ten people who were at his party when
[1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:20.120]  two mass gunmen burst into his apartment i think all of us are really
[1:11:20.120 --> 1:11:21.520]  cognizant of the fact that
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:22.720]  we cut all of them killed
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:26.600]  the gunman ordered the men in one room and the women in another
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:29.720]  apparently his attempt was to rape and then murder us all
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:32.920]  that's when one student urged another to take action
[1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:37.160]  there was a gun in a backpack and one student grabbed it and started shooting
[1:11:37.160 --> 1:11:39.400]  at the gunman watching over the men
[1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:41.200]  that invader ran away
[1:11:41.200 --> 1:11:44.480]  the student then kicked in the door where the second gunman
[1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:47.720]  identified as calvin levant held the girls
[1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:49.840]  apparently the guys were going to rape his girlfriend
[1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:53.280]  so he tells the girls to get down and start shooting
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:54.560]  the guy jumps out the window
[1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:57.840]  levant died from gunshot wounds to the face and arm
[1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:01.280]  a female student was hit in the crossfire but survived
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:05.000]  a neighbor told me she thought she heard one of the gunmen run by
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:08.240]  i just heard him say somebody please help, somebody please help call the police
[1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:11.760]  and that was right after i heard the three gunshots bailey a college student
[1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:13.240]  himself was shocked
[1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:16.240]  when i told him levant lived just a building away
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:18.000]  building seventeen
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:19.480]  what?
[1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:23.000]  building seventeen
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:27.560]  and bailey says the gunman told him they had been watching him and now he
[1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:28.680]  knows how
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:32.120]  police say they are close to finding that second gunman
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:36.360]  the student here was hit several times but is expected to survive

[1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:35.720]  break the paradigm
[1:15:35.720 --> 1:15:39.880]  but we get tons of information out over this
[1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:41.120]  and last
[1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:42.160]  saturday
[1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:43.240]  okay
[1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:47.400]  at our town hall i had advertised and we put it on

[1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:53.480]  michael savage
[1:15:53.480 --> 1:15:57.280]  uh... ads we showed the obama deception
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:15:59.240]  at the town hall
[1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:04.360]  and uh... they people came from all over packed the town hall we had to get
[1:16:04.360 --> 1:16:06.960]  chairs out of the basement
[1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:09.080]  it was just a super deal
[1:16:09.080 --> 1:16:11.920]  and you know what that reaches out to so many people and you know a lot of
[1:16:11.920 --> 1:16:14.680]  people don't you know they think the obama deception we're reaching out to
[1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:17.760]  the right right now because the right is who was waking up we woke a lot of
[1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:18.600]  people up
[1:16:18.600 --> 1:16:19.480]  on the left
[1:16:19.480 --> 1:16:21.200]  during the bush administration
[1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:24.760]  unfortunately a lot of them did drink the obama kool-aid summer coming around
[1:16:24.760 --> 1:16:28.560]  i mean how can they not come around with all these dhs documents the give act
[1:16:28.560 --> 1:16:33.800]  coming up the national civil service act i mean craziness is upon us and

[1:16:46.240 --> 1:16:48.040]  going into his local government
[1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:50.880]  holding screenings of films that matter
[1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:55.240]  that expose what's really going on the show you the larger picture that get beyond
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:57.200]  the right left paradigm
[1:16:57.200 --> 1:17:00.800]  that so many people are mentally entrapped in
[1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:04.400]  are let's jump to craig in pennsylvania craig you're on the air
[1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:07.680]  the subject of the fact that craig in philadelphia we are changed at work

[1:17:15.200 --> 1:17:19.880]  uh... basically what i'm looking to do with it is medical like a state by state
[1:17:19.880 --> 1:17:23.400]  uh... trusted admin reporting type of thing
[1:17:23.400 --> 1:17:27.480]  where people can just upload their local corruption that they find out
[1:17:27.480 --> 1:17:28.680]  on a day-to-day basis
[1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:33.200]  well sir sounds like you're trying to start an alternative media organization
[1:17:33.200 --> 1:17:37.120]  and you know that's not acceptable in the dhs and it's defined as a term used
[1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:40.360]  to describe various information sources that provide a forum for
[1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:43.800]  interpretations of events and issues that differ radically
[1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:46.760]  from those presented in the mass media products and outlets
[1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:50.840]  sounds like you might be a terrorist man yes i am proud to call myself
[1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:54.200]  terrorist and i'm a gun owner as well and a carry permit holder so i'm proud
[1:17:54.200 --> 1:17:57.080]  of myself terrorist you are a red level
[1:17:57.080 --> 1:18:00.800]  you are ultra burning red level sir i thank you for the call
[1:18:00.800 --> 1:18:05.000]  let's go to joe in pennsylvania joe you're on the air
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:05.960]  hey jason
[1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:07.320]  and answer
[1:18:07.320 --> 1:18:08.840]  doing pretty good uh...
[1:18:08.840 --> 1:18:12.280]  uh... just wanted to say real quick i don't know if you guys missed it during
[1:18:12.280 --> 1:18:16.040]  the swan outbreak but there was a uh... zionist senator
[1:18:16.040 --> 1:18:19.960]  uh... here in pennsylvania areland specter who changed parties kind of in
[1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:21.640]  that shroud
[1:18:21.640 --> 1:18:25.480]  well we actually did cover the uh... the island specter changing parties and
[1:18:25.480 --> 1:18:29.320]  you know shifting from other republicans to the democrats and openly
[1:18:29.320 --> 1:18:31.520]  worshipping obama
[1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:35.000]  oh yeah yeah i just wanted to continue on that and you know let let a lot of
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:37.280]  people out there not to listen to show up on
[1:18:37.280 --> 1:18:41.280]  uh... the republicans forfeited the veto power in filibuster
[1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:45.160]  and that's going to give obama to ramp up an opportunity to ramp through
[1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:47.080]  a supreme court justice
[1:18:47.080 --> 1:18:50.720]  you know what they're actually talking about maybe hillary clinton becoming the
[1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:53.640]  supreme court just as i don't know if that's the real deal but they did make
[1:18:53.640 --> 1:18:55.000]  her secretary of state
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:58.040]  instead of the vice president i mean they chose another company man with
[1:18:58.040 --> 1:19:02.440]  biden but can you imagine if hillary is on the supreme court i mean she's got
[1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:05.400]  maybe twenty thirty good years of tyranny and
[1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:07.520]  right right right right right

[1:25:10.160 --> 1:25:14.280]  want to know what's going on you might check the 14th amendment and a person's
[1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:17.880]  born and naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction
[1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:21.840]  thereof they there are some people that are not subject to the jurisdiction thereof

[1:25:47.280 --> 1:25:53.000]  common law stuff and they're going after a lot it's not a lot it what it is is
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:58.200]  that the truth about what it is we are each one of us were human beings now we
[1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:03.640]  can agree to be a person we can be to be a ward of the state that's what the 14th
[1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:07.800]  amendment is doing 13th amendment no slavery or involuntary service actually
[1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:11.080]  does a lot of voluntary servitude this actually sounds a lot like what i
[1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:14.520]  discussed with tupper saucy before he passed and you know as far as i know
[1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:18.480]  that's common law but maybe i'm wrong i think for the call or let's jump to
[1:26:18.480 --> 1:26:22.680]  steven in texas you know i'm yeah hey jason
[1:26:22.680 --> 1:26:26.440]  hey uh... since you're gonna have marked i said i wanted to bring up some of
[1:26:26.440 --> 1:26:30.880]  you would uh... get you know bring this up with him you know he didn't make a
[1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:34.720]  couple of notes about this but a couple weeks ago when you had him on your show
[1:26:34.720 --> 1:26:38.320]  uh... he brought up about uh... aster crowley
[1:26:38.320 --> 1:26:41.760]  in this uh... book and sex magic that he wrote on
[1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:45.280]  i brought this up to you before and i'd really like to see you now to look into
[1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:49.040]  this because of how this ties in with the new world or what i consider to be
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:51.360]  one of the most insidious aspects
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:53.120]  of the new world or um...
[1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:57.520]  i mentioned that i i've got a book actually got through uh... tax marks
[1:26:57.520 --> 1:27:02.760]  by judith a rice man called kinsy crimes and consequences
[1:27:02.760 --> 1:27:06.520]  and i just want to read a brief excerpt from this book there's three sections
[1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:07.800]  it goes into kinsy's
[1:27:07.800 --> 1:27:10.280]  background in the crime he committed
[1:27:10.280 --> 1:27:14.480]  and then the consequences of what he did and it talks about his roman holiday
[1:27:14.480 --> 1:27:15.520]  it says
[1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:19.280]  france disappointed kinsy he had expected the french would be much more
[1:27:19.280 --> 1:27:20.880]  sexually liberated
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:25.440]  across the channel primarily notes that kinsy was in england hoping to acquire
[1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:29.400]  alster crowley's diaries for the institute which is now the kinsy
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:31.320]  institute of sexuality
[1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:35.960]  crowley who was also known as the beast was accomplished in homosexual magic and
[1:27:35.960 --> 1:27:37.680]  an occultist drug addict
[1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:43.640]  and sadist he conducted ritual satanic sacrifices of such heartless cruelty
[1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:47.400]  that the italian government rolled him out of italy following the revelation of
[1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:50.840]  fatal bloody orgies with children and their mothers
[1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:53.360]  in the squad sicilian abbey
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:57.480]  crowley had this died in the december of nineteen forty seven when kinsy was
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:27:59.360]  reportedly unsuccessful
[1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:03.240]  in obtaining the diaries he made a pilgrimage to felma abbey
[1:28:03.240 --> 1:28:05.400]  the temple where crowley ministered
[1:28:05.400 --> 1:28:09.960]  crowley's first book the pornographic white spains advocated sexual magic it
[1:28:09.960 --> 1:28:11.840]  was much favored by kinsy
[1:28:11.840 --> 1:28:14.280]  not bring that up because as you know
[1:28:14.280 --> 1:28:15.680]  the patriot act
[1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:16.880]  john u
[1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:18.440]  albergue and ours
[1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:22.200]  advocates the torture of children in front of their parents
[1:28:22.200 --> 1:28:24.960]  and we know about with the franklin cover-up
[1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:29.160]  and with uh... uh... uh... what's it called uh... uh...
[1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:32.680]  uh... the thing that you know changes uh... hella burton
[1:28:32.680 --> 1:28:37.360]  and dine cork about the sex-slave rings that they should be kidnapped these
[1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:39.640]  children so i meant to sell
[1:28:39.640 --> 1:28:44.360]  kinsy is directly responsible for this because of the so-called research he
[1:28:44.360 --> 1:28:44.960]  did
[1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:49.680]  and i find it no coincidence that this guy was heavily into alistair crowley to
[1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:51.400]  the point of wanting to use
[1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:54.200]  his rituals to justify
[1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:58.040]  the perversion that he promoted that is now responsible for
[1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:02.920]  where it is almost impossible to get a true conviction against the pedophile
[1:29:02.920 --> 1:29:05.720]  it used to be in the united states in every state
[1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:10.280]  and she brings us out in this book that it was on the book laws
[1:29:10.280 --> 1:29:12.960]  uh... crime was punishable by death
[1:29:12.960 --> 1:29:16.800]  yeah you know i don't want to go after the real petafiles ever steven i mean
[1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:17.920]  the bottom line is
[1:29:17.920 --> 1:29:20.280]  not only don't they want to go after the real pedophiles they want to make
[1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:22.920]  children sex offenders when they're you know
[1:29:22.920 --> 1:29:26.320]  texting each other topless photos of each other as teenagers
[1:29:26.320 --> 1:29:30.880]  god forbid teenagers act like teenagers they're the ones they want on the sex
[1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:35.000]  offender list not the hardcore criminals that are raping children it's
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:39.480]  disgusting i thank you for the call will have alex jones in the next segment

[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:52.720]  hey while you're at it uh let's just take care of business here on air before
[1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:57.280]  i get into this news what we finally yesterday i mean i've been told by the
[1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:00.720]  guy around the alex jones channel over 30 million views and over a million
[1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:04.320]  views a week if that was the whole point is that it's sort of building up getting
[1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:07.360]  bigger and bigger where it was online by the end of the year to have like a
[1:35:07.360 --> 1:35:12.320]  50 60 million views but we finally got the actual
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:15.600]  documents of the actual you know letter from
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:20.000]  from youtube and uh it was the pittsburgh post-cousette it says that
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:23.120]  there at the top with a complaint though the gazette says they know nothing
[1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:27.920]  about it kind of like uh sergeant schultz i know nothing i know nothing
[1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:31.600]  and uh also it was our good old friend michael reagan who said kill mark dice
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:35.600]  he'll pay for the bullets he will pay to have him murdered he wants him dead
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:39.520]  that's a quote call me i've got money uh
[1:35:39.520 --> 1:35:43.600]  and then he went on to say shove hanger nades sexually into children i mean you
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:47.680]  can't make this type of stuff up well they're very embarrassed by those clips
[1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:51.920]  when he went psychopathic on air so they had mark dice's channel suspended but
[1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:55.600]  then they were worried about lawsuits so uh
[1:35:55.600 --> 1:35:59.360]  uh michael reagan called mark dice on his cell phone
[1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:02.800]  so mark dice actually has michael reagan's number well i guess a year after
[1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:06.560]  that whole scandal when we called for getting mark dice's youtube account
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:10.640]  you know re up in things it's the same people
[1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:14.720]  uh the in fact he was the straw that broke the camel's back as it's two
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:18.640]  strikes you know you're out basically with youtube and and and folks the
[1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:22.000]  reason i'm obsessing over this is there are attacks
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:26.320]  everywhere on free speech happening right now and
[1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:29.680]  you know whatever we have an internet outage
[1:36:29.680 --> 1:36:35.600]  or a problem 98 percent of the time you know we come on air and we say no this
[1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:40.240]  was our own servers going down or our own problem or a lightning strike or
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:43.840]  you know things like that have happened or the powers out in austin and our
[1:36:43.840 --> 1:36:47.760]  backup batteries went down you know there have been things that knock us off
[1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:49.840]  the air and knock us off the internet over the years
[1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:54.320]  that's why we have a big redundant system that's a multifaceted
[1:36:54.320 --> 1:36:59.360]  to try to resist some of those attacks but we got hit for five six days straight
[1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:04.160]  with the biggest and most sophisticated uh denial of service attacks
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:08.560]  that one of our big it centers and our two it guys have ever seen
[1:37:08.560 --> 1:37:12.000]  while we were getting death threats while we were getting threatened
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:15.120]  while all these uh different things were going on
[1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:18.880]  and then our youtube channel gets taken down on top of it so
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:22.080]  i just want to point out to listeners that we are having an effect this is the
[1:37:22.080 --> 1:37:26.160]  good news you know i took my family
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:32.240]  uh you know for a couple days uh camping out of town
[1:37:32.240 --> 1:37:36.720]  camping slash staying in a lodge and i walk up to the lodge place to get my
[1:37:36.720 --> 1:37:40.240]  keys to the cabin and all three people that were in the little
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:44.800]  lodge were all fans and they've never heard of my show before
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:48.800]  until about two weeks ago they started watching us on youtube
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:52.320]  and that's what i'm talking about here folks we cannot just
[1:37:52.320 --> 1:37:56.400]  quit youtube uh that uh that nice teenager from
[1:37:56.400 --> 1:38:00.560]  minnesota uh... who uh what's his name who's
[1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:03.760]  been been fighting for nine eleven truth the school robert wennick
[1:38:03.760 --> 1:38:07.120]  yeah robert wennick put a nice video you know defending us but saying
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:11.280]  that he's going to quit youtube now no i've seen so many great directors and
[1:38:11.280 --> 1:38:15.280]  so many great activists leave youtube because of their censorship
[1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:18.880]  they are battling us there because it's the number three website in the world
[1:38:18.880 --> 1:38:23.680]  because our information can go viral there just because we're drawing fire
[1:38:23.680 --> 1:38:26.480]  doesn't mean we retreat it doesn't mean that we
[1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:30.560]  give up because we're under attack and because we're being censored
[1:38:30.560 --> 1:38:36.000]  it means we intensify all of our efforts on youtube on google but then
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:40.400]  doppelganger all the video and audio uploads to other
[1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:44.240]  sub-video channels that are also quite large
[1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:48.400]  so uh you know that's the bottom line ladies and gentlemen if we weren't
[1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:51.680]  hurting them they wouldn't be doing this and
[1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:57.600]  i can be in post eureka and people walk up to me and say i watch you every day
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:39:00.720]  on youtube i can be in canada they walk up and say i watch you every day on
[1:39:00.720 --> 1:39:04.800]  youtube and google video i can be in the middle of the woods
[1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:08.720]  in texas and people walk up and say we watch you on youtube i can be in dc
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:13.120]  new york everywhere i go and it's not like i'm walking past a hundred people
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:14.960]  and two or three out of a hundred come up
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:17.600]  vermice you know you're with me that happens to you a lot too
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:21.440]  rob do's getting recognized everywhere when i send him to boston
[1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:25.360]  or i send him to uh you know different places to do interviews
[1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:28.720]  erin dykes rob jacob senator getting recognized you know in kansas city
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:31.920]  everywhere i mean people that are hardly on camera
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:34.720]  people that have been working for us two three months
[1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:38.560]  are already being picked again that's a gauge
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:41.760]  of the information if if it was just some
[1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:47.680]  guy talking about how to fly fish or something and people are saying oh i
[1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:50.480]  recognize you everywhere from your fly fishing videos
[1:39:50.480 --> 1:39:54.560]  that would just be interesting it would be a bit vain but but
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:57.760]  this isn't fly fishing this is fishing for the minds of men
[1:39:57.760 --> 1:40:02.000]  unlocking minds this is when when we get recognized
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:05.600]  it is a gauge of the effect we're happening
[1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:10.000]  and and and of what's happening in this nation
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:13.200]  and this world so the reason i want to be gone
[1:40:13.200 --> 1:40:17.840]  via telephone uh for at least 3045 minutes with you tomorrow is i have a
[1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:21.120]  ton of news information i want to go over
[1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:24.240]  uh and a lot of points i want to make but the reason i called in
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:29.280]  to the show today is because i just wanted to let the listeners everybody
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:32.400]  out there know because i've gone through this myself
[1:40:32.400 --> 1:40:35.520]  that we get down sometimes and we get frustrated
[1:40:35.520 --> 1:40:38.960]  and we get so close to the problem and it's so obvious to us and the
[1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:42.960]  corruption is so ridiculous and the lies are so ridiculous
[1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:47.120]  that we have a tendency to you know feel fatalistic
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:50.960]  or like there's no hope ladies and gentlemen there's more than just hope
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:54.960]  there is just an amazing things that are happening right now
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:58.240]  and it will just intensify our efforts to wake everybody up
[1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:01.440]  and and and the people are ready to wake up right now because everything we
[1:41:01.440 --> 1:41:04.880]  talked about in the past is coming true we've done the groundwork many others
[1:41:04.880 --> 1:41:08.240]  before to the groundwork many people out there listening to the groundwork
[1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:12.640]  uh the world government's openly being announced and set up so now is the time
[1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:16.160]  of course the enemy's blasting our walls and coming in and bringing the nation
[1:41:16.160 --> 1:41:19.200]  down but we always knew this point was coming
[1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:22.080]  and so now is the time to fight with maximum effort
[1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:26.960]  because we're being hit and attacked and and and the enemy is striking
[1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:30.960]  means that we are engaging them when you're over the target you get the
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:34.720]  flag and when you're coming in i guess in vietnam to drop the
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:38.960]  troops off in some forest uh some jungle uh meadow
[1:41:38.960 --> 1:41:43.040]  you know some some some some uh landing zone and you're getting fired on
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:46.720]  you know you're coming down where the enemy's at you know you're coming down
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:51.760]  where the action is and so yeah we can run off to little smaller sites and
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:55.280]  places and not be molested and left alone for now
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:58.960]  but we need to go out and find the enemy she can destroy
[1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:02.560]  in the info war we need to go where we're under fire we need to go where we're
[1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:05.440]  under attack we need to go where we're being resisted
[1:42:05.440 --> 1:42:11.040]  and with that i want to get into uh jackie smith the home secretary
[1:42:11.040 --> 1:42:14.320]  literally a would be peniche or adolf hitler
[1:42:14.320 --> 1:42:18.080]  or mouse a tongue but she's kind of the hermit during her hindrick hemler
[1:42:18.080 --> 1:42:21.200]  uh i guess for gordon brown in the new world order the head of the g20
[1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:24.320]  but before i get into that bermas any comments on my last uh
[1:42:24.320 --> 1:42:28.320]  seven minute rant well i can't agree more i mean just because we're
[1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:32.560]  you know being thwarted on youtube by taking that down our biggest channel
[1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:35.440]  doesn't mean that there isn't a ton of alex jones stuff out there it doesn't
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:38.000]  mean we can't rebuild like you said it's the number
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:41.520]  three website in the world only behind google and remember
[1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:45.680]  google video does integrate all the other websites and like v meo and my
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:48.000]  space video in their search engines but they've
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:51.200]  they've really taken beta to alpha you know taking down
[1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:55.280]  uh the amount of views taking down the top 100 taking down
[1:42:55.280 --> 1:42:58.480]  the hottest videos now you have to click through just featured videos they
[1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:00.880]  don't tell you any stats exactly let's be clear
[1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:05.120]  yeah all of my videos have been number one loose change papal enemies that you
[1:43:05.120 --> 1:43:08.560]  were involved in papal enemies you produced and then directed
[1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:11.360]  all number one everything we do is number one
[1:43:11.360 --> 1:43:14.720]  okay number one and then when does it stop being number one
[1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:19.120]  they just freeze our account and then later we got internal memos we've
[1:43:19.120 --> 1:43:22.480]  written articles about this they'll just freeze the video for two weeks
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:25.200]  till it's dead or they'll just knock you out they
[1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:28.880]  cheat and so we pointed out hey why do you have a top 100
[1:43:28.880 --> 1:43:31.520]  you're claiming this is what the people want and people could say well that's
[1:43:31.520 --> 1:43:34.800]  their website so it's not censorship the issue is
[1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:39.600]  just like dig later had to admit uh to wire magazine that they censored our
[1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:43.120]  articles the people were voting us up to number one
[1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:46.880]  on the on the side that's in the top 30 and they were knocking us out that
[1:43:46.880 --> 1:43:50.720]  folks they do this it's like whack-a-mole we're not going away if
[1:43:50.720 --> 1:43:54.080]  anybody ever been in a video game parlor and you'll play the game with the
[1:43:54.080 --> 1:43:56.720]  moles are popping up and you're whacking them with the mallet
[1:43:56.720 --> 1:44:00.080]  ladies and gentlemen we've just got to have more moles
[1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:04.160]  popping up more places the fact we're being whacked on the head only excites
[1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:07.360]  me i love it yeah absolutely and the more they do it
[1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:10.400]  you know the more aggressive i'm going to be like you said i'm doing seven hours
[1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:14.240]  of radio today i'm doing seven hours of radio tomorrow i'll be here this
[1:44:14.240 --> 1:44:18.480]  weekend working on my next project i mean we have to engage these guys
[1:44:18.480 --> 1:44:22.720]  full force if we want victory and you know i had some encouraging callers
[1:44:22.720 --> 1:44:25.520]  bill in wisconsin really took uh... you know
[1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:28.960]  this movement to his own hands he ran for local government he made changes
[1:44:28.960 --> 1:44:32.960]  locally there is so much people do he just did a big screening of the obama
[1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:36.320]  deception people are handing that out exactly that that's the thing that
[1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:41.120]  frustrates me is that i have engaged in the info war i have caught people
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:44.560]  engaged in bribery and single-handedly with uh... we hope
[1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:47.840]  that the locals here in austin of single-handedly defeated gun bills
[1:44:47.840 --> 1:44:50.560]  we've thrown out the patriot act in so many cities
[1:44:50.560 --> 1:44:53.520]  when we've done so much there's hundreds of things we've done
[1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:58.000]  anytime we take the field anytime we take action
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:01.200]  anytime we stand up and fight back we win
[1:45:01.200 --> 1:45:04.240]  but people have this spell on them that they can't fight back well
[1:45:04.240 --> 1:45:07.360]  listen i want to get this economic news in the next segment that's when we're
[1:45:07.360 --> 1:45:11.200]  going to cover that uh... heads up to the folks the network but right now
[1:45:11.200 --> 1:45:16.080]  i want to play this video this audio uh... this is a video press release
[1:45:16.080 --> 1:45:19.760]  uh... put out by uh... her lordship uh...
[1:45:19.760 --> 1:45:24.080]  jackie smith over in england this is the person that says if they don't like
[1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:27.280]  your behavior criticizing immigrants he will be arrested
[1:45:27.280 --> 1:45:32.160]  robin page arrested a bbc presenter for just saying rural communities deserve
[1:45:32.160 --> 1:45:35.120]  the same rights as quote muslims and homosexuals
[1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:38.720]  bbc arrested i can give hundreds of other examples but there's one right
[1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:42.000]  there total secret police has nothing to do
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:46.320]  with loving the liberals and loving black people and loving the gays
[1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:49.520]  it's all the way to sell the left on going along
[1:45:49.520 --> 1:45:53.200]  with tyranny and we all know about michael savage you know i heard saying he
[1:45:53.200 --> 1:45:57.600]  can't come to the country and uh... and europe's arresting people that are
[1:45:57.600 --> 1:45:59.680]  criticizing the the u
[1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:03.760]  ministers are being fired this is really happening this is tyranny folks
[1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:07.280]  when they start trying to restrict your free speech and your first amendment
[1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:11.680]  and and and then we have this other bill separate from the hate speech bill
[1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:14.880]  it's lying there on your desk i forget the cyberbullying prevention act it's
[1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:18.960]  right next to me and uh... you know it makes some really just ludicrous
[1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:23.360]  well i remember on that uh... you know it's on nineteen sixty six okay so my
[1:46:23.360 --> 1:46:26.000]  point on that is this and i'm gonna leave you covered by us
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:29.920]  the point is that openly says what they it's the same thing in england europe
[1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:33.200]  if someone says what you said hurt their feelings
[1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:35.840]  then you're arrested and that's what she says
[1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:39.440]  in these different press conferences that she's been giving she says
[1:46:39.440 --> 1:46:43.200]  if it hurts somebody's feelings or it could upset someone and cause a fist
[1:46:43.200 --> 1:46:47.280]  fight it's illegal it's a felony and that's what the cyber
[1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:50.560]  bullying prevention act says it says a federal
[1:46:50.560 --> 1:46:54.480]  felony if you hurt someone's feelings so you should read that later but
[1:46:54.480 --> 1:46:58.400]  here's the bottom line here's a clip of her because this integrates them with
[1:46:58.400 --> 1:47:01.440]  the attack on free speech and i'll explain why if we play the clip
[1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:05.040]  here she is saying hey you already got a show your power bill
[1:47:05.040 --> 1:47:08.400]  or your grocery bill or whatever went with your id
[1:47:08.400 --> 1:47:12.080]  for government you know uh... identification
[1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:15.600]  we're already snooping and tracking everything you're doing
[1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:18.880]  so go ahead and capitulate to a national ID card
[1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:22.080]  which england has resisted for decades that's one of the few things they
[1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:26.080]  fought there we already have it here by stealth through the local drivers license
[1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:29.360]  an id i told people that under the executive order back in the 90s
[1:47:29.360 --> 1:47:33.040]  it's now public oh yes it's called the real id act already standardized
[1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:37.360]  globally to a global standard under a 2000 treaty signed in australia
[1:47:37.360 --> 1:47:40.160]  with the united nations the uh... and of course the u.s and others are
[1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:44.320]  signatories so we're already under a world id they're just standardizing it
[1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:49.280]  all and she tries to say in this tape with this audio of video she tries to
[1:47:49.280 --> 1:47:54.000]  say it's no big deal she says this is the same thing
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:57.200]  uh... as as you know just having to show your power bill
[1:47:57.200 --> 1:48:01.200]  with your id and this will make it simpler this will have less data about
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:03.920]  you this will give you more privacy ladies and gentlemen she says we want
[1:48:03.920 --> 1:48:07.440]  your digital fingerprints and face scan she says we've already taken digital
[1:48:07.440 --> 1:48:12.160]  photos of you so she's now explaining now what the feds have said what the big
[1:48:12.160 --> 1:48:15.680]  biometric conferences have said what the pentagon has announced what the
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:19.520]  standardization uh... under u.n. law states
[1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:22.560]  is that to buy and sell you will face scan
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:25.760]  and or thumbprint they're now saying trying to standardize that we have to do
[1:48:25.760 --> 1:48:29.520]  both for double authentication now folks
[1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:32.800]  right out of revelations but even if you're an atheist come on big government
[1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:36.240]  making you thumbprint and face scan to buy and sell so the hand
[1:48:36.240 --> 1:48:40.560]  and the face it's a digital number let you have reckoning
[1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:43.920]  understanding uh... let you have wisdom reckon the number of the beast the
[1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:47.840]  number of a man they explain with biometrics it digitally
[1:48:47.840 --> 1:48:52.800]  calculates the features on the face the separation of the fingerprints
[1:48:52.800 --> 1:48:56.800]  and it creates a number of the man your digital algorithm
[1:48:56.800 --> 1:49:00.560]  but regardless this is going to be used for total tyranny and what they stated
[1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:04.320]  at homeland security what the uh... england and europe has said what china

[1:50:38.320 --> 1:50:41.520]  and she does advertise it like it's the best thing since breakfast

[1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:51.200]  of those people are setting the precedent with that she's setting the

[1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:20.080]  and then we've got uh senator brogdon coming on
[1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:24.320]  where they're bypassing the governor who is a globalist uh who's uh
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:27.600]  i guess trying to stop uh what they're doing in oklahoma
[1:54:27.600 --> 1:54:30.240]  uh i mean that's the details i got on the road but we'll find out the
[1:54:30.240 --> 1:54:35.360]  specifics uh from him coming up uh or perhaps the governor's gonna help i
[1:54:35.360 --> 1:54:40.240]  don't know we'll find out the details uh but also clearly giant nato drills in
[1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:43.200]  georgia then claiming that the russians were trying to stage
[1:54:43.200 --> 1:54:45.520]  coups with military groups and no evidence
[1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:49.360]  that's going on obama says trillions more for the banks
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:53.360]  uh for the bankers and all of that is going on so that's coming up with jason
[1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:56.320]  bermas but look i will play this clip the point here is
[1:54:56.320 --> 1:54:59.440]  there's a million one hundred thousand americans
[1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:05.040]  on the no fly list and it's always getting bigger they're always adding new
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:08.400]  people uh this is about training you that you don't
[1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:13.760]  travel unless they say so and also being guilty without
[1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:18.000]  ever even being charged or tried they just say well the database says you're a
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:21.600]  terrorist or you may be a terrorist now to the patriot act they have giant
[1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:25.600]  criminal databases with more than four million people on them who have no
[1:55:25.600 --> 1:55:28.720]  criminal convictions so this is the new system
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:32.720]  where citizens will have to have i d cards to have jobs worldwide
[1:55:32.720 --> 1:55:35.520]  but the illegal aliens are always exempted from it
[1:55:35.520 --> 1:55:39.040]  as they've done with the national i d card uh in the bailout money and the
[1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:42.640]  rest of it so listen to this lady when she's talking
[1:55:42.640 --> 1:55:46.320]  about this as they force the british because all this goes hand in glove
[1:55:46.320 --> 1:55:49.840]  secret police spying on the parliament without warrants
[1:55:49.840 --> 1:55:54.160]  the nsa spying on congress without warrants it's the illegitimate
[1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:58.080]  national security government in the u.s in england and europe
[1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:02.640]  that works for the private banks that is literally circumventing the elected
[1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:06.640]  parliaments the legislatures the congresses as the john war defense
[1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:10.400]  authorization act and others say the governors are now under federal
[1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:14.000]  control in the u.s same thing with with what's happening in
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:18.800]  england this is a illegitimate coup this is an illegitimate takeover so they
[1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:22.560]  can financially loot us and then carry out their eugenics on us and we must
[1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:26.880]  fight the national i d cards the real i d act because it's going to be used where
[1:56:26.880 --> 1:56:30.640]  you can't travel you can't buy and sell that is their stated goal
[1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:34.080]  and they're already implementing it so look there's already thousands that
[1:56:34.080 --> 1:56:37.280]  can't go into england that we know of they already sit there and check you
[1:56:37.280 --> 1:56:39.760]  when you go in canada already has my name on the list
[1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:44.160]  everybody can stop whether it's david ike uh... or or george galloway
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:47.520]  i mean everybody i know basically isn't allowed into canada
[1:56:47.520 --> 1:56:52.160]  right run by the same people so this is already here it's like nazi germany
[1:56:52.160 --> 1:56:55.600]  how you couldn't get out without your papers and they grab you at the border
[1:56:55.600 --> 1:56:59.360]  it's the same thing in the u.s wouldn't let people leave germany and come to the
[1:56:59.360 --> 1:57:02.880]  u.s that's a big dirty secret neither would england so again
[1:57:02.880 --> 1:57:06.080]  here is the which here is the would be tired
[1:57:06.080 --> 1:57:10.240]  the key words for me when it comes to the identity service art security and
[1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:13.040]  convenience let's be clear we already
[1:57:13.040 --> 1:57:16.240]  wander quite often around the streets with large amounts
[1:57:16.240 --> 1:57:21.600]  of personal information utility bills passports other information that we
[1:57:21.600 --> 1:57:24.160]  need to use at the moment to prove our identity
[1:57:24.160 --> 1:57:27.600]  an identity card is a more secure and convenient way
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:31.920]  to do something that we're already having to do without actually sharing
[1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:36.560]  as much personal data as we now have to but i think it's right as well when we
[1:57:36.560 --> 1:57:39.600]  thinking about the convenience of how you enroll
[1:57:39.600 --> 1:57:43.760]  your facial image your fingerprints both for id cards and incidentally for
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:46.640]  biometric passports that we make that as convenient
[1:57:46.640 --> 1:57:50.400]  as possible for the public we're used in this country to having our digital
[1:57:50.400 --> 1:57:54.000]  photos taken for our passports in high street outlets
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:57.440]  i believe that we can offer that opportunity to to people
[1:57:57.440 --> 1:58:01.520]  for to have their biometric fingerprints taken as well and we can do that
[1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:04.880]  in a secure way but in a way that's also convenient to people
[1:58:04.880 --> 1:58:08.480]  so it's not a white elephant it's mr green it's referred to it
[1:58:08.480 --> 1:58:12.560]  well look there are 70 000 by the end of this year there'll be 70 000
[1:58:12.560 --> 1:58:16.080]  id cards already in people's hands there's already 30 000
[1:58:16.080 --> 1:58:19.520]  they're helping foreign nationals to prove their right to be here
[1:58:19.520 --> 1:58:22.400]  they're helping employers to be more secure that people have got the right
[1:58:22.400 --> 1:58:26.160]  to work we're already having to prove our identity i think it's the role of
[1:58:26.160 --> 1:58:29.120]  government to help people to do that more securely
[1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:33.120]  and more conveniently and at the same time to help people to protect their
[1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:36.160]  identity so that i could be confident that somebody else
[1:58:36.160 --> 1:58:39.600]  isn't pretending to be alright folks we'll be back after this it's the alex

[2:01:09.600 --> 2:01:14.000]  week uh obama's coming out saying trillions more on top of that
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.960]  but they already have a blank check in the banker bailout so when he says he
[2:01:16.960 --> 2:01:21.120]  wants more money he means a new law with even more power and control
[2:01:21.120 --> 2:01:25.600]  they're handing christler over to fiat bill deberg group owned we cover that
[2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:29.680]  in the endgame so with all of this going on state sovereignty is more
[2:01:29.680 --> 2:01:32.080]  important than ever look how far we've come
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:36.640]  where governors are talking about you know uh declaring sovereignty and then
[2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:40.080]  perry tries to make it about secession when it's not about secession it's
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:44.320]  about putting the feds back in their place arresting the bankers
[2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:47.120]  getting control of our nation but i wanted to bring ted anderson up this
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:49.840]  segment before uh the state senator comes on with his
[2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:53.280]  breaking news because ladies and gentlemen
[2:01:53.280 --> 2:01:57.440]  i keep trying to explain to you summer is normally and every year we've seen
[2:01:57.440 --> 2:02:01.840]  until last year way down precious metals are way down during the summer
[2:02:01.840 --> 2:02:05.520]  instead it's racing up right now just like last year
[2:02:05.520 --> 2:02:09.920]  as the world dumps the dollar as china dumps the dollar you just
[2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:13.840]  do a search on china buying up metals and you'll see it
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:17.200]  i believe in buying gold and silver i bought a little bit more silver
[2:02:17.200 --> 2:02:21.840]  yesterday these beautiful look arounds i believe in this and ted bought this
[2:02:21.840 --> 2:02:27.600]  stuff when gold was at 870 when silver was down over a dollar it's now up
[2:02:27.600 --> 2:02:32.240]  way over that uh just absolutely amazing ted explain to people
[2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:35.360]  because this is such a great deal you've got gold and silver
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:38.960]  at the price it was a couple weeks ago when both of them are way up right now
[2:02:38.960 --> 2:02:42.320]  so folks are guaranteed to get the old price
[2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:46.400]  uh of a market that was down while the market's up i mean that's eating your
[2:02:46.400 --> 2:02:49.920]  that's having your cake and eating it too ted it sure is i can tell you right
[2:02:49.920 --> 2:02:54.480]  now silver hit a high today of 14 dollars and 18 cents
[2:02:54.480 --> 2:02:59.200]  and currently right now 1403 when i locked in those Lakota's at first
[2:02:59.200 --> 2:03:03.520]  we're at 1850 and then silver dropped down to about 11 dollars
[2:03:03.520 --> 2:03:06.640]  and 50 cents and i was able to bring down my price
[2:03:06.640 --> 2:03:13.280]  for Lakota's down to 1771 and right now silver's up over 14 dollars again
[2:03:13.280 --> 2:03:16.240]  that's higher than it was when i originally locked it in which means the
[2:03:16.240 --> 2:03:22.080]  Lakota's are going to be closer to 19 dollars a piece rather than 1771 so
[2:03:22.080 --> 2:03:26.000]  if you want to get in on something that's really at a bottom basement level
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:30.080]  plus also i mean it's just so great i mean it's a coin right now they're flying
[2:03:30.080 --> 2:03:33.200]  in the face of the federal reserve and alex you're hitting it right on the
[2:03:33.200 --> 2:03:36.000]  head i mean that uh that the chinese want to get
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:39.600]  out of the dollar so bad and they're just looking for liquidity
[2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:43.600]  and that's why you're going to see inflation and you're going to see a loss of purchasing
[2:03:43.600 --> 2:03:47.600]  power here at home it's all about that tarp and that is uh that's there's just
[2:03:47.600 --> 2:03:51.920]  way too much money coming into the system absolutely and ted let's explain to people
[2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:55.760]  back when silver was two dollars lower roughly than it is right now
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:04:00.000]  these Lakota's were selling for 25 bucks on ebay you've got them for 19
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:03.680]  dollars right now you already sold out of what you had more just came in
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:06.400]  on monday that's how i was able to get a couple rolls
[2:04:06.400 --> 2:04:10.720]  that is the most gorgeous it's got collector value and ted is selling it
[2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:13.680]  lower than he will find it anywhere ladies and gentlemen
[2:04:13.680 --> 2:04:16.960]  i would move on those Lakota's but more importantly dead
[2:04:16.960 --> 2:04:20.560]  people need to get portable they need to get control not to be in this digital
[2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:25.760]  beast system with this digital money in the banks folks you're insane if you
[2:04:25.760 --> 2:04:28.560]  don't at least hedge your bets and move some of your money out of stocks and
[2:04:28.560 --> 2:04:32.560]  bonds uh and and and cash in the gold and silver
[2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:37.200]  it in fact you even got some platinum and stuff when we come back briefly
[2:04:37.200 --> 2:04:40.800]  tell folks about some of the gold some of the silver some of the other medals
[2:04:40.800 --> 2:04:43.440]  you've got and then we'll go to the senator from
[2:04:43.440 --> 2:04:47.760]  oklahoma i'm alex jones this is the one the only gcn radio network sitting
[2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:51.600]  in for me is jason bermas but wild horses couldn't rack me away after 17

[2:05:01.280 --> 2:05:05.200]  finally in the news this evening it's being reported that cyber spies from
[2:05:05.200 --> 2:05:08.320]  russia and china have now penetrated our power grid
[2:05:08.320 --> 2:05:12.400]  even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer
[2:05:12.400 --> 2:05:16.320]  to the limits of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for
[2:05:16.320 --> 2:05:19.600]  electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge
[2:05:19.600 --> 2:05:23.840]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country putting us all
[2:05:23.840 --> 2:05:28.320]  in the dark are you prepared for the next round of storm related outages or
[2:05:28.320 --> 2:05:32.160]  government created blackouts have you ever thought about taking steps to get
[2:05:32.160 --> 2:05:36.480]  off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power
[2:05:36.480 --> 2:05:40.400]  if so this will be the most important information you have ever heard
[2:05:40.400 --> 2:05:44.560]  solar powered generators are finally available they have no moving parts to

[2:08:36.240 --> 2:08:39.760]  ted absolutely i was just gonna uh first off
[2:08:39.760 --> 2:08:42.800]  commend the senator for what he's doing in this hard fight
[2:08:42.800 --> 2:08:46.400]  going on in oklahoma now all over the country we've gone from three or four
[2:08:46.400 --> 2:08:49.600]  months ago people laughing at us about the state sovereignty movement
[2:08:49.600 --> 2:08:53.760]  to now the establishment's very scared trying to demonize it claiming we want
[2:08:53.760 --> 2:08:58.720]  violence a session on cnn and and and places all we're saying is
[2:08:58.720 --> 2:09:03.840]  tenth and ninth amendment reassert the bill arrived constitution the states
[2:09:03.840 --> 2:09:09.120]  made the federal government we can change it or abolish it but in closing
[2:09:09.120 --> 2:09:13.360]  here with ted anderson folks i only promote what i believe in
[2:09:13.360 --> 2:09:16.320]  and i believe in golden silver and i've been pushing it for the last five six
[2:09:16.320 --> 2:09:20.000]  years back when gold was it 300 bucks an ounce
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:24.240]  360 bucks an ounce you know now it's been up as high as a thousand plus
[2:09:24.240 --> 2:09:27.520]  it's going back that way summer's normally the dead time
[2:09:27.520 --> 2:09:33.040]  and we see it up above uh you know uh a thousand right now i mean up above
[2:09:33.040 --> 2:09:37.680]  900 on gold up above 14 on silver i mean there is
[2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:41.440]  so much going on so much happening so i wanted to bring ted up just briefly
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:44.400]  because he is one of the biggest silver and gold brokers in the country
[2:09:44.400 --> 2:09:48.880]  he's also a patriot you know somebody we know behind congressman ron paul
[2:09:48.880 --> 2:09:51.760]  with the uh flights you saw all over the country
[2:09:51.760 --> 2:09:54.560]  uh you know with the ron paul air force out there
[2:09:54.560 --> 2:09:58.000]  uh i mean he's just such a great patriot in the fight against the new world order
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:00.960]  so this is the company to get your golden silver from it's also the company to
[2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:04.960]  get the best deal because ted smart he buys when it's low and then sells it at
[2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:09.120]  the low price when it's high that's how he's destroying his competition
[2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:12.800]  that's why you hear his ads for minus resources all over national radio
[2:10:12.800 --> 2:10:16.240]  not just here on the network because ted has been so competitive that he's
[2:10:16.240 --> 2:10:19.360]  becoming one of the biggest players but in closing ted just tell folks about
[2:10:19.360 --> 2:10:23.360]  some of the gold you've got yeah sure we right now have the frank
[2:10:23.360 --> 2:10:27.280]  gold piece right now at 214 which is the same price people know that because
[2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:30.800]  they heard me just talking about it last week we have the british sovereign at
[2:10:30.800 --> 2:10:35.200]  267 again that's before gold won over 900 dollars an ounce
[2:10:35.200 --> 2:10:40.240]  uh you said 19 dollars on the Lakota's but we are carrying them at 1771
[2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:44.880]  which is exactly the same price when silver was at 1150 hold on excuse me ted
[2:10:44.880 --> 2:10:51.040]  excuse me on monday when you got more in i bought them at 1760 whatever from you
[2:10:51.040 --> 2:10:55.200]  and i said can i buy a couple more rolls next week and you said no
[2:10:55.200 --> 2:10:58.400]  by the end of the week they'll be 19 that's why i misspoke you're saying
[2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:03.120]  you're keeping it at that price i'm keeping it at that price for today and
[2:11:03.120 --> 2:11:06.400]  perhaps tomorrow depending upon the quantity i didn't want to sell out of
[2:11:06.400 --> 2:11:09.760]  everything i want to give my customers a chance to buy these things
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:12.880]  uh i can tell you right now alex i've locked in i might have
[2:11:12.880 --> 2:11:18.800]  i think i've got about 6 000 coins left at that at that 1771 price and then
[2:11:18.800 --> 2:11:22.640]  they're gonna go up i mean you can look on youtube right now or youtube you
[2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:27.360]  google or uh or ebay right now and you'll see them there 20 to 25 so the price is
[2:11:27.360 --> 2:11:31.520]  good uh we also have uh some u.s eagles we you know
[2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:35.520]  we've got a list of different coins u.s eagles maple leaves uh there there are
[2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:38.160]  platinum and palladium coins you have some buffaloes
[2:11:38.160 --> 2:11:41.680]  buffaloes we do have a few of those so if you're interested in those you can call
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:44.640]  about them i'm just trying to think out the top of my
[2:11:44.640 --> 2:11:48.400]  head i've been accumulating quite a bit here while the prices are lower so if
[2:11:48.400 --> 2:11:52.560]  you need to have quantity just give us a call because we can do it right now a
[2:11:52.560 --> 2:11:55.440]  few years the key here's the key and then we're gonna get out of here and let the
[2:11:55.440 --> 2:11:58.880]  senator come on i appreciate jason burman sitting in today we appreciate
[2:11:58.880 --> 2:12:01.680]  the senator we're praying for his work everybody else's

[2:12:04.640 --> 2:12:08.480]  bottom line folks ted is giving you the price
[2:12:08.480 --> 2:12:12.320]  before gold and silver exploded you cannot beat this
[2:12:12.320 --> 2:12:22.560]  800-686-2237-1800-686-2237 uh folks i thought it was a great deal at 19 on
[2:12:22.560 --> 2:12:26.320]  these Lakotas i didn't know he was keeping these gorgeous
[2:12:26.320 --> 2:12:30.160]  uh silver coins with a native american warrior on the front the buffalo
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:33.840]  on the back i didn't i mean these things are collector and he's selling them
[2:12:33.840 --> 2:12:37.440]  below what junk silvers being sold for right now
[2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:43.840]  i mean you cannot beat that deal 800-686-2237 and i guess the brokers will
[2:12:43.840 --> 2:12:47.440]  be there uh till midnight tonight but you gotta tell them it's the alex jones
[2:12:47.440 --> 2:12:51.680]  special or you will be paying more for the gold and the silver make sure when
[2:12:51.680 --> 2:12:54.960]  you call you tell the brokers that you heard kate anderson offer it
[2:12:54.960 --> 2:12:57.440]  here on this transmission that's correct right ted
[2:12:57.440 --> 2:12:59.760]  yep that's right that's what i need to have you do
[2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:05.120]  800-686-2237 ladies and gentlemen the new world order demonizes gold and silver
[2:13:05.120 --> 2:13:09.520]  for a reason because they print out fiat money and they buy it up themselves
[2:13:09.520 --> 2:13:13.040]  the globalist hoard this in their private vaults and government
[2:13:13.040 --> 2:13:17.600]  vaults they sit on it like a smog the dragon while telling you
[2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:20.720]  that you need some good paper fiat or some good derivatives
[2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:24.320]  you know some good inron stock we're telling you golden silvers the way to

[2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:48.400]  thanks jason and thanks to the crew and all the affiliates
[2:13:48.400 --> 2:13:52.320]  all right thank you alex and uh... with that being said we're gonna go right to
[2:13:52.320 --> 2:13:57.360]  senator randy brogdon and get the latest on these two separate bills hcr
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:03.680]  1028 and hcr 1003 or i'm sorry hjr 1003 which apparently has passed the
[2:14:03.680 --> 2:14:08.000]  house and senate and was vetoed by the governor but they just uh... passed this
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:11.440]  latest one 1028 what's the status right now
[2:14:11.440 --> 2:14:14.640]  well uh... in fact the governor governor
[2:14:14.640 --> 2:14:20.160]  brad henry here in oklahoma vetoed hjr 1003 which was a
[2:14:20.160 --> 2:14:23.840]  senate joint resolution that had the uh... rule of law
[2:14:23.840 --> 2:14:29.920]  in the bill itself and he rejected that he out of hand vetoed a
[2:14:29.920 --> 2:14:34.240]  tenth amendment resolution now let me try to put that in perspective
[2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:37.840]  here is the uh... the leader of our state the governor of the state of
[2:14:37.840 --> 2:14:42.240]  oklahoma sworn to uphold the constitution of the united states
[2:14:42.240 --> 2:14:48.160]  as well as the oklahoma constitution and he vetoed a tenth amendment resolution
[2:14:48.160 --> 2:14:52.080]  if there is any one group or any one person that should
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:56.000]  support the tenth amendment uh... it should be the state legislature and
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:59.760]  certainly the uh... the highest officer of the land here in the state of
[2:14:59.760 --> 2:15:03.520]  oklahoma that's the governor yet he chose to side with the
[2:15:03.520 --> 2:15:08.880]  insiders of washington dc allow the continuation of the
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:13.120]  overhanded uh... of the uh... overhanded and heavy-handed
[2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:17.360]  uh... long arm of the federal government sweep down again into the state of
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:20.960]  oklahoma and allow dc politicians
[2:15:20.960 --> 2:15:24.080]  uh... to continue to run the state of oklahoma
[2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:29.680]  so what what we decided to do was to run a house concurrent resolution
[2:15:29.680 --> 2:15:33.280]  which does not have the rule of law tied to it but it
[2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:37.040]  shows the will expressed by the state legislature
[2:15:37.040 --> 2:15:40.640]  and you know it's really a shame that we've been have to do something like
[2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:44.560]  this uh... the tenth amendment is the tenth amendment
[2:15:44.560 --> 2:15:47.840]  and i guess governor henry thinks that since he vetoed our
[2:15:47.840 --> 2:15:51.680]  resolution that he really doesn't even have to abide by the rent
[2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:55.200]  by the tenth amendment anymore but he's going to figure out that that's wrong
[2:15:55.200 --> 2:15:58.160]  so uh... we're going to help him realize that
[2:15:58.160 --> 2:16:02.560]  so what are the next steps now that this uh... this new bill has passed a 1028
[2:16:02.560 --> 2:16:06.080]  this concurrent resolution where does it go from here
[2:16:06.080 --> 2:16:09.600]  yeah 1028 passed the house yesterday and it'll be heard on the
[2:16:09.600 --> 2:16:12.640]  senate floor uh... next Tuesday i'm the senate
[2:16:12.640 --> 2:16:17.040]  author again on this resolution and we'll get it passed off of the
[2:16:17.040 --> 2:16:21.280]  uh... senate floor it'll go directly from there to the president of the
[2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:25.440]  united states and every member of congress expressing
[2:16:25.440 --> 2:16:30.000]  i will as a as the oklahoma state legislature
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:33.680]  uh... to to we're telling the federal government
[2:16:33.680 --> 2:16:38.560]  to stick to their business they have very limited role to play
[2:16:38.560 --> 2:16:42.320]  uh... there's only 19 or 20 enumerated powers
[2:16:42.320 --> 2:16:47.040]  that are spelled out and clearly defined in article one section eight of the
[2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:50.160]  u.s constitution we are telling congress to
[2:16:50.160 --> 2:16:55.120]  see and assist us all activity that falls outside of their enumerated
[2:16:55.120 --> 2:16:58.080]  power and they need to stick to their business
[2:16:58.080 --> 2:17:02.160]  and the state of oklahoma will stick to our business and uh... we need to keep
[2:17:02.160 --> 2:17:06.000]  those separate i'm telling you uh... the the
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:09.520]  the heavy burden that the federal government
[2:17:09.520 --> 2:17:12.960]  is currently placing on the states with this stimulus money
[2:17:12.960 --> 2:17:16.880]  with the tarp the bell-out money creating generational debt and state
[2:17:16.880 --> 2:17:20.400]  legislators around the country are standing in line
[2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:25.520]  uh... with their hand out wanting all this free money and mana from heaven but
[2:17:25.520 --> 2:17:29.200]  let me tell you jason what's happening we should be
[2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:32.560]  we should be dealing with the difficult problems
[2:17:32.560 --> 2:17:36.400]  today and we're not doing it and i can tell you we're gonna be forced to deal
[2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:41.040]  with some very impossible situations in a very short period of time
[2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:45.040]  shame on the politicians that are
[2:17:45.040 --> 2:17:48.960]  uh... refusing to deal with the problems today and pushing
[2:17:48.960 --> 2:17:52.400]  these problems off to our kids and our grandkids
[2:17:52.400 --> 2:17:56.080]  shame on them i couldn't agree more now how can people

[2:24:19.360 --> 2:24:24.680]  why it's very important to get state senator randy brogdon elected because a governor is
[2:24:24.680 --> 2:24:30.760]  one in fifty he then has a position on a national stage to bring about real talk about real
[2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:35.400]  issues that matter issues that are important to anybody in the know about the constitution
[2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:40.360]  and bill of rights that are pro sovereignty movement especially for oklahoma so if you're
[2:24:40.360 --> 2:24:45.840]  outside of oklahoma you can help him get elected by helping fund his campaign and making more
[2:24:45.840 --> 2:24:52.840]  and more people aware of what's really going on around what's the website
[2:24:52.840 --> 2:24:55.520]  and so so what are the plans in the next
[2:24:55.520 --> 2:24:59.800]  you know few months gearing up for this uh... sovereignty movement and running for
[2:24:59.800 --> 2:25:03.840]  government you're obviously a very busy man at also a state senator
[2:25:03.840 --> 2:25:06.520]  well we're finishing our legislative
[2:25:06.520 --> 2:25:11.800]  uh... session here in a few weeks and then i'll be on the campaign trail full time
[2:25:11.800 --> 2:25:17.800]  to the next fifty months until the primaries in july of
[2:25:17.800 --> 2:25:19.160]  and my goal is
[2:25:19.160 --> 2:25:23.000]  it every step all seventy seven counties in the state
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:27.560]  uh... meet as many people as i can possibly made great money just enough money to get
[2:25:27.560 --> 2:25:29.240]  my message out and
[2:25:29.240 --> 2:25:34.760]  uh... i i can tell you one thing that i know about my message it itself it is wildly popular
[2:25:34.760 --> 2:25:35.880]  with the people
[2:25:35.880 --> 2:25:41.040]  uh... oklahoma is a great popular state and our government is set up that way in
[2:25:41.040 --> 2:25:43.400]  uh... you know this year i've got two other
[2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:47.960]  uh... constitutional amendments that i got past that uh... that'll be on the
[2:25:47.960 --> 2:25:53.320]  uh... ballot box as the uh... referendum but the people though to decide to think
[2:25:53.320 --> 2:25:54.440]  number one
[2:25:54.440 --> 2:25:57.040]  ballot access you know the state of oklahoma
[2:25:57.040 --> 2:26:00.840]  now i'm a republican i'm actually i'm a constitutional conservative
[2:26:00.840 --> 2:26:05.240]  uh... i belong to the republican party but oklahoma was the only
[2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:08.960]  state in the country over the last two presidential cycles
[2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:11.560]  that only had two candidates on the ballot
[2:26:11.560 --> 2:26:15.400]  and that was a republican and a democrat and the reason for that
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:19.800]  is we have grown up all kinds of roadblocks made a very onerous to get
[2:26:19.800 --> 2:26:21.760]  uh... your name on the ballot
[2:26:21.760 --> 2:26:27.120]  and so i got a ballot reform initiative uh... that the people get the vote on
[2:26:27.120 --> 2:26:31.160]  uh... in the in the next uh... community election cycle from
[2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:32.400]  out about that
[2:26:32.400 --> 2:26:34.040]  i also got
[2:26:34.040 --> 2:26:37.640]  the uh... can't amendment resolution
[2:26:37.640 --> 2:26:39.520]  so we've got to
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:40.000]  you know we've got the
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:43.740]  our good changes coming up
[2:26:43.740 --> 2:26:45.260]  it had not
[2:26:45.260 --> 2:26:47.400]  an accident and the initial petition
[2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:50.640]  uh... and ballot access
[2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:53.120]  and i think that people need to know about
[2:26:53.120 --> 2:26:55.420]  uh... that a lot of legislators
[2:26:55.420 --> 2:26:58.300]  around the country are waking up
[2:26:58.300 --> 2:27:02.320]  uh... with a standard office this year honestly indian
[2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:04.520]  the cityster calls
[2:27:04.520 --> 2:27:07.560]  of right now that there are certainly thirty two states around the
[2:27:07.560 --> 2:27:12.760]  country over the years that have asked for a constitutional convention well
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:16.120]  let me tell you what happens it only takes thirty four states and then we will
[2:27:16.120 --> 2:27:21.240]  be forced as a nation to have a brand new constitutional convention like
[2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:24.200]  that. And they can pass anything they want almost carte blanche there and
[2:27:24.200 --> 2:27:29.560]  really just think you know that is right nothing will be nothing will be held
[2:27:29.560 --> 2:27:34.600]  back it will be open for discussion there have been spring court
[2:27:34.600 --> 2:27:39.280]  decisions that said you can't have a single subject a constitutional convention
[2:27:39.280 --> 2:27:43.040]  once it's open everything is up for grabs and I can tell you there's not a
[2:27:43.040 --> 2:27:49.000]  politician in this country that could hold a candle to the founding fathers
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:53.920]  of their divine inspiration so I heard the other other states around the
[2:27:53.920 --> 2:27:58.640]  country that are listening to this today to to make sure your legislature
[2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:05.080]  repels it and recalls any constitutional calls for a convention that
[2:28:05.080 --> 2:28:10.120]  they've had over the last several decades because plenty of them. Well

[2:34:00.720 --> 2:34:05.880]  opinion outspoken and intelligent members of the patriot movement slash
[2:34:05.880 --> 2:34:10.520]  alternative media because he's really a pioneer in that as well his his YouTube
[2:34:10.520 --> 2:34:15.200]  videos going viral all over the place one of the few people that actually does
[2:34:15.200 --> 2:34:20.960]  what he says and calls into places like Hannity and Savage and Limbaugh gets on
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:25.560]  the air and turns those into viral videos as well mark thanks for joining us
[2:34:25.560 --> 2:34:30.680]  hey no problem alright so why don't you tell people about this new project it's
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:34.040]  available over at info wars dot com we discussed it on my show a couple of
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:39.560]  weeks ago it's Illuminati fact versus fiction and it how big is this book I
[2:34:39.560 --> 2:34:46.280]  think it's like 400 pages or so the books just over 400 pages and I decided
[2:34:46.280 --> 2:34:49.800]  to focus more on the Illuminati the resistance manifesto kind of looks at
[2:34:49.800 --> 2:34:53.720]  all of the new world order their institutions the secret societies their
[2:34:53.720 --> 2:34:58.160]  philosophies how it fits in with Bible prophecy so the Illuminati facts and
[2:34:58.160 --> 2:35:03.280]  fiction is more of a secular viewpoint looking more specifically at the
[2:35:03.280 --> 2:35:08.640]  Illuminati evidence of the existence and continued existence of the Illuminati
[2:35:08.640 --> 2:35:15.200]  their institutions their activities individuals that claim to be members if
[2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:19.560]  if anybody's been into this for for more than just a few months you know that
[2:35:19.560 --> 2:35:24.600]  there's there's very popular videos out there by William Schneblin the claiming
[2:35:24.600 --> 2:35:28.840]  to be a former member of the Illuminati you probably heard the audio of this
[2:35:28.840 --> 2:35:33.000]  man named John Todd claiming to be a former Illuminati member back in the
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:37.960]  70s you've heard the allegations of the Illuminati being a interdimensional
[2:35:37.960 --> 2:35:43.160]  beings working with aliens underneath the in the underground tunnels and so I
[2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:48.680]  decided to really take a look at all of the claims all of the people of the
[2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:55.400]  evidence the sources for it what are the what is the fact what is a possible
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:36:02.080]  exaggeration what is speculation what is a lie and the book also covers a lot
[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:08.600]  of the fictional representations of the Illuminati in novels television shows
[2:36:08.600 --> 2:36:13.880]  books the Da Vinci code that the angels and demons which we can get into later
[2:36:13.880 --> 2:36:19.760]  which is being released as a film next Friday at May 15th which is going to
[2:36:19.760 --> 2:36:24.760]  bring the Illuminati sort of from the underground fringe if you will into the
[2:36:24.760 --> 2:36:32.520]  mainstream consciousness but in a very tainted and false way and you know that
[2:36:32.520 --> 2:36:35.360]  that's such a good point because a lot of people out there they'll call me what
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:37.880]  do you think about this Jason what do you think about this or they'll promote a
[2:36:37.880 --> 2:36:42.560]  theory that they just read on you know the above top secret website at three in
[2:36:42.560 --> 2:36:45.920]  the morning and hadn't looked into anything just you know went through this
[2:36:45.920 --> 2:36:48.880]  little message board near covering this up you're covering that up or you're
[2:36:48.880 --> 2:36:52.360]  lying about this this really is trying to get to the heart of the matter on what
[2:36:52.360 --> 2:36:56.360]  we need to focus on and how we can show people that this does really exist and
[2:36:56.360 --> 2:37:00.600]  in fact you just republished another book proofs of a conspiracy that goes
[2:37:00.600 --> 2:37:05.120]  through a lot of this hardcore evidence yes for those who don't know proof of a
[2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:11.720]  conspiracy was published back in 1798 in English by a man named John Robison
[2:37:11.720 --> 2:37:18.280]  and it's it floats in and out of print and so I I republished it and it's
[2:37:18.280 --> 2:37:26.360]  available on info wars.com and it has the original writings of Adam Wysop of
[2:37:26.360 --> 2:37:31.520]  the other members of the original Illuminati and so we look at a lot of
[2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:37.480]  modern researchers very credible people today Jim Mars, Tex Mars and others that
[2:37:37.480 --> 2:37:43.000]  talk about the Illuminati but I own I am under the belief that in order to fully
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:46.560]  understand something you need to go back to the beginning if you want to
[2:37:46.560 --> 2:37:50.880]  understand cars you need to first find out how engines work on a very basic
[2:37:50.880 --> 2:37:54.760]  level or computers you need to see the history of it how it evolved how the
[2:37:54.760 --> 2:37:59.040]  fundamentals started and then you can have a better working idea of what's
[2:37:59.040 --> 2:38:05.120]  happening today how how the complex systems are functioning so I took the
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:12.320]  liberty of republishing John Robison's fantastic book which is very very
[2:38:12.320 --> 2:38:18.000]  interesting when you read the words of Adam Wysop and that the letters from
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:22.360]  Adam Wysop than other original Illuminati members were published back in
[2:38:22.360 --> 2:38:26.280]  the late 1700s after they were discovered after their members were arrested
[2:38:26.280 --> 2:38:31.960]  and and if you read those writings it's very interesting to see what their
[2:38:31.960 --> 2:38:35.800]  goals were back then and then you look at these modern organizations the
[2:38:35.800 --> 2:38:41.120]  Bohemian Club, Skull and Bones, the Bilderberg group and it's exactly to a
[2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:47.720]  T what the original group had planned on taking over the media secretly
[2:38:47.720 --> 2:38:54.520]  creating a a backroom network to take over positions of power you know back
[2:38:54.520 --> 2:38:59.680]  in the 1700s the only media really was was print shops and the mass printing
[2:38:59.680 --> 2:39:02.840]  was was just getting started there was obviously no radio or television but they
[2:39:02.840 --> 2:39:08.120]  knew back then to take over the printing houses and so I think John Robison's
[2:39:08.120 --> 2:39:14.600]  book is is really one of the key and first books ever published on the
[2:39:14.600 --> 2:39:19.000]  Illuminati shortly after their their discovery yeah I couldn't agree more I
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:23.440]  mean it only helps us to actually know your enemy you know and let's see what
[2:39:23.440 --> 2:39:26.680]  they had to say for themselves and then interpret it from there I mean don't get
[2:39:26.680 --> 2:39:30.640]  me wrong I love Tex and Jim Mars but they're secondhand sources so let's
[2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:35.320]  hear it straight out of the horse's mouth now I got a call earlier from
[2:39:35.320 --> 2:39:39.640]  somebody who wanted to hear your opinion obviously we've talked a lot about
[2:39:39.640 --> 2:39:43.840]  Alistair Crowley I'm sure he has a place in this new book of the illuminati
[2:39:43.840 --> 2:39:48.080]  the Illuminati facts versus fiction I know he's mentioned in the resistance
[2:39:48.080 --> 2:39:53.400]  manifesto but his relation to Kinsey apparently there's a book out there
[2:39:53.400 --> 2:39:58.040]  called Kinsey Crimes and Consequences where Kinsey was openly discussing trying
[2:39:58.040 --> 2:40:03.400]  to get Crowley's diaries now I'm not aware of that Alfred Kinsey of course is
[2:40:03.400 --> 2:40:07.960]  one of the first and most popular what they call sexologist and he did a lot
[2:40:07.960 --> 2:40:14.040]  of research on unsexuality but he was a very perverted man he interviewed a lot
[2:40:14.040 --> 2:40:19.840]  of pedophiles he would encourage his graduate students to have group sex he
[2:40:19.840 --> 2:40:27.400]  himself was reported to be bisexual he would secretly videotape orgy's in his
[2:40:27.400 --> 2:40:33.800]  own house for research purposes of course so he claimed and he is sort of the
[2:40:33.800 --> 2:40:38.840]  foundation for understanding modern sexuality which is strange because he
[2:40:38.840 --> 2:40:43.440]  had such a perverted view of it so doesn't surprise me that he was interested
[2:40:43.440 --> 2:40:48.640]  in Alistair Crowley Crowley himself of very very strange and perverted
[2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:52.840]  individual very sexually immoral and again I don't I don't mean to place a
[2:40:52.840 --> 2:40:58.760]  judgment on this man but he had sexual diseases he had sex with prostitutes he
[2:40:58.760 --> 2:41:03.880]  was a drug addict and so if you're gonna look at Alistair Crowley as this new
[2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:10.120]  age guru I think that he is another failure in in that stance because the
[2:41:10.120 --> 2:41:13.840]  enlightenment teachings is supposed to make you a better person make you
[2:41:13.840 --> 2:41:18.640]  understand your place in in in this universe and as a human and and connect
[2:41:18.640 --> 2:41:22.200]  you with with your other humans and with the source of your creator and these
[2:41:22.200 --> 2:41:26.560]  divine rules and what we're supposed to do and and Crowley was just an utter
[2:41:26.560 --> 2:41:31.200]  failure and I can even read some of the quotes from Crowley himself where he
[2:41:31.200 --> 2:41:35.400]  says to worship people with fire and blood here's a quote from the book of
[2:41:35.400 --> 2:41:39.360]  the law which one of his books that he claims was dictated to him by a demon
[2:41:39.360 --> 2:41:42.960]  that had possessed him his wife and you know where you look at the teachings of
[2:41:42.960 --> 2:41:46.480]  Jesus or Mahabharata Buddha and they're gonna be treat your neighbor like
[2:41:46.480 --> 2:41:50.440]  yourself don't steal be a good person and here's a here's a teaching from Alistair
[2:41:50.440 --> 2:41:55.480]  Crowley page 41 of the book of the law damn them who pity kill and torture
[2:41:55.480 --> 2:41:59.840]  spare them not the blood the best blood is the blood of the moon and then the
[2:41:59.840 --> 2:42:05.160]  fresh blood of a truck of a child and last that of the beast worship me with
[2:42:05.160 --> 2:42:10.400]  fire and blood and swords and spears a just an utter evil person that that
[2:42:10.400 --> 2:42:17.120]  taught completely contradictory contradictory philosophies to the
[2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:21.440]  the code of morality that humanity should live by no I couldn't agree more
[2:42:21.440 --> 2:42:26.280]  and it did just disgust me whenever I you know turn on the BBC or the Discovery
[2:42:26.280 --> 2:42:29.680]  Channel and all of a sudden I'm hearing you know Crowley's praises and he's so
[2:42:29.680 --> 2:42:34.320]  misunderstood and his study of Lucifer was really the study of technology and
[2:42:34.320 --> 2:42:38.200]  he's a great man and he was a real renaissance man and we should all follow
[2:42:38.200 --> 2:42:43.480]  him it is it's it's more than perverse now your new book is entitled the
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:48.200]  Illuminati facts and fiction and the thing is that the Illuminati is about
[2:42:48.200 --> 2:42:53.560]  to take center stage in the mainstream consciousness with this new film angels
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:42:59.040]  and demons based on the prequel till the Da Vinci code by Dan Brown and we
[2:42:59.040 --> 2:43:02.400]  discussed that a little bit on on my show but why don't you go over for the
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:08.680]  Alex Jones listeners yeah the movie breaks next week starring Tom Hanks
[2:43:08.680 --> 2:43:13.400]  and it's not just an ordinary film about the Illuminati it's based on Dan
[2:43:13.400 --> 2:43:18.480]  Brown's novel the angels and demons who is the author of the very popular
[2:43:18.480 --> 2:43:25.320]  Da Vinci code which has sold over 60 million copies as of several years ago
[2:43:25.320 --> 2:43:29.720]  and as everybody probably knows that Da Vinci code gives this conspiracy theory
[2:43:29.720 --> 2:43:34.320]  that Jesus had a family and that the secret societies are hiding that family
[2:43:34.320 --> 2:43:38.480]  from the evil Catholic Church who has their secret societies that are
[2:43:38.480 --> 2:43:41.840]  tracking down the family members and killing them and it was a very very
[2:43:41.840 --> 2:43:46.320]  controversial book when the movie came out it was just the talk of the dinner
[2:43:46.320 --> 2:43:51.880]  table around the world angels and demons is the prequel to that the book was
[2:43:51.880 --> 2:43:58.800]  published in 2000 just a few years before angels and demons and it's about
[2:43:58.800 --> 2:44:04.400]  the Illuminati plotting to blow up Vatican City in Rome with an anti-matter
[2:44:04.400 --> 2:44:12.720]  bomb as a retribution for them allegedly arresting their members back in
[2:44:12.720 --> 2:44:19.520]  the past and it's a fascinating read I don't really read fictional books but I
[2:44:19.520 --> 2:44:22.920]  knew that this was going to be huge and I had to get up to speed on it so I did
[2:44:22.920 --> 2:44:28.320]  read the book and what we can do is go through some of the blatant lies and
[2:44:28.320 --> 2:44:33.360]  disinformation that Brown mixes in because what's interesting about that
[2:44:33.360 --> 2:44:37.760]  book is that he mixes in facts and fiction and in the beginning of the book
[2:44:37.760 --> 2:44:43.800]  just like in the Da Vinci code he says that the Illuminati's real that this
[2:44:43.800 --> 2:44:49.080]  book is based on facts just the story is a fictional story about this man that is
[2:44:49.080 --> 2:44:54.880]  a Harvard teacher and an expert in the Illuminati and symbology so religious
[2:44:54.880 --> 2:45:00.480]  symbols and so the story leads you to believe that the Illuminati has been
[2:45:00.480 --> 2:45:05.520]  secretly continuing to exist and now is going to blow up Vatican City and Tom
[2:45:05.520 --> 2:45:11.520]  Hanks needs to go and save the Vatican from this huge explosion and the
[2:45:11.520 --> 2:45:16.000]  Vatican's having their voting in a new pope and so it's the center stage of
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:19.440]  the world and everybody's watching it and it's this big ordeal of him trying to
[2:45:19.440 --> 2:45:24.440]  track down the anti-matter from the Illuminati but what's interesting is
[2:45:24.440 --> 2:45:30.600]  that Dan Brown in the book mixes in actual historical Illuminati references
[2:45:30.600 --> 2:45:38.600]  and quotes and mentions that they were had infiltrated the Masons and became a
[2:45:38.600 --> 2:45:45.200]  society within the Masons mentions the the popular internet websites for
[2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:49.120]  searching for the Illuminati in the book one of his characters claims that he
[2:45:49.120 --> 2:45:52.760]  did a search on Google for the Illuminati and thousands of results came
[2:45:52.760 --> 2:45:58.720]  and he noticed that people still believe that the Illuminati exists he mixes in
[2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:03.640]  actual quotes from I think Winston Churchill and talks about the the all
[2:46:03.640 --> 2:46:09.400]  seeing eye on the dollar bill and and does blend in some interesting real
[2:46:09.400 --> 2:46:16.520]  information with with the story what he gets wrong is that he makes the the
[2:46:16.520 --> 2:46:20.480]  Illuminati out to seem like a they're the good guys except that they're now
[2:46:20.480 --> 2:46:25.240]  just going to be evil and blow up the Vatican but the the version that Dan
[2:46:25.240 --> 2:46:29.880]  Brown presents is that the Illuminati was a group of scientists not though not
[2:46:29.880 --> 2:46:34.560]  a political group a group of scientists and he even gets the date wrong because
[2:46:34.560 --> 2:46:38.640]  he places them way way earlier the original Illuminati founded in the
[2:46:38.640 --> 2:46:44.640]  1700s but the angels and demons revolves around the famous artist
[2:46:44.640 --> 2:46:51.240]  sculptor Bernini Galileo the Galileo was the man that popularized
[2:46:51.240 --> 2:46:55.760]  the heliocentrism which is the idea that the earth revolves around the sun and
[2:46:55.760 --> 2:47:00.320]  not vice versa as the church taught the Catholic Church taught but then Brown
[2:47:00.320 --> 2:47:07.160]  says that Copernicus that Giovanni Bernini that Galileo they were all in the
[2:47:07.160 --> 2:47:10.680]  Illuminati and it was just a group of scientists and then the Catholic Church
[2:47:10.680 --> 2:47:15.560]  was pursuing them and torturing them and killing scientists including
[2:47:15.560 --> 2:47:20.160]  Copernicus that's what Dan Brown says which did not happen then Dan Brown
[2:47:20.160 --> 2:47:25.600]  utterly created that fiction Copernicus died when he was 70 years old in the
[2:47:25.600 --> 2:47:31.760]  1500s which is quite an old age so he gives this false representation that
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:36.320]  the poor scientists were persecuted by the Catholic Church which were
[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:42.440]  persecuting people and were very corrupt and very evil and non-Christian and
[2:47:42.440 --> 2:47:47.800]  continue to give Christians a bad name for the inquisition and and the
[2:47:47.800 --> 2:47:53.800]  activities that they were involved in but it's fascinating to see a couple
[2:47:53.800 --> 2:48:01.160]  other instances that he mixes in that he claims are our fact that that are just
[2:48:01.160 --> 2:48:06.800]  clearly fraud he mentioned that the Illuminati had these ambigran ambigram
[2:48:06.800 --> 2:48:13.200]  brands and that they were branding people with this iron brand sort of like
[2:48:13.200 --> 2:48:19.800]  you brand a cattle in repribution for the Vatican branding the cross on
[2:48:19.800 --> 2:48:24.120]  heretics which I don't think actually happened he mentioned a couple other
[2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:30.520]  interesting facets that the Bilderberg group financed the Illuminati so he
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:34.840]  mentioned the Bilderberg group the Freemasons the dollar bill symbology
[2:48:34.840 --> 2:48:42.360]  architecture symbols and and all this interesting somewhat factual information
[2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:46.560]  and then later what I'll get into is some of the interesting ties that that
[2:48:46.560 --> 2:48:53.080]  Dan Brown himself has to the Illuminati very very fascinating connections that
[2:48:53.080 --> 2:48:58.480]  he himself has and even continues to have along with his publisher yeah and
[2:48:58.480 --> 2:49:02.000]  you know when the masses see this because really they don't read anymore
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:06.040]  unless Oprah tells them to or it's a big smash hit like the Da Vinci coach so the
[2:49:06.040 --> 2:49:09.800]  majority of people really haven't read angels and demons they're gonna be like
[2:49:09.800 --> 2:49:15.280]  oh you you saw that movie whenever you talk about you know the new world order
[2:49:15.280 --> 2:49:19.160]  or the Illuminati oh you saw that movie yeah that's yeah they're not real that's
[2:49:19.160 --> 2:49:23.040]  just a movie and you're just like well actually no the Illuminati did exist and
[2:49:23.040 --> 2:49:27.840]  they still do really exist in other incantations and they've you know openly
[2:49:27.840 --> 2:49:31.800]  stated in their documents that they'll just go by another name and really saying
[2:49:31.800 --> 2:49:35.400]  that the Bilderberg group is funding the Illuminati it's vice-versa it's the
[2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:39.800]  people at the top that use the Bilderberg group that use the CFR that use
[2:49:39.800 --> 2:49:44.600]  the Bohemian Grove that use skull and bones as a means to an end and this is a
[2:49:44.600 --> 2:49:48.320]  do as thou wilt mentality why don't you talk about that the do is thou wilt
[2:49:48.320 --> 2:49:55.360]  mentality these people to do as thou wilt is the the key term that Alistair
[2:49:55.360 --> 2:49:59.600]  Crowley taught which which basically means do whatever you want don't worry
[2:49:59.600 --> 2:50:04.120]  about the consequences and so even in the Illuminati facts and fiction I have a
[2:50:04.120 --> 2:50:09.480]  section dedicated to the Illuminati mindset and I and I take a good look at
[2:50:09.480 --> 2:50:14.280]  their mindset and even consider play devil's advocate the possibility that
[2:50:14.280 --> 2:50:18.760]  they have the truth about existence and what are the implications for that but
[2:50:18.760 --> 2:50:24.560]  the do what thou wilt mentality is a social Darwinistic view that basically
[2:50:24.560 --> 2:50:29.720]  means just do whatever you want to do it doesn't matter take advantage of other
[2:50:29.720 --> 2:50:35.840]  people which is obviously the philosophy of these individuals they don't worry
[2:50:35.840 --> 2:50:40.360]  about any sort of divine repercussions they don't care about anybody else's
[2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:47.520]  feelings sanity health and they are leeches that are that are ruthless and
[2:50:47.520 --> 2:51:00.320]  and care only about themselves and we'll be back after this is the Alex Jones show

[2:56:11.720 --> 2:56:13.680]  method of antiquity
[2:56:13.680 --> 2:56:17.480]  uh... now a Aristotle was a student of play-doh
[2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:18.600]  play-doh had
[2:56:18.600 --> 2:56:21.120]  of this interesting concept of
[2:56:21.120 --> 2:56:24.040]  the philosopher king's ruling over
[2:56:24.040 --> 2:56:28.000]  the people now the philosopher king's were the super enlightened that new
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:28.760]  better
[2:56:28.760 --> 2:56:31.760]  and she and under his opinion should then
[2:56:31.760 --> 2:56:36.120]  decide what's best for the people and should rule over so you have this this
[2:56:36.120 --> 2:56:37.440]  individual
[2:56:37.440 --> 2:56:40.800]  that donated this money under the condition that it changed the method to
[2:56:40.800 --> 2:56:41.400]  this
[2:56:41.400 --> 2:56:43.520]  eric fidel and method
[2:56:43.520 --> 2:56:47.240]  and and so what they do at this philips exeter academy is it
[2:56:47.240 --> 2:56:49.880]  they basically get a real education well
[2:56:49.880 --> 2:56:53.400]  most of us are stuck in the poor public school so over over there at this
[2:56:53.400 --> 2:56:57.880]  illuminati school who who symbol is actually a sun rising sun
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:56:59.880]  uh... with a beehive more masonic
[2:56:59.880 --> 2:57:02.040]  symbolic either that that's where they really
[2:57:02.040 --> 2:57:05.440]  send their children to get a good education and learn about how the world
[2:57:05.440 --> 2:57:06.160]  works
[2:57:06.160 --> 2:57:09.440]  uh... by the way adjusted for inflation that that five point eight million dollar
[2:57:09.440 --> 2:57:11.080]  donation today
[2:57:11.080 --> 2:57:13.880]  seventy four million dollars
[2:57:13.880 --> 2:57:17.560]  uh... donated to them and some other interesting graduates who were we're all
[2:57:17.560 --> 2:57:19.360]  going to be familiar with from this
[2:57:19.360 --> 2:57:20.960]  this academy
[2:57:20.960 --> 2:57:23.080]  david rockefeller jr
[2:57:23.080 --> 2:57:24.440]  jay rockefeller
[2:57:24.440 --> 2:57:27.720]  at center of west virginia who basically said that the internet needs to be shut
[2:57:27.720 --> 2:57:29.540]  down and wishes that he never
[2:57:29.540 --> 2:57:31.200]  uh... we never created it
[2:57:31.200 --> 2:57:35.680]  peter orzog director of the u s offices of management budget in brock obama
[2:57:35.680 --> 2:57:36.880]  cabinet
[2:57:36.880 --> 2:57:40.560]  uh... Gregory craig was also on the white house counsel
[2:57:40.560 --> 2:57:44.440]  uh... some other interesting individuals mark zuckerman founder of face book but
[2:57:44.440 --> 2:57:45.300]  you have
[2:57:45.300 --> 2:57:46.680]  these elite
[2:57:46.680 --> 2:57:50.560]  families that send their children there to get a real education and learn how
[2:57:50.560 --> 2:57:51.880]  the world
[2:57:51.880 --> 2:57:53.720]  actually works
[2:57:53.720 --> 2:57:57.800]  and and what's also interesting is that the publisher of angel the name of the
[2:57:57.800 --> 2:57:59.440]  original publisher was
[2:57:59.440 --> 2:58:02.120]  uh... random house who was owned
[2:58:02.120 --> 2:58:06.160]  by a subsidiary called the burlzman media group
[2:58:06.160 --> 2:58:09.880]  who according to the london times in their own c e o
[2:58:09.880 --> 2:58:13.160]  uh... back in two thousand and two admitted that they were the biggest
[2:58:13.160 --> 2:58:16.680]  publisher of nazi propaganda during world war two
[2:58:16.680 --> 2:58:19.040]  was fascinating that his publisher with the
[2:58:19.040 --> 2:58:20.800]  nazi propagandist another
[2:58:20.800 --> 2:58:23.520]  fitting out the limonati propaganda
[2:58:23.520 --> 2:58:26.920]  all uh... pretty much coincidence i'm sure mark

[3:00:15.360 --> 3:00:20.000]  we are back it's the alex jones show i'm jason bermas sitting in we're joined
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:25.040]  by mark dice and you know just a heads up to people i think that we're just
[3:00:25.040 --> 3:00:28.880]  about to ruin the end of the movie because it's really important where this
[3:00:28.880 --> 3:00:33.280]  film goes again it's going to be in the minds of millions because it's on the
[3:00:33.280 --> 3:00:37.640]  big screen and people don't read me more they don't think for themselves they
[3:00:37.640 --> 3:00:41.200]  watch the tv and they go to the movies and that's where they get their
[3:00:41.200 --> 3:00:46.280]  information from and really at the base of why this movie is so dangerous and
[3:00:46.280 --> 3:00:50.880]  why mark and i are focusing on this you know outside you know the illuminati
[3:00:50.880 --> 3:00:55.240]  fax versus fiction or facts and fiction does cover some of this stuff is because
[3:00:55.240 --> 3:00:58.360]  a lot of people are going to be talking about the illuminati and saying well
[3:00:58.360 --> 3:01:03.160]  that's just a movie mark let's give away the ending how does dan brown wrap up
[3:01:03.160 --> 3:01:08.640]  angels and demons it's fascinating i do admire him for his evil cunningness
[3:01:08.640 --> 3:01:12.960]  because they build up this tremendous story that the illuminati's been
[3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:16.840]  functioning for all these years that they've secretly been active you know
[3:01:16.840 --> 3:01:20.200]  through the builder group and everything building their new world order and now
[3:01:20.200 --> 3:01:25.120]  they're going to destroy the vatican and and unleash their true religion which
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:30.680]  is science and meanwhile the character tom hanks's character robert langton at
[3:01:30.680 --> 3:01:33.520]  first he was you know he's an expert on the illuminati but he thought that they
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:37.160]  went into extinction and like this can't be true and then he starts to realize
[3:01:37.160 --> 3:01:41.640]  that they really are still active and that that they've been active all this
[3:01:41.640 --> 3:01:47.880]  time and so they build it up and build it up and then it turns out that there
[3:01:47.880 --> 3:01:53.880]  actually is no such thing as the illuminati and it they really did according
[3:01:53.880 --> 3:01:59.360]  to the to the book in the film go into extinction back in the 1780s after they
[3:01:59.360 --> 3:02:05.840]  were discovered and that the entire plot to blow up vatican city was
[3:02:05.840 --> 3:02:11.960]  perpetuated by one rogue Catholic official with the camera lingo was like
[3:02:11.960 --> 3:02:17.920]  the assistant to the pope who decided to spring this plot to blow up the
[3:02:17.920 --> 3:02:24.160]  Vatican City but then at the last minute he himself saved Vatican City from the
[3:02:24.160 --> 3:02:30.200]  evil illuminati to show that God was triumphant and that the vatican and
[3:02:30.200 --> 3:02:35.200]  and then Christianity was triumphant over the evil illuminati and it looks
[3:02:35.200 --> 3:02:39.280]  like everybody was just afraid and had bought into the conspiracy theories
[3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:44.280]  including Tom Hanks character Robert Langdon who was an expert on the
[3:02:44.280 --> 3:02:50.080]  illuminati and it turns out that they really don't exist anymore and it it is
[3:02:50.080 --> 3:02:55.880]  only a conspiracy theory the website is mark dice.com the new book is the
[3:02:55.880 --> 3:02:58.680]  illuminati facts and fiction and we're gonna go to your phone calls
[3:02:58.680 --> 3:03:06.960]  joshwin florida you're on the air. I want to say mark dice man I followed
[3:03:06.960 --> 3:03:10.600]  your work for a while I've got your book and we actually you probably don't
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:15.160]  remember this but we actually tag-teamed Alan Colms the other day whenever he had
[3:03:15.160 --> 3:03:18.560]  Alex Jones on the show you're talking about a your book that you sent to
[3:03:18.560 --> 3:03:24.240]  Sean Hannity that was classic but I wanted to if I could real quickly let
[3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:29.080]  everyone know what the listeners know we are doing an oath keepers memorial tea
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:33.080]  party it's gonna be in Tampa Florida and we're just trying to get as many

[3:03:49.280 --> 3:03:53.640]  really enjoyed the first one I'll use it to wake up a lot of people so I think
[3:03:53.640 --> 3:03:56.520]  I've heard your phone calls into Colms show you and your friends that's
[3:03:56.520 --> 3:04:00.680]  fantastic keep keep at it. Alright thanks for the call Joshua and that shows
[3:04:00.680 --> 3:04:06.440]  mark that you know even as small as we all are individually we can have a great
[3:04:06.440 --> 3:04:11.280]  effect if we have the will to take action against these tyrants it's as easy
[3:04:11.280 --> 3:04:15.560]  as picking up the phone at times and challenging the position of a national
[3:04:15.560 --> 3:04:19.800]  figure. You know there's been times I don't even post many of the calls that
[3:04:19.800 --> 3:04:23.400]  I make anymore it's such a hassle but for anybody that's new to this you can

[3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:37.880]  wondering wait is it the Bilderberger so secret that they actually don't know
[3:04:37.880 --> 3:04:41.040]  about it and so I wanted to test that maybe I'll finish that on the other
[3:04:41.040 --> 3:04:45.080]  side. Yeah obviously you know when you first come across this they're like
[3:04:45.080 --> 3:04:48.360]  well someone's got to be talking about it somebody I know and trust and then you
[3:04:48.360 --> 3:04:52.120]  find out yeah they talk about it but they laugh at us when we bring it up it's
[3:04:52.120 --> 3:04:57.320]  the Alex Jones show with Jason Burmes. We'll be back after this infowars.com
[3:04:57.320 --> 3:05:00.520]  prismplanet.tv

[3:06:06.720 --> 3:06:11.200]  tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's
[3:06:11.200 --> 3:06:16.880]  just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded. The Obama deception
[3:06:16.880 --> 3:06:21.040]  completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the
[3:06:21.040 --> 3:06:25.800]  American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one of
[3:06:25.800 --> 3:06:29.560]  this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of
[3:06:29.560 --> 3:06:35.080]  personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers
[3:06:35.080 --> 3:06:40.280]  and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right, it's about a
[3:06:40.280 --> 3:06:46.120]  one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told
[3:06:46.120 --> 3:06:52.760]  and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com

[3:06:58.160 --> 3:07:05.440]  the people strike back. You are a rebel, admit it. You refuse to read the
[3:07:05.440 --> 3:07:09.080]  directions when assembling a new item. You won't ask for directions when you're
[3:07:09.080 --> 3:07:13.320]  lost. Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[3:07:13.320 --> 3:07:17.640]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot, and you can count your real friends on one
[3:07:17.640 --> 3:07:22.520]  hand. Well, join the club. Einstein failed math, quit school, and his rebel ideas
[3:07:22.520 --> 3:07:26.640]  led to some of the world's most amazing discoveries. Edison rebelled against the
[3:07:26.640 --> 3:07:31.040]  dark, failed over a thousand times, then invented the light bulb. George Washington
[3:07:31.040 --> 3:07:35.680]  rebelled against an entire country and led the creation of a new one. Now, Alex
[3:07:35.680 --> 3:07:40.000]  Jones is working to save that very country. So go ahead, be a rebel. Put in a

[3:08:11.720 --> 3:08:19.800]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from
[3:08:19.800 --> 3:08:26.160]  Austin, Texas. Alex Jones. All right, folks, we are back and we're joined by Mark
[3:08:26.160 --> 3:08:31.520]  Dice. Now, I just got some breaking news. This one's off a wire, and I want to get
[3:08:31.520 --> 3:08:34.320]  your take on this. I mean, we haven't really discussed some of the current
[3:08:34.320 --> 3:08:38.040]  issues, like this DHS document going after the alternative media, the
[3:08:38.040 --> 3:08:41.640]  patriot movement, people who are anti-technology, anti-illegal immigration,
[3:08:41.640 --> 3:08:48.080]  really anybody. Loan terrorist cells, leaderless organizations. It's so broad
[3:08:48.080 --> 3:08:54.520]  and so disgusting that it just disheartens me to see this at a wired. Bloggers,
[3:08:54.520 --> 3:09:00.200]  TV, go nuts over misleading Patriot Act arrest claims. See, we're misleading
[3:09:00.200 --> 3:09:04.320]  people when we tell them, hey, they arrested this 16-year-old kid for a
[3:09:04.320 --> 3:09:07.080]  bomb threat, and they're not letting anybody go talk to him, and they're
[3:09:07.080 --> 3:09:11.560]  holding him indefinitely with no bail. He's 16 years old. Let me just read this,
[3:09:11.560 --> 3:09:16.320]  because, of course, they demonize Alex Jones. God forbid, Alex Jones reports on
[3:09:16.320 --> 3:09:22.400]  what the media is reporting. We're the bad guys, by the way. It's the false TV
[3:09:22.400 --> 3:09:26.600]  news reports heard around the world. Of course, we're liars. Raleigh, North
[3:09:26.600 --> 3:09:31.760]  Carolina's WRAL5 reported last week that a 16-year-old bomb hoax suspect was
[3:09:31.760 --> 3:09:35.080]  hauled out of his mother's home by federal agents and is now being held
[3:09:35.080 --> 3:09:39.120]  without any legal rights on the authority of the 2001 USA Patriot Act,
[3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:44.200]  which suspends the Constitution. This tale of injustice has since shown up on the
[3:09:44.200 --> 3:09:49.280]  Drudge Report, Dig, Reddit, and thousands of blogs and shoot from the
[3:09:49.280 --> 3:09:54.160]  hip mailing list. The boy's name is rising on the Google Trends list. Radio
[3:09:54.160 --> 3:09:58.120]  show host Alex Jones interviewed the boy's mother on Tuesday, and pundits on
[3:09:58.120 --> 3:10:01.480]  the left and right are seizing on the story to rail against the government's
[3:10:01.480 --> 3:10:05.720]  unfettered power to make an innocent citizen disappear at will. Some outraged
[3:10:05.720 --> 3:10:08.920]  reports are claiming that the teenager hasn't even been charged with a crime.
[3:10:08.920 --> 3:10:13.800]  The arrest of the teenager is real enough. FBI agents investigating a
[3:10:13.800 --> 3:10:18.440]  February 15th bomb hoax that evacuated the mechanical engineering building at
[3:10:18.440 --> 3:10:22.160]  Purdue University traced the phone call to the juveniles Oxford, North Carolina
[3:10:22.160 --> 3:10:27.640]  home. His mother served his mother with a search warrant and arrested the
[3:10:27.640 --> 3:10:31.280]  teen. See, they don't say they came in the middle of the night and jackbooted them.
[3:10:31.280 --> 3:10:34.760]  Oh, they served a warrant and arrested the teen. He's 16 years old, and remember, the
[3:10:34.760 --> 3:10:39.160]  Supreme Court is now going to rule on whether they can put minors away for
[3:10:39.160 --> 3:10:43.280]  life. That's right, minors away for life, and then they'll just lower and lower
[3:10:43.280 --> 3:10:47.160]  what that standard is, you know, from serious crimes, from murder or rape, to
[3:10:47.160 --> 3:10:50.960]  oh, you're speaking out against the government, terrorist, life in prison, you
[3:10:50.960 --> 3:10:55.400]  could be an 88-year-old kid if they pass that. It's it's disgusting. They issued a
[3:10:55.400 --> 3:10:58.880]  press release about it omitting the suspect's name. That was on March 5th,
[3:10:58.880 --> 3:11:02.360]  and he's been held without bail in Indiana ever since. Well, not only without
[3:11:02.360 --> 3:11:05.960]  bail since March 5th, apparently no one's even been able to talk to the kid.
[3:11:05.960 --> 3:11:10.480]  The claim is that the boy is the victim of the USA Patriot Act, though it appears
[3:11:10.480 --> 3:11:14.520]  that that's cut from whole cloth. Well, there's plenty to criticize about the
[3:11:14.520 --> 3:11:19.480]  post-911 law. See, they act like, oh, we're on your side. It doesn't contain any
[3:11:19.480 --> 3:11:23.200]  provision that abrogates the defendant's right to a trial. It's also not
[3:11:23.200 --> 3:11:26.720]  responsible for making a legal phone call in a bomb threat that's been a federal
[3:11:26.720 --> 3:11:31.680]  crime since 1939. So charge him with the crime, and then let him talk to a lawyer.
[3:11:31.680 --> 3:11:34.560]  That's how it should work in this country. Let him talk to his parents, but
[3:11:34.560 --> 3:11:38.560]  that's not what's happening. The boy's mother, Annette Lunderby, has even
[3:11:38.560 --> 3:11:42.080]  acknowledged, see, they act like she's acknowledged that it's not the Patriot
[3:11:42.080 --> 3:11:46.560]  Act, in interviews that her son has been formally charged, has a court-appointed
[3:11:46.560 --> 3:11:50.280]  attorney, and has already made appearances in front of a judge. No military
[3:11:50.280 --> 3:11:55.240]  tribunals here. On Alex Jones, Lunderby seemed to more or less admit that the US
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:11:59.760]  Patriot Act connection was something she dreamed up on her own. Yes, she dreamed it
[3:11:59.760 --> 3:12:03.720]  up. Here's the quotes they use, and they say they're charging him under the USA
[3:12:03.720 --> 3:12:07.000]  Patriot Act, so, well, they're not saying that, but that's exactly what they're
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:11.200]  doing. And then Jones says, well, it's in the newspaper. All of their actions point
[3:12:11.200 --> 3:12:16.360]  towards that, but they don't deny it either. You know, basically, it just says
[3:12:16.360 --> 3:12:19.360]  we're nuts. We shouldn't report on it. They're not using the Patriot Act, even
[3:12:19.360 --> 3:12:22.320]  though, again, they came in the middle of the night. They went and got this 16-year-old
[3:12:22.320 --> 3:12:26.640]  boy. And, you know, whether or not he did it, maybe he did do it. He should be
[3:12:26.640 --> 3:12:30.040]  charged with a crime, and he should do time like a juvenile. He shouldn't be
[3:12:30.040 --> 3:12:33.520]  charged as an adult. I can assure you that. And who knows if he'll ever get his
[3:12:33.520 --> 3:12:37.520]  day in court. Mark, what's your take on this article? Well, it's interesting that
[3:12:37.520 --> 3:12:42.480]  Wired Magazine would do that, unless they're doing an investigation about or
[3:12:42.480 --> 3:12:48.880]  a story about the IP spoofing, which is apparently, looks like what happened in
[3:12:48.880 --> 3:12:55.160]  this case, is that somebody had spoofed this guy's IP, and then you threw, through
[3:12:55.160 --> 3:12:59.480]  the internet, you can actually make phone calls to people and call or ID
[3:12:59.480 --> 3:13:03.680]  spoof and make it look like it was someone else. Which is, I don't know if that's
[3:13:03.680 --> 3:13:07.920]  even illegal anymore, but I'm sure that there's still services out there that
[3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:11.520]  do that. So, maybe if they were doing a story about that, but it is very strange
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:17.200]  that, this is from Wired Magazine, who several weeks ago did a very bizarre
[3:13:17.200 --> 3:13:22.080]  article about the Georgia Guidestones, and then said that I had inspired the
[3:13:22.080 --> 3:13:26.440]  vandalism against the Stones, and took a couple quotes from me out of context,
[3:13:26.440 --> 3:13:29.480]  and put it in the article. I don't know what is happening over there at Wired
[3:13:29.480 --> 3:13:34.120]  Magazine, but I do feel bad for this poor kid. Yeah, absolutely. All right, let's
[3:13:34.120 --> 3:13:38.320]  jump to a few more phone calls. Let's go to Kevin in Boston. Kevin, you're
[3:13:38.320 --> 3:13:44.640]  on the line. Yes, sir. Thank you for taking my call, Jason. Hello, Mark. And thank
[3:13:44.640 --> 3:13:49.800]  you to Stuart Rhodes for starting Oath Keepers. I was able to take the Oath
[3:13:49.800 --> 3:13:53.720]  Keepers pledge at Lexington Green this past April 19th, and it was a great
[3:13:53.720 --> 3:13:57.480]  event. I was glad to hear you having him on to promote the future events. I
[3:13:57.480 --> 3:14:03.240]  encourage people to get involved in that. I also sit on my local LEPC, local
[3:14:03.240 --> 3:14:09.080]  emergency planning committee, and with the so-called swine, now it's the H1N1,
[3:14:09.080 --> 3:14:15.240]  whatever they're calling, the man-made virus that we had to deal with. I'm in
[3:14:15.240 --> 3:14:19.480]  Massachusetts, and initially I thought it was just the Senate that had passed the
[3:14:19.480 --> 3:14:25.080]  bill and that it was in front of the rest of the legislature for debate, but I
[3:14:25.080 --> 3:14:29.360]  found out per the meeting that I was at when they kind of stood down, but they
[3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:34.320]  were in the stages of really ramping up, that the bill was on the governor's
[3:14:34.320 --> 3:14:40.320]  desk just waiting for his signature for basically martial law powers that our
[3:14:40.320 --> 3:14:46.280]  local Department of Health department head would be able to declare martial
[3:14:46.280 --> 3:14:50.600]  law, and it's all for health. If there's somebody in there that is
[3:14:50.600 --> 3:14:54.320]  refusing treatment and hasn't shown up to school, they may have to kick the
[3:14:54.320 --> 3:14:59.240]  doors in to go save us all. We know what these laws and these powers
[3:14:59.240 --> 3:15:02.320]  that are being passed are really set up for, and I'm sure that that will remain
[3:15:02.320 --> 3:15:07.640]  on his desk for future use when they're ready to move forward. I can
[3:15:07.640 --> 3:15:13.760]  confirm that they openly talk about martial law in these local meetings.
[3:15:13.760 --> 3:15:18.080]  The second side of that though is people shouldn't be afraid of this
[3:15:18.080 --> 3:15:22.280]  stuff. They should get mad and get active because the budget cuts we're all
[3:15:22.280 --> 3:15:27.080]  dealing with with this economy. The local forces are a real paper
[3:15:27.080 --> 3:15:33.480]  tiger to begin with. If they ever came to round up guns and things, they'd be
[3:15:33.480 --> 3:15:36.320]  asking an awful lot. These folks are overstretched dealing with their
[3:15:36.320 --> 3:15:41.560]  legitimate duties and tasks, and also the most local law enforcement will come
[3:15:41.560 --> 3:15:45.320]  over to our side. You go to an oath keepers meeting, and people are waking
[3:15:45.320 --> 3:15:49.440]  up in our law enforcement and the military. They know what's going on,
[3:15:49.440 --> 3:15:53.320]  and they're really on our side. They have to keep their job, keep their pension,
[3:15:53.320 --> 3:15:56.920]  keep their families going. Like all of us, we're running along as if
[3:15:56.920 --> 3:16:00.720]  everything's normal while the wheels are still in the wagon, but we know the bolts
[3:16:00.720 --> 3:16:04.400]  have been removed, and it's not going to go on like that forever. Take action,
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:09.240]  get active, and we can swing this thing around. Be positive, be
[3:16:09.240 --> 3:16:15.000]  not afraid, be outspoken. The large numbers, we're in the majority. Don't
[3:16:15.000 --> 3:16:18.880]  let them fool you into thinking you're out there by yourself. Do simple things.
[3:16:18.880 --> 3:16:23.440]  If you're not the type to stand up at a meeting and speak, seven million
[3:16:23.440 --> 3:16:28.400]  people applied for background checks, meaning they were applying to buy new
[3:16:28.400 --> 3:16:32.320]  guns since Obama took office. I don't know where everyone else is.
[3:16:32.320 --> 3:16:35.360]  Why isn't there 20 million new applications? They hear that as a
[3:16:35.360 --> 3:16:40.280]  vote in Washington, DC, and people can just grow a garden and show that they're
[3:16:40.280 --> 3:16:44.080]  being independent, show that you're awake. If you can't talk at a public
[3:16:44.080 --> 3:16:46.840]  meeting, you could talk to your friends and families. Get the Obama
[3:16:46.840 --> 3:16:50.760]  section, get it out there. I did that for Easter get-togethers. I'm
[3:16:50.760 --> 3:16:55.200]  a converted former liberal Democrat. Big government's not being used to
[3:16:55.200 --> 3:16:59.800]  help each other and help our fellow citizens. It's not used to be empowering.
[3:16:59.800 --> 3:17:03.200]  It's used to enslave, and I couldn't agree with you more, and I love the fact
[3:17:03.200 --> 3:17:05.640]  that you're showing this at Easter dinner, because I always tell people,
[3:17:05.640 --> 3:17:09.640]  hey, the family's around. This is the perfect time to throw in a DVD that
[3:17:09.640 --> 3:17:13.560]  matters to try to wake up the ones that you care about the most. I thank you for
[3:17:13.560 --> 3:17:17.600]  the call, Kevin, and really, Mark, this guy is speaking to what we can do as
[3:17:17.600 --> 3:17:21.040]  individuals, and you've had a huge success on YouTube and your actions.
[3:17:21.040 --> 3:17:25.320]  What's in the future for Mark Dice? I just want to continue down the path,
[3:17:25.320 --> 3:17:30.040]  you know, and I also want to encourage other people to do what I do, because I
[3:17:30.040 --> 3:17:34.040]  showed everybody how easy it was to call into these talk shows, and like I was
[3:17:34.040 --> 3:17:38.280]  talking about before the other break, when I first started doing this, and if
[3:17:38.280 --> 3:17:41.960]  you're first new to this kind of material, you start wondering you might
[3:17:41.960 --> 3:17:45.400]  look up to Sean Hanni and Glenn Beck, and you start thinking, man, maybe the
[3:17:45.400 --> 3:17:48.400]  Illuminati and the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, are so secret that
[3:17:48.400 --> 3:17:54.160]  these guys just don't know about it. So that was a possibility, and I
[3:17:54.160 --> 3:17:57.880]  am now completely debunked at just by calling into them and addressing these
[3:17:57.880 --> 3:18:03.200]  issues, even in a moderate way, and showing that not only do they know
[3:18:03.200 --> 3:18:07.200]  about it, but they won't talk about it, they ridicule me, and even your more
[3:18:07.200 --> 3:18:12.600]  supposed independent hosts like Michael Savage. You can find a clip on YouTube of
[3:18:12.600 --> 3:18:17.600]  me calling him, asking him about the Bilderberg group, and he doesn't want to
[3:18:17.600 --> 3:18:20.360]  talk about it, doesn't think it's important, and when I really got into
[3:18:20.360 --> 3:18:24.520]  calling into these shows years ago, I would be on hold to call in, and I would
[3:18:24.520 --> 3:18:29.000]  hear somebody else before me, Hammer Sean Hannity or Michael Savage, about a
[3:18:29.000 --> 3:18:35.000]  similar issue, and by doing that, you're speaking to millions of people who can
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:18:38.600]  then just go and Google the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, and that's
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:42.800]  what we need to do. We need to expose these people. I have some publicity
[3:18:42.800 --> 3:18:47.760]  campaigns that I'm trying to get out to, again, get into the mainstream press.
[3:18:47.760 --> 3:18:52.720]  People may know that I've had some fairly good success. What's called
[3:18:52.720 --> 3:18:57.520]  culture jamming is using the mainstream media against itself to get out our
[3:18:57.520 --> 3:19:02.880]  message, and so I have some ideas that I've been trying to do to continue down
[3:19:02.880 --> 3:19:07.760]  that path, and I just want to commend everybody for speaking out, and I mean I
[3:19:07.760 --> 3:19:12.080]  remember years ago when talking about 9-11 being an inside job was dangerous
[3:19:12.080 --> 3:19:17.440]  and scary, and so it's people like the listeners and people like Jason and Alex
[3:19:17.440 --> 3:19:22.320]  that have made a climate so that it's easier and safe for us to talk about it,
[3:19:22.320 --> 3:19:26.880]  and we just need to continue down that path. Exactly, you know, we have to take
[3:19:26.880 --> 3:19:31.280]  actions into our own hands. Don't wait for somebody else to burn a DVD and hand
[3:19:31.280 --> 3:19:34.800]  it out. Don't wait for somebody else to have a screening. Don't wait for somebody
[3:19:34.800 --> 3:19:39.080]  else to run for state senate. Don't wait for somebody else to become the city
[3:19:39.080 --> 3:19:43.560]  council member. You do it. You join Campaign for Liberty. You say, I don't
[3:19:43.560 --> 3:19:48.440]  like this document. You call DHS. The power is in your hands. It's the Alex
[3:19:48.440 --> 3:19:53.440]  Jones Show. We'll be back after this with Mark Dice, PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com.

[3:22:00.960 --> 3:22:06.720]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the
[3:22:06.720 --> 3:22:12.000]  spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I
[3:22:12.000 --> 3:22:16.400]  think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the
[3:22:16.400 --> 3:22:20.360]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people. Well,
[3:22:20.360 --> 3:22:25.000]  Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:29.160]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[3:22:29.160 --> 3:22:34.400]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:22:34.400 --> 3:22:40.880]  that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:22:40.880 --> 3:22:47.600]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:23:00.240 --> 3:23:04.640]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-
[3:23:04.640 --> 3:23:08.360]  hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know
[3:23:08.360 --> 3:23:12.240]  that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or
[3:23:12.240 --> 3:23:15.600]  gold? It's true. Seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this
[3:23:15.600 --> 3:23:19.400]  country, and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at
[3:23:19.400 --> 3:23:23.080]  Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[3:23:23.080 --> 3:23:28.320]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of
[3:23:28.320 --> 3:23:32.080]  nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These
[3:23:32.080 --> 3:23:35.960]  seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough
[3:23:35.960 --> 3:23:41.400]  seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[3:23:41.400 --> 3:23:52.280]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365.
[3:23:52.280 --> 3:23:57.800]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This
[3:23:57.800 --> 3:24:07.960]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[3:24:07.960 --> 3:24:12.400]  All right, folks. It's the final segment with Mark Dice of, of course, markdice.com.
[3:24:12.400 --> 3:24:16.560]  The new book is the Illuminati Facts and Fiction. We're carrying it here at
[3:24:16.560 --> 3:24:19.680]  infowars.com. Before I go back there, I want to thank another one of our great
[3:24:19.680 --> 3:24:27.760]  sponsors, pepperspray.com. You can call them at 1-800-908-9988. That's pepperspray.com.
[3:24:27.760 --> 3:24:32.680]  You know, if you live in a place like New York, like I do, and you can't get a
[3:24:32.680 --> 3:24:36.280]  carrying conceal permit, you can't carry a handgun, well, the next best thing is
[3:24:36.280 --> 3:24:40.280]  having something like pepperspray.com at your side. They have all sorts of
[3:24:40.280 --> 3:24:43.840]  different products to make you safer. You know, we just went over that story
[3:24:43.840 --> 3:24:49.360]  earlier today that this college student, thank God he had a gun, this guy runs in,
[3:24:49.360 --> 3:24:54.080]  two other gunmen run in, they separate the men from the women, and the guys are
[3:24:54.080 --> 3:24:56.520]  talking about how many bullets they have. The guy's like, oh, I've got enough
[3:24:56.520 --> 3:25:00.760]  bullets. Luckily, this guy pulls out a gun, kills one of the attackers, the other
[3:25:00.760 --> 3:25:04.920]  two get away, but police are looking for him, and saves everybody's life. Well, if
[3:25:04.920 --> 3:25:07.800]  you don't have a gun and you're in a similar situation, you want to be armed
[3:25:07.800 --> 3:25:11.880]  with something, and pepperspray.com provides that. It's pepperspray.com
[3:25:11.880 --> 3:25:18.600]  1-800-908-9988. Alright, back to Mark Dice. Mark, did you see that story, by the
[3:25:18.600 --> 3:25:22.400]  way, of this college student basically saving the lives of all his friends at a
[3:25:22.400 --> 3:25:29.000]  birthday party? I just heard about it on the show, and I think it's fantastic. You
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:34.240]  know, even Jesus was a pro-second amendment. He says in the Bible to sell
[3:25:34.240 --> 3:25:38.520]  some of your clothes and buy a sword, and so I think that that's awesome. I'm
[3:25:38.520 --> 3:25:41.840]  just wondering if they're gonna bring any charges against him, if he did not.
[3:25:41.840 --> 3:25:45.200]  I didn't catch if he had a concealed permit, but... Yeah, I'm not sure if that
[3:25:45.200 --> 3:25:48.680]  gun was even licensed, but the bottom line is we have a second amendment for a
[3:25:48.680 --> 3:25:51.840]  reason. It's not only for incidents like that, but it's against the tyrannical
[3:25:51.840 --> 3:25:55.720]  government, and that's why they're really trying to demonize gun owners in these
[3:25:55.720 --> 3:26:01.520]  latest DHS documents. Look, I've heard statistics. I think it's for every one
[3:26:01.520 --> 3:26:07.160]  crime that's committed with a gun. A gun prevents six or eight crimes, and
[3:26:07.160 --> 3:26:11.560]  you know, the gun advocates will point out very sad instances of children
[3:26:11.560 --> 3:26:15.680]  finding guns, and that's not because of the gun. That's because of the
[3:26:15.680 --> 3:26:19.960]  irresponsible parents, and if we're gonna put things into perspective like the
[3:26:19.960 --> 3:26:25.000]  big panic of the swine flu, if you really look at it, every single day over
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:32.200]  1,000 people a day die from cigarettes. So, we were having a global panic,
[3:26:32.200 --> 3:26:38.200]  just about a couple people coming down sick with this flu, which kills almost
[3:26:38.200 --> 3:26:43.840]  40,000 people a year when cigarettes kill over 1,000 people every day, and so I
[3:26:43.840 --> 3:26:47.720]  think that... I would urge everybody to go out and get a gun if you can get a
[3:26:47.720 --> 3:26:51.560]  concealed carry permit. That's fantastic. Just learn the rules. Learn how to
[3:26:51.560 --> 3:26:56.000]  handle a gun. Go and take a gun safety course so that you become familiar with
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:26:59.880]  the laws and with how to handle one properly. You know, you brought up Michael
[3:26:59.880 --> 3:27:03.760]  Savage and his unwillingness to talk about the Bilderberg group. What's your
[3:27:03.760 --> 3:27:08.600]  take on the fact that he's been banned from the UK, along with nine other public
[3:27:08.600 --> 3:27:13.200]  names, Fred Phelps being one of them, and then, you know, actual Aryan white
[3:27:13.200 --> 3:27:17.160]  supremacist people, but then they also have six names that they're not listing.
[3:27:17.160 --> 3:27:23.080]  What is your take on this? I think it's pretty sad because I don't think
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:27.520]  Michael Savage has advocated any sort of violence. I actually, I guess I have
[3:27:27.520 --> 3:27:30.880]  heard him make a couple references that we should turn the Middle East into a
[3:27:30.880 --> 3:27:36.000]  parking lot, and Nukit, which is completely the wrong attitude, and
[3:27:36.000 --> 3:27:39.840]  very irresponsible for him to say, but I don't think that he is necessarily
[3:27:39.840 --> 3:27:46.520]  urging violence, and it's very bizarre to have him added to this list of really
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:53.640]  terrorists and dangerous radicals. I think that maybe whoever it was that put
[3:27:53.640 --> 3:27:59.520]  him on that list just had a personal vendetta against him, possibly for maybe
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:05.400]  their sexual orientation, or some other instance that Michael Savage
[3:28:05.400 --> 3:28:08.800]  has mentioned that really struck a personal chord with them, but I think it's
[3:28:08.800 --> 3:28:11.480]  dangerous. When I first heard about it, I thought his show was banned. I thought,
[3:28:11.480 --> 3:28:14.320]  oh, they're just saying he's not going to be played on the airwaves, but then I
[3:28:14.320 --> 3:28:17.120]  want to read the article so that he personally is not allowed to go there.
[3:28:17.120 --> 3:28:19.960]  I don't know what's worse though, because at first I thought that same thing,
[3:28:19.960 --> 3:28:24.560]  so they can still listen to him, but he can't go to the country. I almost think
[3:28:24.560 --> 3:28:30.720]  it's worse if they ban the radio show. They're going to ban you because of a
[3:28:30.720 --> 3:28:34.200]  post that you put on your MySpace page or on your website. According to the
[3:28:34.200 --> 3:28:37.480]  Cyber Bullying Act, if that gets through, this isn't even the Cyber Security Act.
[3:28:37.480 --> 3:28:41.200]  Have you seen the Cyber Bullying Act yet? I've heard bits of it, and it's very
[3:28:41.200 --> 3:28:45.520]  scary. Oh my god. Well, let me just read you a section in the final moments here
[3:28:45.520 --> 3:28:49.640]  with Mark Dice. MarkDice.com is the website. Electronic communications
[3:28:49.640 --> 3:28:54.280]  provide anonymity to the perpetrator and the potential for widespread
[3:28:54.280 --> 3:28:58.720]  public distribution, potentially making them severely dangerous and cruel to
[3:28:58.720 --> 3:29:02.520]  youth. You know, what about this Twitter where people actually believe that the
[3:29:02.520 --> 3:29:07.360]  swine flu had mutated into a zombie-like virus? That speaks to the ignorance of
[3:29:07.360 --> 3:29:12.080]  people, not to us being cruel to the youth, but they will use anything they can
[3:29:12.080 --> 3:29:15.800]  to try to restrict the internet because that is where the alternative media and
[3:29:15.800 --> 3:29:19.280]  the Patriot community, the pro-constitution, and Bill of Rights people are
[3:29:19.280 --> 3:29:23.700]  having the greatest effect, Mark. Look, when I first heard Alex's report, the
[3:29:23.700 --> 3:29:28.480]  Mayak report, I actually thought that he was taken in by a hoax. I thought there's
[3:29:28.480 --> 3:29:32.400]  no way that this could be true. I thought somebody printed the document, and sure
[3:29:32.400 --> 3:29:35.840]  enough, I should have given Alex and you guys more credit. You check the sources,
[3:29:35.840 --> 3:29:39.320]  it's legitimate. They're really ramping up the propaganda against us, and we just
[3:29:39.320 --> 3:29:43.920]  need to keep it up in turn, getting out the word. That's right, we need to return
[3:29:43.920 --> 3:29:49.280]  the force even greater than what they're pushing against us. Mark Dice, author of
[3:29:49.280 --> 3:29:53.280]  the Illuminati Facts and Fiction, will be back. It's the Alex Jones. We're on the March. The
[3:29:53.280 --> 3:30:00.400]  Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:00.840 --> 3:30:05.000]  Hi, this is Peter Cronchner with Midas Resources. As you know, government
[3:30:05.000 --> 3:30:08.320]  spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise. What are you
[3:30:08.320 --> 3:30:12.160]  doing right now to protect yourself financially? As the economy continues to
[3:30:12.160 --> 3:30:15.680]  deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will
[3:30:15.680 --> 3:30:19.340]  lose their jobs and worse their life savings. Having your hard-earned money in
[3:30:19.340 --> 3:30:23.400]  banks, the stock market, or any other paper asset is a lose-lose deal. You'll
[3:30:23.400 --> 3:30:27.000]  lose on your capital investment, and you'll lose purchasing power as the dollar
[3:30:27.000 --> 3:30:30.520]  continues to devalue. One thing is certain, having physical possession of
[3:30:30.520 --> 3:30:33.720]  gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will
[3:30:33.720 --> 3:30:36.640]  never be worthless. If you've been thinking about investing in the physical
[3:30:36.640 --> 3:30:40.120]  possession of precious metals, I can help. Call me today at Peter Cronchner
[3:30:40.120 --> 3:30:46.280]  Novel at 800-686-2237-Extension 108, and I will take the time personally to put
[3:30:46.280 --> 3:30:49.800]  together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for. Call
[3:30:49.800 --> 3:30:55.800]  Peter 800-686-2237-Extension 108. You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to
[3:30:55.800 --> 3:31:00.880]  work hard for you. Call 800-686-2237-Extension 108.
[3:31:00.880 --> 3:31:06.880]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the
[3:31:06.880 --> 3:31:11.440]  spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as
[3:31:11.440 --> 3:31:17.440]  powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded. The Obama deception completely
[3:31:17.440 --> 3:31:21.280]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American
[3:31:21.280 --> 3:31:26.360]  people. While Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:31:26.360 --> 3:31:30.480]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:31:30.480 --> 3:31:36.240]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:31:36.240 --> 3:31:41.160]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:31:41.160 --> 3:31:47.880]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:33:20.760 --> 3:33:26.960]  All right folks, we are back. This is the Alex Jones show. I'm Jason Burma sitting in. I do my own little program here at
[3:33:26.960 --> 3:33:31.360]  prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com. That's gonna be nine to midnight central time.
[3:33:31.360 --> 3:33:36.120]  Tonight and tomorrow we do it five nights a week. That's right, we bring you seven
[3:33:36.120 --> 3:33:40.440]  hours of radio, five hours of video, at least every week live. We cover the
[3:33:40.440 --> 3:33:45.480]  hardcore issues and we of course let you have your say unfiltered, uncensored, and
[3:33:45.480 --> 3:33:48.600]  that's what we're gonna do right now. We're gonna blast through calls and
[3:33:48.600 --> 3:33:56.000]  information. Let's go to Jacob in Maryland. Jacob, you're online. Hello, Jason. How are you, sir?
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:34:02.520]  Good. Hey, I wanted to talk about two things. One, you talked about earlier how
[3:34:02.520 --> 3:34:08.640]  the masses will basically say, oh, you just watched this in a movie, so like, you
[3:34:08.640 --> 3:34:12.960]  it's fake. That happened before. Remember when the washroom came out? People were
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:19.280]  just saying that all that symbolism was trust from the, that he wasn't amazed or
[3:34:19.280 --> 3:34:23.560]  anything like that. Well, you know what, just go check out Alan Moore's
[3:34:23.560 --> 3:34:28.640]  bio. He openly talks about how he's a magician and his definition of magician
[3:34:28.640 --> 3:34:34.040]  is somebody who uses pictures and symbols and words to augment others'
[3:34:34.040 --> 3:34:38.160]  perception and reality. It's something similar to that. And I mean, just look at
[3:34:38.160 --> 3:34:42.360]  his body of work. Look, I like a lot of the stuff that Alan Moore has done. I
[3:34:42.360 --> 3:34:46.400]  think overall it has a positive message. But even, you know, my last guest, Mark
[3:34:46.400 --> 3:34:50.600]  Dice, really called him out on some of the things that were in V for Vendetta and
[3:34:50.600 --> 3:34:54.480]  some of those things I disagreed with in whole as well, such as, you know, the only
[3:34:54.480 --> 3:34:58.440]  way to win was a violent revolution at the end and he had to blow up a government
[3:34:58.440 --> 3:35:02.640]  building. I think that kind of sets us up. And to say that there's no Masonic
[3:35:02.640 --> 3:35:09.200]  symbolism in the Watchman is absolutely ludicrous. Right. And also, I think I
[3:35:09.200 --> 3:35:15.480]  figured out the establishment scheme. They want... Did you notice how a lot of
[3:35:15.480 --> 3:35:20.000]  people were becoming liberal or progressive over the election? What they
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:24.840]  did, I think, was they wanted to keep the status close. So that's why they had
[3:35:24.840 --> 3:35:29.760]  Obama come in. The Builderbergs chose Obama because of that. And also, you know,
[3:35:29.760 --> 3:35:35.240]  there's a book that I think you should read. It's called The Party System.
[3:35:35.240 --> 3:35:39.480]  It's written... It's a World War II novel. It exposes how the British Party
[3:35:39.480 --> 3:35:43.640]  System was fake. And it applies here because they're not really liberal or
[3:35:43.640 --> 3:35:46.520]  conservative. It's just two sides of the same coin. They keep everything...
[3:35:46.520 --> 3:35:51.680]  Absolutely. There is a false left-right paradigm at the top. And really, not even
[3:35:51.680 --> 3:35:55.640]  at the top. It's so transparent. The puppet masters are the people that are
[3:35:55.640 --> 3:35:59.200]  paying the lobbyists, the people that own the corporations, the people that are
[3:35:59.200 --> 3:36:02.480]  going to the Builderberg group, the people that are going to the Bohemian
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:07.240]  Grove Club. And really, congressmen are the majority of them. And I mean, the
[3:36:07.240 --> 3:36:11.800]  vast majority are nothing but really actors on the world stage, as Obama puts
[3:36:11.800 --> 3:36:15.320]  it. I thank you for the call, Jacob. Let's jump to Dave in California. Dave,
[3:36:15.320 --> 3:36:25.400]  you're on the air. Yes, sir. Hey, Jason. Can you hear me? Yes, sir. Yeah. Do we drop them?
[3:36:25.400 --> 3:36:30.480]  I'll go ahead. I'm here. I'm here. Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to get on there with
[3:36:30.480 --> 3:36:37.160]  Dice, but maybe you can have an outlook on this. I just recently watched both of
[3:36:37.160 --> 3:36:41.360]  Alex's films about... Because Dice knows so much about Bohemian Grove, and I just
[3:36:41.360 --> 3:36:45.640]  watched both of those films. He has on Bohemian Grove. Sure. Order of Death and
[3:36:45.640 --> 3:36:49.680]  Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove, both available at InfoWars or free on Google
[3:36:49.680 --> 3:36:56.000]  Video. Right. I guess it's probably best be addressed to Alex, though I wish he was
[3:36:56.000 --> 3:37:04.120]  there. But anyway, I was just wondering what anybody's take on... Wonder why so
[3:37:04.120 --> 3:37:12.040]  many journalists had tried to infiltrate there before Alex and couldn't, but then
[3:37:12.040 --> 3:37:16.560]  it was so easy for him. It wasn't really easy for him. First of all, what he did
[3:37:16.560 --> 3:37:19.960]  is he hooked up with the Trio Network. Do you know about the Trio Network at
[3:37:19.960 --> 3:37:23.320]  all? They're basically out of Europe, right? No. Okay. Trio Networks out of
[3:37:23.320 --> 3:37:29.560]  Europe. They were doing a film based on a book that John Ronson was writing. Do you
[3:37:29.560 --> 3:37:34.720]  know who John Ronson is? Yeah, basically. You know, independent BBC journalist. So
[3:37:34.720 --> 3:37:38.840]  Ronson gets a little bit of funding, and he goes around. He goes to Bilderberg
[3:37:38.840 --> 3:37:43.440]  with Jim Tucker, for instance. He goes to the UK. He interviews David Ike. And then
[3:37:43.440 --> 3:37:48.400]  for Alex, they got a contact out in California who had basically a land map,
[3:37:48.400 --> 3:37:53.560]  and they show that in Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove. And, sir, I don't know if
[3:37:53.560 --> 3:37:56.920]  you've ever been around the woods, but it's actually pretty easy to sneak in
[3:37:56.920 --> 3:38:01.240]  through a side shot in the woods. Alex is pretty conservative looking. He got in
[3:38:01.240 --> 3:38:05.520]  there with Mike Hansen, who is also, you know, another Anglo-Saxon conservative
[3:38:05.520 --> 3:38:09.560]  looking gentleman. They had a hip camera, and a lot of these guys have cameras
[3:38:09.560 --> 3:38:13.360]  around anyway. You know, they do take little pictures for their own club, and
[3:38:13.360 --> 3:38:17.200]  they only stayed for that evening. I think right after the cremation of care,
[3:38:17.200 --> 3:38:21.840]  they left. So really, he was only in there for something like, I think it was
[3:38:21.840 --> 3:38:26.280]  under eight hours. You know, they got a hotel room outside. They were funded by,
[3:38:26.280 --> 3:38:30.640]  you know, Trio Network, and they were able to go in, get that footage out, and
[3:38:30.640 --> 3:38:35.680]  put it out there. I mean, there's nothing nefarious about it. No one let Alex Jones
[3:38:35.680 --> 3:38:39.960]  in. And then on top of that, I would say this, you know, we got footage from inside
[3:38:39.960 --> 3:38:45.160]  the Grove about three or four years ago from a contact we got through Mark Dice.
[3:38:45.160 --> 3:38:49.000]  He was just a waiter inside the Grove, and he was actually, I don't know if you've
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:53.440]  seen that. I think they do show some of that in Dark Seek, not Dark Secrets, in
[3:38:53.440 --> 3:38:56.440]  order of death, where he goes inside the owl, and there's kind of like that little
[3:38:56.440 --> 3:39:00.160]  soundstage, and it's where they pump all the audio through, and they also have the
[3:39:00.160 --> 3:39:04.520]  effigy there. So it's been really multiple sources. I mean, we probably couldn't do it
[3:39:04.520 --> 3:39:08.720]  on our own, and the question is, after, you know, the 2000 infiltration, is it as
[3:39:08.720 --> 3:39:16.280]  easy? I don't know. You know, whenever I've seen a movie... Go ahead. I meant before he
[3:39:16.280 --> 3:39:20.440]  did that. I mean, it says in the film, all these people had tried it, but they had been
[3:39:20.440 --> 3:39:24.480]  unsuccessful. Yeah, but they're kind of public about it, and you know, a lot of... All right,
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:31.200]  for instance, the... Which anal do we have? We have the 1998 anal, I think it is. It goes
[3:39:31.200 --> 3:39:34.920]  through 10 years, and one of the pictures that really hasn't been published in it, and
[3:39:34.920 --> 3:39:39.200]  I'm going to do a whole thing on Bohemian Grove this summer when it comes up. You know,
[3:39:39.200 --> 3:39:43.400]  we got this Bohemian Grove skeet shoot hat sent to us, and it's really going to revolve
[3:39:43.400 --> 3:39:48.840]  around that, but one of them is a cartoonist for a major newspaper, and he's up there
[3:39:48.840 --> 3:39:55.080]  cartooning himself, basically, in the robe, as he's cartooning for the paper. So in other
[3:39:55.080 --> 3:39:57.800]  words, he's cartooning for the paper. He draws himself cartooning for the paper, and then
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:01.560]  they're the big thought bubble. He's actually with the occultist. He's in a robe. He has
[3:40:01.560 --> 3:40:06.240]  a candle. So a lot of mainstream media is invited there. They're just not allowed to
[3:40:06.240 --> 3:40:07.640]  report on it.
[3:40:07.640 --> 3:40:15.480]  Right. Well, I mean, why would you just out of hand dismiss it that they somehow might
[3:40:15.480 --> 3:40:22.120]  have wanted that to get out or something, and maybe he was allowed to do that or something?
[3:40:22.120 --> 3:40:26.880]  You know, I doubt it, because have you seen the 1980s broadcast where the mainstream media
[3:40:26.880 --> 3:40:34.320]  really does report on it? Like I'm talking ABC. Yeah, 1981, 1980, there's a ton of articles,
[3:40:34.320 --> 3:40:37.600]  not articles, but a ton of newscasts about the Bohemian Grove. They're going to be in
[3:40:37.600 --> 3:40:42.040]  my upcoming film, Invisible Empire. So it's not like Alex really treaded any new ground.
[3:40:42.040 --> 3:40:48.400]  I mean, the news clips I have, they show Mollick. They show that the logo is an owl. They show
[3:40:48.400 --> 3:40:54.840]  St. John of Maplenuck with his hands in front of his mouth. They admit that they act like
[3:40:54.840 --> 3:41:00.120]  they're all plays and they even show some of the pictures of these guys in drag. Okay.
[3:41:00.120 --> 3:41:04.920]  And this is Tom Brokaw and, you know, another head journalist. So they've done it before.
[3:41:04.920 --> 3:41:08.080]  You know, they've been there. It's been on the cover of many a magazine, but they kind
[3:41:08.080 --> 3:41:14.520]  of fell by the backside in the late 80s, early 90s. And Alex Jones just revamped the story.
[3:41:14.520 --> 3:41:18.640]  He was the first one to get in and really tape the entire ritual, not just show scan
[3:41:18.640 --> 3:41:23.560]  pictures or, you know, things that came out of the Grove, get original footage. And, you
[3:41:23.560 --> 3:41:28.240]  know, I just feel like the mainstream media doesn't want that story. That's why you haven't
[3:41:28.240 --> 3:41:29.240]  seen it.
[3:41:29.240 --> 3:41:33.800]  Well, I mean, what just, but why do you, I mean, such a place so guarded by, he said
[3:41:33.800 --> 3:41:39.080]  in the movie, secret service, guards in Sonoma County Sheriff's Department, how could you
[3:41:39.080 --> 3:41:44.440]  just walk? How would the parking lot not be? How could you just go in the parking lot?
[3:41:44.440 --> 3:41:48.640]  Like I said, like I said, he didn't go in the parking lot, man. Again, if you want to say
[3:41:48.640 --> 3:41:53.080]  if you, no, he didn't go in through the parking lot. If you watch the footage, he goes in
[3:41:53.080 --> 3:41:58.880]  through the side woods and he gets the map of the entire campgrounds from the local.
[3:41:58.880 --> 3:42:03.480]  Watch the Bohemian Grove. I've actually seen the map because the map is inside our Bohemian
[3:42:03.480 --> 3:42:08.120]  Grove. And like I said, when I do the Bohemian Grove episode here, and we're going to do
[3:42:08.120 --> 3:42:11.880]  that again in July, I think we're going to do it in the second week of July, the first
[3:42:11.880 --> 3:42:15.760]  day that it kicks off as long as it's not on a weekend, but they have the map. He saw
[3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:19.880]  where to go in through the woodline. He came in through the woodline. They show that part
[3:42:19.880 --> 3:42:24.320]  in the video. I mean, I've seen some of the raw tapes just going through it and whatnot.
[3:42:24.320 --> 3:42:28.400]  Went through the woodline and then they just got on and acted like they were with the hillbillies,
[3:42:28.400 --> 3:42:32.880]  which is the bush camp. You know, there's a ton of these little side camps and you would
[3:42:32.880 --> 3:42:37.400]  be surprised what you can do when you put your mind to it. Again, I'm telling you, nothing
[3:42:37.400 --> 3:42:41.200]  nefarious there. I thank you for the call, Dave. I know there's all these kooky conspiracies.
[3:42:41.200 --> 3:42:46.520]  Oh, Alex Jones was led in to expose or Alex Jones is actually a member of the Bohemian
[3:42:46.520 --> 3:42:52.160]  Grove Club. Alex Jones works with the Vatican to get in and he's covering up for them. Look,
[3:42:52.160 --> 3:42:56.240]  it's all Johnny Nonsense. I know the man. I know the work here. I don't think that they
[3:42:56.240 --> 3:43:01.440]  wanted the cremation of care ceremony to get out there at all, at all, at all. I don't
[3:43:01.440 --> 3:43:07.400]  think it benefits them whatsoever. And I just can't get behind these, you know, crazy theories
[3:43:07.400 --> 3:43:12.200]  that people come up with. All right, let's go to Roger in Minneapolis. Roger, you're
[3:43:12.200 --> 3:43:19.200]  on the line. Yes, thank you. Mark, I have both your books. They're just absolutely excellent.
[3:43:19.200 --> 3:43:26.240]  I just finished your one and I want to compliment you on your just real thorough research. You
[3:43:26.240 --> 3:43:30.720]  don't leave anything to speculation and you don't print anything unless it's well, well
[3:43:30.720 --> 3:43:36.240]  documented. So with that, I say keep up your good work. Jason, I just wanted to say you
[3:43:36.240 --> 3:43:43.920]  do a great job when you pinch it for Alex. One of my main concerns with Alex is I'm
[3:43:43.920 --> 3:43:49.160]  trying to say it in a positive way. Sometimes when he has real good guests on, he interrupts
[3:43:49.160 --> 3:43:53.760]  a lot and once the person gets there and I'm so interested in hearing the information
[3:43:53.760 --> 3:43:58.160]  that Alex cuts the guy off. I know he means well, but I guess I would just like to get
[3:43:58.160 --> 3:44:03.640]  him a method when he has a guest on. Let the guest do a little more talking. I can pass
[3:44:03.640 --> 3:44:07.800]  that along Roger, but we do double book a lot of these guys and so we do get them on
[3:44:07.800 --> 3:44:11.800]  the info warrior with Jason Bermas as well and I tend to give them a little bit more
[3:44:11.800 --> 3:44:17.000]  room. I mean, Alex Jones is the T Rex of talk radio and he gets so worked up. Sometimes
[3:44:17.000 --> 3:44:21.360]  he's in it to win it and maybe he cuts people off a little too much. I don't know. I tend
[3:44:21.360 --> 3:44:24.840]  to like his style, but if you want a more laid back style, you want to hear more of what
[3:44:24.840 --> 3:44:28.920]  they have to say and a more color based show. I do one from nine to midnight. Go check it
[3:44:28.920 --> 3:44:34.760]  out. I thank you for the call, Roger. Let's go to Russ in Idaho. Russ, you're on the line.
[3:44:34.760 --> 3:44:43.040]  Thank you, Jason comment here really for Mark, but it's still work. I want to get to the
[3:44:43.040 --> 3:44:52.920]  root of the tree as well. Reading from a book printed by tech Mars synagogue of Satan page
[3:44:52.920 --> 3:45:02.440]  32, the year nine or 1770. Mayor and show Rothschild draws up plans for the creation
[3:45:02.440 --> 3:45:10.200]  of the Illuminati and interest Oscar Nazi Jew, Adam Wise up a crypto Jew. All right, we're
[3:45:10.200 --> 3:45:14.320]  done with you, sir. Thanks a lot for being anti-Semitic on the show. We'll move on to
[3:45:14.320 --> 3:45:21.880]  the next caller. Let's go to Kyle in Washington. Kyle, you're on the air. Hey, Jason, I came
[3:45:21.880 --> 3:45:27.640]  across this website called the pentacon.com that's C O N. Yeah, no, I know all about the
[3:45:27.640 --> 3:45:32.520]  pentacon and Craig and Aldo and we took them out to DC with us for a week. We stayed in
[3:45:32.520 --> 3:45:37.320]  the, I believe it was the Sheridan right outside of the Pentagon. And that's where supposedly
[3:45:37.320 --> 3:45:41.400]  some of these videos have been suppressed. We asked the manager of the Sheridan to give
[3:45:41.400 --> 3:45:45.640]  them there. I don't necessarily buy into their flyover theories. I've watched their material.
[3:45:45.640 --> 3:45:50.920]  I've had them on my radio shows. I just don't see the evidence there. I know the conflicting
[3:45:50.920 --> 3:45:55.160]  witness accounts, but there's all sorts of conflicting eyewitness accounts, you know,
[3:45:55.160 --> 3:46:00.520]  from the interview we did with Lloyd, the cab driver to the shinky brothers to the two,
[3:46:00.520 --> 3:46:05.920]  uh, what were they? I think they're two police officers that they, that they interviewed themselves.
[3:46:05.920 --> 3:46:10.080]  And you know, I'm all about people doing their own research and putting out films like that
[3:46:10.080 --> 3:46:14.400]  when I just don't happen to buy into it. I need more ads. I need to see, I need to see
[3:46:14.400 --> 3:46:19.160]  some of these videos be declassified. I think that that, that is a bold statement to say
[3:46:19.160 --> 3:46:24.480]  that the Pentagon definitely had a flyover and something else hit it. Uh, I don't know
[3:46:24.480 --> 3:46:26.040]  if that's true or not.
[3:46:26.040 --> 3:46:29.880]  I think though, but just looking at the cab, it just, it's like the, the, the lawn in the
[3:46:29.880 --> 3:46:35.680]  Pentagon, it's not burnt, but like his, his cab, like the hood is, it's just the windshield
[3:46:35.680 --> 3:46:40.560]  that's broken in the backseat, you know, is the passenger seat is bent and like there's
[3:46:40.560 --> 3:46:45.600]  only a small puncture and like the, uh, just the way backseat, just, uh,
[3:46:45.600 --> 3:46:48.960]  Do you know a book was in there? Do you by the way, do you know what book was in his cab
[3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:49.960]  at the time?
[3:46:49.960 --> 3:46:55.040]  Yeah. A David Ike book. Yeah. Children of the matrix. So look, my thing is, you know,
[3:46:55.040 --> 3:46:59.040]  he wasn't so coherent on the interview. He admitted that he did not actually see the
[3:46:59.040 --> 3:47:03.600]  plane hit the Pentagon. I really don't think that they, I know they named Lloyd as an accomplice
[3:47:03.600 --> 3:47:08.280]  early on. Uh, later they retracted that statement. I don't know what's going on there. I know
[3:47:08.280 --> 3:47:12.200]  his wife was a member of the FBI or whatever, but when you're living in Virginia, especially
[3:47:12.200 --> 3:47:17.220]  around the Pentagon and the DC area, a lot of people are employed by the government.
[3:47:17.220 --> 3:47:21.680]  Sometimes the conspiracy isn't as big as people make it out to be. And again, I stick to what
[3:47:21.680 --> 3:47:26.840]  I can prove. I, I encourage people to go out and be like Craig and Aldo and do those types
[3:47:26.840 --> 3:47:30.960]  of things, make their own documentaries, do their own research, but I've looked at the
[3:47:30.960 --> 3:47:35.560]  research. I can't get behind it. I need something more solid. I thank you for the call, Kyle.
[3:47:35.560 --> 3:47:39.320]  Let's jump to Scott in Washington. Scott, you're on the air.
[3:47:39.320 --> 3:47:45.920]  Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, thanks for having me on. Uh, I just want to say, uh, God bless
[3:47:45.920 --> 3:47:52.160]  Alex Jones and you and Mark Dice and people like you who, uh, expose the new world order
[3:47:52.160 --> 3:47:58.040]  for what it is. And I just want to say that I'm not smoking the baracky tobacco and I'm
[3:47:58.040 --> 3:48:04.880]  not accepting media lies and whatnot, whatever they choose to report. You know, we live in
[3:48:04.880 --> 3:48:10.520]  the information age where people get their information from. Well, they want you to get
[3:48:10.520 --> 3:48:16.560]  it from the mainline media or you're a terrorist. If you engage in the alternative media, well,
[3:48:16.560 --> 3:48:21.400]  you have a radically different viewpoint than what's, uh, what's being presented by corporate
[3:48:21.400 --> 3:48:26.520]  America and you're probably a danger to this country, sir. Well, yeah, TV is definitely
[3:48:26.520 --> 3:48:31.320]  brainwashing. So I just want people to wake up and realize that you guys are actually
[3:48:31.320 --> 3:48:35.080]  fighting for us, you know, well, thank you so much, Scott. And I encourage you to be
[3:48:35.080 --> 3:48:39.120]  your own info warrior and help out in any way you can. It's all about the will to take
[3:48:39.120 --> 3:48:45.360]  these bastard tyrants on and expose who they really are, show their organizations, show
[3:48:45.360 --> 3:48:49.680]  their, their mindset, you know, what they really, I mean, that's why Mark Dice is so
[3:48:49.680 --> 3:48:53.640]  important. That's why books like the Illuminati facts and fiction is important. That's why
[3:48:53.640 --> 3:48:57.880]  the resistance manifesto is important because a lot of the information there comes straight
[3:48:57.880 --> 3:49:02.120]  from the horse's mouth. They tell you what they're going to do to the population. Let's
[3:49:02.120 --> 3:49:06.120]  go to our next caller. Let's go to Cheryl in Winnipeg. Cheryl, you're on the line.
[3:49:06.120 --> 3:49:12.360]  Jason, how are you doing? Good. Um, I'm just, my comments are for a previous caller, a few
[3:49:12.360 --> 3:49:18.520]  callers ago about, uh, somehow debunking, uh, Mr. Jones, when he went into Bohemian
[3:49:18.520 --> 3:49:22.800]  Grove. Yeah, you know, he acted like he wasn't trying to debunk that he got in there, but
[3:49:22.800 --> 3:49:26.600]  then he's like, how did he do it? How did he do it? I mean, come on, go ahead. Okay.
[3:49:26.600 --> 3:49:30.920]  Well, you know what? The first time I ever saw anything about Bohemian Grove was that
[3:49:30.920 --> 3:49:36.480]  actually was, uh, English documentary on it where they followed him. Yeah, that's the
[3:49:36.480 --> 3:49:40.840]  one I'm talking about. That's the trio network documentary with John Ronson. I always felt
[3:49:40.840 --> 3:49:47.240]  it was really sad that that wasn't part of that wasn't included into, uh, his, uh, Alex
[3:49:47.240 --> 3:49:51.520]  Jones documentaries because, you know, John Ronson kind of treats it, but yeah, but the
[3:49:51.520 --> 3:49:56.200]  thing is that John Ronson kind of, he even owns up to the new world order exists and
[3:49:56.200 --> 3:50:00.520]  all this stuff, right? He says, oh yeah, it exists, but you know, it's not that bad.
[3:50:00.520 --> 3:50:04.120]  And yeah, the Bilderbergers want to do this and he kind of makes a living kind of goofing
[3:50:04.120 --> 3:50:08.520]  on us. Uh, his follow up to that book is called the men who stare at goats. Have you heard
[3:50:08.520 --> 3:50:12.880]  about that one? I know I haven't. Well, he, he not only did that, but there is another
[3:50:12.880 --> 3:50:17.560]  series, uh, based on the one of that Alex Jones was in adventures with extremists and
[3:50:17.560 --> 3:50:21.200]  I forget what the actual series was called. That was the book, but there's one, uh, based
[3:50:21.200 --> 3:50:26.440]  on, uh, the men who stare at goats and it's a three parter. I can't, oh, it's the secret
[3:50:26.440 --> 3:50:31.400]  rulers of the world. And he always, he, he, he actually shows you a lot of the facts,
[3:50:31.400 --> 3:50:35.280]  but then he takes a goofy spin on it and we're a little too worried and we're a little too
[3:50:35.280 --> 3:50:40.160]  nuts and yet exists, but it's good for us. So Ronson actually, I think his option that
[3:50:40.160 --> 3:50:44.960]  book to be made into a major motion picture. So it looks like he's even trying to get into
[3:50:44.960 --> 3:50:49.040]  the Hollywood game on top of it. I thank you for the call, Cheryl. Go check that stuff
[3:50:49.040 --> 3:50:52.920]  out. We're going to come back with the final segment, give you an overview of what we covered
[3:50:52.920 --> 3:50:57.560]  and if you missed any of it, remember, we do the 24 hour stream over at info wars.com
[3:50:57.560 --> 3:51:01.760]  and prisonplanet.tv.
[3:51:01.760 --> 3:51:05.400]  As the economy continues to plummet, many of us will have to make difficult choices and
[3:51:05.400 --> 3:51:10.280]  cut back on our expenses. One thing we cannot afford to cut back on though is our health.
[3:51:10.280 --> 3:51:14.880]  If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, weak immune health, or just feel tired, you

[3:52:02.080 --> 3:52:08.240]  In the New World Order�s War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We�ve
[3:52:08.240 --> 3:52:12.920]  got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[3:52:12.920 --> 3:52:13.920]  like to see.
[3:52:13.920 --> 3:52:19.120]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:52:19.120 --> 3:52:20.280]  of the American people.
[3:52:20.280 --> 3:52:24.880]  While Obama�s already fudging, he�s fudged since day one of this election.
[3:52:24.880 --> 3:52:30.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:30.000 --> 3:52:38.120]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that�s fascism.
[3:52:38.120 --> 3:52:42.920]  It�s not about left to right, it�s about a one-world government. This film documents
[3:52:42.920 --> 3:52:49.480]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the
[3:52:49.480 --> 3:52:56.800]  Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in super-high quality at PrismPlanet.tv,

[3:54:29.960 --> 3:54:36.360]  Who swine flew pandemic fear-mongering? They�re letting the quarantines go in China and Hong
[3:54:36.360 --> 3:54:40.240]  Kong, but they�re saying, �Hey, we still might have to go to level six.� Meanwhile,
[3:54:40.240 --> 3:54:46.160]  they order inflatable mortuaries and 24-hour cremation centers out in London. That�s
[3:54:46.160 --> 3:54:50.120]  out of the telegraph. We covered that in the first hour. We also covered these drills
[3:54:50.120 --> 3:54:55.880]  being run by NATO along the Russian border. Georgia trying to say that they staged a mutiny
[3:54:55.880 --> 3:55:01.280]  looks to be false. Remember, they also said that Russia snuck attack South Ossetia last
[3:55:01.280 --> 3:55:06.000]  year, when in fact Georgia did that, and Russia just defended themselves. I want to thank
[3:55:06.000 --> 3:55:13.440]  the final sponsor that makes this program possible, survivalseedbank.com. That�s survivalseedbank.com.
[3:55:13.440 --> 3:55:19.000]  It�s 877-327-0365. You want that victory garden? You want to have a blow against the
[3:55:19.000 --> 3:55:24.600]  New World Order? You want non-GMO food that you actually grow for your family and friends?
[3:55:24.600 --> 3:55:29.120]  Well, this is the way to do it. You can go to survivalist, or I�m sorry, it�s survivalseedbank.com.
[3:55:29.120 --> 3:55:37.320]  That�s survivalseedbank.com. 877-327-0365. You know it�s healthy when you do it, and
[3:55:37.320 --> 3:55:41.320]  it�s non-GMO. All right, let�s go to the last few callers. Let�s go to Lee in
[3:55:41.320 --> 3:55:42.920]  Canada. Lee, you�re on the air.
[3:55:42.920 --> 3:55:47.920]  Hi, Jason, am I on the air? Yes, you�re on the air.
[3:55:47.920 --> 3:56:01.200]  Jason, I have a suggestion for all these guys who got banned from YouTube, like the Elf
[3:56:01.200 --> 3:56:07.000]  Jones channel, U-Bernain, and enough respect. I just want to tell them, I know they�re
[3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:15.240]  listening, that if you guys can make an extra backup drive, like get an external hard drive,
[3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:21.040]  like a one-triggered-by-hard drive, and just keep on storing information, and if they ever
[3:56:21.040 --> 3:56:25.000]  ban you guys again, just make them another� You just re-upload everything else. The problem
[3:56:25.000 --> 3:56:29.520]  that it takes forever, and you know what, even a tear-a-drive, the average show, for
[3:56:29.520 --> 3:56:35.200]  instance, on PrismPlanet.tv, a two-hour Alex Jones show in WMV format. What�s that come
[3:56:35.200 --> 3:56:41.360]  out to, Paul? It�s usually about 250 to 360 megabytes, right? Okay, so let�s just
[3:56:41.360 --> 3:56:46.560]  do the math here. That�s only 300 shows. It�s less than a year�s worth of shows
[3:56:46.560 --> 3:56:51.840]  on one drive. That show, that thing�s been up 18 months, and that�s just his show.
[3:56:51.840 --> 3:56:56.000]  That�s Alex Jones�s show. Now, I do a three-hour show on top of that, so really
[3:56:56.000 --> 3:57:01.040]  that cuts the space in half to about 150 days. Then, none of our special reports can get
[3:57:01.040 --> 3:57:05.040]  there. It�s a great idea. I hope somebody can do it. We just don�t have the time in
[3:57:05.040 --> 3:57:09.680]  this office. We back everything up in WMV format and Flash format here. Good luck trying
[3:57:09.680 --> 3:57:14.320]  to find it, right, Paul? I mean, everything�s all over the place. I mean, we go through
[3:57:14.320 --> 3:57:19.880]  tear-a-drives like bread and butter here. I think we�re down to our last three tear-a-drives.
[3:57:19.880 --> 3:57:24.160]  You just can�t understand how intensive it is for me to be working on a film, for
[3:57:24.160 --> 3:57:29.320]  Rob Jacobson to be working on a separate film, for Rob Dew to be working on the best of DVD,
[3:57:29.320 --> 3:57:34.320]  you know, for Jason Douglas to be working on special effects. It�s very memory-intensive,
[3:57:34.320 --> 3:57:38.640]  and it�s very heavy on the staff here. I thank you for the call. Let�s go to our
[3:57:38.640 --> 3:57:41.920]  last caller, Derek, in Texas. You have the last word today.
[3:57:41.920 --> 3:57:47.760]  Hey, Jay, I�m going to run through a little math drill. First of all, Mark Dice inspired
[3:57:47.760 --> 3:57:54.000]  me to put my Neocon talk radio show call-ins on to YouTube. I never would have thought
[3:57:54.000 --> 3:57:59.080]  to do it, but just look at what Mark Dice did to me. Now, my little account has almost
[3:57:59.080 --> 3:58:06.320]  200,000 views. Now, if there are 500,000 people listening and just 1% of us do what
[3:58:06.320 --> 3:58:12.720]  Mark Dice has done, what I�ve done, that�s 5,000 times 173,000. That�s almost a billion,
[3:58:12.720 --> 3:58:16.680]  a billion. That�s waking up people, Jason. You�ve done it. I�ve done it. Mark Dice
[3:58:16.680 --> 3:58:20.720]  has done it. We all need to do it. God bless you, Derek. I agree, man. That�s
[3:58:20.720 --> 3:58:25.280]  the way to do it. Step up to the plate. Be your own hero, folks. That�s the way to
[3:58:25.280 --> 3:58:30.120]  do it. Go after the tyrants where you know how, whether it be the Second Amendment rights,
[3:58:30.120 --> 3:58:33.560]  whether it be your First Amendment rights, or whether it be a radio show or movie. It�s
[3:58:33.560 --> 3:58:40.560]  the Alex Jones Show. We�ll be back tomorrow.
[3:59:33.560 --> 3:59:49.440]  Thank you.
