[00:31.080 --> 00:38.200]  72nd break and Matt drudge rounds the corner over here and it was just like total and complete
[00:38.200 --> 00:43.680]  deer in the headlights and I'm still double-taking here and then he's hiding over there in the
[00:43.680 --> 00:47.320]  shadows right now I'm not kidding they're gonna say there's another conspiracy theory
[00:47.320 --> 00:53.960]  and we got Anthony good shardies Matt drudge over there he is over there come on just for
[00:53.960 --> 00:57.720]  a second to get the national media heart attack can you just walk over here behind the stage

[01:33.160 --> 01:40.600]  are gonna believe Matt drudge was here I didn't believe it only because it's like it was like
[01:40.600 --> 01:44.960]  such short notice it was like boom I remember years ago but anyways I'm not gonna get into
[01:44.960 --> 01:49.400]  it this is this is crazy all right well I'm not gonna be aggressive and turn the lights
[01:49.400 --> 01:53.000]  on over there and aim the document cam over there but Matt drudge came in said hi to me
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.360]  thought it was a three minute break and then went over there I'm definitely going to have
[01:56.360 --> 02:00.280]  to play a clip or something we have one of those special reports coming back from the
[02:00.280 --> 02:07.640]  next break all right this is this is now in a complete twilight zone hey but we got a
[02:07.640 --> 02:14.080]  new article up on info wars Obama arms ISIS militants pushes gun control on very same day
[02:14.080 --> 02:20.000]  Obama authorizes a resupplying Syrian opposition on the same day he demands gun control against
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.040]  American citizens and of course I was covering this bright bar article a lot that I missed
[02:24.040 --> 02:27.400]  I missed stuff all the time I mean I knew they were doing this but I know they were
[02:27.400 --> 02:34.280]  actually openly doing it Obama administration and UN announced global police force to fight
[02:34.280 --> 02:39.640]  extremism in US and then we've got all these callers that want to talk to me you know Matt
[02:39.640 --> 02:46.160]  has hosted the drudge report show for so long but also Rush Limbaugh so I would imagine he
[02:46.160 --> 02:50.120]  could come over here and actually host the show for us except he's not really here what
[02:50.120 --> 02:55.560]  if we put a microphone into the darkness coming out of the break and folks can do a voice
[02:55.560 --> 03:03.000]  print analysis to see if it's Matt Rush he's not going to do it I'm telling you this is
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.480]  so classically reclusive I wish I could do that he is back there right now I know it's
[03:09.480 --> 03:13.720]  taking a lot of work to get to this point I admire you maybe I should become reclusive
[03:13.720 --> 03:19.600]  huh he's a big guy I'm in good shape too I was like man who is that big guy who is that
[03:19.600 --> 03:24.960]  I recognize that guy who's that with him I was like oh my god what did I look like Buckley
[03:24.960 --> 03:33.440]  when he walked in I mean I literally was like who is that you are something else man god
[03:33.440 --> 03:38.120]  I tell you he's got a lot he's got a lot of class the way he pulls stuff off I'm kind
[03:38.120 --> 03:43.560]  of the opposite like a bull in a china shop a loose cannon anyways I was already super
[03:43.560 --> 03:47.880]  wound up today I've already had too many DNA forces today and this is now just pushing
[03:47.880 --> 03:52.720]  me over the edge I need some Jack Daniels Buckley immediately I'm sure I've not been
[03:52.720 --> 03:59.640]  drinking since last Thursday I've been a good boy and I've been being nice but I tell you
[03:59.640 --> 04:06.200]  I may have to I don't have any what do you call them tranquilizers but I think I need
[04:06.200 --> 04:12.080]  a tranquilizer dart or something alright folks we'll be right back no seriously because I'm
[04:12.080 --> 04:16.680]  starstruck right now this is crazy and the way he did it is even worse and then it's
[04:16.680 --> 04:22.400]  going to be even worse when they have like some major establishment White House driven
[04:22.400 --> 04:27.600]  publication saying I made it all up so we at least well we can't get a photo for Twitter
[04:27.600 --> 04:32.800]  what are we going to do the suspense is deafening drudgereport.com you can read up there where
[04:32.800 --> 04:37.760]  this guy put stuff on his Facebook the supposed shooter about how he just had so many pills
[04:37.760 --> 04:44.640]  he was on psychotropic lithium and other things that he ended up just taking five at a time
[04:44.640 --> 04:50.800]  so the question is was he on meds and the answer is does a bear you know do different
[04:50.800 --> 04:58.560]  things like jump or open the woods we'll be right back
[04:58.560 --> 05:03.480]  all you pro vaccine people should rejoice at this news anti-vaccine parents to stop receiving
[05:03.480 --> 05:07.960]  child care benefits under Australian no jab no pay law the new changes that will take
[05:07.960 --> 05:13.800]  effect on January 1st 2016 are projected to save the Australian government over 500 million
[05:13.800 --> 05:18.280]  dollars over four years and how many children are not receiving their vaccines according
[05:18.280 --> 05:24.160]  to the Australian childhood immunization register it's 1.77% I thought all you needed
[05:24.160 --> 05:29.040]  was 90% to have heard immunity the government believes that by removing the non-medical
[05:29.040 --> 05:33.080]  exemption it will reinforce the importance of immunization and protecting public health
[05:33.080 --> 05:36.840]  but what this is really about is the government wants to put anything in your body that they
[05:36.840 --> 05:41.040]  want and they want to make sure you bend over and take it a footnote in the article is that
[05:41.040 --> 05:45.960]  by 2020 childless couples will overtake those with children now I know where the next Muslim

[08:30.360 --> 08:38.520]  that drives us what is the matrix the matrix is the world that has been pulled over your
[08:38.520 --> 08:45.560]  eyes to blind you from the truth what true human beings or disease you're a cancer of
[08:45.560 --> 08:53.800]  this planet and we come as a cure they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million
[08:53.800 --> 08:57.960]  people in these reeducation centers and when i say eliminate i mean kill
[09:04.440 --> 09:11.880]  the matrix is a system neo that system is our enemy when you're inside you look around what do
[09:11.880 --> 09:19.320]  you see businessman teachers lawyers carpenters the very minds of the people we are trying to say
[09:19.320 --> 09:24.920]  but until we do these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy
[09:24.920 --> 09:30.920]  have to understand most of these people are not ready to be unplugged and many of them are so
[09:30.920 --> 09:38.680]  inert so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it we are trained to
[09:38.680 --> 09:43.400]  deceive if we have to you shouldn't trust me i will take the net our propaganda was beginning to
[09:43.400 --> 09:52.040]  play off and our lord save you for rock over genetically modified sounds private science
[09:56.200 --> 10:05.400]  i am not a dictator i'm the president this is a full dishonorable scientific mafia warfare

[10:42.360 --> 10:52.440]  is a war on for your mind stop being a moron stop being dishonorable within 15 years they say
[10:52.440 --> 11:00.600]  cnn that everyone will be merged with machines or will be obsolete i'm not gonna sit here and take
[11:00.600 --> 11:12.120]  it anymore welcome to the real world all right folks alex jones here back live well into the
[11:12.120 --> 11:17.080]  third hour i did not do this as a stunt neither did matt rudge he is here we got a hot mic over
[11:17.080 --> 11:22.680]  there he wants to stay literally in the shadows behind a curtain uh but this is the king of being
[11:22.680 --> 11:26.520]  able to push the story out and make it the number one story in the world david admit that in the
[11:26.520 --> 11:32.360]  new york times that he has more readers on politics and news than facebook the new york times and the
[11:32.360 --> 11:37.880]  washington post la times put together he's got some of our stories uh where the shooter himself
[11:37.880 --> 11:42.680]  said he was on a bunch of drugs uh he's linked to that today and that's the story they don't want
[11:42.680 --> 11:47.400]  out there or the story we're seeing in took a mixed racial christian hater and turned him into a
[11:47.400 --> 11:52.920]  right-wing white supremacist and turned him white they don't want people knowing that but matt drudge
[11:52.920 --> 11:59.960]  and his great crew can link to alternative stories foreign stories mainstream stories photos mug shots
[11:59.960 --> 12:04.360]  and really just focus on what matt drudge thinks is interesting and the public tends to agree with
[12:04.360 --> 12:10.840]  him that what he focuses in on is really catching the zeitgeist or the pulse of the people so he
[12:10.840 --> 12:17.080]  might have 50 links every day where facebook has 500 million but he has more traffic that is the
[12:17.080 --> 12:24.120]  true david versus goliath story and this is not scripted i have no idea where i should go uh matt
[12:24.120 --> 12:30.040]  drudge i guess you're here for a cl or why are you in austin texas well you were just talking
[12:30.040 --> 12:36.680]  about facebook and thanks again for having me here um i'm not on facebook um i don't do the
[12:36.680 --> 12:42.120]  socials i've got that little twitter thing even that's kind of disgusting you know i've been doing
[12:42.120 --> 12:47.240]  the internet as long as you've been doing this radio show alex literally every day as you have
[12:47.240 --> 12:51.240]  literally every day practically i think you've taken a little more time off than i have actually
[12:51.240 --> 12:57.000]  yes i've come and i can't say that about many people because you are a peer without peer and
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.160]  i'll tell you i was there before facebook i was there for before cnn.com i was there before
[13:03.160 --> 13:12.280]  or mostly all of them i have a very clear perception what the internet is in my mind
[13:12.280 --> 13:19.080]  i'm free i'm not defined by what they say the internet is uh meaning goldman sacks meaning
[13:19.080 --> 13:24.600]  who they invest in for the latest startup meaning the latest buzz feed or salon or gawker all
[13:24.600 --> 13:31.000]  well gawker is more independent but there is a lot of corporate makeover of the internet
[13:31.000 --> 13:37.560]  that i have not adapted to simply put uh i'm friends with some of them when i go to new york i
[13:37.560 --> 13:44.520]  make the sixth avenue rounds but i am not a part of that system i am a free thinker i'm an american
[13:46.680 --> 13:54.200]  i'm very concerned with what's happening so i just give him my all i've learned how to take
[13:54.200 --> 14:01.960]  care of myself and detach from outcomes because otherwise you can't survive and i don't know where
[14:01.960 --> 14:06.200]  you are on that topic that's i just follow my instinct because they always tell us how to adapt
[14:06.200 --> 14:12.200]  to be successful but really we're just adapting to their mindset i don't like i don't know you don't
[14:12.200 --> 14:20.520]  i have remained completely independent from all of them all of them i am not influenced
[14:20.520 --> 14:28.840]  by any of them i need no traffic from google i don't care if i get one traffic referral from google
[14:28.840 --> 14:34.600]  or bing or yahoo or any of these others it's always been that way now if you think of that
[14:35.240 --> 14:42.200]  set up how rare that is because everybody is so hungry for referrals for likes i don't need to be
[14:42.200 --> 14:46.680]  liked i don't need to be liked at all i don't care if there's a button right there at the top of
[14:46.680 --> 14:53.240]  a drudge saying like or dislike thumbs up thumbs down doesn't mean anything now i hope that you come
[14:54.040 --> 14:58.760]  doesn't mean you necessarily have to like what i have up there now where i've had a lot of success
[14:58.760 --> 15:03.320]  as i'm getting people from both sides of the aisle they've always had always a right-wing gossip
[15:03.320 --> 15:08.520]  monger mainly because of lawinsky in those years which by the way are back why aren't we seeing
[15:08.520 --> 15:14.920]  hillary's lovers excuse me why aren't we seeing hillary's lovers it's a good question where's the
[15:14.920 --> 15:22.760]  cover-up on this so many issues that are suppressed on a daily basis so that's what i try to do every
[15:22.760 --> 15:29.400]  morning incredible well it's amazing to have you here in austin texas and i tell you you
[15:29.400 --> 15:35.000]  certainly know how to make an entrance i'm in a 70 second break and i turn around and there's
[15:35.000 --> 15:42.120]  matt drudge just boom i tell you i almost had a heart attack a good one my cousin said he's never
[15:42.120 --> 15:48.920]  seen me look like that what was the word buckley you used and then i was flabbergasted i was flabbergasted
[15:48.920 --> 15:53.080]  use the word flabbergasted well i i tell you this is like the biggest christmas present
[15:53.080 --> 15:57.480]  early ever because i just admire true independence and i gotta tell you matt and you know this with
[15:57.480 --> 16:01.960]  your crew and congress knows this we wouldn't have won some of these gun battles some of these
[16:01.960 --> 16:06.440]  border battles some of these energy battles and we've lost some too but we would have lost so
[16:06.440 --> 16:11.080]  many of them if it wasn't for the focal point and even the white house and the democrats admit
[16:11.080 --> 16:14.360]  that i know you're saying you're nonpartisan i mean i would guess you're more of a libertarian
[16:14.360 --> 16:19.800]  correct me if i'm wrong you're just a freedom guy i can't be controlled i cannot be controlled
[16:20.360 --> 16:27.160]  there are no interests here but what i see as the world events period that is the truth of
[16:27.160 --> 16:32.840]  the situation well they hate the fact that they can't control the agenda the pentagon has briefings
[16:32.840 --> 16:38.680]  with the head of syops as you know saying we've got to stop drudge changing the subject and showing
[16:38.680 --> 16:42.920]  when we're lying i mean that's when you know that's i mean that's crazy town when you get
[16:42.920 --> 16:47.480]  what is it like is it surreal to think back to something you started back in the early 90s
[16:47.480 --> 16:53.000]  has now grown into this well no because it's been every day so it's just like it's it's happened so
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.040]  organically it started with one reader i don't know who that one reader was but it started with
[16:58.040 --> 17:05.240]  one reader i've never placed an ad anywhere ever this has all been a true organic reader to reader
[17:05.240 --> 17:10.600]  to reader to reader yes i dabbled in the corporate with the fox news show and the clear channels
[17:10.600 --> 17:16.680]  clear channel radio show for nine years but even that the website was on its own terms
[17:17.400 --> 17:22.680]  and remains so to this very many you've only gotten bigger since you stopped i don't know
[17:22.680 --> 17:28.120]  because this is another thing what the measurements that we have this is another bogus thing yesterday
[17:28.120 --> 17:35.640]  they released on the ap a wire twitter followers hillary is the queen of the twitters with 4.9
[17:35.640 --> 17:39.480]  million knit they don't say how many are fake they don't have to say how many are they admit the
[17:39.480 --> 17:44.680]  first ladies is like 80 percent well the ap did not do that alec so this whole thing this whole
[17:44.680 --> 17:50.600]  socials these socials you know beats one music which i'm obsessed with which has been launched on apple
[17:51.480 --> 17:56.440]  which is probably one of the best things they've done since Steve jobs died one radio station
[17:56.440 --> 18:00.920]  interesting they don't know how many listeners they have i heard some streams they were down
[18:00.920 --> 18:09.240]  to 5000 an hour this whole social media stuff is bogus facebook we have two billion users
[18:09.880 --> 18:17.480]  this is garbage this is designed to demoralize the individual i'll never have two billion followers
[18:18.200 --> 18:22.040]  the internet is what you make of it it's the same battle as it was in the beginning i remember
[18:22.040 --> 18:27.160]  having this argument with brit hume once live on c-span he goes oh the internet's all ufo's and
[18:28.040 --> 18:31.320]  all this crap and i said no the internet is what you make of it in the beginning they were
[18:31.320 --> 18:36.600]  dismissing the internet they were poo pooing it and isn't that good for us that that that for so
[18:36.600 --> 18:41.080]  long they were in arrogant denial and they seem like they still kind of are in arrogant denial
[18:41.080 --> 18:48.040]  no now they make it over in their image now it's these endless monotonous tweets meaningless
[18:48.040 --> 18:57.880]  meaningless uh to me it's all just a lot of nets a lot of confusion when the reality of the situation
[18:57.880 --> 19:05.720]  is life on earth has not changed we need facts we need events we need specifics on things not
[19:05.720 --> 19:11.160]  all this confusion it's almost they've made the internet over in their image these corporations
[19:11.160 --> 19:15.720]  and i think they're failing wait for a break skip the break oh sorry matt go ahead i didn't
[19:15.720 --> 19:20.680]  interrupt you say you think they're failing i think they're failing to the point this is a whole
[19:20.680 --> 19:25.080]  another discussion on how sick are the american people right now i've been saying they could put
[19:25.080 --> 19:31.320]  hillary clinton's brain in a jar in the oval office and she'd be elected people are really sick
[19:31.320 --> 19:35.400]  i think you know this deep in your soul and this is why you get demoralized here on this very set
[19:35.400 --> 19:42.360]  yeah i shouldn't people are sick how they've got here you've been done a wonderful arc over
[19:42.360 --> 19:49.880]  for almost decades now explaining why people are and have become so sick that being said
[19:49.880 --> 19:54.920]  people are willing to be made over in the image of these corporations the reason there's so much
[19:54.920 --> 20:00.520]  anger online also is the newspaper like the washington post will leave a comment section
[20:00.520 --> 20:05.720]  they don't care what you're saying they don't care what you're thinking that's why you get these
[20:05.720 --> 20:12.120]  anger that oh i i have to be you know i'm out here as a citizen and i'm operating on in their
[20:12.120 --> 20:18.520]  playground make your own playground the reason i'm here alex is you've made your own playground
[20:19.080 --> 20:27.400]  this is a figment of your imagination and the drudgerport is mine it is a very simple thesis
[20:27.960 --> 20:33.640]  you are what you dream you are and become and i wish americans would get out of the sickness
[20:33.640 --> 20:41.000]  and just become greater and well that's profound i mean because if we start creating our own maps
[20:41.000 --> 20:46.600]  our own world our own vision then there's no way for these cultural tyrants to program us and that's
[20:46.600 --> 20:51.880]  why they're pushing so hard to get more outrageous i mean is this the beginning of the end and to
[20:51.880 --> 20:59.320]  operate in their playgrounds so you become famous on youtube that's ridiculous i'm not saying you
[20:59.320 --> 21:04.280]  i'm saying the 13-year-old that just died that they're saying is the first youtube star that died
[21:04.280 --> 21:12.280]  you're playing in google's help it no i agree but i'm in your own place make your own the internet
[21:12.280 --> 21:18.920]  allows you to make your own dynamic your own universe why are you gravitating towards somebody
[21:18.920 --> 21:24.920]  else's universe and this is kind of again we're dredged to me when i look at it right now is a
[21:24.920 --> 21:31.800]  correction to this groupthink that has i totally agree with there's no difference from any of these
[21:31.800 --> 21:38.200]  websites you go up and down we talk about this what's the difference between the websites between
[21:38.200 --> 21:46.040]  a slate or a salon or a buzzfeed or a huff but what is the difference there isn't any and this is
[21:46.040 --> 21:53.240]  a travesty it's almost like it's almost like a weird conglomerate of groupthink that has developed
[21:53.240 --> 21:58.120]  in a dynamic era that should be vibrating it should be vibrating it should be controversial
[21:59.000 --> 22:05.000]  but i guess it's fear uh and that's not everybody is cut from the same genetic background as you
[22:05.000 --> 22:10.840]  or i alex of being brave and being able to stand up you're on the camera i'm not you're more brave
[22:10.840 --> 22:17.560]  than i am so this is the dynamic that i meant i would just like to wake people up stop operating
[22:17.560 --> 22:24.120]  in their playground stop it well let me say this i totally agree with you i've tried i couldn't pay
[22:24.120 --> 22:29.080]  for the bandwidth to put all of our videos out on our own platforms now we're doing that uh at
[22:29.080 --> 22:33.800]  prisonplanet.tv and the nightly news and putting ourselves you know up on television to reach people
[22:33.800 --> 22:38.840]  because it's kind of like jacking into the matrix going into their playground i try to then claw
[22:38.840 --> 22:43.160]  them over here to see what we're trying to do what you're trying to do but i totally agree with you
[22:43.160 --> 22:50.360]  the answer is for all of us to create our own systems our own ideas because vibrant independent
[22:50.360 --> 22:57.000]  ideas will trump this corporate plastic borg this this this brainwashing they're trying to push i mean
[22:57.000 --> 23:01.880]  banning father and mother uh banning you know the word husband and wife i mean that's so cultic
[23:01.880 --> 23:06.200]  that if i'd have been told ten years ago they were going to ban words like that i wouldn't have
[23:06.200 --> 23:11.320]  believed it they do it with straight faces i mean it has the left and of course the controlled
[23:11.320 --> 23:17.400]  right as well but have they gone collectively insane on on a control freak bent well or was
[23:17.400 --> 23:23.000]  there a strategy i would also advise people to not waste their time on this i had a supreme court
[23:23.000 --> 23:29.320]  justice tell me to my face it's over for me said mad it's over for you they've got the votes now to
[23:29.320 --> 23:33.880]  enforce copyright law you're out of there they're going to make it so headlines you can't even use
[23:33.880 --> 23:40.840]  headlines to have a supreme court justice say that to my face that it's over they've got the votes
[23:40.840 --> 23:48.040]  which means time is limited time is not forever how many more moons and sunrises will you see
[23:48.040 --> 23:54.760]  in your life uh rise and fall there's not that many it's a small amount so for people to be
[23:54.760 --> 24:00.840]  saying with this attitude oh i'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime no no you can't
[24:00.840 --> 24:06.760]  we're being enslaved now and that's it under the tpp they admit you can't put a headline
[24:06.760 --> 24:12.040]  to the new york times you're sending massive traffic to them they're claiming you're taking
[24:12.040 --> 24:17.560]  their words this is insane and you had the justice steven bryer said we need to look at a global law
[24:17.560 --> 24:22.200]  now member just recently getting lined up with it so they're getting ready for these decisions
[24:22.200 --> 24:26.440]  to come you thought obama care was shocking you thought some of these other decisions were shocking
[24:26.440 --> 24:33.560]  wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the supreme court decides you cannot have
[24:33.560 --> 24:40.440]  a website with news headlines linking across the board then that will end for me fine i've had a
[24:40.440 --> 24:45.800]  hell of a run it's 20 years next year or 20 years about now hell of a run i couldn't i couldn't have
[24:45.800 --> 24:52.040]  gone any further farther i feel completely i have gone as far out of the galaxy as i can
[24:52.040 --> 24:56.600]  on this i still want to stay out here but i've gone pretty damn far for what one individual
[24:56.600 --> 25:03.080]  can do in this culture but i'm talking about the future so i don't know why they've been successful
[25:03.080 --> 25:09.080]  in pushing everybody into these little ghettos of these facebook's and these tweets and uh these
[25:09.080 --> 25:15.800]  instagrams these instas this is ghetto this is ghetto this is corporate they're taking your
[25:15.800 --> 25:20.200]  they taking your energy they're taking your energy and you're getting nothing in return
[25:20.200 --> 25:24.120]  nothing they're dumbing the language down twitter's designed to reduce the language
[25:24.120 --> 25:30.440]  directly out of 1984 it's ing sock right ultimately it's boring and the kids are always off to
[25:30.440 --> 25:35.000]  something new except for the something new is owned by the same freaking company or financed
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.080]  by the same banking system so i'm here to say and this is the reason why i came to see you alex
[25:41.080 --> 25:46.760]  you are one of the very few who are operating under this this under this theory to be an
[25:46.760 --> 25:53.240]  independent american and as in a big way if your calling is media if your calling is media fine if
[25:53.240 --> 26:00.200]  your calling is sports whatever it is but you've got to be the greatest you can be now now before
[26:00.200 --> 26:05.880]  this country is so completely fractured and we're left with hillary's brain in the oval office in
[26:05.880 --> 26:12.440]  a jar because that's what we're getting she's old and she's sick she's not a contender they're making
[26:12.440 --> 26:17.080]  her a contender with these propped up saturday night live things it's like a head on a stick
[26:17.720 --> 26:24.520]  and then on the today's show with the gun three a head on a stick she is not a viable vibrant leader
[26:24.520 --> 26:33.320]  for this country of 300 including the illegals 380 million americans so the media is trying to put
[26:33.320 --> 26:39.640]  us to sleep you're not letting them alex i asked you this question man is the establishment which
[26:39.640 --> 26:44.440]  we know is diverse but there's different conglomerates is it panicking is it trying to push everything
[26:44.440 --> 26:49.640]  through right now because it knows people are waking up or is it just completely arrogant and
[26:49.640 --> 26:55.320]  thinks it's invincible it's trying to consolidate control yes and there is a sense of panic about
[26:55.320 --> 27:01.640]  it you look at a telemundo or a univision they're kind of panicked you look at some of these interviews
[27:01.640 --> 27:07.800]  that are happening this election cycle where trump comes along says a few things just a few things
[27:08.440 --> 27:15.560]  and soars to the top of the list that's profound imagine if we actually had a good selection of
[27:15.560 --> 27:20.200]  candidates who are saying a lot and i know crews and rand and all the rest however you've got to
[27:20.200 --> 27:25.480]  be dynamic in this atmosphere and it's a media country you've got to be dynamic in media that's
[27:25.480 --> 27:30.920]  the only thing that's going to work so i am left with thinking there's not a lot of time
[27:31.560 --> 27:38.440]  to be your greatest self especially online because i don't if it continues to get consolidated to
[27:38.440 --> 27:43.880]  this degree and then we're moving into the robots which you're so profound on and it's going to get
[27:43.880 --> 27:50.040]  really ugly really fast there's already automated news sites google news hello anybody
[27:50.040 --> 27:55.720]  they actually the idiots reading that crap think there is actually a human there there is no human
[27:55.720 --> 28:02.520]  there you are being programmed to being automated even up to your news and apple news i don't know
[28:02.520 --> 28:09.640]  what that's about that was also creepy a same corporate glaze over everything i don't see the
[28:09.640 --> 28:15.000]  world that way i live in a world that's free colorful vibrant takes chances bold stands
[28:15.000 --> 28:22.680]  up to power and that's where i've made my success well very eloquently said i mean really if we
[28:22.680 --> 28:27.080]  don't affect the battle space if we don't get involved in free speech now that's all you the
[28:27.080 --> 28:31.800]  listeners all the drudge fans fans of freedom no matter what color you are no matter what
[28:31.800 --> 28:36.520]  political ban we're going to lose everything we know what the talitarian looks like we know what
[28:36.520 --> 28:42.520]  oppression looks like we know what the dumb culture of of totalitarianism smells like this is it
[28:43.160 --> 28:48.760]  it's happening now and the future of the world is being decided so get out there make your own
[28:48.760 --> 28:52.360]  sites take action because matt you say you'll just go away if they do this we all know we're
[28:52.360 --> 28:56.440]  going to fight it we know they can't enforce it because if they can say that you can't even put
[28:56.440 --> 29:01.800]  a link up to a news site then that ends free speech and basic communication i mean i know
[29:01.800 --> 29:05.960]  they got the democrats out openly saying we need to bring in the fairness doctrine to the internet
[29:05.960 --> 29:10.600]  because of matt drudge because you quote affect elections well you're an american citizen that
[29:10.600 --> 29:16.040]  pays taxes and you're allowed to be programmed well but if they get enough sick people to elect
[29:16.040 --> 29:19.880]  it the demographics will take care of themselves we had a story this morning that they're finally
[29:19.880 --> 29:27.160]  releasing an artist in cuba who painted raul and cat and a fidel as a pig jailed without trial
[29:27.800 --> 29:32.120]  for 18 months look at germany where they're arresting people that criticize open borders look
[29:32.120 --> 29:37.880]  you've been so it's already happening i'm just warning this country that yes don't get into
[29:37.880 --> 29:45.480]  this false sense that you are an individual when you're on facebook no you're not you're a pawn
[29:45.480 --> 29:52.520]  in their scheme stay there we gotta come right we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones

[33:29.400 --> 33:33.400]  well i tell you a lot of energy in the building there's already a lot of energy in this building
[33:33.400 --> 33:41.000]  a lot of smiles with matt drudge here a dawn i guess went to the door and we said don't let
[33:41.000 --> 33:47.320]  strangers in but it was no stranger a matt drudge here in studio with us and characteristically uh
[33:47.320 --> 33:53.160]  very uh kind of like peter pan hard to hard to catch hard to find moves quick he is right over
[33:53.160 --> 33:58.360]  there in the dark with a handheld microphone of course the conspiracy theories will begin this
[33:58.360 --> 34:02.360]  isn't really matt drudge but people can tell it is matt drudge i've seen a lot of his speeches
[34:02.360 --> 34:06.680]  hurting pop in on shows here and there and it's always eloquent always thought-provoking this
[34:06.680 --> 34:11.960]  is particularly thought-provoking and will be a big newsmaker they will attempt to control reality
[34:11.960 --> 34:17.160]  and say how dare matt drudge hang out with that heretic alex jones and we're always hearing
[34:17.160 --> 34:21.160]  the last six seven years that matt drudge is over matt drudge doesn't exist but then they
[34:21.160 --> 34:26.040]  have to admit matt drudge is bigger than ever so this attempt to control reality or control
[34:26.040 --> 34:31.880]  who talks to who by these totalitarians that masquerade as liberals i don't think is working
[34:31.880 --> 34:37.320]  and now with bainer being forced out i think it shows the rumblings of the tea party beneath the
[34:37.320 --> 34:42.920]  surface so matt before you leave us and i really appreciate your time uh oh and by the way the
[34:42.920 --> 34:47.320]  presidential candidates that's exactly what you're saying the rumblings look at anybody
[34:47.320 --> 34:54.040]  who has any form of success in the polls is because they rumble uh where it's going to end up i don't
[34:54.040 --> 34:59.560]  know i'm very pessimistic i'm very pessimistic on this race because i'm just not so sure it's not
[34:59.560 --> 35:05.400]  going to end up with the dreaded brain in the in the jar in the oval office once known as hillary
[35:05.400 --> 35:11.640]  clinton who is hypothyroid anybody who is 70 years old who's hypothyroid you do not elect
[35:11.640 --> 35:17.480]  president ladies and gentlemen you don't do it now they'll say well it has to be who her vp is
[35:17.480 --> 35:22.360]  whether it's the castro from san antonio or the other castro from san antonio or the other castro
[35:22.360 --> 35:29.720]  from san antonio whoever it's going to be i i'm just shaking now after seeing nbc giving her
[35:29.720 --> 35:37.640]  endless hours of air time over the past 72 hours at hillary's back and she's back for real now what
[35:37.640 --> 35:42.600]  that means to you or me what it means to me i've got a long history with these people they're ugly
[35:42.600 --> 35:47.640]  they play dirty they sued me for 30 million dollars last time around with the approval of the president
[35:47.640 --> 35:53.240]  announced by the press secretary of the white house a civil action these people and they didn't
[35:53.240 --> 35:57.480]  have the nsa then they had echelon they had all these other things you were talking about even then
[35:58.280 --> 36:05.400]  hillary clinton with the nsa good luck if you dissent good luck if you dissent
[36:05.400 --> 36:10.120]  snowden i'll switch places with you you can come over here in rotten hell because that's what it's
[36:10.120 --> 36:15.160]  going to be so i'm very concerned with the lay of the land but the rumblings you're talking about
[36:15.160 --> 36:21.880]  out that we've seen a trump that we've seen a carly that do we see in a sanders yeah maybe also
[36:21.880 --> 36:29.880]  old old can the democrats find anybody under the age of 70 what is this oldness in a vibrant
[36:29.880 --> 36:35.720]  country that needs to go forward to a new century so i don't know i i'm hoping for surprises i'm
[36:35.720 --> 36:41.560]  hoping for some jolts we'll have to see on a few other subjects and i appreciate your time i'm
[36:41.560 --> 36:48.120]  quit bugging you uh there's so much going on in the world obama now is talking about well australia
[36:48.120 --> 36:53.000]  had a good plan we may have to do that that's clearly talking about gun confiscation now hillary's
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.680]  doing it cnn's has pundits just saying let's just take them do these people realize that this is the
[36:58.680 --> 37:03.880]  line of the sanity alamo if they really come out in the frontal assault on guns it means i think
[37:03.880 --> 37:10.120]  they're trying to start a civil war it just seems like insanity i mean they may think that they're
[37:10.120 --> 37:15.000]  stalling or something well because they're all armed themselves or they all have that
[37:15.000 --> 37:21.400]  security around them themselves they don't have to worry about i challenge hillary take away your
[37:21.400 --> 37:28.520]  secret service take it away now take away your secret service dismiss them have no security
[37:28.520 --> 37:35.720]  around you have no guns around you hillary i dare you i dare you obama same thing drop your guns
[37:35.720 --> 37:43.240]  obama take your secret service away obama take it all away leave the white house unguarded obama
[37:43.240 --> 37:47.480]  let everybody know there's no guns on the white house grounds obama you know what would happen
[37:47.480 --> 37:53.080]  in 30 seconds both of those people would no longer be on planet earth so they're asking us
[37:53.800 --> 38:01.320]  to drop our guns and to drop our security measures or or what so this thing is very real
[38:01.320 --> 38:07.080]  and i don't see how it's being taken seriously except for the sick voter you can underestimate
[38:07.080 --> 38:11.640]  the sickness of the american people right now they're really sick and that's to me i'm more
[38:11.640 --> 38:16.760]  angry at the sick americans than i am at obama or hillary i'm really angry at the sick americans
[38:17.400 --> 38:21.800]  matt drudge i used to listen to your radio show almost every sunday but i got to tell you you
[38:21.800 --> 38:26.680]  are even more on fire than you were then and i know you're smart you know not to be you know
[38:26.680 --> 38:32.440]  you know too available because uh distance makes the heart grow find and i tell you about it would
[38:32.440 --> 38:37.400]  be great if even once a week you did like an hour podcast or something or maybe once a month with
[38:37.400 --> 38:41.880]  these thoughts because let me tell you this is some really good radio and i'm enjoying it and i
[38:41.880 --> 38:46.200]  know the audience is i mean matt drudge is kind of co-host on the alec shone show right now this
[38:46.200 --> 38:54.120]  is crazy well maybe i'll join facebook oh yeah i don't do that no well i can't i i realize that
[38:54.120 --> 38:59.800]  just my my personality is i've got to stay focused i can't be on the side i can't be too distracted
[38:59.800 --> 39:03.960]  you know your advice to me was right you know like a year ago that don't try to do too much i mean
[39:03.960 --> 39:09.400]  you're right i have paul joseph watson i told him watch out for this this you know that it's it's
[39:09.400 --> 39:16.840]  it's a larger topic but at my height of media availability i was doing the website the tv
[39:16.840 --> 39:22.040]  show and the radio show at the same time as you are doing now as you are doing now
[39:22.040 --> 39:29.880]  now uh mine was with the corporations clear channel news corp and then the drudge report but still i
[39:29.880 --> 39:36.520]  felt just myself it i i felt it was just more powerful to go to the web plus not to necessarily
[39:36.520 --> 39:42.600]  be playing in their playground because the power of the individual as you represent sitting there
[39:42.600 --> 39:48.440]  right now is powerful to the heart i said to paul joseph watson when i saw him in london which you
[39:48.440 --> 39:54.440]  just referred to a year ago you're a romantic figure alex in americana it's wrong it's romantic what
[39:54.440 --> 40:01.160]  you do here every day it just is this is romance because you're an american standing up tough
[40:01.160 --> 40:07.400]  facing these headwinds wow are they blowing but you're there and there there's and you're not alone
[40:07.400 --> 40:14.280]  limbaugh savage hannity levin there's a lot of people on the airwaves who are as brave they are brave
[40:14.280 --> 40:21.560]  and they are living it i've met them all i'm friends with them all they are also operating
[40:21.560 --> 40:27.240]  against the grain in an america that needs to go back to that well the systems tried to put some
[40:27.240 --> 40:30.360]  of them in jail i mean i know a lot of those folks don't talk about the stuff that goes on
[40:30.360 --> 40:35.720]  behind the scenes i don't either but you know these people play hardball and and some folks can
[40:35.720 --> 40:39.800]  say who are libertarians well those folks don't sound libertarian up to me it doesn't matter the
[40:39.800 --> 40:45.160]  globalists the democrats the the collectivists hate anybody who's conservative anybody who believes
[40:45.160 --> 40:50.520]  in the individual and the fact is those people promote individualism nationalism and that's why
[40:50.520 --> 40:55.080]  they've got to be eradicated uh what a horrible world if the system is successful matt drudge in
[40:55.080 --> 41:00.680]  your gut in your heart do you think that humanity is going to be successful and make it the next
[41:00.680 --> 41:06.600]  hundred years oh the hundred years well of course unless mother nature decides you know i'm a big
[41:06.600 --> 41:11.800]  fan of letting mother nature decide some of this too you know we can't control a lot of this there
[41:11.800 --> 41:17.160]  is a law to the universe there just is there's just a law to the universe we could have the san
[41:17.160 --> 41:22.600]  andrea's rip tonight you have nothing to do with that we could have had that super hurricane that
[41:22.600 --> 41:28.200]  look what they did to south carolina two or three hundred miles offshore imagine if a category five
[41:28.200 --> 41:33.640]  eyewall went right up the chesapeake bay they could say well mankind did that no mother nature
[41:33.640 --> 41:41.000]  decides so will we survive i'm sure we will what will we be uh not allowed to speak as we are today
[41:41.000 --> 41:47.080]  well we'll have it documented that we were allowed to speak that way once so i i don't know am i
[41:47.080 --> 41:52.520]  optimistic for myself personally yes i'm strong there's not much they can do they could laser beam
[41:52.520 --> 41:57.400]  me they could drone me they can plutonium me they could do whatever they wanted but spiritually i'm
[41:57.400 --> 42:05.640]  set i've already got it so they can't do much i just wish there was more media that was trailblazing
[42:05.640 --> 42:12.040]  and independent and this to me is a as a big danger right now in this setup is you've got these
[42:12.040 --> 42:17.720]  corporations like the new york times and the amazon now with the washington post and time
[42:17.720 --> 42:25.400]  warner and all of them seem to be the same this is what's frightening and there's so much news
[42:25.400 --> 42:30.040]  in the course of the day and the reason i think the drudge report has is interesting every morning
[42:30.680 --> 42:36.920]  is it's not exactly the same as you would see elsewhere and that's because i'm not involved
[42:36.920 --> 42:41.480]  with other people i'm looking at the world through my eyes and that's what you're seeing
[42:41.480 --> 42:47.960]  with bravery and with the ability to do it because uh the ability to do it what you've
[42:47.960 --> 42:54.200]  created here with one listener one day that went to 10 listeners that went to 50 to now your millions
[42:54.200 --> 42:59.640]  was organically grown and that's kind of how earth proceeds and it usually takes time you're
[42:59.640 --> 43:05.400]  absolutely right looking at the open announcements by the pope for world government carbon taxes
[43:05.400 --> 43:11.560]  looking for obama announcing similar things they've gone from denying this planetary systems being
[43:11.560 --> 43:17.880]  set up to now admitting it we've got all these key meetings tpp being agreed on uh just a few days ago
[43:19.640 --> 43:23.800]  how is that affecting the people that were brainwashed and told none of this was happening
[43:23.800 --> 43:29.560]  how are they going to respond now when all of this starts coming to fruition i've been traveling a
[43:29.560 --> 43:35.080]  lot and i'm seeing a lot of desperation everywhere a lot of sad desperation i was just in an airport
[43:35.080 --> 43:40.920]  and even down to this a woman selling southwest airlines credit cards sending like a robot have
[43:40.920 --> 43:47.240]  you signed up yet are you a member of the club it was tragic this is a mature woman with a beautiful
[43:47.240 --> 43:51.720]  face and life and i'm like how did she get there what has happened to this culture that she's now
[43:51.720 --> 43:59.480]  standing as a robot like this they are sucking our ability to make an income that is compatible
[43:59.480 --> 44:04.280]  with what you need to so i'm getting a little frightened as i travel on the other side of it
[44:04.280 --> 44:09.960]  when i go to new york and i see some of the billionaires it's the other side endless you know
[44:09.960 --> 44:15.640]  they're fighting over pieces of artwork it's it's gotten to the point where the have and they have
[44:15.640 --> 44:22.280]  knots here is breaking so and it's the billionaires that are mainly funding the whole leftist redistribution
[44:22.280 --> 44:26.200]  movement because they end up getting the money in corporate welfare and insider deals it's so sick
[44:27.400 --> 44:31.640]  i watched a great film i don't know if you've seen it yet but it's uh the best of enemies
[44:31.640 --> 44:36.040]  about gore vidal and william f. buckley have you seen that yet no you've got to see it and
[44:36.840 --> 44:41.640]  it shows gore vidal arguing saying the oh and by the way why are we not allowed to have a gore
[44:41.640 --> 44:47.080]  vidal william buckley anymore in the media scene do you see who they hire do you see who's hired
[44:47.080 --> 44:52.920]  for the shows how dull they are yes dull dull as this one they want you to tune out of politics
[44:52.920 --> 44:58.440]  in an entertainment yes they make it where are the flamboyant characters this is what america
[44:58.440 --> 45:05.480]  desperately needs right now flamboyant intellectual characters who can cut different ways uh and that's
[45:05.480 --> 45:09.800]  just what i'm missing i'm i'm been fortunate enough to meet some of the greats of this generation
[45:09.800 --> 45:14.600]  and i've got to tell you they are there it's just they are suppressed and hidden and they're not
[45:14.600 --> 45:20.440]  hired the way gore vidal and buckley were back of previous generation they were not afraid of ideas
[45:20.440 --> 45:26.120]  this generation is frightened of ideas or at least it's being suppressed let's throw in in the
[45:26.120 --> 45:29.160]  few minutes we have left we're about to go to break and i know you've given us more time you
[45:29.160 --> 45:33.720]  even said you would matt rouges our gas drudge report dot com obviously in studio here in austin
[45:33.720 --> 45:38.040]  texas visiting a surprise visit one of the best ever that's better than surprise birthday parties
[45:38.040 --> 45:43.000]  i've had shifting years i don't think that it's putin's this great angel of this wonderful perfect
[45:43.000 --> 45:49.480]  person but our foreign policy is so corrupt so deceptive it makes him look good and nobody's
[45:49.480 --> 45:53.400]  going to back al-qaeda i talked about this last thursday and friday and i'll find the article
[45:53.400 --> 45:57.960]  and we'll put it in this video later and put it out as a report but it was it was roiders reporting
[45:57.960 --> 46:05.880]  that the winehouse is angry that um these airstrikes by the russians have hit the moderates al-nasra
[46:05.880 --> 46:11.880]  which is al-qaeda in syria and then it just went on and they're telling him to stop doing it
[46:12.440 --> 46:17.480]  and he didn't hit isis but then put him pointed out no that's the bosses of isis that's just their
[46:17.480 --> 46:23.320]  fighters it's the same group which is true but it's twilight zone i can't even believe i'm reading
[46:23.320 --> 46:28.680]  roiders who has riders with a straight face that will just sit there and write articles about how
[46:28.680 --> 46:33.880]  al-qaeda is moderate and not bad and then we criticize russia for bombing them when they're
[46:33.880 --> 46:40.600]  attacking russian interest it's just so bizarre it seems like that carl rove quote we said we
[46:40.600 --> 46:45.320]  control reality i don't think obama and these guys really control reality and now we've got john
[46:45.320 --> 46:50.440]  mccain saying let's go ahead and ends the big brzezinski and have war with russia let's go
[46:50.440 --> 46:55.400]  ahead and attack the russian aircraft i mean it's crazy town what do you say to that well i'll
[46:55.400 --> 47:00.280]  i'll say this we never even heard of isis until recently and i remember when that name first
[47:00.280 --> 47:06.040]  started coming up do you know it was designed to be confused with darryl isa no i didn't know that's
[47:06.040 --> 47:10.600]  what it was because darryl isa was the enemy at the time of this administration you know there
[47:10.600 --> 47:14.760]  would have been a time obama could have been impeached and i'm thinking of the irs scandal most
[47:14.760 --> 47:19.880]  likely that would have been the one you get the depositions going you get the president under oath
[47:19.880 --> 47:26.200]  you follow the chain obama most likely would have been impeached bainer decided we're not going there
[47:26.200 --> 47:31.000]  we're not going to have those cities burn we're not going to do it we're not going to impeach obama
[47:31.800 --> 47:38.360]  so i felt darryl isa that's his name right because i'm getting all isle isa issa darryl isa
[47:39.480 --> 47:45.960]  i think they were they came up with the name isis to be confused with darryl isa i'm really being
[47:45.960 --> 47:51.800]  honest with you i remember when the first time christian i'm in poor sputtered out this word isis
[47:51.800 --> 47:58.200]  this thing where did she get that one you know these words are creative these events are created
[47:58.200 --> 48:03.160]  now we act like oh isis has been around for 20 30 years says who's been around a year and a half
[48:03.160 --> 48:11.880]  yeah designed to confuse and then the president going it's not even isis it's isle or is or is
[48:12.920 --> 48:18.440]  this is dr seuss this is madness so well i'm not able to follow any of it because when i sit
[48:18.440 --> 48:23.560]  down and look at the news i'm not able to follow the bouncing ball is putin here is obama here
[48:23.560 --> 48:27.880]  where does this one go where i can't follow can you put the pieces together i'm glad you can
[48:27.880 --> 48:33.000]  because i can't wow well we're going to break here in about a minute and a half and then i'm
[48:33.000 --> 48:36.520]  going to come back and play a special report they're going to the fourth hour being hosted by one of
[48:36.520 --> 48:40.760]  our co-host today but matt in the two minutes we've got left it's amazing to have you here
[48:40.760 --> 48:44.680]  what else do you think's front and center in the universe and the last two minutes here what do you
[48:44.680 --> 48:50.920]  want to say to the audience and to the dinosaur media that is going to gleefully try to edit this
[48:50.920 --> 48:56.040]  and chop this up and i guess use it for their funeral pyre well they're welcome to again they've
[48:56.040 --> 49:04.040]  got no control over the situation none no control no control over me sorry zero i wanted to congratulate
[49:04.040 --> 49:07.880]  you you one of the and people don't really talk about this you are one of the first to stream
[49:07.880 --> 49:14.760]  24 hours a day and i think the reason i was drawn into info wars was because of this streaming
[49:15.960 --> 49:22.520]  this is a profound break that you did to allow the audience to hear you at any time to make it
[49:22.520 --> 49:29.080]  available at any time from anywhere looping looping looping until the next broadcast this is a
[49:29.080 --> 49:32.760]  profound thing you did i don't think that's recognized enough in the industry i'm just talking
[49:32.760 --> 49:39.320]  shop top shop talk here for a second that was big because what you're seeing with the am dial now
[49:39.880 --> 49:43.240]  and i'm not besmirching any stations that are carrying this right now but some of these ratings
[49:43.240 --> 49:47.080]  are frightening some of these ratings in these major cities are frightening i'm talking about
[49:47.080 --> 49:54.120]  half the listeners generally overall for every uh talk host some of them are down a half
[49:54.760 --> 50:02.280]  a half in one year something is going on but you broke through with this 24 hour looping always
[50:02.280 --> 50:07.800]  available on my happiest nights i'm sitting here and i'm listening to you from wherever i am in the
[50:07.800 --> 50:14.280]  world looping getting it getting it getting it and the guests this is a profound shift
[50:14.280 --> 50:20.600]  available anytime from anywhere well that was you alex that was like 12 years ago i i said why do
[50:20.600 --> 50:26.040]  we just send the stream out once uh and then wait for a podcast to come up for the even called it
[50:26.040 --> 50:32.920]  podcast which is an mp3 so organically again yet again another organically grown decision that changed
[50:32.920 --> 50:36.840]  the media landscape well sure and i said why not just have i don't want to just have because i was
[50:36.840 --> 50:40.760]  one of the first people were doing this 20 years ago limbaugh was probably the first with a little
[50:40.760 --> 50:45.400]  you know pod cam took a photo every minute or something i said why don't we just put cameras
[50:45.400 --> 50:49.960]  in here so i could show people articles show them photos show them books and even show them video
[50:49.960 --> 50:54.840]  clips and then we'll start streaming it and by the way limbaugh was genius for doing that because
[50:54.840 --> 51:00.680]  he bypassed broadcast he didn't have to hook up with a fox or a cnn to show him in real time he
[51:00.680 --> 51:05.400]  was able to bypass that and i think there was some cams for radio shows before that sure but he did
[51:05.400 --> 51:10.520]  it on the larger scale but what you did by breaking the mold by breaking the mold whatever you said
[51:10.520 --> 51:15.480]  that day like why don't we loop it i can't tell you how that's changed i would i would say the
[51:15.480 --> 51:21.560]  majority of your listeners are have and will discover you through the looping and the broadcast
[51:21.560 --> 51:24.920]  because now we can drive around and listen to you without the streaming even though it seems like
[51:24.920 --> 51:30.680]  the streaming is what what the where things are going i got to say when you broke the egg there
[51:31.320 --> 51:36.600]  when you crack the egg that was a big one that was a stanley cubrick moment of the bone going up
[51:36.600 --> 51:39.800]  what you did with that one so that was well i don't think it's as big as the bones you've been
[51:39.800 --> 51:44.040]  throwing up the turn into the spaceships but i tell you it's amazing to just have the diverse
[51:44.040 --> 51:47.880]  audience that tunes in to hear me babble speak of the devil like people like stanley cubrick's
[51:47.880 --> 51:51.320]  daughter and folks that have popped up too and you're like you check it out and this is really
[51:51.320 --> 51:54.600]  stanley cubrick's daughter that helped make some of his films it just blows your mind by the way
[51:54.600 --> 51:59.160]  if stanley cubrick was alive can you imagine can you imagine where he would have gone he would
[51:59.160 --> 52:03.640]  have done some great work oh we're missing the hollywood push too where's the greatness coming
[52:03.640 --> 52:07.720]  out of hollywood they want it dumbed down i've talked to top enough of the enough of the martian crap
[52:07.720 --> 52:11.480]  tell us something telling us something big and real and profound as cubrick would have on a human
[52:11.480 --> 52:16.360]  level on a human level well i'm not allowed to say what i was told about cubrick but let me say
[52:16.360 --> 52:21.240]  it was obvious from his films he would he was beyond borbethus he was you know spielberg keeps
[52:21.240 --> 52:28.040]  going back to world war two i mean enough already let's let's get focused i look at a pt anderson
[52:28.040 --> 52:32.920]  and i don't know it's kind of gone into a marijuana cloud for me where are the artists who are
[52:32.920 --> 52:37.000]  challenging this generation like cubrick did so that's another topic separately but well we're
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.920]  going to break in one minute we're gonna air john bounds report come back and who's hosting the fourth
[52:40.920 --> 52:46.760]  hour today i'm so thunderstruck that i uh david night's got a bunch coming up and obviously we
[52:46.760 --> 52:51.800]  need to get clips of this epic interview play those and put those out on info wars.com and
[52:51.800 --> 52:57.000]  prisonplanet.com and matt how how fast do you think here's what's crazy five years ago i carried a
[52:57.000 --> 53:00.440]  mainstream media wrote stories against us or i cared if i was on nightline or something you've
[53:00.440 --> 53:05.080]  been in more big stuff than i am now it doesn't even do anything when i'm on those shows that's
[53:05.080 --> 53:09.720]  why i know that they don't mean anything and so we should end with this you are the guy
[53:09.720 --> 53:16.280]  who tweeted uh at least from what i saw at pierce morgan three years ago or two and a half years ago
[53:16.280 --> 53:21.320]  to say have alex jones on debate him matchmaker yeah behind the scenes people don't know this
[53:21.320 --> 53:26.760]  about me i'm a matchmaker behind the scenes that i've had the ability to make some deals happen
[53:26.760 --> 53:30.520]  and do some things behind the scenes now i've never met pierce morgan but i do believe that
[53:30.520 --> 53:33.880]  tweet that day did lead to that you're right well no they told me this office they said what do you
[53:33.880 --> 53:37.560]  think i'm at drudge's idea because they got my cell phone number and called me and seen it had it
[53:37.560 --> 53:42.840]  i said which ended up being the most dramatic moment on cnn in a generation they admit that they
[53:42.840 --> 53:47.560]  have votes and say that that's why they need to hire people away from sixth avenue just to look
[53:47.560 --> 53:52.120]  at the scene i remember one saying to charlie rose where why aren't you have more conservatives on
[53:52.120 --> 53:57.640]  me he says who and i you know there's a whole list of them why are they limiting themselves because
[53:57.640 --> 54:03.800]  you would say it's a you know it's contrived plan to limit but i still think to make provocative
[54:03.800 --> 54:09.400]  programming you've got to have different points of view a la the buckley and uh vedal agor vedal
[54:10.200 --> 54:16.200]  where is that in this culture it's missing i get it from info wars i get it from other places too
[54:16.200 --> 54:21.240]  mainly talk radio talk radio seems to be the driving force of this culture at least in spoken
[54:21.240 --> 54:26.680]  word i'm not getting it from a television that much i'm just not uh where are the intriguing
[54:26.680 --> 54:32.840]  television shows i mean you could say homeland you can say some of these others okay yes but
[54:32.840 --> 54:38.280]  where are the real dynamic things that are pushing where let's expand on that appears morgan had a
[54:38.280 --> 54:43.320]  ratings boost for about 30 40 for two weeks after that then it went down steadily declined
[54:43.320 --> 54:49.960]  and they got rid of him cnn knows that if they put my commentary on or your commentary others
[54:49.960 --> 54:53.880]  tens of millions would tune in to watch it they know that they have to control the narrative
[54:53.880 --> 54:59.080]  because it's an agenda even if itself defeating and destroying them so where do you think that
[54:59.080 --> 55:04.600]  ends up going them attempting to censor us well it all depends if the sick americans get get
[55:04.600 --> 55:10.040]  unsick that's all that's all you just have to do because if you get well if you get well
[55:10.920 --> 55:15.240]  you're not that interested in what anderson cooper is saying about things you're just not i'm sorry
[55:15.240 --> 55:21.880]  i don't need to be insulting if you're sick you find comfort in that i don't what are your final words
[55:22.440 --> 55:27.000]  what do you mean final words these are the last words ever spoken on earth is these these are the

[56:36.920 --> 56:42.840]  whose lives have been changed forever that means there's another community stunned with grief
[56:42.840 --> 56:51.880]  and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish and parents across the country
[56:52.840 --> 56:58.920]  who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children
[57:00.360 --> 57:08.120]  we talked about this after columbine and blacksburg after tucson after newtown after aurora after
[57:08.120 --> 57:15.240]  charleston it cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get

[1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:52.360]  agree with me a hundred percent or michael savage a hundred percent we are being conquered and we're
[1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:56.360]  not being conquered like you know the romans show up and they give you aqueducts and you're still a
[1:00:56.360 --> 1:01:01.080]  kind of a slave but you know it's better than what the slavery you had a year before because you
[1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:04.520]  could argue some of those regimes you know about two thousand years ago three thousand years ago
[1:01:04.520 --> 1:01:10.600]  well two thousand two hundred years ago when the real roman empire started up were worse than the romans
[1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:16.520]  it's not like loving space aliens have showed up that want to give us free energy
[1:01:16.520 --> 1:01:20.680]  it's like aliens have showed up that want to harvest our organs or something and i'm not
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:26.120]  saying the globalist are aliens it's an analogy they don't have our best interested heart they
[1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:33.800]  have disdain for the public they live on these giant beautiful resort community areas on thousands
[1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:41.240]  of acres of peace people like pelosi and others and then they're at war with free market rich people
[1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:44.760]  because i know i've been in these communities i know a lot of rich people i've been invited to
[1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:49.320]  some very interesting places and and they'll be like helicopter pads across the way and they'll say
[1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:54.280]  yeah that guy's the ceo of this you know he hates my guts and and this guy over here over here is
[1:01:54.280 --> 1:01:58.360]  okay but he's leaving the country and and that lady over there i'm kind of working on her but
[1:01:58.360 --> 1:02:02.680]  you know she's just ignorant she got ignorant people that are ultra rich you got really hard
[1:02:02.680 --> 1:02:06.920]  working folks that made their money themselves or took some family money and made it even bigger
[1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:12.200]  they're almost always free market they believe in people they believe in humanity they like
[1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:17.080]  getting down on the trenches they're not disgusted by the masses of people but you get around a
[1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:24.040]  globalist gangster they are the most neurotic weirdos their staff won't look them in the eyes
[1:02:24.040 --> 1:02:34.280]  uh they're totally hateful they're super cold they're always into uh beating people
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:39.800]  sexually uh that's what the elites are into is hurting people that's their sexual fetish
[1:02:41.080 --> 1:02:44.280]  i don't mean like some light spanking or something i mean really brutal stuff
[1:02:44.920 --> 1:02:52.360]  and and they're into being brutalized they like hurting good things pedophilia is rampant
[1:02:52.360 --> 1:02:58.040]  in the elites just just just rampant and you see that in the sociology it comes out but it's
[1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:03.960]  it's much worse than the statistics show it is i i know so many people that also know really rich
[1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:12.680]  people some of the biggest names in america and i'll say at dinner i'll say tell me uh what are
[1:03:12.680 --> 1:03:18.600]  they into sexually and i'll say what are they into religiously and always out of the person's
[1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:28.120]  mouth is satanism the occult i mean these are really unhappy people and that's all they've
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:31.160]  got to the darkness and i don't mean some guy that goes to a rock and roll show and wears a
[1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:37.240]  pentagram t-shirt because he thinks the devil's cool i mean people with helicopters and in 15
[1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:43.080]  jets and 20 mansions and you know had mistresses when they were 15 years old and and now have you
[1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:51.720]  know just sex operatives all over the place i mean these folks are completely jacked and
[1:03:53.480 --> 1:03:56.920]  they know talent when they see it too they know resistance when they see it
[1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:05.960]  and i told people this 18 years ago and i've told people this over time and now folks can see
[1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:15.560]  that it was true there's a lot of us come out in the news but i personally was offered you
[1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:21.160]  know to to join the new world order repeatedly off record and people said well just tell us who
[1:04:21.160 --> 1:04:25.800]  well then if i do that i've lost the confidence i don't even if it's a bad person if they're not
[1:04:25.800 --> 1:04:30.680]  telling me something illegal and it's in confidence i don't ever tell them i don't ever tell i don't
[1:04:30.680 --> 1:04:39.160]  tell my wife about it plus it's dangerous dangerous type stuff but this morning i was on the elliptical
[1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:44.680]  and i really had a big epiphany i was watching some show called bling on vh1 that they had it on i
[1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:49.400]  wasn't watching it and it was just flashing this purse this car this this thing for the masses to
[1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:53.880]  watch it was just the most soul-sucking garbage and it's like who would sell out for that to
[1:04:53.880 --> 1:05:01.560]  hang around with a bunch of those mummies the dc police chief urges citizens to fight back
[1:05:01.560 --> 1:05:07.880]  against peristyle attackers speaking with 60 minutes on sunday washington dc police chief
[1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:13.640]  kathy leneer urged residents to do what's necessary to save lives in the event of a terror attack
[1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:19.320]  or mass shooting whether it means run hide or fight if you're in a position to try to take
[1:05:19.320 --> 1:05:24.440]  the gunman out it's the best option for saving lives before police can get there leneer said
[1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:29.240]  while acknowledging her latest suggestion was counterintuitive to previous tactics the police
[1:05:29.240 --> 1:05:34.440]  have advised leneer claimed that taking action may be essential to prevent another massacre
[1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:40.600]  like the attack in paris which left over 120 people dead we always tell people don't take action
[1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:46.920]  call 911 don't intervene in the robbery leneer said we've never told people take action but

[1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:19.000]  schafer joins us for the next 20 minutes londoncenter.org is one of the consultancies he is engaged in
[1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:23.960]  he of course blew the whistle about some of the stand downs going after bin laden they tried to
[1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:29.000]  persecute him as a whistleblower but he survived that thanks for support he's also a best-selling
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:35.640]  author and has a new book out we'll tell you about as well but before we do that i just got to say
[1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:42.440]  well colonel schafer uh it's it's got to be good for you being one of the first people to expose
[1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:46.520]  what was happening in bin gazi and i know taking a lot of heat to now see more and more of it come
[1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:52.840]  out has that taken some of the heat off you? well i have to know alex i mean i think you and others
[1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:57.320]  supported me on this from day one thank you uh with that said it's been a very impotent
[1:09:57.320 --> 1:10:03.160]  or position even now because you know at the heart of this is really hillary clinton who is the
[1:10:03.160 --> 1:10:09.960]  chosen one for the democrat uh candidacy for president so as much as i think rational people
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:14.040]  uh and by the way i've been getting questions from the left some of my friends on the left
[1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:19.000]  saying hey do you really think this is all true it's like yeah it's all true and uh i think the
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:25.160]  hearings should have if it was a democrat uh congress questioning a republican candidate
[1:10:25.160 --> 1:10:31.080]  who had been a lover for that candidate but instead the very email alex which they have completely
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:36.760]  chose it showed that she keep us flat was lying and even in the end when they asked her about
[1:10:36.760 --> 1:10:42.680]  the arms deal which by the way has been highly documented by the investigation by whistleblowers
[1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:47.320]  everybody knows there was an arms deal at the heart of bin gazi she got away with lying about
[1:10:47.320 --> 1:10:52.360]  that which frankly at this point my understanding is the congress is now looking at perjury charges
[1:10:52.360 --> 1:10:57.400]  because she had she they have evidence that she did know about the arms deal of trying to get these
[1:10:57.400 --> 1:11:02.840]  arms moved around libya moving them into uh turkey which then in turn uh they were being
[1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:07.560]  moved into syria and by the way another guy who i respect immensely was involved in that
[1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:12.040]  it's been a general mike Flynn the director of bia has admitted on the record that yes he was
[1:11:12.040 --> 1:11:16.200]  part of the arms deal he was directed to do this sort of thing so alex that there's just there's
[1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:22.200]  just no uh doubt about what was at the center of bin gazi and yet the mainstream media continues
[1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:28.040]  to ignore it and people like me here continue to you know uh media matters can even now consistently
[1:11:28.040 --> 1:11:33.400]  says that somehow i'm fantasizing about what happened at bin gazi it's truly uh it's really
[1:11:33.400 --> 1:11:37.640]  bizarre well you were one of the first within a week of it happening to come on this show and to
[1:11:37.640 --> 1:11:42.760]  go on fox and other channels and and talk about an arms deal talk about the turkish ambassador
[1:11:42.760 --> 1:11:48.520]  to break down what happened to warn about missiles getting into the hands of al qaeda uh the fact that
[1:11:48.520 --> 1:11:54.360]  isis once it came up a few years ago you said no that is a lohabious group as well al al nuzra's
[1:11:54.360 --> 1:12:00.360]  al qaeda that's all been proven to be accurate now and we see this whole thing metastasizing
[1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:06.440]  you said last year that there should be criminal charges in a newsmax article for hillary and the
[1:12:06.440 --> 1:12:12.680]  clear cover up so i would imagine that in a way you might be under more heat now because it is an
[1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:20.200]  election year why this is interesting because that's yes and no because clearly alex is part
[1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:24.920]  of the issue now becomes talk on the other side that the republicans use us to their advantage so
[1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:28.920]  i think artillery does survive the primaries that the republicans are going to go into this with a
[1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:34.760]  great deal of of ammunition to use against her because this is all again on the record so uh
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:39.080]  yeah i think my democrat friends are pretty upset with me about the fact that you know there are
[1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:44.760]  are democrats who actually recognize what's going on but because they are so loyal to their party
[1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:49.000]  they choose to look the other way and those are the guys i think i've been most opposed with odds
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:55.080]  with but then again you know we've we've talked to uh uh part of what i do my job is to talk to
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:59.400]  presidential candidates i can't say by name who they are but we've talked to them all as best we
[1:12:59.400 --> 1:13:05.320]  can and uh the idea is what we're going to give them fashionable information that is that is based
[1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:11.640]  on what is known and can be proven via hard copy documents so this now at this point like you
[1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:18.120]  point out now like this this is all hard copy well researched fully uh recognized as fact
[1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:23.400]  that there was an arms deal that hellary clinton was involved uh that the the deal went bad uh
[1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:30.440]  that the and she knew the night of the attack or the day after the 12th of september that uh
[1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:37.320]  that you had al-qaeda terrorists involved and frankly i still stand by my belief that they
[1:13:37.320 --> 1:13:41.080]  they were fully willing to allow christ evens to go to his death knowing something is going to
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:45.880]  happen sure well i've interviewed other whistleblowers uh after you've been on talks plumbly others
[1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:50.760]  cia pilots and others and i've talked to other military people i'm just gonna leave it at that
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:56.040]  it's known that there were drones overhead you said that years ago it's come out you've come out
[1:13:56.040 --> 1:14:01.080]  and said you've gotten intel that obama was watching a part of the seven hours as it unfolded
[1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:07.160]  i stick by that comment yes well this is just outrageous then i mean is it an arms deal and
[1:14:07.160 --> 1:14:14.440]  they didn't know what to do or does it go further did somebody in a government outside of al-qaeda
[1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:20.920]  want to get rid of the ambassador so there wouldn't be any fingerprints on this arms transfer
[1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:28.280]  well it's it's very clear at this point that that evens was the key he was the pivotal the pivot
[1:14:28.280 --> 1:14:33.400]  man he do everything he was involved you know it was his interest to do this he they really
[1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:37.800]  thought alex at the time and this is one of the the biggest conceptions i think well we're
[1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:42.200]  going to continue to pay for this for this mistake for years but the muslim brother to
[1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:47.880]  be a trusted ally that they would be a good ally a good proxy to work with us in place of our our
[1:14:47.880 --> 1:14:53.720]  other our allies and that was what their assumption was so i think when they started seeing that the
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:57.720]  brotherhood was not going to be a good partner they were too far in to say we can't we can't
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:02.680]  to stop it i think they got themselves in over their head i think christine was part of that
[1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:09.000]  that completely ill pot badly managed effort to bring the brotherhood into essentially our
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:13.560]  sphere of influence and i think because of that because they all start going bad and look hillary
[1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:18.520]  clinton's not a stupid woman at all i think they recognize that as much as they needed to get
[1:15:18.520 --> 1:15:23.640]  rid of information to get rid of people this was a good way to let things fly and that's why
[1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:29.800]  you didn't see i mean alex think about this this was about a little more than about two months
[1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:35.000]  out before a major presidential election how was it you don't do maximum effort to go recover an
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:39.640]  ambassador who goes missing think about that if it was under any other president that i know of
[1:15:39.640 --> 1:15:43.080]  that would have been the primary thing everybody would have been scrambling to figure out where it
[1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:48.440]  was at well we know they were countermanning the the the the orders of the military to save these
[1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:52.120]  people and so when they get caught i mean we know they did it it's going to bring them all down
[1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:58.920]  and and so as you stipulate that there is documentary evidence again that someone ordered
[1:15:58.920 --> 1:16:03.800]  every command and keep in mind alex there's an automatic process once a terror attack is
[1:16:03.800 --> 1:16:09.240]  undergoing once an embassy is under seat there's an automatic process which kicks in that it's
[1:16:09.240 --> 1:16:14.120]  basically the the worst case scenario people start moving someone called around to every
[1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:18.600]  command and control headquarters and stopped so that means someone had to to literally
[1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:24.120]  intercede directly and stopping all of the military actions occurring and this is this
[1:16:24.120 --> 1:16:28.200]  remains one of those areas where we we know bits and pieces we don't know all the picture but yes
[1:16:28.200 --> 1:16:33.400]  someone did order all the forces which would have been scrambling to get to libya stand down so that
[1:16:33.400 --> 1:16:37.960]  why would you do that so that that's that means let me ask you this big question now that we see
[1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:43.720]  the aftermath years later isis which is just al-qaeda as you do in your organization you go
[1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:48.360]  around educate congress you educate the candidates you're in an info war with the truth when the
[1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:52.520]  white house three years ago was saying oh these are all good rebels they're wonderful you went and
[1:16:52.520 --> 1:16:58.200]  exposed that with other military people that it was almost all radical saudi arabian a hobbyist
[1:16:58.200 --> 1:17:03.400]  so they clearly know that then then what are they thinking what's the end game where is this going
[1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:06.920]  what are they going to do like i asked you years ago when this first happened what are they going to
[1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:11.720]  do when radicals use those stinger missiles and other service air missiles to shoot down
[1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:16.840]  airliners they can't cover it all up what's going to unfold what were they thinking i mean you know
[1:17:16.840 --> 1:17:22.040]  in the old days just 15 years ago used to run missions some of us come out in the news trying
[1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:27.720]  to find old stingers you guys would go through all sorts of hell just to get a few old stingers
[1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:33.240]  now you've got hundreds of of modern ones being given to these crazies what is the establishment
[1:17:33.240 --> 1:17:38.200]  thinking well i at this point in time i think that's part of the issues they got completely out of
[1:17:38.200 --> 1:17:44.680]  control they they know for example uh alec that that these things are kind of scattered all over
[1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:49.080]  and i think this is where the real firm remains because uh the last time a credible terrorist
[1:17:49.080 --> 1:17:53.640]  organization tried this was al-qaeda in 2002 in kenya where they attempted to take down
[1:17:54.440 --> 1:17:58.280]  two Israeli charter aircraft it didn't work for any number of reasons thank goodness but
[1:17:58.280 --> 1:18:04.760]  imagine now we have that that situation where al-qaeda does have and isaac does have literally
[1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:09.400]  crazy these things and i think this is where we don't know what's going on and i think we're blind
[1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:13.960]  what's the end game well i don't know exactly what the leadership was thinking other than they
[1:18:13.960 --> 1:18:19.720]  thought they could cut deals what some of these these really worst of the worst terrorists
[1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:24.280]  to think that they could be our partners similarly to bring some level of different stability
[1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:29.240]  and and frankly you know the whole thing of trying to partner with the pre-syrian army and the al-nusra
[1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:34.360]  front it was all ill-conceived but i think to be honest with you there's an arrogance on the left
[1:18:34.360 --> 1:18:38.440]  now like to permeate their thinking where they think they're the smartest people in the room
[1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:43.720]  this is the analogy is in ron where you had jeffree skilling right down there in texas and in ron
[1:18:43.720 --> 1:18:47.640]  thinking that they were the smartest guys in the room and they could do things that no one else has
[1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:53.480]  ever done i think that that's hot it's been the one of the the problems would be the left
[1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:57.240]  where they will think you know despite the fact they have all these people available then to
[1:18:57.240 --> 1:19:01.400]  will help educate them they think they're smarter than everybody else they go off on these real
[1:19:01.400 --> 1:19:07.160]  really idiotic ill-conceived uh concepts of operations which result in a tragedy and i think
[1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:13.240]  that's what's going on here well i want to recap one of the best moments i've seen in the u.s army
[1:19:13.240 --> 1:19:19.880]  and just the pentagon in general um really showing some moral leadership i mean i wouldn't say
[1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:24.680]  mutiny against the president but but just not following illegal orders as you know and if you
[1:19:24.680 --> 1:19:28.600]  can talk about some of the inside baseball it's not classified i'd like to hear some more but even
[1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:35.400]  came out in the news what two years ago when ran paul and senator cruz and others were saying we're
[1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:40.360]  not going to be al-qaeda's air force the military uh even before that was holding up the signs on
[1:19:40.360 --> 1:19:44.680]  the internet saying we're not going to be in a syrian civil war we're not going to back al-qaeda
[1:19:44.680 --> 1:19:48.600]  we're not going to be part of it and then uh the chairman of the joint chiefs at the time general
[1:19:48.600 --> 1:19:53.560]  demsy on that saturday night went to obama and it even came out later i was told this but it came
[1:19:53.560 --> 1:19:59.000]  out months later and said do not do this you cannot do it it is insane the military is going to go
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:05.320]  along with it that is such a historic moment and that's got to really concern the criminals that
[1:20:05.320 --> 1:20:10.120]  are running this government i'm just going to say it that's like a moment where it's not operation
[1:20:10.120 --> 1:20:15.400]  valkyrie with the military trying to take out hitler in germany it's just the military saying
[1:20:15.400 --> 1:20:19.880]  we're not going to follow that or well everybody recognized alex that the people we were trying
[1:20:19.880 --> 1:20:25.240]  to support were indeed completely affiliated if not wholly owned by al-qaeda so why would you do that
[1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:31.080]  and this is where you know the solution would be worse than the problem uh look look no down here
[1:20:31.080 --> 1:20:37.160]  president start is a bad guy he has killed his own people he is truly a death spot but frankly
[1:20:37.160 --> 1:20:42.920]  we recognize what happened in libya when we allowed for those elements to include al-qaeda
[1:20:42.920 --> 1:20:49.080]  by the way do you remember alex uh akadapi was warning us saying hey these people who are opposing
[1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:54.120]  me are not the simple you know revolutionary thinkers who want democracy these people these
[1:20:54.120 --> 1:20:58.200]  folks are al-qaeda and sure enough we have a combination of al-qaeda and isis now running
[1:20:58.200 --> 1:21:03.480]  libya so this is clearly it's something the military and the people i deal with understood
[1:21:03.480 --> 1:21:07.960]  from day one that you cannot bring in al-qaeda thinking that they're going to be an ally to
[1:21:07.960 --> 1:21:12.520]  get rid of Assad and think somehow they're going to continue to support your position
[1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:17.720]  we tried this in afghanistan that we we helped create something called the akadapi network
[1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:23.560]  as part of the uh akistani intelligence service back in the 80s to go against the russians well
[1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:28.600]  once the russians last akadapi network supported coming after us that they've been one of the
[1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:34.840]  the main killers of of us and afghan forces since we've been there so we cannot believe for a minute
[1:21:34.840 --> 1:21:40.360]  that al-qaeda or affiliates or anyone who believes like al-qaeda can be dealt with in a friendly way
[1:21:40.360 --> 1:21:45.000]  to to achieve a short-term objective and think somehow they're not going to come back after
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:50.200]  after us to attack us after that fact i think dempsley recognize that a number of us recognize
[1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:54.520]  that again we have these political leaders who alex think they're smarter than everybody else
[1:21:54.520 --> 1:22:00.360]  and they continue to to try to do these truly insane dangerous things colonel shaffers our
[1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:06.440]  guest londoncenter.org just segueing briefly uh one of your latest books predicts the breakdown
[1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:11.960]  of the border uh basically a soft civil war uh this was two years ago and you said watch it's
[1:22:11.960 --> 1:22:16.920]  coming you know this is a lot of stuff i couldn't put in a non-fiction book so i put it in a fiction
[1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:20.680]  book i want to talk about that book some want to talk about what's happening in europe but the
[1:22:20.680 --> 1:22:26.680]  controlled left they're not just this stupid they really hate the west they've said that the head of
[1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:32.760]  the un migrant agency uh peter southerland has said we want to get rid of western culture
[1:22:32.760 --> 1:22:38.840]  they're bringing in they admit 80% military age men they're mainly the folks that invaded syria
[1:22:38.840 --> 1:22:43.160]  they're not really syrian rebels i mean i know you know all this they're not really syrian refugees
[1:22:43.160 --> 1:22:49.480]  what is the plan open borders here open borders there what is the left trying to do why are they
[1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:55.080]  so affiliated with radical islamists that would put a hood over their wife's head and and literally
[1:22:55.080 --> 1:23:00.760]  not let women drive cars why is the left supporting these people well i think the left is essentially
[1:23:00.760 --> 1:23:04.440]  the vanguard of the third world i mean i had a friend of mine basically posit that this morning
[1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:10.360]  basically they are the third world uh and they're trying to make cuts the third world so that's why
[1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:15.800]  you see this sort of thing they want to import people who will radicalize who will be established
[1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:20.360]  that the basic western principles which have made us very strong the conditions that we've created
[1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:25.400]  in the west alex for better for worse for the best mankind has ever seen we have the most people ever
[1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:31.160]  who have clean water clean homes a good used to be a good healthcare system which is now being
[1:23:31.160 --> 1:23:35.880]  diminished by obama care and again this third world idea that we have to be essentially treat
[1:23:35.880 --> 1:23:42.680]  everybody the same that's what they want this idea they use fairness as a value to say you know
[1:23:42.680 --> 1:23:46.680]  alex you live too high you shouldn't be living as well as you do you shouldn't have a nice car
[1:23:46.680 --> 1:23:51.800]  you should be living at a level like someone lives in in say real Kenya and their idea of
[1:23:51.800 --> 1:23:56.680]  fairness is we're all the same and anything extraordinary anything that's good or bad
[1:23:56.680 --> 1:24:01.160]  it's all the same so i think that's why you see the left work so hard here to be stabilized
[1:24:01.160 --> 1:24:04.520]  every western nation and that's something we have to be aware of and then you've got these
[1:24:04.520 --> 1:24:10.520]  ultra rich that make their money off of government contracts waging war against new rich who actually
[1:24:10.520 --> 1:24:15.720]  create jobs and wealth teaming up with the third world it is just sickening to watch well well
[1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:20.520]  here's the key you predicted it's just crazy how accurate you've been colonel shaffer i'm not kissing
[1:24:20.520 --> 1:24:26.120]  your butt it's just no brag just fact you predicted right women gazi happened that next is syria
[1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:30.120]  then you said next is europe what are they going to do i think it's not a question of if it win
[1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:37.000]  they try or they succeed to shoot down one or more major passenger liners uh on the outskirts
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:41.720]  maybe eastern europe russia wherever they can get these missiles how can they get the missiles into
[1:24:41.720 --> 1:24:46.760]  western europe can they get them into the us how long till that happens or am i wrong can we stop it
[1:24:46.760 --> 1:24:52.520]  and then what do you see happening in syria well this is kind of a talk to a twofer what you see
[1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:57.080]  right now as you point out aptly is that these these males these so-called refugees are not
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:25:01.480]  actually military age males are going into the vanguard and the first thing you do is a terrorist
[1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:06.040]  organization alex you set up a trusted network to climb this the network once you have the network
[1:25:06.040 --> 1:25:09.560]  in place you can move these things around with the community right now they don't have a trusted
[1:25:09.560 --> 1:25:14.760]  network that can do that you saw the attacks in france where isis was able to and al-qaeda was
[1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:19.800]  able to a few things under the radar they're finding ak-47s full auto from the middle east now in
[1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:25.880]  france exactly so that was it that was the first test okay it worked so now then if you see it
[1:25:25.880 --> 1:25:31.160]  works if you expand it so now you see the expansion of phase one of getting all these people into europe
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:35.800]  and setting up trusted a climate network after the network's in place now like they can move the
[1:25:35.800 --> 1:25:40.440]  missiles around with the security there's no way law enforcement or intelligence can can stop and
[1:25:40.440 --> 1:25:45.000]  search every single vehicle moving around or every single boat coming in and out so again once
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:50.680]  you get once you flood the market so to speak it makes it it's definitely easier to move weapons
[1:25:50.680 --> 1:25:56.840]  such as stickers around you can do with an ak-47 on a low scale basically increased by an order
[1:25:56.840 --> 1:26:02.600]  of magnitude and then you can do it with impurity that's where they're going with all the russians
[1:26:02.600 --> 1:26:09.240]  where do you see the situation in syria going how big of a defeat to obama wasn't that putin came in
[1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:13.720]  do you think the russians are being suckered into a new afghanistan what about the plane being shot
[1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:19.880]  now i i think the russians are seeing i think it was an attack i think it was done by a locker
[1:26:19.880 --> 1:26:25.320]  v type attack where you had a bomb on the aircraft your suicide bomber uh all the pictures is now
[1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:30.920]  it's the case to me that it was a explosion from the inside not an explosion god so bomb inside
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:35.400]  right and so uh so and i think the russians have got their first real casualties in the war and
[1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:39.960]  war and god bless them i'm glad they're going they need to stabilize syria they can't this is our one
[1:26:39.960 --> 1:26:45.080]  joint uh objective should be a stabilizing syria even if you don't like a solid stabilized theory
[1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:50.760]  because otherwise you're going to continue to see al-qaeda and i just kind of using that region as a
[1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:55.720]  base of operation and of course al-qaeda hits russia even more than they had us on average right
[1:26:57.560 --> 1:27:03.880]  what do you expect the russians to do if some of the voices calling for some type of military
[1:27:03.880 --> 1:27:08.520]  containment or a no-fly zone i mean we've all heard the talk from former generals let's start
[1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:14.360]  killing russians that's some really dangerous talk it is though the russians are doing what
[1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:17.320]  i think we should have been doing i think it's why it's such a big blow to president obama
[1:27:17.320 --> 1:27:22.120]  frankly alex and with that said you know our military i've talked to the post senator gun our
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:26.920]  military will continue to judge itself professionally with the russians we're going to do anything to
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:32.040]  antagonize them as much as i think uh that that that can't be said on the other side with that said
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:35.640]  we've got to come to an agreement of what we're focused on regarding joint objectives
[1:27:35.640 --> 1:27:39.000]  unfortunately long term we have to accept alex that they're trying to put together what i would
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:43.800]  call the damaskus pact uh essentially a form of the warsaw pact in the middle east where they're
[1:27:43.800 --> 1:27:48.360]  joining the iranians uh syria and russians together and we have to look at how we can counter
[1:27:48.360 --> 1:27:52.520]  that long term but for now we have joint objectives regarding stabilizing syria
[1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:57.320]  yes trying indeed to stabilize the the region that's what we should for sure let's not romanticize
[1:27:57.320 --> 1:28:02.280]  russia their elites are just as corrupt as some of ours but exactly we can't lose the moral high
[1:28:02.280 --> 1:28:07.000]  ground and back a jihad al-qaeda army to run around murdering hundreds of thousands of christians
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:11.720]  absolutely get the nail on the head and i think that's what we need to understand the russians
[1:28:11.720 --> 1:28:15.720]  and us at least share that one focus area we should focus on that for now and then worry about
[1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:20.200]  the worry about what to do after that after we defeat isis and al-qaeda i really appreciate
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:25.080]  you giving us time london senator dot org spend a minute on uh your books you've written and the
[1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:31.480]  one predicting the border situation well the last line alex you've you've done a great job of allowing
[1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:36.520]  me to talk about it look we we recognize that you live there they're there than i do in fact the
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:40.520]  border is breaking down the people wanted to break down so the last line essentially is a kind of
[1:28:40.520 --> 1:28:43.800]  looking at all the different people who could be involved and essentially that you point out a
[1:28:43.800 --> 1:28:48.520]  soft coup d'etat looking at people who have interests that are really meant to undermine
[1:28:48.520 --> 1:28:53.160]  and soften our ability to defend the nation that's ongoing and it's something we have to all be
[1:28:53.160 --> 1:28:59.720]  concerned about uh my first book operation dark art is about the war in afghanistan and uh how we uh
[1:28:59.720 --> 1:29:04.120]  how we need to go about trying to we can still pull a victory out there and i'm hopeful that we
[1:29:04.120 --> 1:29:09.800]  could do a lot more to stabilize that area as well but it takes parts but does not take uh political
[1:29:09.800 --> 1:29:14.360]  types to wish basically to have to reinforce their own political power and not to not protect the
[1:29:14.360 --> 1:29:18.520]  american people and that's what we should be that's what we should focus on it's scary to have
[1:29:18.520 --> 1:29:21.800]  political leadership that's never been in the military telling the military what to do
[1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:25.960]  do and we'll see in these disasters colonel shaper thank you so much and thank god for
[1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:30.760]  being there you're a real hero not just what you did in the military but what you've done now
[1:29:30.760 --> 1:29:35.000]  to to to get the information to congress and the people it's been so accurate thank you
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:39.160]  so much colonel sure thanks thanks for having you bet that's an amazing person right there he has
[1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:43.160]  risked his life so much domestically for what he's done on been gazi that's one of the main
[1:29:43.160 --> 1:29:49.000]  sources that's getting close to bringing hellary down stay with us we'll be back we're on the march
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:54.360]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:29:58.520 --> 1:30:03.560]  all you pro vaccine people should rejoice at this news anti-vaccine parents to stop receiving
[1:30:03.560 --> 1:30:08.520]  child care benefits under australian no jab no pay law the new changes that will take effect on
[1:30:08.520 --> 1:30:14.600]  january 1st 2016 are projected to save the australian government over 500 million dollars over four
[1:30:14.600 --> 1:30:19.000]  years and how many children are not receiving their vaccines according to the australian
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:25.480]  childhood immunization register it's 1.77 percent i thought all you needed was 90 percent to have
[1:30:25.480 --> 1:30:29.800]  heard immunity the government believes that by removing the non-medical exemption it will
[1:30:29.800 --> 1:30:34.040]  reinforce the importance of immunization and protecting public health but what this is really
[1:30:34.040 --> 1:30:38.040]  about is the government wants to put anything in your body that they want and they want to make
[1:30:38.040 --> 1:30:43.000]  sure you bend over and take it a footnote in the article is that by 2020 childless couples will
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:47.480]  overtake those with children now i know where the next muslim migrant invasion is going to take

[1:33:17.560 --> 1:33:21.400]  that's right you know i respect michael savage and when i would listen to him
[1:33:21.400 --> 1:33:28.520]  him 10 12 years ago i agree with about 95 percent but what he would say there's a socialist plan
[1:33:28.520 --> 1:33:33.400]  to flood the west with radical islamics to create caliphates and takeover he was the first person
[1:33:33.400 --> 1:33:39.960]  i ever heard say that i thought well i believe him he sounds sincere and i could tell he's a man
[1:33:39.960 --> 1:33:45.720]  who believes in what he's doing and he's a smart guy with all these letters to his name but man
[1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:50.680]  that's really crazy would the elite really do that and now here's the headline migrant crisis
[1:33:50.680 --> 1:33:57.960]  pushing germany towards anarchy and civil war in one town alone the daily mail reports 750
[1:33:57.960 --> 1:34:03.320]  military age men basically in a town of 102 they're demanding the germans pay for it all
[1:34:04.040 --> 1:34:08.440]  same things happening here with the open borders who talked about language borders culture
[1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:16.120]  michael savage so call him a prophet a historian a man before his time he is a renaissance man of
[1:34:16.120 --> 1:34:21.960]  course best-selling author launch much of the modern herbal supplement movement we know of in
[1:34:21.960 --> 1:34:26.600]  the 60s and 70s if there's one guy you could say michael savage under another known diploma
[1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:31.560]  and now he's with us for just 30 minutes i'm gonna shut up and go to him but i gotta tell you
[1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:37.000]  he's banned from entering england i've been threatened that i'll be banned from entering
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:41.720]  europe or england now if i criticize radical islam they are arresting germans in mass and
[1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:46.200]  taking their kids from them if they criticize radical islam the women are being told don't
[1:34:46.200 --> 1:34:52.040]  wear short skirts they're canceling christian holidays in public squares because the radical
[1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:57.800]  islamics are offended this is the suicide of the west you talk about total mental illness
[1:34:58.440 --> 1:35:01.400]  because i mean these radical islamics are going to go after the liberals first thing when they
[1:35:01.400 --> 1:35:07.080]  get control it is suicidal it's a form of cuckolding in my view he's got his new book out the last one
[1:35:07.080 --> 1:35:11.960]  was censored on china getting ready to make big moves you notice that all happened china is now
[1:35:11.960 --> 1:35:17.080]  involved with clandestine radio they secretly own in the u.s trying to censor media they block
[1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:23.480]  hollywood movies being released his new book government zero no borders no language no culture
[1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:28.600]  and folks you may all get it but your friends and family don't this is a book you better give
[1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:34.520]  them this christmas or this holiday season and i'm here pushing it because savage needs support
[1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:39.160]  with his information he doesn't need money he needs to get the book out and you need to get the
[1:35:39.160 --> 1:35:43.960]  book out and you do support people that are telling the truth now i'm done ranting i want to come
[1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:47.960]  back in the next month for a full hour he's doing a book tour right now so we just got 25
[1:35:47.960 --> 1:35:53.480]  minutes with us but to say it's dire when the daily beast says we need to confiscate guns that's a
[1:35:53.480 --> 1:35:59.480]  quote but the black helicopter people may fight back so we're still crazy even though we were
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:02.680]  right they're coming for the guns and we were right they're going to get rid of the borders
[1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:06.520]  and we were right they're coming with forced inoculation and we were right about world government
[1:36:06.520 --> 1:36:11.480]  with the pope calling for it michael savage i'm gonna try to shut up but i tell you this is an
[1:36:11.480 --> 1:36:18.440]  epic moment you've laid so much knowledge on us where are we now where are we going word is
[1:36:18.440 --> 1:36:23.480]  you're being censored as well they're trying to block your new book i mean it is on they're saying
[1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:28.440]  they want to persecute the press uh supreme court justice told matt drudge uh that they're coming
[1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:33.720]  next year to shut down basically talk radio and free speech on the internet i mean it's here what
[1:36:33.720 --> 1:36:39.400]  do we do michael savage okay without hammering the book i want to start with the title because it
[1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:45.400]  says it all government zero if we don't see president zero invoking government zero i'd like
[1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:51.560]  to know what it's going to take for the average moron out there idiot moron fools who have sold
[1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:56.200]  the country away running around in shorts with halloween costumes with their children on drugs
[1:36:56.200 --> 1:37:03.320]  and sugar and they wonder why these s o b's with that monster tyrant leftist bastard in the white
[1:37:03.320 --> 1:37:12.360]  house this guy is the smartest leftist in the history of the world this slick bs artist barry
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:18.360]  from honolulu has done more harm to the world than marx and letin put together and he gets away
[1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:24.280]  with it for one reason alex he doesn't shout like me have you ever heard barry from honolulu
[1:37:24.280 --> 1:37:32.280]  scream no never he is the smoothest con man in the history of the world he makes soros look like a
[1:37:32.280 --> 1:37:38.600]  chump soros by the way is behind breaking all the borders of europe you know that with his open
[1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:43.880]  society you know soros is who flooded america with marijuana you know that now many people
[1:37:43.880 --> 1:37:49.720]  like marijuana i think it's one of the most toxic substances in the world it is the road to addiction
[1:37:49.720 --> 1:37:57.640]  it is a gateway drug who has made it suddenly so friendly 10 years ago i fought with one of soros's
[1:37:57.640 --> 1:38:03.880]  minions on my radio show soros was the first to fund medical marijuana initiatives in arizona
[1:38:03.880 --> 1:38:09.720]  in california and i was arguing are you people crazy it's a gateway drug you're gonna hook a
[1:38:09.720 --> 1:38:15.480]  generation on drugs we had this argument it's history now marijuana is as friendly as candy corn
[1:38:15.480 --> 1:38:21.400]  everyone thinks it's a benign herb it is not so what does it have to do with soros's master plan
[1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:26.440]  the man is possibly the most evil genius on the planet in my estimation why does he want to break
[1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:32.680]  the borders of every nation on earth what is it that they're after what do you mean no borders well
[1:38:32.680 --> 1:38:41.560]  listen no borders no language no culture a mass of stupid drug humanity easily manipulated turned
[1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:47.320]  into slaves serfs in their own country what more do you need to know children on drugs parents on
[1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:53.800]  alcohol marijuana and drugs and then you have the puppet masters as in the godfather the peasant
[1:38:53.800 --> 1:38:58.600]  avante's pulling the strings sucking the money out of the people's pockets as they go to work
[1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:03.400]  like slaves in their little slave factories thinking they're free remember orwell's book
[1:39:04.200 --> 1:39:08.520]  remember that great phrase those who rattle their chains most loudly scream loudly scream i'm free
[1:39:08.520 --> 1:39:13.480]  i'm free i'm free yes that's what all well wrote as he saw what communism had wrought in group
[1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:18.600]  socialism he was originally a socialist and then he saw who they really were he saw they were monsters
[1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:23.880]  and dictators he got into their upper sanctum he was led into the thamian socialist Stalin
[1:39:25.240 --> 1:39:30.200]  hitler all socialist everyone forgets that very convenient to forget hitler was a socialist
[1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:37.720]  Stalin hitler socialist different sides of the coin now we have socialism is suddenly popular in
[1:39:37.720 --> 1:39:42.280]  america how's that possible because the drug morons don't even know what it is they don't
[1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:46.440]  know what it has wrought they don't know where it leads they have no idea what it'll do to them
[1:39:46.440 --> 1:39:51.480]  now couple that with bringing in as many aslamic fascists as you possibly can as quickly as you
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:40:00.200]  can why why are they bringing in so many young men of military age into europe into america
[1:40:00.760 --> 1:40:05.720]  what's their game plan here and now throw in what you're talking about confiscation of guns
[1:40:05.720 --> 1:40:11.160]  it ain't happening alex it would not austria austria had no second amendment that's number one
[1:40:11.160 --> 1:40:15.560]  and i will remind you in your audience and this is the most important thing alan alex i'm sorry
[1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:22.520]  for the day i have a tape that i keep playing on my radio show from elena kagan when she was
[1:40:22.520 --> 1:40:27.160]  appointed the supreme court when she went through the fake hearing the kangaroo fake hearing of
[1:40:27.160 --> 1:40:31.560]  whether she should be appointed or not she was asked about the second amendment remember her
[1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:36.680]  she's this kind of pickle saleswoman from the lower east side of new york like a penguin yeah
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:41.320]  pickle saleswoman in my day the most she would have done is sold bloomers at macy's now she's on
[1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:45.560]  a supreme court this is right out of the communist trying to playbook take people from the bottom
[1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:50.200]  and put them on the top take people on the top and throw them to the bottom so elena kagan when
[1:40:50.200 --> 1:40:55.880]  she was grilled fake grilled she says where do you stand on guns and she says the second amendment
[1:40:55.880 --> 1:41:03.480]  is established lua the second amendment is established lua well if it's established lua
[1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:08.120]  how could barry from honolulu take your guns how could the witch from arkansas or chapter
[1:41:08.120 --> 1:41:12.120]  i agree with you but they're openly licking their chops is what i'm saying i agree it'll
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:15.640]  start a civil war i agree they're not going to get away with it but they're openly now
[1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:21.400]  hillary obama others saying we do need to look at confiscation that's a bold move why are they
[1:41:21.400 --> 1:41:26.920]  shooting their mouths off there was a time not too long ago when the democrats would never even
[1:41:26.920 --> 1:41:34.600]  touch god guns and gays remember that that time not so long ago but barry from honolulu is such
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:40.840]  a slick con artist that he's so hoodwinked the american drug addict that they actually think
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:46.120]  it's time for socialism gun seizure no borders and flood america with your muslim brethren
[1:41:46.120 --> 1:41:52.120]  the people are stupid and they're drugged alec and they sense they could get away with it but you
[1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:56.920]  know what they're reading that he leaves wrong there'll be a revolution and they're gonna lose
[1:41:56.920 --> 1:42:01.800]  alex there are too many guns and too many people ready to fight them i'm not i'm not calling for
[1:42:01.800 --> 1:42:09.560]  revolution they are let's be very clear i am a man of peace i am a man of peace but we have
[1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:15.640]  gangsters running this country criminals gangsters what the hell is this highway bill all about
[1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:21.240]  the first day i'm sorry for yelling no no we're normal we see total criminal takeover the death
[1:42:21.240 --> 1:42:26.840]  of freedom the death of the west and and these crazy socialists that so hate freedom that they
[1:42:26.840 --> 1:42:33.160]  want to bring in the most radical sunni wahhabist to run around and rape people and the swiss and
[1:42:33.160 --> 1:42:38.200]  dutch and all the rest of these police just let them go under orders uh i mean it's just crazy
[1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:42.280]  that we've gotten to this point and it's normal to get angry we need to get people out of their
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:48.040]  coma how do we do that i gotta go back to paul ryan he gives a speech today that i hear on a abc
[1:42:48.040 --> 1:42:52.920]  news about the highway bill listen to this the first day he gives a speech what's it about
[1:42:52.920 --> 1:42:57.640]  the highway bill who was it it was pushing the highway bill for years now nancy polosi
[1:42:59.080 --> 1:43:03.400]  put two and two together why isn't the highway bill that's on the top of their list because
[1:43:03.400 --> 1:43:10.360]  polosi supported him why does polosi push it because they can all roads lead to roam you
[1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:15.720]  ever hear that one going back absolutely all roads lead to roam that's as far as i can go
[1:43:15.720 --> 1:43:21.240]  without winding up with lead shoes in the bottom of san francisco bay and i'll let it hang in the air
[1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:26.920]  it is the most corrupt degenerate criminal government in american history and i'm not
[1:43:26.920 --> 1:43:31.880]  saying this for effect nor to sell a book i'm trying to awaken people unfortunately alec your
[1:43:31.880 --> 1:43:36.440]  audience is already awakened they're agitated they're ready to strike they don't know what to do
[1:43:36.440 --> 1:43:40.920]  but look at the morons around you go walk in the street there's a lot of work in san francisco
[1:43:40.920 --> 1:43:45.560]  yesterday the most beautiful city i love it to death and walking through a park near the
[1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:52.440]  embarked arrow and without being graphic i'm an old boy scout so i read footprints in the
[1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:56.600]  woods and i can read droppings in the woods i was taught how to follow droppings of what
[1:43:56.600 --> 1:44:01.400]  kind of animal it is well there was a dropping on the ground on the sidewalk that i said there
[1:44:01.400 --> 1:44:07.000]  are no bears in the city how could this can't be a bear well it's an admitted record problem
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:12.360]  in san francisco public defecation and now in government buildings even when they have bathrooms
[1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:18.040]  they're so mentally ill that they just enjoy crapping in public what does that say about a
[1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:22.600]  civilization alex that people are allowed to crap without being they're having their heads
[1:44:22.600 --> 1:44:27.960]  broken open by a cop in my day if a guy did that a big irish cop would smash him on the head with
[1:44:27.960 --> 1:44:32.840]  a night stick and drag him into the into the into the prison and hose him down and throw him
[1:44:32.840 --> 1:44:37.800]  into a jail and leave him there well what kind of country is this that permits this to go on
[1:44:38.680 --> 1:44:43.080]  now you ask yourself if society is breaking down and at the same time they're trying to
[1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:48.920]  break us down what is it all about so the public defecation could be stopped in one second right
[1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:54.840]  so what is this about it's the constantly lower the standards of the middle class
[1:44:54.840 --> 1:45:01.320]  yes constantly dehumanize the middle class that's it right dehumanize desensitize
[1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:07.640]  weaken weaken weaken weaken weaken until eventually they have no resistance to whatever the evil
[1:45:07.640 --> 1:45:12.680]  criminal gangsters in their in the regime might do next it's as simple as that alex
[1:45:13.720 --> 1:45:20.040]  and at one at the want and at the uh the wish to not offend people who think i'm peddling a
[1:45:20.040 --> 1:45:25.000]  book i have to mention my great new book let's talk about the book absolutely no you serve i have

[1:45:43.800 --> 1:45:50.680]  first of all the good news is despite the censoring despite no appearance on fox news ever
[1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:55.880]  ever zero fox news conservative outlet are you kidding me
[1:45:57.080 --> 1:46:04.360]  zero michael savage officially banned abc cbs nbc banned cnbc banned so i go on your show

[1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:29.720]  they manipulate that one oh tremendously if you wanted what people are reporting that they're going
[1:46:29.720 --> 1:46:36.920]  in stores and they're finding stacks of the books with the covers bent wow so you got sabotage
[1:46:36.920 --> 1:46:41.160]  then they're finding the book in the back not on the front table which the publisher paid for
[1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:45.880]  but in the back on the feminine hygiene that's a joke but that's where they're putting it anywhere
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:51.400]  but where you can find it now which books are selling well why oh riley's books the killing
[1:46:51.400 --> 1:46:56.200]  series what why what people buying that garbage for what's the revelation about killing patin or
[1:46:56.200 --> 1:47:00.280]  killing reagan can you tell me why anybody would read a book like that well what are they finding
[1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:03.640]  in the book that they don't already know it's mindless it's non-threatening they want to think
[1:47:03.640 --> 1:47:07.560]  they're pseudo-intellectuals they want to sit back and read something that's utterly mindless
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:12.600]  well i i said this facetiously and i certainly don't mean it but i said i'm waiting for the
[1:47:12.600 --> 1:47:17.880]  next book in the series by him called killing a riley maybe you do us all a favor and end it
[1:47:17.880 --> 1:47:21.720]  already he's got some franchise going there doesn't he but nevertheless let's get let's get back to
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:26.600]  serious stuff no borders no language no culture what does that matter left this is hey savage
[1:47:26.600 --> 1:47:31.880]  what the heck you're so excited about what do you need a border for and what are you holding on to
[1:47:31.880 --> 1:47:39.240]  english for your parents were immigrants weren't they michael yes and and so what's your point larry
[1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:43.720]  i was a larry king last week he has a little show on russian television how is that for funny
[1:47:43.720 --> 1:47:48.520]  come up come about of events but i actually like larry king you know why alex he's a liberal
[1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:54.440]  old school nice liberal smart but not vicious totally different than the new generation
[1:47:54.440 --> 1:48:00.600]  of progressive psychos right so he says to me your parents were immigrants so what are you afraid
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:05.320]  of someone not speaking english i said i don't care what language they speak at home my grandmother
[1:48:05.320 --> 1:48:11.240]  never spoke a word of english but my father drilled into me you're in america learn english learn
[1:48:11.240 --> 1:48:16.200]  the best way you can become an american you're not living anywhere else be an american and that's not
[1:48:16.200 --> 1:48:21.800]  the ethos of this generation is it do you hear them teaching their children learn english the
[1:48:21.800 --> 1:48:26.200]  teaching them learn anything but english stamp on the country that's so good to you don't learn their
[1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:31.400]  language there is no culture there how long has the left taught us that america has no culture it's
[1:48:31.400 --> 1:48:36.600]  an aculturated nation or nation with no culture they want to get rid of our culture so they can
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:41.480]  then download into us their sick mentally ill culture and you were one of the first to say this
[1:48:41.480 --> 1:48:46.440]  but more and more it's clear the top liberals are vicious mafia social engineers as you've
[1:48:46.440 --> 1:48:51.960]  documented but their minions really are mentally ill basket cases i'm sure you saw the atlantic
[1:48:51.960 --> 1:48:57.560]  monthly article a few weeks ago about the coddle generation admitting that these are left as saying
[1:48:57.560 --> 1:49:03.400]  that their college students have now become like these weird malice youth brigades that shout them
[1:49:03.400 --> 1:49:10.920]  down for just any language they are complete but the fascist basket cases that just flip out
[1:49:10.920 --> 1:49:16.440]  and now want to ban the word mother and father you're a father alex you know that children
[1:49:16.440 --> 1:49:19.960]  need discipline you know what happens when you raise them without discipline they become
[1:49:19.960 --> 1:49:26.200]  of animals i was in a chinese restaurant last night in san francisco i love a dumpy restaurant
[1:49:26.200 --> 1:49:30.680]  that i go to there was a kid two of them running around screaming at the top of the lungs i mean
[1:49:30.680 --> 1:49:35.560]  screeching where the the food you couldn't even digest it now i wasn't going to say anything
[1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:40.840]  because you know what are you going to do i looked at the father he was a nice looking guy not a
[1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:47.800]  weakling but indulgent afraid to say no to johnny the type that when johnny defecates in his hand
[1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:53.640]  and wipes it on the wall he will say johnny isn't honest that's a shagali just painted don't wipe it
[1:49:53.640 --> 1:49:59.720]  off the wall these people these people are crazy they are no they have no discipline themselves
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:07.000]  remember if the father's 30 32 33 right he may look good he may be what's amazing to me is that
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:12.600]  these guys are well built they all go to the gym right alex they all got abs but they have no no
[1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:17.720]  cerebral they don't have the minds of men well they have abs they have good abs but no no no
[1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:23.640]  cerebrum fault no folds in the brain that folds in the stomach he's like zomboids walking around
[1:50:23.640 --> 1:50:28.200]  wild crazy children this child's made to be only one thing which is a tort lawyer that's all they
[1:50:28.200 --> 1:50:32.840]  grew up to be and if he fails at that it can become a government worker but aside from the
[1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:39.800]  facetiousness okay discipline gone society going breaking down at the top gangster regime sucking
[1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:45.800]  us dry paul ryan first speech first speech first speech highway bill highway bill highway bill
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:51.240]  who's in the highway building business who makes the trillions off the highway bill are you in the
[1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:56.040]  highway business you don't know but auntie polosi went into congress worth about a half a million
[1:50:56.040 --> 1:50:59.960]  now she's worth hundreds of millions and her husband suddenly became worth billions she's
[1:50:59.960 --> 1:51:05.160]  a nice lady of course i'm sure she's friends with don curlier and i she's a sweet grandmother and you
[1:51:05.160 --> 1:51:12.040]  know what's also nice about polosi is the fact that her brother-in-law got about a 1.2 billion
[1:51:12.040 --> 1:51:17.960]  dollar loan from the government for a solar plant in the nevada desert and he did so well in producing
[1:51:17.960 --> 1:51:21.960]  about a megawatt of energy for it that they gave him another 800 million according to what i've
[1:51:21.960 --> 1:51:27.000]  recently read how come it's not in any of the newspapers have you ever seen corruption like
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:32.040]  this couldn't even go on yeah what's wrong with harry reid giving billions in contracts to his
[1:51:32.040 --> 1:51:36.440]  sons he's got like four or five of them what's that that's nothing that shouldn't even be in the news
[1:51:36.440 --> 1:51:40.840]  i mean how dare you do your research it's totally normal republican party there is none it's a one
[1:51:40.840 --> 1:51:47.000]  party system oligarchy all the conservators that were put in last year were put at the back of the
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  bus remember how much hope we had in november when i wrote stop the coming civil war i said hold
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:55.960]  your nose go vote for republicans and we'll put their feet to the fire after they win guess what
[1:51:55.960 --> 1:52:02.680]  baner has no feet mcconnell has no feet there's no feet to put on the fire they're empty shells
[1:52:02.680 --> 1:52:09.240]  they were never men they were never there they were factotums of barry from hana lulu one party
[1:52:09.240 --> 1:52:15.160]  period it is a fascist dictatorship he wants to crush us under his fist he is the worst monster
[1:52:15.160 --> 1:52:19.960]  in the history of america and if he uses an executive order to go around congress on immigration
[1:52:19.960 --> 1:52:24.520]  we need 10 million people demanding immediately demanding that an impeachment hearing be started
[1:52:24.520 --> 1:52:28.760]  whether or not those cowardly useless gangster republicans do it or not we need a people's
[1:52:28.760 --> 1:52:33.480]  tribunal now let's be positive for a moment you know i agree we need a people's tribunal
[1:52:33.480 --> 1:52:38.680]  and find these people guilty of war crimes i agree but but your audience my audience drudge
[1:52:38.680 --> 1:52:45.320]  and world net daily a lot of other great people uh did get organized we did get 40 or so libertarian
[1:52:45.320 --> 1:52:52.120]  constitutionalist they did get rid of ryan of uh of boner then of course they brought in ryan
[1:52:52.120 --> 1:52:56.200]  but the point is we get a whole another group in they won't be able to suppress
[1:52:56.200 --> 1:53:02.200]  80 to 100 so we are marching forward we are getting closer uh but i expect they're going

[1:55:28.040 --> 1:55:33.400]  not such a bold idea who would be who's in favor of keeping them in our prisons at 60 000 a year

[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:41.080]  dirty tricks what are you watching out for well number one he's already done it with the justice
[1:56:41.080 --> 1:56:46.200]  department the illegal corrupt anti-american justice department he's put people in positions
[1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:51.400]  that are lifetime positions what this Barry from Honolulu doesn't know is that if we had a strong
[1:56:51.400 --> 1:56:56.440]  leader take over and i pray to god trump wins i know you may i don't know what you think of him
[1:56:56.440 --> 1:56:59.640]  he's our only hope right now i think it's a lot better than hillary and i agree with what he has
[1:56:59.640 --> 1:57:03.400]  to say and i hope it's for real i'm supporting uses executive orders and he gets rid of all
[1:57:03.400 --> 1:57:08.520]  of these appointees throws him out and says go sue me i'm the government go to hell get out

[1:58:01.160 --> 1:58:07.320]  good analysis i didn't think of it thank you for your insight i meant government zero means
[1:58:08.440 --> 1:58:12.120]  not a government of the people by the people and for the people but a government of itself
[1:58:12.120 --> 1:58:18.200]  by itself and for itself we have zero government we have a lawless criminal group exactly zero
[1:58:18.200 --> 1:58:24.040]  representation a government is supposed to be representative not a group a cadre of a zero

[2:08:45.080 --> 2:08:50.120]  in closing down the Miami-Dade presidential recount stone is credited an HBO recent movie
[2:08:50.120 --> 2:08:55.800]  recount 2000 with a fomenting the so-called brooks brothers riot in which republican mobs swarmed
[2:08:55.800 --> 2:09:00.440]  the recount demanding shutdown while thousands of cuban americans marched outside the courthouse
[2:09:00.440 --> 2:09:05.880]  he also has worked around the world with pro-democracy pro-american governments during elections
[2:09:05.880 --> 2:09:13.480]  rogerstone.com and i've met him and folks up in dallas at some of the big JFK memorial events
[2:09:13.480 --> 2:09:19.480]  like the 40th anniversary a few years ago but the reason we got him in studio is i learned he was
[2:09:19.480 --> 2:09:24.520]  going to be down in austin uh this week and we already had an article back on november 3rd
[2:09:25.160 --> 2:09:31.480]  titled political strategist hillary clinton is an abuser of women and girls now i personally
[2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:38.440]  have interviewed women that bill clinton raped and i mean women that bill clinton uh brutally
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:44.520]  brutally raped and then settled out of court with but the word is hillary also has some of
[2:09:44.520 --> 2:09:49.560]  her own activities but it's kind of like black unemployment doubling under obama they then put
[2:09:49.560 --> 2:09:54.440]  out all this pro-black rhetoric but it's really the opposite uh so we're going to be speaking to
[2:09:55.480 --> 2:10:02.280]  some of that today and and really going over who is hillary clinton because even if you're a democrat
[2:10:02.280 --> 2:10:08.600]  that that identifies with her and thinks she's some wonderful great saint with the amount of dirt
[2:10:08.600 --> 2:10:15.720]  uh that is in her background with the amount of dirt that's going on it makes her extremely
[2:10:15.720 --> 2:10:20.280]  black mailable and so that's my biggest concern with hillary not just her saying we should look
[2:10:20.280 --> 2:10:27.000]  at australian style uh gun confiscation uh and things like that uh and so again uh we also have
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:34.760]  the video of him with larry king live uh breaking that down on rt of all places so thank you so much
[2:10:34.760 --> 2:10:40.680]  uh for coming uh in to join us today to break all this down roger stone's our guest roger stone
[2:10:40.680 --> 2:10:44.200]  dot com good to see you again buddy oh it's great to see you thanks for having me you know i'm known
[2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:48.360]  for talking a lot and i know a lot about hillary and bill but you've written a book about it and i
[2:10:48.360 --> 2:10:52.040]  read some stuff in your book that i didn't even know uh but then i went and looked up turned out
[2:10:52.040 --> 2:10:56.680]  was true uh i mean there's a lot of folks that have it out for women and like to target them
[2:10:56.680 --> 2:11:02.200]  most predators do for some reason um whereas most of us that aren't predators want to defend women
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:07.000]  and children what's the clinton's relationship with women yeah the point here of course is that the
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:13.160]  whole central narrative of her campaign is bogus she is not an advocate for women and girls uh
[2:11:13.160 --> 2:11:18.200]  she's an abuser of women and girls bill is not your rogish old uncle who just has an eye for the
[2:11:18.200 --> 2:11:24.760]  ladies as you know he's a serial sexual predator very much like bill cosby uh and the number of
[2:11:24.760 --> 2:11:31.800]  women that he has raped bitten sexually assaulted abused you know i identified in this book 27
[2:11:31.800 --> 2:11:38.200]  individual women now some of these women's names you know why need a broad rick uh paula jones
[2:11:38.200 --> 2:11:43.800]  kathy willie but so many of the names you don't know christie zurcher becky brown carol and moffitt
[2:11:43.800 --> 2:11:52.600]  helen dowdy eileen wellstone uh uh uh uh liz ward grason list goes on and on and on now some liberals
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:56.840]  try to say to me well what does that have to do with hillary well hillary is the one who runs the
[2:11:56.840 --> 2:12:02.200]  cover-up hillary is the point person to silence these women lest they get in the way of the
[2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:07.400]  clinton's lust for power and wealth uh hillary is the one who hires the heavy-handed private
[2:12:07.400 --> 2:12:15.000]  detectives uh jack paladino anthony palakano ivan duta who go out and run a veritable terror
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:20.760]  campaign to silence these women so the notion that hillary has somehow been an advocate for women
[2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:26.920]  no bill rapes them physically and then hillary rapes them psychologically she's kind of a beard
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:32.120]  for his raping she she plays the part of all never you know leave my man i stand by my man
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:38.440]  he's a good guy she testifies for him she defends him uh she's an enabler yeah but it's worse than
[2:12:38.440 --> 2:12:43.640]  that because it's not just that he can get away with it it's that she ensures that there's no public
[2:12:43.640 --> 2:12:49.240]  exposure this is why the famous feminist camille paglia says hillary's a fraud her husband has
[2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:55.400]  degraded and exploited women or joe and venoche the feminist writer for the boston globe the
[2:12:55.400 --> 2:13:02.200]  liberal newspaper says that bill clinton should be held to the same standard as bill cosby from
[2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:06.920]  your research deep research that i've been on this for years who's more of the abuser of women
[2:13:06.920 --> 2:13:12.280]  cosby or clinton i think clinton because cosby you see drugs them whereas clinton just uses brute
[2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:17.800]  force alex i i interviewed three women that he bit he bites through the upper lip it's kind of his
[2:13:17.800 --> 2:13:22.440]  signature first of all it's a disabling move because of course a woman then stops trying to
[2:13:22.440 --> 2:13:27.640]  cover what a pit bull does right he tries to cover her mouth and then secondarily it's a not so
[2:13:27.640 --> 2:13:34.840]  subtle message to keep your mouth shut so uh this guy is a criminal uh he is uh he's a sex addict
[2:13:34.840 --> 2:13:41.400]  he's a pedophile the book goes way beyond this we tie his epic drug use the fact that he himself
[2:13:41.960 --> 2:13:47.320]  was a habitual user of cocaine that he was in and out of drug rehab when he was governor
[2:13:47.320 --> 2:13:52.920]  that he was involved as you know and in the whole question of drug trafficking in and out of arkansas
[2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:57.320]  in connection with the bushes in connection with the central intelligence agency
[2:13:58.040 --> 2:14:03.720]  and when dan lassiter the biggest drug dealer in arkansas when he was ultimately convicted
[2:14:03.720 --> 2:14:09.560]  of drug trafficking he went out and got himself this really smart woman lawyer her name was hillary
[2:14:09.560 --> 2:14:16.040]  clinton and she and her law partner vince foster why they arranged for lassiter to get a full pardon
[2:14:16.040 --> 2:14:21.960]  from governor bill clinton wow and then now today at a bigger scale she heads up the state department
[2:14:21.960 --> 2:14:27.160]  and gets billions of dollars uh you know brought into their foundation hundreds of millions from
[2:14:27.160 --> 2:14:32.280]  dictators and people on lists that you can't sell weapons to and then she waves that and lets the
[2:14:32.280 --> 2:14:36.920]  state department give a green light to shipping weapons to countries in exchange for money i mean
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:42.600]  these people really are the criminals criminal yeah look the clinton foundation is not a foundation
[2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:48.200]  and it's not a charity it's two things it's a slush fund for grifters and secondarily it's just a
[2:14:48.200 --> 2:14:54.760]  vehicle for the facilitation of massive bribes so for example the country of qatar wants to overthrow
[2:14:54.760 --> 2:15:00.440]  qaddafi who although he's not a great guy is an ally of the united states is feeding us intelligence
[2:15:00.440 --> 2:15:07.480]  on al qaeda they put 1.5 million in bill's pocket for a 20 minute speech bribe they put a million
[2:15:07.480 --> 2:15:13.480]  dollars in hillary's pocket for a 20 minute speech bribe they put 2.5 million dollars
[2:15:13.480 --> 2:15:18.360]  into the clinton foundation at the same time they're paying off tony blare in the uk and
[2:15:18.360 --> 2:15:25.720]  sarcosia in france and lo and behold we topple qaddafi and women in libya who under qaddafi were
[2:15:25.720 --> 2:15:31.960]  allowed to vote be educated go outside without a veil drive a car choose their own husband women
[2:15:31.960 --> 2:15:37.480]  have been set back 200 years in libya they go from having the best quality of life in the continent
[2:15:37.480 --> 2:15:43.480]  of africa to the worst that's hillary clinton the advocate for women it is like she's a wicked witch
[2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:50.200]  i mean it's not normally fair to just use analogies like that i'll get you in your little log too but
[2:15:50.200 --> 2:15:56.360]  everything she touches she just gets destroyed everything she does is evil and then her lies
[2:15:56.360 --> 2:16:02.360]  about being in combat you know being shot at when they landed in syria none of it's true
[2:16:02.360 --> 2:16:08.520]  brian williams loses her job over it not her how can she get away with so much it's amazing so last
[2:16:08.520 --> 2:16:14.200]  week she comes out uh with a two weeks ago with a gun control proposal and she says in it that if
[2:16:14.200 --> 2:16:19.400]  you have been accused of domestic abuse you should not be allowed to own a gun well under that
[2:16:19.400 --> 2:16:24.120]  circumstance she wouldn't be allowed to own a gun because as we've proven the book she has kicked
[2:16:24.120 --> 2:16:29.480]  bitten scratched slapped and thrown hard objects at her husband this is a woman with a volcanic
[2:16:29.480 --> 2:16:36.520]  temper a foul mouth very short tempered very very greedy uh this is someone who doesn't have the
[2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:41.080]  temperament to be president as you know it's been reported i mean from fbi agents and others that
[2:16:41.080 --> 2:16:46.280]  work in the white house that she rolls on the floor and choose carpet only the person i know that
[2:16:46.280 --> 2:16:51.560]  does that was hitler that that's pretty amazing look we do know this that when she was in arkansas
[2:16:51.560 --> 2:16:56.280]  attending to her sick father and she learned that bill clinton was entertaining barbara
[2:16:56.280 --> 2:17:01.080]  stryce and overnight at the uh white house she flew back to washington the next day he appeared
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:06.600]  with an enormous scratch across his face dd mires the press secretary the president tried to say
[2:17:06.600 --> 2:17:13.240]  initially that he had cut himself shaving she was forced to admit no hillary had scratched him
[2:17:13.240 --> 2:17:17.480]  so was that because she wanted a piece of the action no i think it was because he was humiliating
[2:17:17.480 --> 2:17:23.160]  her you see i think they have this weird uh dysfunctional sham relationship where uh
[2:17:23.160 --> 2:17:28.760]  chelsea clinton is not bill's biological daughter hubble right webster hubble i document this in
[2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:36.280]  the book bill has a mixed race african-american son in arkansas uh dany williams uh without any
[2:17:36.280 --> 2:17:42.520]  question the son of bill clinton and bobby and williams now the star magazine the star tabloid
[2:17:42.520 --> 2:17:48.200]  wrote in 99 when hillary was warming up for the senate race that a dna test had disproved that
[2:17:48.200 --> 2:17:53.960]  i tracked this down the star was owned at that time by man named robert altman altman headed the
[2:17:55.080 --> 2:18:01.000]  sec under bill clinton was forced to resign major donor to the clinton campaigns clinton foundation
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:07.160]  clinton roommate at georgetown the new owners of the star american media they opened their files
[2:18:07.160 --> 2:18:14.280]  for me guess what there is no dna test there never was dumb but they tell us black lives matter
[2:18:14.280 --> 2:18:19.240]  alex black lives matter unless you're unless you're danie williams in which case they can just sweep
[2:18:19.240 --> 2:18:23.640]  you out into the carpet so the clintons they lecture us about it takes a village to raise a
[2:18:23.640 --> 2:18:30.120]  kid why don't they step up and love support acknowledge nurture their son danie williams
[2:18:31.400 --> 2:18:35.640]  well because it doesn't fit into the larger narrative of where the clintons even came from
[2:18:35.640 --> 2:18:40.280]  yes we i mean we know clinton's story but but but what about hillary digging into her what are
[2:18:40.280 --> 2:18:46.040]  other little juicy tidbits in the book well we talk extensively we examine the relationship between
[2:18:46.040 --> 2:18:51.640]  she and huma abedin i mean huma abedin is um her parents and her brothers of course are active in
[2:18:51.640 --> 2:18:57.960]  the muslim brotherhood uh she has a full security clearance and a full-time job at the state department
[2:18:57.960 --> 2:19:03.080]  she's the only woman in the history of the us government to have a waiver that allows her to
[2:19:03.080 --> 2:19:08.600]  not only work full-time for the state department but also work for tanao which is a clinton connected
[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:14.200]  lobbying firm that represents a number of middle eastern governments in front of uh the state
[2:19:14.200 --> 2:19:19.000]  department while she's triple dipping and get a check out of the clinton foundation when she
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:24.840]  travels with hillary they stay in the same room we know this because i foy the their travel uh
[2:19:24.840 --> 2:19:29.640]  schedules and when we asked the state it really is amazing how much you fared it out yes and when
[2:19:29.640 --> 2:19:34.280]  you ask the state department why is that they say well hillary has an acute health problem
[2:19:34.280 --> 2:19:38.120]  and therefore she might need to be attended to in the night well she's got a health problem
[2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:43.160]  but we need to know that look i spent 40 years in the corroded rectum of the two-party system i worked
[2:19:43.160 --> 2:19:48.040]  for three republican presidents i was on nine presidential campaigns worked in the senate worked
[2:19:48.040 --> 2:19:52.120]  in the house you know the bushes and the clintons are in this together that's the other thing in the

[2:24:23.640 --> 2:24:27.400]  maybe we could pick your brain about trump but you were telling me off air trumps for real
[2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:32.120]  oh there's no question look i i don't agree with trump on everything we've been friends 37 years
[2:24:32.120 --> 2:24:37.320]  i very strongly supported for president for one simple reason you can't buy trump you can't bully
[2:24:37.320 --> 2:24:42.040]  trump he doesn't answer to wall street he doesn't answer lobbyists he doesn't interest in special
[2:24:42.040 --> 2:24:46.440]  interests not the coke brothers no one donald trump is his own man he'd be the first president
[2:24:46.440 --> 2:24:52.680]  we've had who really work solely for the american people uh and it's that incorruptibility plus uh
[2:24:52.680 --> 2:24:57.320]  he's not afraid to take on you know unpopular politically incorrect stances he knows that
[2:24:57.320 --> 2:25:01.800]  some there's something hinky about 9 11 he knows the immigration well i know he's suddenly been
[2:25:01.800 --> 2:25:05.160]  saying stuff about it freaking the bushes out and you were telling me that you're educating him
[2:25:05.160 --> 2:25:10.600]  well he's a reader the nice thing about trump is that he he's open minded and he was astounded
[2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:15.480]  by what he learned that as you know alex that we had numerous warnings that this was going to
[2:25:15.480 --> 2:25:21.640]  happen that went completely unheeded uh and it's just like the birther question trump fearlessly
[2:25:21.640 --> 2:25:26.600]  brought that into the mainstream you and i know it but you couldn't get it on cbs or nbc or cnn
[2:25:26.600 --> 2:25:32.040]  or msnbc trump is the guy who brought the whole question of obama's birth and where he was really
[2:25:32.040 --> 2:25:36.440]  born into the political mainstream where people could consider it and it's why he zoomed to the
[2:25:36.440 --> 2:25:41.080]  head of the polls three years ago he should have challenged mit romney then i was in favor of going
[2:25:41.080 --> 2:25:46.760]  then so um i remain his strongest supporter and a close friend i what do you expect the clinton's
[2:25:46.760 --> 2:25:51.400]  to do to try to come after him well they're already trying to spread this rumor that you know donald
[2:25:51.400 --> 2:25:55.960]  was always in bed with organized crime let me tell you something you cannot get a new jersey casino
[2:25:55.960 --> 2:26:01.640]  control license and hold one for 13 years if you're in bed with the mob it's just not possible
[2:26:01.640 --> 2:26:06.200]  they have the most stringent laws they put a practice scope right up your dairy air and they
[2:26:06.200 --> 2:26:12.440]  look at every financial transaction in your entire life donald trump uh is clean and they got nothing
[2:26:12.440 --> 2:26:16.440]  on him i mean well why would you want to be in bed with the mob they take money from me anyways
[2:26:16.440 --> 2:26:20.520]  well i think the supposition is he's in the construction industry has to buy cement he's
[2:26:20.520 --> 2:26:24.840]  in the northeast you know guys guys who are italian therefore he must be mobbed up it's a
[2:26:24.840 --> 2:26:29.240]  mcguffin it's bull but they're going to try to smear him with that that's coming wait and see
[2:26:29.240 --> 2:26:33.800]  you're going to see it out of politico you're going to see it out of cnn it's going to go nowhere
[2:26:33.800 --> 2:26:37.160]  they don't have anything on him because what you see is what you get that's the great thing about
[2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:44.120]  trump he is unscripted he is uncoached he is uncontrolled he might say anything i love the
[2:26:44.120 --> 2:26:50.920]  idea of a hillary trump debate because he'll get right in her face on the drugs on the misogyny on
[2:26:50.920 --> 2:26:58.120]  the on the corruption on the clinton foundation on her her covering up rape uh and the serial rape
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:03.240]  of her husband uh he's gonna really go after i have no doubt about it the guy's fearless i mean
[2:27:03.240 --> 2:27:08.680]  you've you've seen him he's totally completely fearless and nobody can get to him i mean uh
[2:27:08.680 --> 2:27:13.960]  having worked in the senate having worked in the house having been on heavy duty lobbyists i can
[2:27:13.960 --> 2:27:18.840]  tell you for example that every dollar of waste in the federal budget was put there by someone
[2:27:18.840 --> 2:27:22.920]  who wants it there and that's the reason no one ever really cuts it sure it's their piece of the
[2:27:22.920 --> 2:27:27.160]  pie all right they all talk about it trump would be immune to that he would take an axe to the
[2:27:27.160 --> 2:27:32.680]  federal budget so when the commentators say oh your your tax cut plan on working people would
[2:27:32.680 --> 2:27:38.280]  cause a 1.5 trillion dollar hole why do you assume that trump is going to cut the daylights out of
[2:27:38.280 --> 2:27:42.760]  out of federal spending he would and then when the lobbyists call and say oh you can't cut that
[2:27:42.760 --> 2:27:48.280]  he would be immune to that you can't get to trump well here's the issue as you know they keep ballooning
[2:27:48.280 --> 2:27:53.320]  things it's all going to go bankrupt we have to save the ship right well uh look unless somebody
[2:27:53.320 --> 2:28:00.120]  gets serious about cutting federal spending uh bringing back all uh those uh the two trillion
[2:28:00.120 --> 2:28:06.280]  dollars that's offshore and inversion uh and actually negotiating a trade deal with the chinese
[2:28:06.280 --> 2:28:11.400]  the mexicans the japanese which is in our interest instead of giving away the store uh you know this
[2:28:11.400 --> 2:28:15.800]  country's headed to the toilet you know that only trump can save america in my opinion because he's
[2:28:15.800 --> 2:28:20.840]  independent of the of the washington power structure this is short segment long segment's
[2:28:20.840 --> 2:28:25.640]  coming up but getting back into hillary and things they might pull i mean it's bold for
[2:28:25.640 --> 2:28:31.800]  george soros and the white house uh and fashion furious and the kill the cops movement and all
[2:28:31.800 --> 2:28:36.200]  that i mean they really are trying to destabilize this country you've been an insider you've seen
[2:28:36.200 --> 2:28:40.600]  it from all of our perspectives what do you think they're really trying and are they being successful
[2:28:41.320 --> 2:28:45.480]  well i think we're in very perilous times on the other hand the liberty movement has never
[2:28:45.480 --> 2:28:51.320]  been stronger than it is today there was a time we had one congressman now we have about 30 uh and
[2:28:51.320 --> 2:28:55.240]  thank god for the internet of course the real reason they want to regulate the
[2:28:55.240 --> 2:29:01.400]  internet is to shut our communications down if it weren't people for people like you uh and and for
[2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:08.120]  that extent me who are out there uh all you know working to get out an alternative narrative not
[2:29:08.120 --> 2:29:13.800]  only about our history about what is happening today um we would we'd have no prospect at all
[2:29:13.800 --> 2:29:19.320]  this is why i think trump is striking the cord that he is because he's not politically correct
[2:29:19.320 --> 2:29:23.960]  he's willing to say things that need to be said in order to save the country and i can just tell you
[2:29:23.960 --> 2:29:29.640]  the power structure is going out of their mind they've they've evanquished jab now they're elevating
[2:29:29.640 --> 2:29:38.360]  marco is the next uh puppet of the establishment and trump's pair to devastate him too wow and uh
[2:29:38.360 --> 2:29:43.080]  i'll tell you one thing for sure it's going to be very exciting times we are not living in boring
[2:29:43.080 --> 2:29:50.520]  times it is just explosive what's happening we'll be back we're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:50.520 --> 2:29:54.280]  one alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:29:58.280 --> 2:30:03.320]  hamtrantic michigan is experiencing culture shock after becoming the first majority muslim city in
[2:30:03.320 --> 2:30:07.800]  the us for example business owners routinely advertise their products in arabic and they
[2:30:07.800 --> 2:30:13.480]  can't obtain liquor licenses within 500 feet of a mosque but besides this cultural shift hamtrantic
[2:30:13.480 --> 2:30:18.760]  also serves as a microcosm of america's economy hamtrantic was the home of a chrysler automobile
[2:30:18.760 --> 2:30:23.720]  plant back during the mussel car era of the 60s and early 70s everything for implemeth barracuda
[2:30:23.720 --> 2:30:27.880]  as the dodge charges were built at the hamtrantic plant but now the plants closed down just like
[2:30:27.880 --> 2:30:32.920]  america's manufacturing base when the u.s dollar was chosen as the international medium of exchange
[2:30:32.920 --> 2:30:37.800]  decades ago u.s still had a strong manufacturing base but now it does it and the only reason why
[2:30:37.800 --> 2:30:42.120]  we're still able to maintain a trade deficit is due to global demand for the dollar but eventually
[2:30:42.120 --> 2:30:46.280]  other countries will stop accepting dollars for their products because we barely manufacture
[2:30:46.280 --> 2:30:50.920]  anything anymore when that happens the us economy will close down just like the hamtrantic automobile

[2:34:14.120 --> 2:34:20.600]  up on info wars dot com they're openly talking about not letting you link to a website under
[2:34:20.600 --> 2:34:25.480]  copyright law and that's what's in the tpp and that's what drudge was told by a supreme court justice
[2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:32.680]  earlier this year and he came here to warn us just a month ago that they're coming next year
[2:34:32.680 --> 2:34:38.440]  for the free speech so listen it's all or nothing now because we're winning in the info war we have

[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:48.120]  you got to have it and the system doesn't like it we're the real classical liberals that want lower

[2:35:25.640 --> 2:35:31.160]  had that happen to them but it's a great conversation starter and then on the back say info wars

[2:35:38.600 --> 2:35:43.400]  he gave me you can go to rogerstone dot com and get this bad baby and support what he's doing
[2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:49.560]  the clinton's war on women new york times best-selling author and then it's the cover
[2:35:49.560 --> 2:35:53.400]  of the book uh to get the word out and where to her campaign events because this woman
[2:35:53.400 --> 2:35:57.640]  has got to be stopped i'm gonna wear that i'm gonna wear this tomorrow night in dallas at my
[2:35:57.640 --> 2:36:02.520]  book sign that is awesome my friend and then the clinton's war on women the new book uh in
[2:36:02.520 --> 2:36:06.920]  the bookstores everywhere rogerstone dot com you need to get it you need to send it to talk show
[2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:12.600]  how she did it cover because we may know that these are serial women abusers but the general public
[2:36:12.600 --> 2:36:17.400]  still isn't really aware of because glorious time and others have been covering it up yeah the the
[2:36:17.400 --> 2:36:21.800]  clinton's are moving heaven and earth to try to bury this book within hours of it being released
[2:36:21.800 --> 2:36:28.200]  two twos days ago i tracked an inordinate number of one star reviews on amazon one sentence this
[2:36:28.200 --> 2:36:32.840]  book is crap this book has all been discredited this is the same old thing rogerstone's a right
[2:36:32.840 --> 2:36:38.600]  wing hitman uh i have my own it people they didn't take them long to track every one of those those
[2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:45.080]  reviews to the exact same ip address where the clinton headquarters in brooklyn new york
[2:36:45.080 --> 2:36:50.040]  and to their credit when my lawyers contacted amazon they took those down so folks if you read
[2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:55.400]  the book if you like the book do two things pass it on to another woman because if every woman reads
[2:36:55.400 --> 2:37:00.680]  this book hillary clinton will get no votes for women and secondary if you like the book go on amazon
[2:37:00.680 --> 2:37:05.640]  leave a favorable review the book is this close to the new york times bestseller list and if it makes
[2:37:05.640 --> 2:37:11.880]  it it's so much harder for the mainstream media to ignore what is the truth well you've got an
[2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:16.440]  average of 78 percent reviews so they're they're attacks aren't working too well well because
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:20.840]  we had a number of them removed and our number therefore went up i've never paid a person
[2:37:20.840 --> 2:37:25.960]  to go online i don't organize people to go on other than when i'm on radio when i'm tv uh
[2:37:25.960 --> 2:37:30.600]  on liberty oriented outlets i ask people if you like the book if you think we're striking a court
[2:37:30.600 --> 2:37:36.120]  here go on amazon and let people know well we're in an info war and it's not that the republican
[2:37:36.120 --> 2:37:41.080]  party is perfect either you're about to expose the bushes here it's just that the system's scared of
[2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:46.360]  a patriot takeover the republican party that's our best avenue there's a war going on right now
[2:37:46.360 --> 2:37:52.120]  no question and it's time to defeat all these rhinos and i don't know if trump's perfect you know
[2:37:52.120 --> 2:37:56.280]  and a lot of folks i know that know about the scenes they know he's the real deal all i know
[2:37:56.280 --> 2:38:01.240]  is he didn't hillary clinton and i'm not into lesser two evils she says she's coming for my gun
[2:38:01.240 --> 2:38:06.280]  she says she's getting rid of the borders she says families are basically bad uh and i know how
[2:38:06.280 --> 2:38:10.200]  and i know what the clinton's have done to me personally with dirty tricks when that when he
[2:38:10.200 --> 2:38:16.200]  was president i don't want to live under that again so for me this is personal as well uh
[2:38:16.200 --> 2:38:21.000]  get into jeb bush because do you think he was ever really running against her i mean they're
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:25.800]  too tenacious and too arrogant to be a ringer for hillary right but wouldn't he kind of de facto
[2:38:25.800 --> 2:38:30.280]  turn into a ringer for well they're in business together look the clinton's and the bushes are
[2:38:30.280 --> 2:38:34.600]  constantly rehabilitating each other compliment each other elevate each other several months
[2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:39.960]  ago think about it alex she was attacking jeb why she wanted to elevate him within the republican
[2:38:39.960 --> 2:38:45.480]  contest he was he was uh he was he was listening and she needed to prop him up i'll tell you what
[2:38:45.480 --> 2:38:52.200]  his job is designated loser that's his position they know so he knows that look the together they
[2:38:52.200 --> 2:38:59.080]  found as they form a non-profit they raise 138 million dollars for Haitian earthquake relief
[2:38:59.080 --> 2:39:05.560]  they spend 10 million in haish in Haiti they pocket the under the other 128 million they closed the
[2:39:05.560 --> 2:39:11.480]  non-profit they answer no questions this is the bush clinton crime syndicate in january i have a
[2:39:11.480 --> 2:39:17.240]  book coming out called jeb and the bush crime family you can go on amazon and pre-order it right now
[2:39:17.240 --> 2:39:23.560]  the entire arc of crime by the clip by the bush family jeb who was a drug dealer in his college
[2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:29.880]  and and boarding room days in his early business days in houston and miami uh prescott bush who
[2:39:29.880 --> 2:39:34.760]  made his money arming the nazis who made his money off slave labor in the steel he was actually
[2:39:34.760 --> 2:39:38.840]  our main lawyer in the u.s. yeah and his bank was confiscated by the truman administration
[2:39:38.840 --> 2:39:45.720]  i turned him a folded up for him for uh for uh for treasonous activity uh george hw bush who only
[2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:51.880]  avoided indictment in the iran contra matter because he stonewall the special prosecutor he
[2:39:51.880 --> 2:39:57.240]  wouldn't hand over documents as you know alex he's the one who oversaw the trafficking of millions
[2:39:57.240 --> 2:40:02.680]  of dollars worth of cocaine into the united states to illegally be sold and raise money
[2:40:02.680 --> 2:40:07.080]  for the contrast and his partner in that the governor they found who would let them ship the
[2:40:07.080 --> 2:40:12.600]  cocaine into his state but the other way bill clinton and it's i'm not giving ron reagan the
[2:40:12.600 --> 2:40:16.680]  past i've talked to the folks that were in the white house they literally kept him compartmentalized
[2:40:16.680 --> 2:40:20.760]  we sort of trying to dig into it that's when they shot him there's no question about it first of all
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:26.120]  hinkley is not did not shoot the bullet that hit reagan as i as i will show in my upcoming book
[2:40:26.120 --> 2:40:30.360]  there's a second shooter sure there's so much we have not been told they had dinner with hinkley a
[2:40:30.360 --> 2:40:35.160]  few days before there's so many more there's so many more that was in the that was in the Denver
[2:40:35.160 --> 2:40:39.880]  post there's so many more connections between hinkley and the bushes there's an immediate struggle
[2:40:39.880 --> 2:40:44.600]  by the bush people for control of the football immediately while reagan is incapacitated here's
[2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:48.360]  what people do and then alexander haig runs out and says i've got it i'm in control well here's
[2:40:48.360 --> 2:40:56.520]  what's interesting bush pressured reagan to sign a secret transfer of power agreement haig was opposed
[2:40:56.520 --> 2:41:01.320]  ed meese the attorney general was opposed weinberg and the secretary defense every single member of
[2:41:01.320 --> 2:41:05.000]  the reagan cabinet was opposed sure that's what i heard people made fun in the bush system of
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:08.680]  haig but haig was actually saying no i've got it you don't have it right because they were trying
[2:41:08.680 --> 2:41:13.960]  to get it right so what happens here is reagan signs the secret transfer of power agreement that
[2:41:13.960 --> 2:41:18.840]  says that in the event of the president being incapacitated here's what will happen and as soon
[2:41:18.840 --> 2:41:25.400]  as he signs six days later there's an attempt on his life by a man associated with the bush family
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:31.720]  now all five of hinkley shots are accounted for none of them hit reagan there's a second gunman
[2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:36.760]  you can clearly see him in the pictures in my next book uh i lay out the entire bush connection to
[2:41:36.760 --> 2:41:40.040]  the reagan assessment well i want to sell your books on our store too i'm gonna carry them all
[2:41:40.600 --> 2:41:44.840]  i knew who you were i've met you before i don't know why i wasn't thinking get you on
[2:41:44.840 --> 2:41:48.680]  because i mean i know a lot of your amazing work and then richard reeves thank god one of my friends
[2:41:48.680 --> 2:41:51.400]  and does some work with us called up and said don't you want to get this guy on you're writing
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:55.080]  articles about it yeah i really want to thank you for coming in i appreciate being here what's crazy
[2:41:55.080 --> 2:41:59.240]  is i've done all the research myself but you forget so much of it you're here spewing it out
[2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:03.240]  you've got a document in your book you start thinking of all the stuff the bushes the clintons
[2:42:03.240 --> 2:42:08.280]  have done they're like james bond villains oh it's work they're worse they're worse because
[2:42:08.280 --> 2:42:13.800]  they're look this is what we call elite deviants the bushes and the clintons they can lie they can
[2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:18.760]  steal they can do drugs they can traffic drugs they can have their own email server they can misuse
[2:42:18.760 --> 2:42:24.920]  classified documents they can have people murdered uh they can they can be involved in epic financial
[2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:30.680]  fraud and they pay no price the laws don't apply to the bushes or the clintons uh that's why i'm for
[2:42:30.680 --> 2:42:35.640]  trump we have to change this it's time for these criminals to be brought to justice the question
[2:42:35.640 --> 2:42:39.400]  is if trumps for real which i believe you that he thinks he's for real certainly is better than
[2:42:39.400 --> 2:42:44.040]  hillary they're going to come after him and you said they're going to claim mafia ties i mean that's
[2:42:44.040 --> 2:42:49.240]  talk about the pot calling the kettle black yeah plus he has just tripled up his personal security
[2:42:49.240 --> 2:42:55.320]  as you may know he's been afforded so uh secret service uh protection that kind of bothers me
[2:42:55.320 --> 2:42:58.680]  if you don't you don't want that i don't think you do i think a they're spying for the government
[2:42:58.680 --> 2:43:03.400]  and b you don't know that you're safe in their hands but and they asked me now i'm not saying
[2:43:03.400 --> 2:43:08.520]  the average guy's bad but that's usually how they get you they've got their shadow specter operatives
[2:43:08.520 --> 2:43:13.160]  to use a popular term hydro whatever you want to call it they've got their operatives in every major
[2:43:13.160 --> 2:43:18.760]  agency there's no question about that so look i i do think wait until thom starts talking about
[2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:24.280]  monetary reform because i know his views on monetary reform uh and the printing press money
[2:43:24.280 --> 2:43:27.800]  that we keep churning out you give us any little secrets or i guess yeah he's a hard money man he
[2:43:27.800 --> 2:43:32.440]  thinks it's time to look at gold i can tell you that right now trump understands that the bankers
[2:43:32.440 --> 2:43:37.880]  have gone crazy uh and that the federal reserve is you know is not provided for in our government
[2:43:37.880 --> 2:43:42.600]  well it seems like he is getting more informed all the time when he went after jeb on 9 11 and
[2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:46.600]  i was told by another person that knows him that no no he knows what's going on now you're telling
[2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:51.400]  me and it's on record used to be his campaign had this is wild well and i we're gonna get him in here
[2:43:51.400 --> 2:43:56.680]  to do your show because i think you guys will hit it off he's a truth teller now look his political
[2:43:56.680 --> 2:44:02.360]  interests are not that that long meaning when the country was stronger he was just focused on building
[2:44:02.360 --> 2:44:08.120]  his business and his brand the man is above all a patriot he's giving up the greatest life in the
[2:44:08.120 --> 2:44:12.920]  world i mean he's got a beautiful family he's got a luxury existence he could play golf every
[2:44:12.920 --> 2:44:17.480]  afternoon on the greatest golf course in the world which he built uh he's climbed every business
[2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:22.200]  mountain you can climb in terms of great development great hotels great businesses he's got an
[2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:28.840]  international uh a billion dollar company he's met more world leaders face to face one on one
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:34.200]  that anybody else running for president people find that interesting uh but he doesn't want a new cold
[2:44:34.200 --> 2:44:39.640]  war with putin no he understands that that's that that that there's a whole culture as you know alex
[2:44:39.640 --> 2:44:45.080]  of endless war they're always trying to sell you on war he thinks he thinks for example lindsey
[2:44:45.080 --> 2:44:50.920]  graham this he thinks this guy's a jerk uh and he called him out as a jerk uh lindsey was all over
[2:44:50.920 --> 2:44:55.480]  him for campaign contributions oh donald here's my here's my personal cell phone number anytime you
[2:44:55.480 --> 2:45:00.200]  need anything just call me as you may remember trump called it out on national television yeah
[2:45:00.200 --> 2:45:05.720]  so uh no look i think he's the real deal i can tell you he is unscripted and uncontrolled
[2:45:05.720 --> 2:45:10.520]  which means that the political establishment cannot control him boy they're going to come
[2:45:10.520 --> 2:45:13.960]  after him i think probably with the same thing they came after reagan was well they've already
[2:45:13.960 --> 2:45:18.680]  tried i mean they've tried first to discredit him remember they said oh after his immigration
[2:45:18.680 --> 2:45:23.640]  comments he's going to crash and burn then after he took on john mccain he's going to crash and burn
[2:45:23.640 --> 2:45:27.400]  then they said that he's not going to show up for the debates there's no way he'll show up for the
[2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:33.880]  debates after every debate he went up so uh i think the guy is fearless i think he's having the time
[2:45:33.880 --> 2:45:38.120]  of his life and then carson's blowing himself up in front of everybody now i can't figure out the
[2:45:38.120 --> 2:45:43.480]  carson thing out it's uh i just don't see him having the the strength look the job is chief
[2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:48.520]  executive trump is a guy who's run a multi-billion dollar international company with hundreds of
[2:45:48.520 --> 2:45:54.120]  thousands of employees he's a manager and he could better manage the country i don't think you need
[2:45:54.120 --> 2:46:00.680]  to know the name of every obscure uh rebel islamic fanatic leader all you need to know is who the good
[2:46:00.680 --> 2:46:04.680]  guys or the bad guys are wouldn't it be nice to have a president of the united states who put the
[2:46:04.680 --> 2:46:09.640]  united states government no trump has said don't don't back isis which would which our government's
[2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:13.800]  been doing and then he's he supports taking him out and he supports the russians he says great
[2:46:13.800 --> 2:46:18.440]  let the russians pay for it i mean that's a perfect plan well somebody else to take him out that's
[2:46:18.440 --> 2:46:22.760]  even better let's look at historically there's only one man running for president in this election
[2:46:22.760 --> 2:46:27.160]  who was opposed to the iraq war who said it was an enormous mistake and that's final trump
[2:46:27.160 --> 2:46:33.560]  that is true both parties were for it yeah even bernie sanders you know who says he's a democratic
[2:46:33.560 --> 2:46:37.880]  socialist which is like being a meat eating vegetarian i mean you're either a socialist
[2:46:37.880 --> 2:46:41.160]  do you believe in democracy you can't believe in both they're not consistent you think bernie
[2:46:41.160 --> 2:46:46.840]  sanders is just really stupid or is he evil uh actually i think he's worse he's a true believer
[2:46:46.840 --> 2:46:51.720]  knows he's a he's a true believing socialist he believes in the state and can state control of
[2:46:51.720 --> 2:46:55.880]  our lives even though it never works anywhere right because his his solution is simple the
[2:46:55.880 --> 2:46:59.880]  government's going to do everything for you he just doesn't mention the 85 percent tax rate
[2:46:59.880 --> 2:47:05.240]  that he has in mind and that always select insider groups are basically exempt and consolidate power
[2:47:05.240 --> 2:47:09.320]  but and that's what socialists don't get the same people that have gamed our system now
[2:47:09.320 --> 2:47:14.840]  are going to game a socialist system even worse don't they understand that no and what's interesting
[2:47:14.840 --> 2:47:20.280]  of course is i did a book signing here in austin last night uh night before last and we had a really
[2:47:20.280 --> 2:47:24.440]  great turnout brave new books which is a great little freedom oriented bookshop i think you've
[2:47:24.440 --> 2:47:29.880]  been there yep uh half the people there were bernie sanders people because they know that hillary
[2:47:29.880 --> 2:47:35.480]  is not a liberal or a progressive she's a whore for wall street she'll be aware for whatever the
[2:47:35.480 --> 2:47:39.240]  money is they're the ones that set up all the derivatives under clinton right so the left
[2:47:39.240 --> 2:47:44.120]  will buy her it's not that she's a true believer she's just buyable the sorrows of this world
[2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:50.040]  can buy her she believes in in nothing so just as the bushes are not conservatives they're crony
[2:47:50.040 --> 2:47:56.440]  capitalists the clintons are really crony capitalists but they'll be bought by the the big government
[2:47:56.440 --> 2:48:01.560]  the big business interests of the left so even those people know that she's inherently evil and
[2:48:01.560 --> 2:48:05.240]  she must be stopped we're going to go to break and come back with a few politically correct
[2:48:05.240 --> 2:48:08.120]  phone calls for this segment the next till about five after and then you're going to be on the
[2:48:08.120 --> 2:48:11.640]  nightly news tonight really want to get you on the show more often because everything you're
[2:48:11.640 --> 2:48:17.240]  saying from my own research is dead on be said so eloquently but what are other big tidbits that
[2:48:17.240 --> 2:48:20.120]  you wouldn't you know i don't want to say talking points but points you had in your mind you wanted
[2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:24.440]  to make when you got here that you'd like to make in the next three minutes well i guess the largest
[2:48:24.440 --> 2:48:29.880]  single one is that you know look i was a republican my entire life and i had great sentimental attachment
[2:48:29.880 --> 2:48:34.840]  to the republican party of berry goldwater that was the small government personal freedom keep the
[2:48:34.840 --> 2:48:38.440]  government out of your business out of your bedroom that's the ron paul republican right
[2:48:38.440 --> 2:48:43.640]  they barely exist anymore unfortunately both parties have morphed into one party it's the party of
[2:48:43.640 --> 2:48:48.920]  endless war it's the party erosion of our civil liberties it's the party of massive debt and more
[2:48:48.920 --> 2:48:54.040]  borrowing it's the party of high taxes on working people but the but the hedge fund managers on
[2:48:54.040 --> 2:48:59.640]  wall street they pay virtually nothing uh so uh it's it's very hard for me i'm a registered
[2:48:59.640 --> 2:49:03.480]  libertarian at this point although there's a lot of folks there that i think are nuts too
[2:49:03.480 --> 2:49:09.080]  the problem here is that that the old republican party um will only be worth fighting for if we
[2:49:09.080 --> 2:49:13.000]  have a leader within it i'll probably switch back to the republican party to vote for for
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:17.160]  donald trump and next year's primaries because he's the first candidate i've seen who i'm actually
[2:49:17.160 --> 2:49:22.680]  enthusiastic about i've been trying to get him to run for president since 1988 when i took him
[2:49:22.680 --> 2:49:27.240]  to new hampshire to speak to the port smith uh new hampshire chamber of commerce vice president
[2:49:27.240 --> 2:49:33.240]  bush had been there the week before had 500 people donald trump went with 2800 people this is 1988
[2:49:33.240 --> 2:49:37.480]  sure i don't want to get any infighting going on but i know you know glenn back uh he does a lot
[2:49:37.480 --> 2:49:43.080]  of good things we support what most of his work he doesn't like donald trump and i understand some
[2:49:43.080 --> 2:49:46.760]  of the reasons because of his you know past political activities just being a businessman
[2:49:46.760 --> 2:49:52.040]  in new york when hillary was a senator but i mean so far he he he is saying the right things
[2:49:52.040 --> 2:49:55.800]  and he's better than the other candidates yeah look i like glenn and i'm looking forward to
[2:49:55.800 --> 2:50:00.760]  asking him you know what his beef is with donald trump uh people do evolve politically i don't
[2:50:00.760 --> 2:50:05.000]  think trump was all that politically aware or interested when the country was stronger
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:10.200]  and he was building his business he is right he's played the game if you're a businessman
[2:50:10.200 --> 2:50:15.160]  if you don't put campaign contributions into the pockets of the politicians they don't even
[2:50:15.160 --> 2:50:19.400]  listen to you it's not that you're buying favors you can't even buy an audience and you have an
[2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:23.960]  obligation when you have thousands of people working for you to get your point of view in front
[2:50:23.960 --> 2:50:29.560]  of government so sure he has a relationship and frankly his attitude was we have a federal limit
[2:50:29.560 --> 2:50:34.280]  on donations so the first 10 politicians who walk in give them the maximum share them on
[2:50:34.280 --> 2:50:38.280]  their way they're all worthless anyway and now when they show up asking for money sale i'd love
[2:50:38.280 --> 2:50:43.000]  to help you but i've already hit my legal max well i know this and we did have a president
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:48.200]  that wasn't actively trying to put us in the world government and the tpp we would it'd be like
[2:50:48.200 --> 2:50:53.000]  untying a boat from the dock when the engine's on we are tied up i mean they're fighting to
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  keep us politically and financially suppress the controllers all you gotta do is cut that out
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:51:02.360]  and we'll explode the following is an important holiday inventory announcement from id stronghold

[2:53:55.720 --> 2:54:25.560]  have to give it up for me well roger stone rogerstone.com is our guest
[2:54:25.560 --> 2:54:29.720]  really interesting fellow and back when trump was considering running on this exploratory
[2:54:29.720 --> 2:54:33.480]  committee was the head of his campaign and so uh i'll hold you to it we i don't think we really
[2:54:33.480 --> 2:54:37.080]  even tried to get trump on we should really push to do that we shouldn't think they're
[2:54:37.080 --> 2:54:41.320]  guest too big to get on the show we've had a lot of big guests obviously on over the years that's a
[2:54:41.320 --> 2:54:46.120]  no-brainer i think we actually have tried but it's it's hard because it's a small campaign
[2:54:46.120 --> 2:54:51.000]  staff take two uh two uh two uh get through to him next i will try to set that up i think he'd
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:55.800]  have a good time and i think you'd enjoy talking to him you guys had hit it off because he is very
[2:54:55.800 --> 2:55:01.720]  upset about the about the direction of the country he's given up a lot to make this race but he wants
[2:55:01.720 --> 2:55:07.080]  to make america great again and trust me he's the real deal well i hope you're right we'll
[2:55:07.080 --> 2:55:11.400]  certainly find out if he gets elected and then gets in there i know this people are really
[2:55:11.400 --> 2:55:14.920]  counting on him so if he gets in there he better deliver of course they could just let everything
[2:55:14.920 --> 2:55:20.760]  fall apart once he gets in which is kind of the timeline and then blame him for what happens
[2:55:20.760 --> 2:55:25.160]  i think they're gonna have their hands full this guy is a take charge guy he's an optimist
[2:55:25.160 --> 2:55:29.640]  there's nothing he can't do look he's a working graduate he's very smart he knows exactly what's
[2:55:29.640 --> 2:55:35.640]  going on here he's sick of the whole political correct agenda he understands that freedom is on
[2:55:35.640 --> 2:55:41.400]  the ropes uh and he's saying that gun-free zones are places for crazy people to go kill the guy
[2:55:41.960 --> 2:55:47.000]  this we care he's carrying anytime you see him trust me brother he's carrying he's had a concealed
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:51.880]  carry permit in new york which they don't give out they're very hard to get oh and the media acted
[2:55:51.880 --> 2:55:55.800]  like it's weird that he'd want to have a gun when he's a target how many death threats do you think
[2:55:55.800 --> 2:56:00.440]  he gets a week i mean it's extraordinary and they ask us not to talk about it uh well that shows
[2:56:00.440 --> 2:56:05.480]  how warped it is yeah exactly but he gets a lot of death threats oh well sure because he's speaking
[2:56:05.480 --> 2:56:10.360]  out on a lot of controversial subjects so you do say he's tripled his security he's tripled his
[2:56:10.360 --> 2:56:16.280]  security uh he himself carries both his sons are gun enthusiasts very active hunters and gun
[2:56:16.280 --> 2:56:21.480]  enthusiasts they both carry i love it uh you know they're strong believers in the second man oh he was
[2:56:21.480 --> 2:56:26.440]  president he'd carry well you know obama's not carrying anything but maybe a reagan carried
[2:56:26.440 --> 2:56:31.720]  reagan had a holster you know on his uh calf he was carrying about 80 percent of the time
[2:56:31.720 --> 2:56:35.560]  when he was running for president and when he was president well you're crazy if you don't yep
[2:56:35.560 --> 2:56:39.640]  everybody's like hey let the cops have guns what about us yeah i'm sure he wishes he was carried
[2:56:39.640 --> 2:56:43.480]  when hinkley tried to take him out or hinkley and others tried to take him just like the sir
[2:56:43.480 --> 2:56:47.960]  hands sir hand crap aj called in earlier i had to put him on hold and he mentioned going to this
[2:56:47.960 --> 2:56:52.280]  red robin hamburger place i'm at the police state and they've got where you order your food from a
[2:56:52.280 --> 2:56:57.560]  computer it's got a camera watching you i saw a chili's ad where it's got a camera so he was
[2:56:57.560 --> 2:57:04.760]  going to finish his story so what happened when you discovered this um well basically uh i asked him
[2:57:04.760 --> 2:57:09.320]  to wait for some you know what's the deal with the camera inside there and she's like what camera
[2:57:09.320 --> 2:57:14.840]  looked at the television screen and as you said well there's a camera in there i had no idea
[2:57:14.840 --> 2:57:21.160]  uh you could just turn it away if you want so alex from what she told me i basically garnered
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:29.160]  two ideas in my head of what she knew she either lied to me or it's just completely stupid and
[2:57:29.160 --> 2:57:34.520]  unawake i hope she i think it's not even stupid they just don't care they're in a trance i appreciate
[2:57:34.520 --> 2:57:38.600]  your call i'm glad you finished the story but we're going to go out to a chili's that's the
[2:57:38.600 --> 2:57:44.120]  place i know is doing it i mean talk about 1984 yeah it's interesting what it means is you gotta
[2:57:44.120 --> 2:57:47.800]  have a piece of masking tape when you go get a burger that's the thing what does trump think
[2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:53.560]  about the whole nsa thing i think he's opposed to government spying i mean he is uh you know we have
[2:57:53.560 --> 2:57:59.160]  been very concerned when i was there about whether his own phone calls his own email were being looked
[2:57:59.160 --> 2:58:05.080]  at um he's obviously got an enormous a number of advisors in business and around the globe who are
[2:58:05.080 --> 2:58:09.720]  giving him uncensored information that you'd never get from the government or the new york time shall
[2:58:09.720 --> 2:58:15.240]  we say so i i talk about a really unfettered intelligence stream yeah he he would be he would
[2:58:15.240 --> 2:58:21.640]  be a giant champion of the first amendment and i think he is very wary of the retreat act well
[2:58:21.640 --> 2:58:25.720]  compare him to political correctness hillary agreeing we should ban words trump says you're
[2:58:25.720 --> 2:58:29.640]  all a bunch of crazy people yes i mean it's it's definitely good we're gonna come back take a

[3:00:24.040 --> 3:00:31.480]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and we're doing this is our fourth hour
[3:00:31.480 --> 3:00:36.120]  of the news wrap up we're also going to have at the bottom of the hour abby johnson a planned
[3:00:36.120 --> 3:00:41.720]  parenthood whistleblower she used to be a manager here in texas of a planned parenthood facility
[3:00:41.720 --> 3:00:47.960]  she knows them from the inside out and as we pointed out earlier in the show the planned
[3:00:47.960 --> 3:00:53.960]  parenthood crowd is very upset that some raw videos have leaked out of a house investigation
[3:00:53.960 --> 3:00:59.880]  committee this is the committee chaired by jason chaffetz who was also one of those in the running
[3:00:59.880 --> 3:01:05.240]  for the house speakership to replace john bainer they were looking at these planned parenthood
[3:01:05.240 --> 3:01:10.040]  videos that were done by the center for medical progress and of course planned parenthood said
[3:01:10.040 --> 3:01:15.880]  well these things have been dishonestly and deceptively edited so the committee said give us
[3:01:15.880 --> 3:01:21.080]  the raw footage we'll take a look at that so the abortionists replied and of course this is the
[3:01:21.080 --> 3:01:26.360]  national abortion federation they got a temporary restraining order said no no no you better not
[3:01:26.360 --> 3:01:33.160]  let that stuff get out nevertheless it did leak somebody a house staffer apparently leaked this
[3:01:33.160 --> 3:01:40.520]  to a conservative website got news the editor ignored the injunction and said i will contest any
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:46.840]  unconstitutional prior restraint of speech so they have he has now put out the unedited raw
[3:01:46.840 --> 3:01:53.720]  footage and so the question is why would they object to that if there's not anything that is
[3:01:53.720 --> 3:01:59.800]  incriminating i want to take a look in this hour before we get to abby johnson's interview at the
[3:01:59.800 --> 3:02:06.680]  bottom of the hour i want to take a look also at this issue of the $750 pill is it corporate greed
[3:02:06.680 --> 3:02:13.000]  is it excessive regulation or is it both this is an article by mary ruart someone in that i knew
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:17.960]  from the libertarian party she ran for office multiple times in libertarian party she's somebody
[3:02:17.960 --> 3:02:21.560]  who worked in the pharmaceutical industry i think she has an interesting take on that and there's
[3:02:21.560 --> 3:02:27.800]  been an update on this story as well so we're going to talk about what has come up with that in the
[3:02:27.800 --> 3:02:32.760]  next segment but first i want to go back to this story that just broke on cnn about a former irs
[3:02:32.760 --> 3:02:38.280]  official lowest learner they say she will not be charged this is what cnn is reporting there will
[3:02:38.280 --> 3:02:45.480]  be no charges against former irs official lowest learner or anyone else at the agency said the
[3:02:45.480 --> 3:02:53.320]  justice department in a letter yeah obama's justice department the same people that would not take
[3:02:53.320 --> 3:03:00.680]  any action against banks that were laundering money for drug dealers and terrorists multiple
[3:03:00.680 --> 3:03:07.000]  times caught doing that they would not take any action against the banks who are rigging the libor
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:15.160]  rate okay that's the london interbank exchange rate that is used to set up all as an index to set
[3:03:15.160 --> 3:03:19.400]  up interest rates and to adjust your variable rate interest i mean if you've got something like a
[3:03:19.400 --> 3:03:24.920]  credit card if you've got a home loan that is set up as a variable rate loan it's based on the libor
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:32.680]  rates and they're not they were manipulating that to make money in london criminally manipulating
[3:03:32.680 --> 3:03:37.640]  that but of course nobody's going to go to jail for that nobody's going to go to jail for targeting
[3:03:37.640 --> 3:03:42.840]  people at the irs either they say they found substantial evidence of mismanagement of poor
[3:03:42.840 --> 3:03:49.960]  judgment of institutional inertia leading to the belief by many tax exempt applicants that the irs
[3:03:49.960 --> 3:03:55.480]  targeted them based on their political viewpoints but poor management is not a crime says the
[3:03:56.280 --> 3:04:03.080]  justice department well evidently if you know the right people nothing is a crime in america anymore
[3:04:03.880 --> 3:04:09.560]  that's really what we're seeing here this is nothing but criminals getting away with it
[3:04:09.560 --> 3:04:14.680]  we just heard hillary clinton laughing about the fbi investigating her and understand
[3:04:14.680 --> 3:04:20.840]  that the government as i mentioned before they prosecuted an nsa whistleblower thomas drake
[3:04:22.200 --> 3:04:28.840]  and they said that he had classified documents on his private server they said he had unclassified
[3:04:28.840 --> 3:04:35.960]  documents on his private server they came after him it was a baloney prosecution but nevertheless
[3:04:35.960 --> 3:04:41.320]  that would have been a crime if he had really done that and people have been prosecuted for that
[3:04:41.320 --> 3:04:44.840]  but it depends on what level you are in the government because that's the kind of corrupt
[3:04:44.840 --> 3:04:57.240]  government we have stay with us we'll be right back to talk about this $750 pill
[3:04:58.200 --> 3:05:04.280]  the dc police chief urges citizens to fight back against peristyle attackers speaking
[3:05:04.280 --> 3:05:10.440]  with 60 minutes on sunday washington dc police chief kathy leneer urged residents to do what's
[3:05:10.440 --> 3:05:16.600]  necessary to save lives in the event of a terror attack or mass shooting whether it means run hide
[3:05:16.600 --> 3:05:21.880]  or fight if you're in a position to try to take the gunman out it's the best option for saving
[3:05:21.880 --> 3:05:26.680]  lives before police can get there leneer said while acknowledging her latest suggestion was
[3:05:26.680 --> 3:05:31.960]  counterintuitive to previous tactics the police have advised leneer claimed that taking action
[3:05:31.960 --> 3:05:37.640]  may be essential to prevent another massacre like the attack in paris which left over 120 people
[3:05:37.640 --> 3:05:44.120]  dead we always tell people don't take action call 911 don't intervene in the robbery leneer said
[3:05:44.120 --> 3:05:50.120]  we've never told people take action but it's a different scenario keep up with our latest news

[3:08:35.240 --> 3:08:42.120]  videos have been leaked from a house committee investigating the uh the videos that were put
[3:08:42.120 --> 3:08:47.240]  out by the um center for medical progress i had to look it up it's such a generic name and it was
[3:08:47.240 --> 3:08:52.040]  brilliant for them to use that name because it makes them look like a medical organization
[3:08:52.040 --> 3:08:55.960]  but i always such a generic name i always have to look it up whenever i mention it but the center
[3:08:55.960 --> 3:09:00.920]  for medical progress did the undercover videos they said oh they're heavily edited and then the raw
[3:09:00.920 --> 3:09:05.640]  videos they were concerned would get out so they got a court injunction but they have leaked out
[3:09:05.640 --> 3:09:14.040]  nevertheless going back to the clinton ben gazi committee hearing of course many people this
[3:09:14.040 --> 3:09:20.520]  is unfolded over such a long period of time that just like the irs investigations of lois
[3:09:20.520 --> 3:09:25.320]  learner what the irs is doing targeting political groups that's now been thrown out by the justice
[3:09:25.320 --> 3:09:29.080]  department they say she's not going to be charged and nobody else at the irs is going to be charged
[3:09:29.080 --> 3:09:36.360]  either they let these investigations drag out for a very very long time and people start to
[3:09:36.360 --> 3:09:42.680]  forget the startling elements of these things when they first broke just like we forget the timeline
[3:09:42.680 --> 3:09:50.920]  of ben gazi we forget that hillary clinton and the justice the uh state department came up with
[3:09:50.920 --> 3:09:56.520]  multiple explanations for what had happened there we got a different explanation every day
[3:09:56.520 --> 3:10:03.080]  for several days they charged a filmmaker and put him in jail saying that he had incited the riot
[3:10:03.880 --> 3:10:09.320]  absolute nonsense but that's the level they will go to she will lie to the face of the
[3:10:09.320 --> 3:10:16.040]  people whose family died there in order to cover up what really happened there she will throw
[3:10:16.040 --> 3:10:21.000]  the former ambassador who died and was drugged through the streets she will throw him under
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:26.840]  the bus now saying well we were relying on him to help us with information to help us with
[3:10:26.840 --> 3:10:33.640]  information about security no no they knew what was going on there and it was also part of an arms
[3:10:33.640 --> 3:10:40.200]  trade that was going on there but of course now there's no question that libya has become a
[3:10:40.840 --> 3:10:47.240]  terrorist arms bazaar thanks to our failed foreign policy of obama and the secretary of state
[3:10:47.240 --> 3:10:53.240]  but she just laughed this off one of the things that came out of the hearing yesterday i thought
[3:10:54.200 --> 3:10:59.400]  it was interesting what what drudge noticed and he had this up at the top of the drudge report
[3:11:00.840 --> 3:11:04.280]  one of the things that he thought was most significant about it was hillary clinton's
[3:11:04.280 --> 3:11:09.320]  coughing fit let's listen to what happened as they were asking her questions he said maybe this
[3:11:09.320 --> 3:11:14.680]  brings up some serious questions about her health maybe that's the most interesting thing to come
[3:11:14.680 --> 3:11:20.520]  out of these hearings versus in europe commanded a missile cruiser a missile destroyer a tanker he
[3:11:20.520 --> 3:11:34.280]  served in vietnam in the persian gulf excuse me you need some water madam if anybody in the
[3:11:34.280 --> 3:11:44.280]  audience knows heimlich maneuver please remain seated would you would you like to take this goes
[3:11:44.280 --> 3:11:48.360]  on for quite some time we won't play the rest of it here because people turning out on the radio
[3:11:48.360 --> 3:11:53.560]  will kind of wonder what's going on with somebody just coughing and silence there but of course
[3:11:53.560 --> 3:11:59.720]  the questioner a democrat was covering for her on that as well he just started monologuing about
[3:11:59.720 --> 3:12:04.920]  whatever to fill time so people wouldn't notice that she couldn't talk at all so i think that was a
[3:12:04.920 --> 3:12:09.240]  pretty pretty interesting development the drudge thought it was interesting said maybe that's the
[3:12:09.240 --> 3:12:15.240]  most interesting thing to come out of the Benghazi hearings because they are essentially stonewalling
[3:12:15.240 --> 3:12:21.480]  there as they have everywhere else with the irs uh frauds with the prosecutions the non-prosecutions
[3:12:21.480 --> 3:12:28.440]  of banks everywhere by the mayor putin is saying says that the us is using terrorists as a battering
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:34.120]  ram to overthrow disliked regimes of course they of course they are we've been saying that for a
[3:12:34.120 --> 3:12:40.040]  long time and it's good that he is saying this it's good that we have people on the world stage
[3:12:40.040 --> 3:12:46.280]  pointing out that we are using terrorists as surrogates he certainly knows that he saw us using
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:53.560]  al-qaeda against russia and afghanistan they were called the mujahazin mujahazin remember back in
[3:12:53.560 --> 3:13:00.200]  the reagan's time they created them they equipped them against the russians they then eventually
[3:13:00.200 --> 3:13:06.680]  became al-qaeda some of bin laden was one of their guys they've also used islamic terrorists to attack
[3:13:06.680 --> 3:13:13.960]  russia via the chechnya islamicists and they moved those same chechens the same chechen islamic
[3:13:13.960 --> 3:13:20.440]  jihadis they moved to syria we had an interview with one of the leaders go public just about
[3:13:20.440 --> 3:13:26.200]  three weeks ago i think it was where he was talking about how they had relocated them the cia and
[3:13:26.200 --> 3:13:32.760]  others had relocated them from using them against russia into syria so that's precisely what they're
[3:13:32.760 --> 3:13:37.240]  doing and putin has another article from putin that's on uh that one was on info wars dot com
[3:13:37.240 --> 3:13:42.280]  that's michael felon you can check out the details on that putin also says there's no need to distinguish
[3:13:42.280 --> 3:13:48.840]  between moderate and other terrorists are there really moderate terrorists i don't think so i think
[3:13:48.840 --> 3:13:54.360]  that uh they're all terrorists except we have to understand and this is finally starting to come
[3:13:54.360 --> 3:14:00.680]  out that the united states is using all of these people as surrogates and has for a very long time
[3:14:02.040 --> 3:14:06.760]  let's go to health news at this moment that we've had a lot of back and forth
[3:14:06.760 --> 3:14:11.560]  saying that it was a market failure remember when we had that guy who was a a young hedge fund
[3:14:11.560 --> 3:14:16.600]  manager made a lot of money decided he'd buy a pharmaceutical company touring pharmaceuticals
[3:14:16.600 --> 3:14:21.560]  his name he the ceo was martin screlly i think is the way you pronounce his last name nevertheless
[3:14:21.560 --> 3:14:28.200]  he bought this pharmaceutical company that had a very old drug that was now that its its patent
[3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:34.760]  had expired and they were selling this drug for 13 dollars and 50 cents per pill and he raised the
[3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:44.120]  price to 750 dollars a pill the pill was dariprem and it's being used at the moment for people who
[3:14:44.120 --> 3:14:51.960]  are struggling with AIDS and so that 5000 increase and the price of that drug many people said how
[3:14:51.960 --> 3:14:57.720]  you know look at this this is what happens when you have unbridled capitalism this kind of greed
[3:14:58.280 --> 3:15:03.320]  well mary ruart writes the column and she says a 750 dollar pill is it corporate greed or is it
[3:15:03.320 --> 3:15:09.240]  excessive regulation or is it both now she is someone who is a she's a libertarian writer and
[3:15:09.240 --> 3:15:15.160]  activist she's also been a pharmaceutical researcher so she knows what happens inside the FDA
[3:15:15.880 --> 3:15:21.720]  and she points out that touring pharmaceuticals has had a de facto monopoly courtesy of the ever
[3:15:21.720 --> 3:15:28.040]  increasing costs of gaining FDA approval both for new drugs over a billion dollars and 11 years
[3:15:28.040 --> 3:15:34.120]  and for generics any generic company could make this drug dariprem this patent expired decades
[3:15:34.120 --> 3:15:39.800]  ago however the FDA would require that the company demonstrate that its pill released the drug into
[3:15:39.800 --> 3:15:46.120]  the bloodstream at the same rate as the original dariprem so coupled with the cost of setting up
[3:15:46.120 --> 3:15:51.160]  FDA approved manufacturing facilities for their drug a turnaround time of a couple of years or so
[3:15:51.160 --> 3:15:57.000]  due to regulatory red tape and the expensive clinical trials a generic company would need to
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:16:02.680]  commit to spending many millions perhaps tens of millions of dollars even with the special
[3:16:02.680 --> 3:16:09.400]  exemption that the FDA gives drugs that have a small or an orphan patient population she says
[3:16:09.400 --> 3:16:14.760]  FDA mandated drug development both new and generic virtually eliminates competition
[3:16:15.400 --> 3:16:20.040]  and see that's the question when you look at this and you say this guy was able to raise the price
[3:16:20.040 --> 3:16:28.440]  from 1350 to 750 dollars a pill a 5000 increase why was he able to do that or are the other companies
[3:16:28.440 --> 3:16:33.880]  that are coming out with drugs and she points out well you don't have a free market when you have
[3:16:33.880 --> 3:16:41.640]  excessive regulation by the FDA see the FDA has enacted a certain kind of drug prohibition haven't
[3:16:41.640 --> 3:16:47.400]  they we have the DEA which says you can't take recreational drugs hallucinogenics or whatever
[3:16:47.400 --> 3:16:51.880]  they just have prohibited it like they did alcohol prohibition except without the constitutional
[3:16:51.880 --> 3:16:57.080]  amendment of course because we don't really need the constitution anymore we just say it's uh make
[3:16:57.080 --> 3:17:04.600]  it so but the FDA has gone the other direction the FDA says everything is prohibited for medical use
[3:17:04.600 --> 3:17:12.040]  unless expressly permitted so you have to get even special permission if you have a fatal disease
[3:17:12.040 --> 3:17:16.520]  in order to use it you can't experiment uh be part of an experimental program even if you're
[3:17:16.520 --> 3:17:22.040]  going to die the FDA does not allow that except under some circumstances you can beg them for
[3:17:22.040 --> 3:17:26.680]  permission and perhaps they'll let you be part of a program but you can't make that determination
[3:17:26.680 --> 3:17:33.240]  on your own see that's the other side of drug prohibition the idea and this is pervasive throughout
[3:17:33.240 --> 3:17:36.840]  the government the idea that everything is prohibited unless expressly permitted that we
[3:17:36.840 --> 3:17:43.880]  have no rights we only have government granted privileges well now there's a new twist on this
[3:17:44.920 --> 3:17:50.200]  this is reported by occupied democrats and they're looking at this and they say well the price
[3:17:50.200 --> 3:17:57.160]  gouging pharmaceutical ceo who is uh tried to raise this by 5000 it looks like now he's going
[3:17:57.160 --> 3:18:04.760]  to be undercut by another company a san diego-based company announced that it will sell this drug
[3:18:04.760 --> 3:18:12.920]  dariprim as low as 99 for a 100 pill supply they say yeah that's right it's just over a dollar per
[3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:19.480]  pill so not only are they going to cut down this this pill that he wanted to sell for 750
[3:18:19.480 --> 3:18:24.680]  dollars but he was selling it for decades at 1350 and nobody went into competition with him
[3:18:25.400 --> 3:18:30.360]  now these people are saying they're going to do it at one dollar a pill and i find that very
[3:18:30.360 --> 3:18:37.160]  interesting because it just shows that unless you get this kind of attention and i still have
[3:18:37.160 --> 3:18:42.200]  questions based on what mary ruart wrote she's very knowledgeable about the pharmaceutical
[3:18:42.200 --> 3:18:47.080]  industry based on what she wrote is this going to be something like the mcdonnell's announcement
[3:18:47.080 --> 3:18:54.280]  that they're going to go to natural whole foods to uh no antibiotics in their meat to grain fed
[3:18:54.280 --> 3:18:57.480]  beef and that sort of thing but oh yeah if you read the fine print that's going to be
[3:18:58.040 --> 3:19:02.520]  years maybe decades down the road that's not something that's going to happen right away
[3:19:02.520 --> 3:19:08.760]  this might be a pr campaign by this particular company i don't know how long it's going to take
[3:19:08.760 --> 3:19:15.160]  them to get approval for this they may be able to expedite that but that's precisely the issue
[3:19:15.160 --> 3:19:20.520]  if you have a true free market somebody can come in and create the pill and sell it for
[3:19:20.520 --> 3:19:25.000]  whatever they can manufacture it for at 1350 they were making a huge profit if these people
[3:19:25.000 --> 3:19:30.760]  can do it for a dollar but you have to have a free market when the socialists like bernie sanders
[3:19:30.760 --> 3:19:36.120]  say that capitalism has failed i would say we haven't tried it we don't have a free market
[3:19:36.120 --> 3:19:41.400]  we have crony capitalism and we have a highly regulated market and most of those regulations
[3:19:41.400 --> 3:19:47.880]  are put on by the pharmaceutical companies they want the fda to have those kind of restrictions
[3:19:47.880 --> 3:19:53.000]  on there because they want to keep competition out of their market stay with us we'll be right
[3:19:53.000 --> 3:19:58.840]  back and we'll have an update on how cnn is spending the ebola news about the practitioners don't

[3:23:09.240 --> 3:23:13.640]  we typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the need for water
[3:23:13.640 --> 3:23:18.920]  but have you considered heat storage i'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are some things
[3:23:18.920 --> 3:23:24.120]  for you to consider how will i keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or
[3:23:24.120 --> 3:23:28.680]  propane but the problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you
[3:23:29.400 --> 3:23:34.520]  another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war
[3:23:34.520 --> 3:23:39.640]  there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly
[3:23:39.640 --> 3:23:45.160]  than you think for these answers go to fortress clothing dot com again fortress clothing dot

[3:24:28.120 --> 3:24:33.800]  because we've got a government by criminals and for criminals you know hillary clinton one of
[3:24:33.800 --> 3:24:37.240]  the things that came out in the Benghazi trial just day was the fact that she says i didn't
[3:24:37.240 --> 3:24:42.920]  even have a computer in my state department office she says most of my work was done uh on
[3:24:43.640 --> 3:24:47.720]  most of the work was not done on emails with my closest aides with officials in the state
[3:24:47.720 --> 3:24:51.560]  department officials in the rest of the world as well as a white house and people around the world
[3:24:51.560 --> 3:24:57.400]  in other words world world world ignore the email issues here look of course they don't use emails
[3:24:57.400 --> 3:25:05.080]  remember when we were in uh at bill de berg in kopenhagen and we saw ed balls who was the shadow
[3:25:05.080 --> 3:25:11.800]  chanceler of the checker that would be essentially they we don't have shadow people put in particular
[3:25:11.800 --> 3:25:16.840]  offices here in the united states but uh if the republicans who are out of office if they wanted
[3:25:16.840 --> 3:25:22.120]  to put up an opposition or shadow secretary of the treasury that would be the equivalent position
[3:25:22.120 --> 3:25:29.560]  well ed balls chose up to bill de berg and he's got a carry-on luggage bag that he's wheeling
[3:25:29.560 --> 3:25:34.600]  through there that is full of papers now you look at this and you say well you know why
[3:25:34.600 --> 3:25:38.840]  doesn't ed ball just put all that on a little tiny laptop you know or an ipad or something you
[3:25:38.840 --> 3:25:43.640]  know he could he could have his notes there he could show people he might even impress his
[3:25:43.640 --> 3:25:48.280]  fellow bill de berg attendees with some kind of really cool powerpoint display or something right
[3:25:49.080 --> 3:25:54.920]  no these people don't like to put stuff on computers because they get hacked so they walk
[3:25:54.920 --> 3:26:00.600]  around with their little suitcases full of paperwork and as he was trying to come in they
[3:26:00.600 --> 3:26:06.920]  were asking him for his for his credentials he couldn't find his credentials and he starts
[3:26:06.920 --> 3:26:11.640]  going through his bag and my wife was there taking pictures of him and he's fumbling and all the
[3:26:11.640 --> 3:26:17.240]  stuff is falling out of his suitcase you can see he's got an entire suitcase filled with paper
[3:26:17.240 --> 3:26:22.360]  documents for his co-conspirators at bill de berg and that's the way this works you know i mean
[3:26:22.360 --> 3:26:28.600]  why should we be concerned for example of the cia when somebody hacks the director's emails
[3:26:28.600 --> 3:26:32.520]  and takes a look at what he's gotten of course he's got a lot of personal emails that are there
[3:26:32.520 --> 3:26:37.480]  but listen to something that came out of one of these emails one of the things attached to these
[3:26:37.480 --> 3:26:43.800]  emails was communication that was reflecting government communication say and he says everyone
[3:26:43.800 --> 3:26:49.720]  we spoke with on the ground in afghanistan this is a memo from lewis tucker who is a minority
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:54.760]  staff director for the senate intelligence committee vice chairman christopher kit bond
[3:26:54.760 --> 3:26:59.080]  okay so these are people who are working on the senate intelligence committee and he sends an email
[3:26:59.640 --> 3:27:06.280]  to direct cia director john brennan and this email is hacked by a teenager and this is what's
[3:27:06.280 --> 3:27:11.640]  attached to the email everyone we spoke with on the ground in afghanistan and pakistan confessed
[3:27:11.640 --> 3:27:18.920]  that they know of no overall us government strategy for the region rather we observed quality
[3:27:18.920 --> 3:27:25.400]  individuals serving judiciously in their own lanes ungoverned by a coordinated comprehensive strategy
[3:27:25.400 --> 3:27:31.800]  in other words nobody knows what's going on here we don't have any strategy in afghanistan or in
[3:27:31.800 --> 3:27:37.880]  pakistan well they don't need a strategy they don't need a goal their only strategy their only goal
[3:27:37.880 --> 3:27:44.200]  is endless war endless war for the military industrial complex it's interesting that we
[3:27:44.200 --> 3:27:48.440]  see them confessing this but of course they only do that privately that's one of the reasons why
[3:27:48.440 --> 3:27:52.920]  they try to hide everything that's one of the reasons why they have their own separate servers
[3:27:52.920 --> 3:27:59.000]  you can only imagine what was on some of the 30 000 emails that were deleted by hillary clinton and
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:03.720]  maybe they will find those maybe they won't certainly looks like the obama administration
[3:28:03.720 --> 3:28:07.800]  doesn't want the fbi to look they're sending out all kinds of signals saying that and of course
[3:28:07.800 --> 3:28:15.160]  they're giving the irs a pass on something that is orders of magnitude greater than what
[3:28:15.160 --> 3:28:23.000]  richard nixon was impeached for so we now have a criminal kleptocracy that uh allows anything to
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:27.720]  go if you are well connected enough and one of the ways that they do this of course is by
[3:28:27.720 --> 3:28:32.680]  spending information in the media a good example of this is a story about uk ebola nurse kaffirki
[3:28:33.240 --> 3:28:37.480]  this is the british nurse that was given a clean bill of health she had contracted ebola while she
[3:28:37.480 --> 3:28:42.040]  was treating people in africa she was given a clean bill of health last january then she
[3:28:42.040 --> 3:28:47.480]  had a relapse nine months later news organizations all over the world were talking about she nearly
[3:28:47.480 --> 3:28:53.320]  died about a week ago and then she began to get better she's now in a serious condition but she
[3:28:53.320 --> 3:28:59.000]  was in critical condition she almost died she got meningitis and the news about that was hey
[3:28:59.800 --> 3:29:05.560]  she never really was cleared of ebola and as i started talking to scientists i said yeah
[3:29:06.200 --> 3:29:11.240]  we found that there was a case of sexual transmission of ebola because it hides out in sexual
[3:29:11.240 --> 3:29:17.400]  organs it hid out in a man's semen he transmitted it to a woman nine uh seven months later uh she
[3:29:17.400 --> 3:29:21.880]  subsequently died they found it in a doctor's eye but this is the way cnn spends it they say
[3:29:21.880 --> 3:29:27.400]  uk ebola nurse was suffering from meningitis not from a relapse in other words they say the
[3:29:27.400 --> 3:29:33.160]  meningitis was caused by ebola but not by the virus itself that's kind of like saying nobody
[3:29:33.160 --> 3:29:38.360]  ever died of ebola they died of dehydration or they died of a heart attack but they didn't die
[3:29:38.360 --> 3:29:43.960]  from ebola that's what they're telling us and yet the reality that they don't want you to see
[3:29:43.960 --> 3:29:49.960]  is that the ebola continued to say what it's gonna be right back we're on the march the empires on
[3:29:49.960 --> 3:30:01.480]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network all you pro vaccine people should rejoice at this news
[3:30:01.480 --> 3:30:07.240]  anti vaccine parents to stop receiving child care benefits under australian no jab no pay law the new
[3:30:07.240 --> 3:30:12.680]  changes that will take effect on january first 2016 are projected to save the australian government
[3:30:12.680 --> 3:30:17.960]  over 500 million dollars over four years and how many children are not receiving their vaccines
[3:30:17.960 --> 3:30:24.200]  according to the australian childhood immunization register it's 1.77 percent i thought all you needed
[3:30:24.200 --> 3:30:29.560]  was 90 to have heard immunity the government believes that by removing the non-medical exemption
[3:30:29.560 --> 3:30:33.720]  it will reinforce the importance of immunization and protecting public health but what this is
[3:30:33.720 --> 3:30:37.640]  really about is the government wants to put anything in your body that they want and they
[3:30:37.640 --> 3:30:42.440]  want to make sure you bend over and take it a footnote in the article is that by 2020 childless
[3:30:42.440 --> 3:30:47.000]  couples will overtake those with children now i know where the next muslim migrant invasion is

[3:33:14.600 --> 3:33:21.320]  and joining us now is abbey johnson a planned parenthood whistleblower and i appreciate you
[3:33:21.320 --> 3:33:26.520]  coming on right you just got off of a plane abbey i appreciate you coming here to the studio on such
[3:33:27.320 --> 3:33:32.600]  short short notice and and fighting traffic getting here just in the nick of time and she
[3:33:32.600 --> 3:33:38.840]  just walked into the studio right now and i want to ask her to comment on what's going on here in
[3:33:38.840 --> 3:33:45.640]  texas because in texas we've had the attorney general as well as the governor they've rated
[3:33:45.640 --> 3:33:51.080]  several planned parenthood organizations looking for records doing an investigation imagine that
[3:33:51.080 --> 3:33:55.720]  doing an investigation of criminal actions you're not going to see that happening from the federal
[3:33:55.720 --> 3:34:01.400]  government so i want to ask her to comment on that because it's not happening just here in texas this
[3:34:01.400 --> 3:34:06.440]  is something is happening in multiple states before we do i just want to go back we ran out of time
[3:34:06.440 --> 3:34:11.240]  at the the last segment talking about the way cnn was spinning this ebola thing and this is
[3:34:11.240 --> 3:34:18.280]  very important to understand we had a caller who called in last week and said you have to
[3:34:18.280 --> 3:34:24.040]  understand ebola is a virus it's not going to ever really truly leave your system and we learned
[3:34:24.040 --> 3:34:31.880]  because of the relapse of this nurse nine months after she was given the okay we learned that of
[3:34:31.880 --> 3:34:37.400]  course it can hide out in your in your eye it can hide out in your central nervous system which is
[3:34:37.400 --> 3:34:42.680]  where it hit out in this nurse it can hide out in the sexual reproductive organs and has been
[3:34:42.680 --> 3:34:50.840]  passed on and fatally passed on to someone else in africa so this is something that people should
[3:34:50.840 --> 3:34:55.000]  be concerned about they should know how this works and yet the government and especially the
[3:34:55.000 --> 3:34:59.240]  mainstream media does not want you to know that so they spin it with this headline and say well
[3:34:59.240 --> 3:35:05.080]  she was suffering from meningitis it wasn't a relapse i'm sorry but you know it was from ebola
[3:35:05.080 --> 3:35:08.680]  and they admitted that it was from ebola and listen to how they report it in the body of
[3:35:08.680 --> 3:35:14.120]  the article they say the uk nurse is suffering meningitis caused by ebola not the virus itself
[3:35:14.120 --> 3:35:20.200]  say doctors i mean talk about doublespeak and this is what the uk health official said they
[3:35:20.200 --> 3:35:27.560]  said it was an unusual late comp a complication yeah a late complication like nine months after
[3:35:27.560 --> 3:35:33.240]  she was given the go-ahead and said she was completely clear and allowed to treat other people
[3:35:33.240 --> 3:35:38.920]  that's what they don't want you to see that's why this uh they've had such a cavalier attitude
[3:35:38.920 --> 3:35:45.880]  about spreading this to the population even to the extent that this nurse kasey hickox who was uh who
[3:35:45.880 --> 3:35:51.320]  went to uh africa to treat patients there came back in new jersey she was quarantined by chris
[3:35:51.320 --> 3:35:55.720]  christie now she is suing chris christie for quarantining her and i guess my question would be
[3:35:55.720 --> 3:36:00.440]  if you're concerned about people's health if you don't want people to get ebola why wouldn't
[3:36:00.440 --> 3:36:05.320]  you quarantine yourself as a courtesy to other people as a concern to other people she goes to
[3:36:05.320 --> 3:36:10.440]  africa to help people with the ebola why wouldn't she try to keep that from spreading here why wouldn't
[3:36:10.440 --> 3:36:14.440]  she voluntarily quarantine herself i it's absolutely amazing to me it's one of the first
[3:36:14.440 --> 3:36:19.640]  times i've ever seen chris christie get something right and he is sued for doing it so here we go
[3:36:20.280 --> 3:36:25.320]  let's go to what's happening with plan parenthood and thank you for joining us abby johnson of course
[3:36:25.320 --> 3:36:31.960]  you've been a uh you are a manager at plan parenthood yep and we've talked before about uh how you
[3:36:31.960 --> 3:36:37.160]  saw things developing at plan parenthood just recap that briefly for people sure yeah a couple
[3:36:37.160 --> 3:36:43.720]  things uh one they implemented an abortion quota for us and actually doubled the number of abortions
[3:36:43.720 --> 3:36:48.200]  that we were supposed to be selling to women every month uh so that was the first thing the
[3:36:48.200 --> 3:36:54.600]  second thing though what what really caused me to leave was seeing a a live ultrasound guided
[3:36:54.600 --> 3:37:00.920]  abortion procedure take place where i saw a 13 week old baby fighting and struggling for his life
[3:37:01.960 --> 3:37:06.840]  at the hands of the abortionist and i left and plan parenthood sued me because apparently
[3:37:06.840 --> 3:37:13.320]  they think it's legal to become pro-life but they they lost and and now i'm just doing everything i
[3:37:13.320 --> 3:37:19.560]  can to expose what's taking place inside of these abortion clinics not just plan parenthood but
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:24.360]  certainly plan parenthood since they are our largest abortion chain sure sure and so what you
[3:37:24.360 --> 3:37:30.520]  saw there was that they were clearly operating for profit they were pushing you to push procedures on
[3:37:30.520 --> 3:37:35.320]  people and one of the things that we've seen in these undercover videos is that they are pushing
[3:37:35.320 --> 3:37:40.600]  women to sign these releases so that they can acquire parts that they've already talked to
[3:37:40.600 --> 3:37:45.560]  stem express and other people to know what it is that they want in terms of although we weren't
[3:37:45.560 --> 3:37:51.800]  even we weren't even honest about you know what we were really doing i mean i would i would you know
[3:37:51.800 --> 3:37:58.680]  i was being paid so for every woman that i got to consent to to participate in this research
[3:37:59.480 --> 3:38:07.160]  i got paid 20 bucks so that certainly lends itself to manipulative or coercive language oh
[3:38:07.160 --> 3:38:12.920]  yeah you incentivize it sure i mean yeah yeah oh you want to do this this is nothing it's gonna help
[3:38:12.920 --> 3:38:18.680]  save the lives of other people when in actuality we know that fetal tissue hasn't had any major
[3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:23.640]  medical breakthroughs since the inception of the research so and they can do stem cell research
[3:38:23.640 --> 3:38:27.960]  on adult stem cells yes they don't need to have the baby stem that's right and there actually
[3:38:27.960 --> 3:38:33.720]  have been significant medical breakthroughs because of adult stem cells which is always
[3:38:33.720 --> 3:38:39.240]  harvested in an ethical way and of course now when there's this article here i i didn't cover it
[3:38:39.240 --> 3:38:43.800]  in the news but a blood test that allows couples to screen out what they call abnormalities this is
[3:38:43.800 --> 3:38:50.120]  a spanish firm i genomics has made a compatibility test it costs about 1800 pounds it's available
[3:38:50.120 --> 3:38:57.320]  in britain so i guess you can if it's abnormalities or if it's maybe hair color uh you want a different
[3:38:57.320 --> 3:39:01.800]  baby with a different hair color different sex or whatever just just have an abortion yeah feels a
[3:39:01.800 --> 3:39:08.600]  little arian to me little hitler hitler ask yeah to me designer baby is getting what you want exactly
[3:39:08.600 --> 3:39:13.880]  that's that's where this is essentially going to to lead and of course we have seen that in the
[3:39:13.880 --> 3:39:19.160]  history of Planned Parenthood as well we've seen that it was targeted to certain groups targeted
[3:39:19.160 --> 3:39:23.640]  to the black community of course that was margaret singer was very clear about that i want to get
[3:39:23.640 --> 3:39:28.440]  your comment before we talk about what's going on here in the state of texas about this recent
[3:39:28.440 --> 3:39:33.800]  article from politico talking about how the raw video has now been leaked out of a house committee
[3:39:34.360 --> 3:39:38.040]  and they were telling everybody hey don't pay any attention to these videos from the center
[3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:42.840]  for medical progress don't pay any attention to that because those have been heavily edited
[3:39:42.840 --> 3:39:50.920]  and yet they don't want the the raw footage out there if they've got nothing to hide then
[3:39:50.920 --> 3:39:56.440]  who cares right why why go to these extreme links to make sure that the videos don't come out if
[3:39:56.440 --> 3:40:02.040]  everything they're doing is to help the general public through the research i mean and that that's
[3:40:02.040 --> 3:40:05.560]  kind of the thing i mean i guess i i worked in Planned Parenthood media for a while but i mean
[3:40:05.560 --> 3:40:12.040]  i've just been thinking the whole time why don't they just come out and say yeah we do this yep we
[3:40:12.040 --> 3:40:18.200]  do it yep we have cavalier conversations about aborting babies at dinner yep that is absolutely
[3:40:18.200 --> 3:40:23.640]  what we do and and that's part of our work and and we're proud of it because we are proud
[3:40:23.640 --> 3:40:27.240]  to perform abortions i mean that's really what they should just come out and stay instead of
[3:40:27.240 --> 3:40:33.320]  trying to hide it and suppress it and you know make all of these excuses just come on out with it
[3:40:33.320 --> 3:40:37.560]  i mean if if you're really proud of what you do if you really believe abortion is this great service
[3:40:37.560 --> 3:40:43.080]  if you really believe that that harvesting fetal tissue from these aborted babies is a good thing
[3:40:43.080 --> 3:40:47.880]  then just own it and be proud of it yeah yeah some of them do actually and it's actually
[3:40:48.520 --> 3:40:53.080]  it's not that's actually really creepy when you when you see that happen talk to us about what's
[3:40:53.080 --> 3:40:57.400]  going on here in the state of texas because this is something that's going on in multiple states
[3:40:57.400 --> 3:41:01.560]  we're not seeing any real investigation at the federal level in spite of the fact this committee
[3:41:01.560 --> 3:41:06.760]  is looking at these videos that's the only thing that we've seen in of course that's a republican
[3:41:06.760 --> 3:41:11.480]  committee who's doing that the justice department is not doing any investigation to see if they
[3:41:11.480 --> 3:41:20.120]  violated us law by by negotiating for for organ parts or if they are performing late term abortions
[3:41:20.120 --> 3:41:24.040]  as we see in these videos because they want more fully developed body parts those would all be
[3:41:24.040 --> 3:41:28.600]  violations of existing law they're just they're starting to look at that in the house committee
[3:41:28.600 --> 3:41:32.120]  but they're not the the obama administration the department justice are not looking at that
[3:41:32.120 --> 3:41:36.200]  but we do have some states that are looking at that tell us about texas yeah it's been really
[3:41:36.200 --> 3:41:40.920]  exciting actually you know we had already defunded in the state of texas we had already defunded
[3:41:40.920 --> 3:41:46.760]  plant parenthood of 29 million dollars but there was still like two and a half million left and
[3:41:47.240 --> 3:41:52.120]  you know we just kept being told we just can't pull it cms will come in and you know they'll
[3:41:52.120 --> 3:41:57.400]  shut down your whole medicaid program but but certainly there has to be some allowance for a
[3:41:57.400 --> 3:42:03.400]  state to say you're breaking the law we don't want you as part of our medicaid program right but
[3:42:03.400 --> 3:42:10.440]  you've got to have pretty solid evidence that they are breaking the law so the office of the
[3:42:10.440 --> 3:42:16.200]  investigator journalist by the way we have a new ig stewart bowen amazing man really on top of this
[3:42:16.200 --> 3:42:20.120]  and it's not just that he's you know well i'm pro-life so i want to shut down plant parenthood
[3:42:20.120 --> 3:42:27.640]  he's like i i want to make sure that we are being responsible with taxpayer dollars here in the state
[3:42:27.640 --> 3:42:35.160]  of texas and uh he's really going about it the right way uh you know he started looking at we've
[3:42:35.160 --> 3:42:41.960]  got three whistleblower lawsuits mine is is one of them from from former plant parenthood workers
[3:42:41.960 --> 3:42:50.600]  stating medicaid fraud very i mean serious medicaid fraud if we if if my case goes to court and we
[3:42:50.600 --> 3:42:55.080]  win the affiliate that i worked with plant parenthood golf course they're going to be fined about
[3:42:55.080 --> 3:43:03.720]  six hundred million dollars wow this is big money okay and this is our money and so you know basically
[3:43:03.720 --> 3:43:09.640]  the the oig said look we're gonna we're gonna look into this uh you know we have the videos
[3:43:09.640 --> 3:43:14.760]  showing this but but we need some we need some hard proof and these former clinic workers have
[3:43:14.760 --> 3:43:22.040]  that hard proof and so they've been looking through you know our complaint our allegations our cases
[3:43:22.840 --> 3:43:28.520]  and um and then they finally they went in there they stepped foot in there and said we're taking
[3:43:28.520 --> 3:43:34.600]  the records we need and a surprise surprise the only affiliate that wasn't cooperative was plant
[3:43:34.600 --> 3:43:39.320]  parenthood golf coast and that happened out of houston that happens to be where all three of the
[3:43:39.320 --> 3:43:44.200]  former employees came from so they don't want to be cooperative they don't they don't want us to see
[3:43:44.200 --> 3:43:47.960]  what's going on in there so you say they weren't cooperative what did they do well they were trying
[3:43:47.960 --> 3:43:53.480]  to prevent the oig from getting the records but i mean they have the power they're they're part of
[3:43:53.480 --> 3:43:57.640]  the medicaid contract so they have the power to get whatever they want and of course that that's
[3:43:57.640 --> 3:44:03.240]  that's legitimate if it's part of if somebody accuses them of wrongdoing it would be negligent
[3:44:03.240 --> 3:44:06.920]  on the part of the attorney general not to investigate it absolutely you know and so
[3:44:06.920 --> 3:44:13.640]  that's what we see repeatedly yet they talk about this as if they're being targeted unfairly unjustly
[3:44:13.640 --> 3:44:17.800]  we heard the same thing about the videos themselves oh you know they came in they lied to people
[3:44:17.800 --> 3:44:23.480]  about this i think it's like no if you have it's not entrapment if somebody has said something
[3:44:23.480 --> 3:44:27.800]  is happening here and you do an undercover investigation the fbi does that kind of stuff
[3:44:27.800 --> 3:44:31.960]  all the time and it's not entrapment if somebody says hey there's a crime being committed here
[3:44:31.960 --> 3:44:37.640]  here you need to investigate this then it's legitimate to go in and do an undercover investigation
[3:44:37.640 --> 3:44:42.920]  even if you represent yourself as that's the only way that they do most of these investigations
[3:44:42.920 --> 3:44:48.520]  and so that kind of investigation going in and looking at the records of a of an organization
[3:44:48.520 --> 3:44:53.800]  once they've been accused of wrongdoing that's a legitimate thing to do but the left is is
[3:44:54.520 --> 3:44:59.080]  and the apologists for Planned Parenthood are going apoplectic about this oh poor Planned
[3:44:59.080 --> 3:45:06.280]  Parenthood yeah poor billion dollar nonprofit yeah and i mean that's just what's so disingenuous
[3:45:06.280 --> 3:45:10.680]  about the whole thing is Planned Parenthood they they love to play the victim they need to play
[3:45:10.680 --> 3:45:17.240]  the victim in order to keep their support going uh you know we're just always trying to to to shut
[3:45:17.240 --> 3:45:22.520]  them down and you know pour us and and we're always a target yeah you are always a target
[3:45:22.520 --> 3:45:27.560]  because you're killing babies and you are always a target because you're giving substandard
[3:45:27.560 --> 3:45:33.320]  healthcare to women who come into your facilities and you are a target because you continue to promote
[3:45:33.320 --> 3:45:37.880]  and participate in the legal activity yeah you better believe you're absolutely a target and
[3:45:37.880 --> 3:45:43.160]  you're going to continue to be a target until we can find enough evidence to shut you down permanently
[3:45:43.160 --> 3:45:46.440]  you're talking about substandard healthcare i mean one of the things that came to light
[3:45:46.440 --> 3:45:52.200]  in these undercover videos is the fact that they would encourage the women to have a
[3:45:52.200 --> 3:45:58.360]  breached birth so they could get a better quote unquote specimen as they term the baby yeah i mean
[3:45:58.360 --> 3:46:03.080]  and that's not all i mean look we've got we have where i run an organization for abortion clinic
[3:46:03.080 --> 3:46:09.880]  workers uh so that they can leave and uh find hope and find healing and find a life affirming job
[3:46:09.880 --> 3:46:16.200]  away from the abortion industry and you know the things that these workers are coming out and telling
[3:46:16.200 --> 3:46:22.120]  us that's going on inside the clinics there was an inspection that we just got every every six
[3:46:22.120 --> 3:46:26.680]  months will do a public information request and and ask for the inspection reports because those
[3:46:26.680 --> 3:46:34.040]  are public record so the inspectors that go into these abortion clinics and uh we get inspections
[3:46:34.040 --> 3:46:40.360]  back all the time that say they are not properly sterilizing instruments these are instruments
[3:46:40.360 --> 3:46:47.880]  that are going inside a woman that are being used woman to woman they are not being properly sterilized
[3:46:47.880 --> 3:46:52.600]  and this may be a problem that continues to happen year after year yet these abortion clinics are
[3:46:52.600 --> 3:47:00.520]  still allowed to stay open i mean they they are putting women at very serious risk uh and very
[3:47:00.520 --> 3:47:05.880]  serious danger and look at the way the the the Planned Parenthood apologist reacted to the
[3:47:05.880 --> 3:47:09.960]  laws that that would try to correct that type of situation oh yeah they said oh you're just doing
[3:47:09.960 --> 3:47:14.360]  that because you don't want us to have abortions and they're not concerned about women's health
[3:47:14.360 --> 3:47:19.800]  they came out at the time that is about that time that Joan Rivers died having plastic surgery
[3:47:19.800 --> 3:47:25.080]  and they pointed out that if those same standards had been applied to where she was having plastic
[3:47:25.080 --> 3:47:29.720]  surgery then that wouldn't have happened to her she would have survived you know they would have
[3:47:29.720 --> 3:47:34.680]  the kind of oversight that they needed with that but they're not concerned about women's health
[3:47:34.680 --> 3:47:39.560]  they're just concerned about having more abortions and you could see it from their resistance to this
[3:47:39.560 --> 3:47:45.560]  legislation oh yeah i mean and and what's so pathetic is that these clinics they can't even
[3:47:45.560 --> 3:47:51.560]  keep up with the very minimum standards that that are in place right now uh but they say
[3:47:51.560 --> 3:47:55.560]  that they care about women they're not even properly sterilizing their instruments but
[3:47:55.560 --> 3:48:00.840]  they're trying to convince me that they care about women i mean gosh you've got women coming in there
[3:48:00.840 --> 3:48:06.840]  who are hiv positive who have other sexually transmitted i mean serious diseases and they're
[3:48:06.840 --> 3:48:12.280]  not even properly cleaning the instruments that are going inside one woman and the next
[3:48:12.280 --> 3:48:16.600]  i mean that's disgusting they don't have we just got one inspection back they're all of their
[3:48:16.600 --> 3:48:22.360]  life saving equipment their airway equipment all of that the uh defibrillator all of that
[3:48:22.360 --> 3:48:29.080]  had not been inspected since 2010 i mean god forbid a woman actually needed it they pull it out
[3:48:29.080 --> 3:48:35.000]  doesn't even work i mean i'm telling you these clinics they are so they are such poor care for
[3:48:35.000 --> 3:48:39.320]  women and they're not even providing the services that they say they're providing they're saying
[3:48:39.320 --> 3:48:44.760]  that they're providing all this comprehensive care for women that's ridiculous they are not providing
[3:48:44.760 --> 3:48:51.080]  half of the care that probably they're not providing 75 of the care that their apologists
[3:48:51.080 --> 3:48:57.400]  are saying that they do and if you try to tell them that oh i mean they just they can't say they
[3:48:57.400 --> 3:49:03.080]  can't take it they cannot take you trying to shut down their precious Planned Parenthood even though
[3:49:03.080 --> 3:49:07.480]  there are better providers for them to go and see exactly when they're talking about
[3:49:07.480 --> 3:49:11.480]  women's health and that's the line they always come back if you cut funding for Planned Parenthood
[3:49:11.480 --> 3:49:15.960]  you're going to be cutting funding for women's health but again when we go back to it and we say
[3:49:15.960 --> 3:49:19.400]  are you we're concerned about women's health we want to make sure that their that their equipment
[3:49:19.400 --> 3:49:24.040]  is up to date that they have all these other things that uh in case something goes wrong
[3:49:24.040 --> 3:49:28.440]  they say oh you just want to stop abortions because they know that's why they're supporting Planned
[3:49:28.440 --> 3:49:35.560]  Parenthood. Yeah it was interesting the uh NARAL or NAF or one of the pro-abortion groups came out
[3:49:36.440 --> 3:49:42.920]  not too long ago they said it was like this this shocking pro-liferous trying to shut down the
[3:49:42.920 --> 3:49:48.600]  abortion industry and i thought is that really shocking because yeah that is exactly what we're
[3:49:48.600 --> 3:49:53.960]  trying to do um and you know i don't i don't want to cut women's health care i want to make sure
[3:49:53.960 --> 3:49:59.080]  women are getting proper health care and and comprehensive health care when they do go
[3:49:59.080 --> 3:50:03.080]  to a medical office and they're not going to get that at Planned Parenthood uh they're going to get
[3:50:03.080 --> 3:50:06.120]  dirty instruments they're going to get they're not even going to be seen by a doctor because
[3:50:06.120 --> 3:50:10.360]  i'm a doctor in the building if you go to Planned Parenthood for health care you know i want to
[3:50:10.360 --> 3:50:14.680]  make sure that women are getting the best care here in the state of texas alone there are only
[3:50:14.680 --> 3:50:21.960]  35 Planned Parenthood clinics there are almost 5 000 providers for the texas women's health program
[3:50:21.960 --> 3:50:27.080]  where women can go to receive health care at no cost i mean we really don't need Planned Parenthood
[3:50:27.080 --> 3:50:32.120]  in the state of texas i mean we have said that over and over again our our legislators have proven
[3:50:32.120 --> 3:50:37.080]  it we do not need these clinics in our state stay with us when we come back we're talking
[3:50:37.080 --> 3:50:41.400]  about uh Planned Parenthood and government subsidies and of course it's not just federal
[3:50:41.400 --> 3:50:45.880]  subsidies even state subsidies it's also local subsidies and we'll talk about a good example
[3:50:45.880 --> 3:50:54.760]  that when we come back we're talking to abbey johnson a Planned Parenthood whistleblower we'll you right back

[3:54:53.160 --> 3:54:57.160]  efforts to try to limit funding and of course it's been done at the state level here in Texas
[3:54:58.200 --> 3:55:03.320]  there's also heavy subsidies at the local level I think people aren't aware of Austin is a very
[3:55:03.320 --> 3:55:07.640]  good example tell us what's going on here in Austin with local subsidy of Planned Parenthood
[3:55:07.640 --> 3:55:13.080]  yeah Austin is you know they have before they've they funded Planned Parenthood locally before
[3:55:13.080 --> 3:55:17.320]  and then they then they stop now they're back to doing it and another thing I think people don't
[3:55:17.320 --> 3:55:25.880]  realize is there's a building downtown in Austin the rent for a building like this for the square
[3:55:25.880 --> 3:55:32.440]  footage would probably go for you know I don't know maybe four to five thousand a month the city of
[3:55:32.440 --> 3:55:39.000]  Austin for years for at least 20 30 years has been renting that building to Planned Parenthood
[3:55:39.000 --> 3:55:48.440]  for a dollar a year I mean that's a huge subsidy yeah absolutely and then you know part of our
[3:55:48.440 --> 3:55:53.400]  local taxes they want that to go to Planned Parenthood and you know I mean I have to say I
[3:55:53.400 --> 3:55:59.240]  remember when we were moving to this area and we were looking at you know where where we wanted to
[3:55:59.240 --> 3:56:05.640]  buy a house one of the things that we looked at was you know is the local government there giving
[3:56:05.640 --> 3:56:10.200]  subsidies to Planned Parenthood at that time when we moved here Travis County was the city of Austin
[3:56:10.200 --> 3:56:17.080]  was and so we we ended up moving intentionally moved more north into Williamson County because
[3:56:17.080 --> 3:56:22.680]  we didn't want any of our money going to to Planned Parenthood at the local level and I think people
[3:56:22.680 --> 3:56:26.360]  need to pay attention to that people need to start paying attention to that where is your local
[3:56:26.360 --> 3:56:32.120]  money going is it going to fund things like the abortion industry and here in Austin it is I think
[3:56:32.120 --> 3:56:36.120]  most people wouldn't even think to look for that yeah you know how the system works because you
[3:56:36.120 --> 3:56:41.160]  worked at a Planned Parenthood most people wouldn't even imagine that they're getting a several
[3:56:41.160 --> 3:56:46.840]  thousand square foot facility for a dollar a year and Austin that is absolutely amazing and that
[3:56:46.840 --> 3:56:52.840]  shows just how much how politically correct connected they are that people would give them
[3:56:52.840 --> 3:56:58.280]  this kind of subsidy and I think a lot of people even people that might support abortion many
[3:56:58.280 --> 3:57:03.560]  libertarians would look at this and say wait a minute why are we giving these people that much
[3:57:03.560 --> 3:57:08.840]  of a subsidy right for their business I mean the same type of thing we look at with sports stadiums
[3:57:08.840 --> 3:57:13.080]  where you got these multi-billionaires come in with their sports team and you build a a billion
[3:57:13.080 --> 3:57:17.880]  dollar stadium for them I mean we see this kind of crony capitalism at every level and certainly
[3:57:17.880 --> 3:57:21.720]  it's there with Planned Parenthood I think a lot of people need to look at that at the local level
[3:57:21.720 --> 3:57:26.760]  so we're going to be talking tonight on the nightly news Leanne McAdoo is going to be talking about
[3:57:26.760 --> 3:57:33.240]  the Texas raids of a Planned Parenthood there's also going to be an extended version of Alex
[3:57:33.240 --> 3:57:39.720]  Storming Google that's don't miss that video because it's absolutely priceless to see the
[3:57:39.720 --> 3:57:44.920]  expression on people's faces when you put a camera and a microphone in their face even the guy who
[3:57:44.920 --> 3:57:50.600]  has a laptop in front of him with a camera and a microphone he doesn't think about it until Alex
[3:57:50.600 --> 3:57:57.000]  does that that is essentially what is happening to all of us we're all being recorded all the time
[3:57:57.000 --> 3:58:02.200]  by Google and that information now with the passage of CISA is going to be turned over to the
[3:58:02.200 --> 3:58:06.920]  government as the government wishes that's what you need to be afraid of thank you so much for
