[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.000 --> 00:18.000]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.000 --> 00:36.000]  The front lines of the information war is Alex Jones.
[00:48.000 --> 00:57.000]  America is already suffering a food shortage, which can be felt by rising costs and emptying shelves at the grocery store.
[00:57.000 --> 01:05.000]  But this is a cakewalk. It's going to get much worse. The writing, as they say, is on the wall.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  Any reasonable person can see that this is all being done deliberately.
[01:10.000 --> 01:26.000]  Over 10,000 cattle just died, and we are told that it was due to 100 degree weather. And in just the past 17 months, nearly 100 disasters have mysteriously befallen the American food industry.
[01:26.000 --> 01:36.000]  Dozens of catastrophic fires burning down food processing plants, in multiple cases, caused by small aircraft crashing into them.
[01:36.000 --> 01:45.000]  Thousands of tons of meat destroyed. Over 2 million turkeys have been destroyed. Over 40 million chickens have been destroyed.
[01:45.000 --> 01:54.000]  And with the rising cost of fuel, farmers are unable to harvest their crops. And it's only just beginning.
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.000]  Remember, Joe Biden promised he would shut down oil and gas.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  I have one final question. Would he close down the oil industry? Would you close down the oil industry?
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  I would transition from the oil industry, yes. I would transition. It is a big statement.
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  Why would you do that?
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  Because the oil industry pollutes significantly. Here's the deal.
[02:19.000 --> 02:27.000]  If you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time.
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.000]  Because basically what he is saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry.
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  Will you remember that, Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma?
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  Vice President Biden, let me give you 10 seconds to respond, and then I have to get to the final question.
[02:40.000 --> 02:41.000]  Vice President Biden.
[02:41.000 --> 02:49.000]  He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions.
[02:49.000 --> 02:57.000]  But, kiddo, I want you to just take a look, okay? You don't have to agree, but I want you to look at my eyes.
[02:57.000 --> 03:05.000]  I guarantee, I guarantee, we're going to end fossil fuel and I am not going to clock it.
[03:05.000 --> 03:12.000]  And they are making good with their radical promise, except there is no alternative energy plan.
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  The Biden administration is doing everything they can to shut down all fossil fuel in this country.
[03:19.000 --> 03:28.000]  And not only will that stop people from driving, all public transportation, all shipping, and all industry will come to a halt.
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  Millions will lose their jobs, and hundreds of millions will starve to death.
[03:34.000 --> 03:43.000]  Whether you like it or not, civilization is dependent upon oil and gas, and our government is turning it all off.
[03:43.000 --> 03:52.000]  We are also still suffering a baby formula shortage, and what little we do have is being sent to the open southern border
[03:52.000 --> 04:02.000]  for the tens of thousands of hungry foreigners being brought in unchecked and flown to already struggling cities across America.
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  After several countries suspended the Moderna vaccine for adults due to safety concerns,
[04:08.000 --> 04:16.000]  the United States FDA just unanimously voted to inject your infant children with the deadly shot.
[04:16.000 --> 04:26.000]  Your government is trying to kill you, and if anyone thinks this is hyperbole or fear-mongering, they are not paying attention, or they are in shock.
[04:26.000 --> 04:36.000]  The only solution we are being offered is to vote, even though we have a rigged election system and two parties that work for the same corporate establishment.
[04:36.000 --> 04:43.000]  Starvation is coming fast, and people can only survive a few weeks without food.
[04:43.000 --> 04:52.000]  And so what exactly will we do if the so-called red wave this November fails to turn the tide?
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.000]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  It's now out in the open.
[05:26.000 --> 05:32.000]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group.
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.000]  So now the fight's out in the open, they're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[05:38.000 --> 05:39.000]  We're going to win this thing.
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support,
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.000]  because without you InfoWars would not be here.
[05:48.000 --> 05:55.000]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the InfoWars, and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[05:55.000 --> 06:20.000]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done, and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[06:20.000 --> 06:26.000]  The numbers tell us that the vaccines have already caused a 20% increase in deaths.
[06:26.000 --> 06:35.000]  Now we have a run rate of about 20% excess mortality that's confirmed by the CDC numbers, the funeral home numbers, and the insurance company numbers.
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  And then somebody did an independent study I saw recently suggesting 20% is the number.
[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  So we're running a 20% excess deaths.
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  And a 10% increase in disabilities.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  This is a stunning number.
[06:46.000 --> 06:53.000]  You're telling me that things have been flat for five years at 29 million, and all of a sudden out of the data they got 3 million people are disabled out of nowhere?
[06:53.000 --> 06:58.000]  And now we are beginning to understand that this is just the beginning.
[06:58.000 --> 07:01.000]  Things are going to get much, much worse.
[07:01.000 --> 07:12.000]  Many of us have already seen the mysterious objects found in the vials of COVID vaccines by two separate independent groups using electron microscopy.
[07:12.000 --> 07:24.000]  We are also familiar with the rising number of strokes, heart attacks, and other side effects experienced worldwide after the biggest experimental vaccination in history.
[07:24.000 --> 07:29.000]  And now we are getting a first glimpse of what is causing all this.
[07:29.000 --> 07:35.000]  Something in the COVID vaccines seems to be growing within the recipient's vascular system.
[07:35.000 --> 07:42.000]  Anomalous objects are being discovered in the dead bodies of the vaccinated by embalmers and coroners.
[07:42.000 --> 07:47.000]  Horrific things being grown inside the veins and arteries.
[07:47.000 --> 08:01.000]  These are not blood clots, and they appear to be some sort of organic material with small crystals and extremely thin wires made up of what looks like reptilian scales.
[08:01.000 --> 08:10.000]  This internal blockage growing within the vaccinated would certainly explain all of the deadly side effects we are seeing today.
[08:10.000 --> 08:17.000]  What the mainstream media is currently spinning as sudden adult death syndrome.
[08:17.000 --> 08:24.000]  We do not know what these things are, but they are being found by embalmers and coroners everywhere.
[08:24.000 --> 08:31.000]  Except, pretty much all of them are too afraid to speak out, or they don't care.
[08:31.000 --> 08:37.000]  Only one has shown the courage to speak out so far, and this is the real tragedy.
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.000]  For those who remain silent, things will not get better.
[08:41.000 --> 08:51.000]  The FDA is poised to authorize these deadly vaccines to children as young as six months old, and humanity does nothing.
[08:51.000 --> 08:57.000]  Today, we want to provide an update on a topic that I know many parents and grandparents are focused on.
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  The potential for the first COVID-19 vaccines for kids under five.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  We have waited a long time for this moment.
[09:06.000 --> 09:07.000]  Well guys, here's some good news.
[09:07.000 --> 09:15.000]  The Biden administration has finally announced a vaccine rollout plan for children under five, and they've ordered 10 million doses.
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.000]  That's great.
[09:16.000 --> 09:23.000]  Right now, kids are like, oh my gosh, we could finally meet up for drinks.
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  Yep, as we speak, everyone in the lollipop industry is like, we're buying a yacht, here we go!
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  You get a lollipop, you get one.
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  It's very exciting to hear a four-year-old scream.
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  Facebook told me Bill Gates controls the vaccines.
[09:37.000 --> 09:44.000]  Why should we deserve anything other than pain and suffering if we do nothing to protect our own children?
[09:44.000 --> 09:52.000]  Once those afraid of speaking out begin seeing their coroner tables filled with dead children, it will be too late.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  But it's not too late now.
[09:54.000 --> 10:05.000]  If you are an embalmer, a coroner, or a funeral director, and you are seeing these things, there is still time to save the lives of our innocent children.
[10:05.000 --> 10:12.000]  You can start now by contacting Dr. Jane Ruby at protonmail.com.
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  Happy Juneteenth. We appreciate that here in Texas.
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  Let's just talk about the black community for a little while.
[10:37.000 --> 10:45.000]  The black community was thriving in 1964.
[10:45.000 --> 10:50.000]  They had a lot of problems. They were starting to be shipped off to Vietnam.
[10:50.000 --> 10:56.000]  There was a lot of racism. Police would beat them sometimes. Some police wouldn't.
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  A lot of problems went on.
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  Happy Juneteenth. We appreciate that here in Texas.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  You ought to thank the Republican president. You ought to thank him.
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.000]  You ought to thank God that at least somebody was half not evil and did what it took.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  And the evil Democrats tried to keep this place from being free.
[11:16.000 --> 11:23.000]  They tried to keep the little black kids out of school in the 60s here in Texas and Alabama and Arkansas and all over.
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.000]  Yes, they're the party of slavery. They've just put blacks now on the plantation of welfare and pretty much forced them to do it.
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  Don't let me get sidetracked.
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  What did they do to the African Americans?
[11:37.000 --> 11:44.000]  The Democrats, LBJ, and I'm here in the heart of LBJ country, the heart of his corruption and evil.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  And he was evil. Very horrible man.
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  What did they do to the blacks?
[11:50.000 --> 11:56.000]  Well, in 1964, and I like a lot of reforms giving equal rights, but we didn't have to put them on plantations,
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  which we've done now, and inner cities falling apart with not letting them have men in the houses, excuse me.
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  Trying to destroy their culture is what we've done.
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  Only 22 to 23% of blacks were dependent on any form of government.
[12:10.000 --> 12:16.000]  That means things they had like pseudo food stamps in 64, some forms of welfare,
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  things that were, you know, soup lines and things government pushed.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  That's wonderful. I'm ready to pay for that.
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.000]  For whites and blacks and Hispanics or Asians, I don't care.
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  In 1997, 91%, this is the government's own numbers,
[12:32.000 --> 12:40.000]  91% of the African American community at one time or another gets one form of government assistance.
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  I mean, serious government assistance.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  And with the whites, it's around 45% now.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  So we're, they're getting us on the plantation too.
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  They don't look at it as a racial thing. They just see who it's more easier to corner and manipulate and attack.
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  And they've attacked the black community, pumped drugs into those communities and allowed drugs to be sold in those communities.
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  It's just a fact. But anyways, excuse me.
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  So understand that's the love.
[13:05.000 --> 13:12.000]  Crime has gone up over 3,000% in the black community since the mid 60s and almost that and all other communities.
[13:12.000 --> 13:19.000]  Drug abuse, abortion, abortion skyrocketed at the same time illegitimacy has.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  They're having lots of abortions and they're also having lots of kids.
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  I'm fine. I think it's fine to have kids. I think it's terrible for them to have all those abortions.
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  I'm not a racist. I think African Americans should be able to have children.
[13:30.000 --> 13:36.000]  I just think they ought to be raised in schools where they're taught things and taught about how to be successful rather than taught by Jesse Jackson
[13:36.000 --> 13:43.000]  and people how to hate others and how to be losers and be part of the government surf system.
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  Okay?
[13:45.000 --> 13:54.000]  That's what we're talking about. Government-sponsored racism and the media, the bureaus of propaganda, joining in on the racism,
[13:54.000 --> 14:02.000]  trying to get whites hating blacks, blacks hating whites, Hispanics hating blacks and whites, and whites and blacks hating Hispanics.
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  We're all human beings, friends. We got the same blood in our veins.
[14:07.000 --> 14:16.000]  My genetics are the same as yours. Different pigment in my skin, different eye color, different hair.
[14:16.000 --> 14:23.000]  But they want to make us fixate on culture, not so we have a care of our culture.
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  No, black culture is being destroyed.
[14:27.000 --> 14:36.000]  It's being torn out, and bureaucrats are replacing fathers and mothers, and that's the dream of the people that push big government.
[14:36.000 --> 14:45.000]  My dad grew up in a relatively small town, and his dad was, you know, a farmer and rancher, pretty successful.
[14:45.000 --> 14:53.000]  He said black community was thriving then. Own the cleaners, own the bunch of stuff, and there was black families with thousands of acres.
[14:53.000 --> 15:01.000]  You go there now, it ain't there. Because they come in, they destroyed all the black businesses, those thriving communities.
[15:01.000 --> 15:09.000]  They did that by taking incentive away, by destroying most of the average black people that used to buy things in those towns, and getting them all on food stamps.
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  How did that, and whites were on food stamps too, by the way, and the government's getting us on them more and more every day.
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.000]  What did the government do to the blacks when slavery ended?
[15:19.000 --> 15:26.000]  They put them on a new thing, indentured sharecroppers, and they had to go to the company store and buy all their food there, and they didn't even get normal money,
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  and the guy would write them little vouchers on pieces of paper.
[15:28.000 --> 15:36.000]  Same thing, blacks are on this, and whites and Hispanics are on these big things now, but they really targeted the blacks horribly.
[15:36.000 --> 15:43.000]  They get them in there, they say no men in the house, just like in slave times, the men weren't allowed to marry the women, because they didn't want leadership.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  A man takes command, they wouldn't have put up with it.
[15:46.000 --> 15:53.000]  You know, the black man wouldn't have put up with his family getting beat, so they kept the men in one area and the women in another area with the kids.
[15:53.000 --> 16:17.000]  And that still goes in our culture today, and that's what they want, they want to keep the black man out in a way.
[16:24.000 --> 16:31.000]  The immune support formula is incredible by itself.
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  These other three together, it is amazing, 60% off.
[16:34.000 --> 16:45.000]  Then the trapezec to immune support, 50% off on immune support, X2 and D3 gummies, and then 40% off on X2, now back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[16:45.000 --> 16:54.000]  Now, just the X2 alone is the missing link with most people, highest quality deep breath crystal iodine, beyond critical for your immune system and your whole body.
[16:54.000 --> 16:59.000]  It's 40% off back in stock, but get four of the products together for 60% off.
[16:59.000 --> 17:13.000]  The National Dissues is a new film, 2000 Mules, is the most important documentary in modern times, because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election and how they're planning to steal future elections and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[17:13.000 --> 17:26.000]  Now, it's great that it's online, it's great that millions watch online, but you need to have the high quality HD DVD in your library with the expanded extras so it can't be censored in the future and so you can show it to everyone you know.

[17:45.000 --> 17:55.000]  Get them separate, get them together, massively discounted at infowarstore.com, but everyone needs to have 2000 Mules in their library so the globalists can't censor it.
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.000]  Infowarstore.com to get 2000 Mules today.
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.000]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[18:07.000 --> 18:16.000]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[18:16.000 --> 18:33.000]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses and joints and the digestive system.
[18:33.000 --> 18:44.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[18:44.000 --> 18:53.000]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[18:53.000 --> 19:03.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[19:24.000 --> 19:34.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best selling product, knockout, with down and out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[19:34.000 --> 19:39.000]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[19:39.000 --> 19:49.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[19:49.000 --> 19:55.000]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.
[19:55.000 --> 20:20.000]  Selling it out now at infowarstore.com.
[20:20.000 --> 20:26.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. This is the Alex Jones show. I am your host, Harrison Smith. I'll just be sitting in for a few minutes.
[20:26.000 --> 20:35.000]  Alex is on his way. The return of Alex Jones is imminent, so fear not. He will be here very, very soon.
[20:35.000 --> 20:41.000]  But I'm sitting in for a few minutes in the meantime. I, of course, am the host of American Journal, the morning show here at InfoWars.
[20:41.000 --> 20:50.000]  And, boy, if you didn't watch American Journal this morning, you missed out because it's our call-in show. We spend at least half the show taking calls every episode.
[20:50.000 --> 20:58.000]  And some of the callers today were just incredible. And it really is great to just be able to interact with the audience.
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.000]  But in case you missed it, you might want to go back and check it out.
[21:01.000 --> 21:13.000]  We had one caller named David from California who was actually a transgender individual and talked about undergoing procedures at age 20 that he really regrets
[21:13.000 --> 21:19.000]  and has had something like nine open heart surgeries because of the side effects of the Lupron and some of the other.
[21:19.000 --> 21:27.000]  I'm not sure if that was the one he was on, but the really intense drugs that they put you on to change your gender have horrific side effects.
[21:27.000 --> 21:42.000]  And he was calling in to sort of make the connection between the heart damage that the vaccine has been shown to do and the heart damage that the transgender, you know, the affirmation drugs can do.
[21:42.000 --> 21:48.000]  And sort of saying, you know, why are they, why do they seem so desperate to promote things that destroy your heart and what could be behind that?
[21:48.000 --> 21:58.000]  And we did a little talking about, you know, what it was like for him to be transgender and to sort of be, well, as he put it, he said, you know, I believe the lies.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  And I fell for it and he regretted it.
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  And he has trouble walking now because of some issues in his legs from the transgender stuff.
[22:05.000 --> 22:17.000]  But it was a very interesting call, a very informative call and some very interesting connections being made between the vaccine and these weird chemicals they're trying to give to children.
[22:17.000 --> 22:24.000]  And we had another caller named Tony from Denver who was talking about iodine and milk supply.
[22:24.000 --> 22:38.000]  She's had five kids in five years and she's 25 years old and was talking about how iodine was crucial in helping her breastfeed her children and how much more important that is now, especially if you can't rely on baby formula.
[22:38.000 --> 22:55.000]  But she also told a hilarious story about her husband being at a supermarket and making a joke about Michelle Obama actually being a man and the high school cashier person heard him say it and was sort of like, wait, what are you talking about?
[22:55.000 --> 23:06.000]  And so the guy started pulling up some Alex Jones videos and some Info Wars articles going, yeah, you know, Michelle Obama, she might not be, she might be the first lady after all, she might be something else.
[23:06.000 --> 23:15.000]  So then this kid gets intrigued, he starts looking into it, he realizes there's some validity to this, he ends up writing a paper for his school about it.
[23:15.000 --> 23:22.000]  The teacher refuses to grade him, gives him a failing grade because she says it's fake news, it's fake news, it's not true, you can't do it.
[23:22.000 --> 23:26.000]  And apparently this is what Tony from Denver told us this morning when she called in.
[23:26.000 --> 23:39.000]  They ended up taking it to court and the teacher got fired and lost their teaching license because of their behavior in this case about Michelle Obama's gender, her particular gender.
[23:39.000 --> 23:51.000]  So it was just a crazy story, you'll have to go back to this morning's episode to hear her tell it, but we're hoping the kid, the actual kid that wrote the story and was in the court case calls in so we can get the full details on that.
[23:51.000 --> 23:59.000]  And of course we had a caller who wanted to show off his info wagon, info war, his car completely decked out an info war sticker, awesome stuff.
[23:59.000 --> 24:04.000]  But we always hear great callers, we always get great insight from the info warriors out there.
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.000]  And today was particularly interesting and informative.
[24:08.000 --> 24:20.000]  But of course we spent a lot of time talking about the incredible news and headlines over this weekend, of which there is just an insane amount and good news, I guess, for everybody that hates children.
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.000]  This vaccine is now available for children.
[24:23.000 --> 24:39.000]  And it was approved unanimously by the FDA 21 to zero 21 people zero, you know, outliers in this, approving this COVID vaccine for zero to four year olds.
[24:39.000 --> 24:58.000]  Before they have made one complete circuit around the sun, children may be injected with this experimental gene altering spike protein creating death shot, which is just incredible because America is not only the only country in the world that now authorizes COVID shots for
[24:58.000 --> 25:09.000]  infants, but most other countries don't even allow him for the for adults. FDA advisors just voted 21 to zero to authorize Moderna's vaccine for children six months old to five years old.
[25:09.000 --> 25:17.000]  Germany, France, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland have all suspended the Moderna vaccine for people under 30 due to safety concerns.
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  But the US will now be giving this product to infants.
[25:20.000 --> 25:27.000]  It is absolutely wild how this is taking place and how they're, I guess, getting away with it.
[25:27.000 --> 25:43.000]  I mean, I guess they're just relying on the willful ignorance of the American people who slavishly adhere to the dictates of their of the authorities without doing even a modicum of research, you know, outside of that just whatever, whatever, you know, God says they do.
[25:43.000 --> 25:53.000]  And in their case, you know, their God is this, you know, scientific, technocratic, hellish authoritarian despotism that we're under right now.
[25:53.000 --> 26:03.000]  But some other news that came out this weekend, sort of ironically coincidentally at the same time that they're allowing little baby children to take this shot.
[26:03.000 --> 26:11.000]  We also learned that the COVID-19 vaccination temporarily impairs semen concentration and total motile count among semen donors.
[26:11.000 --> 26:24.000]  So they showed that, you know, the ability for people to reproduce may have been reduced by 15.4%. That's the sperm concentration decrease.
[26:24.000 --> 26:30.000]  And the motile count decreased 22.1%, so nearly a fifth down.
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  So in case you were wondering, yes, it's basically confirmed now.
[26:35.000 --> 26:45.000]  If it's not on purpose, then there's just coincidentally and accidentally and serendipitously depopulation effects of this vaccine.
[26:45.000 --> 26:51.000]  It's just as horrific as you can possibly imagine.
[26:51.000 --> 27:08.000]  Story from heartgroup.org, FDA unanimously approves COVID vaccine for zero to four year olds. The FDA met on the 15th of June and despite all of the evidence of non-efficacy from the infant Pfizer vaccine and still total lack of data on long term harms, they voted to go ahead.
[27:08.000 --> 27:21.000]  And the last 18 months or anything to go by the MHRA will soon follow, followed by a respectable few weeks by the JCVI. Indeed, vaccines for this age group is already listed for JCVI discussion before the UK regulators make any decision.
[27:21.000 --> 27:29.000]  They would do well to read a detailed letter to the FDA from Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who says it was depressing that the FDA meeting.
[27:29.000 --> 27:38.000]  None of the members pointed out that two months follow up is totally inadequate for assessing safety nor question the use of an antibody level as a measure of success.
[27:38.000 --> 27:45.000]  No specific level of antibody exists, which provides protection against COVID. So how can this be used as a useful measure for young children?
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.000]  Much of their reduced risk from COVID arises from their superior innate immunity.
[27:49.000 --> 27:59.000]  And in the presentation of the FDA, Pfizer presented evidence that only antibodies produced in the children were the Wuhan spike with no detectable antibodies to the Omicron spike.
[27:59.000 --> 28:04.000]  So doesn't help, doesn't stop you from getting COVID. And in fact, we'll show you on the other side here.
[28:04.000 --> 28:15.000]  We'll pull in the video during the break, but the Will Linsky, the CDC head, when she announced that vaccines were now available for children, she didn't even make the claim that it would stop them from getting COVID.
[28:15.000 --> 28:22.000]  It's acknowledged now and really undeniable. It does not stop you from getting COVID. It does not stop you from spreading COVID.
[28:22.000 --> 28:38.000]  Of course, we've known this since very, very early on, but it's worth it to reiterate, especially when the head of the CDC, in her celebration of being able to inject this into little baby children now, doesn't even make the claim that it can stop you from getting the virus.
[28:38.000 --> 28:45.000]  No, the claim she makes is that it will stop you from getting the severe virus or from being hospitalized or from dying from the virus.
[28:45.000 --> 28:52.000]  But of course, we know that's not true. At least we know it's not true. In the case of adults, you're more likely to get severe COVID if you've gotten the vaccine.
[28:52.000 --> 29:09.000]  That was the latest from the study last week, but we'll show you the videos on the other side where they're pushing it to kids. Stay tuned.
[29:22.000 --> 29:28.000]  God helps those who help themselves. We have a lot of amazing products on sale right now at infowarstore.com.

[32:25.000 --> 32:32.000]  So, don't you get the big secret? You've never seen fish oil look like that? No, you've never seen that, have you?
[32:32.000 --> 32:42.000]  And this little jewel right here is solid, liquid consciousness.
[32:42.000 --> 32:50.000]  Look it up. Find out how even the FDA and the government admit that fish oil is incredible.
[32:50.000 --> 32:55.000]  The only thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[32:55.000 --> 32:59.000]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in 4store.com.
[32:59.000 --> 33:09.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:09.000 --> 33:29.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, the empire is on the run. The rebellion is growing stronger and boy, things are changing.
[33:29.000 --> 33:42.000]  We'll talk about that in just a second, the way that some of the old school blue blood Republicans are running headlong into the bulwark of the new conservatives, the new Republican Party.
[33:42.000 --> 33:55.000]  People that are not satisfied with merely losing graciously but actually want to win and push back and regain some semblance of common sense in this country, in our country.
[33:55.000 --> 34:17.000]  We'll talk about that in just a second, but we're talking about the fact that the FDA has now over this weekend unanimously approved COVID vaccine for children 0 to 4 years of age and complete contradiction to any other country, any other reasonable proceedings.
[34:17.000 --> 34:35.000]  I mean, you get the kids don't really get severe COVID, right? As a kid, you're not very likely to get COVID at all. If you do get it, it's not very likely to be severe and hardly any children have died from it across the entire country.
[34:35.000 --> 34:59.000]  It doesn't matter, apparently, they're going to start injecting kids with this horrific gene altering poison that they call a vaccine. Of course, they had to change the definition in order to call it a vaccine, but they don't let little things like the definition of words or truth or reality get in the way of their mad desperate drive towards depopulation and total control.
[34:59.000 --> 35:15.000]  And the kids are just the next step, in this case, stepping like a giant, stepping, crushing everyone underneath them. Well, now the children are in the shadow of that falling foot and they will soon be crushed like the rest of us.
[35:15.000 --> 35:31.000]  And they're excited to announce this. Let's go to the CDC announcement for vaccines under five and let's listen, let's pay attention and tell me if you hear any claims that she makes. She doesn't claim that they won't get COVID. She doesn't claim that they won't spread COVID.
[35:31.000 --> 35:41.000]  Now she only makes one claim here and it's a tenuous and dishonest one. So here she is, Rachel Wolinski, CDC.
[35:41.000 --> 35:46.000]  I know many parents with very young children have been anticipating this day.
[35:46.000 --> 35:56.000]  We now know based on rigorous scientific review that the vaccines available here in the United States can be used safely and effectively in children under five.
[35:56.000 --> 36:04.000]  Vaccinating young children is a critical opportunity to protect them against hospitalization and death from COVID-19.
[36:04.000 --> 36:10.000]  Parents, I strongly encourage you to get your children vaccinated.
[36:10.000 --> 36:25.000]  So I don't know, you can either go with her, the head of the CDC and all of her, you know, righteous power or just, you know, info wars, the outlet that's been right about everything the entire time.
[36:25.000 --> 36:39.000]  But notice she didn't say protect your child from COVID. Stop your child from getting COVID. No, she said stop your child from severe COVID and hospitalization and death from COVID.
[36:39.000 --> 36:50.000]  It's somewhat ironic, however, because we did cover the story last week that showed that severe COVID in this particular and very wide ranging study did not occur in the unvaccinated.
[36:50.000 --> 37:01.000]  It only occurred in the vaccinated. So that was their last, like I said, tenuous, their last thread they were clinging onto to try to justify why this vaccine could possibly be a good idea.
[37:01.000 --> 37:11.000]  And of course, it was largely non-fossifiable, right? You can't have it both ways. So that's why you had people saying, well, I've got COVID, but it would have been worse if I didn't get the vaccine.
[37:11.000 --> 37:21.000]  Well, you can't know that. It's impossible to know. It's impossible to falsify. You can't have the same person with the same infection in two different forms, vaccinated and unvaccinated.
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  It doesn't work. So they just made this assertion and you couldn't really prove them wrong.
[37:25.000 --> 37:33.000]  But they went through and they looked at a whole bunch of data, hundreds of thousands of people, and they actually found that severe COVID didn't happen in unvaccinated people.
[37:33.000 --> 37:41.000]  It only happened in vaccinated people. So that was the severing of that last thread of justification for the COVID vaccine.
[37:41.000 --> 37:52.000]  But again, that didn't stop them. Now they're pushing it on children. But she made another claim there. She used another term that I'd like to drill down on, and that was the rigorous testing.
[37:52.000 --> 37:59.000]  Oh, rigorous, was it? Was it rigorous? Maybe this is another word that they've changed the definition for. I don't know.
[37:59.000 --> 38:20.000]  Because the Hart Organization, H-A-R-T, came out with this video about the method by which these vaccines were tested and the absolute failure for these tests to adhere to any sort of scientific discipline or principles or legitimacy.
[38:20.000 --> 38:27.000]  So let's hear now how these tests went when they were testing the vaccine to see if it could be injected in little children.
[38:27.000 --> 38:37.000]  They got 4,500 kids together to test on. That's a pretty big sample size. Let's see how it worked out. Here's a doctor from the Hart Foundation to tell us.
[38:37.000 --> 38:50.000]  I'm Dr Claire Craig. I'm a diagnostic pathologist and I am co-chair of the Hart Group. And I wanted to take you through the evidence that Pfizer just presented to the FDA on the six months to four year old children.
[38:50.000 --> 38:55.000]  There's an awful lot about this trial that has shocked me and I think will shock you too.
[38:55.000 --> 39:12.000]  The trial recruited 4,526 children aged from six months to four years old. 3,000 of these children did not make it to the end of the trial. That is a huge number. Two thirds of them. Why was there this drop off?
[39:12.000 --> 39:18.000]  That needs to be answered. And without an answer to that, on that basis alone, this trial should be deemed null and void.
[39:18.000 --> 39:28.000]  So what did the trial show? Well, they defined severe COVID as children who had a slightly raised heart rate or a few more breaths per minute.
[39:28.000 --> 39:36.000]  There were six children aged two to four who had severe COVID in the vaccine group, but only one in the placebo group.
[39:36.000 --> 39:50.000]  So on that basis, the likelihood that this vaccine is actually causing severe COVID is higher than the likelihood that it is. There was actually one child who was hospitalized in this trial. They had a fever and a seizure.
[39:50.000 --> 40:00.000]  They had been vaccinated. So now let's turn to what they defined as any COVID. And what they did was to utterly twist the data.
[40:00.000 --> 40:06.000]  They vaccinated the children and they waited three weeks after the first dose before the second dose.
[40:06.000 --> 40:22.000]  In that three week period, 34 of the vaccinated children got COVID and only 13 in the placebo group, which worked out as a 30% increased chance of catching COVID in that three week period if you were vaccinated.
[40:22.000 --> 40:33.000]  So they ignored that data. And then there was an eight week gap between the second dose and the third dose, where again, children were getting plenty of COVID in the vaccine arm. So they ignored that data.
[40:33.000 --> 40:43.000]  There was then seven weeks after the third dose, which they also ignored, which meant that in the end they had ignored 97% of the COVID that occurred during the trial.
[40:43.000 --> 40:53.000]  And they just looked at tiny numbers, so tiny. In the end, they were comparing three children in the vaccine arm who had COVID with seven in the placebo arm.
[40:53.000 --> 40:58.000]  And they said that this showed the vaccine was effective.
[40:58.000 --> 41:14.000]  That was the rigorous testing that it went through. Totally insane that it actually went forward. But of course, what you just heard and the description of the way that this test was carried out is not very different than the original tests for the vaccines for adults.
[41:14.000 --> 41:30.000]  And you can go back and see the way that these tests were carried out to recognize once again, they were more or less completely, if not falsified, very bent in their interpretation of the information. And yet the FDA unanimously approves it.
[41:30.000 --> 41:52.000]  It really should make you start asking questions as to whose interests they have in mind. Is this the type of thing that your pediatric doctor would push on your child with these very, very strange testing procedures that are taking place?
[41:52.000 --> 42:04.000]  You really have to spread that video, get that out, and let people know that that is the type of testing that's done before they inject something into your child's arm.
[42:04.000 --> 42:11.000]  It's, in my opinion, criminal. Completely criminal in the way it's all come together.
[42:11.000 --> 42:33.000]  But of course, we've been on this for the entire time. We have been warning people about the inevitable consequences of all of these policies since it all began.

[47:11.000 --> 47:25.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. You're watching the Alex Jones show. I am your host, Harrison Smith. I host the American Journal.
[47:25.000 --> 47:35.000]  In mornings, each and every weekday morning, 8 to 11 a.m. Central Standard Time, Bandai Video, InfoWars.com. It's our call-in show and boy, do we get a lot of interesting callers.
[47:35.000 --> 47:45.000]  One of the things I was mentioning at the end of that last segment, you never know what iodine is going to do for you. I'm not making any claims here. I'm not a doctor. I'm not saying any of this or all of this will happen to you.
[47:45.000 --> 47:54.000]  But in my own personal life, I've had friends and family have just the craziest experience with iodine. One friend said he started sleeping an hour less every night.
[47:54.000 --> 48:06.000]  Other friends say they have chronic pains or chronic conditions that clear up as soon as they start taking iodine. We had a caller this morning who said she ran out of iodine at one point because it was not in stock at the infowarsstore anymore.
[48:06.000 --> 48:18.000]  Her milk supply dried up and she wasn't able to breastfeed her children as well because she didn't have iodine. Apparently it was the lack of iodine that did that to her. That was her personal observation.
[48:18.000 --> 48:28.000]  What you do know is that you're not getting enough iodine. You know that it's been denuded from the soil. You're not getting the vitamins and minerals that you need.
[48:28.000 --> 48:37.000]  Even if you eat like a rabbit and eat nothing but salads all day, guess what? Those vegetables have been grown in soil that is completely depleted of its nutrients.
[48:37.000 --> 48:50.000]  You need to supplement no matter how healthily you eat. When you get survival shield X2, you never know what effect it's going to have. I can almost guarantee you that you're not getting enough iodine and you will notice the effects when you start taking it.
[48:50.000 --> 48:58.000]  It'll improve your life. You just really can't tell how it'll improve it until you get the survival shield X2. The bottle looks small and it is a small bottle.
[48:58.000 --> 49:10.000]  The serving size is like one or two drops. It's actually weeks worth of iodine supplementation with survival shield X2 even in that small bottle because you aren't taking a full eyedropper every time.
[49:10.000 --> 49:19.000]  That's too much. It's too strong. You just need a dropper too with a glass of water. That's all you need to get the iodine that you're not getting from the food that you eat.
[49:19.000 --> 49:32.000]  Again, with a call of this morning, I had some pretty great stories about how iodine has helped her in her life. Find out how it'll help you in your life. Go to infowarestore.com right now and get the iodine that your body needs.
[49:32.000 --> 49:48.000]  With that, let's talk about some other stuff. There's some interesting stories that I didn't get to cover this morning because they're just sort of interesting. It's a collection of stories that I actually found this weekend that I think all kind of go together.
[49:48.000 --> 50:02.000]  There's a tweet from the Twitter account, a new radical centrism that's showing the depression or stress index scores among white respondents. These are all white people, I guess, and you have very liberal on the left here.
[50:02.000 --> 50:18.000]  Somewhat closer to liberals than neither, than somewhat closer to conservatives or very conservative. You can see that one of these is not like the other as a new radical centrism points out.
[50:18.000 --> 50:37.000]  In other words, the very conservative, somewhat conservative, and neither all have a negative value in that they are less likely to be depressed or stressed, or to report themselves as depressed or stressed, whereas the very liberal side of things significantly higher.
[50:37.000 --> 50:50.000]  That's 0.43 compared to negative 0.25 for very conservative. In other words, for some reason, liberals are way, way more likely to be depressed. I think it's sort of a chicken in the egg sort of thing.
[50:50.000 --> 51:05.000]  I don't know if because you have a tendency to be depressed that you might be more liberal or that your liberal worldview is so warped and out of touch with reality that your brain rebels at your cognitive dissonance and causes you to feel repressed.
[51:05.000 --> 51:16.000]  I don't know. I don't know which one it is. I like the first response to this. Katie Faust on Twitter says, a worldview that is incompatible with reality can't help but produce stress and anxiety.
[51:16.000 --> 51:28.000]  In some response to that saying, oh, Kathy, that's the response, right? Oh, Kathy. It's like, well, is she wrong? But is she wrong, though? But what other reason would there be for all of this?
[51:28.000 --> 51:36.000]  Now, we know that Biden's approval is the lowest of his presidency and the lowest of any president ever, setting records in that way.
[51:36.000 --> 51:50.000]  But of course, it's low, not because people necessarily don't like him or the way that he comports himself or the way that, you know, he behaves, but it's more in terms of kind of like the chart that we showed a second ago.
[51:50.000 --> 52:03.000]  Everybody's depressed. Everybody's sad. Nobody can afford any things anymore. Everything is just getting tangibly worse, noticeably less comfortable, less nice.
[52:03.000 --> 52:10.000]  And my wife even noticed this yesterday. She said, you know, there's a lot of people I talked to these days that I would have never expected it.
[52:10.000 --> 52:20.000]  But oh, yeah, thank you, Atlantic. There's more to life than being happy. Okay, sorry. Okay, sorry. I thought maybe happiness was some sort of measure of success.
[52:20.000 --> 52:28.000]  But no, I'm learning that it's not. I'm learning that if I'm not happy, it's because there's a chemical imbalance in my brain and I need to be medicated, possibly forcibly.
[52:28.000 --> 52:40.000]  But certainly at the request or demand of Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum, who are telling me that I'll own nothing, have no privacy, and be happy. How do you think that works? Drugs.
[52:40.000 --> 52:47.000]  It's called drugs. Conservatives find life more meaningful than liberals, of course. But no, everything's getting worse.
[52:47.000 --> 52:53.000]  My wife even noticed, she said, people who you never would expect it, they're all talking about moving to the country these days.
[52:53.000 --> 53:01.000]  And it's almost like, it's almost like they won't admit why. They won't admit that everything's getting worse.
[53:01.000 --> 53:09.000]  They just, it's like asking a duck why he flies south for the winter. He doesn't know. He's not making a choice in this matter.
[53:09.000 --> 53:15.000]  He just, it's just what he feels like doing it this time. And honestly, I think like young people, you know, people around my age, 30 year olds,
[53:15.000 --> 53:22.000]  they're like, you know, I just think, I think I might want to go live in the country. I think maybe I'll, I think it'd be fun living a small town. I think it'd be really cool.
[53:22.000 --> 53:30.000]  And so I go, why is it because the policies that you vote for have destroyed the city that you live in and now you're scared and are running away from the chaos you've created?
[53:30.000 --> 53:35.000]  Is that what it is? Like, I don't think that, I don't think it's a conscious thing. I think it's just sort of instinctual.
[53:35.000 --> 53:45.000]  They're just like, you know, like a herd. The herd is moving out to the, to the country. And so all the herd animals just sort of go along with it.
[53:45.000 --> 53:51.000]  They don't really know why. But if they were to actually think about it, they would obviously recognize, well, everything is chaotic in the cities.
[53:51.000 --> 53:58.000]  And there's crime out of control. And there's homeless people doing drugs and, you know, having seizures in front of your preschool.
[53:58.000 --> 54:05.000]  And it's not nice or comfortable. And all of the benefits of the city are not worth the costs and the taxes.
[54:05.000 --> 54:09.000]  I mean, talk about costs. I mean, my God, you can't afford it anymore. So everybody's being forced out.
[54:09.000 --> 54:16.000]  It's sort of just white flight 2.0, right? White people used to live in the cities and they made the suburbs.
[54:16.000 --> 54:21.000]  Now the suburbs are being destroyed. So they're moving out. And I don't think it's a racial thing necessarily.
[54:21.000 --> 54:31.000]  I think it's a crime thing. I think it's a collapse thing. I think it's a drug thing and a criminality thing and a, you know, liberal government thing.
[54:31.000 --> 54:37.000]  That's happening. But everybody's noticing this because everything's getting worse because everything is more expensive because nothing works quite right.
[54:37.000 --> 54:45.000]  Because the government can't get its act together because it's not focusing on the right things because it's much more interested in, you know, what, I don't know,
[54:45.000 --> 54:51.000]  making lynching illegal than actually trying to stop the fentanyl flow across the border. It's just we're in a state of total collapse.
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.000]  And so, of course, this is being reflected in the presidential polls of people being unhappy.
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.000]  But another poll has found that half of Americans rank moral values in the country as poor.
[55:00.000 --> 55:12.000]  This story can be found at infoworse.com. A new Gallup poll has found that 50% of Americans rank moral values in their country currently as poor with only 13% saying that those values are good.
[55:12.000 --> 55:20.000]  37% rate moral values as fair, but only 1% rate them as excellent. Who is that 1%?
[55:20.000 --> 55:27.000]  Who is the 1% of Americans who watches the American news and goes, everything's going great.
[55:27.000 --> 55:33.000]  Our moral compass is right on target these days. Is it, though? Is it?
[55:33.000 --> 55:43.000]  Not at all. But of course, simultaneous with this, in corresponding to this, from the post-millennial, Americans' belief in God hits a new low.
[55:43.000 --> 55:51.000]  Religion is ubiquitous in the United States, but a new Gallup poll shows belief in God is declining, especially among the younger generation.
[55:51.000 --> 55:59.000]  Those who identify as left-wing show the sharpest decline. Yes, I think that sentence is kind of just, kind of true for everything.
[55:59.000 --> 56:14.000]  Those who identify as left-wing show the sharpest decline. In mental capacity, in happiness, in ability to run things, in safety, it's just, it's all in decline now for the leftists.
[56:14.000 --> 56:22.000]  Unfortunately, they're dragging us all down with them. However, for married conservatives, there's been essentially no change since the poll has last taken.
[56:22.000 --> 56:30.000]  Belief in God is relatively similar across race and gender. However, there are marked differences when it comes to age, political ideology, and party affiliation.
[56:30.000 --> 56:41.000]  Only 68% of people 18 through 29 said they believed in God, compared with 88% of those 50 to 64 and 87% of the 65-plus crowd.
[56:41.000 --> 56:52.000]  So the younger you skew your audience, the less religious they are, the less happy they are, the less in tune with reality and nature that they are.
[56:52.000 --> 57:00.000]  Because you have to understand that God is nature, and when you're out of whack with God, you're out of whack with nature.
[57:00.000 --> 57:11.000]  You're floating, disconnected from anything real, tangible, or legitimate, and you are trapped in a demon's dream.
[57:11.000 --> 57:17.000]  You're trapped in an illusion that has been crafted for you by people who despise you.
[57:17.000 --> 57:26.000]  So of course, you're going to be unhappy. Of course, it's going to all seem confusing and chaotic and out of control, because it is on purpose.
[57:26.000 --> 57:32.000]  Because belief in God, just like adherence to nature, makes you more difficult to control.
[57:32.000 --> 57:49.000]  So if they can destroy the family, destroy the God, and destroy your connection to other human beings in the natural world, then you are just a perfect mold for a new neo-feudal serf, a slave in the globalist system.
[57:49.000 --> 57:57.000]  The internet and talk radio are on fire, with the slogan, Alex Jones was right. People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[57:57.000 --> 58:07.000]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling, because I knew this was coming, I tried to stop it, and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever,
[58:07.000 --> 58:14.000]  because the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents. It's now out in the open.
[58:14.000 --> 58:20.000]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group.
[58:20.000 --> 58:27.000]  So now the fight's out in the open, they're making their move, because they know they're behind schedule.
[58:27.000 --> 58:30.000]  We're going to win this thing. God's watching the children counting on us.
[58:30.000 --> 58:37.000]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support, because without you, info wars would not be here.
[58:37.000 --> 58:44.000]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war, and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[58:44.000 --> 58:49.000]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done, and ask you now to redouble your efforts.

[59:49.000 --> 59:57.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, there's no doubt the American people are feeling the pinch, feeling the stress of this Biden administration.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  They tell you it's a transition. They tell you we're transitioning into a new world.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  This civilization, which is run on natural gas and coal and cheap energy, in the process of empowering the human,
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  empowering civilization, allowing the individual self-government and prosperity.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  That way up is over on this planet, and they say it's a transition, carbon neutral, carbon zero. That means you're gone, you're a carbon-based light form, you see a...
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  That's what it's all about. But even though they tell you that's going on, they also kind of have to deny it,
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  because then you'll blame them for all of the hardship and heartache and difficult times, not just ahead, but right now.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  And so Janet Yellen is lying here when she says inflation will come down and recession is not inevitable.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  So here's Janet Yellen lying to the American people on ABC News this weekend.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Madam Secretary, thanks for joining us this morning.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  You know, the Wall Street Journal reported this morning that 44% of economists expect a recession in the next year.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  Is that what you expect as well?
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  Pause it right there.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  Folks, we're in a recession. What do you mean next year? What is this game they're playing where they act like we're not already in a recession?
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  In fact, I actually say we're in a depression, is what I would say.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  But you can go look at the definitions and look at history and how what's reported a recession and a depression, and everybody can have the debate.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  The point is the economy is tanking.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  Americans are having a harder time financially.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  Whether you want to call it a recession or a depression or blame it on inflation or in Putin or whatever, that's the fact.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  And so Yellen has to go on TV and convince the people that, oh, it's not us. Oh, it's not happening.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  Remember, the other Biden advisor says, oh, people just don't know how good they've got it. People just don't know how great our policies are.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Yeah, you're tapping into your savings. You can't take a vacation this year. You can't afford to fill your gas tank.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  Your 401k is dipped. Your stocks are gone. Your crypto is gone.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  And then the Biden administration just said, hey, that's not happening. You're doing fantastic. What are you talking about? You're doing amazing.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  Our policies are working so great.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  So here Janet Yellen is about to tell you that there's no recession even though you're in a recession right now.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  Well, I expect the economy to slow. It's been growing at a very rapid rate as the economy, as the labor market is recovered and we have reached full employment.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  It's natural now that we expect a transition to steady and steady growth.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  There's that key word.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  But I don't think a recession is at all inevitable.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  Chair Powell clearly inflation is unacceptably high. It's President Biden's top priority to bring it down.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  And Chair Powell has said that his goal is to bring inflation down while maintaining a strong labor market.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  That's going to take skill and luck. But I believe it's possible. I don't think a recession is inevitable.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  So you're in a recession. You're already feeling it. And Biden administration officials like Gene Sperling and Janet Yellen go on national news over the weekend and tell you you're not in a recession.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  You're doing great. Of course, you know that's a lie. You're actually living your life. They're not. They don't even live in reality.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  But oh, they say Biden is trying to address inflation. That's not happening.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  Biden is trying to fix the recession. That's not happening. There's no inflation. There's no recession.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  But Biden is doing everything he can about inflation and recession. It's actually pretty simple. Really. Really simple.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  Turn on America's energy sector again. Cut taxes. Ease regulations. Bing. It all turns around overnight. Turn America's energy back on. Cut taxes. Ease regulations.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  And watch the U.S. economy soar. Oh, who did that? Donald Trump. But see, they can't do what Donald Trump did to make the economy successful because, well, then they would be making Trump look good.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  And that's a never, never. You never do that.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  We have a lot of amazing products on sale right now at infowarstore.com.

[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  It's noon here in Austin, Texas at the Infowars World Headquarters.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  Now, if you're tuned in and you're wondering where is Alex, Owen, you told me Alex would be back.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  Well, yes, the plan was for Alex to be back.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  The problem is we're living in Biden's America and we're living in the collapsing civilization that we're in right now.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  And so part of the symptom of our collapsing society, our collapsing civilization, is flight cancellations and what is being now called travel Armageddon.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  Now, probably should have seen this coming, actually, but we tend to take things for granted or because we've just been traveling less here at Infowars because of, well, a lot of stuff, legal stuff.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  I'm not even allowed to leave Travis County. It's nice being a political prisoner of the Democrat Party.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  But I digress. The point is that we are not dealing with the flight misery firsthand as much anymore because we're just not traveling as much as usual.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  And so when Alex had his flight planned to be back in time for the show today, we didn't realize that most flights right now in America are being delayed and canceled and rescheduled and
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  redirected. And so unfortunately, Alex is dealing with that.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  And see, they want to make all these stories up about Alex and, oh, we've got so much money and all this crap. Folks, Alex is flying commercial with his family.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  He's flying on a commercial plane, everyone else, and his family. And so he is dealing with the rest of the commercial flight hell that is going on.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  And so that's why his return has been delayed. And I have to tell you, again, we should have seen this coming.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  Obviously, I talk to journalists and traveling reporters every day. And I hear the same thing every day. I mean, you got about a, if you don't have a direct flight, if you're flying right now in the U.S.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  and you don't have a direct flight, you might as well just count on that flight being delayed or canceled or redirected or losing your backs.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  Pretty much it's going to happen. Pretty much guaranteed. At least that's what I'm being told. And it's actually not just traveling journalists and reporters I'm talking to.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  I'm talking to other people I know that just work in other industries that travel as well every week and tell me the exact same thing. Just total flight hell.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  In fact, I have buddies that work here for Texas-based companies that basically will just jet set to Houston and Dallas and all these other places all the time.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  Just day flights, just 30-hour flights, just in a day. And the individual told me that now that he doesn't even fly anymore.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  He's like, I've had so many flights. You drive Austin to Houston. You're looking at about maybe three hours.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  You fly it with air traffic and all that other stuff. If things are going smoothly, you can crank that trip down to maybe two or even less.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  Same with Dallas. It's about the same length from Austin, that is. And he said he just drives it all now because it's a guarantee that even though he's got a 30-minute flight from Austin to Houston or Austin to Dallas,
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  there's going to be at least an hour, hour and a half delay. And that's either the flight's not arriving, the flight can't take off, some other flight gets redirected. It's total travel hell.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  And so I'm not trying to talk at length here about why Alex isn't in. That's why he's not in.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  But the real story here is that it's just yet another example of how everything is collapsing now in just a year and a half of Democrat control and the Biden White House.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Just everything is collapsing, including the ability to fly stress-free and easily get from one airport to the other. You can forget about that.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  Travel Armageddon continues as flight delays, cancellations pile up, U.S. flight cancellations, delays continue over weekend, more than 4,000 flights canceled, U.S. travelers face new wave of chaos as flight cancellations continue,
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  thousands of flights canceled over U.S. holiday weekend, holiday weekend, oh, Father's Day, or is it Juneteenth or is it the Gay Stuff? We're celebrating them all. LAX cancels 32 flights, delays 136 as thousands of flights canceled across U.S.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  So these are just the headlines as far as all that is concerned. And actually, there's a lot more out there. These are just some of the ones that I picked.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  That's why Alex is out today. He's dealing with what the rest of America is dealing with, and that's the collapse of our country, thanks to the globalist agenda and the Joe Biden administration.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  But hey, Joe Biden takes a vacation every weekend to Delaware to his beachfront mansion, and he doesn't have to worry about this.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  And that's what a lot of this is, actually. A lot of these politicians and a lot of these media members and a lot of these elite liberals, limousine liberals, they're not dealing with this stuff.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  They don't care if gas goes up to $20, $30 a gallon. They've got plenty of money. They don't even drive. They don't fill their tank.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  They don't care if your energy bills are going up. They've got somebody else that pays their AC bills, pays their electric bills.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  They don't care about flights being canceled and flight costs going up and the delays and all that. They fly private. They have private jets.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  So they don't care about all this stuff. And that's why they say, hey, yeah, let's end fossil fuels. Let's end coal. Let's end gas.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  Let's do this great reset. And they really think they'll just somehow be above it all. They'll just somehow float above the surface as everyone else is destroyed by this.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  But of course, that's not even going to be the case. That's delusional thinking on its own.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  But that's what it is. Oh, sure. Yeah. They don't feel the pinch of your energy costs doubling. They don't feel the pinch of your price at the pump tripling.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  They don't feel the pinch of you just lost your 401k, your savings, your stock, your crypto. They don't feel that pinch. They don't care.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  You do the great reset. Yeah, end fossil fuels. Get carbons here, Aya. They're not going to be affected. All the people telling you this, all the people that fly into the World Economic Forum on private jets
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  and then lecture the world how they shouldn't fly on private jets, they really think they're going to be above it all.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  So it's quite an interesting thing, actually. And, you know, I always have to remind myself and remind the audience.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  And this is an ever-changing phenomenon, but you have to understand something.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  If you're tuned in to this transmission or you're tuned in to Info Wars or you just follow news and politics at all with conviction or interest or curiosity,
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  you're actually in a small fraction of society. You're maybe the 10 to 20 percent of society, I would say.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  Most people have no clue what's going on. Now, they see their gas prices going up. They see their grocery bill going up.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  Oh, and by the way, you know that lie that the Biden administration has been telling us its corporate greed, the Democrats telling you its corporate greed?
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  Not so fast. The Consumer Price Index has gone up 10 percent.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  I don't know what the – it varies by month, but it's about 10 percent right now up from when Biden came into office.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  The story just came out over the weekend. So the Consumer Price Index is up about 10 percent.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  But guess what? The Producer Price Index is up 11 percent.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  So where are those greedy corporations? How does that equate to corporate greed?
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  But even if you want to say corporate greed, how come it was so – how come the corporations are so greedy under Joe Biden and not Trump?
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  Why as soon as Biden gets in office, the corporate greed skyrockets?
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  That's a lie, but even if it were the truth, I mean, wouldn't that still be a knock against Joe Biden and the Democrats that, hey, they get into office, all of a sudden corporate greed?
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  Hey, they get into office, all of a sudden Putin invades because they're so weak, because they're so feckless, because they're so pathetic, because they're so crooked and criminal?
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  But no, corporate greed, another lie. Another lie of the Democrats, another lie of Joe Biden.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  Producer Price Index up 11 percent, Consumer Price Index only up 10. But see, that 20 percent of people that have no clue what's going on is slowly becoming 25 and 30 and 35,
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  because it's undeniable that the Democrats and the Biden administration is wrecking this country.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months, we've witnessed the globalists hit humanity and hit humanity extremely hard.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  It is beyond critical that everyone listening to the sound of my voice protect yourselves and your families to the greatest extent possible, and these two new sales do that.

[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  They're coming for your national sovereignty. They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  They're coming for your free speech. They're coming for your privacy.

[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels,
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.

[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  Joe Biden has been such a disaster for the entire planet other than to realize that it has been the United States of America that's been leading the planet.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  And so when your leader goes sideways, when your leader goes insane, when your leader becomes incapacitated, the whole thing falls apart.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  Now, normally in a case like that, you just replace the leader and you get back to normal, but that's not what's happening here.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  Biden isn't going anywhere. He's crashing on his bicycle just like he's crashing the U.S. economy.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  And so the rest of the world is realizing that, okay, the United States of America as the leader of the world, Joe Biden as the leader of the free world,
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  this is going south and fast. This is going really, really badly.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  So they're girding themselves and they're preparing themselves for a new world not led by America, not led by Western values and ideas.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  And these same countries that are realizing this and making moves to avoid collapsing like America, they also are not really interested in going into the World Economic Forum,
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  build back better, great reset New World Order where their citizens will be treated like slaves.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  And so I'm already seeing it play out and I would tell you to just be on the lookout for signs and symptoms of this if you're doubting this.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  But believe me, this is what's happening.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  The world powers that be outside of the U.S. have decided that they're going to form alliances and move on and they're going to leave the U.S. behind.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  And Europe is going to be caught up in that as well, but Europe is pretty much already totally controlled by the globalists.
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  And so that Europe is already lost, really.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  Now, there's been a fight for America to avoid this, but we've been robbed now.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  We've had our elections stolen. We've had our speech censored.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  We've had our Second Amendment infringed upon. So the globalists are making huge gains right now under Joe Biden here.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  And the rest of the world is saying, okay, so you're going to have Europe and you're going to have America.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  So basically North America and Europe at this rate are going to go under the World Economic Forum policies.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  And they're going to be controlled by the World Health Organization and they're going to be controlled by the World Economic Forum.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  And they're going to try to go into the, I mean, what would you really call it?
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  I mean, don't call it a transition. Don't call it carbon neutral. These are their buzzwords.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  I would call it the end of life as we know it, the end of human prosperity, I guess.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  So self-government and the values of individual freedoms are coming to an end in North America and Europe.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  While the rest of the world is kind of looking at that saying, hmm, you know, maybe we could go that way.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  Maybe we should start going towards self-government and freedom.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  Now, you're not going to see that everywhere like China. It's obviously not going to see that, but China doesn't want to be controlled by a bunch of psychotic, deranged globalists in Europe and North America.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  So that's why they're sidling up next to Russia saying, hey, what are you guys thinking as all of this is going down?
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  And then Russia is talking to India saying, what are you guys thinking? And then India is talking to Mexico and then Mexico is talking to Brazil.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  And then Russia is talking to Saudi Arabia. And so all these other countries, all these other world powers outside of Europe and North America are looking at the globalists,
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  looking at the United States of America. And what they're looking at is a decrepit, cancer-ridden, contagious zombie that they don't want to be anywhere near.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  And they want to protect their people from. Now, your media is not telling you about any of this.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  They're not telling you your government is planning on ending the Western life.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  They're not telling you your government is planning on ending the American way of life, ending your freedom, ending your prosperity.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  They're not telling you that. They're in on it.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  But that is what's going on here.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  And they're stealing as much money in the process as possible.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  The draft of House Defense Bill includes $450 million for Ukraine's security assistance.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  So we can't even have security on our own border. We can't even have security at our own schools.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  You don't get school security. You don't get border security. Ukraine gets another half a billion dollars for security.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  Nobody even knows where the tab is at at this point.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  I mean, this is just like, you're at the bar, open tab, just ordering drinks. Yeah, drinks for them, drinks for them.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  Yeah, you ordered drinks on my tab too. Yeah, here's my tab. You don't even know what your tab is. You're just drunk at the bar.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  You don't even know what your tab is anymore.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  That's where it's at with Russia. Who knows, or Ukraine rather, Biden's war against Russia. Who knows what the bill is?
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  40 billion here, 50 billion there, 100 million here, 400 million there, 900 million there, another billion there.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  Where is the bill? I don't know. I'm drunk at the bar.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  So more money for Ukraine defense. Even though even Europe is saying, what are you doing here?
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  Folks, Europe has given up on Ukraine. The only factor fighting Russia now is the West, is Joe Biden.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  And obviously the Ukrainian people and any of the volunteers they get, suckered into going over there,
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  which more and more we hear about, just a total disaster, people volunteering getting killed, people volunteering getting snatched up by the Russians,
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  people volunteering giving away the places where they're located via geo-tracking on the Internet to the Russian military
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  so that they can get kidnapped, captured, have their weapons seized or just bombed.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  It's just been an absolute disaster. And the Biden administration keeps it going because they're laundering literally billions and billions and billions of dollars through Ukraine.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  So they love the war in Ukraine. They're making billions of dollars off of it.
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  The European countries are saying, this is a lost cause. We're out.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  Maybe we'll give you some lip service, but that's all you're going to get from us.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  We're not going to send people to die in Ukraine. We're not going to start a war with Russia.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  If Biden wants to do that, Biden can do that, or whoever controls Biden can put him into that position, and that's what's going on.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  And this is going to be an interesting thing to watch. Russia demands Lithuania lift openly hostile blockade, panic buying ensues.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  The Russian Foreign Ministry has responded to Lithuania's partial blockade of Collingrad writing in a statement that they consider the provocative measures to be openly hostile
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  and warning that the Kremlin may take action to protect its national interests.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  Now, will Lithuania back off? Or will this lead to something more kinetic?
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  If Lithuania backs off, folks, that's a major tell that nobody respects Joe Biden and nobody wants to fight for Ukraine except Ukraine and Joe Biden.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  And really not even Ukraine, actually. Half Ukraine probably supports Russia already anyway, so that's a separate story altogether.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  But if Lithuania says, OK, Russia, we respect you, believe me, Biden's people and NATO's people are on the phone with Lithuania saying, you better not dare.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  You better not dare open that port back up to Russia. So who's Lithuania going to listen to?
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  Is Lithuania going to listen to Russia, or is Lithuania going to listen to the West, the United States, and NATO?
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  And the answer to that will tell you where this is going, folks.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  Now, if they listen to the West, we might have a more serious situation.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  If they listen to Russia, it's just another sign the world now respects Russia more than it respects the United States of America.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  If you go away, you can't just sit there like a jellyfish, and it's the same thing with our immune system.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  God helps those who help themselves.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  We have a lot of amazing products on sale right now at infowarstore.com, like the ultimate immune support pack, our four best-selling products together at 60% off.

[1:29:52.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  Take advantage of this and boost your immune system now and protect yourself and your family at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  Now, out in the open, Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg Group founded Davos Group.
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  So now, the fight's out in the open, they're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:58.000]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  You see it every year.
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:14.000]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:25.000]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more money.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:46.000]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com.
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-900-4285.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  833-900-4285.
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  Cooking dinner and taking care of her sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four-national daughter.
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  I love to make breakfast.
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nutritive and then all sit down together and have that communal event.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions and coming together.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  They really are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth and want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats.
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  We cannot let this continue.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  Joe Biden's approval rating is at 32%.
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Biden's approval rating at a whopping 32%.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  In fact, Joe Biden's approval rating is so low.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  Our discounts at infowarstore.com are higher.
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  Our discounts, how about that?
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  How about that for one?
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  Our discounts at infowarstore.com are higher than Joe Biden's approval ratings.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  I guess that's really not great.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  It's not that great of a plug.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  I mean, his approval ratings are so low.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  I guess that's like saying your discounts are so low.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  So I mean, it would be more better, I guess more accurate to say.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  Our discounts are double Joe Biden's approval rating.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  That's a little bit better.
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  Our discounts are double Joe Biden's approval rating.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  And that's true, by the way, with the ultimate immune support pack,
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  which has the immune support formula, the vitamin D with calcium gummies,
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  the survival shield X2, and the whole food multivitamin.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  It's there on the homepage at infowarstore.com.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  That pack, that ultimate immune support pack with all four of those supplements,
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  is 60% off.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  Double Joe Biden's approval ratings.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  Our discounts are double Joe Biden's approval ratings.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  You can't say it's higher than Joe Biden's approval ratings,
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  because that wouldn't be that big of a discount.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  But when it's double, okay.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  Okay, that's significant.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  So we're selling that pack right now at double 60% off.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  Double Joe Biden's approval ratings.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  His approval ratings, 30%.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  Our discounts are double Joe Biden's approval ratings, 60%.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  And by the way, the summer sale is still ongoing,
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  so there's a lot of big discounts right now at infowarstore.com,
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  like 50% off Brain Force Ultra.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  I was talking to Dan Lyman, actually, a reporter for infowarstore.com.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  He likes Brain Force Plus.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  He asked me, he said,
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  do you like Brain Force Plus or Brain Force Ultra better?
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  What's the difference?
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  I said, Brain Force Ultra is definitely faster acting,
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  being into liquid tincture.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  And I'd say it's a little more potent.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  It was designed to be more potent.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  So Brain Force Ultra, a little faster acting
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  and more potent than Brain Force Plus.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  But some people prefer the Brain Force Plus
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  because the Brain Force Ultra might be a little too potent.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  So it's dealer's choice there.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  It's all at infowarstore.com.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  It's all great.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  What we do is we just find the best supplements
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  at the best price, the best quality,
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  and then deliver them to you at infowarstore.com.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  And then we fund ourselves with those sales.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  So it's a total win.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  You get a great product for your health
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  and you support free speech in the process.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  Not just info wars, but all the people that are at band.video,
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  which we built and we bear the cost of, gladly,
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  at band.video for others to be there as well.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  That's what your support at infowarstore.com does.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  By the way, Lee Stranahan coming up in the next hour,
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  and he has big news on the Joe Biden,
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  Ashley Biden, inappropriate showers when Ashley was a kid
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  and how she wrote journal entries about these interactions
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  and how she believes that they were inappropriate
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  and may have caused her to be a sex addict or an abuse victim.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  And that's the Biden family.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  And I mean, I feel bad, actually.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  I mean, I feel bad that Joe Biden was such a bad father,
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  maybe perhaps even abusive, even sexually abusive,
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  that Ashley Biden has to write about that in her diary
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  and go through that pain in her life.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  And then you just look at Hunter.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  I mean, my God.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  I mean, talk about an absolute disaster.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  Hunter Biden, my goodness, the drug abuse, the drug addiction,
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  the sex abuse, the sex addiction, the combining of them all,
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  then the need to film it.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  He likes to film himself doing drugs and having sex with hookers.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  And then the rumors about maybe his own family members
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  being involved with some of this, maybe some minors.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  Who knows if we'll ever know the full story
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  or have a real investigation,
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  but we do know that the diary is real.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  And so we'll be discussing that with Lee Stranahan
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  coming up in the next hour.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  Meanwhile, Paul finds half of Americans rank moral values
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  in country as poor.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  A new Gallup poll has found that 50% of Americans
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  rank moral values in their country as poor.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  With only 13% saying those values are good,
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  that's the real problem.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  And when you juxtapose that or rather look at that
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  next to the fact that only 80% of Americans,
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  according to a new poll,
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  only 80% of Americans believe in God,
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  well, you start to see the problem.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  So the majority of Americans believe our country
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  has low moral values and a shrinking majority
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  of Americans believe in God and creation.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  And so when you have those two factors combined,
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  that's how you end up with a gay pride month
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  that really just turns into sexual deviation,
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  perversion and abuse of children month,
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  grooming of the children month,
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  sexual abuse of children month,
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  that's what happens.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  And then also that's why you get mass shootings.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  Switzerland has a stunningly high rate of gun ownership.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  Isn't it 100%?
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  I think you have to have a gun in Switzerland,
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  so I think it's like 100%,
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  but this is the headline for Business Insider.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  Switzerland has a stunningly high rate of gun ownership.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  Here's why it doesn't have mass shootings.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  Because they're trained on firearms,
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  they know about firearms at a young age.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  And again, Switzerland doesn't have
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  a low moral country like we have.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  I doubt that 50% of Swiss citizens
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  would say their morals are poor.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  I doubt the rate of a fatherless household in Switzerland
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  is as high as it is in America.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  I don't know as far as their belief in God is concerned.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  But how many Cardi B's come out of Switzerland?
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  How many Kim Kardashian's come out of Switzerland?
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  How many of these degenerates come out of Switzerland
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  as entertainers and cultural icons?
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  Do you see much of that coming out of Switzerland?
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  You ever hear about any of that?
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  You ever see any of that?
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  No, that's just American culture.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  That's just American celebrity
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  taking the most degenerative,
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  stupefied, moronic individuals
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  we can find that promote violence and sex
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  and degeneracy and moral decay,
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  and we lift them up.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  That's what leads to our cultural rot.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  That's what leads to the deterioration of our morals
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  and ultimately the deterioration of our country,
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  which of course leads to all the stuff that we see
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  as far as crime and fatherless households
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  and abortions and everything else goes.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  But see, okay, so what do you do about that?
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  Well, do you really look for a leader to fix that
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  or do you just look at yourself?
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  Because that's what that comes down to
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  and that's what's so frustrating is
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  this is something that actually is probably the easiest fix of all.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  It just requires everybody to get on board.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  You have to wake up every day
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  and look at yourself in the mirror
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  and say, how can I be a better person?
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  You have to look at yourself every day
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  and you have to wake up and you say,
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  how can I be the change I want to see in the world?
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  How can I be an example of the civilization
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  of the society that I want to live in,
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  that I want to raise a family in?
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  And if you're not doing that,
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  well then you're part of the problem.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  Does that mean you're going to be perfect?
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  Of course not.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  Of course you're not going to be perfect.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  Of course you're going to make mistakes,
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  but are you making an active effort?
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  Is it something you're considering every day?
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  How you can be a good person?
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  How you can raise the moral compass?
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  How you can raise the moral value in this country?
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  How you can be a better example for other people?
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  Because that's something that takes all of us.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  There's no government, there's no leadership.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  It's something that takes individual effort every day.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  And then yeah, you know what?
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  Part of that effort means turning off the smut on your television.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  Turning off the smut on your internet.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  Disengaging with all the moral decay activities
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  that have become normal in this country.
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  I'm a humble person
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  and I want to say that I'm just a man.
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  I'm not just a man.
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  Just like you.
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  No matter what color you are, whether you're a man or a woman,
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  you were made by the creator of the universe.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  Who had a plan for you.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  Who has a destiny for you.
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  That's why the system hates you and fears you.
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  That's why they hate me.
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  It's because the spirit I carry is one of justice
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  and truth and courage and honor and will and love.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  My friends, the enemy's coming after me.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  Not because I'm a loser, but because I'm a winner.
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  They're coming after you,
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  not because you're a bad person,
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  because you're a good person.
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  Because you love God and God loves you.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  And so I signed up for this.
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  I signed up for this fight.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  And I'm not a victim.
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  I'm an overcomer.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  And I can't fight this fight without you.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  That's why I want you to always remember
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  that I appreciate you and I thank you
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  because M4 Wars is your fight.
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  M4 Wars is your baby.
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  It's the thing you built.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  We did this together.
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  So God bless you all.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  Let's keep fighting.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  Get our great bag of it here.
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  I mean, this is from, people say,
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil,
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  better than Guatemalan coffee.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  that, you know, the media calls communists,
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  but really they're just a commune.
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  and we've got it.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  and I've been buying it for what, 14 years
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  and the price has never gone up.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  for about 50% more per pound.
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  you're going to find anywhere.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  Yeah, I'd like to.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  You wouldn't believe it.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  and that's how we fund this operation.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  And if you don't find us, you don't want to see, that's fine.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones,
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  needs to support info wars and band.video.
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  You know, the Bible says let another mouth praise you.
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  I'm going to do that right now.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  like Savannah Hernandez, how many people have just been put
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  on a launch pad, the outer space because of Alex Jones,
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  including myself.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  and because of this platform.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  and band.video for granted because you don't know
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  what you have until it's gone.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  So go check out the store.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  Go support their store.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  Go support info wars.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  Leave a donation right now.
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  out of the thousands of great items at m4store.com,
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  all the storeable food.
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  So we've made it easy with our great partners that supply us
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  with the highest quality storeable food out there
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  at the lowest price you're going to find for good food.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  Preparetoday.com.
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  Go to preparetoday.com and protect yourself and your family
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  with what's coming and what is already unfolding
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  with global food shortages.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  I told you over two years ago,
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  the globe was going to have massive inflation
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  and food shortages and it's happened just like clockwork.
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  And I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  They have designed this.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  The way to beat them is to buy food now
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  before your dollar is even more devalued.
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  We are ready to ship to you right now
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  at preparetoday.com and not just storeable food,
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  hundreds of the highest quality,
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  survival and preparedness items in stock
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  at low prices ready to ship to you right now
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  at preparetoday.com.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  You can also use the URL preparewithalex.com
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  and it takes you there.
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:12.000]  Take action.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  All right, I've got more news on the situation
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  with Ukraine and Russia here.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  And none of it's good.
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  Dozens of Ukrainian officers killed in missile strike.
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  So I guess that's just more signs Ukraine is winning, right?
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  More sign that the globalists are winning.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  NATO is winning.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  The West is winning.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  No, not exactly.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  Blockade of Russian region is a breach
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  of international law says Moscow.
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  And so I'm telling you that Lithuania situation
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  is going to be very telling, folks.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  Who will Lithuania cave to?
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  The West or Russia?
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  And that will be a major indicator
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  of where this is going to go fast is what happens there.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  UK chief says his soldiers should be ready
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  to fight Russia in a war.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  British forces must prepare to fight in Europe once again.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  This is just like another corrupt general in the U.S.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  telling you you need to fight Russians in Ukraine.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  It's just BS.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  No, young men in the UK do not need to go fight Russia in Ukraine.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  Sorry, no they don't.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  You might want them to for your own selfish reasons,
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  but they have no benefit going there to fight.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  Western populations must do more for Ukraine
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  even if it costs them, even if the costs of food and fuel
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  are high, says the NATO chief.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  Yeah, just begging you to fight Russia.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  Just begging you, because that's what it is.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  They know Russia is right now the biggest threat
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  to the new world order.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  They know Russia is actually acting as a conduit
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  for other world powers that are sick and tired
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  of the corrupt Western regime,
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  sick and tired of corrupt Western presidents
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  and have just had enough of Joe Biden.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  They just want nothing to do with Biden.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  He's just another example of a Western dropping,
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  a Western turd, a Western piece of poop
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  that they have to deal with.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  They don't want to invite them to meetings.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  They don't want them to come to their meetings.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  Saudi Arabia doesn't want to deal with them.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  Russia doesn't want to deal with them.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  China doesn't want to deal with them.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  Nobody wants to deal with this guy.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  So the new world order and their whole plan,
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  the World Economic Forum, the UN,
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  the World Health Organization, Bill Gates,
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  Klaus Schwab, George Soros and all the people
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  that control the West, Europe and North America,
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  they know now Russia is the biggest threat
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  to their conquering of the planet
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  and they know that Russia is the biggest threat
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  to their global power structure.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  And so they're begging their slaves.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  They're begging their human commodities
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  to fight for them and to defeat Russia.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  Folks, it is not in our interest for Russia to be destroyed.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  It is not in our interest to be fighting Russia.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  It is only in the interests of the new world order.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  It is only in the interest of the Bilderberg Group.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  It is only in the interest of the World Economic Forum.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  It is only in the interest of NATO, the UN,
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  the World Health Organization.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  They look at you as a commodity
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  and so they want to throw you at Russia
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  because they know Russia and Putin
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  is the threat to their plan to conquer the planet
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  and end humanity on it.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  That's what all this claptrapping and saber-rattling
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  and encouraging you to fight Russia is all about.
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  Russia is a threat to them, not to you, to them.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  Western arms could help Ukraine seize Donbass, says NATO.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  Yeah, they're begging for more weapons too.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  You haven't done enough.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  Send us all your weapons.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  Volunteer.
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  Send us more money.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  Billionaires trying to conquer this planet.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  They should be funding all this war in Russia that they want,
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  not the people.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  Ukraine moves to ban Russian music, literature.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  Well, what does that sound like?
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  That sounds familiar.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  Germany returns to coal.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  Oh yeah, all those coal power plants, they shut down.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  Now they're turning them back on.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  Why? Because of Joe Biden.
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  That's what I'm saying, folks.
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  People really don't realize how big of a disaster Joe Biden is on the planet.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  And European leaders know this.
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  Germany returning to coal.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  Germany is hoarding gas, by the way.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  Germany is now hoarding gas.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  That's funny.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  Joe Biden is giving our gas away to Europe.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  Joe Biden is tapped into more than half of our strategic oral reserves
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  and he's giving them to Europe, not even to you, the American people.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  He's not even flooding our market with that.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  He's giving them to Europe.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  Why? Because he has to buy their silence.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  What are you going to do if you're the leader of Germany
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  or you're the leader of any of these European countries,
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  France, what have you?
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  And since Biden has gotten in power,
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  you now have a war in your region.
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  You now have your gas prices going up.
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  You now have inflation.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  And you know it's all because of the foreign policy of the U.S.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  and also because of Joe Biden's energy policy,
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  which included giving Russia control of the pipelines into Europe.
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  So you know it's all Biden's fault, but what can you do?
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  Biden is your ally in this build-back, better, great reset agenda.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  And Biden is your ally in stopping the force of Russia
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  for being a force of good on this planet.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  So you don't want to hurt your ally.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  You don't want to call your ally out, so what do you do?
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  Well, you cut a deal and you offer your silence for money.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  And that's what's going on.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  So Biden is funding the entire war against Russia in Ukraine,
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  is being funded entirely by us, America,
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  not NATO, not European countries, us, the U.S.,
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  and Biden is giving Europe our oil.
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  And all he asks is their loyalty in lip service.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  That's all he asks.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  Don't say anything bad about me.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  Don't say anything bad about my policies.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  And we will give you our oil and we will fund the war in Ukraine.
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  All I ask for is your loyalty in lip service,
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  which they're really not even getting that.
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  Even Macron is making public statements saying,
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  we've lost the war in Ukraine, it's over, this is a waste of time and money.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  And you notice maybe that's because Macron's party is now the minority party in France,
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  so he's having to actually tell some truth,
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  hoping that'll boost his party's favorability.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  But I don't think it's going to go so hot.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  So that's what's going on.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  It's truly sad.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  Our media is not reporting this.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  It's truly sad that that's how corrupt our president is.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  And I mean, really, folks, all of the,
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  all American people should be so angry about this.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  I mean, there should be impeachment.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  There should be multiple impeachment hearings going on right now,
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  but the Republican party is a bunch of sad sacks.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  Half the Republican party is corrupt as the Democrats anyway.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  Yeah, you really think Mitch McConnell is going to raise any fuss in D.C.?
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  Yeah, right.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  Mitch McConnell's going to be as about as disturbing as a fart in the ocean.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  So, and they're probably, they're probably laundering money too,
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  and they're probably getting rich off their stock options too
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  with the defense contractors and the weapons manufacturers.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  So they don't mind, plus they all have millions of dollars that they've stolen.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  So they don't mind that Biden's crashing the economy.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  They don't mind that gas prices are going up.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  They don't mind that the stocks are collapsing
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  because all their assets are doing just fine,
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  and they've already got their millions and millions of dollars.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  They can afford to live through a recession.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  So imagine this though.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  You don't have to imagine it. You're living it.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  Joe Biden has been such a disaster on the planet
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  that he has to buy our allies' silence in Europe
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  by funding and arming the war in Ukraine
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  and by giving them our strategic oral reserves,
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  and our media and our Republican party won't even tell you that that's what's going on.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  When it's clear and present that that is the case.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  And now what?
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  The war in Ukraine has been going on for four months.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  And what?
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  Russia's taken the region they wanted to.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  Russia now controls most of the important ports in Crimea.
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  They freed eastern Ukraine from the CIA proxy groups
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  and the Nazi groups and the Azov battalion.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  They've taken control of most of the ports in Crimea and that region.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  And perhaps even more importantly actually, geopolitically than that,
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  they have become favorable.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  And really, Putin and Russia is emerging as the leader
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  as the anti-Western regime faction
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  that is uniting the rest of the world that has been sick of the Western elites,
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  sick of the Western regimes, sick of their uniparty propaganda,
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  sick of their uniparty wars, sick of their money laundering,
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  sick of their wars, their killing, their stealing, all of it.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  And Putin has decided, for whatever reason,
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  maybe through osmosis he found himself in this position,
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  but he's there now uniting the planet against all the evils
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  that have been coming out of the West for decades,
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  which we all know has been going on.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  And I think if the West tries to make a move into Syria,
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  that might be the final straw that broke Russia's back.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  I don't know what would happen there.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  But this is what's going on.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  Your media won't tell you about it.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  Your politicians won't tell you about it because they are in on it.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  And honestly, if they don't realize how this is going to hurt them in the end,
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  they're just too stupid already.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  So now, the fight's out in the open.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  God's watching.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  The children are counting on us.
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  and your prayer and your financial support,
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  I'm a humble person.
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:52.000]  And I want to say that I'm just a man.
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  But I'm not just a man.
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:55.000]  Just like you.
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  No matter what color you are, whether you're a man or a woman,
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  you were made by the creator of the universe.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  Who had a plan for you.
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  Who has a destiny for you.
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:07.000]  That's why the system hates you and fears you.
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  That's why they hate me.
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  It's because the spirit I carry is one of justice and truth and courage
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:15.000]  and honor and will and love.
[1:59:15.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  My friends, the enemies coming after me,
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  not because I'm a loser, but because I'm a winner.
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  They're coming after you, not because you're a bad person,
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  because you're a good person,
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  because you love God and God loves you.
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  And so I signed up for this.
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  I signed up for this fight.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  And I'm not a victim.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  I'm an overcomer.
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  But I can't fight this fight without you.
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  That's why I want you always to remember that I appreciate you
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:41.000]  and I thank you because Info Wars is your fight.
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  Info Wars is your baby.
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  It's the thing you built.
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  We did this together.
[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  So God bless you all.
[1:59:47.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  Thank you.
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:17.000]  Thank you so much.
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  Thank you so much.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  So I said about however necessary to take over the United States.
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  I'd subvert the churches first.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  With the wisdom of the serpent I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  Do as you please.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  To the young I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  In the old I would teach you to pray after me.
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  Our father, which art in Washington.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  And then I'd get organized.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  I'd educate authors in how to make a lurid literature exciting
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:59.000]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  If I were the devil I'd soon have families at war with themselves.
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:15.000]  Churches at war with themselves and nations at war with themselves
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  until each in its turn was consumed.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  And with promises of higher ratings I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the play.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  The president of the United States is racist.
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  If I were the devil I would encourage schools to recline young intellects
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  but neglect the discipline of motions just like those one while.
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  Within a decade I'd have prisons overflowing.
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  and then from the houses of Congress.
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  And in his own churches I would substitute psychology for religion.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  If I were the devil I'd take from those who have
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  and give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  I would caution against extremes.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  I'm here to warn people you keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game.
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct,
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  I would convince the young that marriage is old fashioned,
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  And thus I could undress you in public
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  In other words, if I were the devil I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  Now you know the rest of the story.
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  The year is 1995.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  And Infowars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  In a freak mishap, Infowars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  into an orbit which freezes his life support systems
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  Transdimensionally, over the space time continuum, they're full space.
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic,
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women,
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved,
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  it's fulfilling Infowars, Tomorrow's News, today.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  The immune support formula is incredible by itself.

[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  And I'm joined by Lee Stranahan here.
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  We're going to be discussing the latest developments in the Ashley Biden Diary story.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  Here are some of the headlines leading up to this.
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:45.000]  President Joe Biden's daughter reportedly writes of alleged abuse in diary.
[2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:51.000]  Why is the FBI investigating Ashley Biden's missing diary?
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:57.000]  Ashley Biden Diary reveals child sex trauma, drug abuse, resentment for Joe.
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  And so it ultimately ended up with Project Veritas.
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:03.000]  They said, oh, it was fake, it was fake.
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  And then the feds rushed in to grab it, so obviously it was real.
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  And the details of the diary are sorted indeed.
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  Lee Stranahan with me now.
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  So Lee, I mean, of all the affairs of the Biden family that we now know of, Hunter Biden's drug abuse and addiction, sex abuse and addiction,
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  his need to film this and put it on his computer and on the internet.
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  Of course, we know about Hunter Biden sleeping with his sister-in-law.
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  Joe Biden gave it a full endorsement to the public.
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  But perhaps maybe the most sorted of all of this is the notion that Ashley Biden writes in her diary about potential sex abuse from Joe Biden in the shower when she was a kid.
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:52.000]  I mean, of all the sort of details of the Biden family, this might be the worst, Lee.
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  Well, on the face of it, I agree with you.
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  And Ashley Biden's diary is very clear.
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  She says in one paragraph, what this diary is, is she was going through a bad period during the Biden campaign.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  She was using a lot of drugs and having a number of affairs and her marriage was on the rocks.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  And she was fair to say she was unable to control sexuality.
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  So what she might call sex addiction.
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  And I won't get into the technical psychological definition of that, but she was being very self-destructive with her sexuality.
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  Does that make sense?
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  Yeah.
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  And for people, if they want to understand, if you've ever known somebody that's had a very degenerative drug addiction and they just prioritized the drug abuse and the drug use over everything else,
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  that's basically similar to what goes on with a sex addiction is, and that's why Ashley Biden, I guess, would write about all these affairs,
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  is you prioritize that over everything else.
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  So she was going around, I guess, just sleeping with a bunch of men, and that was her most important thing in her life at the time.
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  And there is a brain chemistry thing in association with that, but that's basically what is a sex addiction.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  Well, and for instance, one person she slept with, and she slept with him very quickly after meeting him.
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  She felt an attraction and slept with the person, then she finds out afterwards he's married.
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  So she's sitting here trying to figure out, and she could have seen that coming.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  Does that make sense?
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  She thought.
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  So in her diary, she's basically saying, why do I get involved with these people who are unavailable to me?
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  Does it make sense?
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  Yes, yes.
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  And so in the diary, she's writing for herself, and this diary has been confirmed with a handwriting analysis.
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  And furthermore, I'm going to say something here.
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  The New York Times confirmed that this is Ashley Biden's diary, not Project Veritas.
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  The New York Times confirmed that.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  And I'll come to Veritas in a second, but she was going through this bad period and relapsing on cocaine and so on.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  So she's trying to figure out why she's doing this.
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  Does that make sense?
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  She was trying to figure out why I'm not like this.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  Yes.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  So let me just kind of, let me kind of, because I understand where you're going with this.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  You're trying to explain, she's writing in this diary.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  She's kind of going through her own head.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  She's processing in her own head.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  Why did she become like this?
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  Why did she get addicted to sex?
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  Why did she get addicted to drugs?
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  Why is she behaving in such a degenerative way?
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  She's kind of self-reflecting on all these developments in her life.
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  Right.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  And then ultimately, she lands on what's as the cause?
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  Well, she asked herself and she answers.
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  She said, was I molested as a child?
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  I think I was.
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  She says that very explicitly.
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  By the way, if you want to listen to the diary and I say, listen, someone on YouTube, if
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  you search for Ashley Biden's diary, talked it, it's about an hour.
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  They did an audio book of the diary.
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  So you can, without reading her handwriting, if you want to see what she wrote, you can
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  listen to a guy narrate it.
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  So, at one point, she says, was I molested as a child?
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  I think so.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  And then a few paragraphs later, she says, and I'm paraphrasing here, but she says, I've
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  always been boy crazy.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  She said, I remember sleeping with friends at a very young age.
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  And she said, and showers with my father, probably inappropriate.
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  That's in the midst of her trying to figure out why she is this way.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  She says she took showers with her father that were probably appropriate.
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  So basically the conclusion that she's, she's reaching or that she's, she's considering
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  is that she was sexually abused as a kid.
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  And one example would be her father, Joe Biden, in the shower with her.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  Right.
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  And so we're not accusing Joe Biden of that.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  She says, why am I like this?
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  And that's something she hypothesizes.
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  Does it make sense?
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  Yes.
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  What with you?
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  In other words, I think it's, I don't know what happened.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  You don't know what happened.
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  But I know she said that's what happened.
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  And I know to dismiss it is insulting to her.
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  Does it make sense?
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  Of course.
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  I mean, believe all women.
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  We've all heard that a hundred thousand times.
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  Believe all women.
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  And I'm not saying believe it, but there's, there's no reason to dismiss it out of hand.
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  Well, I mean, I'm being facetious when I see, when I say believe all women, because that's
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  just a leftist trope.
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  But no, what you're saying here is this is Ashley's own words.
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  This is in her own mind, what she's considering.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  And so if we want to be empathetic, right?
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  I mean, legitimately empathetic.
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  If we feel badly for the, you know, like you feel badly for someone's alcohol, alcoholic,
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  right?
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  And they're trying to figure that out.
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  And they said, I think my father gave me beer when I was eight all the time.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  You wouldn't say you're a liar immediately.
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  You'd say, okay, let's consider that, right?
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  Because they're trying to work out their own problems.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  So Ashley Biden said that in a diary when she was going through rehab and she's in the
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  middle of rehab as she's writing a diary.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:08.000]  Then what happened was she was staying in a house in Delray Beach, California, forgive
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  me, Florida.
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  And you hear it referred to as Palm Beach, but it was actually Delray Beach.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  She was staying at a person's house, a house with a pool and everything.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  And then she left the house in the middle of the campaign to go to Philadelphia.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  And in doing so, she left a devil bag and a suitcase full of papers with her name all
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  over them.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  And she left the diary under the bed, you know, tucked under the mattress or something
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  like that.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  Now, then having left and left that stuff there, a woman named Amy Harris moved into
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  the house.
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  She was apparently friends with the owner and she was going through a breakup and she
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  and her children moved in and they found this diary and it's very clearly and they found
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  papers saying they belong to Ashley Biden.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:18.500]  Now right here, there was no theft, right?
[2:15:18.500 --> 2:15:23.000]  If I'm staying in a house and I leave my stuff there and you move into the house and you
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  find it, you didn't steal it, right?
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  That's correct.
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  That's like the Hunter Biden laptop being left at an IT store.
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  Exactly right.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:40.160]  And it's a good analogy because let me ask you a question I don't have the answer to,
[2:15:40.160 --> 2:15:42.920]  but I have my suspicions.
[2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:50.920]  Do you really think that maybe Ashley Biden wanted someone to see this?
[2:15:50.920 --> 2:15:52.680]  You know, let's leave it right there.
[2:15:52.680 --> 2:15:53.680]  Great question.
[2:15:53.680 --> 2:15:55.720]  As we take a break, we'll answer it on the other side.
[2:15:55.720 --> 2:15:58.800]  The globalists are making their move.
[2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:00.720]  Their great reset is here.
[2:16:00.720 --> 2:16:02.240]  They're coming for your children.
[2:16:02.240 --> 2:16:04.560]  They're coming for the value of your currency.
[2:16:04.560 --> 2:16:06.680]  They're coming for your national sovereignty.
[2:16:06.680 --> 2:16:11.360]  They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny.
[2:16:11.360 --> 2:16:13.680]  They're coming for your free speech.
[2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:15.560]  They're coming for your privacy.
[2:16:15.560 --> 2:16:20.480]  And ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative
[2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:23.920]  in government that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[2:16:23.920 --> 2:16:29.560]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view, 2000 Mules

[2:17:03.080 --> 2:17:08.880]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the sensors has been Patriot
[2:17:08.880 --> 2:17:12.840]  Apparel so we can identify each other, so we can spread the word, and so we can push
[2:17:12.840 --> 2:17:17.680]  people to websites like infowars.com so they can understand the globalist plan and how
[2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:18.680]  to stop it.
[2:17:18.680 --> 2:17:21.680]  Now ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our
[2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:25.440]  designs of t-shirts, some of which go back more than 25 years.
[2:17:25.440 --> 2:17:26.680]  All these shirts are limited edition.
[2:17:26.680 --> 2:17:30.840]  They are about to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your
[2:17:30.840 --> 2:17:31.840]  wardrobe.
[2:17:31.840 --> 2:17:36.200]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left in a couple weeks.
[2:17:36.200 --> 2:17:38.080]  They'll all be gone and they'll be history.
[2:17:38.080 --> 2:17:44.720]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com, so thank you all for your support.
[2:17:44.720 --> 2:17:50.080]  Please visit infowarstore.com and get one of these historic shirts, hoodies, long sleeves,
[2:17:50.080 --> 2:17:52.080]  ball caps, you name it, while you still can.
[2:17:52.080 --> 2:18:02.080]  I want to thank you all for your support, infowarstore.com.
[2:18:02.080 --> 2:18:03.520]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[2:18:03.520 --> 2:18:05.520]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[2:18:05.520 --> 2:18:06.520]  It is.
[2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:09.000]  I took it with Bish oil.
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:10.960]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[2:18:10.960 --> 2:18:14.200]  The fish oil is better than it, and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:19.840]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[2:18:19.840 --> 2:18:23.640]  Crill oils is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm just sorry, you want
[2:18:23.640 --> 2:18:25.360]  something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:28.440]  The Crill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[2:18:28.440 --> 2:18:32.080]  I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something, I eat five caplets
[2:18:32.080 --> 2:18:33.440]  of Crill oil before I go to bed.
[2:18:33.440 --> 2:18:36.960]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[2:18:36.960 --> 2:18:44.440]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[2:18:44.440 --> 2:18:47.880]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know what, I just obsess, because whatever
[2:18:47.880 --> 2:18:50.320]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[2:18:50.320 --> 2:18:51.320]  I just can't do it.
[2:18:51.320 --> 2:18:52.320]  Infowarstore.com.
[2:18:52.320 --> 2:19:03.240]  I don't have to tell you that fish oil is known to be so good for your brain, so good
[2:19:03.240 --> 2:19:08.800]  for your heart, so good for your cells, your cardiovascular system, your lungs, your sleep,
[2:19:08.800 --> 2:19:09.800]  it's amazing.

[2:19:58.320 --> 2:20:05.320]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:05.320 --> 2:20:26.000]  We're here with Lee Stranahan, the question he asked before the break as he was describing
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:34.640]  the situation that landed the Ashley Biden diary in the hands of journalists is, could
[2:20:34.640 --> 2:20:41.120]  Ashley Biden have intentionally left that diary behind, hoping somebody would see it
[2:20:41.120 --> 2:20:42.720]  like a cry for help?
[2:20:42.720 --> 2:20:46.400]  Maybe you could ask the same question about Hunter Biden's laptop.
[2:20:46.400 --> 2:20:52.840]  Now, let me just say this before we get into this with Lee Stranahan, I'm somebody that
[2:20:52.840 --> 2:20:58.360]  studied psychology in college and actually was considering about going into advanced
[2:20:58.360 --> 2:21:00.880]  studies of it, but I didn't want to stay in college.
[2:21:00.880 --> 2:21:01.880]  I didn't really like college.
[2:21:01.880 --> 2:21:04.760]  I didn't really like all the prerequisites you had to go through to get an advanced degree
[2:21:04.760 --> 2:21:05.760]  in psychology.
[2:21:05.760 --> 2:21:09.240]  So I skipped that and I ended up just getting a degree in media, going into media.
[2:21:09.240 --> 2:21:14.480]  But psychology, human psychology was something that was very intriguing to me.
[2:21:14.480 --> 2:21:18.800]  I excelled at that in those studies just because it came naturally, it was intriguing to me.
[2:21:18.800 --> 2:21:27.480]  So there are examples, Lee, probably the best example would be in criminal psychology, specifically
[2:21:27.480 --> 2:21:32.720]  dealing with serial killers, where there reaches a point where they want credit for their work
[2:21:32.720 --> 2:21:34.920]  and they want to be caught.
[2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:39.680]  Now this might not be the best example, I'm just saying there's a level of human psychology
[2:21:39.680 --> 2:21:47.520]  where you might do something not even maybe subconsciously, you're doing something subconsciously,
[2:21:47.520 --> 2:21:52.680]  not even realizing you're doing it because you want to be caught, you want credit, or
[2:21:52.680 --> 2:21:56.240]  in this case with the Ashley Biden diary, it's like a cry for help.
[2:21:56.240 --> 2:21:58.800]  There's no other way she can really cry for help.
[2:21:58.800 --> 2:22:01.680]  She doesn't even know how to do that in her own mind.
[2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:04.640]  She can't even convince herself that she was abused as a kid.
[2:22:04.640 --> 2:22:09.600]  So this is kind of her subliminal subconscious crying for help, like if I just leave this
[2:22:09.600 --> 2:22:15.040]  here and somebody finds it, maybe I can have my cries for help answered.
[2:22:15.040 --> 2:22:20.200]  I don't know if that's been the case for her or not, but why, Lee, let's just get back
[2:22:20.200 --> 2:22:22.040]  to the details here.
[2:22:22.040 --> 2:22:27.680]  She leaves the diary behind, it gets found by the next family, you know, talk about.
[2:22:27.680 --> 2:22:32.200]  So she leaves the diary behind, I mean, would you really want to leave something like that
[2:22:32.200 --> 2:22:33.200]  behind?
[2:22:33.200 --> 2:22:35.280]  Apparently left some other personal belongings behind.
[2:22:35.280 --> 2:22:37.520]  Seems like something you don't leave behind, Lee.
[2:22:37.520 --> 2:22:44.680]  Well, also you know psychology, so I will say the diary also contains points where
[2:22:44.680 --> 2:22:46.880]  she says she loves her father.
[2:22:46.880 --> 2:22:54.440]  She says as several points, she loves her father and that's consistent with the confusion.
[2:22:54.440 --> 2:23:00.080]  She might feel that doesn't saying she loves her father does not prove that he didn't
[2:23:00.080 --> 2:23:02.720]  want her right.
[2:23:02.720 --> 2:23:08.640]  It proves that she's out of two minds on it.
[2:23:08.640 --> 2:23:15.880]  One, she thinks that these inappropriate showers happen and two, that children naturally
[2:23:15.880 --> 2:23:18.880]  love their parents, right?
[2:23:18.880 --> 2:23:25.480]  So that's the confusion that someone who's acting out sexually to get approval for men,
[2:23:25.480 --> 2:23:28.240]  because that's obviously what's going on.
[2:23:28.240 --> 2:23:30.880]  She talks about that a little bit in the diary too.
[2:23:30.880 --> 2:23:35.280]  So I want to be clear about one thing I'm saying here.
[2:23:35.280 --> 2:23:42.720]  At no point did James O'Keeffe or Project Veritas accuse Joe Biden of taking showers
[2:23:42.720 --> 2:23:46.360]  with his daughter.
[2:23:46.360 --> 2:23:54.800]  The accusation is made by Ashley Biden in this diary that eventually Project Veritas
[2:23:54.800 --> 2:23:57.000]  came to be in possession of.
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:24:07.680]  Now the FBI says that AH, which is assumed is Amy Harris and R.K. is a friend of hers,
[2:24:07.680 --> 2:24:14.280]  sold it to Project Veritas and they have not denied that.
[2:24:14.280 --> 2:24:19.760]  So it seems like Amy Harris, the woman who came into possession of the diary when she
[2:24:19.760 --> 2:24:24.960]  moved into the house, sold it to Project Veritas, okay?
[2:24:24.960 --> 2:24:32.560]  But at no point did James O'Keeffe or Project Veritas accuse Joe Biden of anything.
[2:24:32.560 --> 2:24:34.040]  They never talked about it.
[2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:35.040]  Is that clear?
[2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:41.000]  Because I want to point out there was an FBI raid on James O'Keeffe's house and an employee
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:48.720]  of Project Veritas, but no accusation was made by Project Veritas about Joe Biden.
[2:24:48.720 --> 2:24:50.880]  And you'll hear the lies sometimes.
[2:24:50.880 --> 2:24:55.040]  Well James, Project Veritas accused Joe Biden.
[2:24:55.040 --> 2:24:56.040]  No they didn't.
[2:24:56.040 --> 2:24:57.040]  Okay?
[2:24:57.040 --> 2:24:58.760]  Does it make sense?
[2:24:58.760 --> 2:25:03.160]  Nobody accused Joe Biden of any of this until we saw the diary when Ashley Biden is the
[2:25:03.160 --> 2:25:06.200]  one that wrote the record.
[2:25:06.200 --> 2:25:07.200]  Right.
[2:25:07.200 --> 2:25:10.560]  And Project Veritas didn't print that story.
[2:25:10.560 --> 2:25:16.600]  Now one of the smears against James O'Keeffe and Project Veritas and you've heard it and
[2:25:16.600 --> 2:25:25.200]  you've heard it about Infowars, Project Veritas is not a journalistic organization according
[2:25:25.200 --> 2:25:29.560]  to the New York Times and Washington Post and so on.
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:31.680]  They're an actuous organization.
[2:25:31.680 --> 2:25:32.680]  You've heard that, right?
[2:25:32.680 --> 2:25:33.680]  Yeah.
[2:25:33.680 --> 2:25:39.880]  I mean they always try to slander real journalists like James O'Keeffe.
[2:25:39.880 --> 2:25:47.120]  Now if someone who is not a real journalist got a hold of that diary about 10 days before
[2:25:47.120 --> 2:25:54.560]  the election, an activist, just a partisan activist, what would they have done logically?
[2:25:54.560 --> 2:25:57.200]  They would have gotten that diary out there, right?
[2:25:57.200 --> 2:25:58.200]  Yeah.
[2:25:58.200 --> 2:26:02.960]  And the first, the first I recall of hearing or seeing the diary was Patrick Howley reporting
[2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:06.320]  on it with the national file, but I don't remember, I don't remember the dates of that
[2:26:06.320 --> 2:26:07.320]  reporting.
[2:26:07.320 --> 2:26:09.160]  I don't remember before or after election.
[2:26:09.160 --> 2:26:15.160]  It was before the election and Patrick Howley said in his report, a national file, he was
[2:26:15.160 --> 2:26:22.400]  given a diary by someone with a media organization who's afraid that that media organization,
[2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:28.720]  he's obviously talking about Veritas, he doesn't say it, but in retrospect, the person who
[2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:33.560]  gave it to Patrick thought they weren't going to publish it.
[2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:40.240]  And sure enough, do you know what Project Veritas did when they had this explosive information?
[2:26:40.240 --> 2:26:44.280]  Well, they attempted, they attempted to verify it.
[2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:45.560]  They didn't sit on it.
[2:26:45.560 --> 2:26:50.560]  They actively tried to verify it, but weren't unable to do so.
[2:26:50.560 --> 2:26:55.160]  They wanted confirmation from the, from Ashley Biden.
[2:26:55.160 --> 2:26:56.160]  This is hers.
[2:26:56.160 --> 2:26:57.800]  Does it make sense?
[2:26:57.800 --> 2:26:59.200]  Yes.
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:04.560]  That's exactly what a journalistic organization would do.
[2:27:04.560 --> 2:27:14.120]  Now despite that, months later, the Department of Justice, the FEI, did early morning raids
[2:27:14.120 --> 2:27:18.600]  with James O'Keefe and employee of Project Veritas.
[2:27:18.600 --> 2:27:26.280]  They came in with guns, said, put your hands in the air and searched the guy's house and
[2:27:26.280 --> 2:27:29.600]  searched James O'Keefe's house.
[2:27:29.600 --> 2:27:36.120]  This is very dangerous when the FEI is doing this to a journalistic organization that had
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:40.160]  made no, no claims about this, right?
[2:27:40.160 --> 2:27:48.640]  Had done nothing wrong and had received property that was not stolen.
[2:27:48.640 --> 2:27:51.200]  But they said in the warrant, it was stolen.
[2:27:51.200 --> 2:27:57.200]  They knew that it was not stolen because they knew how Amy Harris came into possession
[2:27:57.200 --> 2:27:58.200]  of it.
[2:27:58.200 --> 2:28:02.880]  So just think about, forget the shower stuff entirely.
[2:28:02.880 --> 2:28:14.040]  The FEI raided the home of a journalist and a publisher in America who had done nothing
[2:28:14.040 --> 2:28:15.680]  wrong.
[2:28:15.680 --> 2:28:17.680]  We should stop there for a second.
[2:28:17.680 --> 2:28:24.600]  In the light of joining Assange being extradited, the war on journalism, and despite all of
[2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:31.840]  what Alex had been through, this war on journalism, this is a next level point in this.
[2:28:31.840 --> 2:28:36.440]  The FEI coming in, guns blazing, right?
[2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:39.880]  Searching and they took 200,000 pieces.
[2:28:39.880 --> 2:28:41.560]  They searched James O'Keefe's phone.
[2:28:41.560 --> 2:28:45.600]  Well, let me do this because we're about to go to a break because you're onto something
[2:28:45.600 --> 2:28:48.520]  here, I want to continue down this path.
[2:28:48.520 --> 2:28:54.560]  Why did the FBI do that raid and why did it take them a year to do it?
[2:28:54.560 --> 2:28:56.600]  We'll be right back with Lee Strandingham.
[2:28:56.600 --> 2:29:03.200]  There's an old Bedouin saying that's thousands of years old and it goes like this.
[2:29:03.200 --> 2:29:05.600]  Trust in God with tie up your camel.
[2:29:05.600 --> 2:29:08.040]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way.
[2:29:08.040 --> 2:29:09.960]  Pray to God but row away from the rocks.
[2:29:09.960 --> 2:29:14.320]  If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get smashed on him and
[2:29:14.320 --> 2:29:16.240]  killed but also try to row away.

[2:33:23.440 --> 2:33:32.880]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[2:33:32.880 --> 2:33:42.480]  Lee Strandhand is with us and we're talking about the Ashley Biden diary which we segue
[2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:53.080]  now into the war on journalism because what's happened since the publishing or the sharing
[2:33:53.080 --> 2:33:58.560]  of the Ashley Biden diary is the government going after journalists for doing journalism
[2:33:58.560 --> 2:33:59.920]  and that's what's going on.
[2:33:59.920 --> 2:34:05.720]  So when the FBI raided Project Veritas to get this journal, really Lee, it just begs
[2:34:05.720 --> 2:34:08.320]  a lot of questions and I'll just throw them out there.
[2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:12.280]  You can answer the ones you can and just kind of pontificate on the ones you can't.
[2:34:12.280 --> 2:34:18.840]  But first of all, why would the FBI raid somebody's house looking for Ashley Biden's diary that
[2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:20.360]  she left somewhere else?
[2:34:20.360 --> 2:34:24.200]  I mean, if she wanted to go find her missing diary, why wouldn't she just go knock on the
[2:34:24.200 --> 2:34:25.920]  door and ask for it back?
[2:34:25.920 --> 2:34:27.800]  Why send the feds?
[2:34:27.800 --> 2:34:31.200]  And then the other question would be, why wait a year?
[2:34:31.200 --> 2:34:37.360]  Why was there a year in between when the journal or the diary was received by Project Veritas
[2:34:37.360 --> 2:34:41.560]  a year in between that and when the raid happened?
[2:34:41.560 --> 2:34:44.360]  Lee Strandhand, your thoughts, your answers.
[2:34:44.360 --> 2:34:53.960]  Well, the wheels of justice move slowly, this initial FBI action was approved by Bill Barr
[2:34:53.960 --> 2:34:56.840]  because it was approved when Trump was still president.
[2:34:56.840 --> 2:35:03.040]  So the initial FBI looking into this, but the wheels of justice move slowly.
[2:35:03.040 --> 2:35:04.840]  Why did this take a year?
[2:35:04.840 --> 2:35:12.520]  Because first the Delray police acquired the suitcase and the devil bag with all these
[2:35:12.520 --> 2:35:15.920]  documents from Ashley Biden.
[2:35:15.920 --> 2:35:23.840]  Then the FBI was brought into the case by the Delray police, apparently because she's
[2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:28.160]  a high profile daughter, right?
[2:35:28.160 --> 2:35:37.200]  But then Mayor Garland had to be brought in to approve and a judge had approved the search
[2:35:37.200 --> 2:35:40.520]  warrant for Veritas.
[2:35:40.520 --> 2:35:43.920]  And let me ask you another question.
[2:35:43.920 --> 2:35:46.440]  And this is a hypothesis.
[2:35:46.440 --> 2:35:53.560]  Why is Tucker Carlson bringing us up last Friday, Friday night?
[2:35:53.560 --> 2:35:58.120]  Last Friday, he brought up and he devoted the first two minutes.
[2:35:58.120 --> 2:36:05.120]  Tucker Carlson is the most watched news personality in the history of prime time news is the number
[2:36:05.120 --> 2:36:06.520]  one show ever.
[2:36:06.520 --> 2:36:07.520]  Okay.
[2:36:07.520 --> 2:36:10.400]  He's got a big audience and he knows it.
[2:36:10.400 --> 2:36:13.760]  Why did he devote 15 minutes on Friday night?
[2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:17.160]  And I have a conjecture for that.
[2:36:17.160 --> 2:36:24.640]  The Daily Mail had done a story about this about four days before, but still and the Daily
[2:36:24.640 --> 2:36:27.440]  Mail's piece, anyone can find it.
[2:36:27.440 --> 2:36:34.280]  It's talking about the FBI going after Amy Harris currently on charges, not that she
[2:36:34.280 --> 2:36:40.280]  sold a diary, but that she sold the diary.
[2:36:40.280 --> 2:36:45.360]  They're not going after the contents of the diary, the shocking is there, but let me ask
[2:36:45.360 --> 2:36:51.120]  you a question and put on your thinking cap as a media person Owen.
[2:36:51.120 --> 2:36:58.680]  So your Tucker Carlson is the Ashley Biden diary story, the most politically important
[2:36:58.680 --> 2:37:01.360]  story of the day.
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:05.680]  No, politically, politically important, right?
[2:37:05.680 --> 2:37:07.480]  So what's more important?
[2:37:07.480 --> 2:37:11.120]  For instance, you did a great piece at the end of last hour.
[2:37:11.120 --> 2:37:16.760]  You're talking about Russia and the Ukraine war.
[2:37:16.760 --> 2:37:22.720]  The United States and Europe are facing massive economic catastrophe.
[2:37:22.720 --> 2:37:23.720]  Agreed?
[2:37:23.720 --> 2:37:24.720]  Yeah.
[2:37:24.720 --> 2:37:29.520]  I think everybody's seeing that.
[2:37:29.520 --> 2:37:33.440]  Everybody's seeing that gas prices over five bucks a gallon.
[2:37:33.440 --> 2:37:38.400]  That is undoubtedly as horrible as what may or may not not.
[2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:41.440]  I assume she's telling the truth.
[2:37:41.440 --> 2:37:48.720]  Having the Ashley Biden is, is not more politically important than this global economic crisis
[2:37:48.720 --> 2:37:55.760]  or the fact that NATO seem to be pushing Russia into nuclear confrontation.
[2:37:55.760 --> 2:37:56.920]  Would you agree with that?
[2:37:56.920 --> 2:37:57.920]  Yeah.
[2:37:57.920 --> 2:38:01.040]  That's the biggest geopolitical story right now.
[2:38:01.040 --> 2:38:02.040]  Absolutely.
[2:38:02.040 --> 2:38:03.040]  Right.
[2:38:03.040 --> 2:38:09.720]  And I think Tucker is smart enough to realize that, but that being the world's biggest in
[2:38:09.720 --> 2:38:17.840]  terms of survival, political story does not make it the best story to take down Joe Biden
[2:38:17.840 --> 2:38:18.840]  on.
[2:38:18.840 --> 2:38:20.560]  Let me explain.
[2:38:20.560 --> 2:38:26.800]  People, as you know, about half the people in this country are chronically stupid.
[2:38:26.800 --> 2:38:29.840]  They remain in ignorance because they want to.
[2:38:29.840 --> 2:38:36.000]  Half the people out there still would vote for Hillary Clinton if they had a choice.
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:38.360]  Half the people are still proud of Joe Biden.
[2:38:38.360 --> 2:38:39.360]  Right?
[2:38:39.360 --> 2:38:44.320]  I don't know if I'm proud of Joe Biden, but no, the overall I'd say, yeah, most sadly
[2:38:44.320 --> 2:38:48.520]  there is a large, maybe still a majority of people in this country that are completely
[2:38:48.520 --> 2:38:53.280]  ignorant on, on most anything pretty much.
[2:38:53.280 --> 2:38:59.840]  And if you were to bring up nuclear war, a lot of people would be in denial completely
[2:38:59.840 --> 2:39:00.840]  about it.
[2:39:00.840 --> 2:39:07.320]  But, and I think Tucker knows that, and I think Tucker would share the concern we have
[2:39:07.320 --> 2:39:15.400]  with the implications of the war that the U.S. is pushing in Ukraine.
[2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:25.040]  However, I think the reason he devoted time to it on Friday was he realized the Joe Biden
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:29.520]  took a shower with his daughter is easier to understand.
[2:39:29.520 --> 2:39:31.920]  You don't need to know anything about geopolitics.
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:33.960]  And it's in his daughter's own writing.
[2:39:33.960 --> 2:39:34.960]  Right.
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:36.640]  Exactly right.
[2:39:36.640 --> 2:39:40.720]  And few people can do no, no one in there.
[2:39:40.720 --> 2:39:42.560]  I've seen no one defend it.
[2:39:42.560 --> 2:39:47.320]  I've seen people being denied about it and they say, well, it's Tucker Carlson.
[2:39:47.320 --> 2:39:49.240]  I don't believe in anything he says.
[2:39:49.240 --> 2:39:51.680]  I've seen a few people like that on Twitter.
[2:39:51.680 --> 2:39:55.480]  I've seen no one say, so what if it's true?
[2:39:55.480 --> 2:39:56.480]  Big deal.
[2:39:56.480 --> 2:39:57.480]  Right.
[2:39:57.480 --> 2:40:01.160]  Does that make sense?
[2:40:01.160 --> 2:40:03.600]  So I mean, I'm not going to respond to those people.
[2:40:03.600 --> 2:40:06.400]  I mean, obviously we could, we could have the response to those people.
[2:40:06.400 --> 2:40:10.520]  But, but yeah, I mean, certainly liberals and Democrats, they'll deny the truth, you
[2:40:10.520 --> 2:40:13.240]  know, if it smacks them dead in the face, right?
[2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:20.760]  Some of it, but they'll be unable to deny this because this is an ongoing investigation
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:23.040]  and that generates paperwork.
[2:40:23.040 --> 2:40:28.240]  Already the FBI has confirmed this is Ashley Biden's diary.
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:29.240]  Does that make sense?
[2:40:29.240 --> 2:40:30.240]  Yeah.
[2:40:30.240 --> 2:40:36.720]  So as this goes through the legal process, more and more confirmation on this being
[2:40:36.720 --> 2:40:42.880]  Ashley Biden's diary, and then she said that about Joe Biden, I think it's important.
[2:40:42.880 --> 2:40:49.800]  I think to understand why Tucker devoted 50 minutes on Friday to this story.
[2:40:49.800 --> 2:40:54.480]  I think he senses shum in the water with Joe Biden.
[2:40:54.480 --> 2:41:03.680]  Recently, New York Times said a lot of Democrats are saying Joe Biden shouldn't run in 2024.
[2:41:03.680 --> 2:41:12.760]  And I think Tucker Carlson is focusing on this story, specifically, there's not a lot
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:13.760]  new here.
[2:41:13.760 --> 2:41:18.880]  A lot of the information has been out for a while, but he's taking what is the most
[2:41:18.880 --> 2:41:25.040]  devastating and provable, go ahead, deny it.
[2:41:25.040 --> 2:41:29.200]  And he is urging on his show, urge people.
[2:41:29.200 --> 2:41:34.760]  If your reporter asked Joe Biden at a press conference, why did you take a shower with
[2:41:34.760 --> 2:41:36.760]  a daughter?
[2:41:36.760 --> 2:41:39.040]  Can you imagine if that happens?
[2:41:39.040 --> 2:41:44.360]  Well, this is why the White House press pool won't allow anybody in there that's not a
[2:41:44.360 --> 2:41:48.760]  Democrat activist, except Peter Ducey, who manages to get in there.
[2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:52.680]  I don't know how much longer that'll last, or maybe he's cut a deal with them.
[2:41:52.680 --> 2:41:55.480]  As long as they give him access, he won't ask certain questions.
[2:41:55.480 --> 2:42:00.200]  So I mean, it would have to be some sort of an independent journalist off the cuff moment
[2:42:00.200 --> 2:42:04.040]  where it's not a controlled, but pretty much Biden's life is totally in control.
[2:42:04.040 --> 2:42:05.640]  They don't let anybody have access to him.
[2:42:05.640 --> 2:42:06.640]  That's not allowed.
[2:42:06.640 --> 2:42:09.080]  The media has to be a complete Democrat activist.
[2:42:09.080 --> 2:42:11.400]  He doesn't do real press conferences.
[2:42:11.400 --> 2:42:18.400]  So I mean, for that question to be asked to Joe Biden, it's a long shot, I think.
[2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:24.880]  But he said do it at a press availability, which is when he walks out to a helicopter,
[2:42:24.880 --> 2:42:27.000]  or when he walks from an event.
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:32.280]  He was going to have to be one of those kind of gray area moments.
[2:42:32.280 --> 2:42:38.240]  And so the reason I point this out is I'm glad you're covering his story.
[2:42:38.240 --> 2:42:43.280]  It's because it's not that it's the most important story politically, although it's
[2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:44.280]  horrible.
[2:42:44.280 --> 2:42:46.040]  I think Tucker's right.
[2:42:46.040 --> 2:42:52.960]  I think this is a story that if it springs to the surface, imagine if Biden's asked that
[2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:57.600]  and there's no video of him stammering an answer or falling off his bike.
[2:42:57.600 --> 2:43:03.240]  The Internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was right.
[2:43:03.240 --> 2:43:04.760]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:08.960]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:10.640]  I tried to stop it.
[2:43:10.640 --> 2:43:15.680]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[2:43:15.680 --> 2:43:20.840]  the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents.
[2:43:20.840 --> 2:43:23.040]  It's now out in the open.
[2:43:23.040 --> 2:43:28.000]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  Group.
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:32.040]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[2:43:32.040 --> 2:43:35.240]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[2:43:35.240 --> 2:43:36.240]  We're going to win this thing.
[2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:37.240]  God's watching.

[2:45:02.160 --> 2:45:03.160]  been worked out.

[2:45:47.480 --> 2:45:53.040]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil just like
[2:45:53.040 --> 2:45:57.480]  our information is dynamite so are our products info wars store dot com.
[2:45:57.480 --> 2:46:02.120]  The next Jesus is a new film 2000 mules is the most important documentary in modern times
[2:46:02.120 --> 2:46:06.600]  because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election and how they're planning
[2:46:06.600 --> 2:46:11.360]  to steal future elections and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:14.920]  Now it's great that it's online, it's great that millions watched online but you need

[2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:14.400]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:14.400 --> 2:47:25.400]  So we're tapping off this interview with Lee Strain again talking about the Ashley
[2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:32.680]  Biden diary why it's a story again now, how it has, the story itself has examples of the
[2:47:32.680 --> 2:47:38.560]  war on journalism that is ongoing right now within our deep state, within our government
[2:47:38.560 --> 2:47:43.040]  against people like James O'Keefe and groups like Project Veritas not to mention Alex Jones
[2:47:43.040 --> 2:47:48.940]  here in info wars, even Lee Strainahan but we're getting something there right before
[2:47:48.940 --> 2:47:52.360]  we went to the break, Lee I wanted you to finish your comment there before you went
[2:47:52.360 --> 2:47:58.920]  to the break and then also just kind of before we conclude here, I mean there is a story
[2:47:58.920 --> 2:48:03.360]  here while it may not be the biggest geopolitical story and not the biggest political story
[2:48:03.360 --> 2:48:08.080]  at all, I think Americans would want to know if their president is a pedophile child abuser
[2:48:08.080 --> 2:48:13.280]  that might have even done things with his own daughter that might be a significant development
[2:48:13.280 --> 2:48:17.080]  that people want to know about and when you look at the family, when you look at hunter
[2:48:17.080 --> 2:48:22.520]  Biden, when you look at Ashley Biden, something went wrong there, I mean that's not how you
[2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:28.560]  want your kids to grow up to be so we'll kind of finish off with that but Lee you can finish
[2:48:28.560 --> 2:48:32.360]  off your thoughts from the last segment, finish off your thoughts on the war on journalism
[2:48:32.360 --> 2:48:37.200]  before we kind of put a bow on this just looking at the children of Joe Biden and asking ourselves
[2:48:37.200 --> 2:48:47.800]  boy what went so wrong? Well I think a lot of people who are in the audience are, you
[2:48:47.800 --> 2:48:54.440]  know, if you're watching this, you're interested in politics, right? And so sometimes they
[2:48:54.440 --> 2:49:03.040]  get hopeless and you're not on, we cover the news as people who cover the news is sometimes
[2:49:03.040 --> 2:49:08.800]  you have a story, you think we've got this story dead to rights, this should be a big
[2:49:08.800 --> 2:49:15.840]  deal in public and then you see it goes nowhere or they say it gets no traction. I think this
[2:49:15.840 --> 2:49:22.400]  is a story that can get traction because it's easy to understand and although it's not
[2:49:22.400 --> 2:49:30.880]  the biggest story, I'm taking a cue from what Tucker did and I'm saying it is important
[2:49:30.880 --> 2:49:37.920]  to not drop this story. Here's what else. Have you noticed, have you heard about anybody
[2:49:37.920 --> 2:49:43.880]  being banned from social media for talking about the Asher Biden diary? I can't cite
[2:49:43.880 --> 2:49:49.440]  an example. No, I mean, I don't know. Right. You haven't, you haven't heard about it neither
[2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:52.920]  or right. I'm not saying there's one, but I'm saying we probably would have heard about
[2:49:52.920 --> 2:50:02.320]  it if someone was banned from social media. That means unlike some stories, for instance,
[2:50:02.320 --> 2:50:09.520]  the stuff involving vaccines is a bigger story in terms of importance. But can you think
[2:50:09.520 --> 2:50:16.000]  of people who've been banned from discussing vaccines? Plenty. Therefore, if you're urging
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:24.280]  someone to focus on a story, I'm saying everybody on social media should be tweeting about this.
[2:50:24.280 --> 2:50:30.880]  The Asher Biden's diary, they should be tweeting that phrase once a day because there are no
[2:50:30.880 --> 2:50:37.400]  risks that I see, Owen. And then if they do end up banning it, it just becomes an even
[2:50:37.400 --> 2:50:46.320]  bigger story. Yes, exactly right. And this is a story that does not seem to be resulting
[2:50:46.320 --> 2:50:55.000]  in any ban so far. And you're safe. You can do a video, do a blog post, do a tweet, do
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:51:02.580]  a Facebook post, whatever medium you have. What else you can do? Find the diary online.
[2:51:02.580 --> 2:51:09.520]  This is in Asher Biden's diary. She wrote it by hand. Okay, that means you can post
[2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:16.200]  on Instagram. There's pictures you can post. Does that make sense? So it's a multimedia
[2:51:16.200 --> 2:51:23.080]  story. There's plenty of information. There's police reports out there. This is a story
[2:51:23.080 --> 2:51:29.720]  you can and should be talking about. And that's why I'm glad you had me talk about this. It's
[2:51:29.720 --> 2:51:36.040]  not that I think this is the most important story. But ironically, this could be a story.
[2:51:36.040 --> 2:51:41.440]  Do you agree? It's ironic. But this could be a story that brings down Joe Biden.
[2:51:41.440 --> 2:51:46.240]  Well, let me, because, you know, I have to go, it's, if that's the question, you know,
[2:51:46.240 --> 2:51:51.160]  if we're ultimately trying to save this country and we realize Joe Biden is maybe the threat
[2:51:51.160 --> 2:51:54.920]  number one to this country, you say, well, how do we, how do we get rid of the threat
[2:51:54.920 --> 2:51:59.160]  peacefully, politically, legally, lawfully? Well, with the truth, okay, well, what's the
[2:51:59.160 --> 2:52:04.640]  truth with Joe Biden and Ashley? Was he showering with her inappropriately? Was he engaged in
[2:52:04.640 --> 2:52:09.360]  sexual abuse of his own child? Is that what's being recounted in this diary? But here's
[2:52:09.360 --> 2:52:15.220]  what's so frustratingly, it's that, I mean, it's just the truth. Liberals and Democrats
[2:52:15.220 --> 2:52:21.720]  are just liars. They are just liars. And so they show a picture of Donald Trump with Ivanka
[2:52:21.720 --> 2:52:25.720]  on his lap and they say, oh, look, Donald Trump, that's inappropriate. Look at how he
[2:52:25.720 --> 2:52:29.640]  treats his daughter. They show a clip of him saying how beautiful his daughter is. They
[2:52:29.640 --> 2:52:33.640]  say, oh my gosh, look, Donald Trump's a pervert. He says it's about his daughter. Okay, well,
[2:52:33.640 --> 2:52:40.560]  maybe you think that's weird. Maybe it's not so weird. What is weird is Ashley Biden writing
[2:52:40.560 --> 2:52:45.680]  in a diary that she believes it could have been her father inappropriately touching her
[2:52:45.680 --> 2:52:52.800]  and showering with her as a kid that led to her being a sex addict and a sex, you know,
[2:52:52.800 --> 2:52:58.560]  addicted to sex growing up and all the other problems that she's had. But again, maybe
[2:52:58.560 --> 2:53:02.840]  it could pick up traction. Maybe it could be the one, but we're dealing with people
[2:53:02.840 --> 2:53:08.120]  that won't live in reality. They deny reality. They lie through their teeth every day with
[2:53:08.120 --> 2:53:14.320]  every breath they take. It's a lie. They're never going to live those lies down. So yeah,
[2:53:14.320 --> 2:53:19.280]  should America know for the facts? Is Joe Biden a pervert, a pedophile that he sexually
[2:53:19.280 --> 2:53:23.800]  abuses kids? Do we need an investigation? The problem is we're not dealing with people
[2:53:23.800 --> 2:53:27.240]  that deal in reality. We're not dealing with people that are honest. And so they're never
[2:53:27.240 --> 2:53:30.560]  going to be honest about this. They're never honest about anything. So I mean, whether
[2:53:30.560 --> 2:53:35.640]  it's Hunter Biden and all of his sorted details and escapades, or whether it's Ashley Biden
[2:53:35.640 --> 2:53:40.720]  and what she writes in the diary, sadly, even though it should end this corrupt political
[2:53:40.720 --> 2:53:44.880]  family, I just don't think it will leave because we're dealing with Democrats and liberals
[2:53:44.880 --> 2:53:53.120]  who are just 100% bona fide phony liars. So let's talk about some history here. And so
[2:53:53.120 --> 2:53:58.840]  my first work as a reporter was on the John, John Edwards affair story. That's the first
[2:53:58.840 --> 2:54:05.080]  thing I covered as a reporter. Remember that John Edwards was accused and there's a picture
[2:54:05.080 --> 2:54:10.520]  on the National Enquirer of him or the baby who's accused of having an affair. Remember
[2:54:10.520 --> 2:54:21.920]  that story vaguely? But yes. Yes. That story was denied until it wasn't. Another big story
[2:54:21.920 --> 2:54:28.920]  I worked on was the Anthony Weiner sexting story with my friend Andrew Breitbart. And
[2:54:28.920 --> 2:54:35.000]  that story, you remember the press conference for Weiner that Andrew got up on stage during
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:41.520]  the campaign? Sure. Remember that? Oh, yeah. Now that that press conference did not result
[2:54:41.520 --> 2:54:47.400]  in Anthony Weiner resigning. People don't remember that. And Andrew got up on stage.
[2:54:47.400 --> 2:54:56.160]  It was a big hubbub. But Anthony Weiner was still in Congress next week. Hemingway is
[2:54:56.160 --> 2:55:01.920]  a story where he talks about how someone went bankrupt. And he says slowly at first,
[2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:11.680]  then all at once. The way these stories break is Edwards, I remember in the Edwards story,
[2:55:11.680 --> 2:55:19.760]  it was denied, denied, denied until it just wasn't. And you know what's going to happen
[2:55:19.760 --> 2:55:26.080]  on this Biden story? If this ends up taking him down, the people who are just denying
[2:55:26.080 --> 2:55:32.680]  it now will suddenly go. Well, we always knew there was problems. I never trusted him.
[2:55:32.680 --> 2:55:39.640]  They'll there will suddenly be no Biden supporters. The people who defended Anthony Weiner suddenly
[2:55:39.640 --> 2:55:48.440]  got very quiet when he was out of Congress. And so I'm saying to people, I understand
[2:55:48.440 --> 2:55:56.000]  what you're saying, Owen, but we in the Edwards story, eventually he was taken down. Eventually
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:56:02.680]  Anthony Weiner was taken down. Now, you're not going to ever get them completely admitting
[2:56:02.680 --> 2:56:10.560]  a truth. But I think there's sufficient reason to believe that Joe Biden, look at the New
[2:56:10.560 --> 2:56:17.560]  York Times piece. Joe Biden is in some trouble with the Democrats. I think a lot of Democrats,
[2:56:17.560 --> 2:56:22.440]  do you see AOC not endorse Biden in 2024?
[2:56:22.440 --> 2:56:26.800]  Well, that doesn't surprise me as much, but you're still on to something because they
[2:56:26.800 --> 2:56:32.280]  asked all the Senate Democrats, if they would endorse Biden in 2024, only five of them said
[2:56:32.280 --> 2:56:36.720]  yes. So there's no doubt Joe Biden is in big trouble. But there's already an example
[2:56:36.720 --> 2:56:40.360]  of what you're talking about with the Hunter Biden laptop. It was denied, denied, denied.
[2:56:40.360 --> 2:56:44.920]  Now they all accept its fact. But has that really changed anything?
[2:56:44.920 --> 2:56:55.840]  Well, I think until you get near the tipping point, it doesn't tip over. So this is the
[2:56:55.840 --> 2:57:03.240]  case where people watching final 30 seconds here, Lee, final 30 seconds, take it. Don't
[2:57:03.240 --> 2:57:10.280]  give up and don't give in on this one. It's we're near tipping point, I think. Owen, thanks
[2:57:10.280 --> 2:57:15.480]  for having me on. Great talking to you, brother. Lee Stranahan, gay stuff. And ladies and gentlemen,
[2:57:15.480 --> 2:57:19.760]  look who is in the studio with me now. He's just landed from flight hell.
[2:57:19.760 --> 2:57:23.680]  Well, yeah, absolutely. But listen, I'll be back. I got even more stuff I gotta do tomorrow
[2:57:23.680 --> 2:57:27.400]  than I'm back completely Wednesday. Love you guys. Lovely Stranahan. He's such a great
[2:57:27.400 --> 2:57:30.600]  pager, doing such great work. And the great Gerald Salente is coming up right now.
[2:57:30.600 --> 2:57:32.560]  It's real in the flesh, in the flesh.
[2:57:32.560 --> 2:57:33.560]  Not dead yet.
[2:57:33.560 --> 2:57:35.560]  It's Jones.
[2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:42.560]  Gerald Salente takes over. I'll see you guys. I'm hosting the War Room in T minus one hour.
[2:57:42.560 --> 2:57:53.080]  There's an old bed of one saying that's thousands of years old. And it goes like this. Trust
[2:57:53.080 --> 2:57:58.960]  in God, but tie up your camel. Hunter S. Thompson put it this way. Pray to God, but row away
[2:57:58.960 --> 2:58:03.360]  from the rocks. If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get
[2:58:03.360 --> 2:58:07.120]  smashed on them and killed, but also try to row away. You can't just sit there like a
[2:58:07.120 --> 2:58:12.280]  jellyfish. And it's the same thing with our immune system. God helps those who help themselves.

[3:00:09.520 --> 3:00:23.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[3:00:23.600 --> 3:00:29.720]  Good morning, Alex Jones show. Great seeing Alex Jones. Yeah, you have a real warrior
[3:00:29.720 --> 3:00:37.760]  for peace, that man. As I am a warrior for the princes. And we have crazy lunatics leading
[3:00:37.760 --> 3:00:49.440]  us into hell. This is the headline at a business insider. New army chief tells British troops
[3:00:49.440 --> 3:01:00.240]  that they must be capable of defeating Russia in battle. The new chief of British army has
[3:01:00.240 --> 3:01:06.480]  told his troops that they must prepare to fight Russia once again. That's a quote. Prepare
[3:01:06.480 --> 3:01:19.680]  to fight Russia once again. General Sir Patrick Sanders. Oh, Sir Patrick. Oh, yes, Sir Patrick.
[3:01:19.680 --> 3:01:26.560]  Who is this clown? I'm an arrogant guy saying you got to go to war. Hey, generals, you're
[3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:35.400]  always fighting the last war. You see a picture of this guy with all this military drag with
[3:01:35.400 --> 3:01:48.440]  these ribbons and all of these metals. Bunch of garbage. General Sanders took up his position
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:55.960]  today and addressed all ranks and civil servants, civil slaves, little clowns that we paid.
[3:01:55.960 --> 3:02:06.040]  Oh, that was the former guy that went away. The prince or the king or whatever. Anyway,
[3:02:06.040 --> 3:02:14.440]  the queen's husband. That other guy. Sanders there. Patrick Sanders. I want to see who
[3:02:14.440 --> 3:02:24.400]  related to Bernie Sanders because more PS just coming out of a different mouth. Sand crap.
[3:02:24.400 --> 3:02:33.200]  We are the generation that must prepare the army to fight in Europe once again. This guy
[3:02:33.200 --> 3:02:40.120]  is out of his mind. Hey, dumbbell. Hey, moron. Hey, imbecile. You want to bomb the hell out
[3:02:40.120 --> 3:02:47.840]  of Europe again? Oh, Selenki, calm down and be as proper as the English are. You see the
[3:02:47.840 --> 3:02:59.400]  way he's dressed and he's a sir. All you are or is a little nobody. Look at those eyes,
[3:02:59.400 --> 3:03:07.440]  man. He had the eyes of it. A freak. Are you going to bomb the hell out of you? Oh, no,
[3:03:07.440 --> 3:03:16.560]  no, Selenki. When the Russians know we have all our troops there, they will bow down.
[3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:24.320]  Like all the people should bow down to the crap spewing at a sir's mouth. Sir, what a
[3:03:24.320 --> 3:03:34.320]  bunch of garbage. They throwed it. The honorable, the sir, the official piece of crap. This
[3:03:34.320 --> 3:03:42.000]  guy. Oh, the sun never set on the British Empire. We've had thousands of years of murdering
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:51.760]  people all over. Well, not thousands, just 700. Look at this. Look at this clown. Look
[3:03:51.760 --> 3:04:00.760]  at this stupid garbage. Hey, you like that military drag? I got that ribbon for bowing
[3:04:00.760 --> 3:04:09.040]  down to the queen and she said me. And I got those metals. I don't know how many people
[3:04:09.040 --> 3:04:16.800]  I killed or told others to go do it. And now I'm spewing my crap out there and the mainstream
[3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:22.920]  media is swallowing it and shoving it back to you. And you swallow it too because no
[3:04:22.920 --> 3:04:30.480]  one's talking about peace. No one's talking about peace. You know why? Because they are
[3:04:30.480 --> 3:04:39.280]  pieces of crap. They're taking us to World War Three. It's already begun. If we don't
[3:04:39.280 --> 3:04:46.120]  unite for peace, we're going to die in war. How can a guy with anybody with a brain bigger
[3:04:46.120 --> 3:04:58.120]  than this clown listen to him? We'll be right back. And remember, support him for wars.

[3:06:37.560 --> 3:06:47.760]  fed to spew out to the people. One war after another. Remember the main? Oh, I think the
[3:06:47.760 --> 3:06:54.600]  first group gave us that one. Spanish-American war. Oh, yeah. The one that never happened
[3:06:54.600 --> 3:07:00.440]  but they said it did. Oh, remember the main? No, I remember the Gulf of Tonkin incident.
[3:07:00.440 --> 3:07:11.600]  Oh, yeah. The one in Vietnam War killed nearly 60,000 Americans. Wounded about another 250,000
[3:07:11.600 --> 3:07:17.920]  and hundreds and hundreds of thousands, mentally ill from what happened over there. Oh, and
[3:07:17.920 --> 3:07:24.760]  spraying at place with Agent Orange. There he is, another lying piece of scum crap. Robert
[3:07:24.760 --> 3:07:33.480]  McNamara. May you rot in hell. Along with Woodrow Wilson, Harry, let's bomb the hell
[3:07:33.480 --> 3:07:40.600]  out of Japan with atom bombs after they were going to sign a peace treaty. We got mentally
[3:07:40.600 --> 3:07:51.680]  ill people running the world. Oh, I forgot. How about, you know, there's one clown after
[3:07:51.680 --> 3:07:58.000]  another. This is the slime ball. Oh, he's from Princeton. Harvard Princeton. Yeah, but
[3:07:58.000 --> 3:08:05.640]  at bombs and banks, he was the president of Princeton. You become a prince. If you go
[3:08:05.640 --> 3:08:11.200]  to Princeton, you're a member of the club. That's the slime ball that gave us the Federal
[3:08:11.200 --> 3:08:17.200]  Reserve. And we're going to talk about that later. That's the slime ball, as they said,
[3:08:17.200 --> 3:08:26.120]  got us into World War One. And that's the slime ball that gave us federal income tax.
[3:08:26.120 --> 3:08:34.400]  This is an ancient history. Well, for most people it is because they can't remember anything.
[3:08:34.400 --> 3:08:39.680]  And talking about other slime balls that got us into war, that little daddy's boy, that
[3:08:39.680 --> 3:08:46.920]  little, little nothing of a clown, George W. Bush. Yeah. Oh, you forgot Saddam Hussein
[3:08:46.920 --> 3:08:52.840]  and weapons man of destruction. Oh, he picked up the lie from his father. Oh, those, those
[3:08:52.840 --> 3:08:57.720]  are Rockies that going into Kuwait and they're going into the hospitals and stabbing babies
[3:08:57.720 --> 3:09:04.560]  and incubators. Oh, yeah. You remember that they made up that line too. It was a lie. I'm
[3:09:04.560 --> 3:09:10.200]  mentioning this because that's the propaganda they're feeding us now. He could take that,
[3:09:10.200 --> 3:09:23.320]  that, uh, you're a corn. You know, he could stick it up in the air. Yeah. You know what
[3:09:23.320 --> 3:09:28.280]  they're doing to us? Look at this. How could anybody with a brain bigger than a P believe
[3:09:28.280 --> 3:09:35.360]  this clown? Oh, only 88% of America's believed him when he started the Afghan war. We're
[3:09:35.360 --> 3:09:43.360]  going to get that guy with some of it alive. It's a freak show and we have freaks running
[3:09:43.360 --> 3:09:57.040]  and ruining our lives. $57 billion of our money has gone to fight the Ukraine war. As
[3:09:57.040 --> 3:10:04.640]  the roads are rotted, homeless all over the place. My buddy just came back from Houston
[3:10:04.640 --> 3:10:11.280]  and he told me, he said, homeless all over the place. Get a roll of everywhere. Business
[3:10:11.280 --> 3:10:20.480]  is a dead. They killed him with the COVID war. And now they're giving us this war. People
[3:10:20.480 --> 3:10:32.440]  better get it in their mind. These people are mentally ill. They're lunatics. Yep, nice.
[3:10:32.440 --> 3:10:41.720]  America landed a free land of opportunity destroyed by the military industrial complex
[3:10:41.720 --> 3:10:51.520]  worn by General Dwight, the Eisenhower, January 17th, 1961 is farewell address. Telling America
[3:10:51.520 --> 3:10:57.240]  farewell. The military industrial complex has robbed the nation of the genius of the
[3:10:57.240 --> 3:11:02.120]  scientists, the sweater labors and the future of the children. And Eisenhower thought that
[3:11:02.120 --> 3:11:12.760]  we would stop it. No. Propaganda, propaganda. That's the name of the game. Gas stations
[3:11:12.760 --> 3:11:25.920]  in Oslo selling unleaded fuel. The $10 and 30 cents a gallon. And who's the Federal Reserve
[3:11:25.920 --> 3:11:42.600]  blaming on this? Ukraine war. As our inflation rate hits 40 a hives. This is going on before
[3:11:42.600 --> 3:11:53.880]  the Ukraine war. They made a bad situation much worse. Putting these sanctions on Russia,
[3:11:53.880 --> 3:12:00.200]  the height of stupidity. But again, name me a war that America's won since World War
[3:12:00.200 --> 3:12:07.960]  II. Show me one brilliant thing that any of the administrations have done to improve the
[3:12:07.960 --> 3:12:15.160]  lives of we the people. Oh, oh, they just passed a new defense budget. Yeah, it's near
[3:12:15.160 --> 3:12:27.480]  $900 billion. And they had a 26. The people had a vote on it to get it out of the committee.
[3:12:27.480 --> 3:12:36.680]  Only three voted against it. Tens of trillions of dollars to go fight these wars. The Afghan
[3:12:36.680 --> 3:12:49.160]  war, the Iraq wars, the Libyan war, Syrian war. Could you imagine if that money went
[3:12:49.160 --> 3:12:55.720]  into the economy? Can you imagine if that money, if we brought home the troops, secure
[3:12:55.720 --> 3:13:01.800]  the homeland, stop all these people from coming in when we can't take care of our own, as
[3:13:01.800 --> 3:13:07.320]  you can see out in the streets. Oh, and by the way, all those homeless people out there,
[3:13:07.320 --> 3:13:13.960]  how come they're not dying of COVID? How come the hospitals are filled up with COVID? I guess
[3:13:13.960 --> 3:13:21.800]  they can't afford to go to McDonald's or Burger King. Oh, it's Coke is better than Pepsi. This
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:30.040]  is America, not in my America. We got to bring this country back. And the way we do it is
[3:13:30.040 --> 3:13:36.360]  we have to do away with the military industrial complex. We have to put that money into building
[3:13:36.360 --> 3:13:44.200]  America. America first and only. No foreign entanglements said George Washington, who these
[3:13:44.200 --> 3:13:49.400]  clowns couldn't compare to. A real man that crossed the Delaware, remember to go fight?
[3:13:50.680 --> 3:13:56.600]  Yeah, Washington crossed the Delaware. What did Delaware, boy? What did Delaware?
[3:13:56.600 --> 3:14:03.480]  That was a song. Take it easy. She wore a brand new jersey. It was Perry Cuomo song.
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:09.320]  What the Delaware? Probably can't sing that anymore. What do you mean Delaware, anything?
[3:14:13.320 --> 3:14:19.480]  Anyway, a real man who warned us that not to get involved in foreign entanglements,
[3:14:20.120 --> 3:14:25.080]  particularly in Europe, he goes on to say you shouldn't take aside whether you like or just
[3:14:25.080 --> 3:14:32.200]  like a nation. What's going on in Ukraine is none of my business. I'm an American. It's been
[3:14:32.200 --> 3:14:37.240]  going on a thousand years back and forth with them. And we're not going to fix it. Show me one
[3:14:37.240 --> 3:14:43.080]  thing we fixed. The roads are busted. The ridges are rotting. We're going to fix this war.
[3:14:46.120 --> 3:14:49.480]  I'm holding a rally. Peace and freedom rally.
[3:14:49.480 --> 3:14:56.520]  Saturday, July 23rd, up here in Kingston, New York, on the four corners of freedom, Crown and
[3:14:56.520 --> 3:15:05.160]  John Street, Jojana Napolitano, Scott Ritter, Gary Noe. Of course, I'll be there in the hot damn
[3:15:05.160 --> 3:15:10.600]  band. Food, music, it's free. They've come out of the food you got to pay for them.
[3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:12.440]  What do you want to eat and drink? We have vendors.
[3:15:12.440 --> 3:15:21.880]  Go to OccupyPeace.com, OccupyPeace.com, the movement I started. Close down the bases overseas,
[3:15:21.880 --> 3:15:28.440]  the 800 of them in about 80 countries. Bring home the troops, secure the homeland.
[3:15:30.280 --> 3:15:33.080]  Put them to work rebuilding our rotted infrastructure.
[3:15:33.080 --> 3:15:40.680]  Yep. And do you want to have war? There we go. Peace and freedom rally.
[3:15:42.200 --> 3:15:46.840]  You want to have war? Let the people vote. We're the ones who fight for the war with our money
[3:15:46.840 --> 3:16:04.120]  and our lives, not the Biden boys. We'll be back. Stay tuned.
[3:16:16.840 --> 3:16:22.440]  I'm in my 60s, and I do the work of 25, 30-year-olds, and I work them into the ground,
[3:16:22.440 --> 3:16:26.040]  and you want to know why? And I've tested this, and I've taken your B12,
[3:16:26.040 --> 3:16:31.560]  and let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price. I really do. I take that B12,
[3:16:31.560 --> 3:16:37.160]  and I am electric, man. I can run 10 miles. I did some pretty heavy work with the highway
[3:16:37.160 --> 3:16:42.840]  department, and my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his 60s,
[3:16:42.840 --> 3:16:48.440]  you know, pushing 70, and I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B12 saves my life.
[3:16:56.200 --> 3:16:59.320]  The globalists are making their move. Their great reset is here.
[3:16:59.880 --> 3:17:03.720]  They're coming for your children. They're coming for the value of your currency.
[3:17:03.720 --> 3:17:08.520]  They're coming for your national sovereignty. They're coming for your very bodies with their
[3:17:08.520 --> 3:17:15.320]  biomedical tyranny. They're coming for your free speech. They're coming for your privacy,
[3:17:15.320 --> 3:17:19.880]  and, ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative
[3:17:19.880 --> 3:17:25.160]  in government that you and your fellow Americans choose. The new film, the seminal film, the most

[3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:15.880]  private companies twitter and alphabet facebook so they could do what they want but then he makes
[3:34:15.880 --> 3:34:22.280]  the point how they're now seeing all those correspondence going back between twitter
[3:34:22.280 --> 3:34:29.320]  and the united states government and how they're working together so if they're working together
[3:34:30.200 --> 3:34:35.400]  then they're working with the government so it's no longer private corporation that could be telling

[3:51:45.960 --> 3:51:52.440]  ukraine and would like to see russia weakened and isolated that's what he said
[3:51:54.920 --> 3:52:01.960]  back right after the ukrain war began in february 24th our policy is unequivocal
[3:52:02.760 --> 3:52:06.760]  that we will do whatever we can to help ukraine succeed
[3:52:06.760 --> 3:52:14.520]  we need to keep giving them support military support
[3:52:16.920 --> 3:52:27.800]  and strong economic sanctions to improve their position their posture at the negotiation table
[3:52:27.800 --> 3:52:35.560]  all right all right you just heard it more weapons of death to keep

[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:20.280]  trillions of dollars pumped into the system by the trump administration to fight the covid war
[3:53:20.280 --> 3:53:27.320]  the biden administration's 1.9 trillion no not two trillion salinity
[3:53:27.320 --> 3:53:31.400]  but say 1.9 trillion this way the people think we'll be less than two trillion
[3:53:33.000 --> 3:53:35.480]  and zero in negative interest rate policy
[3:53:39.560 --> 3:53:46.120]  we are headed for the worst financial crisis in human history
[3:53:46.120 --> 3:53:53.560]  they've made a terrible situation worse look what they're telling the people over there in germany

[3:54:05.400 --> 3:54:09.560]  there's biden who also said
[3:54:09.560 --> 3:54:19.720]  that when he put these on the sanctions that they would hurt putin and not the people
[3:54:22.760 --> 3:54:29.640]  when is everybody going to grow up and understand the system that we have in place
[3:54:29.640 --> 3:54:41.240]  the domo craps and the repulsive kins are imbecilic morons with few exceptions

[3:58:51.720 --> 3:58:57.320]  i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard dr group on
[3:58:57.320 --> 3:59:02.040]  your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival shield the x1 and
[3:59:02.040 --> 3:59:06.040]  it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that you had you know with a
[3:59:06.040 --> 3:59:10.120]  deep virgin source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and then in two
[3:59:10.120 --> 3:59:16.520]  weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know i could think
[3:59:16.520 --> 3:59:21.960]  again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years i got my
[3:59:21.960 --> 3:59:25.880]  health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're they're all
[3:59:25.880 --> 3:59:30.360]  absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout it literally like if you
[3:59:30.360 --> 3:59:35.080]  want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves
[3:59:35.080 --> 3:59:39.560]  clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take
[3:59:39.560 --> 3:59:44.440]  our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so much for your call and god
[3:59:44.440 --> 4:00:05.800]  speed if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
