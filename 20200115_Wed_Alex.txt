[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  292 days left until the 2020 election this November.
[00:11.000 --> 00:16.000]  It's Wednesday, January 15th, 2020, and we're alive.
[00:16.000 --> 00:19.000]  We're human beings that have a destiny.
[00:19.000 --> 00:25.000]  If we take our destinies in our hands and don't let others govern our destinies.
[00:25.000 --> 00:33.000]  I was thinking about how Friday and Sunday in the last few days we broke those videos
[00:33.000 --> 00:41.000]  at InfoWars and Band-Aid video that showed the UN's top scientists admitting vaccines are killing people
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.000]  and they've been covering it up and that their own doctors think vaccines are bad.
[00:48.000 --> 00:55.000]  And then all those other top scientists for 20 hours agreeing.
[00:55.000 --> 01:02.000]  We posted the video and now it's about 600,000 people watched it on Band-Aid video.
[01:02.000 --> 01:11.000]  But the real story is that Google and Twitter and Facebook are blocking people
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  trying to even link to the raw UN video itself on the UN site.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  They're signed on to pure evil.
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  But we already knew that, didn't we?
[01:22.000 --> 01:31.000]  We already knew that Google and Apple and all of them are moving to China
[01:31.000 --> 01:38.000]  and have endorsed the most evil authoritarian regime the planet has ever seen.
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  And that that's a benchmark for what they're shooting for.
[01:42.000 --> 01:49.000]  As the UN openly adopts the Chinese Communist Global Social Credit Score officially two weeks ago
[01:49.000 --> 02:01.000]  as a planetary control system, tax and control operation of humanity is waking up
[02:01.000 --> 02:10.000]  and their attempts to suppress the truth I believe will fail because time and time again throughout history
[02:10.000 --> 02:16.000]  evil has looked like it's going to win right up to the last moment and that's finally
[02:16.000 --> 02:23.000]  when the people awaken out of their slumbers to the challenge yet again.
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.000]  And I think about our ancestors and all they've gone through to bring us to this point
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.000]  and the great human saga, the march to the stars and beyond
[02:33.000 --> 02:42.000]  and deep in my heart I know in the end the technocrats will fail but many billions will die in the process.
[02:42.000 --> 02:48.000]  And on the other side we'll look back and ask how did we ever let evil get this far?
[02:48.000 --> 02:55.000]  And we'll have to look in the mirror and realize it was because of us all these bad things happened
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.000]  because good men have to stand down to let evil triumph.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  But it will be because of the actions we take now that we rectify that
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  and one day can stand before the creator of the universe
[03:08.000 --> 03:18.000]  and hopefully measure up enough to go to the next level.
[03:18.000 --> 03:25.000]  Yes, reality is way more epic than anyone could try to put into words
[03:25.000 --> 03:34.000]  and here we are on the precipice of choosing the direction of our civilization forever.
[03:34.000 --> 03:41.000]  I have to say yet again that in full wars is 100% been the tip of the spear
[03:41.000 --> 03:47.000]  and again I don't say that to say oh look we're the tip of the spear aren't we great?
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  It's actually a great responsibility.
[03:51.000 --> 04:00.000]  In fact it was Paul Watson about four years ago that began to really expose the in cell movement as being the mass shooters.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  Others on the internet had pointed it out and then Paul magnified it, in full wars magnified it,
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  drug linked to our stories.
[04:06.000 --> 04:15.000]  And now the FBI and the Texas State Police have come out and said actually almost every mass shooter has been a in cell
[04:15.000 --> 04:24.000]  involuntarily celibate into the occult driven by an ideology of hatred for humanity and depopulation
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  and of course Satanism.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  Now it isn't that in full wars had some magical crystal ball.
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  It was that we were tracking who people were and of course law enforcement knew this as well
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  but the ADL was still in control and was telling us it was all Christians that were the enemy and gun owners.
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  Well now all that's been thrown to the side and law enforcement's openly publishing the truth.
[04:47.000 --> 04:54.000]  And the truth is it's Antifa leftist in cell needle dicks out of the problem.
[04:54.000 --> 05:15.000]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by info wars life. Our organic formula is made from high quality natural ingredients such as valerian root extract, L tryptophan, lemon balm leaf extract and melatonin.

[06:10.000 --> 06:24.000]  Big brother mainstream media government cover ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars dot com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[06:24.000 --> 06:40.000]  Five nuclear arms states must work together to neutralize the threat of global war says Vladimir Putin. Bearing an annual state of the nation address. It took place just hours ago.
[06:40.000 --> 06:55.000]  We're going to be playing part of that speech coming up and reading some of the Russian and English translations. That's what's going on on the planet Earth. Remember, there's not just the United States.
[06:55.000 --> 07:14.000]  But an entire planet struggling against corporate tyranny that is establishing systems of communist control and divide and conquer over populations.
[07:14.000 --> 07:26.000]  Well, the governor of Virginia has done exactly what we said he would do. First, he declared an emergency.
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  Inside the capital.
[07:29.000 --> 07:36.000]  And said, you can't have guns there when there's going to be a large pro second amendment rally.
[07:36.000 --> 07:57.000]  And then he said, now I declare it on the capital, the capital grounds. And I predict he's going to declare a bigger emergency. And we've got some of those newscasts coming up for you here in just a moment.
[07:57.000 --> 08:08.000]  Despite massive protest. Virginia Democratic gun control bills go full steam ahead.
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  Pass first hurdle.
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000]  Remember those headlines from info wars and natural news a few months ago. Here's one from December.
[08:17.000 --> 08:23.000]  Virginia governor plans to use roadblocks and UN troops to seize guns.
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  They're talking about using UN and using troops.
[08:27.000 --> 08:35.000]  And every time we go, that's crazy. That's dangerous. They go, oh, we don't mean that.
[08:35.000 --> 08:40.000]  So they're just getting you in the habit of hearing that term emergency.
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  And then the emergency begins to expand.
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  You're like, why would they want to pick a fight with gun owners?
[08:47.000 --> 09:01.000]  They're going to be so incendiary. Well, that's the whole point. And then we learned from the Bernie Sanders campaign operative that they're going to burn down Milwaukee at the DNC.
[09:01.000 --> 09:17.000]  We're in full wars will be where I will be if Sanders doesn't get the nomination. And then if Trump wins, they're going to burn it there and the fires will spread from that summer of rage across the nation. There will be an overthrow of the government.
[09:17.000 --> 09:33.000]  The force will be under communist control and they will then arrest white males and put them in reeducation camps. And of course, some will have to be killed and the police will have to be killed until they learn to submit.
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.000]  Turns out this individual has been arrested for all sorts of things and lives in his mother's basement.
[09:39.000 --> 09:54.000]  Now, some folks live in their mother's basement, take care of their mother, but it's just with these guys, the same thing always applies. And we have these Texas domestic terrorism threat assessment, a big old thick report that we scan through this morning, unclassified version.
[09:54.000 --> 10:05.000]  And I pretty much agree with everything I did read. I've only read maybe 20 pages of the 41 scanning over it because I just learned about this morning from national file dot com.
[10:05.000 --> 10:12.000]  Those guys are on the job. Let me tell you. And so we basically post everything the national file comes out with. We appreciate them letting us do that.
[10:12.000 --> 10:22.000]  The great Tom Papert that's one of the owners of it. And so that is a big, big, big, big, big, big, big deal. It's a huge deal.
[10:22.000 --> 10:34.000]  Texas government forewarns incel rebellion says incels are emerging domestic terrorism threat. And then they go through chronicling how most every mass shooting is the same ideology.
[10:34.000 --> 10:40.000]  Leftist anti human. They want to depopulate.
[10:40.000 --> 10:48.000]  They hate women because women don't like them. And then the thing the media advertises for them to do is go out and kill people.
[10:48.000 --> 11:00.000]  And so the guy at the Walmart was not a right winger. He was an incel leftist radical environmentalist, the guy in Ohio the same day, devil worshiper, actual member of Antifa, huge Bernie supporter.
[11:00.000 --> 11:12.000]  He's got so crazy with the demonic evil he just wanted to go kill. And folks with the guns stopped him. So you see the incel types and the other anti folks killing their wives.
[11:12.000 --> 11:18.000]  And saying I'm doing this so Trump will take the guns from the Republicans so we can kill them all.
[11:18.000 --> 11:27.000]  They don't even think through the logic of them being honest. We're going to kill people guns so we can take your guns so we can kill you.
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.000]  They're even being honest about now. Just lay down your weapons and we're going to kill you.
[11:33.000 --> 11:43.000]  After we torture you in a reeducation camp. This is the mainline Democrat policy now. No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[11:43.000 --> 11:51.000]  Trump's bad for saying America exists. They're now eating their own Bernie Sanders turning on women supposedly we're told.
[11:51.000 --> 11:59.000]  But really it's all just a made up thing from Pocahontas who's a congenital liar saying that he told her once women can't win the presidency.
[11:59.000 --> 12:05.000]  This is them eating their own. It's all coming up when I start the next segment, but I want to go to some Caitlyn Bennett here.
[12:05.000 --> 12:13.000]  So I want to feature our great reporters more and more air on air. She's followed a bunch of incredible reports at Bandot video in her section going viral now.
[12:13.000 --> 12:21.000]  But this is what we're up against. Anti Trumpers can't find what on a map. They can't find Iran on a map.
[12:21.000 --> 12:31.000]  This is illustrating the vicious dangerousness of these willfully ignorant morons who can't find their ass with both hands.
[12:31.000 --> 12:41.000]  So here's part of that report and we'll be back. I'll go right through the systematic plans of the governor of Northam in the deep state and try to trigger a civil war in Virginia coming up in the next few months.
[12:41.000 --> 12:49.000]  I'll be in DC this weekend and next week for the trial of the president in the Senate and in Virginia on the 20th there.
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  So we'll be covering it all live here, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for your support.
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  But I want to just show you what Caitlyn Bennett's up to.
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.000]  We have a map here. We were wondering if people can point to Iran on the map.
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  I'm going to say.
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.000]  The glasses, they don't have a lens.
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  What does this matter? I don't understand.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  I don't understand why this matters.
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  No, neither. No.
[13:24.000 --> 13:31.000]  No.
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.000]  We all know the left have become foreign policy experts overnight.
[13:35.000 --> 13:42.000]  We're here in Toledo, Ohio at the Trump rally to see if leftists can even point to Iran on a map.
[13:42.000 --> 14:01.000]  Right here, by the way.
[14:01.000 --> 14:05.000]  What do you think about what's going on with Iran?
[14:05.000 --> 14:13.000]  Well, that scares me also because I feel Trump has a mental illness and he's narcissistic.
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  I feel that everything he is doing is for his benefit only.
[14:19.000 --> 14:29.000]  I think a lot of other people feel that way and I think anyone who works in the mental health field is aware that he has a narcissistic personality disorder.
[14:29.000 --> 14:36.000]  We're doing a little quiz. We're asking people if they can identify Iran on the map.
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.000]  You do that because I won't find it.
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  I won't find it.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  Saudi Arabia.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  I got Saudi Arabia. I was close.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  What do you think about the Iran situation?
[14:54.000 --> 15:01.000]  I think that there's no way a sitting president should be able to assassinate someone like that without passing it through anything.
[15:01.000 --> 15:07.000]  I think that war in Middle East, spending trillions of dollars in war in Middle East is pointless and evil and dangerous,
[15:07.000 --> 15:13.000]  especially when it's not only endangering American lives and soldiers, it's wasting our money and it's endangering lives in the Middle East.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  Can you tell me where Iran is on the map?
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  Oh, no. Absolutely not. No.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  Can you guess?
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  I can guess.
[15:21.000 --> 15:30.000]  That looks like it's somewhere around there.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  You pointed to the water.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  No, I pointed to the countries.
[15:35.000 --> 15:45.000]  I'm against our current policy in Iran and I am for peace and I think that the Iranians have acted with restraint.
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  The Iranians have had restraint, as you said.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  Yes.
[15:51.000 --> 15:58.000]  U.S. intelligence sources say there is new evidence that Iran shot down a civilian passenger jet in its own airspace, killing many of its own citizens.
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  I can help you too.
[16:15.000 --> 16:20.000]  No taxes you can't pay. Don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[16:36.000 --> 16:48.000]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garishments. Sometimes in the same day, we even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:50.000 --> 17:03.000]  Oh, can I ever? We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS. Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[17:03.000 --> 17:13.000]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.

[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  We're fighting to win and we are winning. Thanks to you.
[18:59.000 --> 19:15.000]  It's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know. Everybody is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it.
[19:15.000 --> 19:28.000]  And they get the worst case of the flu of their life. But still, like concentration camp victims, they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections.
[19:28.000 --> 19:39.000]  It doesn't matter that studies, mainline government studies in Canada and Europe show that when you take the flu vaccine, it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity.
[19:39.000 --> 19:49.000]  It goes on and on. Or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation at the flu vaccine has never, ever even worked.
[19:49.000 --> 20:10.000]  But how do you prop up a hoax? You keep the giant hoax going. No wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now.
[20:19.000 --> 20:32.000]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[20:32.000 --> 20:57.000]  The social engineers know they're losing. One of their only gambits is to try to trigger a civil war in America. And we know from WikiLeaks, we know from their own internal documents that we have received, we know from the terrorism reports coming out from the state of Texas that they are trying to trigger that.
[20:57.000 --> 21:07.000]  And we knew Governor Northam was going to try to declare an emergency. We knew he was going to try to hype it up like people with guns are coming to get them. And so I feel like I had a law enforcement response.
[21:07.000 --> 21:15.000]  Then they stage a false flag or they provocateur an action, Jesse Smollett style, but on steroids.
[21:15.000 --> 21:28.000]  And then they say, look, the gun owners are the evil terrorists. They're the white supremacists. And they run the same operation we saw the Democrat controlled state police did a couple years ago in Charlottesville.
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  Here's the local news reporting on the emergency the governor's declaring.
[21:32.000 --> 21:52.000]  11 an emergency ban on guns at Virginia's capital. Good evening. I'm Sarah Diamond. I'm Josh Smith. The Associated Press reported within the last hour that Virginia Governor Ralph Northam plans to declare a temporary emergency tomorrow, banning all weapons, including guns from Capitol Square and Richmond ahead of a massive rally this plan next week over gun rights.
[21:52.000 --> 22:09.000]  The AP says that's according to two state officials who were briefed on the plans, but not authorized to speak publicly about them. Governor Northam reportedly will announce these plans at a news conference tomorrow afternoon and cite what his administration thinks are credible threats of potential violence and extremism.
[22:09.000 --> 22:20.000]  Well, this comes as Virginia lawmakers are considering several gun control measures across the Commonwealth after Democrats won control of the Virginia General Assembly.
[22:20.000 --> 22:33.000]  And the Democrats said we're going to call off the military. We're going to set up checkpoints. Hell, yes, we'll take your AR 15s. Well, they repeated what Beto said. We reported on all that in the last few months. Everybody else got upset.
[22:33.000 --> 22:43.000]  And even listeners are like Alex, this is going to be more hardcore than you're even saying. Why aren't you making a bigger deal out of it? And I was just not wanting to escalate things and hoping the deep state would back down.
[22:43.000 --> 22:56.000]  But more and more, it becomes very clear they're going to try to pull something in Virginia. And it all starts basically on the 20th.
[22:56.000 --> 23:10.000]  They're going to try to put provocateurs into the crowds. They're going to try to stage something so we can declare a larger emergency and begin gun confiscation and across the state in an attempt to trigger a civil war.
[23:10.000 --> 23:30.000]  So I want to open the phones up for law enforcement, for the military, particularly to give us your take on what needs to be done to stop this, because obviously they try to go out and confiscate guns federally.
[23:30.000 --> 23:40.000]  As a nation, we have to stand up to that. If a governor is trying it and people are like Mohamed Gandhi and turn them in, they won't be able to start their civil war.
[23:40.000 --> 23:48.000]  But they'll just provocateur it, maybe have a sniper shoot some anti-gunners. I mean, this is their playbook.
[23:48.000 --> 23:55.000]  And they're failing on every other front. They already sent somebody to try to kill all the patriot Republicans at their baseball game.
[23:55.000 --> 24:03.000]  They're saying be violent to Republicans. They're saying kill Trump and his family. They're saying kill me. They go to Tucker Carlson's house.
[24:03.000 --> 24:14.000]  And now the FBI and state police in Texas have put out reports saying they're antifa in cells, planning terrorism nationwide to usher in a collapse of the government and trigger a civil war.
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  It's all here. And then you've got the Bernie Sanders operative saying the exact same thing.
[24:18.000 --> 24:25.000]  We've got the old Weatherman reports saying the exact same thing. This has always been their playbook. It doesn't mean it's going to succeed. In fact, it has a long shot at it.
[24:25.000 --> 24:32.000]  But people better know this is real. And I'm just going to say it, we have a good governor, a great governor in Texas.
[24:32.000 --> 24:41.000]  But if the Dems turn the state blue and they're close to it and they tried something like this and wanted to have a big riot and wanted to blame it on President Trump,
[24:41.000 --> 24:50.000]  and they came to take my guns, at this point, I would turn them in knowing they were wanting a civil war.
[24:50.000 --> 24:57.000]  Then that would trigger such a political movement, the state would wake up and go back red.
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.000]  And I'm not telling people turn your guns in in Virginia. That's a decision you've got to make.
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.000]  I'm simply saying we need to try to fix this peacefully. We're winning politically.
[25:05.000 --> 25:11.000]  They want to overturn the chess table and trigger a war with law enforcement that's being ordered to go out and take the guns.
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.000]  And I can tell you 95% of the police and law enforcement, I know national studies show that too.
[25:16.000 --> 25:23.000]  It's over 90% are totally pro-gun and understand that more guns means less crime and they totally get what's happening.
[25:23.000 --> 25:29.000]  But the globalist, when they're in control of a blue state, can march the police off to war.
[25:29.000 --> 25:38.000]  And that's what we're trying to start is a Bunker Hill, 1775, Lessings and Concord, when the Redcoats got ordered to come take the guns.
[25:38.000 --> 25:46.000]  And the local English military had warned them not to try it.
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  But remember what the captain at Bunker Hill said, he said, we don't want a war.
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  So don't shoot first, but if they come for a war, then they're going to get one.
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.000]  And that's what happened. And that's how America was born, 1775.
[26:00.000 --> 26:08.000]  They got their act together in 1776, issued the Declaration of Independence and towards Washington, Mark Stoff, and you know the rest is history.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  So we came out of an attempt to take the guns.
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  Do we want to go ahead and just have that war now while Trump's the president?
[26:16.000 --> 26:23.000]  This is all about overthrowing him, getting civil war going. We don't want civil war.
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.000]  So a guy marched up to Beto in a stage photo of him said, you could take my gun if it saves people.
[26:28.000 --> 26:35.000]  Well, take my guns from my cold dead hands if there's an organized federal takeover that has a chance of really disarming us.
[26:35.000 --> 26:42.000]  And all this, we're going to have to organize with governors and others to understand we're going to have to fight it like 1776.
[26:42.000 --> 26:48.000]  But we don't let them start the fight prematurely. In fact, we try to bypass this whole thing and fix things politically.
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.000]  That's why we have the First Amendment. It comes first.
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.000]  But this is an incredible time. James O'Keefe is also scheduled to join us coming up.
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.000]  And Syrian girl will give us an update and Mike Adams and I really want to take your call.
[27:01.000 --> 27:10.000]  So we're only opening the phones up for law enforcement, particularly in Virginia or the D.C. area.
[27:10.000 --> 27:18.000]  But all over the country to give your take active duty military in the first round of calls.
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  And I won't make you sit on hold a while. James O'Keefe scheduled to come on the next segment, but he usually pushes it back some.
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  So we'll be going to call us next segment of James in here.
[27:26.000 --> 27:32.000]  Soon as he leaves, he's usually only on about 10 minutes or less. We will go to your calls and the toll free number for you to join us.
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, and we'll get you right on air.
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  And you know, you'd think I would have memorized this new number by now. That's on screen for me. Thanks.
[27:41.000 --> 28:01.000]  But I'm just so used to so used to the old number 877-789-2539 and I know that number 877-789 Alex 877-789-2539 for police, for military, for active duty.
[28:01.000 --> 28:09.000]  What is your take on this? What would you do if they ordered you to go take guns? I mean, especially if you're in Virginia.
[28:09.000 --> 28:17.000]  I mean, this is an attempt to start a war. And so it's easy to go. They come for the guns. It's going to start here. Let's get it going.
[28:17.000 --> 28:28.000]  We're winning politically. The left is self-destructing. Just like Trump's going to win out of the Senate trial. It's going to blow up in their face.
[28:28.000 --> 28:33.000]  But notice they want a civil war to start during that Senate trial next week.
[28:33.000 --> 28:39.000]  They'll be on the ground in D.C. and just miles away in northern Virginia where the Revolutionary War kicked off as well.
[28:39.000 --> 28:48.000]  It kicked off in Boston in the north and Virginia in the south. And it's just insane. 877-789 Alex is the number.
[28:48.000 --> 28:58.000]  Your calls are coming up. James O'Keefe on the same story the left went to trigger civil war, martial law, and burned down every major city. How do we stop that?
[28:58.000 --> 29:07.000]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[29:07.000 --> 29:15.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:15.000 --> 29:21.000]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.000 --> 29:32.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:32.000 --> 29:40.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[29:59.000 --> 30:05.000]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Info War, but I know you're like me. You don't want my thanks.
[30:05.000 --> 30:11.000]  You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[30:11.000 --> 30:15.000]  And you know what? I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[30:15.000 --> 30:24.000]  And it's why M4s has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist,
[30:24.000 --> 30:30.000]  because I'm committed to a future for humanity, and I know you are as well.
[30:30.000 --> 30:38.000]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Info War, and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[30:38.000 --> 30:45.000]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family, and for the great crew at Info Wars, I want to thank you all because you are the Info War,
[30:45.000 --> 30:51.000]  and you know that's not just words, that's reality. You have made history. We have made history together.
[30:51.000 --> 30:58.000]  InfoWars.com only has power because of you, and I suggest you use it.
[30:58.000 --> 31:02.000]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers who InfoWars.
[31:02.000 --> 31:11.000]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold,
[31:11.000 --> 31:20.000]  not just here in the U.S. but worldwide, and President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[31:20.000 --> 31:30.000]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China,
[31:30.000 --> 31:39.000]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective,
[31:39.000 --> 31:46.000]  and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way, and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them,
[31:46.000 --> 31:52.000]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[31:52.000 --> 31:58.000]  That's an attempt to demoralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[31:58.000 --> 32:09.000]  Hey, you there. We have a problem. You see, there is a baby. The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready.
[32:09.000 --> 32:19.000]  The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down. The mother starts to have regrets. The father considers leaving town,
[32:19.000 --> 32:32.000]  but a friend says there's a solution. She says to have an abortion. The mother decides to look into it. The clinic assures her it's safe.
[32:32.000 --> 32:42.000]  She's made her decision. She's going to have an abortion. The problem is that baby is you.
[32:42.000 --> 32:52.000]  Join me, Owen Schreuer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th, in Washington, D.C., noon at the National Mall.
[32:52.000 --> 33:01.000]  I'll see you there. It's time to stand up for the unborn. It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[33:01.000 --> 33:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:31.000 --> 33:39.000]  James O'Keefe of Project Veritas is joining us here in just a moment. The governor of Virginia has declared an emergency.
[33:39.000 --> 33:48.000]  They are already passing the laws through the process to ban and confiscate all semi-autos, as well as ammunition,
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  banning gun ranges, you name it, as well as self-defense classes of all different types.
[33:53.000 --> 34:00.000]  Those bills are proceeding in the new Commonwealth legislature there in Virginia.
[34:00.000 --> 34:10.000]  And the governor is basically talking about going ahead and having gun confiscation, going ahead and having gun registration.
[34:10.000 --> 34:18.000]  And he's already declaring an emergency to just get the idea of an emergency going in your head so the deep state can trigger
[34:18.000 --> 34:29.000]  some type of civil unrest that leads to civil war in the region and martial law saying that President Trump is to blame
[34:29.000 --> 34:37.000]  and then removing him while the Senate is in session next week with the trial of the president.
[34:37.000 --> 34:45.000]  All the planets are aligning right now, and our intel was the governor was planning this, and now you see it's beginning to unfold.
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  This is a Jesse Smollett type false flag, but a billion times bigger.
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  I believe they're not going to be getting away with it.
[34:52.000 --> 35:01.000]  You notice that we also have the new Project Veritas bombshell videos with this operative for Sanders right out of the weatherman
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  handbook saying we're going to put people in camps, we're going to be violent.
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.000]  The only way to deal with Trump supporters is violence.
[35:07.000 --> 35:15.000]  You have the Texas Domestic Terrorism Threat Assessment saying incel, leftist, antifa are the main terror threat and they track
[35:15.000 --> 35:22.000]  how all over the country it's been antifa incels tearing out almost all of the mass shootings.
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  So it all ties together.
[35:25.000 --> 35:31.000]  Joining us is James O'Keefe of Project Veritas with just another incredible bombshell.
[35:31.000 --> 35:38.000]  More even coming of the Democrats planning civil unrest starting at the DNC spreading across the country.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  We're not just hearing it for this individual.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  We're hearing it from a lot of them in the past as well.
[35:43.000 --> 35:49.000]  So this is really something James, it looks like, that is at the core of what they're planning.
[35:49.000 --> 35:50.000]  James.
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000]  Yeah, Alex.
[35:51.000 --> 35:57.000]  I mean, this tape is maybe the most shocking statements you'll ever hear from a political campaign ever.
[35:57.000 --> 36:03.000]  This guy is a paid field organizer in Iowa. He's one of the top field organizers, again, paid by the campaign.
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.000]  Currently, we understand still employed by the campaign, which is really extraordinary.
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  In this tape, he's praising Soviet gulags.
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  He's saying that he's on board for gulags.
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  He's up for shooting people who are against the revolution.
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  This is probably the most shocking thing you'll hear in the state.
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.000]  He wants to denazify people through Bernie's public education funding.
[36:25.000 --> 36:33.000]  So he's saying that that's the whole point of funding free tuition and college and schools to change people's behavior.
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.000]  He also says, I'm going to quote him in this video that we just released today,
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  there are things that are more important than the rule of law in the United States.
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  So these are the sorts of things that we might suspect that these people believe,
[36:44.000 --> 36:53.000]  but they're really coming out full bore and revealing who they actually are to our undercover reporters there in the state of Iowa, Alex.
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.000]  And in the same breath, he explains, we need reeducation camps using the old Soviet term.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  Then he says, you know, Stalin did a good job.
[37:01.000 --> 37:02.000]  People actually like these.
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  This is how we teach, you know, everybody, people to bust rocks 12 hours a day.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  They were actually good places, but I will shoot people.
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  But he goes, so that's what the colleges are is reeducation camps.
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  That's why it needs to be free for everybody.
[37:13.000 --> 37:21.000]  So he's admitting what you and I and others have said is colleges are phasing themselves in to open air reeducation camps.
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  Yeah, I mean, it's what we suspect.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  This is the mission of what we do.
[37:25.000 --> 37:31.000]  These people have these really in deep beliefs and they don't express them outwardly.
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  But he says kind of what we all suspect.
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  And it's a failure of our public education system.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  People don't understand what gulags even are.
[37:37.000 --> 37:38.000]  It's amazing to me.
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  Gulags were trending on Twitter because of the expose yesterday.
[37:42.000 --> 37:50.000]  Not everyone knows the horrors, the psychological horror, the terror of a gulag and how they would force people to confess to crimes they didn't commit.
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  This guy says we need to send wealthy people to gulags to break rocks.
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  He even says they had quote conjugal visits in gulag.
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  I mean, and you might say, well, this is one crazy guy.
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  It's one isolated incident.
[38:03.000 --> 38:13.000]  Well, first of all, Alex, as a result of what has been revealed so far, almost all of Bernie Sanders campaign people in a state of Iowa have taken down their Twitter accounts.
[38:13.000 --> 38:18.000]  They've locked their Twitter accounts in reaction to this expose.
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  So that has that is a reaction to having impact.
[38:21.000 --> 38:33.000]  And second of all, Alex, if you know Project Veritas, you know our modus operandi is to release one tape, draw them into saying that it's one person low level, whatever isolated and then reveal more.
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  So we're hoping for a reaction today from the Sanders campaign.
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.000]  We have our people camped outside of their offices.
[38:40.000 --> 38:48.000]  We saw one of your reporters, Owen, was actually asking CNN as they walked into the debate whether they're going to ask Bernie Sanders these questions.
[38:48.000 --> 38:53.000]  And Alex, they did not ask Bernie Sanders any questions about these tapes last night.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  Well, in fact, we then saw through the windows.
[38:55.000 --> 39:02.000]  Anderson went, got the police and then had him basically thrown off campus saying CNN rented the whole campus.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  They admitted they do get public funds.
[39:04.000 --> 39:11.000]  They actually only rented the auditorium. They admitted anybody else could be there, but they said no reporters that weren't authorized.
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  I mean, that's their definition of journalist.
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  And my response is people say, well, where's the media on this?
[39:17.000 --> 39:32.000]  I say, listen, if they don't want to report the news, this is newsworthy, by the way, when you have a paid top field organizer in the state of Iowa praising the Soviet Union and saying that we need to have a conspiracy to murder police before the Milwaukee Convention.
[39:32.000 --> 39:38.000]  Well, guess what? If the media is not going to report that, then we're going to report that and we will become the media.
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.000]  These videos got, I don't know how many, five, six, seven million views in the last 24 hours.
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  Everyone is talking about them and I got them right where I want them, Alex.
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.000]  We got one guy and there are more tapes, more employees.
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  Please do say this is isolated, Bernie Sanders and your campaign stuff.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  I hope they say it's isolated.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  The only thing they can say is that it's isolated.
[40:01.000 --> 40:08.000]  And then when they say that, my next question to them is going to be, what are you going to do when I show more Kyle Jurex in your campaign?
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.000]  What's then the move going to be? What are you going to do about it?
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  And it appears, Alex, the move is they're going to take down all of their Twitter accounts.
[40:15.000 --> 40:24.000]  So this is the first presidential campaign in American history where they take down all of their social media in response to some of the things that they actually believe in.
[40:24.000 --> 40:31.000]  Well, you know, and I know because we're on the ground dealing with this, that main line left at these universities now talk like this.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  They say it to my face, your face.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  They're all over the place saying, we're going to put you in camps.
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  We're going to reeducate you.
[40:36.000 --> 40:44.000]  Obama had it put in the Army Field Manual in 2010 to prepare reeducation camps, even use the Soviet term.
[40:44.000 --> 40:50.000]  And then you have Hillary talking about fun camps, Larry Grathwald infiltrated the weathermen that then trained Obama.
[40:50.000 --> 40:57.000]  And they were there talking saying, we're going to put 50 million people in reeducation camps and kill 25 million of them.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  And these are the leaders of the weathermen.
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.000]  This came out in federal court.
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  So this is really who these people are.
[41:02.000 --> 41:08.000]  Violent Marxist-Lenis revolutionaries foaming at the mouth, salivating for this.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  Well, and that's what they're going to say.
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  They're going to say, we don't actually believe in these things as a crazy guy.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  But I think you hit the nail on the head.
[41:16.000 --> 41:23.000]  It's him saying, you're not going to get Bernie to say gulag, quote gulags, but like all aboard for gulags.
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  There needs to be reeducation for a significant portion of society.
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  That's the intention of gulags.
[41:28.000 --> 41:36.000]  If you're going to fight back against the revolution, he says, we're going to remove you and put you in Siberia where you will learn the effing value of like being a comrade.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  That's what it has to be.
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  Kyle says, quote, I'm an anarcho-communist.
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  I'm as far to the left as you can possibly get.
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.000]  He says, quote, I didn't even count Justin, Justin, me, Derek, Daniel, Jessica.
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  We're all further left than democratic socialists.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  So he's saying that we're all this.
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  This is how we identify.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  You've got to go in a minute.
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.000]  Obviously more big bombshells to drop.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  Can you give us any hints?
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  Yeah, I mean, I think the stuff coming out is even more shocking.
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  We're looking for a reaction from the campaign today.
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  We do believe that we will get one.
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  I think we'll get one today.
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  And as soon as we get that reaction, Alex, their response, there's, of course, there's nothing they can say.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  But as soon as they respond, then we're going to announce the next one.
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  Probably released early next week.
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.000]  It's going to be a series.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  Exposed2020.com.
[42:21.000 --> 42:22.000]  Sign up, get our videos.
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  Exposed2020.com to see the next one that's about to drop.
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  And let me throw this out at you as well in closing.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  Listeners, go to the events.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  Go in, get in the front row and bring it up.
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  Don't let them shut this down.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  They're not responding because they know it's their ethos burning.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  He went to the Soviet Union and praised it.
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.000]  Venezuela and praised it. He is absolutely a Stalin Amal in the offing.
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  James O'Keeffe, we salute you again in Project Veritas.
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  God bless you, my friend.
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  Thank you. See you soon.
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  All right, there goes James O'Keeffe always on fire.
[42:54.000 --> 42:55.000]  Wow.
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  All right, your phone calls are coming up on the governor.
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up.
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.000]  I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity,
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  to see evil running rampant like this,
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.000]  and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace.
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  That most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[43:27.000 --> 43:33.000]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  by spreading the word about newswords.com, infowords.com, and band.video.
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.000]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever.
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.000]  And that if you tell people, hey, the band truth they don't want you to have
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  is at infowords.com forward slash show and band.video.
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  So take heart, folks. They've had to censor everybody to show everybody down
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.000]  because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[43:57.000 --> 44:03.000]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[44:03.000 --> 44:08.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[44:08.000 --> 44:15.000]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[44:15.000 --> 44:20.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.000]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later,
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.000]  we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.000]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[44:39.000 --> 44:44.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[44:44.000 --> 44:49.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[44:52.000 --> 44:57.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[45:23.000 --> 45:29.000]  Vitamin E and the incredible SilverSol formula, Infowars Silver Cream works triple duty,

[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  while smoothing and softening calluses.
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  With none of the harmful ingredients found in other formulas,
[45:45.000 --> 45:50.000]  you can be sure this silver cream is hard at work, promoting the healing of your skin.

[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  And get great products at the same time.
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.

[46:51.000 --> 46:55.000]  Take action now and fund the Infowar for your own future.
[47:01.000 --> 47:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:15.000 --> 47:16.000]  Welcome back.
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[47:18.000 --> 47:25.000]  Well, the Liberty Movement, patriotic, loyal, smart, common sense Americans,
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.000]  have held off the globalist operation for a long time.
[47:29.000 --> 47:32.000]  And now we've retaken the presidency.
[47:32.000 --> 47:39.000]  And our kin, fellow travelers of Liberty,
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  countering the globalist fellow travelers of communism,
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  are winning elections all over the world and turning the tide.
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.000]  So what do the deep states do?
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.000]  The CHICOMS massively increase funding of media operations,
[47:53.000 --> 47:54.000]  not to share it around the world,
[47:54.000 --> 47:59.000]  to propagandize the population against their own countries.
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.000]  And then they try to look at different racial and ethnic groups
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  to play off those groups against each other.
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  And that's what's happening right now.
[48:07.000 --> 48:14.000]  By holdouts, embeds, moles of the Democrats and neocons.
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  Everyone on your phone calls, Joshua Brady, Michael and others.
[48:18.000 --> 48:23.000]  Joshua served for three years in Virginia.
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  He's in Washington right now.
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  Service of police officer couldn't get a better caller.
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.000]  To be able to talk about the governor saying that he's declared first
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.000]  an emergency at the Capitol, then the grounds,
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  because the people are coming with guns,
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  introducing the idea of a civil emergency.
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.000]  Right as the president's trial will undoubtedly be taking place
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  next week in D.C., we'll be there covering both.
[48:46.000 --> 48:47.000]  That's how critical this is.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  And basically my whole main crew is going to be there.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  We're going to have 15 people there.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  We're going to go to your calls in one minute.
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  I just want to say that it takes a lot of money to do this.
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  We are expending our backup reserves to do it.
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  We are going to have a security team of quite a few people up there,
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  including police officers from the locales.
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  And I'll just leave it at that,
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.000]  because this is a major threat area for everybody.
[49:09.000 --> 49:16.000]  Okay, I'm just going to leave it at that.
[49:16.000 --> 49:17.000]  We need to find our operation.
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.000]  Ultimate fish oil is back.
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.000]  When I say ultimate, it's from the natural fjords salmon.
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  It's from the anchovies.
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  It's really good oil.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  And it's from the krill that's amazing.
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.000]  It's big, old, juicy pills of it.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  It's a full model, comparable.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  Stuff like this costs three times as much.
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  It's 33% off back in stock.
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  Ultimate fish oil is so good for your body.
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.000]  So good for your dreams.
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  So good for your energy.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  It's a base for everything.
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.000]  InfoWarsHore.com.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  The prostagard with saupon meadow
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  and a whole bunch of other known compounds
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  that have been proven to help the prostate
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  and help it shrink and help it be healthy
[49:54.000 --> 49:55.000]  and help you not get cancer.
[49:55.000 --> 49:56.000]  You can actually say that about saupon meadow.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  Well, all the other stuff in it's amazing.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  A great formula.
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  It's back in stock and discounted.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  And then this.
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.000]  I've said that varying bottles of knockout,
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  the natural sleep aid with eight known healthy mother nature
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  compounds all in one pill at one low price,
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  varies in strength because it's naturally
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  wildcrafted raw ingredients.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  And some bottles aren't as strong as the others.
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.000]  Some batches aren't.
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  Well, the new batch came in a couple months ago.
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  I hadn't tried it.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  I brought a new bottle home because I was out.
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  I took two.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  I slept for 10 hours like I was a dead man.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  I hadn't slept like that in years.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  And you know, like when you're a teenager or whatever
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  and your body's growing and you can't get out
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.000]  and the bed feels so good.
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  I never feel like that.
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  I mean, I sleep good and get up and stuff,
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.000]  but I'm usually jumping out of bed.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  I get the snooze five times.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  I never do that.
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  It was ecstasy.
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  It was this.
[50:53.000 --> 50:56.000]  And this latest batch is strong.
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  We had a batch a couple of years ago
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  that was kind of like not that strong.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  I told people, I said, this new batch isn't strong.
[51:01.000 --> 51:02.000]  And I talked to the company.
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  They go, yeah, that's how it is with raw ingredients
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  and high quality, high source.
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  It's not a drug.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  It's a natural.
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  It's going to vary.
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.000]  It's like a fish you catch is going to vary.
[51:09.000 --> 51:10.000]  Be the same species.
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  It's still going to vary.
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  Strawberries you pick are going to vary plant to plant.
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  Strawberry is strawberry.
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  This is a really strong batch.
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  And I'm like, why aren't I taking this every night?
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  And that's the thing about the supplements.
[51:21.000 --> 51:22.000]  If you take them religiously,
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  they really will change your life,
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.000]  especially as a fish oil and knockout in the X2 and X3.
[51:27.000 --> 51:28.000]  Okay.
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  I'm going to go to your calls right now.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  I appreciate folks calling in 877-789-2539
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  for law enforcement military.
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.000]  I could easily get up here and act tough
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  and say, well, it looks like 1776 part two,
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.000]  less than concord.
[51:43.000 --> 51:47.000]  They're coming for the guns and the war is going to start.
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  And they're going to find political police
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  that are dumb enough in the state police
[51:51.000 --> 51:54.000]  that the Democrats have handpicked to go do this.
[51:54.000 --> 51:58.000]  And because they want to start a civil war.
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  So if there was ever an organized federal move,
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  they were really taking guns and have the army out.
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  I'm sorry, folks, we got to go to war.
[52:04.000 --> 52:05.000]  Okay.
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  And I'm not looking for that, but I'll go to war.
[52:07.000 --> 52:08.000]  That's not our government.
[52:08.000 --> 52:09.000]  That's criminal.
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  It's un-American.
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  The country was born out of gun confiscation
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  and the fight against it.
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  But the Democrats are trying to start something here.
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  I know our people aren't going to sit there
[52:18.000 --> 52:21.000]  if the cops come to take your guns and shoot a bunch of cops.
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  You've already gotten your guns out, whatever you know.
[52:23.000 --> 52:24.000]  The police know.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  Almost every county has said they're with the people.
[52:26.000 --> 52:27.000]  They'll deputize everybody.
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  The police aren't our enemy.
[52:29.000 --> 52:30.000]  The globalists want to make it that way.
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  They want to start a civil war.
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  We're smart enough to not let this happen.
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  But clearly the deep state is doing it.
[52:35.000 --> 52:36.000]  It's confirmed now.
[52:36.000 --> 52:37.000]  Okay.
[52:37.000 --> 52:38.000]  I'm going to be there.
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.000]  I know you're going to be there.
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  They're going to try to provocateur stuff.
[52:40.000 --> 52:41.000]  How do we stop it?
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.000]  What are they going to pull?
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.000]  What do the police think?
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  We're talking to you right now.
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  Thanks for calling.
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  Joshua in Washington served as a police officer
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  in Virginia for three years in Richmond.
[52:49.000 --> 52:52.000]  Couldn't have a better person to tell us what you think.
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  What do you think?
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  Scared.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  I'll be honest with you, Alex.
[52:56.000 --> 53:00.000]  I have more than a few friends still there that are in law enforcement.
[53:00.000 --> 53:01.000]  Some that are retired.
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  I was born and raised in Virginia.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  Worked for a police department there.
[53:06.000 --> 53:10.000]  City of Richmond for three years and had the sense to get out.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  I'm a recovering Democrat.
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  Had been all my life up until the last stages of Barack Obama.
[53:16.000 --> 53:21.000]  And I just saw the writing on the wall and figured I needed to take another course.
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  I wasn't happy with things that were going on.
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  But this has really got me worried.
[53:25.000 --> 53:28.000]  I grew up in the era of Governor John Dalton.
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  It was a great governor for the state of Virginia.
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  And I look at this guy now and it's not even close.
[53:33.000 --> 53:37.000]  It's not even what I do growing up as a kid.
[53:37.000 --> 53:41.000]  I'm really just concerned with everything going on right now.
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  What do you think of the deep...
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  I mean, clearly they're trying to provocateur something.
[53:45.000 --> 53:46.000]  A, do you agree with that?
[53:46.000 --> 53:49.000]  B, how do you think we de-escalate this?
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.000]  And that's why I'm on air saying, hey, let's not start a shooting war.
[53:52.000 --> 53:55.000]  I'm not... I mean, blisters will be like, what do you mean you'll turn your guns in?
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  I'm not saying turn our guns in.
[53:56.000 --> 54:02.000]  I'm not saying... I'm just saying, how do we not let them trick us into this?
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  I don't think there's a way we can, honestly.
[54:04.000 --> 54:07.000]  I mean, we can do the best we can on our end, but at the end of the day,
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.000]  there's always going to be those people out there that are going to try to do something,
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  make everybody look bad.
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  Richmond's always been a battleground.
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  We know this through history.
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  But yeah, I'm really concerned with things right now.
[54:19.000 --> 54:22.000]  Yeah, both of America's big internal wars started in Virginia.
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  And that's a fact.
[54:24.000 --> 54:28.000]  And I have descended from my family, at least 12 that I know of,
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  that fought in the Revolutionary War.
[54:30.000 --> 54:34.000]  So I'm pretty familiar with the way wars are,
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  and family members that have served in the military.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  But yeah, this has really gotten me concerned.
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  And then we see what's going on in Indiana.
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.000]  They're trying to pass bill saying anything that holds a bullet more than 10 rounds
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  is going to be considered a felony.
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  But again, too many friends that are back there right now,
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.000]  currently serving still are retired that are going to be there
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  on the steps in Richmond.
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  And I hope for the best.
[54:58.000 --> 54:59.000]  I really do.
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  If I could find a way to be here, I would.
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  I'm currently still serving on the west coast of FEMA reason 10.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  But it's really gotten me concerned because I don't think there's anything that we can do or say
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.000]  that's going to change the fact that one or more people coming over there
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  and trying to start something.
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.000]  Well, I want to be clear.
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.000]  The deep state, the Soros people are going to have provocateurs on the ground.
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.000]  They may false flag a group of anti gunners to then paint all pro gunners as terrorists.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  That's not going to fly.
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  But clearly they know Trump is wanting the new America is realigning and waking up.
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.000]  And so I'm not saying if there's ever real gun confiscation,
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  we go along with I'm saying we have to fight it.
[55:36.000 --> 55:39.000]  But we have to fight it politically now really hard to not get to that point.
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.000]  And I'm just saying they're trying to pick Virginia as a place to start this.
[55:43.000 --> 55:44.000]  That's clear.
[55:44.000 --> 55:49.000]  And so I'm just asking how do we somehow not let this happen?
[55:49.000 --> 55:54.000]  I wish I had the answer for you, Alex, because everything I could possibly give you as a possible
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.000]  answer is something that there's going to be a counter to.
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.000]  And I just think at the end of the day, there's going to be people there.
[56:00.000 --> 56:01.000]  They're going to try to start something.
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.000]  I don't believe they're going to be involved in the Patriots side of things.
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  I just think there's going to be people there knowing that there's going to be passionate people there,
[56:09.000 --> 56:15.000]  knowing there's going to be Patriots there to try to initiate something like you've been talking about.
[56:15.000 --> 56:20.000]  Now, there's no doubt that they're so desperate because they're losing politically that this is what they're going to try.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  And that's why I'm going to be there.
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  And we're going to be in DC as well as long as we need to be.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  This is a very historic time.
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.000]  Thank you very much for the call.
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  All right, I'm going to go to break and come back with all the other callers.
[56:31.000 --> 56:37.000]  Michael and Dale and Brady and Willard and Tom.
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  We have active state police in Virginia.
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  Wow, that's a huge call.
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  We're going to go to Willard the minute week.
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  Let's just, well, I've got one minute.
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  Willard, don't hang up.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  We're going to be back in two minutes.
[56:48.000 --> 56:53.000]  I'll go right to you and then to Tom and everybody else.
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.000]  And these times in history happen.
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  Well, we're going into one right now.
[56:58.000 --> 57:02.000]  And there are a lot of powerful forces that think they can use this country's openness to take us down.
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.000]  And if Americans just woke up with the chai comms and others are funding Hollywood to do this,
[57:07.000 --> 57:10.000]  no one would go along with this.
[57:10.000 --> 57:16.000]  But you've got a bunch of idiots in these colleges that don't even know what the three branches of government are
[57:16.000 --> 57:21.000]  who fantasize about some communist takeover as if they're going to be in charge of that.
[57:21.000 --> 57:27.000]  And our tolerance of the left and corruption has led us to this point.
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.000]  I believe through action, political action and prayer that we're going to be able to derail this
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.000]  and have cameras to expose the deep state if they try to pull something.
[57:37.000 --> 57:44.000]  But let me tell you, this is a time for everybody to be as awake as they can be.
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.000]  Stay with us.
[57:45.000 --> 57:53.000]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[57:53.000 --> 57:57.000]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[58:01.000 --> 58:08.000]  So here I am telling people, super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[58:08.000 --> 58:13.000]  And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[58:13.000 --> 58:19.000]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this,
[58:19.000 --> 58:25.000]  they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[58:25.000 --> 58:26.000]  It feels so good.
[58:26.000 --> 58:30.000]  It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[58:30.000 --> 58:49.000]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[58:49.000 --> 58:51.000]  Hey, you there.
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  We have a problem.
[58:53.000 --> 58:56.000]  You see, there is a baby.
[58:56.000 --> 59:00.000]  The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready.
[59:00.000 --> 59:04.000]  The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down.
[59:04.000 --> 59:07.000]  The mother starts to have regrets.
[59:07.000 --> 59:10.000]  The father considers leaving town.
[59:10.000 --> 59:14.000]  But a friend says there's a solution.
[59:14.000 --> 59:18.000]  She says to have an abortion.
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  The mother decides to look into it.
[59:20.000 --> 59:23.000]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  She's made her decision.
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  She's going to have an abortion.
[59:27.000 --> 59:33.000]  The problem is that baby is you.
[59:33.000 --> 59:43.000]  Join me, Owen Schreuer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th in Washington, DC, noon at the National Mall.
[59:43.000 --> 59:44.000]  I'll see you there.
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[59:46.000 --> 59:51.000]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[59:51.000 --> 59:56.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  All right, I'm not going to recap.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  I'll do it again at the start of the next segment about what's happening in Virginia.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  But the governors declared an emergency.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  The Democrats are saying there's going to be a civil war there.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  They said it first.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  We're like, really?
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  And then now it's clear what they're doing.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  They want to do this during the Trump Senate trial to try to have some shooting between the left and right to then paint gun owners as terrorists.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  That's my view.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  That's what pretty much everybody's come to the consensus of.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  We're taking uncensored calls from police officers.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  Got a call from an officer that works on the West Coast that did work in Virginia in Richmond.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  Now we have Willard, active state police in Virginia on the subject of what's coming.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  What's your view on your expert view on this, Willard?
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  And thanks for calling.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Well, Alex, first of all, the people shouldn't be voting in counties to declare sanctuary cities.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  They ought to be arresting this guy.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  Obama's running this program.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  I got people all over the place, friends, cops, military.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  Obama's running this thing and Obama's still running our government.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  There's people in high places in the government and they're told to do what they ignore Trump or they'll indict them.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  And the people are just scared and people are just frustrated.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  But I tell you this, Alex, if they go ahead and go along with this, I'm going to roll with it because the American people are stupid for putting up with it.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  But no, I'm not going to go door to door confiscating. What they're going to do, they'll probably go away quietly and just have people like me pull you over and grab your guns and put you in jail.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  And you know, you're right. The American people have put up with this. Texas is about to turn blue.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  And I tell good old boys, that'll never happen. Yeah, BS.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  Yeah, well, I talked to a neighbor of mine and he kind of sees what's going on too. And his philosophy is just to just act like his guns got stolen so he can bury him in the backyard.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  Well, that's not going to get anything done. And no, I'm not telling everybody to go up there with arms and start shooting more.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  What I'm saying is people need to stop voting and start arresting.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  And until and I'm law enforcement and I'm going to follow the law, even though the law is wrong, I'm going to follow it until people wake up and start arresting.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  This guy should be arrested. Not only should he be arrested, our family fathers would start lining us up right now and start shooting us for letting them get away with this.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  You know, some stations don't carry this first five minutes. Please hold because I want you as a state police officer in Virginia to explain to people what you're seeing because she I've done a lot of research.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  So I know when somebody knows what they're talking about. And I just got chills when you talked about Obama running this because in my research in this a few months ago, we noticed the DNC is involved.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  But that Obama specifically organized the Trayvon Martin response when they kept saying the cops were killing innocent people trying to get martial law going.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  Hey, guys, pull me from yesterday's stack. The article about 2015 Obama plan martial law in Maryland and all that and the FEMA can't plan.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  So when we come back, I want you to specifically talk about what you're being told by others, obviously hire us up.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  I'm guessing that this is being run out of the deep state. It is. And that's the critical last piece because I would have expected incremental civil emergency.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  And then as soon as one or two people get killed, whether it happens by accident or they stage it, it's going to be an emergency statewide.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  And they're going to then activate the leftist to burn cities down and start killing police everywhere to try to get police to line up behind the deep state and say, well, it's your fault.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  You said something else that absolutely put the cherry on top. You said they're threatening all these other people in the government, not just police leaders that will indict all your asses once Trump's gone.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  And that's exactly what's going on behind the scenes. They're threatening everybody. I've been threatened.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  But most people give in to the threat. So when we come back, Willard, will you hold one minute till we come back?
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  Sure.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  All right, because everything Willard's saying, folks, that's why Trump's got to start arresting. That's why the Justice Department's got to move.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  They're not just going to stage a rushing game. They're not just going to state this Ukraine crap. They're not just going to try to get riots going.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  They're going to keep bullying and harassing and suing and death-threading and paying people off to do criminal stuff to people that support Trump.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  I can take it. In fact, I don't enjoy paying, but I do at this level. I mean, I'm on fire. Just not scare me.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  But a lot of people just don't go with it. They go the other direction and curl up in a ball. That's what he's telling you is going on.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  They're threatening people ahead of this throughout the government in Virginia.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins. There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.

[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  I don't want to interrupt, but I'm leaving.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  You've been doing great, Owen. You're going to finish up with these calls within Gregory's and, of course, Harrison Smith are going to take another hour of calls.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  The crew's volunteered to do it, so we're here live covering this, hoping everything de-escalates.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  So the live coverage continues. Everybody spread those links. The globals are hacking us, trying to shut this down.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  Don't let them win. No BS. Everything's straight shooting here. See, I don't have some Mackie Valley manipulative view.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  With me, it's all straightforward attack. That's the real power.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  Don't act so surprised, globalist. You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  Join Band-Aught Video and I will complete your training. Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, couldn't be more epic the attempt to start 1776 Part II by the deep state.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  They know Trump's winning. They know the political system is realigning against the Democrats and their America-hating garbage.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  So now they're trying to start a war in Virginia where the Revolutionary War started.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Started there and in Boston. And they're trying to trigger American gun owners to get into a shooting war with the police.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  Now the governor has declared a state of emergency ahead of demonstrations next week in the Commonwealth's capital.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  I will be there at the same time, just 35 miles from where the capital is there.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  The federal capital in the District of Criminals is going to be running the trial of the President.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  The planets are aligning. Willard is a current state police officer and I want him to walk through what he just said last segment.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  Some stations don't carry it about Obama's behind it. He's being told by hires up.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  They're threatening the hires up in government that you'll all be indicted down the road when the deep state takes over and Trump's removed.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  This is a plan. This is a move. They've been trying it before two years ago in Virginia, in Charlottesville.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  So it's on, ladies and gentlemen. Willard, please lay this out for folks.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  Well, first thing, like I said in the beginning, you know, voting is over. It's time for arresting.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  And people have the power. You don't have to get your guns out to go arrest these people.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Now people show up up there. We can get this done. And a lot of people are not paying attention.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  Obama is running this thing. And this is from the people I know in government who's telling me this.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  They're all been threatened. I mean, look what they're doing. They're trying to arrest President Trump in front of the whole world.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  They don't got all of the people that helped him get a voter to arrest it.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  And people are just sitting back and saying, well, we'll hide up under our city council. Well, that's not going to work because
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  the word is going to go out and you're going to get arrested and you're going to go to jail and they're not going to come.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  The people that are going to do door to door, I don't think it's going to happen.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  But they do have foreign, we do have foreign people in our police department and a lot of people are like, where are these people coming from?
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  And a lot of people don't know Bill Barr is Bill Barr and none of these people are going to do nothing.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  They're all part of the deep state. That's why it's taking so long for these arrests to happen.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  And these voting machines or these voting machines are what these people get falsely elected.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  And they said, well, the people voted for this. And so now we're going to take your arms. This is the big test case.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  There is bills all over this country and they're ready to dump them as soon as this thing, if it doesn't come off the hinges,
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  they're going to go ahead and force these other states and you're going to see there's a bunch of sleeper cells all in this country.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  And it's sad and I hate to see it, but like I said, if they pass the law, I'm going to arrest you and I'm going to charge you and I'm going to do what they told me to do.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  I'm not going door to door. That's for the other people.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  But if you get pulled over and you got these guns, I'm going to arrest you and you're going to go to jail.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  And I don't want that, but the people need to wake up and do something and you don't have to be armed to do something.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  And let's expand on that. The Texas Domestic Terrorism Threat Assessments put out a huge report on the number one terror threat, 48 pages long.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  And it mirrors what the FBI came out and said that the main threat is leftist antifa, ladies and gentlemen, and that they are going out doing the majority of the mass shootings consciously to blame the Second Amendment.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  You now have this man kill his wife saying he wants guns to be taken now, this Democrat. This is what these people are doing.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  You have the Bernie Sanders campaign operative saying, oh, Sanders supports arresting people, putting them in FEMA camps.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  If they're white males or don't turn their guns in, they say we're going to use violence and kill the police.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  We're going to confront Trump supporters violently. We're going to burn down all the cities.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  There are quotes and Sanders won't even decry this guy. This campaign's locked down all their Twitter accounts in that state because they're all making similar comments.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  These are classical communists planning their overthrow.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  Texas government forewarns incel rebellion says incels are emerging domestic terrorism threat.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Incel rebellion wanting human depopulation and hating women because they don't like them.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  They are black outfits. They are anti-human. They are anti-gun. They are big environmentalists.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  They're antifa members. Going back to you, Willard, what is the sense of, or have you guys talked about, obviously, of the deep states running this?
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  It's a test case. The governor first said, yeah, we're going to take the guns, take the ammo, shut down the gun ranges, all of it.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  But then he goes, oh, it's not going to be that bad. But then now we see these really bad bills to register, to confiscate the semi-auto, to ban massive bans.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  I mean, DC-level type stuff progressing very fast through the statehouse. What's the word on the progression of this, Willard?
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  Well, what we hear in Alex is they're just going to push this bill. They're going to pass it, but they're not going to force it right away.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  They're going to do it in increments. And they're going to, until they can get their people in certain counties and certain cities,
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  and they're just going to just keep letting this thing brew and brew and brew until they got their people in place.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  And then they're going to bring in, the military is not going to do it. It's going to be the UN that's going to come in in military uniforms to do it.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  And they'll do that during a civil war, invited in if Trump was removed. Hillary and others have said that.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  But let's expand. They want to cause a civil insurrection now, though, in Virginia to kick this whole thing off.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  That's what I'm saying. I'm not talking about long-term, they're gun confiscation plan. I'm saying they're trying to be provocative now in Virginia.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  The deep state is to try to trigger something.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  Well, they are. They're trying to trigger stuff. You know, we arrest these Antifa guys left and right.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  Okay. We catch them drunk out of their mind and they're trying to burn stuff down and bomb stuff and everything.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  And they are. They're just trying to see how far they can push this thing. And then it's going to quiet down.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  And then they're going to come later. That's what we're getting.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  By the way, Soros has elected hundreds of DAs and sheriffs. The political says he's taking over the law.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  Yeah, that's what's going on. And that's what I just said. They're putting people into these counties, these sanctuary counties.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  And then when they get enough from in there, then they're really going to hammer people and people just are not paying attention.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  And one more thing, Alex, I'll show you. I know what I'm talking about. Bill Barr is not going to do nothing.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  The word is from the people I know, Bill Barr is not going to arrest nobody. They'll go out to struck a page and, you know, it's going to be quiet and everything.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  But the big fish, they're trying to hope they're trying to get Trump out. That's the goal. Get Trump out, delay, delay, delay.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  And then when Trump is gone, we can just put this thing on the rug and it's over. And people are just not paying attention.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  They've got all this faith and confidence of Bill Barr. Bill Barr is one of them. Bill Barr is the one.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  And I'll tell you another thing, too. Alex, you know Trump don't talk about Hillary's emails anymore because he's got them. He's got them.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  That's why he's not talking about them anymore. And this is what I was told. Giuliani's parallel Bill Barr.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  So when Bill Barr don't deliver by this election, Bill Barr is gone. Giuliani's in. Giuliani said he's ready to go.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  Trump has to act because here's the thing. They keep taking shots of the president and missing.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  But you don't let them keep taking the shots. I know they want to stabilize things and I want stability, too.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  But the globalists are destabilizing. They're the danger. The destabilization is letting them keep having more shots.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  The president and the Pentagon and everybody, this is not a normal threat. This is a foreign CHICOM funded threat.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  We need direct action by people in the government that are patriots, directed by the president.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  And the leadership of the globalists need to be dealt with. They need to be eliminated.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  I'll just say it right out there on air. This is a job for the president. They're not going to do it, Alex, because they've all been threatened.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  They saw what happened to Roger Stone and everybody. They're not going to do nothing.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  No, I get it. That's why they do stuff to me and everybody else is to intimidate everybody. But people better be scared of not taking action.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  Thank you. More calls straight ahead. Stay there, everybody. Don't hang up, callers.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush.
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  The equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month. Don't miss this one. Stake your claim today.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  Call 800-600-3388. That's 800-600-3388. These valuable lease contracts won't last long. Call now 800-600-3388.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  800-600-3388.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate info wars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate and we're not giving up.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags. The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  They fear to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants. They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  They fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars, the family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air and I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration. The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  So it's not a burden to support info wars. It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:20:00.000]  So visit infowarstore.com today.
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  Okay, it's the info war. I'm Alex Jones and I just spent 20 minutes with one caller, but people understand why I did. He's active state police and was breaking down what we already know the deep state is in control of this.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  They want to cause some type of big incident. They did that obviously at Charlottesville colliding the two groups together and try to then blame the president for that. And they want to say, oh, look, we're right.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  It happened in Virginia again. It's a no brainer. Now he's declared an emergency. I'm going to move through these calls as quickly as I can so you don't have to hold too long. Tom in Texas.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  Thanks for holding. You were a police officer from Virginia Beach. Give us your take.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  Hi, Tom. So Tom here from Virginia, Virginia Beach. I'm now staying in residing in Houston, Texas.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  I'm in the security industry here, retired and early.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  Let's just say about 10 years ago.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  I have extensive training and civil disobedience.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  That sort of thing and Virginia Beach and
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  was involved in some
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  very interesting things back in the 90s, but Virginia Beach,
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  sanctuary city, interaction with subjects coming up from the border, that sort of thing. And the Virginia Beach firearms, the firearms here in Virginia, I'm finding that
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  if you're law enforcement, you're supposed to interact with the
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  public. I understand that a lot of things are going to
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  happen here soon.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  Well, what are your colleagues saying about Virginia because to me it looks like a plan for, again, embarrassing the president creating a civil war. That's what Bernie's people want to them.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  That's their Hail Mary, but it's all they've got.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  I think that
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  the embarrassment of the president is
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  born foremost on their agenda. I think they are going to try to take him out of office.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  And I believe that
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  I left my number with your peers there. If they want to get back in touch with me, please do so. I'm trying to keep my focus. I was involved in a lot of
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  things.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  Well, I've got a lot of guys here that are former federal police, military, and things like that. So what I'll do is, while they're all going to be in Virginia, we've also got some of the guys driving the truck up there.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  So I'll give them your name and number. So I appreciate your call. I understand you don't want to stay a lot on air. Look, the Democrats want to start something in Virginia, and they want to start stuff in D.C.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  And we know they're making their move. And most of the FBI has problems, but they're not communist. They're not global. So Trump, obviously, I'm sure has FBI task forces down in Virginia right now.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  And there needs to be a lot of on the ground surveillance of the left and of Antifa. And I can't believe George Soros is still walking around and not in prison because these people are terrorists.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  I mean, in fact, guys, you bring me the stack yesterday I was asking for that, the 2015 plan for martial law in Maryland, the other stack on the civil internment camp stuff, because I just want to want to show that to everybody here on air when we come back from
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  break so that people can know we're not just making this up. So Obama had all this set up, try to trigger race wars. It didn't work. Now Trump said they're trying to do it again. There it is on screen.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  So this is their playbook. We're like a football team that has the other sides playbook. And we're basically helping them. If we don't stand up against this and say no.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Brady in Virginia. Active Navy on gun confiscation. What's your view on this? Sir, thanks for calling.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  Yeah, of course, man. I mean, it just comes down to the simple fact people got to wake the hell up. I mean, with blackface, you know, he's trying to enact these state of emergency policies for capital grounds, people got to realize that's no joke.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  And this could, you know, potentially set a very scary precedent for future gun confiscation policies and other stuff like that. So I mean, people got to realize that people are really making these plans.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  You know, a lot of people like to like to think, Oh, well, that will never happen. Or, you know, that's too far out. But it's really not. It's in plain sight. And that people do have these plans. And I know that, you know, with all these sanctuary cities being created in Virginia, it gives me a little bit of hope.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  And I would like to think that the citizens of this of this state wouldn't take any of that if it came down to it. But to be honest, I'm not real sure how it would all play out.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  And let's just boil down what this is. You know, the illegals are used as pawns. We get it. They're leaving horrible places. They're not the enemy, though they are being used as a projectile.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  Thousands of cities say we don't arrest illegal aliens even for drunk driving. They're above the law. They bring them in. They give them driver's license and then they tell them vote Democrat.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  So that is just bringing in a foreign group to vote as a block that you control to take people's guns, because anytime they want, they can selectively prosecute those illegals.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  So the Democrats are a mafia importing a permanent underclass that they control, that they dominate, that they rule. And so that's it.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  Dr. McCam shot please. Thank you. Here it is. Intermittent resettlement operations, FM 3-39-40. That was under Obama preparing martial law.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  It talks about internment camps and reeducation camps, the Soviet term. Leaked U.S. Army Document Outlines plan for reeducation camps in America.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  Here's the Soros, Alexander Soros plan, funding action groups trying to get African Americans to riot led by white college professors and others dressed in black in disguises to then trigger a race war to blame the Republican Party and try to break the country up.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  They're in the same thing now to Trump. So all I'm saying is they're trying it, they're doing it, and we're going to be there exposing it.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  Do you have any views on what we as citizens can do to stop this, Brady? Because I'm not just going to sit here and count and wait on Trump.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  We got Trump elected. Info wars in this audience got around the media. And so I'm going to be in D.C., I'm going to be in Virginia, I'm going to be in their face.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  I think everybody should go to Democrat events that are live on TV, legally shout them down with their plans for martial law, their plans for gun confiscation.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  I think we should, in information war, get very aggressive to stop physical war, to stop their plan for martial law.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  We've got to get very aggressive with our mouths and with our keyboards and with our feet, going to the Capitol and going to their offices and letting these sacks of garbage know.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  Well, that's the thing, Alex. This whole state of emergency plan, the whole reason they're enacting that is to try to provoke some sort of reaction.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  Because you know, at the end of the day, they're going to try to use our rallies and, you know, our actions against us.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  They're going to try to provoke something where they can make it a big headline and use it to just push more and more and more of this BS.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  And that's why everyone going has to have cameras, go pros and phones going. And it's just a service to sit there at 100 yards away and just videotape the crowd.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  And to videotape the vehicles coming in and everything so that the globalists know we're watching your asses.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  Just like last time when they created the crisis, they're suing me because I dared question it. They want to tell you, we're going to attack you, give you question these events.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  You're just supposed to let us have the narrative and put out what we want. Well, guess what? No, we're not going to do it.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  And Info Wars will be there in defiance of your tyranny. Thanks to the good graces of this audience of activists supporting us.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  So infowarstore.com brought to you by you, Info Wars, and the Rest Racial Republic brought to you by you.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  You are the Info War. God bless you, Gary.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  More calls, Minuteman, Mark, Dale, Michael, your calls on the other side. Stay with us.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one.
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  Infowarstore.com, we have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete with Super Blue that's 4-5 of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride-free, the adult or the children's.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers, people love it.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above-sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes genzavirus. This is all proven, you can make claims with this.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  So we're really proud of it, it funds the operation. Infowarstore.com, that's why we're still on air thanks to you.
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  You want to break some globalist ribs, you want to crush some skulls politically, you want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually.
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  There's nowhere you can spend money, there's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar.
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  Your bang for your buck, fear, gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  And so it's very simple, if you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see, we have to make the effort, 110% God will finish the move.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack, I want to attack, I want to go after the globalists.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  I'm going to buzz my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family, because we're in this together, infowarstore.com.
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  Thanks for the good Lord for the Constitution I've been given.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  But up until about eight, nine years ago when I started taking X2 and the products in Forrest Life, I still got sick every couple of years.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  And you know, I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that.
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  But now that I religiously take the products at InfoWarsLife, one of the highest quality supplements you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever.
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  It's just crazy.
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:33:18.000]  So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide in defiance of the bubbles and their edict, the silence the American people ahead of the New World Order's takeover.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  But all they're here to do is test us and make us be the men and women we are and not submit to their evil.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  It's always the fight between heaven and hell.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  You look at the fruits of the globalists, it's all pure death.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  Did you hear the earlier callers?
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  Police officers currently, state police in Virginia, others saying it's about the sanctuary cities.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  It's about the illegals voting.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  It's about all the major cities defying the law, shipping in the illegal, signing up for welfare, skimming money off the top.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  And now this just broke.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  Federal judge Washington Post temporarily halts Trump administration's policy, allowing local governments to block refugees.
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  When the UN brings them in illegally, dumps them in their towns.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  The federal judges are saying the few local governments saying no to this can't do it.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  Even though it's all illegal, it's already going on.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  It's a replacement migration.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  But years after the refugees show up, 90% in Europe don't ever have a job.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  They stay on welfare.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  About 60% here in the U.S.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  They're bringing in permanent classes of people that are designed in the policies never to get a job and to be in ghettos that the Democrats control through the welfare system and skim the money off of.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  A slave population they administer and they control.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  And the Islamists tell the Europeans, open your gates or we will kill you.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  It is unbelievable in Germany.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  TV shows designed for 10-year-old girls tell them, get your Muslim husband by 14.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  Muslim husbands are the best.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  And they have shows showing girls how to wear a jibs and show 14-year-old girls with their 25-year-old husbands.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  And judges have ruled pedophilia is legal for Islamics in Sweden and Germany and in Denmark.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  They are allowed to have sex with underage girls and even children.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  They're even allowed to run sex slavery ops because it's their culture.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  They are gods.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  You've got to advertise, hey, come here, rape pillage.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  And it's, of course, over 90% military aged men pouring in with George Soros running the ships, bringing them in.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  Italy for a while fought it, but they removed their president.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  And now it's on.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  This is how 21st century war is fought.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  And they know the West has big hearts and they show us the few images of the few little kids in photo ops.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  Turns out they staged those.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  Now let's go to your phone calls.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  All right.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  Rangers in Texas, he needs army.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  He wants to talk about gun confiscation.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  He's a new caller.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  We'll get to him soon.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  Minuteman, there's National Guard on gun confiscation.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  We'll go to Minuteman first.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  Minuteman's been holding the longest than the others.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  Minuteman, thanks for calling.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  You're in Virginia.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  What's your view on this, sir?
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  Man, I'm watching foreign multinational powers how to break the country up.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  Man, I see that.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  I see that.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  I listen to you every day and I'm glad, man.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  You're the only one that's out there speaking the truth.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  I really appreciate you.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  I do want to plug one thing.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  I love that shirt.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  Mass murderers agree.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  Second Amendment doesn't work.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  Gun control doesn't work.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  It was Hitler styling and Mao on it.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  I get comments on it all the time.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  Every time I wear it, it's one of my favorite shirts to wear.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  That's the first info or shirt.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  I designed that when I was like 25 years old.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  Back when Photoshop will take like five minutes to like even render a photo.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  So, yeah, that's a classic.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  Thanks for the support.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  But it is the classic t-shirt.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  And on the back, it says politicians love disarmed peasants.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  Exactly.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  Speaking mass move mountains today, Alex.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  I'm being dead serious.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  People take pictures with me with on with that one all the time because I'm a big guy.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  And they're like, oh man, thank you for wearing that.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  I really appreciate it.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  And I wanted to bring up about yes, two days ago, Alex, about about the gun
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  confiscation and everything that's going on.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  They had the voting two days ago about and they passed all those things about all
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  those in the General Assembly.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  And right that same day, there was an active shooter hoax at a middle school.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  And you can look it up, try to share that and put it on screen.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  But there was pretty much a student set a text in saying it was an active shooter
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  on a middle school.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  Is it that convenient?
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  Yeah.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  And then beginning of this month, we as a National Guard members, and I want to share
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  this as well, please feel to the public.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  I do not blame us for the governor and what he's doing because not all of us agree with
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  what he's doing.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  I've even said it online on my personal Facebook to others that if I ever get activated to
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  take the rights away from my fellow Americans, you might as well just lock me up because
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  I'm not doing it.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  I will step down, put me a living worth.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  I don't care.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  But we got a letter and email from the adjunct general saying that for our protection and
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  our families that we need to be careful how we go to drills and be even going in public.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  And we can't even hardly wear our uniforms anymore.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  And so again to the public, just please don't blame us.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  Oh, sure.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  Well, that's the deep state trying to spin it like we're enemies, the military, the
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  American people know that if the deep state successfully kicks off a civil war, the police
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  and military, we just go around you, you wink, wink, and you take your uniform off and
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  join us and we'll just take care of business real quick.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  We're not going to have a big civil war.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  We all line up and kill each other like idiots.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  This isn't a civil war.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  This is firing enemies in control of the media, the universities, banking and other areas
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  that if they want to start it, we're going to finish it and they're going to get removed.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  Exactly.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  And I've been saying it.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  I've been saying this for a year, Alex, to my coworkers because I worked day job at a
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  correctional facility.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  I say this to my coworkers that if another Revolution 1776 is going to happen, it's going
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  to happen in Virginia.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  Donald Trump has been doing everything he can to modify and talk to everyone to get us
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:03.800]  out of those bad deals with everybody.
[1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:05.000]  And now he's working with China.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:10.400]  He at first, when I was said, said that it was when Hong Kong was on, I'm not Hong Kong,
[1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:14.560]  North Korea was shooting the missiles all over Japan and everybody was saying, we're
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:15.560]  going to war.
[1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:16.560]  No, we weren't.
[1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:20.120]  Trump stood up like a man and took it to take care of business.
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:24.360]  He told him straight up and then all of a sudden more things are falling through.
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:25.360]  He's talking to China.
[1:40:25.360 --> 1:40:27.560]  He's actually trying to work with Russia.
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:29.800]  He just signed the trade deal with China.
[1:40:29.800 --> 1:40:30.800]  Exactly.
[1:40:30.800 --> 1:40:31.800]  He's trying to do everything he can.
[1:40:31.800 --> 1:40:33.480]  Everybody's saying, no, he's just bowing down.
[1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:34.480]  No, he's not.
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:39.440]  He's actually being a man and stepping up and not giving things to little babies around
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:42.960]  the world and telling them to grow up.
[1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:43.960]  You're absolutely right.
[1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:47.520]  And the deep state that's been busy selling America off thinks they're going to remove
[1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:48.520]  him.
[1:40:48.520 --> 1:40:51.120]  Notice all this is kicking off while they're about to have the trial of the president next
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:52.120]  week.
[1:40:52.120 --> 1:40:53.120]  Exactly.
[1:40:53.120 --> 1:40:54.120]  Most definitely.
[1:40:54.120 --> 1:40:56.960]  You will come down to Richmond because I will take off work that day to come.
[1:40:56.960 --> 1:40:57.960]  Sir, I'm coming.
[1:40:57.960 --> 1:40:58.960]  I'm coming.
[1:40:58.960 --> 1:40:59.960]  Absolutely.
[1:40:59.960 --> 1:41:00.960]  I'm going to be there.
[1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:04.840]  I'm going to be in DC this weekend at the Women's March and I'm going to be there in
[1:41:04.840 --> 1:41:05.840]  Virginia, sir.
[1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:06.840]  Okay.
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:07.840]  I'll try to see you then.
[1:41:07.840 --> 1:41:09.960]  I'll be wearing my two-way shirt.
[1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:10.960]  God bless you, sir.
[1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:12.760]  We're going to be driving around on the armored vehicle.
[1:41:12.760 --> 1:41:14.640]  You'll see me and you'll hear me coming.
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:17.000]  All right, there he goes.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  Very exciting.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.640]  We're going to go to break and then I'm going to cram in all these calls when we come back.
[1:41:20.640 --> 1:41:22.160]  I'm doing a decent job of going to calls though.
[1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:27.480]  We're going to go to Dale first and then Mark and then just through the calls as you come
[1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:28.480]  in.
[1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:32.800]  Getting a lot of great calls from law enforcement, military, police, National Guard right there
[1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:35.640]  where the Democrats said, we're going to use the National Guard to take the guns.
[1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:39.480]  The National Guard came on and said, no, you're not.
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:44.880]  So it's crazy how they're trying to make us kill each other and it's stupid, but it's
[1:41:44.880 --> 1:41:45.880]  all they've got.
[1:41:45.880 --> 1:41:52.760]  So we'll go to break and come back with your calls on the other side, but you know, there's
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:57.400]  a whole movement too to keep nationalists, conservatives, patriots away from each other.
[1:41:57.400 --> 1:41:59.520]  The big thing is they say the Tea Party's racist.
[1:41:59.520 --> 1:42:03.920]  The media always said that Trump was able to break that lie and now you see what's happening
[1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:04.920]  in mass.
[1:42:04.920 --> 1:42:08.560]  All these great minorities who are the majority in America in many areas are coming in saying
[1:42:08.560 --> 1:42:09.600]  they want to be part of America.
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:10.600]  They always were.
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:14.200]  And seeing through the propaganda, that's when the Democrats are panicking and they also
[1:42:14.200 --> 1:42:18.320]  contact gun groups and stuff and go, oh, don't have Alex Jones on, you know, or don't have
[1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:22.400]  him speak at your podium in Virginia next, like I need to speak at a podium like that's
[1:42:22.400 --> 1:42:23.400]  where I want to be.
[1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:28.000]  Anyways, and then we're like, hey, here you're coming, but we're, you know, you're not about
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  Sandy Hook, are you?
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:30.600]  We're going to get up on the stage like that's my identity.
[1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:33.040]  They just buy the leftist media.
[1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:37.080]  We built with this audience, the Liberty Movement that's challenging the globalist.
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:38.080]  So I'll be in Virginia.
[1:42:38.080 --> 1:42:41.080]  I don't need to be up on the stage up there.
[1:42:41.080 --> 1:42:44.800]  I'm coming with the people to stand against the gun grabbers and bring a message to the
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:46.400]  governor and others.
[1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:55.800]  That's where the real fight is, is inside that Capitol, not outside.
[1:42:55.800 --> 1:42:57.480]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[1:42:57.480 --> 1:42:59.640]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer.
[1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:03.240]  I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you.
[1:43:03.240 --> 1:43:08.960]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads, so you
[1:43:08.960 --> 1:43:12.200]  think you don't want to hear an ad, I don't want to hear an ad, but here's the bottom
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:13.560]  line.
[1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:17.600]  We're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face of the globalist, not contract.
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:18.840]  I don't want them to win.
[1:43:18.840 --> 1:43:21.760]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:26.320]  We sew enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really
[1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:28.080]  give the globalists around for their money.
[1:43:28.080 --> 1:43:32.640]  But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus, X2, these will change
[1:43:32.640 --> 1:43:33.640]  your life.
[1:43:33.640 --> 1:43:36.880]  Go check out the turmeric products, check out the water filtration, air filtration, check
[1:43:36.880 --> 1:43:37.880]  it all out.
[1:43:37.880 --> 1:43:41.200]  You take action and know, be part of the second American Revolution.
[1:43:41.200 --> 1:43:44.480]  Be part of question to globalist and get great products at the same time.

[1:45:56.440 --> 1:45:58.960]  Hey, you there.
[1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:00.720]  We have a problem.
[1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:03.440]  You see, there is a baby.
[1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:07.320]  The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready.
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:11.440]  The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down.
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:14.240]  The mother starts to have regrets.
[1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:21.360]  The father considers leaving town, but a friend says there's a solution.
[1:46:21.360 --> 1:46:25.480]  She says to have an abortion.
[1:46:25.480 --> 1:46:27.400]  The mother decides to look into it.
[1:46:27.400 --> 1:46:30.560]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:32.320]  She's made her decision.
[1:46:32.320 --> 1:46:34.760]  She's going to have an abortion.
[1:46:34.760 --> 1:46:41.240]  The problem is, that baby is you.
[1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:47.320]  Join me, Owen Schreuer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th, in Washington,
[1:46:47.320 --> 1:46:49.920]  D.C., noon, at the National Mall.
[1:46:49.920 --> 1:46:51.240]  I'll see you there.
[1:46:51.240 --> 1:46:53.680]  It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:47:00.200]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:18.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:18.480 --> 1:47:20.920]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:47:20.920 --> 1:47:29.520]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:38.880]  Another big reason we know that your planet's something big in Virginia is, Biden's been
[1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:43.480]  making for the last year of his campaign the centerpiece of it.
[1:47:43.480 --> 1:47:48.440]  Charlottesville and saying, Trump loves white supremacists and Trump killed this lady.
[1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:53.200]  All this made up garbage.
[1:47:53.200 --> 1:47:58.120]  So now he's got ads out saying he's coming after the NRA.
[1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:04.840]  And they've introduced a bill that's moving through really fast to shut down the gun ranges
[1:48:04.840 --> 1:48:05.840]  there.
[1:48:05.840 --> 1:48:10.560]  So we're going to write back to your calls after I play Joe Biden saying he's coming
[1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:17.280]  after the Second Amendment and the NRA and then what Pelosi had to say.
[1:48:17.280 --> 1:48:23.840]  Children went to school today learning how to duck and cover because they may get shot
[1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:25.320]  in school.
[1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:31.760]  Think about a troubled soul in the country assault rifles magazines holding forty fifty
[1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:36.160]  sixty hundred bullets there's no room for them in America.
[1:48:36.160 --> 1:48:41.560]  We have to go out and take on the NRA and beat them I've beaten them twice and I will
[1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:43.560]  beat them again.
[1:48:43.560 --> 1:48:46.920]  I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message.
[1:48:46.920 --> 1:48:52.680]  But again it's Sunday morning let's be optimistic about the future a future that will not have
[1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:54.800]  Donald Trump in the White House.
[1:48:54.800 --> 1:48:59.320]  One way or another ten months from now we will have an election if we don't have him
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:01.160]  removed sooner.
[1:49:01.160 --> 1:49:05.000]  But again he will be impeached forever.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  Okay now I'm going to go to your phone calls and then when I start the next hour there's
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:16.520]  a bunch of other news we haven't hit that's breaking a lot of it.
[1:49:16.520 --> 1:49:21.240]  We have Trump signing the trade deal with China I have comments on that.
[1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:26.400]  We have Owen Schreuer confronting a whole bunch of globalists on video.
[1:49:26.400 --> 1:49:33.880]  We have what Putin saying five nuclear arms states must work together to de-neutralize
[1:49:33.880 --> 1:49:36.760]  the threat of global war.
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:40.440]  Again five nuclear arms states must work together to neutralize the threat of global
[1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:41.440]  war.
[1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:46.760]  That's all on info wars dot com and news wars dot com and the only way these videos and
[1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:48.840]  articles and material get out is when you share them.
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:53.560]  And I know you know that but just remember that and and and Bandot video is exploding
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:59.800]  it's growing exponentially and a lot of videos get a quarter million and a half million views.
[1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:03.600]  But we want to use the platform to get it out to people that don't know what's going
[1:50:03.600 --> 1:50:07.640]  on like the UN report admitting that vaccines are killing people and there's a cover up.
[1:50:07.640 --> 1:50:17.480]  That is so bombshell that smoking gun when transcripts came out of the CDC in 2002 admitting
[1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:22.000]  that they're covering up vaccine damages and autism it was a huge national story and people
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:23.840]  still point that out.
[1:50:23.840 --> 1:50:26.880]  That's because back then the press wasn't as controlled as it is now.
[1:50:26.880 --> 1:50:31.400]  Big tech is a lot of level of censorship untold so the goal is to get outside the info wars
[1:50:31.400 --> 1:50:37.000]  audience you are the resistance you are the front line where you can say look at this
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:43.120]  Bandot video from Bandot video here's the UN head scientist saying this that's a big
[1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:51.920]  deal that is so important then I'm also going to speak about Trump and and how he understands
[1:50:51.920 --> 1:50:56.240]  how the media really works and how they control people and and Trump's secrets so put a note
[1:50:56.240 --> 1:51:00.160]  on the screen for me guys they don't have a teleprompter but sometimes I tell them to
[1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:04.280]  put a note on screen of when a guest is coming on or when I forget something or when I made
[1:51:04.280 --> 1:51:08.840]  a mistake and I say the wrong date or something they'll put it up on screen occasionally so
[1:51:08.840 --> 1:51:11.880]  just remind me to get into that at the start of the next hour.
[1:51:11.880 --> 1:51:18.400]  Let's now go to the calls here let's talk to who is up next here Dale in Michigan then
[1:51:18.400 --> 1:51:23.360]  Mark in Texas Dale thanks for holding her on the air Alex keep up the good work thank
[1:51:23.360 --> 1:51:29.640]  you sir I'm trying two things uh heller DC verse heller it's a supreme court ruling that
[1:51:29.640 --> 1:51:35.120]  the individual has the rights so just like troops were sent to Little Rock Arkansas
[1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:40.920]  in Brown versus Board of Education and the desegregation laws Eisenhower sent 1000 US
[1:51:40.920 --> 1:51:47.320]  troops to enforce that law Trump could send US forces to enforce this DC verse heller
[1:51:47.320 --> 1:51:54.160]  ruling in Virginia Bill Barr he could send a letter to the governor cease and desist
[1:51:54.160 --> 1:51:57.920]  and that would should be the end of it but if he doesn't then the troops is the second
[1:51:57.920 --> 1:52:02.400]  measure you're absolutely right when Little Rock wouldn't let the little black girl into
[1:52:02.400 --> 1:52:08.880]  school we saw the military police get her in there also how come Trump doesn't use the
[1:52:08.880 --> 1:52:14.120]  NDAA or the terrorism laws that Bush signed into effect to go after some of these deep
[1:52:14.120 --> 1:52:19.200]  state criminals that have violated the Logan act as Trump said carry violated Logan act
[1:52:19.200 --> 1:52:24.600]  where's the Department of Homeland Security on that all of this is happening because good
[1:52:24.600 --> 1:52:29.280]  men at the Department of Justice at the top talk but they do nothing they allow the deep
[1:52:29.280 --> 1:52:33.160]  state to continue to try to remove the president to try to start civil war they have all the
[1:52:33.160 --> 1:52:37.760]  documents all the internal stuff that should send Alexander Soros to prison but because
[1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:42.320]  Soros is hooked into the deep state and funneling millions of taxpayer money back to people
[1:52:42.320 --> 1:52:46.120]  in the deep state that's how it works he gets taxpayer money the State Department he then
[1:52:46.120 --> 1:52:51.280]  funnels it back to the private groups so since there's those giant payoff arms going on that
[1:52:51.280 --> 1:52:56.520]  cancerous group is still fighting to stay in control absolutely absolutely I'll leave
[1:52:56.520 --> 1:53:02.360]  your calls with us the Constitution is a piece of paper it's the natural rights that it represents
[1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:06.640]  that is most important thanks Alex you're right the Constitution Bill rights isn't
[1:53:06.640 --> 1:53:12.360]  giving us our rights it's an example of those put down in law that you shall not infringe
[1:53:12.360 --> 1:53:17.580]  and they're walking all over it and they know there's an alignment of the people waking
[1:53:17.580 --> 1:53:21.800]  up across the board they know their race war stuff's not working so they're just flooding
[1:53:21.800 --> 1:53:26.280]  us with a bunch of you know the poorest of the poor who they can control and then make
[1:53:26.280 --> 1:53:31.080]  vote who don't even know what they're doing it's very cold blooded very very evil we're
[1:53:31.080 --> 1:53:35.000]  going to go to as I said mark here in a moment but I need to say this we won't be here on
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:40.200]  air we're fighting as hard as we can and I'm putting a ton of money which I'm proud to
[1:53:40.200 --> 1:53:44.440]  do into being at all these big events around the country you notice our crews out there
[1:53:44.440 --> 1:53:48.840]  with security all over we're busting our butts as I pledge to do but it takes a lot of money
[1:53:48.840 --> 1:53:54.360]  to do this and we need a lot more to hire more camera people more reporters you know
[1:53:54.360 --> 1:53:57.480]  and to pay for the plane tickets and to pay for the security and to pay for all of it
[1:53:57.480 --> 1:54:02.320]  and to have the editors and people and the journalists to look over everything and get

[1:55:02.280 --> 1:55:06.840]  from new york to texas and the army and you want to comment on the situation go ahead
[1:55:06.840 --> 1:55:11.800]  thank you yeah like yeah like so basically the guy before you really took away a lot
[1:55:11.800 --> 1:55:18.760]  of what I wanted to say because my attitude is this my you know I don't I don't work
[1:55:18.760 --> 1:55:26.520]  there anymore but people in law enforcement do not obey orders to this arm american citizens
[1:55:26.520 --> 1:55:33.720]  and that means don't make traffic stops and take confiscate firearms the laws the constitution
[1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:40.280]  not with some dummies or some anti-americans and some state legislature and some governor
[1:55:40.280 --> 1:55:46.320]  tell you now as far as trump goes Alex I got a lot of problems with trump okay I pretty
[1:55:46.320 --> 1:55:50.760]  much jumped off that train that the first time he bombed cereal off that false flag
[1:55:50.760 --> 1:55:56.720]  um he shouldn't be farting around there in the middle east now with Iran and all that
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:56:02.120]  I was told the against killing the general sulaimani he should be worried about this
[1:56:02.120 --> 1:56:07.960]  country and what's going on right now in virginia if you and I don't trust the man because
[1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:12.520]  it's very simple what he has to do just like the guy said before this is a violation against
[1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:18.440]  the constitution what back in arkansas they were violating black people's rights as as
[1:56:18.440 --> 1:56:25.880]  american citizens they're violating the 13th and the 14th amendment so he said I sent troops
[1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:32.200]  in there and to lbj's credit back in alabama he sent troops in and for to enforce the
[1:56:32.200 --> 1:56:37.720]  rights of the people there okay all he has to do is make it clear first of all federalized
[1:56:37.720 --> 1:56:46.360]  national guard in uh virginia second if the if they try to confiscate guns or all you
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:51.920]  got to do is send in a few thousand american troops get them out of the middle east we
[1:56:51.920 --> 1:56:56.560]  don't belong in the middle east bring them home get them out of nago too by the way bring
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:57:02.400]  no i agree instead of the democrats trying to to to get troops to take guns i agree this
[1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:06.320]  is a basic right we have a supreme court ruling just like the supreme court ruled you know
[1:57:06.320 --> 1:57:11.080]  that black kids could go to school well the supreme court has said you can't take these
[1:57:11.080 --> 1:57:16.440]  guns and so absolutely then it's up to the executive when a state's out of control if
[1:57:16.440 --> 1:57:21.400]  you believe in the federalist system to say no so bingo and just like our rights are being
[1:57:21.400 --> 1:57:24.960]  violated by big tech combines in league with communist china they're helping the chai commas
[1:57:24.960 --> 1:57:29.040]  around with their own people why is trump not acting against all the damn censorship
[1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:33.280]  you're right and many people to go to trump rallies and bring this up and we've got operation
[1:57:33.280 --> 1:57:37.600]  win 2020 i'm gonna finally tell you about today i haven't gotten to wear a week behind
[1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:41.400]  launching this because i've been so busy but we're gonna get it done thank you mark michael
[1:57:41.400 --> 1:57:47.840]  michael ranger your calls are straight ahead stay with us it's either happened to every
[1:57:47.840 --> 1:57:55.160]  person listening or it's happened to someone you know everybody is well aware of the fact
[1:57:55.160 --> 1:58:00.800]  that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine right before they
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:08.680]  get it and they get the worst case of the flu of their life but still like concentration
[1:58:08.680 --> 1:58:15.240]  camp victims they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections
[1:58:15.240 --> 1:58:19.840]  it doesn't matter that studies mainline government studies in canada in europe show that when
[1:58:19.840 --> 1:58:25.320]  you take the flu vaccine it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering
[1:58:25.320 --> 1:58:30.840]  your immunity it goes on and on or the fact that the governments have never guessed the
[1:58:30.840 --> 1:58:37.480]  next year's mutation at the flu vaccine has never ever even worked but how do you problem
[1:58:37.480 --> 1:58:42.760]  of hoax you keep the giant hoax going no wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on

[2:00:00.520 --> 2:00:07.080]  you what my gut is on trump and what's happening with the second amendment the first amendment
[2:00:07.080 --> 2:00:12.600]  all of it the next segment the searing girl popping at the bottom of the hour on the latest
[2:00:12.600 --> 2:00:19.520]  the middle east and trump saying that better not hurt any of the protesters what that really
[2:00:19.520 --> 2:00:27.200]  signifies and so much other breaking news the putin comments this will be a jam packed
[2:00:27.200 --> 2:00:37.200]  third hour let's go ahead and go to your calls and let's talk to michael in new hampshire
[2:00:37.200 --> 2:00:41.360]  what do you make of the governor of virginia declaring an emergency in and around the second
[2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:47.680]  amendment crisis there hi how's it going alex how you doing good this is the governor that
[2:00:47.680 --> 2:00:52.840]  says he keeps the babies comfortable after they're born to take the baby and this is
[2:00:52.840 --> 2:01:00.640]  the guy that's in blackface or in a kkk outfit I mean this is crazy I think it's beyond lunacy
[2:01:00.640 --> 2:01:06.240]  talking to the points earlier kind of coalesced with all the other earlier callers oh I see
[2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:10.760]  that you're a marine on gun confiscation sorry go ahead correct yes correct so it's pleasure
[2:01:10.760 --> 2:01:14.920]  speak with you by the way I've been a supporter for years I love your product especially the
[2:01:14.920 --> 2:01:22.040]  iodine thank you yeah so what what I was hitting on was a couple of things mainly to refocus
[2:01:22.040 --> 2:01:27.360]  mainly over a compilation of what all the other callers have kind of confided in was
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:33.240]  first of all the original state police when he called in and he said he wasn't willing
[2:01:33.240 --> 2:01:37.760]  to go against what any laws were passed to enforce he just was going to arrest you based
[2:01:37.760 --> 2:01:43.680]  upon a loss I think that's a huge part of the problem this is an asymmetric operation
[2:01:43.680 --> 2:01:48.240]  that's going on and I think to remind people of the asymmetric operation where they're
[2:01:48.240 --> 2:01:54.120]  poking at one area as opposed to doing one behind the doors in a law setting setting
[2:01:54.120 --> 2:02:00.080]  that precedent then to bring in other outside entities and and when I'm talking to the active
[2:02:00.080 --> 2:02:05.160]  duty military especially in the reserve or in the National Guard they have to understand
[2:02:05.160 --> 2:02:10.600]  that all of the warning signs will be very apparent coming through their channels and
[2:02:10.600 --> 2:02:14.760]  that they cannot and have to interpret what's lawful and unlawful and going back to the
[2:02:14.760 --> 2:02:20.800]  basics of what they've been trained to do their general orders versus what's constitutional
[2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:25.080]  and non-constitutional and that comes down to the small unit leadership and I hope that
[2:02:25.080 --> 2:02:29.000]  they hear that because it's extremely important give me a favor because I know what you're
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:32.840]  talking about and the listeners are smart but a lot of them in the military are studied
[2:02:32.840 --> 2:02:39.360]  this explain to people just the fact that you're having to have discussions at what
[2:02:39.360 --> 2:02:44.760]  unit above level about this shows where the country is and then explaining to them you
[2:02:44.760 --> 2:02:49.640]  know the nature of the chain of command what orders are lawful what aren't how this outside
[2:02:49.640 --> 2:02:55.800]  forces are trying to trigger a domestic configuration for destabilization at a certain point law
[2:02:55.800 --> 2:02:59.600]  enforcement needs to know they're not really getting orders from a legitimate government
[2:02:59.600 --> 2:03:03.080]  when they're given unconstitutional orders that's an unlawful order and not to be followed
[2:03:03.080 --> 2:03:08.440]  is what you're saying correct that's that is a better way of saying it and it's not
[2:03:08.440 --> 2:03:12.760]  a better way of saying it you're smart guys but at your level talk about what's being
[2:03:12.760 --> 2:03:17.600]  discussed because that's another bellwether from what I've heard being discussed a lot
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:23.800]  of disinformation is coming through in terms of what's being propagated on a company or
[2:03:23.800 --> 2:03:29.480]  battalion or higher level as a policy versus what's been instilled or trained on a lower
[2:03:29.480 --> 2:03:35.640]  small scale unit unit leadership so when orders are coming down they'll just be coming down
[2:03:35.640 --> 2:03:41.000]  as a matter of fact as opposed to what you're supposed to be doing on a more rudimentary
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:47.560]  basis so they're they're priming you could say the ideology to just go along with it
[2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:51.680]  and that's where that's where when that state police officer said well if they just passed
[2:03:51.680 --> 2:03:56.160]  the law I'm going to enforce it that's that's the ideology of the asymmetric psychological
[2:03:56.160 --> 2:04:00.200]  operation going on and that's the Nuremberg defense and it doesn't hold up and I understand
[2:04:00.200 --> 2:04:04.240]  his point was flippant that I'm sick of the citizens putting up with this so it's your
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:07.920]  problem you need to get your ass in gear and stop this and I get what he's saying but
[2:04:07.920 --> 2:04:11.760]  you're legally and lawfully right that the Nuremberg defense doesn't work and there are
[2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:17.160]  manuals given to Marines and to members of the army when they graduate boot camp explaining
[2:04:17.160 --> 2:04:21.240]  that they need to know that a lawful order is lawful they need to study the Constitution
[2:04:21.240 --> 2:04:25.520]  Bill of Rights and that they need to not follow orders that are unlawful say if your captain
[2:04:25.520 --> 2:04:29.240]  says line up these women and children and blow their heads off you don't do that you
[2:04:29.240 --> 2:04:32.800]  turn and shoot him in the head and then it goes from there from legal orders down to
[2:04:32.800 --> 2:04:37.400]  stuff where you kill whoever gives the order and that's what this country is built on you
[2:04:37.400 --> 2:04:41.440]  want to add anything else are you done Michael the only thing else I have to add is that
[2:04:41.440 --> 2:04:46.160]  I think refocusing on the fact that what's going on across the country and especially
[2:04:46.160 --> 2:04:50.280]  to the president of the United States stay there we're back in 60 seconds you're a smart
[2:04:50.280 --> 2:05:00.000]  guy when you're your view the globalists know that I will never willingly give up I've said
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  it many times I will never give in I will never give up but I could give out and it's
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:13.400]  very very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity to see evil
[2:05:13.400 --> 2:05:18.760]  running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced
[2:05:18.760 --> 2:05:24.680]  in cyberspace that most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech and to know
[2:05:24.680 --> 2:05:31.680]  that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading
[2:05:31.680 --> 2:05:37.040]  the word about news wars dot com info wars dot com and banned on video and that people
[2:05:37.040 --> 2:05:41.520]  are hungry for the truth now more than ever and then if you tell people hey the banned
[2:05:41.520 --> 2:05:46.280]  truth they don't want you to have is it info wars dot com for its last show and banned
[2:05:46.280 --> 2:05:51.360]  on video so take heart folks they've had to censor everybody to shut everybody down because
[2:05:51.360 --> 2:06:02.440]  the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square we've got it we're coming
[2:06:02.440 --> 2:06:12.000]  to you waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines
[2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:20.800]  of the info war america is fighting for its life and when i finish up talking to michael
[2:06:20.800 --> 2:06:25.400]  michael and ranger i'm gonna give you my take on what's really going on with trump and
[2:06:25.400 --> 2:06:32.640]  some other really important issues but i'm going to virginia and i'm going to dc right
[2:06:32.640 --> 2:06:39.200]  next door we're gonna be there this weekend and next week and we're doing it because
[2:06:39.200 --> 2:06:43.920]  history is taking place and we need everybody to understand that you need to be in virginia
[2:06:43.920 --> 2:06:50.280]  and you need to be in dc both are pick one take the kids out of school do whatever you
[2:06:50.280 --> 2:06:55.080]  got to because this is about stepping into the real world and and and like i don't put
[2:06:55.080 --> 2:06:58.880]  folks down to go have demonstrations in front of capitals and then that's about getting media
[2:06:58.880 --> 2:07:04.240]  attention but the media is going to ignore you but you've got your own independent media
[2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:08.880]  it's about going into the halls of congress and into the state houses and going and finding
[2:07:08.880 --> 2:07:11.920]  who's voting to take your guns and going to their offices and telling them i don't like
[2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:17.960]  what you're doing whether you're from virginia or not this is a national issue and let them
[2:07:17.960 --> 2:07:23.200]  know i know you guys are trying to kick off a civil war and knowing who they are so you
[2:07:23.200 --> 2:07:28.160]  run into them at a pizzeria that night you go hey i told you state rep i'm serious you
[2:07:28.160 --> 2:07:34.800]  don't run them out of there like maxine waters says do to us you just let them know and so
[2:07:34.800 --> 2:07:39.640]  what we've been doing is leading by example comes out that bernie sanders a bunch of people
[2:07:39.640 --> 2:07:43.160]  on this campaign you know varitas has got that whether shutting down all their twitter
[2:07:43.160 --> 2:07:48.240]  accounts for bernie sanders are locking them down how they want to arrest everybody and
[2:07:48.240 --> 2:07:53.360]  redistribute the wealth and how they're going to kill people and all this stuff you go to
[2:07:53.360 --> 2:07:59.840]  the bernie sanders events and just get in his face and believe me it might be a little
[2:07:59.840 --> 2:08:03.000]  scary the first time you do it you're going to feel good after you do and then you're
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:10.040]  going to want to do it more because our acquiescence to this lawlessness has brought us to this point
[2:08:10.040 --> 2:08:16.520]  and if we don't start getting aggressive with our mouths the nwo is going to trigger a violent
[2:08:16.520 --> 2:08:21.840]  race war this country because that's what the chai comms the new order want is a collapse
[2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:26.200]  so they can come in and buy it up for pennies on the dollar they want a radical takeover
[2:08:26.200 --> 2:08:31.760]  of this country to finish their world government and so that's why the fight here is so intense
[2:08:31.760 --> 2:08:38.600]  this is big stuff going on we're very close to winning the hearts and minds that's why
[2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:42.920]  they try to pick those of us that are leaders and destroy us to tell everybody hey you see
[2:08:42.920 --> 2:08:46.560]  what happened alex jones or what's happened to roger stone you sit down and you shut
[2:08:46.560 --> 2:08:51.520]  up and you'll be the same you should instinctively politically rise up against that when someone
[2:08:51.520 --> 2:08:59.160]  threatens you the threat is bowing to that it's better to die on your feet than live
[2:08:59.160 --> 2:09:03.680]  on your knees but the truth is when you stand up for what's right you end up living in a
[2:09:03.680 --> 2:09:12.520]  free prosperous nation of men not of cowards so the default position when people are saying
[2:09:12.520 --> 2:09:17.880]  hell yeah we're going to confiscate your guns hell yeah we're coming for you is to get in
[2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:23.920]  their face so the governor acts like he's scared people coming with guns to get him
[2:09:23.920 --> 2:09:28.480]  no they just have the guns openly carried to show we are the people and exercise that
[2:09:28.480 --> 2:09:33.280]  right to demystify it he declares an emergency to make it look like it's criminal so he can
[2:09:33.280 --> 2:09:39.160]  declare a bigger emergency once they trigger a crisis and now they admit that's their plan
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:46.140]  so it's all materializing ladies and gentlemen but your word of mouth with a chain reaction
[2:09:46.140 --> 2:09:50.880]  about bandod video and fours dot com four slash show those links live feeds can exponentially
[2:09:50.880 --> 2:09:55.320]  via text message and word of mouth even outside of the censored youtube and twitter and all
[2:09:55.320 --> 2:09:59.640]  that get to everybody which is starting to happen so we have a countervailing narrative
[2:09:59.640 --> 2:10:03.080]  of what really goes on because if they stage something they're going to try to cover up
[2:10:03.080 --> 2:10:08.440]  what happened they were able when an antifa operative shot all those folks at that walmart
[2:10:08.440 --> 2:10:13.880]  in south texas to cover up he was antifa the big anti-human leftists now in the state police
[2:10:13.880 --> 2:10:17.800]  report that just came out they were not able to cover up the pennsylvania guy was a devil
[2:10:17.800 --> 2:10:21.720]  worse for antifa well now the state police have issued a big report in texas showing
[2:10:21.720 --> 2:10:26.440]  now the country it's almost exclusively this group these guys are literally demon possessed
[2:10:26.440 --> 2:10:31.960]  activated to go out and do this and they say there's about to be an uprising by them texas
[2:10:31.960 --> 2:10:38.680]  dps domestic terrorists prefer unarmed crowds close quote that story with the live feet
[2:10:38.680 --> 2:10:45.360]  of the show today needs to get out to everyone you know these are the definition of evil
[2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:50.800]  cowards all right let's go to michael in new hampshire finishing up as a marine you were
[2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:57.040]  getting out the fact that you guys are having a discussion about this and is it officers
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:00.400]  telling you that hey you need to really look at the orders that come down and make sure
[2:11:00.400 --> 2:11:07.560]  they're lawful orders to my own awareness level it would be just in the small unit more of
[2:11:07.560 --> 2:11:13.880]  the lower more the nco staff nco base you don't really would hear that coming from any
[2:11:13.880 --> 2:11:21.040]  officers and that's just kind of the way the structure works but at least in the marine
[2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:25.800]  core the small unit leadership would be well aware of this I don't know I can't speak to
[2:11:25.800 --> 2:11:31.600]  the any of their branches but speaking on this to any of them I'm especially in virginia
[2:11:31.600 --> 2:11:36.760]  with the national guard sure what I'm speaking to is the officers should be talking to the
[2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:42.680]  nco's and ordering them to come talk to you they absolutely should well that's probably
[2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:46.240]  all they're talking to you just haven't been told that but what I'm saying is are the other
[2:11:46.240 --> 2:11:51.000]  units you know saying that they're being told this because clearly that's an order I've
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:57.720]  heard I've heard it I've heard it inaccurately from some in different ways they've said similar
[2:11:57.720 --> 2:12:02.480]  things but not out in the open sure because you know trump has signed that order getting
[2:12:02.480 --> 2:12:06.240]  the marines ready to deal with civil unrest in the united states that would only happen
[2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:11.520]  if they have everything went to hell there was an internal civil war correct and like
[2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:16.880]  I said when it comes to this I think refocusing the fact that when the president states is
[2:12:16.880 --> 2:12:22.200]  dealing with one issue you know the asymmetric operations that have been going on since the
[2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:29.120]  arab spring to me at least from my own apparent being able to see it it's all over the place
[2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:34.040]  and it's being hit with like you said a goldfish mine where they're training people to go from
[2:12:34.040 --> 2:12:40.080]  one fire to the next fire and not realizing that if you look five to ten years ago it's
[2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:44.800]  just a new story being written off the old story and no one remembers what's happening
[2:12:44.800 --> 2:12:50.920]  that's right it's the same globalist octopus on record creating the refugee centers training
[2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:55.160]  and breaking down the border setting up the sanctuary cities shipping in the fentanyl
[2:12:55.160 --> 2:13:00.240]  trying to stage the race wars having hollywood the media promote race wars have the democrats
[2:13:00.240 --> 2:13:04.360]  come out and say confiscate guns first it's one guy then it's all the candidates then
[2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:08.200]  suddenly they try to pass laws to take the guns and they declare a civil emergency then
[2:13:08.200 --> 2:13:12.120]  they stage an event to say it's all trumps fault wall the trial in the senate against
[2:13:12.120 --> 2:13:17.280]  you taking place you can see it all coming together and if we simply see that it's not
[2:13:17.280 --> 2:13:24.240]  isolated fires but one enemy howitzer laying down the salvos then americans can unify and
[2:13:24.240 --> 2:13:28.560]  understand this is an external attack no enemy could take us down with the frontal assault
[2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:37.920]  only by pressuring I believe that to be true and the deepest parts of my soul that's right
[2:13:37.920 --> 2:13:42.040]  because you know it's true and I know it's true so we'll post this video of you on band
[2:13:42.040 --> 2:13:45.880]  on video in our discussion here let's make sure it's out of the marines everybody else
[2:13:45.880 --> 2:13:49.880]  and that means mothers and fathers everybody listening you've got to get these dispatches
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:55.200]  out they want us off air and silence so they can pull this off people god bless you I appreciate
[2:13:55.200 --> 2:13:59.320]  your call michael that's why folks call in all the time on the street they go man how
[2:13:59.320 --> 2:14:04.680]  you taking we really appreciate you you know you're just a hero and all this other stuff
[2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:09.760]  and I appreciate your support folks but there's a takeover of our once free nation by really
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:14.840]  nasty globalist let's see chai com systems as the model and they're trying to turn everybody
[2:14:14.840 --> 2:14:18.760]  against each other and they it's admitted in the wiki leaks and documents that we got
[2:14:18.760 --> 2:14:23.680]  from people's families in that fbi confirm where we're accurate of anti of trying to
[2:14:23.680 --> 2:14:30.240]  trigger a race war with soros funding it so again I'm going to explain something if I'm
[2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:35.200]  going down the road and it's icy and I run off the bridge and go into icy water and I
[2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:41.120]  try to get my kids out and I get out I'm not a hero I like my kids I like me well America's
[2:14:41.120 --> 2:14:46.000]  run off in the icy water and we're being told just sit there everything's okay it's a nice
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:49.680]  ice bath no we're going to get the hell out of this vehicle we're going to die trying
[2:14:49.680 --> 2:14:54.600]  and this is it folks this is the move against the country and there were a lot of people
[2:14:54.600 --> 2:14:58.200]  in the system that thought this was crazy so they kind of parlayed and organized and
[2:14:58.200 --> 2:15:02.800]  used the movement we'd already built to get trump in because I believe that we fought
[2:15:02.800 --> 2:15:06.360]  this and exposed this we have a big enough grassroots movement to take over the republican
[2:15:06.360 --> 2:15:09.920]  party to then block the globalist when they made their move I've been saying that for
[2:15:09.920 --> 2:15:14.440]  20 years we did it together we're in a much stronger position now than we're 20 years
[2:15:14.440 --> 2:15:19.320]  ago we've just got to complete the attack on the globalist politically and expose their
[2:15:19.320 --> 2:15:26.280]  treacherous evil asses and explain it's not special to fight this American shouldn't want
[2:15:26.280 --> 2:15:30.600]  to be under chai con programmed rule we shouldn't want to take implausible microchips we shouldn't
[2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:35.120]  want pedophiles teaching five-year-olds in school we shouldn't accept this we should
[2:15:35.120 --> 2:15:40.000]  reject it and I believe you will reject it and even if they kick off a civil war a fire
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:45.600]  one we're going to win that too so let's work hard in the info war right now to avert that
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:55.040]  if the real thing kicks off you know who the globalist are go get them we can all agree

[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:39.160]  because we are effective and the globalist are beginning to lose their war against humanity
[2:19:39.160 --> 2:19:43.160]  in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical
[2:19:43.160 --> 2:19:48.520]  to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an
[2:19:48.520 --> 2:19:57.600]  attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy you're
[2:19:57.600 --> 2:20:04.600]  listening to the alex jones show
[2:03:40.540 --> 2:20:57.160]  we got to the front of the pindling inside very powerful about fc and the rest
[2:20:57.160 --> 2:21:03.160]  of it big techs moving mountains to try to block that information coming out such as
[2:21:03.160 --> 2:21:06.360]  trying to block the fact that the UN lead scientist said that they've covered up vaccine
[2:21:06.360 --> 2:21:11.080]  deaths injuries the majority of their doctors think vaccines are bad and that the public
[2:21:11.080 --> 2:21:16.040]  is becoming enraged because they've been stonewalling but still you get the videos out at band
[2:21:16.040 --> 2:21:26.560]  on video it's life saving so that truck is already with security guys driving to virginia
[2:21:26.560 --> 2:21:31.720]  and will be there legally and lawfully and peacefully throughout the weekend throughout
[2:21:31.720 --> 2:21:37.760]  next week back and forth between dc covering the trial that's pretty much assured to be
[2:21:37.760 --> 2:21:47.560]  starting next week they're passed and handed on the articles now to to the senate that's
[2:21:47.560 --> 2:21:55.560]  going on right now today i wanted to say something about trump they've had the deep state and
[2:21:55.560 --> 2:21:59.560]  the entire corporate media write thousands of articles some of which were published
[2:21:59.560 --> 2:22:06.280]  in hundreds and hundreds of newspapers apiece to get trump to come out against info wars
[2:22:06.280 --> 2:22:11.560]  in a belief that if the president ever came out against info wars that would turn his
[2:22:11.560 --> 2:22:21.560]  main base off against him and that would turn me against the president well only the president
[2:22:21.560 --> 2:22:25.560]  violating his promises would turn me against him and i know he's not perfect so i'm happy
[2:22:25.560 --> 2:22:30.440]  with a lot of what he's done but i'm very upset about letting the big media combines
[2:22:30.440 --> 2:22:34.920]  working with big tech censor and silence millions and millions of americans with ai watching
[2:22:34.920 --> 2:22:38.280]  them in real time and letting third party groups at the southern poverty law center
[2:22:38.280 --> 2:22:43.880]  adl and snopes into the computer programs to watch people at the device level that level
[2:22:43.880 --> 2:22:51.880]  of big brother surveillance is just criminal but that's what the tyrants are doing is bum
[2:22:51.880 --> 2:23:00.360]  rushing us with devices all listening to us and watching us and the cloud and the apple
[2:23:00.360 --> 2:23:04.520]  system you're looking at all your photos and sharing them and all the things they admit
[2:23:04.520 --> 2:23:11.000]  they do look at how we've allowed ourselves to be trampled on so when i pull back from
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:16.760]  this though trump never betrayed info wars in that every time they attack trump and say you better
[2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:22.280]  say you hate alex jones trump doesn't deny info wars he starts tweeting info wars videos and articles
[2:23:22.280 --> 2:23:27.400]  out enraging them even more to the point now when he tweets an info wars article or video
[2:23:27.400 --> 2:23:32.920]  the media doesn't even pick it up they just get pissed so trump's signaling there that hey i support
[2:23:32.920 --> 2:23:43.720]  you guys and so trump understands how the media will pick somebody demonize them and get everybody
[2:23:43.720 --> 2:23:49.240]  to then turn their backs on that person so that when they pick the next person nobody stands up
[2:23:49.240 --> 2:23:55.800]  for them as well and pretty soon everybody's left alone so trump has stood by info wars in our sources
[2:23:55.800 --> 2:24:02.920]  in the white house and and the things trumps done to a point not sticking up for the first amendment
[2:24:02.920 --> 2:24:07.640]  allowing big tech cartels to censor and mass that's been a betrayal of the american people and have
[2:24:07.640 --> 2:24:15.480]  trump himself trump believes though that as they persecute us and as they try to take the guns
[2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:20.040]  that's going to enrage you and wake you up even more and get you into action and he knows you
[2:24:20.040 --> 2:24:25.400]  have the real power so he believes we're completing a political realignment against the globalist
[2:24:25.400 --> 2:24:30.840]  right now as long as he can stay in power it will only invoke them to be more radical more crazy
[2:24:30.840 --> 2:24:37.640]  more out of control causing again an even bigger wake up and so far when it comes to a big wake
[2:24:37.640 --> 2:24:44.600]  up that's very deep and across the board yes it's happening i just don't know how long the american
[2:24:44.600 --> 2:24:49.240]  people can hang on and i just think it's very risky to let the democrats of the deep state
[2:24:49.240 --> 2:24:53.560]  keep trying especially when they're funded by the chai comms to cause a giant race war they
[2:24:53.560 --> 2:24:59.000]  could get out of control so i really think trumps waited too long and it's overbaking the brownies
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:04.520]  here or overbaking the pie or the bread i mean it's done even from that egalitarian dialectic
[2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:08.920]  it needs to stop this is out of control and they're trying to impeach him and now they're
[2:25:08.920 --> 2:25:14.120]  trying to remove him he's in a criminal trial in the in the senate i mean that's the the equivalent
[2:25:14.120 --> 2:25:22.280]  of it and it's very dangerous but i'll say this we just called up some of the pro gun groups and
[2:25:22.280 --> 2:25:27.560]  virginia and said hey why don't you come on the show and they're like oh oh you're Alex Jones as
[2:25:27.560 --> 2:25:32.680]  you talk controversial we don't want to be associated with that associated with who got the president
[2:25:32.680 --> 2:25:38.520]  elected associated with the first amendment not even getting the instinct of who cares what the media
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:44.680]  says about you they say you're a bunch of white supremacist terrorists i don't need to be loved
[2:25:44.680 --> 2:25:50.840]  by the couple of organizers of a rally who are going to sit up there and and and talk to a crowd
[2:25:50.840 --> 2:25:55.560]  but the media is not going to pick up a damn word you say it's you that has the power of what your
[2:25:55.560 --> 2:26:03.080]  message is not how you let them put you in a box so it's the amateur nature of a lot of
[2:26:03.080 --> 2:26:07.240]  political activists and then they look at somebody who's been very very successful with our audience
[2:26:07.240 --> 2:26:14.360]  that gets it rebooting america but we're always being led by a bunch of political novices uh who
[2:26:14.360 --> 2:26:18.840]  again see someone being attacked and demonized and so they back away from and well they tried
[2:26:18.840 --> 2:26:23.720]  that with trump saying he's a rapist and saying he's a kkk member but people knew it was bull stood
[2:26:23.720 --> 2:26:28.840]  with the president it made it even more powerful so they've tried to do what they've tried to do
[2:26:28.840 --> 2:26:34.360]  with to trump to me and it's not been successful with smart people of every race color and creed
[2:26:34.360 --> 2:26:41.000]  across this country but it has been successful with a lot of the libertarian or conservative
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:47.080]  movement of people that are getting politically active and trying to organize things that that
[2:26:47.080 --> 2:26:51.400]  they really believe that the media is attacking somebody you better not get narrow because that
[2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:56.120]  means you'll get attacked they don't get the fact that if you're effective you're going to be attacked
[2:26:56.120 --> 2:27:01.240]  and you should embrace that and the real leadership of america and people that want freedom and justice
[2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:07.960]  get that and understand that oh alex jones has been sent child porn in the sandy hook case yeah
[2:27:07.960 --> 2:27:12.840]  because the globalists are scared and they admitted it was an unopened email to our company
[2:27:12.840 --> 2:27:18.840]  that the establishment subpoenaed gotten found and showed hidden scans of it to try to but people
[2:27:18.840 --> 2:27:25.400]  went that's bull it's jones exposes the pedophiles so it goes back to when people come see how are
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:29.640]  you taking it i'm like how are you taking it our country's being taken over i'm fighting i expect to
[2:27:29.640 --> 2:27:34.360]  get attacked but it's the way people want to have their cake and eat it too fight the globalist
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:40.360]  fight for freedom fight for justice but then someone who's been a general in the fight for decades
[2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:46.440]  and who's who's whose army of activists have taken us to victory these people don't even have the
[2:27:46.440 --> 2:27:51.960]  instincts to sign on to that because they think it's all about them being political leaders
[2:27:51.960 --> 2:27:57.720]  and viable for whatever when it's not even gonna matter in the future if we don't change things
[2:27:57.720 --> 2:28:03.960]  and stop over calculating and stop trying to be politicos and stop trying to polish our image
[2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:09.000]  and roll our sleeves up and expose that the democrats are chi-com enemy funded and are
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:13.160]  literally trying to bring the entire country down and are trying to trigger a civil war
[2:28:13.720 --> 2:28:20.040]  and the average conservative activists around the country can't even get their act together
[2:28:20.040 --> 2:28:24.840]  meanwhile the main groups that have financed trump and had some of the biggest fundraisers for him
[2:28:24.840 --> 2:28:28.520]  for six months have been trying to get me to go on speaking tours and do these big events
[2:28:28.520 --> 2:28:33.240]  and i was so busy i said no until i realized wait a minute the big smart republicans that
[2:28:33.240 --> 2:28:37.000]  helped get trump in they know where the liberty movement's going they get this is the future
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:42.200]  they're smart enough to want it for us but the very grassroots we awoken a bunch of them are
[2:28:42.200 --> 2:28:46.680]  trying to be the new politicos what a joke i'll be there in the armored vehicle the whole crowd

[2:29:24.440 --> 2:29:28.520]  than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem

[2:31:50.920 --> 2:31:56.840]  special today at info wars store dot com i want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste
[2:31:56.840 --> 2:32:02.200]  because i hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and um i told alexa said man
[2:32:02.200 --> 2:32:05.720]  this is the best toothpaste i've ever tried he's like well what are you doing just sitting in here
[2:32:05.720 --> 2:32:10.840]  telling me you got to get up there and tell people and oh so here i am telling people super
[2:32:10.840 --> 2:32:16.680]  silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste i've ever tried and i'm 45 years old
[2:32:16.680 --> 2:32:21.720]  and i've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free i think the big difference the
[2:32:21.720 --> 2:32:27.240]  game changer in this is the coral calcium because after i brush my teeth with this they feel so clean
[2:32:27.240 --> 2:32:32.040]  and the toothpaste that i don't even like rinse out my mouth after i brush my teeth with this it
[2:32:32.040 --> 2:32:38.440]  feels so good it feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth in fact i find
[2:32:38.440 --> 2:32:44.200]  myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because i like
[2:32:44.200 --> 2:33:02.680]  the way it feels you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:14.520 --> 2:33:16.680]  oh
[2:33:16.680 --> 2:33:39.160]  oh
[2:33:47.400 --> 2:33:51.320]  all right
[2:33:51.320 --> 2:33:54.760]  we're back live ladies and gentlemen i want to just say one more thing about what i talked about
[2:33:54.760 --> 2:34:04.360]  last segment this isn't about me you understand i'm always saying don't go to rallies go into the
[2:34:04.360 --> 2:34:09.320]  capitals and talk to the politicians yourself and go with their meet and greets out the field
[2:34:09.320 --> 2:34:14.280]  and get in their face or run against them and then be on the podiums and in the debates against them
[2:34:14.280 --> 2:34:19.000]  that's how you are most effective it's good to have rallies to and then have our own media
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:24.120]  and report on them but the mainstream media isn't who you care about they're going to distort you
[2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:30.680]  so trump doesn't ever deny info wars and trump says he likes info wars and trump tweets info
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:35.560]  wars when the media tells him not to because he understands not being bullied by the media
[2:34:36.920 --> 2:34:42.040]  but then we're just trying to get people on to promote their virginia rally and they're like
[2:34:42.040 --> 2:34:49.560]  whoa whoa whoa uh you know alex jones you're too controversial it's amateur hour i don't need to be
[2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:54.200]  up at your podium dummy i can go in front of a press conference or have it at the capital
[2:34:54.200 --> 2:35:02.600]  with 50 cameras they all turn on to me it's like satan showed up to these people it's that you
[2:35:02.600 --> 2:35:07.160]  don't have the instincts and i'm not attacking the leaders of the thing there's a bunch of groups
[2:35:07.160 --> 2:35:13.800]  and things i'm just talking about amateur hour in general so president trump likes info wars
[2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:18.680]  president trump tweets it but the people that think they're going to stop gun confiscation
[2:35:18.680 --> 2:35:23.560]  in virginia at least the ones organizing stuff they're like oh alex jones and again it's that
[2:35:23.560 --> 2:35:29.160]  amateurism that continues to let the mainstream media have this power when they have almost no
[2:35:29.160 --> 2:35:33.720]  viewers to intimidate people you know cnn takes people sponsors up they call their sponsors
[2:35:33.720 --> 2:35:37.320]  and go you're a sponsor of this we're going to report if you don't drop this group it's torches
[2:35:37.320 --> 2:35:43.240]  interference oh who just seeing it oh when chick filet got boycotted they doubled their money
[2:35:44.920 --> 2:35:51.960]  now they start bowing they start losing money it's just a joke syrian girls popping in if ranger

[2:36:05.720 --> 2:36:09.480]  bracken who's really been warning of this and has been central in exposing how they'll plan a
[2:36:09.480 --> 2:36:14.200]  false flag and it's unfolding just like he said it would he's going to be hosting uh in the next
[2:36:14.200 --> 2:36:19.000]  hour so please spread the word on that because everything is about getting the word out here

[2:36:55.960 --> 2:37:01.240]  unfolding there on where she sees all this going thanks for joining us syrian girl thanks so much
[2:37:01.240 --> 2:37:08.440]  for having me on so just an update uh trump obviously has signaled that if any of the
[2:37:08.440 --> 2:37:12.600]  demonstrators get hurt we may do something i think that's good on the surface that might
[2:37:12.600 --> 2:37:17.480]  encourage the opposition groups to launch attacks now to get iran to attack them and now
[2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:21.800]  we're kind of drug in by that and i think that's what we've seen restart and others kind of say
[2:37:21.800 --> 2:37:29.800]  well i think uh there's they're not going to do anything directly against iran because yet last
[2:37:29.800 --> 2:37:35.240]  week you know trump actually did the right thing in not escalating further when the us base was
[2:37:35.240 --> 2:37:42.120]  attacked so i think that if you know if if a us base gets attacked and they don't want to get
[2:37:42.840 --> 2:37:48.440]  directly involved with warring with iran like that's their causes belly right there so i don't
[2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:53.720]  think we're going to see any of that but like last week i think i told you guys that iran would
[2:37:53.720 --> 2:37:58.840]  retaliate without question but i think the important thing to talk about now i think is that trump
[2:37:58.840 --> 2:38:06.680]  was set up i think that uh now we've learned that as as per said all that false intelligence about
[2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:14.200]  imminent threat uh was bogus and uh actually trump said that uh well he didn't say that there's a
[2:38:14.200 --> 2:38:20.360]  article that's come out by a business insider that said that he's been saying that um he was pressured
[2:38:20.360 --> 2:38:26.200]  into this attack by like lindsay graham and other gop senators because he had impeachment
[2:38:26.200 --> 2:38:31.480]  hanging over his head so the people who have been responsible for this debacle are actually lindsay
[2:38:31.480 --> 2:38:39.720]  graham and um nazi palosi so who was the driving force behind this impeachment so they're kind of
[2:38:39.720 --> 2:38:45.640]  good cop bad copying him the neocons are pressuring him into war and actually you know in october
[2:38:45.640 --> 2:38:50.840]  i made a video on my channel saying that i believe impeachment was a form of blackmail that they're
[2:38:50.840 --> 2:38:57.000]  trying to use against trump because at that time at that very same moment but october was when he
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:01.240]  was trying to pull troops out of syria suddenly this impeachment thing is hanging over his head
[2:39:02.840 --> 2:39:06.600]  and then we had as you mentioned the secretary of defense kind of throw trump out of the bus but
[2:39:06.600 --> 2:39:15.400]  now obama's former national security advisor james jones says trump is right so there is a lot of
[2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:19.720]  weirdness going on and as you said some of the democrats behind the scenes have been pressuring
[2:39:19.720 --> 2:39:23.640]  with the neocons for solemony's death now they're talking about impeaching trump for it
[2:39:25.640 --> 2:39:31.240]  yeah that's right it's a setup you know he was the full guy they pressured him into it and now
[2:39:31.240 --> 2:39:36.680]  all the consequences that happened since is they're trying to make it his fault well obviously where
[2:39:36.680 --> 2:39:41.560]  did this false intelligence come from it didn't come from him so you know at the end of the day
[2:39:41.560 --> 2:39:49.640]  this is a debacle because they you know they probably told him that iran wouldn't retaliate
[2:39:49.640 --> 2:39:56.600]  probably they were expecting so as pompeo was tweeting that you know they're going to de-escalate
[2:39:56.600 --> 2:40:01.640]  they're going to negotiate a new deal but that's not that's exactly the opposite of what anyone
[2:40:01.640 --> 2:40:07.320]  could see anyone who isn't a neocon could see that it was going to end up escalating and the
[2:40:07.320 --> 2:40:12.840]  possibility of world war three was on the table and i think that's why trump decided to de-escalate
[2:40:13.400 --> 2:40:22.360]  and not retaliate he realized it was all you know a lie and it's it's interesting now that we have
[2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:28.520]  putin talking to the united nations about how the nuclear powers need to come together to neutralize
[2:40:28.520 --> 2:40:37.080]  the threat of global war which is what we're facing putin earlier today gave a speech five nuclear
[2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:42.200]  armed states must work together to neutralize the threat of global war here's some of what
[2:40:42.200 --> 2:40:49.640]  the leader of russia had to say it's time to understand our responsibility and the example
[2:40:49.640 --> 2:40:59.320]  must be said by the founders of the un five nuclear states have this ability to maintain the
[2:40:59.320 --> 2:41:05.080]  sustainable development of the mankind these five nations must start with the measures of
[2:41:05.880 --> 2:41:12.360]  getting rid of the preconditions for the global war coming up with approaches to come up with
[2:41:12.360 --> 2:41:17.320]  stability how do you think the deep state is going to come at trump next and what's the word on the
[2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:25.320]  middle east what's coming out of persia well you know these protests that are going on the driving
[2:41:25.320 --> 2:41:35.960]  as i told you guys during the arab spring of 2011 you know they were at that time we were being
[2:41:35.960 --> 2:41:40.760]  fed the stuff about democracy but of course it turned out to be the muslim brotherhood
[2:41:41.320 --> 2:41:46.520]  which is what i told you guys in 2012 so at the moment they're telling us that these protests in
[2:41:46.520 --> 2:41:54.280]  iran are about you know women's rights and democracy etc but really the driving force behind it is this
[2:41:54.280 --> 2:42:01.960]  group called the mek which in 2012 was delisted off the terrorist group list that the state
[2:42:01.960 --> 2:42:08.760]  department has so pre 2012 pre the arab spring these guys were designated a terrorist organization
[2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:12.840]  just like the muslim brotherhood and what they are is like an extremist communist cult
[2:42:12.840 --> 2:42:23.720]  so like just because you know a theocracy that forces people into you know wearing a headscarf
[2:42:23.720 --> 2:42:31.000]  it's a bad thing doesn't mean like this communist cult is a good alternative we need to really become
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:36.280]  more cynical about really what's happening in iran obviously it's related to current events
[2:42:36.280 --> 2:42:43.160]  obviously the state department and the new cause they don't want the iranian regime or government to
[2:42:43.160 --> 2:42:49.080]  be in power and they are very skilled at you know putting a lot of money into these people all right
[2:42:49.080 --> 2:42:52.680]  steering girl thanks for the update we'll be back with more calls and then matt bracken
[2:42:53.800 --> 2:43:00.920]  knock on wood i am not tempting faith but everybody around the office especially folks
[2:43:00.920 --> 2:43:07.000]  that have worked there a long time have noticed that i really don't ever get sick now again i might
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:12.440]  get sick tomorrow because i just made that statement i'm not tempting faith i'll say that again because
[2:43:12.440 --> 2:43:16.440]  i am superstitious when it comes down to that i'm very thankful the good lord for the constitution
[2:43:17.080 --> 2:43:23.320]  i've been given but up until about eight nine years ago when i started taking x2
[2:43:24.120 --> 2:43:29.560]  the products in force life i i still got sick every couple years and you know i still get
[2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:36.280]  sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that but now that i religiously take the
[2:43:36.280 --> 2:43:41.880]  products at info wars life or the highest quality stuff much you're gonna find out there i just never
[2:43:41.880 --> 2:43:51.000]  get a fever anymore it's probably been three four years since i've had a fever it's just crazy so i
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:59.720]  chalk it up genetics and the great products hey you there we have a problem you see there is a baby
[2:44:00.520 --> 2:44:07.560]  the mother of this baby is not sure she's ready the father of this baby doesn't want to settle down
[2:44:08.440 --> 2:44:15.960]  the mother starts to have regrets the father considers leaving town but a friend says
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:24.920]  there's a solution she says to have an abortion the mother decides to look into it the clinic
[2:44:24.920 --> 2:44:32.600]  assures her it's safe she's made her decision she's going to have an abortion the problem is
[2:44:32.600 --> 2:44:45.160]  that baby is you join me oh and shroyer at the march for life friday january 24th in washington dc
[2:44:45.160 --> 2:44:51.560]  noon at the national mall i'll see you there it's time to stand up for the unborn it's time to speak
[2:44:51.560 --> 2:44:59.320]  out for the voiceless if you understand why the globalist why the servants of satan hate info
[2:44:59.320 --> 2:45:07.160]  wars it's because we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving up that's why
[2:45:07.160 --> 2:45:12.600]  it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new world order's plans to not get down when
[2:45:12.600 --> 2:45:18.520]  they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us that's what we should expect because we
[2:45:18.520 --> 2:45:24.120]  are hurting these scumbags the globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:29.800]  they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress
[2:45:29.800 --> 2:45:36.600]  and dominate and destroy the innocent it is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves
[2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:44.920]  but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake
[2:45:44.920 --> 2:45:51.880]  they fear the fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we love god and that's all we ever
[2:45:51.880 --> 2:45:57.560]  have to know is that god is in charge you want to break some globalist ribs you want to crush
[2:45:57.560 --> 2:46:02.600]  some skulls politically you want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually there's
[2:46:02.600 --> 2:46:09.160]  nowhere you can spend money there's nowhere you can place your bed in a fight where it's gonna
[2:46:09.160 --> 2:46:16.040]  have more power per dollar your bang for your buck here gets you great products at great prices
[2:46:16.040 --> 2:46:22.120]  that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy
[2:46:22.120 --> 2:46:27.160]  and so it's very simple if you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to
[2:46:27.160 --> 2:46:33.240]  the enemy which god wants to see you see we have to make the effort 110 god will finish the move
[2:46:33.240 --> 2:46:38.520]  and i know i need to stay in the fight in the attack attack attack i want to attack i want to go
[2:46:38.520 --> 2:46:42.120]  after the globalists and just believe me ladies and gentlemen that if you want somebody to commit
[2:46:42.120 --> 2:46:45.960]  to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together you've got to guarantee you keep
[2:46:45.960 --> 2:46:50.520]  me in the game i'm going to bust my ass with everything i've got for us for myself and my
[2:46:50.520 --> 2:46:54.280]  family for your family because we're in this together info or store dot com
[2:46:54.280 --> 2:47:10.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:15.320 --> 2:47:19.320]  all right i'm going to take calls from james and michael we've been holding one's army national
[2:47:19.320 --> 2:47:23.000]  guard on the gun confiscation topic same thing with michael army on gun confiscation
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:26.360]  appreciate them holding the Syrian girl i wanted you to be able to finish up what do you think
[2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:31.960]  trump should do uh about what the neocons are up to and what's happening with iran
[2:47:33.800 --> 2:47:40.040]  you know i think trump first and foremost needs to name names he needs to name who's been responsible
[2:47:40.040 --> 2:47:45.480]  for you know get coming up with the false intelligence and pressuring him lindsay graham
[2:47:45.480 --> 2:47:51.320]  nancy Pelosi the impeachment uh also he can take the opportunity now because iraqi parliament
[2:47:51.320 --> 2:47:57.080]  has requested for us troops to leave and the neocons are threatening them
[2:47:58.280 --> 2:48:03.000]  financially because they want so badly to remain in iraq that they won't respect the
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:08.600]  democracy that they supposedly set up and they're trying to say that they're going to cut their
[2:48:08.600 --> 2:48:14.600]  access to the to the fed so in order to sell their oil and add sanctions on top of that
[2:48:14.600 --> 2:48:19.640]  all this crazy stuff trump has an opportunity now to use that fact that the parliament is asking
[2:48:19.640 --> 2:48:24.600]  for a u.s. trip withdrawal to pull troops out i know in october he wanted to pull troops out of
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:30.840]  syria they came up with this impeachment stuff to pressure him uh he obviously wants to pull out
[2:48:30.840 --> 2:48:36.840]  otherwise he wouldn't say that they're in syria just for the oil i feel like he's saying that just
[2:48:36.840 --> 2:48:42.280]  so he can humiliate the people around him that want to be in syria and and add you know because he
[2:48:42.280 --> 2:48:48.280]  does want to pull out so um i think that what he needs to do is defend himself and not be the full
[2:48:48.280 --> 2:48:54.920]  guy on this solemanny assassination by my naming names and perhaps you know making more statements
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:49:03.160]  about possible pullout uh from iraq and syria as well thanks for your perspective i've got to say
[2:49:03.160 --> 2:49:06.920]  though you've been vindicated with the deep state both republican and democrats some of them trying
[2:49:06.920 --> 2:49:11.720]  to say trump you know was a bad guy and trump lied about this stuff and then it comes out that they
[2:49:11.720 --> 2:49:17.400]  did give him that intelligence it's just so macky of ellie how they operate searing girl thanks for
[2:49:17.400 --> 2:49:24.120]  the time thank you so much for having me on thank you now ladies and gentlemen
[2:49:25.640 --> 2:49:28.440]  i want to take a few final calls here and then i'm going to try to
[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:34.280]  take a five minute break at the start of the next segment to play some gun confiscation clips
[2:49:34.840 --> 2:49:40.040]  because there's a lot of things i want to say it's not that i'm tired i've just read so many
[2:49:40.040 --> 2:49:43.640]  articles looked at so much news but i want to just take a break for five minutes and get
[2:49:43.640 --> 2:49:50.920]  refocused to say some things i've got to say here on air because it's now not just an intellectual
[2:49:50.920 --> 2:49:57.800]  or political thing that's theoretical
[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:08.920]  there's no doubt that there is a large number of really serious criminals in this country
[2:50:08.920 --> 2:50:13.880]  working with multinational corporations that's communist chinese to take this country down
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:19.400]  and they're the ones that have escalated the threat level they're the ones on the continuation
[2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:25.960]  of force scale that have brought us to this and i'm not somebody that likes violence or somebody
[2:50:25.960 --> 2:50:32.280]  that wants physical conflict and i'm not in a position to lead it and i'm not going to be involved
[2:50:32.280 --> 2:50:38.440]  in it uh offensively everybody knows i just state my intentions that's my secret weapon is just
[2:50:38.440 --> 2:50:44.360]  straight shooting just it's it's i am what you get i'm just we're starting to get to a point
[2:50:44.360 --> 2:50:50.200]  that as a citizen who's sworn enough publicly to defend my family and your family and our honor
[2:50:51.080 --> 2:50:55.560]  that we need to be very peaceful and very focused and very active right now
[2:50:58.120 --> 2:51:03.400]  and then we have to understand that if we don't bust our ass to get these people's face and and
[2:51:03.400 --> 2:51:10.760]  really let them know we're watching them that the chai comms the globalists know they can sit
[2:51:10.760 --> 2:51:15.800]  this out they think they can and so they are intending to start a shooting war in the country
[2:51:15.800 --> 2:51:20.600]  and there's a good chance it's going to start so we better start having a discussion about what
[2:51:20.600 --> 2:51:27.000]  we're going to do so that's that and if the president would have arrested some of the deep
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:32.920]  state gosh he's got plenty to do it and let the chips fall where they may if they try to bring
[2:51:32.920 --> 2:51:37.400]  out some dirt on some of the trump people nobody's gonna care as long as he's pro-american
[2:51:37.960 --> 2:51:43.000]  and it's not screwing kids or something we're gonna support him okay people understand we need
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:50.200]  action now okay enough talk and i i'm not saying it's my pay grade to say what we should do i don't
[2:51:50.200 --> 2:51:55.720]  think the president knows we're all above our pay grade here it's just that we're not in normal
[2:51:55.720 --> 2:52:04.360]  situations now and the democrats are a bunch of insane methods who are minions and are paid for
[2:52:04.360 --> 2:52:08.840]  by the globalist so they're not even leaders so the real people running this are sitting back
[2:52:08.840 --> 2:52:14.200]  thinking they're insulated and they're not insulated and they even know they're not insulated
[2:52:15.320 --> 2:52:20.920]  and so push is coming to shove all right james and virginia no no james is next michael's been
[2:52:20.920 --> 2:52:26.840]  holding longer michael in ohio army on gun confiscation thanks for holding go ahead thank you for
[2:52:26.840 --> 2:52:31.880]  taking my call alexa it's an honor to speak to you um i'm a veteran of the united states army and
[2:52:31.880 --> 2:52:38.360]  i served under uh president obama unfortunately and how i came on to your show is we were starting
[2:52:38.360 --> 2:52:44.520]  to get like slideshows from the top from this company called the southern poverty law center
[2:52:44.520 --> 2:52:48.440]  and i turned to my buddy and i was like see they're telling us like they're telling us what to
[2:52:48.440 --> 2:52:52.360]  believe them like this is going against our religion because i did this with some alexon type
[2:52:52.360 --> 2:52:57.240]  stuff and i was like the 911 conspiracy guy and he's like dude he's right he's like listen to him
[2:52:57.240 --> 2:53:01.480]  with me after work and the more i listened to him the more i was like wow this is really bad
[2:53:02.120 --> 2:53:10.760]  and then it wasn't but a couple weeks later we started getting um like surveys or censuses to
[2:53:10.760 --> 2:53:16.600]  try and see like what we would do as soldiers and one of the questions was would we go and
[2:53:16.600 --> 2:53:22.680]  confiscate weapons from the american people and we were like oh my god he's he's absolutely right
[2:53:23.240 --> 2:53:28.600]  and we tried to tell people about this and no one no one would cover it no one would talk to us about
[2:53:28.600 --> 2:53:35.720]  it or anything and we tried to raise the alarm about this but our response as a unit as a whole
[2:53:35.720 --> 2:53:42.120]  like your previous caller was talking about we were told that uh that if we ever got that order
[2:53:42.120 --> 2:53:47.560]  whoever gave it to us our lieutenant or our company commander we would have them removed
[2:53:47.560 --> 2:53:54.120]  by any means necessary but this is absolutely real what is happening we were at the beginning
[2:53:54.120 --> 2:53:59.000]  stages of it and they realized that they can't use the military as their pawns and that's why
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:05.000]  they're doing this new impact because the same stuff is continuing to go on it's just behind
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:10.360]  the scenes because trump is president now wow michael i really appreciate you holding for so
[2:54:10.360 --> 2:54:14.200]  long to say that i want you to be able to spend a few minutes with us and then we'll get to james
[2:54:14.200 --> 2:54:20.040]  too but to flesh out because i remember there was the questionnaires under clinton people couldn't
[2:54:20.040 --> 2:54:24.680]  believe it and turn out it was real the ones under obama i remember that was what two three years
[2:54:24.680 --> 2:54:28.840]  after he got in was the ones we learned about then they had the threat assessment saying gun owners
[2:54:28.840 --> 2:54:33.720]  and veterans were the number one threat because when they assessed the veterans and got back uh
[2:54:33.720 --> 2:54:37.480]  well not even the veterans the act of duty uh non-commissioned officers it was something
[2:54:37.480 --> 2:54:42.840]  like 98 percent said uh no in fact we'll shoot who gives the order which is what you're supposed
[2:54:42.840 --> 2:54:47.160]  to do in this country uh and until a few decades ago they taught that in the military that if you
[2:54:47.160 --> 2:54:53.160]  get that order you kill who gives it uh and so they're attempting to turn you against the american
[2:54:53.160 --> 2:54:59.080]  people is what woke up military and law enforcement the attempt of the southern primary law center in
[2:54:59.080 --> 2:55:04.920]  adl and all these creepy groups to come in and do that is what finally made the military and police
[2:55:04.920 --> 2:55:09.960]  go wow alex jones is right and that's what made our show get even bigger well suddenly they were
[2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:15.000]  all tuning in because they knew we told the truth we'd been given that by officers in the military
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:19.800]  before it ever got to you so i was warned by the military because obviously the officers didn't have
[2:55:19.800 --> 2:55:25.160]  a way to get it to you then i got it to you and then i got the credit and the hate and it's not
[2:55:25.160 --> 2:55:31.080]  about credit people need to know the chain of how this happened uh and so it's deadly dangerous right
[2:55:31.080 --> 2:55:35.160]  now what do you make of what they're attempting in virginia and other areas and what do you think
[2:55:35.160 --> 2:55:39.960]  trump needs to do because i'm not somebody that wants us to be a shooting war but what are we
[2:55:39.960 --> 2:55:46.520]  going to do if the democrats start one um i think what they're trying to do um we're this whole the
[2:55:46.520 --> 2:55:53.240]  whole un saying job application went spread like wildfire what they want is they they want us to be
[2:55:53.240 --> 2:56:02.520]  baited into an incident where they can set up some kind of red flag so that they can the governor
[2:56:02.520 --> 2:56:10.280]  of virginia can set up his um marshal wall and shut everything down but the thing is like people
[2:56:10.280 --> 2:56:15.880]  have to understand where is the white house you know so if he shuts down virginia and they do
[2:56:15.880 --> 2:56:21.400]  this prompt impeachment thing and you get a couple wildcard republicans that turn code at the last
[2:56:21.400 --> 2:56:26.840]  second and virginia is completely shut down we don't have access to do anything so exactly stay
[2:56:26.840 --> 2:56:31.560]  there i want to come back to you and go back to the questionnaire when it happened this is historic
[2:56:31.560 --> 2:56:35.480]  we've got these calls years ago it's been in the news a few times but people need to hear it from
[2:56:35.480 --> 2:56:39.480]  somebody that experienced it don't hang up back in two minutes but i just want to say something
[2:56:39.480 --> 2:56:46.600]  here folks this is really happening i can't believe it but it's really happening and behind the scenes
[2:56:46.600 --> 2:56:51.000]  if you knew what's going on you know how dangerous it is you heard that state police officer who talks
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:55.160]  the higher ups and they're all getting threatened when this goes down you do what you're told will
[2:56:55.160 --> 2:57:01.080]  indict you so they've got the blue cities that are already lawless under un they're already breaking
[2:57:01.080 --> 2:57:05.720]  the borders they're trying to break the economy they're trying to take the president out and and
[2:57:05.720 --> 2:57:11.320]  the president i respect the president and i think he knows what he's doing with what he's got because
[2:57:11.320 --> 2:57:16.680]  he's got moles all under him he hasn't got even partial control of the executive we can't expect
[2:57:16.680 --> 2:57:23.080]  him stuck on a beachhead under attack to be perfect but he needs to rhetorically come out in these
[2:57:23.080 --> 2:57:28.200]  speeches and talk about the deep state and talk about virginia and get ahead of it because
[2:57:28.200 --> 2:57:32.120]  biden and all of them are betting all their marbles on it months ago telling you they're
[2:57:32.120 --> 2:57:37.320]  going to strike in virginia and history does repeat itself this country was born in virginia in

[3:00:03.720 --> 3:00:11.640]  here now aerated sirens are a good archetypal image of incoming crisis by the big article just
[3:00:11.640 --> 3:00:16.920]  broke at zero hedge dot com we'll post it in full wars dot com abstein traffic girls is recently
[3:00:16.920 --> 3:00:23.960]  in 2018 son is shown as 11 new reports come out of course we were broke two weeks three weeks ago
[3:00:23.960 --> 3:00:29.160]  that his brother's still running a company recruiting young women that look like they're 15 years old
[3:00:29.160 --> 3:00:36.440]  and by the woman given immunity in the last case 13 years ago she's involved in it the media knows
[3:00:36.440 --> 3:00:44.760]  will not touch it letting guardian made one mention of it head you inside it says we've
[3:00:44.760 --> 3:00:51.560]  covered up vaccine deaths the doctors are turning against us zero coverage except for people that
[3:00:51.560 --> 3:00:56.120]  know about this show and band i video we're going to finish up with michael and james here and then
[3:00:56.120 --> 3:01:00.440]  it's mike adams today who's one of the only other people other than matt bracken covering
[3:01:00.440 --> 3:01:06.200]  virginia before it got big he is an expert on it it's bracken's tomorrow so i misspoke earlier sorry
[3:01:06.200 --> 3:01:10.920]  my days switched here a lot of stuff going on uh but michael finishing up go go back to the time
[3:01:10.920 --> 3:01:16.280]  the place if you can uh the questionnaire you've got about confiscating guns and what that was like
[3:01:18.120 --> 3:01:22.920]  uh yeah i was um i was with 10th mountain division and uh fort drum new york and
[3:01:22.920 --> 3:01:31.240]  and it was about 2009 or 2010 when this uh when this questionnaire came out and to say that we were
[3:01:31.240 --> 3:01:37.160]  we were shocked that this was even a question that was being asked i mean uh because there's
[3:01:37.160 --> 3:01:43.080]  a reason when you take your oath that it's the first thing that you do that's your first thing
[3:01:43.080 --> 3:01:48.920]  that you do in the military is you take your oath of innocence and all the members of the military
[3:01:48.920 --> 3:01:56.760]  need to remember that that is first for a reason and this attempt to wipe the constitution across
[3:01:56.760 --> 3:02:02.360]  the ground we need to remember that not just all service members but all veterans as well
[3:02:02.360 --> 3:02:07.960]  that oath doesn't expire just because you get out of the military that is an oath that is for life
[3:02:08.760 --> 3:02:16.040]  and to see these things working like being an active member of the military you're going to
[3:02:16.040 --> 3:02:22.040]  be torn of what is the right thing to do but you need to go back to your oath and remember that's
[3:02:22.040 --> 3:02:29.160]  the first thing for a reason the good news is though you say this really woke up your unit
[3:02:30.920 --> 3:02:36.760]  oh absolutely um i mean we were kind of looking at our sergeants you know our team leaders and
[3:02:36.760 --> 3:02:41.640]  our squad leaders when we were getting this like is this serious like is this a joke can we even ask
[3:02:41.640 --> 3:02:47.080]  our first sergeant and they kind of the further up we went the more it was kind of like it's just
[3:02:47.080 --> 3:02:53.000]  the questionnaire they're just asking and it was like why are they asking though this shouldn't even
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:58.920]  be talked about and we all agreed that we were going to find it the same way and if we were ever
[3:02:58.920 --> 3:03:04.360]  given these orders we would remove whoever gave us this order by any means necessary and by any
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:11.000]  means necessary means by any means necessary and you're absolutely right when you say it every day
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:20.440]  the answer to 84 is 1776 well everybody's going to get a chance to test their medal here soon
[3:03:20.440 --> 3:03:26.520]  one way or another because the justice department is not rounding up these groups
[3:03:28.520 --> 3:03:32.120]  because the chai comms are so deeply embedded and i guess it's like trying to remove a giant
[3:03:32.120 --> 3:03:36.920]  tumor off the heart there'll be no heart left and i don't know how you go in and remove these people
[3:03:36.920 --> 3:03:42.760]  when they're so dug in but it's just anybody that's been a never trump or anybody that's been a neocon
[3:03:42.760 --> 3:03:47.080]  anybody that's worked for sorrows at a high level and made new world order statements anti-american
[3:03:47.080 --> 3:03:50.840]  statements just needs to get the hell out of this country they're the ones trying to break the nation
[3:03:50.840 --> 3:03:55.800]  trying to destroy it and they are enemy combatants they've declared that the country is their enemy
[3:03:55.800 --> 3:03:59.720]  they've worked for foreign powers against it and now they're trying to cause a civil war and i'm
[3:03:59.720 --> 3:04:03.800]  just sitting here saying hey why the hell are we putting up with this that's all
[3:04:03.800 --> 3:04:14.040]  and we we really have to show up as a poll it's not just we you know it seems to me like the general
[3:04:14.040 --> 3:04:18.760]  thing is like republicans go out and vote for the president but we need to vote in every single
[3:04:18.760 --> 3:04:24.760]  election because the president needs as much as our help as he can get and just voting for him
[3:04:24.760 --> 3:04:31.000]  to be reelected it's not enough he needs people all around him to help him well that's right the
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:35.240]  democrats are involved in election fraud so you've got to get like five people you know
[3:04:35.240 --> 3:04:40.440]  they've never voted to wake up to go register and to vote and and everybody's got to run for office
[3:04:40.440 --> 3:04:43.480]  whether it's city council you name it to get in the debates and get in their face
[3:04:43.480 --> 3:04:47.800]  i'm telling you they're going to take everything from everybody and bring us into total hell if
[3:04:47.800 --> 3:04:56.440]  we don't get extremely aggressive now thank you sir i spend a lot of time reminding the

[3:06:08.120 --> 3:06:12.440]  all right a few other items i want to have before mike adams takes over on the virginia subject
[3:06:12.440 --> 3:06:16.600]  and so many others here in the next segment believe me i'll be having my lunch and listening to him
[3:06:16.600 --> 3:06:20.760]  and i take a break because he's extremely informative and has good foresight on what's
[3:06:20.760 --> 3:06:26.360]  coming up i'm going to say it again i'm going to be in dc for the trump trial next week
[3:06:27.480 --> 3:06:31.320]  and i'm going to be in virginia about 35 miles away in northern virginia
[3:06:32.760 --> 3:06:38.920]  in that historic area covering the democrats and the governor declaring a civil emergency
[3:06:38.920 --> 3:06:43.640]  already and all the rest of it really trying to stop any violence being kicked off but you
[3:06:43.640 --> 3:06:48.520]  know they stage any they'll blame me that's okay people like oh you're getting attacked that's the
[3:06:48.520 --> 3:06:53.640]  whole point is if you're taking on the globalism successful they're going to attack you all these
[3:06:53.640 --> 3:06:58.520]  political movements that claim their patriot or liberty base that are afraid of any criticism
[3:06:58.520 --> 3:07:04.040]  really should just hang it up if they can't handle that if you're effective you'll be attacked
[3:07:04.760 --> 3:07:11.720]  so that other cowards don't join you and that's why trump understands when they say deny alex
[3:07:11.720 --> 3:07:16.200]  jones say he's bad trump will tweet out an info or his video or article trump gets it
[3:07:17.560 --> 3:07:23.640]  and i know our listeners get it but that is again something we have to understand they stage a
[3:07:23.640 --> 3:07:27.800]  massacre and blame it on the patriot movement you can't go i don't want to be associated with the
[3:07:27.800 --> 3:07:33.080]  patriot movement i'm hanging it up nine times out of ten is going to be a false flag don't go with
[3:07:33.080 --> 3:07:39.800]  their narratives this is a war these are known liars james in virginia you're on the air
[3:07:39.800 --> 3:07:45.400]  arm yeah god bless you sir thanks for holding what's your view on the situation
[3:07:46.120 --> 3:07:50.600]  oh yeah alex i've never gotten a chance to talk to you but listen i've been a fan and a customer
[3:07:50.600 --> 3:07:56.760]  for 20 years and uh i only recently retired from the virginia army national guard well thank you
[3:07:56.760 --> 3:08:02.040]  for your thank you for your service and your support sir you know i know you don't like fans
[3:08:02.040 --> 3:08:08.120]  making schmoozing or whatever but listen man you were the one that gave me the idea to set my
[3:08:08.120 --> 3:08:15.400]  soldiers down before i retired and have a class on the oath of enlistment and the and the constitution
[3:08:15.400 --> 3:08:21.640]  of the united states because whenever i ordered something from info or store it came with a pocket
[3:08:21.640 --> 3:08:29.480]  constitution and so i bought more by myself and i handed them out to each of my soldiers uh and and
[3:08:29.480 --> 3:08:35.720]  i made them sit there with their eyes glazed over and listen to why the constitution is so important
[3:08:35.720 --> 3:08:42.920]  uh as to each and every service member we're relating directly to the oath of enlistment
[3:08:43.480 --> 3:08:49.960]  and and and i've stayed in touch with a handful of those soldiers and um you know some of them
[3:08:49.960 --> 3:08:55.320]  didn't want to hear it you know i got laughed at for years for being the conspiracy guy with the
[3:08:55.320 --> 3:09:00.520]  info or sticker on the back of his truck and that's all fine with me i didn't care about that you know
[3:09:00.520 --> 3:09:04.840]  but uh i've stayed in touch with some of these soldiers and i could tell you within the last
[3:09:04.840 --> 3:09:11.800]  six weeks uh those questions have come down the chain of command about would you be willing to
[3:09:11.800 --> 3:09:18.760]  knock on doors and confiscate weapons and and and the answer was a resounding no from the people i know
[3:09:21.480 --> 3:09:25.400]  well sir that's beautiful and you know part of the not having extra money around here is
[3:09:25.400 --> 3:09:31.240]  we can't put those free pocket constitutions anymore because the price went up uh in the packages
[3:09:31.240 --> 3:09:36.600]  that's how lean and mean we've gotten here but we do still sell them at cost and we put bumper
[3:09:36.600 --> 3:09:41.480]  stickers in every deal there and that's but but but i know that the oath of enlistment all of that
[3:09:41.480 --> 3:09:47.160]  is absolutely key to stopping any tyranny and it's people like you doing what you did they give us
[3:09:47.160 --> 3:09:54.280]  a chance now uh to to to not have the globalist win because of the information and things you've
[3:09:54.280 --> 3:09:58.920]  done but let's go back to how amazing that is that you have the soldiers calling you saying
[3:09:58.920 --> 3:10:03.000]  they're being asked the questions about what will they do can you elaborate on that please
[3:10:04.520 --> 3:10:09.560]  yeah i can just tell you that it went down uh from the upper chain of command to the platoon
[3:10:09.560 --> 3:10:15.960]  sergeant level in at least two units that i know of and the question was very specific
[3:10:16.520 --> 3:10:22.680]  about what are your feelings and would you be willing to follow orders to go door to door and
[3:10:22.680 --> 3:10:30.120]  um and the uh the soldiers without without question said that they would not go along with that
[3:10:30.120 --> 3:10:37.720]  that and and the platoon sergeant uh said to his soldiers if we are ordered by the governor to
[3:10:37.720 --> 3:10:44.200]  report we will not leave the army armory we will set here in the armory and we will not leave
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:52.520]  and uh so i mean that was that was their answer how long ago was this this was last month well
[3:10:52.520 --> 3:10:56.840]  i remember the state legislators shot their mouths off and said we've been talking to the
[3:10:56.840 --> 3:11:01.560]  head of the of the state guard the national guard we're going to confiscate guns when we pass this
[3:11:01.560 --> 3:11:07.080]  and so the military got that call the the the national guard did so they had to ask that question
[3:11:07.080 --> 3:11:12.280]  but now what you're saying is is confirming what we saw in the news just three weeks ago
[3:11:13.240 --> 3:11:17.960]  the national guard in virginia said we will not participate in what the governor's talking about
[3:11:17.960 --> 3:11:22.920]  think about though that we've been brought to that point these leftists are that crazy but
[3:11:22.920 --> 3:11:29.000]  they're not they want to escalate things and they want to trigger some type of confrontation what
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:34.600]  do you think james i agree a hundred percent and i could tell you one thing for sure alex
[3:11:34.600 --> 3:11:39.000]  sitting here in the state of virginia right now uh not only am i looking forward to seeing you on
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:46.520]  the 20th this state is wide awake the repercussions of the actions of this filthy governor have not
[3:11:46.520 --> 3:11:53.720]  yet been felt on an election day this this state is wide awake we're not going to take it we're
[3:11:53.720 --> 3:12:02.200]  going to show up and and and we're going to seek to be peaceful but i'm i'm going to be riding on
[3:12:02.200 --> 3:12:07.960]  a bus come on i'm hoping to see you when i'm there i'll be there they originally they originally
[3:12:07.960 --> 3:12:13.960]  were only expecting about 10 buses and i'm told now they're expecting over a hundred buses
[3:12:13.960 --> 3:12:19.960]  and i'll be on one of those buses and everybody on my bus on my dime is getting a free pocket
[3:12:19.960 --> 3:12:26.280]  constitution because that is my way of spitting in the eye of the of the globals and and and
[3:12:26.280 --> 3:12:30.920]  i'll just hand them out till i run out so well james that's beautiful we're going to be bullhorning
[3:12:30.920 --> 3:12:36.280]  and interviewing people and rushing around can't wait to shake your hand god bless you thank you
[3:12:36.280 --> 3:12:42.840]  alex and uh be blessed and have a safe day you too and that's what i wanted to say in this segment
[3:12:42.840 --> 3:12:47.000]  i thought i'd be done with calls by now but that's what i wanted to say is just what he just said
[3:12:48.040 --> 3:12:53.000]  i wasn't chewing out people that are scared to be associated with info wars
[3:12:54.600 --> 3:13:00.680]  because it hurts info wars when you do that it isn't about me it's about the attitude do you think
[3:13:00.680 --> 3:13:05.560]  that that sergeant who just called in who years ago educated those men
[3:13:05.560 --> 3:13:13.080]  and felt bad or felt small when they laughed at him but he knew he was doing the right thing
[3:13:13.080 --> 3:13:20.360]  continuing an american tradition of the nco's talking to the troops about america and the
[3:13:20.360 --> 3:13:25.240]  bill of rights and constitution and if we ever got a king george here what we'd have to do to
[3:13:25.240 --> 3:13:30.360]  fight that tyrant or a governor that's a tyrant or a group of governors that are tyrants that's
[3:13:30.360 --> 3:13:36.360]  going on from the start of this country and sure the young men had watched mainstream media they
[3:13:36.360 --> 3:13:41.080]  heard you're supposed to laugh at that you ever hear about this stuff about tyrants and world
[3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:44.680]  government and gun confiscation remember obama's speeches we ought to find them where he said
[3:13:45.720 --> 3:13:50.600]  don't listen to people that talk about coming tyranny and gun confiscation in a new world order
[3:13:50.600 --> 3:13:56.200]  that's all lies that doesn't exist but now their stealth mode didn't work so now they're out in the
[3:13:56.200 --> 3:14:01.640]  open we're coming for your guns we're coming for your kids world government we're gonna put you
[3:14:01.640 --> 3:14:07.880]  at a fema camp a reeducation camp if you don't do what we want see now they're out in the open
[3:14:07.880 --> 3:14:11.560]  because they know they're losing but they hope the fight they start with us they can somehow
[3:14:11.560 --> 3:14:16.360]  organize it with the media and convince those of us that stand up for ourselves convince people
[3:14:16.360 --> 3:14:22.120]  that we're the bad guys that's not gonna work so it's about doing the right thing even though at
[3:14:22.120 --> 3:14:27.960]  the time people that are ignorant laugh at you because you know later they're not going to be
[3:14:27.960 --> 3:14:33.880]  laughing and then later it's not about oh you were right thank you you're great you think that last
[3:14:33.880 --> 3:14:39.480]  caller thinks he's a perfect person or it's about him he was doing his duty as an american
[3:14:40.120 --> 3:14:45.240]  because he knew he was right he's been proven right we've been proven right but it's not about
[3:14:45.240 --> 3:14:50.120]  that now it's about the fact that everything we've talked about is now staring us dead in the eyes
[3:14:50.120 --> 3:14:55.400]  and it thought when it made its move it would have assurance of victory now it's got bad footing
[3:14:55.400 --> 3:15:01.640]  it's bleeding to death and we've got a really good shot at winning but don't you think that
[3:15:01.640 --> 3:15:07.960]  that enemy we've got cornered may be holding its guts in and bleeding down both legs but that
[3:15:08.840 --> 3:15:15.640]  demon is still dangerous and so if we don't expect really bad things to happen we're going
[3:15:15.640 --> 3:15:20.600]  to be hit flat-footed the globalists were airing and they got hit flat-footed now they're hitting
[3:15:20.600 --> 3:15:27.000]  us hard they know they're in trouble and now we got to finish the job cut off the fentanyl flooding
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:31.560]  in cut off all the pedophile and devil worship get god back in our lives and this country and the
[3:15:31.560 --> 3:15:35.800]  world will turn around just like that i know the churches are all bought off until you it's the

[3:18:52.520 --> 3:19:00.360]  it's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know everybody
[3:19:00.360 --> 3:19:07.320]  is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine
[3:19:07.320 --> 3:19:13.960]  right before they get it and they get the worst case of the flu of their life but still
[3:19:14.760 --> 3:19:21.160]  by concentration camp victims they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the
[3:19:21.160 --> 3:19:26.760]  injections it doesn't matter that studies mainline government studies in canada and europe show that
[3:19:26.760 --> 3:19:32.040]  when you take the flu vaccine it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by
[3:19:32.040 --> 3:19:37.880]  lowering your immunity it goes on and on or the fact that the governments have never guessed the
[3:19:37.880 --> 3:19:45.240]  next year's mutation at the flu vaccine has never ever even worked but how do you problem of hoax
[3:19:45.240 --> 3:19:50.920]  you keep the giant hoax going no wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening
[3:19:50.920 --> 3:19:58.440]  right now you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:09.000 --> 3:20:16.440]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance it's
[3:20:16.440 --> 3:20:25.240]  mike adams you're listening to the alex jones show on the alex jones show thanks for joining me
[3:20:25.800 --> 3:20:31.560]  mike adams here with more analysis of what's happening in virginia as well as a story that
[3:20:31.560 --> 3:20:36.760]  that i just posted i didn't even have a chance to tell the producers there at info wars it's got a
[3:20:36.760 --> 3:20:42.360]  near complete transcript of this left-wing lunatic captured by project veritas action
[3:20:42.360 --> 3:20:50.600]  and a new analysis here it's shocking this left-wing communist lunatic who wants to carry out
[3:20:50.600 --> 3:20:57.560]  mass executions of both conservatives and sort of centrist liberals anyone who's not radical
[3:20:57.560 --> 3:21:02.920]  left-wing communism he says they should be killed and essentially you know thrown in a ditch that's
[3:21:02.920 --> 3:21:09.720]  that's essentially what he's calling for excuse me the new transcript that's out shows that this guy
[3:21:09.720 --> 3:21:18.840]  is an eco fascist who sounds exactly like ocasio-cortez he sounds like aoc he uses words like she
[3:21:18.840 --> 3:21:24.920]  uses he keeps saying like like this like you know um from the transcript from the video today he
[3:21:24.920 --> 3:21:30.520]  says quote like we're here to preserve the planet to preserve people he said this is part of his
[3:21:30.520 --> 3:21:35.720]  strategy for mass killing quote we don't want to f-ing have to like eliminate people right
[3:21:35.720 --> 3:21:41.240]  this sounds just like aoc but if people are going to try to fight back against the revolution he says
[3:21:41.240 --> 3:21:47.880]  like when you hear about like so like atrocities committed by like in cuba by like fidel and
[3:21:47.880 --> 3:21:54.200]  che like killing people like those people who were actively like they were like anti-revolution
[3:21:54.200 --> 3:21:59.400]  doesn't this sound just like aoc they were fighting against the revolution and if you guys were in a
[3:21:59.400 --> 3:22:04.040]  war and you encounter people that were fighting against you what did you do to those people right
[3:22:04.040 --> 3:22:09.080]  the same holds true in a revolution he says the same holds true he goes on to talk about
[3:22:10.120 --> 3:22:15.960]  how they the radical left-wing communists that they are going to save the planet
[3:22:15.960 --> 3:22:21.880]  and they are going to save humanity but in order to achieve that they have to carry out mass killings
[3:22:21.880 --> 3:22:29.480]  and run gulags for the survivors he says quote that he's quote all aboard for gulags like i feel
[3:22:29.480 --> 3:22:36.040]  there needs to be reeducation for a significant portion of our society he says and he goes on
[3:22:36.040 --> 3:22:43.640]  and on like this it sounds again exactly like a radical left-wing eco fascist or an eco terrorist
[3:22:43.640 --> 3:22:48.760]  some elements of this sound to me like gretta thunberg and it sounds like aoc and it sounds
[3:22:48.760 --> 3:22:54.760]  like others who are these radicals on the left who now justify this mass violence against humanity
[3:22:54.760 --> 3:23:00.280]  by saying that they are the ones who are going to kill the enemies of the planet they are going
[3:23:00.280 --> 3:23:04.840]  to save the earth and they are going to save humanity now think about this rationally for a
[3:23:04.840 --> 3:23:13.240]  second folks what authoritarian communist nation in the history of the world has ever been good
[3:23:13.240 --> 3:23:19.560]  for the planet or good for humanity i mean look at communist china one of the most polluted countries
[3:23:19.560 --> 3:23:25.240]  in the world so polluted that a lot of their exports are contaminated with heavy metals
[3:23:25.880 --> 3:23:30.840]  it's it's horrible the rivers you can't even bathe in the rivers without practically committing
[3:23:30.840 --> 3:23:37.480]  suicide from toxic exposure and pollution communism does not equal taking care of the
[3:23:37.480 --> 3:23:43.880]  environment communist destroy the environment and they destroy humanity look at the history of genocide
[3:23:43.880 --> 3:23:50.440]  of democide against humanity carried out by communist regimes from joseph stalin and the
[3:23:50.440 --> 3:23:55.400]  stalin revolution to chairman mao and the communist revolution and the cultural revolution and
[3:23:55.400 --> 3:24:01.320]  in modern day venezuela or even north korea which maybe is not strictly communism but it certainly
[3:24:01.320 --> 3:24:08.920]  is the type of authoritarianism that communists like to put into place these philosophies of
[3:24:08.920 --> 3:24:16.120]  communism of radical left-wing ideology that are anti free market that are anti individual liberty
[3:24:16.120 --> 3:24:22.200]  that are anti freedom anti constitution anti second amendment anti free speech these philosophies
[3:24:22.200 --> 3:24:28.440]  lead to the destruction of human societies there is no other outcome that you can achieve
[3:24:29.080 --> 3:24:35.480]  even when you take a country like venezuela i had unlimited wealth under the ground it's like
[3:24:35.480 --> 3:24:40.360]  pots of gold under the ground all they had to do was drill into the earth and and get the oil and
[3:24:40.360 --> 3:24:46.840]  sell the oil and they could practically build a utopia and yet because communism is so bad
[3:24:46.840 --> 3:24:52.520]  radical left-wing socialism slash communism it's it's such a horrible philosophy they managed to
[3:24:52.520 --> 3:24:58.600]  destroy that nation to the point where people who have phd's and master's degrees and advanced
[3:24:58.600 --> 3:25:03.720]  university education are dumpster diving for food and those are the ones who haven't yet
[3:25:03.720 --> 3:25:11.240]  fled venezuela to other countries communism or communism communist ideologies have destroyed
[3:25:11.240 --> 3:25:18.440]  a nation that was one of the leading rising examples of first world abundance and first
[3:25:18.440 --> 3:25:24.280]  world education and civil society venezuela was on the on the rise toward that goal and now they
[3:25:24.280 --> 3:25:30.200]  have been utterly destroyed the economy destroyed liberties destroyed gun rights destroyed and that
[3:25:30.200 --> 3:25:34.280]  was one of the first mistakes they made by the way was giving up their guns and this is why and
[3:25:34.280 --> 3:25:39.560]  i'm going to talk about virginia today here this is why the people of virginia god bless you you're
[3:25:39.560 --> 3:25:45.960]  doing exactly the right thing do not give up your guns ever under any circumstances any order to
[3:25:45.960 --> 3:25:52.120]  confiscate your guns is an illegal order any conspiracy to take away your guns and to steal
[3:25:52.120 --> 3:25:59.720]  them frankly is a conspiracy to commit felony crimes of mass theft and the fact that the government
[3:25:59.720 --> 3:26:06.200]  itself is committing those conspiracy crimes and felony theft crimes that doesn't nullify the crimes
[3:26:06.200 --> 3:26:11.640]  they are still the criminals governor northam is a criminal and we'll get to that more in the next
[3:26:11.640 --> 3:26:16.120]  segment but we still have a few minutes left here let me read you some more of what this insane
[3:26:16.120 --> 3:26:21.960]  bernie sanders supporter well i don't know if you can call him insane this is there's a lot of people
[3:26:21.960 --> 3:26:26.280]  like this he talks about how they work with antifa and how they work with dsa the democratic
[3:26:26.280 --> 3:26:31.560]  socialists of america and they work for bernie sanders this individual who i've been quoting
[3:26:31.560 --> 3:26:37.080]  is on the bernie sanders campaign payroll and you gotta you gotta thank project veritas and james
[3:26:37.080 --> 3:26:44.760]  o kief truly one of the most amazing journalists of our time in fact in my mind right now james
[3:26:44.760 --> 3:26:50.520]  o kief and oa shroyer and many other people on the info wars crew like katlyn bennett and so on
[3:26:50.520 --> 3:26:55.560]  these are the real journalists of our time they deserve national recognition for their efforts
[3:26:55.560 --> 3:27:00.280]  it's amazing what they are doing i mean the courage of oa shroyer and what he's been doing it
[3:27:00.280 --> 3:27:04.840]  it is sometimes it's the highlight of my day watching oan what he's doing out there in the
[3:27:04.840 --> 3:27:10.680]  field and i know alex feels the same way he's got to be proud of info wars dot com and the info
[3:27:10.680 --> 3:27:16.840]  wars reporters what they are doing this is real journalism this puts the washington post to shame
[3:27:16.840 --> 3:27:22.680]  this makes a joke of the new york times the real journalism is happening in operations like project
[3:27:22.680 --> 3:27:27.720]  veritas and info wars dot com and a few other independent media outlets it's it's amazing
[3:27:27.720 --> 3:27:32.760]  and that's why your support is absolutely important and i think alex mentioned earlier i was watching

[3:28:10.360 --> 3:28:15.960]  and i've said this before and now people are waking up and realizing it they want to kill you
[3:28:15.960 --> 3:28:20.520]  they are planning to kill you they want bernie sanders to win the white house and then they
[3:28:20.520 --> 3:28:28.600]  are going to launch a massive killing mass executions of all trump supporters if they can get away
[3:28:28.600 --> 3:28:36.920]  with it now i think they will fail i think they will fail for i don't know 556 reasons 5.56 or
[3:28:36.920 --> 3:28:45.640]  maybe 308 reasons or maybe 338 reasons 338 lapua magnum they're gonna fail because americas will

[3:30:01.720 --> 3:30:08.120]  seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort
[3:30:08.120 --> 3:30:14.520]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain
[3:30:14.520 --> 3:30:20.440]  quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[3:30:20.440 --> 3:30:26.440]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast acting
[3:30:26.440 --> 3:30:32.040]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and
[3:30:32.040 --> 3:30:37.480]  effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts
[3:30:37.480 --> 3:30:42.920]  by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[3:30:42.920 --> 3:30:49.160]  responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to info wars life.com

[3:31:07.000 --> 3:31:13.560]  and president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing
[3:31:13.560 --> 3:31:19.080]  as well you're still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some
[3:31:19.080 --> 3:31:23.640]  other areas but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china
[3:31:23.640 --> 3:31:30.040]  trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're
[3:31:30.040 --> 3:31:36.680]  being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against
[3:31:36.680 --> 3:31:41.240]  humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical
[3:31:41.240 --> 3:31:47.000]  to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to

[3:33:07.400 --> 3:33:20.120]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with mike adams
[3:33:22.760 --> 3:33:29.480]  we're going to cover virginia in this segment and excuse me as you're aware virginia is looking
[3:33:29.480 --> 3:33:36.600]  like the epicenter of the next civil war in america the most likely scenario and alex earlier today
[3:33:36.600 --> 3:33:43.800]  was spot on with his analysis of the scenario they're going to stage a false flag attack
[3:33:44.520 --> 3:33:49.400]  on virginia law enforcement personnel or an attempted attack on perhaps the governor or
[3:33:49.400 --> 3:33:55.320]  lawmakers in virginia they're going to blame it on gun owners so that they can designate gun owners
[3:33:55.320 --> 3:34:01.160]  to be terrorists when that happens then the governor is going to expand the emergency order that he
[3:34:01.160 --> 3:34:07.560]  already gave which prohibits firearms on the capital grounds of state capital their enrichment
[3:34:07.560 --> 3:34:12.520]  and he's going to expand that to the entire state and he's going to run the road locks the road
[3:34:12.520 --> 3:34:18.600]  checkpoints that we reported on weeks ago it was only us in the independent media we had sources
[3:34:18.600 --> 3:34:24.520]  that leaked to us that this plan was being discussed by governor northam in virginia who
[3:34:24.520 --> 3:34:30.520]  is a criminal trader to america a baby killer and a racist by the way if you if you want to know who
[3:34:30.520 --> 3:34:37.400]  that guy really is uh he's he's he's a horrible human being and i'm not even sure about that he's
[3:34:37.400 --> 3:34:43.640]  all human he is a horrible entity we'll say it that way uh he kind of looks almost human but
[3:34:44.440 --> 3:34:48.840]  maybe a little more human than hillary clinton at the moment but he i don't think he's all human
[3:34:49.560 --> 3:34:54.040]  in other words he's like a he's an evil demonic entity or at least that's kind of influence that
[3:34:54.040 --> 3:34:58.760]  he's got or he's lost his mind something like that he's like a psychopath who managed to get
[3:34:58.760 --> 3:35:03.640]  into the office of the governorship and as part of his psychopathy he has been planning and and
[3:35:03.640 --> 3:35:10.360]  conspiring to pull off this massive false flag against gun owners in virginia so the way this
[3:35:10.360 --> 3:35:16.760]  is going to shape up possibly on january 20th which is called lobby day they're going to be
[3:35:16.760 --> 3:35:20.840]  according to a caller earlier going to be over a hundred buses of gun supporters
[3:35:20.840 --> 3:35:28.200]  coming in to peacefully and lawfully protest against the gun confiscation orders of or gun
[3:35:28.200 --> 3:35:33.000]  confiscation laws that are trying to be put forth by the democrat lawmakers in that state
[3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:39.720]  that is a ripe opportunity and alex himself understands this and and has explained it it's
[3:35:39.720 --> 3:35:46.920]  a ripe opportunity for the radical left to stage violence and what they're doing specifically
[3:35:46.920 --> 3:35:51.720]  is they're putting state troopers and law enforcement officers out there on the front
[3:35:51.720 --> 3:35:58.920]  lines to act as bait and they know that if if they can kill and again this is their plan not
[3:35:58.920 --> 3:36:04.680]  the gun owners this is the radical left and their operatives and their covert black ops people if
[3:36:04.680 --> 3:36:11.000]  they know if they can kill some state troopers and kill some police officers or kill anyone in
[3:36:11.000 --> 3:36:17.640]  law enforcement who is pro-northam you know pro-democrat then the media it'll be nationwide news
[3:36:17.640 --> 3:36:22.280]  and they'll say all gun owners are terrorists end of story now remember that when a radical
[3:36:22.280 --> 3:36:29.400]  muslim hijacks a van or steals a van and runs over people it's never the fault of all muslims of
[3:36:29.400 --> 3:36:34.200]  course in fact we're reminded by the news that you oh you can't condemn all muslims in fact it
[3:36:34.200 --> 3:36:38.920]  wasn't even a muslim it the van did it it was the van that ran over people and you'll see headlines
[3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:45.240]  in the media van attacks pedestrians or van runs over people like there was no driver
[3:36:45.240 --> 3:36:51.640]  or there's a magical spirit van or something that has its own mind like a like a steven king
[3:36:51.640 --> 3:36:57.000]  novel or something this van started up and just ran over people you're never allowed to blame muslims
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:37:03.720]  but if they can convince you that one gun owner or one trump supporter or one info wars fan with
[3:37:03.720 --> 3:37:10.280]  a bumper sticker open fire in some way even in self-defense then they can paint all gun
[3:37:10.280 --> 3:37:15.880]  gun owners as terrorists and that is exactly what they are going to do this is their plan even if
[3:37:15.880 --> 3:37:20.680]  they have to stage it fake it doesn't matter they've done that before they're going to do it again
[3:37:20.680 --> 3:37:27.720]  the idea is to cause escalation and so for this reason alone i need to urge everybody watching
[3:37:27.720 --> 3:37:34.200]  here yes it's your right to keep and bear arms it's a second amendment right at the same time
[3:37:34.200 --> 3:37:41.560]  we all need to be on the watch here very carefully watch out for provocations that try to sweep you
[3:37:41.560 --> 3:37:47.160]  into being caught on camera they will stage cnn cameras all around this false flag event
[3:37:47.160 --> 3:37:51.240]  and then they will initiate something to try to get gun owners to pull out their guns and shoot
[3:37:51.240 --> 3:37:56.040]  back in self-defense and then cnn will edit the video to make it look like you were the aggressor
[3:37:56.680 --> 3:38:02.040]  if you pull a gun and you fire a gun especially if it's an ar-15 if it's a rifle oh especially a
[3:38:02.040 --> 3:38:08.200]  homemade rifle or a 3d printed rifle have no illusions cnn is going to catch you on camera
[3:38:09.080 --> 3:38:12.680]  they're going to edit it they're going to lie they're going to distort the whole story
[3:38:12.680 --> 3:38:17.080]  and for all we know they may throw a bunch of dead bodies that dump them out of the back of a van
[3:38:17.080 --> 3:38:21.880]  that they have staged so to make it look like more people died than actually did this is the kind
[3:38:21.880 --> 3:38:26.360]  of thing they do from time to time they will stage everything they'll stage the whole scene
[3:38:26.360 --> 3:38:31.800]  they'll edit it they will lie they are deceivers as alex says they're at war with america there's
[3:38:31.800 --> 3:38:37.480]  nothing they won't do there is no rule of journalism that they follow anymore that they don't have any
[3:38:37.480 --> 3:38:41.720]  standards they don't have any ethics they don't have any morals if they have to go out literally if
[3:38:41.720 --> 3:38:48.280]  they have to go out and themselves murder 30 children in an elementary school and put them in
[3:38:48.280 --> 3:38:53.160]  a van dump them on the scene so they can have a picture of a second amendment supporter opening
[3:38:53.160 --> 3:38:57.480]  fire and then they can piece all that together and say oh my god these gun nuts they killed a
[3:38:57.480 --> 3:39:04.360]  bunch of kids they will do that have no illusions they will do that they've done it it's not the
[3:39:04.360 --> 3:39:08.680]  first time that false flags have been used in war throughout world history just so you know
[3:39:09.400 --> 3:39:14.600]  so you need to be vigilant here you need to practice discipline i've said this before about
[3:39:14.600 --> 3:39:22.440]  the coming civil war whoever opens fire first loses whoever shoots first loses hope you understand
[3:39:22.440 --> 3:39:29.960]  that hold your fire until the last possible moment but if they're coming for you if they the enemies
[3:39:29.960 --> 3:39:37.640]  of america the traders if they are committing acts of violence against you or attempting to at some
[3:39:37.640 --> 3:39:44.120]  point i understand i understand we have no choice but to act in self-defense but make sure that is
[3:39:44.120 --> 3:39:49.720]  the very last option because they are setting you up mark my words this is coming a major
[3:39:49.720 --> 3:39:58.520]  false flag event is coming now roadblocks roadside checkpoints this is again a bait operation they're
[3:39:58.520 --> 3:40:02.760]  putting state troopers out there law enforcement out there hoping that they get shot and they're
[3:40:02.760 --> 3:40:06.600]  going to have you know special cameras added to the police vehicles probably to make sure that
[3:40:06.600 --> 3:40:13.240]  they can for sure capture somebody you know shooting a police officer that's the goal so if you are a
[3:40:13.240 --> 3:40:18.200]  state trooper or you're a police officer in virginia understand you are being put out there
[3:40:18.200 --> 3:40:24.360]  as a sacrificial lamb of sorts you are being thrust out there with the hopes the democrats
[3:40:24.360 --> 3:40:29.080]  hope that you are shot and killed because they want the narrative that follows and that's why
[3:40:29.080 --> 3:40:35.000]  we all all have to be extremely vigilant right now about all of this bottom line here's the good
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:42.440]  news the democrats cannot win unless you choose to surrender they cannot win if you refuse to turn
[3:40:42.440 --> 3:40:49.080]  over your guns if you continue to gather peacefully and lawfully and make your voice heard and make
[3:40:49.080 --> 3:40:56.680]  your numbers visible and you abide by the law and you demand the rule of law and yet you are willing
[3:40:56.680 --> 3:41:02.680]  to hold on to your guns at any cost ultimately probably even willing to put your life on the
[3:41:02.680 --> 3:41:07.960]  line to defend your second amendment rights then they the democrats cannot win they cannot defeat
[3:41:07.960 --> 3:41:14.680]  that they can only win if they can convince you to surrender your guns and that my friends that's
[3:41:14.680 --> 3:41:20.520]  the whole point of the second amendment false flag operation they want a false flag so they can
[3:41:20.520 --> 3:41:25.480]  convince the gun owners of virginia that oh i must be a bad person if i own a gun i'm going to turn
[3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:30.520]  them in just like they convinced a lot of people in new zealand or australia many years ago they
[3:41:30.520 --> 3:41:36.680]  have to convince you to surrender your guns that's the only way they can win once they do that then
[3:41:36.680 --> 3:41:41.640]  they know they can carry out the mass killings that are being described by this person caught on video
[3:41:41.640 --> 3:41:47.480]  by project veritas mass murder is the goal it's just like the third rike it's just like not to
[3:41:47.480 --> 3:41:53.000]  germany first they convince the jews to give up their guns and then they can carry out the mass
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:58.520]  roundups and here get on the railroad cars we have a food camp for you you're going to be taken care
[3:41:58.520 --> 3:42:03.640]  of don't worry you're going to have showers everything's good and you get on the railroad car
[3:42:03.640 --> 3:42:08.120]  because you gave up your guns because you want to be a good citizen and guess what they drop you off
[3:42:08.120 --> 3:42:16.280]  in a giant oven or a giant zyclon b shower chamber guess what it's not clean water it's toxic deadly
[3:42:16.280 --> 3:42:23.720]  gas created by a pharmaceutical company by the way i g farben so there you go don't be fooled never
[3:42:23.720 --> 3:42:29.240]  give up your guns not under any circumstances anyone who demands that you give up your guns is a
[3:42:29.240 --> 3:42:35.960]  criminal traitor to this nation and should be in my opinion arrested prosecuted and tried under the
[3:42:35.960 --> 3:42:42.280]  rule of law not not just by vigilante citizens but under the rule of law they should be prosecuted
[3:42:42.280 --> 3:42:47.880]  and tried for crimes against america you can achieve victory if you refuse to surrender
[3:42:47.880 --> 3:42:56.440]  much more straight ahead we'll be uh back here on wars hey you there we have a problem you see
[3:42:56.440 --> 3:43:03.640]  there is a baby the mother of this baby is not sure she's ready the father of this baby

[3:48:02.520 --> 3:48:08.120]  wars and alex jones but we have a lot of other users coming on there i do know that some prominent
[3:48:08.120 --> 3:48:13.880]  nonprofit groups are also going to be using that live streaming functionality also i haven't yet been
[3:48:13.880 --> 3:48:18.760]  able to verify this but i've heard a rumor i'm not going to name the name but i've heard that
[3:48:18.760 --> 3:48:24.120]  some other independent video platforms out there are now starting to ban vaccine videos
[3:48:24.120 --> 3:48:28.280]  i'm not sure that's true we're trying to check it out but i just want you to know
[3:48:28.280 --> 3:48:32.840]  that vaccine truth videos are always welcome on bright yon dot com and i know also band
[3:48:32.840 --> 3:48:36.840]  dot video covers that as well at info wars dot com they cover that you know especially over the
[3:48:36.840 --> 3:48:41.800]  last few days you've seen all these videos come out world health organization scientists caught
[3:48:41.800 --> 3:48:48.120]  lying it's incredible like this this one md a chief scientist of the who i can't even pronounce
[3:48:48.120 --> 3:48:52.280]  her last name she's she's an indian woman her name's too complicated to remember i'm sorry
[3:48:52.280 --> 3:48:58.440]  but she she she had put out a propaganda video with the who at the end of november last year
[3:48:58.440 --> 3:49:03.720]  and in the propaganda video she says oh vaccines are risk-free we can treat disease without risk
[3:49:03.720 --> 3:49:07.800]  the safety systems are awesome i mean i'm paraphrasing but this is what she says basically
[3:49:07.800 --> 3:49:12.200]  that everything's great vaccines are the best thing in the world for for solving disease and
[3:49:12.200 --> 3:49:18.600]  then you cut to the actual leaked video from the world health organization and i think del big
[3:49:18.600 --> 3:49:22.920]  trees organization hi wire helped get this video at least that's my understanding but the video
[3:49:22.920 --> 3:49:27.960]  leaked info wars covered it a couple days ago we've covered it in natural news as well in this leaked
[3:49:27.960 --> 3:49:34.520]  video she says oh my god the safety systems don't work it's long-term like adverse effects for vaccines
[3:49:34.520 --> 3:49:39.640]  we're not communicating clearly we don't have a safety net it's just it's and that's only five days
[3:49:39.640 --> 3:49:47.960]  later so this woman she blatantly lies she lies about vaccine safety and she is just like all
[3:49:47.960 --> 3:49:54.520]  these other experts at the who the united nations and so on the cdc the fda not only are they lying
[3:49:54.520 --> 3:49:59.400]  to you but i mean they deliberately are like they know that they are lying to you they they
[3:49:59.400 --> 3:50:05.880]  conspire in their own minds to misinform the public about vaccines and it's only the independent
[3:50:05.880 --> 3:50:11.640]  media that is covering this like info wars or natural news or what have you um and i have a
[3:50:11.640 --> 3:50:17.560]  question by the way will the tech giants now unban all our channels now that we have been
[3:50:17.560 --> 3:50:23.640]  proven correct by the testimony of world health organization scientists right since we were banned
[3:50:23.640 --> 3:50:29.560]  for questioning the safety of vaccines well now gosh these who scientists are are admitting that
[3:50:29.560 --> 3:50:33.800]  vaccines aren't safe they don't have safety tracking systems one scientist was on there saying
[3:50:33.800 --> 3:50:38.600]  we don't even have barcodes on the vaccines we can't even track if there's one bad lot we can't
[3:50:38.600 --> 3:50:43.960]  even track who that went to we have no clue that they're admitting all this so can can we have our
[3:50:43.960 --> 3:50:49.640]  channels turned back on now i'm wondering since we were proven right is there an apology to alex
[3:50:49.640 --> 3:50:55.400]  jones who has been right about vaccines for years apology to myself or or del big tree or robert f
[3:50:55.400 --> 3:51:00.360]  kennedy jr or any of the other activists and not just activists but journalists and investigators
[3:51:00.360 --> 3:51:05.080]  and analysts out there who have been right about this issue time and time again where's the apology
[3:51:05.080 --> 3:51:10.920]  oh it's nowhere to be seen or heard from and the mainstream media isn't covering these lies
[3:51:10.920 --> 3:51:16.840]  by the who scientists imagine that so there's still a blackout on this news wow what who could
[3:51:16.840 --> 3:51:20.920]  have ever imagined that that would happen oh no what a coincidence they they just happened to black
[3:51:20.920 --> 3:51:26.120]  out when when the scientists get caught lying about vaccines all right let's move on to preparedness
[3:51:26.120 --> 3:51:32.040]  here for a second there is some crazy stuff coming to america you're probably already aware of that
[3:51:32.040 --> 3:51:36.680]  i'm getting some other pieces of information not yet confirmed that i can't talk about of crazy
[3:51:36.680 --> 3:51:42.600]  stuff maybe happening in the midwest soon we have volcanoes exploding in the philippines as you know
[3:51:42.600 --> 3:51:49.400]  we have the the whole ring of fire the san andreas fault we've got a ground penetrating radar
[3:51:49.400 --> 3:51:55.640]  planes flying over like patterns over parts of eastern or southeastern california for example
[3:51:55.640 --> 3:52:01.560]  a lot of crazy things happening not just the senate trial for trump's you know impeachment
[3:52:01.560 --> 3:52:07.080]  vindication not just the civil war situation in virginia not just the fact that reportedly
[3:52:08.680 --> 3:52:14.360]  the the vast majority of of the the government like the top government lawmakers in russia
[3:52:14.360 --> 3:52:19.800]  just resigned under putin i'm not even fully aware of all the details of that yet but look things
[3:52:19.800 --> 3:52:28.920]  are happening that are pointing to a massively chaotic this is going to be the year that you
[3:52:28.920 --> 3:52:34.120]  will wish you had your prepper supplies together and i was recently talking to a person i know in
[3:52:34.120 --> 3:52:40.120]  the philippines who lives just 30 miles from this volcano and and i said well you know the
[3:52:40.120 --> 3:52:44.200]  volcano is going off and there's there's a big alert now that it's going to blow it's going to be
[3:52:44.200 --> 3:52:50.360]  some severe situation lava flows into the city you know into manila possibly it's part of the
[3:52:50.360 --> 3:52:55.480]  warning i said well good thing you have a water filter there right because because you know contaminated
[3:52:55.480 --> 3:53:00.200]  water is the biggest problem when when infrastructure fails and you have dirty water and people get
[3:53:00.200 --> 3:53:04.120]  sick and then they have diarrhea and they die because there are no medical services and it says
[3:53:04.120 --> 3:53:10.680]  oh well i actually don't have a water filter i said are you kidding me you live near a volcano
[3:53:11.640 --> 3:53:18.840]  in manila in a country that is known for losing the power grid by the way in a country that the
[3:53:18.840 --> 3:53:25.080]  roads are so jammed you can't even move out of the city on a good day in less than three hours
[3:53:25.080 --> 3:53:30.920]  imagine an evacuation order in manila you're going to go nowhere there's no such thing as
[3:53:30.920 --> 3:53:36.840]  evacuating manila but the same thing or much the same thing is true in major u.s cities like
[3:53:36.840 --> 3:53:43.640]  los angeles how can you evacuate la how do you evacuate even chicago or houston or miami because
[3:53:43.640 --> 3:53:49.560]  you can't go east from miami you know and in la you can't go west you got ocean to the west and
[3:53:49.560 --> 3:53:55.800]  desert to the east where do you go people are not prepared even when they live in danger zones
[3:53:56.600 --> 3:54:02.040]  and it's mind-blowing to me that here you are you're on a planet that is always shifting and
[3:54:02.040 --> 3:54:07.560]  moving you're in a geopolitical situation that is changing every single day the risk of world war
[3:54:07.560 --> 3:54:12.920]  three is very real the risk of civil war domestically is very real the risk of north korea launching
[3:54:12.920 --> 3:54:19.640]  a nuke or an emp weapon is very real nasa says the risk of a solar flare happening is about 12
[3:54:19.640 --> 3:54:24.360]  percent every decade that's a very real risk and that would shut down a lot of electronics and
[3:54:24.360 --> 3:54:29.160]  and crater the power grid you got these radical left-wing socialists that want to engage in a mass
[3:54:29.160 --> 3:54:35.800]  killing revolution to overthrow the whole country how could you not own you know a water filter
[3:54:35.800 --> 3:54:42.760]  an emergency backup radio emergency first aid iodine supplies an ar-15 a pistol you know
[3:54:42.760 --> 3:54:47.240]  five thousand rounds of ammo and just on and on and on how could you not own these things
[3:54:47.240 --> 3:54:52.920]  given that you are living on a planet that is about to suffer mass chaos and i know that most
[3:54:52.920 --> 3:54:58.040]  of you watching or listening well you have these supplies because you've been prepared for a long
[3:54:58.040 --> 3:55:03.640]  time but you are living in a society where most other people do not have these supplies they don't
[3:55:03.640 --> 3:55:10.280]  have food they don't have you know dental floss which can be used for a lot of things or duct tape
[3:55:10.280 --> 3:55:16.120]  or aluminum foil or just vaseline by the way you can you can put it into cotton balls and it's
[3:55:16.120 --> 3:55:21.080]  used as fire starters to start fires when the wood is wet out here for a moment yeah i've been
[3:55:21.080 --> 3:55:25.000]  i've been watching you the last 40 minutes or so and you're just completely dead on just in closing
[3:55:26.040 --> 3:55:30.600]  you're you're pointing out that humans have become domesticated during the great depression 90
[3:55:30.600 --> 3:55:35.080]  percent of us were rural about half of them are completely self-sufficient now we're 90 percent urban
[3:55:35.080 --> 3:55:39.400]  and only about half of the 10 percent that are rural are totally self-sufficient so if we have a
[3:55:39.400 --> 3:55:46.360]  collapse that happens every 50 to 100 years it will be next level and that's why trump and others
[3:55:46.360 --> 3:55:51.000]  are trying to stabilize things well the globalists are trying to destabilize things why this is such
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:56.520]  a serious time earlier today i had multiple current members of the virginia state police
[3:55:57.400 --> 3:56:02.360]  sergeant that had just retired in the virginia national guard who had his former folks calling
[3:56:02.360 --> 3:56:08.200]  saying yeah they gave us the gun confiscation questionnaire and then others called and confirmed
[3:56:08.200 --> 3:56:11.640]  that and then it was in the news that they asked him and they said they wouldn't be part of it three
[3:56:11.640 --> 3:56:16.440]  weeks ago so everything that your sources told you a month ago has now been confirmed mike
[3:56:16.440 --> 3:56:20.120]  and so we're gonna have those clips out on info wars dot com as well but this is just
[3:56:20.120 --> 3:56:24.840]  massive that the democrats are trying to do a gun confiscation and the military saying no that was
[3:56:24.840 --> 3:56:29.080]  in the news but now we're getting from on the ground what happened where the military said
[3:56:29.080 --> 3:56:34.040]  unanimously in the national guard we're not going to follow those orders we're going to stay in barracks
[3:56:34.040 --> 3:56:39.000]  so this is this is huge they're making their move in the country right now folks and and and trump
[3:56:39.000 --> 3:56:42.040]  you know not having the justice department take these folks out when they're criminals
[3:56:42.040 --> 3:56:47.560]  is only encouraging their next move against all of us and yet we we tend to live in a society
[3:56:47.560 --> 3:56:51.240]  where the people around us are completely unprepared so they will panic psychologically
[3:56:51.240 --> 3:56:57.160]  because they they didn't see what's coming the way your audience has alex you know your audience
[3:56:57.160 --> 3:57:01.800]  has the benefit of knowing all of this in advance yes this audience is the brain trust
