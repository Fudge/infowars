[00:00.000 --> 00:16.320]  We take an oath for the Constitution.
[00:16.320 --> 00:21.560]  Washington Post team Woodward and Costa's allegations regarding General Milley revealed
[00:21.560 --> 00:27.320]  the violation of several uniformed codes of military law, a court martial would appear
[00:27.320 --> 00:28.480]  to be imminent.
[00:28.480 --> 00:36.040]  In retrospect, treason and betrayal were hovering around every corner of the Trump administration.
[00:36.040 --> 00:41.520]  General Milley, Trump's Joint Chief of Staff's contact with his Chinese counterpart assuring
[00:41.520 --> 00:47.200]  him of a warning of attack and organizing a mutiny in lieu of a nuclear war actually
[00:47.200 --> 00:51.120]  gave China a window of opportunity if they had acted on it.
[00:51.120 --> 00:54.800]  Our national security was in extreme danger.
[00:54.800 --> 00:59.880]  General Mark Milley had shown his sycophantic toe licking of the left and exposed just how
[00:59.880 --> 01:06.000]  political the career top brass of the military are expected to be as they ignore the U.S.
[01:06.000 --> 01:07.000]  Constitution.
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.160]  And violent extremism remains a generational trans-regional struggle requiring sustained
[01:13.160 --> 01:15.920]  political, fiscal and military solutions.
[01:15.920 --> 01:20.800]  I am outraged by the senseless and brutal killing of George Floyd.
[01:20.800 --> 01:27.560]  What we are seeing is the long shadow of our original sin in Jamestown 401 years ago, liberated
[01:27.560 --> 01:33.960]  by the Civil War but not equal in the eyes of the law until 100 years later in 1965.
[01:33.960 --> 01:38.040]  We are still struggling with racism and we have much work to do.
[01:38.040 --> 01:40.920]  And I want to understand white rage and I'm white.
[01:40.920 --> 01:45.280]  As many of you saw the result of the photograph of me at Lafayette Square last week, that
[01:45.280 --> 01:50.120]  sparked a national debate about the role of the military in civil society.
[01:50.120 --> 01:51.920]  I should not have been there.
[01:51.920 --> 01:57.280]  My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved
[01:57.280 --> 01:58.280]  in domestic politics.
[01:58.280 --> 01:59.720]  China is not an enemy.
[01:59.720 --> 02:01.160]  China is a rising power.
[02:01.160 --> 02:05.320]  The Chinese seem to feel why build it if you can just steal it.
[02:05.320 --> 02:10.800]  These are the faces of five Chinese government spies, indicted today by the Justice Department,
[02:10.800 --> 02:15.920]  accused of spying on American companies, costing them millions of dollars and causing thousands
[02:15.920 --> 02:18.200]  of Americans to lose their jobs.
[02:18.200 --> 02:25.240]  Mr. Batimajie Angwang, a member of that community affairs unit at the NYPD, is accused of spying
[02:25.240 --> 02:27.080]  for the Chinese government, of trying.
[02:27.080 --> 02:31.200]  The FBI says he worked alongside two officials at the Chinese Consulate in New York.
[02:31.200 --> 02:36.320]  He's also accused of offering those Chinese officials access to senior NYPD personnel.
[02:36.320 --> 02:42.000]  Investigators at the Lexington home of 60-year-old Dr. Charles Lieber today, moments after his
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.200]  arrest at his Harvard office.
[02:44.200 --> 02:48.240]  The complaint alleges that Dr. Lieber signed a contract with the Chinese University in
[02:48.240 --> 02:58.000]  Wuhan and was paid up to $50,000 per month, plus up to $158,000 in living expenses.
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.160]  The chair of Harvard's chemistry department, he also allegedly received more than one and
[03:03.160 --> 03:08.880]  a half million dollars to set up a research lab in China, all while working at Harvard
[03:08.880 --> 03:13.840]  and receiving multiple research grants from the US Department of Defense and National
[03:13.840 --> 03:15.040]  Institutes of Health.
[03:15.040 --> 03:20.200]  House Republicans requesting an FBI briefing on California Congressman Eric Swalwell's
[03:20.200 --> 03:23.120]  past ties to an alleged Chinese spy.
[03:23.120 --> 03:28.040]  Eric Swalwell's collusion with the Chinese spy had already set the table for a compromise
[03:28.040 --> 03:29.520]  threat to national security.
[03:29.520 --> 03:32.000]  Well, I don't have any concern that Mr. Swalwell.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.520]  And the generational family corruption of Nancy Pelosi's behind-the-scenes insurrection
[03:36.520 --> 03:41.000]  of the United States were basically ignored by the media and the government.
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.320]  Pelosi is saying, I spoke to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley,
[03:45.320 --> 03:51.280]  to discuss available precaution for preventing an unstable president from initiating military
[03:51.280 --> 03:56.480]  hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike.
[03:56.480 --> 04:00.720]  The situation of this unhinged president could not be more dangerous.
[04:00.720 --> 04:05.000]  And we must do everything that we can to protect the American people from his unbalanced
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.840]  assault on our country and our democracy.
[04:07.840 --> 04:12.960]  Bob Woodward's book, filled with anonymous sources, will do nothing to imperil globalist
[04:12.960 --> 04:18.480]  tool Mark Milley, other than rub our faces in the overt coup infiltrating the powers
[04:18.480 --> 04:23.280]  of the executive office of the president of the United States and the will of the American
[04:23.280 --> 04:24.280]  people.
[04:24.280 --> 04:28.120]  That Woodward book, Peril, is not about Milley.
[04:28.120 --> 04:34.720]  It's about Trump and his enablers, specifically confirming that Trump was as bad as reported
[04:34.720 --> 04:35.960]  and suspected.
[04:35.960 --> 04:41.760]  The former president was fomenting an insurrection and there was broad concern from a range of
[04:41.760 --> 04:49.960]  members of his national security team about his behavior and fitness for office.
[04:49.960 --> 04:51.360]  We have been occupied.
[04:51.360 --> 05:17.920]  The true insurrection has succeeded, John Bown reporting.

[05:56.120 --> 06:09.720]  Take action and I thank you.
[06:09.720 --> 06:14.480]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[06:14.480 --> 06:16.280]  Do you want to stop tyranny?
[06:16.280 --> 06:31.520]  Well so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:31.520 --> 06:36.800]  You alluded to in the previous question, China's not an enemy and I think that's important
[06:36.800 --> 06:39.720]  for people to clearly understand.
[06:39.720 --> 06:42.200]  China is a rising power.
[06:42.200 --> 06:48.240]  China has been a rising power since Deng Xiaoping in 79 and they've been clicking off at 10%
[06:48.240 --> 06:53.360]  growth for almost 30 years and they dropped down about 7% last year or two and they'll
[06:53.360 --> 06:57.920]  probably drop again and come into the range of normalcy in 3% to 5% growth.
[06:57.920 --> 07:04.840]  But that's still significant economic growth and there's been a really large historic change
[07:04.840 --> 07:11.080]  from a North Atlantic based global economy to now it's proceeding to be a North Pacific
[07:11.080 --> 07:12.800]  based global economy.
[07:12.800 --> 07:19.520]  So with respect to China, what normally happens historically, it's not in all cases but in
[07:19.520 --> 07:25.400]  most cases, where you have economic growth of that magnitude typically follows military
[07:25.400 --> 07:30.960]  power and that's what we're seeing, we're seeing a significant increase in Chinese
[07:30.960 --> 07:39.520]  military capabilities over the last 10 to 20 years and they are going to develop themselves
[07:39.520 --> 07:43.680]  and are developing themselves into a great power.
[07:43.680 --> 07:47.640]  That is not to say however that they're an enemy.
[07:47.640 --> 07:54.640]  So that is the classic Harvard Council on Foreign Relations China file spiel that you
[07:54.640 --> 07:59.680]  just got from the trader General Milley before he was elevated by Trump and that's one of
[07:59.680 --> 08:04.440]  Trump's biggest failings is he wouldn't check the pedigree of these generals, just whoever
[08:04.440 --> 08:10.760]  the Pentagon told him to put in, he would just fall down and worship them and I'm not
[08:10.760 --> 08:16.520]  bashing Trump to bash Trump, that's really where he didn't have any really deep understanding
[08:16.520 --> 08:17.520]  and was quite naive.
[08:17.520 --> 08:21.280]  And of course people talk about oh Trump's going to announce he's running for president
[08:21.280 --> 08:23.000]  the next year and he'll save us.
[08:23.000 --> 08:28.080]  The globalists aren't going to give us two and a half, three years to save the country.
[08:28.080 --> 08:33.640]  They just stole the election from Larry Elder, of course the majority of Californians voted
[08:33.640 --> 08:35.640]  to recall him.
[08:35.640 --> 08:40.000]  But they put out their fake polls, they announced there's no way he'd lose and almost every Republican
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.840]  that was on the Republican voting rolls that went to try to vote was told oh sorry somebody
[08:43.840 --> 08:49.360]  already voted for you and they had countless videos and admissions and all the proof of
[08:49.360 --> 08:50.360]  that.
[08:50.360 --> 08:56.400]  So I'm not being a negative person here with everybody, I'm simply being honest about where
[08:56.400 --> 08:58.880]  we are and what we're dealing with.
[08:58.880 --> 09:05.760]  So again thank you so much for joining us here today on the Alex Jones Transmission.
[09:05.760 --> 09:10.920]  We have about one hell of a transmission for you and the information we've got is just
[09:10.920 --> 09:14.040]  completely over the top.
[09:14.040 --> 09:20.480]  The psychological warfare going on and the gaslighting and the brainwashing and the willingness
[09:20.480 --> 09:26.320]  of people who have been raised since birth in front of television sets and the flicker
[09:26.320 --> 09:30.520]  rate designed to put people into a dreamlike state is incredible.
[09:30.520 --> 09:37.560]  So when we get mad at the leftist and the liberals and the main line conservatives and
[09:37.560 --> 09:42.960]  main line churchgoers that are buying into the whole system, we have to understand that
[09:42.960 --> 09:48.120]  they are in a trance and once they're in that trance, it's a near daydreaming, near
[09:48.120 --> 09:53.080]  sleep trance, they're hypnotized literally, this is the main line literature.
[09:53.080 --> 09:57.680]  The United States particularly chose a frequency in the 60s, they changed the frequency.
[09:57.680 --> 10:00.800]  This is in main line history books, you can look it up.
[10:00.800 --> 10:05.480]  To the flicker rate of the United States is the exact flicker rate to put people into
[10:05.480 --> 10:08.000]  a deeply suggestible state.
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.880]  There are several others that do it as well but they came to the conclusion, this flicker
[10:11.880 --> 10:16.560]  rate because you're conscious, I can't see it, but your brain, your optic nerve does
[10:16.560 --> 10:23.640]  that strobe light puts people into a trance and it's the same thing with the film projectors
[10:23.640 --> 10:28.920]  and different countries do different things but Europe had another flicker rate and Russia
[10:28.920 --> 10:35.480]  had another flicker rate but all were highly suggestible to control.
[10:35.480 --> 10:40.400]  This morning I went to the grocery store because I'm trying to just eat healthier here at the
[10:40.400 --> 10:44.640]  office and set an ordering food out all the time and I was looking at people in the grocery
[10:44.640 --> 10:50.240]  store and all of the blue-haired, I don't mean old people, you know blue and pink and
[10:50.240 --> 10:55.280]  green-haired liberals, they weren't just obese, they didn't just walk like jellyfish, they
[10:55.280 --> 10:59.840]  weren't just staring down at the floor, they looked like they were dying and they were
[10:59.840 --> 11:06.000]  all white by the way and they are the leftist ruling class that live according to bots,
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.760]  that live basically programmed by bots, by artificial friends that aren't real people,
[11:12.760 --> 11:16.360]  that are basically avatars online and I went out in the parking lot and I was putting a
[11:16.360 --> 11:21.280]  little bag of groceries in the trunk and I was looking at these people and I got a tear
[11:21.280 --> 11:24.440]  in my eye because that's what the globalists have done to us.
[11:24.440 --> 11:29.760]  They took our laziness, they took our proclivity towards sin and they just greased the skids
[11:29.760 --> 11:34.960]  to turn these people into monsters and if you try to talk to them they go from being
[11:34.960 --> 11:42.160]  in a total trance looking down at the ground to basically like a body snatcher hissing
[11:42.160 --> 11:47.040]  at you or saying F U and you just see the deep pain in their eyes.
[11:47.040 --> 11:53.440]  Now that's the process before they become programmed to what ancients would call demonic
[11:53.440 --> 11:58.120]  where they're so base level, so lower brain that whether you think it's metaphysical or
[11:58.120 --> 12:06.800]  just a function of the brain, they are like zombie like creatures, the undead and that's
[12:06.800 --> 12:11.800]  the allegory that the Pentagon, the army and the Marines have been training for a decade
[12:11.800 --> 12:18.720]  to kill zombies and the CDC talks about it and all the MSM talks about it and they say
[12:18.720 --> 12:25.640]  we're preparing to mow down zombies in mass zombie wave attacks and how are zombies dressed?
[12:25.640 --> 12:31.680]  Torn shirts, bloody, black eyes, cuts, torn pants, there's even children that are zombies
[12:31.680 --> 12:37.480]  and you mow them down and your subconscious brain is seeing your fellow humans as worthless,
[12:37.480 --> 12:42.360]  as zombies, as garbage including children that have just got to be killed and killed
[12:42.360 --> 12:47.040]  and killed and killed and you're simulating that you're desperately under attack and you're
[12:47.040 --> 12:51.960]  fighting for your life and if you don't kill all of these zombies then you're going to
[12:51.960 --> 12:57.960]  die and that's the corporate program whether it's the new cartoons you see on Netflix or
[12:57.960 --> 13:03.240]  whether it's movies is like a dream world now, they're introducing the zombie movies
[13:03.240 --> 13:09.400]  like you're on DMT or you know you're on LSD and nothing's real and nothing makes sense.
[13:09.400 --> 13:14.440]  All of this is behavioral psychologists putting everyone deeper into a trance and a nightmare
[13:14.440 --> 13:19.800]  trance where you see thousands if not hundreds of thousands of violent events every year
[13:19.800 --> 13:26.760]  that aren't real on television that are dehumanizing until your subconscious mind just thinks about
[13:26.760 --> 13:31.040]  it as like looking at a sunset and actually associates it with your cup of coffee, your
[13:31.040 --> 13:38.200]  cup of tea, your beer, your vodka, the pizza you're eating in front of the big screen television
[13:38.200 --> 13:49.800]  and then to you it's just something that you basically accept so it goes on and on and
[13:49.800 --> 13:59.160]  on and this is a program that they are carrying out against us and I'm not attacking people
[13:59.160 --> 14:04.240]  that put out zombie movies just like when I say video games habituate you to be a cold
[14:04.240 --> 14:08.600]  cold stone killer people always respond to the pre-programmed oh you want to ban my video
[14:08.600 --> 14:13.840]  games I'm like no the Pentagon in Vietnam had about half their soldiers refusing to
[14:13.840 --> 14:18.680]  shoot enemy soldiers up close so they could see them they would hesitate not wanting to
[14:18.680 --> 14:23.960]  kill a human and so they would try to train them to have a killer instinct and they learn
[14:23.960 --> 14:30.680]  with the doom video game was the first game developed but it was done in a projection
[14:30.680 --> 14:37.520]  system inside a building and then later by the late 70s early 80s the Pentagon had classified
[14:37.520 --> 14:42.680]  versions that were shoot them up going through a building but it was still projected and you
[14:42.680 --> 14:47.200]  know now you know that the official doom that's been on I guess since the early 1990s that
[14:47.200 --> 14:51.760]  was made so that they would get a hundred percent kill rates and they got the Marines
[14:51.760 --> 14:57.640]  in army up the men they put on the simulators to about a 99 percent instinct to kill somebody
[14:57.640 --> 15:03.520]  up close that's why they found people from the south or rural areas were better at war
[15:03.520 --> 15:07.680]  just because they'd already shot so many animals and done so much and habituated their mind
[15:07.680 --> 15:11.940]  the fun of the hunt that it became like a game for the people that had grown up with
[15:11.940 --> 15:16.200]  guns and hunting where they would have killed people no problem because they already had
[15:16.200 --> 15:20.440]  done it in a simulation of killing animals but you took people out of high rise buildings
[15:20.440 --> 15:24.640]  have a new york city or wherever and up close I mean any matter vietcong jumped over their
[15:24.640 --> 15:28.200]  position with a bayonet about to stab you they just go and let you know let you kill
[15:28.200 --> 15:32.240]  them same thing with the northern soldiers you know three to one against the south or
[15:32.240 --> 15:36.200]  getting their ass kicked that's what they created the NRA after after the civil war
[15:36.200 --> 15:40.040]  was to get northerners learn how to shoot it wasn't that northerners were wimps in a
[15:40.040 --> 15:45.480]  fistfight or something no it was that they'd never been around guns never been around actual
[15:45.480 --> 15:49.240]  killing with them all right so that's what's going on with the whole zombification they're
[15:49.240 --> 15:52.800]  turning us into zombies before they kill us and they've done that with the left and it's
[15:52.800 --> 15:57.520]  very very sad we'll come back with all the big news if you're concerned about the power
[15:57.520 --> 16:02.520]  grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity this will be the most
[16:02.520 --> 16:08.480]  important message you'll hear this year here's why we now have a small number of solar generators
[16:08.480 --> 16:13.680]  back in stock these emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you
[16:13.680 --> 16:19.840]  need it most and unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly emit no dangerous fumes
[16:19.840 --> 16:25.320]  and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun whether it's wildfires dangerous

[20:38.120 --> 20:44.920]  will fail if we fail they will depopulate us with soft kill incremental operation lock
[20:44.920 --> 20:50.680]  step assaults now we've got unbelievable the biggest yet it just keeps getting bigger by
[20:50.680 --> 20:56.400]  the week developments on the whole global government covid world id poison rollout that's
[20:56.400 --> 21:01.200]  next segment modernist says oh if you've taken our shot you're twice as likely to get covid
[21:01.200 --> 21:08.840]  their answer more shots that's coming up but let's get back to milley milley confirmed
[21:08.840 --> 21:13.120]  just like i told everybody a couple days ago people are like this isn't real even trump
[21:13.120 --> 21:18.760]  said this can't be really said i don't believe it's real on newsmax that's what he said two
[21:18.760 --> 21:22.240]  nights ago when it first broke he said i don't believe milley called up and said if we're
[21:22.240 --> 21:25.720]  gonna attack we'll tell you first and trump tried to overthrow the government but we
[21:25.720 --> 21:30.280]  stopped him and we've got the nukes and we're your friends and i've got a five year rapport
[21:30.280 --> 21:37.000]  with you and you can trust me and the chinese general thought that he was being set up he
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.720]  almost launched nuclear weapons because nobody acts like this except these evil globalist
[21:41.720 --> 21:47.520]  sycophants that again are are just so blinded by their own narcissism and corruption they
[21:47.520 --> 21:51.600]  have no idea what they're doing well milley came out yesterday like i told you and said
[21:51.600 --> 21:58.400]  no it's real it's a transcript bob lobert was given the transcript by the nsa because
[21:58.400 --> 22:04.120]  they leak whatever they want the globalists wanted this out they wanted you to know that
[22:04.120 --> 22:09.400]  hello c and schumer took control of the nuclear weapons weeks before trump left office they
[22:09.400 --> 22:13.680]  want you to know there was a bureaucratic coup they want to set the precedent for that
[22:13.680 --> 22:19.320]  they set the precedent for all other forms of authoritarianism you're in a globalist
[22:19.320 --> 22:25.440]  coup that's the headline of the name of the day show is that america awakens the fact
[22:25.440 --> 22:30.200]  that we live under a globalist coup and if we start getting senators and governors and
[22:30.200 --> 22:34.400]  house members to talk like that and realize that because the globalists are all saying
[22:34.400 --> 22:39.080]  it then it's game over or they really paid off too are they just acting like they're
[22:39.080 --> 22:45.440]  the opposition is josh holly and ran paul and all of them just opposition loyal opposition
[22:45.440 --> 22:49.280]  because trump actually went after china say what you want i'm gonna explain that here in
[22:49.280 --> 22:52.280]  just a moment and i'm not saying ram paul's bad i'm not saying josh holly's bad i'm not
[22:52.280 --> 22:56.200]  saying no they're good they know all this though they're just as smart as i am a smarter
[22:56.200 --> 23:00.520]  and they know you don't want to go there you'll get targeted we're already getting targeted
[23:00.520 --> 23:04.560]  they already broke your ribs senator paul they're already trying to kill you and shot
[23:04.560 --> 23:08.880]  scolese at the baseball game and cnn said well the guy wasn't a monster he was fighting
[23:08.880 --> 23:13.320]  tyranny so what happens if somebody shoots wolf putzer and i'm not saying do that i'll
[23:13.320 --> 23:17.120]  turn him into a little martyr i'm just saying you're drawing the blood you're launching
[23:17.120 --> 23:24.880]  the attacks so what did millie really say he said the cfr spiel that was launched really
[23:24.880 --> 23:33.240]  in the last administration of reagan and you you you you heard millie say since 1979 it's
[23:33.240 --> 23:39.440]  really when china fully opened up the cia put malin 49 but after mount dominated in the
[23:39.440 --> 23:43.640]  next 30 years his own people and slaughtered him and killed him and killed 100 million
[23:43.640 --> 23:48.920]  of them then he stepped down and in came the globalist agent after the killing fields after
[23:48.920 --> 23:56.120]  the culling was done that was the big debate back in 49 and 1950 and 51 52 when this happened
[23:56.120 --> 24:00.680]  when our own military in general spoke up and macArthur spoke up about what was done
[24:00.680 --> 24:06.000]  and the betrayal of china this was all on tv and in the newspapers back then that elements
[24:06.000 --> 24:11.440]  of our government put malisade done into power that's mainline history i remember the john
[24:11.440 --> 24:15.080]  berts decided how about that the 1980s and magazines i read and then i saw the former
[24:15.080 --> 24:21.680]  cia section chief for southeast asia and china on discovery channel was history channel
[24:21.680 --> 24:25.720]  and he was admitting that they put malin to power which we already knew and betrayed shan
[24:25.720 --> 24:30.120]  kai shek because they thought he'd be a better stabilizing force on the same show it was
[24:30.120 --> 24:35.520]  uh they were interviewing kermit roosevelt as well who overthrew iran and mozadec and
[24:35.520 --> 24:41.640]  operation ajax and put the mulas in 79 but they said we thought it would be more of a
[24:41.640 --> 24:47.920]  stabilizing group the communist and then betrayed shan kai shek who went to uh hong kong
[24:47.920 --> 24:56.160]  in taiwan so all that's going on and and and here's milley saying well they've risen 10
[24:56.160 --> 25:03.560]  percent growth rates in the last uh you know 40 years but but but it was one sided trade
[25:03.560 --> 25:08.720]  deals where china wouldn't let our goods in but then the government created laws and regulations
[25:08.720 --> 25:12.640]  where you couldn't operate here with all the laws and all the insurance and all the regulations
[25:12.640 --> 25:19.320]  but then it all had to go to china and now trump tried to end our surrender to the trade
[25:19.320 --> 25:23.800]  war we've been under via the globalist orchestrating it with china and well you saw what happened
[25:23.800 --> 25:28.760]  they stole the election from and the rest is history so listen to him very very carefully
[25:28.760 --> 25:32.040]  listen to milley what he's really saying or he's just laying out that they're the new
[25:32.040 --> 25:36.160]  power they're the superpower they'll be the power in the world america won't be but it
[25:36.160 --> 25:40.640]  doesn't mean they're our enemy they sold us out to it but of course china will be double
[25:40.640 --> 25:46.720]  crossed by the globalist again as well here it is as you alluded to in the previous question
[25:46.720 --> 25:51.800]  uh china is not an enemy uh and i think that's important for people to clearly understand
[25:51.800 --> 25:59.960]  uh china is a rising power uh china has been a rising power since ding jiao ping in 79
[25:59.960 --> 26:04.320]  and they've been clicking off at 10 growth for almost 30 years and they dropped down
[26:04.320 --> 26:08.800]  about seven percent last year too and they'll probably drop again you know and come into
[26:08.800 --> 26:13.040]  the range of normalcy and three to five percent growth but that's still significant economic
[26:13.040 --> 26:20.360]  growth and there's been a really large historic change from a north atlantic based global
[26:20.360 --> 26:28.040]  economy to now it's proceeding to be a north pacific based global economy so with respect
[26:28.040 --> 26:34.760]  to china what normally happens historically it's not in all cases but in most cases where
[26:34.760 --> 26:40.400]  you have economic growth of that magnitude typically follows military power and that's
[26:40.400 --> 26:47.000]  what we're seeing we're seeing a significant increase in in chinese military capabilities
[26:47.000 --> 26:54.160]  over the last 10 to 20 years and they are going to develop themselves and are developing
[26:54.160 --> 26:59.520]  themselves uh into a great power that is not to say however that they're an enemy
[26:59.520 --> 27:05.920]  no they just ship in fentanyl and kill millions of people and undercut us and threaten to
[27:05.920 --> 27:08.960]  attack us and say they're going to nuke us and say we're weak on their national television
[27:08.960 --> 27:12.560]  officially talk trash about us but you're on their payroll you traitor you're not even
[27:12.560 --> 27:16.120]  a traitor you're never an american you're a sack of garbage and that's why they had to
[27:16.120 --> 27:19.920]  do the lockdowns all over the world china's on under them to make sure they end up being
[27:19.920 --> 27:24.080]  in global power million others are holding us and our children underwater while injecting
[27:24.080 --> 27:28.200]  us with deadly poison shots that destroy our immune systems and kill us and spread new
[27:28.200 --> 27:33.480]  mutants and none of the rest of the world actually takes it because milley you know
[27:33.480 --> 27:38.240]  his brief they're running a bio attack on us through the carding endowment that runs
[27:38.240 --> 27:42.960]  the cia it doesn't matter if you work for the cia the fbi they're going to shoot you
[27:42.960 --> 27:45.920]  up too and you're going to you're going to get sick and die except now folks are waking

[27:50.280 --> 27:53.480]  are exempt see it's all just us that have got to take it they're supposed to be the new
[27:53.480 --> 27:59.920]  managerial class but here's Joe Biden on national television just a few years ago saying china
[27:59.920 --> 28:06.480]  it owns america they own us he's a chinese agent here it is i do know a lot about foreign
[28:06.480 --> 28:14.600]  policy as much as anybody in this room including if you're henry kissinger who i love folks
[28:14.600 --> 28:20.480]  we have mortgaged our foreign policy everyone's out there going oh my god how in god's name

[29:08.080 --> 29:12.600]  it's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death you
[29:12.600 --> 29:17.200]  probably already believe that i certainly do so here's the thing i wanted to get past
[29:17.200 --> 29:22.680]  the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually have studies that demonstrate
[29:22.680 --> 29:27.720]  some efficacy in immune support now you'll have to sign a waiver but you can check out

[30:30.880 --> 30:36.440]  it happened helsey bragg back on january eight that took place then and is saying that she

[33:36.960 --> 33:44.120]  the transcript where he says they'll own us in the next 15 years from just a few months
[33:44.120 --> 33:51.800]  ago so it's not just biden in a clip looks like from about five six years ago when he
[33:51.800 --> 33:57.120]  was vice president i remember him saying that we're trying to find the date to him now saying
[33:57.120 --> 34:03.280]  it again yeah there's a daily mail joe biden says china wants to own america by 2035 after
[34:03.280 --> 34:08.800]  previously insisting they're not in competition for us i've been growing tension over covid
[34:08.800 --> 34:15.240]  lab leak claim wow print me that place and see here's what's crazy i came on air monday
[34:15.240 --> 34:18.720]  towards the end of the show and i went on owens war room at three o'clock because we had
[34:18.720 --> 34:22.840]  more info then and people in the crew smart they asked me hey how do you know this is
[34:22.840 --> 34:27.520]  true bob weaver's you know lies sometimes and trump came out and said i don't even believe
[34:27.520 --> 34:35.440]  this i said no it's true and right then one of the crew members goes yeah look at this
[34:35.440 --> 34:40.480]  pelosi said it january 8th cnn so that's the simpotico around here how we're synced up
[34:40.480 --> 34:44.480]  and i'm like that's right look up all the times they said we've got the nukes milley
[34:44.480 --> 34:48.760]  protected the nukes they'll take trump out of me to be i sound like 15 articles they
[34:48.760 --> 34:54.800]  were all over the damn tv in january remember on january 6 thing or stings is pearl harbour
[34:54.800 --> 35:00.640]  worse than 9 11 worst attack ever oh my god a terror attack trumps can use the military
[35:00.640 --> 35:04.600]  for a coup but the military says they won't be part of it and they had the troops do an
[35:04.600 --> 35:10.440]  allegiance to biden before he even got in they were still in the election that's how
[35:10.440 --> 35:15.920]  a coup happens but of course it was real they said it he bragged about it now they just
[35:15.920 --> 35:22.360]  gave us the actual transcript and milley came out yesterday and said it's on info wars
[35:22.360 --> 35:27.800]  dot com general milley confirms secret phone call to china defense treasonous act as part
[35:27.800 --> 35:34.200]  of his duties and the secretary of state came out defended it and the secretary of defense
[35:34.200 --> 35:39.480]  came out said oh it's completely normal to call people and say i've taken the nukes away
[35:39.480 --> 35:47.960]  and trump tried to overthrow the government trump is the president he was the president
[35:47.960 --> 35:56.640]  he still is the president love him or hate him president trump doesn't get to use taxpayer
[35:56.640 --> 36:03.280]  money to pay for his rallies he has to get campaign money and they were out of money
[36:03.280 --> 36:11.040]  then and so i and others organized that wasn't bragging when i told the story you remember
[36:11.040 --> 36:16.400]  back before the january six rally back in december i said listen none of the republicans will
[36:16.400 --> 36:19.920]  give him money republican establishment wants him out they're all saying he lost him though
[36:19.920 --> 36:25.880]  he didn't no one will step up everyone is scared because the deep state will come after you
[36:25.880 --> 36:33.800]  so i'm putting the first 80 something thousand dollars down and when people heard that republican
[36:33.800 --> 36:38.000]  donors called me and said who do we give it to and i said here i'll get you in touch with
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.960]  the white house campaign staff you give them the money don't give it to me and then they
[36:42.960 --> 36:46.680]  had that much arrest jones he admitted he attacked the capital he admitted he financed
[36:46.680 --> 36:53.560]  it no i financed the other big rallies in dc that trump didn't come to he drove by him
[36:53.560 --> 36:58.040]  saying it was a fraud remember the one in november the one in december and it wasn't
[36:58.040 --> 37:02.040]  because i'm daddy warbucks and got a bunch of money around here i saw the fraud i had
[37:02.040 --> 37:07.060]  to go i had to make myself a target because it was my duty and we had a million people
[37:07.060 --> 37:13.600]  at that rally and then trump said peacefully go and march around the capital we did too
[37:13.600 --> 37:17.560]  and there were no police there to speak of and there were provocateurs that attacked
[37:17.560 --> 37:22.680]  them from antifa and then manipulated a couple hundred of conservatives most of them led by
[37:22.680 --> 37:30.120]  operatives we now know tucker carlson's got the document so we that the triple triple
[37:30.120 --> 37:35.720]  the number that we saw in michigan where it was ten fbi agents setting up that militia
[37:35.720 --> 37:45.120]  to try to kidnap the governor and that same group went and got at least 30 fbi agents and
[37:45.120 --> 37:50.160]  confidential informants to lead the groups and tell them we're with q trump's ordered
[37:50.160 --> 37:57.840]  us to take the building delton forces inside and it just so happened then a bunch of army
[37:57.840 --> 38:03.360]  veterans people i was with showed up and tried to stop it so no the military was outside
[38:03.360 --> 38:07.720]  not inside and tried to stop it but but that's the q thing none of it's real it's fake you're
[38:07.720 --> 38:11.880]  in a fantasy you're talking to the president you're under his command no you were under
[38:11.880 --> 38:19.280]  the deep states command you were under millies command we now know that millie and honoree
[38:19.280 --> 38:23.920]  were running the entire operation that's come out even in time magazine that the military
[38:23.920 --> 38:28.760]  knew and they were coordinating and the democrats bragged that time article about how they stood
[38:28.760 --> 38:32.480]  down that day and didn't come out to confront us because they knew that we get out of hand
[38:32.480 --> 38:39.880]  no we never get out of hand you did and set us up and now it's coming out poll half of
[38:39.880 --> 38:47.040]  americans agree january six suspects are political prisoners and now a federal judge has said
[38:47.040 --> 38:55.800]  all riot charges might be unconstitutional they've got six hundred people in jail close
[38:55.800 --> 39:02.160]  to six hundred and most of them didn't lay a hand or break anything in solitary confinement
[39:02.160 --> 39:08.120]  till they break and say that they're never going to be political again never going to
[39:08.120 --> 39:11.960]  watch alex jones or michael and double again that's actually in the news never going to
[39:11.960 --> 39:17.520]  question an election again and then the police the feds come to their houses and check and
[39:17.520 --> 39:21.480]  if they and then so they came to a guy's house he was in the garage working on a car had michael
[39:21.480 --> 39:24.880]  indell's conference on they said you're not supposed to be watching anything about the
[39:24.880 --> 39:28.960]  election and the guy said well i am i'm an american and they took him to jail he's in
[39:28.960 --> 39:33.600]  solitary confinement and they have articles in the hill and seeing in life how great we
[39:33.600 --> 39:38.960]  should start arresting everybody that questions the election this is beyond the soviet union
[39:38.960 --> 39:45.880]  now they would arrest you and send you to a gulag for less but it wasn't so overt they
[39:45.880 --> 39:54.960]  claimed it wasn't going on so ladies and gentlemen i mean this is just over the top craziness
[39:54.960 --> 39:59.080]  and when a group run by a bunch of congressional staffers and others it's going to have a protest
[39:59.080 --> 40:05.440]  this weekend on saturday a peaceful protest simply calling for fair treatment of prisoners
[40:05.440 --> 40:08.960]  where's amnesty international where are the liberals they're nowhere they're like keep them in
[40:08.960 --> 40:17.040]  jail forever and they're everywhere with petitions saying arrest alex jones and and and he's
[40:17.040 --> 40:20.840]  a ringleader because this is the mental illness all right we're going to go to break long
[40:20.840 --> 40:28.680]  segment coming up i want to talk about solutions when we return and we've got some damn good
[40:28.680 --> 40:33.840]  ones and we can win this if we push this this tyranny is really out of control and it counts
[40:33.840 --> 40:38.240]  on our weaknesses succeed and we there's a lot of weak people a lot of jellyfish a lot
[40:38.240 --> 40:41.880]  of people in trance look the globalists know they don't really count they're they do what
[40:41.880 --> 40:48.440]  they're told but if even 10 percent of us halfway don't comply this thing goes down
[40:48.440 --> 40:52.960]  so if you were ever going to march or rally or protest or file lawsuits or spread the word
[40:52.960 --> 40:58.240]  or or pray for an awakening or do whatever it is to not comply or quit your job as a
[40:58.240 --> 41:03.520]  nurse or whatever it is to show the system you're not going along with this do it now
[41:03.520 --> 41:06.880]  now they want to go ahead and just have a violent revolution which they'll then use
[41:06.880 --> 41:10.440]  and collapse the country and claus wabbit mitz and the un admits they want that they're
[41:10.440 --> 41:18.720]  pushing that but they'll get the second thing they want when we pull ourselves out of the
[41:18.720 --> 41:23.400]  system they don't be able to drive school buses to be school tears so many teachers are sick
[41:23.400 --> 41:26.760]  from the shots that's the main reason when others are quitting over the shots not taking
[41:26.760 --> 41:30.840]  them and so now they're saying oh the hospitals are full because of covid no they're mainly
[41:30.840 --> 41:36.000]  full because everybody's left and it's quitting up to half in france and germany and here australia
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.840]  up to half the people quit and they're going to set up their own companies their own businesses
[41:39.840 --> 41:43.520]  now and the regulators say they're going to target them oh really you're going to target
[41:43.520 --> 41:48.560]  millions of people you can't get that many if we don't comply now up front their system
[41:48.560 --> 41:52.720]  fails but yes it'll make the economy for a while fall apart they were already going
[41:52.720 --> 41:56.960]  to do that with new lockdowns so they want the economy to fall apart don't shop with
[41:56.960 --> 42:01.040]  the big stores don't support the system don't support chinese owned hollywood communist owned
[42:01.040 --> 42:06.520]  hollywood support independent media spread the word like your life depends on it because
[42:06.520 --> 42:12.360]  it does go to the city council go to the school board go to the state house go bullhorn go
[42:12.360 --> 42:17.320]  bullhorn out cvs about how deadly the shots are go bullhorn outside schools get your skin
[42:17.320 --> 42:22.680]  in the game or it's all over and it's a majority of one one person does it more see it it'll
[42:22.680 --> 42:28.080]  be a chan reaction it's already happened but let me explain something things only get worse
[42:28.080 --> 42:33.960]  until we say no all you've got to do is stand up you're going to figure it out soon you
[42:33.960 --> 42:38.040]  don't want to wait till stuff's really bad they got a plan to collapse things and kill
[42:38.040 --> 42:43.720]  billions by 2030 that's official that's why biden says the world ends in 2030 for us it
[42:43.720 --> 42:48.200]  does we're going to be dead according to their plan it's their plan not mine i didn't say
[42:48.200 --> 42:53.240]  it they did they're coming to kill you within eight and a half years they're coming they're
[42:53.240 --> 43:21.640]  murdering you now and normalizing it what was the most important point in joe biden's declaration
[43:21.640 --> 43:28.120]  that he's following a u n globalist great recent blueprint that australia the uk europe and
[43:28.120 --> 43:34.240]  the rest of western world is and that this is just the beginning more lockdowns national
[43:34.240 --> 43:39.360]  medical ids approved by the united nations carbon taxes that don't just track a trade
[43:39.360 --> 43:43.640]  should tax you but actually tell you when you could go somewhere and what you can do it's
[43:43.640 --> 43:49.440]  all been announced at the u n level this is a u n world government takeover corporate
[43:49.440 --> 43:54.720]  revolution through global governance it's illegal and congress must stand up and stop
[43:54.720 --> 44:02.240]  it now globalist general milley has revealed to the world that the united states is not
[44:02.240 --> 44:07.400]  a free republic but is run by a permanent state by a network bureaucracy the big takeaway
[44:07.400 --> 44:13.160]  here is is that he didn't act alone he felt that he was safe to talk on an overseas phone
[44:13.160 --> 44:18.960]  line system that he knew was being watched by the star government the five eyes the russians
[44:18.960 --> 44:23.320]  and the chinese he wanted the world to know that he was proud of what he was doing because
[44:23.320 --> 44:28.680]  he was backed by the deep state this permanent bureaucracy sees america as its enemy it sees
[44:28.680 --> 44:34.280]  the american people as its enemy it sees prosperity as its enemy and it conspired with the communist
[44:34.280 --> 44:39.640]  chinese to threaten them basically and say trump may nuke you but if he tries we'll call
[44:39.640 --> 44:44.960]  and say we're attacking you so you can respond first that's beyond treason but it shows the
[44:44.960 --> 44:49.240]  type of anti-american sycophants living in their own vetted bubble they try to get away
[44:49.240 --> 44:57.080]  with this milley and all of his accomplices need to go to prison now for life i'll tell
[44:57.080 --> 45:02.000]  you what's life and death if you don't have freedom of speech if if you don't have the
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.960]  right to be able to communicate then you don't have a future always when governments take
[45:06.960 --> 45:10.640]  away speech they then enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating
[45:10.640 --> 45:15.600]  the population and america the entire world is going down the tubes because the un global

[47:38.440 --> 47:42.200]  live but somewhere in the world it's night but i'm talking about the night the darkness
[47:42.200 --> 47:45.880]  the globalists try to bring down upon us so we can't see what's happening in front of
[47:45.880 --> 47:50.840]  us they can only succeed if we're in the dark and info wars and all of you out there that
[47:50.840 --> 47:54.200]  spread the word about the transmission and that share the articles and the videos you

[47:58.040 --> 48:04.200]  you and thank you and want to remind you how damn important you are and to have you realize
[48:04.200 --> 48:09.800]  that you've got to quadruple your effort to then do it again and again because this is the struggle
[48:09.800 --> 48:15.240]  this is the authoritarian takeover this was foretold of 2000 plus years and this is the time
[48:15.240 --> 48:20.200]  to wake people up this is the time to reach out to others this is the time to get people to take
[48:20.200 --> 48:27.560]  action and christians 200 years ago had a big problem people would read revelation about the
[48:27.560 --> 48:31.240]  antichrist the market the beast taking over and killing a bunch of people and then the greatest
[48:31.240 --> 48:35.160]  revival ever and that's the time for us to tell the truth and then the rapture comes after christ's
[48:35.160 --> 48:41.800]  return well that was scaring christians and so they came out with a pre-tribulation rapture you
[48:41.800 --> 48:46.840]  can believe that all you want but there wasn't a rapture for christians and nazi germany or
[48:46.840 --> 48:51.080]  soviet russia there wasn't a rapture for him in china the ones in death camps right now there
[48:51.080 --> 48:57.800]  wasn't one for jesus there wasn't one for his disciples god is going to test you so the churches
[48:57.800 --> 49:01.960]  have lied to you and don't get mad at me fine you go ahead and take your chip take your world
[49:01.960 --> 49:06.120]  government take your shots the churches tell you do it the pope says it's it's it's a sacrament
[49:07.400 --> 49:13.400]  to take the genome of dead babies into your body and jellyfish everything else okay okay you go
[49:13.400 --> 49:19.000]  ahead and watch revelation unfold and then go ahead and submit to the evil because your church is not
[49:19.000 --> 49:25.000]  a church it's a den of devils christ said in the end days let no man deceive you because they're
[49:25.000 --> 49:32.200]  going to control the church so that's what's going on this is the big test ladies and gentlemen
[49:32.200 --> 49:35.640]  and you're going to see christians bow down to the antichrist you're going to see him sacrifice
[49:35.640 --> 49:41.160]  their children in order to be because i'm getting i'm getting raptured that well there's the man of
[49:41.160 --> 49:45.960]  sin the world government he'll be nuking countries he'll be killing billions and they'll say he is
[49:45.960 --> 49:52.440]  jesus he is jesus because they're not of god they are deceived they have taken on the great deception
[49:52.440 --> 50:02.760]  and i'm sad for them but no nobody raptured those billions of babies aborted you will face
[50:03.880 --> 50:09.160]  the test you will be put to the grindstone you go ahead and believe your fantasy land all you want
[50:09.160 --> 50:13.160]  it's just like the people that take all the shots you go i want more it protects me when it doesn't
[50:15.320 --> 50:16.680]  maderna has come out
[50:19.320 --> 50:22.920]  and admitted you're twice as likely to get coveted if you took their vaccine
[50:22.920 --> 50:26.680]  which is three times stronger than Pfizer and even more deadly the evidence shows
[50:26.680 --> 50:33.400]  and their answer to all of that their answer is you need to take more shots now
[50:34.200 --> 50:37.720]  where's the logic there oh it lowers your immune system makes you get sicker
[50:37.720 --> 50:42.760]  israel now reports that you're two to one more likely it's not just per capita that more got
[50:42.760 --> 50:47.000]  the injection so most in the hospital or that are sick have had the injection it's that you're
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.440]  twice as likely to have coveted and be seriously ill or die if you've had the shot
[50:52.440 --> 50:56.520]  that's on national israeli television we talked about it showed you the article
[50:56.520 --> 51:01.080]  yesterday but it's in hebrew and and look at these headlines i'll get the solutions
[51:01.080 --> 51:08.040]  box news maderna analysis those vaccinated last year twice more likely to get coveted
[51:08.040 --> 51:12.600]  than those jabbed recently what does that even mean the view coho's clash
[51:14.120 --> 51:18.520]  people who receive maderna's vaccine early are twice as likely to get breakthrough infection
[51:19.080 --> 51:24.600]  point is it doesn't work fda scientists strike skeptical tone on need for covet 19 boosters
[51:24.600 --> 51:29.240]  at this time likely feeling debates but foutsies the boss he says it goes forward and for children
[51:29.240 --> 51:35.240]  fizer amadernas a cover vaccine protection wanes over time and lowers your immune system to every
[51:35.240 --> 51:43.000]  other virus oh yeah health ministry chief says coronavirus spreading health ministry in israel's
[51:43.000 --> 51:48.680]  chief says coronavirus spread reaching record highs even though they're record vaccinated
[51:48.680 --> 51:52.840]  record illnesses record deaths countries right next door that didn't take it they're just fine
[51:52.840 --> 51:59.160]  same headline state sounds alarm over coba 19 outbreaks among school kids
[52:02.120 --> 52:07.720]  to stop coba there's only one way let's all get vaccinated it's all lies there's other fake
[52:07.720 --> 52:13.880]  article put up by the health and human services on twitter and force better buys feeds coba vaccines
[52:13.880 --> 52:18.760]  are highly effective against the delta variant and everyone 12 and up is eligible so let's see those
[52:18.760 --> 52:28.440]  alarms load up those backpacks and get off to a great start so let's set those alarms load up
[52:28.440 --> 52:32.520]  those backpacks and get off to a great start part of schools get in the shot look at this
[52:32.520 --> 52:37.080]  oh it's highly effective yet 39% effectiveness see and then lowers your immune system everything
[52:37.080 --> 52:43.080]  else oh that's highly effective oh you get on this airplane it's highly safe you live 39% of the
[52:43.080 --> 52:47.240]  time oh this car is very safe every time you drive it it doesn't blow up 39% of the time
[52:47.240 --> 52:54.520]  I'll look at that it was for Jacob Kleineck 13 years old took the second shot died within three
[52:54.520 --> 53:05.320]  days of taking it he had a enlarged heart just like Ernest Ramirez jr that we personally
[53:05.960 --> 53:10.520]  know his father but it's okay stop coba's only way on one way to get vaccinated
[53:10.520 --> 53:18.200]  it says team Pfizer the same guy I guess works for Pfizer claims he does or implies he does and
[53:18.200 --> 53:23.800]  says I need to be arrested there you go what a what a good person vaccinated woman's family
[53:24.360 --> 53:29.880]  who died of COVID blames unvaccinated for the obituary even though they were vaccinated
[53:29.880 --> 53:35.640]  wow not a lot of common sense with her but let me give you the good news we're gonna talk about
[53:35.640 --> 53:43.240]  this next hour with David Ike solution standing up taking action waking people up standing up the
[53:43.240 --> 53:49.720]  bullies Nicki Minaj comes out three days ago talks about a friend of hers someone she knows
[53:49.720 --> 53:53.800]  who got the shot and their testicles swell up and they were impotent after and that's in
[53:53.800 --> 53:58.360]  some of the bad reactions uterus is swell up get bloody they've got to have hysterectomies
[53:58.360 --> 54:02.520]  that's all over the news they admit it that's a side effect it's just uncontrolled bleeding for
[54:02.520 --> 54:06.680]  weeks they just do hysterectomy because your whole body just eats itself the endometrium
[54:06.680 --> 54:12.200]  get endometriosis and other things this is real science and they just go oh they attack her and
[54:12.200 --> 54:17.320]  then they blocked her on twitter they said she's not allowed to criticize the shots or tell them
[54:17.320 --> 54:23.720]  what's happening just like Ernest Ramirez was on facebook and he got suspended because he talked
[54:23.720 --> 54:28.360]  about his dead son you're not allowed to talk about your dead son okay they had an autopsy
[54:28.360 --> 54:33.640]  oh the other kid had an autopsy okay they had a swollen heart big deal he's dead get used to it
[54:33.640 --> 54:39.400]  mr. Ramirez you can't go out you can't fly on a plane you won't be able to get groceries soon
[54:39.400 --> 54:43.480]  if you haven't had it you're hurting other people hey your shot doesn't work it makes people sick
[54:43.480 --> 54:50.680]  you say i gotta get more all the time shut up mr. Ramirez roll over and die so i'm gonna get into
[54:50.680 --> 54:56.840]  those solutions and talk about how Nicki Minaj can go public and if Tucker Carlson can wake up and
[54:56.840 --> 55:01.880]  if you wake up and if others wake up and if Eric Clapton who was here in town last night refused
[55:01.880 --> 55:06.840]  to play a show at the Frank Irwin Center unless there was no force mass policy or force injection
[55:06.840 --> 55:12.280]  policy he almost died from it he has enough clout to fight back that boobly a idiot canceled because
[55:12.280 --> 55:16.360]  they wouldn't make everybody take the shot he said he doesn't care if they have immunity he wants
[55:16.360 --> 55:20.040]  them to take it this might have been hurt some because the corporations are telling that little
[55:20.040 --> 55:26.840]  whore what to do this is a fight you gotta decide which side you're on now listen speaking of COVID

[58:58.600 --> 59:04.360]  were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this have clearly
[59:04.360 --> 59:09.560]  stated their goal of having 80 percent of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence
[59:09.560 --> 59:15.320]  hive mind in less than nine years for those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this is
[59:15.320 --> 59:20.520]  all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things to do
[59:21.480 --> 59:25.960]  we continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken from the

[1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:23.080]  bunch of these from him and sell him an info war store but right now you get them at davidicke.com
[1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:27.720]  i want to talk about solutions too with david and what nikki menage and others are doing realizing
[1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:33.080]  their freedom is everything this is a deep tyranny we're already into and uh what david thinks is
[1:00:33.080 --> 1:00:37.560]  coming up next but look at this photo first we'll show you a video coming up we're gonna post this
[1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:42.760]  on info wars dot com breaking our drone is back over the international bridge in del rio texas
[1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:47.480]  her source the number of migrants waiting the process has now swelled to approximately 8,200
[1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:53.000]  it was 4,000 yesterday looks like a football stadium folks this is just one border crossing
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:56.760]  under the bridge remember when they were trying to hide it it was like a thousand people under it
[1:00:56.760 --> 1:01:04.680]  every day now it's 8,000 and it's just it's all i mean this is just they've collapsed the border
[1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:08.760]  just like they collapsed it on the europe all by design here's tucker carlson last night talking
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:12.760]  about the bullying of nikki menage and how she's standing up and nikki put it out that's when
[1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:17.880]  they blocked her on twitter they don't want solidarity and having us come together welcome
[1:01:17.880 --> 1:01:23.560]  to tucker carlson tonight who knew who could have guessed that rapper nikki menage would turn out to
[1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:29.800]  be one of the bravest people in the united states a couple of days ago we we would guess most people
[1:01:29.800 --> 1:01:35.320]  watch the show may not have heard of nikki menage and then she tweeted about the covet vaccine she
[1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:41.400]  didn't come out against the vaccines she merely said that as an adult and an american she should
[1:01:41.400 --> 1:01:46.600]  decide whether or not to take the vaccine pray about it she said don't be bullied
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:54.200]  ha things blew up from there no praying about it you must submit to being bullied those are the new
[1:01:54.200 --> 1:02:00.520]  rules nikki menage wasn't aware of that and she resisted and she's still resistant it's a long
[1:02:00.520 --> 1:02:04.680]  and interesting story there's implications for all of us and trace gallagher has agreed tonight
[1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:08.760]  to frame it for us to set it up just tell us what's going on and here he is hey trace hey
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:13.240]  tucker the controversy stems from nikki menage telling her fans she would only get the covet
[1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:18.440]  vaccine once she did enough research and she recommended her fans do the same and here's
[1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:23.880]  the tweet most people focused on quoting here my cousin in trinidad won't get the vaccine because
[1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:29.720]  his friend got it and became impotent his testicles became swollen his friend was weeks away from
[1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:34.840]  getting married now the girl called off the wedding so just pray on it and make sure you're
[1:02:34.840 --> 1:02:40.360]  comfortable with your decision not bullied well tucker then talked about that tweet last night
[1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:48.280]  and today nikki menage retweeted this clip watch it's nikki menage's cousin's friends testicles
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:55.160]  who are swollen from taking the facts that's the claim but it's not anything to do with the physical
[1:02:55.160 --> 1:03:00.760]  effect of the vaccine that makes our political class mad it's the last part of nikki menage's
[1:03:00.760 --> 1:03:07.400]  tweet that enrages them the part where she says you should pray on it make the decision yourself
[1:03:07.400 --> 1:03:15.000]  like a free human being and quote don't be bullied so our media and public health officials didn't
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:20.120]  like this because they make their livings bullying people so they couldn't let it stand of course the
[1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:26.120]  haters came out of the woodwork attacking menage tucker and this show menage was also criticized
[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:34.680]  by msnbc's joy reid watch that you have 22 million followers on twitter for you to use your platform
[1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:40.600]  to encourage our community to not protect themselves and save their lives my god sister you could
[1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:45.960]  do better than that menage responded to reid saying quote this is what happens when you're so
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:52.200]  thirsty to down another black woman by the request of the white man that you didn't bother to read
[1:03:52.200 --> 1:03:57.400]  all of my tweets menage went on to say she never told anyone not to get the shot just to learn
[1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:03.480]  more about it and she's right she told her fans to wear a mask and to get the shot if they had to
[1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:09.480]  for work but now she says she's in twitter jail writing in park quoting again i'm in twitter jail
[1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:14.920]  y'all they didn't like what i was saying over there on that block asking questions is okay
[1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:23.240]  i like being effing dumb then boom can't tweet she also went on instagram live look people will
[1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:33.000]  turn their back on you not agreeing but people will isolate you if you simply speak and ask
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:41.080]  a question folks you notice how even when she groveled to them a little bit they came after her
[1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:46.760]  this is tyranny that they're organizing their people into persecuting us and not letting us
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:50.440]  go to the grocery store have a job or fly on a plane and that's just the beginning and there's
[1:04:50.440 --> 1:04:54.760]  never going to be an end to the shots this is yet this is the global government the force injections

[1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:06.520]  you don't have the right to be able to communicate then you don't have a future always when governments
[1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:10.440]  take away speech they then enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating the
[1:05:10.440 --> 1:05:15.880]  population and america the entire world is going down the tubes because the un global is directed
[1:05:15.880 --> 1:05:20.200]  great reset that's why it's more important than ever that info war stay on the air and that all

[1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:07.720]  this is a much bigger fight than just what the uk is seeing though it's the center or one of the
[1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:14.680]  main centers of the spider's web the people aren't bad but the the evil force definitely abides there
[1:07:14.680 --> 1:07:19.800]  in london probably you could argue the greatest power center of evil on the planet but he's on
[1:07:19.800 --> 1:07:26.520]  an island out of the atlantic off of the uk and david ike joins us for the next two hours i want
[1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:30.520]  to talk about the waterfront i've got a lot of questions i'll let david go wherever he wants
[1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:36.200]  i want to put the big picture the book uh china general milley uh madurn is saying oh you're
[1:07:36.200 --> 1:07:42.440]  twice as likely to get covid if you have our shots so take more shots the confirmation uh that
[1:07:42.440 --> 1:07:47.320]  millions are dying from the injection that it's causing the illness that uh clearly they've
[1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:53.080]  hit texas in florida with some type of simulant poison they've released they're calling a virus
[1:07:53.080 --> 1:07:58.520]  that's what former heads of u.s intelligence agencies agree is going on it wasn't real last year
[1:07:59.160 --> 1:08:05.240]  now they've launched something uh this year and people are not testing positive for the
[1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:10.520]  covid on the fake pcr test but they're getting the same type of symptoms so to decode all this
[1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:16.680]  from his deep research and how to push back is david ike of david ike dot com david great to
[1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:22.040]  have you here with us and congratulations on another great book thanks mate well i threw out a
[1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:26.920]  lot of stuff there we don't do pre interviews uh where do you want to start going down the rabbit
[1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:37.480]  hole today well i think we've we've got two um very clear stages of this uh the punch line is the
[1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:47.960]  fake vaccine but they had to have a reason to impose the fake vaccine and you know i differ from
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:56.360]  much of the uh alternative media in that i think that uh all this stuff about uh a virus being
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:09:05.480]  released from the wuhan lab is a massive diversion um there is no evidence that there is a virus um
[1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:13.320]  if you look at uh the the foundations of it all um and the uh the creation of the illusion of it
[1:09:14.600 --> 1:09:22.840]  allowed a number of things to happen and they happened because they don't have an infectious
[1:09:22.840 --> 1:09:28.120]  agent they do now it's called the fake vaccine but i'm talking about before that rolled out
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:40.280]  uh first of all um you need um the illusion of cases so you have the uh rt pcr test which
[1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:48.120]  um is well documented now is not um testing for a virus and an infectious disease but you
[1:09:48.120 --> 1:10:00.120]  say it is uh with no supporting evidence whatsoever um you have um the fda admitting that the uh pcr
[1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:07.560]  test protocols that it uh gave permission for use uh for their use uh did not come from a
[1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:15.240]  natural virus but came from a synthetic mock-up which is what this virus is you know people are
[1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:21.160]  saying alex you know uh they've looked at this code and they say well this is definitely man-made
[1:10:21.160 --> 1:10:28.280]  it is man-made it's a computer program and therefore that's why it looks man-made the code
[1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:36.440]  the code not the virus and then you have this ludicrous 28 days system where if you test positive
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:42.040]  with a test not testing for the virus and die of any other cause you you've died of the the virus
[1:10:42.040 --> 1:10:49.160]  covid 19 then uh you know you you you ask okay if you've got a real infectious agent why do you need
[1:10:49.160 --> 1:10:56.680]  that subtefuge and it goes further we've done an enormous amount of research now into the creation
[1:10:57.240 --> 1:11:04.920]  of the covid first wave in the united kingdom and it was the mass murder of old people through a drug
[1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:12.040]  a sedative end-of-life drug called medazolam medazolam is actually used as part in some
[1:11:12.040 --> 1:11:20.760]  us states of the execution process and the um psychopathic um health secretary in britain
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:30.200]  who uh more recently has um been replaced called uh matt hancock he ordered years of supply of
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:38.760]  of medazolam in the spring of 2020 at the same time they were moving uh thousands and thousands
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:44.840]  and thousands of old people just as they did in places like new york and and other states um
[1:11:44.840 --> 1:11:49.240]  out of the hospitals because they said oh this great wave of covid's coming we've got to clear the
[1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:57.000]  beds and they moved um these old people into the care homes and the first wave if you look at the
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:05.960]  numbers in britain were old people in care homes because they were not only did they um order
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:12.840]  and secure this massive supply of this drug medazolam um much of it from france
[1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:21.880]  they then and the the data is there to show that very clearly they then used it on old people
[1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:30.840]  in unprecedented amounts and at the same time they were issuing not only to the elderly but
[1:12:30.840 --> 1:12:38.040]  to uh in care homes but to um people with disabilities pure nazism they issued do not
[1:12:38.040 --> 1:12:43.400]  resuscitate orders so any one of these resuscitation was not going to get it so david what you're
[1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:49.400]  really saying is this was public euthanasia going on same thing here in in all the democrat states
[1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:54.280]  they would uh block families from coming to see old people they would put them on drugs and innovate
[1:12:54.280 --> 1:12:58.920]  them and kill them that's why it was only certain hospitals in old folks homes where the majority
[1:12:58.920 --> 1:13:03.640]  of deaths happened they'd be right next door to one run by good people nobody would die because
[1:13:03.640 --> 1:13:10.840]  this was an active test at depopulation totally sick exactly and you know you talk about euthanasia
[1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:18.040]  there was an exchange um it was a kind of zoom exchange because the uh the houses of parliament
[1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:24.440]  weren't open at the time between a uh uh member of parliament who's a doctor and this matt hancock
[1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:32.760]  and uh the member of parliament uh the doctor asked hancock if he had enough drugs to give
[1:13:32.760 --> 1:13:38.360]  people a good death this is in the same period that all this medazolan was being ordered now
[1:13:38.360 --> 1:13:46.200]  a good death is a direct translation of the word euthanasia and that's exactly what happened
[1:13:46.200 --> 1:13:50.040]  and so enormous numbers of old people died they were murdered i mean i've seen
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:14:01.880]  unrefutable evidence uh documented evidence of um levels of um doses of medazolan that
[1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:09.160]  would kill a bloody elephant and and then in america you've had this uh remdesivir scandal
[1:14:09.160 --> 1:14:17.640]  this this drug that's um given so many people um respiratory problems in fact just before
[1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:23.320]  i finish on medazolan one of the things about medazolan and it's all in the literature the
[1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:31.160]  official literature is that it causes respiratory distress respiratory problems particularly in
[1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:36.120]  old people so they say you know you should be very careful about giving medazolan to old people
[1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:40.360]  because of the respiratory distress and and malfunction absolutely so you got people that
[1:14:40.360 --> 1:14:45.000]  you put on this drug and they can't breathe they die you say it's covered use a fake PCR test turned
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:48.840]  up to 40 to say they had covered when you just euthanized somebody and murdered them then you
[1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:54.280]  pay the hospital the same all around the world the equivalent of $53,000 for the murder and now
[1:14:54.280 --> 1:14:59.000]  you've corrupted the health care system and you control them with your future attacks so whether
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:04.760]  when when you put all this together the the tests giving you the cases that's not testing for the
[1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:11.320]  virus the fake death certificates from a test not testing for the virus this mass murder of old
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:18.040]  people and not only old people in terms of remdesivir in america um which um causes um
[1:15:18.760 --> 1:15:27.720]  organ malfunction particularly the kidneys which um makes uh uh uh fluid um uh uh increase in the uh
[1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:30.360]  the uh David stay there you're gonna you're gonna have the floor when we come back you're
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:36.600]  absolutely right uh it massively 56 increase in deaths of somebody takes remdesivir makes the
[1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:42.520]  kidneys fail doesn't help you with uh what they said was covid and so it's the same thing they
[1:15:42.520 --> 1:15:48.040]  use these drugs they make money while they murder you and funny Fauci goes to depopulation conferences
[1:15:48.040 --> 1:15:52.440]  with bill gates and admits he wants that so a guy that says he wants to kill you is trying to kill

[1:18:02.120 --> 1:18:08.120]  they are discovering the globalist the elites the manipulation the cfr the trilateral commission
[1:18:08.120 --> 1:18:15.080]  the fielderberg group the bohemian grove the club of rome and so even though it seems like the
[1:18:15.080 --> 1:18:21.400]  globalist are winning the truth is they've had to come out the open to attack human freedom
[1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:28.120]  because they're actually losing we have forced them out in the open so as bad as these times are
[1:18:28.120 --> 1:18:33.000]  and a lot of negative things are about to happen realize humanity is winning you've got a trust
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:40.360]  in the plan of god and trust in the plan of god's justice that is invincible that is ethereal
[1:18:40.360 --> 1:18:46.280]  timeless and unstoppable so don't trust in man trust in god to lead god and director sold and
[1:18:46.280 --> 1:18:50.840]  then take action against the globalist and realize you've got my commitment from alex jones and my
[1:18:50.840 --> 1:18:58.280]  crew to you we will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender general lee
[1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:03.960]  it's general milley i just want you to know that trump tried to overthrow the u.s government
[1:19:03.960 --> 1:19:09.080]  two days ago on january six and i just want you to know i've taken control of the nuclear weapons
[1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:13.160]  and if trump tries to launch an attack on you we'll let you know first the attack's coming
[1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:20.440]  that is from the transcript then he called up palosin schumer and others to say i'm loyal to
[1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:24.840]  you i'm gonna protect trump from using nuclear weapons when trump was going for detente with
[1:19:24.840 --> 1:19:29.320]  china and north korea at the time and trump's responded saying it's a total lie palosin's
[1:19:29.320 --> 1:19:33.960]  come out and vetted it happened hell she bragged back on january eight that took place then and
[1:19:33.960 --> 1:19:38.520]  is saying that she honors milley and that he's this courageous person so are all these other
[1:19:38.520 --> 1:19:43.640]  democrats so this is the permanent deep state coup that's been in control for a long time now
[1:19:43.640 --> 1:19:48.680]  coming out of the shadows publicly remember these people literally hate you and your family
[1:19:48.680 --> 1:19:55.480]  now they're injecting you with poison soft kill injections wake up america or be destroyed
[1:19:58.840 --> 1:20:01.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:12.680 --> 1:20:16.520]  welcome back to this thursday september 16th edition of the alex jones show
[1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:24.680]  the iconic david icke of david icke.com is our guest until two o'clock today and we'll go into the
[1:20:24.680 --> 1:20:29.000]  fourth hour after he leaves us with a lot of news and information and other special guest
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:33.560]  host ahead of the war room three p under they were the one shroyer and david i love the fact
[1:20:33.560 --> 1:20:37.960]  when i get you on that you always go in a different direction and then then what you'd covered
[1:20:37.960 --> 1:20:44.360]  previously that's a whole nother area of you saying 19 months ago the pcr test is fake we now
[1:20:44.360 --> 1:20:49.800]  know 100% they withdrawn admitted it was a fraud and then there's the drugs they use and the drugs
[1:20:49.800 --> 1:20:55.720]  they withhold and as you pointed out this drug that's beyond giving somebody morphine at hospice
[1:20:55.720 --> 1:21:00.600]  to kill them this is something that makes old folks where they can't breathe hey kick the families
[1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:06.360]  out so they can't see what's going on and then murder them and then it was globalist controlled
[1:21:06.360 --> 1:21:11.320]  areas where this happened i noticed in the bible belt in very christian areas where the nurses wouldn't
[1:21:11.320 --> 1:21:18.680]  do this almost no deaths but in the key leftist areas mass deaths sometimes 20% of nursing homes
[1:21:18.680 --> 1:21:24.360]  on the east coast of the u.s and i noticed in the uk were being killed this is incredible
[1:21:24.360 --> 1:21:31.400]  so you were talking about rendezavir that falchi was pushing yeah i mean uh falchi was saying this
[1:21:31.400 --> 1:21:39.400]  has to be the the protocol used um in hospitals for anyone that uh tests positive for covid with
[1:21:39.400 --> 1:21:47.640]  a test not testing for it i mean you'll see if you go into hospital and um you're accepted uh to have
[1:21:47.640 --> 1:21:53.480]  regular pneumonia uh in other words you don't test positive with a test not testing for the virus
[1:21:53.480 --> 1:21:58.680]  then you go on a certain protocol but if you test positive you go on another protocol which almost
[1:21:58.680 --> 1:22:07.080]  certainly uh leads you into uh it into uh the ventilator uh period and and people are being
[1:22:07.080 --> 1:22:15.080]  murdered by these protocols and the point uh that i um i would make is that if you have in that
[1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:22.360]  first period before the fake uh vaccine started getting rolled out a genuine infectious deadly
[1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:27.800]  agent you don't need to use a test not testing for it to scan the tests you don't need to scan
[1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:33.240]  the death certificates you don't need to kill vast numbers of people with medazolam and rendezavir
[1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:39.560]  and call it the first wave and you don't need to give hospitals massive financial incentives
[1:22:39.560 --> 1:22:48.520]  to take a set of symptoms and uh and say it's covid 19 but then what changed was that that scam
[1:22:49.400 --> 1:22:57.160]  was used to justify the fake vaccines and once they started now we're having genuine health
[1:22:57.160 --> 1:23:04.120]  uh problems genuine uh life uh threatening uh situation and now they don't need the fake
[1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:08.920]  PCR tests and other things so so let me tell you what's happened to here and i want your
[1:23:08.920 --> 1:23:14.360]  view on this i looked at the statistics gunshot wounds cancer heart attacks the flu people with
[1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:20.600]  three or four uh comorbidities it was a made up lie and i talked to a lot of people that are high
[1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:25.560]  up u.s. intelligence they agree that in italy in china and in the east coast they sprayed some type
[1:23:25.560 --> 1:23:30.120]  of simulant poison out that makes people where they can't breathe because you'd have a whole
[1:23:30.120 --> 1:23:35.080]  group of people in a restaurant get up with nobody else in their family that was then now i've had
[1:23:35.080 --> 1:23:39.240]  scientists on medical doctors they agree it's sloughing something but they admit and it's in
[1:23:39.240 --> 1:23:44.840]  the mainline science what you said 18 90 months ago that it's a digital code completely synthetic
[1:23:45.880 --> 1:23:51.880]  toxic spike protein a synthetic hiv spike protein that they're spraying or they're putting out
[1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:55.720]  somehow but then people that have taken the vaccine they admit it generates it this is a
[1:23:55.720 --> 1:24:01.800]  debated and then it infects others so so it almost killed my dad hurt my mother almost killed some
[1:24:01.800 --> 1:24:06.280]  of the crew i mean tough people that ride you know 20 miles on a bike every day and it and i mean
[1:24:06.280 --> 1:24:10.840]  it almost killed them so that all just happened the last three months it's been hell and it only
[1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:15.480]  hit texas and florida and now they're hitting missouri and it's what's only hitting very localized
[1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:19.320]  areas and i talked to the former head of a major u.s. intelligence agency months ago and i talked to
[1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:23.800]  medical doctors they've talked to him as well and they said david what you're saying is that
[1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:29.080]  they think it's being synthetically sprayed somehow at target populations go ahead i'm ranting
[1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:37.000]  well um it's all been synthetic from the start it's all been a computer program mock-up i mean
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:42.600]  you've got christian drosten this deeply corrupt psychopath out of germany who laughingly calls
[1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:50.920]  himself a virologist who was the one that came up right on cue in january 2020 with the protocol
[1:24:50.920 --> 1:25:01.880]  for the pcr test for so-called sars cob 2 it was not peer reviewed in 24 hours or not much more
[1:25:01.880 --> 1:25:06.600]  it was being recommended by the world health organization right across the world that this
[1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:13.320]  is the protocol that should be used and they have admitted just like the the fda in america
[1:25:13.320 --> 1:25:20.040]  that the um version of the quote virus that they use for that protocol was a synthetic mock-up it
[1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:27.960]  was not a natural virus no one's come up with a natural virus nobody um and so what we um what
[1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:39.560]  we have now is this whole spike protein um story um when you mock up the fake virus you um introduce
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:46.040]  the idea that it contains a spike protein and these are these uh spikes sticking up from the
[1:25:46.040 --> 1:25:51.240]  little ball that you see as the on the the covid images all of which are computer generated by the
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:26:00.600]  way um and you introduce that because you want the spike protein in the fake vaccine to do all
[1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:06.840]  the damage to the body uh and so you say actually because there's a spike protein in the in the
[1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:14.440]  virus and that's causing this that and the other we have put this um uh mrna synthetic material
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:23.240]  together to uh get the body to produce this um spike protein to uh basically um trigger the
[1:26:23.240 --> 1:26:30.440]  immune system to resist the spike protein it's a scam there was not a spike protein in a virus
[1:26:30.440 --> 1:26:36.920]  the spike protein is in the vaccine justified by the claim that it's in the virus and by the way
[1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:42.680]  david you'll have the four next segment but you said that almost you know a year and six seven
[1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:48.360]  months ago you've been dead on but obviously you know explain the listeners it's now admitted that
[1:26:48.360 --> 1:26:52.360]  the so-called vaccine creates the spike protein that's poisonous and causes cancer and does all
[1:26:52.360 --> 1:26:57.080]  this and you slough it and you shed it so in plain view they are giving people this and then
[1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:01.080]  they're infecting others and then people that take the vaccine on average get twice as ill as
[1:27:01.080 --> 1:27:06.200]  everybody else and they turn around and then blame us the uninjected for making them sick incredible
[1:27:06.200 --> 1:27:12.600]  yeah but but of course the opposite is the case what what's what this is the situation um i would
[1:27:12.600 --> 1:27:25.800]  suggest um they have injected this um synthetic genetic material um and its messenger RNA it impacts
[1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:34.120]  upon the messaging of the body and the body is healthy or not healthy depending on the nature
[1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:40.680]  of the messaging uh communications around the body from the brain to the the cells and the cells
[1:27:40.680 --> 1:27:49.320]  to the brain etc etc so if you have a computer and the messaging system in it is working then your
[1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:56.120]  computer is fine and healthy and does what you want it to do once that messaging say with a
[1:27:56.120 --> 1:28:02.680]  what they call a computer virus that messaging is disturbed then the the function of the computer
[1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:07.720]  is disturbed and you start bashing the keys and bashing the the mouse and nothing's happening
[1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:13.880]  because the computer's been taken over by something else now once you start messing
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:22.280]  with the messaging communication system of the body that means that however that manifest itself
[1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:29.240]  is going to create a dis ease a dish harmony what we call an illness or an health condition
[1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:37.240]  and therefore these fake vaccines have the potential and and we're seeing it in in uh the
[1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:45.400]  veirs and yellow uh card reporting systems which are a fraction of the real story that um enormous
[1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:50.920]  range of different health problems are manifesting as a result of people who've had this fake stay
[1:28:50.920 --> 1:28:56.200]  there you're absolutely right you predicted it has come true stay with us so many people say to me
[1:28:56.200 --> 1:29:02.600]  alex please stop being so negative well for me admitting i've gotten a rotten tooth and going
[1:29:02.600 --> 1:29:08.440]  in a root canal is not negative it hurts it stinks it's got pus coming out of it i go to
[1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:13.800]  the doctor they fix it that's not negative i'm not living in denial and so think of globalism
[1:29:13.800 --> 1:29:18.760]  as being hidden as an infection that we didn't feel yet but now it's come to the surface that's
[1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:24.120]  actually a positive thing and so yeah trump did an overall great job they stole the election
[1:29:24.120 --> 1:29:31.320]  we can't get down about that we have forced them out in the open so now they're trying to suppress
[1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:35.880]  us because they know they've been exposed they're scared that's why instead of saying oh we're a
[1:29:35.880 --> 1:29:39.960]  bunch of losers look what happened no we're a bunch of winners they're trying to suppress us
[1:29:39.960 --> 1:29:45.720]  let our light of proof shine and tell everybody what's happening your own website your own show
[1:29:45.720 --> 1:29:50.920]  my show other articles other videos just keep sharing however you can and realize we're an
[1:29:50.920 --> 1:29:57.240]  information war we're going to win this together and the fight starts temple wars dot com globalist
[1:29:57.240 --> 1:30:03.640]  general milley has revealed to the world that the united states is not a free republic but it's
[1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:09.400]  run by a permanent stay behind network bureaucracy the big takeaway here is is that he didn't act
[1:30:09.400 --> 1:30:15.560]  alone he felt that he was safe to talk on an overseas phone line system that he knew was being
[1:30:15.560 --> 1:30:21.000]  watched by the star government the five eyes the russians and the chinese he wanted the world to
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:26.120]  know that he was proud of what he was doing because he was backed by the deep state this permanent
[1:30:26.120 --> 1:30:31.480]  bureaucracy sees america as its enemy it sees the american people as its enemy it sees prosperity
[1:30:32.040 --> 1:30:37.080]  as its enemy and it conspired with the communist chinese to threaten them basically and say
[1:30:37.080 --> 1:30:43.080]  trump may nuke you but if he tries we'll call and say we're attacking you so you can respond first
[1:30:43.080 --> 1:30:48.440]  that's beyond treason but it shows the type of anti-american sycophants living in their own feted
[1:30:48.440 --> 1:30:54.040]  bubble they try to get away with this milley and all of his accomplices you go to prison now for life

[1:33:17.960 --> 1:33:20.600]  all right well david ike sir with us on the alex jones show
[1:33:20.600 --> 1:33:25.400]  show i know later this is cut up but in the podcast is shared across the internet people say
[1:33:25.400 --> 1:33:29.000]  why are you going to break why are you interrupting him well we're still on 200 plus radio stations
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:33.880]  and a bunch of tv stations that's why when they tried to kick us off the internet we're still big
[1:33:33.880 --> 1:33:37.560]  and then you the listeners come get the clips and share them and help us get out the folks
[1:33:38.360 --> 1:33:42.440]  and and and that's why we're still on air is thanks to the radio and tv stations so be sure
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:47.320]  and support those if you're listening to them and spread the word okay david you got caught
[1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:54.280]  up by the break to recap the process of give people a bunch of drugs use fake pcr test kill
[1:33:54.280 --> 1:33:59.560]  people which they admittedly did hype up everybody else that died in skydiving accidents boating
[1:33:59.560 --> 1:34:04.840]  accidents cancer you name it they admittedly did that lock up old people in nursing homes
[1:34:04.840 --> 1:34:09.240]  don't let their family see them put them on ventilators kill them nine out of ten people
[1:34:09.240 --> 1:34:14.120]  that were put on them died move forward with that test your control of the medical system
[1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:20.120]  implement your mass censorship then roll out your so-called vaccine that erases the immune system
[1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:24.520]  what you said again on this show 19 months ago is now admitted we can play all the clips
[1:34:24.520 --> 1:34:29.320]  of even the head of the british government's own main bio weapon lab saying oh you're going to have
[1:34:29.320 --> 1:34:33.960]  to need more Pfizer modern shots for life because they get rid of your immune system they turn off
[1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:40.040]  your killer t-cells so so absolutely that's what's going on and now they've got the graphs
[1:34:40.040 --> 1:34:45.800]  of the more vaccinated country is the more sick and dying they are whether you're looking at europe
[1:34:45.800 --> 1:34:49.640]  whether you're looking at israel or whether you're looking at singapore i mean this is just an
[1:34:49.640 --> 1:34:58.040]  exercise in madness so please continue yeah and what is it going to say is because of the again
[1:34:58.040 --> 1:35:03.080]  this material self replicating so its impact gathers on the on the body with the with the
[1:35:03.080 --> 1:35:10.440]  passage of time and it means that a lot of people are going to be dying a lot of people are going
[1:35:10.440 --> 1:35:17.160]  to be very ill and they need to cover that as much as they can to hide the fact that the vaccines
[1:35:17.160 --> 1:35:21.960]  causing it the fake vaccines causing it so what they're saying at the moment for instance is
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:29.320]  where they admit it is a high percentage of people who are quote fully vaccinated
[1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:33.320]  which is a movable feast as they come in with the next one the next one the next one you'll
[1:35:33.320 --> 1:35:40.520]  have to have them to be fully vaccinated they are saying that they're they're going into a hospital
[1:35:40.520 --> 1:35:46.200]  and into infection with a covid so-called breakthrough infections as they call them
[1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:51.720]  but they're actually what they're calling covid again is the effect of the fake vaccine that's
[1:35:51.720 --> 1:35:57.880]  why they're in hospital that's why they're getting ill because of that with neurological problems
[1:35:57.880 --> 1:36:03.240]  heart problems and many many many other problems because of the messaging system as I say being
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:09.080]  totally distorted and disrupted it can manifest as endless different health situations they've
[1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:12.760]  got to hide that so they're going to hide it by saying it's covid they're going to hide it by
[1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:20.040]  saying we've got more virulent variants that are more deadly and and they're going to say maybe that
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:25.320]  you know the flu's come back or whatever they're going to have to hide this and we need to hold
[1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:33.480]  in our minds this thought it's the fake vaccines that are causing this and because the whole
[1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:41.000]  agenda is nothing to do with health but to do with a mass depopulation and for those who survive
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:47.400]  genetic transformation to a different kind of human it's a more synthetic human they have to
[1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:54.440]  get to every man woman and child on the planet because that's their agenda to do that and so
[1:36:54.440 --> 1:37:00.920]  what we're seeing now and my god if this doesn't wake people up what will they're now going for
[1:37:00.920 --> 1:37:07.480]  the kids we've had a situation this very week lots of things have happened in regard to this in
[1:37:07.480 --> 1:37:17.480]  britain this week and they for the first time the british government got from its vaccine advisory
[1:37:17.480 --> 1:37:23.800]  committee the wrong advice from its point of view because this advisory committee has gone with the
[1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:31.000]  agenda all the way through this time it said well we can't really justify giving these
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:37.800]  vaccines fake vaccines as i would call them to a healthy 12 to 15 year olds so now a you know
[1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:44.680]  panic time so what the british government has done has said well okay right well what we're
[1:37:44.680 --> 1:37:49.160]  going to do we've taken your advice all the way through this covid era of course you've been
[1:37:49.160 --> 1:37:54.360]  giving it the advice we wanted now you're not what we're going to do is we're going to give the
[1:37:54.360 --> 1:38:02.840]  decision to a utter psychopath a deeply dark and sinister man called chris witty the the
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:08.680]  chief medical officer of england to not look at the health situation well whether we should give
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:14.760]  them to 12 and 15 year olds but whether there are other non health reasons to do it and he came up
[1:38:14.760 --> 1:38:20.200]  with the most predictable decision in human history this week and said oh yeah well to help with
[1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:25.080]  their education and stop their education being disrupted they should have it and now i'm i'm
[1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:33.800]  seeing feiser talking about having a vaccine looking for approval this winter for babies
[1:38:33.800 --> 1:38:46.840]  and what you're seeing is this whole um uh script this whole plan to uh to infuse with this deadly
[1:38:46.840 --> 1:38:53.240]  and genetically transforming synthetic material every man woman and child on the planet and we
[1:38:53.240 --> 1:39:00.840]  we have to reach a point now if not now when when people start to grow a pair and grow a backbone
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:06.040]  those that haven't already lots of people are are pushing back on this but there's fast vast numbers
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:13.560]  that are not and realize that this is not a game it's not a phase it's not something that's going
[1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:21.720]  to go away eventually this is the cult um running for home and we've got to now stand up to this and
[1:39:21.720 --> 1:39:28.360]  say here and no further and start rolling it back and the first thing we can do is to stop our kids
[1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:36.680]  being um infused with this material uh designed to do anything but uh protect their health by these
[1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:43.000]  psychopaths if if we're not going to stand up and protect the kids then what's the point what
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:49.320]  self-respect is left what dignity is left if you're not going to stand up and protect your
[1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:54.360]  kids from these psychopaths and david i totally agree with you to infinity as a father and your
[1:39:54.360 --> 1:40:00.040]  father as well i feel an urge to stop them i know they want violence because that ends debate it's
[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:04.520]  the truth is getting action out but i mean civil disobedience whatever you got to do to get on
[1:40:04.520 --> 1:40:10.600]  tv radio whatever you got to do folks this is war they admit i've got the top i've played the clips
[1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:15.080]  even from the uk tv and and and canada in the us where they have the chief scientist of these
[1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:20.920]  companies saying this erases your immune system and turns off your white blood cells when you and
[1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:25.800]  and that you've taken three Pfizer shots they've already done test it lowers it to one sixth of
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:31.960]  what it was and they say they don't know if it ever turns back on they're gonna erase children's
[1:40:31.960 --> 1:40:36.280]  immune system and then the shot doesn't even protect them it actually makes them a factory
[1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:42.760]  this is Joseph Mengele level and they are salivating over the children that is their in game why is
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:51.880]  that david ike it absolutely is um uh Joseph Mengele and you know again here's another point uh
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:58.120]  they're now saying that uh you know the the the the younger younger and younger people now into
[1:40:58.120 --> 1:41:06.120]  teenagers going into 12 to 15 year olds in britain now and then to babies um they're saying uh all
[1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:13.320]  this covid it's starting to affect young people well why didn't affect them before well it didn't
[1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:21.240]  affect them before because there was nothing to affect them the people that died in the whole pre
[1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:32.760]  um fate vaccine era of covid were extremely old people in england uh you have um a average age
[1:41:32.760 --> 1:41:41.480]  expectancy of 80 for men and 83 for women the average age of covid quote covid deaths on the
[1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:52.600]  death certificate is um 82 83 and when you are old very old you have enormous other reasons to die
[1:41:52.600 --> 1:42:00.280]  what they call comorbidities so the potential for redesignation of diagnosis to covid 19
[1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:08.280]  is limitless that therefore all it's all the old people that are dying of covid not touching the
[1:42:08.280 --> 1:42:14.520]  young people why is it not touching the young people in that pre-fake vaccine era because
[1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:23.400]  young people don't tend to die of anything so the uh redesignation potential to covid 19
[1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:29.800]  is fractional compared with old people but once they start introducing the fake vaccines
[1:42:29.800 --> 1:42:37.000]  they're now infusing ill health and damaged bodies um into by the way david you're not just

[1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:16.680]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind i don't mean to keep interrupting
[1:47:16.680 --> 1:47:22.520]  david just to point out when he says something that he said it 20 years ago or two years ago i mean
[1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:28.840]  he really did i remember david on my show i've been interviewing him for at least 18 years
[1:47:28.840 --> 1:47:33.160]  i've been lucky enough to have him on probably 20 he's been on probably 22 years i forget it took
[1:47:33.160 --> 1:47:38.120]  me a few years to get him on i've been on there 27 years now and i remember him always saying they
[1:47:38.120 --> 1:47:42.840]  want to make a synthetic they want to take over our bodies they want to take over our genes that's
[1:47:42.840 --> 1:47:49.800]  their plans uh that's what they're doing and and now everything he said is coming out of the mouth
[1:47:49.800 --> 1:47:56.280]  of claus schwaab and mill gates and ted turner but they're saying it's positive so it's everything
[1:47:56.280 --> 1:48:01.320]  david says but that it's good you'll own nothing you'll have nothing we'll take over your bodies
[1:48:01.320 --> 1:48:05.000]  we're gonna get rid of people you're gonna love it we'll give you a good death it'll feel good
[1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:10.200]  and and it's just wild so so let's continue with now we're up to where we are now you've given the
[1:48:10.200 --> 1:48:15.720]  backstory and i want to go where they're gonna take us unless we say no and now is the time to
[1:48:15.720 --> 1:48:20.680]  stand up because now they're not just coming for our children they're they're targeting and france
[1:48:20.680 --> 1:48:25.640]  is injecting people even under 12 without parental consent canada has announced the same thing so
[1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:30.120]  has germany australia is just doing it i see the little newscast well it's for your own good yeah
[1:48:30.120 --> 1:48:35.240]  we gave all the five-year-olds the shot so and the kids some are dying and they just cover it up so
[1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:40.440]  it's really all the big exercise in bullying people and covering up that they're killing us
[1:48:40.440 --> 1:48:45.080]  i had a even stronger bio weapons and chemical weapons that they want to release in the future
[1:48:45.080 --> 1:48:49.960]  this is all the preparatory phase for forced depopulation and i think people are gonna start
[1:48:49.960 --> 1:48:54.600]  waking up that i already see a global awakening happening uh so so so please continue david
[1:48:56.120 --> 1:49:03.480]  well you know some of us have been pointing out for a long time that the control of the world is
[1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:13.400]  centralized uh that uh there are networks of the global network in each country and their job
[1:49:13.400 --> 1:49:20.200]  is to impose the will of the center of the network the spider as i call it on their particular country
[1:49:20.840 --> 1:49:27.560]  and you know as i've traveled around the world uh constantly before the covid era i've been seeing
[1:49:27.560 --> 1:49:33.960]  the same things being introduced in different countries different cultures basically in the
[1:49:33.960 --> 1:49:39.960]  same period and some of the legislation even being worded the same it's because it's centrally controlled
[1:49:39.960 --> 1:49:47.560]  and the covid era has made that so blatantly obvious if you just take the example you brought
[1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:54.200]  up and i mentioned a few minutes ago and that's uh or i mentioned many times before and that's
[1:49:54.200 --> 1:50:03.400]  the parental consent um what has also happened um in um this week in uh in britain is it was
[1:50:03.400 --> 1:50:13.160]  it was announced that uh as well as um introducing uh these fake vaccines to healthy 12 to 15 year
[1:50:13.160 --> 1:50:21.320]  olds that age group will also be uh allowed to make the decision about whether to have the fake
[1:50:21.320 --> 1:50:29.080]  vaccine or not if there it's an odds with the parental opinion so um they're saying well if if
[1:50:29.080 --> 1:50:35.880]  if the the the child wants the fake vaccine and the parent doesn't want them to have it well what
[1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:40.840]  we'll do is we'll get them together and we'll try to have a bit of mediation this is supposed to be
[1:50:40.840 --> 1:50:46.520]  the family which is the state and they also want to lower the age of sexual consent they want to
[1:50:46.520 --> 1:50:50.840]  lower it for abortion california has already done it so what they're doing is having the state come
[1:50:50.840 --> 1:50:55.400]  in and get the middle of your family which is really the main target they've said and now they
[1:50:55.400 --> 1:51:00.440]  want to have contact tracers just like australia to come into your houses to take people away to
[1:51:00.440 --> 1:51:05.640]  quote protect them and shield them before they get covered and the cdc is developing that plan
[1:51:05.640 --> 1:51:11.400]  for the us that's really their in game yeah so so what you've got in this one instance alone
[1:51:12.040 --> 1:51:17.640]  is the blatantly obvious proof well i mean the the the global lockdown response is another
[1:51:17.640 --> 1:51:25.960]  uh but with this uh uh going beyond parental consent it's centrally dictated globally uh
[1:51:25.960 --> 1:51:33.080]  and and so uh i know uh someone uh quite locally here and they were asked are you
[1:51:33.080 --> 1:51:40.360]  going to let your 12 year old uh son um have this vaccine and they replied um i'll leave it up to him
[1:51:40.360 --> 1:51:48.600]  i mean this is a parent um and and the reason is we're coming back to this they because of their
[1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:57.000]  agenda their end game their next stage of all this they have to get this uh material this synthetic
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:05.080]  genetic material into everybody so all the checks and balances are being taken off to allow that to
[1:52:05.080 --> 1:52:10.920]  happen so you go back to the lack of trials the lack of the trials still going on or to forget
[1:52:10.920 --> 1:52:15.720]  all that we need to get this into people quick oh well the parents might stop their children
[1:52:15.720 --> 1:52:21.480]  having it all right well we'll we'll stop parental consent then all these things have been taken off
[1:52:21.480 --> 1:52:28.440]  to create this um this mass uh um infusion of this material and the globalists are pulling back to
[1:52:28.440 --> 1:52:33.400]  private islands and mountaintops and admitting they're trying to make us angry what are they pushing
[1:52:33.400 --> 1:52:41.560]  for where do they want to take us well they want to divide and rule us because this is
[1:52:41.560 --> 1:52:48.120]  it's a simple case of mathematics if you go to the core of the core of the core of this global
[1:52:48.120 --> 1:52:56.120]  cult you get them into a single room and the vast majority of people that are imposing
[1:52:56.120 --> 1:53:05.160]  this fascism on the world um have no idea it's being coordinated they're just doing what they're
[1:53:05.160 --> 1:53:13.080]  told without question i mean look at the doctors and the nurses all over the world that are carrying
[1:53:13.080 --> 1:53:23.400]  out mengler type um operations um and believing somehow that it's it's justified it's mass murder
[1:53:23.400 --> 1:53:31.000]  ladies and gentlemen you are psychopaths when you take part in this and so um you can um you
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  can look at the the way and this is the answer really you can look at the way that this few
[1:53:37.800 --> 1:53:43.480]  ultimately one room can impose its will on the entirety of the population and david you said
[1:53:43.480 --> 1:53:49.160]  this on my show 20s plus years ago but now they were denying bill berber group existed in claus
[1:53:49.160 --> 1:53:53.880]  squab ran it now he runs the devils group let's explain to people now it's out in the open this is
[1:53:53.880 --> 1:53:59.400]  all un corporate directed they decide fauci speaks doesn't matter what the fda scientists say
[1:53:59.400 --> 1:54:03.640]  does it matter what your scientists in the uk say they've all said don't do this they just go
[1:54:03.640 --> 1:54:12.120]  forward and fauci's like the boss yeah the point is um there is an agenda there's an agenda i have
[1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:16.920]  this phrase know the outcome and you'll uh and you'll see the journey if you don't know what the
[1:54:16.920 --> 1:54:21.800]  outcome is planned to be which is why it's so important to get the outcome plan out there then
[1:54:21.800 --> 1:54:28.040]  everything seems to be random seems to be reactory oh well well they're reacting to a rising cases
[1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:33.000]  yeah well they're testing for the virus oh that's what they're doing oh now they're reacting to this
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:39.160]  and they're reacting to no no no no no they're not reacting to anything at the core at the fauci level
[1:54:39.160 --> 1:54:45.960]  and the gates level and the swab level they're following a script and it's very simple the script
[1:54:45.960 --> 1:54:53.720]  happens and anything that pushes back or gets in the way of the script is either targeted
[1:54:53.720 --> 1:55:01.560]  or ignored so when this committee in britain this vaccine advisory committee uh said well no no we
[1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:09.000]  can't support this fake vaccine for uh 12 to 15 year olds that was a problem for the for the script
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:17.160]  for the agenda so it was ignored and this is what why people like fauci say things and ignore logic
[1:55:17.160 --> 1:55:25.320]  scientific uh obviousness because they're following an agenda know the outcome and you'll see the journey
[1:55:25.320 --> 1:55:29.720]  and here's a great example david we have the surgeon general who works for george sorrelson
[1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:33.800]  record he brought him over here put him in college runs him they brag and you have fauci
[1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:39.560]  saying learned immunity is not good and everybody got on their case about it so he goes okay i'm not
[1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:44.600]  going to comment about natural immunity so so they said natural immunity is no good when we
[1:55:44.600 --> 1:55:48.680]  know it's the real thing i mean they're just out of the open assaulting reality
[1:55:50.600 --> 1:55:59.480]  ancini fauci is a mass murdering psychopath let's not beat about you know any bushes that's
[1:55:59.480 --> 1:56:06.840]  what he is on the remdesivir front alone never mind all the other uh death and destruction his uh
[1:56:07.640 --> 1:56:15.480]  policies have um have created and i say his policies he's a gopher he he is just a gopher
[1:56:15.480 --> 1:56:21.880]  for the script just as gates is a gopher for the script it's coming out of the real real uh
[1:56:21.880 --> 1:56:30.360]  shadows that's where it's being uh generated from and so um if people think that somehow this is
[1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:37.320]  going to write itself uh without any uh response and intervention well i'm afraid you know they they
[1:56:37.320 --> 1:56:44.040]  are they are dreaming this is an agenda that's unfolding and is meant to get far more extreme
[1:56:44.040 --> 1:56:49.960]  than it is now and we need to stop it now through non-cooperation and i was going to mention uh that
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:57.080]  the the the the sequence this very simple sequence that allows these few people to dictate to
[1:56:57.720 --> 1:57:04.120]  billions the best part of eight billion now and that is this sequence of imposition and acquiescence
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:09.960]  you've got the tiny few at the top of the pyramid uh the hierarchical pyramid of human society
[1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:14.120]  david this is the key stay there we got a whole another hour coming up we'll get into solutions
[1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:18.760]  you'll have the floor keep annihilating the enemy this is so powerful it's new book available at

[1:57:38.040 --> 1:57:42.840]  infowarstore.com and perceptions of renegade mind at davidike.com we'll be right back
[1:57:42.840 --> 1:57:51.560]  it's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[1:57:51.560 --> 1:57:55.480]  happening in the atmosphere but if you look at all the different studies and reports about
[1:57:55.480 --> 1:58:00.280]  my nasa and other governments and other agencies they all disagree on what's really happened with
[1:58:00.280 --> 1:58:08.440]  climate the only concept the only great truth is change is the only constant so yes climate change
[1:58:08.440 --> 1:58:13.400]  is totally real but notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s 80s and then
[1:58:13.400 --> 1:58:17.000]  it's going to be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to okay now
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:23.160]  it's just climate change but did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it
[1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:28.680]  comes to the united nations and the department of energy and bill gates and the un they have
[1:58:28.680 --> 1:58:34.840]  weather control trees for 1979 bill gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time in
[1:58:34.840 --> 1:58:39.560]  fact back in 1994 two scientists won a Nobel prize for an idea of spring different particles
[1:58:39.560 --> 1:58:43.560]  out of jet engines to control the weather so yes man-made climate change is real
[1:58:47.240 --> 1:58:53.160]  generally it's general milley i just want you to know that trump tried to overthrow the u.s
[1:58:53.160 --> 1:58:58.360]  government two days ago on january six and i just want you to know i've taken control of the nuclear
[1:58:58.360 --> 1:59:02.760]  weapons and if trump tries to launch an attack on you we'll let you know first the attack's coming
[1:59:02.760 --> 1:59:10.040]  okay that is from the transcript then he called uh pelosi schumer and others to say i'm loyal to
[1:59:10.040 --> 1:59:14.840]  you i'm going to protect trump from using nuclear weapons when trump was going for detente with china
[1:59:14.840 --> 1:59:19.400]  and north korea at the time and trumps responded saying it's a total lie pelosi's come out and
[1:59:19.400 --> 1:59:24.520]  admitted it happened hell she bragged back on january 8th that it took place then and is saying
[1:59:24.520 --> 1:59:29.080]  that she honors milley and that he's this courageous person so we're all these other democrats
[1:59:29.080 --> 1:59:33.640]  so this is the permanent deep state coup that's been in control for a long time now coming out
[1:59:33.640 --> 1:59:38.600]  of the shadows publicly remember these people literally hate you and your family now they're
[1:59:38.600 --> 1:59:43.800]  injecting you with poison soft kill injections wake up america or be destroyed
[1:59:43.800 --> 1:59:55.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:02.600 --> 2:00:07.160]  who would have ever thought we'd be inside a world government trying to force deadly shots on us
[2:00:07.160 --> 2:00:12.040]  that lower our immunity give us cancer and then infect others well david ike did he's been talking
[2:00:12.040 --> 2:00:17.240]  about forced inoculations in the world government for 30 years i've been talking about it 27 because
[2:00:17.240 --> 2:00:21.160]  it was in their own documents and some states don't carry this segment but david's told him to
[2:00:21.160 --> 2:00:25.080]  be here and that's great we appreciate it so he'll get into real solutions next segment but he wanted
[2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:30.200]  to play a clip because he knows we have it of a nicky minaj and just an example of the domino's
[2:00:30.200 --> 2:00:35.480]  following if humanity just wakes up and says i have a right to my speech and to my body here it is
[2:00:35.480 --> 2:00:41.800]  okay welcome to tucker carlson tonight who knew who could have guessed that rapper nicky minaj would turn
[2:00:41.800 --> 2:00:48.040]  out to be one of the bravest people in the united states a couple of days ago we we would guess most
[2:00:48.040 --> 2:00:53.160]  people watch this show may not have heard of nicky minaj and then she tweeted about the covet
[2:00:53.160 --> 2:00:59.480]  vaccine she didn't come out against the vaccines she merely said that as an adult and an american
[2:00:59.480 --> 2:01:05.160]  she should decide whether or not to take the vaccine pray about it she said don't be bullied
[2:01:07.080 --> 2:01:12.600]  things blew up from there no praying about it you must submit to being bullied those are the new
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:19.000]  rules nicky minaj wasn't aware of that and she resisted and she's still resistant it's a long
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:23.560]  and interesting story there's implications for all of us and trace galler has agreed tonight to frame
[2:01:23.560 --> 2:01:27.960]  it for us to set it up just tell us what's going on and here he is hey trace all right so
[2:01:27.960 --> 2:01:32.760]  tucker carlson woke up and he said this show helped wake him up nicky minaj is waking up
[2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:37.240]  so is it this really the light at the end of the tunnel people finally waking up
[2:01:37.240 --> 2:01:44.120]  and becoming human again this really scared the power structure david yeah i mean you know they
[2:01:44.120 --> 2:01:53.080]  don't censor with the hysteria that they do for a laugh and a bit of fun and they don't even do it
[2:01:53.080 --> 2:01:59.560]  to posture their own illusory power illusory power which is that which we give to them
[2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:08.600]  they do it because they've got no choice their narrative is ludicrous what they're asking us
[2:02:08.600 --> 2:02:16.200]  to believe and what they're asking us to do telling us to do is ludicrous it's nothing to do with
[2:02:16.200 --> 2:02:21.080]  health it's everything to do with control and that's becoming more obvious to more and more people
[2:02:21.080 --> 2:02:29.160]  all the time and therefore they have to protect their ludicrous narrative in the only way they can
[2:02:29.880 --> 2:02:38.360]  by preventing its exposure in the to the greatest audience that they can but it can't be stopped
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:47.720]  if people are willing not to bow to their illusory power and not to bow to their intimidation
[2:02:47.720 --> 2:02:56.360]  you know you get these celebrities oh god save us from celebrities who are pushing the agenda
[2:02:56.360 --> 2:03:01.480]  virtue signaling because they they know their careers are over if they don't they're the people
[2:03:01.480 --> 2:03:10.600]  that came out against nicky uh menage and um they uh if they say anything even mildly critical
[2:03:10.600 --> 2:03:16.840]  back comes the backlash all organized and there are their sackcloth and ashes all run terribly
[2:03:16.840 --> 2:03:24.120]  sorry i didn't mean it and what's great about nicky menage is she said up yours darling this is my
[2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:28.760]  right to have this view and if you don't like it well you can do the other thing and by the way
[2:03:28.760 --> 2:03:36.040]  i'm going to call you out like this moron joy reed at msnbc how she remembers to breathe every
[2:03:36.040 --> 2:03:42.760]  few seconds has been a constant mystery to me all the time seen her in action but she's called her out
[2:03:42.760 --> 2:03:49.960]  and she won't bow to it and that's fantastic and that's the power that you can have if you refuse
[2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:57.480]  to be intimidated and you refuse to be silenced just refuse to do it have some dignity have some
[2:03:57.480 --> 2:04:04.040]  self-respect that's right um or unlike joy reed is not going to shut me up uh nicky menage said
[2:04:04.040 --> 2:04:11.000]  and she won't be and and and that's a real example of where the power is if you're prepared to stand
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:18.040]  in it yourself david you're always on fire but you are in fuego in fuego today we're gonna come
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:22.520]  back in 60 seconds i've got that joy reclip if you ask for it we can play it uh but i want you to
[2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:27.960]  just i'm gonna try to just turn my mic off and let you get into the position they put us how they
[2:04:27.960 --> 2:04:32.600]  control us and how the dominos can fall so quickly if we just wake up and the fact you're doing all
[2:04:32.600 --> 2:04:37.240]  of this not out of strength but out of weakness because they've been doing this a long time they're
[2:04:37.240 --> 2:04:42.280]  really showing us how alien they are how anti-human they are now because they're losing their grip
[2:04:42.280 --> 2:04:46.600]  and they're afraid that we're about to discover who we really are and our connection to the universe
[2:04:46.600 --> 2:04:51.400]  david ike's our guest davidike.com his new book is out perceptions of a renegade mind get it at

[2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:43.960]  david ike is with us you find everything david ike at david ike.com we'll talk about his books
[2:06:43.960 --> 2:06:47.240]  i'm coming up later he'll never really talk about his books though they're excellent uh
[2:06:47.240 --> 2:06:53.080]  uh david we're getting into nikki menage the dominoes falling the the the mass awakening how
[2:06:53.080 --> 2:06:59.560]  they want to bully us why they're so hysterical how this anti human system is actually weak and
[2:06:59.560 --> 2:07:04.600]  is in a desperate situation right now as we end of the last hour you were beginning to get into
[2:07:04.600 --> 2:07:09.640]  this artificial relationship they create and how to be conscious of that and get out of it please
[2:07:09.640 --> 2:07:17.480]  give us the key solution well you know you can look for a solution or you can remove the cause of
[2:07:17.480 --> 2:07:22.920]  the problem and if you remove the cause of the problem the problem must disappear because its
[2:07:22.920 --> 2:07:30.040]  cause is gone and look through the entirety of no human history anyway and you see the same
[2:07:30.040 --> 2:07:39.240]  recurring sequence the few controlling the many by the many acquiescing to the few and if you look
[2:07:39.240 --> 2:07:46.680]  at as i was getting into uh earlier if you look at this symbolic or it's not even symbolic it's
[2:07:46.680 --> 2:07:54.760]  very accurate pyramidal hierarchy of human society you've got the tiny few at the top the inner core
[2:07:54.760 --> 2:08:02.040]  of this cult which um have this agenda uh for the constant centralization of power and the constant
[2:08:02.040 --> 2:08:09.080]  centralization of everything and the more you centralize power the more power the few have
[2:08:09.080 --> 2:08:14.520]  over the many at each point of centralization that's why things like globalization are all
[2:08:14.520 --> 2:08:23.240]  been generated by this cult so they impose their will their agenda on the level of the pyramid
[2:08:23.240 --> 2:08:32.120]  below them and that level acquiesces to that um imposition and imposes it on the level below them
[2:08:32.120 --> 2:08:39.320]  and so it goes on and it's very soon after you leave the peak of the pyramid that you are meeting
[2:08:39.320 --> 2:08:45.960]  levels of the hierarchy that have no idea there is a cult they have no idea there is a peak of the
[2:08:45.960 --> 2:08:54.040]  pyramid all they're doing is taking impositions from the levels above them and acquiescing to them
[2:08:54.040 --> 2:09:00.200]  and imposing them on the level below them and then you come all the way down this pyramid in
[2:09:00.840 --> 2:09:06.520]  imposition acquiescence imposition acquiescence and you meet the mass of the population at the
[2:09:06.520 --> 2:09:13.080]  bottom of the pyramid and if we at that point and this is the key this is the ancestor staring
[2:09:13.080 --> 2:09:20.920]  us in the bloody phase if we as a population then acquiesce to the impositions of the level
[2:09:20.920 --> 2:09:28.760]  of the pyramid ultimately being dictated to by the the single room at the top and we acquiesce
[2:09:28.760 --> 2:09:36.920]  to the impositions of government and authority and law enforcement cdc fda fauci all these people
[2:09:36.920 --> 2:09:46.520]  all if we acquiesce to them we create or complete a circuit a circuit between the tiny few at the
[2:09:46.520 --> 2:09:52.680]  top of the pyramid and the mass of the population and that circuit of imposition acquiescence
[2:09:52.680 --> 2:09:59.160]  imposition acquiescence means that those few people in that room have imposed their will
[2:09:59.160 --> 2:10:05.800]  on the entirety of the global population and my goodness have we seen that in the covid era so
[2:10:05.800 --> 2:10:16.280]  blatantly and so obviously so the answer is we break the circuit we break the circuit by not
[2:10:16.280 --> 2:10:24.920]  acquiescing with authority simply because it's authority what is it telling us to do what is
[2:10:24.920 --> 2:10:33.720]  it asking us to do does it make sense no then i'm not doing it is it designed to impose control on
[2:10:33.720 --> 2:10:41.800]  my life and my family's life yes no i'm not doing it then and and it's this reflex action
[2:10:43.080 --> 2:10:52.520]  response to authority of obeying that is the cause of the few controlling the many and it starts
[2:10:52.520 --> 2:11:00.120]  very early you get people young kids you put them into school at the earliest possible age
[2:11:00.120 --> 2:11:08.760]  age and from that moment on they are faced with an authority an authority which if you obey well
[2:11:09.640 --> 2:11:14.760]  life is kind of okay i mean you've not got a mind of your own but but you know they leave
[2:11:14.760 --> 2:11:21.800]  you alone but if you don't obey well there's a problem there's a problem with your a disruptive
[2:11:21.800 --> 2:11:26.520]  influence in the classroom you're asking questions you won't accept what you're being told and and
[2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:33.800]  very early on right at the start of the school life that you've got an authority figure who's
[2:11:33.800 --> 2:11:38.200]  telling you when you can when you have to be there when you can leave when you can eat when you can
[2:11:38.200 --> 2:11:44.440]  talk when you can go to the toilet and there are sanctions if you don't obey and so the whole
[2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:52.760]  process has started to get you into a state of reflex action acquiescence to authority which
[2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:57.640]  they want you to take through your life and let me just back you up briefly as i talked about this
[2:11:57.640 --> 2:12:01.240]  before you came on today this is on record for new listeners and viewers this is my opinion
[2:12:01.800 --> 2:12:07.160]  they found in vietnam that the marines and army would not kill somebody up close but at the troops
[2:12:07.160 --> 2:12:10.920]  wouldn't shoot somebody they could see the whites of their eyes they can make out their face
[2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:15.080]  they saw this other human they wouldn't kill and and the vietnamese were trained who they would
[2:12:16.120 --> 2:12:20.760]  so they invented shooter games where things would pop up of different images of paper then
[2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:25.160]  they came out with doom was first a pentagon game you know after vietnam but it was first
[2:12:25.160 --> 2:12:31.560]  like with projectors in inside buildings but then it became the video game to reflexively shoot
[2:12:31.560 --> 2:12:37.080]  show you wouldn't think and they got about 99 percent kill rates then people would start pulling
[2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:42.120]  the trigger but people would even subconsciously at 50 yards kind of miss people because they just
[2:12:42.120 --> 2:12:48.120]  didn't want to kill another human so it's a great example of the reflex reflex system they're trying
[2:12:48.120 --> 2:12:54.920]  to program into us on everything well yeah i mean the um the target the target is the human
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:13:05.400]  subconscious the subconscious uh the is responsible it's alleged in studies to be responsible for 95
[2:13:05.400 --> 2:13:13.320]  percent of human behavior and response and and if you can get to the subconscious you um can get
[2:13:13.320 --> 2:13:23.000]  people into reflex action mode so authority says something and i do it it's a reflex action it's
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:30.840]  not a conscious mind intervention that says i'm being asked to do this does it make sense and if
[2:13:30.840 --> 2:13:36.600]  it doesn't i'm not doing it it's dog training they're literally turning us into dogs well it's exactly
[2:13:36.600 --> 2:13:43.880]  that yeah and the the thing is that if they can get into your subconscious mind and they can put in
[2:13:43.880 --> 2:13:51.320]  subconscious um uh perceptions into your subconscious mind as they filter through to your
[2:13:51.320 --> 2:13:55.720]  conscious mind you think that you're having your thoughts and you're making your own decisions
[2:13:55.720 --> 2:14:02.680]  and you're having your own opinions i mean how many of us alex um around the world have um heard
[2:14:02.680 --> 2:14:09.640]  people who bought the covet hoax uh narrative who say i'll tell you i'll tell you what um what i think
[2:14:09.640 --> 2:14:15.000]  is going on this is my opinion and what comes out of their mouth is the official narrative
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:21.160]  virtually word for word it's safe they're still running ads saying the fizer shot is a safe and
[2:14:21.160 --> 2:14:27.240]  effective and will stop covet that is a damn lie even in their narrative it's 39 effective of course
[2:14:27.240 --> 2:14:34.760]  and it's a fraud on top of that but i mean my lord yeah and and that there's a lot of stuff going on
[2:14:35.640 --> 2:14:42.520]  to get into the subconscious mind a lot of subliminal stuff going on i did a video last week
[2:14:43.080 --> 2:14:50.520]  because i've come across what a few people now who are very anti having the fake facts um but
[2:14:50.520 --> 2:14:56.200]  i've had this experience of suddenly deciding they're going to get it i mean those that are
[2:14:56.200 --> 2:15:03.400]  really aware i've realized this is not coming from them it's external in some way and and and some i
[2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:07.080]  know i've actually had it and then wondered why the hell they did because they didn't want it
[2:15:07.720 --> 2:15:13.400]  and i there was one example of a guy who was saying he was watching an ad on television
[2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:20.520]  to you know promote the fake vaccine i mean they're endless and suddenly he had this feeling
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:25.320]  kind of overwhelming that i need to get this and then he kind of got his mind back and said well
[2:15:25.320 --> 2:15:32.840]  obviously i you know what what am i doing what am i thinking so we we hear voice to ear communication
[2:15:33.640 --> 2:15:40.040]  which is talking to the conscious mind okay that's one level of it but there's this subliminal stuff
[2:15:40.040 --> 2:15:44.840]  that is speaking to the subconscious i'd stay there again my friend go into break hard satellite
[2:15:44.840 --> 2:15:50.360]  breaks perceptions of a renegade mind david ike.com get the book get all those books we'll be right

[2:17:02.520 --> 2:17:08.760]  hear this year here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock these

[2:17:25.640 --> 2:17:30.680]  or just getting off the grid you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again

[2:17:56.280 --> 2:18:01.560]  when bob woodward's new book came out alleging that general milley had called the head of the
[2:18:01.560 --> 2:18:06.360]  chinese military and said trump might nuke you you tried to overthrow the u.s government but
[2:18:06.360 --> 2:18:10.840]  basically i'm protecting you and i'll warn you if we launch an attack which was the greatest trees
[2:18:10.840 --> 2:18:15.640]  in the u.s history that has ever been committed people said oh alex it must not be true it i might
[2:18:15.640 --> 2:18:20.680]  wait bob woodward's former naval intelligence he's a big insider globalist he wouldn't have put this
[2:18:20.680 --> 2:18:25.240]  out unless they wanted to put it out to say that billy was a hero to set the precedent
[2:18:25.240 --> 2:18:29.640]  you can have a permanent bureaucracy stay behind network deep state basically that has its own
[2:18:29.640 --> 2:18:34.040]  bureaucratic coup over america that's why he put five in he's so incredibly weak to undermine the
[2:18:34.040 --> 2:18:39.160]  idea of the presidency well people said i was making it up with bob woodward's line well now milley
[2:18:39.160 --> 2:18:44.120]  admits he did it you see i didn't need to trust bob woodward i remember palosin on january eight
[2:18:44.120 --> 2:18:48.600]  ragging that she'd gotten a call for milley that he'd take control of the nukes so this treason
[2:18:48.600 --> 2:18:53.000]  was hiding and playing to you back then and we covered it see i have a memory folks i remember
[2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:59.880]  all this stuff that's why i know it's true and what's false i'm uh uh 59 years old in good health
[2:19:00.520 --> 2:19:07.240]  i'm not working in the front line so my time is not recommended to get back to nation
[2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:15.560]  that was the current ceo of phyzer just a few months ago on a national tv interview saying
[2:19:15.560 --> 2:19:23.480]  oh he doesn't need to take the so-called m r and a maxine is really a gene therapy he said you know
[2:19:23.480 --> 2:19:27.800]  he's 57 years old he's healthy he doesn't need to get that risk people but that's not what his
[2:19:27.800 --> 2:19:33.480]  b r firms that have bought off the politicians over a hundred countries say they say you've
[2:19:33.480 --> 2:19:38.680]  got to take it to have a job or leave your house or get on a plane or a train or even get outside
[2:19:38.680 --> 2:19:44.200]  your home for one hour a day if you live in australia so remember the white house is exempt
[2:19:44.200 --> 2:19:49.400]  congress and their staff are exempt the postal service is exempt all these big corporate heads
[2:19:49.400 --> 2:19:54.680]  are exempt they're not taking their poison vaccine they're pushing it on you wake up folks wake up
[2:19:54.680 --> 2:20:01.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:24.680 --> 2:20:31.560]  so
[2:20:33.160 --> 2:20:41.000]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:20:42.120 --> 2:20:47.880]  all right david is laying out the mind control and how to get out of it and he was getting earlier
[2:20:47.880 --> 2:20:52.120]  some sessions don't care that first segment in the nicky menage and how seismic that is and how
[2:20:52.120 --> 2:20:57.480]  they went hysterical because for older folks that don't know for people under 20 she's one of the
[2:20:57.480 --> 2:21:01.480]  she's like the rolling stones we're back in the 70s or something or the late 60s of the Beatles
[2:21:01.480 --> 2:21:06.280]  i mean she's triple quadruple platinum all the young people listen to her black white
[2:21:06.280 --> 2:21:11.240]  Hispanic it doesn't matter and she is very talented she's also very very worldly she's a beautiful
[2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:16.600]  woman but she has come out and just said screw you i'm gonna do what i want the media spends like
[2:21:16.600 --> 2:21:20.440]  oh she says she's gonna get vaccinated that's not even true they're like trying to like act like
[2:21:20.440 --> 2:21:24.520]  she's now buckled under because it's a chain reaction of course you should be able to say what
[2:21:24.520 --> 2:21:28.920]  you want of course you should be able to not take this thing of but but again then they lie and say
[2:21:28.920 --> 2:21:33.640]  we've always had mandatory shots no we haven't no they haven't that that's all lies ladies and
[2:21:33.640 --> 2:21:39.400]  gentlemen so david i continue with how seismic this is an example of the tipping point because you
[2:21:39.400 --> 2:21:46.520]  predicted major awakening in the year 2016 10 years before and you said 2016 i believe there'll be a
[2:21:46.520 --> 2:21:51.080]  global awakening to the globalist and push back all the world it happened with trump all senaro
[2:21:51.080 --> 2:21:57.320]  some of the double asia's turned to be bad but the brigsett boris johnson and then you said but then
[2:21:57.320 --> 2:22:01.240]  they're really gonna push back 2020 2021 i mean there's videos of this we need somebody to find
[2:22:01.240 --> 2:22:04.840]  them i heard i've heard you say this probably 30 times i've seen your video you can tell us what
[2:22:04.840 --> 2:22:07.960]  books it's in hell uh because i've read some of your books and read them in there but i don't remember
[2:22:07.960 --> 2:22:12.440]  which ones you've written so many and i've read so many and then you said by the year what 2025
[2:22:12.440 --> 2:22:16.440]  2026 it's basically they're gonna be in deep trouble and then what comes after that but it's
[2:22:16.440 --> 2:22:21.800]  kind of we choose uh the severity of how bad it's going to be till then did i did i nut shell
[2:22:21.800 --> 2:22:28.520]  paraphrase your position accurately well yeah i mean i think uh from uh you know there'll be
[2:22:28.520 --> 2:22:36.920]  very clear signs in 2024 and then into 2025 onwards that um the power of this cult is uh is waning
[2:22:36.920 --> 2:22:43.320]  is waning um but they're gonna throw everything at us now because it's basically a cornered rat and
[2:22:43.320 --> 2:22:52.680]  i'm still going to why this um this cult um has been operating from the shadows all the way basically
[2:22:52.680 --> 2:23:00.200]  all the way through human history um and what are the shadows the shadows are the subconscious mind
[2:23:00.760 --> 2:23:07.320]  because the shadows are operating outside the uh perception of the conscious mind so they're
[2:23:07.320 --> 2:23:13.880]  manipulating um in the peripheral vision in the subconscious out of the awareness of the conscious
[2:23:13.880 --> 2:23:20.360]  mind and they've been pushing this agenda forward step by step and you know we've been exposing
[2:23:21.160 --> 2:23:27.080]  this and being called crazy because it was operating in the subconscious in the shadows
[2:23:27.640 --> 2:23:33.080]  what's happened in the covid era is they've had to enter the room they've had to enter the realm of
[2:23:33.080 --> 2:23:38.920]  the conscious mind staggeringly still great numbers of people can't see it even then but
[2:23:38.920 --> 2:23:47.000]  enormous numbers of people compared with before uh can see it and it's a very dangerous time for them
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:53.640]  because um this is not um some time over the rainbow this is this is coming this is here and people
[2:23:53.640 --> 2:24:00.200]  can see it's here there's no denying it if you're in australia now it's very difficult to deny that
[2:24:00.200 --> 2:24:09.800]  you live in a fascist country uh so it's a dangerous time for them too and what people in the alternative
[2:24:09.800 --> 2:24:17.080]  media have been doing basically over these years is taking what's happening um in the subconscious
[2:24:17.640 --> 2:24:23.640]  and presenting it to the conscious mind and saying this is what is happening which you can't see
[2:24:24.280 --> 2:24:29.000]  and when in this covid era that's happened more and more because people have been able to see it
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:36.120]  because of the events that we've been uh that have been happening and and what this um has done
[2:24:37.160 --> 2:24:43.640]  is made people far more street wise you will have noticed like i have and anyone in the alternative
[2:24:43.640 --> 2:24:49.320]  media has who's been doing this for a very long time and knows that uh you know the number of
[2:24:49.320 --> 2:24:56.840]  people that can see it now are vastly vastly in excess that they were before um once you take it
[2:24:56.840 --> 2:25:01.560]  out of the subconscious and you present it to the conscious mind the conscious mind can see it
[2:25:01.560 --> 2:25:07.800]  now it gets it now it can start to see how the pieces fit because it's not in the subconscious
[2:25:07.800 --> 2:25:15.000]  anymore it's in the conscious and there's a this is a an absolute parallel with the process of
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:22.200]  subliminal um inserts into images and videos if you show i've i've tried this i've done this i've
[2:25:22.200 --> 2:25:28.840]  done this many times i know this is true you take us an image that has a subliminal insert in it
[2:25:29.480 --> 2:25:33.240]  and you say to someone can you see the subliminal and they look at it and they go
[2:25:33.240 --> 2:25:40.280]  no can't see no can't see anything um and then you point out where it is there it is oh yeah i
[2:25:40.280 --> 2:25:48.520]  can't couldn't see that what happens then is every time every time 20 years hence that person
[2:25:48.520 --> 2:25:54.600]  who couldn't see the subliminal sees that picture again the subliminal is the first thing they see
[2:25:54.600 --> 2:25:59.560]  because the subliminal has been brought out of the subconscious which is where it is subliminal
[2:25:59.560 --> 2:26:04.840]  means below threshold below the threshold of the conscious mind and it's been shown to the conscious
[2:26:04.840 --> 2:26:11.640]  mind and the conscious mind can now see it so clearly in other words the subliminal stops impacting
[2:26:11.640 --> 2:26:15.800]  on the perception of that person because they're consciously aware of it that's right the one you
[2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:19.880]  said is so key one of the most profound things ever that you've said here we have been taking
[2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:24.120]  their subconscious programming because we had already seen the subliminal and warning people so
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:29.320]  they now see it and now i don't know how they're gonna stop us because you and myself and so many
[2:26:29.320 --> 2:26:35.720]  others pre-warned everyone so much that now so many people know the truth and they're remembering
[2:26:35.720 --> 2:26:39.880]  that we warned them and now they're seeing the next phase come true and the next phase come true
[2:26:39.880 --> 2:26:44.600]  and the more it happens the more people listen to us and so we go from kind of interesting
[2:26:44.600 --> 2:26:50.840]  well-spoken oddities that were popular with some but overall just a curiosity to now David i mean
[2:26:50.840 --> 2:26:56.920]  you're not on a power trip i'm not either it's very humbling but my lord now you are as hot as
[2:26:56.920 --> 2:27:02.760]  white hot metal and so am i i mean we're in the zeitgeist what a responsibility yeah well it is
[2:27:02.760 --> 2:27:06.840]  a responsibility but everyone's got a responsibility with the responsibility of seeing comes the
[2:27:06.840 --> 2:27:12.280]  responsibility of doing not the responsibility of seeing and then saying oh i know what's coming
[2:27:12.280 --> 2:27:19.000]  next all see i was right it's actually engaging and that book is called perceptions of a renegade
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:26.440]  mind and a renegade mind is different to a questioning mind and an inquiring mind a questioning
[2:27:26.440 --> 2:27:35.720]  mind can critically think and can see what is happening but a critically thinking mind that
[2:27:35.720 --> 2:27:42.440]  can see that then does nothing about it might as well not have the knowledge in the first place you
[2:27:42.440 --> 2:27:49.720]  know they say knowledge is power no it's not the use of knowledge is power knowledge unused is
[2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:57.320]  knowledge what worth having and so what you um uh have with a renegade mind as i define it is not
[2:27:57.320 --> 2:28:03.800]  only that you critically think and you see it but then you cease to cooperate with it you will not
[2:28:03.800 --> 2:28:11.480]  uh acquiesce to it this is the next stage from the inquiring seeing mind to the renegade mind the
[2:28:11.480 --> 2:28:18.440]  one that can see and will not frickin have it either and what the the great thing about bringing
[2:28:18.440 --> 2:28:26.440]  this stuff to the conscious mind is that people then start working it out themselves you know
[2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:32.360]  i'd meet people in the street and they say you know i would have met not that long ago and then
[2:28:32.360 --> 2:28:37.720]  they've gone oh well you know i i i can't see what you're saying these days and now they're pointing
[2:28:37.720 --> 2:28:42.600]  it out to you stay there that's the key it's like give a man fish teach him how to fish once people
[2:28:42.600 --> 2:28:46.440]  see it we they don't need us anymore they're seeing the exact same thing like as soon as Tucker Carlson
[2:28:46.440 --> 2:28:50.760]  woke up 10 years ago he started seeing it now he sees everything i see and more same thing with you
[2:28:50.760 --> 2:28:55.560]  it's like once you see you oh my gosh now i see it we'll be right back if you're concerned about the
[2:28:55.560 --> 2:29:00.840]  power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity this will be the most
[2:29:00.840 --> 2:29:06.760]  important message you'll hear this year here's why we now have a small number of solar generators
[2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:13.080]  back in stock these emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most

[2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:12.600]  operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting caught flatfooted
[2:30:12.600 --> 2:30:18.600]  but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset
[2:30:18.600 --> 2:30:22.520]  and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners

[2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:23.560]  say Alex Jones David Ike doesn't really matter. It is crazy. You got two people. One that
[2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:28.840]  lives in the U.K. one is families from there back in the old times. But there are leaders
[2:34:28.840 --> 2:34:34.240]  all over the world fighting this. There are David Ikes in Nigeria and David Ikes in Japan
[2:34:34.240 --> 2:34:39.840]  and Alex Jones is in Mexico and everywhere. And it's a beautiful time to be alive. And
[2:34:39.840 --> 2:34:44.200]  though it's a very painful time. But they're targeting our children. So that makes it war.
[2:34:44.200 --> 2:34:48.800]  And it's on us metaphysically if we let them target the future and the innocence that we're
[2:34:48.800 --> 2:34:53.800]  meant to guard. So David Ike you were getting into. You were telling that story had to go
[2:34:53.800 --> 2:34:57.000]  to break about people coming up the on the street. And now they're not asking you what's
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:00.640]  going on. They're telling you what's going on. They're right. Which shows again. We're
[2:35:00.640 --> 2:35:05.200]  not following some cult. We're not following something Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson or
[2:35:05.200 --> 2:35:13.280]  or you said we are people are seeing the inversion for themselves. Yeah it's it's it's taking
[2:35:13.280 --> 2:35:19.200]  the manipulation out of the shadows and putting it into the perceptions of the conscious mind.
[2:35:19.200 --> 2:35:24.880]  Because once you know how it works then you can see it. And again know the outcome and
[2:35:24.880 --> 2:35:30.200]  you'll see the journey knowing where we're planned to be taken. Now apparently random
[2:35:30.200 --> 2:35:36.160]  events if you don't know that become very clear stepping stones to that to that planned
[2:35:36.160 --> 2:35:43.720]  outcome. So basically you are taking it out of the you're taking the mist from people's
[2:35:43.720 --> 2:35:49.480]  eyes and and people can then work it out for themselves in in in ways they never could
[2:35:49.480 --> 2:35:53.840]  before just like they see a subliminal every time they see a picture that they couldn't
[2:35:53.840 --> 2:35:59.400]  see the first time they looked at it. The spell is broken. So how do we help others break
[2:35:59.400 --> 2:36:06.880]  the spell point. That's the point. I mean I've used that phrase the title of some chapters
[2:36:06.880 --> 2:36:12.560]  in my books casting the spell and breaking the spell. What's what's what's happened
[2:36:12.560 --> 2:36:18.080]  throughout human history is a spell is being cast on the human mind particularly the subconscious
[2:36:18.080 --> 2:36:24.880]  mind which becomes the behavior of the conscious mind. And what we're in a situation of now
[2:36:24.880 --> 2:36:31.600]  is because it's it's it's putting itself more than ever before on public display. We have
[2:36:31.600 --> 2:36:37.240]  the opportunity to break the spell because that's what it is. You know when you look
[2:36:37.240 --> 2:36:43.200]  at people who've bought the covid narrative and people who haven't put their hands on
[2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:48.000]  their head and say why can't they see it. It's so obvious. But that's like that's like
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:59.240]  saying that some stooges on a hypnotist stage show shouldn't act as they do. They should
[2:36:59.240 --> 2:37:05.000]  see what the situation is. But they're not in control of their mind so they can't see.
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:09.600]  It's the spell. This is the point. That's why they can't see it. And this is why those
[2:37:09.600 --> 2:37:17.800]  that can see can see it because they've broken the spell. And it's all in the end a psychological
[2:37:17.800 --> 2:37:27.520]  conspiracy because the few can only control the many. If the many have a perception that
[2:37:27.520 --> 2:37:34.040]  will lead to behavior that will advance the agenda. If people don't have that perception
[2:37:34.040 --> 2:37:38.680]  therefore will behave differently then the few can't control the many. You can't do
[2:37:38.680 --> 2:37:43.800]  it physically. You can do it physically in small areas and and what have you. But to
[2:37:43.800 --> 2:37:49.080]  control billions you have to control their minds their perception which becomes their
[2:37:49.080 --> 2:37:54.400]  behavior. That's the whole foundation. It always has. So it's about breaking the spell.
[2:37:54.400 --> 2:38:01.800]  And you know we're at this pivotal point Alex now where they are wanting to take us into
[2:38:01.800 --> 2:38:09.920]  this next phase of lockdown and shutdown and facistic control. If you want to see the future
[2:38:09.920 --> 2:38:16.480]  look at Australia because you know there's some fantastic people in Australia who are
[2:38:16.480 --> 2:38:22.480]  pushing back against tremendous odds and taking the consequences. They are great great great
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:31.200]  people. But there's not enough of them. And what you take you will get what you take this
[2:38:31.200 --> 2:38:39.400]  cult will give you. And so the more that we acquiesce and just sit there and let it happen
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:44.040]  the more they'll give us. And I'll give you an example that the start of the week I mean
[2:38:44.040 --> 2:38:50.000]  they're going to come back again in ways I'll explain. But at the start of the week there
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:55.560]  was a total psychopath in Britain. He's the vaccine minister. He's just been moved to
[2:38:55.560 --> 2:38:59.920]  somewhere else now. But he was the vaccine minister when he made the statement. And he
[2:38:59.920 --> 2:39:06.760]  said that vaccine passports are coming in in Britain at the end of September. So you
[2:39:06.760 --> 2:39:11.240]  can't go to sporting events or you know a night club or whatever unless you have been
[2:39:11.240 --> 2:39:18.680]  vaccinated and you have this this this vaccine passport. Two days later the health secretary
[2:39:18.680 --> 2:39:24.160]  said actually we're not going ahead with that at the end of the month. And all the headlines
[2:39:24.160 --> 2:39:29.360]  were while the vaccine passports have been dropped. No they haven't. But what they've
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:35.480]  made the decision on in Britain where there's a lot of pushback is we can't get away with
[2:39:35.480 --> 2:39:41.160]  it now. So there's this agenda I talked about earlier step by step. But they want to make
[2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:46.120]  the next step. They absolutely want vaccine passports in Britain at the end of September.
[2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:50.320]  But they've made the decision we can't we can't get away with it at this point. So what
[2:39:50.320 --> 2:39:53.840]  they're planning to do is create more fear. And I want to get to that real quickly. That's
[2:39:53.840 --> 2:39:57.240]  why I wanted to try to get you on last week. And now you just remind me because I forgot
[2:39:57.240 --> 2:40:00.280]  once you got here I had so many questions on other subjects. What do you make of the
[2:40:00.280 --> 2:40:05.760]  announcement. OK we were going to have the vaccine passports everywhere. But now we're
[2:40:05.760 --> 2:40:09.920]  backing off for the winter. Oh but we might have to have another lockdown now because
[2:40:09.920 --> 2:40:13.560]  that's because you won't accept the vaccine. Is that what they're going to do. Well this
[2:40:13.560 --> 2:40:21.600]  is the this is what's happened this week. So he the health secretary guy called Javid
[2:40:21.600 --> 2:40:25.480]  makes this announcement at complete odds with his vaccine minister from a couple of days
[2:40:25.480 --> 2:40:31.320]  before. But the vaccine passports are not going ahead at the end of September. Then Johnson
[2:40:31.320 --> 2:40:35.880]  comes out I want to stop lockdowns. And you know we don't we don't want this. We don't
[2:40:35.880 --> 2:40:43.160]  want to go back to covid restrictions. And then the next day he makes this announcement
[2:40:43.160 --> 2:40:52.400]  and Javid makes it to that actually there is a plan B in case the cases go up. And the
[2:40:52.400 --> 2:41:01.360]  plan B is law masks by law again. Social distancing. Blah blah blah. Vaccine passports. That's
[2:41:01.360 --> 2:41:06.920]  plan B. Here are those that were dropped. And then oh yes another plan which if it gets
[2:41:06.920 --> 2:41:10.760]  really bad lockdown. And it's all behavioral psychology. It's always don't worry we're not
[2:41:10.760 --> 2:41:14.200]  going to do it. We're just going to do it. So as soon as you go ah it's meant to kill
[2:41:14.200 --> 2:41:21.320]  opposition they roll forward. Yeah exactly. And the thing is that they know the cases
[2:41:21.320 --> 2:41:27.040]  are going to go up. Or the alleged cases because they know this fake vaccine is going to cause
[2:41:27.040 --> 2:41:32.000]  health bloody mayhem. Particularly with these boosters they're rolling out to people now
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:37.240]  over 50. And they're very old. That's my next question. You predicted everything with basic
[2:41:37.240 --> 2:41:41.200]  total precision. It's insane. That's just true. What's coming next. A few minutes till
[2:41:41.200 --> 2:41:47.800]  break. But I mean what's going to come next. Well they are going to use the effects of
[2:41:47.800 --> 2:41:53.080]  the fake vaccine. Which they're going to cause call covid and new variants and anything
[2:41:53.080 --> 2:42:00.880]  else they can make up. Which will both be designed to hide the real reason for ill health.
[2:42:00.880 --> 2:42:07.200]  And people dying which is the fake vaccine. And then to use that to justify the plan B.
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:13.000]  And oh no oh no we need to have more lockdowns. We need to have all these things. Vaccine
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:19.320]  because you didn't take the shot. It's your fault. Yeah that's going to be the key. And
[2:42:19.320 --> 2:42:26.280]  the fact the irony is because what this cult does and you see I've documented this forever.
[2:42:26.280 --> 2:42:32.800]  It's an inversion cult. It turns everything on its head. So for instance the covid measures
[2:42:32.800 --> 2:42:37.200]  are about protecting health when actually they're about destroying it. The fake vaccines
[2:42:37.200 --> 2:42:40.440]  are about protecting health when they're actually about destroying it. It's a complete
[2:42:40.440 --> 2:42:46.560]  inversion. And so this inversion is that the fake vaccines those that have had them is
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:50.560]  going to cause their health problems. But we're going to blame those who haven't had
[2:42:50.560 --> 2:42:57.680]  them. Stay there. We'll be right back with David. If you're ruthless mega corporations
[2:42:57.680 --> 2:43:01.080]  who've taken over almost every government on earth and who are trying to destroy the
[2:43:01.080 --> 2:43:06.200]  middle class in any form of operability. You've got to divide and conquer the public
[2:43:06.200 --> 2:43:10.800]  so they don't know they're being targeted. And that's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped
[2:43:10.800 --> 2:43:16.000]  themselves in the name of LBGT and African-American rights and all the rest of it all over the
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:21.200]  world. That's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and in communist
[2:43:21.200 --> 2:43:26.080]  China and many other areas while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through
[2:43:26.080 --> 2:43:31.200]  the big tech and the central banks and other zone. So this is a criminal takeover and when
[2:43:31.200 --> 2:43:38.480]  you look at the new superclass it's the politicians. It's the corporate media. It's the police.
[2:43:38.480 --> 2:43:41.960]  It's the bureaucrats. It's members of Congress and their staff and their families. It's the
[2:43:41.960 --> 2:43:48.640]  White House. Hell it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots but
[2:43:48.640 --> 2:43:52.560]  not the general public and everybody else through corporate rule. So this is the true
[2:43:52.560 --> 2:43:57.840]  discrimination that's going on. The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there
[2:43:57.840 --> 2:44:03.680]  is plenty to be afraid of today. Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly
[2:44:03.680 --> 2:44:08.360]  and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible
[2:44:08.360 --> 2:44:13.320]  asymptomatic disease. The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of
[2:44:13.320 --> 2:44:18.440]  having 80 percent of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind
[2:44:18.440 --> 2:44:23.200]  in less than nine years. For those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this is
[2:44:23.200 --> 2:44:28.040]  all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see but there's only two things
[2:44:28.040 --> 2:44:33.640]  to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game. If enough people awaken
[2:44:33.640 --> 2:44:39.040]  from the cold spell then we win. But even when we win and we eventually will the days
[2:44:39.040 --> 2:44:44.120]  of convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare, get up to a years worth
[2:44:44.120 --> 2:44:51.080]  of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios and life saving
[2:44:51.080 --> 2:44:55.760]  knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[2:44:55.760 --> 2:45:01.120]  So when I first started taking survival skills basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had
[2:45:01.120 --> 2:45:05.840]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr.
[2:45:05.840 --> 2:45:09.640]  Group on your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival
[2:45:09.640 --> 2:45:13.720]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with
[2:45:13.720 --> 2:45:17.120]  that too. You had you know with the deep burdens tourist you know and I got really excited about
[2:45:17.120 --> 2:45:22.320]  that so I took it and then in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like
[2:45:22.320 --> 2:45:27.520]  my brain was enlightened. You know I could think again I could connect with people again
[2:45:27.520 --> 2:45:32.120]  and over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously
[2:45:32.120 --> 2:45:36.520]  take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one
[2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:41.240]  I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it. It's amazing.
[2:45:41.240 --> 2:45:45.600]  It works. But anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free
[2:45:45.600 --> 2:45:49.720]  of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our
[2:45:49.720 --> 2:45:54.160]  own hands. Beautifully said brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[2:45:54.160 --> 2:46:00.440]  I'll tell you what's life and death. If you don't have freedom of speech. If you don't
[2:46:00.440 --> 2:46:05.680]  have the right to communicate then you don't have a future. Always when governments take
[2:46:05.680 --> 2:46:09.320]  away speech they then enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating
[2:46:09.320 --> 2:46:14.320]  the population. And America the entire world is going down the tubes because the UN Global
[2:46:14.320 --> 2:46:18.240]  is directed great reset. That's why it's more important than ever that info or stay on the
[2:46:18.240 --> 2:46:22.320]  air and that all of us stay healthy. That's why I'm offering a bunch of our best selling

[2:46:59.360 --> 2:47:24.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Wow, two hours goes by really quick with David
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:31.000]  Eich of David Eich.com. And so you're going to tell us what's coming next. I mean, I know
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  you don't want to scare people. You're we're here to empower folks, but they need to know
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  there's a fire load under their ass. I think people get that now that we weren't making
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  it up 30 years ago when you were trailblazing and quite frankly, I'd read your books and
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:45.000]  think, well, this is all true, but this stuff I don't know about this sounds wild. It's
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  maybe 70% of what was in your books was was documented, but people didn't know about it.
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:56.000]  Of that 30% now 28% of its happen. So people better listen and better understand. We're
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  not up here saying all this to shock people when you talk about subliminals, people can
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  type in subliminals and TV, they admit it's everywhere. Curse commercials, everything.
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  Back in the 1950s, they found they just flashed a shot of a Marilyn Monroe style body of a
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  woman with Coca Cola ad behind it saying you want Coke and popcorn. It massively increased
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  people getting up and going and getting Coke and popcorn because the naked eye couldn't
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  produce a few frames. They saw it, the subconscious saw it. So everything you're talking about
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  is actually on record from 70% amount on the record to 30% opinion to now 98% is all admitted
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  now to 2% of your opinion. Will that come true? I think it will. Unfortunately, I hope
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  you're right about us stopping them in the next five years or so because if you look at
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  the gender 2030, as you know, we've now completed into 21. They want to start massive depopulation
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  by 2030. That's their goal. That's why Biden and AOC and all of them say the world ends
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  in 2030. They mean the world as we know it. So David, tell people the real horror of what's
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  coming if they don't take action. Yeah, well, 2030 is a number, a date, a year that comes
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  up and seems to bring together all these different subjects. If you look, for instance, at the
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  last time they said the world has so many years to save the planet, then you'll hit 2030.
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  Look at Kurzweil. He wants the process of the human brain being connected to AI by 2030
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  for that to be underway by 2030. Then you look at Agenda 2030. Of course, the UN, which
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  basically the great reset in one form. 2030 is a year where they want this to be really
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  moving to a point where they believe it will be unstoppable. That's why we have the period
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  between now and then to bring an end to this. That means that we have to put aside everything
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:16.000]  else and make this the absolute priority of our lives. If people say, oh, my kids are
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  more important, well, actually, your kids are more important, but they are the targets of
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  this whole conspiracy. So by standing up to this and refusing to acquiesce with this first,
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  you're putting your kids first. You're putting your family first. You're putting the future
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  first. Putting everything first. So we've got to move in far greater numbers. It's happening,
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  but far greater numbers from seeing it to ceasing to cooperate with it. You don't have to scream
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  no. You just have to mean it. No, I'm not doing it. No, not doing it. Let's realize that
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:07.000]  whatever they want to throw at us in terms of intimidation, you can't do this. You can't
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:14.000]  do that if you don't do what we say. What they want us to do is to take these fake life-ending,
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  life-changing vaccines is far, far worse and more sinister than anything else they can
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  come up with in terms of intimidation. Well, you won't be able to travel. I won't travel
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:31.000]  again. You won't be able to do this. Won't do it then. Do that. Don't do that either.
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:37.000]  I'm just not doing it. Whatever you try to intimidate me with, I'm not having this jab
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:46.000]  because I know that's the end when I do. And it's vital now that people put this first
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  and put not cooperating with it first because if enough people do that, the game is up.
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  I totally agree. But 30 years ago, you said what they were going to do and it came true.
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  Tell us what it will look like if we don't resist because I think that's extremely important.
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  Let me add one mortal thing I want you to comment on. We should say no to the injection and it's
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  causing major health problems and causing cancer 20 times increase at the diagnostic
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  clinics in the U.S. alone. I mean, this is Armageddon-level stuff. But one of the biggest
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:21.000]  groups now joining us and waking up is people that took the shots and got sick or took the
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:25.000]  shots and are now told you got to take three, four, five shots as they're now rolling out.
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  So how do we reach out to those that have already been poisoned or is it too late for them?
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:32.000]  That's what you're saying.
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  Well, I mean, you know, it's hard to call whether it's too late for anybody, but it's going to be
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  too late for some. That's for sure. But it's already been too late for many. I mean, you know,
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:51.000]  you look at the VAERS reporting system and the yellow card system in Britain and you have to
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  multiply that by anything between 100 and 10 to find the real figures. I mean, the Harvard
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  study said the VAERS system only counts about at 1 percent or less of vaccine adverse reactions
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  and deaths, et cetera. And the yellow card system is something similar and they admit no more
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:19.000]  than 10 percent do. So when they have, as we have in this country, well, well in excess,
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  getting on towards two million adverse reactions reported to the yellow card system and well,
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:30.000]  well in excess of a thousand deaths, you've got to multiply them by at least 10 and actually
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:38.000]  probably a very lot more. So it's already showing itself. And unfortunately, it's too late for
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  those people. But the point is that the more this moves on, the more people are going to see it
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:55.000]  because it becomes undeniable. And what you're talking about is very interesting and very important.
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:54:02.000]  I have noticed when we do these marches in London that more and more people who've had the fake
[2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:10.000]  VACs, either two or one, are now coming on the marches because of this process. You see, this is how
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  it's worked, correct? You tell them a lie to get to this stage and then they realize it's a lie.
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  But then you tell them another lie to get them to this stage and they realize it's a lie. And it
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  goes on. So they say, get tested. Everyone get tested and then we'll go back to normal. But the more
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:36.000]  you test with a test, not testing for it, the more fake cases, the more justification not to go back
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:42.000]  to normal. Then they say, wear a mask and we'll go back to normal. And you don't. Then they say,
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  this is the big one, get these fake vaccines and you go back to normal. Get two and you're fully
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  VACs and then you'll be fine and everything will be okay. And then suddenly the people have done
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  that and they realize, well, actually, it's not fine because I can't do things that I normally would,
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  even though I've been VACs. And now they're saying, look, what's happening in Israel and other
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  countries, they're saying, well, actually, to be fully VACs is not two anymore. It's three. And in
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:10.000]  Israel, they're saying, actually, there's a fourth on the way. And so more and more people who've gone
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  this far down that road of just believing what they're told are saying, hold on a minute. What do
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  you mean? I've got to have a third to get me vaccine passport or a fourth. So more and more
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  people are going to be moving over. And, and, you know, everyone is welcome. You know, it doesn't
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  matter what's gone before, everyone is welcome because we're in this together as a human race,
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  all colors, creeds, cultures, the entirety of the human race, one human race, one goal, one heart
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  and one. I totally agree. I have never felt more unified behind it. I've never loved humanity
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  more. I've never seen through it all more than I am now. I think everybody who's already somewhat
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  awake is getting more awake as evil comes into the world and makes its move. Newtonian
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  physics, I think it's just one measurement of it, but clearly good rises at the same time. And I
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  think rises faster. David, what do you think? Well, yeah, well, what we call good positivity
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  love is far more powerful than hatred and psychopathy. And the only way that this cult, I
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  think, this is one thing, Alex, that people need to appreciate. This cult is not all powerful.
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:28.000]  That's a bloody myth. It's not too powerful. The only way that it's got to this position of
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  apparent power is by hoarding knowledge, not least the knowledge of how reality works, how we
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  interact with it and how our perceptions become our experienced reality, which I explained in
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:46.000]  the book. David, I've been here two hours to five more minutes. I want you to finish this
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:50.000]  thought and talk about the book. And I want to just plug the book here at the end, because
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  some stations are going to leave us perceptions of a renegade mind. David, I David, I com
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  separately. We have the new film that we produced that I voiced with Robert Kennedy Jr. and
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  Dr. Tenpenny and just dozens of others. It's amazing. COVID land film now available in
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  fullwarstore.com. Get a free copy of in game. So that's two films for 1995. And it helps
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  fund the filmmakers. A major donor basically funded the film, but the filmmakers need to
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  make their money back from just because they've not been paid and they need to feed their
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  family. So this is this is really an important film in fullwarstore.com. And once they've
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:26.000]  made their money back in a month or so, we're going to put it out for free on the internet.
[2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:31.000]  But this is very well produced in fullwarstore.com, zero country code, meaning it works anywhere
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:36.000]  in the world. And we want you to make copies of it. So get COVID landed in fullwarstore.com
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  and fight back. All right, we'll be back with five more minutes of the icon David Ike. I'm
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:58:10.000]  Alex Jones.
[2:58:11.000 --> 2:58:39.000]  Thank you.

[2:58:46.000 --> 2:58:52.000]  General Lee, it's General Milley. I just want you to know that Trump tried to overthrow
[2:58:52.000 --> 2:58:57.000]  the US government two days ago on January 6. And I just want you to know I've taken control
[2:58:57.000 --> 2:59:01.000]  of the nuclear weapons. And if Trump tries to launch an attack on you, we'll let you know
[2:59:01.000 --> 2:59:03.000]  first the attacks coming.
[2:59:03.000 --> 2:59:09.000]  That is from the transcript. Then he called Pelosi Schumer and others to say, I'm loyal
[2:59:09.000 --> 2:59:13.000]  to you. I'm going to protect Trump from using nuclear weapons. When Trump was going for
[2:59:13.000 --> 2:59:17.000]  detente with China and North Korea at the time, and Trump's responded saying it's a total
[2:59:17.000 --> 2:59:21.000]  lie. Pelosi's come out and admitted it happened. Hell, she bragged back on January 8 that it
[2:59:21.000 --> 2:59:27.000]  took place then and is saying that she honors Milley and that he's this courageous person.
[2:59:27.000 --> 2:59:31.000]  So we're all these other Democrats. So this is the permanent deep state coup that's been
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:36.000]  in control for a long time now coming out of the shadows publicly. Remember, these people
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:41.000]  literally hate you and your family. Now they're injecting you with poison soft kill injections.
[2:59:41.000 --> 3:00:02.000]  Wake up America or be destroyed.
[3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:15.000]  Final segment with David. I asked him, hey, plug your book, talk about what you're doing.
[3:00:15.000 --> 3:00:19.000]  We're going to have another big live event. He said, well, November 6, I'm doing a six
[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  hour webcast for everybody there at iconic.com. We'll find it at David.com. And he was also
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:29.000]  talking about some other key issues, but I want to show him this real quick. I know he's
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:35.000]  seen all these, but this is from World Data from the UN from the major governments. Israel
[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  with deaths, hospitalizations, illnesses off the chart and Palestine almost no deaths,
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  almost no illnesses differences. They're not being vaccinated with the poison. Israel
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  is same numbers out of Norway, same numbers out of everywhere, vaccinated countries, the
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:54.000]  exact line that we have graphs where it shows the lines in Israel on a vaccination meeting
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  with the exact death rates. Here's another one. This is out of Israel and Sweden. Another
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  comparison. We've got more of these. I mean, it's just absolutely insane. David, how can
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  they ignore numbers like this? How can this, because like you said, the people perish with
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  lack of knowledge. The only way the elite does this is keeping us from the truth.
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  Yeah. Well, the thing is, like I said a few minutes ago, they lie to get to the next stage
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  and then they lie to get to the next stage. So the next stage or one of the next stages
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:34.000]  is new fake vaccines for variants. So they will sell the idea that the original fake
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  vaccines are not working for the variants. Hence people who are fake vaccinated are getting
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  quote COVID. And therefore we need new fake vaccines for the variants, which people will
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  then be demanded to have. And these fake so-called variant vaccines, they're already sitting
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  there waiting to play out. And what we need to do is to hold the thought immovably. But
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  when they say vaccinated people are getting COVID, it's a nonsense. It's an absolute lie.
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:14.000]  They are getting ill from the effects of the fake vaccine. That's why there's so many
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:19.000]  people who are so called fully vaxxed, who are getting health problems and it's called
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:26.000]  COVID. Because one of the expressions, one of the consequences of these fake vaccines
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  is respiratory problems, which is so easy to say it's COVID-19. And of course, what
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:36.000]  they've been doing all the way through this is adding more and more and more symptoms
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  to the COVID list so that they can then say more and more, they've got this, which is
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  not respiratory, oh, it's COVID-19. Because they have to hide all these consequences of
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:54.000]  these fake vaccines. That's a classic soft kill operation where you have the fake virus
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  excuse to get them on thing that makes them sick. Now you claim it's the variants. Now
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:02.000]  you've got them captured and then there you are. Yeah. And if you look at Israel, you
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  know, I've been going on for a long, long time about the fact that Israel is not actually
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  controlled by Jewish people. It's controlled by a cult called Sabbateans, Sabbatean cult.
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  And they have contempt for Jewish people. And they are using Israel, the Sabbatean cult,
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  which is a big, big influential part of the global cult, as a laboratory. And we've seen
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  this, this breaking story in the last few days of a Pfizer executive saying that Israel
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:40.000]  is their laboratory in terms of these. And he said it on a hot mic and they also admit
[3:03:40.000 --> 3:03:44.000]  that they're doing it to coerce and control everybody in a big test and that it basically
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  doesn't work. Yeah. And so, you know, I would say to Jewish people, if you're being ruled
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  by Jewish people that care about you, why are they doing this to you? Why have they
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  introduced a fake vaccine, which is damaging your health on a scale that was never happening
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:15.000]  before? Because they don't have your best interests at heart. They hate you. And they
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:20.000]  want- It's eugenics. They want to get rid of anybody that's competition to them.
[3:04:20.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  Yeah. And, you know, they don't care if you're Jewish or Arabic or middle class white American.
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:32.000]  They want control of all of you and they want rid of loads of you. And here are the Jews
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:38.000]  trusting globalists that are literally killing them. DavidIke, DavidIke.com, perceptions
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  of a renegade mind. Thank you so much for spending so much time with us. Cheers, mate.

[3:06:20.000 --> 3:06:24.000]  War Room today, and I'm going to be back tonight and tomorrow because we've got so much big
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:29.000]  breaking news. We've got a team going down to the Texas border right now. They'll be
[3:06:29.000 --> 3:06:33.000]  there soon, covering this. Please show them the drone footage and the up-close footage.
[3:06:33.000 --> 3:06:39.000]  This isn't just one bridge. This is going on over 200 miles of the very populated area
[3:06:39.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  of Texas from the coast there in Corpus Christi, with Mexico on the other side, right all the
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:49.000]  way into the desert where the people can't get across. There's still a lot of crossing
[3:06:49.000 --> 3:06:54.000]  going on at the National Park, Big Bend. Again, that is like a 400-mile-long border.
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:07:04.000]  200 miles of it, 200 miles of the Texas border, every five miles or so is that.
[3:07:04.000 --> 3:07:08.000]  Because there are bridges every four or five miles of the cities, and then every 10 miles
[3:07:08.000 --> 3:07:13.000]  or so in the countryside. And we have people on the ground there, our law enforcement sources.
[3:07:13.000 --> 3:07:18.000]  They say this is going on everywhere. This is one Del Rio crossing where they estimate
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:27.000]  8,200 people. And it's mainly Haitians who got here from collapse Haiti and the earthquakes
[3:07:27.000 --> 3:07:31.000]  and the rest of it, the Clintons stealing all the aid money. And again, that's the key.
[3:07:31.000 --> 3:07:36.000]  The globalists collapse these countries. They then organize the people into aid groups that
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:41.000]  give them $2,000, $3,000 debit cards with no name on them. That's in Reuters. And then
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:46.000]  they flood us. And George Soros gets the State Department money. He keeps part of it. Trump
[3:07:46.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  killed this program four years ago. He was about a year in office. They were so pissed.
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:55.000]  Lou Dobbs talked about it, showed the Reuters article, and almost got fired. He later did
[3:07:55.000 --> 3:07:59.000]  get fired for other things. Question of the election. And they said it, Fox News said,
[3:07:59.000 --> 3:08:04.000]  it's not true. George Soros is not involved giving debit cards to people. He posed to type
[3:08:04.000 --> 3:08:11.000]  in NBC News, guys. George Soros helps migrants with debit cards. And it shows him sitting
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:16.000]  there with it. I mean, this is incredible. So they're organizing it not to help these
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:20.000]  people, but to bring them here as they spend a month or six months in the refugee camp
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:24.000]  being brainwashed against America, being given cards, and then they take their cell phones
[3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  away if they have them and give them new Democrat-controlled phones they own and run with
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:33.000]  only contacts to Democrats. Then they send them in, they sign them up for welfare, and
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:38.000]  they milk about half the checkoff of them and then make them work in sweatshops. So they
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:43.000]  are importing slaves from all over the world, all over the Caribbean, all over Latin America,
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:48.000]  all over everywhere. You cannot make this up, ladies and gentlemen. There it is. George
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:54.000]  Soros' mastercard to partner to aid migrants refugees. Now, that's five years ago. We talk
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:09:02.000]  about it. It's like, it's not true. It's not happening. Think about the magnitude of this
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  show. Incredible footage already. The war room's coming up in about 50 minutes. The next
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:11.000]  50 minutes is Kate Dowley. I just want to say again, we won't be here if it isn't for
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:15.000]  you. I'm trying to hire more camera people, more reporters. We're fighting as hard as
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:19.000]  we can here. We've got the Democrat party suing the same folks at Bankrupt and Remington,
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:24.000]  our oldest gun manufacturer. Same law firm, same Democrats. But it's okay. We are fighting.
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:28.000]  We're expanding. We've got a lot of stuff going on. And for everything you see on the
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  table, there's a lot more going on you don't know about, but you see out there. So we need
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  your prayers, we need your support, and we need your financial support infowarstore.com
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  back in stock. Winter sun, the highest quality vitamin D3 for your immune system. Take it
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:46.000]  under the tongue. Great for children, great for adults, critical for old people and folks
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:49.000]  with brown skins. You don't want to absorb much of the sun. Everybody needs it. Back in
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:54.000]  stock, 50% off. Ultra 12, highest quality vitamin B12. Don't inject it, but it's the same
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:58.000]  pharmaceutical stuff that you get from doctors and putting your fat with a little needle.
[3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:01.000]  Don't do that. It's taken under the tongue. I have a doctor's prescription. I take it
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  once a week in the fat because it gives me so much energy and feels good. So go to a
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  doctor, they give you his prescription. I'm just saying the stuff we have taken under
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:10.000]  the tongue gets into the blood vessels too. Not as good as an injection, way better than
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  taking a pill because your gut doesn't absorb a lot of D3 or vitamin B12, which are amazing.
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:19.000]  So that's 50% off. I haven't taken a shot in a week. I'm going to go take one at this
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  and also put it in my drink. I've got it right here. I take my B12 all the time. I couldn't
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:29.000]  do it without this. And it's also delicious. There's no sweetener in it. True organic
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:35.000]  concentrated B12, pharmaceutical grade taste, incredibly sweet naturally. It's just amazing
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  what D3 does. It's amazing what a vitamin B12 when it's pure does. The synthetic crap
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:43.000]  does nothing for you. In fact, it hurts your liver. We've got the new film available with
[3:10:43.000 --> 3:10:49.000]  a free copy of Endgame. That's COVIDland, miniseries part one, infowarstore.com, and
[3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  we have the t-shirts all being sold at cost for one week and that sale will end.
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:58.000]  All right. Taking over is Kate Daly, syndicated talk show host and a great Patrick. Kate
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:11:01.000]  Daly show.com. Kate, thank you for being with us.
[3:11:01.000 --> 3:11:05.000]  Oh, thank you, Alex. I really appreciate. I really appreciate this. Hey, everybody.
[3:11:05.000 --> 3:11:10.000]  How are you doing today? And boy, I have a guest for you. In fact, Chris Ann Hall,
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:17.000]  chrisannhaul.com, libertyfirstsociety.com. She is our constitutional expert and attorney.
[3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:22.000]  She tours the nation. What an amazing gal. You're going to love what she has to say
[3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  and you're really going to learn something today about the Constitution because last
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:31.000]  time I checked, we still have that document in play. Last time I checked. So Chris Ann
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  Hall joins me and I am so happy to have you with me, Chris Ann, because so many people
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:42.000]  have so many questions about this. I don't know, expanding federal power in the name
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:47.000]  of liberty. What? And so people are trying to understand what's going on. So the federal
[3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  mandate and welcome to you. Thank you for coming on with me.
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:56.000]  Thank you, Kate. It's always a pleasure to be with you. I love being with you on your
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:12:02.000]  show and we always end up having lots of fun together. So not a lot. I love it. I you
[3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:07.000]  know, you're just you're just a still you have just such stellar knowledge when it comes
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:12.000]  to explaining the Constitution and the bounds of which they are supposed to operate in and
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:19.000]  what limited government looks like. So you heard the federal mandate. Let tell us what
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:23.000]  your thoughts are on this and what they can actually get away with what they can't what
[3:12:23.000 --> 3:12:28.000]  they think they can. I want to hear all about it. You know, Kate, as I always say on your
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:34.000]  show, when I was saying on my show, my thoughts and my opinions are irrelevant and we should
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:40.000]  be holding opinions and thoughts as irrelevant. What really is relevant is what the Constitution
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:46.000]  says, what the law says, what the facts say. And what was really interesting to me, Kate,
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:52.000]  from the first second after Biden's little press release about in his little speech about
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:58.000]  how we're going to get tougher on those who do not want the jab was that the very next
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:06.000]  second, the mainstream media starts publishing out their false headlines that Biden said
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:14.000]  that there will be mandates of this vaccination for federal employees, for employers with
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  a hundred more employees with no exemptions available. You can look at his speech, nothing
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:26.000]  in his speech says that and nothing in the Department of Labor says that either. So fact
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:34.000]  checker number one, there will be exemptions available, both medical and religious exemptions.
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:40.000]  Religious exemptions are required by the Constitution of the United States, required by title
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:50.000]  seven of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. And not only that, Kate, when you actually look at
[3:13:50.000 --> 3:14:03.000]  Biden's speech, Biden actually says mandate vaccinations or engage in the proactive, the
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  alternative measures, right, which is increased testing or mask wearing or six feet social
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:18.000]  distancing. No business out there, no government agency out there has to mandate the vaccination.
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:27.000]  They can number one, choose to give exemptions or number two, they can choose to just forgo
[3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:34.000]  the whole mandate to begin with and engage in testing masks and all this other stuff.
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  What about the fines? Everybody's worried about the fines. I'm going to get a fine. I'm
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:43.000]  going to get a fine. What about the fines? Well, you know, that's where our governors,
[3:14:43.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  our sheriffs, our local governments have to come into play. First off, let's just be clear.
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  I always have to be that person. There is no authorization in the Constitution of the
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:05.000]  United States for OSHA. There is no authorization in the Constitution for a federal department
[3:15:05.000 --> 3:15:11.000]  of labor. If you want to have an occupational safety and hazards division, if you want to
[3:15:11.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  have a division of labor, these things must exist at the state level. There is no federal
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:25.000]  authorization for them. You can't. I've issued a challenge with a reward. Show me article
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:31.000]  section and clause that authorizes the federal government to have an OSHA and a department
[3:15:31.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  of labor that dictates the internal operations of the states. Now you know why I love Chris
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  Ann Hall. I'll be right back with constitutional expert Chris Ann Hall, attorney, expert. You're
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:56.000]  going to love this. Stay with us. You're going to learn so much.
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:30.000]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too. But listen,
[3:16:30.000 --> 3:16:34.000]  after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's
[3:16:34.000 --> 3:16:39.000]  one thing almost everyone agrees on. It's that immune system health can literally be
[3:16:39.000 --> 3:16:44.000]  the difference between life and death. You probably already believe that. I certainly do.
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:48.000]  So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based
[3:16:48.000 --> 3:16:54.000]  substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support. Now you'll
[3:16:54.000 --> 3:16:59.000]  have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:04.000]  No cures or treatments there. Instead, little known but shocking immune system research
[3:17:04.000 --> 3:17:10.000]  and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10x. In the

[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:28.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:33.000]  my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[3:17:33.000 --> 3:17:37.000]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people
[3:17:37.000 --> 3:17:41.000]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe
[3:17:41.000 --> 3:17:46.000]  taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:17:46.000 --> 3:17:55.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:17:55.000 --> 3:18:00.000]  I'll tell you what's lying for death. If you don't have freedom of speech, if you don't
[3:18:00.000 --> 3:18:05.000]  have the right to be able to communicate, then you don't have a future. Always when governments
[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:09.000]  take away speech they then enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating the
[3:18:09.000 --> 3:18:14.000]  population. And America, the entire world is going down the tubes because the UN Global
[3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  has directed great reset. That's why it's more important than ever that InfoWars stay on the
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:22.000]  air and that all of us stay healthy. That's why I'm offering a bunch of our best-selling

[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:26.000]  It's the fact that he's following a UN Globalist Great Reset blueprint that Australia, the
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:31.000]  UK, Europe and the rest of the Western world is and that this is just the beginning. More
[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:37.000]  lockdowns, national medical IDs approved by the United Nations, carbon taxes that don't
[3:19:37.000 --> 3:19:41.000]  just track and trace you and tax you, but actually tell you when you can go somewhere
[3:19:41.000 --> 3:19:47.000]  and what you can do. It's all been announced at the UN level. This is a UN World Government
[3:19:47.000 --> 3:19:53.000]  takeover, corporate revolution through global governance. It's illegal and Congress will
[3:19:53.000 --> 3:19:55.000]  stand up and stop it now.
[3:19:58.000 --> 3:20:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:01.000 --> 3:20:21.000]  Welcome back. I'm Kate Dally, your guest host for the hour. Thank you, Alex and Infowars.
[3:20:21.000 --> 3:20:26.000]  You know, I have such a wonderful guest. She has been on my show periodically, I mean
[3:20:26.000 --> 3:20:31.000]  every week for five years and I've gotten to know her well and she tours the country
[3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:36.000]  talking about the Constitution. She informs sheriff's departments all across the country.
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:41.000]  She is informing the public all across the country about how to understand the Constitution
[3:20:41.000 --> 3:20:46.000]  and what people can do about it in today's terms too and I absolutely love this because
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:51.000]  this is what we're lacking. This is the disconnect in our nation for sure and we have a highly
[3:20:51.000 --> 3:20:56.000]  educated populace and you know, Chris Ann Hall, my guest, I'm so glad that you're here
[3:20:56.000 --> 3:21:04.000]  because we need instruction on powers. What can the president do and why and how and how
[3:21:04.000 --> 3:21:08.000]  are we going to fight it? So we're going to get into that, but I also wanted to tell you,
[3:21:08.000 --> 3:21:13.000]  go over to KateDallyRadio.com, listen to all the podcasts, share those. My gosh, there's
[3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:19.000]  like 7,000 hours of podcasts and education and we can start really informing and Chris
[3:21:19.000 --> 3:21:23.000]  Ann Hall has wonderful, wonderful podcasts there as well on KateDallyRadio.com, but
[3:21:23.000 --> 3:21:28.000]  her website is LibertyFirstSociety.com or Chris Ann Hall from the Chris Ann Hall show,
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:35.000]  ChrisAnnHall.com. Chris Ann, tell me about article two and powers. Let's talk presidential
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:40.000]  powers. You know Kate, you hit the nail on the head when you started off there talking
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:45.000]  about how the American people simply don't know. I mean, I have a really good friend
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:50.000]  in New York who just laid it down on the line for me. He said, look, Chris Ann, the problem
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:55.000]  in America is that people don't know what they don't know. And we have been deliberately
[3:21:55.000 --> 3:22:01.000]  denied proper constitutional education in America for a very, very long time. And so
[3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:06.000]  when people look at the president of the United States standing behind the presidential seal
[3:22:06.000 --> 3:22:12.000]  and giving these official speeches and then you have the media all running in like little
[3:22:12.000 --> 3:22:17.000]  minions doing the bidding and then you've got Saki back there talking to him, you know,
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:22.000]  with authority about all the power of the president, American people really lack the
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  educational discernment to understand. And that's by design, mind you, they lack the
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:33.000]  educational discernment to understand that article two is the source of power for the
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:40.000]  president. And the president does not have the authority to issue mandates upon the
[3:22:40.000 --> 3:22:46.000]  American people or American businesses. Even if the federal government had this authority
[3:22:46.000 --> 3:22:51.000]  through the Constitution, which they do not, the president of the United States through
[3:22:51.000 --> 3:22:59.000]  article two does not possess this power. And it's time for the American people to embrace
[3:22:59.000 --> 3:23:05.000]  the Constitution, get educated on the Constitution and start standing up and pointing their finger
[3:23:05.000 --> 3:23:10.000]  at the president. And I don't care who the president is, frankly, pointing at the president
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:16.000]  and saying, no, you don't have this authority and we will not comply.
[3:23:16.000 --> 3:23:23.000]  Wow, you're exactly right. And they are depending on the illusion of their power based on what
[3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:28.000]  the states do. So the states are the ones that have to go and put all this in motion,
[3:23:28.000 --> 3:23:33.000]  right? And employers and they want the illusion, don't they? They want the illusion of power.
[3:23:33.000 --> 3:23:41.000]  Absolutely. Yeah. So as individuals, we have the we as individuals, we are the creators
[3:23:41.000 --> 3:23:46.000]  of government, right? That's what the Declaration of Independence says that governments are
[3:23:46.000 --> 3:23:51.000]  instituted among men, deriving their just power from the consent of the government.
[3:23:51.000 --> 3:23:58.000]  So our ultimate power is through peaceful noncompliance. That's why Kate, we have the
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:03.000]  documentary that we just recently released called noncompliant, that you can watch at
[3:24:03.000 --> 3:24:11.000]  noncompliantmovie.com. But the real source of protection of our powers, once again as
[3:24:11.000 --> 3:24:15.000]  outlined in the Declaration of Independence, is the creation of our state governments
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:22.000]  with the sole purpose to secure our rights. And so our governors have to say, no, we're
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:27.000]  not going to allow the federal government to exercise this power in our states. Many
[3:24:27.000 --> 3:24:33.000]  are. We need counties, we need municipalities, we need sheriffs. And this is what we teach
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:38.000]  in our sheriff program, not just simply what is the power of the sheriff, what is the origin
[3:24:38.000 --> 3:24:44.000]  of the sheriff, what is the duty of the sheriff to secure the civil rights of the people. So
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:50.000]  we have to get these things in motion, these protections that our founders put in place
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:58.000]  as a guard and a security of our rights. And the states need to let go of their servitude
[3:24:58.000 --> 3:25:04.000]  to federal government paid and bought for by federal money in order to protect the rights
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:10.000]  of the people. Absolutely. Absolutely. What if you have a bought and sold governor? There's
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:15.000]  plenty of those to go around. What if your governor is just so in the pocket and taking
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  the dollar train from the feds, then what do we do? You know, that's why we're a constitutional
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:27.000]  republic and not a democracy, because we have the power as the people to come together
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:33.000]  even in minority groups to control government, which means our counties, if our governor
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:39.000]  is sold out on an individual basis, everyone who is in county government took the same
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:43.000]  oath. I do solemnly swear I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  and the Constitution of my state. The sheriff takes that oath. The counties must then refuse
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:55.000]  to comply with the governors. The sheriffs must then refuse to enforce the laws and
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:26:02.000]  even stand guard when those outside the county want to enforce unconstitutional degrees
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:08.000]  on the people of their county. This is the multi-level check and balance, the brilliance
[3:26:08.000 --> 3:26:14.000]  of our founders designed multi-level checks, not just the people versus government, but
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:20.000]  the people in their counties, the people in their cities, the people through their sheriff
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:26.000]  who is the greatest guard to their liberties right there. We don't have to stand alone,
[3:26:26.000 --> 3:26:34.000]  Kate. We have unity in liberty and power through our constitutional republic.
[3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:42.000]  Amen. So what were you thinking when the president gave all of these powers to the
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:50.000]  Department of Labor and basically OSHA to fulfill these roles of policemen finding and
[3:26:50.000 --> 3:26:55.000]  all of the different things that they can do to a business supposedly?
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:27:01.000]  You know, what I did when I first thought was I really wish the American people knew
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:07.000]  that the president did not even have that power to give. The president does not have
[3:27:07.000 --> 3:27:14.000]  the authority. I challenge anybody, you search Article 2 of the Constitution, which is the
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:21.000]  complete sum and total of presidential power. You will not find one OSHA power. You will
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:27.000]  not find one Department of Labor power. You will not find one emergency authorization
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:33.000]  of power in the hands of the president. And when you study out why our founders made the
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:40.000]  president of the United States so limited in authority, you understand that they recognized
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:47.000]  that kind of authority resting in one person in the office of the president will inevitably
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:55.000]  transform our government into what Madison called a mixed monarchy at best. They specifically
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:28:02.000]  and on purpose denied this power to the president of the United States.
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:08.000]  Now you know why she's on my show every week. She's a fireball. And let me just tell you
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:12.000]  there's more. We'll talk about more when we come back. But there's so many things that
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:18.000]  we need to understand in our fight. And when somebody grants themselves power, this is
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  one of the most sickening things to watch is a is a I call him King fraud a lot. But King
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:29.000]  fraud a lot stands up there and tells you he has all these power and just all this power
[3:28:29.000 --> 3:28:35.000]  and want you to believe it. And this is the sad. The sad part is that Americans think
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:39.000]  whatever he says goes, we're going to come right back with Chris Ann Hall. Her website
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:45.000]  by the way is libertyfirstsociety.com Chris Ann Hall.com the movie non compliant. You
[3:28:45.000 --> 3:28:49.000]  must see this movie. If you're going to see any movie this year, see that one. We're going
[3:28:49.000 --> 3:28:52.000]  to get informed to be right back. I'm Kate Dolly.
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:58.000]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me. And it makes me feel pathetic
[3:28:58.000 --> 3:29:04.000]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support
[3:29:04.000 --> 3:29:08.000]  and for word of mouth. And we're all this together. And you know, it gets old having
[3:29:08.000 --> 3:29:12.000]  to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:29:12.000 --> 3:29:16.000]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty
[3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:20.000]  at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:24.000]  almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups and we're still here.
[3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:28.000]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[3:29:28.000 --> 3:29:32.000]  That's why we've got to be taken off air. That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:29:32.000 --> 3:29:37.000]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi free. You can't have
[3:29:37.000 --> 3:29:42.000]  info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:29:42.000 --> 3:29:47.000]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready. So thank you all and get an infowarstore.com.
[3:29:47.000 --> 3:29:51.000]  Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more. They're wonderful products
[3:29:51.000 --> 3:29:54.000]  and they support the info. We're thank you.
[3:29:54.000 --> 3:30:00.000]  Globalist General Milley has revealed to the world that the United States is not a free
[3:30:00.000 --> 3:30:05.000]  republic but is run by a permanent state-bound network, bureaucracy. The big takeaway here
[3:30:05.000 --> 3:30:11.000]  is that he didn't act alone. He felt that he was safe to talk on an overseas phone line
[3:30:11.000 --> 3:30:16.000]  system that he knew was being watched by the dark government, the Five Eyes, the Russians
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:20.000]  and the Chinese. He wanted the world to know that. He was proud of what he was doing
[3:30:20.000 --> 3:30:25.000]  because he was backed by the deep state. This permanent bureaucracy sees America as its
[3:30:25.000 --> 3:30:30.000]  enemy. It sees the American people as its enemy. It sees prosperity as its enemy.
[3:30:30.000 --> 3:30:35.000]  And it conspired with the Communist Chinese to threaten them basically and say, Trump may
[3:30:35.000 --> 3:30:40.000]  nuke you, but if he tries, we'll call and say we're attacking you so you can respond first.
[3:30:40.000 --> 3:30:45.000]  That's beyond treason. But it shows the type of anti-American sycophants living in their
[3:30:45.000 --> 3:30:50.000]  own fetid bubble. They try to get away with this. Milley and all of his accomplices seem
[3:30:50.000 --> 3:30:53.000]  to go to prison now for life.
[3:30:53.000 --> 3:30:59.000]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies
[3:30:59.000 --> 3:31:04.000]  that are told. And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which
[3:31:04.000 --> 3:31:09.000]  is why fluoridated water is a big problem. Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate
[3:31:09.000 --> 3:31:15.000]  crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions, natural functions
[3:31:15.000 --> 3:31:20.000]  which have been known for millennia. The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[3:31:20.000 --> 3:31:25.000]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye, also described as the seat
[3:31:25.000 --> 3:31:31.000]  of the soul. The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise
[3:31:31.000 --> 3:31:37.000]  unseen dimensions of reality. Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland
[3:31:37.000 --> 3:31:43.000]  healthy. Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking
[3:31:43.000 --> 3:31:48.000]  water fluoride free and the propure shower head will seal the deal. Get them both today
[3:31:48.000 --> 3:31:55.000]  for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com.
[3:32:48.000 --> 3:32:55.000]  Please continue to support us. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Plus these
[3:33:18.000 --> 3:33:29.000]  are my guests today. My guest today is, of course, the great Chris Ann Hall. She is the
[3:33:29.000 --> 3:33:34.000]  constitutional attorney and expert that goes around the nation. She's been doing this for,
[3:33:34.000 --> 3:33:40.000]  my gosh, over a decade, going around and teaching sheriffs, teaching the public, the movie non-compliant.
[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:46.000]  You must see this movie. We have to get a whole generation right now, several generations,
[3:33:46.000 --> 3:33:53.000]  educated in the Constitution so that we know how to back up the God given what's supposed
[3:33:53.000 --> 3:33:58.000]  to be government protective rights. Here we are with Chris Ann Hall. I want to talk about
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:03.000]  exemptions. I want people to understand their rights as their employers right now are handing
[3:34:03.000 --> 3:34:12.000]  down this mandate for this experimental jab. What can somebody do? What can somebody do
[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:21.000]  in this position? Exemptions are your right by the exercise clause, the freedom of exercise
[3:34:21.000 --> 3:34:26.000]  clause of the First Amendment. What we need to understand, because people are always asking
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:31.000]  me, Chris Ann, because my law firm, Liberty First Legal, nonprofit law firm has been
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:38.000]  helping people across the country try to navigate through these things. What people are always
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:46.000]  asking me is, Chris Ann, what is it, if I'm not a Christian, can I apply for an exemption?
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:51.000]  Well, according to the Constitution of the United States, you absolutely have the right
[3:34:51.000 --> 3:35:00.000]  to an exemption regardless of what your ideology, what your conscience is called, for example.
[3:35:00.000 --> 3:35:06.000]  You do not have to be a member of an organized religion. You don't even have to be in line
[3:35:06.000 --> 3:35:14.000]  with the organized religion that you claim to be a part of. Because I just saw, for example,
[3:35:14.000 --> 3:35:22.000]  a Southern Baptist theological ethicist try to come and write this paper and say, it's
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:29.000]  okay for Baptists to get the vaccination that's made from aborted babies because it happened
[3:35:29.000 --> 3:35:37.000]  so long ago, the sin has been washed out of that over time. So you have no, I know, right,
[3:35:37.000 --> 3:35:43.000]  Kate? This theological ethicist for the Southern Baptist Convention is trying to convince Christians
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:52.000]  that sin is laundered out over time. And so even if you identify as a Baptist, if everyone
[3:35:52.000 --> 3:35:58.000]  else thinks differently in your named religion, the freedom of religion clause of the First
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:02.000]  Amendment says you have the right to believe that and you have the right to be protected
[3:36:02.000 --> 3:36:08.000]  in that, and you can't be mandated outside your conscience of that.
[3:36:08.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  Amen. So seek the exemptions. What about sincerely held belief? You can write your own without
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:20.000]  a church signing off on it, correct? Oh, absolutely. That's the whole point. If I wanted to say,
[3:36:20.000 --> 3:36:26.000]  you know, I'm a Christian and everybody knows that who is on our show and on your show and
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:32.000]  it does any work with me. But if I were to say, I believe in the magic princess, princess
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:37.000]  who lives on the Orion belt, and I was having coffee the other day and the magic princess
[3:36:37.000 --> 3:36:43.000]  in the Orion belt said to me, don't take that vaccine. That's all I need. I don't need proof.
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:48.000]  I don't need anybody else to believe what I believe because freedom of religion is a
[3:36:48.000 --> 3:36:55.000]  foundational principle of American constitutional republic. And it's not for government or anyone
[3:36:55.000 --> 3:37:04.000]  to define religion. It's for me to define my conscience. That's the liberty. And we should
[3:37:04.000 --> 3:37:12.000]  not have to prove that to anyone. Now, does it substantiate it when you're doing an exemption?
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  Does it say, yes, you have the power and I'm exempting out of it? I mean, is that solidifying
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:26.000]  their stance in any way to do the exemption? Well, ideally, if we were operating under true
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  constitutional principles, then the question would never come up because we would be fully
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  aware that the government doesn't have the authority to mandate us to put things into our
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:45.000]  body in the same respect that the government doesn't have the authority to tell us what we
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:52.000]  can put in our body. So all these regulations that outlaw this drug, that drug, this natural
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:57.000]  remedy, that natural remedy are completely unconstitutional because these are the things
[3:37:57.000 --> 3:38:04.000]  that the people are supposed to have the liberty to engage in based on their own conscience.
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:11.000]  And so we're dealing now with two different realms. Under the Constitution, I shouldn't
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  have to ask for an exemption. But in the constitutional, in the lack of constitutional
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:24.000]  justification that our government operates in today, we are now in a situation where
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  we must seek exemptions. But let me be very clear, Kate, the time for making a stand is
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:39.000]  here. There's no more time to sit on the fence because we have an administration who is not
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:46.000]  caring about your religious beliefs. And in my humble opinion, wants to purge everyone
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:52.000]  with a moral standing from government office, from government employment, from employment
[3:38:52.000 --> 3:39:00.000]  forever. They're trying to kill small business with over-regulation and increased costs and
[3:39:00.000 --> 3:39:07.000]  consolidate everything into the big corporations that are in bed with government. And so we're
[3:39:07.000 --> 3:39:15.000]  going to have to be the people, Kate, who did what our founders did in 1770 and 1775
[3:39:15.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  and say, we're not going to be slaves to this system and we need employers, we need doctors,
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:31.000]  lawyers, we need nurses, we need farmers, ranchers, businessmen, pilots, planes, we need
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:37.000]  people in every avenue of commerce to step outside and say, we're going to have our own
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:43.000]  business, we're not going to give in to your medical bullying, we're not going to mandate
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:49.000]  this on our people. We could even have doctors, nurses set up their own clinics and hospitals
[3:39:49.000 --> 3:39:52.000]  and never have to mandate this stuff.
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  Oh, I love this. I love this. And so, you know, we did. We fought a bloody revolution to get
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:03.000]  these documents and these documents still stand the last time I checked. So are we at the point
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  where we fill the courts? We sue. We start coming up with thousands and tens of thousands
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  of court cases on this.
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:17.000]  You know, there's not really one answer. This is a multifaceted dynamic that has to take
[3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:23.000]  place and that's part of what we dress in our non-compliant movie at noncompliantmovie.com.
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  So, we have to, on an individual level, be willing to say we will not comply. We have
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:37.000]  to, as business owners, pull ourselves out of that system, like Ian Smith did, like the
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:42.000]  hairstylist did in Shelley Luther in Texas and say, I'm not complying and I don't care
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:47.000]  what kind of bully tactic to use, but I'm going to keep my business. And then we need
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:53.000]  sheriffs, like the sheriffs all over America are saying I'm not going to enforce these vaccinations.
[3:40:53.000 --> 3:40:57.000]  I'm not going to let any government shut down our businesses. I'm actually going to
[3:40:57.000 --> 3:41:04.000]  physically stand in defense of our businesses and my people. So, this has to be multifaceted.
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:11.000]  First, not peaceful noncompliance is the most powerful tool that we have. Second, file the
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:18.000]  lawsuits, exhaust every legal measure possible. Third, no matter the fraud you see, no matter
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:27.000]  how discouraged you are, you must remain actively involved and vigilant in the political
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:33.000]  process. The enemy wants you to check out. They want you to feel defeated. They want
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  you to feel discouraged. They want you to quit. Do not quit. The more people who are
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:45.000]  active, the more people who are voting, the more people who show up to meetings does nothing
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:53.000]  but actually expose this wicked platform and protocol that they have.
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  Amen. Wow. You're absolutely right. We don't need another bloody revolution. We need to
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  exhaust all of the things that we have now. And you know what? We actually have it fairly
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:08.000]  easy right now, don't we? We all have these luxuries and these comforts right now and
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:14.000]  we all have ways with social media to get a hold of each other, to gather together. And
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:20.000]  we need to use all of those things right now while it's still, while we still can, right?
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:27.000]  Absolutely. Wow. Harvard did a study over 100 years of history. Peaceful noncompliance
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:34.000]  is twice as likely to succeed as violent rebellion. This is why I have Chris Anhal.
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:41.000]  ChrisAnhal.com, LibertyFirstSociety.com, noncompliant, the movie Chris Anhal is amazing. And she's
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:46.000]  going around the country teaching, book her in your city, in your state, because I'll
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:50.000]  tell you what, you walk away feeling like we got this and we're going to do this and
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:53.000]  there are plenty of Americans out there that can't be right back down. I'll have you working
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:42:58.000]  on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something. I am so blessed
[3:42:58.000 --> 3:43:02.000]  and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years and
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:06.000]  it is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the
[3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:10.000]  listeners of this show. I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you. Whether
[3:43:10.000 --> 3:43:14.000]  you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you got red blood.
[3:43:14.000 --> 3:43:19.000]  And if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[3:43:19.000 --> 3:43:24.000]  and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:29.000]  the years. And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future. But again,
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:35.000]  that's really up to you and up to God. So please, I hope God works through you and puts
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:38.000]  a message in your heart to support us. But again, that's up to you and your relationship
[3:43:38.000 --> 3:43:42.000]  with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what
[3:43:42.000 --> 3:43:47.000]  you've done. And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you
[3:43:47.000 --> 3:43:52.000]  and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse. God bless.
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:57.000]  When Bob Woodward's new book came out, alleging that General Milley had called the head of
[3:43:57.000 --> 3:44:01.000]  the Chinese military and said, Trump might nuke you. You tried to overthrow the U.S.
[3:44:01.000 --> 3:44:05.000]  government. But basically, I'm protecting you and I'll warn you if we launch an attack,
[3:44:05.000 --> 3:44:10.000]  which was the greatest reason in U.S. history that has ever been committed. People said,
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:14.000]  oh, Alex, it must not be true. And I might wait. Bob Woodward's former naval intelligence,
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:18.000]  he's a big insider globalist. He wouldn't have put this out unless they wanted to put
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:22.000]  it out, say that Billy was a hero to set the precedent that you can have a permanent
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:27.000]  bureaucracy, stay behind Network Deep State, basically that has its own bureaucratic coup
[3:44:27.000 --> 3:44:31.000]  over America. That's why he put Biden. He's so incredibly weak to undermine the idea of
[3:44:31.000 --> 3:44:35.000]  the presidency. Well, people said I was making it up with Bob Woodward's line. Well, now
[3:44:35.000 --> 3:44:39.000]  Milley admits he did it. You see, I didn't need to trust Bob Woodward. I remember Pelosi
[3:44:39.000 --> 3:44:44.000]  on January 8th ragging that she'd gotten a call from Milley that he'd taken control of the nukes.
[3:44:44.000 --> 3:44:48.000]  So this treason was hiding and playing to you back then and we covered it. See, I have
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:53.000]  a memory folks. I remember all this stuff. That's why I know it's true and what's false.
[3:44:53.000 --> 3:44:57.000]  Gerald in South Carolina. Go ahead. You're on the air trying to move quicker. Hey, Alex.
[3:44:57.000 --> 3:45:02.000]  Welcome. Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:06.000]  stupidity wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year. Okay,
[3:45:06.000 --> 3:45:12.000]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:18.000]  Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[3:45:18.000 --> 3:45:24.000]  Living defense brought me back. I wanted to just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as
[3:45:24.000 --> 3:45:30.000]  to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24 verse nine. Then they shall deliver you up to
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:37.000]  be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[3:45:37.000 --> 3:45:43.000]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. That's
[3:45:43.000 --> 3:45:47.000]  right where we're at brother. And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country
[3:45:47.000 --> 3:45:53.000]  no matter what they say. And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[3:45:53.000 --> 3:45:59.000]  I'll tell you what's life and death. If you don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the right
[3:45:59.000 --> 3:46:04.000]  to be able to communicate, then you don't have a future. Always when governments take away
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:08.000]  their speech, they then enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating the
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:12.000]  population. And America, the entire world is going down the tubes because the U.N.
[3:46:12.000 --> 3:46:16.000]  Global has directed great reset. That's why it's more important than ever that Imphal
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:20.000]  War stay on the air and that all of us stay healthy. That's why I'm offering a bunch of

[3:47:12.000 --> 3:47:17.000]  Hi there. I'm too deli, your guest host for this hour and so happy to be with you. I want
[3:47:17.000 --> 3:47:23.000]  to tell you about something that is so explosive about the FDA and what they did with this so
[3:47:23.000 --> 3:47:28.000]  called approval of theirs. Let me just tell you, these are the things that we all need to know.
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:33.000]  These are the things that happen that go under the radar. And this is why it is so important
[3:47:33.000 --> 3:47:39.000]  to understand and be educated in what's going on. On October, I'm sorry, August 23rd, the
[3:47:39.000 --> 3:47:46.000]  media went out in this media blitz and pretty much granted this fact, right, that the FDA
[3:47:46.000 --> 3:47:54.000]  gave a full approval to Pfizer. And little Hitler man, I'm sorry, fake chief Fauci, was
[3:47:54.000 --> 3:48:02.000]  referred to as this decision as the final stamp of approval. Okay. Did that actually
[3:48:02.000 --> 3:48:09.000]  happen? Well, it's word wrangling, you know, if you're at a rodeo and it's, it's wordplay.
[3:48:09.000 --> 3:48:15.000]  Well, this was obviously politically motivated. My friend William Engdahl writes on this a
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:19.000]  lot. And let me just tell you, there are so many things to understand. So hat tip to him
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:25.000]  too on some of this information. But number one, there was no control group after Pfizer
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:32.000]  offered the product to placebo participants before the trials were completed. Yeah, they
[3:48:32.000 --> 3:48:39.000]  destroyed their own control group halfway through the process. And it's six month rollout of
[3:48:39.000 --> 3:48:45.000]  the mRNA jab worldwide has resulted in catastrophic side effects, which we all know about. And
[3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:49.000]  I'm reading about these daily, I'm getting letters daily, it's just pathetic, it's
[3:48:49.000 --> 3:48:55.000]  like me, what's going on. Stillborn deaths, I mean, you name it, all kinds of hard, you
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:48:59.000]  know, heart attacks, blood clots. Well, it seems that the FDA executed this very, very
[3:48:59.000 --> 3:49:06.000]  clever trick. And what it did was it issued separate rulings for Pfizer Inc. by biotech
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:12.000]  vaccine, which is widely used in the USA, and another ruling for the very similar vaccine
[3:49:12.000 --> 3:49:19.000]  or Pfizer's German based partner papers, please, a developer of the mRNA platform biotech,
[3:49:19.000 --> 3:49:28.000]  biotech mains, mains Germany. And so it is only biotech that got FDA approval, if you
[3:49:28.000 --> 3:49:34.000]  will. And, and then it was conditioned so people don't realize this, it was conditioned
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:40.000]  on completion of a series of further tests on select groups, including infants, pregnant
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:47.000]  women and youth. Oh my gosh, I hope they don't do that. By 2027, that US vaccine, Pfizer's
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:54.000]  biotech COVID-19 vaccine only got extension of its emergency use authorization. It did
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:50:00.000]  not get full approval. That's very, very important to know. And especially when your employer
[3:50:00.000 --> 3:50:05.000]  is saying, Oh, hey, you need to get this, it was FDA approved even. That's not true. It
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:10.000]  was an extension of the emergency order. And then buried into a footnote in the letter,
[3:50:10.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  the FDA admits there are two legally separate entities and vaccines, little, little bait
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:23.000]  and switch, and the Pfizer biotech COVID-19 and the biotech one of maze. The FDA writes
[3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:28.000]  that the products are legally distinct with certain differences. No, that's all differences.
[3:50:28.000 --> 3:50:34.000]  Honey, give me a break. Oh my gosh, the wordplay, it's confusing because it's supposed to be
[3:50:34.000 --> 3:50:40.000]  confusing. And the FDA refused to convene their advisory committee. They refused to put together
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:46.000]  that group of people for the Pfizer decision. It's even more astonishing because they did
[3:50:46.000 --> 3:50:52.000]  not want to have to discuss all the adverse reactions to this and the deaths, of course,
[3:50:52.000 --> 3:50:57.000]  which are growing in number every single day. So in two separate letters, one to biotech
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:51:04.000]  and another to Pfizer, the FDA repeatedly deleted the location of the vaccine manufacturing.
[3:51:04.000 --> 3:51:11.000]  What? Well, yeah, there's a, you know, little China involved. It's a little China around
[3:51:11.000 --> 3:51:18.000]  these parts where biotech has a joint agreement with Fosun Pharma of Shanghai to jointly produce
[3:51:18.000 --> 3:51:26.000]  and market the Comernati vaccine for COVID-19. So why did they need to hide the location?
[3:51:26.000 --> 3:51:32.000]  Now, I can come up with a lot of reasons. Anybody speak Chinese? Anyway, so did you know that
[3:51:32.000 --> 3:51:37.000]  Pfizer employees are exempt, that Congress is exempt, that their staff is exempt, that
[3:51:37.000 --> 3:51:43.000]  federal judges are exempt? I got into the wrong, wrong line of work here. Give me a break.
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:49.000]  Just because of your job, you're exempt. I'm sorry. Do COVID-19 cooties not come to you
[3:51:49.000 --> 3:51:54.000]  if you're a judge? I didn't know this. I should have been a judge or a member of Congress.
[3:51:54.000 --> 3:52:01.000]  No wonder they're so quiet. Quiet like crickets. Yeah, crickets. Anyway, not hearing much from them.
[3:52:01.000 --> 3:52:07.000]  So there's a couple of people, Susan Desmond Hellman, who headed the Bill Gates and Melinda,
[3:52:07.000 --> 3:52:12.000]  well, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2020, also behind this because she's on Pfizer's
[3:52:12.000 --> 3:52:18.000]  board of directors. There's also Holly Janes, who worked for, of course, Bill and Melinda,
[3:52:18.000 --> 3:52:25.000]  good old Billy, and, and then also was in charge of how they track the vaccine. Isn't that
[3:52:25.000 --> 3:52:29.000]  wonderful? Like how they, how they actually put all their information together. That's fun.
[3:52:29.000 --> 3:52:33.000]  And so by the way, I just wanted to mention once again, I remember tracking this from the
[3:52:33.000 --> 3:52:39.000]  very beginning from day one, and there it landed in Seattle. How perfect for the Gates Foundation?
[3:52:39.000 --> 3:52:45.000]  I mean, my gosh, if you could pick a state, well, I'd pick Seattle. I mean, my gosh, it's right there.
[3:52:45.000 --> 3:52:49.000]  But that's where it landed first. Remember the nursing home with the nine deaths? Yeah,
[3:52:49.000 --> 3:52:57.000]  I remember that. Also, it's worth noting too, that as of August, well, as of August 14th,
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:53:03.000]  they don't, Pfizer does not make its employees get this jab. Hmm. I should have been a Pfizer
[3:53:03.000 --> 3:53:09.000]  employee. So I also wanted to mention that researchers back in October were worried about
[3:53:09.000 --> 3:53:15.000]  the vaccine because of what's called vaccine associated disease enhancement. And this is
[3:53:15.000 --> 3:53:22.000]  really, really important to know. Fauci turned to his little friend from the 1980s, little,
[3:53:22.000 --> 3:53:29.000]  little, little buddy. And what he did was he hired his little buddy, Larry, Larry Corey,
[3:53:29.000 --> 3:53:36.000]  who heads the HVTN. You don't know what that is. Well, the HVTN is the HIV vaccine trials
[3:53:36.000 --> 3:53:44.000]  network. So what he did was these two little chums got together and designated HVTN as the
[3:53:44.000 --> 3:53:49.000]  entity that would run all of those rigorous tests on the COVID vaccine. Isn't that nice?
[3:53:49.000 --> 3:53:58.000]  And since 1999, HVTN, well, they haven't been very successful. I mean, they've been working.
[3:53:58.000 --> 3:54:02.000]  They've been working hard. They've been showing up. But as they've been showing up, they've worked
[3:54:02.000 --> 3:54:11.000]  on 75 different types of vaccines, never ever successful in the HIV arena. So obviously,
[3:54:11.000 --> 3:54:19.000]  they were the perfect pick for COVID-19 vaccine testing, weren't they? Anyway, so this flop
[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:25.000]  of a company that got lots of dollars along the way was designated because they were friends.
[3:54:25.000 --> 3:54:30.000]  I like that. And then the team built into this equation real time analysis, they said,
[3:54:30.000 --> 3:54:35.000]  we're going to go with real time analysis for testing. And they also concluded that,
[3:54:35.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  yep, we found nothing. No problems here. Well, real time testing for cancer for oncology
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:48.000]  means that the endpoints are easily interpreted, that the chemistry, manufacturing, control,
[3:54:48.000 --> 3:54:55.000]  formulation changes are excluded. Those are important things, right? Excluded. I wonder
[3:54:55.000 --> 3:55:01.000]  if they had the same kind of protocol for this. So they very, very quickly went through the
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  vaccine and really determined that nothing to see here, folks. But the problem is, look
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:14.000]  at the RSV vaccine, the clinical trial from 1965. This has been going for 50 years. And
[3:55:14.000 --> 3:55:21.000]  guess what, folks? Later on, what happened to the people? Well, what happened to the
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:29.000]  to the infants? Enhanced inflammatory response. Enhanced inflammatory response. Trick is,
[3:55:29.000 --> 3:55:34.000]  it didn't show up right away. So when they said, oh, real time analysis, yeah, nothing
[3:55:34.000 --> 3:55:39.000]  to see here. Well, that's because some of this shows up later. And so they don't know,
[3:55:39.000 --> 3:55:44.000]  they've even admitted with COVID. And I will put all these links on the Kate Dolly show
[3:55:44.000 --> 3:55:50.000]  notes so that you can see all these links. They don't know what features of an antigen
[3:55:50.000 --> 3:55:57.000]  will exacerbate exacerbate disease. They admit that they admit that with COVID. They say,
[3:55:57.000 --> 3:56:04.000]  you know, we still don't know after 50 years of this, what will be the catalyst, how this
[3:56:04.000 --> 3:56:10.000]  will affect people? Will it enhance disease? I have a pretty good feeling based on all
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:14.000]  the illness coming off of vaccinated people and vaccinated people themselves getting
[3:56:14.000 --> 3:56:21.000]  sick. I'm going to say that there's a very curious nod to the fact that yeah, yeah, I
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:27.000]  can see that we're exasperating, exasperating disease quite, quite handily right now. And
[3:56:27.000 --> 3:56:32.000]  so they have known this, they knew that if they just changed up the way that they studied
[3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:36.000]  this and tested this, they could come up with a way to shoot this out of the gate very,
[3:56:36.000 --> 3:56:40.000]  very quickly and say nothing to see here, folks. Well, I have a problem with that because
[3:56:40.000 --> 3:56:45.000]  there's a lot of adverse reactions and deaths going on right now that they will not talk
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:50.000]  about in the media. Those really pretty talking heads, they won't say a word about it. And
[3:56:50.000 --> 3:56:55.000]  I just wanted you guys to know the FDA, of course, and you've probably heard this, I'm
[3:56:55.000 --> 3:57:00.000]  sure I'm preaching to the choir, but the FDA did not fully approve this. It was an extension
[3:57:00.000 --> 3:57:06.000]  based on conditions for the emergency, the emergency issuance of it. And you know what?
[3:57:06.000 --> 3:57:12.000]  The testing done by a, by a company that hasn't succeeded in much are the ones that are telling
[3:57:12.000 --> 3:57:16.000]  you it's safe and effective. Just like all the doctors and nurses are telling you it's
[3:57:16.000 --> 3:57:21.000]  safe and effective. I don't believe that for a hot minute. Go to KateDallyRadio.com. Love
