[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.842]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.423]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.423 --> 00:00:12.303]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.303 --> 00:00:17.165]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:21.247]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.097 --> 00:00:29.377]  I say it all the time.
[00:00:29.377 --> 00:00:30.738]  Everybody says it.
[00:00:30.738 --> 00:00:33.538]  Time is just blasting past us.
[00:00:33.538 --> 00:00:37.879]  It's flying past us.
[00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.279]  Weeks are like hours now in my life.
[00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:42.520]  And it's not just adults.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.300]  You know, as we get older, the time seems to speed up.
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.641]  But it's young people are talking about experiencing it as well.
[00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:54.202]  The stock market has been up and down all morning.
[00:00:56.388 --> 00:01:04.435]  Back on Monday, of course, it rallied to close to 1,000 points, and since then has lost almost all of that.
[00:01:04.435 --> 00:01:17.126]  It's at 8,000, it's actually lost more than that, 8,424.11 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but it had lost as many as 400 points earlier in the day.
[00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:19.929]  It's risen back up to only be 153.80 points.
[00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:29.381]  Below its previous close yesterday, the Nasdaq is down 1,616.
[00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:30.201]  It's down to 1,616, down 11.95%.
[00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:31.082]  S&P is 890.78, down 17.06 points.
[00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:35.566]  So we will continue to watch that and track that as it develops.
[00:01:52.308 --> 00:02:02.754]  Coming up later in the radio show today, in two hours, in studio, we have former Travis County Sheriff Raymond Franks in studio with us.
[00:02:02.754 --> 00:02:08.638]  He was also a combat pilot, booking a record member of combat missions.
[00:02:08.638 --> 00:02:11.640]  He was also in the military investigative arm.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.482]  And of course, he was a Travis County Sheriff.
[00:02:14.482 --> 00:02:19.945]  And he's running again, and he is absolutely, totally anti-New World Order.
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.984]  Says he'll ban tasers in Travis County used by the Sheriff's deputies.
[00:02:24.984 --> 00:02:33.451]  They're already heavily restricting them in a whole bunch of different police departments, right as they were proliferating, because so many deaths are associated with them.
[00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:41.859]  That should be an interesting discussion with former Travis County Sheriff Raymond Franks, who again is running for Travis County Sheriff.
[00:02:42.623 --> 00:02:47.506]  And this is not just a local Travis County issue for Central Texas, the seat of government here.
[00:02:47.506 --> 00:03:01.755]  It's an issue for what sheriffs could be nationwide, and how they are an elective representative and guardian of the people, and are above the mayors that reside in the counties, and above anyone else in the county.
[00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:09.739]  They really are the most empowered type government official within the Constitution.
[00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.041]  I mean, they really do have
[00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:26.526]  Uh, martial law type powers, but only because it is vested in the sheriff because he is elected by the county and answers directly to the people.
[00:03:26.526 --> 00:03:32.770]  That's why the feds have moved to get rid of sheriffs in many states to phase them out, merge them into the cities.
[00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.372]  The city is an incorporation, a private corporation.
[00:03:36.144 --> 00:03:40.806]  It is chartered under the state and under the county, which is chartered under the state.
[00:03:40.806 --> 00:03:48.609]  And so it is a creature of the state and the people's legislature.
[00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.591]  So we'll break some of that down today.
[00:03:51.591 --> 00:03:54.432]  You know, I just got an idea, Trey.
[00:03:54.432 --> 00:03:56.493]  Trey listening, my producer in the other room.
[00:03:56.493 --> 00:04:01.735]  Let's get... I know Raymond Franks is scheduled to be on with us for an hour in studio.
[00:04:01.735 --> 00:04:04.376]  We'll keep him longer if we can get Red Beckman on.
[00:04:05.754 --> 00:04:14.238]  For thirty minutes into the next hour, into the fourth hour today, the two o'clock hour, to discuss the position of the sheriff.
[00:04:14.238 --> 00:04:21.321]  And there have been some sheriffs, like Richard Mack and others, that have said no to unconstitutional gun control and other instances.
[00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:25.943]  So it'll be a wider discussion about that today.
[00:04:25.943 --> 00:04:34.006]  That said, I'm going to come back and give you the latest economic news, and then I'm going to wade back into, probably not for the last time, Zeitgeist.
[00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:51.596]  I really think I was too nice to the maker of that, and I should have done even more research on it before I had him on, because I did end up doing some more research last night, and I was blown away by what I found.
[00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:54.237]  I mean, blown away isn't even a word.
[00:04:54.237 --> 00:04:55.598]  This is very serious.
[00:04:55.598 --> 00:04:56.398]  We'll be talking about it.
[00:05:02.316 --> 00:05:04.877]  They say you can't predict the stock market.
[00:05:04.877 --> 00:05:08.338]  If you trade on a regular basis, you've probably heard that lie.
[00:05:08.338 --> 00:05:13.959]  But what if I told you there's a way to know which way the market will go each week, a whole week in advance?
[00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:16.740]  Do you think you could benefit from this kind of information?
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.321]  The guys over at E-mini-forecaster.com put out a weekly forecast line.
[00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:26.683]  They call it a G-line, which forecasts the direction of the stock market a whole week in advance.
[00:05:26.683 --> 00:05:27.183]  Impossible?
[00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:32.826]  Head over to e-mini-forecaster.com and check out their forecast history to see for yourself.
[00:05:32.826 --> 00:05:37.088]  e-mini-forecaster.com predicts the market one whole week in advance.
[00:05:37.088 --> 00:05:41.050]  It's simple to use and can give you the market edge you've been looking for.
[00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.753]  If you're an active trader in the markets, go directly to e-mini-forecaster.com.
[00:05:45.753 --> 00:05:50.255]  That's e-m-i-n-i-forecaster.com right now for more information.
[00:05:50.255 --> 00:05:53.477]  Again, that's e-m-i-n-i-forecaster.com.
[00:05:55.402 --> 00:06:00.466]  This is Rob at eminyforecaster.com, and I approve this message.
[00:06:00.466 --> 00:06:02.628]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:05.030]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.352]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:06:07.352 --> 00:06:08.873]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:06:08.873 --> 00:06:10.575]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:06:10.575 --> 00:06:13.497]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:06:13.497 --> 00:06:17.100]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:06:26.765 --> 00:06:32.909]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:35.430]  An inside job?
[00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.871]  How dare you?
[00:06:37.871 --> 00:06:43.094]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:06:43.094 --> 00:06:45.716]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:06:51.278 --> 00:06:52.299]  Truth Rising.
[00:06:52.299 --> 00:06:55.122]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:06:55.122 --> 00:06:57.404]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:06:57.404 --> 00:06:59.907]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:04.113]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[00:07:04.113 --> 00:07:11.858]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[00:07:11.858 --> 00:07:19.684]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[00:07:19.684 --> 00:07:25.968]  At HempUSA.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[00:07:26.588 --> 00:07:33.354]  Please call 1-908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds and oil can do for you.
[00:07:33.354 --> 00:07:36.176]  Beware, be smart and be ready.
[00:07:36.176 --> 00:07:38.258]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org.
[00:07:42.521 --> 00:07:48.866]  Families need this high-quality natural food source for its low price and long storage shelf life.
[00:07:48.866 --> 00:07:52.830]  This incredible food source should be a staple part of your diet every day.
[00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:59.235]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today.
[00:07:59.235 --> 00:08:07.442]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:23.669]  Let's do something a little bit different today.
[00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:39.713]  I try this routinely and rarely succeed because I have so much news and information that I'll start covering one article and then it'll lead into 10 or 15 different subjects and then two, three hours it's gone by and we haven't taken your calls.
[00:08:39.713 --> 00:08:48.734]  I want to give everybody a chance to call in about the economy, about the election, about the ridiculous debate with only 19 days to go until the election.
[00:08:48.734 --> 00:08:51.395]  Do you think the electronic voting machines are going to cheat for McCain?
[00:08:52.148 --> 00:08:54.169]  Do you think the establishment is behind Obama?
[00:08:54.169 --> 00:08:57.351]  No doubting that, the media tube.
[00:08:57.351 --> 00:09:02.014]  If he doesn't get elected for some strange reason, will there be riots in the country?
[00:09:02.014 --> 00:09:06.457]  What did you think of my discussion with the Zeitgeist Fellow yesterday?
[00:09:06.457 --> 00:09:17.605]  We can discuss it all in this first hour, and then when I start the second hour, I'm going to get into Zeitgeist again.
[00:09:17.605 --> 00:09:19.606]  And why am I talking about this?
[00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:32.813]  Well, number one, when the film came out... Well, here I'm about to cover it all right now, but no, I'm gonna do it next hour.
[00:09:32.813 --> 00:09:45.937]  When the film came out, it made fun of Christians and, you know, it was just really savage towards Christians particularly, not just religion in general, but religion in general.
[00:09:45.937 --> 00:09:49.578]  And a lot of my film footage, a lot of clips from my films were used in it.
[00:09:52.512 --> 00:09:54.753]  And I decided not to weigh in on it.
[00:09:54.753 --> 00:10:00.735]  I decided to leave it alone, and to not attack the maker of it.
[00:10:00.735 --> 00:10:06.137]  And then I got attacked, for my footage being in it, by Christians.
[00:10:06.137 --> 00:10:11.879]  Who were establishment types, you know, good at judging.
[00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:17.681]  Because my footage was in there, when I had no control over that.
[00:10:17.681 --> 00:10:22.223]  And then, the new Zeitgeist came out,
[00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:38.292]  And, Jason Burmiss, who, you know, is not really a religious guy, called me up about two weeks ago, and he said, about three weeks ago, he said, have you seen this?
[00:10:38.292 --> 00:10:42.575]  He goes, oh my gosh, it's total New World Order.
[00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:43.896]  And I said, what do you mean?
[00:10:43.896 --> 00:10:46.397]  And he said, you gotta see it.
[00:10:46.397 --> 00:10:52.061]  And he, because Jason really has studied the New World Order, he's studied their, their theosophic Luciferian religion,
[00:10:53.323 --> 00:10:55.605]  And he said, man, this is everything we've heard before.
[00:10:55.605 --> 00:10:58.067]  This is like high-level UN religion stuff.
[00:10:58.067 --> 00:11:00.729]  This is what the big guys are into.
[00:11:00.729 --> 00:11:01.810]  He says, you gotta watch it.
[00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:06.894]  So a couple days later, I saw a link to it on one of my comment pages on InfoWars.
[00:11:06.894 --> 00:11:14.780]  So I sat back and watched about 80% of it with the phones ringing and, you know, also taking care of business at night.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:19.284]  I got a halfway, watched it, and I was like, man, I've heard all of this before from H.G.
[00:11:19.284 --> 00:11:21.685]  Wells and from
[00:11:22.927 --> 00:11:29.130]  The Theosophic Society and from Masonic Organizations.
[00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.852]  And I said, well, I'll just, you know, make a comment on it.
[00:11:31.852 --> 00:11:44.839]  Then I think the guy's nice and overall has some good messages about the banking system and the 9-11, but this is kind of scary and maybe we should warn these guys that they may, you know, be going down a primrose path here.
[00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:48.621]  And then I did cover it.
[00:11:48.621 --> 00:11:49.922]  And then, boy, I got attacked.
[00:11:52.941 --> 00:11:57.986]  About how I'm an idiot Texan, and I'm a knuckle-dragging Christian.
[00:11:57.986 --> 00:12:04.231]  And folks, I mean, I'm gonna toot my horn, but we don't just make films about things, we predict them before they happen.
[00:12:04.231 --> 00:12:14.440]  You know, I bring on experts, Nobel Prize winners, people from wide ranges of industry and society, and they're always amazed at my generalist knowledge.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.965]  And that doesn't really come from being innately some type of genius, it comes from hard study and researching world systems.
[00:12:21.306 --> 00:12:25.187]  And I don't put on an affected, you know, fake intellectual accent.
[00:12:25.187 --> 00:12:26.868]  I don't wear sandals and have dreadlocks.
[00:12:26.868 --> 00:12:28.909]  I'm not saying you're bad if you have sandals and dreadlocks.
[00:12:28.909 --> 00:12:32.130]  I'm just saying, I don't put on airs.
[00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:38.412]  But I always love the pseudo-intellectuals who are just into talking like this.
[00:12:38.412 --> 00:12:42.013]  And then they attack me as just, you know, you piece of garbage Christian.
[00:12:42.013 --> 00:12:43.074]  You're a moron.
[00:12:43.074 --> 00:12:47.235]  You don't have any right to comment on this because you're an idiot because you're a Christian.
[00:12:47.235 --> 00:12:49.836]  And I'm like, hey, wait a minute.
[00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:50.136]  I, you know,
[00:12:51.872 --> 00:12:58.256]  I'm not even judging you and saying you're a bad person because you're attacking Christianity.
[00:12:58.256 --> 00:13:02.979]  I'm just saying I see a lot of New World Order symbolism and Illuminati terminology here.
[00:13:02.979 --> 00:13:06.402]  In fact, it's dripping with it, both films.
[00:13:06.402 --> 00:13:17.269]  And I want to critique this and comment on it and just saying I'm a moron because I'm a Christian.
[00:13:18.809 --> 00:13:39.409]  I mean, there have been Christians who have invented hundreds of thousands of famous inventions and technologies and systems and... I mean, to say that somebody's a Hindu or they're a Christian or they're a Muslim, they're automatically dumb or stupid is really asinine.
[00:13:39.409 --> 00:13:43.753]  And so the people that are supporting the parts of Zeitgeist I and II that I don't agree with
[00:13:44.565 --> 00:13:47.666]  They never counter any of the evidence of the information we bring forward.
[00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:52.927]  They just say, look, you aren't allowed to comment because you are a religionist.
[00:13:52.927 --> 00:14:03.631]  You believe in, you know, something more than just what we limited, you know, perceive with our five senses.
[00:14:03.631 --> 00:14:08.572]  Well, then last night I decided to do a couple hours of research and I have done a great disservice.
[00:14:08.572 --> 00:14:10.993]  I have been too nice about Zeitgeist.
[00:14:10.993 --> 00:14:11.393]  I did not
[00:14:12.304 --> 00:14:24.591]  I mean, he didn't pass the smell test, but then I finally looked in the trash can and rumbled around in it, and I'm going to do some more, and it is pure Illuminati New World Order 110%.
[00:14:24.591 --> 00:14:38.159]  And an attempt to co-opt the giant liberty movement that, like it or not, was started by Christians who shattered the left-right paradigm and saw the system and
[00:14:39.185 --> 00:14:44.707]  Basically started this entire revolution that we see today, because they had discernment and understanding.
[00:14:44.707 --> 00:14:48.049]  I don't mean the phony pulpit prostitutes of the New World Order people.
[00:14:48.049 --> 00:15:01.034]  So I was too nice, and I'm gonna do several weeks of research on and off in between filmmaking, having a big event coming up next week, doing the radio shows, trying to finish up the radio and TV studios we're building.
[00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:06.757]  I'm gonna do even more research, and I'm gonna make like a 20-minute documentary for the web to deal with it,
[00:15:07.994 --> 00:15:09.314]  Because it has to be dealt with.
[00:15:09.314 --> 00:15:36.239]  Ladies and gentlemen, in two hours of research last night, I found out that the guy at the beginning and the end of the film alone was the world Christ of the Theosophic Society, and Blavatsky, and then her acolytes, and then he went around the world as the Christ, the universal Christ, for world government, and that this is the highest UN
[00:15:38.175 --> 00:15:41.939]  Luciferian capstone group.
[00:15:41.939 --> 00:15:51.728]  Now maybe the maker of this doesn't know that, Peter Joseph, but I doubt that because there's pyramids, there's constant clips.
[00:15:51.728 --> 00:15:54.871]  Let's just do part of this now and the rest is coming up next hour.
[00:15:54.871 --> 00:16:03.799]  Play that clip, the new Zeitgeist clip I sent you, John.
[00:16:04.562 --> 00:16:06.563]  Now, I mean, and the films are riddled with this.
[00:16:06.563 --> 00:16:08.284]  Now, this is what I'm saying.
[00:16:08.284 --> 00:16:14.687]  Listen to me, Zeitgeist, uh, Acolytes, you know, Z-Day, uh, Stormtroopers.
[00:16:14.687 --> 00:16:15.987]  Listen to me.
[00:16:15.987 --> 00:16:17.668]  The whole thing is religious.
[00:16:17.668 --> 00:16:18.748]  It is religious.
[00:16:18.748 --> 00:16:25.171]  They believe it's a reincarnation, sun group, sun cult.
[00:16:25.171 --> 00:16:28.333]  It's... These are Lucifer worshippers.
[00:16:28.333 --> 00:16:31.094]  I mean, the... This is incredible.
[00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:32.922]  Right in our face!
[00:16:32.922 --> 00:16:35.443]  And again, I hadn't really researched it.
[00:16:35.443 --> 00:16:40.805]  I just saw the new one and was like, man, this is some New World Order stuff.
[00:16:40.805 --> 00:16:44.707]  And then I was basically told, oh, you're not an intellectual, you can't even grasp it.
[00:16:44.707 --> 00:16:53.711]  So you're mindless if you believe in, quote, any religion, but the one true religion, which is what Albert Pike and Blavatsky and the rest of them put out.
[00:16:54.577 --> 00:16:56.038]  So let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:16:56.038 --> 00:16:56.238]  God?
[00:16:56.238 --> 00:16:56.398]  Spirit?
[00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:27.571]  So I knew that I'd watch the new one and went, whoo, man, that stinks!
[00:17:27.571 --> 00:17:37.013]  But they mix in 9-11 truth, mix in the monetary fraud of the private Federal Reserve running its scam, and they blame that on free market.
[00:17:37.013 --> 00:17:39.873]  I was like, whoo, man, that stinks!
[00:17:39.873 --> 00:17:52.576]  Hey, did you know that, you know, A, B, and C's really connected to what New World Order acolytes have always put out, and we've heard all this before, and withering away of the state and eradicating classes, and I said yesterday, what happens if somebody doesn't want them?
[00:17:53.194 --> 00:17:54.475]  You know, be part of this brave new world.
[00:17:54.475 --> 00:17:56.475]  He said, well, they'll be reconditioned, re-educated.
[00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:57.396]  Yesterday!
[00:17:57.396 --> 00:18:00.817]  Re-educated!
[00:18:00.817 --> 00:18:01.697]  Re-education!
[00:18:01.697 --> 00:18:03.538]  Withering away of states!
[00:18:03.538 --> 00:18:06.719]  Eradication of the class system!
[00:18:06.719 --> 00:18:11.261]  There's a comment about, you know, things that are bad and the family stuck in the middle of it.
[00:18:11.261 --> 00:18:13.042]  And then there's denials about all that.
[00:18:13.042 --> 00:18:14.162]  But listen, it's over!
[00:18:14.162 --> 00:18:22.706]  I demand the Zeitgeist worshippers tell me why the Blavatsky cult, Theosophic Society, Universal Christ,
[00:18:26.329 --> 00:18:36.297]  I demand to know how I'm bad because I believe in Jesus Christ, but I've got to... No religion exists, nothing's real but your Christ.
[00:18:36.297 --> 00:18:41.902]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:18:41.902 --> 00:18:45.565]  And I've got it all here in front of me.
[00:18:45.565 --> 00:18:47.226]  Alice Bailey, all of them.
[00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:52.611]  I mean, this is the official, the only religion the UN gave headquarters at the UN facilities worldwide.
[00:18:53.186 --> 00:18:58.588]  I mean, this is the Illuminati religion.
[00:18:58.588 --> 00:19:01.689]  And throughout it are religious comments.
[00:19:01.689 --> 00:19:03.909]  And they tell us, none of your religions are real.
[00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:07.050]  You're all stupid fools, unintellectual, for being in a religion.
[00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:11.451]  And then it's dripping with religion.
[00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:18.974]  Filled with religion.
[00:19:18.974 --> 00:19:20.474]  But again, I don't speak with a lisp.
[00:19:23.902 --> 00:19:26.903]  So, I'm not allowed to have an opinion.
[00:19:26.903 --> 00:19:49.432]  I'm just some ancient, you know, old tradition, mindless Christian, you know, I... But just coldly, intellectually, scientifically, you go and look at who these people are and what they push, and the name of it, the Venus Project, which is the Morning Star, which is what Lucifer's called.
[00:19:49.432 --> 00:19:49.792]  All of it!
[00:19:51.031 --> 00:19:52.252]  All of it!
[00:19:52.252 --> 00:19:56.516]  Every single bit of it!
[00:19:56.516 --> 00:19:57.657]  And, uh, I'm sorry.
[00:19:57.657 --> 00:20:01.019]  I stand against Z-Day.
[00:20:01.019 --> 00:20:04.282]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[00:20:04.282 --> 00:20:07.765]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:07.765 --> 00:20:10.407]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:20:10.407 --> 00:20:11.948]  But who is the enemy?
[00:20:11.948 --> 00:20:12.729]  Bin Laden.
[00:20:12.729 --> 00:20:13.629]  This is his ammo.
[00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:15.131]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:16.732]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:24.239]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:20:24.239 --> 00:20:24.720]  Some U.S.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:31.086]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:20:31.086 --> 00:20:34.530]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:45.059]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:46.280]  Fabled enemies.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:53.827]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:53.827 --> 00:20:57.410]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:21:00.728 --> 00:21:09.997]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:21:09.997 --> 00:21:17.465]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never
[00:21:17.585 --> 00:21:18.165]  I don't know it.
[00:21:18.165 --> 00:21:22.749]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[00:21:22.749 --> 00:21:25.511]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:37.079]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[00:21:37.079 --> 00:21:43.284]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.

[00:22:00.811 --> 00:22:03.052]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:22:03.052 --> 00:22:03.432]  October 16, 2008.
[00:22:03.432 --> 00:22:04.793]  Gold opened this morning at $834.70.
[00:22:04.793 --> 00:22:06.354]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $859.55.
[00:22:06.354 --> 00:22:08.215]  $429.78 for half ounce and $214.89 for quarter ounce.
[00:22:08.215 --> 00:22:08.495]  That's $859.55, $429.78, and $214.89.
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:24.125]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:22:24.125 --> 00:22:28.468]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a yon revolution.
[00:22:28.468 --> 00:22:36.394]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:22:36.394 --> 00:22:38.776]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:22:39.036 --> 00:22:42.859]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:22:42.859 --> 00:22:49.144]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[00:22:49.144 --> 00:22:52.466]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.466 --> 00:22:55.508]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[00:22:55.508 --> 00:22:55.768]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:55.768 --> 00:22:55.949]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.832 --> 00:23:05.713]  Phase one of the Insiders' plan for a one-world government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:23:05.713 --> 00:23:13.195]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior.
[00:23:13.195 --> 00:23:14.816]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:23:14.816 --> 00:23:18.937]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:23:18.937 --> 00:23:22.778]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:23:22.778 --> 00:23:26.819]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:23:27.259 --> 00:23:31.580]  Phase 1 is a one-world currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.721]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[00:23:35.721 --> 00:23:40.383]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.
[00:23:40.383 --> 00:23:46.144]  That's www.foodshortageusa.com to learn how to prepare for the unthinkable.
[00:23:46.144 --> 00:23:47.705]  Don't wait for empty shelves.
[00:23:47.705 --> 00:23:50.725]  Learn how to make your own survival foods for pennies on the dollar.
[00:23:50.725 --> 00:23:53.466]  Go to foodshortageusa.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:23:56.807 --> 00:23:57.428]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:23:57.428 --> 00:24:09.021]  We have a very important radio show lined up in the third and fourth hours a day in studio.
[00:24:09.021 --> 00:24:11.224]  Former Travis County Sheriff Raymond Frank
[00:24:11.684 --> 00:24:12.165]  We're good to go.
[00:24:39.844 --> 00:24:47.867]  We're going to have Officer Jack McClam, the most decorated officer in Phoenix, Arizona history, cop of the year twice.
[00:24:47.867 --> 00:24:54.530]  He's going to come on and talk about that with Sheriff Frank in the second half of the interview, the last 30 minutes of the show, with Jack McClam.
[00:24:54.530 --> 00:25:00.813]  I'm going to get his take on the open calls for martial law, Congress being threatened with martial law, and the rest of it.
[00:25:00.813 --> 00:25:05.795]  You already did 12-14 minutes on Zeitgeist Addendum.
[00:25:05.795 --> 00:25:07.696]  Next hour, I'm going to spend a lot of time on it.
[00:25:09.013 --> 00:25:17.260]  In the next segment I'm going to open the phones up about whatever you want to talk about at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:28.068]  But just in closing on the Zeitgeist thing before I properly cover it, coming up in the next hour, is Jeddu Krishnamurti.
[00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:33.532]  And he is the Christ of the Theosophic Society of the United Nations.
[00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:36.335]  Now we have Benjamin Crimm for decades running around saying there's a new
[00:25:37.931 --> 00:25:42.394]  Christ, a Mahdi, a Buddha, depending, again, they're universal.
[00:25:42.394 --> 00:26:06.114]  They're a Mahdi to the Muslims, the Christ to the Christians, and they say this, and the Buddha to the Hindus, and they basically, their tradition is to go out, it's kind of copying the Tibetans, they'll just go out by some river or some mountain and just pick some child they claim has the aura, and it's really just the cults use this as their front
[00:26:06.604 --> 00:26:10.047]  You gotta bring him around like a sideshow to him.
[00:26:10.047 --> 00:26:12.068]  Generally, you know, trendy intellectuals and people.
[00:26:12.068 --> 00:26:17.792]  If you read it, it's rocket scientists and engineers and, you know, that's who's involved in all of this.
[00:26:17.792 --> 00:26:22.255]  And United Nations people and Maury Strong and Adolf Hitler.
[00:26:22.255 --> 00:26:25.418]  I mean, just a who's who.
[00:26:25.418 --> 00:26:26.158]  Henry Ford.
[00:26:26.158 --> 00:26:26.799]  It doesn't matter.
[00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:28.560]  I mean, they're into this.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.661]  This is the elite religion.
[00:26:29.661 --> 00:26:31.582]  It's the opposite.
[00:26:31.582 --> 00:26:32.883]  And Madame Blavatsky.
[00:26:33.948 --> 00:26:35.549]  And this is the Christ!
[00:26:35.549 --> 00:26:36.889]  The Christ!
[00:26:36.889 --> 00:26:39.090]  He is the Lord!
[00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:45.674]  That he was the coming one and then he died in the 80's and he's, you know, been re-carnated, supposedly, gonna save us all.
[00:26:45.674 --> 00:26:46.014]  Ha!
[00:26:46.014 --> 00:26:55.518]  I mean, re-carnation, uh, universal Christ, all this stuff, and he starts Zeitgeist and ends it?
[00:26:55.518 --> 00:26:59.180]  And then there's Illuminati stuff throughout it, I'm already getting off into it, I just...
[00:27:00.902 --> 00:27:08.106]  I mean, I'm sorry, if I see something and I know it's New World Order, just... The first time I opened the box, I'm going, oh, God!
[00:27:08.106 --> 00:27:13.909]  I thought, well, I'll be friendly, they mean well, you know, it's anti-Fellow Reserve, and we're talking about 9-11 in an inside job.
[00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:19.291]  But see, that's the... Whether intentionally or not, that's the bait.
[00:27:19.291 --> 00:27:26.015]  And I should have countered this, you know, years ago, when it first came out, and they had to admit they got it all wrong about Christians and the gods, and had to change it.
[00:27:27.572 --> 00:27:29.554]  It was, quote, a mistake.
[00:27:29.554 --> 00:27:32.957]  I guess we can believe it was an accident to get it all wrong.
[00:27:32.957 --> 00:27:33.758]  But I ignored all that.
[00:27:33.758 --> 00:27:36.580]  I said, you know, I'm not getting into these big fights with people.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.902]  And then it grew and grew and grew.
[00:27:37.902 --> 00:27:39.243]  And then another one comes out.
[00:27:39.243 --> 00:27:42.326]  And clearly the addendum is the real film.
[00:27:42.326 --> 00:27:46.249]  That that's the one.
[00:27:46.249 --> 00:27:48.792]  And God help us.
[00:27:48.792 --> 00:27:51.014]  And so I will have, if you'll come back on,
[00:27:53.832 --> 00:27:57.095]  I'll have Peter Joseph back on this week, next week, sometime.
[00:27:57.095 --> 00:28:02.360]  But I mean, it's going to be... No more Mr. Nice Guy.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:08.006]  I mean, I joked around and screwed around in that discussion yesterday.
[00:28:08.006 --> 00:28:16.534]  And was just blown away by him, you know, talking about re-education and, you know, I'd have to be taken in condition and re-educated and withering away of the state.
[00:28:17.386 --> 00:28:25.873]  And that's what they did a hundred years ago, is they'd have these same intellectuals, and they'd show little models of spaceships, and super cities, and Stalin did that, and I'm like, hey man, I've heard all this before!
[00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:37.241]  No, you just can't even grasp it, because you're a Christian, and that has, that has diseased your mind, where you can't even grasp what's going on with the false precept of religion.
[00:28:37.241 --> 00:28:39.103]  Meanwhile, these guys are completely religious!
[00:28:43.433 --> 00:28:45.534]  But that's what the Theosophic Society says.
[00:28:45.534 --> 00:28:48.034]  They say every other religion is fake and false.
[00:28:48.034 --> 00:28:49.955]  We are the one truth.
[00:28:49.955 --> 00:28:53.056]  And we are reincarnations, and Lucifer's gonna save us.
[00:28:53.056 --> 00:28:58.957]  Now, uh, maybe... Peter Joseph doesn't know all this.
[00:28:58.957 --> 00:29:04.279]  But I mean, bottom line to all the atheists out there, who've got on the board with the Zeitgeist, saying it's atheistic.
[00:29:04.279 --> 00:29:05.939]  It's not!
[00:29:05.939 --> 00:29:07.420]  It's inherently anti-Christian.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:11.041]  And I've always noticed that the atheists, that's inherently what they are.
[00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:12.261]  That's inherently who they go after.
[00:29:13.712 --> 00:29:36.480]  Regardless of that, is it intellectually fair to sit there and belittle everyone, because of family or whatever reasons, you know, culture has a particular religious system, to then be filled with your own New World Order religion?
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.020]  I mean, that's just unbelievable.
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.381]  So that's coming up in the
[00:29:41.428 --> 00:29:43.030]  In the next hour, I'm going to spend some time on that.
[00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.811]  And I'm going to try to get Jason Burmess online, too.
[00:29:44.811 --> 00:29:46.713]  He's just been freaking out over this.
[00:29:46.713 --> 00:29:51.157]  All right, we'll be right back.
[00:29:51.157 --> 00:29:52.558]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.558 --> 00:29:55.080]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.783]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.993 --> 00:30:01.193]  Let's
[00:30:18.541 --> 00:30:18.941]  I think so.

[00:31:02.938 --> 00:31:06.419]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:31:06.419 --> 00:31:08.400]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.041]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:31:12.041 --> 00:31:17.783]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:31:17.783 --> 00:31:22.024]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:33:20.442 --> 00:33:22.583]  The latest is Fabled Enemies.
[00:33:22.583 --> 00:33:28.107]  It tells how the intelligence agencies ran the 9-11 attacks, how continuity of government was implemented on that day.
[00:33:29.495 --> 00:33:30.695]  All the attacks were carried out.
[00:33:30.695 --> 00:33:32.116]  It's just such an important film.
[00:33:32.116 --> 00:33:37.518]  Available at Infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[00:33:54.983 --> 00:33:57.524]  All these heavy hitters like Martin Sheen and
[00:34:00.749 --> 00:34:02.350]  The list goes on and on.
[00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:12.738]  People like George Carlin, people like the head of Democracy Now!, Amy Goodman, Michael Moore, Jesse Ventura.
[00:34:12.738 --> 00:34:14.179]  I mean, the list goes on.
[00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:15.400]  Willie Nelson.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.182]  All of these incredibly prominent people.
[00:34:19.082 --> 00:34:19.522]  I don't think so.
[00:34:37.017 --> 00:34:37.277]  I think so.
[00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:57.907]  Terror Storm, the preeminent film overall on government-sponsored terror, the history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:34:57.907 --> 00:35:03.590]  These films will not be seen unless you get them, make copies of them, and give them to neighbors, friends, people in your community.
[00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:04.930]  And a lot of you have already done that.
[00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:05.811]  Intensify your effort.
[00:35:05.811 --> 00:35:11.493]  People are really ready to listen now.

[00:35:22.785 --> 00:35:24.206]  888-253-3139.
[00:35:24.206 --> 00:35:34.611]  For the last few years, we've been warning you about the subprime mortgage situation and how the Bilderberg Group was going to implode that by design.
[00:35:34.611 --> 00:35:44.297]  They were then going to implode the credit card market, the business loan market, as well as car loan market.
[00:35:45.553 --> 00:35:57.237]  And Business Week came out a few days ago and did report the central banks are consolidating power and making huge profits right now and that they actually like what's happening.
[00:35:57.237 --> 00:36:07.000]  And then they can have a political excuse to give themselves unlimited liquidity while they cut off funds to the rest of the economy so they can consolidate things.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.121]  They have currency, we don't.
[00:36:10.121 --> 00:36:14.723]  A depression in the real economy, a huge infusion of fiat currency into the banking system,
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:21.189]  Then they can buy up real assets before the currency is fully devalued.
[00:36:21.189 --> 00:36:22.909]  And that is in Businessweek.
[00:36:22.909 --> 00:36:26.450]  Again, yesterday, I just couldn't believe they were telling the truth in there.
[00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:29.651]  Another story here from CNBC.
[00:36:29.651 --> 00:36:34.012]  Credit cards could become next trouble spot in crisis.
[00:36:34.012 --> 00:36:39.314]  Credit card delinquencies are likely to become the next flashpoint, and there's over a trillion dollars in those.
[00:36:39.314 --> 00:36:44.595]  But the impact of the overall economy won't be as severe as the housing slump analysts believe.
[00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:46.170]  Yeah, right.
[00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:52.113]  As the economy worsens and unemployment rises, more Americans are having trouble paying off their credit cards and their balances.
[00:36:52.113 --> 00:36:59.896]  That has pushed up losses for credit card issuers, forced them to tighten standards, which puts a further squeeze on cash-strapped consumers.
[00:36:59.896 --> 00:37:09.180]  See, not only did the private banks loan out money to people that didn't have any credit, they then sold
[00:37:10.356 --> 00:37:17.239]  Those debts as securitized AAA rated means the highest quality investment.
[00:37:17.239 --> 00:37:19.800]  So that's why they would send it to the teenager.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.221]  That's why they'd send it to the person with no job.
[00:37:22.221 --> 00:37:25.523]  That's why once you're solvent, they don't send you as many credit cards.
[00:37:25.523 --> 00:37:34.467]  Because they get to get you into debt, they get to sell the securities into derivatives, they get to leverage that.
[00:37:35.703 --> 00:37:47.208]  And then they, quote, get bailed out as the re- again, currency, liquidity, credit has been cut off to companies, individuals, and I couldn't believe it.
[00:37:47.208 --> 00:37:52.030]  I'm gonna go to your calls in a moment.
[00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.630]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:59.793]  I was watching CNBC this morning at about 9.30.
[00:37:59.793 --> 00:38:04.015]  For those that t-voted, I wish I put it on YouTube, and the host of the show,
[00:38:05.228 --> 00:38:07.589]  Kept saying over and over again for an hour.
[00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:16.015]  I don't know, I was jogging on the treadmill from 9.30 to about 9.00 to about 10.10 when I ran, took a shower, and drove to the office.
[00:38:16.015 --> 00:38:18.496]  I get ready before... I don't know why I get into details.
[00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:19.537]  It doesn't matter.
[00:38:19.537 --> 00:38:23.199]  The point is, is that he was saying over and over again
[00:38:26.531 --> 00:38:28.693]  Why was there a secret meeting Monday and Tuesday?
[00:38:28.693 --> 00:38:30.314]  Why are there no minutes?
[00:38:30.314 --> 00:38:32.915]  Why are hundreds of billions being given to banks?
[00:38:32.915 --> 00:38:35.597]  Why is this run only by Goldman Sachs?
[00:38:35.597 --> 00:38:37.919]  Why is it all being handed directly to themselves?
[00:38:37.919 --> 00:38:39.680]  Why is it completely secret?
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:46.705]  And as all three of his guests said, it's wonderful, it's good, we've gotta keep it secret.
[00:38:46.705 --> 00:38:47.966]  I mean, just out in the open!
[00:38:49.858 --> 00:38:57.941]  Steve Watson has an article out documenting that it's already five trillion in the last year pumped into these financial institutions.
[00:38:57.941 --> 00:39:04.263]  Five trillion in the United States and Europe alone!
[00:39:04.263 --> 00:39:07.844]  The bailout is two weeks old and they've already pumped in over a trillion.
[00:39:07.844 --> 00:39:12.406]  It is not seven hundred billion.
[00:39:12.406 --> 00:39:14.587]  Conservatively it's to be five trillion.
[00:39:14.587 --> 00:39:16.728]  A lot of publications say it's more like ten trillion.
[00:39:19.289 --> 00:39:24.193]  Everybody's confused and they're saying, is it depression or is it inflation?
[00:39:24.193 --> 00:39:28.776]  Because the economists tell you that you only get one or the other.
[00:39:28.776 --> 00:39:35.220]  Because of loss in demand, oil goes from $150 a barrel to $165 a barrel.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:35.961]  From $150 a barrel to $65 a barrel.
[00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:46.909]  The real economy is shutting down.
[00:39:46.909 --> 00:39:51.410]  The real economy is stalling out like an airplane engine.
[00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:54.531]  You're flying at a thousand feet and your engine stalls out.
[00:39:54.531 --> 00:39:58.212]  The propeller stops spinning.
[00:39:58.212 --> 00:40:01.092]  Black smoke starts boiling out from under it.
[00:40:01.092 --> 00:40:07.094]  But on top of that, they are hyper-inflating the currency.
[00:40:07.094 --> 00:40:14.075]  So that as bad as the contraction in the economy, the recession, which is depressionary,
[00:40:15.245 --> 00:40:27.615]  You will have an overlay of not having jobs, not having an availability of cash and credit and physical symbols of money through the monetary fraud that is not free market.
[00:40:27.615 --> 00:40:29.537]  It's an engineered scam.
[00:40:29.537 --> 00:40:32.999]  It's now gobbling the entire economy.
[00:40:32.999 --> 00:40:39.885]  You won't be able to get physical money like during the Great Depression, but everything will be inflated in cost.
[00:40:41.411 --> 00:40:45.454]  Because they're only giving the currency to the bankers.
[00:40:45.454 --> 00:40:53.579]  They're only giving it to the institutions who are sharing it with no one.
[00:40:53.579 --> 00:40:57.081]  So, it is the worst possible economic scenario.
[00:40:57.081 --> 00:40:57.942]  Alright, I'm done.
[00:40:57.942 --> 00:41:04.526]  I'm going to go to your calls for the next 30 minutes or so, then I'm going to get into Zeitgeist Addendum, which I've actually had time to analyze more.
[00:41:04.526 --> 00:41:06.147]  It's far worse than I originally thought.
[00:41:08.775 --> 00:41:17.298]  Just my light criticisms and concerns have been responded to in a cult-like fashion, and now I know why.
[00:41:17.298 --> 00:41:25.640]  Because you've got a lot of well-meaning people that are fooled by its altruistic pie-in-the-sky vision that so many people pushed in the past.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.000]  Hitler, Mao, Stalin.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.983]  You know, similar utopia visions with images of high-tech cities in the background.
[00:41:33.983 --> 00:41:35.503]  Something simple, easy silver bullet.
[00:41:36.365 --> 00:41:41.209]  And then you've got those in the inner sanctum of this, that... Well, it's like the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:41:41.209 --> 00:41:43.552]  There was an attempt to take it over by a U.N.
[00:41:43.552 --> 00:41:45.874]  Eurangia cult.
[00:41:45.874 --> 00:41:46.334]  Openly.
[00:41:46.334 --> 00:41:50.658]  You know, UFOs gonna land and take us over people, and then that failed.
[00:41:50.658 --> 00:41:56.143]  That's why I'm mainly back to We Are Change, because there was a split there in New York, and we got behind the folks that we knew were real activists.
[00:41:56.143 --> 00:41:59.006]  They're not steering us away from real issues and taking action.
[00:42:00.026 --> 00:42:01.067]  You're going to have the same thing.
[00:42:01.067 --> 00:42:12.036]  I mean, you're going to have... I said on the day 9-11 happened that they're going to engineer this like America carried out these attacks, the United States carried out these attacks, and blame it all on the United States.
[00:42:12.036 --> 00:42:15.238]  I said they're going to release torture photos, and they did, to blame it on the U.S.
[00:42:15.238 --> 00:42:15.718]  when the U.S.
[00:42:15.718 --> 00:42:18.741]  is a tool of the European banking elite.
[00:42:18.741 --> 00:42:24.766]  So we take the blame, so the idea of free market is destroyed and liberty is destroyed.
[00:42:24.766 --> 00:42:27.568]  So they can make the new global system based out of Europe
[00:42:29.238 --> 00:42:33.379]  Tied in with China and Russia, look like the good guys.
[00:42:33.379 --> 00:42:35.980]  Tom hung up, who called to disagree.
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:38.641]  Tom, we put you to the head of the line.
[00:42:38.641 --> 00:42:41.382]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:42:41.382 --> 00:42:46.443]  You were saying you disagreed with me about Zeitgeist Addendum.
[00:42:46.443 --> 00:42:49.764]  And I was just told about your call when we came out of the last break ten minutes ago.
[00:42:49.764 --> 00:42:51.245]  And I put you to the head of the line, Tom.
[00:42:51.245 --> 00:42:54.185]  I mean, did you not like what I was just saying about Zeitgeist?
[00:42:54.185 --> 00:42:55.926]  You don't want to come on and defend your ideas?
[00:42:59.676 --> 00:43:03.379]  I mean, what we've got is the UFO cult.
[00:43:03.379 --> 00:43:06.181]  What we've got is these New Agers, who's nothing new about it.
[00:43:06.181 --> 00:43:07.322]  It's the occult.
[00:43:07.322 --> 00:43:13.127]  And I found out that some of the radio hosts, other people that are attacking me, they themselves are admitted occultists.
[00:43:13.127 --> 00:43:17.791]  And all they do is attack and bash Christians and try to make the New World Order a Christian conspiracy.
[00:43:17.791 --> 00:43:19.292]  Give me a break!
[00:43:19.292 --> 00:43:21.834]  And so I'm always learning more.
[00:43:21.834 --> 00:43:28.299]  And I'm finding out our movement is completely filled, here I'm trying to be nice and friendly, completely filled with
[00:43:29.053 --> 00:43:33.076]  The Theosophic Society, Luciferians, and Higher Masonic Orders.
[00:43:33.076 --> 00:43:44.523]  And they're coming in, and then we're all being friendly, going, well, okay, as long as you're fighting the New World Order, as long as you're talking about the Federal Reserve, and as long as you're talking about 9-11 and Inside Job, we're not going to get in fights with you over religion.
[00:43:44.523 --> 00:43:48.646]  But meanwhile, they're always attacking us, saying we're bad.
[00:43:48.646 --> 00:43:50.447]  So, so get that straight!
[00:43:50.447 --> 00:43:52.868]  This is the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:52.868 --> 00:43:53.829]  Bottom line.
[00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:57.231]  Did Tom call back in?
[00:43:57.231 --> 00:43:58.332]  I want you to keep a line open.
[00:43:59.142 --> 00:44:00.382]  And again, how do we know he disagreed?
[00:44:00.382 --> 00:44:09.265]  We don't screen your calls, we ask your name, where you're calling from, you can make it up if you want, you can say Billy Bob from Timbuktu, but if you volunteer you disagree, you go to the head of the line.
[00:44:09.265 --> 00:44:11.886]  I want the line kept open for Tom, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:44:11.886 --> 00:44:16.047]  Hey, listen!
[00:44:16.047 --> 00:44:18.388]  There's no debating it!
[00:44:18.388 --> 00:44:26.651]  Zeitgeist intros and outros, with the Theophic Society's World Christ, the leader of all religions,
[00:44:31.445 --> 00:44:39.053]  The Mahdi, the Global Solar Christ.
[00:44:39.053 --> 00:44:44.620]  I'm sorry, you can't laugh at us like saying you're right, and that's what I've always found.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:48.024]  99% of the time, if they're at a high level and a low level agnostics and
[00:44:50.353 --> 00:44:53.234]  Atheists, I found, are generally decent people.
[00:44:53.234 --> 00:44:54.054]  They just don't know.
[00:44:54.054 --> 00:44:55.614]  They can't prove something.
[00:44:55.614 --> 00:44:58.275]  And so they're saying, you know, I don't believe it.
[00:44:58.275 --> 00:45:03.536]  But when you get to prominent atheists and people, it's always a vicious hatred of all the religions.
[00:45:03.536 --> 00:45:08.858]  And you find out, they're into the occult.
[00:45:08.858 --> 00:45:16.800]  So really, it's their way, like Albert Pike said, of discrediting all other religions and systems to destroy it, to build their new utopic
[00:45:17.797 --> 00:45:24.672]  Morningstar Venus Lucifer Project System.
[00:45:24.672 --> 00:45:28.040]  Turns out the engineer they interview has the Venus Project lives in Venus, Florida.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.760]  I gave Trey his number.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.661]  I want to try to see if that guy will come on.
[00:45:31.661 --> 00:45:34.182]  Come on, defend your ideas about this.
[00:45:34.182 --> 00:45:35.462]  And I'm not trying to get in a fight.
[00:45:35.462 --> 00:45:36.502]  I'm trying to stay out of fights.
[00:45:36.502 --> 00:45:51.747]  But when I find out that the Theophic Society, when I find out that the tip-top of the New World Order is coming in here and telling us what to do, and telling us how to behave, and telling us we're Christian cavemen, and telling us to sit down and shut up, I've got a problem.
[00:45:51.747 --> 00:45:52.627]  Did Tom call back in?
[00:45:55.555 --> 00:45:55.935]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:45:55.935 --> 00:46:00.296]  You say you disagree with me about Zeitgeist, Tom.
[00:46:00.296 --> 00:46:01.496]  Fred and Philly, you're on the air.
[00:46:01.496 --> 00:46:04.277]  Hi, Alex.
[00:46:04.277 --> 00:46:05.997]  I've been paying careful attention.
[00:46:05.997 --> 00:46:11.018]  I'm, like you, I'm angry at Mr. Joseph.
[00:46:11.018 --> 00:46:19.360]  And I want to seriously give you what I think about the film and the interview yesterday.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.581]  I think that he has a theocratic goal.
[00:46:25.615 --> 00:46:36.302]  And unlike you, he is intolerant and he has the habit of shouting down other people.
[00:46:36.302 --> 00:46:41.985]  Well, he was making false charges and really vicious attacks and then going, oh poor me, I did nothing.
[00:46:41.985 --> 00:46:44.386]  But listen, I'm the bad one here.
[00:46:44.386 --> 00:46:47.468]  I didn't do my homework and I don't think Zeitgeist supporters have.
[00:46:47.468 --> 00:46:49.329]  That's why they don't show his name at the start of the film.
[00:46:50.965 --> 00:47:01.272]  To the UN, the Christ, to Christians, the Antichrist, the declared global messiah is who introduces the film.
[00:47:01.272 --> 00:47:02.553]  I mean, I had no idea.
[00:47:02.553 --> 00:47:10.959]  I mean, you know, I was there being a nice thing, and oh, I think you might be getting into some dangerous New World Order stuff and maybe not knowing, and that's why I kept saying the New World Order doesn't matter.
[00:47:10.959 --> 00:47:11.700]  It's not the issue.
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:17.104]  And also, the Raelians have the slogan, science is love.
[00:47:17.104 --> 00:47:18.625]  So, it's similar to that.
[00:47:19.745 --> 00:47:21.467]  No, no, that's the thing.
[00:47:21.467 --> 00:47:22.668]  It's all the same.
[00:47:22.668 --> 00:47:32.199]  These groups, the Raelians, the Orangias, the UN, the Theosophic Society, they all, it is the same thing.
[00:47:32.199 --> 00:47:34.061]  I've seen it a hundred times.
[00:47:34.061 --> 00:47:41.629]  And so I was saying, hey, you're mixing in New World Order stuff I've seen a hundred times, you know, put out for 150 years by the, originally the Fabian Socialists.
[00:47:42.296 --> 00:47:45.178]  What do you expect people to do to give up their right of conscience?
[00:47:45.178 --> 00:47:51.143]  I mean, if you want to believe something, it actually is part and parcel of who you are because you have that ability to, or not to, believe something.
[00:47:51.143 --> 00:47:54.946]  He wants to get rid of that right of
[00:48:12.908 --> 00:48:15.951]  That's what they always say in the French Revolution.
[00:48:15.951 --> 00:48:17.152]  The Jacobins did the same thing.
[00:48:17.152 --> 00:48:22.357]  They said, we're going to go to a 10-day work week, we're going to change the months to 10 months, and we're going to overturn everything.
[00:48:22.357 --> 00:48:24.118]  They always do that.
[00:48:24.118 --> 00:48:28.923]  But they're overturning it back to the old system.
[00:48:28.923 --> 00:48:31.825]  It's a counter-revolution.
[00:48:31.825 --> 00:48:33.207]  I mean, judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:48:33.931 --> 00:48:38.272]  Since we became decadent in New World Order, we've lost all of our blessings.
[00:48:38.272 --> 00:48:42.493]  Before, we weren't perfect, but look at how nothing, you know, everything turned to gold we touched.
[00:48:42.493 --> 00:48:46.014]  Now everything we touch turns to crap.
[00:48:46.014 --> 00:48:47.254]  This is just incredible.
[00:48:47.254 --> 00:48:56.956]  I just couldn't believe the venom that he had, and the fact that it was, what he was saying wasn't even logical, let alone... But it's religious!
[00:48:56.956 --> 00:48:58.176]  John, play that clip again.
[00:48:58.176 --> 00:48:59.597]  Play the new clip from today.
[00:48:59.597 --> 00:49:00.597]  This is from Zeitgeist.
[00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:02.532]  Now listen to this religion!
[00:49:02.532 --> 00:49:03.993]  Listen to the religious ecstasy!
[00:49:03.993 --> 00:49:05.673]  And he's saying the Spirit!
[00:49:05.673 --> 00:49:06.053]  Here it is!
[00:49:06.053 --> 00:49:07.913]  And while that's being shown,
[00:49:31.705 --> 00:49:37.991]  A druidic right symbol with the hands in a pyramid with the sun in it is on the screen.
[00:49:37.991 --> 00:49:41.435]  Did he say God Spirit or did he say God Experience?
[00:49:41.435 --> 00:49:44.077]  I think I heard him say God Experience.
[00:49:44.077 --> 00:49:44.538]  Play it again.
[00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:53.474]  But the fact of the matter is, joy comes from that bliss of connectedness.
[00:49:53.474 --> 00:49:54.775]  That's our God Spirit.
[00:49:54.775 --> 00:49:58.839]  That's that side of ourselves that really feels it.
[00:49:58.839 --> 00:50:01.281]  God Spirit!
[00:50:01.281 --> 00:50:02.201]  God Spirit!
[00:50:02.201 --> 00:50:14.391]  Again, I told you the Theophic Society always poses as anti-religionist, as everybody's a bunch of caveman idiots, but then there it is over and over again.
[00:50:16.684 --> 00:50:19.284]  This is incredible.
[00:50:19.284 --> 00:50:21.065]  And listen, I didn't do my homework.
[00:50:21.065 --> 00:50:27.766]  I mean, I'll be honest with you, I, uh, in bits and pieces, took me a year to ever watch, you know, the original Three Hours Zeitgeist.
[00:50:27.766 --> 00:50:45.209]  I mean, I, I, I, I, you know, I was like, oh, well, you know, they just, there's just some atheists who don't, you know, whatever, but, but then mixing 9-11 Truth and the Federal Reserve into it, and then this new one, I mean, this is the Grade A, you know, uh, Premium Choice Cutlet New World Order.
[00:50:46.648 --> 00:50:48.592]  And then, oh, you're not allowed to comment on it.
[00:50:48.592 --> 00:50:50.096]  You're a stupid Christian.
[00:50:50.096 --> 00:50:51.619]  You know, you believe in religion.
[00:50:51.619 --> 00:50:53.383]  Meanwhile, it's pure religion.
[00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:53.984]  Thanks for the call.
[00:50:53.984 --> 00:50:55.126]  We'll come back and take more calls.
[00:51:01.451 --> 00:51:05.155]  Are you sick and tired of spending your hard-earned money to fill your gas tank?
[00:51:05.155 --> 00:51:06.817]  Then do something about it!
[00:51:06.817 --> 00:51:10.621]  Fuel Saver's Fuel Conditioner lets you drive further on each gallon of fuel.

[00:52:00.757 --> 00:52:07.526]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.526 --> 00:52:10.170]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:11.712]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.712 --> 00:52:12.513]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.513 --> 00:52:13.374]  This is his MO.
[00:52:13.374 --> 00:52:14.896]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:14.896 --> 00:52:16.518]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:16.858 --> 00:52:24.021]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.021 --> 00:52:24.501]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.501 --> 00:52:30.844]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.844 --> 00:52:34.305]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.545 --> 00:52:44.835]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:44.835 --> 00:52:46.056]  Fabled enemies.

[00:53:00.899 --> 00:53:10.574]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[00:53:10.574 --> 00:53:13.479]  The whole country's on a bus with a crazy driver.
[00:53:13.479 --> 00:53:16.203]  If the passengers can't get hold of the wheel, we're off.
[00:53:16.203 --> 00:53:17.504]  We're all going to go over the cliff.

[00:53:45.759 --> 00:53:45.999]  We're good.
[00:54:19.009 --> 00:54:19.430]  Hi Alex.
[00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:20.391]  Yeah, my battery ran out before.
[00:54:20.391 --> 00:54:23.493]  I mentioned to John that I only had about 15 minutes of battery.
[00:54:23.493 --> 00:54:24.614]  No, that's alright.
[00:54:47.398 --> 00:55:01.804]  I haven't actually seen Black Ops Attendant yet, and I listened to a bit of your interview yesterday, but there was a part of it, and it was a fundamental point that you misunderstood.
[00:55:01.804 --> 00:55:13.168]  It was about what is the mother of invention, what is the mother of creativity, new advances, new ideas.
[00:55:15.618 --> 00:55:28.766]  The point that was being put to you, and I think it's probably in the film, although I haven't seen it yet, is that it's not to do with any sort of monetary gain.
[00:55:28.766 --> 00:55:43.955]  Anyone who's had an invention, a real invention, something that involves inspiration or a creative idea, knows that it's completely ridiculous to think that that is because
[00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:51.595]  of some sort of monetary gain or gain of any sort of material sort.
[00:55:57.412 --> 00:55:59.033]  These are insane arguments.
[00:55:59.033 --> 00:56:00.993]  I understand what you're saying.
[00:56:00.993 --> 00:56:04.075]  We have to have resources.
[00:56:04.075 --> 00:56:09.397]  Humans have always had to do some type of labor, and we're unhappy if we don't do something.
[00:56:09.397 --> 00:56:15.579]  There are certainly dehumanizing types of labor, dehumanizing systems, but Eli Whitney created his cotton gin
[00:56:16.179 --> 00:56:33.918]  To make money and then he had his invention stolen and then he finally made it by creating rifles that could be mass-produced that weren't made one at a time and he invented that that later led to Henry Ford and and and you know mass production assembly lines so I actually know all about it and so I mean listen
[00:56:35.043 --> 00:56:38.184]  Maybe it is because I've got such a feeble mind.
[00:56:38.184 --> 00:56:38.724]  Hold on.
[00:56:38.724 --> 00:56:42.725]  Such a feeble mind that maybe it is going right over my head.
[00:56:42.725 --> 00:56:46.066]  And maybe religions are bad unless it's the global Christ.
[00:56:46.066 --> 00:56:48.407]  Maybe I'm not getting that either.
[00:56:48.407 --> 00:56:49.427]  You know, religions are all bad.
[00:56:49.427 --> 00:56:53.408]  You're a bunch of caveman idiots, but we love the global Christ.
[00:56:53.408 --> 00:56:58.870]  Explain to me what you're saying about someone who makes an invention doesn't want monetary gain.
[00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:59.550]  I don't understand that.
[00:57:00.929 --> 00:57:16.840]  I'm not saying that, you know, after you've had your invention, you might then think, oh, I can make some money out of it, but the invention is the inspiration that comes through you from what I would say, from the divine, I would say.
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:20.342]  They're saying there is no divine unless... You're not even... No, they're not.
[00:57:20.342 --> 00:57:22.063]  How could you guys watch this?
[00:57:22.063 --> 00:57:24.485]  You haven't even seen it!
[00:57:24.485 --> 00:57:27.347]  I haven't seen it, but I guess it's... It's New Age zombie-ism.
[00:57:27.347 --> 00:57:28.388]  It's unstoppable.
[00:57:29.904 --> 00:57:33.567]  They were talking about God, but you were saying that's religion.
[00:57:33.567 --> 00:57:40.734]  What I would suggest that the maker might counter to you is that talking about God is not the same as talking about religion.
[00:57:40.734 --> 00:57:48.962]  No, no, he said, he said on this show, no, no, that's not what he said.
[00:57:48.962 --> 00:57:51.584]  God Almighty.
[00:57:51.584 --> 00:57:54.927]  All this circular reasoning, it's just, it's unspeakable.
[00:57:58.221 --> 00:58:01.262]  No, it's not circular.
[00:58:01.262 --> 00:58:04.903]  Religion is this structured, man-made thing.
[00:58:04.903 --> 00:58:07.144]  Religion versus spirituality.
[00:58:07.144 --> 00:58:09.965]  Religion versus spirituality, I understand.
[00:58:09.965 --> 00:58:11.986]  But what do you think religion springs from?
[00:58:11.986 --> 00:58:19.689]  It is a manifestation of man's spirituality, and then it becomes institutionalized.
[00:58:19.689 --> 00:58:20.269]  You're not what?
[00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:26.073]  I'm not sure if religion springs necessarily from spirituality.
[00:58:26.073 --> 00:58:30.016]  Religion might well spring from an idea to co-opt.
[00:58:30.016 --> 00:58:32.537]  I'm saying in its earlier roots, it does.
[00:58:32.537 --> 00:58:35.059]  Listen, man, I appreciate your call.
[00:58:35.059 --> 00:58:37.441]  It was really good talking to you.
[00:58:37.441 --> 00:58:42.464]  Why don't you go see it first?
[00:58:42.464 --> 00:58:45.866]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.866 --> 00:58:47.888]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:57.123]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:58:57.123 --> 00:58:58.444]  And we knew what to do.
[00:58:58.444 --> 00:59:00.445]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:59:00.445 --> 00:59:06.808]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:59:07.486 --> 00:59:16.394]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:59:16.394 --> 00:59:23.480]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.543]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:59:26.543 --> 00:59:31.708]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:59:32.408 --> 00:59:35.511]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:59:44.479 --> 00:59:53.647]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:59:53.647 --> 00:59:56.049]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.049 --> 00:59:58.812]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.322 --> 01:00:06.644]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.644 --> 01:00:08.406]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.406 --> 01:00:10.169]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.169 --> 01:00:11.751]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.751 --> 01:00:13.313]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.313 --> 01:00:17.499]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.499 --> 01:00:21.604]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:35.756]  In the third and fourth hour today, we're going to have former Travis County Sheriff Raymond Franks running again for sheriff on an anti-New World Order pro-liberty platform.
[01:00:35.756 --> 01:00:39.021]  Red Beckman, 30 minutes in, father of the Fully Informed Jury Association.
[01:00:39.787 --> 01:00:46.269]  He joins us to talk about the importance of taking over our counties through our elected sheriffs, their proper role.
[01:00:46.269 --> 01:00:53.611]  And then Officer Jack McClam joins us to continue that discussion and all the national news about martial law, everything we talked about now unfolding.
[01:00:53.611 --> 01:00:55.912]  He'll be joining us today as well.
[01:00:55.912 --> 01:01:05.014]  Coming up in about 10 minutes, I'm going to get into my latest review of... I've done some more research on Zeitgeist Addendum.
[01:01:05.014 --> 01:01:06.955]  We just had a caller that illustrates everything I'm talking about.
[01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:07.735]  He hasn't even seen it.
[01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:29.786]  And he's saying, and I was pointing out last hour, that in Zeitgeist, it turns out that they're introducing the global Christ of a theophic society, introduces and ends the film, there's all sorts of religious statements, and that's what the highest masonic orders through Albert Pike and
[01:01:32.301 --> 01:01:44.587]  What others said is that we're going to discredit, we're going to have the atheists and the Muslims and the Christians basically all kill each other, and we're going to discredit all religion and say we're atheists, and then we're going to bring in the one true worship of Lucifer.
[01:01:44.587 --> 01:01:50.990]  And then the very theophic society's global Christ is who they have in the movie!
[01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:52.030]  You cannot make this up!
[01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:55.732]  And then I say, how is it that no one else can have a spirituality?
[01:01:55.732 --> 01:01:57.553]  And none of that exists, calling that religion.
[01:01:57.553 --> 01:01:59.074]  That's what they're saying, none of it exists.
[01:01:59.074 --> 01:01:59.814]  It's all science.
[01:02:01.747 --> 01:02:08.813]  But then say, oh, but we can talk about our religious dogma and reincarnation and that's okay.
[01:02:08.813 --> 01:02:15.219]  That is the new age, through atheism, discrediting other religious systems and it's very intellectually dishonest.
[01:02:15.219 --> 01:02:17.921]  I just, it's off the charts, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:17.921 --> 01:02:23.166]  I mean, I haven't even been paying attention to this film and now I'm actually analyzing it and it's off the charts.
[01:02:23.166 --> 01:02:25.148]  Off the charts.
[01:02:25.148 --> 01:02:27.710]  And the reason this is important is that it is attempting
[01:02:28.706 --> 01:02:33.288]  And I'm seeing this not just with it, but at every front of 9-11, Truth, you name it.
[01:02:33.288 --> 01:02:40.832]  Different tentacles of this all basically saying the same thing, moving in to the alternative media, the patriot movement, the awakening.
[01:02:40.832 --> 01:02:43.333]  So, you know, oh, we're for this world government.
[01:02:43.333 --> 01:02:51.557]  I mean, we're against this bad world government, but we have our own loving world government, and you will be re-educated, by the way.
[01:02:51.557 --> 01:02:56.540]  Let's go to Josh, no, John in Wyoming.
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.280]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:02:58.450 --> 01:02:59.731]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:02:59.731 --> 01:03:00.191]  Hi.
[01:03:00.191 --> 01:03:03.273]  Alex, I've got a comment and then a prediction.
[01:03:03.273 --> 01:03:13.158]  The comment is if this guy thinks he's the world Christ, let him stand on a railroad track while a diesel locomotive is coming down the track and we'll soon find out what he is.
[01:03:13.158 --> 01:03:22.843]  But I'm being called a nut Christian because I have some spirituality and they're saying no spirituality, nothing, but then they are saying we have the Christ.
[01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:26.073]  Well, let me make my prediction.
[01:03:26.073 --> 01:03:36.006]  I think the CFR is going to elect Barack Obama and then have him assassinated because look what they've been doing for the past several months.
[01:03:36.006 --> 01:03:40.332]  They've been trying to equate him as the new black John F. Kennedy.
[01:03:40.772 --> 01:03:50.757]  They even had on NBC Nightly News the other night, they had some old recordings that Ben Bradley did with John F. Kennedy before he was elected president.
[01:03:50.757 --> 01:03:56.720]  So it's this little subtle inference that, oh, if you vote for Obama, you're voting for JFK.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:09.686]  Then when they knock him off, they'll have, first of all, the excuse to impose full-blown martial law, and then they'll have the excuse to confiscate all the firearms.
[01:04:12.216 --> 01:04:13.821]  So what do you think?
[01:04:13.821 --> 01:04:16.851]  I think he raised something that is a distinct possibility.
[01:04:17.512 --> 01:04:27.194]  Because I think, just as government can give you something, government can take away, just as government can get someone elected, they can also knock them off.
[01:04:27.194 --> 01:04:43.677]  Because, as you well know, the CFR knocked off Kennedy after he imposed Executive Order 11110 on June 4th, 1963, recalling all those fraudulent Federal Reserve notes and issuing debt-free United States notes.
[01:04:44.412 --> 01:04:46.055]  Well, they can't have that.
[01:04:46.055 --> 01:04:52.806]  So the bankers made darn sure that JFK didn't live to celebrate his accomplishment.
[01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:56.832]  The only difference is Barack Obama is completely in league with the bankers, but we'll see what happens.
[01:04:56.832 --> 01:04:57.353]  Good point.
[01:04:57.353 --> 01:04:57.814]  Stay with us.
[01:05:02.552 --> 01:05:05.735]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking when it comes to this economy.
[01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.117]  The banks are crashing.
[01:05:07.117 --> 01:05:08.718]  The stock market's a mess.
[01:05:08.718 --> 01:05:10.380]  There's the mortgage crisis.
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.322]  There's the lending crisis.
[01:05:12.322 --> 01:05:16.987]  There is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis.
[01:05:16.987 --> 01:05:18.568]  And we are paralyzed a little bit.
[01:05:18.568 --> 01:05:20.530]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it.
[01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:21.331]  I don't know what to say.
[01:05:21.331 --> 01:05:22.132]  What can you do?
[01:05:22.132 --> 01:05:22.993]  Do what you can do.
[01:05:22.993 --> 01:05:23.593]  That's what you do.
[01:05:23.593 --> 01:05:24.514]  You do what you can do.
[01:05:24.514 --> 01:05:26.416]  What I can do is I can put some food away.
[01:05:26.516 --> 01:05:28.298]  I know there's a global food shortage.
[01:05:28.298 --> 01:05:28.858]  I can read it.
[01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:32.021]  I can go to eFoodsDirect.com, read hundreds of articles about this.
[01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:36.405]  I can go up on the Google website and Google food shortage and see the world's a mess.
[01:05:36.405 --> 01:05:36.846]  I know it.
[01:05:36.846 --> 01:05:37.246]  You know it.
[01:05:37.246 --> 01:05:38.007]  Look at the prices.
[01:05:38.007 --> 01:05:38.707]  Look where they're headed.
[01:05:38.707 --> 01:05:39.348]  Be prepared.
[01:05:39.348 --> 01:05:40.028]  Take care of yourself.
[01:05:40.028 --> 01:05:46.134]  You owe your family some security, some sense of self-being, a little bit of self-reliance is a good idea right now.

[01:06:01.148 --> 01:06:04.371]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:06:04.371 --> 01:06:07.854]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:07.854 --> 01:06:10.497]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:10.497 --> 01:06:12.038]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:12.038 --> 01:06:12.559]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:12.559 --> 01:06:13.820]  This is his M.O.
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:15.201]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:15.201 --> 01:06:16.743]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:17.183 --> 01:06:24.330]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:24.330 --> 01:06:24.811]  Some U.S.
[01:06:24.811 --> 01:06:31.177]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:31.177 --> 01:06:34.621]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:34.861 --> 01:06:45.143]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:06:45.143 --> 01:06:46.363]  Fabled enemies.

[01:07:01.229 --> 01:07:06.131]  As a parent, your biggest fear is getting a phone call that your child has been attacked or worse.
[01:07:06.131 --> 01:07:11.613]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep these safety tips in mind.
[01:07:11.613 --> 01:07:13.894]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings.
[01:07:13.894 --> 01:07:16.595]  Walk on well-lit paths with friends or students.
[01:07:16.595 --> 01:07:19.596]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.
[01:07:19.596 --> 01:07:21.537]  Know how to reach campus security.
[01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:25.078]  Always tell someone where they're going and when to expect their return.
[01:07:25.078 --> 01:07:27.399]  And always carry a self-defense device.

[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.782]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.782 --> 01:08:10.545]  Government cover-ups.

[01:08:12.127 --> 01:08:13.689]  Well, so does he.

[01:08:17.875 --> 01:08:21.940]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:46.251]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[01:08:46.251 --> 01:08:53.213]  I have decided in the next 50 minutes of this hour to get into Zeitgeist Addendum.
[01:08:53.213 --> 01:09:08.538]  I have now analyzed it more, looked into it a lot more deeply, Zeitgeist Addendum, and it is very, very serious and I am going to be, in future broadcast,
[01:09:10.962 --> 01:09:15.845]  Doing even more research and breaking it down.
[01:09:15.845 --> 01:09:16.885]  Why is this important?
[01:09:16.885 --> 01:09:27.491]  Because it's one of the most virally viewed films on the internet, probably second or third to Loose Change second edition.
[01:09:27.491 --> 01:09:30.193]  But definitely rivaling it.
[01:09:30.193 --> 01:09:39.158]  When it came out and was anti-religious period, but particularly against Christians a few years ago, the first Zeitgeist, I didn't get into a fight.
[01:09:39.815 --> 01:10:05.186]  I'm not here to argue with a bunch of different... ...world socialism and what the United Nations pushes and we've seen all of the same things being said in Zeitgeist Addendum from the other different groups in the New World Order crowd.
[01:10:05.186 --> 01:10:07.327]  And he said, you need to watch it, you need to look into it.
[01:10:07.327 --> 01:10:08.127]  So a few days later,
[01:10:10.747 --> 01:10:14.349]  I, one night, watched almost all of it.
[01:10:14.349 --> 01:10:20.191]  I didn't watch all of it because the phone was ringing and things were going on that evening at my house, but I watched most of it.
[01:10:20.191 --> 01:10:29.234]  And I had the view of, well, it exposes the monetary fraudulent private banking system and it exposes how they manipulate the economy to consolidate power.
[01:10:29.234 --> 01:10:37.057]  And it, um, you know, does some good things, you know, dealing with 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:10:37.057 --> 01:10:38.338]  But they had this, um,
[01:10:39.926 --> 01:10:47.872]  You know, industrial scientist on there calling basically for this future utopia and a classless society and eradicating the classes and the state withering away.
[01:10:47.872 --> 01:10:51.635]  I mean, that's a quote.
[01:10:51.635 --> 01:10:55.458]  And I knew from the Theosophic Society, I knew from the
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.281]  Eugenicist, later the Transhumanist, I knew from H.G.
[01:10:59.281 --> 01:11:15.005]  Wells and Bertrand Russell and countless others that at the highest levels of the New World Order, at the United Nations, at Greenpeace, Mikhail Gorbachev, that this has been what they've been pushing for 150 years.
[01:11:15.005 --> 01:11:22.327]  But now it was being mixed in with a supposed anti-New World Order view.
[01:11:22.327 --> 01:11:25.368]  But then I had the creator on, Zeitgeist I and II,
[01:11:27.685 --> 01:11:35.327]  And I was, you know, bringing up the fact that the New World Order had called for similar things, and he would poo-poo that, despite the fact it's historical.
[01:11:35.327 --> 01:11:36.668]  And I would play him clips of H.G.
[01:11:36.668 --> 01:11:40.469]  Wells' film, Things to Come, which was saying similar things, almost identical things.
[01:11:40.469 --> 01:11:45.610]  You know, a book written almost a hundred years ago, made into a film eighty years ago.
[01:11:45.610 --> 01:11:50.371]  Eighty or so years ago.
[01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:56.273]  And then I noticed how people on the message board at InfoWars.com, commenting on the stories who were against me,
[01:11:57.253 --> 01:12:04.219]  For questioning it, we're basically saying, you know, you're just a dumb Christian, so you're not allowed to pretty much even have an opinion.
[01:12:04.219 --> 01:12:13.006]  They weren't countering any of the issues I brought up, and I made clear that I'm just analyzing this in a secular fashion.
[01:12:13.006 --> 01:12:21.833]  I'm just looking at it historically, and where we've heard all these same things before.
[01:12:21.833 --> 01:12:24.715]  Well, last night I went and re-watched part of it,
[01:12:27.037 --> 01:12:36.722]  And they didn't say what his name was, so I did more research to find out who he was, because I'd been sure I'd seen him before and seen photos of him before.
[01:12:36.722 --> 01:12:40.344]  And it turned out that I had.
[01:12:40.344 --> 01:12:46.567]  Now remember, Zeitgeist is saying basically anything religious, anything spiritual.
[01:12:46.567 --> 01:12:47.988]  You know, any of these mainline religions.
[01:12:50.643 --> 01:12:57.791]  That anybody who believes any of that is basically culturally and mentally tainted now in their whole world view.
[01:12:57.791 --> 01:13:03.618]  And atheists and agnostics are the main people pushing this film.
[01:13:03.618 --> 01:13:10.926]  And then I noticed amongst many things in the documentary was a Jiddu Krishnamurti
[01:13:13.706 --> 01:13:30.475]  Who was born in 1895 and died in 1986, and he was discovered by the leader of the Theosophic Society, the heir of Madame Blavatsky, who of course was Hitler's main spiritual leader.
[01:13:30.475 --> 01:13:40.960]  And I'd read a couple of her books, and I had remembered reading what the Theosophic Society said in the twenties,
[01:13:44.358 --> 01:13:55.367]  And I knew that from the twenties, or even earlier, right through into the seventies and eighties, they were saying that Jiddu Krishnamurti was the universal Christ.
[01:13:55.367 --> 01:13:57.028]  To Christians, he would be Jesus Christ.
[01:13:57.028 --> 01:14:08.677]  To the Hindus and people, he would be an Eastern leader.
[01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:11.259]  To different sects, he would be Buddha to one, Krishna to another.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:18.325]  Which, of course, Buddha is just, I guess, the prophet of Krishna.
[01:14:18.325 --> 01:14:25.952]  And I was just completely blown away by this being hidden in plain view in the introduction and the ending of the film.
[01:14:25.952 --> 01:14:28.494]  And then I remembered and was able to find the clips last night.
[01:14:28.494 --> 01:14:31.597]  This is only in a few hours of research.
[01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:38.343]  Clips in Zeitgeist where they talk about the God Spirit in all of us.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:53.343]  Now, yesterday, with the creator of the film, I was saying, well, you know, spirituality is an expression of people knowing there's something bigger that our eyes and ears and smell and taste and touch only picks up a very narrow spectrum of reality.
[01:14:53.343 --> 01:14:55.883]  The mathematics shows all the other dimensions.
[01:14:55.883 --> 01:15:05.605]  The beginning of science, which you're saying is a scientific system, which is what the Theosophic Society says, but they say it's reincarnation and also spiritual.
[01:15:07.108 --> 01:15:15.033]  I was saying that, you know, how can you just say anybody who's basically spiritual or religious, which grows out of that, you know, is backwards and stupid.
[01:15:15.033 --> 01:15:18.876]  And then, just in a cursory inspection, it is religious.
[01:15:18.876 --> 01:15:29.423]  And that's exactly what Albert Pike and Manly P. Hall, you know, all of these top masons in the last 150 years, that's exactly what they said they would do.
[01:15:29.423 --> 01:15:36.208]  They would go out and discredit Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, all of these religions.
[01:15:37.173 --> 01:15:46.519]  And that they would then replace it with the God-man, you know, Christ-slash-Lucifer consciousness in an integration with technology and science.
[01:15:46.519 --> 01:15:52.802]  We've posted some news articles and stories that have broken this down, that I ran into last night, up on InfoWars.com.
[01:15:52.802 --> 01:15:59.026]  And then just from a monetary perspective, we have Gilbert Griffin with a review of that, and he's coming up to comment on Zeitgeist Denim later in the hour.
[01:16:02.634 --> 01:16:06.098]  And so, I ask the atheists and agnostics this.
[01:16:06.098 --> 01:16:11.022]  How is it that I, because I have to say I'm a Christian, am not even allowed to comment?
[01:16:11.022 --> 01:16:17.229]  I am just, just, immediately, you don't even have standing.
[01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:20.332]  And, you know, we're basically a bunch of knuckle-dragging buffoons.
[01:16:22.122 --> 01:16:27.524]  But then we have the Theosophic Society's Christ, their leader, which Christians would say was the Antichrist.
[01:16:27.524 --> 01:16:28.025]  What do they say?
[01:16:28.025 --> 01:16:38.189]  He's a world leader, world religious leader, who will be the Mahdi, or the Messiah, the Christ to every religion.
[01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:41.450]  And that's exactly what they say he is.
[01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:44.531]  And Barbara Marx, Hubbard, and all of them.
[01:16:44.531 --> 01:16:45.572]  And they took him around the world.
[01:16:45.572 --> 01:16:50.654]  And now Benjamin Crimm, for 20 years, says he has a new Messiah.
[01:16:51.983 --> 01:16:54.885]  And it's the same thing somebody picked out of the East.
[01:16:54.885 --> 01:16:56.786]  So it's the same thing over and over again.
[01:16:56.786 --> 01:17:04.692]  So I thought I would first play this clip from Zeitgeist where they're talking about the God Spirit.
[01:17:04.692 --> 01:17:07.374]  Spirits!
[01:17:07.374 --> 01:17:09.436]  See, that's exactly what the Illuminati religion is.
[01:17:09.436 --> 01:17:14.039]  Everything else is discredited and then they rise up and they always package it as science.
[01:17:14.039 --> 01:17:14.359]  Here it is.
[01:17:15.942 --> 01:17:21.524]  But the fact of the matter is, joy comes from that bliss of connectedness.
[01:17:21.524 --> 01:17:22.824]  That's our God Spirit.
[01:17:22.824 --> 01:17:26.285]  That's that side of ourselves that really feels it.
[01:17:26.285 --> 01:17:28.266]  You can feel it deep inside.
[01:17:28.266 --> 01:17:30.027]  It's this amazing, wonderful feeling.
[01:17:30.027 --> 01:17:31.247]  And you know it when you get it.
[01:17:31.247 --> 01:17:32.367]  You don't get it from money.
[01:17:32.367 --> 01:17:36.649]  You get it from connection.
[01:17:36.649 --> 01:17:37.989]  Okay, God Spirit.
[01:17:37.989 --> 01:17:42.431]  And that's a separate individual talking in the film.
[01:17:42.431 --> 01:17:43.251]  And then there is this
[01:17:44.637 --> 01:17:46.517]  Jiddu Krishnamurti.
[01:17:46.517 --> 01:17:51.038]  Let's go ahead and play some of him from the introduction of the new film.
[01:17:51.038 --> 01:17:52.399]  Here it is.
[01:17:52.399 --> 01:18:04.701]  We were saying how very important it is to bring about in the human mind the radical revolution.
[01:18:04.701 --> 01:18:05.321]  The crisis
[01:18:10.889 --> 01:18:16.992]  is a crisis in consciousness.
[01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:34.261]  A crisis that cannot anymore accept the old norms, the old patterns, the ancient traditions.
[01:18:34.261 --> 01:18:39.244]  And, considering what the world is now,
[01:18:41.118 --> 01:18:48.962]  With all their misery, conflict, destructive brutality... Alright, it goes on and on.
[01:18:48.962 --> 01:18:50.463]  On and on.
[01:18:50.463 --> 01:19:04.530]  The point is, is that we must destroy all the old and bring in the new, and this is the Christ, Jiddu Krishnamurti.
[01:19:04.530 --> 01:19:04.750]  So,
[01:19:06.124 --> 01:19:09.207]  Because I believe there's more than just what we see in the spectrum.
[01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:13.691]  I'm a kook, I'm a nut, I'm an idiot, I'm a fool.
[01:19:13.691 --> 01:19:16.114]  So see, it's double think.
[01:19:16.114 --> 01:19:24.481]  But then, oh, we introduce our film with the Mahdi, with the Christ, with the Buddha.
[01:19:24.481 --> 01:19:29.486]  Just absolutely incredible.
[01:19:29.486 --> 01:19:30.587]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:19:30.587 --> 01:19:30.948]  Stay with us.
[01:19:31.863 --> 01:19:33.845]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[01:19:33.845 --> 01:19:36.046]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[01:19:36.046 --> 01:19:37.427]  I can't find my wallet!
[01:19:49.949 --> 01:19:52.330]  There's attached to each of those easy-to-lose things.
[01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:54.931]  It can find and be found by all the rest.
[01:19:54.931 --> 01:19:56.571]  Use your wallet to find your keys.
[01:19:56.571 --> 01:19:58.652]  Your keys to find the remote control.
[01:19:58.652 --> 01:20:01.392]  Or any of them to find an uncharged or muted cell phone.
[01:20:01.392 --> 01:20:02.953]  The possibilities are endless.
[01:20:02.953 --> 01:20:05.474]  Fofa goes through walls, cushions, and laundry baskets.
[01:20:05.474 --> 01:20:06.114]  Up to thirty...
[01:20:23.254 --> 01:20:23.915]  It is a big idea.
[01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:54.762]  A New World Order!
[01:20:54.762 --> 01:20:59.644]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:20:59.644 --> 01:21:02.486]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:21:02.486 --> 01:21:05.287]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[01:21:05.287 --> 01:21:08.469]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:21:08.469 --> 01:21:15.793]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:21:18.815 --> 01:21:24.256]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:21:24.256 --> 01:21:28.117]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:21:28.117 --> 01:21:30.678]  Build a very good, making great progress toward a world government.
[01:21:30.678 --> 01:21:31.858]  Most people have no idea.
[01:21:31.858 --> 01:21:32.638]  They're not after money.
[01:21:32.638 --> 01:21:33.898]  They have all the money they need.
[01:21:33.898 --> 01:21:34.678]  They're after power.
[01:21:34.678 --> 01:21:36.059]  That's what they're after, these people.

[01:21:50.022 --> 01:21:51.823]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:21:51.823 --> 01:21:53.504]  October 16, 2008.

[01:22:07.271 --> 01:22:12.895]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:17.238]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan Revolution.
[01:22:17.238 --> 01:22:25.143]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[01:22:25.143 --> 01:22:27.545]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[01:22:27.805 --> 01:22:31.629]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[01:22:31.629 --> 01:22:37.916]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[01:23:55.783 --> 01:23:56.703]  Finishing up.
[01:23:56.703 --> 01:24:01.364]  Then I'm gonna bring Jason Burnham and Jennifer Griffin on to comment on this.
[01:24:01.364 --> 01:24:05.025]  From different angles.
[01:24:05.025 --> 01:24:06.626]  I haven't really paid attention to Zeitgeist.
[01:24:08.172 --> 01:24:14.097]  And I saw people fighting on the internet, fighting on the web, a lot of Zeitgeist people attacking myself.
[01:24:14.097 --> 01:24:18.361]  And I just thought, oh well, they're just atheists, dude.
[01:24:18.361 --> 01:24:23.785]  I mean, I just cover the political information, the markets, the news.
[01:24:23.785 --> 01:24:28.149]  And I saw them criticizing me, and I'm like, this isn't even a religious show.
[01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:31.692]  But the mere fact that I say on air I am a Christian, angers them.
[01:24:33.866 --> 01:24:39.927]  And if they're disconnected, you know, from religion and spirituality, well, why do they even care?
[01:24:39.927 --> 01:24:42.488]  When I'm not even really making that a big part of the show.
[01:24:42.488 --> 01:24:49.769]  And then I noticed with Bohemian Grove, I had all these leftist groups in Monterreo and California.
[01:24:49.769 --> 01:24:52.910]  It real mad at me when I went in and filmed the ritual.
[01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:58.151]  World leaders engaging in a black magic ceremony, which is now international news and admitted it goes on.
[01:24:58.151 --> 01:25:01.832]  Back in the time, people were even trying to deny that it was real footage.
[01:25:01.832 --> 01:25:03.452]  But the Grove has commented and said, no, it's real.
[01:25:04.679 --> 01:25:11.764]  Then we sent Ed Homan out to California the year after, and there were all the major local peace groups by name.
[01:25:11.764 --> 01:25:17.087]  And that's all in The Order of Death, my second film on Bohemian Grove.
[01:25:17.087 --> 01:25:29.735]  About 300 of them out there, with the local activist leaders, with a witch's pot, believing that they were firing Harry Potter power beams out of their fingers into the Grove to stop their ritual.
[01:25:32.125 --> 01:25:35.967]  And then I talked to a lot of them privately, and I called them up, and I'd say, well, come on the show and talk about that.
[01:25:35.967 --> 01:25:36.907]  No, we're not.
[01:25:36.907 --> 01:25:39.309]  You make our religion of the earth look bad.
[01:25:39.309 --> 01:25:40.909]  So what if they're in there doing that?
[01:25:40.909 --> 01:25:43.871]  You need to make it about their monetary system.
[01:25:43.871 --> 01:25:47.253]  And by the way, there's a good New World Order, not just a bad one.
[01:25:47.253 --> 01:25:48.894]  That's what you limitedly don't see.
[01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:51.235]  You're a Christian, aren't you?
[01:25:51.235 --> 01:25:54.116]  And I'm like, well, I didn't even make that film from a Christian perspective.
[01:25:54.116 --> 01:25:56.257]  I just went and covered it.
[01:25:56.257 --> 01:26:01.560]  I mean, it's weird with all these mainline Republican leaders with gay porn stars and getting drunk and doing rituals.
[01:26:04.468 --> 01:26:07.429]  And they're like, oh, you Christians, you're what's holding everything back.
[01:26:07.429 --> 01:26:09.889]  No, I'm not coming on your show.
[01:26:09.889 --> 01:26:14.271]  These were the prominent peace leaders who we showed up, and boy, they didn't like it.
[01:26:14.271 --> 01:26:23.653]  Some of them got up from the ritual and left on the road with state police all around them in black uniforms, riot police, doing rituals with a witch's pot.
[01:26:23.653 --> 01:26:30.295]  Now, see, they were acting, the very people on that video, were putting out in the local newspapers on their websites,
[01:26:31.425 --> 01:26:37.086]  We covered it at the time, we cover it in the film, that I'm a nut, and that they're atheists, and I'm crazy believing in religion.
[01:26:37.086 --> 01:26:39.947]  That didn't hit, folks.
[01:26:39.947 --> 01:26:50.149]  See, I am secularly, as a reporter, reporting on it, and they said over and over again, do not show the ritual.
[01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:52.729]  I remember calling some of the activist groups after I'd snuck in.
[01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:55.830]  I said, hey, I want some of your photos of years past, of your protests and things.
[01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:57.570]  No, we're not giving you anything, you Christian.
[01:27:01.087 --> 01:27:03.429]  And I'm like, well, I didn't even tell you I was a Christian.
[01:27:03.429 --> 01:27:04.029]  How do you know?
[01:27:04.029 --> 01:27:04.790]  Well, we know.
[01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:05.530]  Don't you worry.
[01:27:05.530 --> 01:27:07.171]  And I was like, we're atheists.
[01:27:07.171 --> 01:27:08.933]  We think you're backwards and stupid.
[01:27:08.933 --> 01:27:12.995]  Then I show up and they're witches and warlocks.
[01:27:12.995 --> 01:27:13.716]  That's the same thing.
[01:27:13.716 --> 01:27:15.237]  Oh, you backwards Christians.
[01:27:15.237 --> 01:27:16.358]  You can't even comment.
[01:27:16.358 --> 01:27:20.661]  You can't even grasp, you know, a resource-based economy and a global system.
[01:27:20.661 --> 01:27:25.064]  And we're going to have to re-educate some people and we're going to have to eradicate certain things.
[01:27:26.067 --> 01:27:28.329]  And then, you know, I don't know if you bubbled on a gun, Alex.
[01:27:28.329 --> 01:27:31.151]  And I'm like, well, I have some reasons to be against that.
[01:27:31.151 --> 01:27:34.293]  You can't even grasp what I'm saying.
[01:27:34.293 --> 01:27:36.916]  Well, that's very insulting.
[01:27:36.916 --> 01:27:41.839]  And I know that a lot of fake intellectuals are into saying you can't grasp, but no, I grasped it fully.
[01:27:41.839 --> 01:27:49.926]  I hadn't even looked into you, and now I'm gonna shine a magnifying glass down your throat.
[01:27:49.926 --> 01:27:54.069]  I'm gonna snake something down your gizzard, and we're going to inspect you from
[01:27:55.638 --> 01:28:00.839]  Head to toe, from tail to hoof, we are going to look at every bit of it.
[01:28:00.839 --> 01:28:06.741]  Because let me tell you something, I scratch the surface and pus just starts squirting out.
[01:28:06.741 --> 01:28:12.903]  So to all you atheists that have been sucked in by the Theosophic Society, you better go read Theosophic Society.
[01:28:12.903 --> 01:28:15.223]  You better go find out about Alice Bailey.
[01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:18.104]  You better find out about Madame Blavosky.
[01:28:18.104 --> 01:28:21.165]  You better find out about Lucifer Truss there in New York at the UN building.
[01:28:24.170 --> 01:28:26.592]  You need to discover that right now.
[01:28:26.592 --> 01:28:35.579]  You know, I've been neutral with all these groups, and even had some of them on the show, you know, quote, anti-New World Order groups, who are always, for some reason, anti-Christian.
[01:28:35.579 --> 01:28:48.288]  And then I get around them in person in Austin, and they say, by the way, I'm part of the Theophic Society, and the Order of the Golden Dawn, and Aleister Crowley wasn't a bad guy.
[01:28:48.288 --> 01:28:49.329]  So they're all out there.
[01:28:49.329 --> 01:28:50.190]  I mean, every time!
[01:28:51.616 --> 01:28:54.738]  I mean, in this film, they're talking about the God Spirit.
[01:28:54.738 --> 01:28:57.599]  They've got the Theophic Society's Christ.
[01:28:57.599 --> 01:28:58.880]  They took around the world.
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:02.162]  It's introducing and ending it.
[01:29:02.162 --> 01:29:04.423]  And the atheists are going to double-think, because they've been trained.
[01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:07.024]  They're going to go, well, that's alright, or no, that doesn't exist.
[01:29:07.024 --> 01:29:10.686]  Or they'll say, you're crazy saying a devil exists.
[01:29:10.686 --> 01:29:14.128]  You know, and evil being my invention.
[01:29:14.128 --> 01:29:15.929]  No, no, I'm saying intellectually.
[01:29:17.498 --> 01:29:20.419]  I'm saying from a secular view, without God.
[01:29:20.419 --> 01:29:24.181]  They're just looking at people's beliefs, like we're studying a group of Aborigines.
[01:29:24.181 --> 01:29:36.946]  I'm saying, these people are saying all other religions are fake, and religions don't exist, and spirituality doesn't exist, but then their film is filled with it, and it happens to be the same religion of Adolf Hitler.
[01:29:36.946 --> 01:29:38.086]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:38.086 --> 01:29:39.467]  And Ted Turner for that matter.
[01:29:40.746 --> 01:29:44.675]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:44.675 --> 01:29:47.381]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.095 --> 01:30:01.663]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[01:30:50.376 --> 01:30:57.162]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:30:57.162 --> 01:30:59.804]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:30:59.804 --> 01:31:01.345]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:01.345 --> 01:31:02.146]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:02.146 --> 01:31:03.006]  This is his ammo.
[01:31:03.006 --> 01:31:04.528]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:04.528 --> 01:31:06.089]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:06.509 --> 01:31:13.657]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:13.657 --> 01:31:14.137]  Some U.S.
[01:31:14.137 --> 01:31:20.483]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:20.483 --> 01:31:23.947]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:24.167 --> 01:31:34.452]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:31:34.452 --> 01:31:35.692]  Fabled enemies.

[01:31:50.282 --> 01:31:51.962]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:31:51.962 --> 01:31:53.723]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:31:53.723 --> 01:31:56.404]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:31:56.404 --> 01:32:01.525]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.

[01:32:49.376 --> 01:32:59.184]  There is massive news unfolding on the stock market, the police state front, so much going on.
[01:32:59.184 --> 01:33:05.829]  But the reason I have been spending quite a bit of time the last few days, yesterday and today,
[01:33:07.712 --> 01:33:11.755]  On Zeitgeist, it isn't about just Zeitgeist.
[01:33:11.755 --> 01:33:18.660]  It's about everywhere I look, there are New Age occultists.
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:23.843]  And I'm not talking about everybody that's into alternative stuff, I mean the leaders of this.
[01:33:23.843 --> 01:33:25.244]  Everywhere.
[01:33:25.244 --> 01:33:28.246]  Moving into every position you can imagine.
[01:33:28.246 --> 01:33:30.107]  Attacking Christians.
[01:33:30.107 --> 01:33:33.249]  Saying there's going to be a good New World Order.
[01:33:33.249 --> 01:33:35.591]  Saying there's going to be a good World Socialist Order.
[01:33:36.738 --> 01:33:41.081]  Saying, we're not going to need our guns, we're not going to need classes, we're going to be re-educated.
[01:33:41.081 --> 01:33:55.390]  And I've seen it and heard it all before, from a Theosophic Society, the Roundtable groups, the Fabian Socialists, the Marxist-Leninists, the Maoists, I mean, it is the same thing.
[01:33:55.390 --> 01:34:00.554]  And they make the New God technology and imply that everybody else are troglodytes.
[01:34:01.198 --> 01:34:03.840]  Who are against technology, that we're all these backwards people.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.843]  And then we just intellectually say, well, look, let's cut religion out of it.
[01:34:07.843 --> 01:34:10.525]  Uh, you know, what you're calling for is a type of religion.
[01:34:10.525 --> 01:34:17.470]  And look, you've got all these religious trappings and, you know, your leaders are these world Christ and, and, and, and, and, you know, all these occultists.
[01:34:17.470 --> 01:34:18.790]  They're like, no, shut up.
[01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:19.751]  You're a Christian.
[01:34:19.751 --> 01:34:21.432]  You know, you, you can't even comment on that.
[01:34:21.432 --> 01:34:23.674]  You can't even grasp it.
[01:34:23.674 --> 01:34:27.817]  And so that's the point that I'm, uh, raising here.
[01:34:30.606 --> 01:34:42.169]  And I challenge everybody to go research the Theosophic Society, an encyclopedia, and to find out what they believe and what they push.
[01:34:42.169 --> 01:34:43.549]  It is the worship of Lucifer.
[01:34:43.549 --> 01:34:45.530]  You can read the books written by the founder of it.
[01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:51.091]  This is what Hitler followed, and today what most of your world leaders are adherents to.
[01:34:51.091 --> 01:34:52.751]  Tony Blair is an adherent.
[01:34:52.751 --> 01:34:54.172]  That's been in the news.
[01:34:54.172 --> 01:34:55.312]  Ted Turner's an adherent.
[01:34:55.962 --> 01:34:57.943]  Mikhail Gorbachev's involved with all these groups.
[01:34:57.943 --> 01:34:58.603]  I mean, this is it.
[01:34:58.603 --> 01:35:04.284]  They have an official office at the UN and on Wall Street.
[01:35:04.284 --> 01:35:05.805]  And I want to be clear.
[01:35:05.805 --> 01:35:08.406]  I've done a bad thing in all this.
[01:35:08.406 --> 01:35:14.628]  I ignored Zeitgeist attacking Christians and being wrong about it and having to admit they were wrong about the history they put out and having to change it.
[01:35:14.628 --> 01:35:16.968]  And saying, eh, whatever, I'm not getting involved in that.
[01:35:16.968 --> 01:35:19.809]  At least they're exposing 9-11 as an inside job.
[01:35:19.809 --> 01:35:22.690]  But what that was is building up their cred, moving into things.
[01:35:23.846 --> 01:35:28.307]  And then intellectually being dishonest and saying, oh, you're just a bunch of religious nuts, you can't comment.
[01:35:28.307 --> 01:35:43.050]  We're like, we're not even... You know, why do you keep bringing up Christianity when I'm saying that, you know, a stateless state, you know, but... and, you know, these communities and all this high-tech stuff, all this blather that we've heard over and over again.
[01:35:43.050 --> 01:35:50.872]  And then saying the New World Order is a joke, it's falling apart, it doesn't know what it's doing, you know, moving towards this stateless state through world socialism.
[01:35:51.747 --> 01:35:57.111]  I mean, it's the same intellectual crap that is false.
[01:35:57.111 --> 01:35:57.811]  It's fraudulent.
[01:35:57.811 --> 01:35:59.032]  There's nothing substantive.
[01:35:59.032 --> 01:36:00.413]  It's not even real.
[01:36:00.413 --> 01:36:02.954]  It's actually what kind of low-grade morons buy into.
[01:36:02.954 --> 01:36:09.719]  And it's very effective with a dumbed-down, Kool-Aid-drinking mass that's finally figured out the government's evil and lying to them.
[01:36:09.719 --> 01:36:11.480]  I mean, to say that the private banking cartel
[01:36:13.195 --> 01:36:29.828]  Is free market when it's a monopoly, totally fraudulent, completely criminal, that's seeking to create a world monopoly and wants socialism and funds socialism to hamstring families, to break down individual sovereignty and security, to create a stateless state for the population?
[01:36:29.828 --> 01:36:34.291]  Where we have no positions, but the elite are above us as the technocrats.
[01:36:34.291 --> 01:36:35.172]  And I challenge you
[01:36:36.329 --> 01:36:54.297]  I challenge you to go read the externalization of the hierarchy by Alice Bailey, and the Lucifer Trust, and to read it, and it's almost word-for-word what is being said in large sections of Zeitgeist Addendum.
[01:36:54.297 --> 01:36:56.158]  Very, very serious.
[01:36:56.158 --> 01:37:00.159]  And then, well, let's bring up Jason Burmess, because we don't have a lot of time.
[01:37:00.159 --> 01:37:01.720]  We're about to have Gilbert Griffin on.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:03.921]  Just a comment on this from a monetary angle.
[01:37:05.074 --> 01:37:07.335]  And you can read up on InfoWars.com, his article about it.
[01:37:07.335 --> 01:37:12.336]  He said, look, I don't want to... I didn't want to wade into this at first, but it was very troubling, very upsetting.
[01:37:12.336 --> 01:37:15.217]  I'd seen this so many times before.
[01:37:15.217 --> 01:37:28.542]  Now it's been repackaged, and claiming that it's, you know, anti-New World Order, while calling for global governance, and then saying we're not even allowed to comment, that we're just mere mortals.
[01:37:28.542 --> 01:37:31.482]  But you have to comment on it, because it's so serious.
[01:37:31.482 --> 01:37:32.943]  So then I just started investigating it,
[01:37:33.988 --> 01:37:54.359]  And here's the key, and found out that the global Christ, Jiddu Krishnamurti, who the Theophic Society pushed as the world Christ, is all over this film, and is at the beginning and end of the film, and they have all these other religious clips about the God Spirit.
[01:37:54.359 --> 01:38:00.742]  Now again, that is, all of it is exactly what we get from the highest levels Illuminati religion.
[01:38:01.596 --> 01:38:03.197]  Man merging with machine.
[01:38:03.197 --> 01:38:05.998]  A utopian society.
[01:38:05.998 --> 01:38:11.141]  Basically eradicating the other, you know, fraudulent religions that will just wither away like the state.
[01:38:11.141 --> 01:38:15.183]  But it's always bloody getting it, but then they always claim at the onset, oh no, it's not going to be bloody.
[01:38:15.183 --> 01:38:18.125]  There will be some re-education though.
[01:38:18.125 --> 01:38:21.726]  And then it's the exact same theosophic societies, the exact same people.
[01:38:21.726 --> 01:38:22.587]  It's the same thing!
[01:38:23.593 --> 01:38:25.173]  And they say, oh no, it's not!
[01:38:25.173 --> 01:38:33.395]  I challenge you out there who are Zeitgeist acolytes, followers now, to please go look at this and say, how is all these other religions wrong?
[01:38:33.395 --> 01:38:39.636]  And there's no such thing as religion or spirituality, but then the thing's filled with religious connotations and Illuminati buzzwords.
[01:38:39.636 --> 01:38:43.256]  And the Illuminati Christ!
[01:38:43.256 --> 01:38:45.637]  Who they said was the Christ!
[01:38:45.637 --> 01:38:49.237]  Jason Burmess, welcome to the Airwaves for your comments on this.
[01:38:49.237 --> 01:38:50.798]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:38:50.798 --> 01:38:51.638]  Yeah, I came across
[01:38:52.816 --> 01:39:03.384]  The day after it came out, I downloaded it off the internet and I sat down and I watched it and I was very impressed with the editing quality in the first hour, covering the Federal Reserve banking cartel.
[01:39:03.384 --> 01:39:08.768]  It only got a few minor things wrong, which G. Edward Griffin goes into in his article.
[01:39:08.768 --> 01:39:11.150]  But then when it really transcended,
[01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:22.639]  Into this utopian type society that is just, you know, short of a glorified version of Brave New World or 1984.
[01:39:22.639 --> 01:39:25.040]  I was very troubled by it.
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.922]  Like you said, it's unbelievable.
[01:39:26.922 --> 01:39:28.983]  I mean, he uses a lot of truth.
[01:39:28.983 --> 01:39:32.206]  For instance, those technologies that are in the film, they do exist.
[01:39:32.782 --> 01:39:39.124]  But why would our global masters ever give us free access to them, centralizing their control?
[01:39:39.124 --> 01:39:44.465]  There's never really a solution given to that other than stop banking with them and stop joining the military.
[01:39:51.852 --> 01:40:20.039]  That's the issue, is that he kept saying, the global government's a bunch of idiots, they're falling apart, they're failing, they're nothing, you know, global government isn't even the issue, we're gonna have a good global governance, and then I say, well that's gonna take enforcers and systems, oh no it's not, no it's not, you know, it's just gonna happen, then I go, but you're repeating all the stuff I've heard before, and he would just sigh, and basically say that, you know, that wasn't the case, even though it was all the key Marxist-Leninist, you know, New World Order buzzwords, which comes out of this whole theosophic system, and it's only one brand of it,
[01:40:20.891 --> 01:40:28.098]  And, you know, that was really the key to all of this, is the New World Order says they're setting up this utopia.
[01:40:28.098 --> 01:40:29.220]  It's identical.
[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:41.412]  The UN says they're setting up what he's saying, and he's acting like they've just now invented it, and this engineer they're talking to has just now invented it, when this is the New World Order religion, repackaged as if it's anti-
[01:40:42.212 --> 01:40:45.113]  Uh, New World Order, when there's no discussion about it.
[01:40:45.113 --> 01:40:46.993]  He's like, you're dealing with all these little problems.
[01:40:46.993 --> 01:40:48.934]  And I'm like, no, no, no, we're fighting the fight.
[01:40:48.934 --> 01:40:50.114]  We're holding back the tide.
[01:40:50.114 --> 01:40:57.796]  It was all this disdainful Moses on the mountain, uh, you know, laughing at all the other religions when they are so highly religious.
[01:40:57.796 --> 01:41:00.476]  And they'll say, and they'll say, they're saying they're not even spiritual.
[01:41:00.476 --> 01:41:01.897]  They're saying it doesn't exist.
[01:41:01.897 --> 01:41:03.037]  It's science religion.
[01:41:03.037 --> 01:41:10.939]  But then that's what they're pushing, bringing forward the Christ of the UN official religion of the Theosophic Society.
[01:41:10.939 --> 01:41:11.299]  So, uh,
[01:41:12.105 --> 01:41:21.231]  I mean, it's just so incredible to have it hanging right out there on the edge, and we're not even recognizing it when it's the elephant hidden right in the room, Jason Bermas.
[01:41:21.231 --> 01:41:29.896]  I mean, the New World Order is claiming they're going to set up with this world socialist state what they are, again, in this film, pushing.
[01:41:29.896 --> 01:41:30.156]  Go ahead.
[01:41:31.101 --> 01:41:31.781]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:31.781 --> 01:41:37.284]  I mean, when you hear the words, one world, one consciousness, well, that means that everybody's going to speak the same language.
[01:41:37.284 --> 01:41:39.244]  We're going to be under the same set of rules.
[01:41:39.244 --> 01:41:42.766]  It looks like we're all going to be wearing the same clothes, according to this utopia.
[01:41:42.766 --> 01:41:44.627]  I mean, what is this?
[01:41:44.627 --> 01:41:48.188]  I mean, is this the humanity that you want to bring your children up in?
[01:41:48.188 --> 01:41:49.509]  It certainly isn't what I want.
[01:41:50.029 --> 01:41:52.550]  It is what these globalists want.
[01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:58.312]  However, he fails to recognize that when they want to bring this in, well, they want to cut the population down by about 80%.
[01:41:58.312 --> 01:42:02.754]  Oh no, their film talks about how there is overpopulation.
[01:42:02.754 --> 01:42:05.655]  Yeah, yeah, it does, but again, it doesn't address how they're going to get rid of it.
[01:42:05.655 --> 01:42:06.736]  Look, this is a classic introduction.
[01:42:06.736 --> 01:42:09.877]  They come in with all the anti-New World Order movement stuff.
[01:42:10.609 --> 01:42:18.056]  But, but which, which had been, you know, basically created, generated the resistance by real Christians at its core.
[01:42:18.056 --> 01:42:26.524]  It comes in, assaults them to get the atheists behind it, and then brings it into religion in the next one doing a double think game saying this isn't religion.
[01:42:27.293 --> 01:42:32.719]  Yeah, and one of the things that I don't think you've touched upon enough is the fact that this is very Earth-based.
[01:42:32.719 --> 01:42:36.684]  I mean, he really talks about... Which is what the Theosophic... There's so many points!
[01:42:36.684 --> 01:42:44.613]  The Theosophic Society says the Earth's load in harmony with the Earth because the Theosophics say we're worshipping the Earth Spirit.
[01:42:44.613 --> 01:42:45.313]  Exactly!
[01:42:45.313 --> 01:42:46.375]  It's the same thing!
[01:42:47.095 --> 01:42:54.457]  And then you find out, you know, these high-level supposed Christian conservatives are really into the occult and pagan earth worship.
[01:42:54.457 --> 01:43:00.398]  And if you watch that first Zeitgeist film, you know, the first part of that film is all about sun worship.
[01:43:00.398 --> 01:43:06.640]  Well, again, he fails to tell people that the people at the very, very top are into these type of ceremonies.
[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:09.362]  You know, they're into this paganism, this sun worship.
[01:43:40.402 --> 01:43:51.930]  So there you have the God Spirit in all of us.
[01:43:51.930 --> 01:43:55.373]  And then if you say so, I'm going to get him back on and go, what is this about a God Spirit?
[01:43:55.373 --> 01:43:57.934]  And he'll just say, you're a Christian, you can't even grasp it.
[01:43:57.934 --> 01:44:00.596]  It's science.
[01:44:00.596 --> 01:44:01.657]  Oh man, we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:44:03.243 --> 01:44:08.746]  Well, I agree with you, Alex, and, uh, you know, thankfully I haven't really seen this at the top of the video charts.
[01:44:08.746 --> 01:44:10.807]  Obviously, there's a buzz around it.
[01:44:10.807 --> 01:44:23.113]  I just hope that a lot of newcomers to the movement don't look at this and take this for what we believe as a movement, because this is really unrealistic socialist garbage that's been pushed, like you said, for years and years and years.
[01:44:23.113 --> 01:44:30.416]  Well, I don't want to get into... Exactly, I don't want to get into what happened to 9-11 Truth in New York, but the main people in that, especially a, uh, a Urangea official, a U.N.
[01:44:30.416 --> 01:44:31.017]  UFO cult,
[01:44:32.467 --> 01:44:39.839]  And, uh, they openly, you know, wanted, it was basically tying down the real investigation, and so things split off, and we are changed.
[01:44:39.839 --> 01:44:42.262]  But everywhere I look, these people are all around us now.
[01:44:42.262 --> 01:44:43.905]  They are moving in to take over this movement.
[01:44:45.222 --> 01:44:56.265]  Well, yeah, I mean, obviously the mores of the culture have differentiated for the past 20 years and gotten more and more and more extreme, and now people are, you know, willing to believe anything.
[01:44:56.265 --> 01:44:57.826]  I mean, look at that Raelian cult.
[01:44:57.826 --> 01:45:02.607]  I mean, it's unbelievable to me how, you know, masses can be swayed into these
[01:45:03.167 --> 01:45:07.470]  By the way, there's now the Z-Force, 40,000 people in a week, he said, and the Z-Force is going to save us and re-educate us.
[01:45:17.117 --> 01:45:18.938]  Well, 40,000 people to re-educate us.
[01:45:18.938 --> 01:45:22.961]  Well, good luck, guys, because I don't think I need re-education.
[01:45:22.961 --> 01:45:30.647]  I don't think that we're just going to solve all these quote-unquote social issues with humanity by offering solutions.
[01:45:30.647 --> 01:45:32.448]  But did you hear him on the show yesterday?
[01:45:32.448 --> 01:45:34.429]  You said you were listening at home, painting your house.
[01:45:34.429 --> 01:45:39.693]  He's on there, and I go, what happens if I'm in the future utopia system, and I don't want to go along?
[01:45:39.693 --> 01:45:41.354]  He goes, well, you'll be reconditioned.
[01:45:41.354 --> 01:45:42.175]  You'll be re-educated.
[01:45:42.902 --> 01:45:44.663]  Yeah, because I'm saying, well, you'll be given a choice.
[01:45:44.663 --> 01:45:45.524]  I mean, what's this choice?
[01:45:45.524 --> 01:45:48.887]  Are they going to put us on Australia on some kind of island to fend for ourselves?
[01:45:48.887 --> 01:45:51.609]  I mean, what are these choices we're going to be given?
[01:45:51.609 --> 01:45:57.213]  Are we going to be given the lobotomized chip instead of the regular chip that most of humanity can handle?
[01:45:57.213 --> 01:45:59.175]  I mean, what are the choices we're going to get?
[01:45:59.175 --> 01:46:02.617]  I was in awe while I watched this thing.
[01:46:02.617 --> 01:46:09.643]  All they talk about is technocracy and remote control cars and the government taking control over the system that isn't a system.
[01:46:09.643 --> 01:46:12.585]  And that's exactly what the New World Order is building, this total control grid.
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:17.461]  Yeah, it was a lot like Minority Report without the ads for advertisements.
[01:46:17.461 --> 01:46:19.601]  No, no, they're just telling us it's going to be great!
[01:46:19.601 --> 01:46:21.782]  It's going to be wonderful, just like the Soviet Union!
[01:46:21.782 --> 01:46:22.442]  Do we have G.E.B.R.
[01:46:22.442 --> 01:46:26.703]  Griffin?
[01:46:26.703 --> 01:46:30.064]  I bet we got Time Zone screwed up with him.
[01:46:30.064 --> 01:46:31.484]  Sea of Trey gave you the right number.
[01:46:31.484 --> 01:46:32.064]  It's not G.E.B.R.
[01:46:32.064 --> 01:46:33.264]  Griffin wrote a review.
[01:46:33.264 --> 01:46:34.965]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:46:34.965 --> 01:46:35.745]  Look, it doesn't matter.
[01:46:35.745 --> 01:46:39.185]  The American people, the people of the world, love being suckers.
[01:46:39.185 --> 01:46:41.646]  And they've woken up to one level of the paradigm.
[01:46:42.675 --> 01:46:50.437]  And then certainly they woke up to organized religion being another level of the paradigm, and the disgusting phony Christians, and the phony Muslims, and all that stuff.
[01:46:50.437 --> 01:46:54.078]  And I'm not saying all the Muslims or all the Christians, I mean, you know, the establishment stuff.
[01:46:54.078 --> 01:47:03.440]  And so they're saying, oh, we don't want religion, but then it's the Theosophic Society with the World UN Christ in it!
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.801]  I mean, Burmish, you can't make stuff up like this!
[01:47:06.528 --> 01:47:12.732]  Yeah, and then he also tries to push the idea that, you know, evil doesn't exist, but abhorrent behavior does.
[01:47:12.732 --> 01:47:20.256]  Well, to me, abhorrent behavior is being down at a restaurant, you know, at a nice dinner with people, and starting to pick your feet in front of people.
[01:47:20.256 --> 01:47:21.057]  That's abhorrent behavior.
[01:47:21.057 --> 01:47:23.338]  Look, look, abhorrent behavior... Murmurs is what it is.
[01:47:23.937 --> 01:47:29.380]  Look, this is a psychological game where they say you aren't allowed to comment because you're part of a false religion.
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:31.341]  You're not allowed to comment because you're closed-minded.
[01:47:31.341 --> 01:47:33.823]  There's no such thing as evil.
[01:47:33.823 --> 01:47:35.984]  We will just, you know, re-educate everyone.
[01:47:35.984 --> 01:47:37.405]  Everyone's good.
[01:47:37.405 --> 01:47:40.727]  We'll just, you know, again, it's not allowing you to make choices.
[01:47:40.727 --> 01:47:41.887]  That's what the new order does.
[01:47:41.887 --> 01:47:43.148]  They're all about telling parents
[01:47:43.568 --> 01:47:45.129]  Don't give your children your values.
[01:47:45.129 --> 01:47:46.531]  Let them be themselves.
[01:47:46.531 --> 01:47:50.854]  Meanwhile, the state and the media and the schools are totally brainwashing them.
[01:47:50.854 --> 01:47:55.577]  They don't want you to put your imprint on them because they want to put the new.
[01:47:55.577 --> 01:47:56.938]  Well, we have to decide then.
[01:47:56.938 --> 01:48:00.381]  Do we like the new New World Order system, which is really the old tyranny system?
[01:48:00.381 --> 01:48:02.923]  Or do we like the more Renaissance system that we were under?
[01:48:04.651 --> 01:48:09.775]  Well, I couldn't agree with you more, Alex, and I see that pushed more and more today among kids' youth, not only in North America.
[01:48:09.775 --> 01:48:12.157]  Yeah, they're just saying we're not allowed to even have an opinion.
[01:48:12.157 --> 01:48:18.902]  It's just, we're the intellectuals, there's no North American Union, we're the intellectuals, there are WMDs, you're not allowed to comment, you know, and it's the same thing.
[01:48:18.902 --> 01:48:23.865]  We're the intellectuals, you know, you're not even, you're just a bunch of religious kooks.
[01:48:23.865 --> 01:48:28.429]  I mean, I would sit there and say to him, you know, science shows that at least half of what we do is genetic.
[01:48:29.282 --> 01:48:33.425]  And I would bring up that certain breeds of, you know, cow are more aggressive.
[01:48:33.425 --> 01:48:34.706]  And he said, no, that's not true.
[01:48:34.706 --> 01:48:36.287]  And he said, the science shows it.
[01:48:36.287 --> 01:48:37.428]  I said, what science?
[01:48:37.428 --> 01:48:39.150]  I mean, I've worked in this.
[01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:41.611]  And I'm giving him science, not Christianity.
[01:48:41.611 --> 01:48:43.253]  He goes, no, that's your Christian view.
[01:48:43.253 --> 01:48:45.054]  I mean, it's just an excuse.
[01:48:45.054 --> 01:48:46.635]  Hey, I think two plus two equals four.
[01:48:46.635 --> 01:48:48.396]  That's just your Christian view.
[01:48:48.396 --> 01:48:50.118]  Well, no, I'm not speaking as a Christian.
[01:48:50.118 --> 01:48:52.760]  I'm saying, you know, why do you have the
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:49:12.013]  The Christ leader of the UN, with his global reincarnation Christ consciousness, that's all good in the God Spirit, but then, if I talk about genetic engineering or something, it doesn't exist because I'm not allowed to comment, because I'm not a risen, raised person like you.
[01:49:13.419 --> 01:49:23.872]  Yeah, and he doesn't ever really talk about the double-edged sword of technology and how these things can be used to restrict, control, and enslave us, and are being used to do so.
[01:49:23.872 --> 01:49:26.495]  You know, I mean, again, everything's just there for us.
[01:49:26.495 --> 01:49:28.017]  Magically, everything's gonna work.
[01:49:28.017 --> 01:49:29.239]  All the problems are gonna be done.
[01:49:29.239 --> 01:49:30.821]  No one's gonna have a job, apparently.
[01:49:31.101 --> 01:49:32.322]  Well, I'll guarantee you this.
[01:49:32.322 --> 01:49:39.806]  You go down to New York, and you hang around outside of the Theophilic Society offices, and you go to their meetings, and we need our people to do this.
[01:49:39.806 --> 01:49:48.252]  Join them if you have to, and we're going to probably see some people we've heard from before, but under other names.
[01:49:48.252 --> 01:49:49.192]  Okay?
[01:49:49.192 --> 01:49:51.614]  And Peter Joseph needs to tell us his real name.
[01:49:51.614 --> 01:49:53.355]  He needs to tell us his funding.
[01:49:54.210 --> 01:50:00.055]  Because, because, you know, and again, folks, I'm not saying we control this movement or we say what is going on.
[01:50:00.055 --> 01:50:01.516]  I try to be open to everybody.
[01:50:01.516 --> 01:50:02.476]  This is the opposite.
[01:50:02.476 --> 01:50:05.879]  I'm saying grow it, expand it, have free discussions and thought.
[01:50:05.879 --> 01:50:10.302]  I'm being told I'm backwards and bad that I can't even question this or I'm bad.
[01:50:10.302 --> 01:50:11.363]  Again, religion doesn't exist.
[01:50:11.363 --> 01:50:12.244]  We're all kooks.
[01:50:12.244 --> 01:50:15.066]  Spirituality doesn't exist.
[01:50:15.066 --> 01:50:21.271]  But then they're all into spirituality, but it's only their spirituality that's exactly what we get with Albert Pike and the rest of them.
[01:50:24.534 --> 01:50:25.235]  Burma, stay there.
[01:50:25.235 --> 01:50:25.755]  I've been ranting.
[01:50:25.755 --> 01:50:30.378]  I'm gonna let you say whatever you want when we get back on any subject pertaining to this.
[01:50:30.378 --> 01:50:34.561]  I just... You know, I let things creep up next to me.
[01:50:34.561 --> 01:50:36.283]  I'm so busy, I'm not omnipresent.
[01:50:36.283 --> 01:50:39.905]  Some people seem to think I'm just a regular guy, and I've been ignoring this, not looking at it.
[01:50:39.905 --> 01:50:46.110]  And I opened the door up and looked up, and I literally almost vomited the stench of New World Order that came flooding out.
[01:50:46.110 --> 01:50:48.872]  And my God, I realized how many people they've completely fooled.
[01:50:50.816 --> 01:50:51.657]  Question.
[01:50:51.657 --> 01:50:56.400]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:00.883]  A world economic collapse could come a day.
[01:51:00.883 --> 01:51:01.724]  Question.
[01:51:01.724 --> 01:51:06.988]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[01:51:06.988 --> 01:51:07.768]  Question.
[01:51:07.768 --> 01:51:15.033]  Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?
[01:51:15.033 --> 01:51:15.274]  Answer.

[01:51:45.492 --> 01:51:50.317]  Do it now or become property of the New World Order.
[01:51:50.317 --> 01:51:52.340]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[01:51:55.796 --> 01:51:57.137]  It was an inside job!
[01:51:57.137 --> 01:51:58.698]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:51:58.698 --> 01:52:00.419]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:52:00.419 --> 01:52:03.302]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:52:03.302 --> 01:52:16.611]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the C.A.R., or even the... The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door!
[01:52:16.611 --> 01:52:21.435]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:29.341 --> 01:52:32.765]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:32.765 --> 01:52:35.648]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:35.648 --> 01:52:42.135]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:52:42.135 --> 01:52:44.978]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:52:44.978 --> 01:52:47.240]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:49.723]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:54.844]  Would you walk around with your credit card number displayed on your back for anyone to read?
[01:52:54.844 --> 01:52:55.985]  Of course not.
[01:52:55.985 --> 01:53:01.930]  But if you have one of the 50 million new contactless credit and debit cards in circulation in your wallet, that's exactly what you're doing.
[01:53:02.563 --> 01:53:07.946]  I'm Walt Augustinowicz, founder of Identity Stronghold, and we think this is information you need to know.
[01:53:07.946 --> 01:53:13.148]  You may not even realize you already have one of these cards, because they look physically just like the old card.
[01:53:13.148 --> 01:53:22.993]  The difference is an RFID chip hidden inside the card that makes radio communication with the card possible, right through your wallet, purse, or pants pocket without you ever removing the card.
[01:53:22.993 --> 01:53:25.895]  Pickpockets no longer even have to touch you to get your information.
[01:53:26.375 --> 01:53:31.897]  Our company realizes the privacy danger this represents, and that's why we manufacture the SecureSleeve.
[01:53:31.897 --> 01:53:38.620]  The SecureSleeve is a patent-pending card sleeve that contains a radio frequency barrier, preventing radio signals from reaching your card.
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:43.502]  You can get more information and purchase the SecureSleeve online at idstronghold.com.
[01:53:43.502 --> 01:53:46.704]  That's idstronghold.com, or call us at 800-610-2770.
[01:53:53.442 --> 01:53:58.887]  All right, we're going to get into taking over our local counties and cities the legal, lawful way.
[01:53:58.887 --> 01:54:00.128]  Electing good sheriffs.
[01:54:00.128 --> 01:54:01.329]  We're also getting into the economy.
[01:54:01.329 --> 01:54:01.929]  All the news.
[01:54:01.929 --> 01:54:03.530]  Huge things happening.
[01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:04.691]  Finishing up with Jason Burmess.
[01:54:04.691 --> 01:54:08.034]  We're going to have Jim Griffin with us for this segment and the next.
[01:54:08.034 --> 01:54:12.458]  Briefly, it's like a Jedi mind trick.
[01:54:12.458 --> 01:54:13.739]  It's like a marketing trick.
[01:54:13.739 --> 01:54:15.200]  A magician trick.
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:16.401]  You've got these theosophic
[01:54:17.971 --> 01:54:29.299]  UN World Government people, and then they pose as if they're anti-New World Order, and then they openly push all these religious statements about the God Consciousness, the God Spirit in us, but then say all the religions are bad.
[01:54:29.299 --> 01:54:31.901]  That's what Albert Pike said they would do.
[01:54:31.901 --> 01:54:38.686]  And that's what blows me away, is I've ignored this this long and didn't really look into it, and I scratched the surface, and it was unbelievable.
[01:54:38.686 --> 01:54:46.191]  I mean, having THE Christ, according to them, of the Theosophic Society, who they took around the world with them, this
[01:54:47.236 --> 01:54:50.757]  Jiddu Krishnamurti in the film.
[01:54:50.757 --> 01:54:52.377]  I mean, this is off the charts.
[01:54:52.377 --> 01:54:55.538]  I want to bring Gilbert Griffin on and keep Burmese on the comment.
[01:54:55.538 --> 01:55:14.262]  Gilbert Griffin, I mean, I know you're looking at this from a monetary angle, and, you know, with the silliness of it, and basically how it's a repeat of Karl Marx and withering away of the state, but I did some more research, and I mean, this thing is total UN.
[01:55:14.262 --> 01:55:14.862]  Gilbert Griffin?
[01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:17.282]  Yes, am I on the air now?
[01:55:17.282 --> 01:55:18.704]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:18.704 --> 01:55:20.646]  Well, hello Alex, how are you?
[01:55:20.646 --> 01:55:33.283]  Yes, I did look at this, not from the theological perspective, because I felt that there were other people who are more qualified than I to analyze it from that direction, and yes, I was looking at it from
[01:55:34.051 --> 01:55:48.462]  The point of view in which they were presenting the Federal Reserve System and attacking the Federal Reserve System and particularly from the point of view of what they proposed as a solution to our problems.
[01:55:48.462 --> 01:55:54.006]  And I found that in this film, which was called Zeitgeist Addendum,
[01:55:54.813 --> 01:55:58.456]  There was a lot that was very good, in the beginning especially.
[01:55:58.456 --> 01:56:01.998]  A lot of critique of the Federal Reserve System.
[01:56:01.998 --> 01:56:03.979]  And I thought, boy, these guys are doing a good job.
[01:56:03.979 --> 01:56:06.581]  And then it began to fall apart.
[01:56:06.581 --> 01:56:16.768]  And they came into some silly stuff about the Fed never is able to create enough money to pay for the interest and a few other myths like that that are widespread.
[01:56:16.768 --> 01:56:23.472]  Well, I could even forgive that because, you know, it doesn't make an awful lot of difference in the final analysis whether you believe that or not.
[01:56:24.873 --> 01:56:30.014]  But then they started getting into this business about, well, how are we going to solve all this problem?
[01:56:30.014 --> 01:56:49.118]  And lo and behold, they had taken Marx and polished him up, taken out the word Marxism and communism, but they kept all of the essential concepts of perfecting mankind, getting rid of his greed, supposedly.
[01:56:49.118 --> 01:56:53.999]  They said that the whole problem of society was the profit motive and the free enterprise system.
[01:56:54.019 --> 01:57:05.484]  Yeah, they implied the Federal Reserve as a free market thing, not a parasitic, rigged monopoly with the Federal Reserve funding the UN and theopacy and centralization of power in the new man.
[01:57:05.484 --> 01:57:07.345]  Well, yes, that's it, of course.
[01:57:07.345 --> 01:57:14.248]  It's one of the greatest myths of the modern age that we live in a free enterprise capitalist system.
[01:57:14.248 --> 01:57:16.569]  That was gone decades ago.
[01:57:17.484 --> 01:57:20.366]  And, uh, but yet it still lives on in name.
[01:57:20.366 --> 01:57:24.549]  And so all of the Marxists and Neo-Marxists love to say, see what's happening today?
[01:57:24.549 --> 01:57:26.610]  That's a result of capitalism.
[01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:31.393]  We must replace capitalism with socialism or some other form of collectivism.
[01:57:32.202 --> 01:57:35.164]  And so they created a boogeyman that doesn't even exist.
[01:57:35.164 --> 01:57:36.444]  And people fall for it.
[01:57:36.444 --> 01:57:42.687]  It's real easy to fall for it because, you know, we were told, I was told when I was a kid that we lived in a free enterprise system.
[01:57:42.687 --> 01:57:46.289]  That probably was true when I was a kid, but it's not true anymore.
[01:57:46.289 --> 01:57:53.393]  The problems we have today are not a result of free enterprise, competitive capitalism, but a result of collectivism, socialism.
[01:57:53.653 --> 01:57:54.674]  All right, stay there.
[01:57:54.674 --> 01:58:02.083]  We're going to break for one minute and come back with five more minutes with G. Edward Griffin and to get Jason Burmiss' comment on this, but Zeitgeist Addendum, a critical review.
[01:58:02.083 --> 01:58:06.969]  We have a link to it up on Infowars.com by G. Edward Griffin.
[01:58:06.969 --> 01:58:10.013]  And what I, what really concerns me is I mildly criticized it.
[01:58:10.817 --> 01:58:24.140]  Without even really doing super deep research just on the basics and a cult-like attack of, you know, I'm just an idiot Christian, I can't even comment on it, there's no such thing as religion, when I wasn't even bringing religion up.
[01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:31.882]  So I said I better look at the religious angle when it turns out this is total New World Order religion.
[01:58:31.882 --> 01:58:35.083]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:35.083 --> 01:58:36.224]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:40.678 --> 01:58:47.424]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:47.424 --> 01:58:50.067]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:58:50.067 --> 01:58:51.608]  But who is the enemy?
[01:58:51.608 --> 01:58:52.429]  Bin Laden.
[01:58:52.429 --> 01:58:53.150]  This is his MO.
[01:58:53.150 --> 01:58:54.811]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:58:54.811 --> 01:58:56.373]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:58:56.773 --> 01:59:03.917]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:59:03.917 --> 01:59:04.397]  Some U.S.
[01:59:04.397 --> 01:59:10.761]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:59:10.761 --> 01:59:14.203]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:59:14.443 --> 01:59:24.733]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:59:24.733 --> 01:59:25.954]  Fabled enemies.
[01:59:25.954 --> 01:59:33.401]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:33.401 --> 01:59:37.124]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:59:43.105 --> 01:59:45.492]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:45.492 --> 01:59:48.281]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:54.878 --> 01:59:56.179]  Big Brother.
[01:59:56.179 --> 01:59:57.959]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:57.959 --> 01:59:59.720]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:01.280]  You want answers?
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:02.181]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:02.181 --> 02:00:07.042]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:07.042 --> 02:00:11.944]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.944 --> 02:00:16.445]  Look, the hottest thing in the world right now is the alternative media and the fight against the New World Order.
[02:00:16.445 --> 02:00:17.586]  It's growing exponentially.
[02:00:18.426 --> 02:00:26.752]  And the New World Order, through its minions, through its noobs, through its useful idiots, are going to try to make a move into the movement.
[02:00:26.752 --> 02:00:29.073]  And there's a unified thing.
[02:00:29.073 --> 02:00:35.517]  People attacking this show, it turns out, are occultists, or are friendly towards it.
[02:00:35.517 --> 02:00:37.859]  And, you know, this is a news program.
[02:00:37.859 --> 02:00:39.240]  I'm covering news and information.
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:41.962]  And so they just bring it up like, oh, he's a Christian, it's all bull.
[02:00:41.962 --> 02:00:43.463]  By the way, we haven't the answer.
[02:00:43.463 --> 02:00:46.525]  It's the withering away of the state, eradicating the
[02:00:48.658 --> 02:00:50.459]  The class system, on and on and on.
[02:00:50.459 --> 02:00:55.121]  And then yesterday, I said, well, what will happen if somebody doesn't want to go along with this system?
[02:00:55.121 --> 02:01:00.163]  And the creator of Zeitgeist and Endem said, well, you'll have to be conditioned.
[02:01:00.163 --> 02:01:03.165]  You'll have to be re-educated.
[02:01:03.165 --> 02:01:09.507]  I mean, folks, for those that know history and study, like myself and Mr. Griffin and others, I mean, we've seen all this a million times.
[02:01:09.507 --> 02:01:10.608]  This is repackaged.
[02:01:11.454 --> 02:01:18.059]  And in closing, I want to bring up Burmese for any comments he's got, but G. Eber Griffin, I want to have you back on later.
[02:01:18.059 --> 02:01:28.228]  Not just getting to this, but how the whole liberty movement itself, I'm sure you've noticed it everywhere, has these people coming into it and saying, well, the New World Order isn't the problem.
[02:01:28.228 --> 02:01:31.030]  We need a good New World Order of the people.
[02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:32.891]  Denying how society operates.
[02:01:32.891 --> 02:01:34.393]  G. Eber Griffin.
[02:01:34.393 --> 02:01:37.675]  Yes, we are right on target, I think, Alex.
[02:01:40.676 --> 02:01:52.680]  Most brilliant qualities of these new world order people is that they understand human nature and they know that there's going to be a tremendous backlash against what they're trying to do.
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:54.840]  So they never just wait for that to happen.
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:02:00.562]  They send their people into the field and say, look, if there's going to be a backlash, let's lead it ourselves.
[02:02:01.082 --> 02:02:05.403]  Or let's be influential on it so that we can control it and make sure that it doesn't go anywhere.
[02:02:05.403 --> 02:02:12.065]  This has happened over and over again throughout history, and you can see it coming up now, of course.
[02:02:12.065 --> 02:02:15.466]  I think you're absolutely right in your observation of that.
[02:02:15.466 --> 02:02:18.707]  Well, there's no doubt that this... I mean, you've seen it.
[02:02:18.707 --> 02:02:24.509]  This is Grade A recycled Fabian Socialist HG Wells
[02:02:25.445 --> 02:02:32.867]  I mean, it's word-for-word what we have seen from the Theophic Society and others.
[02:02:32.867 --> 02:02:40.008]  And God help us, because this is widespread right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:40.008 --> 02:02:42.529]  Alice Bailey, the externalization of the hierarchy.
[02:02:42.529 --> 02:02:46.950]  Let's bring in Jason Burmas briefly to finish up on more comments you've got, Jason.
[02:02:50.377 --> 02:03:13.456]  Somebody offers global governance or a New World Order type scenario, no matter how utopic it may sound for any problem, whether it be the Federal Reserve or 9-11, such as an international tribunal and the end of America, you have to be very suspect of that person off the get-go, and you have to be very critical of their thinking, because what these people want at the top is more consolidation of power.
[02:03:13.456 --> 02:03:14.217]  It's about power.
[02:03:14.497 --> 02:03:17.578]  They always consolidate for the greater good and claim it's going to be a utopia.
[02:03:17.578 --> 02:03:19.178]  I mean, we've heard this over and over again.
[02:03:19.178 --> 02:03:22.839]  All these young people don't know about the history, and they better look into it.
[02:03:22.839 --> 02:03:39.442]  I mean, again, how can you have the leader, the Christ of the UN Theosophic Society, the official UN religion, in the film, and then they tell us, oh, you can't even argue about political systems, you're the old order, you're Christians, and we're not even bringing Christianity up.
[02:03:39.442 --> 02:03:42.163]  I mean, that is always a red flag.
[02:03:42.163 --> 02:03:43.483]  I mean, is that not Jehobrah Griffin?
[02:03:44.176 --> 02:03:44.856]  Yes, it is.
[02:03:44.856 --> 02:03:47.077]  Well, it's not just Christianity.
[02:03:47.077 --> 02:03:57.540]  Any organized religious or powerful religious group is an effeminate to the New World Order people because they're collectivists and they want complete loyalty and dependence upon the state.
[02:03:57.540 --> 02:04:05.962]  The state is the new religion and... Which is what they say, the new scientific state where they're going to scientifically control us and they claim the New World Order currently isn't doing that.
[02:04:05.962 --> 02:04:08.383]  Of course they're setting up a scientific dictatorship.
[02:04:09.022 --> 02:04:12.384]  Yeah, and then that's always been the goal of collectivism.
[02:04:12.384 --> 02:04:19.468]  They like to use the word science because that sounds so advanced, so modern, so intelligent, you know?
[02:04:19.468 --> 02:04:26.012]  But actually there's no science to it at all unless it's the science of human engineering, thought control, that's where the science comes in.
[02:04:26.012 --> 02:04:28.834]  And then they have the nerve to claim that's not a centralized system.
[02:04:28.834 --> 02:04:30.935]  Centralization is the problem.
[02:04:30.935 --> 02:04:32.536]  True diversity is the answer.
[02:04:32.536 --> 02:04:34.117]  Do you ever grip and fire out your website?
[02:04:34.915 --> 02:04:35.355]  Yes.
[02:04:35.355 --> 02:04:36.496]  Pardon, what did you say?
[02:04:36.496 --> 02:04:38.057]  Fire out your website.
[02:04:38.057 --> 02:04:38.837]  Oh, my website.
[02:04:38.837 --> 02:04:48.122]  Well, I think you'll find all those information on our Freedom Force website, and that's www.freedomforceinternational.org.
[02:04:48.122 --> 02:04:49.603]  Okay, thank you, Jim McGriffin.

[02:05:53.745 --> 02:05:55.326]  Loose change, final cut.
[02:05:55.326 --> 02:05:57.466]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:05:57.466 --> 02:05:59.087]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:05:59.087 --> 02:05:59.687]  I think so.
[02:06:17.515 --> 02:06:20.297]  Or you would like a book on the history of the Federal Reserve.
[02:06:20.297 --> 02:06:23.338]  We've got the most well-researched and documented titles.
[02:06:23.338 --> 02:06:25.719]  All available at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:06:25.719 --> 02:06:30.422]  Or if you'd like, you can give the info or store a call at 888-253-3139.

[02:06:37.425 --> 02:06:38.586]  Knowledge is power.
[02:06:38.586 --> 02:06:44.189]  And the information you need to effectively wake up your fellow man and fight the New World Order is available right now.
[02:06:50.753 --> 02:06:55.115]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[02:06:55.115 --> 02:06:57.637]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[02:06:57.637 --> 02:07:03.320]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about the newest hydrogen technology available.
[02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:07.042]  GasFreedom is an affordable, practical, free energy device.
[02:07:07.042 --> 02:07:11.405]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[02:07:13.266 --> 02:07:17.628]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually
[02:07:41.241 --> 02:07:43.322]  To love their servitude.
[02:07:43.322 --> 02:07:53.048]  A people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[02:07:53.048 --> 02:07:58.612]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:07:58.612 --> 02:08:04.195]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:08:04.195 --> 02:08:05.896]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:08:09.321 --> 02:08:12.270]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[02:08:12.270 --> 02:08:14.837]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[02:08:14.837 --> 02:08:17.324]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[02:08:19.497 --> 02:08:25.838]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[02:08:25.838 --> 02:08:32.720]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:37.721]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[02:08:37.721 --> 02:08:40.661]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[02:08:40.661 --> 02:08:44.942]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[02:08:44.942 --> 02:08:47.903]  We have to work with dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[02:08:49.213 --> 02:08:53.316]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[02:08:53.316 --> 02:08:54.578]  Well, join me.
[02:08:54.578 --> 02:08:56.759]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[02:08:56.759 --> 02:09:00.302]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:09:00.302 --> 02:09:07.348]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[02:09:07.348 --> 02:09:14.013]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:09:14.013 --> 02:09:16.996]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:09:29.122 --> 02:09:35.187]  Okay, here in just a few minutes we'll be talking to Sheriff Raymond Franks, former Travis County Sheriff, running for Sheriff.
[02:09:35.187 --> 02:09:43.873]  Then we have Red Beckman joining us coming on the show to talk about how important it is to have good peace officers and good sheriffs.
[02:09:43.873 --> 02:09:48.597]  And then, of course, Officer Jack McClam joining us coming up in about 15 minutes from now.
[02:09:48.597 --> 02:09:49.677]  I wanted to finish up now.
[02:09:50.518 --> 02:09:55.139]  With Jason Bermas on Zeitgeist Addendum.
[02:09:55.139 --> 02:09:58.280]  You know, in closing, Jason, just everything about it is bad.
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:03.622]  They mix in that the Federal Reserve is bad, and they say they have a new world order that's going to be great.
[02:10:03.622 --> 02:10:14.485]  It's total theosophic society, the UN religion, the UN Christ is in it, they're talking about the God Spirit in us, and then telling us that we're just religious.
[02:10:14.485 --> 02:10:17.526]  Well, we're not even talking about religion, because they are religiously obsessed
[02:10:18.466 --> 02:10:19.307]  with this new man.
[02:10:19.307 --> 02:10:25.255]  This is straight-up Albert Pike and we need to expose this because this is aggressive towards us.
[02:10:25.255 --> 02:10:30.201]  I've noticed the whole movement is aggressive but then always acts like if you criticize it, that you don't even count.
[02:10:30.201 --> 02:10:31.983]  You're just an intellectual idiot.
[02:10:31.983 --> 02:10:33.145]  Shut up!
[02:10:33.145 --> 02:10:34.827]  So just classic New World Order tactics.
[02:10:34.827 --> 02:10:35.408]  Jason Burmess?
[02:10:36.195 --> 02:10:41.800]  Yeah, and they also discussed how every civilization before the one that is created won't even be in the history books.
[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:47.844]  It'll be pretty much eviscerated, and we'll just talk about how there were big land grabs and people took stuff from other people.
[02:10:47.844 --> 02:10:50.086]  Well, that's pretty horrifying to me.
[02:10:50.086 --> 02:10:58.273]  I'd like to think that the story of the human spirit is going to live on for generations to come, especially after we defeat these globalists, Alex.
[02:11:00.748 --> 02:11:01.729]  Well, absolutely.
[02:11:01.729 --> 02:11:09.013]  Everything is a process and anybody that tells you that, you know, there's this utopia and the withering away of the state and we're going to re-educate people, look out!
[02:11:09.013 --> 02:11:15.076]  And I just, the public, a lot of people are being suckered by this, but I'm going to have to counter it.
[02:11:15.076 --> 02:11:20.419]  And then they never counter me on any of my facts, like, well, why is this guy, you know, the UN Christ?
[02:11:20.419 --> 02:11:23.321]  I mean, why is he talking about God, God's spirit?
[02:11:23.321 --> 02:11:26.242]  You know, I'm not even bringing up religious systems, you are!
[02:11:26.242 --> 02:11:28.644]  And they just, you know, say, shut up!
[02:11:29.204 --> 02:11:30.706]  You know, you're not even allowed to comment.
[02:11:30.706 --> 02:11:34.309]  I mean, I just go back to that, or they say, you're just jealous of it.
[02:11:34.309 --> 02:11:36.832]  No, I've never even really watched it until now.
[02:11:36.832 --> 02:11:38.113]  I'm not paying attention.
[02:11:38.113 --> 02:11:40.256]  I have everybody on to build everybody up.
[02:11:40.256 --> 02:11:48.805]  I mean, they try every intellectual dishonest trick, the people that are trying to counter us, when I'm just saying, hey man, this is the New World Order group.
[02:11:48.805 --> 02:11:50.627]  This is the Theosophic group.
[02:11:51.447 --> 02:11:54.109]  They have the Christ of the Theosophic group in their film.
[02:11:54.109 --> 02:11:55.710]  That's what they're saying.
[02:11:55.710 --> 02:12:00.574]  This has always been that New World Order, technocratic religion.
[02:12:00.574 --> 02:12:04.397]  You know, where they set up communism and then dangled pictures of high-tech cities in front of you.
[02:12:04.397 --> 02:12:07.239]  I mean, that's the old trick a hundred years ago.
[02:12:07.239 --> 02:12:13.063]  And they're doing the same trick again, and I'm just going, I'm not, you know, I'm going, my God, I know history, I've seen this a million times.
[02:12:13.063 --> 02:12:16.426]  They're like, no, it's new, it's revolutionary, you can't even grasp it.
[02:12:17.506 --> 02:12:24.249]  And, you know, a man is going to quit wanting his neighbor's wife, and people aren't going to want bigger or better houses.
[02:12:24.249 --> 02:12:26.050]  I said, well, can I have a house in this future system?
[02:12:26.050 --> 02:12:29.712]  And he goes, you will have a place where you can go to for privacy.
[02:12:29.712 --> 02:12:31.193]  Well, will I be able to have a gun?
[02:12:31.193 --> 02:12:32.834]  Well, I don't see why you're going to need a gun.
[02:12:32.834 --> 02:12:38.717]  You know, there's going to be all this great peace, and then everything will be according to the load of the earth.
[02:12:38.717 --> 02:12:40.118]  Well, who's going to decide that?
[02:12:40.118 --> 02:12:43.059]  And that's all the theosophic system.
[02:12:43.059 --> 02:12:44.740]  Man, I tell you, Burmese, this is amazing.
[02:12:45.922 --> 02:12:49.184]  Yeah, you know, I was very wary with the original releases.
[02:12:49.184 --> 02:12:52.805]  I thought it was, you know, well-produced, excellently done.
[02:12:52.805 --> 02:12:53.686]  I had a lot of questions.
[02:12:53.686 --> 02:12:58.008]  I actually interviewed Peter Joseph probably two and a half years ago.
[02:12:58.008 --> 02:13:09.154]  And, you know, looking back on it, if you check it out on YouTube, when I asked him, well, how do you feel about people interpreting this as kind of new-agey and futuristic and kind of one-worldy, he got very defensive on that.
[02:13:09.154 --> 02:13:11.195]  He was like, well, what's wrong with that?
[02:13:11.929 --> 02:13:19.435]  You know, I countered it by saying, well, a lot of the proponents of that don't seem to have this great utopian vision for the common man.
[02:13:19.435 --> 02:13:26.701]  It seems like that utopian vision is for the upper echelon, while the rest of us are pretty much drugged and enslaved, Alex.
[02:13:26.701 --> 02:13:26.921]  I mean...
[02:13:28.032 --> 02:13:29.993]  No, no, that's the key, what you just hit on.
[02:13:29.993 --> 02:13:34.954]  This zeitgeist Illuminati view is for the general slaves.
[02:13:34.954 --> 02:13:35.914]  You won't work anymore.
[02:13:35.914 --> 02:13:37.254]  It's going to be heavenly.
[02:13:37.254 --> 02:13:38.715]  The machines will run it all.
[02:13:38.715 --> 02:13:42.416]  That's always what they've put out for the general public the last 150 years.
[02:13:42.416 --> 02:13:47.117]  But for the elite and their real UN policy documents and the Theosophic Society,
[02:13:47.717 --> 02:14:10.654]  It's exterminating the majority of us, and Alice Bailey, and then after that, Barbara Marks Hubbard, saying, you know, we're the pale horse death, we're going to slaughter the majority of people, every Christian must be killed, because their backward system keeps the consciousness from rising, and keeps, and so, I'm like having him on, you know, with a secular show, going, well, you know, what about this and that?
[02:14:10.654 --> 02:14:12.015]  Oh, you're Christianity!
[02:14:12.015 --> 02:14:13.336]  Well, I'm not talking about Christianity.
[02:14:13.516 --> 02:14:14.016]  Christians!
[02:14:14.016 --> 02:14:14.557]  Christians!
[02:14:14.557 --> 02:14:15.157]  Christians!
[02:14:15.157 --> 02:14:16.238]  And other religious people!
[02:14:16.238 --> 02:14:16.978]  It's all made up!
[02:14:16.978 --> 02:14:17.919]  It's not science!
[02:14:17.919 --> 02:14:20.100]  Meanwhile, did you hear about the Theosophic Society?
[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:21.021]  Christ!
[02:14:21.021 --> 02:14:22.742]  And the wonderfulness that's coming!
[02:14:22.742 --> 02:14:25.423]  You know, and I'm like, I mean, this is, this is, this is cult land!
[02:14:25.423 --> 02:14:27.965]  I mean, that's what this is!
[02:14:27.965 --> 02:14:39.732]  Yeah, and I gotta say, Alex, you know, like you stated before, I'm not the most religious guy out there, but you have to give some kind of credence to religion when the upper echelon are out there doing pagan rituals in the woods of
[02:14:40.754 --> 02:14:44.257]  California and Sonoma for two weeks out of the year.
[02:14:44.257 --> 02:14:52.301]  But more than that, the locals protested me in a bunch of newspapers and the Sonoma Free Press and the rest of it because I covered the rituals.
[02:14:52.301 --> 02:14:56.324]  They got real mad about that and then we showed up and they were doing rituals.
[02:14:56.324 --> 02:14:59.326]  The point is, they always claim they're atheists.
[02:14:59.326 --> 02:15:06.230]  That's their cover to discredit the existing system because they have to get rid of the old before they bring in the new that is really the ancient.
[02:15:07.779 --> 02:15:13.726]  I'm with you, Alex, and thank God for people like yourself that continue to expose this system.
[02:15:13.726 --> 02:15:14.587]  I do what I can.
[02:15:14.587 --> 02:15:19.914]  I was on a radio show this morning talking about One World Government, the New World Order, the election.
[02:15:19.914 --> 02:15:24.179]  But yeah, this Zeitgeist Addendum, I'm hoping it won't take off as big as Zeitgeist.
[02:15:24.179 --> 02:15:24.780]  We are giving it
[02:15:25.265 --> 02:15:29.447]  A lot of press, but that's because, you know, a lot of people are coming to us with this stuff.
[02:15:29.447 --> 02:15:30.608]  You know, we're getting emails.
[02:15:30.608 --> 02:15:31.428]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:15:31.428 --> 02:15:32.089]  Exactly.
[02:15:32.089 --> 02:15:34.410]  I mean, people said, hey, what do you think of this?
[02:15:34.410 --> 02:15:35.991]  And I went and watched it.
[02:15:35.991 --> 02:15:37.671]  You told me you were worried about it.
[02:15:37.671 --> 02:15:40.073]  And I went and said, man, I've seen this a hundred times.
[02:15:40.073 --> 02:15:41.393]  This is pure New World Order.
[02:15:41.393 --> 02:15:43.654]  This is their highest level system.
[02:15:43.654 --> 02:15:46.496]  This is what they push, always, for over a hundred years.
[02:15:46.496 --> 02:15:50.058]  And then I got the guy on and he just kind of dissed me.
[02:15:50.598 --> 02:15:57.360]  When I talked about genetics having a big effect, you know, on any point, or on certain breeds of cow being more aggressive, he said, no they're not.
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:15:58.800]  And I'm like, and he goes, science!
[02:15:58.800 --> 02:15:59.320]  Science!
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:00.160]  You don't have science!
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:02.581]  And I'm like, I'm talking about science.
[02:16:02.581 --> 02:16:07.282]  Here, I mean, you know, that's not, you know, I mean, it's, what they're doing is religious.
[02:16:07.282 --> 02:16:09.983]  What they're doing is a religion.
[02:16:09.983 --> 02:16:12.944]  It's the religion of the one world Christ world government state.
[02:16:12.944 --> 02:16:14.384]  Jason Mermis, thanks for being on with us.
[02:16:15.265 --> 02:16:16.626]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:16:16.626 --> 02:16:17.006]  You bet.
[02:16:17.006 --> 02:16:22.088]  Yeah, I mentioned this a few weeks ago because I saw it and was kind of worried about it, but then I thought, oh, these are good guys.
[02:16:22.088 --> 02:16:25.670]  You know, they just mean well, kind of new-agey.
[02:16:25.670 --> 02:16:30.133]  And then I researched it more and I was like, whoa!
[02:16:30.133 --> 02:16:31.713]  Whoa!
[02:16:31.713 --> 02:16:34.755]  This is the top echelon stuff.
[02:16:34.755 --> 02:16:37.116]  I mean, this is the world Christ.
[02:16:37.116 --> 02:16:38.297]  This is the world government.
[02:16:40.334 --> 02:16:42.897]  And man, now I'm like, whoa!
[02:16:42.897 --> 02:16:45.119]  I mean, this is serious.
[02:16:45.119 --> 02:16:47.242]  I should have countered this years ago.
[02:16:47.242 --> 02:16:48.663]  You know, but I tried to play nice.
[02:16:48.663 --> 02:16:50.745]  Well, see, they don't want to play nice, folks.
[02:16:50.745 --> 02:16:52.727]  It's all about how they're high up and you're low down.
[02:16:52.727 --> 02:16:54.229]  It's a mind trick.
[02:16:54.229 --> 02:16:55.650]  Apparently it's a bunch of bull they're putting out.
[02:16:58.071 --> 02:17:02.213]  Raymond Frank, 2008 Republican candidate for Travis County Sheriff.
[02:17:02.213 --> 02:17:05.734]  Website's RaymondFrank.com.
[02:17:05.734 --> 02:17:09.495]  And he will decriminalize marijuana.
[02:17:09.495 --> 02:17:12.497]  He will ban taser use.
[02:17:12.497 --> 02:17:20.580]  He doesn't like to talk about himself, but he's had more combat hours and more hours than anybody else ever.
[02:17:23.357 --> 02:17:24.961]  In his area, the military.
[02:17:24.961 --> 02:17:31.237]  Instead of going over this giant bio, you're also the head of an investigative unit in the military, and again, former Travis County.
[02:17:33.490 --> 02:17:35.551]  Sheriff, now running for Sheriff again.
[02:17:35.551 --> 02:17:37.132]  Special Agent, Lieutenant Colonel with the U.S.
[02:17:37.132 --> 02:17:40.014]  Air Force, Special Investigations for 15 years.
[02:17:40.014 --> 02:17:47.659]  Assignment in Berlin, Paris, London, Weissenbaden, on and on and on, Iceland, South Central Texas, everywhere.
[02:17:47.659 --> 02:17:50.361]  And he was Travis County Sheriff for 8 years.
[02:17:50.361 --> 02:17:55.764]  He holds the Air Force highest aeronautical rating of Command Pilot with 3600 hours.
[02:17:55.764 --> 02:17:57.185]  And we really appreciate
[02:17:57.685 --> 02:18:05.592]  You coming on with us, and we've got some folks, some of your colleagues who are supporting you coming on later in the show, Red Beckman and Jack McClam.
[02:18:05.592 --> 02:18:08.794]  But it is great to have you here with us in studio, Sheriff.
[02:18:08.794 --> 02:18:10.856]  I'm glad to be on your show, Alex.
[02:18:10.856 --> 02:18:13.218]  It's a real privilege.
[02:18:13.218 --> 02:18:15.880]  Tell us a little bit about yourself that I didn't get into in the bio.
[02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:22.806]  Well, I spent 26 and a half years in the military service, and you pretty well covered what I did there.
[02:18:22.806 --> 02:18:24.407]  I came back and
[02:18:25.954 --> 02:18:30.798]  In 1970, and in 1972, I decided to run for sheriff.
[02:18:30.798 --> 02:18:37.183]  That was the first year that 18-year-olds voted, and I was running against a good sheriff.
[02:18:37.183 --> 02:18:41.726]  He'd been in office 20 years, and I was successful in defeating him.
[02:18:41.726 --> 02:18:47.851]  Served four years, was re-elected four years, and I was defeated by a local police officer, Sheriff Dwayne Bailey.
[02:18:48.709 --> 02:19:00.632]  So, but I've seen a lot of things that, some good things have happened since then, but there's a lot of things that I don't like, and I want to do something about it, so that's why I'm running for sheriff.
[02:19:00.632 --> 02:19:05.914]  Alright, we're going to break, but we're going to have you with us at least a half hour to the next hour, so an hour plus.
[02:19:06.594 --> 02:19:15.922]  Uh, with you today, sir, and we'll talk about what you would do as sheriff in Travis County and how we need other people like himself to run for sheriff in other areas and how important the office of the sheriff is.
[02:19:15.922 --> 02:19:21.307]  And we are seeing some other police chiefs and sheriffs now restrict or ban tasers, some of the things you're calling for.
[02:19:21.307 --> 02:19:25.371]  So we'll be discussing that all when we get back on the other side.
[02:19:29.324 --> 02:19:36.067]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:19:36.067 --> 02:19:38.728]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:19:38.728 --> 02:19:40.248]  But who is the enemy?
[02:19:40.248 --> 02:19:41.069]  Bin Laden.
[02:19:41.069 --> 02:19:41.949]  This is his ammo.
[02:19:41.949 --> 02:19:43.430]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:19:43.430 --> 02:19:45.431]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:19:45.431 --> 02:19:52.573]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:19:52.573 --> 02:19:53.054]  Some U.S.
[02:19:53.054 --> 02:19:58.716]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:19:59.396 --> 02:20:03.279]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:20:03.279 --> 02:20:13.387]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:20:13.387 --> 02:20:14.608]  Fabled Enemies.

[02:20:22.374 --> 02:20:25.737]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[02:20:29.139 --> 02:20:35.803]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:20:35.803 --> 02:20:43.929]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:20:43.929 --> 02:20:52.094]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:20:52.094 --> 02:20:56.837]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:20:57.177 --> 02:21:02.399]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:21:02.399 --> 02:21:06.741]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:21:06.741 --> 02:21:07.841]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:07.841 --> 02:21:12.343]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[02:21:17.245 --> 02:21:19.746]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[02:21:22.244 --> 02:21:25.608]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[02:21:35.519 --> 02:21:48.627]  Ionic Zone Shock Treatment Ozone Generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of second-hand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[02:21:48.627 --> 02:21:52.149]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone, do?
[02:21:52.149 --> 02:21:56.632]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[02:21:56.792 --> 02:21:56.972]  I think.
[02:22:11.789 --> 02:22:12.169]  Thank you.
[02:22:28.487 --> 02:22:30.108]  Cameras are everywhere.
[02:22:30.108 --> 02:22:38.495]  Above stoplights, on toll booths, and scamming the freeways just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[02:22:38.495 --> 02:22:42.078]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400.

[02:23:18.573 --> 02:23:19.974]  Don't give your money to the state.
[02:23:19.974 --> 02:23:20.835]  Spray your plate!
[02:23:46.198 --> 02:23:56.740]  Okay, Sheriff Raymond Franks, tell us why you're running for sheriff and what you're going to do and change here in Travis County if you get elected.
[02:23:57.765 --> 02:24:04.247]  Well, the main reason I'm running for sheriff because he's so extravagant in his budget.
[02:24:04.247 --> 02:24:09.649]  And I call it predatory projections that he makes in his budget.
[02:24:09.649 --> 02:24:16.251]  And this in turn provided him access to more money and personnel from the county commissioners.
[02:24:16.251 --> 02:24:22.833]  For instance, he says he'll get 249 tickets a day to meet his yearly projection.
[02:24:22.833 --> 02:24:25.313]  249 tickets a day, that's a lot of tickets.
[02:24:25.313 --> 02:24:26.914]  You know how long it takes to write a ticket.
[02:24:28.041 --> 02:24:32.464]  During that same time, he'll work 22 accidents a day.
[02:24:32.464 --> 02:24:35.665]  That takes at least an hour, tying up two units.
[02:24:35.665 --> 02:24:39.507]  Then the big thing is calls for service.
[02:24:39.507 --> 02:24:45.491]  360 calls per service for 24 hours a day to meet his yearly projection.
[02:24:46.091 --> 02:24:48.776]  And that's why I'm calling them predatory projections.
[02:24:48.776 --> 02:24:54.284]  Well, bottom line, in the past, if a car got robbed or a house got broke into, the police or sheriffs would show up.
[02:24:54.284 --> 02:24:57.229]  Now, all over the country, they're saying, we're just not going to show up most of the time.
[02:24:57.229 --> 02:24:58.851]  We're too busy writing tickets.
[02:24:59.352 --> 02:25:00.933]  That's exactly right.
[02:25:00.933 --> 02:25:06.414]  And they have in their budget right now over $200,000 in performance pay.
[02:25:06.414 --> 02:25:15.597]  And what that is, is it goes for people to do an outstanding job writing tickets, but there's still a lot of that money appropriated in the corrections area.
[02:25:15.597 --> 02:25:17.358]  So I don't know exactly how that's distributed.
[02:25:17.398 --> 02:25:18.818]  What would you do with illegal aliens?
[02:25:18.818 --> 02:25:23.359]  Because, you know, this is a sanctuary city and county, and they're above citizens.
[02:25:23.359 --> 02:25:26.740]  They get to drink and drive, not have ID, not have insurance.
[02:25:26.740 --> 02:25:32.361]  A citizen literally just gets clobbered if they have a crooked toenail, but illegal aliens can do whatever they want.
[02:25:32.361 --> 02:25:38.902]  Well, for immigrants that do not have documents, I don't know what I'd do.
[02:25:38.902 --> 02:25:44.083]  I mean, I'll tell you, if they're put in jail by people, we're not going to look for them.
[02:25:44.083 --> 02:25:46.203]  My department's not going to look for them, but we will
[02:25:46.906 --> 02:25:49.247]  Have them in jail and take care of them.
[02:25:49.247 --> 02:25:54.929]  But we will not allow an ICE agent to have an office in the Travis County Jail.
[02:25:54.929 --> 02:25:57.130]  ICE is part of Homeland Security.
[02:25:57.130 --> 02:25:58.811]  And that federalizes the department.
[02:25:58.811 --> 02:25:59.772]  That's right.
[02:25:59.772 --> 02:26:09.856]  Once they get their foot in the door, you know, they'll want something... I understand all that, but I mean, why do I get arrested if I don't have an ID, but a lawyer doesn't?
[02:26:10.897 --> 02:26:12.638]  I don't know.
[02:26:12.638 --> 02:26:15.840]  I will fight against it whenever I have a chance.
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:19.503]  I'd be glad to let them let me drive without a license or insurance.
[02:26:19.503 --> 02:26:20.523]  I think it's a free market.
[02:26:20.523 --> 02:26:21.464]  Sue somebody if they hurt you.
[02:26:21.464 --> 02:26:23.846]  The point is, I'm tired of all this socialism.
[02:26:23.846 --> 02:26:27.008]  The point is, I don't like illegal aliens having more rights than I do.
[02:26:27.008 --> 02:26:27.988]  Well, that's not right.
[02:26:27.988 --> 02:26:29.629]  I know they do.
[02:26:29.629 --> 02:26:32.011]  And it should change.
[02:26:32.011 --> 02:26:35.433]  A lot of those undocumented aliens are going back to Mexico.
[02:26:35.433 --> 02:26:35.954]  Yeah.
[02:26:35.954 --> 02:26:37.675]  Because they can't make a living here anymore.
[02:26:38.752 --> 02:26:41.494]  That's right, the globalists have sucked the country dry.
[02:26:41.494 --> 02:26:43.957]  Sheriff, you talk about decriminalizing marijuana.
[02:26:43.957 --> 02:26:45.058]  Tell us about that.
[02:26:45.058 --> 02:27:00.892]  Yeah, well, right now, the class B misdemeanor, two ounces or more, it's 180 days in jail and a $2,000 fine, and I want to lower that to a misdemeanor, which would be a $500 fine, and that is decriminalization of marijuana.
[02:27:01.452 --> 02:27:03.453]  I don't advocate the use of it.
[02:27:03.453 --> 02:27:05.433]  I'm just saying that I want to do that to you.
[02:27:05.433 --> 02:27:05.933]  I don't either.
[02:27:05.933 --> 02:27:08.814]  You can hardly hire good employees because they're all so stoned in Austin.
[02:27:08.814 --> 02:27:13.395]  But the point is, is that they've got all these ads saying marijuana is terrorism.
[02:27:13.395 --> 02:27:16.576]  Marijuana has no connection to terrorism like cocaine and heroin.
[02:27:16.576 --> 02:27:19.316]  It has no connection to funding terrorism.
[02:27:19.316 --> 02:27:23.838]  And 87% of illegal drug users only use marijuana.
[02:27:23.838 --> 02:27:25.098]  And I don't think it's as bad as alcohol.
[02:27:25.658 --> 02:27:28.701]  I mean, I'd be against people stumbling around drunk on the job, too.
[02:27:28.701 --> 02:27:30.243]  The problem is, it's just all the potheads.
[02:27:30.243 --> 02:27:35.549]  I mean, I don't even like potheads, but the point is, you're right, you shouldn't be throwing them in prison.
[02:27:35.549 --> 02:27:38.092]  No, there's no place for them in prison.
[02:27:38.092 --> 02:27:44.419]  Now, the Austin Police Department, if they could pick up somebody with a small amount of marijuana, they'll give a citation.
[02:27:45.379 --> 02:27:47.260]  But that's not what the law says.
[02:27:47.260 --> 02:27:50.023]  If they want to do it, I think that's their policy.
[02:27:50.023 --> 02:27:52.925]  And I don't know what the Sheriff's Department does.
[02:27:52.925 --> 02:27:55.827]  I'm not familiar with what they do when they pick somebody up.
[02:27:55.827 --> 02:27:57.648]  They probably comply with the law.
[02:27:57.648 --> 02:28:01.171]  But you're saying that you're going to decriminalize?
[02:28:01.171 --> 02:28:02.132]  That's right.
[02:28:02.132 --> 02:28:04.133]  I did that in 72.
[02:28:04.133 --> 02:28:07.676]  I appeared before the, no, 73, when the legislature met.
[02:28:07.676 --> 02:28:09.997]  That's my first year in office.
[02:28:09.997 --> 02:28:11.659]  The senator in charge of the
[02:28:12.654 --> 02:28:22.502]  Jurisprudence Committee was Charles Herring, a senator from Austin, Texas, and I advocated the decriminalization then of marijuana.
[02:28:22.502 --> 02:28:26.786]  See, in those days, you could get 10 years in the state penitentiary for having a cigarette.
[02:28:26.786 --> 02:28:27.527]  10 years.
[02:28:27.527 --> 02:28:32.331]  Now, Travis County didn't send them down there, but the so-called redneck counties did.
[02:28:35.116 --> 02:28:43.523]  My mom talked about in college, if anybody had long hair in the car, they'd pull you over and just tear your car apart, and if they found any marijuana, people would go to prison.
[02:28:43.523 --> 02:28:51.791]  But if you were wearing football jerseys and had short hair, you could be as drunk as you wanted, riding around shooting signs with shotguns, and they'd just smile at you.
[02:28:51.791 --> 02:28:53.633]  That's not right.
[02:28:53.633 --> 02:28:54.434]  I know that happens.
[02:28:55.496 --> 02:28:55.876]  Stay there.
[02:28:55.876 --> 02:28:56.797]  Long segment coming up.
[02:28:56.797 --> 02:29:00.238]  Plenty of time to get into tasers and a lot more in your website.
[02:29:00.238 --> 02:29:01.159]  Folks, donate to him.
[02:29:01.159 --> 02:29:01.619]  Get involved.
[02:29:01.619 --> 02:29:03.840]  I know there's a lot of election fraud in Travis County.
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:07.842]  But if there's a huge turnout for Raymond Franks, they may not be able to cover that up.
[02:29:07.842 --> 02:29:09.002]  He's a great guy.
[02:29:09.002 --> 02:29:13.024]  I can't think of having a better sheriff than Raymond Franks.
[02:29:13.024 --> 02:29:15.045]  He's somebody we really need here in Travis County.
[02:29:15.045 --> 02:29:19.487]  Stay with us.
[02:29:19.487 --> 02:29:20.867]  We're on the march.
[02:29:20.867 --> 02:29:22.368]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:23.401 --> 02:29:26.090]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:29.767 --> 02:29:33.269]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:29:33.269 --> 02:29:38.691]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:29:38.691 --> 02:29:43.834]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:29:43.834 --> 02:29:54.959]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:29:55.359 --> 02:30:01.123]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:30:01.123 --> 02:30:07.388]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:30:07.388 --> 02:30:08.429]  What about you?

[02:30:29.404 --> 02:30:35.128]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[02:30:35.128 --> 02:30:36.410]  And we knew what to do.
[02:30:36.410 --> 02:30:38.451]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:30:38.451 --> 02:30:45.477]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:30:45.477 --> 02:30:48.700]  Whitman, EPA Director,
[02:30:49.167 --> 02:30:54.372]  On the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:30:54.372 --> 02:31:01.478]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:31:01.478 --> 02:31:04.641]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:31:04.641 --> 02:31:10.427]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:31:10.427 --> 02:31:12.989]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[02:31:49.384 --> 02:31:51.526]  Annihilate acid reflux.

[02:32:13.504 --> 02:32:14.645]  You've heard it.
[02:32:14.645 --> 02:32:14.845]  928-308-0408.
[02:32:14.845 --> 02:32:15.565]  You have Red Beckman?
[02:32:21.790 --> 02:32:22.350]  I sure do.
[02:32:22.350 --> 02:32:23.051]  He's all set and ready.
[02:32:23.051 --> 02:32:24.212]  Alright, tell him I got him in five minutes.
[02:32:24.212 --> 02:32:24.692]  Here we go.
[02:32:24.692 --> 02:32:32.377]  Okay.
[02:32:32.377 --> 02:32:36.800]  Come, you masters of war.
[02:32:36.800 --> 02:32:41.163]  Here to build the big guns.
[02:32:41.163 --> 02:32:45.486]  Here to build the death planes.
[02:32:45.486 --> 02:32:47.388]  Here to build all the bombs.
[02:32:49.810 --> 02:33:02.023]  We're going to bring Red Beckman up for the balance of the hour with Sheriff Raymond Franks talking about the proper role of the sheriff who's elected by the people.
[02:33:03.579 --> 02:33:05.901]  We see sheriff's departments being abolished all over the country.
[02:33:05.901 --> 02:33:08.324]  We see the cities taking over the sheriff's departments.
[02:33:08.324 --> 02:33:17.532]  Well, the sheriff's departments are the county that is commissioned and empowered by state law and by the state and by the legislature and then by the people that elect them at the county.
[02:33:17.532 --> 02:33:20.975]  So that is above the city that's an incorporated private corporation.
[02:33:21.897 --> 02:33:27.160]  And so, you know, we see this centralization of power away from the people.
[02:33:27.160 --> 02:33:34.745]  We're going to be talking about that with the father, the grandfather, of the Fully Informed Jury Association, an expert on this, Red Beckman, coming up in about 30 minutes.
[02:33:34.745 --> 02:33:39.527]  Jack McClam is going to join us, and riding shotgun the entire time, will be Sheriff Raymond Frank.
[02:33:39.527 --> 02:33:41.449]  RaymondFrank.com.
[02:33:41.449 --> 02:33:45.551]  Raymond, R-A-Y-M-O-N-D, Frank, dot com.
[02:33:45.551 --> 02:33:46.912]  So please check it out.
[02:33:47.452 --> 02:33:55.898]  And, you know, if you're a person who's a retired peace officer, or you were a sheriff before, or a sheriff's deputy, why don't you run in your area?
[02:33:55.898 --> 02:33:57.679]  Why don't you educate the public about this?
[02:33:57.679 --> 02:34:00.101]  This is one way to hold back the tyranny.
[02:34:00.101 --> 02:34:05.585]  Going back to Sheriff Raymond Frank, tasers, you're saying you're going to ban them for use in the sheriff's department?
[02:34:05.585 --> 02:34:06.926]  Absolutely.
[02:34:06.926 --> 02:34:12.190]  No place for, it's a torturous weapon, no place for it in my department.
[02:34:12.190 --> 02:34:15.092]  And how did you come upon that understanding, that realization?
[02:34:15.669 --> 02:34:30.096]  Well, I've done a lot of study, and the military won't use it, and they give a reason why, and it's based upon torture, and I'm against torture of any type, and I decided that that's the way it's going to be.
[02:34:30.096 --> 02:34:36.239]  Over 310 people have died in Canada and the United States as a result of Tasering.
[02:34:36.239 --> 02:34:37.960]  Now, by the way, that's a conservative number.
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:43.505]  Well, that's what's been commonly reported in the newspapers.
[02:34:43.505 --> 02:34:55.896]  290 in America, and I'm not saying that the taser itself killed the guy, but the response later, he died from it, so maybe they fell from the balcony or something like that.
[02:34:55.896 --> 02:35:02.222]  Well, there have been a bunch of coroners and cardiologists have said it is killing people.
[02:35:03.587 --> 02:35:05.369]  Well, I believe it.
[02:35:05.369 --> 02:35:08.050]  By the way, they're boosting them from 50,000 watts to 75,000 watts.
[02:35:08.050 --> 02:35:10.612]  Yeah, I know that.
[02:35:10.612 --> 02:35:14.915]  At the Cal Palace in San Francisco, they had one on display.
[02:35:14.915 --> 02:35:16.816]  It attracted a lot of attention.
[02:35:16.816 --> 02:35:18.537]  Well, I mean, this is intimidation, too.
[02:35:18.537 --> 02:35:28.084]  When they have those secret FEMA camps we exposed in Denver, it's set inside the barbed wire fences, you know, electric shock systems used here, and that's all part of... and these are cattle prods.
[02:35:28.646 --> 02:35:30.126]  God, it's horrible.
[02:35:30.126 --> 02:35:34.267]  And now I understand they have bracelets that will fit on you that they can apply.
[02:35:34.267 --> 02:35:40.528]  Homeland Security wants to make it, and Homeland Security did say they want it, to make everybody who flies wear a taser bracelet.
[02:35:40.528 --> 02:35:41.668]  God, it's horrible.
[02:35:41.668 --> 02:35:41.948]  Terrible.
[02:35:41.948 --> 02:35:43.689]  I mean, who can come up with this stuff?
[02:35:43.689 --> 02:35:46.009]  It's not like out of a science fiction movie.
[02:35:46.009 --> 02:35:48.269]  It sure is.
[02:35:48.269 --> 02:35:48.930]  Absolutely.
[02:35:48.930 --> 02:35:54.150]  I want to do what I can to... I saw you had an article about those types that are fired out of 12 gauges, too.
[02:35:54.150 --> 02:35:54.590]  That's right.
[02:35:54.590 --> 02:35:55.971]  It'll go 100 feet.
[02:35:55.971 --> 02:35:56.611]  Where is that article?
[02:35:56.611 --> 02:35:57.211]  I want to show people.
[02:35:58.399 --> 02:36:00.642]  It'll go 100 feet.
[02:36:00.642 --> 02:36:14.581]  No, this is, that's a guy in New York that, recently a guy from New York was on a balcony, obviously a mental health patient of some type, and they decided to go ahead and taser him, and he fell 10 or 12 feet to the concrete.
[02:36:15.884 --> 02:36:17.906]  And died in a hospital an hour later.
[02:36:17.906 --> 02:36:24.890]  And the sad thing was that the man that shot him with the taser, the police officer, took his own life a couple days later.
[02:36:24.890 --> 02:36:27.112]  That was reported on NBC News.
[02:36:27.112 --> 02:36:29.513]  Yeah, he was the one that ordered them to shoot him.
[02:36:29.513 --> 02:36:31.495]  Just a terrible situation.
[02:36:31.495 --> 02:36:36.898]  And we've also seen the culture shift from the police and the sheriff's deputies being guardians of the people and being liked.
[02:36:36.898 --> 02:36:38.740]  You know, by and large, we're still some bad apples.
[02:36:38.740 --> 02:36:41.461]  To now, it really is a us-against-them mentality.
[02:36:41.461 --> 02:36:43.283]  How are they indoctrinating that into the police?
[02:36:45.006 --> 02:36:46.587]  I don't know for sure.
[02:36:46.587 --> 02:36:52.092]  I'm real anxious to find out what's going on in the Sheriff's Department Academy, what they teach.
[02:36:52.092 --> 02:36:54.374]  Do they teach anything about ethics?
[02:36:54.374 --> 02:37:05.943]  That's very important to me because of what happened in the Sheriff's Department recently where a guy was paying a man $10,000 if he would retire early so he could get promoted.
[02:37:05.943 --> 02:37:08.585]  That made the paper for a couple of days.
[02:37:08.585 --> 02:37:13.369]  Those are, you know, they're taking advantage of the public trust and that's not right.
[02:37:15.129 --> 02:37:16.209]  Amazing.
[02:37:16.209 --> 02:37:20.631]  I want to bring Red Beckman up and we'll have plenty of time to get more into what you'll do as sheriff if you get elected again.
[02:37:20.631 --> 02:37:24.732]  You were in for eight years previously, been out of office for a while.
[02:37:24.732 --> 02:37:42.779]  Red Beckman, I wanted to get you on to comment on the important role of good sheriffs and the true power that sheriffs have as being the most, you know, powerful elected guardian of the people in a county and the move we're seeing to disarm them, to geld the sheriff's departments.
[02:37:42.779 --> 02:37:43.639]  Red Beckman, welcome.
[02:37:45.387 --> 02:37:47.308]  Good to be with you again.
[02:37:47.308 --> 02:37:52.331]  Well, we've got a great guy on the line, Red Beckman, another great gentleman here with us, Raymond Frank.
[02:37:52.331 --> 02:37:55.353]  What do you think so far you're hearing about this man?
[02:37:55.353 --> 02:38:09.661]  Well, you know, our county sheriffs, nobody really understands, they just haven't been taught that the county sheriff is your best friend in your county.
[02:38:11.057 --> 02:38:18.484]  He was supposed to be, rather than an antagonist or an enemy.
[02:38:18.484 --> 02:38:30.936]  They were to look out for the people, and especially the people that are vulnerable to the scam artists and all that type of thing.
[02:38:30.936 --> 02:38:34.059]  They just don't understand because they were never taught.
[02:38:35.876 --> 02:38:52.463]  You know, I was at a meeting a week or so ago and I said, if I was to put in one simple sentence the problem that we have in this country is that we have overdosed on propaganda.
[02:38:52.463 --> 02:38:58.646]  They feed us all this stuff calling it education and it's not an education, it's propaganda.
[02:38:59.518 --> 02:39:13.228]  And when they start telling people what the sheriff's position is really all about and how he's supposed to function, that's when you'll see sheriffs that will operate the way they are supposed to.
[02:39:13.228 --> 02:39:26.717]  You know, we've got people that are in sheriff's offices all over this country that don't have a clue the real, you know, the real principle behind a sheriff's system as we were given back there a long time ago.
[02:39:27.692 --> 02:39:32.676]  And they just don't know.
[02:39:32.676 --> 02:39:39.521]  Well, this ties into the entire system of the state and its relationship to the federal system.
[02:39:39.521 --> 02:39:49.429]  How they're gelding and taking over the sheriffs and turning them into minions of the cities that are supposed to be under them because the cities are creatures of the state and the people.
[02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:53.012]  How they're dummying up the juries, the grand juries, all of it.
[02:39:53.012 --> 02:39:54.453]  How does this tie together, Red Beckman?
[02:39:55.137 --> 02:40:06.462]  Well, you see, ignorance, people that don't know the truth are easily manipulated and used.
[02:40:06.462 --> 02:40:10.343]  And so truth has to be, we have to get it out there.
[02:40:10.343 --> 02:40:14.665]  We have to get it out there to where it's available to people.
[02:40:14.665 --> 02:40:19.527]  And of course, the situation we've got right now in this country, we've never
[02:40:20.765 --> 02:40:21.506]  I think so.
[02:40:45.069 --> 02:40:54.098]  People are very uncomfortable with what's going on and as a result they're paying attention to what we're saying.
[02:40:54.098 --> 02:41:04.988]  I'm an optimist, I always have been and I will be until the day I die, because we do have truth that's available.
[02:41:07.668 --> 02:41:19.154]  It's available and people at this point are ready to learn and so our responsibility is to get the truth out there and let them, you know, hear the truth.
[02:41:19.154 --> 02:41:30.300]  And of course this thing with these tasers, I'll tell you, this is just, the gentleman you have there calling it torture, it's absolutely no other word for it.
[02:41:30.300 --> 02:41:32.801]  Fits it like calling it torture.
[02:41:33.619 --> 02:41:40.662]  And of course, the Founding Fathers, they insisted that we not have a standing army in this country.
[02:41:40.662 --> 02:41:52.526]  Well, when the Feds step in and when they start dictating to the Sheriff and the State Highway Patrol and everybody else, you end up, you've got a standing army.
[02:41:52.526 --> 02:42:02.270]  And in the Forest Service, we always admired the Forest Service and their
[02:42:03.286 --> 02:42:06.568]  Work with Smokey Bear and this type of thing.
[02:42:06.568 --> 02:42:09.049]  Now, they've become law enforcement.
[02:42:09.049 --> 02:42:13.031]  Your Rangers out there in the hills are carrying guns.
[02:42:13.031 --> 02:42:14.771]  The BLM people.
[02:42:14.771 --> 02:42:26.357]  Well, the attitude, not just of the militarizing and turning all these other groups into police, and then militarizing, not just militarized police, but militarizing groups that weren't even policed previously,
[02:42:27.097 --> 02:42:32.565]  Is that it is an attitude at national parks and state parks and cops all over the country.
[02:42:32.565 --> 02:42:36.230]  It's rare to have a cop open a door for you and smile at you and be nice.
[02:42:36.230 --> 02:42:39.775]  Most of the time they look at you like you're a pile of steaming dog dew.
[02:42:39.775 --> 02:42:41.257]  I'm sorry to talk like that.
[02:42:41.257 --> 02:42:42.859]  Sheriff Franks, how did this happen?
[02:42:44.434 --> 02:42:46.855]  Well, I think Red hit the nail on the head.
[02:42:46.855 --> 02:42:50.135]  I think some of the sheriffs have been real lax.
[02:42:50.135 --> 02:42:54.956]  They're drawing a pretty darn good salary, and they're just letting things go.
[02:42:54.956 --> 02:43:04.459]  For instance, years ago, under Ronnie Earle and Judge Calvert, they tried to rewrite the Texas Constitution.
[02:43:04.459 --> 02:43:09.900]  And in that, they left it up to the legislature to decide whether or not a county would have a sheriff.
[02:43:10.552 --> 02:43:15.714]  Well, I was on the committee to fight that, and it was defeated.
[02:43:15.714 --> 02:43:22.916]  And if I'm elected sheriff, I want to be back on that committee because I... Exactly, because they're shutting sheriff's departments down all over the country.
[02:43:22.916 --> 02:43:32.420]  Yeah, we're a constitutional office, and I want... Travis County citizens, to me... And you have these unconstitutional municipal systems lobbying to get rid of you.
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:33.820]  Yeah, I know.
[02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:34.941]  Or absorb you.
[02:43:34.941 --> 02:43:39.202]  I want the citizens to realize that I look at them as my family.
[02:43:39.202 --> 02:43:44.624]  They're the ones that give the $118 million for the Travis County Sheriff's Department.
[02:43:44.624 --> 02:43:48.385]  I don't want my department to look at the people of Travis County as the enemy.
[02:43:48.385 --> 02:43:49.325]  Or food.
[02:43:49.325 --> 02:43:50.986]  They're our friends.
[02:43:50.986 --> 02:43:53.027]  I mean, we're now seeing as food.
[02:43:53.027 --> 02:43:55.688]  And I'm going to make a lot of changes.
[02:43:55.688 --> 02:43:56.328]  We're going to order
[02:43:57.308 --> 02:44:07.430]  For instance, MREs, and have a big stock of those, because I know things are going to happen in this county and in America in the next couple years, it's going to be real bad.
[02:44:07.430 --> 02:44:15.232]  Well, I mean, regardless of whether it's going to happen or not, every county should be prepared its own self to help the public, not always wait on FEMA and the Feds.
[02:44:15.232 --> 02:44:21.853]  Yeah, now I think it looks to me like the department is just looking who they can give a ticket to.
[02:44:22.856 --> 02:44:23.757]  May I interject something?
[02:44:23.757 --> 02:44:23.817]  Yes.
[02:44:48.375 --> 02:44:58.337]  Um, I had to make a run into town this morning and get a haircut and the barber was telling me about how he said, uh, you have to be real careful right now.
[02:44:58.337 --> 02:45:07.639]  He said, uh, uh, the city cops and the highway patrol are out just handing out tickets wholesale.
[02:45:07.639 --> 02:45:10.680]  Uh, they must be running low on revenue.
[02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:17.061]  And, um, I said, well, they are because you see, as the stock market goes down,
[02:45:18.739 --> 02:45:28.407]  Uh, you know, there are some that say that as much as 65% of the risk capital, that's your capital in Wall Street and the stock market.
[02:45:28.407 --> 02:45:32.090]  Our counties, cities, water districts, school districts, they've all in it.
[02:45:32.090 --> 02:45:45.602]  Yeah, and you see, these investors, these government entities, they didn't want to cut the price of fuel, they wanted Exxon to have
[02:45:46.529 --> 02:45:46.869]  I don't
[02:46:02.503 --> 02:46:09.747]  Even your local school boards, and your... all your different boards.
[02:46:09.747 --> 02:46:11.528]  Every county has got them.
[02:46:11.528 --> 02:46:13.189]  Planning boards, always.
[02:46:13.189 --> 02:46:20.172]  That was the comprehensive annual financial reports, and now with all these unfunded mandates and the rest of it, everything's going bankrupt.
[02:46:20.172 --> 02:46:24.094]  And believe me, folks, now that you don't have jobs, they're going to squeeze you even tighter.
[02:46:24.094 --> 02:46:26.355]  I mean, at a certain point, it's going to implode.
[02:46:26.355 --> 02:46:28.937]  I mean, how are cops going to squeeze blood out of a stone?
[02:46:29.517 --> 02:46:30.218]  Yes.
[02:46:30.218 --> 02:46:33.140]  Sheriff Franks, I mean, how is that going to happen as the economy gets worse?
[02:46:33.140 --> 02:46:46.590]  It's going to be real serious and it's going to be up to a good sheriff to take care of his people and not take advantage of, you know, giving excessive number of tickets and things like that and concentrate on protecting our families.
[02:46:46.590 --> 02:46:48.792]  I mean, here's my question.
[02:46:48.792 --> 02:46:53.315]  I had my car broken into more than a decade ago, everything stolen, you know, the stereo, stuff like that.
[02:46:54.235 --> 02:46:55.877]  Police wouldn't come out.
[02:46:55.877 --> 02:46:57.359]  I was in Dallas years ago.
[02:46:57.359 --> 02:47:00.023]  My car got stolen.
[02:47:00.023 --> 02:47:01.926]  Cops laughed at me and said, we can't help you.
[02:47:01.926 --> 02:47:07.193]  I hung up and they showed up mad saying, you don't hang up until we give you permission to hang up on 9-1-1.
[02:47:07.193 --> 02:47:09.095]  And then I've read all these articles around the country.
[02:47:09.736 --> 02:47:17.598]  Where the police are now saying, we're not even going to come to basic home invasions and basic robberies now, but we're going to be out there focusing on writing tickets to raise revenue.
[02:47:17.598 --> 02:47:19.319]  That's a serious crime now.
[02:47:19.319 --> 02:47:23.020]  They've said police aren't there to protect you and they have no liability to do it.
[02:47:23.020 --> 02:47:26.461]  But still, that's the overall idea they're putting out.
[02:47:26.461 --> 02:47:30.002]  Your comments on that, Sheriff Franks and then Red Beckman.
[02:47:30.803 --> 02:47:36.675]  The other day when I was campaigning, a young man that lives in Manor, Texas called the Sheriff's Office for assistance.
[02:47:36.675 --> 02:47:37.416]  Some problem.
[02:47:37.416 --> 02:47:42.286]  It wasn't a real major problem, but it was a problem to him and should have been dealt with by the county.
[02:47:43.058 --> 02:47:47.001]  And they told him, no, we don't have time to fool with that.
[02:47:47.001 --> 02:47:53.465]  I can't believe that the sheriff would allow his people to take that kind of an attitude and have that type of a policy.
[02:47:53.465 --> 02:47:57.608]  Well, also, 911 times have gone from 6 minutes to 8 minutes to 10 minutes to 12 minutes.
[02:47:57.608 --> 02:48:01.831]  The national average, I just saw it last week, 14 and a half minutes.
[02:48:01.831 --> 02:48:05.253]  But the government wants our guns, but then says the cops will be there in 14 minutes.
[02:48:06.903 --> 02:48:07.943]  Let me tell you something else.
[02:48:07.943 --> 02:48:22.290]  In the budget, in this past budget that ended September 30th, the Sheriff's Department purchased 79 new patrol cars, Crown Victorias, V8s, and got 25 additional personnel for their law enforcement bureau.
[02:48:22.290 --> 02:48:23.770]  I don't know what the bureau is, but
[02:48:26.366 --> 02:48:29.349]  Those that equipment and personnel are used to ride tickets.
[02:48:29.349 --> 02:48:36.275]  That's primarily what they do because there's portions of County Travis County is not protected by the sheriff's office.
[02:48:36.275 --> 02:48:39.938]  They have allowed the constables to take over at least two areas.
[02:48:39.938 --> 02:48:46.023]  And in other words, those citizens have to pay the constable for protection and they're already County taxpayers.
[02:48:46.023 --> 02:48:46.904]  They're entitled to
[02:48:47.304 --> 02:48:52.449]  Well, that's because most of the money is taken and invested in the stock market, which, by the way, police, you're never going to see in your pension.
[02:48:52.449 --> 02:48:53.189]  It's never coming.
[02:48:53.189 --> 02:48:53.830]  It's over.
[02:48:53.830 --> 02:48:57.473]  The globalists are stealing it all right now, and I told you ten years ago it would happen, and you laughed.
[02:48:57.473 --> 02:48:59.715]  You're going to find out how much your new order loves you.
[02:48:59.715 --> 02:49:01.577]  What about this, Red Beckman?
[02:49:01.577 --> 02:49:09.204]  It came out yesterday that 34% of all the police in Atlanta are violent felons or violent criminals.
[02:49:09.204 --> 02:49:12.467]  I mean, assaults, beating their wives before they're cops.
[02:49:13.607 --> 02:49:18.429]  Well, that doesn't surprise me about Atlanta, because they say they can't get anybody.
[02:49:18.429 --> 02:49:20.210]  Well, big cities such as Atlanta,
[02:49:40.561 --> 02:49:59.729]  They have, you know, they mollycoddled the criminals and such for so long, and well, it's not just there, it's in the community where I'm at here in the state of Washington, 40,000 to 50,000 people here in a matter of 25 or 30 miles.
[02:49:59.729 --> 02:50:01.830]  That's not very many people.
[02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:07.832]  But they have all of these people running around that make a living.
[02:50:08.630 --> 02:50:09.751]  Off of crime.
[02:50:09.751 --> 02:50:14.074]  And, uh, they should be, uh, locked up or something.
[02:50:14.074 --> 02:50:20.639]  There has to be something done, uh, to, you know, to stop this crime wave.
[02:50:20.639 --> 02:50:21.340]  But they don't.
[02:50:21.340 --> 02:50:22.261]  They get the... Exactly.
[02:50:22.261 --> 02:50:28.325]  They leave the criminals alone and the illegal aliens alone, and they just squeeze the soccer mom and win five miles over the speed limit.
[02:50:28.325 --> 02:50:28.886]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:29.594 --> 02:50:33.799]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[02:50:33.799 --> 02:50:38.805]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings account?
[02:50:38.805 --> 02:50:44.131]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard-earned savings?
[02:50:44.131 --> 02:50:46.054]  You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[02:50:46.254 --> 02:50:46.834]  We're good to go.
[02:51:15.455 --> 02:51:20.618]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:51:20.618 --> 02:51:22.259]  The enemy struck America on September 11.
[02:51:39.006 --> 02:51:40.367]  Who is the enemy?
[02:51:40.367 --> 02:51:41.168]  Bin Laden.
[02:51:41.168 --> 02:51:42.169]  This is his M.O.
[02:51:42.169 --> 02:51:43.530]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:51:43.530 --> 02:51:45.531]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:51:45.531 --> 02:51:52.696]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:51:52.696 --> 02:51:53.157]  Some U.S.
[02:51:53.157 --> 02:51:58.801]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:51:59.501 --> 02:52:03.023]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:52:03.023 --> 02:52:13.487]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:52:13.487 --> 02:52:14.708]  Fabled enemies.

[02:52:36.257 --> 02:52:37.498]  Just in case?
[02:52:37.498 --> 02:52:40.259]  With the current state of affairs, ask yourself, am I ready?

[02:53:18.343 --> 02:53:19.084]  Sending out an SOS.
[02:53:19.084 --> 02:53:20.364]  This is not a free society.
[02:53:20.364 --> 02:53:23.146]  We're losing our hard fought and hard won liberties.
[02:53:39.175 --> 02:53:42.817]  We're going into a global control system.
[02:53:42.817 --> 02:53:48.439]  By the way, John, I want to start the next hour with the Drag'em Off the Interstate, Sockitum, J.P.
[02:53:48.439 --> 02:53:49.720]  Blues.
[02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:51.221]  So cue that up.
[02:53:51.221 --> 02:53:52.081]  Sheriff Frank, you're laughing.
[02:53:52.081 --> 02:53:52.841]  Have you heard that song?
[02:53:52.841 --> 02:53:54.302]  Yeah.
[02:53:54.302 --> 02:53:56.343]  Had you ever heard it before listening to this show?
[02:53:56.343 --> 02:53:56.923]  I don't think so.
[02:54:00.052 --> 02:54:01.533]  It's a funny song, but it says it all.
[02:54:15.490 --> 02:54:17.210]  Well, you know, they make a big thing out of this, terrorism.
[02:54:46.382 --> 02:55:08.776]  You know, terrorism, it doesn't rear its ugly head unless you have government that has become a tyranny, a government that is, you know, almighty and, you see, a government that is a tyranny.
[02:55:11.538 --> 02:55:20.323]  You end up with people that get hammered and they get hurt, they get damaged, and they reach a point where they have nothing to lose.
[02:55:20.323 --> 02:55:32.130]  And the only weapon they have is whatever they can devise by their innovations and this type of thing.
[02:55:32.130 --> 02:55:37.954]  You don't have terrorism unless you have a terrorist government.
[02:55:39.159 --> 02:55:49.090]  A government that's involved in terrorism will end up with terrorists, you know, in a war against terrorists.
[02:55:49.090 --> 02:55:54.035]  But not just that, we also have the manufacturing terrorism as a pretext to crack down on the population.
[02:55:54.035 --> 02:56:01.663]  Sheriff Frank, specifically in your Sheriff's Department, if you find out they've hired criminals, are you going to get rid of them?
[02:56:02.509 --> 02:56:03.489]  I'm sure going to try.
[02:56:03.489 --> 02:56:16.112]  I know the Sheriff's Department is a civil service, so operated, but I don't want convicted, I don't want any criminals working for me because I want to maintain the highest of ethical standards.
[02:56:16.112 --> 02:56:25.474]  Can you believe we would have to discuss, and my question, Red, and Sheriff Frank, when the government starts hiring criminals, you know it's an evil government.
[02:56:26.005 --> 02:56:27.546]  Absolutely.
[02:56:27.546 --> 02:56:33.451]  It's incomprehensible to think that we hire such people, especially in the military and so forth.
[02:56:33.451 --> 02:56:35.493]  It's ridiculous.
[02:56:35.493 --> 02:56:37.895]  Well, that's a big red flag, isn't it, Red?
[02:56:37.895 --> 02:56:39.436]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:56:39.436 --> 02:56:47.143]  And of course, I'm old enough to where I've seen the progression over the years.
[02:56:47.143 --> 02:56:50.966]  And I remember what this country was.
[02:56:53.466 --> 02:57:00.732]  I compare what's happening today with what happened in the 1930s with the Depression.
[02:57:00.732 --> 02:57:03.694]  People helped each other.
[02:57:03.694 --> 02:57:05.696]  People looked out for each other.
[02:57:05.696 --> 02:57:12.261]  I can see this thing coming now, and people are going to keep their doors locked.
[02:57:12.261 --> 02:57:17.746]  They're going to be looking inward rather than outward.
[02:57:19.620 --> 02:57:20.601]  It's not.
[02:57:20.601 --> 02:57:28.107]  I mean, the picture is going to get real ugly because, you know, they talk about a 1930s depression.
[02:57:28.107 --> 02:57:30.889]  We aren't going to have a 1930s depression.
[02:57:30.889 --> 02:57:37.514]  It's going to be so much worse than the 1930s that there won't be any comparison, whatever.
[02:57:37.514 --> 02:57:41.477]  And on top of it, we're going to have militarized police running around squeezing people.
[02:57:41.477 --> 02:57:42.318]  Absolutely.
[02:57:42.318 --> 02:57:44.299]  And, well, terrorizing.
[02:57:44.299 --> 02:57:47.242]  And the result is going to be terrorism.
[02:57:47.972 --> 02:57:49.133]  Coming back on them.
[02:57:49.133 --> 02:57:52.514]  And you mean real, not even, I agree, not even manufactured.
[02:57:52.514 --> 02:57:53.535]  I wouldn't call it terrorism.
[02:57:53.535 --> 02:57:56.036]  You're going to have physical resistance.
[02:57:56.036 --> 02:57:57.677]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:57:57.677 --> 02:57:58.417]  Red, stay there.
[02:57:58.417 --> 02:58:05.201]  Do five more minutes with us, then at the 8 after, we're going to have Officer Jack McClam on with us.
[02:58:05.201 --> 02:58:06.822]  Sheriff Raymond Frank is our guest.
[02:58:06.822 --> 02:58:11.184]  Stay with us.
[02:58:11.184 --> 02:58:13.805]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:13.805 --> 02:58:16.026]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:19.827 --> 02:58:32.972]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:58:32.972 --> 02:58:36.794]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:58:37.094 --> 02:58:37.454]  We're good to go.
[02:59:03.846 --> 02:59:04.727]  We're good to go.
[02:59:34.781 --> 02:59:51.600]  Well, I just hopped over the old state line My headlights focused on a welcome sign When hiding in the bushes there waiting for me Was a big policeman with a capital P Shouting, look out stranger, you're heading for danger There's a welcome sign ahead
[02:59:52.959 --> 02:59:56.743]  Sheriff, the line I like is about the woman's getting mugged in the heart of town.
[03:00:16.443 --> 03:00:18.966]  Calls for help, but there's none around.
[03:00:18.966 --> 03:00:21.810]  They're out on the interstate setting the trap.
[03:00:21.810 --> 03:00:23.512]  Looking for a live one to skin and wrap.
[03:00:23.512 --> 03:00:24.913]  Here, that's coming up right now.
[03:00:24.913 --> 03:00:27.877]  Drag them off the interstate, sock it to them, J.P.
[03:00:27.877 --> 03:00:28.157]  Blues.
[03:00:35.406 --> 03:00:38.268]  You better pray to me and you better lick my boots!
[03:00:38.268 --> 03:00:40.910]  I'm an officer and you're a lowly civilian!
[03:00:40.910 --> 03:00:43.111]  There's a welcome sign ahead.
[03:01:00.350 --> 03:01:02.011]  That's pretty good, huh?
[03:01:02.011 --> 03:01:04.312]  Fuzzy old buzzards fillin' their craws.
[03:01:04.312 --> 03:01:05.452]  There's a welcome sign ahead.
[03:01:05.452 --> 03:01:07.673]  Sock it to them, JP Blues.
[03:01:26.423 --> 03:01:31.147]  You were saying during the break, the little break, that if everything breaks down, not in Travis County.
[03:01:31.147 --> 03:01:34.871]  I mean, we desperately need a real sheriff with sheriff's deputies.
[03:01:34.871 --> 03:01:40.796]  I mean, police that are guardians of the people and are going after crime, not raising revenue.
[03:01:40.796 --> 03:01:42.658]  But these bankers are running these scams.
[03:01:43.140 --> 03:01:50.408]  Yeah, I want the citizens of Travis County, property owners and so forth, to know that we're out there to help you.
[03:01:50.408 --> 03:01:55.234]  We're not out there to harm you, to find some way to give you a hard time in court.
[03:01:55.234 --> 03:01:58.998]  We're out there to help you, and you can call me if you want to.
[03:02:00.046 --> 03:02:05.510]  I have a telephone number in this phone book, and I'll be accessed by a phone at the Sheriff's office.
[03:02:05.510 --> 03:02:14.956]  Now you were saying that if you're elected again as Sheriff that within, you were in there a few decades ago, that within 24 hours you or one of your deputies will call them back.
[03:02:14.956 --> 03:02:16.297]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:02:16.297 --> 03:02:21.440]  It'll be shorter than 24 hours, but we're going to be your Sheriff.
[03:02:21.440 --> 03:02:24.702]  Well, I don't mean like on a call, I mean just to talk to you.
[03:02:24.702 --> 03:02:25.843]  That's right, absolutely.
[03:02:27.042 --> 03:02:30.584]  Well, in closing, Red Beckman, we appreciate you popping in with us today.
[03:02:30.584 --> 03:02:33.566]  Just Google Red Beckman on YouTube or Google Video.
[03:02:33.566 --> 03:02:36.629]  You can watch hundreds of presentations he's done.
[03:02:36.629 --> 03:02:41.192]  Fire out your address for somebody if they want to get that little book, Walls in Our Minds.
[03:02:41.192 --> 03:02:42.533]  Red Beckman.
[03:02:42.533 --> 03:02:53.300]  My address is Red Beckman at Post Office Box 61 Carrolls, C-A-R-R-O-L-L-S.
[03:02:53.300 --> 03:02:54.521]  Carrolls, Washington.
[03:02:55.496 --> 03:02:59.117]  9-8-6-0-9.
[03:02:59.117 --> 03:03:05.959]  We've sent out a lot of them, and we don't get any of them back, I'll assure you of that.
[03:03:05.959 --> 03:03:07.499]  It's five bucks, right?
[03:03:07.499 --> 03:03:08.139]  What?
[03:03:08.139 --> 03:03:10.160]  Five bucks.
[03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:11.420]  For that booklet.
[03:03:11.420 --> 03:03:14.501]  In the last minute we've got with you, we're going to come back with the Sheriff.
[03:03:14.501 --> 03:03:15.941]  I do see a massive awakening.
[03:03:15.941 --> 03:03:17.441]  I do see positive things happening.
[03:03:17.441 --> 03:03:18.882]  Do you agree with that statement?
[03:03:18.882 --> 03:03:23.383]  Oh, absolutely, because people are getting some real jolts.
[03:03:23.383 --> 03:03:24.763]  They're getting some real shock.
[03:03:25.912 --> 03:03:29.913]  And their 401ks and such are in trouble.
[03:03:29.913 --> 03:03:32.094]  And they ain't seen nothing yet, have they?
[03:03:32.094 --> 03:03:34.775]  They haven't seen nothing yet.
[03:03:34.775 --> 03:03:36.155]  It's going to get worse.
[03:03:36.155 --> 03:03:39.076]  You've written the definitive book on the Federal Reserve.
[03:03:39.076 --> 03:03:42.417]  You're the icon of that as well.
[03:03:42.417 --> 03:03:44.297]  No doubt in your mind this is engineered, correct?
[03:03:44.297 --> 03:03:45.698]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:03:45.698 --> 03:03:46.538]  This is planned.
[03:03:46.538 --> 03:03:48.779]  They want their new world order.
[03:03:48.779 --> 03:03:53.480]  And they're bringing it on fast right now.
[03:03:54.205 --> 03:04:01.589]  And the only thing that is slowing them down at all is the fact that we still have our guns in this country.
[03:04:01.589 --> 03:04:08.712]  And of course the people are waking up and there's a lot of people in Washington, D.C.
[03:04:08.712 --> 03:04:11.494]  that are very, very unhappy, very nervous.
[03:04:11.494 --> 03:04:13.575]  They're very nervous.
[03:04:13.575 --> 03:04:15.456]  They're not too sure of themselves right now.
[03:04:16.664 --> 03:04:19.387]  All right, Red Beckman, I look forward to speaking to you in the near future.
[03:04:19.387 --> 03:04:21.268]  God bless you and thanks for coming on with us.
[03:04:21.268 --> 03:04:22.189]  You bet.
[03:04:22.189 --> 03:04:30.257]  All right, more with Sheriff Raymond Franks and Jack McClam in three minutes.
[03:04:30.257 --> 03:04:31.038]  Attention.
[03:04:31.038 --> 03:04:34.080]  This is an extremely urgent, self-reliant news bulletin.

[03:04:41.167 --> 03:04:41.788]  Here is why.
[03:04:42.620 --> 03:04:53.089]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[03:04:53.089 --> 03:04:55.811]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[03:04:55.811 --> 03:04:57.933]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[03:04:57.933 --> 03:04:58.914]  this fall?
[03:04:58.914 --> 03:04:59.834]  Don't wait!
[03:04:59.834 --> 03:05:03.798]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.

[03:05:24.430 --> 03:05:24.650]  Act now!
[03:05:29.659 --> 03:05:36.402]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:05:36.402 --> 03:05:39.044]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:05:39.044 --> 03:05:40.585]  But who is the enemy?
[03:05:40.585 --> 03:05:41.385]  Bin Laden.
[03:05:41.385 --> 03:05:42.285]  This is his ammo.
[03:05:42.285 --> 03:05:43.726]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:05:43.726 --> 03:05:45.747]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:05:45.747 --> 03:05:52.911]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:05:52.911 --> 03:05:53.371]  Some U.S.
[03:05:53.371 --> 03:05:59.034]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:05:59.714 --> 03:06:03.235]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:03.235 --> 03:06:06.016]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:06:29.466 --> 03:06:40.907]  Ask yourself, is there a natural way to detoxify your body, lower blood pressure, remove heavy metals and sediment buildup in your body, alkalize and balance your pH level, and lower those cravings for junk food all at once?
[03:06:41.363 --> 03:06:41.843]  We're good to go!
[03:07:07.227 --> 03:07:09.147]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:07:37.034 --> 03:07:39.855]  We're here with Sheriff Raymond Frank, former Travis County Sheriff.
[03:07:39.855 --> 03:07:41.035]  This is Van Tazer's.
[03:07:41.035 --> 03:07:41.655]  He was re-elected.
[03:07:41.655 --> 03:07:44.976]  He was in a few decades ago.
[03:07:44.976 --> 03:07:47.717]  Highly decorated Air Force pilot.
[03:07:47.717 --> 03:07:49.637]  3,600 hours.
[03:07:49.637 --> 03:07:50.398]  On and on and on.
[03:07:50.398 --> 03:07:53.178]  Travis County Sheriff running for Sheriff again.
[03:07:53.178 --> 03:07:55.179]  Van Tazer's decriminalized marijuana.
[03:07:56.679 --> 03:07:59.420]  Uh, to stop writing all these tickets and actually respond to crime.
[03:07:59.420 --> 03:08:06.042]  I wanted to get Jack McClam on for, uh, much of the rest of the hour with us to ride shotgun with us to talk about the real role of the sheriff.
[03:08:06.042 --> 03:08:09.803]  All this talk about martial law, but we were talking about the 360 bridge for some reason.
[03:08:09.803 --> 03:08:14.945]  You were talking about Honeysuckle Rose, uh, and that, uh, movie with Willie Nelson.
[03:08:14.945 --> 03:08:16.605]  And I said, oh, you know Willie.
[03:08:16.605 --> 03:08:18.106]  And then you were telling me that, uh, uh,
[03:08:19.066 --> 03:08:24.371]  One of his family members was one of your deputies that you do know, Willie, and that you were in a movie with him.
[03:08:24.371 --> 03:08:26.753]  So you've been around, Sheriff Frank.
[03:08:26.753 --> 03:08:27.834]  Tell us about that.
[03:08:27.834 --> 03:08:30.997]  Yeah, well, I was a friend of Willie Nelson when it wasn't cool to be a friend.
[03:08:30.997 --> 03:08:34.720]  In fact, it was kind of derogatory.
[03:08:34.720 --> 03:08:36.362]  What, back with his IRS trouble and all that?
[03:08:36.362 --> 03:08:37.142]  Way back.
[03:08:37.142 --> 03:08:38.404]  Well, even before that.
[03:08:38.404 --> 03:08:40.125]  I'm talking about the 70s, early 70s.
[03:08:40.125 --> 03:08:41.126]  How was that derogatory?
[03:08:41.246 --> 03:08:45.608]  Yeah, well, because, you know, he was considered sort of an outlaw or something.
[03:08:45.608 --> 03:08:46.568]  Yeah, radical!
[03:08:46.568 --> 03:09:04.055]  Radical and everything, but his nephew was my deputy, and he was the finest deputy I ever had, and he died accidentally in a car accident, and Randy Fletcher was his name, and his mother plays piano, Bobby, plays piano for Willie, and she's a friend of mine.
[03:09:04.055 --> 03:09:06.836]  And by the way, Willie has played
[03:09:07.576 --> 03:09:12.420]  Three times, I think, before the fundraisers for me when I ran for Sheriff.
[03:09:12.420 --> 03:09:14.802]  And he's for me, I can tell you that.
[03:09:14.802 --> 03:09:15.602]  We're good friends.
[03:09:15.602 --> 03:09:16.623]  Well, he's just super.
[03:09:16.623 --> 03:09:17.724]  I was just talking to him the other day.
[03:09:17.724 --> 03:09:25.149]  I'm going to be speaking at an event with Jesse Ventura coming up, not this Sunday, but next Sunday, at the last event at the Backyard before they move it to a bigger venue.
[03:09:25.149 --> 03:09:27.091]  But the amazing thing about him is,
[03:09:27.671 --> 03:09:35.874]  You know, he's putting out similar water from air things as we are, but he literally just put his name on it because he wants to do something real environmental.
[03:09:35.874 --> 03:09:38.555]  So we have to have all this, you know, bottled water.
[03:09:38.555 --> 03:09:44.617]  And I mean, he's literally, it was in the States, but he's literally doing that with really no profit for himself just to get that idea out.
[03:09:44.617 --> 03:09:46.518]  Just like he did biodiesel.
[03:09:46.518 --> 03:09:49.019]  Just like he's had so many other, I mean, he really is a good guy.
[03:09:49.019 --> 03:09:51.159]  I mean, I mean, I mean, he really does care.
[03:09:51.159 --> 03:09:52.880]  And that's neat that you've known him so long.
[03:09:53.635 --> 03:10:01.883]  Yeah, well, you know, one time somebody walked in his trailer at a concert and he said, well, what is that stuff I smell?
[03:10:01.883 --> 03:10:06.267]  And Willie said, you don't smell anything.
[03:10:06.267 --> 03:10:13.414]  So, you know, I guess the guy was suggesting that Willie had used some marijuana or something, but I don't smell it and you don't either.
[03:10:13.414 --> 03:10:16.317]  He's quite a guy.
[03:10:16.317 --> 03:10:18.079]  So what did you do in that movie with Willie?
[03:10:18.499 --> 03:10:35.428]  Well, we were in the, Randy, the kid that was killed, we were up at Briarcliff in this thing and they had just driven up from Mexico in the bus and Randy Fletcher said, I hope neither of you were driving at each point of the finger at each other.
[03:10:35.428 --> 03:10:40.832]  But I was in that scene and got to meet Willie again and also Slim Pickens and
[03:10:42.414 --> 03:10:44.078]  That was a great experience.
[03:10:44.078 --> 03:10:48.087]  We also filmed a scene down by the bridge there on 360.
[03:10:51.988 --> 03:10:54.269]  That was interesting too.
[03:10:54.269 --> 03:11:00.633]  I'm proud to be a friend of Willie Nelson and I appreciate all the causes that he's involved in and so forth.
[03:11:00.633 --> 03:11:02.654]  It's just tremendous.
[03:11:02.654 --> 03:11:03.434]  He's a neat guy.
[03:11:03.434 --> 03:11:06.776]  Okay, he's been back in Austin the last few weeks.
[03:11:06.776 --> 03:11:08.337]  We just went back on tour today.
[03:11:08.337 --> 03:11:11.438]  Let's go to Jack McClam, Officer Jack McClam.
[03:11:11.438 --> 03:11:14.019]  I wanted to have you on Jack because Raymond Frank is a great guy.
[03:11:14.019 --> 03:11:16.461]  He's anti-New World Order and so much has happened.
[03:11:16.461 --> 03:11:18.842]  I also want to talk about all the martial law developments we've been seeing.
[03:11:19.242 --> 03:11:23.663]  Yeah, I mean, everything we've talked about is now coming true, but it's such old hat to us.
[03:11:23.663 --> 03:11:30.585]  A lot of us, I think myself included, aren't even responding as vehemently and as seriously as we should because it's new to the public and they're now freaking out.
[03:11:30.585 --> 03:11:35.627]  It's all over the news as the news introduces it to people and Glenn Beck introduces it to the public.
[03:11:35.627 --> 03:11:43.449]  But, you know, for a lot of us that have been saying, you know, seeing it being engineered for so long, you know, we're kind of like, in a way, sitting back.
[03:11:43.449 --> 03:11:47.250]  I think that's a dangerous psychological development, but it's one we have to be honest about.
[03:11:47.250 --> 03:11:48.571]  Jack McClam, good to have you here with us.
[03:11:49.031 --> 03:11:55.174]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[03:11:55.174 --> 03:12:00.337]  Very good to be with you today, and good to be on with Sheriff Franks.
[03:12:00.337 --> 03:12:03.439]  Thank you, Sheriff Franks, for your service to the public.
[03:12:03.439 --> 03:12:08.282]  Well, I have a lot of respect for you, Jack, and listen to your program all the time on radio.
[03:12:09.332 --> 03:12:12.654]  That's right, it's on here locally on 90.1.
[03:12:12.654 --> 03:12:15.536]  Oh yeah, Sheriff Frank is a total anti-New World Order.
[03:12:15.536 --> 03:12:25.483]  I mean, you've always been pro-liberty, but Sheriff Frank, Raymond Frank, when did you, and we'll go back to Jack in a second, but that's a good question, when did you first wake up to the New World Order?
[03:12:25.483 --> 03:12:29.726]  Probably in 1972, when a friend of mine in the Air Force,
[03:12:32.858 --> 03:12:33.158]  That's right.
[03:12:33.158 --> 03:12:34.460]  You were saying you knew all this was coming.
[03:12:34.460 --> 03:12:35.601]  You bought a bunch of silver in the 70s.
[03:12:52.981 --> 03:12:57.443]  Sure did, for real, like a buck and a half an ounce.
[03:12:57.443 --> 03:13:01.605]  And now it's up to 20 and it's probably going to go to 100 in the next couple years.
[03:13:01.605 --> 03:13:03.306]  I don't think there's any doubt about it.
[03:13:03.306 --> 03:13:05.207]  Absolutely.
[03:13:05.207 --> 03:13:22.576]  Jack McClam, I want to get into the bigger picture of martial law and the new rule of order, but how important is it to have the people take their counties back with the sheriffs and put the sheriff back in their dominant role as the most highly powerful elected representative instead of the states and the counties and the cities trying to get rid of sheriffs?
[03:13:22.876 --> 03:13:25.077]  Why is the establishment afraid of sheriffs?
[03:13:25.077 --> 03:13:33.000]  Yes, it's so important, brother, because the sheriff is truly the chief executive officer in the county.
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:37.062]  And, sadly, many of the sheriffs don't know that.
[03:13:37.062 --> 03:13:45.345]  And so, in many of the eastern states today, they've been relegated to just process servers.
[03:13:45.345 --> 03:13:46.926]  Not law enforcement anymore.
[03:13:46.926 --> 03:13:50.147]  The state police, the local police, and the federal
[03:13:50.942 --> 03:13:51.382]  That's right.
[03:14:08.932 --> 03:14:23.981]  Yeah, they've never seen law enforcement they don't love, but the one area of peace officers known as law enforcement where it's for the people, has the real power, they're getting rid of that because they know.
[03:14:31.880 --> 03:14:39.724]  Here, a few years back, said this, the Office of Sheriff is one of the oldest offices known to the common law jurisprudence.
[03:14:39.724 --> 03:14:53.712]  A clear statement of the significance of the Office of Sheriff within the county, both historically and under present statutes, is found in Anderson on Sheriff's Corners and Constables, page 6.
[03:14:53.712 --> 03:15:00.196]  And it says in there, in the exercise of executive and administrative functions in conserving the public peace,
[03:15:01.110 --> 03:15:12.192]  In vindicating the law and in preserving the rights of the government, he, the sheriff, represents the sovereignty of the state, and he has no superior in the county.
[03:15:12.856 --> 03:15:33.025]  And I wish, we're working hard here at Aid and Abet Police Military Newsletter to try to get our sheriff's video out and our sheriff's newsletter out to all the sheriffs around the nation so that they'll realize that they have great jurisdiction and great power and they do not have to listen to the federal authorities that come into their county.
[03:15:33.385 --> 03:15:46.561]  Well, Jack, as a sheriff in the 70s, Raymond Frank on the front lines, when they were just starting to try to get rid of sheriffs, he went to the legislature when they were about to basically disband them, or make them appointed, and Sheriff Frank helped stop that.
[03:15:46.561 --> 03:15:49.645]  So he's kind of an unsung great granddaddy in this fight.
[03:15:49.645 --> 03:15:51.427]  Tell us about testifying before the legislature.
[03:15:52.165 --> 03:15:54.928]  Well, yeah.
[03:15:54.928 --> 03:16:04.018]  Somehow, our district attorney and a pretty well-known judge was on a committee to rewrite the Constitution.
[03:16:04.018 --> 03:16:08.603]  And, of course, my office is a constitutional office, which I'm very proud of.
[03:16:08.603 --> 03:16:10.065]  And one of the things they did was
[03:16:11.952 --> 03:16:21.356]  Do away with the sheriff and allow the legislature to provide the okay for counties to have a sheriff if they needed one.
[03:16:21.356 --> 03:16:30.380]  Well, we fought that and it was defeated and I'm going to be on the alert for that, you know, because it'll probably come up again sometime.
[03:16:30.380 --> 03:16:32.001]  Oh yes, it sure will, brother.
[03:16:32.001 --> 03:16:34.322]  Thank you so much for that, Sheriff Frank.
[03:16:34.322 --> 03:16:35.422]  Thank you so much.
[03:16:35.422 --> 03:16:36.783]  You're welcome.
[03:16:36.783 --> 03:16:40.625]  I remember in my Phoenix Police Department,
[03:16:41.796 --> 03:16:51.641]  I was made, within the first three years that I was on the force, the most highly decorated officer in the police department.
[03:16:51.641 --> 03:16:53.822]  And then I developed a bad side.
[03:16:54.571 --> 03:17:06.864]  According to the government anyway, I never accepted any immoral or unconstitutional orders from superiors, nor in any way violated my oath to defend the Constitution and the people's rights.
[03:17:06.864 --> 03:17:12.230]  And I'm now the most fired officer in the history of Phoenix, Arizona.
[03:17:12.230 --> 03:17:14.432]  Not only the most decorated, but the most fired.
[03:17:14.432 --> 03:17:16.934]  So, I know how hard it is.
[03:17:18.024 --> 03:17:31.785]  Today for law enforcement, peace officers, and sheriffs to stand up and do what's right because the New World Order gang of thieves that control the federal government and many of the state governments also
[03:17:32.836 --> 03:17:33.517]  I don't think so.
[03:17:48.177 --> 03:18:12.910]  This is absolutely important that people support Raymond Frank's, RaymondFrank.com, and contribute to your campaign now, or help you as volunteers, because we've got to get the word out that this is the sheriff we need, not the child-kidnapping, and we had that previously, you know, New World Order, New Age scum, that, I mean, we've had some bad sheriffs.
[03:18:13.730 --> 03:18:18.557]  And, you know, I mean, CPS and kids for no reason, you name it.
[03:18:19.517 --> 03:18:28.862]  Well, I'll tell you, the people that I inherit in the Sheriff Department will be fully indoctrinated because what they do is just like me doing it.
[03:18:28.862 --> 03:18:45.750]  When I deputize them, that's just like me doing something, and they're going to be oriented towards serving the people and protecting the people and not just give tickets on Highway 35 like I saw one do about four weeks ago on my way to Pflugerville.
[03:18:45.750 --> 03:18:47.791]  Hey, what do you think of the new Austin Police Chief?
[03:18:48.886 --> 03:18:49.747]  I like him.
[03:18:49.747 --> 03:18:51.148]  I like him.
[03:18:51.148 --> 03:18:54.310]  One reason I like him is because he's for transparency.
[03:18:54.310 --> 03:18:55.891]  And that's what I'm for.
[03:18:55.891 --> 03:18:56.772]  I know this.
[03:18:56.772 --> 03:18:57.813]  It turned out he's a fan.
[03:18:57.813 --> 03:19:00.895]  And I know folks that know him separately from me where he is a fan.
[03:19:00.895 --> 03:19:05.518]  Like at dinner parties talking about me or at other radio stations doing Alex Jones imitations.
[03:19:05.518 --> 03:19:09.501]  I thought he was either really slick or a good guy when he was in studio.
[03:19:09.501 --> 03:19:10.862]  You know, he pretty much sought us out.
[03:19:10.862 --> 03:19:11.662]  Did you know that?
[03:19:11.662 --> 03:19:13.183]  I didn't know that.
[03:19:13.183 --> 03:19:14.685]  Jack, what does that sound like to you?
[03:19:14.685 --> 03:19:16.266]  Do you think I can trust the Austin Police Chief?
[03:19:17.316 --> 03:19:19.818]  Well, I certainly hope you can.
[03:19:19.818 --> 03:19:23.141]  Sounds like that he's got some good principles there.
[03:19:23.141 --> 03:19:27.085]  We'll just have to wait and see, but I would befriend him for sure.
[03:19:27.085 --> 03:19:27.725]  Stay there, stay there.
[03:19:27.725 --> 03:19:28.306]  We're coming right back.
[03:19:29.941 --> 03:19:31.941]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:19:31.941 --> 03:19:38.903]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[03:19:38.903 --> 03:19:47.285]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:19:47.285 --> 03:19:53.026]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:19:53.206 --> 03:19:55.048]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:19:55.048 --> 03:19:57.331]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:19:57.331 --> 03:20:01.755]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:20:01.755 --> 03:20:03.978]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:20:03.978 --> 03:20:10.705]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardio better.
[03:20:10.905 --> 03:20:11.645]  I don't know.
[03:20:30.333 --> 03:20:30.773]  We're good to go.
[03:20:53.643 --> 03:20:54.504]  We're good to go.
[03:21:09.381 --> 03:21:15.304]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report of Fed hopes you'll never see.
[03:21:15.304 --> 03:21:18.206]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:21:18.206 --> 03:21:24.390]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[03:21:24.390 --> 03:21:25.430]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[03:21:30.049 --> 03:21:30.910]  Attention please.
[03:21:30.910 --> 03:21:33.372]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:21:33.372 --> 03:21:35.955]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:21:35.955 --> 03:21:37.176]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:21:37.176 --> 03:21:38.877]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:21:38.877 --> 03:21:41.760]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:21:41.760 --> 03:21:45.664]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFO?
[03:21:55.056 --> 03:21:59.938]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:22:07.786 --> 03:22:11.249]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:22:11.249 --> 03:22:13.551]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:22:28.988 --> 03:22:33.869]  As a parent, your biggest fear is getting a phone call that your child has been attacked or worse.
[03:22:33.869 --> 03:22:39.370]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep these safety tips in mind.
[03:22:39.370 --> 03:22:41.631]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings.

[03:24:01.008 --> 03:24:12.538]  We'll have Jack McClam and Sheriff Frank with us for about another 15 minutes, and I'm going to cover all the final financial news of the day with everybody.
[03:24:12.538 --> 03:24:20.765]  Stock market went down about 400 points, and it went back up 217 points past its low of the day, or past its low
[03:24:22.190 --> 03:24:23.270]  It's closed yesterday.
[03:24:23.270 --> 03:24:27.851]  There's a lot of market manipulation going on there.
[03:24:27.851 --> 03:24:31.672]  The big news blitz coming up.
[03:24:31.672 --> 03:24:38.574]  Jack McClam, we're seeing Congress come out and say they were threatened with martial law, they didn't pass the Banker Takeover Bill.
[03:24:38.574 --> 03:24:42.735]  We're seeing so much of the new order system unfold right in front of us.
[03:24:42.735 --> 03:24:48.076]  What do you see happening on the economy front and the whole police state front in the short and long term?
[03:24:48.973 --> 03:24:52.635]  Well, they're really pushing.
[03:24:52.635 --> 03:25:02.540]  Cheney and Bush want to stay in as dictators of America, so they'd like to have us under martial law before the election so they can cancel the election.
[03:25:02.540 --> 03:25:13.645]  But see, they're the puppets of the Council on Foreign Relations, so they have to wait for a decision from the Council on Foreign Relations if they're going to have abomination or traitor McCain.
[03:25:14.566 --> 03:25:24.148]  As our president, or is the CFR going to allow them to put us under martial law and stay in as dictators themselves before the election?
[03:25:24.148 --> 03:25:42.931]  So, it's all up to the Council on Foreign Relations, really, as to who our next dictator will be, because Abomination appointed the president of the Council on Foreign Relations as his campaign chief, and then he appointed a top communist in the country
[03:25:43.635 --> 03:25:50.700]  There's a big new Brzezinski as his foreign policy manager, and he is a hardcore communist.
[03:25:50.700 --> 03:26:07.693]  You know, in Houston, I guess you probably heard, Alex, that in Houston, when you walk in the front door of his presidential campaign headquarters, he had a picture of the number one guerrilla warfare terrorist
[03:26:10.162 --> 03:26:11.643]  I can't even think of his name now.
[03:26:11.643 --> 03:26:12.683]  Che Guevara?
[03:26:12.683 --> 03:26:14.084]  Che Guevara.
[03:26:14.084 --> 03:26:20.387]  A flag of Che Guevara right behind his secretary, his greeter that greets you when you come in.
[03:26:20.387 --> 03:26:23.028]  Now they've taken it down, but we have a picture of it.
[03:26:23.892 --> 03:26:24.293]  Of course.
[03:26:43.300 --> 03:26:52.402]  Trader McCain, I'm a Vietnam veteran and have actually 30 years ago talked to POWs that told us what a traitor John McCain was.
[03:26:52.402 --> 03:26:53.022]  We've interviewed him.
[03:26:53.022 --> 03:27:01.284]  He's not a war hero at all, but he is a member of the last 15 years of the Council on Foreign Relations, so there'll be no changes.
[03:27:01.284 --> 03:27:08.345]  Whatever the Council on Foreign Relations says, and they want the New World Order, Obama Nation and Trader McCain and
[03:27:09.205 --> 03:27:12.006]  Katie and Bush are going to follow their orders.
[03:27:12.006 --> 03:27:20.871]  Sheriff Frank, I'll ask you the same question that I brought up to Police Chief Acevedo when he was in studio with us a couple months ago.
[03:27:20.871 --> 03:27:37.479]  If the Feds come in and announce that they want you to go out and arrest a couple thousand quote political dissidents, you know, without warrants, without proof, without indictments, or without, you know, any charges, what are you going to tell the Feds if they try to come in here and federalize things under Presidential Decision Directive 51 of your sheriff?
[03:27:37.898 --> 03:27:47.425]  Well, they're going to be told that they're going to have to face my deputy sheriffs who are armed with rifles and ready to deny what they want to do.
[03:27:47.425 --> 03:27:48.546]  I'm not going to allow that.
[03:27:48.546 --> 03:27:51.848]  Sheriff Frank, let me ask you something.
[03:27:51.848 --> 03:28:04.998]  When I was a cop in Phoenix, I was one that helped set up the local, in South Phoenix, the local
[03:28:06.369 --> 03:28:10.491]  Anti-crime units in the counties.
[03:28:10.491 --> 03:28:32.362]  I set up a hundred of these block watches in the counties in South Phoenix, which was the war zone of Phoenix, and I helped the sheriff set up a 3,000-man posse of county residents that became posse members, over 3,000 of them, and I hope that, Sheriff Frank, that you will go to your
[03:28:33.521 --> 03:28:42.452]  Yeah, what about the power of the posse?
[03:28:42.452 --> 03:28:47.439]  You know, the feds want to turn everybody into tattletales and federal posses, which are illegal and dangerous.
[03:28:47.439 --> 03:28:50.283]  But what about the county posse where the people control it?
[03:28:50.902 --> 03:29:01.508]  Well, Texas state law provides a provision where the sheriff can deputize our citizens as deputies, and I intend to do that.
[03:29:01.508 --> 03:29:02.989]  Good deal, praise God.
[03:29:02.989 --> 03:29:09.953]  And I intend to have a roster of all those people that I know will perform as they should perform.
[03:29:09.953 --> 03:29:11.274]  See folks, you want a solution.
[03:29:11.274 --> 03:29:18.258]  Get our sheriffs back, get patriots in the positions, activate the posse as a defense against crime and the federal terrorist.
[03:29:18.258 --> 03:29:18.838]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:19.932 --> 03:29:23.853]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:23.853 --> 03:29:29.874]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:29.874 --> 03:29:33.835]  Drinking a chlorophyll-rich beverage has been found to benefit your entire body.

[03:30:29.744 --> 03:30:36.489]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:30:36.489 --> 03:30:39.132]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:30:39.132 --> 03:30:40.673]  But who is the enemy?
[03:30:40.673 --> 03:30:41.474]  Bin Laden.
[03:30:41.474 --> 03:30:42.314]  This is his M.O.
[03:30:42.314 --> 03:30:43.855]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:30:43.855 --> 03:30:45.837]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:30:45.837 --> 03:30:53.003]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:30:53.003 --> 03:30:53.483]  Some U.S.
[03:30:53.483 --> 03:30:59.108]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:30:59.808 --> 03:31:03.309]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:31:03.309 --> 03:31:06.110]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:31:31.334 --> 03:31:36.996]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming but it will be available sometime in the future?

[03:32:14.893 --> 03:32:16.854]  That's L A S E M E D I N C dot com today.
[03:32:33.601 --> 03:32:40.908]  Take a look out your window there, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
[03:32:40.908 --> 03:32:45.472]  Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
[03:32:45.472 --> 03:32:50.656]  The man is playing Dixie, the man's got his hand outstretched.
[03:32:50.656 --> 03:32:55.400]  Could be the viola, could be the local priest.
[03:33:08.363 --> 03:33:16.590]  Alright, our guest will be with us for another 10 minutes, then we'll do a big news blitz, then into the end of the show for everybody.
[03:33:16.590 --> 03:33:24.896]  Sheriff Frank, we were talking during the break, getting more into how you would expand the posse, how you would form the constitutional posse.
[03:33:24.896 --> 03:33:34.444]  I mean, imagine the idea of the government against the people, spying on us, versus sheriffs who are elected, saying no to the feds, no to tyranny, and not squeezing the public.
[03:33:34.904 --> 03:33:37.926]  And that's why they've been moving to block the sheriffs, get rid of the sheriffs.
[03:33:37.926 --> 03:33:39.027]  And we still have avenues.
[03:33:39.027 --> 03:33:41.108]  The juries, the grand juries, the sheriffs.
[03:33:41.108 --> 03:33:45.230]  There's a lot of other ways that we get to maintain the people's power.
[03:33:45.230 --> 03:33:52.655]  Previously, before the 17th Amendment, federal senators were appointed by the legislatures of the states who voted for the U.S.
[03:33:52.655 --> 03:33:54.576]  Senator and would send them to Washington.
[03:33:54.576 --> 03:33:56.117]  Again, state power.
[03:33:56.117 --> 03:33:58.118]  Everything is moving away from people power.
[03:33:58.718 --> 03:34:00.638]  In decentralization's hands.
[03:34:00.638 --> 03:34:09.300]  Sheriff Franks, tell us more about your posse, if you're a re-elected sheriff, and sheriff previously a few decades ago, here in Travis County.
[03:34:09.300 --> 03:34:25.724]  Well, what I envision, I could draw upon one or two hundred citizens, probably more in precinct three, because it's more populated than precinct four, and in other words, I won't pick them all from one precinct, and indoctrinate them, train them,
[03:34:26.872 --> 03:34:30.214]  And for fires or wrecks or crime or any of it?
[03:34:48.883 --> 03:34:50.904]  A posse that puts on the rodeo.
[03:34:50.904 --> 03:34:52.545]  I think it's still put on the rodeo.
[03:34:52.545 --> 03:34:54.626]  I'm talking about... A real posse?
[03:34:54.626 --> 03:34:57.627]  Yeah, a real posse that's deputizing.
[03:34:57.627 --> 03:35:02.669]  Well, let's say the feds, you know, are coming through, taking over the city governments as they've been trying to do.
[03:35:02.669 --> 03:35:06.911]  Your sheriff, they come in and say, we're here to arrest thousands of citizens.
[03:35:06.911 --> 03:35:09.512]  Work brigades, the economy's collapsed.
[03:35:11.073 --> 03:35:19.758]  You're telling me that you would, and that's how a whole rebellion nationwide that could start that had government, quote, you know, credentials that could defeat the illegitimate feds.
[03:35:19.758 --> 03:35:28.604]  Imagine having thousands of sheriffs across the country saying no, the new order would be over overnight by taking over the local governments.
[03:35:28.604 --> 03:35:30.745]  Comment on that, and I want to comment from Jack McClam on it.
[03:35:30.945 --> 03:35:37.327]  Well, they're going to have to deal with my full-time deputy sheriff, who's going to be well-trained on what to do and when to do it.
[03:35:37.327 --> 03:35:49.311]  And that's number one, plus my other one or two hundred people that I'm going to deputize and have ready to respond to such a tyrannical act on the part of our federal government.
[03:35:49.311 --> 03:35:51.612]  Do you think stuff like that's a possibility of happening?
[03:35:51.612 --> 03:35:52.252]  I sure do.
[03:35:52.252 --> 03:35:55.694]  I really do.
[03:35:55.694 --> 03:35:59.355]  This is one reason why I want to get this Homeland Security guy out of my jail, because
[03:36:00.215 --> 03:36:04.596]  Every foot they can get in, it gives them that much access.
[03:36:04.596 --> 03:36:07.157]  And it worries me.
[03:36:07.157 --> 03:36:07.997]  Absolutely.
[03:36:07.997 --> 03:36:09.777]  Jack McClam comments on what you just heard.
[03:36:09.777 --> 03:36:23.861]  I think that this is a time when they're bringing in the military now into the country to overthrow the county sheriff and put us under martial law.
[03:36:24.699 --> 03:36:25.200]  That's right.
[03:36:42.831 --> 03:36:46.772]  And she's a better sniper than I am with her .308 rifle.
[03:36:46.772 --> 03:36:49.813]  And so there's a lot of things that the women can do.
[03:36:49.813 --> 03:36:52.614]  Some women can do better than the men.
[03:36:52.614 --> 03:36:52.954]  Absolutely.
[03:36:52.954 --> 03:36:54.174]  Let's go back to martial law.
[03:36:54.174 --> 03:36:55.795]  Don't overlook the women either.
[03:36:55.795 --> 03:37:00.656]  For those that don't know, the Army Times, the News, Glenn Beck, they're all announcing the troops are here.
[03:37:00.656 --> 03:37:04.478]  Glenn Beck says they may need to be used to arrest 9-11 truthers.
[03:37:04.478 --> 03:37:05.618]  Jack, your comments on that?
[03:37:06.963 --> 03:37:15.030]  Well, I think all this falls in the category of the Sheriff's powers, duties, and responsibilities in jurisdiction.
[03:37:15.030 --> 03:37:31.163]  And so, if these people do not have due process, and they are truly constitutionalists and within the First Amendment to protest or speak out, and the feds are trying to arrest them, the Sheriff is supposed to stop that.
[03:37:32.092 --> 03:37:45.807]  Uh, because he is the protector of the people and he is the person that, uh, like when I was in the Vietnam War, I took the oath and I took it again as a Phoenix police detective or, uh, investigator.
[03:37:47.025 --> 03:37:49.626]  And it was to defend the Constitution.
[03:37:49.626 --> 03:37:58.987]  By the way, Jack, as you know, there have been thousands of cases of the Pinkerton security in the last 150 years and through the Depression and other private security firms.
[03:37:58.987 --> 03:38:06.969]  People see that in Westerns where the bad railroad enforcers come and kill people in the town and take mines and property and water rights.
[03:38:06.969 --> 03:38:11.630]  There were thousands of cases where sheriffs would call up a posse and run their butt out of town.
[03:38:12.410 --> 03:38:18.174]  And so people can't imagine, and I mean the last 50 years folks, people can't imagine a sheriff doing that.
[03:38:18.174 --> 03:38:21.996]  No, I mean that's what this country was built on.
[03:38:21.996 --> 03:38:23.477]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:38:23.477 --> 03:38:27.980]  And now we're so domesticated that it's an alien thought.
[03:38:27.980 --> 03:38:38.386]  Well, we've been brainwashed into believing that the feds can come in and do anything they want, and many of the sheriffs have been brainwashed that way too.
[03:38:39.335 --> 03:38:50.785]  But I can tell you of some sheriffs that one went to his grave hating himself because he was the sheriff that allowed Waco to happen in his county.
[03:38:50.785 --> 03:38:52.667]  That's right, he spoke out against that.
[03:38:52.667 --> 03:38:55.829]  He could have gone in and arrested David Koresh.
[03:38:55.829 --> 03:38:56.870]  Oh, you knew the McClellan County?
[03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:58.472]  He was elected in 1972, the same year that I was.
[03:39:03.576 --> 03:39:05.897]  Yeah, and he hated himself.
[03:39:05.897 --> 03:39:13.020]  He hated himself for letting the feds come in and start that fire and burn up the children and moms and dads.
[03:39:13.020 --> 03:39:25.045]  And then he knew of the machine gun nest out back because the FLIR radar picked him up machine gunning the people that ran out to the building back there to try to get away from the fire.
[03:39:26.119 --> 03:39:29.382]  And he truly went to his grave hating himself.
[03:39:29.382 --> 03:39:31.844]  No, he said that on TV.
[03:39:31.844 --> 03:39:33.045]  He was really upset about that.
[03:39:33.045 --> 03:39:35.687]  He said they could pick Koresh up any time in town.
[03:39:35.687 --> 03:39:41.072]  But they wanted to go in there and burn out a quote cult to sell the public on accepting it.
[03:39:41.072 --> 03:39:44.715]  Well, Jack McClam, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[03:39:44.715 --> 03:39:47.458]  Your program is on Genesis Communications at 7 o'clock Central.
[03:39:48.138 --> 03:39:49.119]  Yes it is.
[03:39:49.119 --> 03:40:01.565]  Once again I just want to say thank you Alex for having Sheriff Franks on because he's my hero.
[03:40:01.565 --> 03:40:08.569]  These guys are my hero and God bless you Sheriff and I hope that you're re-elected and the people have a
[03:40:09.298 --> 03:40:10.299]  Well, thank you, Jack.
[03:40:10.299 --> 03:40:12.019]  I appreciate that very much.
[03:40:25.365 --> 03:40:26.585]  Yeah, I know he is.
[03:40:26.585 --> 03:40:31.406]  And it's just great to have him joining us on the show today.
[03:40:31.406 --> 03:40:41.208]  An interesting now hour and about 30 minute discussion on the role of the sheriff, the role of the counties, the true role of state government, and a lot of what's happened there.
[03:40:41.208 --> 03:40:45.109]  I want to give you the website, it's RaymondFrank.com.
[03:40:45.109 --> 03:40:52.550]  And even if you live outside Travis County, I know a small part of our huge audience is in the county here, birthplace of Texas.
[03:40:53.530 --> 03:40:53.810]  I think so.
[03:41:12.128 --> 03:41:14.829]  Are there other ways for them to volunteer or get involved?
[03:41:14.829 --> 03:41:15.729]  I see a phone number here.
[03:41:15.729 --> 03:41:17.189]  Do you want me to give that number out?
[03:41:17.189 --> 03:41:19.550]  Yes, that's my home telephone number.
[03:41:19.550 --> 03:41:22.791]  Alright, it's 512, but in Austin you don't need the 512 as you know.
[03:41:22.791 --> 03:41:22.851]  327-2034.
[03:41:22.851 --> 03:41:22.871]  327-2034.
[03:41:29.873 --> 03:41:34.918]  And RaymondFrank.com, 327-2034.
[03:41:34.918 --> 03:41:40.864]  Give him a call if you want to volunteer or help the former Travis County Sheriff out.
[03:41:40.864 --> 03:41:42.906]  Again, he was Special Agent Lieutenant Colonel with the U.S.
[03:41:42.906 --> 03:41:45.769]  Air Force Office of Special Investigation for 15 years.
[03:41:45.769 --> 03:41:49.572]  Assignments in Berlin, Paris, London, and all over the world.
[03:41:49.572 --> 03:41:51.794]  Iceland, Germany, South Central Texas.
[03:41:52.515 --> 03:41:55.798]  And then he was elected sheriff in Travis County for eight years and friends with Willie Nelson.
[03:41:55.798 --> 03:41:57.000]  I didn't even know that.
[03:41:57.000 --> 03:41:57.660]  And a listener.
[03:41:57.660 --> 03:42:00.423]  How long have you been listening to this show, Sheriff?
[03:42:00.423 --> 03:42:01.564]  For a long, long time.
[03:42:02.438 --> 03:42:03.299]  When did you first pick it up?
[03:42:03.299 --> 03:42:04.940]  Back in the mid-90s?
[03:42:04.940 --> 03:42:06.562]  Yeah, it was, yeah.
[03:42:06.562 --> 03:42:10.766]  When you would go through a lot of different fanatics and so forth, yeah.
[03:42:10.766 --> 03:42:12.107]  On the TV show, right?
[03:42:12.107 --> 03:42:17.232]  Yeah, it's been a long time, and I've really enjoyed it, and I still listen.
[03:42:17.232 --> 03:42:22.037]  I still blow up and yell and scream a little, but I kind of had the edges off me, you know?
[03:42:22.037 --> 03:42:25.920]  Working so much, you kind of just get a little bit more relaxed, usually, unless you're talking to an enemy.
[03:42:26.681 --> 03:42:29.042]  Then I still get fired up talking to them.
[03:42:29.042 --> 03:42:36.404]  You have the Air Force's highest aeronautical rating of command pilot with 3,600 hours, and is this one of the planes you flew?
[03:42:36.404 --> 03:42:42.605]  Yeah, I flew, that was my first combat-ready airplane, the P-61 Black Widow, the Night Fighter.
[03:42:42.605 --> 03:42:48.367]  We had three of us crew members, a pilot, radar observer, and a gunner.
[03:42:48.367 --> 03:42:49.487]  It was a beautiful airplane.
[03:42:50.666 --> 03:42:53.047]  And then you flew some other aircraft, didn't you?
[03:42:53.047 --> 03:42:58.489]  Oh yeah, like most Air Force pilots, we've flown a lot of different aircraft.
[03:42:58.489 --> 03:42:59.790]  Here, I'll put this up on screen.
[03:42:59.790 --> 03:43:00.730]  I'll show people.
[03:43:00.730 --> 03:43:02.551]  Go to the site and find it.
[03:43:02.551 --> 03:43:03.592]  Go ahead and punch this up for me.
[03:43:03.592 --> 03:43:09.734]  I want to show folks the young Raymond Frank there in his Lieutenant Colonel uniform.
[03:43:09.734 --> 03:43:11.335]  I got my wings when I was 19.
[03:43:11.335 --> 03:43:15.217]  That's what that picture was taking way back there.
[03:43:17.045 --> 03:43:23.789]  I'm going to put it up on screen for people watching on PrisonPlanet.tv if we can punch my camera up.
[03:43:23.789 --> 03:43:24.190]  There it is.
[03:43:24.190 --> 03:43:25.711]  I have everybody out there.
[03:43:25.711 --> 03:43:26.271]  There he is.
[03:43:26.271 --> 03:43:30.694]  People watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:43:30.694 --> 03:43:33.555]  Tell us a little bit about your Air Force career.
[03:43:33.555 --> 03:43:37.037]  Well, the Air Force career, of course, started
[03:43:38.892 --> 03:43:52.818]  In 1943, went through pilot training, got my wingsuit when I was 19, went overseas, had my choice to stay in Japan and fly P-51s or go over to Korea and fly P-38s.
[03:43:52.818 --> 03:43:57.019]  I chose Japan and I'm glad I did because I later went to Korea during the Korean War.
[03:43:59.184 --> 03:44:08.927]  But then later I decided I needed to learn something besides flying and I became a special agent with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.
[03:44:08.927 --> 03:44:19.930]  The only problem was I was a captain and major and you wind up behind a desk while the younger people in the lesser rank go out and do the
[03:44:21.917 --> 03:44:24.700]  The intelligence work and counterintelligence work.
[03:44:24.700 --> 03:44:26.883]  And here you are pinning a medal on a lovely young lady.
[03:44:26.883 --> 03:44:27.584]  Who's that?
[03:44:27.584 --> 03:44:28.745]  That's my daughter Brenda.
[03:44:28.745 --> 03:44:36.493]  She was an Air Force Lieutenant graduate and her initial assignment was an aircraft maintenance officer at Dover, Delaware.
[03:44:38.976 --> 03:44:42.017]  I taught her how to change oil in a Volkswagen.
[03:44:42.017 --> 03:44:43.097]  What was Korea like?
[03:44:43.097 --> 03:44:45.938]  What were you doing over there?
[03:44:45.938 --> 03:44:50.400]  I'd been married one month, went overseas to Korea.
[03:44:50.400 --> 03:44:52.060]  Went to Kimpo Air Base.
[03:44:52.060 --> 03:44:53.681]  I was there about two weeks.
[03:44:53.681 --> 03:44:56.402]  The Chinese were coming south, so we evacuated.
[03:44:57.442 --> 03:45:00.924]  About 24 hours before they got there and went back to Japan.
[03:45:00.924 --> 03:45:03.985]  I stayed over for that thing for about 8 months.
[03:45:03.985 --> 03:45:06.926]  What kind of missions did you fly during that?
[03:45:06.926 --> 03:45:09.087]  The F-82s and F-84s.
[03:45:09.087 --> 03:45:10.407]  What were you doing?
[03:45:10.407 --> 03:45:13.589]  What kind of missions?
[03:45:13.589 --> 03:45:17.670]  Looking for a big aircraft to shoot down and so forth.
[03:45:17.670 --> 03:45:18.611]  That never happened to me.
[03:45:18.611 --> 03:45:20.772]  I didn't get a chance.
[03:45:20.772 --> 03:45:23.373]  Some people did, not many of them.
[03:45:23.373 --> 03:45:26.434]  So you were basically hunting around to direct other aircraft?
[03:45:27.014 --> 03:45:37.310]  Well, flying up near the Yellow River and where we could encounter the enemy and take care of them in the appropriate manner.
[03:45:37.310 --> 03:45:39.633]  And then, what did you do during the Vietnam era?
[03:45:41.600 --> 03:45:48.204]  I was a special agent with the Air Force in London and Wiesbaden, Germany and Berlin.
[03:45:48.204 --> 03:45:50.125]  Different places like that.
[03:45:50.125 --> 03:45:51.146]  Pretty exciting.
[03:45:51.146 --> 03:45:53.827]  Berlin was considered the spook capital of the world.
[03:45:53.827 --> 03:45:57.509]  A lot of agents out there, counterintelligence agents.
[03:45:57.509 --> 03:46:00.091]  Did you ever run into E. Howard Hunt?
[03:46:00.091 --> 03:46:01.251]  He was over there at that time.
[03:46:01.251 --> 03:46:02.192]  No, I didn't.
[03:46:02.192 --> 03:46:05.214]  I know about him and I know his background, but I never did.
[03:46:06.169 --> 03:46:07.150]  All right.
[03:46:07.150 --> 03:46:09.232]  Well, again, I hope people will call.
[03:46:09.232 --> 03:46:10.593]  I hope they'll get involved.
[03:46:10.593 --> 03:46:17.879]  And we know there's a lot of election fraud, but we're going to have Vote Rescue Austin, Vicki Carbhow, doing a great job watching all of that and tracking that.
[03:46:17.879 --> 03:46:20.922]  And regardless, we need a big showing for Sheriff Raymond Frank.
[03:46:20.922 --> 03:46:23.384]  Tell everybody you want a chance at having a really great sheriff.
[03:46:23.384 --> 03:46:26.127]  Let me tell you, he's as good as they come.
[03:46:26.127 --> 03:46:26.567]  We need him.
[03:46:26.567 --> 03:46:28.049]  Does he have your vote, Paul?
[03:46:29.079 --> 03:46:30.000]  He does have you.
[03:46:30.000 --> 03:46:35.743]  Okay, Paul out there, our IT guy, also running the Prison Planet broadcast transmission.
[03:46:35.743 --> 03:46:36.803]  He's all for you.
[03:46:36.803 --> 03:46:37.944]  Sheriff, thanks for coming in.
[03:46:37.944 --> 03:46:38.665]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:46:38.665 --> 03:46:42.947]  I really enjoyed it, and to the citizens, I have a very good chance of winning.
[03:46:42.947 --> 03:46:45.608]  All they need to do is get out there and vote on the 20th absentee.
[03:46:45.608 --> 03:46:51.212]  Yeah, they're a very small turnout for the Sheriff, and if our listeners get involved now, I just should have had you on earlier.
[03:46:51.212 --> 03:46:52.132]  Well, I think it's
[03:46:53.965 --> 03:46:56.229]  What you're doing is, I really appreciate it.
[03:46:56.229 --> 03:46:57.451]  It's going to help a lot.
[03:46:57.451 --> 03:46:58.673]  Alright, good to see you, my friend.
[03:46:58.673 --> 03:46:59.735]  Thank you.
[03:46:59.735 --> 03:47:00.536]  What a great guy.
[03:47:00.536 --> 03:47:03.682]  I had a chance to meet him and his wife one time.
[03:47:03.682 --> 03:47:06.847]  I went out and visited him in his house and he is just a great guy.
[03:47:06.847 --> 03:47:07.368]  Thank you, Sheriff.
[03:47:08.752 --> 03:47:10.953]  Oh boy, so much going on.
[03:47:10.953 --> 03:47:17.477]  That was a great hour and a half plus with Raymond Frank, Red Beckman, and Jack McClam.
[03:47:17.477 --> 03:47:29.223]  You know, we could focus all day on the economy, and we have been doing show after show after show after show on that subject in great detail, and we will continue to do that throughout the week.
[03:47:29.223 --> 03:47:37.327]  We've got the guys from the Money Masters on with us tomorrow to get into how the private central banks are engineering all of this by design.
[03:47:38.720 --> 03:47:43.353]  I want to cover some financial news now here right at the end of the final segment when we come back, but before I do that...
[03:47:44.520 --> 03:47:57.489]  You know, I spent over an hour today going after Zeitgeist Addendum, because I was saying, oh, I think you're a good guy, oh, I think your film, I disagree with quite a bit of it, the utopia, withering away of the state and, you know, gun disarmament and all of this.
[03:47:57.489 --> 03:48:03.212]  But I said, you know, I know you're bashing Christians and religion, you know, and that doesn't exist and is hokey superstition.
[03:48:03.212 --> 03:48:07.115]  But I said, you know, I think you should, you know, widen your horizons a bit.
[03:48:07.115 --> 03:48:14.220]  But then I went and looked into it more and found out that it's very cultic, tied into the Theosophic Society, the U.N.
[03:48:15.320 --> 03:48:31.269]  I cover that in part of the first hour and then into the second hour today, and if you didn't hear that on the AM and FM dial during this show or on shortwave or satellite, it's all going to re-air in about 12 minutes at InfoWars.com on the audio streams.
[03:48:31.269 --> 03:48:42.995]  Let me tell you, this thing is very popular in the Liberty and Awakening movement, and I would love to say it was good and it was happy and it was friendly, but I'm glad that I started looking into it more and found what I found because
[03:48:44.255 --> 03:48:45.196]  They have the U.N.
[03:48:45.196 --> 03:48:51.079]  Christ, the world government Christ, who the U.N.
[03:48:51.079 --> 03:48:56.482]  and Theosophic Society believes is the world government Christ.
[03:48:56.482 --> 03:49:01.825]  Intros and outros of the film, and they talk about the God Spirit and all the stuff in us.
[03:49:01.825 --> 03:49:06.147]  So see, they're saying we're all religious kooks when I'm not even debating them about bashing Christians.
[03:49:06.147 --> 03:49:07.248]  I'm not even engaging there.
[03:49:07.808 --> 03:49:18.372]  I'm like, what about all this about world government and re-education and all this on a good world government and saying the private banks are free market and the scam they're running is free market when it's not?
[03:49:18.372 --> 03:49:19.792]  And it's like, oh, you just aren't smart.
[03:49:19.792 --> 03:49:20.973]  You're just a lowly Christian.
[03:49:20.973 --> 03:49:21.873]  You just don't know.
[03:49:21.873 --> 03:49:22.913]  You just don't understand.
[03:49:22.913 --> 03:49:25.394]  You just can't even quite, you know, it's too advanced for you to understand.
[03:49:25.394 --> 03:49:26.135]  I'm like, no!
[03:49:26.135 --> 03:49:28.956]  I've seen this for 150 years out of the New World Order.
[03:49:28.956 --> 03:49:30.676]  And then I went and researched it more.
[03:49:30.676 --> 03:49:32.957]  And I mean, just for two hours.
[03:49:32.957 --> 03:49:34.638]  And that was researching about the first 20 minutes.
[03:49:35.911 --> 03:49:39.232]  It would take months to research every bit of it.
[03:49:39.232 --> 03:49:46.514]  Every door I knock down, it's just like the stench of New World Order is just absolutely off the charts.
[03:49:46.514 --> 03:49:50.215]  Before we end this segment, I want to tell you about one of our fine sponsors.
[03:49:50.215 --> 03:49:51.295]  That's Okolo Blue.
[03:49:51.295 --> 03:49:53.916]  Okolo Blue.

[03:50:39.756 --> 03:50:41.258]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[03:50:50.285 --> 03:50:56.049]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[03:50:56.389 --> 03:50:58.890]  Now, Calbin soaps are available to you and me.

[03:51:05.052 --> 03:51:06.233]  No animal testing.
[03:51:06.233 --> 03:51:07.573]  I use them and love them.
[03:51:07.573 --> 03:51:09.474]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[03:51:09.474 --> 03:51:10.875]  And I say big time.
[03:51:10.875 --> 03:51:12.595]  Call Calbin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[03:51:12.595 --> 03:51:12.935]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[03:51:22.339 --> 03:51:29.822]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[03:51:29.822 --> 03:51:31.783]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[03:51:31.783 --> 03:51:35.405]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:51:35.405 --> 03:51:37.866]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:51:37.866 --> 03:51:40.907]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:51:40.907 --> 03:51:46.649]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:51:46.649 --> 03:51:50.551]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[03:51:50.891 --> 03:51:56.075]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[03:51:56.075 --> 03:51:59.137]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[03:51:59.137 --> 03:52:06.343]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[03:52:06.343 --> 03:52:12.327]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[03:52:12.327 --> 03:52:16.831]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[03:52:17.151 --> 03:52:18.992]  The Info War is waiting for you.
[03:52:18.992 --> 03:52:22.053]  To set it free, join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:52:22.053 --> 03:52:24.034]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[03:52:24.034 --> 03:52:26.175]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[03:52:26.175 --> 03:52:27.956]  Bring down the New World Order.
[03:52:27.956 --> 03:52:31.717]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:52:31.717 --> 03:52:46.664]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here recently, and she was talking about the Great Depression, and we were talking about the gas prices, the food prices, this economic uncertainty we're in, these, you know, really kind of perilous times, no one knows where we're headed or where we might end up, and she was reminded of
[03:52:46.664 --> 03:52:46.924]  I don't know.
[03:53:02.756 --> 03:53:02.976]  No.
[03:53:02.976 --> 03:53:04.477]  We know one thing's certain right now.
[03:53:04.477 --> 03:53:08.440]  We're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a global food shortage.
[03:53:08.440 --> 03:53:09.761]  Now what can you do to prepare?
[03:53:09.761 --> 03:53:10.582]  Do what I did.
[03:53:10.582 --> 03:53:12.163]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[03:53:12.163 --> 03:53:14.945]  Go to the J. Michael Stephens eFoodsDirect.com company.
[03:53:14.945 --> 03:53:16.826]  Get some food and put it away and be safe.
[03:53:16.826 --> 03:53:18.387]  Put a little security in your life.
[03:53:18.387 --> 03:53:19.568]  You deserve security.
[03:53:19.568 --> 03:53:20.569]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:53:20.569 --> 03:53:21.189]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:53:21.189 --> 03:53:21.309]  1-800-409-5633.
[03:53:21.309 --> 03:53:21.990]  Put some food away.
[03:53:21.990 --> 03:53:22.470]  Do it now.
[03:53:22.470 --> 03:53:22.530]  1-800-409-5633.
[03:53:38.693 --> 03:53:46.797]  There are more than 360 comments in an article I posted written by Chris White up on InfoWars.com.
[03:53:46.797 --> 03:53:51.619]  It's High Guy's Tooth, Theosophy, Socialism, and the New World Order.
[03:53:51.619 --> 03:53:55.921]  In the rebroadcast on the web, I've detailed just some of the hires we found.
[03:53:55.921 --> 03:54:02.704]  So I need to go back and say I thought they were nice guys and were just misguided in some ways using the hook of 9-11 and the banking system.
[03:54:03.544 --> 03:54:06.388]  And the implication they're on there right now saying, oh, you're here for the banking system.
[03:54:06.388 --> 03:54:07.209]  No, it's a fraud.
[03:54:07.209 --> 03:54:08.730]  It's not free market.
[03:54:08.730 --> 03:54:09.812]  I mean, look, I'm sorry.
[03:54:09.812 --> 03:54:12.315]  It's total Illuminati brainwashing.
[03:54:12.315 --> 03:54:14.457]  And I'm going to counter it.
[03:54:14.457 --> 03:54:15.619]  It's over.
[03:54:15.619 --> 03:54:17.301]  Sorry, gloves are off now.
[03:54:17.301 --> 03:54:17.721]  Get ready.
[03:54:18.722 --> 03:54:20.824]  Get ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:54:20.824 --> 03:54:22.925]  All right, I want to tell you about two other quick sponsors.
[03:54:22.925 --> 03:54:26.308]  I'm going to hit some financial, final financial news.
[03:54:26.308 --> 03:54:32.232]  Obviously, eFoodsDirect.com, the best long-term storable foods company.
[03:54:32.232 --> 03:54:34.074]  They are the longest continually operating.
[03:54:34.074 --> 03:54:34.834]  Great folks.
[03:54:34.834 --> 03:54:36.776]  Freeze-dried and dehydrated.
[03:54:36.776 --> 03:54:38.958]  Stores for more than 10 years in climate control.
[03:54:38.958 --> 03:54:40.038]  10 years in your attic or
[03:54:41.379 --> 03:54:42.400]  I don't think so.
[03:54:57.385 --> 03:54:59.466]  And then, of course, just a huge sponsor.
[03:54:59.466 --> 03:55:01.946]  We're so proud to have NewVitality.com.
[03:55:01.946 --> 03:55:10.109]  Again, another mainline vitamin and mineral company that only has well-researched vitamins and minerals and other herbs that are known to have nutritive effects.
[03:55:10.109 --> 03:55:17.731]  Things like their high-powered 30 ingredients, but the main one is concentrated aloe vera, aloes, colon, and body cleanse.
[03:55:17.731 --> 03:55:18.671]  Call and check into that 1-800-569-4056.
[03:55:18.671 --> 03:55:18.831]  1-800-569-4056.
[03:55:18.831 --> 03:55:19.431]  Our super beta prostate.
[03:55:25.773 --> 03:55:36.996]  Men over 40, 45 really need to be taking salt palm meadow, but this is a bunch of other herbs known, even medically proven, to have a lot of really good effects on the prostate.
[03:55:36.996 --> 03:55:37.716]  1-800-569-4856.
[03:55:37.716 --> 03:55:39.897]  Super, beta, prostate.
[03:55:39.897 --> 03:55:41.497]  Or the website, newvitality.com.
[03:55:41.497 --> 03:55:43.658]  They have hundreds of great products there.
[03:55:45.285 --> 03:55:59.013]  Okay, man, I got to a lot of financial news right at the start of the show, but then I got off into Zeitgeist Addendum, which I shouldn't even have talked about until I'd deeply researched it, and now I did a little bit more.
[03:55:59.013 --> 03:56:00.994]  My God, is it horrible.
[03:56:00.994 --> 03:56:02.115]  Very, very hardcore.
[03:56:02.115 --> 03:56:03.636]  Very, very serious.
[03:56:03.636 --> 03:56:06.678]  And again, if you don't know, you'll find out coming up in the next hour.
[03:56:07.698 --> 03:56:10.739]  You know, I know I'm a feeble brain, and I love people who are feeble brains.
[03:56:10.739 --> 03:56:12.620]  You can't even consider what we're saying.
[03:56:12.620 --> 03:56:18.362]  You're bashing all these religions, and in your theophic society, Messiah is the one in the movie.
[03:56:18.362 --> 03:56:24.344]  You know, global messiahs, global governments, re-education, eradicating the classes.
[03:56:24.344 --> 03:56:26.325]  Alright, I'm already getting off into it.
[03:56:26.325 --> 03:56:29.086]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[03:56:32.935 --> 03:56:38.301]  But on the subject of the economy... Oh, by the way, we just have some huge guests coming up next week.
[03:56:38.301 --> 03:56:39.923]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[03:56:39.923 --> 03:56:42.586]  You're going to hear some really big guests on this show.
[03:56:42.586 --> 03:56:43.988]  What's up, Paul?
[03:56:43.988 --> 03:56:44.568]  Paul's smiling.
[03:56:44.568 --> 03:56:45.870]  He's excited, too.
[03:56:45.870 --> 03:56:48.293]  Everybody knows when I say huge guests, I mean it.
[03:56:48.293 --> 03:56:51.897]  Some really big guests next week, and we'll continue to track everything that's happening.
[03:56:51.897 --> 03:56:53.338]  I have so much Zeitgeist stuff in here.
[03:56:54.019 --> 03:56:56.640]  I'm digging around looking for my financial stuff.
[03:56:56.640 --> 03:56:59.942]  Great story from Infowars.net by Steve Watson.
[03:56:59.942 --> 03:57:10.166]  Total bailout cost heads towards $5 trillion already, and then he lists the $5 trillion bailout, as we told you three weeks ago, but now detailed.
[03:57:10.166 --> 03:57:13.347]  We've already spent over $2 trillion of the $5 trillion.
[03:57:13.347 --> 03:57:16.469]  Dow Jones bloodbath mirroring 1929.
[03:57:16.469 --> 03:57:21.611]  Bottom should be around 20%, 27% lower than it is now.
[03:57:21.611 --> 03:57:23.012]  That's coming out of CNBC.
[03:57:23.932 --> 03:57:30.417]  We're going to have depression and hyperinflation.
[03:57:30.417 --> 03:57:31.257]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:57:46.860 --> 03:57:49.961]  They can prop the stock market up, and I doubt they'll be able to do that.
[03:57:49.961 --> 03:57:54.344]  The point is, the hyperinflation is what is going to be devastating.
[03:57:54.344 --> 03:57:55.944]  Oh, and they've killed No.
[03:57:55.944 --> 03:58:00.486]  2 in Al Qaeda for the third time, but they're not retracting any of the other killings of him before.
[03:58:00.486 --> 03:58:01.907]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:58:01.907 --> 03:58:03.008]  We're out of time.
[03:58:03.008 --> 03:58:04.388]  That's it for the live transmission.
[03:58:04.388 --> 03:58:07.450]  Great job to the crew, the sponsors, the affiliates.
[03:58:07.450 --> 03:58:09.751]  We'll be back on the web right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:10.825 --> 03:58:15.827]  Oh, and by the way, for web listeners, I'm going to keep going a little bit here, John.
[03:58:15.827 --> 03:58:19.068]  We now have the free archives up on InfoWars.com.
[03:58:19.068 --> 03:58:23.910]  You can listen how you want, when you want, not just by subscribing to the podcast, but we've got about a month up there so far.
[03:58:23.910 --> 03:58:26.592]  We're going to post like three years backdated up there.
[03:58:26.592 --> 03:58:30.573]  We have to laboriously go through and do that, so that's happening as well.
[03:58:30.573 --> 03:58:31.374]  Okay, that's it.
[03:58:31.374 --> 03:58:33.555]  Even on the internet stream, we will now leave you.
[03:58:33.555 --> 03:58:34.255]  God bless you all.
