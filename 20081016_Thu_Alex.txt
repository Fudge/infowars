[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:20.960]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:35.680]  I say it all the time everybody says it time is just blasting past us is flying past us
[00:35.680 --> 00:43.560]  weeks are like hours now in my life and it's not just adults you know as we get older the
[00:43.560 --> 00:49.440]  time seems to speed up but it's young people are talking about experiencing it as well
[00:49.440 --> 00:58.040]  the stock market has been up and down all morning back on Monday of course it rallied
[00:58.040 --> 01:05.840]  close to a thousand points and then since then has lost almost all of that it's at 8000 it's
[01:05.840 --> 01:14.440]  actually lost more than that 8,424.11 on the Dow Jones industrial average but it had lost as
[01:14.440 --> 01:25.360]  many as 400 points earlier in the day it's risen back up to only be 153.80 points below its
[01:25.360 --> 01:39.280]  previous close yesterday the NASDAQ is down 1616 it's down to 1616 down 11.95 percent S&P is
[01:39.280 --> 01:51.320]  890.78 down 17.0 6 points so we will continue to watch that and track that as it develops
[01:51.320 --> 01:59.160]  coming up later in the radio show today in two hours in studio we have former Travis County
[01:59.160 --> 02:06.600]  sheriff Raymond Franks in studio with us he was also a combat pilot booking a record member of
[02:06.600 --> 02:12.400]  combat missions he was also in the military investigative arm and of course he's a Travis
[02:12.400 --> 02:20.800]  County sheriff and he's running again and he is absolutely totally anti-new world order says
[02:20.800 --> 02:25.680]  he'll ban at tasers in Travis County used by the sheriff's deputies they're already heavily
[02:25.680 --> 02:29.360]  restricting them in a whole bunch of different police departments right as they were proliferating
[02:29.360 --> 02:36.120]  because so many deaths aren't associated with them that should be an interesting discussion with
[02:36.120 --> 02:41.880]  former Travis County Sheriff Raymond Franks who again is running for Travis County Sheriff
[02:41.880 --> 02:46.920]  and this is not just a local Travis County issue for central Texas the seat of government here
[02:46.920 --> 02:53.640]  it's an issue for what sheriffs could be nationwide and how they are an elective representative
[02:53.640 --> 02:58.880]  and guardian of the people and are above the mayors that reside in the counties and above
[02:58.880 --> 03:08.800]  anyone else in the county they really are the most empowered type government official within
[03:08.800 --> 03:18.600]  the Constitution I mean they really do have martial law type powers but only because it is
[03:18.600 --> 03:25.600]  vested in the sheriff because he is elected by the county and answers directly to the people
[03:25.600 --> 03:31.000]  that's why the feds have moved to get rid of sheriffs in many states to phase the mount
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.680]  merge them into the cities the city is an incorporation a private corporation it is
[03:36.680 --> 03:41.120]  chartered under the state and under the county which is chartered under the state and so it
[03:41.120 --> 03:50.840]  is a creature of the state and the people's legislature so we'll break some of that down
[03:50.840 --> 03:56.640]  today you know I just got an idea Trey Trey listening my producer in the other room let's
[03:56.640 --> 04:01.800]  get I know Raymond Franks is scheduled to be on with us for an hour in studio we'll
[04:01.800 --> 04:07.840]  keep him longer if we can get red Beckman on for 30 minutes into the next hour into
[04:07.840 --> 04:14.160]  the fourth hour today the two o'clock hour to discuss the the position of the sheriff
[04:14.160 --> 04:19.160]  and there have been some sheriffs like Richard Mack and others that have said no to unconstitutional
[04:19.160 --> 04:26.320]  gun control and other instances so it'll be a wider discussion about that today that said
[04:26.320 --> 04:31.320]  I'm gonna come back to the latest economic news and then I'm gonna wade back into probably
[04:31.320 --> 04:41.240]  not for the last time zeitgeist I really think I was too nice to the maker of that
[04:41.240 --> 04:46.920]  and I should have been even more research on it before I had him on because I did end
[04:46.920 --> 04:52.040]  up doing some more research last night and I was blown away by what I found I mean blown
[04:52.040 --> 05:03.360]  away isn't even the word this is very serious we'll be talking about it they say you can't

[08:21.760 --> 08:27.760]  to do something a little bit different today I try this routinely and rarely succeed because
[08:27.760 --> 08:33.520]  I have so much news and information that I'll start covering one article and then it'll
[08:33.520 --> 08:38.040]  lead into 10 or 15 different subjects and then two three hours has gone by and we haven't
[08:38.040 --> 08:43.640]  taken your calls I want to give everybody a chance to call in about the economy about
[08:43.640 --> 08:48.840]  the election about the ridiculous debate with only 19 days to go until the election do you
[08:48.840 --> 08:53.120]  think the electronic voting machines are going to cheat for McCain do you think the establishment
[08:53.120 --> 08:58.800]  is behind Obama no doubting that the media tube if he doesn't get elected for some strange
[08:58.800 --> 09:05.200]  reason will there be riots in the country what did you think of my discussion with the zeitgeist
[09:05.200 --> 09:13.240]  fellow yesterday we can discuss it all in this first hour and then when I start the
[09:13.240 --> 09:21.960]  second hour I'm going to get into zeitgeist again and why am I talking about this well
[09:21.960 --> 09:30.160]  number one when the film came out well here I'm about to cover it all right now but now
[09:30.160 --> 09:37.120]  I'm going to do it next hour when the film came out it made fun of Christians and you
[09:37.120 --> 09:40.920]  know it's just really you're savage towards Christians particularly not just religion
[09:40.920 --> 09:48.480]  in general but religion in general and a lot of my film footage a lot of clips from my
[09:48.480 --> 09:57.680]  films were used in it and I decided not to weigh in on it I decided to leave it alone
[09:57.680 --> 10:03.280]  and to not attack the maker of it and then I got attacked for my footage being in it
[10:03.280 --> 10:12.440]  by Christians who were establishment types you know good at judging because my footage
[10:12.440 --> 10:27.200]  was in there when I had no control over that and then the new zeitgeist came out and Jason
[10:27.200 --> 10:36.480]  Burmes who you know is not really a religious guy called me up about two weeks ago and he
[10:36.480 --> 10:40.080]  said about three weeks ago he said have you seen this he goes oh my gosh it's total new
[10:40.080 --> 10:47.280]  world order and I said what do you mean and he said you got to see it and he because Jason
[10:47.280 --> 10:51.560]  really has studied the new world order he studied their their theosophic Luciferian
[10:51.560 --> 10:56.520]  religion and he said man this is everything we've heard before this is like high level
[10:56.520 --> 11:01.680]  you in religion stuff this is what the big guys are into he says you got to watch it
[11:01.680 --> 11:06.920]  so a couple days later I saw a link to it on one of my comment pages on info wars so
[11:06.920 --> 11:12.600]  I sat back and watched about 80% of it with the phone phones ringing and you know also
[11:12.600 --> 11:17.280]  taking care of business at night I got a halfway watched it and I was like man I've heard all
[11:17.280 --> 11:27.240]  of this before from ht wells and from the theosophic society and from masonic organizations
[11:27.240 --> 11:33.280]  and I said well I'll just you know make a comment on it then I think the guys nice and
[11:33.280 --> 11:38.040]  overall has some good messages about the banking system in the 9-11 but this is kind of scary
[11:38.040 --> 11:42.120]  and maybe we should warn these guys that they may be you know be going down a primrose path
[11:42.120 --> 11:53.400]  here and then I did cover it just you know and then boy I got attacked about how I'm
[11:53.400 --> 12:01.400]  an idiot Texan and I'm a knuckle dragon Christian and and folks I mean I'm not to my horn but
[12:01.400 --> 12:06.120]  we don't just make films about things we predict them before they happen you know I bring on
[12:06.120 --> 12:11.400]  experts Nobel Prize winners people from wide ranges of industry and society and they're
[12:11.400 --> 12:16.640]  always amazed at my generalist knowledge and that doesn't really come from being an atley
[12:16.640 --> 12:22.000]  some type of genius it comes from hard study and researching world systems and I don't
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.840]  put on an effected you know fake intellectual accent I don't wear sandals and have dreadlocks
[12:26.840 --> 12:31.480]  I'm not saying you're bad if you have sandals and dreadlocks I'm just saying I don't put
[12:31.480 --> 12:38.600]  on airs but I always love the pseudo-intellectuals who are just into talking like this and then
[12:38.600 --> 12:43.320]  they attack me as just you know you piece of garbage Christian you're a moron you don't
[12:43.320 --> 12:47.240]  have any right to comment on this because you're an idiot because you're a Christian
[12:47.240 --> 12:53.400]  and I'm like hey wait a minute I you know I'm not even judging you and saying you're
[12:53.400 --> 13:00.120]  a bad person because you're attacking Christianity I'm just saying I see a lot of new world order
[13:00.120 --> 13:06.200]  symbolism and Illuminati terminology here in fact it's dripping with it both films
[13:06.200 --> 13:16.760]  and I want to critique this and comment on it and just saying I'm a moron because I'm
[13:16.760 --> 13:22.000]  a Christian I mean there have been Christians who have invented hundreds of thousands of
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.720]  famous inventions and technologies and you know systems and I mean to say because somebody
[13:28.720 --> 13:33.520]  is a Hindu or they're a Christian or they're a Muslim they're they're automatically dumb
[13:33.520 --> 13:42.280]  or stupid is really asinine and so the people that are supporting the parts of zeitgeist
[13:42.280 --> 13:47.240]  one and two that I don't agree with they never encounter any of the evidence of the information
[13:47.240 --> 13:52.920]  we bring for they just say look you aren't allowed to comment because you are a religionist
[13:52.920 --> 13:58.400]  you believe in you know something more than just what we limited you know proceed with
[13:58.400 --> 14:07.160]  our five senses well then last night I decided to do a couple hours of research and I have
[14:07.160 --> 14:12.880]  done a great disservice I have been too nice about zeitgeist I did not I mean I didn't
[14:12.880 --> 14:17.720]  pass the smell test but then I finally looked in the trash can and and and rumbled around
[14:17.720 --> 14:26.800]  in it and I'm gonna do some more and it is pure Illuminati New World Order 110% and an
[14:26.800 --> 14:34.360]  attempt to co-op the giant liberty movement that like it or not was started by Christians
[14:34.360 --> 14:40.600]  who shattered the left right paradigm and saw the system and basically started this entire
[14:40.600 --> 14:45.000]  revolution that we see today because they had discernment understanding I don't mean
[14:45.000 --> 14:51.200]  the phony pulpit prostitutes of the new world order people so I was too nice and I'm gonna
[14:51.200 --> 14:55.760]  do several weeks of research on and off in between filmmaking having a big event coming
[14:55.760 --> 15:00.080]  up next week doing the radio shows trying to finish up the radio and TV studios were
[15:00.080 --> 15:04.800]  building I'm gonna do even more research and I'm gonna make like a 20 minute documentary
[15:04.800 --> 15:10.080]  for the web to deal with it because it has to be dealt with ladies and gentlemen in two
[15:10.080 --> 15:16.000]  hours of research last night I found out that the guy at the beginning and the end of the
[15:16.000 --> 15:23.800]  film alone was the world Christ of the thief's theosophic society and Blavatsky and then
[15:23.800 --> 15:30.600]  her acolytes and then he went around the world as the Christ the universal Christ for world
[15:30.600 --> 15:42.040]  government and that that this is the highest UN Luciferian capstone group now now now now
[15:42.040 --> 15:47.640]  maybe the maker of this doesn't know that Peter Joseph but but I doubt that because
[15:47.640 --> 15:53.720]  there's pyramids there's constant clips in fact let's just do part of this down the rest
[15:53.720 --> 16:04.760]  coming up next hour play that clip the new zeitgeist clip I am I sent you John now I
[16:04.760 --> 16:09.400]  mean and the films are riddled with this now this is what I'm saying listen to me zeitgeist
[16:09.400 --> 16:17.520]  well acolytes you know the Z day stormtroopers listen to me the whole thing is religious
[16:17.520 --> 16:27.560]  it is religious they believe it's a reincarnation sun group sun cult it's these are lucifer
[16:27.560 --> 16:34.320]  worshippers I mean that the this is incredible right in our face so again I hadn't really
[16:34.320 --> 16:40.920]  researched it I just saw the new one was like man this is some new world order stuff and
[16:40.920 --> 16:45.040]  then I was basically told oh you're not an electrical you can't even grasp it so so you're
[16:45.040 --> 16:49.520]  mindless if you believe in quote any religion but the one through religion which is what
[16:49.520 --> 16:55.280]  Albert Pike and Blavatsky and the rest of them put out so let's go ahead and play this
[16:55.280 --> 17:02.840]  clip well of the fact of the matter is joy comes from that bliss of connectedness that's
[17:02.840 --> 17:09.640]  our God's spirit that's that side of ourselves that really feels that deep inside it's this
[17:09.640 --> 17:19.080]  amazing wonderful feeling and you know when you get it you don't get it from money God
[17:19.080 --> 17:28.640]  spirit so I knew that I watched the new one went whoa man that stinks but they mix in
[17:28.640 --> 17:34.480]  911 truth mix in the monetary fraud of the private fellow reserve running at scam and
[17:34.480 --> 17:40.920]  they blame that on free market I was like whoa man that stinks hey did you know that
[17:40.920 --> 17:45.680]  you know abnc's really connected to what new world order acolytes have always put out
[17:45.680 --> 17:50.600]  and we've heard all this before and withering away the state eradicating classes and I said
[17:50.600 --> 17:54.160]  yesterday what happens if somebody doesn't want them you know be part of this brave new
[17:54.160 --> 18:01.640]  world he said well they'll be reconditioned reeducated yesterday reeducated reeducation
[18:01.640 --> 18:08.560]  withering away of states eradication of the class system there's a comment about the old
[18:08.560 --> 18:12.200]  things that are bad and the family stuck in the middle of it and then there's denials
[18:12.200 --> 18:19.000]  about all that but listen it's over I demand as I guys worshipers tell me why the Blavatsky
[18:19.000 --> 18:30.360]  cult theosophic society universal Christ I demand to know how I'm bad because I believe
[18:30.360 --> 18:35.280]  in Jesus Christ and then I but I've got a boat no religion exists nothing's real but
[18:35.280 --> 18:45.720]  your Christ I mean this is unbelievable and I've got it all here in front of me Alice
[18:45.720 --> 18:50.920]  Bailey all of them I mean this this is the official the only religion the UN gave headquarters
[18:50.920 --> 18:58.640]  at the UN facilities worldwide I mean this is the this is the Illuminati religion and
[18:58.640 --> 19:04.020]  throughout it are religious comments and they tell us none of your religions are real you're
[19:04.020 --> 19:08.560]  all stupid fools unintellectual for being in a religion and then it's dripping with
[19:08.560 --> 19:24.720]  religion filled with religion but again I don't speak with a lisp or go so so I'm not
[19:24.720 --> 19:31.200]  allowed to have an opinion I'm just some ancient you know old tradition mindless Christian
[19:31.200 --> 19:40.320]  you know I I I but but but just coldly intellectually scientifically you go and look at at who these
[19:40.320 --> 19:46.400]  people are what they push and the name of it the Venus project which is the Morning Star
[19:46.400 --> 19:57.600]  which is what Lucifer's called all of it all of it every single bit of it and I'm sorry
[19:57.600 --> 20:05.120]  I stand against Z-Day a day unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist
[20:05.120 --> 20:10.880]  act of war against this country the enemies struck America on September 11th but who is

[20:27.360 --> 20:33.840]  much engaged in spying in and on the u.s. I'm aware that some israeli citizens have been

[25:27.840 --> 25:33.760]  and uh he is the christ of the theosophic society in the united nations uh now we have been
[25:33.760 --> 25:40.960]  driven crim for decades running around saying there's a new uh christ a moddy uh a buddha depending
[25:40.960 --> 25:46.720]  uh again they're universal they're a moddy the muslims uh the christ to the christians and they
[25:46.720 --> 25:56.320]  say this and uh the buddha to the hindus and uh they basically their tradition is to go out it's
[25:56.320 --> 26:00.640]  kind of copying with the bettons they'll just go out by some river or some mountain and just pick
[26:00.640 --> 26:06.400]  some child they claim has the aura and it's really just the uh cults uses as their front
[26:06.400 --> 26:11.680]  to kind of bring him around like a side show to them generally you know trendy intellectuals and
[26:11.680 --> 26:16.000]  people if you read it it's rocket scientists and engineers and you know that's who's involved in
[26:16.000 --> 26:23.120]  all of this uh and and and united nations people and marie strong and adolf hitler i mean just a
[26:23.120 --> 26:29.680]  who's who henry ford it doesn't matter i mean they they're into this this is the elite religion is
[26:29.680 --> 26:39.360]  the opposite and uh madame blavatsky and this is the christ the christ he is the lord that he was
[26:39.360 --> 26:44.080]  the coming one and then he died in the eighties and he's you know been reincarnated supposedly
[26:44.080 --> 26:50.320]  going to save us all i mean reincarnation uh universal christ all this stuff and he starts
[26:50.320 --> 26:58.480]  zeitgeist and ends it and then there's a luminati stuff throughout it i'm already getting off into
[26:58.480 --> 27:05.600]  it i i just i mean i'm sorry if i see something and i know it's new world order just the first
[27:05.600 --> 27:10.880]  time i opened the box up on who are well i'll be friendly they mean well you know it's anti
[27:10.880 --> 27:16.560]  fellow reserve and we're talking about 911 inside job but see that's the whether intentionally or
[27:16.560 --> 27:22.080]  not that's the bait and i should have countered this you know years ago when it first came out
[27:22.080 --> 27:26.000]  and then they had to admit they got it all wrong about christians and the gods and had to change it
[27:27.360 --> 27:31.840]  it was quote a mistake you know i guess we can believe it was an accident to get it all wrong
[27:32.560 --> 27:36.400]  uh but i ignored all that i see i'm not getting into these big fights with people
[27:36.400 --> 27:41.200]  and then it grew and grew and grew and then another one comes out and and and clearly the addendum
[27:41.200 --> 27:50.320]  is the real film that that's the one and uh god help us and and and so i will have uh if you'll
[27:50.320 --> 27:57.440]  come back on i'll have peter joseph back on this week next week and sometime uh but i mean it's
[27:57.440 --> 28:05.120]  going to be uh no more mr nice guy i mean i joked around and screwed around in that uh
[28:05.120 --> 28:11.520]  discussion yesterday and was just blown away by him you know talking about reeducation and
[28:11.520 --> 28:16.560]  you know i'd have to be taken in condition and reeducated and withering away of the state and
[28:17.200 --> 28:19.760]  and that's what they did a hundred years ago is they'd have these same intellectuals they
[28:19.760 --> 28:25.040]  show little models of spaceships and super cities and Stalin did that and i'm like hey man i've heard
[28:25.040 --> 28:31.040]  all this before no you just can't even grasp it because you're a christian and that has
[28:31.040 --> 28:35.760]  that has diseased your mind where you can't even grasp what's going on with the false
[28:35.760 --> 28:39.040]  precept of religion meanwhile these guys are completely religious
[28:43.200 --> 28:47.840]  but that's what the theosophic society says they say every other religion is fake and false
[28:47.840 --> 28:54.160]  we are the one truth and we are reincarnations and lucifer is going to save us now uh maybe
[28:54.160 --> 29:01.600]  be peter joseph doesn't know all this but i i mean bottom line all the atheists out there
[29:01.600 --> 29:07.520]  who've gone on the board with zyka saying it's atheistic it's not it's inherently anti christian
[29:07.520 --> 29:11.520]  and i've always noticed that the atheists that's inherently what they are that that's inherently
[29:11.520 --> 29:20.000]  who they go after regardless of that is it intellectually fair to sit there and be little
[29:20.000 --> 29:26.320]  everyone who because of family whatever reasons you know culture has a particular religious system
[29:29.440 --> 29:37.360]  to then be filled with your own new world order religion i i mean that's that's just
[29:37.360 --> 29:42.800]  unbelievable so so so that's coming up in the um in the next hour i'm gonna spend some time on

[35:47.200 --> 35:51.200]  came out a few days ago and did report the central banks are consolidating power and
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.440]  making huge profits right now that they actually like what's happening
[35:57.040 --> 36:02.320]  and then they can have a political excuse to give themselves unlimited liquidity while they cut off
[36:02.320 --> 36:08.640]  funds to the rest of the economy so they can consolidate things they have currency we don't
[36:09.840 --> 36:14.560]  a depression in the real economy a huge infusion of fiat currency into the banking system
[36:15.120 --> 36:18.640]  then they could buy up real assets before the currency is fully devalued
[36:20.960 --> 36:25.600]  and that is in business week again yesterday i just couldn't believe that they were telling
[36:25.600 --> 36:32.000]  the truth in there another story here from cnbc credit cards could become next trouble spot in
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.640]  crisis credit card link when she's are likely to become the next flashpoint and there's
[36:37.520 --> 36:42.800]  over a trillion dollars in those but the impact the overall economy won't be won't be as severe
[36:42.800 --> 36:48.160]  as the housing slump analysts believe yeah right as the economy worsens and unemployment rises more
[36:48.160 --> 36:52.480]  americans are having trouble paying off their credit cards and their balances that has pushed
[36:52.480 --> 36:58.160]  up losses for credit card issuers forced them to tighten standards let's put a further squeeze
[36:58.160 --> 37:03.200]  on cash trapped consumers see not only do the private banks loan out
[37:06.000 --> 37:12.960]  money to people that didn't have any credit they then sold those debts as securitized triple
[37:12.960 --> 37:19.680]  a rated means the highest quality investment so that's why they would send it to the teenager
[37:19.680 --> 37:23.760]  that's why they send it to the person with no job that's why once you're solvent they don't
[37:23.760 --> 37:29.280]  send you as many credit cards because they they they get to get you into debt they get to sell
[37:30.400 --> 37:37.120]  the securities into derivatives they get to leverage that and then they quote get bailed
[37:37.120 --> 37:43.200]  out as the again currency liquidity credit has been cut off to companies individuals
[37:46.080 --> 37:48.640]  and i couldn't believe it i'm gonna go to your calls in a moment
[37:48.640 --> 37:56.480]  i couldn't believe it i was watching cnbc this morning at about 9 30
[37:59.600 --> 38:04.000]  for those that t voted you i wish we put on youtube and the host of the show
[38:05.120 --> 38:10.960]  kept saying over and over again for for for an hour i don't know i was jogging on the treadmill
[38:10.960 --> 38:16.400]  from 9 30 to about 9 uh to about 10 10 when i ran took a shower and drove the office i get ready
[38:16.400 --> 38:22.240]  before i don't know why i get into details it doesn't matter the point is is that uh he was saying
[38:22.240 --> 38:29.280]  over and over again why was there a secret meeting monday and tuesday why are there no
[38:29.280 --> 38:34.880]  minutes why are hundreds of billions being given to banks why is this run only by goldman sacks
[38:35.440 --> 38:39.440]  why is it all being handed directly to themselves why is it completely secret
[38:39.440 --> 38:47.120]  and as all three of his guests said it's wonderful it's good we've got to keep it secret i mean just
[38:47.120 --> 38:54.000]  out in the open steve watson has an article out the document that it's already five trillion
[38:54.640 --> 39:00.320]  in the last year pumped into these financial institutions five trillion in the united states
[39:00.320 --> 39:08.480]  in europe alone the bailout is two weeks old and they've already pumped in over a trillion it is not
[39:08.480 --> 39:15.840]  seven hundred billion conservatively it's to be five trillion a lot of publications say it's more
[39:15.840 --> 39:24.000]  like ten trillion now everybody's confused and they're saying is it depression or is it inflation
[39:24.000 --> 39:29.920]  because the economists tell you that you only get one of the other because of loss in demand
[39:29.920 --> 39:38.160]  oil goes from a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel to a hundred and sixty to sixty five
[39:38.160 --> 39:41.920]  dollars a barrel from a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel to sixty five dollars a barrel
[39:44.960 --> 39:50.400]  the real economy is shutting down the real economy is stalling out like an airplane engine
[39:50.960 --> 39:55.760]  you know you're flying at a thousand feet and your engine stalls out the propeller stops spinning
[39:55.760 --> 40:05.040]  black smoke starts boiling out from under it but on top of that they are hyper inflating the currency
[40:06.960 --> 40:12.640]  so that as bad as the contraction in the economy the recession which is
[40:13.200 --> 40:19.040]  depressionary you will have an overlay of not having jobs not having an availability
[40:19.040 --> 40:27.520]  of cash and credit and physical symbols of money through the monetary fraud that is not free market
[40:27.520 --> 40:34.560]  it's engineered scam that's now gobbling the entire economy you won't be able to get physical
[40:34.560 --> 40:41.760]  money like during the great depression but everything will be inflated in cost because
[40:41.760 --> 40:48.000]  they're only giving the currency to the bankers they're only giving it to the institutions who
[40:48.000 --> 40:57.600]  are sharing it with no one so it is the worst possible economic scenario all right i'm i'm
[40:57.600 --> 41:01.280]  done i'm gonna go to your calls for the next 30 minutes or so then i'm gonna get into zeitgeist
[41:01.280 --> 41:06.240]  addendum which i've actually had time to analyze more and it's far worse than i originally thought
[41:06.240 --> 41:13.440]  and uh... just my like criticisms and concerns have been uh... responded to in a cult like
[41:13.440 --> 41:18.800]  fashion and and and now i know why uh... because you've got a lot of well-meaning people that
[41:18.800 --> 41:26.000]  are fooled by its altruistic pie in the sky vision so many people pushing the past hitler
[41:26.000 --> 41:33.600]  mal Stalin you know similar utopia visions with images of high-tech cities in the background
[41:33.600 --> 41:38.080]  and something simple easy silver bullet and then you've got those in the inner
[41:38.080 --> 41:43.520]  sanctum of this that was like a nine-eleven truth moment that was an attempt to take it over by u n
[41:43.520 --> 41:49.600]  your range of cult openly you know ufo is going to land and take us over people and then that failed
[41:50.480 --> 41:54.160]  that's why mainly back we are changed because it was a split there in new york and we got
[41:54.160 --> 41:58.320]  behind the folks that we knew were real activists and not steering us away from real issues and
[41:58.320 --> 42:02.400]  taking action you're gonna have the same thing i mean you're going to have i said on the day
[42:02.400 --> 42:08.000]  nine eleven happened that they're going to map engineer this like america carried out these attacks
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.240]  the united states carried out these attacks and blame it all on the united states i said they're
[42:12.240 --> 42:17.120]  going to release torture photos and they did the blame on the u.s when the u.s is a tool of the european
[42:17.120 --> 42:23.040]  banking elite so we take the blame so the idea free market is destroyed and liberty is destroyed
[42:24.560 --> 42:27.520]  so they can make the new global system based out of europe
[42:27.520 --> 42:35.120]  tied in with china and russia look like the good guys but tom hung up who called to disagree
[42:35.840 --> 42:40.400]  tom we put you to the head of the line one eight hundred two five nine nine two three one
[42:41.200 --> 42:47.040]  you were saying you disagreed with me about um zeitgeist addendum and i was just told about
[42:47.040 --> 42:50.560]  your call when we came out of the last break 10 minutes ago and i put you to the head of the
[42:50.560 --> 42:54.880]  line tom i mean did you not like what i was just saying about zeitgeist you don't want to come on
[42:54.880 --> 43:04.400]  and defend your ideas i mean what we've got is the ufo cult what we've got is these new
[43:04.400 --> 43:08.560]  ageers who is nothing new about it it's the occult and i found out that some of the radio
[43:08.560 --> 43:13.360]  hosts other people that are attacking me they themselves are admitted occultist and they all
[43:13.360 --> 43:17.680]  they do is attack and bash christians and try to make the new order a christian conspiracy
[43:17.680 --> 43:23.840]  give me a break and so i'm always learning more and i'm finding out our movement is completely
[43:23.840 --> 43:30.320]  filled here i'm trying to be nice and friendly completely filled with the theosophic society
[43:30.320 --> 43:36.720]  luciferians and higher masonic orders and they're coming in and then we're all being friendly going
[43:36.720 --> 43:39.600]  well okay as long as you're fighting a new world order as long as you're talking about the fellow
[43:39.600 --> 43:42.880]  reserve and as long as you're talking about nine eleven inside job we're not going to get in
[43:42.880 --> 43:47.440]  fights with the over religion but meanwhile they're always attacking us saying we're bad
[43:47.440 --> 43:54.080]  so so get that straight this is the new world order ladies and gentlemen bottom line the time
[43:54.080 --> 44:00.800]  call back in i want you to keep a line open and again how do we know he disagreed we don't screen
[44:00.800 --> 44:04.240]  your calls we ask your name where you're calling from you can make it up if you want you can say
[44:04.240 --> 44:09.840]  billy bob from ten buck two but if you volunteer you disagree go to the headline i want the line
[44:09.840 --> 44:16.880]  kept open for tom one eight hundred two five nine nine two three one hey listen there's no debating it
[44:18.240 --> 44:26.560]  zeitgeist intros and outros with the theosophic society's world christ the leader of all religions
[44:26.560 --> 44:36.800]  the the the the the moddy the the the the the global solar christ
[44:38.800 --> 44:42.400]  i'm sorry you can't laugh at us like saying you're right and i've always found
[44:43.680 --> 44:48.640]  99 of the time if they're at a high level now low level agnostics and and and um
[44:50.160 --> 44:55.360]  atheists i found are generally decent people they just don't know they can't prove something
[44:55.360 --> 44:59.360]  and and and so they're saying i don't you know i don't believe it but when you get to prominent
[44:59.360 --> 45:04.560]  atheist and people it's always a vicious hatred of all the religions and you find out
[45:04.560 --> 45:05.840]  they're into the occult
[45:08.640 --> 45:12.960]  so really it's their way like albert pike said of discrediting all other religions and systems
[45:12.960 --> 45:21.200]  to destroy it to build their new utopic morning star venus lucifer project system
[45:21.200 --> 45:28.000]  turns out the engineer they interviewed as the venus project lives in venus florida
[45:28.560 --> 45:34.000]  i gave tray his number i want to try to see that gal come on come on defend your ideas about this
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.480]  and i'm not trying to get in the fight i try to stay out of fights but when i find out that the
[45:38.480 --> 45:44.160]  theophic society when i find out that that that that i mean the tip top of the new world order
[45:44.160 --> 45:47.760]  is coming in here and telling us what to do with telling us how to behave and telling us
[45:47.760 --> 45:52.640]  we're christian caveman and telling us to sit down and shut up i got a problem did tom call back in
[45:55.440 --> 45:59.600]  one eight hundred two five nine nine two three one you see disagree about with me about zeitgeist
[45:59.600 --> 46:06.080]  on fred and philly are on the air i like something paying careful attention i'm
[46:06.880 --> 46:13.440]  i do like you i'm angry at mr joseph and i want to seriously give you what i think about
[46:13.440 --> 46:24.400]  um the film and the um the interview yesterday i think that um he has a theocratic uh goal
[46:25.360 --> 46:35.440]  and unlike you uh he is intolerant and he has the uh uh the habit of um shouting down other people
[46:36.080 --> 46:41.600]  well what he was making false charges and really vicious attacks and then going oh poor me i i did
[46:41.600 --> 46:46.160]  nothing but listen i i i'm the bad one here i didn't do my homework and i don't think zeitgeist
[46:46.160 --> 46:51.280]  supporters have that's why they don't show his name at the start of the film they have to the
[46:51.280 --> 46:59.760]  u n the christ to christians the antichrist the declared global messiah is who introduces the
[46:59.760 --> 47:05.280]  film i mean i had no idea i mean you know i was there being a nice thing and oh well i think you
[47:05.280 --> 47:09.200]  might be getting into some dangerous new world order stuff and maybe not knowing and that's why
[47:09.200 --> 47:14.320]  you can see the new order doesn't matter and it's not the issue the uh the the reallians have the
[47:14.320 --> 47:21.920]  slogan sciences love so it's it's similar to that the reallians you know that's the thing it's all
[47:21.920 --> 47:30.720]  the same these groups the reallians the oranges the u n the theosophic society uh they all it is
[47:30.720 --> 47:35.760]  the same thing i've seen it a hundred times and so i was saying hey you're mixing in new order
[47:35.760 --> 47:41.040]  stuff i've seen a hundred times uh you know put up for 150 years by the uh originally the fabian
[47:41.040 --> 47:46.080]  socialist with hg wells and others and i said you're putting out that and they was like you
[47:46.080 --> 47:50.560]  can't even comment you're a you know you're a close minded christian alex there's no religion
[47:50.560 --> 47:56.960]  meanwhile they are hardcore religion and what does he what does he expect people to do to give up
[47:56.960 --> 48:02.400]  their right of conscience i mean you have to if you want to believe something it actually is
[48:02.400 --> 48:10.400]  is part and parcel of who you are because you have that ability to or not to believe something he
[48:10.400 --> 48:15.200]  wants to get rid of that right of a belief that's what they always say in the french revolution
[48:15.760 --> 48:18.880]  the jack of it is the same thing they said we're going to go to a 10-day work week we're going
[48:18.880 --> 48:23.360]  to change the months to 10 months and we're going to overturn everything they always do that
[48:23.920 --> 48:26.480]  but they're overturning it back to the old system
[48:26.480 --> 48:34.960]  um it's a counter revolution i mean judge a tree by its fruits since we became decadent
[48:34.960 --> 48:40.640]  new world order we've lost all of our blessings before we weren't perfect but look at how nothing
[48:40.640 --> 48:44.000]  you know everything turned to gold we touch now everything turns to crap
[48:45.760 --> 48:50.960]  this this is just incredible i just couldn't believe the venom that he had and the fact
[48:50.960 --> 48:57.520]  that it was what he was saying wasn't even logical let alone uh but it's religious john play that
[48:57.520 --> 49:02.400]  clip again play the new clip from today this is from zeitgeist and now listen to this religion
[49:02.400 --> 49:08.240]  listen to the religious ecstasy and he's saying the spirit here it is well the the fact of the
[49:08.240 --> 49:16.320]  matter is joy comes from that bliss of connectedness that's our god spirit that's that side of ourselves
[49:16.320 --> 49:22.000]  that really feels it you can feel it deep inside it's this amazing wonderful feeling and you know
[49:22.000 --> 49:32.880]  when you get it you don't get it from money and while that's being shown uh a a druidic
[49:32.880 --> 49:36.560]  right symbol with the hands in a pyramid with the sun in it is on the screen
[49:37.840 --> 49:43.920]  did he say god spirit or did he say god experience i think i think i heard him say god experience
[49:43.920 --> 49:50.480]  play it again wellity but the fact of the matter is joy comes from that
[49:50.960 --> 49:58.160]  bliss of connectedness that's our god spirit that's that side of ourselves that really feels it
[49:58.720 --> 50:06.000]  god spirit it's this amazing god spirit but again i told you the theophic society always poses
[50:06.560 --> 50:13.680]  as anti-religionist as as as as everybody's a bunch of cavemen idiots but then there it is over
[50:13.680 --> 50:21.920]  and over again this is incredible and listen i didn't do my homework i mean i'll be honest with
[50:21.920 --> 50:26.640]  you i uh in bits and pieces took me a year to ever watch you know the original three hours

[54:18.880 --> 54:25.840]  okay tom you disagree about zeitgeist agendum which i hate even giving attention now that i
[54:25.840 --> 54:30.720]  was just how serious it is but it has to be countered and the gate's open we just have to
[54:30.720 --> 54:40.080]  do it uh tom in the uk you disagree go ahead hi yeah my my battery ran out before i mentioned to
[54:40.080 --> 54:47.600]  john i only had about 15 minutes of battery well i apologize then go ahead no that's all i haven't
[54:47.600 --> 54:55.920]  actually seen like i've done them yes and um i i didn't listen to a bit of your your interview yesterday
[54:55.920 --> 55:01.760]  um but there was a part of it and there was a fundamental point that you misunderstood
[55:04.000 --> 55:12.240]  it was about what is the mother of invention what is the mother of creativity new uh advances new
[55:12.240 --> 55:20.160]  new ideas the point that was being put to you and i think it's probably in the film although i haven't
[55:20.160 --> 55:30.160]  seen it yet it's not to do with any sort of sort of monetary gain yeah anyone who's had an invention
[55:30.160 --> 55:38.320]  a real invention something that involves um inspiration or you know creative idea knows that
[55:38.320 --> 55:45.600]  it you know it's a completely ridiculous to think that that is because of some sort of
[55:46.880 --> 55:54.160]  monetary gain or gain of of any sort of material thought it's alive with me created
[55:54.160 --> 56:00.880]  it's caught look listen listen listen these are insane arguments i understand what you're saying
[56:00.880 --> 56:07.920]  we have to have resources we humans have always had to do some type of labor and we're unhappy
[56:07.920 --> 56:12.400]  if we don't do something there's certainly dehumanizing types of labor dehumanizing
[56:12.960 --> 56:18.960]  systems but elie whitney created his cotton gin to make money and then he had his invention stolen
[56:18.960 --> 56:24.320]  and then he finally made it by creating rifles uh that could be mass produced that weren't made
[56:24.320 --> 56:28.880]  one at a time and he invented that that later led led to henry ford and and and you know mass
[56:28.880 --> 56:35.280]  production assembly lines so i actually know all about it uh and and so i mean listen maybe is
[56:35.280 --> 56:40.560]  because i'm got such a feeble i'm got such a feeble mind hold on such a feeble mind that that that
[56:40.560 --> 56:45.920]  maybe it is going right over my head and maybe religions are bad unless it's the global christ
[56:45.920 --> 56:50.480]  maybe i'm not getting that either uh you know religions are all bad you're a bunch of cavemen
[56:50.480 --> 56:56.640]  idiots but we love the global christ uh explain to me what you're saying about someone who makes
[56:56.640 --> 57:02.240]  an invention doesn't want monetary gain i don't understand that i'm not i'm not saying that you
[57:02.240 --> 57:08.080]  know after you've had your invention so you might then think oh i can make some of the money out of
[57:08.080 --> 57:15.680]  it but the invention is the inspiration that comes through you from what i would say from the divine
[57:15.680 --> 57:20.560]  i would say there's saying there is no divine unless you're not even know they're not how could
[57:20.560 --> 57:26.880]  you guys watch this you haven't even seen it i haven't seen it but i think it's new age zombie
[57:26.880 --> 57:34.400]  isam it's unstoppable we're talking about god's but you were saying that's religion what i would
[57:34.400 --> 57:39.920]  suggest that the maker might counter to you is the talking about god is not the same as talking
[57:39.920 --> 57:44.960]  about religion no no he said he said on the show no no that's not what he said
[57:48.800 --> 57:55.600]  god almighty all this circular reasoning it it's just it's unspeakable what circular
[57:55.600 --> 58:04.160]  oh no it's not circular the religion is not the religion is this structured man might think
[58:04.720 --> 58:10.400]  religion versus spirituality religion versus spirituality i understand but but what do you
[58:10.400 --> 58:17.200]  think religion springs from it is a manifestation of man's spirituality and then it becomes institutionalized
[58:17.200 --> 58:26.320]  you're not what i'm not i'm not sure if religion springs necessarily from spirituality religion
[58:26.320 --> 58:32.720]  might well spring from an idea to co-op i'm saying in its earlier roots it does listen
[58:33.280 --> 58:38.640]  man i appreciate your call it was really good talking to you why don't you go see it first

[1:00:54.320 --> 1:01:00.800]  us today as well coming up in about 10 minutes i'm going to get into uh... my latest review of
[1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:06.080]  and i've done some more research on zeitgeist addendum we just had a caller that illustrates
[1:01:06.080 --> 1:01:11.040]  everything i'm talking about he hasn't even seen it and he's saying and i was pointing out last hour
[1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:21.680]  that in zeitgeist it it turns out that they're introducing the the global christ of the theophic
[1:01:21.680 --> 1:01:26.640]  society introduces and ends the film there's all sorts of religious statements and that's what the
[1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:34.560]  highest masonic orders through albert pike and others said is that we're going to discredit
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:38.480]  we're gonna have the atheist and the muslims and the christians basically all kill each other
[1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:41.920]  and we're going to discredit all religion and say we're atheist and then we're going to bring in
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:49.840]  the one true worship elucifer in the very theophic society's global christ is who they have in the
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:55.520]  movie you cannot make this up and i say how is it that no one else can have a spirituality
[1:01:55.520 --> 1:01:58.880]  and none of that exists calling that religion that's what they're saying none of it exists
[1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:07.840]  it's all science but then say oh but we can talk about our religious dogma and reincarnation and
[1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:13.040]  that's okay that is the new age through atheism discrediting other religious systems and it's
[1:02:13.040 --> 1:02:18.160]  very intellectually dishonest i just it's it's off the charts ladies and gentlemen i i mean i
[1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:22.960]  haven't even paid attention to this film and now i'm actually analyzing it and it's off the charts
[1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:29.120]  off the charts uh and the reason this is important is is that it is attempting and i'm seeing this
[1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:34.080]  not just with it but all at every at every front of 911 truth you name it different tentacles of
[1:02:34.080 --> 1:02:38.480]  this all basically saying the same thing moving in to the alternative media the patriot movement
[1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:44.000]  the awakening uh so uh you know oh we're for this world government you know i mean we're against
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:48.480]  this bad world government but we have our own loving world government and you will be reeducated
[1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:57.280]  by the way let's go to uh josh you know john and wilming you're on the air go ahead
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:04.480]  yeah hi alex hi alex i've got a comment and then a prediction the comment is if this guy
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:09.840]  thinks he's the world christ let him stand on a railroad track while a diesel locomotive is
[1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:14.720]  coming down the track and we'll soon find out what he is but but but i'm being called a nut
[1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:19.680]  christian because i have some spirituality and but they're saying no spirituality nothing but
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:27.920]  then they are saying we have the christ well and let me make my prediction i think the cfr is going
[1:03:27.920 --> 1:03:35.200]  to elect barack obama and then have him assassinated because look what they've been doing for the past
[1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:41.520]  several months they've been trying to equate him as the new black john f kennedy they even had on
[1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:47.920]  nbc nightly news the other night uh they had some old recordings that then bradley did with
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:53.920]  john f kennedy before he was elected president so it's this little subtle inference that oh if you
[1:03:53.920 --> 1:03:59.920]  vote for obama you're voting for jfk then when they knock him off they'll have first of all the
[1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:12.320]  excuse to impose full-blown martial law and then they'll have the excuse to confiscate all the firearms
[1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:18.720]  what do you think i think you raise something that is a distinct possibility because i think
[1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:24.080]  just as government can give you something government can take away just as government can
[1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:30.320]  get someone elected they can also knock them off because as you well know the cfr knocked off
[1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:39.280]  kennedy after he imposed uh executive order 11110 on june 4th 1963 recalling all those
[1:04:39.280 --> 1:04:45.200]  fraudulent federal reserve notes and issuing debt-free united states notes well they can't have
[1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:52.640]  that so the bankers made darn sure that jfk didn't live to uh celebrate his accomplishment
[1:04:52.640 --> 1:04:56.320]  the only difference is barack obama is completely in league with the bankers but we'll see what
[1:04:56.320 --> 1:05:04.800]  happens good point stay with us you know i know exactly what you're thinking when it comes to
[1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:10.240]  this economy the banks are crashing the stock market's a mess there's the mortgage crisis
[1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:17.360]  there's the lending crisis there is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis and we
[1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:21.360]  are paralyzed a little bit we don't know exactly how to respond to it i don't know what to say i'm
[1:05:21.360 --> 1:05:25.360]  what can you do do what you can do that's what you do you do what you can do what i can do is

[1:08:41.840 --> 1:08:48.800]  all right ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us i have decided in the next 50 minutes
[1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:56.480]  of this hour to get into zeitgeist addendum i have now analyzed it more looked into it
[1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:06.240]  a lot more deeply zeitgeist addendum and it is very very serious and i am going to be
[1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:16.800]  in future broadcast doing even more research and breaking it down why is this important
[1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:23.840]  because it's one of the most virally viewed films on the internet probably second or third to
[1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:32.560]  loose change second edition but definitely rivaling it when it came out and was anti religious
[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:38.720]  period but particularly against christians a few years ago the first zeitgeist i didn't get into
[1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:51.360]  a fight i'm not here to argue with a bunch of different old socialism and what the united
[1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:58.080]  nations pushes and we've we've seen all of the same things being said in zeitgeist addendum
[1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:02.160]  uh from the other uh different groups in the new world order crowd
[1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:08.080]  and he said you need to watch it you need to look into it so a few days later
[1:10:10.320 --> 1:10:16.160]  i one night watched almost all of it i didn't watch all of it because the phone was ringing
[1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:20.400]  and things were going on that evening at my house but i watched most of it and i had the
[1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:25.440]  view of well it exposes the monetary fraudulent private banking system and it exposes how how
[1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:33.760]  they manipulate the economy to consolidate power and it you know does some good things you know
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:41.280]  dealing with 911 being an inside job but they had this um you know industrial scientist on
[1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:46.160]  there calling basically for this future utopia and a classless society and eradicating the classes
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:54.960]  and the state withering away i mean that's a quote and i knew from the theosophic society i knew
[1:10:54.960 --> 1:11:01.120]  from the eugenicist later the transhumanist i knew from hg wells and barter and russell and
[1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:05.520]  countless others that that the highest levels of the new world order at the united nations at
[1:11:05.520 --> 1:11:11.040]  greenpeace mckelgorbachoff that this has been what they've been pushing for 150 years
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:16.320]  but now it was being mixed in
[1:11:18.720 --> 1:11:23.760]  with i suppose an anti-new world order view but then i had the creator on
[1:11:23.760 --> 1:11:30.480]  one of what was i guys wanting to and i was you know bringing up the fact uh that the
[1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:33.920]  new world order had called for similar things and he would poo poo that despite the fact it's
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:38.720]  historical and i would play him clips of hg wells film things to come which was saying
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:43.200]  similar things almost identical things you know book written almost a hundred years ago made
[1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:53.600]  into a film 80 years ago 80 or so years ago and then i noticed how people on the message board
[1:11:53.600 --> 1:11:58.720]  at info wars dot com commenting on the stories who were against me for questioning it we're
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:02.880]  basically saying you know you're just a dumb christian so you're not allowed to pretty much
[1:12:02.880 --> 1:12:07.280]  even have an opinion they weren't countering any of the issues i brought up and i made clear that
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:14.960]  i'm just analyzing this in a secular fashion i'm just looking at it historically and and
[1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:24.640]  where we've heard all these same things before well last night i went and rewatched part of it
[1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:32.000]  and they didn't say what his name was so i did more research to find who he was because i've
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:38.080]  been sure i'd seen him before and seen photos of him before and it turned out that i had
[1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:44.000]  that now remember zeitgeist is saying basically anything religious anything spiritual
[1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:47.920]  you know any of these mainline religions
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:55.760]  that anybody who believes any of that is basically culturally and mentally tainted now
[1:12:55.760 --> 1:13:00.080]  in their whole in their whole world view and in atheists and agnostics are the main people
[1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:10.880]  pushing this film and then i noticed amongst many things in the documentary was a jidu krisna murdy
[1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:20.240]  who was born in 1895 and died in 1986 and he was discovered by the leader of the theosophic
[1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:30.400]  society the heir of madame blavosky who of course was hitler's main spiritual leader
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:34.160]  and i'd read a couple of her books and i had remembered
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:40.960]  reading what the theosophic society said in the 20s
[1:13:44.160 --> 1:13:50.160]  and i knew that from the 20s or even earlier right through into the 70s and 80s they were
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:57.280]  saying that jidu krisna murdy was the universal christ to christians he would be jesus christ to the
[1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:09.440]  hindus and people he would be you know an eastern leader the different sex he would
[1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:15.360]  be buddha one krisna to another which of course buddha is just i guess the prophet of krisna
[1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:23.760]  and i was just completely blown away by this being hidden in plain view in the introduction
[1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:28.480]  and the ending of the film and then i remembered and was able to find the clips last night this
[1:14:28.480 --> 1:14:37.600]  is only in a few hours of research clips in zeitgeist where they talk about the god spirit
[1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:44.800]  in all of us now yesterday with the creator of the film i was saying well you know spirituality
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:49.360]  is an expression of people knowing there's something bigger that our eyes and ears and smell and
[1:14:49.360 --> 1:14:54.800]  taste and touch only picks up a very narrow spectrum of reality the mathematics shows all these other
[1:14:54.800 --> 1:14:58.800]  dimensions the beginning of science which are saying this is a scientific system
[1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:05.600]  which is what theosophic society says but they say it's reincarnation and also spiritual
[1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:10.560]  i was saying that you know how can you just say anybody who's basically spiritual or religious
[1:15:10.560 --> 1:15:17.520]  which grows out of that you know is backwards and stupid and and then just in a cursory inspection
[1:15:17.520 --> 1:15:25.760]  it is religious and that's exactly what albert pike and manly p hall you know all of these top
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:30.000]  masons in the last 150 years that's exactly what they said they would do they would go out and
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:37.440]  and and and discredit christianity islam uh hinduism all of these religions and that they
[1:15:37.440 --> 1:15:44.080]  would then replace it with the god man you know christ slash lucifer consciousness in an integration
[1:15:44.080 --> 1:15:49.360]  with technology and science we've posted some news articles and stories that have broken this down
[1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:54.160]  but i ran into last night uh upon info wars dot com and then just from a monetary perspective we
[1:15:54.160 --> 1:15:58.720]  have georegriffen with a review of that he's coming up to comment on zeitgeist uh denim later in the
[1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:08.240]  hour and so i asked the atheist and agnostics this how is it that i because i have to say i'm
[1:16:08.240 --> 1:16:14.240]  a christian am not even allowed to comment i am just just immediately you don't even have standing
[1:16:16.960 --> 1:16:20.240]  and you know we're basically a bunch of knuckle dragging buffoons
[1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:26.560]  but then we have the theosophic society's christ their leader which christians would
[1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:31.360]  say was the antichrist what do they say he's a world leader world religious leader who will be the
[1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:35.280]  the the the mati or the messiah the christ to every religion
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:43.520]  and that's exactly what they say he is and barbara marx hubbard and all of them
[1:16:44.320 --> 1:16:50.640]  and they took him around the world and benjamin cram and for 20 years says he has a new messiah
[1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:56.320]  and it's the same thing somebody picked out of the east so it's it's the same thing over and over
[1:16:56.320 --> 1:17:01.920]  again so i thought i would first play this clip from zeitgeist where they're talking about the god
[1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:09.920]  spirit spirits see that's exactly what the illuminati religion is everything else is
[1:17:09.920 --> 1:17:14.240]  discredited and then they rise up and they always package it as science here it is
[1:17:14.800 --> 1:17:21.760]  how are they but the fact of the matter is joy comes from that bliss of connectedness that's our
[1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:28.080]  god spirit that's that side of ourselves that really feels that you can feel it deep inside
[1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:32.240]  it's this amazing wonderful feeling and you know when you get it you don't get it from money
[1:17:36.400 --> 1:17:42.400]  okay god spirit and and and that's a separate individual you know talking in the film and
[1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:48.720]  then there is this jidu christin marty let's go ahead and play some of him from the introduction
[1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:53.120]  of the new film here it is we were saying
[1:17:55.440 --> 1:18:04.560]  how very important it is to bring about in the human mind the radical revolution
[1:18:07.440 --> 1:18:08.240]  the crisis
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:13.520]  is a crisis in consciousness
[1:18:13.520 --> 1:18:27.600]  a crisis that cannot anymore accept the old norms the old patterns
[1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:39.040]  the ancient traditions and considering what the world is now
[1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:48.800]  with all the misery conflict destructive brutality all right it goes on and on
[1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:53.280]  on and on the point is is that we must destroy all the old and bring them the new
[1:18:53.920 --> 1:19:00.080]  and and and this is the christ jidu christin marty
[1:19:00.080 --> 1:19:10.320]  so because i believe there's more than just what we see in the spectrum i'm a cook i'm a nut i'm

[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.880]  then i'm going to bring case environments and jeep are ripping on to comment on this
[1:24:02.320 --> 1:24:09.120]  from different angles i haven't really paid attention to zeitgeist and i saw people fighting
[1:24:09.120 --> 1:24:12.720]  on the internet fighting on the web a lot of zeitgeist people attacking myself
[1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:20.000]  and i just thought oh well they're just atheists too i mean i just covered the political information
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:26.960]  the markets the news and i saw them criticizing me and i'm like this isn't even a religious show
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:31.680]  but the mere fact that i say on there i am a christian angers them
[1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:38.080]  and if they're disconnected you know from from religion and spirituality well why do they even care
[1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:44.000]  when i'm not even really making that a big part of the show and then i noticed with bohemian grove
[1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:47.760]  i had all these leftist groups in in in monorio and california
[1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:54.560]  it real mad at me when i went in and filmed the ritual world leaders engaging in a black magic
[1:24:54.560 --> 1:24:59.280]  ceremony which is now international news admitted it goes on back at the time and people are even
[1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:03.440]  trying to deny that it was real footage but the grove is commented and said no it's real
[1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:09.440]  then we sent ed homen out to california the year after and there were all the major local peace
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:14.640]  groups by name and that's all in the order of death my second film on bohemian grove
[1:25:16.880 --> 1:25:21.040]  about 300 of them out there with the local activist leaders with a witch's pot
[1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:26.480]  believing that they were firing harry potter power beams out of their fingers
[1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:34.000]  into the grove to stop their ritual and then i talked to a lot of them privately and i called
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:37.920]  them up and i said well come on the show and talk about that no or not you make our religion of the
[1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:42.800]  earth look bad so what if they're in there doing that you need to make it about their monetary system
[1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:47.680]  and by the way there's a good new world order not just a bad one that's what you
[1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:52.640]  limitedly don't see you're a christian aren't you and i'm like well i didn't even make that film
[1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:57.280]  from a christian perspective i just went and covered it i mean it's weird with all these
[1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:01.600]  mainline republican leaders with gay porn stars and getting drunk and doing rituals
[1:26:04.320 --> 1:26:08.240]  and they're like oh you christian you're what's holding everything back no i'm not coming on
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:14.320]  your show these were the prominent peace leaders who we showed up and boy they didn't like it some
[1:26:14.320 --> 1:26:18.640]  of them got up from the ritual and left on the road with state police all around them in black
[1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:26.000]  uniforms riot police doing rituals with a witch's pot now see they were acting the very people on
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:32.560]  that video were putting out in the local newspapers on their websites we covered at the time we cover
[1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:36.960]  it in the film that i'm a nut and that they're atheist and i'm crazy believing in religion
[1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:44.800]  that it net folks see i am secularly as a reporter reporting on it and they can't sit over and over
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:52.640]  again do not show the ritual i remember calling some of the activist groups apparatus not can i
[1:26:52.640 --> 1:26:56.560]  said i want some of your photos of yours past your protest and things no we're not giving you
[1:26:56.560 --> 1:27:03.920]  anything you christian and i'm like well i didn't even tell you i was a christian how do you know
[1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:08.720]  well we know don't you worry and i was like we're atheists we think you're backwards and stupid
[1:27:08.720 --> 1:27:15.120]  then i show up in their their witches and warlocks that's the same thing oh you backwards christians
[1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:20.960]  you can't even comment you can't even grasp you know a resource-based economy in a global system and
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:24.640]  and then you're going to have to reeducate some people and we're going to have to eradicate certain
[1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:29.520]  things and you know i don't know if you've ever done a gun alex and i'm like well i have some
[1:27:29.520 --> 1:27:36.000]  reasons to be against that you can't even grasp what i'm saying well that's very insulting
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:40.880]  and i know that a lot of fake intellectuals are into saying you can't grasp but no i grasp it
[1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:46.960]  fully i hadn't even looked into you and now i'm going to shine a magnifying glass down your throat
[1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:56.240]  i'm gonna snake something down your gizzard and we're going to inspect you from head to toe
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:28:01.920]  from tail to hoof we are going to look at every bit of it because let me tell you something i scratch
[1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:08.640]  the surface and pus just starts squirting out so to all you atheists that have been sucked in by
[1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:14.000]  a theosophic society you better go read this theosophic society you better go find out about
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:19.600]  alex bailey you better find out about madame blavosky you better find out about lucifer trust
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:27.680]  there in new york at the un building and you need to discover that right now you know i've i've been
[1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:32.400]  neutral with all these groups and even had some on the show you know quote anti-new world order
[1:28:32.400 --> 1:28:37.200]  groups who are always for some reason anti-christian and then i get around them in person in austin
[1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:41.840]  and they say by the way i'm part of the theophic society in the order of the golden dawn and
[1:28:41.840 --> 1:28:50.080]  alex the crowley wasn't a bad guy so they're all out there i mean every time
[1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:56.400]  and i mean in this film they're talking about the god spirit they've got the the theophic
[1:28:56.400 --> 1:28:59.920]  society's christ they took around the world is introducing and ending it
[1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:04.960]  and the atheists are gonna double think because they've been trained they're gonna go well that
[1:29:04.960 --> 1:29:09.680]  that's all right or no that doesn't exist or they'll say you're crazy saying a devil exist
[1:29:10.480 --> 1:29:15.760]  you know an evil being my invention i make no no i'm i'm saying intellectually
[1:29:17.280 --> 1:29:21.840]  i'm saying from a secular view without god they're just looking at people's beliefs like
[1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:26.560]  we're studying a group of aboriginals i'm saying these people are saying all other religions are
[1:29:26.560 --> 1:29:31.680]  fake and religions don't exist and spirituality doesn't exist but then their film is filled with
[1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:38.320]  it and it happens to be the same religion of adolf alos hitler we'll be right back and and

[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:54.320]  society the roundtable groups the thamian socialist the marxist linus the malice i mean it is the same
[1:33:54.320 --> 1:34:01.040]  thing and and they make the new god technology and imply that all everybody else are troglodytes
[1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:04.880]  who are against technology that we're all these backwards people and then we just intellectually
[1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:10.000]  say well look look let's cut religion out of it uh you know what you're calling for is a type of
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:13.760]  religion and look you've got all these religious trappings and you know your leaders are these
[1:34:13.760 --> 1:34:19.600]  world christ and and and and you know all these occultists they're like no shut up you're a christian
[1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:26.160]  you know you you can't even comment on that you can't even grasp it and so that's the point that
[1:34:26.160 --> 1:34:36.240]  i'm uh raising here and i challenge everybody to go research the theosophic society and encyclopedia
[1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:43.520]  and to find out what they believe in what they push it is the worship of lucifer you
[1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:46.720]  can read the books written by the founder of it this is what hitler followed and
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:52.800]  today what uh most of your world leaders are adherents to tony blair is an inherent that's
[1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:58.000]  been in the news ted turners and inherent michael gorbachev's involved with all these groups i mean
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:01.440]  this is it they have an official office at the u n and on wall street
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:10.240]  and i want to be clear i i've done a bad thing in all this i ignored zeitgeist attacking christians
[1:35:10.240 --> 1:35:13.280]  and being wrong about it and having to admit they were wrong about the history they put out
[1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:17.200]  having to change it and saying eh whatever i'm not getting involved in that at least they're
[1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:23.760]  exposing 911 as an inside job but what that was is building up their cred moving into things and
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:27.440]  then intellectually being dishonest and saying oh you're just a bunch of religious nuts you
[1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:31.680]  can't comment we're like we're not even you know why do you keep bringing up christianity when i'm
[1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:38.800]  saying that uh you know a stateless state you know but uh and and and you know these communities and
[1:35:38.800 --> 1:35:43.760]  all this high tech stuff all this blather that we've heard over and over again and then saying
[1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:47.600]  the new world order is a joke it's falling apart it doesn't know what it's doing you know moving
[1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:53.680]  towards this stateless state through world socialism i mean it's the same intellectual crap
[1:35:54.240 --> 1:36:00.240]  that that that is false it it it's fraudulent there's nothing substantive it's not even real
[1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:04.800]  it's actually what kind of low-grade morons buy into it that's very effective with a dumb
[1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:09.760]  down kool-aid drinking mass that's finally figured out the government's evil and lying to him i mean
[1:36:09.760 --> 1:36:16.960]  to say that the private banking cartel is free market when it's a monopoly totally fraudulent
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:21.840]  completely criminal that's seeking to create a world monopoly and wants socialism and funds
[1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:27.040]  socialism to hamstring families to break down individual sovereignty and security to create
[1:36:27.040 --> 1:36:32.400]  a stateless state for the population where we have no positions but the elite are above us
[1:36:32.400 --> 1:36:40.640]  as the technocrats and i challenge you i challenge you to go read the externalization of the hierarchy
[1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:46.400]  by alice bailey and and and and and the lucifer trust and to read it and it's almost word for word
[1:36:47.040 --> 1:36:50.720]  what is being said in large sections of zeitgeist addendum
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:59.600]  very very serious and and and then well let's bring up jason bermas because we don't have a
[1:36:59.600 --> 1:37:03.840]  lot of time we're about to have jibra griffin on just to comment on this from a monetary angle
[1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:08.400]  and you can read up on info wars dot com his article about he said look i don't want to
[1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:12.160]  i didn't want to wait into this at first but it was very troubling very upsetting
[1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:17.280]  i'd seen this so many times before now it's been repackaged and claiming that it's you
[1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:23.440]  know anti-new world order while calling for global governance and then saying we're not even allowed
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:30.880]  to comment that we're just mere mortals but but you have to comment on it because it it's it's
[1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:36.240]  so serious so then i just started investigating it and here's the key and found out that the global
[1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:47.360]  christ jidu christa murdy who the theophic society pushed as the world christ is that is is is all
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:51.120]  over this film and is the beginning and end of the film and they have all these other religious
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:59.280]  clips about the god spirit now again that is all of it is exactly what we get from the highest
[1:37:59.280 --> 1:38:07.120]  levels of luminati religion man merging with machine a utopia society basically eradicating
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:11.680]  the other you know fraudulent religions that will just wither away like the state but it's always
[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:15.280]  bloody getting it but then they always claim it the outside oh no it's gonna be bloody there will
[1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:21.760]  be some reeducation though and then it's the exact same theosophic society's exact same people it's
[1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:27.120]  the same thing and they say oh no it's not i challenge you out there who are zeitgeist
[1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:33.120]  acolytes followers now to please go look at this and say how is all these other religions wrong
[1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:36.640]  and there's no such thing as religion or spirituality but then the things filled with
[1:38:36.640 --> 1:38:40.960]  religious connotations and illuminati buzzwords and the illuminati christ
[1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:49.280]  who they said was the christ jason bermus welcome to the airwaves for your comments on this well
[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:55.040]  thanks for having me alex uh yeah i came across out the day after it came out i uh downloaded
[1:38:55.040 --> 1:38:59.760]  off the internet and i sat down i watched it and i was very impressed with the editing quality in
[1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:05.520]  the first hour uh covering the federal reserve banking cartel it only got a few minor things wrong
[1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:11.120]  which uh g edward griffin goes into in his article but then when it really transcended
[1:39:11.680 --> 1:39:19.520]  into this utopian type society that is just uh you know short of a you know glorified version
[1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:27.040]  of brave new world or 1984 i was very troubled by it um like you said it's it's unbelievable i mean
[1:39:27.040 --> 1:39:32.080]  he uses a lot of truth for instance those technologies that are in the film they do exist
[1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:38.960]  but why would our global masters ever give us free access to them essentializing their control
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:43.760]  there's never really a solution given to that other than stop banking with them and stop joining
[1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:47.280]  the military listen here's the bottom line bermus and then this is the point i forgot to make
[1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:53.600]  it before i forget and then have you carry on continue that's the issue is that he kept saying
[1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:57.760]  the global government's a bunch of idiots are falling apart they're failing they're nothing
[1:39:57.760 --> 1:40:01.520]  you know global government isn't even the issue we're gonna have a good global governance
[1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:05.680]  and then i say well that's going to take enforcers and systems oh no it's not no it's not
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:08.800]  you know it's just going to happen then i go but you're repeating all this stuff i've heard before
[1:40:08.800 --> 1:40:13.120]  and he would just sigh and basically say that you know that wasn't the case even though it was all
[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:18.080]  the key marxist linus you know new world order buzzwords which comes out of this whole theosophic
[1:40:18.080 --> 1:40:24.880]  system it's only one brand of it and you know that was really the key uh to all of this is the new
[1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:30.720]  world order says they're setting up this utopia it's identical the the un says they're setting up
[1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:35.600]  what he's saying and he's acting like they've just now invented it and this engineer they're
[1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:40.800]  talking to has just now invented it when this is the new world order religion repackage as if it's
[1:40:40.800 --> 1:40:46.400]  anti uh new world order when there's no discussion about he's like you dealing with all these little
[1:40:46.400 --> 1:40:50.560]  problems and i'm like no no no we're fighting the fight we're holding back the tide it was all this
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:56.320]  disdainful moses on the mountain uh you know laughing at all the other religions when they are so
[1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:00.720]  highly religious they'll say yeah and they'll say they're saying they're not even spiritual they're
[1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:05.520]  saying it doesn't exist it's science religion but then that's what they're pushing bringing forward
[1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:13.600]  the christ of the un official religion of the theosophic society so i mean it's just so incredible
[1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:17.600]  to have it hanging right out there on the edge and and we're not even recognizing it when it's
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:23.120]  when it's the elephant hidden right in the room uh jason bermus i mean the new world order is is
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:29.040]  claiming they're going to set up with this world social estate uh what what what they are again in
[1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:34.400]  this film pushing go ahead yeah absolutely i mean when you hear the words one world one consciousness
[1:41:34.400 --> 1:41:38.400]  well that means that everybody's going to speak the same language we're going to be under the same
[1:41:38.400 --> 1:41:42.640]  set of rules it looks like we're all going to be wearing the same clothes according to this utopia
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:48.080]  i mean what is this i mean is this the humanity that you want to uh bring your children up in
[1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:54.400]  it certainly isn't what i want and it is what these globalists want however he fails to recognize
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:41:58.400]  that when they want to bring this in well they want to cut the population down by about 80
[1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:04.400]  percent oh no their film talks about how there is overpopulation yeah yeah it does but again it
[1:42:04.400 --> 1:42:09.120]  doesn't address this is a classic introduction they come in with all the anti-new world order
[1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:15.600]  movement stuff but but which which had been you know basically created generated the resistance
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:21.440]  by real christians at its core it comes in assaults them to get the atheists behind it and then
[1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:26.480]  brings it into religion in the next one doing a double-think game saying this isn't religion
[1:42:27.120 --> 1:42:31.280]  yeah and one of the things that i don't think you've touched upon enough is the fact that this is
[1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:36.240]  very earth-based i mean he really talks about which is what the theosophic there's so many
[1:42:36.240 --> 1:42:42.000]  points the theosophic society says the earth's load in harmony with the earth because the theosophics
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:48.320]  say we're worshiping the earth's spirit exactly it's the same thing and then you find out you know
[1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:54.240]  these high-level supposed christian conservatives are really into the occult and pagan earth worship
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:59.280]  and if you will watch that first zeitgeist film uh... you know the first part of that film is all
[1:42:59.280 --> 1:43:04.800]  about sun worship well again he fails to tell people that the people at the very very top
[1:43:04.800 --> 1:43:10.080]  are into these type of ceremonies you know they're into this paganism the sun where he does tell
[1:43:10.080 --> 1:43:14.720]  us in this clip play that first new clip from the day where where the person makes a pyramid
[1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:19.360]  with their two hands together and it shows the sun in it while this person is in religious
[1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:26.080]  ecstasy so so again all these religions are wrong but we have a new one it's not new here it is
[1:43:26.080 --> 1:43:34.080]  well the the fact of the matter is joy comes from that bliss of connectedness that's our god spirit
[1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:40.480]  that's that side of ourselves that really feels it you can feel it deep inside it's this amazing
[1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:49.120]  wonderful feeling and you know when you get it you don't get it from money so there you have
[1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:53.680]  the the god spirit in all of us and then if you say so i'm gonna get him back on and go what is
[1:43:53.680 --> 1:43:58.720]  this about a god spirit he'll just say you're a christian you can't even grasp it it's it's it's uh
[1:43:58.720 --> 1:44:06.240]  it's science oh man we're in a lot of trouble well i agree with yalex and uh you know thankfully i
[1:44:06.240 --> 1:44:11.040]  haven't really seen this at the top of the video charts obviously there's a buzz around it i just
[1:44:11.040 --> 1:44:17.040]  hope that a lot of newcomers to the movement don't look at this and take this for what we believe
[1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:21.840]  as a movement because this is really unrealistic socialist garbage that's been pushed like you
[1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:25.760]  said well i don't want to get into years exactly i don't want to get into what happened on 11 truth
[1:44:25.760 --> 1:44:33.680]  in new york but the main people in that's basically a a yaranja official u n ufo cult and uh they
[1:44:33.680 --> 1:44:38.640]  openly you know wanted it was basically tying down the real investigation and so things split off
[1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:42.800]  of we are changed but everywhere i look these people are all around us now they are moving in
[1:44:42.800 --> 1:44:48.960]  to take over this movement well yeah i mean obviously uh the more age of the culture have
[1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:54.560]  differentiated for the past 20 years and gotten more and more and more extreme and now people
[1:44:54.560 --> 1:44:58.400]  are you know willing to believe anything i mean look at that ray alien cult i mean it's
[1:44:58.400 --> 1:45:04.960]  unbelievable to me how you know masses can be swayed into these just a new age garbage type
[1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:11.840]  religion and by the way by the way there's now the z-force i know 40 000 people in a week he said
[1:45:11.840 --> 1:45:18.000]  and and and the z-force is going to save us and and re-educate us well 40 000 people to
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:24.080]  re-educate us well good luck guys because i don't think i need re-education i don't think that
[1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:30.480]  we're just going to solve all these quote unquote social issues with humanity by offering solutions
[1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:34.240]  but did you hear him on the show yesterday you said you were listening at home paint your house
[1:45:34.240 --> 1:45:39.280]  he's on there and i go what happens if i'm in the future utopia system and and i don't want to go
[1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:43.680]  along he goes well you'll be reconditioned you'll be re-educated yeah and he kept saying well you'll
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:46.880]  be given a choice i mean what's this choice is what are they going to put us on australia on
[1:45:46.880 --> 1:45:51.200]  some kind of island defend for ourselves i mean what what are these choices we're going to be
[1:45:51.200 --> 1:45:55.840]  given are we going to be given the lobotomized chip instead of the regular chip that most of
[1:45:55.840 --> 1:46:02.080]  humanity can handle i mean what are the choices we're going to get i it just i was in awe while
[1:46:02.080 --> 1:46:06.800]  i was talking about this technocracy of remote control cars and the government taking control
[1:46:06.800 --> 1:46:11.520]  or the system that that isn't a system and that's exactly what the new world order is building this
[1:46:11.520 --> 1:46:17.280]  total control grid yeah it was it was a lot like minority report without the ads for advertisements
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:20.800]  because they're just telling us it's going to be great it's going to be wonderful just like the
[1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:28.960]  soviet union do we have g evergryphon i bet we got time zone screwed up where they um
[1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:33.520]  c of trade gave you the right number because i'm g evergryphon wrote a review that's up on
[1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:37.360]  info wars dot com look it doesn't matter the american people the people of the world love
[1:46:37.360 --> 1:46:44.160]  being suckers and they woken up to one level of paradigm and then and then certainly that they
[1:46:44.160 --> 1:46:48.240]  woke up to organize religion being another level of paradigm and the disgusting phony christians
[1:46:48.240 --> 1:46:52.400]  and the phony muslims and all that stuff and i was saying all the muslims all christians i mean
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:56.960]  you know the establishment stuff and so they're saying oh we we we don't want religion but then
[1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:04.800]  it's the theosophic society with the world you in christ in it i mean bermas you can't make
[1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:10.800]  stuff up like this yeah and then he also tries to push the idea that you know evil doesn't exist
[1:47:10.800 --> 1:47:17.200]  but a boring behavior does well to me a boring behavior is being down at a uh restaurant you
[1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:20.640]  know a nice dinner with people and starting to pick your feet in front of people that's a boring
[1:47:20.640 --> 1:47:25.440]  behavior look look a boring behavior bermas this is what it is look yeah this is a psychological
[1:47:25.440 --> 1:47:29.440]  game where they say you aren't allowed to comment because you're part of a false religion you're
[1:47:29.440 --> 1:47:34.160]  not allowed to comment because you're closed minded there's no such thing as evil uh we will
[1:47:34.160 --> 1:47:39.840]  just you know reeducate everyone everyone's good we'll just you know again it's not allowing you
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:43.760]  to make choices that's what the new order does they're all about telling parents don't give
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:48.320]  your children your values let them be themselves meanwhile the state and the media and the and
[1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:53.680]  the schools are totally brainwashing them they don't want you to put your imprint on them
[1:47:54.160 --> 1:47:58.000]  because they want to put the new well we have to decide then do we do we like the new new
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:02.240]  world order system which is really the old tyranny system or do we like the more renaissance system
[1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:07.840]  that we were under well i couldn't agree with you more alex and uh i see that pushed more and more
[1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:11.920]  today among kids youth not only yeah they're just saying we're not allowed to even have an opinion
[1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:15.600]  it's just we're the intellectuals there's no north american union we're the intellectuals
[1:48:15.600 --> 1:48:19.040]  there are wmd's you're not allowed to comment you know and it's the same thing we're the
[1:48:19.040 --> 1:48:23.840]  intellectuals uh you know you you're not even you're just a bunch of religious coops every i
[1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:27.680]  mean i would sit there and say to him you know science shows that at least half of what we do
[1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:33.200]  is genetic and i would bring up that certain breeds of you know cowl are more more aggressive
[1:48:33.200 --> 1:48:37.280]  and he said nope that's not true and i said the science shows that i said what science
[1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:42.080]  i mean i've i've worked in this i and i'm giving him science not christianity he goes no that's
[1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:46.880]  your christian view i mean it's just an excuse hey i think two plus two equals four that's just
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:52.000]  your christian view uh well no i'm not speaking as a christian i'm i'm i'm saying you know why do
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:59.280]  you have the the the the the the christ leader of the u n uh with this global reincarnation christ
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:06.080]  consciousness that's all good in the god spirit but then if i talk about genetic engineering or
[1:49:06.080 --> 1:49:11.520]  something it doesn't exist because i'm not allowed to comment because i'm not a risen raised person
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:17.520]  like you yeah he doesn't have a really talk about the double-edged sword of technology and how these
[1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:24.320]  things can be used to restrict control and enslave us and are being used to do so you know i mean
[1:49:24.320 --> 1:49:28.560]  again everything's just there for us magically everything's going to work all the problems
[1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:32.800]  are going to be done no one's going to have a job apparently well i'll guarantee this you go down to
[1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:37.840]  new york and you hang around outside the theophic society offices and you go to their meetings
[1:49:37.840 --> 1:49:42.800]  and we need our people to do this join them if you have to and we're going to probably see
[1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:50.000]  some people we've heard from before but other but other under other names okay and peter joseph
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:55.920]  needs to tell us his real name he needs to tell us his funding because because you know and again
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:01.360]  folks i'm not saying we control this movement or we say what is going on i try to be open to everybody
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:05.680]  this is the opposite i'm saying grow it expand it have free discussions and thought
[1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:10.720]  i'm being told i'm backwards and bad that i can't even question this or i'm bad again religion
[1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:15.920]  doesn't exist we're all cooks spirituality spirituality doesn't exist but then they're all
[1:50:15.920 --> 1:50:20.720]  into spirituality but it's only their spirituality that's exactly what we get with albert pike and

[1:54:06.640 --> 1:54:14.400]  next briefly it's it's like a jedi mind trick it's like a marketing trick a magician trick
[1:54:15.040 --> 1:54:21.200]  you've got these theosophic un world government people and then they pose as if they're anti new
[1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:26.240]  world order and then they openly push all these religious statements about the god consciousness
[1:54:26.240 --> 1:54:30.640]  the god spirit in us but then say all the religions are bad that's what albert pike said they would do
[1:54:31.680 --> 1:54:35.520]  and uh that's what blows me away as i've ignored this this long and didn't really
[1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:39.920]  look into it and i scratched the surface and it was unbelievable i mean having the christ
[1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:46.160]  according to them of the theosophic society who they took around the world with them this
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:53.440]  jidu krishna murdy in the film i mean this is off the charts i want to bring jibber griffin on
[1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:58.160]  and keep burmese on the comment uh jibber griffin i mean uh i know you're looking at this from a
[1:54:58.160 --> 1:55:04.560]  monetary angle uh and uh you know with the silliness of it and basically how it's a repeat
[1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:09.840]  of carl marx and withering away of the state uh but uh i did i did some more research and i mean
[1:55:09.840 --> 1:55:19.040]  this thing is total you in jibber griffin yes yes uh am i on the air now yes sir oh well hello
[1:55:19.040 --> 1:55:25.440]  how are you yes i did look at this uh not from the theological perspective because i felt that
[1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:32.160]  there were other people who are far more qualified than i do analyzes from that direction and yes i
[1:55:32.160 --> 1:55:39.120]  was looking at it from the uh point of view in which they were uh presenting the federal reserve
[1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:44.880]  system and uh and attacking the federal reserve system and particularly from the point of view of
[1:55:44.880 --> 1:55:52.400]  what they proposed as solution to our problems and uh i found that in this film which was called
[1:55:52.400 --> 1:56:00.000]  zeitgeist addendum there was a lot that was very good in the beginning especially a lot of critique
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:05.120]  of the federal reserve system and i thought boy these guys are doing a good job and then it began
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:11.280]  to fall apart and and they came into some silly stuff about uh the fed never is able to create
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:16.880]  enough money to pay for the interest and a few other myths like that that are widespread but i
[1:56:16.880 --> 1:56:21.360]  could even forgive that because you know it does it doesn't make an awful lot of difference in the
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:26.880]  final analysis whether you believe that or not um but then they started getting into this business
[1:56:26.880 --> 1:56:33.600]  about well how are we going to solve all of this problem and lo and behold they were they had taken
[1:56:33.600 --> 1:56:39.840]  marks and then polished him up taken off the word marxism and communism but they kept all of the
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:49.280]  essential concepts of uh uh perfecting mankind getting rid of his greed supposedly they said
[1:56:49.280 --> 1:56:54.240]  that the whole problem of society was the profit motive and the free enterprise system and those
[1:56:54.240 --> 1:56:59.520]  have they implied the federal reserve as a free market thing not a parasitic rigged monopoly with
[1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:05.520]  the federal reserve funding the un and the opposite and centralization of power in the new man well
[1:57:05.520 --> 1:57:11.360]  yes that's it of course it is one of the greatest myths of the modern age that we live in a free
[1:57:11.360 --> 1:57:20.160]  enterprise capitalist system that had was gone decades ago and but yet it still lives on in name
[1:57:20.160 --> 1:57:25.120]  and so all of the marxists and neo marxists love to say see what's happening today that's a result
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:31.360]  of capitalism we must replace capitalism with socialism or some other form of collectivism
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:36.880]  and so they created a boogeyman that doesn't even exist and and people fall for it it's really easy
[1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:41.200]  to fall for it because you know we were told i was told when i was a kid that we lived in a free
[1:57:41.200 --> 1:57:46.640]  enterprise system that probably was true when i was a kid but it's not true anymore the problems
[1:57:46.640 --> 1:57:52.640]  we have today are not a result of free enterprise competitive capitalism as a result of collectivism
[1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:56.640]  socialism all right stay there we're gonna break for one minute and come back with five more minutes
[1:57:56.640 --> 1:58:01.600]  with g edward griffin and to get jason mermas's comment on this but zeitgeist addendum a critical
[1:58:01.600 --> 1:58:07.600]  review we have a link to it up on info wars dot com by g edward griffin and what i what really
[1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:14.320]  concerns me is i mildly criticized it without even really doing a super deep research just on the basics
[1:58:14.320 --> 1:58:21.040]  and cult-like attack of you know i'm just an idiot christian i can't even comment on it there's no
[1:58:21.040 --> 1:58:25.040]  such thing as religion when i wasn't even bringing religion up so i said i better look at the
[1:58:25.040 --> 1:58:33.520]  religious angle when it turns out this is total new order religion you are listening to gcn

[2:00:33.120 --> 2:00:38.480]  or our friendly towards it and uh... you know this is a news program i'm covering news and
[2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:42.400]  information and so they just bring it up like oh he's a christian it's all bull by the way we
[2:00:42.400 --> 2:00:46.800]  haven't the answer it's the weathering way of the state eradicating uh... the uh...
[2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:53.120]  the class system on and on and on and yesterday i said well i don't know what will happen if
[2:00:53.120 --> 2:00:57.520]  somebody doesn't want to go along with the system and the creator of uh... the zeitgeist
[2:00:57.520 --> 2:01:03.840]  and indom said well you'll have to be conditioned you'll have to be reeducated uh... i mean folks
[2:01:03.840 --> 2:01:08.000]  for those that know history and study like myself and mr griffin and others i mean we've seen all
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:13.840]  this a million times this is a repackaged and uh... in closing i want to uh... bring up bermas for
[2:01:13.840 --> 2:01:18.560]  any comments he's got but g ever griffin i want to have you back on later did not just get into
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:23.440]  this but but but how the whole liberty movement itself you know i'm sure you've noticed it everywhere
[2:01:23.440 --> 2:01:28.720]  has these people coming into it uh... and saying well the new order isn't the problem we need a
[2:01:28.720 --> 2:01:33.440]  good new world order of the people you know denying how society operates the g ever griffin
[2:01:33.440 --> 2:01:39.680]  yes we are right on target i think uh... alex that one of the uh... one of the
[2:01:40.480 --> 2:01:47.280]  most brilliant qualities of these new world order people is that they understand human nature
[2:01:47.280 --> 2:01:52.480]  and they know that there's going to be a tremendous uh... backlash against what they're trying to do
[2:01:52.480 --> 2:01:57.760]  so they never just wait for that to happen they send their people into the field and say look
[2:01:57.760 --> 2:02:02.480]  if there's going to be a backlash let's lead it ourselves or let's be influential on it so that
[2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:08.160]  we can control it and make sure that it doesn't go anywhere this has happened over and over again
[2:02:08.160 --> 2:02:12.880]  throughout history and you can see it coming up now of course i think you're actually right
[2:02:12.880 --> 2:02:19.440]  in your observation of that well there's no doubt uh... that this i mean you've seen it this is great
[2:02:19.440 --> 2:02:28.720]  a recycled uh... fabian socialist hg wells i mean it's a i mean it's word for word uh... what we
[2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:34.640]  have seen from the theophic society uh... and others and god help us because
[2:02:35.520 --> 2:02:41.680]  because uh... this is wide spread right now ladies and gentlemen alice bailey the externalization
[2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:46.880]  of the hierarchy let's bring in jason bermas briefly to finish up on more comments you've got jason
[2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:55.360]  somebody offers global governance or a new world order type scenario no matter how
[2:02:55.360 --> 2:03:00.560]  utopic it may sound for any problem i whether it be the federal reserve or nine eleven such
[2:03:00.560 --> 2:03:05.840]  as an international tribunal and the end of america you have to be very suspect of that person
[2:03:05.840 --> 2:03:10.400]  off the get go and you have to be very critical of their thinking because what these people want
[2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:15.680]  at the top is more consolidation of power it's about power they always consolidate for the
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:19.200]  greater good and claim it's going to be utopia i mean we've heard this over and over again all
[2:03:19.200 --> 2:03:24.160]  these young people don't know about the history and they better look into it i mean again how
[2:03:24.160 --> 2:03:29.920]  can you have the leader the christ of the of the u n theosophic society the official u n religion
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:36.080]  in the film and then they tell us oh you can't even argue about political systems you're you're
[2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:40.160]  the old order your christians we're not even bringing christianity up i mean that is always
[2:03:40.160 --> 2:03:46.960]  a red flag uh... i mean is that not jibber griffin yes it is well it's not just christianity any
[2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:52.800]  any organized religious or powerful religious group is an epimate to the new world order people
[2:03:52.800 --> 2:03:57.520]  because they're collectivists and they want complete loyalty and dependence upon the state the
[2:03:57.520 --> 2:04:02.240]  state is the new religion and that is what they say the new scientific state where they're going
[2:04:02.240 --> 2:04:06.160]  to scientifically control us and they claim the new world order currently isn't doing that of course
[2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:11.040]  they're setting up a scientific dictatorship yeah and then that's always been the goal of

[2:09:44.480 --> 2:09:49.680]  officer jack mclean joining us coming up in about 15 minutes from now i wanted to finish up now
[2:09:50.400 --> 2:09:58.160]  with jason bermas on zeitgeist addendum you know in closing jason just everything about it is bad
[2:09:58.160 --> 2:10:01.520]  they mix in that the fellow reserves bad and they say they have a new world order that's going to be
[2:10:01.520 --> 2:10:09.680]  great it's total theosophics society the un religion the un christ is in it they're talking
[2:10:09.680 --> 2:10:15.120]  about the god spirit in us and then telling us that we're just religious we're not even talking
[2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:19.920]  about religion because they are religiously obsessed with this new man this is straight
[2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:25.280]  up albert pike and we need to expose this because this is uh this is aggressive towards us i've
[2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:29.360]  noticed the whole movement is aggressive but then always acts like if you criticize it that you
[2:10:29.360 --> 2:10:34.720]  don't even count you're just an intellectual idiot shut up uh so just classic new world order tactics
[2:10:34.720 --> 2:10:40.400]  jason bermas yeah they also discussed how every civilization before the one that is created won't
[2:10:40.400 --> 2:10:44.480]  even be in the history books it'll be pretty much eviscerated and we'll just talk about how
[2:10:44.480 --> 2:10:48.720]  there were big land grabs and people took stuff from other people well that's that's pretty
[2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:54.720]  horrifying to me i'd like to think that the uh the story of the human spirit is going to live on
[2:10:54.720 --> 2:11:01.600]  for generations to come especially after we defeat these globalists alex well absolutely
[2:11:01.600 --> 2:11:05.280]  everything is a process and anybody that tells you that you know there's this utopia and the
[2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:11.280]  withering away of the state and we're going to reeducate people look out and i i just the public
[2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:15.280]  it a lot of people are being suckered by this but i'm going to have to counter it and then they
[2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:20.400]  never counter me on any of my facts like well why is this guy you know the the the the un christ i
[2:11:20.400 --> 2:11:26.560]  mean why am i god god spirit you know i'm not even bringing up religious systems you are
[2:11:26.560 --> 2:11:31.360]  and they just you know say shut up you know you're not even allowed to comment i mean i
[2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:35.520]  i just go back to that or they say you're just jealous of it no i've never even really watched
[2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:40.160]  it until now i'm not paying attention i have everybody on the bill everybody up you know i
[2:11:40.160 --> 2:11:45.200]  mean i mean they try every intellectual uh dishonest trick the people that are trying
[2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:49.040]  to counter us when i'm just saying hey man this is the new world order group this is the
[2:11:49.040 --> 2:11:54.160]  theosophic group and they have the christ of the theosophic group in their film that that's
[2:11:54.720 --> 2:12:01.040]  what they're saying this has always been that new order technocratic religion you know where they
[2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:05.200]  set up communism and then dangle pictures of high-tech cities in front of you i mean that's the old
[2:12:05.200 --> 2:12:09.920]  trick a hundred years ago and they're doing the same trick again and i'm just going i'm not you
[2:12:09.920 --> 2:12:14.240]  know i'm going my god i know history i've seen this a million times are like no it's new it's
[2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:20.560]  revolutionary you can't even grasp it and uh... you know man is you know going to quit wanting
[2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:24.240]  his neighbor's wife and and and and people are going to want bigger better houses and said
[2:12:24.240 --> 2:12:28.240]  well can i have a house in this future system he goes you will have a place where you can go to
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:32.720]  for privacy well will i be able to have a gun well i don't see why you're going to need a gun
[2:12:33.440 --> 2:12:37.280]  you know there's going to be all this great peace and then we'll have the everything will be
[2:12:37.280 --> 2:12:41.280]  according to the load of the earth well who's going to decide that and that's all the theosophic
[2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:48.480]  system man i tell you bernie's this is amazing yeah you know i was very wary with the original
[2:12:48.480 --> 2:12:53.040]  releases like i thought it was uh... you know well-produced uh... excellently done i had a lot
[2:12:53.040 --> 2:12:58.480]  of questions i actually interviewed peter joseph probably two and a half years ago and you know
[2:12:58.480 --> 2:13:03.120]  looking back on it if you check it out on youtube when i asked him well how do you feel about people
[2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:08.800]  interpreting this is kind of new a g and futuristic and kind of one world he got very defensive on
[2:13:08.800 --> 2:13:13.840]  that he was like well what's wrong with that and you know i countered it by saying well a lot of
[2:13:13.840 --> 2:13:19.600]  the proponents of that don't seem to have this great utopian vision for the common man it seems
[2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:24.800]  like that utopian vision is for the upper echelon while the rest of us are pretty much drugged
[2:13:24.800 --> 2:13:31.440]  and enslaved alex i i mean you know hello that's the key what you just hit on the you know this
[2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:36.320]  zeitgeist illuminati the view is for the general slaves you won't work anymore it's going to be
[2:13:36.320 --> 2:13:40.960]  heavenly the machines will run it all that's always what they put out for the general public
[2:13:40.960 --> 2:13:45.920]  last hundred and fifty years but for the elite and the real u n policy documents and the the
[2:13:45.920 --> 2:13:52.960]  theosophic society it's exterminating the majority of us and alice bailey and then after that uh uh uh
[2:13:52.960 --> 2:13:56.800]  barbara marx hubbard saying you know we're the pale horse death we're going to slaughter the
[2:13:56.800 --> 2:14:03.360]  majority of people every christian must be killed because their backward system keeps the consciousness
[2:14:03.360 --> 2:14:09.280]  from rising and keeps and and so i'm like having him on we know where the secular show going well
[2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:13.440]  you know what about this and that all your christianity well i'm not talking about christianity
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:17.760]  christians christians christians and other religious people it's all made up it's not science
[2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:22.560]  meanwhile did you hear about the theosophic society christ and the wonderfulness that's coming
[2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:27.040]  you know and i'm like i mean this is this is this is colt land i mean that's what this is
[2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:32.720]  yeah and i gotta say alex you know like you stated before i'm not the most religious guy out there
[2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:37.680]  but you have to be give some kind of credence to religion when the upper echelon are out there
[2:14:37.680 --> 2:14:43.680]  doing pagan rituals in the woods of uh... california and sonoma uh... for two weeks out
[2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:49.040]  of the year but more than that the locals protested me in a bunch of newspapers in the sonoma
[2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:53.680]  free press and the rest of it because i covered the rituals they got real mad about that and then
[2:14:53.680 --> 2:14:59.200]  we showed up and they were doing rituals the very point is they always claim their atheists
[2:14:59.200 --> 2:15:04.160]  that's their cover to discredit the existing system because they have to get rid of the old
[2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:09.440]  before they bring in the new that is really the ancient i'm with you alex and you know thank god
[2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:14.640]  for people like yourself that continue to expose this system and you know i do what i can i was

[2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:23.280]  uh... you know the election but yeah this is like i said and i'm hoping it won't take off as big as
[2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:28.080]  like i you know we are giving it a lot of uh... press but that's because you know a lot of people
[2:15:28.080 --> 2:15:32.240]  are coming to us with this stuff you know we're getting emails well here's the deal exactly

[2:18:21.520 --> 2:18:29.280]  there i came back uh... and uh... in nineteen seventy and in nineteen seventy two i decided
[2:18:29.280 --> 2:18:33.520]  to run for sheriff and that was the first year that eighteen year olds voted and i was running
[2:18:33.520 --> 2:18:39.760]  against uh... a good sheriff uh... he'd been in office twenty years and i was successful in
[2:18:39.760 --> 2:18:46.800]  defeating him sir four years was re-elected four years that i was defeated by a local police officer
[2:18:46.800 --> 2:18:52.960]  sheriff doin bailey so uh... but i've seen a lot of things that uh... some good things have
[2:18:52.960 --> 2:18:58.400]  happened since then but there's a lot of things that that i don't like and uh... i want to do

[2:19:15.040 --> 2:19:20.240]  is and we are seeing some other police chiefs and sheriff now restrict or band tasers some of the
[2:19:20.240 --> 2:19:25.280]  things you're calling for uh... so we'll be discussing that all when we get back on the other side

[2:23:53.520 --> 2:23:59.680]  going to do and change here in travis county if you get elected well the main reason i'm running
[2:23:59.680 --> 2:24:07.760]  for sheriff because he's so extravagant in his budget and i i call it predatory projections
[2:24:07.760 --> 2:24:14.560]  that he makes at his budget and this in turn provided him access to more money and personnel
[2:24:14.560 --> 2:24:21.200]  from the county commissioners for instance he says he'll give 249 tickets a day to meet his yearly
[2:24:21.200 --> 2:24:26.880]  projection 249 tickets a day that's a lot of tickets you know how long it takes to ride a ticket
[2:24:27.920 --> 2:24:34.560]  during that same time he'll work 22 accidents a day that takes at least an hour tying up two
[2:24:34.560 --> 2:24:44.480]  units then the big thing is calls for service 360 calls per service for 24 hours a day to meet his
[2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:49.920]  yearly projection and that's why i'm calling them predatory projections well the bottom line
[2:24:49.920 --> 2:24:54.080]  in the past that a car got robbed or a house got broke into the police or sheriffs would show up
[2:24:54.080 --> 2:24:57.040]  now all over the country they're saying we're just not going to show up most of the time
[2:24:57.040 --> 2:25:02.560]  we're too busy writing tickets that's exactly right and they have in their budget right now
[2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:09.920]  over $200,000 in performance pay and what that is is it goes for people to do an outstanding
[2:25:09.920 --> 2:25:15.440]  job writing tickets but there's still a lot of that money appropriated in the corrections area
[2:25:15.440 --> 2:25:19.040]  so i don't know exactly that's distributed what would you do with illegal aliens because you
[2:25:19.040 --> 2:25:24.240]  know this is a sanctuary city and county and they're above citizens they get to drink and drive
[2:25:24.240 --> 2:25:29.680]  not have id not have insurance a citizen literally just gets clobbered if they have a crooked
[2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:36.240]  toenail but illegal aliens can do whatever they want well for immigrants that do not have documents
[2:25:36.240 --> 2:25:41.600]  so i don't know what i do i i mean i'll i'll you know i'll tell you if they're put in jail by
[2:25:41.600 --> 2:25:45.600]  people we're not going to look for them my department's not going to look for them but if
[2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:52.400]  that we will have them in jail and and take care of them but we will not allow an ice agent to have
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:57.200]  an office in the travis county jail there's ice is part of part of homeland security and then
[2:25:57.200 --> 2:26:02.720]  that federalizes the department that's right and once they get their foot in the door you know
[2:26:02.720 --> 2:26:07.360]  they'll want to know i understand all that but i mean well but why do i get arrested if i don't
[2:26:07.360 --> 2:26:13.360]  in my if i don't have an id but uh but a lord doesn't i don't know that i will i will fight
[2:26:13.360 --> 2:26:17.760]  against it whatever whenever i have a chance in speaking i mean i'd be glad to let them let me
[2:26:17.760 --> 2:26:21.680]  drive without a license or insurance i think it's a free market sue somebody to hurt you the point
[2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:26.000]  is i'm tired of all this socialism the point is i don't like illegal aliens being having more rights
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:33.280]  than i do well that's not right i know they do and uh it should change a lot of those undocumented
[2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:39.280]  aliens are going back to mexico yeah because they can't make a living here anymore that's right the
[2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:44.240]  globalists have sucked the country dry sheriff you talk about decriminalizing marijuana tell us about
[2:26:44.240 --> 2:26:53.520]  that yeah well right now the class B misdemeanor two ounces or more it's 180 days in jail and a
[2:26:53.520 --> 2:27:00.160]  $2,000 fine and i want to lower that to a misdemeanor which would be a $500 fine and that is decriminalization
[2:27:00.160 --> 2:27:05.600]  of marijuana i don't advocate the use of it i'm just saying that i want to do that too i don't
[2:27:05.600 --> 2:27:09.680]  either you can hardly hire good employees because they're also stoned in austin but the point is is
[2:27:09.680 --> 2:27:14.640]  that uh if they got all these ads saying marijuana is terrorism marijuana has no connection to
[2:27:14.640 --> 2:27:19.840]  terrorism like cocaine and heroin yeah it has no connection to funding terrorism uh and uh
[2:27:19.840 --> 2:27:25.440]  it and 87 percent of illegal drug users only use marijuana and i don't think it's as bad as alcohol
[2:27:25.440 --> 2:27:29.360]  i mean i'd be against people stumbling around drunk on the job too yeah the problem is just
[2:27:29.360 --> 2:27:33.520]  all the potheds but yeah i mean i don't even like potheds but the point is you're right and you
[2:27:33.520 --> 2:27:39.280]  shouldn't be thrown in prison no there's no no place for them in prison now the austin police
[2:27:39.280 --> 2:27:44.400]  department if they could pick up somebody with a small amount of marijuana they'll give a citation
[2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:49.200]  but that's not what the law says if they want to do it i think that's their policy
[2:27:49.840 --> 2:27:54.400]  and uh i don't know what the sheriff department does i'm not familiar with what they do when
[2:27:54.400 --> 2:27:59.040]  they pick somebody up they probably comply with the law but you're saying that you're going to
[2:27:59.040 --> 2:28:06.400]  uh decriminalize that's right i i did that in 72 i appeared before the uh no 73 when the
[2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:11.840]  legislature met that's one of my first year in office the the senator in charge of the uh
[2:28:12.480 --> 2:28:18.320]  jurisprudence committee was charles herring a senator from austin texas and i advocated the
[2:28:18.320 --> 2:28:24.560]  decriminalization then of marijuana and uh see in those days you could get 10 years in the state
[2:28:24.560 --> 2:28:29.760]  penitentiary for having a cigarette 10 years now travis county didn't send them down there but
[2:28:29.760 --> 2:28:37.360]  but the so-called redneck counties did and uh now my mom talked about in college if anybody had
[2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:41.760]  long hair in the car they'd pull you over and just tear your car apart and they found any
[2:28:41.760 --> 2:28:46.560]  marijuana people go to prison but if you were wearing football jerseys and had short hair
[2:28:46.560 --> 2:28:50.640]  you could be as drunk as you wanted riding around shooting shooting signs with shotguns and they
[2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:56.640]  just smile at you it's not right i know that happens i'd stay there long statement coming up
[2:28:56.640 --> 2:29:01.520]  plenty of time to get into tasers and a lot more and your website folks donate to him getting involved
[2:29:01.520 --> 2:29:05.600]  there's a lot of election fraud in travis county but if there's a huge turnout for ramon franks they
[2:29:05.600 --> 2:29:10.000]  may not be able to cover that up and you know he's a great guy i can't think of having a better
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:15.360]  sheriff uh than uh ramon franks and he's somebody we really need her in travis county stay with us

[2:33:07.040 --> 2:33:12.080]  sheriff's departments when the sheriff's departments of the county uh that is commissioned and
[2:33:12.080 --> 2:33:16.560]  empowered by state law and by the state and by the legislature and then by the people that
[2:33:16.560 --> 2:33:20.960]  elect him at the county so that is above the city that's an incorporated private corporation

[2:33:55.760 --> 2:34:00.400]  why don't you educate the public about this this is one way to hold back the tyranny going back to
[2:34:00.400 --> 2:34:04.720]  sheriff raymond frank uh tasers you're saying you're going to ban them for use in the sheriff's
[2:34:04.720 --> 2:34:11.440]  department absolutely no place for it's a torturous weapon no place for it in my department
[2:34:11.440 --> 2:34:16.880]  and how did you come upon that uh understanding that realization well i've done a lot of study in
[2:34:16.880 --> 2:34:24.000]  the military won't use it and uh and they give a reason why and it's it's it's based upon torture
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:30.160]  and i'm against torture of any type and uh i decided that that's the way it's going to be over
[2:34:30.160 --> 2:34:36.080]  three hundred and ten people have died in canada and the united states as a result of tasering
[2:34:36.080 --> 2:34:41.440]  now by the way that's a conservative number well that's what that's what's been commonly reported in
[2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:47.680]  the newspapers uh two hundred ninety in america and uh i'm not saying that the taser itself killed
[2:34:47.680 --> 2:34:55.600]  the guy but but the response later he died from it so maybe they fell for balcony or something
[2:34:55.600 --> 2:35:01.840]  like well there been a bunch of uh coroners and and and uh cardiologists have said it is killing
[2:35:01.840 --> 2:35:07.280]  people so well yeah well i i i believe it by the way they're boosting them from fifty thousand
[2:35:07.280 --> 2:35:12.800]  watts to seventy five thousand watts yeah i know that at the at the cal palace in san francisco
[2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:18.400]  they had one on display it attracted a lot of attention well i mean this is intimidation too

[2:35:23.440 --> 2:35:28.560]  you know electric shock systems used here and that's all part of ten these are cattle prods
[2:35:28.560 --> 2:35:33.280]  yeah that's it's horrible and now i understand they have bracelets that will fit on you that
[2:35:33.280 --> 2:35:36.800]  they can apply they want them to homeland security wants to make it an olem security did say they
[2:35:36.800 --> 2:35:42.640]  want it to make everybody who flies wear a taser bracelet yeah that's horrible i mean who can come

[2:35:49.840 --> 2:35:54.240]  what i can i saw you have an article about those types that are fired out of 12 gauges too that's
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:36:01.120]  right it'll go 100 feet where is that article i want to show people it'll go 100 feet no this is
[2:36:01.120 --> 2:36:07.520]  that's the guy in new york that uh recently a guy from new york was on a balcony uh obviously a mental
[2:36:07.520 --> 2:36:12.080]  health patient of to some type and they have decided to go ahead and taser him and he fell
[2:36:12.720 --> 2:36:19.040]  10 or 12 feet to the concrete uh and died in a hospital an hour later and the sad thing was that
[2:36:19.040 --> 2:36:24.800]  the man that shot him with a taser the police officer took his own life a couple days later
[2:36:24.800 --> 2:36:30.080]  that was reported on nbc news yeah he was one that ordered them to shoot him uh just just you
[2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:34.000]  know just a terrible situation and we've also seen the culture shift from the police and the
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:37.680]  sheriff's deputy's been guarding into the people and being liked you know by and large we're still
[2:36:37.680 --> 2:36:42.800]  some bad apples to now it really is us against them mentality how are they indoctrinating that into
[2:36:42.800 --> 2:36:49.360]  the police i don't know for sure i'm i'm real anxious to find out what's going on in the
[2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:54.800]  sheriff's department academy what they teach do they teach anything about ethics for that's very
[2:36:54.800 --> 2:37:00.320]  important to me because of what happened in the sheriff's department recently where a guy was paying
[2:37:00.320 --> 2:37:07.280]  a man $10,000 if he would retire early so he could get promoted that made the paper for a couple
[2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:13.280]  days those are you know they're they're taking advantage of the public trust and that's not right
[2:37:14.960 --> 2:37:18.880]  amazing i want to bring red beckman up and we'll have plenty of time to get more into what you'll
[2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:24.160]  do a sheriff if you get elected again you were in right years previously uh but not an office for a
[2:37:24.160 --> 2:37:28.880]  while red beckman i wanted to get you on to comment on the important role of good sheriffs and the
[2:37:28.880 --> 2:37:36.320]  true power that sheriffs have as being the most you know powerful elected guardian of the people
[2:37:36.320 --> 2:37:43.280]  in a county and the move we're seeing to disarm them to geld the sheriff's departments red beckman
[2:37:43.280 --> 2:37:49.120]  welcome good to have a good to be with you again well we got a great guy on the line red beckman
[2:37:49.120 --> 2:37:53.520]  another great gentleman here with us raymond frank uh what do you think so far you're hearing
[2:37:53.520 --> 2:38:03.120]  about this man well uh you know our county sheriffs uh nobody really understands they just
[2:38:03.120 --> 2:38:11.760]  haven't been taught uh that the county sheriff is your best friend in your county uh he was supposed
[2:38:11.760 --> 2:38:20.640]  to be rather than your you know an antagonist or an enemy um they were to look out for the people
[2:38:20.640 --> 2:38:28.240]  and and especially the people that uh are vulnerable uh to the scam artists and all that
[2:38:28.240 --> 2:38:36.880]  type of thing and uh they just don't understand because they were never taught um you know i i
[2:38:36.880 --> 2:38:45.280]  uh was at a meeting a week or so ago and i said uh if i was to put uh in one simple sentence the
[2:38:45.280 --> 2:38:53.280]  problem that we have in this country uh is that we have overdosed on propaganda uh they they feed
[2:38:53.280 --> 2:39:00.720]  us all this stuff calling it education and and it's not an education as propaganda and uh when
[2:39:00.720 --> 2:39:06.160]  they start telling people what the sheriff's position is really all about and how he's supposed
[2:39:06.160 --> 2:39:13.280]  to function that's when you'll see sheriffs that will operate the way they are supposed to uh you
[2:39:13.280 --> 2:39:18.000]  know that we've got people that are in sheriff's office all over this country that don't have a
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:25.600]  clue the the real you know the real principle behind a sheriff system as as we were given back
[2:39:25.600 --> 2:39:35.920]  there a long time ago and uh they just don't know well this ties into the entire system uh you know
[2:39:35.920 --> 2:39:40.560]  of the state uh and its relationship with the federal system how they're gelding and taking
[2:39:40.560 --> 2:39:44.960]  over the sheriffs and turning them into minions of the cities uh that are supposed to be under
[2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:50.640]  them because they're the cities are are creatures of the state and people uh how they're dumbing
[2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:56.480]  up the juries the grand juries all of it how does this tie together red beckman well you see uh
[2:39:58.160 --> 2:40:07.520]  ignorance uh people that don't know the truth are easily manipulated and used and and so truth
[2:40:07.520 --> 2:40:14.080]  has to be um we have to get it out there we have to get it out there to where it's uh available to
[2:40:14.080 --> 2:40:20.560]  people and of course uh the situation we've got right now in this country we've never uh
[2:40:21.280 --> 2:40:26.960]  you know this country has never faced a trauma like we're facing right now this economic thing
[2:40:27.680 --> 2:40:34.320]  uh and and people are listening people are paying attention people are angry and uh
[2:40:34.320 --> 2:40:41.200]  an american he's kind of a strange animal he if he's if he's comfortable and his belly is full
[2:40:41.200 --> 2:40:46.480]  and everything why he doesn't pay that much attention but right now people are very uncomfortable
[2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:52.560]  with what's going on and as a result they're paying attention to what we're saying and so i'm um
[2:40:53.520 --> 2:41:02.320]  well i'm an optimist i always have been and i will be um until the day i die uh because we do have
[2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:10.160]  uh truth that's available and it's um it's available and and people at this point are
[2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:16.160]  ready to learn and so our responsibility is to get the truth out there and let them let
[2:41:16.160 --> 2:41:22.480]  them uh you know hear the truth and and of course this thing with these tasers i'll tell you this
[2:41:22.480 --> 2:41:29.280]  is just uh uh in the gentleman you have they're calling a torture it's absolutely no other word
[2:41:29.280 --> 2:41:36.880]  for it fits it like uh calling it torture and of course uh the founding fathers they insisted
[2:41:36.880 --> 2:41:44.640]  that we not have a standing army in this country well when the feds step in and when they when they
[2:41:44.640 --> 2:41:50.960]  start dictating to the sheriff and the state highway patrol and everybody else you end up you've got
[2:41:50.960 --> 2:42:00.960]  a standing army and uh in in the um the forest service uh we always uh admired the forest service
[2:42:00.960 --> 2:42:08.240]  and and and their uh work with smoky bear and and and this type of thing now they become law
[2:42:08.240 --> 2:42:14.400]  enforcement your your rangers out there in the in the hills are carrying guns the blm people
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:19.600]  they're well the attitude not just of the militarizing and and and and uh you know turning
[2:42:19.600 --> 2:42:23.920]  all these other groups into police and then militarizing and not just militarized police
[2:42:23.920 --> 2:42:29.200]  but militarizing groups that weren't even police previously is that it is an attitude at national
[2:42:29.200 --> 2:42:34.080]  parks and state parks and and and cops all over the country it's rare to have a cop open a door
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:38.720]  for you and smile at you and be nice most time they look at you like you're a pile of steam and
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:43.280]  steam and dog do i'm sorry to talk like that sheriff frank's how did this how did this happen
[2:42:44.240 --> 2:42:48.240]  well i think i think red hit the nail on the head i think some of the sheriffs have been
[2:42:48.240 --> 2:42:54.960]  relaxed of they're they're drawing a pretty darn good salary and they're just let things go for
[2:42:54.960 --> 2:43:02.960]  instance years ago uh under ronnie url and uh judge calbert they tried to rewrite the texas
[2:43:02.960 --> 2:43:08.960]  constitution and in that they left it up to the legislature to decide whether or not a county
[2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:17.120]  would have a sheriff well i was on the committee to fight that and it was defeated and uh if i'm
[2:43:17.120 --> 2:43:21.360]  elected sheriff i want to be back on that committee because i exactly because they're shutting sheriffs
[2:43:21.360 --> 2:43:27.360]  departments down all over the country yeah we're a constitutional office and i want travis county
[2:43:27.360 --> 2:43:32.400]  citizens to me and you have these unconstitutional municipal systems lobbying to get rid of you
[2:43:33.040 --> 2:43:39.040]  yeah i know or absorb you i want the citizens to realize that i look at them as as my family
[2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:44.720]  they're the ones that give the 118 million dollars for the travis county sheriff's department i don't
[2:43:44.720 --> 2:43:50.240]  want my department to look at the people travis county is the enemy or food there there are friends
[2:43:50.240 --> 2:43:56.320]  and i mean we're now seeing this food and i'm going to make a lot of changes we're going to order
[2:43:57.200 --> 2:44:03.200]  for instance m re's and and have a big stock of those because i know things are going to happen
[2:44:03.200 --> 2:44:08.160]  in this county and in america in the next couple years it's going to be real bad i mean regardless
[2:44:08.160 --> 2:44:12.400]  of whether it's going to happen or not every county should be prepared its its own self to help the
[2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:18.560]  public not always wait on fema and the feds yeah not now i think it looks to me like the
[2:44:18.560 --> 2:44:24.160]  department is just looking who they can give a ticket to for instance the bottom the hill where
[2:44:24.160 --> 2:44:30.720]  i live i see a patrolman there using a speed gun but they never come up on the street where i live
[2:44:30.720 --> 2:44:35.600]  well they did the other day because my neighbor's house alarm went off but i don't like that but
[2:44:35.600 --> 2:44:42.480]  we're going to serve the entire county and we're going to put speed traps and speeders on the back
[2:44:42.480 --> 2:44:51.280]  burner may i interject something yes um i had to make a run into town this morning and get a
[2:44:51.280 --> 2:44:58.240]  haircut and the barber was telling me about how he said uh you have to be real careful right now
[2:44:58.240 --> 2:45:06.240]  he said uh the city cops and the highway patrol are out just handing out tickets wholesale
[2:45:06.240 --> 2:45:16.000]  uh they must be running low on revenue and um i i said well they are because you see is the stock
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:25.360]  market goes down uh you know there are some that say that as much as 65 percent of the risk capital
[2:45:25.360 --> 2:45:30.240]  that's your capital in in wall street the stock market our county cities water district school
[2:45:30.240 --> 2:45:38.400]  district they've all ended in the police yeah and you see uh these uh investors these uh
[2:45:38.400 --> 2:45:45.200]  government entities um they didn't they didn't want to cut the price of fuel they wanted exxon to
[2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:54.560]  have uh their uh 10 billion dollar profit every three months or so uh because they were uh well
[2:45:54.560 --> 2:46:01.680]  they tell us that exxon is 72 percent of the stock in exxon is owned by government entities
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:10.560]  even your local school boards and your uh your uh oh your different boards uh every county has
[2:46:10.560 --> 2:46:16.080]  got them planning boards always they've all that was the comprehensive annual financial reports
[2:46:16.080 --> 2:46:20.000]  and now with all these unfunded mandates and the rest of everything's going bankrupt
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:23.920]  and believe me folks now that you don't have jobs they're going to squeeze you even tighter
[2:46:23.920 --> 2:46:27.920]  but i mean at a certain point it's going to implode i mean how are cops going to squeeze
[2:46:27.920 --> 2:46:32.320]  blood out of a stone yes uh share Frank's i mean how is that going to happen as the economy gets
[2:46:32.320 --> 2:46:36.720]  worse it's it's going to be real serious and it's it's going to be up to a good sheriff to
[2:46:37.360 --> 2:46:43.200]  take care of his people and not take advantage of uh you know giving excessive number of tickets
[2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:47.360]  and things like that and concentrate on protecting our families well i mean here's my question
[2:46:48.560 --> 2:46:52.640]  i had my car broken into a more than a decade ago everything's stolen you know the stereo
[2:46:52.640 --> 2:47:00.240]  stuff like that police wouldn't come out i was in Dallas years ago uh my car got stolen cops
[2:47:00.240 --> 2:47:04.080]  laughed at me so we can't help you i hung up and they showed up mad saying you don't hang up till
[2:47:04.080 --> 2:47:09.040]  we give you permission to hang up on 911 and then i've read all these articles around the country
[2:47:09.600 --> 2:47:13.440]  where the police are now saying we're not even going to come to basic home invasions and basic
[2:47:13.440 --> 2:47:17.440]  robberies now but we're going to be out there focusing on writing tickets to raise revenue
[2:47:17.440 --> 2:47:21.040]  that that's a serious crime now now they've said police aren't there to protect you they have no
[2:47:21.040 --> 2:47:26.320]  liability to do it but but still that's the overall uh you know idea they're putting out
[2:47:26.320 --> 2:47:32.080]  your comments on that sheriff uh frankson then uh red buckman the other day when i was campaigning
[2:47:32.080 --> 2:47:37.200]  a young man that lives in manor texas called the sheriff's office for assistance some problem
[2:47:37.200 --> 2:47:41.520]  that wasn't a real major problem but it was a problem to him and should have been dealt with
[2:47:41.520 --> 2:47:47.840]  by the county and uh they told him now we don't have time to fool with that i can't believe that
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:52.560]  that the sheriff would allow his people to take that kind of an attitude and have that type of
[2:47:52.560 --> 2:47:56.960]  a pause well also 911 times have gone from six minutes to eight minutes to ten minutes to
[2:47:56.960 --> 2:48:02.320]  twelve minutes the national average just saw it last week 14 and a half minutes but the government
[2:48:02.320 --> 2:48:07.600]  wants our guns but then says the cops will be there in 14 minutes yeah let me tell you something
[2:48:07.600 --> 2:48:13.120]  else in the budget in this past budget that ended september 30th the sheriff's department
[2:48:13.120 --> 2:48:20.880]  purchased 79 new patrol cars crowned victorias v eights and got 25 additional personnel for their
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:27.840]  law enforcement bureau i don't know what the bureau is but uh uh those that equipment and personnel
[2:48:27.840 --> 2:48:32.240]  are used to write tickets that's primarily what they do because there's portions of county
[2:48:32.240 --> 2:48:37.760]  travis county is not protected by the sheriff's office they have allowed the constables to take
[2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:43.600]  over at least two areas and in other words those citizens have to pay the constable for protection
[2:48:43.600 --> 2:48:48.800]  and they're already county taxpayers they're entitled to protect most of the money's taken
[2:48:48.800 --> 2:48:52.320]  and invested in the stock market which by the way police you're never going to see in your pension
[2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:56.080]  it's never coming it's over the globalists are stealing it all right now and i told you 10 years
[2:48:56.080 --> 2:48:59.520]  ago it would happen and you laugh you're going to find out how much your new order loves you
[2:48:59.520 --> 2:49:06.240]  what about this red beckman uh came out yesterday that 34 percent of all the police in Atlanta
[2:49:06.240 --> 2:49:12.400]  are violent felons or violent criminals i mean assaults beaten their wives before their cops
[2:49:13.360 --> 2:49:18.480]  stealing uh... you know grand theft auto and and the uh... police department said well we've
[2:49:18.480 --> 2:49:24.480]  got to expand and we just can't get anybody but criminals i mean they're actually hiring felons
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:31.200]  just like the army comments red beckman well that that doesn't surprise me about atlanta
[2:49:31.200 --> 2:49:38.640]  uh... because uh... they say they can't get anybody well uh... big cities such as atlanta
[2:49:39.040 --> 2:49:46.960]  uh... they have uh... you know they molly called uh... the criminals and such for so long and and uh
[2:49:47.600 --> 2:49:53.120]  uh... well it's not just there it's uh... in the uh... community where i'm at here
[2:49:53.680 --> 2:49:59.200]  in the state of washington uh forty to fifty thousand people here in a matter of 25 or 30
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:06.000]  miles that's not very many people but uh... they have all of these people running around
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:13.920]  that uh... make a living off of crime and uh... they should be uh... locked up or something
[2:50:13.920 --> 2:50:21.520]  there has to be something done uh... to you know to stop this crime wave but they don't they get
[2:50:21.520 --> 2:50:26.080]  exactly they leave the criminals alone and the illegal aliens alone they just squeeze the
[2:50:26.080 --> 2:50:29.440]  soccer mama went five miles over the speed limit we'll be right back

[2:54:05.600 --> 2:54:11.760]  years ago learning in uh army press releases and in industry publications about how they were
[2:54:11.760 --> 2:54:16.160]  hiring felons and aggravated felons and illegal aliens for the military and i would read those
[2:54:16.160 --> 2:54:20.080]  documents on air people wouldn't believe me now for about five years they admit the biggest army
[2:54:20.080 --> 2:54:24.160]  recruiting centers in mexico city the second largest in manila philippines third largest in
[2:54:24.160 --> 2:54:29.040]  the ukraine uh they're converting our military over to foreigners but also aggravated felons
[2:54:29.040 --> 2:54:35.360]  who are foreigners and aggravated felons out of prison here in the us stalin hitler did that uh i
[2:54:35.360 --> 2:54:41.840]  want to get your take on that and then get sheriff's frank's take on it well i yeah you know they
[2:54:41.840 --> 2:54:51.040]  make a big thing out of this terrorism um you know terrorism it doesn't rear its ugly head unless you
[2:54:51.040 --> 2:55:03.680]  have government that has become uh a tyranny a government that uh is um um you know almighty
[2:55:03.680 --> 2:55:14.960]  and uh you see a government that is um a tyranny uh you end up with people that get hammered and
[2:55:14.960 --> 2:55:20.560]  they get hurt they get damaged and they reach a point where they have nothing to lose and the
[2:55:20.560 --> 2:55:29.200]  only weapon they have is whatever they can devise by their their you know their innovations and
[2:55:29.200 --> 2:55:39.680]  this type of thing uh you don't have terrorism unless you have a terrorist government a government
[2:55:39.680 --> 2:55:48.480]  that's that's involved in terrorism will end up with terrorists you know in a in a war of against
[2:55:48.480 --> 2:55:52.480]  terrorists but not just that we also have the manufacturing terrorism as a pretext to crack
[2:55:52.480 --> 2:55:59.920]  down on the population sheriff frank um specifically uh in your sheriff's department if you find out
[2:55:59.920 --> 2:56:04.240]  they've hired criminals are you going to get rid of them i'm sure going to try i know the
[2:56:04.240 --> 2:56:10.800]  share i know the sheriff's department is a civil service so operated but uh with the i don't want
[2:56:10.800 --> 2:56:14.960]  convicted i don't want any criminals working for me because i want to maintain the highest
[2:56:14.960 --> 2:56:20.320]  of ethical standards can you believe we would have to discuss i mean my question read and and
[2:56:20.320 --> 2:56:25.040]  share a frank one that when the government starts hiring criminals you know it's an it's an evil
[2:56:25.040 --> 2:56:31.520]  government absolutely it's it's incomprehensible to think that we hire such people especially
[2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:37.840]  in the military and so forth it's it's ridiculous well that's a big red flag isn't it red to have
[2:56:37.840 --> 2:56:44.400]  absolutely absolutely and of course um i'm old enough to where i've seen the progression
[2:56:44.400 --> 2:56:54.080]  uh over the years and um you know i remember what this country was uh you know i i compare
[2:56:54.080 --> 2:57:00.960]  what's happening today with what happened in the 1930s with the depression and and you know people
[2:57:00.960 --> 2:57:09.360]  helped each other um people looked out for each other uh and i can see this thing coming now
[2:57:09.360 --> 2:57:15.680]  and and people are going to keep their doors locked they're not uh uh you know they're going to be
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:22.720]  looking inward rather than outward and uh it's not i mean the picture is going to get real ugly
[2:57:22.720 --> 2:57:30.080]  because um the you know they talk about a 1930s depression we aren't going to have a 1930s
[2:57:30.080 --> 2:57:36.560]  depression it's going to be so much worse than the 1930s that there won't won't be any comparison
[2:57:36.560 --> 2:57:41.280]  whatever and on top of it we're going to have militarized police running around squeezing people
[2:57:41.280 --> 2:57:48.720]  absolutely and well terrorizing and and and the result is going to be terrorism coming back on
[2:57:48.720 --> 2:57:53.600]  them and you mean real not even i agree not even manufactured i wouldn't call it terrorism you're

[3:08:15.520 --> 3:08:21.360]  know willy and then you were telling me that uh was uh one of his family members was uh one of

[3:08:30.000 --> 3:08:36.160]  cool to be a friend in fact it was kind of derogatory so uh what back with his irs trouble and all
[3:08:36.160 --> 3:08:41.200]  way back and well even before that i'm talking about the 70s early seven how was that derogatory
[3:08:41.200 --> 3:08:47.680]  yeah well because you know he was considered sort of an outlaw or radical radical and everything
[3:08:47.680 --> 3:08:53.200]  but his nephew was my deputy and when he was the finest deputy i ever had and he died accidentally
[3:08:53.200 --> 3:09:00.880]  in a in a car accident and uh randy flexor was his name and uh his mother plays piano bobby
[3:09:00.880 --> 3:09:08.160]  plays piano for willy and she's a friend of mine and by the way willies has has played three times
[3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:14.000]  i think before the fundraisers for me when i ran for sheriff and he's for me i can tell you that

[3:09:21.680 --> 3:09:26.400]  at the last event at the backyard for they move into a bigger venue but you know the amazing
[3:09:26.400 --> 3:09:32.160]  about him is you know he's putting out similar uh water from air things as we are but he literally
[3:09:32.160 --> 3:09:36.240]  just put his name on it because he wants to do something real environmental so we have to have
[3:09:36.240 --> 3:09:40.240]  all this you know bottled water uh and i mean he's literally it was in the states when he's
[3:09:40.240 --> 3:09:44.880]  literally doing that with really no profit for himself just to get that idea out just like he
[3:09:44.880 --> 3:09:49.360]  did biodiesel uh just like he said so many other i mean he really is a good guy i mean i mean i mean
[3:09:49.360 --> 3:09:55.280]  he really does care and that's neat that you've known him so long yeah well you know one time
[3:09:55.280 --> 3:10:00.880]  somebody walked in his trailer at a concert and and uh and he said well what is that stuff i smell
[3:10:01.680 --> 3:10:08.880]  and um willie said you don't you don't smell anything so you know i guess the guy was suggesting
[3:10:08.880 --> 3:10:13.360]  willie had used some air water or something but uh i don't smell it and you don't either
[3:10:13.360 --> 3:10:19.760]  so he's quite a guy so so what'd you do in that movie with uh willie well we were in the uh
[3:10:20.720 --> 3:10:26.320]  randy the phone the kid that was killed we were in a up at briar cliff in this thing and and they
[3:10:26.320 --> 3:10:33.040]  had just driven up from mexico in the bus and uh randy flexor said i hope neither you were driving
[3:10:33.040 --> 3:10:39.280]  at each point of the finger at each other but i was in that scene and got to meet uh willie again
[3:10:39.280 --> 3:10:46.240]  and also slim pecans and uh that was a great experience and then also we we we also fell
[3:10:46.240 --> 3:10:53.520]  in the scene down by the bridge there on on 360 and uh that was that was interesting too so uh
[3:10:54.080 --> 3:10:58.960]  i'm proud to be a friend of willie nelson and i appreciate all the all the causes that he's
[3:10:58.960 --> 3:11:05.840]  involved in and so forth and it's just tremendous now he's a neat guy um okay he's been back in
[3:11:05.840 --> 3:11:10.400]  austin the last few weeks we just went back on tour today let's go to uh jack mclem officer jack
[3:11:10.400 --> 3:11:15.440]  mclem i wanted to have you on jack because ramon frank's a great guy he's anti new world order
[3:11:15.440 --> 3:11:19.040]  and so much has happened also we're talking about all the martial law developments we've been seeing
[3:11:19.040 --> 3:11:23.520]  yeah i mean everything we've talked about is now coming true but it's such old hat to us
[3:11:23.520 --> 3:11:28.160]  a lot of us i think myself included aren't even responding as vehemently and as seriously as we
[3:11:28.160 --> 3:11:32.000]  should because it's new to the public and they're now freaking out it's all over the news as the
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:36.080]  news introduces it to people and glenn beckon reduces it to the public uh but you know for a
[3:11:36.080 --> 3:11:40.560]  lot of us that have been saying you know seeing it being engineered for so long uh you know we're
[3:11:40.560 --> 3:11:45.440]  kind of like in a way sitting back uh i think that's a dangerous psychological development
[3:11:45.440 --> 3:11:49.680]  but it's when we have to be honest about jack mclem good to have you here with us good to be with
[3:11:49.680 --> 3:11:58.400]  you brother rick really are uh alex very good to be with you today and good to be on with uh
[3:11:58.400 --> 3:12:04.240]  uh chair frank thank you chair frank for your service to the public well i i have a lot of
[3:12:04.240 --> 3:12:10.160]  respect for you jack and uh listen to your program all the time on on radio that's right it's on
[3:12:10.160 --> 3:12:15.760]  it's on here locally on 90.1 oh yeah of sure frank is a total anti-new world order i mean you've
[3:12:15.760 --> 3:12:20.320]  always been pro-liberty but but sure frank ramon frank when did you and we'll go back to jack in
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:25.840]  a second but that's a good question when did you first wake up to the new world order probably in
[3:12:25.840 --> 3:12:35.280]  1972 when i uh a friend of mine in the air force envisioned what things are going to happen and at
[3:12:35.280 --> 3:12:42.400]  that time i made some investments that uh and i'm glad that i did that because uh those investments
[3:12:42.400 --> 3:12:48.800]  are now safe from confiscation by some of these crooked people that run the banks and so forth
[3:12:48.800 --> 3:12:52.080]  that's right you were saying you knew all this was coming you bought a bunch of silver in the
[3:12:52.080 --> 3:12:59.360]  70s sure did for real like a buck and a half an ounce and now it's up to 20 and it's probably
[3:12:59.360 --> 3:13:03.840]  going to go to 100 in the next couple years i don't think there's any doubt about it absolutely
[3:13:05.040 --> 3:13:09.120]  jack mclem i want to get into the bigger picture of marsh along the new world order but how important
[3:13:09.120 --> 3:13:14.000]  is it to have the people take their counties back with the sheriffs and put the sheriff back in
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:19.680]  their dominant role as the most highly uh you know powerful um elected representative instead
[3:13:19.680 --> 3:13:23.840]  of the states and the counties and the cities trying to get rid of sheriffs why is the establishment
[3:13:23.840 --> 3:13:30.080]  of front of sheriffs yes it's so important brother because the sheriff is truly the chief
[3:13:30.080 --> 3:13:39.280]  executive officer in the county and sadly many of the sheriffs don't know that and so they in many
[3:13:39.280 --> 3:13:46.800]  of the eastern states today they've been relegated to just process servers not law enforcement anymore
[3:13:46.800 --> 3:13:54.000]  the state police the local police and the federal feds come in and handle the law enforcement and
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:14:02.400]  they've relegated the sheriffs to positions of process servers and also uh in many of the states
[3:14:02.400 --> 3:14:10.560]  back east they uh they don't elect the sheriff anymore they're appointed by the county administrators
[3:14:10.560 --> 3:14:16.000]  or state administrators and so the sad turn of events yeah they've never seen law enforcement
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:21.280]  they don't love but the one area of peace officers known as law enforcement where it's for the people
[3:14:21.280 --> 3:14:27.360]  has the real power they're getting rid of that because they know that's right very very true
[3:14:27.360 --> 3:14:34.800]  and uh attorney general for the state of washington here a few years back said this the office of
[3:14:34.800 --> 3:14:40.880]  sheriff is one of the oldest offices known to the common law jurisprudence a clear statement of the
[3:14:40.880 --> 3:14:47.120]  significance of the office of sheriff within the county both historically and under present
[3:14:47.120 --> 3:14:54.480]  statutes is found in anderson on sheriffs corners and camp constables page six and it says in there
[3:14:54.480 --> 3:15:01.120]  in the exercise of executive and administrative functions in conserving the public peace in
[3:15:01.120 --> 3:15:07.440]  vindicating the law and in preserving the rights of the government he the sheriff represents the
[3:15:07.440 --> 3:15:14.960]  sovereignty of the state and he has no superior in the county and i wish we're working hard here
[3:15:14.960 --> 3:15:20.480]  at a debate police military newsletter to try to get our sheriff's video out and our sheriff's
[3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:25.680]  newsletter out to all the sheriffs around the nation so that they'll realize that they have
[3:15:25.680 --> 3:15:31.760]  great jurisdiction and great power and they do not have to listen to the federal authorities
[3:15:31.760 --> 3:15:37.360]  that come into their county well jack as a sheriff in the 70s ramon frank on the front lines
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:40.880]  when they were just starting to try to get rid of sheriffs he went to the legislature when
[3:15:40.880 --> 3:15:45.600]  they were about to basically disband them or make them appointed and and and sheriff frank
[3:15:45.600 --> 3:15:50.080]  helped stop that so he's he's kind of a unsung great granddaddy in this fight tell us about
[3:15:50.080 --> 3:15:57.840]  testify before the legislature well yeah and uh somehow our district attorney and and and
[3:15:57.840 --> 3:16:05.200]  a pretty well-known judge uh was on a committee to rewrite the constitution and of course my
[3:16:05.200 --> 3:16:10.640]  office is a constitutional office which i'm very proud of and one of the things they did was uh
[3:16:11.840 --> 3:16:19.280]  deal away with the sheriff and allow the legislature to provide uh the okay for counties to have a
[3:16:19.280 --> 3:16:25.360]  sheriff that if they needed one well we fought that and it was defeated and uh and i'm going to be on
[3:16:25.360 --> 3:16:31.280]  the alert for for that you know because it it'll probably come up again sometime oh yes it sure
[3:16:31.280 --> 3:16:36.800]  will brother thank you so much for that sheriff frank thank you so much you're welcome yes uh i
[3:16:36.800 --> 3:16:46.560]  remember in my phoenix police department uh i was made within the first three years that i was on the
[3:16:46.560 --> 3:16:53.760]  force the most highly decorated officer in the police department and then i developed a bad side
[3:16:54.480 --> 3:17:00.560]  according to the government anyway i never accepted any immoral or unconstitutional orders
[3:17:00.560 --> 3:17:06.640]  from superiors or in any way violated my oath to defend the constitution and the people's right
[3:17:06.640 --> 3:17:12.480]  and i i'm now the most highly the most fired officer in the history of phoenix arizona not only
[3:17:12.480 --> 3:17:20.720]  the most decorated but the most fired so i know how how hard it is today for law enforcement uh
[3:17:20.720 --> 3:17:27.440]  peace officers and sheriffs to stand up and do what's right because the new world order
[3:17:27.440 --> 3:17:31.680]  gang of thieves that control the federal government and many of the state governments also
[3:17:32.720 --> 3:17:36.960]  don't want that they don't want the people to have a representative and a protector
[3:17:37.520 --> 3:17:43.040]  and that's who the sheriff is well that's why people listening in in illinois and in florida
[3:17:43.040 --> 3:17:48.000]  and in california everywhere they're trying to get rid of sheriffs all over the country right and
[3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:54.320]  this is absolutely important that people support ramon frank's ramon frank dot com and uh and and
[3:17:54.320 --> 3:18:00.240]  and contribute to your campaign now or or or help you as volunteers uh because we got to get the word
[3:18:00.240 --> 3:18:06.560]  out that this is the sheriff we need not the child kidnapping and we had that previously
[3:18:06.560 --> 3:18:12.880]  you know new world order new age scum that that that that i mean we've had some bad sheriffs
[3:18:13.520 --> 3:18:19.920]  and uh you know and i mean i've it's i mean cps and kids for no reason you name it well i'll tell
[3:18:19.920 --> 3:18:26.000]  you my the the people that i inherited the sheriff department will be fully indoctrinated
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:31.440]  because what they do is just like me doing it when i deputize them that's just like me doing
[3:18:31.440 --> 3:18:36.800]  something and they're going to be they're going to be oriented towards serving the people and
[3:18:36.800 --> 3:18:43.440]  protecting the people and not just give tickets on highway 35 like i saw one do about four weeks
[3:18:43.440 --> 3:18:47.760]  ago on my way to florida bill hey what do you think of the on the new austin police chief
[3:18:47.760 --> 3:18:53.360]  chief i like him i like him i like one reason i like him because he wants he has he's for
[3:18:53.360 --> 3:18:57.920]  transparency and that's what i'm for i'm going to i know this it turned out he's a fan and i
[3:18:57.920 --> 3:19:01.920]  know folks that know him separately from me where he is a fan like a dinner party's talking
[3:19:01.920 --> 3:19:06.560]  about me or at other radio stations doing alex jones imitations i thought he was either really
[3:19:06.560 --> 3:19:11.440]  slick or a good guy when he was in studio you know he pretty much saw it us out did you know that
[3:19:11.440 --> 3:19:15.440]  i didn't know that you know jack what does that sound like to you do you think i can trust the

[3:24:03.680 --> 3:24:08.000]  Lev Jay McClam and Sheriff Frank with us for about other 15 minutes and I'm going to cover all the
[3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:15.200]  final final financial news of the day with everybody stock market went down about 400
[3:24:15.200 --> 3:24:23.600]  points and it went back up 217 points past its low of the day or past its low it's closed yesterday
[3:24:23.600 --> 3:24:29.120]  so a lot of market manipulation going on there the big news blitz coming up
[3:24:31.520 --> 3:24:36.160]  Jay McClam we're seeing congress come out and say they were threatened with martial law they
[3:24:36.160 --> 3:24:41.200]  didn't pass the bank or takeover bill we're seeing so much of the new order system unfold
[3:24:41.840 --> 3:24:45.680]  right in front of us what do you see happening on the economy front and the whole police state
[3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:54.400]  front in the short and long term well they're they're really pushing uh chaney and bush want to
[3:24:54.400 --> 3:25:00.320]  stay in his dictators of america so they'd like to have us under martial law before the election
[3:25:00.320 --> 3:25:06.320]  so they can cancel the election but see they're the puppets of the council and foreign relations
[3:25:06.320 --> 3:25:11.120]  so they they have to wait for a decision from the council and foreign relations if they're
[3:25:11.120 --> 3:25:17.920]  going to have abomination or traitor mccain as our president or our is the cfr going to allow
[3:25:17.920 --> 3:25:24.960]  them to put us under martial law and stay in his dictators themselves before the election so it's
[3:25:24.960 --> 3:25:31.360]  all up to the council and foreign relations really as to who our next our dictator will be because
[3:25:31.360 --> 3:25:38.160]  abomination appointed the the president of the council and foreign relations as his campaign
[3:25:38.160 --> 3:25:46.560]  chief and then he appointed a top communist in the country um the big new brazilian as his foreign
[3:25:46.560 --> 3:25:53.840]  policy manager and he is a hardcore communist you know in in houston i guess you probably heard
[3:25:53.840 --> 3:25:59.840]  alec said in houston when you walk in the front door of his presidential campaign headquarters
[3:25:59.840 --> 3:26:08.080]  he had a picture of uh the number one uh guerrilla warfare uh uh terrorist uh
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:16.480]  i can't even think of his name now shaguvaram shaguvaram a flag of shaguvaram right behind

[3:33:22.640 --> 3:33:26.960]  how it would form the constitutional posse imagine the idea of the government against the
[3:33:26.960 --> 3:33:33.040]  people spying on us versus sheriffs who are elected saying no to the feds no to tyranny
[3:33:33.040 --> 3:33:36.720]  and not squeezing the public and that's why they've been moving to block the sheriffs get
[3:33:36.720 --> 3:33:40.960]  rid of the sheriffs and we still have avenues the juries the grand juries the sheriffs
[3:33:40.960 --> 3:33:45.040]  there's a lot of other ways that that we get to maintain the people's power
[3:33:45.040 --> 3:33:50.720]  previously before the 17th amendment federal senators were appointed by the legislatures
[3:33:50.720 --> 3:33:55.920]  of the states who voted for the u.s senator and would send them to washington again state power
[3:33:55.920 --> 3:34:01.200]  everything is moving away from people power into centralizations hands sheriff frank's
[3:34:01.840 --> 3:34:07.040]  tell us more about your posse if you're reelected sheriff in sheriff previously a few decades ago
[3:34:07.040 --> 3:34:13.200]  uh here in travis county what i'm envision i could draw up on one or two hundred citizens
[3:34:14.080 --> 3:34:19.520]  probably more in precinct three because it's more populated than precinct four and in other words
[3:34:19.520 --> 3:34:27.200]  i don't i won't pick them all from one precinct and uh indoctrinate them train them issue them a
[3:34:27.200 --> 3:34:36.000]  badge with appropriate credential and uh and have a notification system where one person would notify
[3:34:36.000 --> 3:34:42.240]  five others and those five would notify others if if needed and uh and for fires or wrecks
[3:34:42.240 --> 3:34:47.440]  yeah or or whatever crime or any of it yeah and i'm not talking about the travis county
[3:34:48.960 --> 3:34:55.040]  posse that puts on the rodeo i think it still put on a rodeo i'm talking about a real posse yeah a real
[3:34:55.040 --> 3:35:00.320]  posse that's uh that's deputized well let's say the feds you know we're coming through taking over
[3:35:00.320 --> 3:35:04.560]  the city government says they've been training to do your sheriff well i mean uh they come in and
[3:35:04.560 --> 3:35:10.240]  say we're here to arrest thousands of citizens work brigades this the economy's collapsed uh
[3:35:10.880 --> 3:35:15.040]  you're telling me that you would uh and that's how a whole rebellion nationwide that could start
[3:35:15.040 --> 3:35:18.640]  that had government quote you know credentials that could defeat the illegitimate
[3:35:19.200 --> 3:35:24.960]  feds imagine having thousands of uh sheriffs across the country saying no the new order would be
[3:35:24.960 --> 3:35:30.400]  overnight by taking over the local governments comment on that i want to comment from jack mclean
[3:35:30.400 --> 3:35:34.720]  on it well they're going to have to deal with my full-time deputy sheriffs who's going to be well
[3:35:34.720 --> 3:35:41.280]  trained on what to do and when to do it and that's number one plus my oh another one or two hundred
[3:35:41.280 --> 3:35:48.240]  people that i'm going to deputize and have ready to to respond to such a tyrannical act on the part
[3:35:48.240 --> 3:35:52.160]  of our federal government do you think that stuff like that's a possibility of happening i i sure do
[3:35:52.880 --> 3:35:58.480]  and i i really do and i this is one reason why i want to get this homeland security guy out of
[3:35:58.480 --> 3:36:05.920]  my jail because every foot they can get in it gives them that much access and uh i don't it worries me
[3:36:06.960 --> 3:36:13.840]  absolutely a jack mclean comments on what you just heard well i think that uh this is a time
[3:36:14.480 --> 3:36:21.280]  when uh they're bringing in the military now into the country to overthrow the county sheriffs
[3:36:21.280 --> 3:36:29.280]  and put us under martial law that share frank sought to get a couple thousand citizens and i
[3:36:29.280 --> 3:36:34.720]  i want to tell you too that in phoenix when we had that three thousand sheriff's posse there was
[3:36:34.720 --> 3:36:41.120]  many good ladies there too on the sheriff's posse matter of fact my wife is a perfect example 22
[3:36:41.120 --> 3:36:47.920]  years in the army and she's a better sniper than i am with her 308 rifle and then so there's there's
[3:36:47.920 --> 3:36:53.200]  a lot of things that the women can do uh some women can do better than the men absolutely let's go
[3:36:53.200 --> 3:36:58.160]  back to marshal law the men the women either for those that don't know the army times the news glenn
[3:36:58.160 --> 3:37:02.480]  beck they're all announcing the troops are here glenn beck says they may need to be used to arrest
[3:37:02.480 --> 3:37:10.640]  911 truthers uh jack your comments on that well i think uh all this falls in the category of the
[3:37:10.640 --> 3:37:18.080]  sheriff's powers duties and responsibilities and jurisdiction and uh so if they if these people
[3:37:18.080 --> 3:37:24.560]  do not have due process and they are truly constitutionalist and within the first amendment
[3:37:24.560 --> 3:37:30.320]  to protest or speak out and they're and the feds are trying to arrest them the sheriff is supposed
[3:37:30.320 --> 3:37:37.840]  to stop that uh because he is the protector of the people and he is the person that uh like when
[3:37:37.840 --> 3:37:43.840]  i was in the vietnam war i took the oath and i took it again as a phoenix police detective or
[3:37:45.040 --> 3:37:51.440]  investigator and um and it was to defend the constitution by the way jack as you know there
[3:37:51.440 --> 3:37:56.560]  have been a thousands of cases of the pinkerton security in the last 150 years and through the
[3:37:56.560 --> 3:38:01.520]  depression and other private security firm people see that in westerns where the bad railroad and
[3:38:01.520 --> 3:38:06.000]  forcers come and kill people in the town and take mines and property and and and and and
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:10.720]  water rights there were thousands of cases where sheriffs would call up a posse and run
[3:38:10.720 --> 3:38:15.760]  their butt out of town and and and so people can't imagine and i mean the last 50 years folks
[3:38:15.760 --> 3:38:20.160]  people can't imagine a sheriff doing that no i mean that that's what this country was built on
[3:38:21.840 --> 3:38:26.800]  absolutely absolutely and now we're so domesticated that it's an alien thought
[3:38:27.920 --> 3:38:34.560]  well it's uh that's uh we've been brainwashed into believing that the feds can come in and
[3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:40.480]  do anything they want and many of the sheriffs have been brainwashed that way too but um i can
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:47.280]  tell you of some sheriffs that one went to his grave hating himself because he was the sheriff
[3:38:47.280 --> 3:38:53.280]  that allowed wakeo to happen in his county that's right he could have gone in he could have gone
[3:38:53.280 --> 3:38:59.680]  in and and arrested david karash oh you knew the wake up should have fallen county he was uh
[3:38:59.680 --> 3:39:05.120]  he was elected in nineteen eighty seventy two the same year the lie was yeah and he he hated
[3:39:05.120 --> 3:39:11.280]  himself he hated himself for letting the feds come in and start that fire and burn up the
[3:39:11.280 --> 3:39:17.040]  children and moms and dads and then he knew of the machine gun nest out back because the
[3:39:17.040 --> 3:39:23.280]  fleer radar picked him up machine gunning the people that ran out to the um the building back
[3:39:23.280 --> 3:39:29.280]  there to try to get away from the fire and and he truly went to his grave hating himself
[3:39:29.280 --> 3:39:33.520]  now he said that on tv he he he was really upset about that he said they could pick
[3:39:33.520 --> 3:39:38.160]  crush up any time in town yeah but they wanted to go in there and burn out a quote cult to sell
[3:39:38.160 --> 3:39:44.560]  the public yeah on accepting it uh well jack mclem thank you so much for spending time with us what

[3:43:35.520 --> 3:43:43.680]  uh of course started in nineteen uh in 1943 went through pilot training got my wings was 19
[3:43:44.320 --> 3:43:50.800]  went over and uh went overseas had my choice to stay in japan fly p51's or go over to korea and fly
[3:43:50.800 --> 3:43:58.160]  p38's i chose japan and i'm glad i did because i later went to korea during the korean war and uh
[3:43:59.040 --> 3:44:05.120]  but then later i decided i needed to learn something besides flying and i became a special
[3:44:05.120 --> 3:44:12.160]  agent with the air force officer special investigations the only problem was um i was a
[3:44:12.160 --> 3:44:18.640]  captain and major and then you wind up behind a desk while the the younger people in the lesser
[3:44:18.640 --> 3:44:25.120]  rank go out and do the uh the intelligence work and counterintelligence work and here you are
[3:44:25.120 --> 3:44:30.320]  putting a medal on a lovely young lady who's that that's my daughter brenda she was a an air force
[3:44:30.320 --> 3:44:35.920]  lieutenant graduate and uh her her initial assignment was an aircraft maintenance officer at dober
[3:44:35.920 --> 3:44:43.280]  delaware i told her how to change oil in a folks wagon so anyway what was korea like what were you
[3:44:43.280 --> 3:44:48.560]  doing over there that was in uh that was in i've been married one month went overseas to korea
[3:44:48.560 --> 3:44:55.200]  to uh to korea went to kimpo air base i was there about two weeks the chinese were coming south so
[3:44:55.200 --> 3:45:01.760]  we evacuated about 24 hours before they got there and went back to japan and i stayed over for that
[3:45:01.760 --> 3:45:08.960]  thing for about a for about eight what kind of missions you fly there and that bf 82s and f84s
[3:45:08.960 --> 3:45:15.280]  what were you doing i mean what kind of missions were you well uh looking for a big mega aircraft
[3:45:15.280 --> 3:45:21.360]  to shoot down and so forth that never happened to me i didn't get a chance but that's some people did
[3:45:21.360 --> 3:45:29.520]  not many of them so you were basically hunting around to direct other aircraft well flying up
[3:45:29.520 --> 3:45:34.720]  near the yellow river and where we could encounter the enemy and and then take care of them in the
[3:45:34.720 --> 3:45:42.400]  appropriate manner uh and then um what you do during the vietnam era i was a special agent
[3:45:42.400 --> 3:45:48.720]  with the air force and yeah that's what in london and v spot in germany and berlin different places
[3:45:48.720 --> 3:45:55.600]  like that pretty exciting berlin was considered a spook capital of the world uh a lot of agents

[3:47:28.960 --> 3:47:33.760]  week we got the guys from the money masters on with us tomorrow to get into how this private
[3:47:33.760 --> 3:47:40.240]  central banks are engineering all of this uh by design i want to cover some financial news now
[3:47:40.240 --> 3:47:45.040]  here right at the end and the final segment when we come back but before i do that you know i spent
[3:47:45.040 --> 3:47:49.440]  over an hour today uh going after zeitgeist addendum because i was saying oh i think you're a good
[3:47:49.440 --> 3:47:53.520]  guy oh i think your film i disagree with quite a bit of it in the utopia withering away of the
[3:47:53.520 --> 3:47:58.960]  state and you know gun disarmament and all of this uh but i said you know i know you're bashing
[3:47:58.960 --> 3:48:03.600]  christians and religion you know and that doesn't exist in his hokey superstition but i said you
[3:48:03.600 --> 3:48:08.720]  know i i think you should you know widen your horizons a bit but then i went and looked into it
[3:48:08.720 --> 3:48:14.160]  more and found out that it's very occultic tied into the theosophics society the un
[3:48:15.120 --> 3:48:20.800]  i cover that in in in part of the first hour and then into the second hour today and if you
[3:48:20.800 --> 3:48:26.480]  didn't hear that on the amon fm dial during this show or on shortwave or satellite uh it's all
[3:48:26.480 --> 3:48:31.680]  going to re-air in about 12 minutes at info wars dot com on the audio streams and let me tell you
[3:48:31.680 --> 3:48:36.160]  this this thing is very popular in the liberty and awakening movement and i would love to say it
[3:48:36.160 --> 3:48:41.760]  was good and it was happy it was friendly uh but i'm glad that i started looking into it more and
[3:48:41.760 --> 3:48:48.880]  found what i found because uh they have the un christ uh the the world government christ to the
[3:48:48.880 --> 3:48:55.440]  un of the theophics the society the theosophics society believes is is is the world government
[3:48:55.440 --> 3:49:01.680]  christ intros and outros the film and they talk about the god spirit and all the stuff in us
[3:49:01.680 --> 3:49:05.280]  so see they're saying we're all religious codes when i'm not even debating them about bashing
[3:49:05.280 --> 3:49:09.440]  christians i'm not even engaging there i'm like what about all this about world government
[3:49:09.440 --> 3:49:13.920]  and reeducation and all this on a good world government and saying the private banks are
[3:49:13.920 --> 3:49:19.120]  free market and the scam they're running free market when it's not and it's like oh you just
[3:49:19.120 --> 3:49:22.880]  aren't smart you're just a lowly christian you just don't know you just don't understand you
[3:49:22.880 --> 3:49:26.400]  just can't even quite you know it's too advanced for you to understand i'm like no i've seen this
[3:49:26.400 --> 3:49:31.840]  for 150 years out of the new world order and then i went and researched it more and i mean just for
[3:49:31.840 --> 3:49:37.200]  two hours and that was researching about the first 20 minutes it would take months to research every
[3:49:37.200 --> 3:49:42.000]  bit of it and i mean the more everything i every door i knock down it's just like the stench of
[3:49:42.000 --> 3:49:48.400]  new world order it's just absolutely off the charts um before we uh in this segment i want to

[3:52:28.240 --> 3:52:35.040]  planet dot tv had the opportunity to speak to my 90 year old grandmother at some length here
[3:52:35.040 --> 3:52:38.480]  recently and she was talking about the great depression and we were talking about the gas
[3:52:38.480 --> 3:52:43.280]  prices the food prices this economic uncertainty we're in these you know really kind of perilous
[3:52:43.280 --> 3:52:46.960]  times no one knows where we're headed or where we might end up and she was reminded of the great
[3:52:46.960 --> 3:52:51.280]  depression and how in those days folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken
[3:52:51.280 --> 3:52:54.960]  and eggs and they could grow gardens and can their food but how difficult it was for people who lived
[3:52:54.960 --> 3:52:59.360]  in urban areas or in the cities because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how
[3:52:59.360 --> 3:53:03.440]  and they didn't have the chickens and the livestock so it's a lot different for them well we know one
[3:53:03.440 --> 3:53:07.760]  thing's certain right now we're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a global food
