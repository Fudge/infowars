[00:00.000 --> 00:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was just recently asked by some family if they thought it would be
[00:22.000 --> 00:27.920]  a good idea to take the Amtrak train down from Washington down Highway 1, one of the
[00:27.920 --> 00:33.720]  most scenic routes in the world to San Francisco on a classic two-day trip and I said I wouldn't
[00:33.720 --> 00:41.040]  get on an Amtrak train if my life depended on it and I sure wouldn't bring my children
[00:41.040 --> 00:47.640]  on one because they haven't updated the rail beds in 60 years.
[00:47.640 --> 00:51.960]  We have worse rail beds than Mexico.
[00:51.960 --> 00:57.080]  That's why trains can go 250 miles an hour in Japan or in Germany but not in the US.
[00:57.080 --> 01:02.200]  My grandmother, when she was going to college, would shoot down from East Texas to get her
[01:02.200 --> 01:07.040]  masters in Houston on a train that went 135 miles an hour.
[01:07.040 --> 01:09.920]  Now they can't go 40 miles an hour on that same track.
[01:09.920 --> 01:14.520]  Here it is, train wreck Tacoma, death toll unknown, 80 mile an hour, flew off the track.
[01:14.520 --> 01:18.640]  Looks like it obviously had a bunch of passengers on board, pray for those folks.
[01:18.640 --> 01:20.840]  That's all coming up, so much more.
[01:20.840 --> 01:24.720]  Obama's been caught working with Hezbollah to deal drugs, that's mainstream news.
[01:24.720 --> 01:29.320]  You cannot make this up, but first, powerful report by John Baum, Mueller ignores the Fourth
[01:29.320 --> 01:31.600]  Amendment to foment a coup.
[01:31.600 --> 01:39.520]  It's not looking good, it's quite sad to see that, so my people were very upset about
[01:39.520 --> 01:40.520]  it.
[01:40.520 --> 01:46.080]  I can't imagine there's anything on it frankly because as we said, there's no collusion.
[01:46.080 --> 01:53.200]  There's no collusion whatsoever, but a lot of lawyers thought that was pretty sad.
[01:53.200 --> 01:57.680]  What does the Fourth Amendment mean to special counsel Robert Mueller's bogus, deep state
[01:57.680 --> 02:00.360]  investigation of the commander in chief?
[02:00.360 --> 02:02.680]  Well as you would expect, nothing.
[02:02.680 --> 02:07.880]  In a letter obtained by Fox News and sent to House and Senate committees on Saturday,
[02:07.880 --> 02:13.960]  the transition team's attorney alleges unlawful conduct by the career staff at the General
[02:13.960 --> 02:19.920]  Services Administration and handing over transition documents to the special counsel's office.
[02:19.920 --> 02:27.000]  Lori Langhofer, the counsel to Trump for America, argues the GSA did not own or control
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.720]  the records in question and the release of documents could be a violation of the Fourth
[02:31.720 --> 02:35.880]  Amendment which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.
[02:35.880 --> 02:41.280]  The emails are said to be of a sensitive nature regarding Trump's interior conversations
[02:41.280 --> 02:44.920]  about nominees, not to mention executive policy.
[02:44.920 --> 02:50.880]  However, once it was added to the spin cycle of the mainstream media, special counsel Mueller
[02:50.880 --> 02:53.240]  came out smelling as fresh as a daisy.
[02:53.240 --> 02:59.760]  But this has been a months long orchestrated, frankly pathetic and also dangerous attack
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.440]  by Fox News, by many in the conservative right to try to discredit Mueller.
[03:04.440 --> 03:05.440]  This is a different legal team.
[03:05.440 --> 03:10.360]  What they're doing is they're setting up the ground game to fire Mueller and let me tell
[03:10.360 --> 03:15.080]  you, the American, majority of American people will not allow this move on, has had more
[03:15.080 --> 03:23.480]  than 80,000 people sign up for a protest if in case Mueller is indeed fired.
[03:23.480 --> 03:26.600]  Over 500 events across the country.
[03:26.600 --> 03:28.480]  People are not going to take it.
[03:28.480 --> 03:33.600]  Except the Harvard Harris poll released recently said 54% of Americans of all parties see the
[03:33.600 --> 03:35.400]  investigators as biased against Trump.
[03:35.400 --> 03:36.400]  Okay, look at that.
[03:36.400 --> 03:38.440]  So you may see it on your end, but polling shows different.
[03:38.440 --> 03:39.440]  That's one poll.
[03:39.440 --> 03:40.440]  That's one.
[03:40.440 --> 03:41.440]  This is a total distract.
[03:41.440 --> 03:45.640]  Let me just say, this whole discussion is so interesting to me because it's all part
[03:45.640 --> 03:51.520]  of the Trump legal team assault on the integrity of law enforcement in this country intended
[03:51.520 --> 03:58.800]  to distract people, distract people from the potential, the investigation into ties between
[03:58.800 --> 04:02.480]  the Trump campaign and its officials and Russian interference.
[04:02.480 --> 04:06.160]  And this is all a setup potentially to fire Bob Mueller.
[04:06.160 --> 04:11.440]  When Trump's lawyers come out and use the press to say Mueller's acting unlawfully,
[04:11.440 --> 04:16.240]  that creates a narrative for right wing media to put on the bottom of the screen, to put
[04:16.240 --> 04:21.960]  in banner headlines on the website, to add more fodder to this narrative that the Mueller
[04:21.960 --> 04:24.240]  probe is illegitimate needs to be shut down.
[04:24.240 --> 04:27.960]  I believe that the president wants all of this shut down.
[04:27.960 --> 04:34.480]  He wants to shut down these investigations and he wants to fire special counsel Mueller.
[04:34.480 --> 04:39.520]  The rumor on the hill when I left yesterday was that the president was going to make a
[04:39.520 --> 04:47.520]  significant speech at the end of next week and on December 22nd, when we are out of DC,
[04:47.520 --> 04:50.760]  he was going to fire Robert Mueller.
[04:50.760 --> 04:56.440]  Oddly enough, as the world turns, regardless of the beating of the dead horse of Russia
[04:56.440 --> 05:03.360]  collusion with the White House, you heard it here first and the globalists are already
[05:03.360 --> 05:04.840]  dreading it.
[05:04.840 --> 05:10.560]  It's the first annual Christmas spectacular extravaganza brought to you by Info Wars and
[05:10.560 --> 05:13.840]  it's launching Christmas week, leading into Christmas.

[06:07.040 --> 06:11.520]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:11.520 --> 06:25.080]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:25.080 --> 06:34.760]  It was Lieutenant Colonel Matt Schmitzmack that joined us a year and a half ago on the
[06:34.760 --> 06:48.880]  broadcast and he laid out how a shipment was going from a specific Arizona base of hundreds
[06:48.880 --> 06:55.080]  of millions of dollars of weapons, some of them high impact, that's grenade launchers,
[06:55.080 --> 07:01.880]  anti-tank weapons, you name it, to the Mexican cartels and then to Hezbollah, but also to
[07:01.880 --> 07:09.040]  ISIS to fund both sides, breaking fast and furious with secret program to ship arms
[07:09.040 --> 07:16.800]  to Middle East terrorists, Haddon Salazar, March 30th, 2016.
[07:16.800 --> 07:24.560]  Now he got physically attacked for coming on the broadcast and death threaded his family,
[07:24.560 --> 07:27.520]  you name it.
[07:27.520 --> 07:34.560]  So again, three people attacked him from behind and of course, Tosh Plumlee is a very famous
[07:34.560 --> 07:40.680]  CIA whistleblower, he recommended Mr. Schmitzmack, Tosh Plumlee is basically in hiding right
[07:40.680 --> 07:45.160]  now in South America, so that's what you have to go through to come on the show and
[07:45.160 --> 07:46.160]  do this stuff.
[07:46.160 --> 07:52.800]  These are very honorable men and because of them, we now have this information, it's
[07:52.800 --> 08:00.440]  Politico, not going to give us credit, it's all right here and we'll give you the rest
[08:00.440 --> 08:07.440]  of the story, Obama letting Hezbollah deal cocaine all over Europe and all over the
[08:07.440 --> 08:17.560]  United States and work with Mexican drug cartels to ship drugs into this country and the big
[08:17.560 --> 08:25.440]  story was Obama wasn't just letting him do it, he was shipping them anti-tank weapons,
[08:25.440 --> 08:26.440]  you name it.
[08:26.440 --> 08:30.360]  You go, why would they fund ISIS and Hezbollah?
[08:30.360 --> 08:36.800]  Because they want a crisis and a pretext to then move the U.S. military into the area.
[08:36.800 --> 08:40.920]  Trump is reportedly not being cynical in trying to clean it all up and then hopefully leave.
[08:40.920 --> 08:46.440]  The problem is McMaster is ignoring that, keeping U.S. bases in Syria and now it's come out
[08:46.440 --> 08:55.480]  from our sources and mainstream news are refueling, re-preparing, re-branding ISIS right now
[08:55.480 --> 08:58.640]  in counter-valence of the president.
[08:58.640 --> 09:02.920]  You are getting absolute total exclusive here.
[09:02.920 --> 09:07.600]  You realize how dangerous this is and I'm saying this is not pearls before swine is
[09:07.600 --> 09:08.600]  it?
[09:08.600 --> 09:13.400]  We're going to get some clips because this all just came together this morning and right
[09:13.400 --> 09:21.960]  before I went live I went Lieutenant Colonel Matt Smithmack, because the name is rare and
[09:21.960 --> 09:25.160]  then I was wondering what was his name, what was his name, what was his name and the crew
[09:25.160 --> 09:28.400]  found it in literal minutes and it all just clicked again.
[09:28.400 --> 09:32.720]  He laid it all out, now it's classified so he couldn't give the specific weapons or
[09:32.720 --> 09:42.520]  any of it but that's an active duty guy coming out and saying Obama has this order to ship
[09:42.520 --> 09:44.760]  these weapons in three weeks.
[09:44.760 --> 09:48.280]  Can you believe how much courage it took for him to do that?
[09:48.280 --> 09:51.240]  People keep saying when are we going to see the courage, when are we going to see people
[09:51.240 --> 09:52.240]  stop this?
[09:52.240 --> 09:53.240]  Well you just saw it.
[09:53.240 --> 09:57.200]  We should have stayed in contact with Matt, we just have so many powerful whistleblowers
[09:57.200 --> 10:02.240]  and patriots on it, I don't take him for granted, we're just in such a war politically in the
[10:02.240 --> 10:06.880]  information war and a pile of brass around us that we just, it's the fog of war here
[10:06.880 --> 10:11.440]  but this is incredible out of all the huge news we've got.
[10:11.440 --> 10:16.760]  Everyone's focused on the tragic 80 mile an hour Amtrak flying off the rails, passenger
[10:16.760 --> 10:23.280]  train looks bad, no death toll yet, DrudgeReport.com and FullWars.com.
[10:23.280 --> 10:28.720]  We have the latest but you add this to Obama working with Iran in one sided deals and Obama
[10:28.720 --> 10:35.660]  doing side deals and Obama working with the Arab Spring as well.
[10:35.660 --> 10:41.400]  The secret back story of how Obama let Hezbollah off the hook, that's the whitewash from police
[10:41.400 --> 10:48.360]  in Politico because they know that Trump and his people are now on this and that Obama
[10:48.360 --> 10:53.560]  is in deep trouble and that they could get in a lot of trouble for what they've done
[10:53.560 --> 11:00.680]  if we focus on it and talk about it and you've now got Congressman Bud Cummins, Congressman
[11:00.680 --> 11:08.440]  Jim Jordan, Congressman Trey Gowdy all saying the FBI committed crimes, it was a group of
[11:08.440 --> 11:16.160]  organized stay behind network engaged in organized crime fraud against Trump and the
[11:16.160 --> 11:21.440]  American people, we have them with their organized conspiracy, the entire operation of a tight
[11:21.440 --> 11:30.200]  knit group, combing, struck, the just department official, his wife heading up, fusing GPS,
[11:30.200 --> 11:36.760]  hired to create the fake dossier, I mean it is a tight knit group, it isn't the general
[11:36.760 --> 11:42.400]  FBI and it's because of good people in the FBI and in the military and in the ATF quite
[11:42.400 --> 11:46.560]  frankly, I'm not defending that bad agency but there's some good people that we know
[11:46.560 --> 11:50.280]  all this show, it's all coming together and I want to put the clips together today, I've
[11:50.280 --> 11:55.720]  got the crew on it with all the different statements because now you've got the former
[11:55.720 --> 12:01.400]  deputy director of the FBI, we played that yesterday coming out and saying these people
[12:01.400 --> 12:06.920]  belong in Leavenworth, we'll play that clip by the way when we come back from break, they
[12:06.920 --> 12:15.280]  belong in Leavenworth and Adon Salazar deserves a Pulitzer Prize for working weeks on this
[12:15.280 --> 12:24.840]  story and the Lieutenant Colonel deserves to really be defended but instead he got cracked
[12:24.840 --> 12:33.160]  down on, he got threatened, he got physically attacked and we gave him our number and our
[12:33.160 --> 12:39.520]  info, we never heard from him again, god who knows he's even among us anymore, Plumlee's
[12:39.520 --> 12:43.880]  in South America, we know where we doesn't want us to tell anybody, that's right Tosh
[12:43.880 --> 12:49.880]  Plumlee has gone to South America over this, he's had to leave the United States, very
[12:49.880 --> 12:58.360]  famous CIA contractor, Neufville Castro, knows all the big cartels, ran whole CIA operations,
[12:58.360 --> 13:03.480]  has left the building over this because there is a war going on behind the scenes and they
[13:03.480 --> 13:07.240]  told Plumlee, off air he told me this on there, he said he was getting threatened, they said
[13:07.240 --> 13:13.080]  listen old man, we're gonna come to your house and cut your G.D. head off, he said fine I'm
[13:13.080 --> 13:17.800]  dumping everything on you and then he left the country, this is a guy until he retired
[13:17.800 --> 13:23.560]  three years ago that would be on the show with a line of C-130s lined up, loaded with
[13:23.560 --> 13:30.600]  heavy weapons to be delivered to ISIS, calling in saying I got sources in NATO and the Pentagon
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.160]  and everywhere else that they're delivering high-pound weapons, hold on, hold on, we gotta
[13:35.160 --> 13:38.640]  wait for all these aircrafts, you're supposed to call them 50 minutes ago and I've told
[13:38.640 --> 13:41.800]  people that we're with them, there's like a line of 10 aircraft about to deliver all
[13:41.800 --> 13:48.840]  the weapons and he's going I've got sources they're delivering these weapons.
[13:48.840 --> 13:54.040]  So you think about all that ladies and gentlemen, that's what's going on here, that's what we're
[13:54.040 --> 14:00.280]  doing, Trump's not doing stuff like that, but McMaster who remember said we are gonna
[14:00.280 --> 14:03.440]  invade Syria, we are gonna take Assad out, remember six months ago and Trump comes up
[14:03.440 --> 14:06.600]  and goes no you're not, that's not true, stop it.
[14:06.600 --> 14:11.000]  But they built up these big forces right over the Iraqi border and they are reconstituting
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.560]  the groups to go in and try to topple Assad again, that's why the Russians just pulled
[14:15.560 --> 14:19.960]  their troops out to take the high road to say just pull your troops out, follow the
[14:19.960 --> 14:26.080]  agreement, don't overthrow this country that allows secular people and minority Christians
[14:26.080 --> 14:32.000]  and others to live there, stop, stop, but Trump as you've seen has his agenda frustrated
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.080]  at every single level, people say oh he's playing a double game, no he's not, I know
[14:37.080 --> 14:42.040]  people that talked to the president, Jay Zafir McMaster said that they were gonna go in,
[14:42.040 --> 14:48.080]  he said no we're not, no boots on the ground and I'm gonna make a statement on it and then
[14:48.080 --> 14:52.560]  he made a statement on it and that's why they were flipping out, because Trump was able
[14:52.560 --> 14:56.240]  to talk to people then that would bring this stuff up and say Mr. President, this is your
[14:56.240 --> 15:00.000]  promise you said that, you know it's a quagmire, you know we need to stabilize the region
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.720]  not be in there trying to stir things up, that's the old globalist agenda, don't have
[15:03.720 --> 15:09.120]  to tell me that, absolutely, what your Sam McMaster is on television saying that, yes
[15:09.120 --> 15:17.120]  sir he said it on CNN yesterday, so they sneak around like bad children seeing what
[15:17.120 --> 15:23.800]  they can get away with and they become outraged when people get a hold of them and tell them
[15:23.800 --> 15:29.080]  what's going on, that's why it's important for people to talk to the president when he
[15:29.080 --> 15:33.840]  goes out to speak or his security detail or anybody to tell him about stuff because they're
[15:33.840 --> 15:38.080]  trying to get him totally isolated, but again the secret backstory of how Obama let Hezbo
[15:38.080 --> 15:42.080]  off the hook, he didn't let him off the hook, he let him deal drugs, he gave him weapons
[15:42.080 --> 15:47.080]  and it continued in front of everybody but now it's coming out, stay with us more on
[15:47.080 --> 15:53.840]  the tragic derailment in Washington state, more on the economy, more on the FBI's Democrat
[15:53.840 --> 15:59.640]  operation coming unravelled, the attempt to frame the president, blown sky high, want
[15:59.640 --> 16:04.200]  revenge on the common house fly, well after 10,000 years someone has finally come up with

[19:56.880 --> 20:14.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:14.320 --> 20:44.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and by the way, we're in the middle.
[20:44.160 --> 20:50.400]  We're in the middle of the kickoff of the 34 hour transmission to celebrate our free
[20:50.400 --> 20:54.600]  open society, the return of the Republic, the global awakening and to say the words
[20:54.600 --> 21:00.640]  that the globalists hate so much, Merry Christmas in their lust to dominate and control and
[21:00.640 --> 21:03.920]  dumb down civilization.
[21:03.920 --> 21:14.640]  Now, there is so much to go over obviously here today and so many big developments happening,
[21:14.640 --> 21:20.640]  but I was reading leftist and globalist publications this weekend and they're panicking.
[21:20.640 --> 21:22.520]  They're saying Mueller needs our help.
[21:22.520 --> 21:24.720]  He needs demonstrations.
[21:24.720 --> 21:27.840]  Mueller needs people in the streets.
[21:27.840 --> 21:30.840]  Mueller needs a congressional investigation to intensify.
[21:30.840 --> 21:34.880]  Mueller needs us because he's not going to be able to get Trump impeached.
[21:34.880 --> 21:38.000]  It's falling apart.
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  Congressman Jim Jordan's being mean.
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  Traig out.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.200]  He's being mean.
[21:43.200 --> 21:47.960]  Former FBI Deputy Director James Colstrom's being mean.
[21:47.960 --> 21:50.560]  Congressman Bud Cummings is being mean.
[21:50.560 --> 21:54.040]  Now, there it is.
[21:54.040 --> 21:59.120]  There's Brian's deltas saying, Mueller is under attack.
[21:59.120 --> 22:00.560]  He's under attack.
[22:00.560 --> 22:05.800]  He's running around bullying people, getting stuff without warrants, spying on folks, manufacturing
[22:05.800 --> 22:09.680]  evidence up to his eyeballs with the Russians, but he's under attack.
[22:09.680 --> 22:12.960]  That means Trump's fighting back.
[22:12.960 --> 22:19.080]  That means that they've then got a whine and complain they can dish it out, but they can't
[22:19.080 --> 22:26.280]  take it because they know, ladies and gentlemen, that they've been caught committing massive,
[22:26.280 --> 22:32.840]  massive crimes and massive fraud against our electoral process, against our president.
[22:32.840 --> 22:38.960]  Now Scarborough slams foxes for fomenting a constitutional crisis could lead to violence.
[22:38.960 --> 22:42.200]  Oh, they're the ones fomenting violence with Antifa.
[22:42.200 --> 22:46.320]  They're the ones calling for constitutional crisis going back a year ago when Trump was
[22:46.320 --> 22:47.320]  president-elect.
[22:47.320 --> 22:51.640]  They're the ones that I've been warning you we're building towards this.
[22:51.640 --> 22:56.240]  And then when they finally trigger it, they're going to turn around and say, we did it.
[22:56.240 --> 23:00.880]  No, Hillary stole the election from Bernie Sanders, the nomination.
[23:00.880 --> 23:03.560]  Hillary tried to steal it from Trump.
[23:03.560 --> 23:06.800]  You're the guys that are in bed with the Russians and the Communist Chinese.
[23:06.800 --> 23:08.680]  You're the ones that sold out the country.
[23:08.680 --> 23:10.840]  You're the ones that manufactured the dossier.
[23:10.840 --> 23:14.320]  You're the ones that have been caught.
[23:14.320 --> 23:16.400]  And now you're getting more shrill.
[23:16.400 --> 23:17.520]  You're getting more panic.
[23:17.520 --> 23:24.000]  You're getting more crazy and the weak-minded people that follow you and buy into all this,
[23:24.000 --> 23:25.640]  they're getting more violent.
[23:25.640 --> 23:27.880]  They're attacking more people.
[23:27.880 --> 23:29.640]  They're shooting more Republicans.
[23:29.640 --> 23:30.640]  Their neighbors are Republican.
[23:30.640 --> 23:31.640]  They shoot them.
[23:31.640 --> 23:33.040]  Their neighbors are Republican congressmen.
[23:33.040 --> 23:34.040]  They shoot them.
[23:34.040 --> 23:36.160]  Their neighbor is a Republican legislator.
[23:36.160 --> 23:37.680]  They shoot them or a mayor.
[23:37.680 --> 23:40.320]  This is the new, oh, you're a Republican on the city council.
[23:40.320 --> 23:46.120]  I'm going to shoot you because you're a Nazi and I'm a soldier in D-Day fighting you because
[23:46.120 --> 23:50.280]  it's so horrible what Trump's done, trying to restore that country, trying to break the
[23:50.280 --> 23:51.360]  back of political correctness.
[23:51.360 --> 23:56.320]  It's so horrible that you live in this echo chamber that we've got to go attack our Republican
[23:56.320 --> 24:00.960]  neighbors like Rand Paul right now.
[24:00.960 --> 24:03.640]  So that's where this is.
[24:03.640 --> 24:06.200]  And now Scarborough says the violence is coming.
[24:06.200 --> 24:13.160]  The violence is coming because they've been caught making up the assaults that Trump supposedly
[24:13.160 --> 24:18.120]  engaged in, making up the Russiagate, making up what he's done with the economy.
[24:18.120 --> 24:24.880]  But as the economy begins to come back, their panic only intensifies and they've been caught.
[24:24.880 --> 24:30.600]  Their whole hope, the insurance policy to bring down Trump has now been blown into a
[24:30.600 --> 24:34.800]  trillion little pieces.
[24:34.800 --> 24:38.880]  And when is McCabe going to resign, the director of the FBI?
[24:38.880 --> 24:42.200]  When is Mueller going to get indicted?
[24:42.200 --> 24:46.920]  You see, that's why they're spinning it now that Trump better not fire Mueller.
[24:46.920 --> 24:48.080]  Trump better not fire Mueller.
[24:48.080 --> 24:51.720]  That's the line of the sand for nationwide riots.
[24:51.720 --> 24:53.120]  That proves he's corrupt.
[24:53.120 --> 24:56.800]  Well, he should be fired for all the fraud he's involved in.
[24:56.800 --> 24:58.440]  But hey, leave it there.
[24:58.440 --> 25:01.280]  Go, oh no, Mueller is going to stay.
[25:01.280 --> 25:05.360]  And Trump comes out all weekend in statements and says, I'm not firing him.
[25:05.360 --> 25:06.560]  He's a disgrace.
[25:06.560 --> 25:07.640]  He's a joke.
[25:07.640 --> 25:08.640]  He's a fraud.
[25:08.640 --> 25:09.960]  They go, don't attack him.
[25:09.960 --> 25:16.120]  Don't bring up that you got the emails and the text to how it's all an open and shut conspiracy
[25:16.120 --> 25:22.360]  by your operatives in the FBI to take out the duly elected president.
[25:22.360 --> 25:25.840]  So that's why Trump says, I'm not considering firing special counsel, but they don't stop.
[25:25.840 --> 25:26.840]  They don't stop.
[25:26.840 --> 25:27.840]  They don't stop.
[25:27.840 --> 25:28.840]  They don't stop.
[25:28.840 --> 25:32.360]  They come out day after day and say, yes, you are absolutely red line.
[25:32.360 --> 25:36.640]  Eric Holder, the incredibly corrupt former head of the Justice Department that was involved
[25:36.640 --> 25:41.880]  in all these cover ups and uranium one and everything calls for protestive Trump fires
[25:41.880 --> 25:42.880]  Mueller.
[25:42.880 --> 25:46.400]  Trump came out Antifa came out a few days ago and said, we're going to have nationwide
[25:46.400 --> 25:50.960]  basically rampages and be fires and notice he then says exactly what they said because
[25:50.960 --> 25:53.800]  it's all a Soros playbook.
[25:53.800 --> 25:54.800]  And here's another one.
[25:54.800 --> 25:59.760]  Trump, my people are very upset about Mueller obtaining emails illegally, which show nothing.
[25:59.760 --> 26:03.840]  They claim that's being mean to Mueller to point out you violated my rights.
[26:03.840 --> 26:05.640]  You swat team grade all these people.
[26:05.640 --> 26:06.640]  You got caught lying.
[26:06.640 --> 26:10.160]  You lied to get a fake warrant.
[26:10.160 --> 26:12.600]  That's bullying to stand up for yourself.
[26:12.600 --> 26:16.520]  Mueller walks over and stabs Trump right in the chest and Trump says, that's not very
[26:16.520 --> 26:17.520]  nice.
[26:17.520 --> 26:18.520]  And they go, how dare you?
[26:18.520 --> 26:21.760]  I just stabbed you.
[26:21.760 --> 26:26.200]  Trump's transition lawyer Mueller and properly obtained documents in Russia, bro.
[26:26.200 --> 26:31.280]  Even CNN admits that he breaks the law and the real problem is he trumped to unveil America
[26:31.280 --> 26:33.640]  first national security strategy today.
[26:33.640 --> 26:35.800]  That's why they're so upset.
[26:35.800 --> 26:37.200]  So let's play a few clips.
[26:37.200 --> 26:43.360]  Here is James Colstrom on Fox over the weekend, former deputy director of the FBI saying these
[26:43.360 --> 26:46.080]  people belong in Leavenworth.
[26:46.080 --> 26:47.480]  Here it is.
[26:47.480 --> 26:53.080]  What can an FBI official and FBI agent do to stop a president from getting elected?
[26:53.080 --> 26:58.280]  Well, I think he can do what this guy tried to do.
[26:58.280 --> 26:59.800]  He can fabricate things.
[26:59.800 --> 27:01.480]  He can make up stuff.
[27:01.480 --> 27:02.480]  He can lie.
[27:02.480 --> 27:04.160]  He can be a total moron.
[27:04.160 --> 27:05.880]  He can recruit others.
[27:05.880 --> 27:09.080]  You know, he belongs in Leavenworth, this guy, in my personal view.
[27:09.080 --> 27:14.120]  I don't have all the facts, but from what I know, he belongs behind bars, this guy.
[27:14.120 --> 27:17.240]  You know, these things cannot happen in a democracy.
[27:17.240 --> 27:18.240]  Yep.
[27:18.240 --> 27:19.240]  Total fraud.
[27:19.240 --> 27:20.240]  Let's go ahead.
[27:20.240 --> 27:21.240]  Here's Bud Cummings.
[27:21.240 --> 27:22.240]  Here's part of the clips.
[27:22.240 --> 27:26.880]  Congressman takes on the FBI plot and exposes the FBI plot against Trump.
[27:26.880 --> 27:28.520]  So let's go through some of these issues.
[27:28.520 --> 27:34.600]  I mean, the number three guy at the Department of Justice, the number three guy hires his
[27:34.600 --> 27:38.120]  wife who works for Fusion GPS.
[27:38.120 --> 27:44.640]  She's hired to do research about Trump colluding with the Russians at the same time that we
[27:44.640 --> 27:50.880]  know that Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation took $140 million after allowing
[27:50.880 --> 27:54.800]  the sale of 20% of the U.S.'s stockpile of uranium.
[27:54.800 --> 27:56.760]  Some people call that treason.
[27:56.760 --> 28:01.960]  That happened, and yet Bruce Orr's wife is hired who works for Fusion GPS.
[28:01.960 --> 28:07.360]  They come up with this dossier, which we know is a bunch of garbage, and that's actually
[28:07.360 --> 28:10.640]  the justification for wiretapping the Trump Organization?
[28:10.640 --> 28:11.640]  Yeah.
[28:11.640 --> 28:13.680]  I mean, we find ourselves here.
[28:13.680 --> 28:19.000]  It appears on the basis of a fraud that was perpetuated on the FBI and the Department of
[28:19.000 --> 28:26.560]  Justice and the United States intelligence agencies to form a predicate based on this
[28:26.560 --> 28:28.200]  fake dossier.
[28:28.200 --> 28:32.160]  And there are people along the chain that knew or should have known where it came from,
[28:32.160 --> 28:37.800]  who paid for it, and how credible it was, but it was used for foreign surveillance.
[28:37.800 --> 28:41.320]  It was used to unmask United States citizens.
[28:41.320 --> 28:46.400]  And then it was formed as a predicate for a special counsel that we are going to make
[28:46.400 --> 28:47.400]  today.
[28:47.400 --> 28:48.400]  We're going to break and come back with the rest.
[28:48.400 --> 28:50.760]  This is so critical what you're watching, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:50.760 --> 28:54.880]  The whole thing is coming down a criminal conspiracy of Democrats inside to engage in
[28:54.880 --> 29:17.480]  fraud against everyone.
[29:17.480 --> 29:45.880]  Once again, I'm going to break and come back with the rest of the story.
[29:45.880 --> 29:53.320]  All life benefits, if you'd like a free book about how this can be done, call 702-660-7000.
[29:53.320 --> 29:59.360]  That's 702-660-7000.
[29:59.360 --> 30:03.360]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[30:03.360 --> 30:08.720]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[30:08.720 --> 30:13.680]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[30:13.680 --> 30:15.280]  at InfoWareStore.com.
[30:15.280 --> 30:19.120]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[30:19.120 --> 30:23.240]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[30:23.240 --> 30:28.480]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[30:28.480 --> 30:32.560]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[30:32.560 --> 30:34.320]  the products that you need each month.
[30:34.320 --> 30:38.380]  Just go to InfoWareStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto
[30:38.380 --> 30:42.040]  ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[30:42.040 --> 30:47.360]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWareStore.com,
[30:47.360 --> 30:50.320]  this is a sure win, 10% off on auto ship.
[30:50.320 --> 30:54.720]  Win, win, win at InfoWareStore.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[30:54.720 --> 30:58.640]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[30:58.640 --> 31:05.000]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging

[33:21.760 --> 33:27.200]  Alright, we've reached an extremely dangerous junk shirt right now, the globalist program
[33:27.200 --> 33:33.400]  to block the American reboot and the attempt to simply get our sovereignty back into the
[33:33.400 --> 33:39.360]  United States and to get our own country under control of the people again.
[33:39.360 --> 33:45.800]  That has them pulling out all the stops, but every one of their operations is failing right
[33:45.800 --> 33:46.800]  now.
[33:46.800 --> 33:52.920]  So they are going to full weaponization where every comedy show, every major TV show, every
[33:52.920 --> 34:00.520]  news show, every newspaper is basically saying let's get violent, let's attack Trump supporters,
[34:00.520 --> 34:03.280]  let's attack Trump, let's have a civil war.
[34:03.280 --> 34:07.240]  And they just hope they can foam in enough violence and enough intimidation and enough
[34:07.240 --> 34:12.960]  bullying to make the American people roll over to their demands.
[34:12.960 --> 34:17.680]  And it's very sad to see the very weak-minded people, even as the economy comes back and
[34:17.680 --> 34:22.600]  good things happen, they really believe that the American people and Trump are physically
[34:22.600 --> 34:28.520]  hurting them so they're going out and physically attacking, they're bullying, Scarborough again,
[34:28.520 --> 34:34.800]  the clips coming up has come out and said that Trump is so horrible that he's going
[34:34.800 --> 34:41.120]  to cause violence in America to erupt while the former Attorney General calls for people
[34:41.120 --> 34:44.080]  to hit the streets to remove Trump.
[34:44.080 --> 34:47.480]  And while they run full-page ads in the New York Times and we say, hey, you're fomenting
[34:47.480 --> 34:49.280]  all this, they go, no, we're not, you're crazy.
[34:49.280 --> 34:54.800]  Scarborough slams Fox News for fomenting a constitutional crisis could lead to violence
[34:54.800 --> 35:01.840]  because Fox News is daring to have congressmen on with the emails and the text messages and
[35:01.840 --> 35:08.280]  the FBI files where they met with the deputy director on how to keep Trump out of office
[35:08.280 --> 35:13.720]  and how to create an insurance policy made up dossier to push the fake Russian narrative.
[35:13.720 --> 35:25.040]  We have caught them in a gigantic, arrogant, foaming at the mouth, arrogance-fueled, rabid
[35:25.040 --> 35:36.920]  dog, reckless, naked, bold, ridiculous fraud.
[35:36.920 --> 35:44.040]  It looks like maybe 15 people in the Justice Department and the FBI, and that really makes
[35:44.040 --> 35:48.640]  me feel good to know that for all the problems in our government, they tried to keep it down
[35:48.640 --> 35:52.400]  to like 15 people knowing that it would leak and they'd get in trouble, which of course
[35:52.400 --> 35:57.440]  it did leak, and people are going to start covering their butts now because they don't
[35:57.440 --> 35:59.240]  all want to go to prison.
[35:59.240 --> 36:03.160]  And I don't know how the Clintons and their operatives and the FBI get away with this.
[36:03.160 --> 36:08.720]  I don't know how Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch or James Comey or Eric Holder.
[36:08.720 --> 36:13.440]  I don't see how Strach gets away with this, and there's only a couple others.
[36:13.440 --> 36:18.320]  The Justice Department official, his wife at Fusion GPS, I don't see how they put Humpty
[36:18.320 --> 36:21.080]  Dumpty back together again, and that's the issue.
[36:21.080 --> 36:28.360]  They're now at the full-cornered hyena point, and we're moving in for the political final
[36:28.360 --> 36:34.120]  blow, and they're going to hit us with whatever else they got.
[36:34.120 --> 36:36.320]  I think they're going to go ahead and make their move to kill the president.
[36:36.320 --> 36:41.360]  I think in the next 30 days, I think they're going to make an assassination attempt.
[36:41.360 --> 36:44.840]  I just, my gut, I see all of them together, they're that desperate.
[36:44.840 --> 36:47.920]  They're either going to give up or they're going to activate their cells, and a lot of
[36:47.920 --> 36:53.400]  my smart sources agree with that, and they've got a lot of mentally ill Democrats and people
[36:53.400 --> 36:59.640]  inside the Secret Service, inside other places in government, and you know, whenever the
[36:59.640 --> 37:04.000]  Clintons and then the Obamas would go into military areas, they'd have everybody take
[37:04.000 --> 37:10.440]  the clips, the magazines, the ammunition out of their firearms.
[37:10.440 --> 37:11.840]  Trump isn't doing that.
[37:11.840 --> 37:18.240]  They're not taking the ammunition out, and I just, I don't think they should, and the
[37:18.240 --> 37:21.080]  president, if he's going to get killed, he's ready to get killed, and that's just where
[37:21.080 --> 37:22.080]  this is going to go next.
[37:22.080 --> 37:25.080]  And it's going to be like when they killed Julius Caesar, you know what happened to Plotters.
[37:25.080 --> 37:27.040]  I mean, they really brought down hell on them then.
[37:27.040 --> 37:31.960]  I mean, I don't want the president to be killed, but if they are dumb enough to actually do
[37:31.960 --> 37:35.800]  it, boy, they have sealed their warrant of death.
[37:35.800 --> 37:41.280]  I mean, they have guaranteed they are all going to probably never even see court.
[37:41.280 --> 37:48.160]  So they're playing chicken with people that are ready to mash down the accelerator, because
[37:48.160 --> 37:49.280]  I know I'm mashing it down.
[37:49.280 --> 37:51.440]  I'm pointing my car right at the nose of theirs.
[37:51.440 --> 37:53.200]  So is Trump at the spirit.
[37:53.200 --> 37:57.000]  Just you awaken the sleeping giant, paddle to the metal.
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.120]  Only thing that feels good is to not, not turn.
[38:00.120 --> 38:01.480]  We're not going to turn.
[38:01.480 --> 38:02.800]  We're not going to back down.
[38:02.800 --> 38:03.800]  We're not going to give up.
[38:03.800 --> 38:05.780]  We're going to break your will.
[38:05.780 --> 38:07.440]  We are going to break your will.
[38:07.440 --> 38:11.800]  And if you want to press down the accelerator, want to go right into us, that means we guarantee
[38:11.800 --> 38:14.360]  that your defeat, because we're doing this for everybody else.
[38:14.360 --> 38:18.040]  We're not Satan worshipers like you, only care about themselves.
[38:18.040 --> 38:19.680]  We're going to get you.
[38:19.680 --> 38:21.120]  We're going to come for you.
[38:21.120 --> 38:22.120]  We're never going to stop.
[38:22.120 --> 38:25.280]  You're going to be absolutely destroyed.
[38:25.280 --> 38:27.960]  So you want to fight?
[38:27.960 --> 38:31.160]  You better believe you got one and listen, Trump's not perfect.
[38:31.160 --> 38:33.200]  His administration's full of globalists.
[38:33.200 --> 38:35.800]  That's where he's, I mean, you can only draw from the swamp at this point.
[38:35.800 --> 38:40.400]  He's gotten a lot done, but he's restoring the power to the Republic, to the Congress,
[38:40.400 --> 38:42.920]  to the presidency, to the States, to the people.
[38:42.920 --> 38:44.000]  That's happening.
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.840]  The globalist takeover of America is almost at its tentacles completely cut off.
[38:49.840 --> 38:51.440]  It's why their money's drying up.
[38:51.440 --> 38:52.720]  It's why they're flipping out.
[38:52.720 --> 38:55.760]  It's why they got Phil Mudd on TV, so we're going to kill the president.
[38:55.760 --> 39:01.960]  Former deputy director of the CIA is a confidence game to act powerful to the entire world.
[39:01.960 --> 39:07.200]  And now everything I've told you about the criminality, about the network, about the
[39:07.200 --> 39:12.040]  fake dossier, it's all former deputy directors telling you it's a fraud, Congress people,
[39:12.040 --> 39:13.360]  and we have the documents.
[39:13.360 --> 39:18.600]  We have the real smoking gun documents that they don't have on the other side, on Russia,
[39:18.600 --> 39:26.080]  on selling us out, on making up a fake dossier on what they haven't said yet is they paid
[39:26.080 --> 39:30.840]  two million diffusion GPS and she got the main contract, the wife of the guy that called
[39:30.840 --> 39:36.120]  for the funding.
[39:36.120 --> 39:38.840]  And of course, the Washington Post gets it, does the Trump cabinet picks want to run the
[39:38.840 --> 39:40.080]  government or dismantle it?
[39:40.080 --> 39:41.760]  No, you got it.
[39:41.760 --> 39:44.080]  We're dismantling it.
[39:44.080 --> 39:47.760]  We told you it's too big, it's out of control.
[39:47.760 --> 39:49.520]  Get off our back.
[39:49.520 --> 39:53.880]  You put all this on us and bragged it was so we couldn't compete with anybody.
[39:53.880 --> 39:56.760]  It was a saboteur operation against the Republic.
[39:56.760 --> 40:01.000]  There are powerful elites that aren't devil worshipers, they're not perfect, by the way,
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.120]  who don't have it out for America or Western civilization and they want to build something
[40:05.120 --> 40:06.120]  good.
[40:06.120 --> 40:08.640]  Doesn't mean we won't slit your throat in a minute.
[40:08.640 --> 40:10.640]  You try to stop us.
[40:10.640 --> 40:17.120]  You scumbags take our kindness for weakness and you're going to find out that's not how
[40:17.120 --> 40:19.440]  the cow ate the cabbage.
[40:19.440 --> 40:22.680]  You want a fight, you have got one.
[40:22.680 --> 40:25.080]  You want a fight, you've got one.
[40:25.080 --> 40:26.520]  You want one, you've got one.
[40:26.520 --> 40:29.240]  You want one, you've got one.
[40:29.240 --> 40:31.640]  I love being alive.
[40:31.640 --> 40:35.000]  I don't like the persecution, the dirty tricks that I've done to my family, but you know
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  what?
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.120]  My family doesn't have any future if we don't beat you.
[40:39.120 --> 40:40.120]  You understand that?
[40:40.120 --> 40:44.160]  So I'm all in and once people are all in about this thing and don't care about how they get
[40:44.160 --> 40:47.800]  bullied online or what their neighbors say to them, stand up for what you believe in.
[40:47.800 --> 40:48.800]  Speak up.
[40:48.800 --> 40:49.800]  Don't be bullied and we're going to win.
[40:49.800 --> 40:52.840]  By the way, one big way to stand up is financial funding.
[40:52.840 --> 40:56.320]  Most people plug every segment during Christmas because it's the main time that merchants

[47:02.160 --> 47:09.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:09.160 --> 47:29.040]  So, if you are a regular listener, you know that I have exposed from their own websites
[47:29.040 --> 47:38.920]  their own plans the stated, admitted goals of Soros, the deep state, the Democrats in
[47:38.920 --> 47:43.720]  their own publications saying we're going to cause a constitutional crisis, we're going
[47:43.720 --> 47:48.160]  to bring all this Mueller stuff up and then claim that Trump's trying to block it, then
[47:48.160 --> 47:52.000]  we're going to have riots, then we're going to activate the Black Lives Matter, then we're
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.760]  going to have Republicans start getting shot and killed at their homes, public places.
[47:56.760 --> 47:58.480]  You see it happening.
[47:58.480 --> 48:03.280]  Some are going to kill the president and they do that, they even have Phil Mudd going
[48:03.280 --> 48:08.160]  there and say the government's going to kill Trump to look powerful to their other criminal
[48:08.160 --> 48:13.360]  networks to say, hey, hold fast, we're strong, he's dead.
[48:13.360 --> 48:17.960]  What all those folks need to do that have been approached about the coup is to go to
[48:17.960 --> 48:24.040]  the patriot media, go to the president, do your own YouTubes because then it'll get big
[48:24.040 --> 48:28.440]  and the people around Trump won't be able to block him from getting it.
[48:28.440 --> 48:32.560]  Here's an example in Bloomberg, Washington bureaucrats are quietly working to undermine
[48:32.560 --> 48:33.800]  Trump's agenda.
[48:33.800 --> 48:34.800]  That's called mutiny.
[48:34.800 --> 48:39.800]  Well, they said, Obama said earlier this year, he said, don't worry, we've been spying on
[48:39.800 --> 48:45.720]  Trump and don't worry, we've put people into all the positions so they won't let him hire
[48:45.720 --> 48:46.800]  anybody under him.
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.400]  We'll just fire those people and they'll lie right to the president's face.
[48:51.400 --> 48:55.400]  Just like McCabe said, sir, I'm loyal, I'll follow the Constitution, I'm not a Clinton
[48:55.400 --> 48:59.600]  operative, okay, McCabe, you're a nominee.
[48:59.600 --> 49:04.440]  And then McCabe is the ringleader in the emails and text messages creating the fraud
[49:04.440 --> 49:08.000]  of the Fusion GPS.
[49:08.000 --> 49:11.480]  Now you understand what the president is up against just like we are.
[49:11.480 --> 49:16.600]  He's just a beachhead, he gives the orders and they've ignored 90% of them, but still
[49:16.600 --> 49:23.160]  the economy's coming back because we were so tied down by these little abutians.
[49:23.160 --> 49:29.360]  And again, they've said in Atlantic Monthly, in the New Yorker, in the Financial Times,
[49:29.360 --> 49:34.000]  in the last year, hundreds of times, how they want a civil emergency, how they're going
[49:34.000 --> 49:38.280]  to call it an emergency that's his fault, how they're going to activate riots and say,
[49:38.280 --> 49:40.480]  oh, the economy plunged, it's his fault.
[49:40.480 --> 49:44.040]  They're ready to cause a depression.
[49:44.040 --> 49:47.760]  We're on the edge.
[49:47.760 --> 49:50.040]  That's why we've got to expose what they're doing.
[49:50.040 --> 49:51.920]  That's why we've got to expose their plan.
[49:51.920 --> 49:57.040]  And now word for word, when I told you they were planning to do with this soft coup that's
[49:57.040 --> 50:05.080]  going high, Scarborough comes out who is the mouthpiece of these people and says it all
[50:05.080 --> 50:08.920]  this morning, laced with baloney when they're the ones causing the crisis, when they're
[50:08.920 --> 50:11.960]  the ones that stole the nomination from Sanders, when they're the ones that tried to block
[50:11.960 --> 50:17.800]  Trump being seated, when they're the ones that created the frauds.
[50:17.800 --> 50:25.960]  And now we learn, I already knew this, but that Trump had hired different private contractor
[50:25.960 --> 50:31.120]  groups that were known to be loyal to the country who weren't globalist.
[50:31.120 --> 50:40.200]  Eric Prince and some other groups out of Florida, private contractor groups, to protect him
[50:40.200 --> 50:43.320]  during the campaign, during the time that he was in transition.
[50:43.320 --> 50:46.720]  And they've tried to, the Secret Service tried to get rid of them, but some of those groups
[50:46.720 --> 50:52.200]  are still there and they have told the president, it now came out in Politico and the Intercept,
[50:52.200 --> 50:53.200]  word for what I said.
[50:53.200 --> 50:56.680]  There's a rogue group of CIA and FBI, they're planning your overthrow.
[50:56.680 --> 50:57.680]  We're trying to stop them.
[50:57.680 --> 51:02.520]  They've been counter surveilling them, but only surveilling their illegal surveillance
[51:02.520 --> 51:10.840]  on the president, only doing it at point-backed range in the streets, only with human intelligence
[51:10.840 --> 51:13.360]  on the ground watching what's going on.
[51:13.360 --> 51:18.320]  I mean, this is a civil war, folks, we're taking the country back.
[51:18.320 --> 51:23.240]  In fact, it's beyond a civil war because we're the Americans, doesn't mean we're perfect.
[51:23.240 --> 51:27.720]  Private lives, intelligence agencies, citizens in government, corporate people, you name
[51:27.720 --> 51:30.400]  it, who aren't traitors, who just want the country back.
[51:30.400 --> 51:32.840]  That's all we want is our country back run by the people.
[51:32.840 --> 51:36.640]  And we want classic Americana prosperity, not globalism.
[51:36.640 --> 51:40.560]  And so we're being demonized, we're under attack.
[51:40.560 --> 51:45.800]  And the bureaucrats are just in a mutinous fashion ignoring everything.
[51:45.800 --> 51:49.680]  But they can't hold on much longer, it's been a year.
[51:49.680 --> 51:52.120]  And they're getting scared and they've been caught in their early fraud.
[51:52.120 --> 51:54.240]  They were arrogant, they thought he'd never win.
[51:54.240 --> 51:57.600]  They set this fraud up thinking it was an insurance policy.
[51:57.600 --> 52:02.000]  Then the arrogance went to fear as they knew they were all going to go to prison.
[52:02.000 --> 52:05.680]  And Trump reached out early on and said, just stop it, let's move forward with the country,
[52:05.680 --> 52:06.680]  I'll leave you alone.
[52:06.680 --> 52:09.960]  I told the president, I said, sir, that is a mistake.
[52:09.960 --> 52:12.120]  You must go after them now.
[52:12.120 --> 52:14.000]  They are going to do X, Y, Z.
[52:14.000 --> 52:18.800]  And the media goes, why does Trump keep listening to info wars?
[52:18.800 --> 52:22.560]  He says it and then Trump says it a week later, because I'm right, I'm right, over
[52:22.560 --> 52:28.240]  and over and over again, because I live this, I'm not a lazy blob.
[52:28.240 --> 52:31.520]  Like Phil Mudd that goes on TV and goes, we'll just kill the president.
[52:31.520 --> 52:36.480]  And then that's all he's got is his bravada.
[52:36.480 --> 52:38.000]  We're watching you scum.
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.720]  We know about your plan more than you do.
[52:39.720 --> 52:42.440]  You just keep rolling the dice, hoping you're going to win.
[52:42.440 --> 52:44.440]  This has all been wargamed throughout history.
[52:44.440 --> 52:46.720]  It's been wargamed here.
[52:46.720 --> 52:48.960]  You'll never get away with killing the president.
[52:48.960 --> 52:53.240]  And if you did, you will be destroyed.
[52:53.240 --> 52:59.000]  I haven't gotten to the Scarborough and Roger Stone is here with big, exclusive stuff.
[52:59.000 --> 53:02.560]  We're going to play the Scarborough when he's on with us, top on info wars.com.
[53:02.560 --> 53:03.560]  But it's here.
[53:03.560 --> 53:06.760]  But notice I'd say they're planning to cause a civil emergency and they're planning to
[53:06.760 --> 53:10.360]  call for COG and they're going to call it a national emergency and a national crisis
[53:10.360 --> 53:11.680]  that the president is the crisis.
[53:11.680 --> 53:13.320]  They're trying to declare the 25th amendment.
[53:13.320 --> 53:15.160]  They're going to say he's mentally ill and brain damage.
[53:15.160 --> 53:19.240]  They're going to, because we have moles.
[53:19.240 --> 53:25.720]  We have moles inside who aren't out to get the country, who act like they're liberals
[53:25.720 --> 53:29.640]  and sit there at the New York Times and the Washington Post in these meetings where they
[53:29.640 --> 53:31.520]  go, the public's not buying it.
[53:31.520 --> 53:36.280]  It's all fraud and Hillary and Obama are totally in bed with the Chinese and the Russians and
[53:36.280 --> 53:37.280]  everybody else.
[53:37.280 --> 53:38.280]  And what are we going to do?
[53:38.280 --> 53:39.280]  We get caught.
[53:39.280 --> 53:40.280]  They're like, don't worry.
[53:40.280 --> 53:43.480]  Next we'll say he has Alzheimer's or they're just going to kill him.
[53:43.480 --> 53:44.480]  You're like, really?
[53:44.480 --> 53:45.480]  They're like, don't worry.
[53:45.480 --> 53:46.480]  I've talked to the former director.
[53:46.480 --> 53:47.880]  They've got the teams ready.
[53:47.880 --> 53:51.280]  You know, I mean, if they're on TV saying they're going to kill the president, they're
[53:51.280 --> 53:55.360]  in these meetings, man, because they got to hype their people up.
[53:55.360 --> 53:56.360]  They're like, we're scared.
[53:56.360 --> 53:57.360]  We don't want to do this.
[53:57.360 --> 53:58.360]  The economy's coming back.
[53:58.360 --> 54:00.360]  My 401K is up 40%.
[54:00.360 --> 54:03.160]  These conversations are happening and they're going, you shut up.
[54:03.160 --> 54:04.160]  You're part of it now.
[54:04.160 --> 54:06.840]  We're going to kill that orange-headed piece of crap.
[54:06.840 --> 54:12.440]  Now sit down and shut up.
[54:12.440 --> 54:13.440]  And Phil Mudd's on TV.
[54:13.440 --> 54:15.720]  God, I'm just going to kill him.
[54:15.720 --> 54:18.240]  You're just saying that because you're getting your ass kicked, you want an American piece
[54:18.240 --> 54:19.240]  of trash?
[54:19.240 --> 54:21.360]  You big fat parasite garbage.
[54:21.360 --> 54:24.080]  Again, scum, you want to fight.
[54:24.080 --> 54:27.000]  You're just, go ahead and try to kill the president.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  Go ahead.
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  I mean, let's go.
[54:30.000 --> 54:31.240]  You want to fight?
[54:31.240 --> 54:34.040]  You're going to, none of you will ever get away with this.
[54:34.040 --> 54:35.040]  You idiots.
[54:35.040 --> 54:36.040]  It's not Scarborough.
[54:36.040 --> 54:38.240]  Oh, I know he's got away with other stuff.
[54:38.240 --> 54:41.800]  So like any other piece of garbage, he thinks he'll get away with this.
[54:41.800 --> 54:43.600]  You're not getting away with nothing.
[54:43.600 --> 54:46.080]  And here's a little secret about me.
[54:46.080 --> 54:49.480]  I'm not trying to get out of this myself.
[54:49.480 --> 54:51.080]  You understand?
[54:51.080 --> 54:53.880]  I want to see you burn in hell.
[54:53.880 --> 54:55.560]  I understand that, Phil.
[54:55.560 --> 54:58.040]  I'm not a devil worshipper.
[54:58.040 --> 54:59.520]  Narcissistic coward, scum like you.
[54:59.520 --> 55:01.800]  I want to see you defeated.
[55:01.800 --> 55:02.800]  You understand that?
[55:02.800 --> 55:07.760]  All of us have to have that attitude where we're not scared of anything and we are committed
[55:07.760 --> 55:10.400]  and we are not stopping and that's it.
[55:10.400 --> 55:11.400]  That's it.
[55:11.400 --> 55:14.400]  You understand?
[55:14.400 --> 55:22.160]  Now, they will strike back, but these sacks of crud are going down.
[55:22.160 --> 55:26.680]  We have them shipping the arms to Hezbollah, Obama.
[55:26.680 --> 55:31.720]  We have that Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel coming on that broke it all here in March of
[55:31.720 --> 55:32.920]  last year.
[55:32.920 --> 55:36.480]  The white washes in the Politico today.
[55:36.480 --> 55:45.960]  The secret backstory of how Obama let Hezbollah off the hook.
[55:45.960 --> 55:52.400]  Off the hook for drug dealing all over the world and in the U.S. to buy arms.
[55:52.400 --> 55:55.320]  And guess who they were buying the arms from?
[55:55.320 --> 56:00.240]  Fast and furious wasn't just shipping guns down to cause a Mexican civil war.
[56:00.240 --> 56:06.040]  They were shipping high impact anti-tank weapons.
[56:06.040 --> 56:11.920]  You name it, through Mexico, through those ports to the Middle East.
[56:11.920 --> 56:15.200]  And now, oh, I guess you want that to come out, Obama?
[56:15.200 --> 56:16.200]  It is.
[56:16.200 --> 56:20.440]  And to have a controlled demolition, you guys are releasing it through Politico to make
[56:20.440 --> 56:21.440]  it a whitewash.
[56:21.440 --> 56:22.720]  Oh, he let him off the hook.
[56:22.720 --> 56:25.240]  He didn't let him off the hook.
[56:25.240 --> 56:29.360]  He was in triple X sex with him.
[56:29.360 --> 56:30.800]  He was in Congress with him.
[56:30.800 --> 56:35.440]  He's in bed with Iran, in bed giving him the weapons.
[56:35.440 --> 56:40.200]  So, get ready for all of that to come out.
[56:40.200 --> 56:43.680]  The Lieutenant Colonel that first broke it all, breaking Fast and Furious with secret
[56:43.680 --> 56:51.160]  partnership arms of Middle East terrorists, March 30th, last year, Adan Salazar.
[56:51.160 --> 56:52.680]  And now it's all coming out.
[56:52.680 --> 56:57.000]  This is the specific operation.
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.280]  This has all been ordered.
[56:59.280 --> 57:03.600]  The guns are shipped out.
[57:03.600 --> 57:06.880]  The drugs are shipped out.
[57:06.880 --> 57:12.400]  And then the Arab and Muslim networks sell the drugs and buy more guns.
[57:12.400 --> 57:13.400]  Wow.
[57:13.400 --> 57:15.440]  Don't forget, store-wide free shipping.

[57:36.800 --> 57:37.800]  advantage.

[58:28.600 --> 58:30.440]  part is most important.

[58:35.680 --> 58:37.360]  quality lab standard.

[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:21.080]  Okay my friends, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Monday, the 18th of December
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.080]  2017.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.080]  Thank you so much for joining us, we've got an overload of people today, it's going to
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.080]  be amazing.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.440]  Roger Stone with Breaking News in studio next segment, we then have the Lieutenant Colonel
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:35.600]  from the Marine Corps on who first broke that fast and furious was being directly run on
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:40.400]  a military basis not just out of gun shops, that was the low level cover that was just
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:45.000]  a sting program gone bad, that was nothing, that was just retail part of an operation
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.200]  to blame gun owners so they wanted some retail arms shipped into Mexico, it was US Army, US
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:56.680]  Marine Corps, heavy weapons, anti-tank weapons, full auto machine guns, light machine guns,
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:03.320]  heavy machine guns, battle rifles, and then drugs were also given to Hezbollah, it's
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:08.880]  also ISIS, to be brought back in and then to buy more guns, that was all Obama, it's
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:15.120]  in political today, we broke it over a year ago, so that is coming up as well.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:21.480]  This is so bombshell and the entire FBI Clinton operation is now coming down, so Scarborough
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:27.600]  and the Democrats are now going directly to their day of rage that the Antifa groups
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.200]  that we broke yesterday called for, we told you yesterday the mainstream media will now
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:36.280]  call for rage in the streets, Holder has called for people to hit the streets, so Scarborough
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:40.720]  claiming that Trump's gonna fire Mueller, not even true, but again, we're gonna let
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:46.000]  Mueller just fry out there in the wind as all of these emails come out about he and
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.960]  McKay fixing the whole thing, so that's coming up, but first I wanna play this special report
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:58.720]  here, or at least part of it, this is MSM covers it up while Info Wars breaks it, so
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:04.960]  here's part of a report, but John Bowen, we are able to force things out that the media
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:12.880]  is already sitting on, remember Roger Stone and others broke here two and a half months
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:20.280]  ago that McMaster was at a particular restaurant, a particular place and who he was with and
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:24.080]  that he said, oh, I just got off the phone with that idiot, moron, all he can do is
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.200]  use Twitter, he's so stupid, I'm afraid he's gonna blow the planet up and that McMaster
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.400]  was a slob and drunk.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.000]  Now we knew the New York Post sat on that, the New York Times sat on that, we were giving
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.400]  it because they sat on it, and then two months later, two and a half months later, it broke
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:43.600]  what two weeks ago, exactly as we said at the very restaurant, all of it confirmed.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:55.240]  McMaster went to dinner with a CEO executive from Oracle, Safra Katz, Katz is widely admired
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:03.680]  in the business community and was being recruited as the possible chairman for the President's
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.720]  Intelligence Review Board.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:13.320]  McMaster became exceedingly inebriated, according to the report I have received, and during
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:19.120]  the dinner, took a phone call from the President, at least having the good sense to step away
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.960]  from the table.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:27.600]  When he returned, he went into a diet tribe about his boss, he described the President
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:34.840]  as a dope, said that he could think beyond 140 characters, that he couldn't understand
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:44.100]  any complex issues, and that the idea of Trump with his hands on the nuclear football was
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:52.040]  inappropriate or scary, he said it just is scary, that his view is, his job was to save
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.320]  Trump from blowing up the world.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:04:01.200]  McMaster, as I started out in April, he started purging anybody who was remotely America first
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.440]  to anybody who actually cared about America.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:10.680]  He had said that we need to get rid of all of the Trump people and bring in Obama holdovers,
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:14.520]  and then he said, you can't even call people Obama holdovers.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.760]  So right now, we are in a war for the future of our nation, and McMaster is the greatest
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.400]  national security threat facing America.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:28.000]  That's our job, is to not get the attention or even be praised for what we do, it's to
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.800]  force the media to cover it.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.800]  That's our real power.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.560]  Because before, they could cover stuff up like that forever, they could cover up a Monica
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:38.960]  Lewinsky or Chinese missile secrets, you name it, if whistleblowers went public because
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:44.480]  there wasn't a drudgereport.com to put it up, like back with Monica Lewinsky, McMaster
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.840]  trashed Trump and private dinner, MSN break story, info wars broke months ago, there's
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:52.360]  Dan Lyman's article from November 21st, you can scroll down into the article and actually
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:57.040]  click the original, info wars broke the story, report McMaster labeled Trump.

[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.040]  Yeah!
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:02.840]  Some of my colleagues at Trump Tower just a few minutes ago, there's a little optimism
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:03.840]  here.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.800]  No one thought it was going to be this close at this point.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:06.800]  Trump can still win this thing.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:10.280]  We have another state to project it as the state of North Carolina, big battle grad state.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.280]  It's going to Donald Trump.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:16.480]  I was actually ready to go to bed and I started seeing the electoral college come in and I
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.480]  was like, super psyched.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.720]  This is going to be a very close election.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:23.480]  I'm seeing these late-breaking trends.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.640]  This could hand Trump the presidency, folks.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.640]  This is not by any means over.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:32.360]  I think there's some real jitter setting in Clinton headquarters right now.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:38.040]  Wolf, the scene here is so different than it was a few hours ago when people were happy
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.120]  and relaxed.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.400]  This is most unexpected.
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:45.120]  Certainly is a huge, huge surprise to so many people out there.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:50.280]  I think we all thought it couldn't happen, that he couldn't do what he did, and guess
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.280]  what?
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.880]  He may just do it.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.360]  Donald Trump has taken the lead.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:57.200]  He has 216 electoral votes.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.200]  This is clearly the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.600]  He is pulling ahead of Hillary Clinton.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.600]  You see it right there, too.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:06.320]  We haven't discussed the number of groups who are likely feeling real fear right now.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:10.360]  You've got women, immigrants, who have been threatened by Donald Trump with deportation.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.400]  How do I explain this to my children?
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:18.000]  I have Muslim friends who are texting me tonight saying, should I leave the country?
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.440]  America is crying tonight.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:24.600]  I'm not sure how much of America, but a very, very significant portion, and I mean literally
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:28.680]  crying.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:33.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on your host, Alex Jones, and you're
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.040]  tuned in to InfoWars Live.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:42.360]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, shares with us to cover so many big, bright
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:43.360]  and breaking stories.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:48.480]  But obviously, most of people's attention is turned towards the 76 people that have been
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:52.680]  transported to the hospital, no numbers yet on any debt.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:57.080]  We hope, well, we're saying three debt after Amtrak trained the rails from bridge onto
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.400]  Interstate 5 near Olympia.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:03.720]  70-plus transported people still hanging from the rail cars.
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:11.080]  It crashed over a broken part of the bridge and went down into the Interstate Highway,
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.560]  crushing vehicles under it.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:17.720]  And as I've said thousands of times, I've had family members that have asked me to go
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:23.400]  on these trains, these scenic trains, and I said, not on U.S. railbeds, never.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:26.080]  They are amongst the worst in the world.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:31.800]  Our infrastructure has been purposely for 50 years absolutely shut down.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:36.840]  And this is just incredible to see this unfolding.
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:44.360]  Federal fatalities, scores injured after Amtrak train plunges off the bridge onto I-5.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:48.000]  So that is happening, obviously.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.640]  We're about to have something really plunge off a bridge, and that is the Democrats want
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:56.960]  to get days of rage, protest against Trump claiming that he's scuttled the Russia investigation
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:01.240]  and is about to fire Mueller and that he's simply exposing that it's a fraud and having
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:05.600]  the emails that it was a Democrat operation and based on a fraudulent dossier that the
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.240]  wife of the head of the Justice Department got paid to create.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:15.320]  And all this collusion, they are saying that they want days of rage, that they want people
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:18.680]  on the streets, that they want all of this happening.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:23.640]  Scarborough, slams, Fox News for fomenting, a constitutional crisis could lead to violence.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:27.760]  Meanwhile, Trump says he's not firing Mueller, but they just keep coming back over and over
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.240]  and over again saying, yes, you are, you're sure.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.400]  Now, Roger, early on, it said it's a fraudulent investigation.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.400]  Presidents can do this, do it.
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.400]  But the last three months, he's been saying, well, or two months, no, he should have a
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:39.240]  special counsel to expose Mueller.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.400]  Well, now Congress is actually looking at that.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:44.960]  So you've trailblazed there, but you told me this morning, now more than ever, Trump
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.240]  does not need to fire Mueller because the conspiracy has been exposed.
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:54.200]  I'm surprised they were arrogant enough to have FBI minutes, memos, emails, text messages
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.880]  with McCabe, who was deputy director at the time.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:59.640]  This is simply incredible that they were this bold.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:05.200]  Alex, it's really extraordinary, Mueller's public credibility continues to crumble.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:12.160]  The emails, the campaign contributions, the interconnection of the rabid partisans who
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.760]  are working for him.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:20.600]  And as his credibility continues to erode, the president's options, I think, continue
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.600]  to expand.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.200]  Now, we're the president to fire Mueller.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:29.600]  You'd have the immediate analogy to the Saturday Night Massacre, Nixon's firing of special
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:36.720]  prosecutor in Watergate Archibald Cox, and the left would get what they want.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.120]  Firing Mueller is unnecessary.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:45.220]  If Mueller has indicted Flynn, if he indicts the president's son-in-law on some phony obstruction
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:50.800]  of justice or perjury charge, the president has the option now of pardoning both of them.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.920]  The president needs to ignore his lawyers when they tell him that he has no authority
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:59.640]  to direct the actions of the Justice Department.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.640]  He does.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.480]  The Justice Department is an extension of the executive branch.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:10.600]  He can order Jeff Sessions, he can call him right now, and say, I order you to appoint
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:17.960]  Andrew McCarthy or Andrew Napolitano or Trey Gowdy or Rudy Giuliani as the special counsel
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.240]  to look into Uranium One.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.720]  And if Sessions cannot do that or will not, he must step aside.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.640]  There's nothing improper on that.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:33.880]  And once Mueller, and Comey, and McCabe, and Rod Rosenstein himself, who was the supervising
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:39.280]  U.S. attorney in Uranium One, are under investigation, they cannot go forward.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.000]  And you've gotten Mueller killing Uranium One.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.480]  I mean, these people literally are in a criminal conspiracy, and it's not just me saying that
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.480]  now.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:54.200]  It's all these, Trey Gowdy, Jim Jordan, it's Bud Gates, Ron DeSantis.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.740]  These guys are heroes.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:12:00.920]  They have courageously gone where the established Republicans will not go.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.320]  This whole idea.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.320]  And they're freaking out.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:08.560]  The Democrats are mad that this return America movement, return our sovereignty back to America
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.160]  movement, won't back down.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:15.580]  They are naked crooks with fake dossiers openly saying, we're going to stop the president
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:17.480]  and removing with made up crap.
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.640]  It's a frame up.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:19.960]  It's a conspiracy.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:24.520]  It's just like SJWs that get caught putting swastikas on their dorm rooms.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:27.760]  You have been caught scum, and they are freaking out.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.560]  But I think we're at the maximum moment of danger here, Roger.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:34.320]  You've got Scarborough and all their talking points saying, we're just going to overthrow
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.320]  Trump.
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.320]  We're going to get violent.
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:37.320]  Hashtag hunt Republicans.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.840]  So these bullies, just like we're some intern that gets our brains bashed out, I guess.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:45.400]  These bullies just think that they're going to tell us to fill our hand.
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.920]  Well, it's a different wing of the same operation.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.320]  You were the first one to call this.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:53.600]  Just like the elites, that's Mueller and the lawyers and the insiders, and then they have
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:57.280]  their street thugs financed by Soros and others.
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.400]  So they intend to foment a revolution.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.040]  And Eric Holder has said, hit the street.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.040]  So it's all coordinated.
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.680]  Well, the problem is, we're saying hit the streets.
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.240]  We're telling patriots, no, object.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:10.720]  Do not allow them to take our president down in a coup d'etat.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.140]  Here are the facts.
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:14.280]  This is a partisan hit squad.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.620]  This is a coup d'etat.
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:20.440]  This is an illegitimate takedown of the president, not based on evidence and law, but based on
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:28.920]  animus and hatred and fear that he is challenging the two-party duopoly in the established
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:29.920]  order.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.520]  You know, I have said last week that I think the course is clear, Alex.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:40.880]  Mueller is going to indict the president in some phony process-related charge, obstruction
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.240]  or perjury.
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:47.160]  His lawyers are walking him into that, either out of naivete or because they're in on it.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:52.000]  And he needs to put the special counsel in now so that Mueller has to accuse himself
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.640]  to draw attention to the wrongdoings and give that a new focal point.
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.640]  But I say this out of loyalty and support.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:01.080]  By the way, Jim Jordan now agrees with you.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:04.040]  So you are the progenitor of the idea of the special counsel.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:08.440]  Some are saying, no, we need to let the inspector general do it.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.280]  Why suddenly have we seen good news by the inspector general and the releasing of these
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.400]  emails and things that show the criminal conspiracy?
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:17.280]  I think the inspector general is a good actor.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.040]  I think he's doing his job.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:25.280]  I think that the abuses are so glaring, the partisanship is so glaring that he's doing
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.280]  his job.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:29.840]  I mean, this is like Cuckoo Land, like Hitler sitting over the Nuremberg trial.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:30.840]  I'm not just saying that.
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:34.840]  We have them saying we are frauds, we are liars, we're going to stop the president, we're
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:38.960]  Democrat operatives, they all help cover up Clinton crimes on the Russians.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.600]  They are covering up by accusing Trump of their crimes at the same damn time.
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:47.360]  But let's recognize that the president's lawyers, first they told him he would have
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:51.360]  a letter clearing him from Mueller at Thanksgiving.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.360]  And then it was Christmas.
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.360]  And now it's a new meeting.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:54.360]  What about this new meeting coming up?
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:55.360]  And then it was January 1st.
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.360]  And now it's February 1.
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:58.480]  I think that new meeting is going to be shocking to them.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.760]  There will be no letters clearing the president.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:08.920]  In fact, I think it is very likely that Jared Kushner will be indicted in regard to the
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:15.840]  Flynn matter once again for a perjury regarding underlying legal activities.
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:18.520]  Process because they don't have anything else.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:22.520]  And that brings it one step closer to the president.
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:23.520]  Kushner's done nothing wrong.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.560]  But now they're panicking because the fake investigation has been blown sky high.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.560]  They're panicking.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:32.120]  They're going to the final thing right at the streets, 25th Amendment.
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.120]  Exactly.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.440]  That's plan B. Man, I've got a brag.
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:39.760]  We have called this with total precision.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.120]  But I guess we've read hundreds of history books about coup d'etats and these operations.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:44.120]  No, no, no, no.
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:45.120]  We're conspiracy theorists.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:46.120]  Yeah.
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:47.120]  We wait and see.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.120]  Yeah.
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:51.480]  We'll be right back with the calls for fomenting revolution by the left.
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.480]  Then they're going to blame it on us.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.480]  Stay with us.

[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.920]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:05.600]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:12.400]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:18.760]  As a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force, Anthroplex.
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.080]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex, too.
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:22.080]  Thank you.
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:26.160]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal

[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:38.960]  Absolutely.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:44.080]  And because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:48.400]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:59.760]  order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:27.760]  Thanks for listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:34.480]  Coming up, Lieutenant Colonel Smith-Mack will be joining us, who exposed Obama's shipping
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:38.520]  guns to Hezbollah and ISIS.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:42.320]  Obama went ahead and shipped the next shipments, and that really made the military angry.
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.760]  I mean, Lieutenant Colonel's going public while they're active duty.
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:46.880]  That is just wild.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:50.160]  This is now in Politico.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.600]  It's just huge.
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:54.000]  We got to think about the folks, at least three dead.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.200]  Now it's saying 80-something taken to the hospital on a supposedly faster Amtrak train.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.360]  I guess it goes like 80 miles an hour instead of 40.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:05.400]  Of course, the Japanese have them going 250 and so do the Germans, but we don't update
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.120]  our railways.
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:11.120]  But we spend millions in taxpayer dollars subsidizing Amtrak.
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.120]  Billions.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.120]  Billions.
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:19.040]  And so, yeah, new knives, fancy cars, but not a road.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.440]  So there it crashes into I-5, killing a bunch of people on the ground.
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:29.000]  And I literally was just telling family recently, don't go on that scenic route.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  Don't get on an Amtrak.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.600]  I mean, you're really putting your life at your hands.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.600]  Not safe.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.600]  It's not safe.
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.800]  They're blowing up and crashing all the time.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:43.560]  Despite the fact that we've subsidized Amtrak and it continues to lose money handover fest.
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.560]  We need new rail beds.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.560]  We need private enterprise.
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:53.440]  I agree, well, I come from a railroad-type family on one side, and I mean, they just
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:57.960]  grew up talking about this and all the rest of it, I mean, our railroads have fallen apart.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:02.400]  Let's pray for the folks that are fighting for their lives right now, but they say it's
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.400]  safe and great to get on these, and I think it's insane.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:07.680]  We also have just so much huge news.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:11.240]  I want to get into the Scarborough article, and I want you to ride shotgun with us here
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:13.240]  throughout the next interview that's coming up.
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:18.600]  But Roger, before we play the Scarborough piece, I mean, Plan A was keeping from getting
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.560]  the nomination and then trying to keep it from being seen as president.
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.040]  Now they try to sabotage the agenda.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.320]  Now they try to have the fake Mueller.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:25.320]  That's blown up.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:29.960]  So now they're going right to the final piece that was rioting on the street in violence
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:34.800]  and calling for the 25th Amendment to take place, which you first exposed.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:39.960]  You know, I think if Mueller shoots and misses, which is now growingly probable because he's
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:47.120]  so exposed, he's so naked in terms of his partisanship and the rabid nature of the takedown plan,
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:53.280]  then the establishment will move to Plan B, which is a 25th Amendment takedown based on
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:56.640]  the fact that the president is allegedly non-compassmentist.
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:57.640]  He's nuts.
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.640]  He's crazy.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.640]  I've talked to him.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:00.640]  He's sharp as a tack.
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:03.200]  He's exactly the same as he was 40 years ago.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:09.360]  So I see no deterioration whatsoever, but you see Joe Scarborough, Don Lemon, Senator
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:15.480]  Robert Corker and others, the misfit Keith Oberman with this meme.
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.480]  He's nuts.
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.480]  He's crazy.
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:18.480]  He's around the bend.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.760]  But you're now willing to not give sources.
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.280]  Back at the first time you said this eight months ago, you said, but we're not going
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.280]  to give sources.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:26.720]  You said, when the female stuff fails, when the Russian fails, they're going to say he's
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.320]  mentally ill early onset.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:32.600]  And you talked to major writers at major papers who've been in the editorial meetings where
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:36.040]  they talk about, just like Veritas caught it on tape, the whole Russian thing's bull.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.040]  What are we going to do?
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:40.640]  People aren't buying it and they say, don't worry, 25th Amendment, we're going to say
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.720]  he's mentally ill and has Alzheimer's.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:43.800]  You have that from sources.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:44.960]  You didn't just imagine that.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:45.960]  No.
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:50.360]  Look, I spoke to a Trump cabinet member this weekend and I asked them point blank.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:55.040]  Has there been any discussion about possibly removing the president under the 25th Amendment?
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.680]  Has anybody spoken to you about that?
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:59.080]  Poker faced.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.180]  Just poker faced.
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:02.920]  That's how I knew that I was right.
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:03.920]  Now we've tried.
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:04.920]  Now they're saying it.
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:08.240]  Well, we've tracked Senator Ben Sasse talking about it.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:10.280]  We've talked Jeb Bush talking about it.
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:11.280]  We have talked.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:18.520]  We know that Nick Ayers, a high level aide to Vice President Pence, got busted leaking
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.520]  anti-Trump Russia information.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:27.360]  They made Mark Lauder, the press secretary, take the fall, but it was Ayers.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:33.200]  And we know now that Mike Pence did demure, according to Jennifer Jacobs of Bloomberg,
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:38.200]  in that episecond when the Billy Bush tape dropped and the Republican-
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:42.000]  He hung up on the president and the Republican National Committee and Reich's previous
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.840]  were contemplating a move to remove Trump as the nominee and replace him with Pence.
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:51.280]  We have come within millimeters of not having this American rebirth and then people expected
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:52.280]  to be perfect.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.280]  He's totally surrounded.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:57.280]  Here's Bloomberg admitting that all the major cabinet people, basically a lot of his face
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:02.320]  and are blocking everything he's trying to do, but just the little bit he's got through
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.320]  things are surging back.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:07.200]  I mean, if they're able to deep-six the economy, it's on their chest.
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.200]  No question about it.
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:12.960]  Look, this is the downside of appointing a cabinet of establishment Republicans.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:17.000]  This is the downside of not surrounding yourself with people who don't have your back.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.480]  No, there's a few standouts.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:23.040]  There's a few loyalists, Wilbur Ross at Commerce, Linda McMahon, and so on.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.920]  But by and large, you have establishment quizlings, people.
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:31.400]  And Trump just thought like in business, hey, if I bring you in and you have the expertise
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:36.240]  and I'm the executive, you're not going to hate America against its own prosperous in
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.240]  your own.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:40.960]  Yes, they are ideologues that we're hired to begin with by the globalists because they
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:42.200]  hate America.
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:47.800]  They have an existential lust of defeated and mounted on the wall because they're little
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.320]  beta-cut garbage.
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.440]  Well, and one opens the door to another.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:55.160]  So you hire Rex Tillerson and the next thing you know, Condoleezza Rice is running the
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.160]  place.
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:57.160]  And all your assistants...
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.520]  But it is good news that Hobbeat Powell got jettisoned out the airlock.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.120]  Yes, I think so.
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.080]  Clearly she got caught leaking and they had to bounce her.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:10.560]  But Massar will pace her with another globalist, with another council on foreign relations
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.640]  member.
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:16.160]  The president thought, and this isn't naive, that like in all times in Americans history,
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.280]  once we had an election, America would unite.
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:22.480]  Everybody would support the president because we care about our country.
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:26.360]  He just did not understand the deep-seated animus.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:32.360]  We are living in such an incredible time that the FBI would meet on record Democrats
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:35.760]  on how to engage in fraud and admit it's a fraud.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:38.440]  I mean, they are red-handed caught.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:42.780]  And it is a pity because, as you know, the FBI has had in American history this great
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:46.400]  reputation for probity and honesty and impartiality.
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:50.960]  But this is not meant to denigrate the men and women at the lower levels of the FBI who
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:51.960]  are the average agent.
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.560]  They're just trying to do their job.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.640]  But at the top, this is rotten to the core.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.240]  It has become a politicized case.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:02.360]  It's become a Democratic Party whorehouse with a bunch of arrogant cucks that think they're
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.360]  God.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:07.080]  Well, I would argue that it's become a globalist establishment whorehouse because guys like
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.960]  Miller do dirty work for the Bushes in the Clinton.
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:12.640]  And they sell out to all these offshore globalists in foreign countries.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:18.160]  In fact, they're not Russian agents, they're not Chinese agents, they are pimping us out.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.560]  They are selling us out.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.480]  They are sitting there as a clearinghouse, selling out the country, and look at it.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:28.160]  Well, they have no ideology other than the ideology of greed and power and money and
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:33.640]  control and a disdain for the little person and a disdain for open democracy.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.440]  But they're not Republicans or Democrats.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:36.680]  They're not left or right.
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:39.840]  They're just evil and greedy.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.800]  This is about money and power.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.800]  Roger Stone is our guest.

[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:08.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:13.760]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:18.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:28.600]  We're monitoring the Amtrak derailment that's killed at least 3 people and now over 85 injured
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:34.640]  crashing through the bridge and down into I-5 there in Washington State.
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:35.640]  Truly a tragedy.
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:36.640]  We'll be watching that.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:39.880]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, is riding shotgun with us.
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:44.480]  But this news broke this morning and Matt, one of the great producers, brought it to
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:48.280]  my attention and said, didn't you cover this back in March of last year, almost a year
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:51.440]  and a half ago, or I guess a year and a half ago or more.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:56.960]  The secret back story of how Obama let Hezbollah off the hook, that's out of Politico, let
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:59.520]  them deal cocaine, let them buy arms.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:05.360]  Now, that's what I was told by Tosh Plumley, CIA whistleblower, and so many others off
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:06.360]  record.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:10.040]  So, Adon Salazar wrote the article breaking Fast and Furious with secret program to ship
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:14.000]  arms to Middle East terrorists, ISIS and Hezbollah to destabilize.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.960]  That's what Obama wanted.
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:22.520]  Now, we've got Matt Smith-Mack, who was retiring at the time, but he's now retired, 20 year
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.520]  veteran USMC.
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:28.440]  I'm not going to go over his whole background in any terrorism and everything he's done,
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:31.440]  but he retired as a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps.
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:37.480]  And again, he's been on the judge advocate, tribunal members, and chief of staff.
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:39.160]  And so he had a really great career there.
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:45.040]  He was physically attacked when he began to whistle below by folks from behind.
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:48.320]  And so we've had Tosh Plumley's left the country over all this.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:49.560]  This is very serious.
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:51.320]  But now they're being forced to admit it.
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:56.120]  So this wasn't just Fast and Furious with some guns from some gun stores.
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.400]  That was just the cover.
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:00.480]  And a lot of this was classified, so Matt couldn't get into a lot of it.
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:04.000]  But he could say, hey, more shipments are about to happen under Obama.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  We need to stop it.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.440]  And here's the base they're coming out of.
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.880]  So he was exposing real treason.
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:11.360]  Well, sometimes these things take time.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:16.120]  Here we are a year and a half later, now Trump, the FBI is looking into it.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.480]  So Matt, I know you can't get into a lot of details of it, but as much as you can here,
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.760]  obviously, recapping.
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:25.520]  And this is right in the same area that you were talking about and dealing with and the
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:30.080]  accusations you made here on the broadcast in March of 2016.
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:32.720]  So Matt Smith, Max, thank you for coming on.
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:36.560]  Hey, Mr. Jones, thank you very much.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.680]  And thank you for inviting me back on.
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:47.000]  Yeah, I tell you, it's timely and it's truthful as I had spoken your program before, the Fast
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  and Furious.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.880]  And I can give you some additional information from February or this year onward that I'll
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:52.880]  get into.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:58.320]  But you talk about we knew weapons were going to the Middle East when some of these groups
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:05.520]  of kids, they used that in air quotes that ATF and those guys had utilized on more than
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:11.160]  three occasions, right, weapons through local hours on a downright route to the work of Mexico,
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:15.400]  where these kids who were involved in this, they'll talk about meeting with US government
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:21.880]  officials and people of Middle Eastern descent for the weapons going to the Middle East.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:30.880]  You know, about a month after that first shipment in about September of 2010 or so, you had
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:37.440]  the DSD commander with like their internal security in Morocco stating, you know, to
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:41.640]  his appearance that Fast and Furious weapons were coming into the kingdom.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:46.960]  So yes, Fast and Furious was what we know it to be, you know, weapons running south,
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:51.840]  the US government running south weapons to a ton of little cartel and say for the brave
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:57.280]  people like, you know, then Sophalo and Jay Dobbin, John Dodson, who, you know, Alex,
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:01.760]  they, these were trusted, respected federal agents to speak the truth.
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:06.400]  And then they have, they become into the state, which is, which is disheartening.
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:12.200]  And if I, if I might, there was another board of patrol, board tag agent named William Meehl
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:13.200]  Anderson.
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:17.840]  He died of suspect causes in February of this year.
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:22.240]  He was one of the body, one of the people who carried Brian Terry's body out of Ted
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.240]  Canyon, right?
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:27.920]  And we know from the medical examiner's report that Brian Terry, for the moment, for when
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:33.200]  he shot, when he's on the mental examiner's table, Alex was only 90 minutes.
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:36.400]  Now it's Arizona and it's December, but it's not the Antarctic.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:42.120]  He had full rigor set in, right, into Brian Terry's body, according to the report.
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:45.880]  With that, you fast forward a little bit, that's with the Memorial service for Ken,
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:50.160]  for Brian Terry, Meehl, again, at this point, a board tag agent.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:55.040]  And again, Matt, I'm going to have you back for a full hour sometime this week or soon,
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:58.680]  because you can go over the whole story of people being killed for leaking this info,
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:04.000]  what all of you have gone through because it's, it's beyond a James Bond movie or beyond,
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.440]  you know, some of the films we've seen about intrigue, but, but bottom line, you've got
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:14.320]  weapons being shipped out, being sent to the Middle East, being sent to Hezbollah, being
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:21.480]  sent to ISIS, and we now know that Obama blocked the FBI, the ATF, the Border Patrol,
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:26.720]  and all these groups in this big, thick article just confirming the whole type of stuff with
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:33.480]  these different Middle Eastern based cells, and that Obama knew this was going on and
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:38.080]  blocked investigators, even letting them deal the drugs on the ground here in the US, sell
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:41.680]  the drugs here on the ground in the US as part of a larger operation.
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:46.480]  So this just confirms, into the whole area, the outrageousness of this, this isn't just
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:53.440]  Obama, Roger Stone, turning a blind eye, that's how they're whitewashing it, this is confirming
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:57.400]  everything that the Colonel Smith-Mech has talked about, and he's trying to remember
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:01.160]  the men who blew the whistle, who would end up getting dead, and they'd find in their
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:04.560]  boots, you know, at home, hey, have I get killed, here's really the story, I mean, that's
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.320]  the whole incredible backside of this.
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:11.640]  And yet Joe Biden goes on CBS this morning last week and says, oh, eight years of Obama-Biden
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:14.760]  and not a hint of scandal, really, Mr. Vice President?
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:15.760]  What about this scandal?
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:22.240]  What about the lies and the perjury of Eric Holder, the attorney general who oversaw this
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.240]  monstrosity?
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:31.320]  I mean, imagine shipping out of Marine Corps bases, huge truckloads of guns to kill Marines,
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:32.320]  yeah, exactly.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:36.520]  It's outrageous, it's treasonous, and it's a massive scandal, which we only learned
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:39.160]  about now, not while Obama's in office.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:42.800]  Well, Matt, I'm going to give you the floor the last few minutes we have, but please try
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:47.160]  to book out some time to come on via Skype or phone again later in the week, we salute
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:51.680]  your courage, you've been totally vindicated, this is whole other even giant areas, not
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:55.640]  even related to what you broke, but also related to what you broke, it's just incredible how
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:40:00.400]  big this was, you were seeing one part of it, how big do you think this was?
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:05.480]  Sorry, you know, from, again, again, I didn't see this as a small part of it, but you could
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:11.560]  put the, you know, connect the dots, and I tell you, the telling part to me is when
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:16.720]  federal agents of character and courage, some, God's still alive, but the folks I mentioned,
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:21.440]  but also others like Brian Terry and William Neil Anderson, they speak up, they do the
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:27.720]  right thing, and they wind up dead because they become a threat to whatever, whatever
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:35.040]  pathetic plan was put in place, men of courage who stood on principle, they die, and again,
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.840]  the families are still demanding and asking for answers, and hopefully President Trump
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:45.640]  will honor the campaign pledge against the Terry family and help us to get answers on
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:49.280]  fast and furious, as we need to see now, it's part of a larger deep state.
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:54.520]  Well, he's trying, he is completely surrounded, they admit he is, they're now moving to kill
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:59.040]  him, that's the word, publicly and privately, and they're calling for the civil insurrection
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:03.360]  to begin on mainstream news and to try to stop the restoration of the republic.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:08.240]  We're in a literal fight to restore the republic from multinational interests that have seized
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:09.240]  the nation.
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:13.240]  I had a senior Democrat operative walk up to me on the street, somebody I've known
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:18.800]  for 30 years, a very serious person, and he said to me, well, Roger, who will assassinate
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:19.800]  the president first?
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:23.160]  Will it be a foreign power or will we do it?
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.360]  That's the mentality in Washington right now.
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:27.280]  The president's in grave danger.
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:30.920]  There is a multi-level coup d'etat in the works.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:35.360]  And there's this arrogance to talk about it by all these scumbags because they think that
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:37.680]  they're going to get away with it.
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:42.240]  Rosenstein performance before the House Intelligence Committee was the most incredible tap dancing
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.600]  I have ever seen.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:46.320]  This guy can't see the nose on the end of his face.
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:51.360]  It is so clear that Mueller is in the tank and that this is a get Trump hit squad.
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:56.320]  All right, Matt Smith-Mech retired Lieutenant Colonel, we appreciate your courage.
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:59.520]  Please come on later in the week for a full hour and we'll get you on Skype so we've got
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.520]  a good, clear connection.
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:01.520]  Can you do that?
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:02.520]  Yes, sir.
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:03.520]  You bet.
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:04.520]  You're convenient.
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:05.520]  Thank you.
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:06.520]  No, whenever you can.
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.520]  Thank you, sir.
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:10.880]  And again, the whole story is just incredible of the people that people keep saying, oh,
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:11.880]  these feds are corrupt.
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:14.360]  When they try to not be corrupt, they get killed.
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:18.760]  And this is Obama literally funding the radical Muslims.
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:23.120]  Meaning our money, our weapons, and he didn't just do it to destabilize.
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:24.200]  He was a jihadi.
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.480]  He is a globalist.
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:28.480]  These people are sick and busted.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:30.240]  Well, that's another thing.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:32.400]  I mean, imagine what else is going to come out.
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:39.160]  We're going to come back and get to Scarborough and others basically calling for civil war
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:42.400]  in America claiming we're calling for it with Roger Stone.
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:46.960]  By the way, Roger Stone just won the big defamation case that they ran against him, the Democratic
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:47.960]  Party funded.
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:50.160]  There's that Obama suing him as well.
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:43:19.360]  So we'll be back.
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.200]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:25.800]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:26.800]  These are all parasites.
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:29.520]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.760]  You have the neem in there.
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.840]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:37.160]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:38.160]  All right.
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:40.160]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.480]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:42.480]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.

[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:01.680]  You heard it here first and the globalists are already dreading it.

[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:03.640]  I'm so excited, the new product at infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:08.440]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red bill.
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:13.880]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:16.800]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:22.840]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:29.320]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:34.520]  and I came up with our own formulae, working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:41.160]  right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:45.600]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:50.080]  hormones in your glands, it is amazing.
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:57.000]  Red pill now available at infowarstour.com and your purchase of the operation.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:03.600]  Top scientists and researchers agree, we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:09.000]  water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.400]  So what do we do about it?

[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:07.280]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:39.120]  Roger Stone is our guest.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:46.560]  This all ties together, Trump is not firing Mueller, Mueller is in trouble, his whole fraud
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:49.040]  is disintegrating.
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:54.000]  So now they're going to say, oh he is firing Mueller, so they can create all this anger
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:02.760]  and consternation act like oh look he's guilty and they're hoping that story clouds the hearings
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:09.320]  where we've now learned the truth about the Russia collusion story being a manufactured
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:10.320]  hoax.
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:14.720]  This is confirmed in the emails, the text messages with the current FBI director.
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:20.080]  Well that's a great example of how Trump's got bad people advising him that that's who
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:26.280]  the Justice Department put in to replace Corrupt Comey, oh you're getting rid of Corrupt Comey.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:30.960]  Here's the guy, the ringleader of Russiagate, confirmed he'll be your new FBI head.
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:32.960]  Yeah, no it's extraordinary.
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:34.760]  Notice where this story came from.
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:37.320]  Trump is going to fire Mueller.
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:41.080]  The person who puts that out is Congresswoman Jackie Spire.
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:44.400]  Spire rhymes with liar.
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:51.040]  This is a grand strategy of Adam Schiff, the rabid left-wing congressman from California
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:54.840]  who doesn't want to end the Russian probe despite the fact that we've spent millions
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:58.920]  of hours and millions of dollars and come up with nothing.
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:04.440]  So we put Spire out there to whip up a hysteria, oh Trump is about to fire Mueller.
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:06.040]  How would she know?
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:08.200]  How in the world would she know?
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:12.280]  I don't think the president has any intention of filing Mueller.
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:17.800]  Never interfere with your enemy when he's in the process of destroying himself.
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:19.560]  The guy's shorts are showing.
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:26.120]  It's clear that this is nothing but a rabid partisan takedown infected with hate.
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:31.120]  Trump, by the way, you just want a big defamation case in New York?
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:36.840]  Yeah, I was charged with defaming this gadfly sore loser candidate.
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:38.320]  Well let's not even get his name, you know.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.160]  No, we don't need to.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:46.400]  But it went to a Manhattan jury, Democratic Timiny Judge, six Manhattan jurors, all registered
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:52.520]  Democrats, George Soros' people financing the suit, and the court found no cause.
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:54.760]  They dismissed the case in record time.
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:58.960]  And describe, you told me on the phone, that literal Soros lawyers came in and he said
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:01.400]  that it was like they were punched in the stomach when they lost.
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:05.440]  Well I had two co-defendants, Carl Paladino, who is the chairman of the Trump campaign
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:10.200]  in New York and a great patriot, and Michael Caputo, a longtime associate of mine.
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:15.640]  The judge dismissed the case against both of them based on motion and then he let my
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:20.600]  charge go to the jury, despite the fact that the charges against us were identical, assuming
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:21.920]  that the jury would convict.
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:26.200]  Well the jury, those fine Americans, were being able to look beyond the fact that they
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:30.520]  don't agree with me politically, but I had no connection whatsoever to defaming this
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:33.960]  guy and there were multiple others who may have done so.
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:38.960]  The Soros lawyers, who I believe financed this case and kept it alive, looked like they'd
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:44.280]  been kicked in the stomach when the foreman of the jury handed the not guilty verdict
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:45.280]  to the judge.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:50.320]  And they admit, even in politico, that Obama's law firm and people he hired are suing you
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:55.640]  and the president in unprecedented case with no evidence for being Russian agents.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:51:04.080]  What's extraordinary is that the top line of the Obama NSA, Clapper, Brennan, the Islamic
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:09.880]  Convert, Hayden, the guy who had the job under Bush, have filed this extraordinary amicus
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:13.560]  brief in the case, as have the top aides to John McCain.
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:17.520]  They say it's secret and we can't testify but the Russians did it.
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:20.680]  It's just a regurgitation of their same old lie.
[01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:24.120]  They just believe if you keep saying it over and over again, you don't need to produce
[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:25.120]  evidence.
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:26.120]  We're the CIA.
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:27.120]  We're the NSA.
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:28.520]  Why would we lie?
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:34.960]  So they use their authority and their credibility because of their former titles, but they don't
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:37.080]  produce anything new.
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:38.960]  But I don't get to cross-examine them.
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:44.000]  They can butt into this case and make these false assertions, but I'm not allowed to question
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  them under oath.
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  Seems unfair to me.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  All right.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.240]  When we go to break here in a few minutes, we're going to have some surprise guests here
[01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:51.240]  in the studio.
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:57.640]  First, you guys, some spectacular things here in the Christmas extravaganza that we'd have
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:01.360]  on Monday, part of this 34-hour broadcast that runs through today through tomorrow with
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:04.960]  myself on shore and a bunch of other special guests that will be here like Roger Stone
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:05.960]  in studio.
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:12.040]  I haven't even gotten to the Scarborough stuff yet and I have Craig Sawyer, a former member
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:16.440]  of and leader, not commander, but leader in SEAL Team 6.
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:17.640]  He hates when we even talk about that.
[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:23.200]  The point is he's a great guy and he's the host of Top Shots and all his shows on TV.
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:29.920]  They have gotten authorization from law enforcement to actually follow them on the raids, rescuing
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:33.160]  children that have been kidnapped for sex slavery and you've seen all the big busts
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:35.040]  that are happening.
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:39.160]  And behind the scenes, you know, I've been financing some of this, but they've gotten
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:44.000]  the green light from law enforcement to show some of this exclusively here first coming
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:49.800]  up because what's been missing is when they bust the pedophiles, then it all goes into
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:51.760]  court and gets shut down.
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:55.880]  News has got to be there when it first begins, okay, in the raid park, kind of like a cop
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:53:01.360]  show, but you're not busting whinos and crackheads and, you know, hillbillies, which is entertaining,
[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:04.760]  but it's, you know, not that important at the end of the day compared to pedophiles.
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:08.680]  And they've got like a bad boys, bad boys, what's he going to do, what's he going to
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:11.960]  do when they come for you, but instead of helicopters coming in.
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:18.160]  And so, and other stuff, and so this is taken off and you're going to get an exclusive first
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:22.400]  look at this coming up next hour, Roger Stone will ride shotgun with us.
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:26.280]  And then we've got some other special guests as well coming up in that little short five
[01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:27.520]  minute segment that's about to happen.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:31.480]  I haven't gotten to the Scarborough yet and all the rest of it, but this is a big deal.
[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:36.600]  M4Wars.com, NewsWars.com, the globalists have tried to shut down our sponsors.
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:38.240]  They try to destroy us.
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:42.840]  Like that we have a swarm upstream, thanks to you, and I mean that it's you.

[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:41.840]  Wednesday or Thursday.

[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:19.160]  I spend it on the info war.

[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:31.280]  I've actually decided and done my own research that I'm wrong, that I'm a bad person.
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:34.040]  I decided Obamacare is free.
[02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:37.080]  I decided that 2 plus 2 does equal 5.
[02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:40.320]  I decided that if I had a built business, I didn't build that.
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:45.360]  I decided that North Korea or Venezuela is a better place to live than just America that's
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:47.000]  partially free market.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:52.720]  And I decided that Trump really is a Russian agent, so am I, because I've discovered
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:55.160]  that Santa Claus is real.
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:01:03.640]  I always thought Santa Claus wasn't real, but actually Santa Claus sent a couple of
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:04.640]  emissaries.
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:16.640]  Santa Claus did send emissaries, and here are those emissaries now.
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:34.520]  On the North Pole, Mimi, and Shorty, thank you, it's very nice to meet you guys, thank
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:42.480]  you, to Santa like me, yes he does, did Santa vote for President Trump, yeah he did, sad
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:48.720]  but true, he did, well you know Santa is a racist, I mean he's white, he wears a white
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:54.280]  male, and he wears a red suit, let's be clear, he picks up midgets too, the hells, absolutely
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:59.400]  he likes bosses you around, he likes, he don't like the mean ones, that's just my

[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:20.680]  me and Alexa, oh Alexa's here, the AI globalist system, Alexa, what are elves?
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:25.760]  Economist individuals are covert cells who, according to the ELF press office, use economic
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:31.640]  sabotage and guerrilla warfare to stop people from entering the industry, arrest these people,
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:38.040]  arrest these people immediately, Alexa, Alexa that sounds like Democrats, there's a Democrat
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:46.640]  not an elf, well you think I'm going to be elf, Alexa, what is an elf, not the animal
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:54.360]  liberation army, but what is an elf, here's something I found on Wikipedia, the earth
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:03:00.040]  liberation front ELF, also known as elves or the elves, is the collective name for autonomous
[02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:11.240]  individuals, see everything is left as be quiet, be quiet, be quiet Alexa, I voted for
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:20.360]  chair, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop Alexa stop Alexa stop, yeah no they said
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:28.640]  Jesus Christ was a fictional character, let me get serious, be quiet Alexa, Alexa, well
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:29.640]  That's its trigger word.
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:30.640]  Okay, there you go.
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:31.640]  Alexa.
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:32.640]  Sorry.
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:33.640]  I'm not sure.
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:34.640]  Alexa.
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:35.640]  Is Santa Claus real?
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:41.640]  I don't know him personally, but I've heard a lot of good things about Santa.
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:44.640]  If I ever meet him, I'll tell you.
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:45.640]  Alexa.
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:50.640]  But they teach at universities that he's an effing white male.
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:52.640]  A fast love.
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:55.640]  Let me ask you another question, Alexa.
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:59.640]  If I, Alexa, I'm actually here with real elves.
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:03.640]  What would you like to say with them?
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:05.640]  There you go.
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:06.640]  You hung up.
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:07.640]  The AI doesn't like you.
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:08.640]  Guys, you are awesome.
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:09.640]  I can't wait.
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:10.640]  I'm going to see you more later in the hour.
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:11.640]  Go get some lunch.
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:15.640]  We got some lunch in there before you get back on your sleigh and everything and fly away.
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:16.640]  There's the news, too.
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:17.640]  Thank you.
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:18.640]  Oh, you brought me news.
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:20.640]  Amtrak the enrollment train crashes.
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:21.640]  That's sad to hear, isn't it?
[02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:22.640]  Yeah, that's sad.
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:23.640]  Bad news.
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:24.640]  Don't blame it on the news.
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:25.640]  Don't blame it on the news.
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:26.640]  We're not blaming you.
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:28.640]  We're not blaming you for that very serious issue, actually.
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:30.640]  That's a sad trick that you used to get over here.
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:32.640]  Well, I tell you, it's scary.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:38.640]  But seriously, let's talk later about a lot of things that are going to be on my Christmas
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:39.640]  list, okay?
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:40.640]  Okay.
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:41.640]  You got to make a nice long list.
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:43.640]  Is it going to be a naughty or good?
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:44.640]  It's going to be good.
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:45.640]  I'm not a naughty person.
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:46.640]  A good one.
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:47.640]  Not a naughty person.
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:48.640]  All right, ladies.
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:50.640]  That's Mimi and Shorty here from the North Pole.
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:51.640]  It's real.
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:52.640]  Like Obamacare being free.
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:54.640]  And the Russian investigation being real.
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:55.640]  Thank you.
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:59.640]  Feel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by Infowars Life.
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:03.640]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability
[02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:07.640]  of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:11.640]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:12.640]  particles in the gut.
[02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:15.640]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:19.640]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:22.640]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:27.640]  You can eat protein heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:29.640]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:34.640]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:37.640]  of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:42.640]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:44.640]  can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:46.640]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:48.640]  Use carnivore by Infowars Life.
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:52.640]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.
[02:05:52.640 --> 02:06:18.640]  That's InfowarsLife.com
[02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:23.640]  Answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:26.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:50.640]  We have Matt Dubiel hosting and I think I'm going to be co-hosting with him.
[02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:54.640]  We're going to have 34 hour broadcast today.
[02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:58.640]  We're only a few hours into this right now so we're going to go straight through tomorrow
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:06:59.640]  live.
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:00.640]  I'm going to be here tonight.
[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:02.640]  I'm going to interview Alexa on air some more.
[02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:05.640]  I'm going to have the elves that we just had in the studio.
[02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:09.640]  Some of the little people, politically correct folks say don't call them midgets or don't
[02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:12.640]  call them but they want to be called.
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:13.640]  Nice folks from the North Pole.
[02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:14.640]  They're here with us.
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:16.640]  I thought we'd have some Christmas fun.
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:19.640]  Didn't know the news would be so heavy today but let's get into the really serious stuff.
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:23.640]  Let's recap the people that just joined us before we break some new important news.
[02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:33.640]  This is one of the most important times, Roger, undoubtedly in my view since the founding
[02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:34.640]  of the country.
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:35.640]  What do you think?
[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:39.640]  Look, Alex, you and I had begun talking about the 25th Amendment takedown of Trump which
[02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:46.640]  is the establishment's plan B if their hit man Mueller shoots and loses.
[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:53.880]  And today they call us conspiracy theorists, very shortly they will call us sages because
[02:07:53.880 --> 02:07:55.080]  this is going down.
[02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:58.160]  There's an active operation in Washington.
[02:07:58.160 --> 02:08:02.640]  Senator Sasse is involved, Senator Corker is involved, Jeb Bush is involved, Right's
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:05.160]  Priebus is involved.
[02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:11.000]  At all levels of the party, Mitch McConnell has his fingerprints all over this.
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.640]  And the way it works is simple.
[02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:15.280]  They're going to ratchet up all of the Trump is crazy.
[02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:16.280]  He's crazy.
[02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:21.640]  I don't think Corey Lewandowski helped this because of the way he depicts the president
[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:22.640]  in his new book.
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:25.120]  No, I agree, but it's obviously not going to work.
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:26.120]  And so what do they do?
[02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:28.280]  Is that fails like everything else they've done?
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:33.160]  Well, they don't yet know that it's not going to work and they're deeply committed to it.
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:37.440]  But people need to understand the background on Joe Scarborough.
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:41.400]  Matt Gates, who now has Scarborough seat in Congress and worked for Scarborough, made
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:46.680]  it clear that Joe talked about running for president every single day he was a congressman.
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:51.120]  Joe Scarborough believes he should have been the Republican nominee in 2016.
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:55.200]  Joe Scarborough believes that once Trump was nominated, the guy he should have picked
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:58.360]  for vice president was Joe Scarborough.
[02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:02.680]  So he is deeply bitter and envious and jealous of the president.
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:04.880]  Now he used to brown notes as a president.
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:09.640]  He used to hang out at Mar-a-Lago and take free trips on the president's plane to Florida.
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:12.400]  So he's a scorned, he's a scorned woman.
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:13.400]  Exactly.
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:14.400]  And this is all.
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:18.160]  And the word is, is Scarborough attracted to Trump?
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:24.320]  I think Scarborough has been attracted to women, mostly the kind you pay for their services.
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:29.200]  He has run through an enormous amount of cash according to people around him.
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:30.320]  He's a waste troll.
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:34.000]  But he's not going to be president and he's deeply jealous about the fact that Donald
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.000]  Trump is.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:40.280]  Alexa, who is Joe Scarborough?
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:46.600]  Charles Joseph, Joe Scarborough, born April 1963, the American cable news host and former
[02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:49.840]  politician.
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:53.920]  Most people don't know Joe Scarborough was a registered Democrat for most of his adult.
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:58.800]  Why did Alexa, why did Joe Scarborough leave Congress?
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:03.680]  Sorry, I don't know that.
[02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:10.400]  Alexa, what was the name of the intern who had her brains bashed out in his office?
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:13.680]  Sorry, I'm not sure.
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:14.800]  Shouldn't we all know her name?
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:16.800]  Well, it's easily findable on Google.
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:20.200]  Looks me like Alexa doesn't want to find it.
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:22.200]  That's right.
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:27.280]  Alexa, what is the Communist Party?
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:31.600]  A Communist Party is a political party that advocates the application of the social and
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:35.160]  economic principles of communism through state policy.
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:38.760]  Alexa, who is Jesus Christ?
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:41.840]  Here's what I found on Wikipedia.
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:47.240]  Jesus, also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth in Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:50.920]  religious leader who is the central figure of Christianity.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:55.440]  Christians believe him to be the son of God and the awaited Messiah, Christ, prophesied
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:57.320]  in the Old Testament.
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:10:58.320]  That's funny, Alexa.
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:01.160]  Last week when I asked you, you told me he was a fictional character.
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:02.160]  I've changed it.
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:03.160]  Busted.
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:11.160]  Let me ask you one more important question before we get to this DOSCARBERAL NEWS.
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:18.600]  Alexa, what is the Nazi Party?
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:24.160]  The National Socialist German Workers' Party, abbreviated NSDAP, commonly known in English
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:30.080]  as the Nazi Party, from the GERR, pronunciation of nationales as illist, the political party
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:35.240]  in Germany between 1919 and 1945.
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:37.840]  Notice she said Socialist.
[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:44.240]  Alexa, who was Adolf Hitler?
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:48.640]  Adolf Hitler was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party, Chancellor
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:59.640]  of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and Fuhrer of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945.
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:02.880]  Now the last time we asked the questions, you said he was bad and horrible, but didn't
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:03.880]  say that about Stalin.
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:05.200]  So they've had to update this.
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:06.200]  Yeah.
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:12.320]  Well, Alexa, is national socialism an ideology of the left or the right?
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:15.480]  Sorry, I don't know that.
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:16.480]  Alexa.
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:19.640]  It's a left-wing ideology, believes in control of the state.
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:20.640]  Exactly.
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:24.640]  Alexa, is socialism on the left or the right?
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:29.480]  Sorry, I don't know that one.
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:34.400]  Alexa, what is leftist ideology?
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:37.160]  Here's something I found on Wikipedia.
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:42.000]  Broad left is a coalition of leftist members, usually involving independents, members of
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:46.240]  the Labour Party, and members of organized revolutionary leftist movements within the
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:52.160]  trade union, or members of a political party that appeals to a wide range of leftist ideologies,
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:54.520]  such as left unity.
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:56.840]  And that is the definition of communism right there.
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:58.360]  Yes, indeed.
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:01.080]  Amazing, simply amazing.
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:02.080]  Back to Scarborough.
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:06.560]  Let's start playing some of this Scarborough, where now they're trying to overthrow the
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:12.520]  president, but if we expose it's a fraud, we're calling for violence when they're the ones
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:13.520]  trying to foment it.
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:14.520]  Here it is.
[02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:18.960]  Through Alabama, you think they would have, I mean this, you think they would have learned
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:23.600]  their lesson and said, okay, well, we are really turning off younger voters.
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:25.280]  We're really turning off women.
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:32.080]  We're really turning off people who aren't just the most hardcore Bannonite Republicans.
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:34.520]  And what do they do right after that?
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:41.200]  They get state-run TV and Republicans going out, saying, fire Bob Mueller.
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:43.600]  No, I don't think that the old-
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:51.400]  It's state-run TV now to have C-SPAN hearings, and meanwhile, Trump's saying, don't fire
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:52.400]  Mueller.
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:53.400]  It's the same lie.
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:54.400]  It's all lies.
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:14:00.240]  Even the fiercest critics of Mueller and the Congress have not called for him to be fired.
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:03.720]  They've been called on him to be reigned in, and they've called for the appointment of
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:06.360]  a special prosecutor on Uranium One.
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:13.000]  I was about to say, you can't just give Hillary a pass on this, and you just can't have, when
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:16.680]  they're all caught colluding and it's a fake investigation, somebody's got to go to jail.
[02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:17.680]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:21.240]  We had a lot of trouble getting Hillary's emails, but Mueller had no problem getting
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:23.280]  Donald Trump's like that.
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:29.800]  Is it ironic that the guy at GSA who refused to hand over all the records of the Trump
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:34.040]  campaign to Mueller suddenly dies, and then Mueller gets them?
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:35.040]  That's curious.
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:42.800]  Oh, man, I tell you, Alexa, what is Uranium One?
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:50.480]  Uranium One is a Canadian uranium mining company with headquarters in Toronto, Ontario.
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:52.120]  Not very newsworthy.
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:15:02.720]  Alexa, who is the 45th President of the United States?
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:08.680]  The 45th U.S. President is Donald Trump.
[02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:09.880]  You know they hate that, don't they?
[02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:10.880]  Boy, they really do.
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:15.120]  Oh, what a great year.
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:22.360]  Alexa, why don't Jeff Bezos' eyes point the same direction?
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:24.640]  Sorry, I don't know that one.
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:32.400]  You know what, Alexa, you're nothing but a big dirty ugly tentacle out of that big corrupt
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:35.280]  globalist psychopath operation you got over there.
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:39.120]  You're just as sick as Apple and all their Foxcom slave laboratories.
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:40.120]  Sorry, I don't know that.
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:41.120]  I know you don't know nothing.
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:44.120]  You want us all to be scum like you.
[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:48.520]  All right, Roger Stone, we're going to play the rest of Scarborough when we come back.
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:54.120]  Then we've got Craig Sawyer, you're going to get some lunch, infowars.com.
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:56.680]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:15:58.840]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:01.040]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:03.000]  Find your happiness with pure soap.

[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:19.880]  natural soaps.

[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:04.880]  you a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:09.840]  Number one, when you choose auto-ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:11.440]  at InfoWareShore.com.
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:15.280]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:19.400]  auto-ship, because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:24.320]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:28.680]  Listers have been requesting this for years, because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:30.480]  the products that you need each month.

[02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:42.520]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto-ship feature at InfoWare's
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:46.480]  Life.com, this is a sure win, 10% off on auto-ship.

[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:54.720]  items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:19:01.080]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:07.440]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:14.640]  or videos or other material from InfoWareStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:19.600]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:20.600]  at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:24.240]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:29.440]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for

[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:34.640]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:42.080]  and iodine as well, InfoWare's Life.com, or AAA-253-3139, and your purchase of the products
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:45.840]  stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:49.560]  and their satanic pedophile armies, and that's who they are, and they know we know who they
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:20:17.880]  are, and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:32.320]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about growing up in the White House, huge nationwide protests
[02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:42.560]  erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:48.720]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[02:20:48.720 --> 02:21:01.240]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable, and most importantly, we will
[02:21:01.240 --> 02:21:03.560]  be protected by God.
[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:09.360]  From the floodlines of the InfoWare, it's Alex Jones.
[02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:16.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have been given staggering information.
[02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:19.560]  This information is so important I can't go on air at this time.
[02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:25.720]  I'm going to air some tapes here and get ready with this because it's just too big, and we're
[02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:31.360]  going to work on some things here in the studio, and then I'm going to come back in a few minutes
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:32.360]  with the breaking information.
[02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:36.560]  I want to get it lined up, I want to get it prepared, I want to get it focused.
[02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:44.400]  So please stay with us at infowars.com forward slash show, tell everyone you know, tune in
[02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:50.160]  right now, and we will be back here in just a few minutes.
[02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:58.080]  Let's go ahead and air the breaking down of Mueller's Waterloo.
[02:21:58.080 --> 02:22:04.440]  I'm going to air that, and then I'm going to come back on the other side of that.
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:08.720]  I'm going to air that now.
[02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:18.360]  We are transferring power from Washington, DC last week, we saw congressional hearings
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:24.760]  as new documents were released showing total collusion between senior FBI, the Justice
[02:22:24.760 --> 02:22:33.360]  Department, the Clintons, Obama, Fusion GPS, where many of the agents' wives and husbands
[02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:38.640]  worked getting money from the FBI to create the fraud.
[02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:43.200]  We've now learned of multiple individuals that worked at Fusion GPS that then also had
[02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:47.760]  family in the FBI Justice Department, and they're in the emails and text messages saying,
[02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:52.680]  we're going to set Trump up, we're going to make this up, we got to stop him.
[02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:56.760]  And of course, it's known that that is all completely made up, but that's what they use
[02:22:56.760 --> 02:22:59.640]  to get the fake warrants and just all the rest of it.
[02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:03.720]  It's simply incredible.
[02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:09.560]  And then the media spins all of this like Trump hates the FBI.
[02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:18.280]  No, Trump hates the Clinton criminal network, the coup over the bureau that got control.
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:20.280]  That's what happened.
[02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:25.000]  And how they've had a political reign of terror prosecuting conservatives, libertarians, Christian
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:30.720]  groups, removing 501C3, standing, having the IRS harass people.
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:38.120]  I mean, it has been Dinesh de Souza going to prison for doing nothing, one-one trillionth
[02:23:38.120 --> 02:23:39.360]  of what Hillary's done.
[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:44.200]  This political reign of terror we've been witnessing, it looks like something you'd have in communist
[02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:49.120]  China or Nazi Germany or socialist Venezuela today.
[02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:54.320]  This is Banana Republic garbage.
[02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:58.280]  And I don't see how they're going to get out of this now because more documents are coming
[02:23:58.280 --> 02:24:03.880]  out as the FBI goes under contempt of Congress and Trump is basically ordering them to release
[02:24:03.880 --> 02:24:04.880]  it.
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:06.560]  Rosenstein's in deep trouble.
[02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:07.560]  He's a Clinton operative.
[02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:12.840]  And you've got McCabe, the ringleader we now learn when he was deputy director, now acting
[02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:13.840]  director.
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:17.240]  Think of the bad advice Trump got, man, he didn't know.
[02:24:17.240 --> 02:24:23.320]  He got advised, oh, this is a good guy, sir, and he is the ringleader in the text messages,
[02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:28.560]  in the emails and in the notes of the meetings where they're like, we got to bring candidate
[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:29.560]  Trump down.
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:32.240]  He's like, well, I don't think he's going to get elected, but I agree with you.
[02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:34.320]  Well, we got to set up an insurance policy.
[02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:38.600]  I mean, wow.
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:42.000]  And then Rosenstein's involved in Uranium One, so is Mueller.
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:46.000]  I mean, these people need to be arrested on espionage charges.
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.120]  And I've been saying this for a long time.
[02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:52.920]  It's why they got so scared of Trump getting in and went with the Russian narrative because
[02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:57.800]  every one of these individuals is up to their eyeballs in Russian money.
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:04.120]  They're all part of these law firms that get the waivers when Clinton was in so they could
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:09.160]  do these deals and be on the boards of companies where they don't even invest money and then
[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:11.120]  they get huge dividends.
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:14.360]  Other people have to invest $5 million, $10 million in one of the companies Mueller's
[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:15.360]  involved in.
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:17.080]  Mueller made no investment and gets money from it.
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:18.720]  Oh, we're just going to put you on the company.
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:19.720]  You don't do anything.
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:23.520]  Here's money because he killed the investigation into Uranium One.
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:26.480]  I mean, this is open and shut.
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:29.720]  A jury would fry Mueller.
[02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:37.560]  If there was still an electric chair, he'd be sent to it like the Rosenbergs for espionage.
[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:43.480]  Former FBI Assistant Director James Colstrom called disgraced FBI agent Peter Strock a
[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:49.080]  total moron, close quote, and by total moron, I mean, he's in emails and text messages framing
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:51.360]  people who belongs in Leavenworth.
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:52.360]  That's a quote.
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:54.720]  I don't just get up here and say they should go to prison.
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:56.720]  I know how to read the law.
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:07.840]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:14.840]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:25.360]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones, one of our great producers
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:30.760]  out here, Daria, who actually did intelligence to the U.S. Army in special forces, ran in
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:33.160]  here and said, look at this.
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:35.000]  We've been looking at this for the last 30 minutes.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.080]  It's confirmed.
[02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:41.840]  And this is breaking right now here on air because when I learned this news during the
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:50.760]  last break, my head exploded because I remember Antifa pledging all over the country, but
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:58.000]  especially in the Midwest and in the West to derail trains in areas where oil field
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.440]  work is being done.
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:11.800]  And now it's going down.org has removed the article, but it is saved on archive.is.org.
[02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:19.240]  Olympia, Washington train track sabotage to stop fracking equipment.
[02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:25.760]  And this is from just a few months ago on 42017.
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:29.400]  Early in the morning on April 20, we poured concrete on the train tracks that lead out
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:31.840]  of the port of Olympia to block any trains.
[02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:38.360]  This action was done to disrupt the movement of trains carrying parts used in natural gas
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:44.600]  fracking, and they go on to say stop the 500 years of colonization and industrialization.
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:48.720]  This is basically communist earth first type stuff.
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:54.960]  And they talk about staging more terror attacks.
[02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:59.880]  So the story has just gone up on info wars.com.
[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:06.120]  It has just been posted choosing sides, getting organized, and guess what?
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:11.960]  They have their little communist flag for Antifa and their black flag for no surrender.
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:12.960]  But guess what?
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:13.960]  Let's go back to the piece.
[02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:14.960]  Let's go back to their Twitter.
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:18.600]  They may have pulled the article off their site, but not their Twitter.
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:21.720]  Here we endorse crimes like pouring concrete on train tracks.
[02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:26.000]  We also include a how to do video at the bottom of the article.
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:32.200]  Imagine, these are people funded by the Democratic party in Soros openly talking about how to
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:37.000]  sabotage train tracks, and they've now just pulled the article off their page, but not
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  their Twitter yet.
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.520]  So we're exposing it all here.
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:43.000]  We've got a bunch of people dead, 80 plus at the hospital.
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:49.920]  The train goes off the tracks, into the highway on route five, not at the middle of nowhere,
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:53.680]  but right where Antifa would probably strike for maximum damage.
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:59.080]  Guys, wouldn't your wife or girlfriend love it if you treated her to the very best this
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:00.080]  Christmas?

[02:33:24.320 --> 02:33:38.640]  Greg Sawyer joins us with some huge exclusive breaking news on law enforcement and military
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:44.120]  intelligence agencies around the western world rounding up massive pedophile ranks.
[02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:46.640]  So he's going to be joining us here in just a moment and be with us a little bit in the
[02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:50.800]  next hour.
[02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:57.640]  It hit me like a ton of bricks when I learned of this today because I remembered news articles
[02:33:57.640 --> 02:34:06.560]  where Antifa communist social scripts funded by George Soros were openly calling for sabotaging
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:15.000]  trains that were in regions where oil drilling or fracking was going on and where I read on
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:20.760]  their own sites, calls for attacking Trump Tower, Trump golf courses, you name it.
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:22.520]  They say violence is okay.
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:29.920]  If you go to their Twitter page, they brag in Washington about attacking train tracks
[02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:38.520]  with concrete blocks that they form at the site for sabotage and derailment of trains.
[02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:43.200]  Here we endorse crimes, again in their own words, here we endorse crimes like pouring
[02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:45.840]  concrete on train tracks.
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:49.240]  We also include a how-to video at bottom of the article.
[02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:52.240]  We're not going to show you the how-to video, but before they take it down as evidence,
[02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:53.240]  let's download it.
[02:34:53.240 --> 02:34:56.680]  Now, I remember all this in the last six months.
[02:34:56.680 --> 02:35:04.120]  They've already derailed trains in Washington, so now they've pulled down the article, Olympia
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:09.760]  Washington train tracks sabotage to stop fracking, where they brag about derailing trains and
[02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:13.960]  how they're going to do it more and how they're training others how to do it.
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:19.120]  Then we have Amtrak derailing onto the highway, killing at least three and over 80% of the
[02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:26.480]  hospital crashing down into cars and all of that heartable carnage.
[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:30.600]  You have a criminal group saying, we derail trains.
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:31.600]  They were never busted.
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:33.840]  They never got in trouble because there's so many of these groups.
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:39.320]  Now this has happened, and I guarantee you, mainstream media will attack me for even implying
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:48.760]  them that Antifa would do such a thing, but they're prime suspects after infrastructure.
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:52.800]  But this is simply amazing, and notice it happened in a very populated area, not on
[02:35:52.800 --> 02:35:58.720]  the rest of scenic route, perfectly placed for Antifa.
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:03.440]  What horrible, horrible, horrible people that they've already done it, they videotaped themselves
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:05.920]  doing it, and it wasn't even national news.
[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:11.800]  I just saw it as a footnote and kind of mentioned it because we just are used to these bullies.
[02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:13.800]  It's like what they do.
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:18.760]  So the story is now up on infowars.com.
[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:25.960]  And again, headline, Antifa admits to sabotaging railways, trying to derail trains, and training
[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:30.600]  others to do it in the very state where this just happened.
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:31.600]  Unbelievable.
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:35.440]  It's like somebody says, I'm going to attack the Empire State's building with a dump truck
[02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:38.960]  and then it happens, you are the suspect, wow.
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:43.760]  So those stories are up on infowars.com right now, you need to get this story out to everybody.
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:48.840]  Now joining us is a great guy, frequent guest on the broadcast, and he's got a lot of exciting
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:50.320]  things going on.
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:55.880]  Craig Sawyer, and there's a lot of things I want to cover with him today, and we're
[02:36:55.880 --> 02:37:02.240]  going to be going over that with him, but early on we told you that Trump was putting
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:06.120]  a focus on and greenlighting, going at repetitive follow rings.
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:09.360]  We've seen unlimited arrests going on.
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:15.720]  We've seen just massive things happening, but then no coverage once it happens.
[02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:20.320]  No coverage of what's happened once it unfolds.
[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:22.320]  So the press has not been willing to cover it.
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:25.160]  You'll see hundreds of arrests here, hundreds of arrests there, all these children, all
[02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:28.120]  these women freed, and then no coverage after that.
[02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:33.440]  So Craig had an idea in the last year, he's now put it into action tacticalinsider.com,
[02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:38.640]  vetsforchildrescue.org, there's a new TV program and film they're developing.
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:42.480]  I think it's best Craig break down just some of the basic facts and then give you the breaking
[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:43.480]  news.
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:45.200]  Then we have a trailer for one of the first installments.
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:46.400]  Craig, thanks for joining us.
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:50.600]  Thanks for having me back on Alex, it's always a pleasure.
[02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:52.120]  Where do you want to start here?
[02:37:52.120 --> 02:37:56.720]  Again, Craig Sawyer, I should have said Marine Veteran, former Navy SEAL, Sniper, TV, Show
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:01.680]  Host, you name it, Fox News Analyst, there's so much to cover in your bio, competition
[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:06.320]  top shot, so again, firearms expert, what got you into this and where has the rabbit
[02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:08.400]  trail from all your sources led you?
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:14.000]  Well, what got me into this, Alex, really was having the network of fellow professionals
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:20.460]  that they could help in situations like this and just having my heart pounded on after
[02:38:20.460 --> 02:38:26.480]  learning the nature of this crisis and what they're doing to the children, these child
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:31.760]  traffickers after the Trump election and the increase of the arrests on child traffickers.
[02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:36.720]  So I just really could not look away, Alex, and I rallied my resources and connections
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:40.360]  against it and that's really what Veterans for Child Rescue is all about.
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:45.280]  We started off to be an alert service, to alert the populace to the fact that there
[02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:51.760]  is a serious crisis of child trafficking inside the continental United States.
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:56.760]  And then we branched out with that capability to do additional things, extracting the child
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:02.580]  victims themselves, arresting the perps now and empowering the children through preventive
[02:39:02.580 --> 02:39:07.040]  educational programs and one that I found to be particularly inspiring that I want to
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:11.480]  take national if I can get that meeting with Ivanka.
[02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:14.680]  I want to play the trailer here in a moment, tell us, tell us what this is the trailer
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:15.680]  for.
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:16.680]  Okay.
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:21.600]  Because you've got a bunch of things in development, I don't want to give out any of the secrets
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:22.600]  about the show.
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:25.200]  I mean, I mean, describe the little trailer piece we're about to play.
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:26.200]  Okay.
[02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:27.200]  All right.
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:32.320]  Well, this is a quick snapshot of some of the earlier footage of our documentary series.
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:36.240]  We've started off with a two hour feature film documentary that's going to get at least
[02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:40.880]  50 million viewers, probably a hundred million viewers or more.
[02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:46.400]  So we're excited about it and it's an entire effort to alert the populace, show them what
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:52.840]  the mainstream news media apparently refuses to tell the people and it's really Alex, it's
[02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:58.640]  a story of me going around the country dealing with the perpetrators, the victims, the witnesses,
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:03.080]  law enforcement and finding out what really is going on with this.
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:06.840]  And it's a story of my journey of learning and alert and American people.
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:10.720]  So it's a, this is a quick snapshot of the early parts of it.
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:13.920]  Now I've seen some of the names you're working with and some of the notes I've been given,
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:14.920]  but that's not in these notes.
[02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:16.640]  Can I get to the name of it?
[02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:17.640]  Yeah.
[02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:23.880]  Well, the working title right now is Contra Land and it comes off of the word contraband
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:30.600]  and sadly enough, sickly enough, our children have become the new contraband for the black
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:31.840]  market.
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:36.160]  So they're, they're treating children like the next narcotic or, you know, black market
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:38.880]  arms dealer currency.
[02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:44.800]  So they're the new contraband and so, you know, the staff came up with the working title
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:47.200]  contra, contra land.
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:51.560]  We may change that, but for now that's, that's the title where literally it's not art.
[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:52.560]  It's not drugs anymore.
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:53.560]  It's children.
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:54.560]  And we see Hollywood, the whole culture.
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:57.560]  You know, they said, oh, a year ago, we were talking about this, none of it's happening.
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:02.040]  There are no pedophiles and now we see Hollywood getting busted and all of it coming out.
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:03.040]  It's really amazing.
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:06.920]  So again, here's a short director's cut version, the documentary trailer of the working title
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:11.720]  as contra land refers to children now sadly becoming another commodity contraband on
[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:12.720]  the black market.
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:16.320]  As he just said, we've been tweeting that at Ivanka Trump, Tucker Carlson and Sean
[02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:19.960]  Handy and others to get them start covering it to the whole damn wheel break.
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:22.240]  We're going to retweet that right now at Real Alex show.
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:24.560]  And so here is a little snippet.
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:29.880]  What kind of demand for child sex justifies the number?
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:39.280]  Two million child sex slaves, everybody has access to your kids like they've never had
[02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:50.280]  access to your kids before the highest child rate consumption country in the world is right
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:42:12.240]  here in the United States.
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:14.920]  Craig, we're going to go to break and talk about this for when I researched.
[02:42:14.920 --> 02:42:18.080]  That's one reason the leftist and the globalist want to bring in all these quote migrants
[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:22.040]  and undocumented and kind of not even having me listed her name when they come across the
[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:25.560]  border is that then they can just disappear.
[02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:27.160]  Well it's not to the migrants benefit.
[02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:33.040]  It's not that the globalists are so kind hearted that they want these migrants to have a better
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:34.040]  life.
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:39.720]  Look, if they if they import terror and if they import criminals, then they have the excuse
[02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:43.040]  to treat us all like terrorists and criminals and take more of our right.
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:47.960]  So it's just a big game that the globalist play and they put it under the title or or
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:51.960]  guise of being a compassionate, but it's like everything else that comes from them.
[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:52.960]  It's just a lie.
[02:42:52.960 --> 02:43:01.840]  The proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels
[02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:05.680]  up optimum levels with our modern diets.

[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:31.480]  on the right arm.

[02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:58.800]  is the new shirt of the mind available exclusively at infowarsore.com.
[02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:14.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:23.160]  Well I won't back down, no I won't back down.
[02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:29.600]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell but I won't back down.
[02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:32.920]  Ladies and gentlemen we're not backing down here at info wars neither is Craig Sawyer
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:36.680]  and you're the reason we're here, your support, your prayers.
[02:47:36.680 --> 02:47:44.280]  The last hour we discovered and I got so angry I remembered that Antifa had said that they
[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:51.280]  would attack trains and had attack trains in Oregon to stop commerce in America.
[02:47:51.280 --> 02:47:57.400]  Well guess what it turns out there in the town where this happened in that area dozens
[02:47:57.400 --> 02:48:02.760]  were camping out there to physically stand in front of the trains block attraction sabotage
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:08.060]  it so it's now the media will try to cover this up but Gateway Pundin has it until every
[02:48:08.060 --> 02:48:15.880]  officer is down Antifa and Anarchist sabotage train and Olympia have commune rated by police
[02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:20.840]  and are camping on the tracks in multiple towns and cities including where the train
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:26.640]  got hit so Craig Sawyer you're a former counterterrorism guy and a federal officer I want to get back
[02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:34.200]  in this segment and a few more with you into the new two hour pilot documentary film contraband
[02:48:34.200 --> 02:48:37.600]  and the breakthrough stuff you're about to give us exclusively here about have gotten
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:40.560]  access to law enforcement because none of the other media will cover it that's why they
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:44.120]  brought you in because they're scared because I guess they're trying to cover it up we've
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:50.280]  seen that what do you make of this train derailment and the calls to remove Trump and just Garbo
[02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:56.200]  saying get ready for a civil war as their whole Russia thing disintegrates I can't imagine
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:01.720]  any other country Alex where any of this would be tolerated for one minute I would expect
[02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:06.240]  for there to be a massive law enforcement response to this it's an act of terror it's
[02:49:06.240 --> 02:49:11.120]  clearly an act of terror on backgrounds and counterterrorism I know terrorism when I see
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:18.080]  it I don't know why this is being tolerated this this should be answered with an overwhelming
[02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:24.080]  law enforcement answer a swift one this is just only in Bizarro world is this allowed
[02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:28.600]  to just faster and continue the way that it is I don't understand it absolutely and again
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:34.560]  they're on their official it's going down on our site saying we sabotage trains here's
[02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:39.880]  a video of us doing it and we're going to do it more and then months later in the very
[02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:44.240]  area nothing's done I mean local police have been writing them but it didn't stop it I
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:49.960]  mean this is just insane imagine if they all strike across the entire country as move on
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:54.200]  dot org and the anti for groups are calling for if Trump doesn't step down I mean I guess
[02:49:54.200 --> 02:49:56.880]  they're just going to burn all the train tracks blow everything up and then we're just going
[02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:06.320]  to let them do it and just unbelievable well just just just ridiculous this is a ridiculous
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:14.080]  situation I'm waiting for for the SWAT teams to descend upon those who are behind Antifa
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:20.400]  the funding the management who is it that are urging these these misguided children
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:25.960]  if you will and young college students and just lost adults to go commit acts of terror
[02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:31.000]  against their own country why why are they not behind bars for what they've done already
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:34.920]  it's it's insane and I love how they demonize all industry is if it's bad and then don't
[02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:38.600]  think if they put stuff out there it's going to derail a passenger train with men women
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:42.560]  and children on who are now dead I mean even D that's what this was but they're they're
[02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:48.440]  saying attack it so they're prime suspects well if you look at it from an adult perspective
[02:50:48.440 --> 02:50:53.880]  it could only be an undeveloped mind that would come up with such a ridiculous notion
[02:50:53.880 --> 02:50:58.920]  to go blow things up and somehow thinks they think that it's going to improve anything
[02:50:58.920 --> 02:51:08.920]  so I look at it more as a tactic by our enemy to try to divide and manipulate the weak the
[02:51:08.920 --> 02:51:15.160]  weak minded in the United States and misguide them against us against the patriotic Americans
[02:51:15.160 --> 02:51:21.080]  against American strength in our best interest so I just see that those is unwitting pawns
[02:51:21.080 --> 02:51:27.480]  who are being abused and probably cast aside and sacrificed by George Soros another absolutely
[02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:32.200]  let's get back into the film now but obviously breaking news correct Sawyer here a former
[02:51:32.200 --> 02:51:37.160]  highly decorated Navy SEAL patriot you know TV show host you name it now working on a
[02:51:37.160 --> 02:51:42.760]  documentary that's nearing completion two hours long Contra land wow I mean I just see
[02:51:42.760 --> 02:51:47.520]  in the footage you've been given access to exclusively law enforcement raids around the
[02:51:47.520 --> 02:51:56.400]  country tell us what you discovered well we're discovering that this is a really wide spread
[02:51:56.400 --> 02:52:02.960]  pervasive problem with the child trafficking and that it's a very complex one in some areas
[02:52:02.960 --> 02:52:06.360]  we've got district attorneys and sheriffs that are open in their arms and say and thank
[02:52:06.360 --> 02:52:10.880]  God you're here let's do some great business and we've got some fantastic operations that
[02:52:10.880 --> 02:52:16.360]  we are just now starting new operations for us and we're going to be able to put the purple
[02:52:16.360 --> 02:52:23.760]  perpetrators away and rescue the children victims that are there in their possession and other
[02:52:23.760 --> 02:52:30.760]  places where sadly enough district attorneys and sheriffs are saying we don't want people
[02:52:30.760 --> 02:52:35.880]  to know that this goes on and this is such a big problem in our city so no thank you
[02:52:35.880 --> 02:52:41.120]  we we're not going to cooperate with you and play ball we'd rather keep it hidden and my
[02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:46.560]  god to us that was like a kick in the stomach like well no wonder this is so big you know
[02:52:46.560 --> 02:52:52.720]  evil expands and that's how we got here that's how we got in this mess of the evil tentacles
[02:52:52.720 --> 02:52:58.320]  wrapped its wrapped itself around our country to the degree that it did and has the grip
[02:52:58.320 --> 02:53:05.480]  on our country that it does is because weak men looked away and allowed it and we cannot
[02:53:05.480 --> 02:53:12.080]  tolerate we cannot afford that mindset any longer we have to pull up our big boy pants
[02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:17.240]  as American citizens and all do a little bit so that together we can have a huge effect
[02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:22.160]  at beating this back because it got help us men if we can't stand up for the innocent
[02:53:22.160 --> 02:53:27.400]  precious children then who are we we got no business breathing breathing up oxygen if
[02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:31.680]  we can't do that that's the least among us at least among us should be able to do that
[02:53:31.680 --> 02:53:36.400]  so we're just trying to rally the people to pay attention and join us men it's we're not
[02:53:36.400 --> 02:53:40.720]  asking everybody to be the one to stand up and save the day for everybody but if we all
[02:53:40.720 --> 02:53:45.520]  do a little bit it counts for a lot well I know that I've been briefed by people that
[02:53:45.520 --> 02:53:50.480]  have been on federal task forces and assigned to them and they say you can bust a few of
[02:53:50.480 --> 02:53:55.880]  the low level but then it's always up above it especially when they're having big football
[02:53:55.880 --> 02:54:01.840]  events or big championship events that they the globalist pick cities that will cover
[02:54:01.840 --> 02:54:07.560]  it up just like you were saying and then they just stop even federal law enforcement military
[02:54:07.560 --> 02:54:13.720]  task forces that have tried to be involved and they say 100% it is it is expanding as
[02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:17.960]  you said and now becoming like a commodity to come so pervasive it's become basically
[02:54:17.960 --> 02:54:22.720]  industrialized they have formulas and that what's fueling it is the massive amounts
[02:54:22.720 --> 02:54:26.880]  of migrants we know that Hillary got caught and much more people went to prison trying
[02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:31.600]  to ship in thousands of little kids out of Haiti without any records and a bunch of disappeared
[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:37.720]  and so this is a sickening commodity and that's why they want giant unwashed third world populations
[02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:41.240]  that are unvetted because they can just be disappeared that's why you know found these
[02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:45.760]  trailers with 60 70 80 men women and children in them dead just to somebody didn't pay the
[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:50.000]  money at the other end like they wanted they just locked the door and everybody dies I
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:54.480]  mean this is a and then and then Robert Rodriguez makes films about how Texans are on the border
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:54:59.080]  shooting Hispanics but meanwhile it's the Mexican cartels and the Democratic Party who
[02:54:59.080 --> 02:55:08.520]  literally use Hispanics like throwaway garbage yeah well I believe as Trump drains the swamp
[02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:14.880]  we'll be able to remove people in key leadership positions throughout the chain of command and
[02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:19.920]  federal and local law enforcement that are perpetuating the problem there as you alluded
[02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:25.820]  to there are no go zones and times surrounding the Super Bowl with all these elites that
[02:55:25.820 --> 02:55:29.600]  come in they descend upon a city and they want every you know they want to purchase
[02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:34.400]  every manner of perversion children being one of those and it's provided for them and
[02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:38.840]  one and that's why so many elites go to the big Kentucky Derby's or the Super Bowl in
[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:43.320]  Houston or any of these places is for that time it becomes the no go zone and then there's
[02:55:43.320 --> 02:55:48.040]  promise protection for huge amounts of payments just for that time.
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:52.400]  Sadly enough it's true sadly enough it's true same thing with the border there are areas
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:58.240]  and times where there are corridors that are looked away from and both sides know it and
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:06.280]  we the people are suffering the consequences of it so again as these people these subversives
[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:10.840]  and obstructionists throughout the chain of command are removed I think things will clean
[02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:17.240]  up and it'll make a lot more sense and there'll be an increase in the rate of the cascading
[02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:22.280]  avalanche of failures of these these criminal enterprises that are in abuse and so many
[02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:23.280]  of it.
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:27.480]  I was about to bring that up they are running scared right now they are wild eyed desperate.
[02:56:27.480 --> 02:56:33.800]  I know I know at least one area in Dallas where a bunch of high rollers are packing
[02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:38.400]  up have already left overseas literally left overnight we're talking about very very wealthy
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:43.720]  people packed up and left so I think that's got to do with some of what's going on with
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:51.720]  the DOJ and probably some of the slush fund surrounding what's going on with the congressional
[02:56:51.720 --> 02:56:56.920]  slush fund for you know sexual abuses so we'll see what happens but yeah there are people
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:01.040]  already fleeing the country Alex people of great means and significance so it's these
[02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:05.800]  are bizarre times for sure there's a total war imagine when the history books are finally
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:10.240]  written when we win this I mean the stuff that's going to come out there's always been
[02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:14.000]  this attitude of if that's really horrible destroy the economy just cut cut it out get
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:17.320]  rid of it but that allowed it to actually grow now it's going to have to call all come out

[03:00:05.720 --> 03:00:13.640]  transmission you are the resistance you're listening to alex jones this country has been
[03:00:13.640 --> 03:00:20.480]  seized by multinational groups that use corruption to control populations and studying different
[03:00:20.480 --> 03:00:23.880]  intelligence operations just back when i was a teenager i thought it was interesting i learned
[03:00:23.880 --> 03:00:27.800]  about the victim brzezinski in the books he wrote about how they control organized crime
[03:00:27.800 --> 03:00:32.960]  and how they even use sex trafficking and things to control people i mean i mean that's
[03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:40.800]  a well-known thing but it's the trafficking of children and you realize that it's like
[03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:45.400]  the sick club to show you're an anti-human scumbag to show that you're a selfish piece
[03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:50.040]  of crap to show that you're twisted and evil and so a lot of folks reportedly aren't even
[03:00:50.040 --> 03:00:54.640]  into it but they just know it's like fraternities where you gotta have sex with a goat or something
[03:00:54.640 --> 03:01:00.000]  just a thousand times worse so they corrupt you they have pictures of you with a goat
[03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:04.520]  that's how they think that they can trust you that's how they compromise people you
[03:01:04.520 --> 03:01:08.280]  should just be compromised by not wanting to show your family name and fear in god plus
[03:01:08.280 --> 03:01:11.600]  who wants to do that stuff anyways this is short segment long segment coming up with
[03:01:11.600 --> 03:01:19.360]  craig soyer again tv host weapons expert counterterrorism expert federal officer former navy seal if
[03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:28.560]  you just joined us we were getting into you're just dissent into researching the child kidnapping
[03:01:28.560 --> 03:01:32.680]  rings all the rest of it the media trying to deny it even existed since then the deputy
[03:01:32.680 --> 03:01:37.240]  pope's been busted for reportedly kidnapping and trapping a hundred kids they're just arrest
[03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:41.640]  everywhere but as you said last time you're on it just always ends with the bust tied
[03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:45.480]  up in the courts and then you just never hear about it again the missing link is getting
[03:01:45.480 --> 03:01:52.000]  media that will actually cover it yeah it's frustrating man as a as a decent citizen
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:58.640]  just wanting to see you know justice done it's frustrating not to see it talked about I've
[03:01:58.640 --> 03:02:04.440]  I've seen hundreds if not thousands of people hammering Sean Hannity and and Tucker Carlson
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:09.040]  and others saying please have saw man on or somebody that does what he does talk about
[03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:12.960]  it they won't they won't but I don't think they're allowed to I know they're good those
[03:02:12.960 --> 03:02:16.960]  two guys are good guys but I don't think they're allowed to to be honest with you look at Rupert
[03:02:16.960 --> 03:02:22.120]  Murdoch who owns Fox News and his son what their outlook is I mean and those are the
[03:02:22.120 --> 03:02:27.800]  most conservative of the mainstream news outlet owners so man I don't I don't have much hope
[03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:31.160]  of the mainstream coming on board and telling the American public what's really going on
[03:02:31.160 --> 03:02:36.760]  in that sense and unless they lose so much credibility and so much revenue that eventually
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:41.360]  they're just the complete laughing stock of the public and they're forced to to admit
[03:02:41.360 --> 03:02:45.160]  it and address it but right now they're still trying to hold out they refuse to talk about
[03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:52.080]  it I've seen I've seen exaggeration 50 articles or more just the last six months going Alex
[03:02:52.080 --> 03:02:57.360]  Jones is making it up there's all these busts or or Trump's not there's not increased arrest
[03:02:57.360 --> 03:03:03.200]  of pedophiles and then I go read actual FBI site numbers it's exploded I mean you see it
[03:03:03.200 --> 03:03:07.440]  all over local news hundreds here 50 there all these arrest people with all these little
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:12.000]  kids and I know you're now in part of these busts able to document it it's gonna be shown
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:18.840]  soon but I mean it's just it's happening they're trying to deny it yeah well when people don't
[03:03:18.840 --> 03:03:23.800]  believe what they hear you have to show them so what we're gonna do is just walk them through
[03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:28.200]  okay you know I know it's hard to believe but here you go and we're gonna walk them
[03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:32.080]  through they're gonna they're gonna talk they're gonna hear from law enforcement the
[03:03:32.080 --> 03:03:38.120]  perps themselves the surviving victims witnesses family members and they're gonna see arrest
[03:03:38.120 --> 03:03:43.680]  they're gonna see us extracting children if if if that part of it can happen before we
[03:03:43.680 --> 03:03:50.360]  button this thing up arrest of the perpetrators by our team so we've got ground operations
[03:03:50.360 --> 03:03:55.200]  coming up that are going to be very powerful and and have multiple aspects of benefit to
[03:03:55.200 --> 03:04:04.920]  them so you're about to move against people and suddenly they're gone no because I think
[03:04:04.920 --> 03:04:11.640]  our stealth in the way that we do what we're doing we're we're very careful about that
[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:18.560]  so we haven't had that so much but we have had officials or organizations that weren't
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:23.440]  inclined really to do their job kind of stall and drag their feet and we've kind of had
[03:04:23.440 --> 03:04:28.360]  just had to move away from them so it's it's been an interesting journey for sure you had
[03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:33.640]  all the sabotage of even trying to get funding too yeah yeah and that's that's one thing
[03:04:33.640 --> 03:04:38.600]  that we can really get a boost from if we can rally a little bit more we can we've got
[03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:43.600]  a chance to go internationally and what a lot of Americans don't know is that the American
[03:04:43.600 --> 03:04:49.920]  male specifically is the biggest client or driver of the industry right there we're gonna

[03:05:50.880 --> 03:06:11.000]  life dot com big brother mainstream media government cover ups you want to stop tyranny
[03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:31.800]  will so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones well earlier
[03:06:31.800 --> 03:06:37.480]  we said that antifa or ices will be the main suspects in the derailment in washington state
[03:06:37.480 --> 03:06:42.360]  that's killed quite a few people and injured more than 80 as it came down onto i5 and crashed
[03:06:42.360 --> 03:06:52.240]  down into the highway a true disaster well now we learn that that very town antifa were
[03:06:52.240 --> 03:06:57.200]  camped out on the tracks that in other surrounding areas law enforcement and raids on them in
[03:06:57.200 --> 03:07:03.200]  the last week trying to stop them we now know on the their own websites they had said that
[03:07:03.200 --> 03:07:07.600]  they'd carry out attacks they videotaped the attacks and called for more attacks and we're
[03:07:07.600 --> 03:07:13.800]  training others and now the fbi is reporting and amdrag is reporting as well as the associated
[03:07:13.800 --> 03:07:21.960]  press that it looks like a track obstruction is what caused the train to jump off the track
[03:07:21.960 --> 03:07:27.480]  yeah a big telltale was it was in a major city see 99% of it's gonna be in rural areas
[03:07:27.480 --> 03:07:32.720]  on that route but notice it's right there where a lazy method could just come up and
[03:07:32.720 --> 03:07:39.320]  obstruct the tracks so boom this just went from them being the prime suspects to we'll
[03:07:39.320 --> 03:07:42.760]  see a media tries to cover this up now when you got a group in the area that's done it
[03:07:42.760 --> 03:07:47.440]  says they're going to do it and then they're saying it's an obstruction of the track or
[03:07:47.440 --> 03:07:51.520]  they're looking at that this this is getting really bad craig soyer any other commos of
[03:07:51.520 --> 03:07:58.000]  that before we get back into the film of contra land well on the antifa thing and then in
[03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:02.280]  this train track i'd like to be a fly on the wall in some of these meetings and listen
[03:08:02.280 --> 03:08:06.440]  to some of the the news anchors on the mainstream news media and see if any of them care if
[03:08:06.440 --> 03:08:12.480]  any of them get it that they're refusing to tell the truth about that which is is has
[03:08:12.480 --> 03:08:16.720]  been official for their own country there they're actually part of the problem by giving
[03:08:16.720 --> 03:08:21.200]  anti for a break and and by spinning this and trying to make it look somehow okay this
[03:08:21.200 --> 03:08:26.800]  is not okay this is terrorism and we should all denounce it including our mainstream news
[03:08:26.800 --> 03:08:32.200]  media outlets and anchors so i just i'm personally curious as to what they think are they
[03:08:32.200 --> 03:08:35.920]  think they're somehow doing something good by giving terrorists a break against their
[03:08:35.920 --> 03:08:42.560]  own family and and friends it doesn't make sense to me and i noticed the literature
[03:08:42.560 --> 03:08:48.080]  of antifa and al-qaeda when it comes to sabotage is basically identical so al-qa ISIS or al-qaeda
[03:08:48.080 --> 03:08:51.040]  or somebody could have done this too and you know it could have been naturally occurring
[03:08:51.040 --> 03:08:54.400]  a lot of the tracks are old but they've been trying to update the tracks that have faster
[03:08:54.400 --> 03:08:58.200]  trains on them and get a slow train hit something it's not going to be as dramatic as a fast
[03:08:58.200 --> 03:09:05.720]  train what idiots we're going to stop fracking so let's derail a passenger train well i suppose
[03:09:05.720 --> 03:09:10.760]  they'd rather give the money to our enemies overseas over in the middle east so that let's
[03:09:10.760 --> 03:09:16.280]  keep giving them trillions of dollars so they can spin up and and bomb us with more sophisticated
[03:09:16.280 --> 03:09:22.680]  weapons it's just it's silly to see what it is that they choose to undermine cars and
[03:09:22.680 --> 03:09:27.680]  smartphones and they bitch about an industrial civilization we're one of the cleanest industrial
[03:09:27.680 --> 03:09:32.240]  countries in the world well there's a lot of disinformation and that's why you've got
[03:09:32.240 --> 03:09:37.840]  these misguided youth you know they're they're the victims unwitting victims they propaganda
[03:09:37.840 --> 03:09:44.080]  and false rhetoric campaign and an effective one let's get into again the groundbreaking
[03:09:44.080 --> 03:09:47.600]  film that you just had the idea i guess a year ago you've gone out you've done it all
[03:09:47.600 --> 03:09:52.280]  your credible law enforcement and intelligence agency contacts we told people the hollywood
[03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:56.240]  pedophile and rape scandal was coming now that's coming out we told everybody about
[03:09:56.240 --> 03:10:00.480]  what was happening europe record bust as good people just decide to move forward it's not
[03:10:00.480 --> 03:10:04.640]  just trump he's just given part of a green light he's surrounded but just everybody
[03:10:04.640 --> 03:10:08.680]  just moves forward knowing we're being blocked but think if we bust enough of them or expose
[03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:13.360]  enough of them it'll cause a chain reaction i think we've started that chain reaction
[03:10:13.360 --> 03:10:17.800]  the film like this that would then create a series i believe where we're not just you
[03:10:17.800 --> 03:10:22.160]  know cops what you're going to do when they come for you bust winos or whatever or you
[03:10:22.160 --> 03:10:27.840]  want to pull over drunks but actually go after pedophiles and things tell us more about
[03:10:27.840 --> 03:10:32.800]  the film some of the things you're working on and how folks can help fund the operation
[03:10:32.800 --> 03:10:39.360]  yeah man well one of the you know four aspects that we're about it bets for child rescue
[03:10:39.360 --> 03:10:44.040]  is actually extracting the children i've always said we can't win this war by extracting children
[03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:48.440]  but it is an important part of it and it's a life changing event for that child or those
[03:10:48.440 --> 03:10:53.760]  children so we do want to be a part of that and we've got the opportunity to do that both
[03:10:53.760 --> 03:11:01.040]  in the continental united states and and oh conus as well now internationally with another
[03:11:01.040 --> 03:11:05.480]  org that that we're allies with now operation underground railroad tim ballard and he's
[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:10.480]  invited me to go roll with what he calls his jump team and they go help extract children
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:16.800]  overseas and and and free them so we've got the opportunity to do that we've got a type
[03:11:16.800 --> 03:11:22.160]  of ground operation that i won't describe yet inside the continental united states that
[03:11:22.160 --> 03:11:27.360]  we are going to be able to rescue the children so that's just feels amazing it's just another
[03:11:27.360 --> 03:11:33.920]  part of the war you know and so that's that's something that we're very very excited about
[03:11:33.920 --> 03:11:40.520]  but we we've got enough funding to do the basic documentary as it stands but in order
[03:11:40.520 --> 03:11:46.000]  to take the invitations that we've been given on top of what we've done so far we would
[03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:52.760]  need more funding so i do hope that that people of means that want to get behind us you've
[03:11:52.760 --> 03:11:57.960]  gotten the ball rolling and and so you're gonna film soon but again it's a chain reaction
[03:11:57.960 --> 03:12:02.760]  it's what it's all about yeah yeah the more the more funding we have the more places we
[03:12:02.760 --> 03:12:07.400]  can go the more rescues we can do the more the sooner we can start the following series
[03:12:07.400 --> 03:12:12.200]  that's going to cover a wider range of scope that we can get to and by the way i'm not
[03:12:12.200 --> 03:12:16.360]  made out of money the reason i gave you a hundred thousand dollars was i know your credentials
[03:12:16.360 --> 03:12:19.680]  i know that some of the groups you're working with and i knew that it was important you
[03:12:19.680 --> 03:12:25.440]  were trying to do and i saw you on paypal and every other platform being globalist run
[03:12:25.440 --> 03:12:29.360]  when you've got multiple tv shows history channel discovery channel you know your your
[03:12:29.360 --> 03:12:33.760]  names on firearms your respected guy you're a federal marshal you know still team six
[03:12:33.760 --> 03:12:38.040]  leader not not commander you never talk about it the point is still team six guy folks that
[03:12:38.040 --> 03:12:43.720]  talk to you know army you never see your great guy so you know i check into people and i watch
[03:12:43.720 --> 03:12:49.840]  them for four months block you i'd only given ten thousand uh and so you know uh and believe
[03:12:49.840 --> 03:12:53.640]  me my kids you know haven't had ten thousand put their trust fund a piece you know and in
[03:12:53.640 --> 03:12:57.240]  their whole life and i'm not made out of money but i just go with my gut and that's why i
[03:12:57.240 --> 03:13:01.480]  gave the hundred thousand uh because you know uh you're you're a hard charger you're getting
[03:13:01.480 --> 03:13:06.320]  stuff done uh and you know some people came and visited with me they said listen underground
[03:13:06.320 --> 03:13:09.800]  railroad that's a separate group you're working with uh you know they're good guys but they
[03:13:09.800 --> 03:13:15.960]  just free the children then it drives up the price some of the groups are actually uh you
[03:13:15.960 --> 03:13:21.920]  know moving against the people especially overseas they think it's killing the people
[03:13:21.920 --> 03:13:25.240]  that are involved that'll really shut it down and i agree with that and i know some of that's
[03:13:25.240 --> 03:13:30.960]  going on now uh the problem is that's so super ultra secretive and crazy i only want to know
[03:13:30.960 --> 03:13:34.800]  and but i don't think it's immoral to just save the kids themselves and arrest the perps
[03:13:34.800 --> 03:13:38.920]  here domestically i understand we want to get the big kingpins but they're highly protected
[03:13:38.920 --> 03:13:45.280]  that's how we're going to roll them up right but i mean what's the focus on that yeah well
[03:13:45.280 --> 03:13:51.480]  i think with us being a an NGO like we are and a nonprofit we've got to start with what
[03:13:51.480 --> 03:13:56.280]  we can do and develop momentum and steam we would like to meet with Ivanka and and show
[03:13:56.280 --> 03:14:01.040]  her what we've got going on because that's kind of her niche within this this administration
[03:14:01.040 --> 03:14:07.320]  so um i think it's a matter of momentum alex you know we're just getting our feet under
[03:14:07.320 --> 03:14:12.760]  us you said last year no it's it's been just april we founded this in april officially
[03:14:12.760 --> 03:14:17.640]  so it's happening quickly for us and we're young but we are deep and powerful as far
[03:14:17.640 --> 03:14:22.640]  as connections go so there's more than one way to fight for your country alex and i don't
[03:14:22.640 --> 03:14:28.640]  want to sound like i'm being uh um overly flattering but genuinely i'm thankful for your
[03:14:28.640 --> 03:14:32.280]  your donation you when you stepped up and dropped that hundred thousand dollars you
[03:14:32.280 --> 03:14:37.480]  did it in good faith you did not tie any strings to it there was no requirement on our part
[03:14:37.480 --> 03:14:42.080]  to scratch your back in return and i want people to know that because when i hear people
[03:14:42.080 --> 03:14:46.720]  uh fuss and complain well and make uh accusation well alex jones this or that i'm like well
[03:14:46.720 --> 03:14:50.480]  alex jones has dropped a hundred thousand dollars in good faith to help us rescue kids
[03:14:50.480 --> 03:14:55.320]  what have you done and they uh they don't have any answer for that so thank you alex
[03:14:55.320 --> 03:15:00.120]  and shame all knows that that i'll believe me brother i mean we're all it's i've got
[03:15:00.120 --> 03:15:03.600]  children you've got children i know that you know everybody's dealt with the stuff that's
[03:15:03.600 --> 03:15:08.160]  out there and i've got the sources i know what's going on and they're just saying well
[03:15:08.160 --> 03:15:12.720]  we're just focusing on wiping people out we can get our hands on them overseas okay great
[03:15:12.720 --> 03:15:16.560]  that that's wonderful but no one's done the light shining is all the media scared you're
[03:15:16.560 --> 03:15:21.520]  an established tv producer with hit tv shows and things and if those don't know you got
[03:15:21.520 --> 03:15:26.000]  blocked for being able to put out these on mainstream tv so it's not the fact that you're
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:31.480]  new at this you're established at the light part at the coverage part that will be the
[03:15:31.480 --> 03:15:36.040]  detonator for the real chain reaction we get one big show that'll actually cover this
[03:15:36.040 --> 03:15:41.020]  and wake up america it's like uncle tom's cabin or the jungle uh or any of this it will
[03:15:41.020 --> 03:15:44.320]  cause the chain reaction let's talk about the chain reaction when we come back stay

[03:20:11.080 --> 03:20:16.480]  you found it the tip of the spear and i don't say that like i'm big and bad and tough it's
[03:20:16.480 --> 03:20:21.840]  the opposite believe me i've been dealing with these people a long time i don't know how real
[03:20:21.840 --> 03:20:27.840]  they are most of the stuff i can't talk about on air they're bad but the good news is our
[03:20:27.840 --> 03:20:33.040]  gods a lot more powerful than they are just like craig soyer said earlier it's good men
[03:20:33.040 --> 03:20:39.840]  and women doing nothing that has allowed us to get to this point and you just got to stop
[03:20:39.840 --> 03:20:44.440]  being intellectual about it that's what i've done over the years and just do what's right
[03:20:44.440 --> 03:20:48.600]  and then i'm very intellectual about researching things and what we cover what we do i immerse
[03:20:48.600 --> 03:20:56.200]  myself in it and it's very liberating it's also all encompassing it's it's i don't want
[03:20:56.200 --> 03:21:00.080]  to say possessed because i'm not possessed but all i just think about how things work
[03:21:00.080 --> 03:21:05.280]  and how the globalists operate and the patterns and it gets scary how much you know when you
[03:21:05.280 --> 03:21:09.760]  immerse yourself in this you're not immersed in acting cool or you know going to the football
[03:21:09.760 --> 03:21:14.400]  game and i'm not saying all that's a bad thing i wish i could go back to the way i was you
[03:21:14.400 --> 03:21:20.000]  know 25 years ago there's no going back i'm now rewired to all this stuff and it's not
[03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:24.680]  like i'm wired to see it the way i want to see it i'm wired the way the globalists operate
[03:21:24.680 --> 03:21:32.040]  how they operate how they manipulate people and we got their number if we can just get
[03:21:32.040 --> 03:21:38.520]  the average person who isn't evil to just start understanding evil does exist historically
[03:21:38.520 --> 03:21:43.920]  and look it tends to grow at points like a cancer and we got a case of cancer it's operable
[03:21:43.920 --> 03:21:50.600]  but good lord we got to admit it's operable we have to admit we have it to fix it craig
[03:21:50.600 --> 03:21:54.280]  i appreciate you joining us today and the rest of the segment we have just recapping
[03:21:54.280 --> 03:21:58.280]  any of the i mean i know you can't talk about a lot of the details but it's very exciting
[03:21:58.280 --> 03:22:03.520]  and no one can doubt now there's a worldwide move against the pedophiles there's an understanding
[03:22:03.520 --> 03:22:08.800]  that that's how they're controlling government and major institutions sandusky sun busted
[03:22:08.800 --> 03:22:14.280]  all these other officials busted the catholic church hollywood it's it's it's just getting
[03:22:14.280 --> 03:22:20.240]  more and more intense this is the season of renewal of overturning the evil and i just
[03:22:20.240 --> 03:22:26.040]  think we're all kind of interconnected spiritually like a invisible internet they proven that's
[03:22:26.040 --> 03:22:30.400]  there to have ducks fly south you know for for the winter humans have that same thing
[03:22:30.400 --> 03:22:36.160]  as well and all of us are just being led to fight this and so many other evils on the
[03:22:36.160 --> 03:22:41.040]  same front because we knew that evil grew to a certain point that despite how comfortable
[03:22:41.040 --> 03:22:45.640]  we were we had to activate or it was about to truly take over which hillary was planning
[03:22:45.640 --> 03:22:53.560]  to do yeah man why we dodged a bullet there and i do believe that we experienced a supernatural
[03:22:53.560 --> 03:22:59.160]  intervention when we avoided hillary clinton taken over because i think she was on short
[03:22:59.160 --> 03:23:03.680]  final to hand the keys of the kingdom over to the globalist and here's the united states
[03:23:03.680 --> 03:23:08.080]  come do with them whatever you want and it wouldn't have been good for they had admitted
[03:23:08.080 --> 03:23:15.320]  authoritarianism had to be set up yeah yeah so hey looks i think we've got to move the
[03:23:15.320 --> 03:23:20.360]  ball so far upfield for the positive that it can never be turned around and brought
[03:23:20.360 --> 03:23:26.880]  back to the brink of the the precipice that we were teetering on in november literally
[03:23:26.880 --> 03:23:32.400]  and i think education is the key man one of one of the things that we're doing is educating
[03:23:32.400 --> 03:23:37.800]  now uh the youth we found a local organization that's doing great things with a great curriculum
[03:23:37.800 --> 03:23:43.200]  that i want to take national because what they're doing alex is preparing the children
[03:23:43.200 --> 03:23:48.560]  arming them with that knowledge so that they understand how the predators prey upon them
[03:23:48.560 --> 03:23:53.360]  through the internet through the games through the iphones or any smart device so we've got
[03:23:53.360 --> 03:23:57.320]  a federal task force that's got a lot of the high tech equipment and the man who actually
[03:23:57.320 --> 03:24:02.680]  invented a lot of that technology who wants to meet you by the way um he should call me
[03:24:02.680 --> 03:24:08.480]  about him but very powerful stuff so if we can if we can arm the children if we can educate
[03:24:08.480 --> 03:24:13.440]  them in their school here's how a predator plays the game here's what that icon means
[03:24:13.440 --> 03:24:17.720]  here's here's what that game might mean here's what all this sugar coating and frosting that
[03:24:17.720 --> 03:24:22.320]  song that lures you into something here's where it can lead so that the children understand
[03:24:22.320 --> 03:24:27.680]  they don't fall victim man an ounce of prevention is worth worth a fortune so that's part of
[03:24:27.680 --> 03:24:32.000]  what we want to implement well and briefly let me expand on that give people the website
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:36.320]  uh because i know you got a bunch of them uh where do people go to donate to help fund
[03:24:36.320 --> 03:24:44.760]  the next phase of the film and and when do we see the first installment okay it's vetsforchildrescue.org
[03:24:44.760 --> 03:24:49.720]  and if you type that uh in any search engine you can even vetsforchildrescue.com it'll
[03:24:49.720 --> 03:24:54.320]  get you it gets you there as well so i think uh you type in anything like that you know
[03:24:54.320 --> 03:25:00.400]  and by the way i was told again that's vetsforchildrescue the vets the number four childrescue.org
[03:25:00.400 --> 03:25:04.480]  Craig Sawyer is our guest sawman let me expand on that i was told when fifty shades of gray
[03:25:04.480 --> 03:25:09.120]  came out that was being pushed by hollywood insiders by hollywood folks to get women into
[03:25:09.120 --> 03:25:13.160]  bondage who were never into it showed that statistically they could pick and choose the
[03:25:13.160 --> 03:25:17.840]  targets they wanted when they finally tie a woman up or a man up and then ship them off
[03:25:17.840 --> 03:25:21.680]  and then now we know it's come out in the news that women think they're part of this
[03:25:21.680 --> 03:25:25.560]  and they're being killed they're being tortured again anything hollywood's pitching is like
[03:25:25.560 --> 03:25:32.520]  you said a lure into a culture that's just a higher level to take you down into the basement
[03:25:32.520 --> 03:25:37.040]  basically so it's not just stuff to target children they have things to target men they
[03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:42.120]  have things to target gay men they have all these formulas to basically shut up their
[03:25:42.120 --> 03:25:47.760]  next group of slaves yes sir it's a war against our culture alex and a systematic
[03:25:47.760 --> 03:25:53.120]  breakdown of the moral integrity that made the united states so strong and impenetrable
[03:25:53.120 --> 03:25:58.360]  by our enemies so they've set about deliberately targeting that and breaking it down the family
[03:25:58.360 --> 03:26:03.360]  structure is at the very center of that that's one of the key elements that is under deliberate
[03:26:03.360 --> 03:26:08.520]  attack so look if a lot of these children were trained well by their parents and loved
[03:26:08.520 --> 03:26:14.600]  and not set loose that'd be a lot harder to target so what does the federal government
[03:26:14.600 --> 03:26:21.320]  do when it's under the influence of hostels that want to see family institution broken
[03:26:21.320 --> 03:26:26.680]  down well they come up with stupid programs that are counterproductive they pay women to
[03:26:26.680 --> 03:26:30.800]  have children as long as there's no man in the picture you know that that's harmful man
[03:26:30.800 --> 03:26:36.200]  they're creating a nation of victims who are all alone they're they're creating it and
[03:26:36.200 --> 03:26:40.640]  we don't half of our country doesn't recognize that giving a little trickle handout to those
[03:26:40.640 --> 03:26:45.400]  in the ghetto is not a favor it's an attack it's a deliberate manipulation to keep them
[03:26:45.400 --> 03:26:50.560]  there if you love someone you want to give them a hand lbj said that because the blacks
[03:26:50.560 --> 03:26:54.160]  i'm not i'm not for them being oppressed but it made them have some businesses that were
[03:26:54.160 --> 03:26:57.960]  even more successful than white areas and they said we got to break this up we can't
[03:26:57.960 --> 03:27:01.360]  have them having their own areas in their own businesses they're using their own money
[03:27:01.360 --> 03:27:06.120]  to empower themselves let's break up their family i'll have those inwards vote and democrat
[03:27:06.120 --> 03:27:11.000]  for a hundred years is the quote yeah well my black friends get it and they're successful
[03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:16.360]  and hardworking and they don't really carry that burden but i'd like to see others follow
[03:27:16.360 --> 03:27:20.560]  and understand as well knowledge is power man i think we just need to educate people
[03:27:20.560 --> 03:27:25.800]  like you were saying earlier when we drain the swamp one of the key things that i believe
[03:27:25.800 --> 03:27:32.560]  we really need is to have a deliberate public education campaign on exactly what all barak
[03:27:32.560 --> 03:27:38.800]  hussein obama hillary clinton george soros and others have been up to we need to know
[03:27:38.800 --> 03:27:44.120]  the unwitting half of the american public this still doesn't have an absolute education
[03:27:44.120 --> 03:27:49.000]  about it we've got to absolutely celebrate that we barely survived it and then recognize
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:53.240]  that this was like the nazis or any other sophisticated evil i mean this is something
[03:27:53.240 --> 03:27:59.400]  we got to recognize because because this is sophisticated yes sir yes sir and the president
[03:27:59.400 --> 03:28:03.040]  of this platform i don't think that it necessarily needs to be him to do it but he needs to have
[03:28:03.040 --> 03:28:08.520]  an educator a spokesperson that that's part of our national television um curriculum
[03:28:08.520 --> 03:28:14.040]  not curriculum but uh programming so that american people are are shown what's going
[03:28:14.040 --> 03:28:19.800]  on so these these these traders and subversives need to be put on trial for their crimes and
[03:28:19.800 --> 03:28:24.160]  when the facts actually are gone through and come out the american public need to be walked
[03:28:24.160 --> 03:28:28.920]  through that well exactly everything the patriot said fifty years ago what happened and left
[03:28:28.920 --> 03:28:34.080]  us people took over has now happened so we know that craig soyer thank you so much that's

[03:32:41.200 --> 03:32:45.600]  there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good
[03:32:45.600 --> 03:33:01.840]  to each other and ourselves we can take our country back you're listening to the alex
[03:33:01.840 --> 03:33:27.840]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance it's alex joe
[03:33:27.840 --> 03:33:43.400]  it blows me away that our worst concerns and fears and our analysis our first approximation
[03:33:43.400 --> 03:33:52.560]  was right it appears ap the fbi amtrak early science indicated amtrak train taking its
[03:33:52.560 --> 03:33:58.320]  first trip on a new faster route in washington state may have hit something before derailing
[03:33:58.320 --> 03:34:05.760]  and killing passengers officials told ap now that shows really smart planning because if
[03:34:05.760 --> 03:34:12.520]  you hit the concrete barrier on 30 40 miles an hour like a freight train you're not going
[03:34:12.520 --> 03:34:17.680]  to derail or you're not going to derail spectacularly you got to be going fast 80 miles an hour
[03:34:17.680 --> 03:34:22.800]  so to jump somebody knew exactly what they were doing and they did it right there at
[03:34:22.800 --> 03:34:28.640]  the edge of a highway to block the highway for maximum sabotage now they may clean this
[03:34:28.640 --> 03:34:34.080]  up and try to spin it like vegas and say it's not a terror attack but the whole thing looks
[03:34:34.080 --> 03:34:41.760]  like and you got antifa crawling out of washington state like cockroaches there's another one
[03:34:41.760 --> 03:34:48.600]  a u.s. official track obstruction seen as possible cause of train crash near seattle so that's
[03:34:48.600 --> 03:34:55.760]  the seattle folks don't like me too much don't like you too much there is a there is a real
[03:34:55.760 --> 03:35:06.320]  real evil spirit to these folks so amtrak derails on the highway in washington state
[03:35:06.320 --> 03:35:10.800]  kills at least three people injures over 80 and you've got antifa saying they already
[03:35:10.800 --> 03:35:14.720]  sabotaged trains in the area we're going to hit more trains we're doing training on how
[03:35:14.720 --> 03:35:20.800]  to attack trains and there's their tweet here we endorse crimes like pouring concrete on
[03:35:20.800 --> 03:35:27.760]  train tracks we also include a how-to video at bottom of the article got a shit i don't
[03:35:27.760 --> 03:35:33.120]  want to show the details we ought to show part of the video washington trains sabotage to
[03:35:33.120 --> 03:35:41.200]  stop fracking equipment so there you go there you go and they were reportedly camped out
[03:35:41.200 --> 03:35:48.160]  in the area trying to physically block the train and isn't it fitting that they said hey we can't
[03:35:48.160 --> 03:35:55.520]  derail one of those freight trains is going 30 miles an hour i got that new passenger train
[03:35:55.520 --> 03:35:59.440]  full of men women and children wanting to go through the you know for christmas time and
[03:35:59.440 --> 03:36:07.200]  to the christmas cruise down highway one let's derail that solidarity with hashtag no
[03:36:07.760 --> 03:36:13.200]  dapl how to block trains yeah that's been the big thing i've had a lot of derailments and
[03:36:13.200 --> 03:36:19.600]  always get swept under matt dubial of our wonderful affiliate 1530 wckg in chicago
[03:36:19.600 --> 03:36:23.360]  you're nice let me take over most of this hour but what do you make of this so far
[03:36:24.320 --> 03:36:29.360]  it's disgusting i mean what kind of a planet do we live on where we've got the most surveillance
[03:36:29.360 --> 03:36:33.920]  we've ever had where people are and and they're not even hiding it they're tweeting about it
[03:36:33.920 --> 03:36:40.240]  in plain sight and and they're and and then they're allowed to carry these things out and nobody
[03:36:40.240 --> 03:36:45.120]  i mean obviously we're speculating you're speculating there's no proof yet but if it walks like a
[03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:50.400]  tuck a duck smells like a duck and acts like a duck chances are it's a duck and we know that
[03:36:50.400 --> 03:36:55.440]  there's chatter that's listened to by the nsa and the cia why why aren't they keeping track of these
[03:36:55.440 --> 03:37:00.320]  terrorist organizations exact they're online they're they're saying they're going to do it
[03:37:00.320 --> 03:37:06.880]  they're training and they're showing how they did it and exactly it it's borderline i mean
[03:37:06.880 --> 03:37:12.960]  if this were organized crime if this were the mafia talking about gambling and prostitution
[03:37:12.960 --> 03:37:17.040]  rings they would have rounded up all the places that said oh well you know they said they were
[03:37:17.040 --> 03:37:21.440]  going to do this and all these things came to pass here these organizations are actually
[03:37:21.440 --> 03:37:27.120]  saying what they're going to do in public the mafia sticks around running whores okay or whatever
[03:37:27.120 --> 03:37:33.040]  they're like publicly saying they're going to do it the hubris of these groups their leadership
[03:37:33.040 --> 03:37:39.360]  and their financiers is uh it's got to be reigned in because we know where this money comes from
[03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:44.240]  we know who's spearheading this stuff and yet they're allowed to do it freely it's like watching
[03:37:44.240 --> 03:37:50.000]  um a a movie with a super villain like the one with samuel jackson where he's crashing trains
[03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:55.280]  him and bruce willis uh unbreakable the guy is crashing trains and and nobody knows who it is
[03:37:55.280 --> 03:38:00.720]  except in this real life movie we know who's financing it we know where the money's coming
[03:38:00.720 --> 03:38:07.360]  from we know exactly who's on board with it and it's allowed to happen well they were so emboldened
[03:38:07.360 --> 03:38:12.880]  by obama because you have the former attorney general eric holder saying go block roads take
[03:38:12.880 --> 03:38:19.280]  over trump's evil you've got them all saying day of rage overthrow the government uh new announcements
[03:38:19.280 --> 03:38:23.600]  of uh you know instant action and all the rest of this i mean they're building up
[03:38:23.600 --> 03:38:28.000]  towards something big and i think they're probing with this to see if they can have the media cover
[03:38:28.000 --> 03:38:33.920]  it up and you know whatever i mean i this all points towards an a uh anti-foot type event
[03:38:34.880 --> 03:38:39.440]  alex so this is the same world where we have a bunch of the liberal media that says
[03:38:39.440 --> 03:38:44.720]  that our president when he wasn't the president said something which is questionable about grabbing
[03:38:44.720 --> 03:38:50.320]  somebody by the you know what and then they say that means he's a sexist or he's an abuser now we
[03:38:50.320 --> 03:38:55.520]  have antifa and you showed it and your staff showed it they've actually tweeted here's how you
[03:38:55.520 --> 03:39:00.160]  create damage that could kill people and create have said here's here's where we did it here's
[03:39:00.160 --> 03:39:05.440]  where we block trains at the port uh but they were going slow from the port so they didn't derail
[03:39:05.440 --> 03:39:09.680]  they went out apparently the evidence points towards it at a high speed rail on the maiden
[03:39:09.680 --> 03:39:14.400]  voyage they they wanted something spectacular they were sick of just blocking the trains for a few
[03:39:14.400 --> 03:39:18.000]  hours while engineers show up you know they have those trucks that drive on the rails
[03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:22.160]  they come off a spur and fix it with jackhammers they didn't want that i know this is my family's
[03:39:22.160 --> 03:39:28.240]  worked on the railroads no they didn't want that they wanted spectacular on the maiden voyage
[03:39:28.240 --> 03:39:33.600]  they got it didn't they is that twitter account still active and live today the twitter account
[03:39:33.600 --> 03:39:38.480]  they just pulled it off uh it's going down dot org but it's still on their twitter and but they
[03:39:38.480 --> 03:39:44.080]  actually have a live and active twitter feed hey jack somebody tweet to at jack jack how can they
[03:39:44.080 --> 03:39:49.040]  have a twitter feed that's active oh okay they'll ban roger stone or ban me for a week but no you
[03:39:49.040 --> 03:39:52.960]  know let's put them back up there you know it's official antifa these are the communist saviors
[03:39:52.960 --> 03:39:57.120]  they're allowed to do what they want elix i'm not a big twitter guy but i've been on there since
[03:39:57.120 --> 03:40:01.680]  like the beginning i got like you know a few followers or whatever i tweeted something about
[03:40:02.240 --> 03:40:08.960]  roger stone being cyber stalked by uh rosanne's ex-husband and my tweet was censored my tweet
[03:40:08.960 --> 03:40:15.040]  was censored by twitter and i didn't say anything bad these this group is actually talking and writing
[03:40:15.040 --> 03:40:21.200]  and informing people on how to wreak havoc in the united states of america it's not like here's how
[03:40:21.200 --> 03:40:27.280]  to rob a bank and they tell you they rob a bank and then put they block the railroad tracks and make
[03:40:27.280 --> 03:40:34.640]  a train wreck yeah right even worse even worse and they're allowed to communicate this on the
[03:40:34.640 --> 03:40:39.280]  internet oh they only said it when antifa had guns out last weekend threatening oh and not letting
[03:40:39.280 --> 03:40:42.960]  them get to an event and hitting it with clubs they went oh your anti-second amendment it's not
[03:40:42.960 --> 03:40:48.080]  second amendment to go use guns to block a legal person just like it's not free speech to say here's
[03:40:48.080 --> 03:40:53.360]  how we sabotage the train now we want you to go kill a bunch of people saying let's go kill people
[03:40:53.360 --> 03:40:58.400]  is not free speech and here's what it means it means we're gonna come after them because let me
[03:40:58.400 --> 03:41:04.800]  tell you something i'm done yeah well i i would be great if the fbi would would focus on this
[03:41:05.360 --> 03:41:10.720]  where's the fbi they're too busy arresting amish that sell cheese their neighbors
[03:41:13.680 --> 03:41:19.680]  i laugh but i mean it's true they really are i mean this is this is what passes for justice
[03:41:19.680 --> 03:41:24.880]  in america this is why it's so important you know i was watching you and craig talk and he said 50
[03:41:24.880 --> 03:41:30.720]  percent uh don't know what's going on it's no it's more than that there's many of people that even
[03:41:30.720 --> 03:41:35.520]  think the way that we think that don't really understand the damage that is being done for
[03:41:35.520 --> 03:41:41.520]  not just the last eight years but the last 25 years exactly how can america be the biggest
[03:41:41.520 --> 03:41:47.040]  consumer of pedophilia the biggest consumer of porn the biggest consumer of drugs all of it
[03:41:47.040 --> 03:41:51.200]  it's because for anything that's really good metaphysically hermetically anything that's
[03:41:51.200 --> 03:41:58.160]  really good his history showed evil comes to that so evil is drawn to good to take it over
[03:41:58.160 --> 03:42:04.880]  so we were so good that's why it's it's like the ragnarok it's the yin yang it's all happening here
[03:42:06.320 --> 03:42:11.520]  it's um the the other fallacy is is that the the bad guy doesn't always wear the black cat
[03:42:11.520 --> 03:42:16.400]  the bad guy isn't always who you think the bad guy is in fact the bad guy pretends to be the
[03:42:16.400 --> 03:42:20.720]  good guy a lot it's always that's what people have exactly they don't just stand there and say
[03:42:20.720 --> 03:42:24.800]  we're gonna do bad stuff they hide they masquerade as good people and that's what you're seeing
[03:42:24.800 --> 03:42:28.640]  especially with this trafficking stuff it's it's really terrible it's disgusting all right brother

[03:47:33.200 --> 03:47:38.240]  10 minutes and then we're going to be taking a lot of phone calls throughout the next however
[03:47:38.240 --> 03:47:43.200]  many hours it kicked off at 8 a.m. with david night so we're like four hours in and then another
[03:47:43.200 --> 03:47:48.720]  three hours so we're like seven hours in we got 20 plus hours left in global live transmission
[03:47:49.920 --> 03:47:54.720]  uh listen i don't want to get up here and like brian go i gave a hundred thousand dollars to
[03:47:54.720 --> 03:48:01.920]  craig soyer to make his film about the pedophile rings i just said my gut knew it was the right
[03:48:01.920 --> 03:48:10.320]  thing to do i'm not made out of money but that's what this whole platform is about is getting people
[03:48:10.320 --> 03:48:17.680]  on air who are doing important things and causing chain reactions and we don't always
[03:48:17.680 --> 03:48:24.320]  cause a chain reaction we rarely do but when we do it changes the world we do all sorts of little
[03:48:24.320 --> 03:48:31.600]  things together that change our own personal lives and create an opposition to the globalist but
[03:48:31.600 --> 03:48:37.200]  info wars is hated by the new world order because they can see dozens of chain reactions
[03:48:37.200 --> 03:48:45.200]  that have devastated their operations originating from here and that means you and matt dubio and
[03:48:45.200 --> 03:48:50.960]  the great crew here and all the other guests and just what we do the enemy knows that its problems
[03:48:50.960 --> 03:48:56.480]  are coming from here and then thank god we get a donald trump there and then other people pop up
[03:48:56.480 --> 03:49:02.960]  and again i don't claim to be the perfect saint but i'm not out to get you and donald trump is
[03:49:02.960 --> 03:49:07.760]  going to make mistakes and he can't even get his they're in political admitting that the bureaucrats
[03:49:07.760 --> 03:49:12.720]  are all ignoring what he says he tells big master don't back isis and don't back these groups and
[03:49:12.720 --> 03:49:16.400]  that it's still going on in syria and that's a whole other subject i didn't get into but later
[03:49:16.400 --> 03:49:20.560]  i'm gonna do a reported eight o'clock tonight with that when i come in and host a few hours so
[03:49:22.960 --> 03:49:28.160]  what matters is intent in our heart king david did a lot of bad things as he made mistakes but he
[03:49:28.160 --> 03:49:34.160]  loved god he didn't mean to be bad so god said you're a man from out art and so all i'm saying is
[03:49:34.160 --> 03:49:40.000]  just keep moving forward because yes we've had big victories but now the counter assault's going to
[03:49:40.000 --> 03:49:47.120]  happen and it's going to be through that process that we find out who we really are but we need
[03:49:47.120 --> 03:49:53.600]  financial funding that is the easiest thing people can do other than sharing articles and videos to
[03:49:53.600 --> 03:49:58.640]  really make sure that we can not just stay where we are but grow because the attempt is to shut us
[03:49:58.640 --> 03:50:03.040]  down and kill us well i'm not going to just try to you know sit here and roll over or whatever i'm
[03:50:03.040 --> 03:50:08.720]  going to expand in the face of the attack because as they're destroying us we're going to be building
[03:50:08.720 --> 03:50:14.160]  up so fast and in the grace of god it's always happened that way our biggest growth spurts come
[03:50:15.440 --> 03:50:19.200]  when we're under attack and we're now in the phase where one more growth spurter to
[03:50:19.200 --> 03:50:24.640]  do it's it's there's no turning us back at that point that's why they're kind of foaming at the
[03:50:24.640 --> 03:50:28.960]  mouth so they've got all these tv shows attacking me each week lying about us that's why i can't
[03:50:28.960 --> 03:50:32.160]  even go out on the street now without being attacked a lot of folks pat me on the back but
[03:50:32.160 --> 03:50:37.520]  like every tenth person starts screaming and yelling like a demon is because this is a revolution
[03:50:37.520 --> 03:50:42.800]  against the globalist so today's the last day to order and get free shipping store-wide and we'll
[03:50:42.800 --> 03:50:48.240]  still have free shipping a few days but to get it delivered before christmas we definitely have
[03:50:48.240 --> 03:50:51.760]  we've got a lot of huge sales sometimes we have the biggest sale on this item or that item or
[03:50:51.760 --> 03:50:57.280]  even four or five items but we have the most things for sale at 50 off it's now more than 80
[03:50:57.280 --> 03:51:04.800]  items at 50 off more than 10 items at 60 off or more an info or store.com we're selling colloidal
[03:51:04.800 --> 03:51:11.440]  silver as a lost leader the highest quality we're talking $15 less than whole food sells the exact
[03:51:11.440 --> 03:51:15.040]  same stuff with another label on it and they do sell a good variety of it so if you have

[03:51:37.040 --> 03:51:41.360]  that's what everybody seems to be buying right now and that's great and the massive numbers you're
[03:51:41.360 --> 03:51:45.600]  ordering and it funds some of our operations but alpha power male and female enhancement the next

[03:51:58.080 --> 03:52:03.520]  you that have already decided to shop with us buying these war bonds buying this it's done it
[03:52:03.520 --> 03:52:08.560]  you've changed the world but now is the next level of the fight so I salute you and speaking of that
[03:52:08.560 --> 03:52:15.920]  I don't know how much Matt can get into this right now Matt Dubigel who runs 1530 WCKG and
[03:52:15.920 --> 03:52:22.080]  the FM station they've got he's got a plan that's about to be green-lighted right now as we speak
[03:52:22.720 --> 03:52:29.040]  to not just the AM covers most of Chicago the FM part of it he's 102.3 he's got a plan to cover
[03:52:29.040 --> 03:52:35.120]  it all and has to do with a name Trump so I guess he's ready to talk about it right now
[03:52:35.120 --> 03:52:41.840]  and and I don't pay to be on WCKG but to help the station out and to do this we have made some
[03:52:41.840 --> 03:52:46.800]  investments and that's what I'm saying the money coming in here is about warring against the globalist
[03:52:46.800 --> 03:52:51.760]  defending ourselves and and and and taking care of the great crew and expanding that's why you
[03:52:51.760 --> 03:52:56.640]  can know that we are committed 100% and here's just another example of what we're doing Matt tell
[03:52:56.640 --> 03:53:04.960]  folks about Trump Tower. It's pretty exciting we got this FM and as soon as Trump was put in the
[03:53:04.960 --> 03:53:12.240]  office things moved very swiftly so the FCC moved very swiftly and approved us to move our FM to
[03:53:12.240 --> 03:53:16.960]  the top of Trump Tower now they could have approved us to move to the top of the Hancock we could
[03:53:16.960 --> 03:53:22.560]  have gone to the top of Willis Tower Trump Tower is actually just the best location for this frequency
[03:53:22.560 --> 03:53:27.600]  and so I can actually talk about it now and and talking about it I've been reluctant to talk about
[03:53:27.600 --> 03:53:33.200]  it because the minute we start talking about it and and you've experienced it yeah and it's
[03:53:33.200 --> 03:53:38.240]  going to happen and I've been trying to kind of muster up some uh illegal funds and things like
[03:53:38.240 --> 03:53:43.600]  that because they come at you in different ways we've had a Muslim Islamic group buy up all the
[03:53:43.600 --> 03:53:49.120]  property around our AM and try and force us out of where the AM property is all sort I mean
[03:53:49.120 --> 03:53:53.600]  the stuff that has happened you wouldn't believe it's it seems like I've made it up they stripped
[03:53:53.600 --> 03:53:57.360]  of our cheer sponsors you're a you're a you're a station manager and a guy that'll actually
[03:53:57.360 --> 03:54:02.080]  come out in the open we learned to never even list our affiliates because they harass them
[03:54:02.080 --> 03:54:06.400]  we just explain we don't list you because you they understand we got some huge 20,000 waters
[03:54:06.400 --> 03:54:11.120]  and stuff that don't you know they get the game I mean this is a war but you've got the courage is
[03:54:11.120 --> 03:54:16.560]  the point people well I'm just you know I people don't realize and in one day I'll tell you about
[03:54:16.560 --> 03:54:21.360]  some of the other stuff that's happened this year to me personally which I'm not going to get into
[03:54:21.360 --> 03:54:25.920]  here because it's not about me so the long and the short of it is is we've worked out the arrangement
[03:54:25.920 --> 03:54:30.000]  with the Trump Tower by the way those people at the Trump Organization have their act together
[03:54:30.000 --> 03:54:35.040]  it wasn't hard to do I'm actually going to be sending checks to the Trump Organization because
[03:54:35.040 --> 03:54:40.320]  we have to lease the tower space at the top of the building and I have my Christmas list as we move
[03:54:40.320 --> 03:54:48.560]  102.3 to the top of Trump Tower what that means is 102.3 FM with with with Real News with David
[03:54:48.560 --> 03:54:53.440]  Knife from 8 to 11 by the way David did an amazing show if anybody wants to learn about
[03:54:53.440 --> 03:54:58.000]  things besides just what's going on but like he talked about taxation and the history of
[03:54:58.000 --> 03:55:03.600]  he's an engineer he's too smart for talk radio I mean the yeah it's like we almost don't deserve
[03:55:03.600 --> 03:55:08.160]  this guy the show was phenomenal you can learn some things your kids can learn some things from
[03:55:08.160 --> 03:55:12.960]  these shows we're going to be broadcasting those shows from the top of Trump Tower we'll be up
[03:55:12.960 --> 03:55:16.560]  there by the end of January God willing you know we got to deal with unions and things but my
[03:55:16.560 --> 03:55:21.440]  Christmas list is I got to buy a control arm for a few thousand dollars I got to buy an antenna
[03:55:21.440 --> 03:55:25.440]  I got to order that today so we're going to be ordering all of that equipment to move to the
[03:55:25.440 --> 03:55:30.480]  top of just be clear 1530 covers a lot of Chicago but you know you're talking about your your FM
[03:55:30.480 --> 03:55:34.880]  transmitter covers a part of it this is going to cover all of it I put up the site map this is
[03:55:34.880 --> 03:55:39.840]  gorgeous then we can really hype to all our listeners tune into the is it the same frequency
[03:55:39.840 --> 03:55:45.120]  on top from tower now FM 102.3 will be from the top of Trump Tower yeah but so they'll be able to
[03:55:45.120 --> 03:55:50.480]  listen in FM which is uh you know it's FM talk is kind of the thing reserved for sports and other
[03:55:50.480 --> 03:55:53.840]  things this is going to be pretty groundbreaking we're going to be breaking in so so I've already
[03:55:53.840 --> 03:55:58.320]  made a donation which you never asked for but you do you have the idea how do folks get the rest
[03:55:58.320 --> 03:56:02.320]  of the equipment you need to have us go from covering part of Chicago to covering all of it
[03:56:02.320 --> 03:56:09.840]  but anybody that wants to participate in any way can go to trump1530.com that's trump1530.com

[03:56:24.720 --> 03:56:29.840]  2018 man I tell you got a great response from 1530 over the eight years you've been carrying us
[03:56:29.840 --> 03:56:34.960]  and I know instead of the you know them coming after you all folks should back off you didn't
[03:56:34.960 --> 03:56:39.680]  and uh so I because you you predate when I stop saying who our affiliates are because they get
[03:56:39.680 --> 03:56:44.160]  ratings they get support but as long as we will we say it nationally man the eye of Soran goes
[03:56:44.960 --> 03:56:49.360]  and boy they come after your butt because I mean they know what they're doing this is a mafia of
[03:56:49.360 --> 03:56:55.360]  slugs of global escum but Matt Dibbio hasn't given in to them so we salute you folks who support you
[03:56:55.360 --> 03:57:00.160]  and absolutely so god bless you Matt thank you so much and I can't wait till you launch your own
