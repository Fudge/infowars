[00:00.000 --> 00:15.080]  What is Twitter incentivizing people to do or not do and why?
[00:15.080 --> 00:22.360]  The answers will lead to tectonic shifts in Twitter and our industry operates.
[00:22.360 --> 00:26.120]  Required changes won't be fast or easy.
[00:26.120 --> 00:31.960]  They were committing to the people and this committee to do that work and do it openly.
[00:31.960 --> 00:38.000]  A Twitter administration control panel was hacked into revealing alleged leaked pictures
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.840]  spotlighting the buttons Trends Blacklist and Search Blacklist, indicating Twitter does
[00:44.840 --> 00:51.320]  have the ability to shadow ban its users, exposing that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey clearly
[00:51.320 --> 00:52.760]  lied to Congress.
[00:52.760 --> 00:58.480]  The allegation that we make, the Republicans, is that you're discriminatory against us,
[00:58.480 --> 01:00.400]  against the Republicans.
[01:00.400 --> 01:06.400]  Your post says, well, there were some Democrat politicians too, so out of 600,000 if there
[01:06.400 --> 01:13.800]  were a thousand Republicans and 10 Democrats, it still seems somewhat biased.
[01:13.800 --> 01:16.800]  If it's 50-50, then that's a whole different bone game.
[01:16.800 --> 01:23.480]  Well, we agree that the result was not impartial, and that is why we corrected and we fixed
[01:23.480 --> 01:24.480]  it.
[01:24.480 --> 01:27.600]  So you do agree that there were more Republicans than Democrats?
[01:27.600 --> 01:29.560]  I didn't say that, but I...
[01:29.560 --> 01:33.840]  I would hope that you would want to know if there are people working for Twitter that
[01:33.840 --> 01:37.880]  did have that kind of discriminatory viewpoint against conservatives that you would at least
[01:37.880 --> 01:41.040]  hold them accountable so that it doesn't happen again.
[01:41.040 --> 01:44.880]  I would want to know that, and I assure you that the algorithm was not written with that
[01:44.880 --> 01:45.880]  intention.
[01:45.880 --> 01:51.040]  It was the signal that we were using caught people up in it, and it was a signal that
[01:51.040 --> 01:55.880]  we determined was not relevant and also not fair in this particular case.
[01:55.880 --> 02:00.960]  And there will be times, and this is where we need to experiment, as you know, in writing
[02:00.960 --> 02:06.240]  algorithms in the past, that you need to test things and see if they work at scale and pull
[02:06.240 --> 02:08.080]  them back correctly if they don't.
[02:08.080 --> 02:13.160]  But also you should inject your own personal viewpoint into that, unless that's the intention
[02:13.160 --> 02:14.760]  of the company, but you're saying it's not.
[02:14.760 --> 02:18.360]  That is not the intention of the company, and I know I'm out of time, but I...
[02:18.360 --> 02:24.020]  As a result, Dorsey should have his home rated Roger Stone style, and Twitter's protected
[02:24.020 --> 02:30.400]  status from the Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act should be stripped immediately.
[02:30.400 --> 02:35.200]  If the alleged pictures of the blacklist are credible, Twitter is acting as a publisher
[02:35.200 --> 02:41.360]  in clear violation of their protected status from Section 230 of the Communications Decency
[02:41.360 --> 02:42.360]  Act.
[02:42.360 --> 02:48.200]  After that, Twitter's vulnerability to hackers poses a major privacy and security threat
[02:48.200 --> 02:55.560]  to its 330 million monthly users and quite possibly national security, to some extent.
[02:55.560 --> 03:01.600]  Back in April of 2013, the Associated Press's hacked Twitter page announced that two explosions
[03:01.600 --> 03:06.600]  rocked the White House, and President Barack Obama had been injured, causing the Dow Jones
[03:06.600 --> 03:14.560]  industrial average and the S&P 500 to immediately plunge, with a loss of $136.5 billion in market
[03:14.560 --> 03:15.560]  cap.
[03:15.560 --> 03:21.640]  The recent hack attack, which involved high-profile verified Twitter accounts, locked in a common
[03:21.640 --> 03:27.920]  cryptocurrency scam that may have funneled as much as $100,000 in a matter of minutes,
[03:27.920 --> 03:33.160]  where victims of the hack said their multi-factor authentication to protect their accounts had
[03:33.160 --> 03:34.160]  failed.
[03:34.160 --> 03:38.880]  Twitter, Josh Hawley, immediately reached out to Jack Dorsey, asking him to contact
[03:38.880 --> 03:45.120]  the DOJ and the FBI as soon as possible, despite countless people on Twitter asking
[03:45.120 --> 03:51.040]  him why a blacklist search is up on Vandot Video, it needs to be seen by all, hope you
[03:51.040 --> 03:57.120]  look at it, hope you share it, but I wanted to cut into this and just answer the question.
[03:57.120 --> 04:08.480]  Of course, ladies and gentlemen, of course, Twitter is censoring people.
[04:08.480 --> 04:29.280]  We got the Project Veritas video from multiple sources inside their operation years ago where
[04:29.280 --> 04:35.240]  they used the terms blacklist and block trends, and they admit they do that, and they do it
[04:35.240 --> 04:37.320]  all the time.
[04:37.320 --> 04:40.480]  So it's just very insulting, by the way, they were having those hearings.
[04:40.480 --> 04:44.680]  I was there listening to Jack Dorsey lie the entire time, these people have gotten away
[04:44.680 --> 04:49.720]  with murder, completely out of control, and now all the chickens are coming home to roast.
[04:49.720 --> 04:53.120]  This is a big Friday broadcast lined up for all of you.
[04:53.120 --> 04:58.920]  Straight ahead, please stay with us.
[04:58.920 --> 05:03.880]  It's Christmas in July, we ran the sale last year, it was very, very popular, and so I
[05:03.880 --> 05:08.760]  am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election
[05:08.760 --> 05:09.760]  year.
[05:09.760 --> 05:15.200]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[05:15.200 --> 05:20.880]  It's the American Eagle boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross flag.
[05:20.880 --> 05:23.880]  And the shirts are on sale right now in FullerStore.com.
[05:23.880 --> 05:29.400]  I got the idea for the Trump campaign, having a similar shirt to be called Nazi, which of
[05:29.400 --> 05:30.400]  course it isn't.
[05:30.400 --> 05:33.280]  And since it's so triggering to the leftist and the globalist, well, we're going to make
[05:33.280 --> 05:38.080]  sure there's even more of these on the streets to spread the word and exercise our First
[05:38.080 --> 05:39.600]  Amendment in the face of these tyrants.
[05:39.600 --> 05:43.440]  We also have store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points.
[05:43.440 --> 05:48.080]  So whatever great item it is that you want, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points
[05:48.080 --> 05:51.960]  on your next order, and at least 50% off across the board.
[05:51.960 --> 05:54.960]  Now I'm going to have to end this sale very, very soon because all these products are about
[05:54.960 --> 05:55.960]  to sell out.
[05:55.960 --> 06:13.720]  And I'll see you next time on the show, until we're right now at FullerStore.com.
[06:13.720 --> 06:18.600]  It is Friday, July 17th, the year is 2020.
[06:18.600 --> 06:21.440]  We are 108 days out from the election.
[06:21.440 --> 06:23.320]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:23.320 --> 06:26.760]  We have three big guests on the transmission today.
[06:26.760 --> 06:29.240]  And I also intend to open the phones up.
[06:29.240 --> 06:30.800]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[06:30.800 --> 06:34.880]  We were supposed to be off the air a long time ago, but thanks to your support, thanks
[06:34.880 --> 06:38.640]  to your prayers, thanks to your action, we are still on air and we are still changing
[06:38.640 --> 06:39.640]  the world together.
[06:39.640 --> 06:43.560]  And I can tell you that President Trump and a lot of his top advisors and a lot of his
[06:43.560 --> 06:49.200]  top researchers do watch the show and see it as a bellwether or the pulse of the republic
[06:49.200 --> 06:56.120]  and that we are really having a big effect on the planet to the outrage of criminal insiders
[06:56.120 --> 07:01.600]  like Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, George Soros, and the globalists that control them
[07:01.600 --> 07:02.600]  and pull their strings.
[07:02.600 --> 07:08.360]  All right, let me tell you what's coming up today.
[07:08.360 --> 07:13.080]  We have Billy Weber with some really important news concerning Joe Biden and what his real
[07:13.080 --> 07:23.880]  agenda is joining us, then we also are going to have the hodge twins on the broadcast as
[07:23.880 --> 07:24.880]  well.
[07:24.880 --> 07:30.280]  Dr. Nick Baggich and more is coming up today.
[07:30.280 --> 07:39.400]  Now, that said, the entire trans agenda is out in the open now and they're officially
[07:39.400 --> 07:47.400]  taking the word female or woman off of medical documents across the United States and Europe.
[07:47.400 --> 07:53.520]  So now the word female is bad, female's existing is bad and that's what J.K. Rowling, the big
[07:53.520 --> 07:58.880]  liberal left, has finally figured out, lady, is this is about getting rid of women's spaces,
[07:58.880 --> 08:01.400]  women's rights, and attacking the species.
[08:01.400 --> 08:04.800]  If you want to attack a species, you attack women, but first you claim you're all about
[08:04.800 --> 08:07.480]  women and want to protect them.
[08:07.480 --> 08:12.080]  Meanwhile, big news came out yesterday, but got almost no attention.
[08:12.080 --> 08:13.960]  It's confirmed in court documents.
[08:13.960 --> 08:16.280]  It's not denied.
[08:16.280 --> 08:26.120]  The state is calling it a legitimate forced treatment for young boys in the foster care
[08:26.120 --> 08:33.320]  system and the juvenile justice system to forcibly give them hormone therapy in quotes.
[08:33.320 --> 08:37.520]  Hitler just should have called the death camps therapy and would have been okay, according
[08:37.520 --> 08:38.680]  to the media.
[08:38.680 --> 08:39.680]  Big, big deal.
[08:39.680 --> 08:48.400]  Well, that ties into UK NHS cervical cancer testing leaflet doesn't mention women offers
[08:48.400 --> 08:51.560]  help to trans men.
[08:51.560 --> 08:52.560]  That's right.
[08:52.560 --> 08:53.560]  This is the mental illness.
[08:53.560 --> 08:58.800]  A man comes in with male genitals and they've fired nurses before in the UK when they say
[08:58.800 --> 09:07.600]  I want a pap smear and the woman says you have a tallywacker and they say you will check
[09:07.600 --> 09:10.440]  my cervix.
[09:10.440 --> 09:16.200]  You will do a pap smear and if you don't go along with the mental illness, you're fired.
[09:16.200 --> 09:22.380]  This is the incredible control that goes on.
[09:22.380 --> 09:29.520]  This is the new world order manipulation.
[09:29.520 --> 09:38.800]  Now, that's going to be coming up.
[09:38.800 --> 09:47.520]  But the first thing I want to cover today is the Twitter situation and then I'm going
[09:47.520 --> 09:55.240]  to get into the big issue that everything else is connected to the martial law were
[09:55.240 --> 10:00.200]  under instituted by multinational UN directives, the counties, the cities, the states that
[10:00.200 --> 10:02.080]  are under globalist control.
[10:02.080 --> 10:03.080]  And that's what they are.
[10:03.080 --> 10:08.960]  They are globalist collaborators in every sense of the word and that is what they're
[10:08.960 --> 10:14.760]  using these directives to do is to keep us locked down and the rest of the world is
[10:14.760 --> 10:16.000]  not locked down.
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.960]  This is designed to punish the United States via the bureaucracy and the medical tyranny.
[10:20.960 --> 10:28.760]  We're trying to get off under the new world order and win a trade war with the globalist
[10:28.760 --> 10:33.400]  golden child, communist China.
[10:33.400 --> 10:39.440]  And as America realizes that those in league with the chai comms, the globalist Hollywood
[10:39.440 --> 10:44.760]  and this America hating wave of hundreds of Jesus statues having their heads cut off this
[10:44.760 --> 10:51.640]  week, hundreds of Virgin Mary's toppled this week, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[10:51.640 --> 10:57.480]  of other statues destroyed and Satanist monuments put up in many other places and hundreds
[10:57.480 --> 11:06.440]  of churches burned in the last week that this is a global satanic spiritual attack on our
[11:06.440 --> 11:12.800]  very biology, on our very physiology, on our very soul.
[11:12.800 --> 11:17.680]  So that is coming up as well, but huge news as Trump goes to war with Fauci and Bill Gates
[11:17.680 --> 11:19.600]  and realizes what's really going on.
[11:19.600 --> 11:24.040]  And Trump is listening, as I've been saying, he's got to not just sideline Fauci, he's
[11:24.040 --> 11:27.760]  got to discredit him and Trump has that through surrogates happening.
[11:27.760 --> 11:33.840]  And so now Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg who works for Bill Gates, basically Mark Zuckerberg
[11:33.840 --> 11:35.800]  is Bill Gates.
[11:35.800 --> 11:44.480]  He's his minion, his ringwraith, his Nazgul, they are out attacking Trump saying the COVID-19
[11:44.480 --> 11:48.760]  is the fault of the president, he's refusing to lead, he's a bad guy, all of it's a lie.
[11:48.760 --> 11:54.280]  And in Fauci's comparing COVID-19 to the Spanish flu that killed 50 million people, this has
[11:54.280 --> 11:58.040]  not even killed a million worldwide if you believe the fake numbers.
[11:58.040 --> 12:01.480]  And they're just taking regular numbers of other deaths, putting it in the column.
[12:01.480 --> 12:07.600]  It was only eight states that were following the NIH and CDC directive to count everybody
[12:07.600 --> 12:12.000]  that dies is COVID-19, and that's where you got most of the numbers, Texas sickeningly
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.320]  is the only Republican state to have joined it.
[12:14.320 --> 12:20.720]  Well Alabama just joined it, Alabama is going to count everybody that dies is COVID.
[12:20.720 --> 12:26.400]  In fact, there's other articles out today about people dying of car wreck COVID-19,
[12:26.400 --> 12:31.680]  gunshot wound, COVID-19, it is such a galactic level fraud.
[12:31.680 --> 12:38.160]  But speaking of collaborators, I want to play a clip, a three minute clip as we go to break,
[12:38.160 --> 12:43.680]  of Attorney General Barr warns of Chinese efforts to dominate industries, calls out
[12:43.680 --> 12:48.280]  Hollywood tech giants for caving to pressure, he uses a keyword collaborating, that's a
[12:48.280 --> 12:53.040]  keyword in law, because it's his collaboration with our enemies.
[12:53.040 --> 12:54.640]  And that's what it is, we are at war.
[12:54.640 --> 12:57.240]  So here is the Attorney General taking the gloves off.
[12:57.240 --> 13:05.320]  Big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.
[13:05.320 --> 13:11.160]  In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton
[13:11.160 --> 13:18.240]  hailed the new century as one in which liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.
[13:18.240 --> 13:24.000]  Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the
[13:24.000 --> 13:31.320]  Chinese communists build the Great Firewall of China, the world's most sophisticated system
[13:31.320 --> 13:35.320]  for internet surveillance and censorship.
[13:35.320 --> 13:42.920]  Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves
[13:42.920 --> 13:46.800]  all too willing to collaborate with the CCP.
[13:46.800 --> 13:54.040]  For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China after
[13:54.040 --> 14:00.680]  the Chinese government complained about the coverage of Hong Kong democracy protests.
[14:00.680 --> 14:07.280]  Apple also removed the apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent
[14:07.280 --> 14:15.160]  the Great Firewall and eliminated pro-democracy songs from the Chinese music store.
[14:15.160 --> 14:21.960]  Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to
[14:21.960 --> 14:28.120]  servers in China despite concerns that the move would give the Communist Party easier
[14:28.120 --> 14:38.080]  access to emails, text messages, and other user information stored in the iCloud.
[14:38.080 --> 14:52.480]  Eventually, we were able to get into two cell phones used by the al-Qaeda terrorist who shot
[14:52.480 --> 14:58.120]  eight Americans at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, and during the gunfight with him,
[14:58.120 --> 15:03.920]  he stopped, disengaged, put his cell phones down, and tried to destroy them, shooting
[15:03.920 --> 15:07.320]  a bullet into one of his two cell phones.
[15:07.320 --> 15:12.360]  We thought that suggested that there might be very important information about terrorist
[15:12.360 --> 15:18.080]  activities in those cell phones, and for four and a half months, we tried to get in without
[15:18.080 --> 15:20.000]  any help at all from Apple.
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.040]  Apple failed to give us any help getting into those cell phones.
[15:25.040 --> 15:30.000]  We were ultimately able to get in through a fluke that we will not be able to reproduce
[15:30.000 --> 15:37.960]  in the future, where we found communications with al-Qaeda operatives in the Middle East
[15:37.960 --> 15:41.480]  up to the day before the attack.
[15:41.480 --> 15:52.160]  Do you think when Apple sells phones in China that Apple phones in China are impervious to
[15:52.160 --> 15:54.080]  penetration by Chinese authorities?
[15:54.080 --> 15:57.640]  No, they gave them the code keys on record.
[15:57.640 --> 16:02.160]  Much of the United States bureaucracy all of Hollywood and most of our media is under
[16:02.160 --> 16:04.160]  international banking control.
[16:04.160 --> 16:08.400]  The United Nations was set up by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers on record to carry out this
[16:08.400 --> 16:09.400]  operation.
[16:09.400 --> 16:16.400]  Now, under the guise of medical security, they're bringing us medical charity, that we see much
[16:16.400 --> 16:20.280]  of the federal government, the Democrats, the Republicans, all saying, except for Trump
[16:20.280 --> 16:26.640]  and a few people, that we need a nationwide force mask mandate to make everyone wear a
[16:26.640 --> 16:27.640]  mask.
[16:27.640 --> 16:31.720]  Even though just months ago, we had the Surgeon General and others say, don't wear a mask,
[16:31.720 --> 16:32.720]  it's all fraud.
[16:32.720 --> 16:37.520]  Now, they say you must wear a mask, it's a sign of slavery, it's a sign of submission.
[16:37.520 --> 16:41.400]  I know you as listeners understand that, we need sheriffs and county commissioners and
[16:41.400 --> 16:46.800]  city councils and others to stand up and say, we are sanctuary cities for reality and for
[16:46.800 --> 16:50.440]  state and local sovereignty against the globalist.
[16:50.440 --> 16:54.520]  This isn't the federal government taking over, it's the UN through the federal government
[16:54.520 --> 16:56.960]  and we as American citizens must say no.
[16:56.960 --> 17:02.240]  The reasons that the globalist launched this planetary lockdown, the number one reason
[17:02.240 --> 17:05.720]  is it serves every one of their purposes.
[17:05.720 --> 17:10.160]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[17:10.160 --> 17:14.520]  The casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced
[17:14.520 --> 17:15.520]  inoculation.
[17:15.520 --> 17:23.240]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential
[17:23.240 --> 17:29.760]  as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people
[17:29.760 --> 17:31.640]  once had by design.
[17:31.640 --> 17:36.560]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[17:36.560 --> 17:42.600]  It's been preplanned, organized globally and it's extremely predatory and through governmental
[17:42.600 --> 17:48.920]  actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are
[17:48.920 --> 17:53.840]  able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[17:53.840 --> 17:59.920]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[17:59.920 --> 18:06.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:06.600 --> 18:25.840]  All right, when the Twitter hack happened, I recognized it was a message right away
[18:25.840 --> 18:28.360]  about who got hit.
[18:28.360 --> 18:37.800]  Clearly the Bitcoin scam was just a cover for who was really behind it and what was
[18:37.800 --> 18:38.800]  going on.
[18:38.800 --> 18:45.560]  You better believe it's patriots inside U.S. intelligence agencies.
[18:45.560 --> 18:49.440]  You better believe all that information when the control panel is real because I've already
[18:49.440 --> 18:52.360]  talked to Twitter operatives that have told me about the control panel.
[18:52.360 --> 18:56.880]  It's already been in documents and an undercover video that Veritas got three different executives
[18:56.880 --> 19:00.280]  admitting the control panel.
[19:00.280 --> 19:04.480]  So we know that he lied to Congress, but that's not really what this is about.
[19:04.480 --> 19:10.280]  It's about letting Twitter know that they can be gutted seven ways to Sunday and that
[19:10.280 --> 19:15.880]  I guess the intelligence agencies have a lot of ways to get back at communist collaborators.
[19:15.880 --> 19:21.960]  So these guys like to act like they're in charge all day, they're not in charge.
[19:21.960 --> 19:28.440]  People like Jack Dorsey better watch his ass and so should Eric Schmidt and Barack Obama
[19:28.440 --> 19:33.480]  and Bill Gates and all of them because we're not here looking for a fight, but if they come
[19:33.480 --> 19:38.320]  with a fight, they better believe they're going to get one and they are getting one.
[19:38.320 --> 19:46.560]  So I'll cover that more next hour, but the next 108 days is the most incredible time
[19:46.560 --> 19:47.560]  ever.
[19:47.560 --> 19:53.960]  I'm going to leave it at that for now, I'm going to get more into it next hour, but it's
[19:53.960 --> 19:55.200]  a big deal.
[19:55.200 --> 19:59.960]  Separately, I cannot impart to listeners and viewers and affiliates and sponsors and all
[19:59.960 --> 20:03.400]  of you how important you are and how amazing you are and the fact that you weathered the
[20:03.400 --> 20:09.560]  storms, the attacks, the psychological warfare, the de-platforming and you kept us in attack
[20:09.560 --> 20:10.560]  formation.
[20:10.560 --> 20:16.480]  You kept us in the game to press the attack and we've done it and we've come through it
[20:16.480 --> 20:20.120]  and we're still in the fight stronger than ever, thanks to you, I salute and thank you
[20:20.120 --> 20:24.400]  and I just want to ask you, think about the time you live in and don't waste every precious
[20:24.400 --> 20:29.880]  second minute, an hour we have in day and to tell everybody you know about that local
[20:29.880 --> 20:34.320]  radio station, that local TV station, to thank that local station, to become a sponsor or
[20:34.320 --> 20:38.080]  to support the sponsor and call the station, thank them, call the sponsor and thank them
[20:38.080 --> 20:43.000]  and then go into that floor anger carpet place or go into that car dealership or go to that
[20:43.000 --> 20:48.000]  restaurant or go to that church that is supporting this broadcast and tell people about band
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.360]  dot video, tell people about news wars dot com and say, hey, you've heard this demonized,
[20:53.360 --> 20:56.760]  find out why it's demonized, find out what's really happening there, what's really being
[20:56.760 --> 21:02.840]  said, not what the media edits together and puts out.
[21:02.840 --> 21:07.720]  And pull them back correctly if they don't and that is that also you should add again
[21:07.720 --> 21:16.160]  ladies and gentlemen, there is just so much unfolding and it's such a historic time that
[21:16.160 --> 21:17.160]  we are all in.
[21:17.160 --> 21:25.440]  I just want everybody to think about each millisecond lost is precious.
[21:25.440 --> 21:30.400]  People are ready to hear the truth now.
[21:30.400 --> 21:35.320]  America is fighting a global consortium literally trying to bankrupt this and cause a giant
[21:35.320 --> 21:37.760]  race war and break our back forever.
[21:37.760 --> 21:40.120]  Do you really want that?
[21:40.120 --> 21:46.800]  Even if you again are an atheist sociopath, you wouldn't want the country to go belly
[21:46.800 --> 21:49.720]  up.
[21:49.720 --> 21:53.000]  Almost no one is going to get more power out of this except a very tiny group and they're
[21:53.000 --> 21:57.200]  doing it and they're already in power, they're going to hurt their own investments in their
[21:57.200 --> 22:04.720]  own system because it's a spiritual fight and they are slaves executing an operation.
[22:04.720 --> 22:09.160]  So please think about visiting infowarstore.com, you have the Christmas in July sale going

[22:58.160 --> 23:02.720]  We do have some new products that I'm going to announce and launch at the bottom of the
[23:02.720 --> 23:03.720]  next hour.
[23:03.720 --> 23:04.720]  I'm just going to let you know about that.
[23:04.720 --> 23:06.840]  We're ready to launch a bunch of those I told you about that would have been the sale
[23:06.840 --> 23:08.280]  this week.
[23:08.280 --> 23:13.080]  And so we got the certificate on 8 of the 10 items, so we're going to tell you about those
[23:13.080 --> 23:16.880]  and that makes your life better, makes our life better, funds the operation in the face
[23:16.880 --> 23:17.880]  of the enemy.
[23:17.880 --> 23:22.800]  And you can know, you stand with us, you back us with word of mouth prayer and money, I will
[23:22.800 --> 23:29.040]  not ever give up, I will put a gun to my head, impossible, cannot sell out, physically cannot
[23:29.040 --> 23:34.680]  happen, totally committed to just a crazed goblin-like level.
[23:34.680 --> 23:38.480]  And that's the spirit we're going to have is just total commitment.
[23:38.480 --> 23:42.120]  Well, there's not even a question of the commitment, you are committed.
[23:42.120 --> 23:49.080]  It's not like you're fighting to be committed or you're going 110%, you're going 5,000%.
[23:49.080 --> 23:54.240]  And it's in that spirit that you will find empowerment and enlightenment and victory.
[23:54.240 --> 23:57.400]  We cannot give in to this enemy.
[23:57.400 --> 24:02.160]  If it was some superior system that was going to make things better, I would just adopt it.
[24:02.160 --> 24:05.660]  I'd marry into it, like that.
[24:05.660 --> 24:11.520]  This is not something superior, this sucks, it's evil, it stinks, and I will defeat it
[24:11.520 --> 24:13.640]  or I'll die from trying.
[24:13.640 --> 24:18.960]  Liberty or death is not some tough guy's thing, and that's what's found in this country.
[24:18.960 --> 24:25.120]  Liberty or death, victory or death, because it's death to bow and be a slave.
[24:25.120 --> 24:30.900]  And then you metaphysically betray all those that came before you that fought incredibly
[24:30.900 --> 24:37.240]  valiantly for every little bit of human liberty that was scratched and clawed away from tyrants.
[24:37.240 --> 24:42.160]  And we are running through the reserves of what our ancestors built, and we're on fumes
[24:42.160 --> 24:46.760]  right now, but right as the engine starts seizing up and clacking and black smoke starts
[24:46.760 --> 24:50.600]  coming out the back of the tailpipe, people are finally remembering what freedom's all
[24:50.600 --> 24:51.600]  about.
[24:51.600 --> 24:54.200]  Oh, what's up with the American flags?
[24:54.200 --> 24:55.400]  What's up with the Texas flag?
[24:55.400 --> 24:57.680]  You know, what's up with all this?
[24:57.680 --> 25:02.200]  Until you realize they're replacing it with something horrible, and that a bunch of people
[25:02.200 --> 25:07.720]  fought for this system we have that didn't perfect, but by God, it's the enemy's number
[25:07.720 --> 25:13.640]  one threat because it has the idea of freedom beaten in its big, red heart with that red,
[25:13.640 --> 25:18.800]  rich blood that we've all got, that blood that unifies us all as humans.
[25:18.800 --> 25:20.220]  The globalists are anti-human.
[25:20.220 --> 25:21.720]  They are your enemy.
[25:21.720 --> 25:26.040]  Now, I said I'd get to this segment, the huge COVID-19 news, and I did, and then Millie
[25:26.040 --> 25:27.560]  Weaver's coming up.
[25:27.560 --> 25:29.280]  I'll hit this start of the next hour.
[25:29.280 --> 25:30.280]  It's so important.
[25:30.280 --> 25:34.320]  And then I'll hit the huge news on Twitter.
[25:34.320 --> 25:35.920]  This is exactly what we need to see.
[25:35.920 --> 25:39.440]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[25:39.440 --> 25:44.920]  And these people are all CHICOM collaborators, and we're at war right now, and they want
[25:44.920 --> 25:49.200]  to bring in a police state that targets the American people and shuts down our system.
[25:49.200 --> 25:51.680]  I say cut the head off the snake, President Trump.
[25:51.680 --> 25:58.040]  I say the American people back you to deal with the New World Order.
[25:58.040 --> 26:02.800]  I say clean, swift cuts.
[26:02.800 --> 26:08.680]  I say decapitate the globalist, however it needs to be done, quickly, cleanly, without
[26:08.680 --> 26:11.240]  letting this garbage drag on any longer.
[26:11.240 --> 26:15.400]  They attacked us, they're attacking the system, they're trying to overthrow everything and
[26:15.400 --> 26:16.400]  bring in hell itself.
[26:16.400 --> 26:22.960]  It is a dereliction of duty unless the president executes, and the president is executing.
[26:22.960 --> 26:27.600]  We have to be there to encourage and green light the president and those that are faithful
[26:27.600 --> 26:32.840]  in our government and the corporate structure and the system to make the right move right
[26:32.840 --> 26:37.760]  now and choose American values at the most critical time in our history since 1776.
[26:37.760 --> 26:42.600]  In fact, quite frankly, the evil we were facing back then was nothing compared to this.
[26:42.600 --> 26:47.360]  I mean, this is so cut and dry, King George is an angel, King George the Third compared
[26:47.360 --> 26:48.360]  to these people.
[26:48.360 --> 26:53.120]  A sweetie pie, a wonderful man compared to this.
[26:53.120 --> 26:55.400]  We just weren't being treated fairly, so we had to have that war.
[26:55.400 --> 26:56.400]  This is beyond that.
[26:56.400 --> 27:00.840]  Affordable food is again available for shipping within three to four weeks.
[27:00.840 --> 27:05.040]  We have it, it's high quality, but it's got to be packaged and shipped out to you.
[27:05.040 --> 27:08.480]  Some items are shipping in a week, some in four weeks, so they're saying three to four
[27:08.480 --> 27:09.480]  weeks.
[27:09.480 --> 27:10.480]  It's my patriot.
[27:10.480 --> 27:11.480]  We have their full catalog.
[27:11.480 --> 27:17.240]  They're in our back end at InfoWars, store.com, get your orders in now before the next big
[27:17.240 --> 27:19.160]  surge comes in.
[27:19.160 --> 27:23.400]  Believe me, every angle I've looked at tells me that really, really serious times are
[27:23.400 --> 27:26.120]  ahead whether Trump wins or loses.
[27:26.120 --> 27:30.160]  The globalists have already created a worldwide depression, lockdowns on the planetary scale,
[27:30.160 --> 27:32.080]  and it's only intensifying.
[27:32.080 --> 27:33.960]  This is one of the big boxes.
[27:33.960 --> 27:36.640]  You've got to get checked off, it's high quality, storeable food.
[27:36.640 --> 27:41.800]  My patriot has really good, high quality food at a very affordable price, and the packaging
[27:41.800 --> 27:44.040]  is the best you're going to find out there.
[27:44.040 --> 27:49.400]  Check it out for yourself at infowarsstore.com, and then the money that comes in that's extra
[27:49.400 --> 27:53.240]  helps us fund the information warfare operation that fights the globalist toe-to-toe.
[27:53.240 --> 28:04.260]  So get your storeable food now at infowarsstore.com.
[28:04.260 --> 28:12.200]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[28:12.200 --> 28:15.760]  Where did it come from?
[28:15.760 --> 28:17.760]  Where did it come from?

[28:46.160 --> 28:57.120]  from InfowarsStore.com. InfowarsStore.com. Other systems just don't compare. The bad news is
[28:57.120 --> 29:03.360]  western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist shiny style total
[29:03.360 --> 29:09.200]  net surveillance censorship with AI. The good news is they had to do that to carry out this
[29:09.200 --> 29:16.320]  world government COVID takeover. This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for because
[29:16.320 --> 29:21.280]  the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them. And the good news is there's
[29:21.280 --> 29:29.680]  still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, Paul Watson site summit.news,
[29:29.680 --> 29:34.560]  and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic. Thanks to you and your word of
[29:34.560 --> 29:42.560]  mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own destinies. Ladies and gentlemen,
[29:42.560 --> 29:48.640]  there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy,
[29:48.640 --> 29:53.760]  but being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it. So take
[29:53.760 --> 30:05.760]  action or be slaves. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:23.760 --> 30:31.760]  The truth is everything the globalists are doing is outrageously destructive to this
[30:31.760 --> 30:37.280]  country of the average person, not just here, but around the world. Their COVID-19 hoax lockdown
[30:37.280 --> 30:42.800]  has already caused over 2 million people to starve to death with over 130 million set to die.
[30:42.800 --> 30:49.040]  That's official UN numbers, but using false UN numbers, they tell us COVID-19 is as bad as the
[30:49.040 --> 30:55.280]  Spanish flu of 1918 that killed 50 million people, even though it's not even killed 600,000 worldwide,
[30:55.920 --> 31:02.320]  and that's using fake numbers as well. I've got stacks of news for today in Georgia, in Alabama,
[31:02.320 --> 31:08.080]  in Florida, in North Carolina, I don't know why it's on the east coast. Fatal motorcycle crash
[31:08.080 --> 31:15.920]  listed as COVID-19 death in Florida, and it goes on from there. And that's official policy
[31:15.920 --> 31:24.160]  in places like Alabama and Texas. Shameful. Shameful. That's coming up next hour.
[31:25.360 --> 31:29.520]  But Millie Weber's been knocking out of the park. Millie's been doing reporting for us
[31:30.080 --> 31:34.400]  for, I guess, eight years or so, and she's got her great YouTube site and all the great work she
[31:34.400 --> 31:38.080]  does. She's now doing more and more sit-down interviews as well. I'm glad she's doing her own
[31:38.080 --> 31:42.320]  show. She wanted to come on today, and I'm glad because I already wanted to get into this.
[31:42.320 --> 31:46.720]  Biden's liberal climate policies, they're not liberal, they're eugenicists,
[31:47.280 --> 31:52.800]  feared by unions in Pennsylvania. Yeah. If you want all the jobs gone when Trump started getting
[31:52.800 --> 31:57.520]  some of them back, put in the carbon taxes. So Millie has gone through and looked at his official
[31:57.520 --> 32:05.600]  plank. He also wants migration replacement population activities or migration replacement
[32:05.600 --> 32:12.080]  here in the United States under the UN plan. She's gone through and compared it to AOC's
[32:12.640 --> 32:16.880]  Green Deal. It's the exact same deal. It's the Rothschild deal. It's the New World Order deal.
[32:16.880 --> 32:20.880]  It's the Europe in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand can have no industry,
[32:20.880 --> 32:26.320]  but China has no restrictions. That's what it is, a recipe for total shutdown of society.
[32:26.320 --> 32:35.840]  How would anyone vote for this blubbering, stuttering, bumbling, nincompoop over Trump?
[32:35.840 --> 32:39.600]  It's just mind-boggling, but you're there in Ohio. You've got your ear to the ground, Millie,
[32:39.600 --> 32:44.240]  traveling all over the Midwest and the East. Tell us about your research on this subject.
[32:45.680 --> 32:49.920]  Well, Alex, I thought it was imperative that I come on to tell the American people
[32:49.920 --> 32:54.400]  just what we could be getting ourselves to if Joe Biden becomes the next president of the
[32:54.400 --> 32:59.920]  United States. Many people view him to be somewhat of a moderate candidate, and that's purely just
[32:59.920 --> 33:04.880]  because that's the propaganda the mainstream media has been putting out. If you go to his policies
[33:04.880 --> 33:10.880]  on his website, which I highly recommend everyone do this, go to his website and look up and see
[33:10.880 --> 33:16.160]  for yourself. It's all out there playing for you to read. He has specific climate policies.
[33:16.160 --> 33:21.920]  He is really going to bring in all of these kids like the Sunrise Movement activists, AOC,
[33:21.920 --> 33:26.560]  all of these climate justice people. He's actually going to create specific White House
[33:26.560 --> 33:33.360]  climate change tasks force and environmental groups that police. I mean, he is really going
[33:33.360 --> 33:38.320]  to put some green police on the ground. Well, at the same time, he's going to have this group at
[33:38.320 --> 33:44.080]  his side, the same group that is saying we need to abolish the police, right? While they then
[33:44.080 --> 33:49.440]  say we need to create all these new policing efforts that are going to be policing climate
[33:49.440 --> 33:53.200]  change and climate justice. That's right. They're not going to get rid of the police. They're going
[33:53.200 --> 33:58.240]  to switch the train over from law and order into enforcement over the general public. They're even
[33:58.240 --> 34:02.480]  announcing that the ADOs are probably law center, already major cities have passed laws to do it,
[34:02.480 --> 34:08.800]  will vet who can stay an officer and who can be hired, putting SJWs in full control, a nightmare,
[34:08.800 --> 34:14.960]  commissar, political, police scenario. Exactly. And one of the things under his
[34:14.960 --> 34:20.720]  Biden plan to secure environmental justice and equitable economic opportunity in a clean energy
[34:20.720 --> 34:26.560]  future, they talk about how he recognizes that communities of color in low income communities
[34:26.560 --> 34:32.320]  are adversely affected by climate change. And they're saying that these corporations or businesses
[34:32.320 --> 34:38.000]  or whatever that pollute or not following the EPA's guidelines enough, which they are going to
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.880]  have way more stringent guidelines. Now they're going to connect Black Lives Matter to the global
[34:42.880 --> 34:47.440]  carbon tax to shut us down and call it a form of reparations. Oh, we've got to shut down whatever
[34:47.440 --> 34:55.200]  jobs are left to help the Black people. Oh, yeah. And he says they want to create an environmental
[34:55.200 --> 35:01.760]  justice division within the Department of Justice so they can start prosecuting businesses and people
[35:01.760 --> 35:07.520]  if they're not following stringent climate change guidelines. They don't already have the FDA and
[35:07.520 --> 35:12.320]  the EPA to do that. But again, as you were saying, they're talking about targeting individuals for,
[35:12.320 --> 35:17.360]  oh, you ran your fireplace. That's illegal in San Francisco. Oh, you didn't do this. Oh, we found,
[35:17.360 --> 35:22.000]  you know, an oil canister in the back of your field. You're going to jail. This is literally
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.040]  turning all the bureaucrats that they've graduated out of these colleges, all these Antifa people
[35:27.040 --> 35:33.200]  with degrees to be our minders. Exactly. Not only that, they talk about setting surveillance
[35:33.200 --> 35:39.120]  systems around these neighborhoods so that they can make sure that there's not pollution going on.
[35:39.120 --> 35:42.480]  They're going to have screens. They're going to be collecting data. That data is going to be going
[35:42.480 --> 35:47.040]  off to their climate justice boards within public health divisions. They talk about creating all
[35:47.040 --> 35:51.120]  of these new divisions within the DOJ, within public health. And all of it's designed to shut
[35:51.120 --> 35:56.720]  down what little industry we have left. Yes. I mean, this is much bigger than the EPA. You think
[35:56.720 --> 36:01.280]  EPA is bad. They're saying, well, the EPA is not doing enough. The EPA is weak. They want something
[36:01.280 --> 36:07.440]  way worse than the EPA. I mean, this is going to be like green police on steroids. It's insane.
[36:07.440 --> 36:12.160]  They're going to be shutting down businesses left and right, arresting business executives and putting
[36:12.160 --> 36:19.360]  them in jail for things that they claim are environmental hazards or environmental climate
[36:19.360 --> 36:25.600]  change problems, essentially. And one of the things that they talk about also, Alex, is that
[36:25.600 --> 36:33.120]  they actually believe that COVID-19 is a result of climate change. So they include that in there
[36:33.120 --> 36:39.440]  as part of climate justice. Oh, they say because of COVID-19 and because the climate change caused
[36:39.440 --> 36:45.120]  it, we've got to make XYZ changes. Exactly. It's always the same. And they also say that COVID-19
[36:45.120 --> 36:49.280]  is good because it's going to teach us to lower our carbon footprint. That's what this really is.
[36:50.160 --> 36:56.320]  Oh, it's exactly what it is because we have, I still have somebody inside the Sunrise Movement,
[36:56.320 --> 37:01.520]  Alex, and they have been doing their conferences still. And in these conferences, they actually
[37:01.520 --> 37:09.120]  discuss how they're using COVID-19 as a trigger point to enact this system shift. It's actually a
[37:09.120 --> 37:14.000]  system shift to the new normal. That's always what it's been. The new normal has nothing to do with
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.920]  COVID-19. They themselves talk within themselves about how they don't actually see it as that big
[37:19.920 --> 37:24.480]  of an issue, like pandemic-wise. Exactly. If I'm making a film about this right now, they admit in
[37:24.480 --> 37:28.480]  all their white papers, even in public publications at the highest level, that it's about training us
[37:28.480 --> 37:32.800]  that things aren't normal now. There's a new normal. You're going to be tracked. bureaucrats are going
[37:32.800 --> 37:37.120]  to come to your house. You're not going to have single family homes anymore. You're going to take
[37:37.120 --> 37:40.720]  inoculations. We're going to track you with your phone. We're going to reward you if you're good.
[37:40.720 --> 37:45.200]  We're going to punish you if you're bad. It is the Chinese Social Credit Score. It is a revolution.
[37:45.200 --> 37:51.440]  And COVID-19 is the cover. Yeah. And then talk about how he's going to establish a White House
[37:51.440 --> 37:56.560]  Environmental Justice Advisory Council and how he talks about many of these people on the White
[37:56.560 --> 38:02.240]  House Environmental Justice Council are going to be well-known activists. So I wonder, GAOC,
[38:02.240 --> 38:08.800]  you don't think she's going to be on there? Give me a break. It's just insane. And even outside
[38:08.800 --> 38:14.560]  of his environmental justice policies, he also has his clean energy policies where he talks about
[38:14.560 --> 38:22.080]  dismantling coal, dismantling these other energy systems and moving completely to 100% green energy
[38:22.080 --> 38:27.280]  and putting $2 trillion into the green energy sector. Well, at the same time, he talks about
[38:27.280 --> 38:33.840]  let's take back those Trump tax cuts from the American people because then we'll raise $2 trillion
[38:33.840 --> 38:40.240]  from them. So they want to take it from Americans and give it to these green energy giants who don't
[38:40.240 --> 38:44.240]  really need the government subsidies. Oh, of course. It's all about transferring power. And
[38:44.240 --> 38:48.880]  they admit from Spain that was under their control that the energy cost twice as much and had twice
[38:48.880 --> 38:53.680]  as big a carbon footprint as if that's a bad thing. When they picked carbon to regulate,
[38:53.680 --> 38:59.040]  they picked one fourth of the carbon cycle, light, water. And then, of course, you've got to have
[38:59.040 --> 39:03.040]  oxygen and you've got to have carbon dioxide. They pick carbon dioxide because it sounds scary. It's
[39:03.040 --> 39:08.640]  not. Put plants breathe to target that, as you know, Millie. And they're just raging forward.
[39:08.640 --> 39:13.440]  People say, oh, they'll never get this through. As we've seen with COVID-19, it's about big tech,
[39:13.440 --> 39:19.920]  big industry, green mafia working with the blue cities and states to implement this whether we
[39:19.920 --> 39:25.680]  like it or not. That's what the COVID-19 hoax is about. It's about all of these special interests
[39:25.680 --> 39:31.280]  and all of these corporations working in unison as a mafia to come in and muscle in. We need
[39:31.280 --> 39:35.920]  the government that we set up to protect our rights to now guard against this enemy attack.
[39:35.920 --> 39:40.240]  We've got Millennium Millie with us. Millie Weaver is here with us for another segment.
[39:40.240 --> 39:45.360]  We're going to come back and look at the other side of the pincer attack, not just Joe Biden,
[39:45.360 --> 39:54.000]  but these so-called virtual campaign events that are coming up and the virtual event that they're
[39:54.000 --> 40:01.040]  talking about cancelling already. CNN, USA Today and other mainstream media fake news outlets came
[40:01.040 --> 40:07.600]  out and said that a new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings,
[40:07.600 --> 40:13.840]  standing on top of an American flag, is Nazi. And they had the Soros-funded Snopes groups and
[40:13.840 --> 40:19.680]  others fact-checking to say, yes, now the American flag and yes, the American eagle are Nazis. No,
[40:19.680 --> 40:26.000]  George Soros that funds Snopes and Media Matters and the rest of them, he's the real Nazi collaborator.
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.240]  But this shirt, I think, is really the perfect campaign shirts. We've made one even better
[40:30.240 --> 40:34.400]  than what Trump's people came up with. Two different versions of it, with something even worse,
[40:34.400 --> 40:40.080]  the Betsy Ross flag, our first flag, that they also say is racist, even though she was a famous
[40:40.080 --> 40:46.320]  abolitionist. So these shirts are at infowars.com, they're the American eagle, Betsy Ross flags.
[40:46.320 --> 40:50.880]  Two different designs, guaranteed to spread the word and of course trigger lift cards everywhere.

[43:02.880 --> 43:09.280]  live darts. One of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party
[43:09.280 --> 43:15.200]  or at Halloween but on top of that they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to
[43:15.200 --> 43:19.920]  protect you from COVID-19 or anything else. It's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared
[43:19.920 --> 43:25.120]  for the force inoculations and contact tracing if they're openly announced. It's an active
[43:25.120 --> 43:29.920]  submission. It's an active like putting a burka on your head and bowing down. But a big reason to
[43:29.920 --> 43:34.480]  wear these is then in the stores when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween mask say
[43:34.480 --> 43:41.200]  it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing and the M95 mask only control
[43:41.200 --> 43:46.400]  what's coming in not what's going out so they quote spread COVID-19 they don't protect from it. So

[44:31.440 --> 44:38.720]  ago that outing at the Super Bowl ran ads with green police actual uniforms that liberal cities
[44:38.720 --> 44:43.680]  have set up with real police departments showing checkpoints on highways homes being swat teamed
[44:43.680 --> 44:48.640]  for not following the proper green edicts where then you have to adopt the technology that the
[44:48.640 --> 44:53.600]  Rothschilds literally own they own the global carbon exchange in london you have to pay them
[44:53.600 --> 44:59.120]  for every gallon of gas you use everything al gore bill clinton they're all heavily invested in
[44:59.120 --> 45:04.720]  these mercantiles but here's the green police ad preparing you for what's now here 10 years ago
[45:06.400 --> 45:13.600]  okay so it's 3708 paper plastic plastic that's the magic word green police you picked the wrong
[45:13.600 --> 45:34.240]  day to mess with the ecosystem plastic boy you install these bulbs tragedy strikes tonight
[45:34.240 --> 45:38.560]  where a man has just been arrested for possession of an incandescent light bulb what do you guys
[45:38.560 --> 45:51.360]  think about plastic bottles now the water setting is at 105 you're good to go sir
[45:55.440 --> 45:59.760]  you're a good globalist you get you get through the checkpoint you don't get arrested you get to
[45:59.760 --> 46:04.400]  leave your house you're wearing a mask you stay in your home you're good all a martial law drill
[46:04.400 --> 46:11.760]  and bill gates admits this is event 201 the real bio attack he says is coming millie weaver is joining
[46:11.760 --> 46:17.840]  us here getting into joe biden's nightmare un announcements that would destroy what's left
[46:17.840 --> 46:21.680]  of the midwest and some of the areas that have barely recovered after three and a half years of
[46:21.680 --> 46:27.760]  trump how on earth could anybody vote for joe biden in the midwest or in the east millie weaver
[46:28.800 --> 46:34.240]  i have no idea if you're voting for joe biden you're essentially voting for a new world order
[46:34.240 --> 46:39.760]  but see that's not the term that they use anymore alex they now use a liberal world order i kid you
[46:39.760 --> 46:45.280]  not they use that term within the sunrise movement within un within all of their talks they say
[46:45.280 --> 46:50.480]  liberal world order that's what they're going for and all of it surrounds climate justice and
[46:50.480 --> 46:56.720]  environmentalism so joe biden is going full till boogie down that road we discussed how the sunrise
[46:56.720 --> 47:02.160]  movement kind of extorted their way onto biden's climate task force by having all these girls
[47:02.160 --> 47:06.480]  within their movement start to threaten and claim that they're going to have hashtag me too
[47:07.840 --> 47:14.240]  political stunts against joe biden next thing you know joe biden says oh aoc and you broke this
[47:14.240 --> 47:19.680]  you broke this a month ago and now we're seeing the fruit of how soros plays dirty just incredible
[47:20.720 --> 47:27.920]  yes it's very incredible so joe biden is just as extreme as senator sanders or any of those other
[47:27.920 --> 47:34.800]  politicians that were running he's no better and joe biden another thing is he's coming for your guns
[47:34.800 --> 47:39.760]  you know we'd hear you know not only does he want to grab your daughter but he wants to grab your
[47:39.760 --> 47:46.560]  guns so watch out joe biden has his policies laid out on his website he's coming for your ar-15 he
[47:46.560 --> 47:52.160]  says he's going to do the buyback programs he's going to confiscate the ar-15s or assault weapons
[47:52.160 --> 47:56.400]  which is a very vague term and by the way millie as you know your everything you're saying we put
[47:56.400 --> 48:00.560]  with the cfr saying we're now the liberal world order we're going to use race for for control
[48:01.200 --> 48:06.320]  joe biden officially two weeks ago adopted bernie sanders entire platform what do you think is
[48:06.320 --> 48:09.920]  going to happen to the convention they're trying to make everything virtual i don't think trump should
[48:09.920 --> 48:13.440]  give into the sphere he should have his convention the democrats are going to have a virtual convention
[48:13.440 --> 48:18.960]  oh you're going to be covering it yes i think i think trump needs to push forward as he would have
[48:18.960 --> 48:23.680]  normally pushed forward i think the reason they're creating all of this is to try to hide the fact
[48:23.680 --> 48:28.800]  that joe biden doesn't have as much of support as they would hope for him to have try to hide the
[48:28.800 --> 48:34.640]  fact that he's really weak at debating he has issues from his strokes and whatever else but
[48:34.640 --> 48:38.800]  i mean they know that his policies are going to be called out they know that trump is going to
[48:38.800 --> 48:43.760]  be the person to lay out just how bad joe biden is and i think that they're just trying to avoid
[48:43.760 --> 48:49.440]  that they're trying to avoid any messy smears that might happen well that's that they're trying to
[48:49.440 --> 48:53.440]  muffle and shut down the president they don't want people to challenge biden at the convention
[48:53.440 --> 48:58.480]  but they want to challenge trump at the convention and if it's virtual that will make it a lot easier
[48:58.480 --> 49:03.200]  to do and there's not real people there so everybody needs to go to that convention uh milley pulling
[49:03.200 --> 49:08.800]  back from this uh in the aftermath of you exposing these these globalist funded sunrise movement
[49:08.800 --> 49:14.800]  and soros uh what's the latest i know you're working on part three of that report okay so
[49:14.800 --> 49:20.480]  like i said we still have an undercover within their collecting information um some of the stuff
[49:20.480 --> 49:28.400]  that's going on is uh that we're following slack accounts which they're utilizing to actually uh
[49:28.400 --> 49:33.360]  search out children that are elementary age previously we discussed how they were targeting
[49:33.360 --> 49:39.360]  middle school and high school age kids the slack accounts um they are now going into that and
[49:39.360 --> 49:44.240]  searching out elementary age kids they're they're kind of moving to an even younger generation
[49:44.240 --> 49:48.080]  this is a long because that's what predators do i mean they need somebody that doesn't know what's
[49:48.080 --> 49:54.560]  their surroundings that they can creep over to okay so we have aoc and other progressive
[49:54.560 --> 49:59.040]  democrats talking about how they're raising funds in china and other foreign countries
[49:59.040 --> 50:03.600]  so how can you be raising campaign funds in other foreign countries it makes you wonder
[50:03.600 --> 50:07.920]  do they know that this is illegal or are they just being so bold and blatant that they're not
[50:07.920 --> 50:12.320]  worried about it i mean well so you've got that with the undercover info coming out
[50:12.320 --> 50:22.320]  yeah we've we've got what appears to be ii operations using phone systems uh with
[50:22.320 --> 50:30.320]  autumn automatic generated text message systems that got leaked out to even message boards on
[50:30.320 --> 50:36.560]  4chan hn i know you've got a lot of great sources millie what are they saying about the twitter
[50:37.200 --> 50:41.440]  hack i mean from my info that's patriot u.s intelligence penetrating all the private
[50:41.440 --> 50:45.600]  messages of the top level is letting them know they've been compromised and that the bitcoin
[50:45.600 --> 50:51.760]  thing is just a cover i don't know about the twitter hack but i know about this other hack
[50:51.760 --> 50:57.840]  that happened where they put this information out for this ii shadow net type dashboard operation
[50:57.840 --> 51:05.600]  where other people on 4chan hn are now able to troll the the contacts the mega contacts think
[51:05.600 --> 51:10.640]  of all the people that send their email out to like aoc's campaign illhan omer's campaign
[51:10.640 --> 51:17.920]  biden's campaign you know burning all them right that all that data is collected the emails right
[51:17.920 --> 51:24.000]  that all got leaked out through a like a shadow net type dashboard on 4chan hn and now you have
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.960]  other people in other countries sending out bulk messages to these people like oh like just like
[51:28.960 --> 51:34.240]  twitter donate money to whatever none enough they'll bulk send it out to people's phones and they'll
[51:34.240 --> 51:37.920]  they'll think they're getting it from like illhan omer's campaign but they're actually getting it
[51:37.920 --> 51:43.120]  from some foreigner in another country and they're donating money to them i mean it's just all out
[51:43.120 --> 51:51.200]  chaos is ensuing i mean it's pretty well but that has more to do with the a on the ii a shadow net
[51:51.200 --> 51:56.080]  aspect that we talked about um the other time i went on the show the democrats have let so many
[51:56.080 --> 52:00.000]  criminals into their system they're just got criminals in there stealing the data and selling it
[52:00.000 --> 52:08.560]  yeah it's really bad and remind you this is psyop psychological warfare tools that were developed
[52:08.560 --> 52:14.320]  for the military through private contracts and the private contracts were able to maintain the
[52:14.320 --> 52:20.960]  rights to that software and uh through and by the way twitter is now confirming that that dashboard
[52:20.960 --> 52:26.000]  and all that's basically real and it was employee tools so the head of twitter has been caught red
[52:26.000 --> 52:33.200]  handed lying to congress millie i believe it i believe it i mean it's wild what's going on with
[52:33.200 --> 52:38.480]  silicon valley and big tech and how corrupt they are it's all being exposed we've seen what project
[52:38.480 --> 52:43.760]  veritas has been doing and james o'keith have been doing it's amazing work they're exposing the the
[52:43.760 --> 52:51.200]  shadow banning the bias all that but there's also other operations on the social media companies
[52:51.200 --> 52:58.000]  that the social media companies are not stopping but they're not part of necessarily and these are
[52:58.000 --> 53:03.840]  ia operations internet interactive activity operations by intelligence contractors and let's
[53:03.840 --> 53:08.960]  explain obama eight years ago quote legalized the cia engaging in domestic propaganda that
[53:08.960 --> 53:13.280]  meant all the money all of it and trump never got control of that that's still all operating
[53:14.000 --> 53:18.720]  outside of things i i've challenged Pompeo and bar to do something about it it looks like
[53:18.720 --> 53:23.040]  they're beginning to take control of that i can't get into the specifics of an ass not to
[53:23.040 --> 53:27.760]  but i can tell people that google has been partially recaptured by us intelligence it was
[53:27.760 --> 53:31.840]  always set up by us intelligence but it had been handed over to multinationals of the chinese so
[53:32.800 --> 53:40.080]  as far as google goes about three weeks ago they began to buckle uh to to whatever this internal
[53:40.080 --> 53:47.280]  war is millie yeah you know they act interestingly obama actually made that rule where he legalized
[53:47.280 --> 53:53.360]  propaganda not long after the creation and development of shadow net and then when they
[53:53.360 --> 53:58.000]  then privatized it was like boom all right let's legalize propaganda let's start deploying these
[53:58.000 --> 54:01.840]  on social media and you can actually see that shift change from when facebook was just all
[54:01.840 --> 54:07.600]  family pictures happy and fun to then boom it's all political propaganda and these are
[54:07.600 --> 54:12.080]  psychological operations being deployed on the american public sure for those that don't know
[54:12.080 --> 54:18.080]  we're not speculating it's all on record that the cia had this for war zones and then obama
[54:18.080 --> 54:22.240]  eight years ago legalized it for deployment against the american people and now katie by the door
[54:22.240 --> 54:27.040]  but that's where info wars comes in organic resistance with the truth against the enemy
[54:27.040 --> 54:31.680]  five minutes of millie weaver then i'm gonna get into the latest on the twitter hack the latest on
[54:31.680 --> 54:35.280]  the covet 19 hoax and where it's going and so much more please stay with us hour number two is
[54:35.280 --> 54:38.800]  straight ahead i want to ask millie from her sources what she thinks trumps about to do and
[54:38.800 --> 54:43.360]  is he taking the gloves off my intel is he is we're 108 days off the election this is a critical
[54:43.360 --> 54:49.840]  time stay with us it's christmas in july we ran the sale last year it was very very popular
[54:49.840 --> 54:55.440]  and so i am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020 a very important election
[54:55.440 --> 55:01.840]  year and we have some fabulous new shirts that i think should be the campaign shirt of 2020 it's
[55:01.840 --> 55:07.680]  the american eagle boldly spreading its wings sitting at top of betsy ross playing and the
[55:07.680 --> 55:13.760]  shirts are on sale right now and for store.com i got the idea from the trump campaign having a
[55:13.760 --> 55:18.800]  similar shirt to be called noncy which of course it isn't and since it's so triggering to the leftist
[55:18.800 --> 55:23.120]  the globalist well we're gonna make sure there's even more of these on the streets to spread the
[55:23.120 --> 55:28.080]  word and exercise our first amendment in the face of each time it's we also have store-wide free
[55:28.080 --> 55:33.200]  shipping double patriotic points so whatever great item it is that you want store-wide free

[55:42.000 --> 55:49.040]  let's take advantage of it right now at four store.com Americans have had freedom for so long
[55:49.040 --> 55:55.040]  and most americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history that we
[55:55.040 --> 56:00.320]  really have a blind spot for tyranny we don't appreciate the american way truth justice
[56:00.320 --> 56:04.320]  due process the right to self-defense private property because we've had it so long we just
[56:04.320 --> 56:09.600]  think that's how the rest of the world is ladies and gentlemen the renaissance the social contract
[56:09.600 --> 56:14.720]  that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to
[56:14.720 --> 56:20.160]  empower the weak as well as the strong is something the west invented and that's what made our modern
[56:20.160 --> 56:25.840]  world that's now been hijacked by the technocrats by the globalist who say humans are ugly and bad
[56:25.840 --> 56:31.280]  for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites
[56:31.280 --> 56:35.920]  dominate manipulate and command you're even lucky enough to stay alive and that's what
[56:35.920 --> 56:42.560]  covid-19 is a global un revolution against free humanity against your family against
[56:42.560 --> 56:45.760]  prosperity and against your future if you don't stand up and fight you deserve what you get
[56:45.760 --> 56:55.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[57:02.400 --> 57:05.760]  the west is the best
[57:05.760 --> 57:13.760]  the west is the best
[57:19.120 --> 57:27.760]  get here and we'll do the rest
[57:27.760 --> 57:31.760]  the
[57:31.920 --> 57:37.200]  billy weaver's our guest i'm alex jones your host and we're living in such epic times
[57:38.000 --> 57:43.440]  people overuse that term such incredible times i have trouble finding words to describe how
[57:43.440 --> 57:49.440]  amazing they are trumps completely for real loves america trying to get us a fair deal
[57:49.440 --> 57:55.200]  isn't for the new world order he's pulling us out all these wars he's battling the chai comms
[57:55.200 --> 57:57.920]  he now understands that fouchy and gates are running a scam on him
[57:59.600 --> 58:03.520]  because it's hard to believe that the audience of this show and and and our guest
[58:03.520 --> 58:10.000]  we know more than trump does because he's inculcated in all these dis info operations and
[58:10.000 --> 58:14.720]  all these schools of thought where the people in them actually don't know what they're operating in
[58:15.360 --> 58:20.480]  they're compartmentalized we are not in fact we should even call ourselves info wars we are
[58:20.480 --> 58:26.880]  decompartmentalized generalists who've studied history and who have been immersed myself since
[58:26.880 --> 58:32.480]  childhood in real politic and those of us that are into all this we just think everybody knows
[58:32.480 --> 58:36.960]  this information they don't the average person doesn't know the three branches of government
[58:38.080 --> 58:43.360]  and and and trump just thinks well promote americana and they'll like it and globalism is a bad deal
[58:44.720 --> 58:48.720]  but there are people that are ideology whose ideology is to destroy america
[58:48.720 --> 58:53.760]  that's their cult trump's like here here's money here's power join us he's like why don't you join
[58:53.760 --> 58:58.800]  us this is a better deal for everybody because they're evil trump and trump now knows it's a
[58:58.800 --> 59:03.840]  fight between good and evil he's definitely got jesus he's drunk the kool-aid in a good way so in
[59:03.840 --> 59:08.800]  closing milley weaver what is your view on trump the election with 108 days out and what do you
[59:08.800 --> 59:17.760]  think's coming next well i'm gonna be careful how i say this but there may or may not be some
[59:17.760 --> 59:27.840]  joint four stars uh having some problems on tuesday pertaining to the new york times op-ed but
[59:27.840 --> 59:34.480]  that's all i can say so as far as what's coming next that seems to be in the works we're talking
[59:34.480 --> 59:39.600]  about how all the top generals have pissed on the president publicly ahead of the calls for a coup
[59:39.600 --> 59:44.080]  against the president they think they're getting brownie points and word is there's gonna be moves
[59:44.080 --> 59:50.400]  against them training the swamp you know i mean president trump is doing his best to get it done
[59:50.960 --> 59:55.280]  and people take that for granted because they don't see all the things that happen behind the
[59:55.280 --> 59:58.880]  scene do they have any idea how dangerous or crazy that is or how these people lie to their faces
[1:00:00.480 --> 1:00:06.560]  yeah they lie they there's there's a lot of sabotage treason going on within the government
[1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:11.920]  but there's also a lot of whistleblowers that come forward and speak to credible reporters
[1:00:11.920 --> 1:00:18.000]  and try to get information out they want to destroy the swamp even though the swamp they
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:22.160]  used to operate from within the swamp but they see that the swamp is actually destroying the
[1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:27.280]  country and hates america so you have those patriots out there who want to go and whistle
[1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:31.280]  blow the whistle you know and take that new york times writer or that new york times editor
[1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:37.840]  she said they don't want america to exist this is an anti-american cult exactly lady what do you
[1:00:37.840 --> 1:00:43.200]  think you're part of you're part of a chai calm globalist op to destroy the country and finally
[1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:48.240]  a lot of liberals and leftists are going whoa what did i sign on to this is stupid yeah you're
[1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:54.080]  gonna lose everything you got dumbasses yeah it's pretty bad it's pretty bad you've got a lot of
[1:00:54.080 --> 1:00:59.360]  obama holdover problems still within the trump administration and the problem is is they were
[1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:03.840]  left in office there after obama left he did an executive order to make it so they would all
[1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:10.320]  have to stay behind so he pulled a little trick right before he left office and that that coincided
[1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:16.080]  with his whole spying on the trump campaign maneuver that he did as well so trump has been
[1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:22.560]  you know messed up from the get go right out of the gate and i really hope to see him get reelected
[1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:26.880]  and then see what he does with this next term because it's going to be easier for him once he's
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:31.680]  able to vet more and more of these swamp creatures out from within his own administration
[1:01:31.680 --> 1:01:38.960]  well said millie where do people find your great work you can go to milleniamillie.com and of course

[1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:08.320]  gas once again filling downtown portland streets overnight as federal officers take on protesters
[1:03:08.320 --> 1:03:12.720]  president trump again praising this federal response here in portland lisa balick live
[1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:21.360]  downtown with more on all this lisa yeah remember occupy portland where tents were set up for months
[1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:26.320]  here in the city parks while we're starting to see that happen again at the same time federal
[1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:34.640]  officers are dealing with protesters in the streets tear gas filling up the street out front
[1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:39.760]  of the federal courthouse early this morning as homeland security officers tried to disperse
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:44.560]  protesters some coin six news employees headed in for the morning news at our nearby building
[1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:50.640]  saw the canisters deployed the federal action came after demonstrators last night set up barricades
[1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:56.240]  in the streets by the courthouse police say the agitators threw glass bottles and pointed lasers
[1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:01.200]  portland officers backed off and did not use tear gas but they're very concerned about the
[1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:06.880]  tents set up now in lawnsdale square they want city leaders to order the tents dismantled before
[1:04:06.880 --> 1:04:12.640]  it becomes another occupy portland situation so why let a problem grow as it's growing right now as
[1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:17.040]  opposed to doing something about it in the early stages and being proactive instead of being reactive
[1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:21.520]  in four to five weeks we know how it started before and anybody who's been here has a historical
[1:04:21.520 --> 1:04:26.320]  perspective and i see it happening again what are you doing also overnight multiple videos on
[1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:31.680]  social media showing federal officers driving an unmarked van downtown getting out going up to at
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:37.280]  least one protester and getting them into the van then taking off without identifying themselves
[1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:41.120]  we reached out to the department of homeland security who were told is the agency with
[1:04:41.120 --> 1:04:46.160]  officers here on the streets we've not gotten comment back after seeing the video today
[1:04:46.160 --> 1:04:51.280]  senator widen wants to know who's in charge of those officers saying when donald trump sends
[1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:56.560]  federal law enforcement into portland with no accountability core questions about the physical
[1:04:56.560 --> 1:05:02.880]  safety and civil liberties of peaceful protesters are sure to follow meanwhile president trump today
[1:05:02.880 --> 1:05:08.160]  praised federal police actions here we're doing a great job in portland portland was very rough
[1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:16.080]  and they called us in and we did a good job all right we are back now why did i start this hour
[1:05:16.080 --> 1:05:22.800]  with that i've watched probably 30 minutes of footage of what's going on there just last night
[1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:28.400]  you have antifa sent in by the democrats sent in by george soros with battle plans and action plans
[1:05:28.400 --> 1:05:34.800]  that we received from inside their criminal operation three years ago of how they direct this
[1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:39.520]  to try to get the general public to burn down federal buildings and other structures there's
[1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:43.920]  footage we played a few days ago of them ripping open doors with crowbars going into the federal
[1:05:43.920 --> 1:05:47.840]  building parking garage and then having to be thrown out yeah here's some footage right here
[1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:54.000]  here these are people breaking into federal buildings breaking into the federal courthouse
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:01.040]  so they can try to loot it with a hammer and then they get upset and the headlines are oh secret

[1:06:13.520 --> 1:06:18.400]  hostage rescue team so that it's the military and that's why you're getting grabbed and why they're
[1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:23.440]  driving you off and then you're getting interrogated because you work for a foreign power you work with

[1:06:51.920 --> 1:07:00.000]  videos today of antifa physically attacking people at at checkpoints they set up and be
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:12.560]  on one of them was that paralyzed man in his car and they attacked him and beating up old

[1:07:17.440 --> 1:07:22.800]  oh that's i mean now they're going to give over federal buildings to these people and then you
[1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:27.920]  wonder why when you're crowbarring in to burn down a federal building why military comes out
[1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:35.840]  waiting for you i guarantee you they had crosshairs on your fat ass as well i mean this is out of
[1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:45.360]  control this is civil war this is bs to overturn our elected constitutional protections and bring
[1:07:45.360 --> 1:07:53.520]  in red commie globalist terror i'm sick of it those people those antifa slimes are lucky their necks
[1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:58.320]  weren't broken after they've been hitting old people in the head with hammers and crap just
[1:07:58.320 --> 1:08:02.880]  believe me the people that arrested you and took you in for questioning to get your paperwork of
[1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:09.920]  who you're working for would love to break your communist neck you cowardly pieces of trash all
[1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:16.160]  right i'ma stop ranting right there all right let's just keep saying i'm gonna get to the
[1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:26.880]  covid news and i and i haven't gotten to it yet because it's such big news and it's so over the top
[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:35.040]  oh look federal law enforcement officers use gas and flashbanks to disperse the crown poor babies
[1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:39.680]  after we set things on fire beat up old people hit people in the head with hammers tried to burn
[1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:44.240]  down the federal building broke into broke into the building and after we ran around attacking
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:50.400]  everyone and you didn't uh i mean it's it's a joke they're trying to get this response
[1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:58.720]  this isn't the feds under clinton trying to get money burning down a church in texas i was totally
[1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:03.200]  against that because they could have arrested david koresh who was a cult leader and a weirdo
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:08.160]  every day he worked in town and the sheriff came out they wanted that confrontation and the atf
[1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:14.400]  opened fire first they were in the wrong the feds aren't the wrong here folks
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:21.840]  and most the feds at the top are globalist but they're not globalist low level and and there's
[1:09:21.840 --> 1:09:27.920]  literally a destabilization to intimidate every form of authority to bow to soros and the new
[1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:34.400]  world order so they're in control of our lives do you want that and the answer is no let me hit the
[1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:38.640]  twitter thing and i'll let the covet news next segment have a special guest filmmaker joining us
[1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:47.600]  in studio this is what we need to see more of what happened to twitter is beautiful i love bill
[1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:54.240]  gates and bezos and all these anti-american slugs they got rich off our system but hated
[1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:59.200]  who were in bed with the globalists in the chai comes i love it i love your private messages
[1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:04.720]  or ours i love the fact that the media is so stupid that they took the cover story that it's
[1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:11.440]  about bitcoin and i love the fact that all the internal tools are out there now that that obviously
[1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:15.920]  trump has and knows what's going on and we need to see more of this we need to see cnn
[1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:22.320]  hacked we need to see the democratic party hacked again we need to see everybody in bed with the
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:27.440]  chai comes you know bar came out with a shot across the bound of speech two days ago we played
[1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:33.840]  earlier in the first hour when he said look apple won't give us the code keys to to actual al-qaeda
[1:10:33.840 --> 1:10:38.480]  killers that we you know that have been shot dead in the u.s killing people at a naval base
[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:45.200]  naval air station but you you you give china the codes well it's on record two years ago
[1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:50.400]  and i remember talking to the winehouse and literally talking to a bunch of other people
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:56.240]  instant claire tv about it eric boling and others i said hey you're having dinner with the president
[1:10:56.240 --> 1:11:02.480]  tonight i said give him this reuters article he's like i didn't know this this is a six months old
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:07.600]  they have the code keys and access to all iPhones on the planet and all devices and i said yeah
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:11.440]  they won't give the federal government that and they shouldn't without a warrant you know but see
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:15.920]  it's like red carpet for the chai comes red carpet red carpet red carpet nothing
[1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:21.840]  listen the federal government's a separation of powers it's something we set up a long time ago
[1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:25.040]  supposedly guard our freedoms of course it's corrupted out of control everything gets that
[1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:30.240]  way over time but we'll use it to defeat the chai comms and the globalists it's the weapon we have
[1:11:31.040 --> 1:11:36.880]  we can reform it now and later and whatever but if you think the federal government's your enemy
[1:11:37.600 --> 1:11:41.520]  compared to the chai comms and hollywood and big tech you're an idiot
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:48.240]  we need the federal government to clean out the globalist clean out the democrat operatives
[1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:53.120]  clean out the whole behinds from from comey and the hillary and all them that still think they're
[1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:58.560]  going to win that's why comey and clapper always stay behind we'll defeat trump keep doing what
[1:11:58.560 --> 1:12:03.760]  you're doing those are a fifth column of idiot trash that as soon as the indictments against
[1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:11.440]  major players begin they will all turn and run to the exits and i know the globalists have blackmail
[1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:15.520]  on a lot of republican leaders for petty stuff the american people aren't going to care if they
[1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:19.120]  expose your mistress they're not going to care about some stuff like that as long as you're fighting
[1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:24.560]  for the country stop letting them blackmail you you're not having sexual little kids you're not
[1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:30.480]  devil worshiping you're not a chinese spy stop being afraid you better be afraid of what they're
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:37.760]  gonna do if they continue down this road total war not just domestic not just insurrection
[1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:44.320]  not just civil war but chai com war the chai comms are watching and they think we're weak and they
[1:12:44.320 --> 1:12:49.600]  think we're stupid we need to stop acting like it i'll give you the big news when we come back on
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:57.840]  the cup of 19 stay with us imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle of 2020 the
[1:12:57.840 --> 1:13:04.000]  democrats as well as many republican leaders will be calling for the united nations who edict
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:12.240]  that all americans wear masks be a quote federal order and mandate totally unconstitutional
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:18.640]  legal annihilating states rights think about that a woman can kill her baby you pay for
[1:13:18.640 --> 1:13:25.520]  illegal aliens health care but you've got to wear a mask for a virus that killed 20 plus times
[1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:31.040]  less than what they said even if you believe the official story this is about the who the
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:37.520]  globe was testing their power through the media over the federal government to set policy in the
[1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:42.800]  united states this is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the paris accorded
[1:13:42.800 --> 1:13:49.120]  all of it and by the way they admit that they say now your carbon's down one way or another you
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:56.800]  stupid americans the reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown the number one
[1:13:56.800 --> 1:14:04.000]  reason is it serves every one of their purposes we've gone over those purposes many times here on
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:09.360]  air the casual society the surveillance system global government medical tyranny forced in
[1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:15.760]  oculation but the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete that we are
[1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:24.160]  non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that
[1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:31.440]  people once had by design this isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into it's
[1:14:31.440 --> 1:14:37.520]  been pre-planned organized globally and it's extremely predatory and through governmental
[1:14:37.520 --> 1:14:44.400]  actuaries and tax programs and regulations the central banks that control it all are able to
[1:14:44.400 --> 1:14:51.600]  pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power this is the truest form of technocracy fascism
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:15:03.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:32.160]  so let's get into covet 19 right now in the latest developments on that front
[1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:38.880]  it is a total fraud it's a total lie we've gone over that a hundred times how they take people
[1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:42.800]  that die of other things and put it in the list of covet how most the tests say you're positive
[1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:48.000]  how one person's positive they then say 15 around you are positive and then 15 more that's how they
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  jack the numbers way up and so trump knows this and we've said sideline Fauci then discredited him
[1:15:54.560 --> 1:15:59.840]  and then call for his indictment because he and bill gates are heavily invested in all the major
[1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:07.840]  vaccines and that's now coming out and so trump is doing that remember 333 clinics this is ongoing
[1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:14.160]  in florida had 100 percent positives with hundreds and hundreds of tests per day per facility
[1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:22.480]  so here's some of the headlines fatal motorcycle crash listed as covet 19 in florida says state of
[1:16:22.480 --> 1:16:30.720]  visual kit daniels in full wars dot com virus pandemic drastic measures as death toll sets record
[1:16:30.720 --> 1:16:35.760]  ap and they look at counties that had no deaths before and have a few now that they're doing
[1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:42.080]  testing and they go oh it's a spike in that area that's how they manipulate the statistics even though
[1:16:42.080 --> 1:16:51.440]  deaths are way down task force reports says 18 states in coronavirus red zone should roll back
[1:16:51.440 --> 1:17:02.240]  reopening disappearance of covet 19 data from cdc website spurs outcry well the cdc's run by fouchy
[1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:06.880]  has been proven to be a total lie and a total fraud and is designed to keep us closed good
[1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:12.160]  trump runs the federal government cut him off cut it out shut it down find out what the real
[1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:18.240]  numbers are and release that trump is preparing to bring out fouchy's total fraud it's beautiful
[1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:24.000]  us shatters coronavirus record with 77 000 cases in one day because the testing facilities are
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:34.800]  everywhere and everyone now in many cases is positive and it goes on from there mark zuckerberg
[1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:41.600]  tells fouchy trump is to blame for us being significantly worse than other countries oh
[1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:48.240]  really the deaths are way down and the the numbers are way up because it's a fraud but oh look at
[1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:52.800]  fouchy and zuckerberg they're up there telling us how the world works remember zuckerberg works
[1:17:52.800 --> 1:17:59.840]  poor bill gates and it's his protege and makes his money tax free he's not a person giving his
[1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:05.840]  money away he's making it tax free he's not a philanthropist he doesn't pay taxes he's a
[1:18:05.840 --> 1:18:13.120]  globalist he's in that elite club 64 distrust trump on coronavirus pandemic approval declines
[1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:19.680]  as cases grow just like they told you new york times hillary had a 97 chance of winning and
[1:18:19.680 --> 1:18:25.520]  trump was 40 points behind now they say he's 15 points behind but this works if you believe the
[1:18:25.520 --> 1:18:30.480]  line go well i'm not for trump now everybody turned against him that's how these manipulative
[1:18:30.480 --> 1:18:38.160]  polls work it's how they operate can california contain coronavirus surge next two weeks will
[1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:44.960]  be critical oh it's always two more weeks la times two more weeks flatten the curve two more weeks to

[1:26:49.440 --> 1:27:06.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:19.040]  got a special guest in studio she had one of the top films the south by southwest on incels
[1:27:19.040 --> 1:27:22.400]  and it got censored she's going to re-release it we're talking about just a moment but first
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:27.360]  this report is so important the truth behind the mask you're being inducted to a globalist cult of
[1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:36.480]  submission first we were told that wearing masks would do more harm than good which is what the
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:44.560]  science still supports but now even as the COVID-19 pandemic is turning out to be less harmful than
[1:27:44.560 --> 1:27:53.760]  the seasonal flu we are being told to wear the mask. Boston Texas has threatened a $2,000 fine
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:28:00.960]  for those not wearing the mask and they've even suggested that we wear the mask while at home
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:04.880]  we still need people to wear the mask in public we still need people to keep social distance
[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:09.440]  in isolation Ryan the one thing i want to try to get across today is we need to do that when
[1:28:09.440 --> 1:28:15.520]  we're in our homes also science tells us that these masks are doing nothing but hurting our
[1:28:15.520 --> 1:28:22.720]  natural immune system so why is it so important that we wear the mask if one were to look at what
[1:28:22.720 --> 1:28:29.440]  is happening as if it were a massive initiation ritual then things may begin to make more sense
[1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:37.600]  the initiation ritual can be found throughout all of human history we find it in ancient tribes
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:46.000]  and religions all the way up to modern gangs fraternities and in the military psychological
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:52.960]  studies have taught us how initiation rituals work primarily how they increase a person's desire
[1:28:52.960 --> 1:29:01.120]  to conform to the group they are being initiated into the ritual is almost always the same first
[1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:08.880]  the initiate is isolated their familiar everyday routines are disrupted and their normal rules of
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:16.640]  living are altered the initiates are made to look the same their heads may be shaved they may be
[1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:24.160]  given matching outfits or they may be instructed to wear a mask these techniques symbolically strip
[1:29:24.160 --> 1:29:30.080]  the initiate of their unique identity so they can cease seeing themselves as an individual
[1:29:30.800 --> 1:29:38.080]  and begin seeing themselves as part of the group the wearer of the mask loses his previous
[1:29:38.080 --> 1:29:45.920]  identity and assumes a new one the initiate is then subjected to just enough trauma to put them
[1:29:45.920 --> 1:29:52.880]  in a mild state of cognitive dissonance this dissonance puts the initiate into a state of
[1:29:52.880 --> 1:30:00.080]  confusion and anxiety they are now ready to be transformed into a member of the initiating group
[1:30:00.080 --> 1:30:07.360]  in their isolation thoughts they have ignored or buried for years suddenly become unavoidable
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:14.320]  emotions are triggered and a new window of thought is opened within the initiates mind
[1:30:15.600 --> 1:30:24.480]  and in this state the new normal is introduced this worldwide initiation ritual is creating
[1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:32.000]  a massive separation in humanity the obedient and the defiant are being drawn apart like a
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:38.960]  chemistry purification experiment and it would seem that the obedient ones are being initiated
[1:30:38.960 --> 1:30:50.080]  into something the new normal the new age the new world order a world where science no longer matters
[1:30:50.080 --> 1:31:00.160]  a world where blind obedience is all that is respected and if this is a worldwide initiation
[1:31:00.160 --> 1:31:07.280]  ritual then we can certainly expect the obedient initiated to be turned against the rest of us
[1:31:07.280 --> 1:31:20.080]  for info wars.com this is greg reese
[1:31:29.920 --> 1:31:35.280]  all right alex lee moyer is a filmmaker and she's put out a film that when they canceled
[1:31:35.280 --> 1:31:39.600]  official selfless of us would have the virtual one was a number one and now that kind of messed up
[1:31:39.600 --> 1:31:44.240]  their release of us they're about to re-release it and she's here with us it deals with incels which
[1:31:44.240 --> 1:31:50.400]  is a really important subject guys that's involuntarily uh celibate individuals and you see that on
[1:31:50.400 --> 1:31:55.840]  4chan you see on hn there's some good work that goes on there uh but there's also just a lot of
[1:31:55.840 --> 1:32:00.400]  hating women and that's just one half the human society and so you do that the globalists have
[1:32:00.400 --> 1:32:06.160]  split us again men need to go in and and save women from the new world order women need to save men
[1:32:06.160 --> 1:32:11.040]  from the new world order we need to come together that's the power that's what scares the system but
[1:32:11.040 --> 1:32:16.240]  let's talk about your film i can't wait to watch it i can't wait till it's a re-release alex lee
[1:32:16.240 --> 1:32:20.000]  moyer thanks for coming in with us thanks alex it's a great honor well it's an honor to talk to
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:26.880]  you so so so tell us about the film and just your boil now well um it's basically a film about uh
[1:32:26.880 --> 1:32:34.240]  basically uh disaffected generation of young men who spend their time mostly online a lot of them
[1:32:34.240 --> 1:32:41.840]  are autodidactic uh having not finished school and coming from sometimes challenging home situations
[1:32:41.840 --> 1:32:48.480]  so it's really sort of a socio-cultural kind of examination of a topic that sort of gets treated
[1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:53.600]  like kind of bloody by the liberal medias as just taking a group of people calling them dangerous
[1:32:53.600 --> 1:32:58.720]  rather than dealing with the the actual underpinnings of the phenomenon and i know chris rock tweeted
[1:32:58.720 --> 1:33:03.280]  about your film and he had a chance to see an early version that this is black males broken
[1:33:03.280 --> 1:33:08.640]  away from their father and family get into gangs and get into jail white males predominantly just
[1:33:08.640 --> 1:33:13.600]  become crazy perverts that hate women and i mean still it's the same thing with a broken family
[1:33:14.240 --> 1:33:19.440]  yes and i just slight correction it was actually uh chris rock had a message relayed to me through
[1:33:19.440 --> 1:33:24.960]  a friend and what he had rather than tweeting it but what he had said was this movie shows um this
[1:33:24.960 --> 1:33:30.880]  generation of white men is dealing with what generations of black men have dealt with maybe
[1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:35.680]  further the first time and sort of like the 20th century on the same scale absolutely so so i mean
[1:33:35.680 --> 1:33:40.880]  how big is this in cell movement i wouldn't call it a movement and i would i would well i mean but
[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:44.960]  they kind of have come come together into what they're doing yeah i mean there's people who
[1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:49.040]  definitely take it seriously as a movement the people the subjects of my film who have profiled
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:53.600]  i don't think that they would self identify as in cells i look at in cells with being mainly as a
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:34:01.760]  a media pejorative that that was later on taken on by certain individuals is more serious and some
[1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:07.600]  ironically um in this case i think these people this movie has been labeled the in cell movie but
[1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:12.160]  when i set out to make this movie i thought i was making a movie about what i saw is like
[1:34:12.160 --> 1:34:16.640]  maybe a mental health crisis among sure and you're right i shouldn't call it a movement i mean what
[1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:24.560]  is this it's a class a rise of a class of people so who is the average in cell um well the average
[1:34:24.560 --> 1:34:31.040]  in cell i mean but let's for just for the sake of the conversation uh instead of in cells maybe
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:36.480]  will say needs no education employment or training so that's the acronym is it no future they think
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:42.960]  right and so it's usually guys between um and they see women as vapid and empty on averages like men
[1:34:42.960 --> 1:34:47.920]  are and they see that solace as they go abandon sometimes and sometimes they just harness that
[1:34:47.920 --> 1:34:52.800]  humor because that's the desensitized form of ironic humor that's been popularized on fourchan
[1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:58.320]  and while they may not necessarily be dangerous to women that form of humor has become sort of
[1:34:58.320 --> 1:35:06.480]  popularized and accepted and sort of weaponized um but it's usually guys who drop out of high
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:10.960]  school who come from challenging home situations usually with absentee parents either because
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:16.960]  their parents are online or their parents are you know drunk or their parents are you know
[1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:21.440]  whatever their father's left their home or he's deployed in the military in some cases
[1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:27.680]  and there are people who just sort of self raise themselves um on fourchan and they've developed
[1:35:27.680 --> 1:35:32.800]  a sense of community and not blaming fourchan but this is pretty much all the mass shooters now
[1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:38.720]  uh a lot of the mass shooters yeah sure a lot of the mass shooters come from places like fourchan
[1:35:38.720 --> 1:35:44.560]  and hn and again they're pissed off that girls don't like them and so they think they're gonna
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:49.600]  exact some revenge it's just total loser behavior somebody should get them a hooker i mean you
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:53.440]  know you you get the pump prime number it's very feminist thing for me to say but no i mean seriously
[1:35:53.440 --> 1:35:57.200]  i just feel sorry for these guys because they just they've never gotten even training wheels they've
[1:35:57.200 --> 1:36:00.880]  never gone out in the world they've never had success and they're just mad at the world when
[1:36:00.880 --> 1:36:06.160]  instead they should embrace the world and and and and be ready for rejection and and not be destroyed
[1:36:06.160 --> 1:36:11.200]  but some of them actually get girlfriends by the end of the movie though some actually and then
[1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:15.440]  they end up killing them though no well i mean some of them some of the insoles get a girlfriend
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:19.200]  they reject her and then they go kill them the guys of my move and the guys of my movies are
[1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:24.000]  sweeties i it's well here's the i'm not trying to demonize incels in general i'm just saying
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:28.240]  there is that percentage of them that do go out and do the shooting yeah there's some weirdos out
[1:36:28.240 --> 1:36:33.840]  there there's a lot of weirdos especially on especially on fourchan and hn i mean they get on
[1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:37.440]  there when they're 12 years old and they they're like you know people are killing themselves on
[1:36:37.440 --> 1:36:42.720]  live streams people are well you're the expert on it so instead of me babbling about incels
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:47.440]  with alex lee moyer tell us in your film what you discovered how they're these big sweeties
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:53.120]  well they're right back there are a lot of reasons to get an alex jones plastic mask at info or
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:58.320]  store.com you can wear them out to political events you can trigger live darts but one of the biggest
[1:36:58.320 --> 1:37:06.400]  reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at halloween but on top of that
[1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:09.520]  they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from
[1:37:09.520 --> 1:37:13.840]  covid 19 or anything else it's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the
[1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:19.680]  force inoculations and contact tracing of their openly announcing it's an active submission it's
[1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:24.400]  an act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down but a big reason to wear these is
[1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:29.680]  then into stores when people ask you why you're wearing a halloween mask say it's just as useless
[1:37:29.680 --> 1:37:36.000]  as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing and the m95 mask only control what's coming in not what's
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:41.200]  going out so they quote spread covid 19 they don't protect from it so again it's a great way to throw
[1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:46.560]  it back in these control freak spaces you buy one for 9.95 you get four more free they're at cost
[1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:55.120]  in four store dot com cnn usa today and other mainstream media fake news outlets came out
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:38:01.920]  and said that a new trump campaign t-shirt that has an american eagle spreading its wings standing
[1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:08.240]  on top of an american flag is nazi and they had the soros fundage snopes groups and others
[1:38:08.240 --> 1:38:13.440]  fact check it to say yes now the american flag and yes the american eagle are nazis no
[1:38:13.440 --> 1:38:18.400]  george soros and funds and snopes and media matters and the rest of them he's the real
[1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:23.360]  nazi collaborator but this shirt i think is really the perfect campaign shirts we made one
[1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:27.680]  even better than what trump's people came up with two different versions of it with something even
[1:38:27.680 --> 1:38:33.840]  worse the betsy ross flag our first flag that they also say is racist even though she was a famous
[1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:40.080]  abolitionist so these shirts are at info wars dot com they're the american eagle betsy ross flags
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:44.720]  two different designs guaranteed to spread the word and of course trigger lip tarts everywhere

[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:14.800]  all right welcome back folks so alex lee moyer tell us about your film when is it coming back out
[1:41:14.800 --> 1:41:21.120]  the film tfw no gf tell me what that stands for who don't understand the communications and
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:27.520]  nomenclature of it for shan okay it's a slang term it's a it's a it's an internet meme slang
[1:41:27.520 --> 1:41:35.120]  term it means that feel when no girlfriend so that feeling when no girlfriend and it's
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:41.360]  typically personified by this cartoon use this this meme character wojak the bald guy the line
[1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:48.400]  drawing and he's basically the represent representation of that feeling so you see him a lot in the
[1:41:48.400 --> 1:41:53.760]  film there's the animation of him and the idea being that he represents the collective experiences
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:58.720]  of all of these people and so you're saying you found it to be nice people i was demonizing
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:03.040]  just in general that one tenth of one percent of the incels that those out of their girlfriend
[1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:07.440]  breaks up with them and shoots them and i'm just pointing out hey it's guys in black prince codes
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:11.520]  you know it's guys that are into the occult guys are trying to be bad boys i mean it's it's this
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:16.720]  group doing it it's not gun owners right well it's there are a lot there are a lot of guys
[1:42:16.720 --> 1:42:22.320]  like that but even more than that i think that there's a lot of those shooters they come from a
[1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:27.520]  culture of sort of that embraces violence and depression and i'm saying if you can catch those
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:32.480]  people on the precipice of their lives between when they're like 18 and 20 before they sort of
[1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:38.080]  self radicalize then you can sort of head a lot of these sort of problems off of the past so you're
[1:42:38.080 --> 1:42:43.120]  saying studying these folks is a way to help them yeah opening like a conversation about like what's
[1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:47.440]  really going on and like what really creates the circumstances for things like that to happen because
[1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:51.680]  it's not just about women it's about them not having any connections with the greater world
[1:42:51.680 --> 1:42:57.120]  outside of the communities that they have online and so they see the outside world is a bad thing
[1:42:57.120 --> 1:43:02.240]  yeah well look at this covid 19 lock us up in our houses hate the outside world don't trust each other
[1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:09.120]  seems like bill gates is kind of an insult probably for sure but yeah i mean now look how much anger
[1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:14.160]  everybody's gotten since they've been locked inside during this time and how tense everybody feels
[1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:19.520]  and how disconnected they feel so it's sort of like an interesting but kind of timely it's a kind
[1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:25.920]  of a strange moment for the movie to reemerge so so what are the five six seven traits of an insult
[1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:38.080]  well okay so from using the word incels sparingly here i would just say you know guys between 17 and
[1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:48.880]  25 usually are somewhere on the scale of poverty or lack of resources they don't have like a stable
[1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:57.440]  family unit they definitely don't have a job and they usually have some sort of um learning disability
[1:43:57.440 --> 1:44:04.240]  or autism possibly autism or some sorts of special needs or they're over medicated that's enough but
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:09.440]  that's a thing with the shooters that is i that i was hearing the other day i think there was
[1:44:09.440 --> 1:44:14.880]  time out on rogan like a lot of the the shooters are on medication so they've almost all are on
[1:44:14.880 --> 1:44:18.880]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the inserts for those say they put you in a psychotic state
[1:44:19.680 --> 1:44:25.520]  can have you sit there and you know engage in mass murder and so i'm not again shoot them up games
[1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:30.480]  but you add that someone on a disassociative drug that puts you on a trance they're already
[1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:35.760]  depressed they're on these drugs that's why they're all shoot them up video games on serotonin reuptake
[1:44:35.760 --> 1:44:45.760]  inhibitors uh and been rejected by society i mean we know who these people are yeah i mean sure and
[1:44:45.760 --> 1:44:53.520]  there's definitely ways uh that you know if we were we're we're treating the the symptom of the
[1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:57.680]  problem but we're not really treating the problem of itself which is that we have we don't have models
[1:44:57.680 --> 1:45:02.880]  for young men we don't have pathways for them to go forward in life in the same way someone
[1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:08.160]  your generation might have had right there's no like infrastructure for young men in middle america
[1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:12.720]  and it sort of leaves them adrift and when they become adrift they sort of the only place that
[1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:16.320]  they find community is with each other and it's the same with people that join gangs or people
[1:45:16.320 --> 1:45:22.400]  that join isis you know you got young men between 1825 and the only way to sort of like cut cut down
[1:45:22.400 --> 1:45:27.520]  that pipeline to uh you have to create a pipeline to normalcy to prevent them from being radicalized
[1:45:27.520 --> 1:45:30.960]  and so that's what i was trying to do with the movie and why would the left at first oppose your
[1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:37.840]  film because they think i'm giving a platform to bad evil young white men and oh i get it because
[1:45:37.840 --> 1:45:41.920]  they're mainly white they're the bad guys and so dehumanize them further which will radicalize them
[1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:47.600]  further yeah i mean and in the movie they're not really saying anything crazy like they're basically
[1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:52.480]  just come off a sort of awkward sort of how did you find the the people that would fit in the
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:58.320]  pattern of it and so i was on twitter and i was already just sort of interested in some sort of
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:03.520]  these like fringe communities from other films that i've worked on and i stumbled into what i
[1:46:04.640 --> 1:46:10.080]  identified i was like why are all these guys so depressed like like you know racism misogyny aside
[1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:15.520]  like these people are like are just they're bombed so i just started talking to people and i made
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:19.840]  friends on there and i had to earn their trust and i just started shooting with them and at the
[1:46:19.840 --> 1:46:23.760]  beginning of the film i would just show up with a camera myself and shoot them and then later on
[1:46:23.760 --> 1:46:28.880]  i got a little traction especially when all those incel crime things started happening people would
[1:46:28.880 --> 1:46:34.400]  would would give me small donations and so i was able to get a camera person and then finally at
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:38.960]  just three years later i got in the south by southwest which was a huge deal seem to be working
[1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:47.360]  on this a long time yeah from 2017 until i guess we we just finished the movie um a couple months
[1:46:47.360 --> 1:46:50.560]  ago how do you ever finish it too because it's like we're trying to make a film about bill gates
[1:46:50.560 --> 1:46:55.200]  there's just always new stuff so there's always a new insult thing too well life keeps going and going
[1:46:55.200 --> 1:47:01.360]  so documentaries you could just go forever but we knew that we wanted to get this out now while
[1:47:01.360 --> 1:47:05.360]  it's still relevant especially because on the internet like a meme or like something on the
[1:47:05.360 --> 1:47:10.080]  internet can become stale almost immediately so like it moves so what's happening is you've got
[1:47:10.080 --> 1:47:15.280]  little boys being raised by computers right and then you enter into that the most popular things
[1:47:15.280 --> 1:47:19.200]  to shoot them up games and that becomes their reality and then they're mad they're being rejected
[1:47:19.200 --> 1:47:23.600]  by the outside world so the thing that they see they're rejected by they go out and they kill
[1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:29.520]  it's very simple psychology yeah yeah but i i i instead there were guys that could have gotten
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:35.120]  to be in the movie that would fit more of that stereotype of like a shooter who or you're looking
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:41.680]  at the general incels not the really dangerous ones yeah because i yeah because it's it's it's
[1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:46.240]  more people than you think it's like your little cousin that just looks at his his ipad no no they're
[1:47:46.240 --> 1:47:50.880]  they're autistically even without being genetically autistic or chemically autistic they've been
[1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:55.840]  programmed to be their world is a computer they're desensitized they're desensitized so they can't
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:48:01.440]  operate in the real world and they had they're lacking the connections of the good family systems
[1:48:01.440 --> 1:48:06.160]  and you know and then bill gates sees the world like that he's mad and he wants to depopulate
[1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:10.640]  as well he's just the ultimate violent incel that wants to give us all cancer virus injections
[1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:15.760]  he's the real incel no that's it bill gates is king of the incels
[1:48:18.560 --> 1:48:22.480]  um and that's why he wants to get back at us he does doesn't he yeah
[1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:30.880]  wow i wonder why he's like that i don't know what what was his family situation again his
[1:48:30.880 --> 1:48:35.120]  dad was like a genesis or something oh yeah top got headed up playing parent of the fellow reserve
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:39.920]  board total new world order some really nice people so you know he wasn't around all that much
[1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:45.520]  he was probably down at the office a lot oh he was plugged into a computer like at age nine he never
[1:48:45.520 --> 1:48:50.320]  stopped right and so he wants to be this cool guy and all these things now because that's not who he is
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:57.120]  well where does melinda play in all this uh i think she's a beard and not for him being gay i mean
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:02.400]  just for the fact that he's a robot and so all the pr is oh he's human oh he's a good guy but
[1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:08.720]  he's actually a very deadly dangerous person from our research bill gates is the prototype
[1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:15.360]  violin in so did you see the new bill gates movie that just came out no well it's funny because there
[1:49:15.360 --> 1:49:21.680]  was this huge production company that laureen pal jobs started she's steve jobs as a widow and they
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:25.760]  originally found out about my movie and they had me in for a meeting and they were gonna produce my
[1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:28.960]  movie it was gonna be a really big deal but then they were like we don't know where you're going
[1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:35.360]  with this but we're gonna pass and i saw that instead not instead but on their roster they
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:40.560]  made this bill gates movie that was on netflix i try i watched like the first like oh it talks about
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:45.280]  him and his mommy and yeah he's a good because he's like a little kid like i'm a good boy i kill
[1:49:45.280 --> 1:49:49.600]  you like he's like a those those things that doctor who that go around going exterminate
[1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:55.200]  exterminate the doleks it's all it's it was an awkward it was awkward i mean i don't want to
[1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:59.520]  talk trash on them but well he does want to be your doctor and put things in your body i mean he
[1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:04.000]  says it's going to hurt 700 000 people but he's going to give you a shot you don't want bill gates
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:10.720]  to be put things in your body see he could be a real real boy if bill gates could just make
[1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:15.920]  something that he puts in our bodies he'll you'll they have a name for that well you know it's called
[1:50:15.920 --> 1:50:20.240]  rape do you want to be raped by bill gates well you know i was watching the other day that john

[1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:50.000]  docile times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:55.280]  we don't appreciate the american way truth justice due process the right to self-defense
[1:51:55.280 --> 1:51:59.600]  private property because we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the world is

[1:52:05.040 --> 1:52:10.160]  up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong
[1:52:10.160 --> 1:52:15.200]  is something the west invented and that's what made our modern world that's now been hijacked by
[1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:19.840]  the technocrats by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be
[1:52:19.840 --> 1:52:26.400]  cold and dumb down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate manipulate and command

[1:54:56.160 --> 1:55:01.440]  folks i checked into donald trump i know people that have stated his house 10 15 times i know
[1:55:01.440 --> 1:55:08.800]  people that know him well donald trump has never said anything racist about black people or jews
[1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:16.480]  and my god is his his son-in-law's an orthodox jew he's pro israel but we have the democrats and

[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:30.560]  yeah and anti-semitic slurs specifically yes donald trump is all about being in control
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:37.120]  trump doesn't say something in his sleep he doesn't want to say this is crap ladies and gentlemen
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:44.160]  but let's hear what joe biden actually has to say on record here it is in a confidential portions
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:48.720]  of your staff memo they brought to your attention the allegation that important legislators and
[1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:53.280]  legislators and defeating the new nez plan in the basement said quote we already have a nigger
[1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:57.760]  mayor we don't need any more nigger big shots if you have a problem figuring out whether you're
[1:56:57.760 --> 1:57:03.440]  for mere trump and you ain't black and the kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub
[1:57:03.440 --> 1:57:10.320]  my leg down so it was straight and then watch the hair come back up again they look at it so i
[1:57:10.320 --> 1:57:15.840]  learned about roaches i learned about kids jumping on my lap and i've loved kids jumping on my lap
[1:57:16.400 --> 1:57:22.560]  we have this notion that somehow if you're poor you cannot do it poor kids are just as bright and
[1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:34.320]  just as talented white kids sorry go ahead no no i probably best i don't why are they putting up
[1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:42.960]  a totally senile person clearly who has dementia because he's a placeholder
[1:57:45.360 --> 1:57:48.720]  for another candidate and we better start having a discussion about the shenanigans
[1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:54.160]  they're going to pull at the dnc and the rnc and the fact that they already did this covid shutdown
[1:57:55.280 --> 1:58:01.280]  and they already did all this other crazy stuff that's happened russia gate ukraine gate man i'm
[1:58:01.280 --> 1:58:06.160]  gonna tell you something right now trump's winning they got their establishment polls that are fake
[1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:12.000]  where he's losing they've got internal polls where he's barely winning i think those are accurate
[1:58:12.880 --> 1:58:18.480]  but you better believe that inaction against these people green lights whatever the new big
[1:58:18.480 --> 1:58:25.280]  craziness is they're gonna pull and so that's where i stand now we've got guys that i've
[1:58:25.280 --> 1:58:30.000]  loved for years but they're one of the hottest things on the internet right now the hodge twins
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:33.680]  are going to join us and they were really polite last time and let me babble and talk i want to
[1:58:33.680 --> 1:58:38.640]  let them really roll with it and get into their view about what's happening and what they think we
[1:58:38.640 --> 1:58:42.560]  should do straight ahead info wars dot com tomorrow's news today stay with us
[1:58:48.240 --> 1:58:53.680]  any reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown the number one reason is it
[1:58:53.680 --> 1:59:01.200]  serves every one of their purposes we've gone over those purposes many times here on air the
[1:59:01.200 --> 1:59:06.160]  casual society the surveillance system global government medical tyranny forced inoculation
[1:59:07.040 --> 1:59:13.440]  but the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete that we are non-essential
[1:59:14.240 --> 1:59:21.760]  as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had
[1:59:21.760 --> 1:59:28.720]  by design this isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into it's been pre-planned
[1:59:28.720 --> 1:59:36.160]  organized globally and it's extremely predatory and through governmental actuaries and tax programs
[1:59:36.160 --> 1:59:42.880]  and regulations the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers
[1:59:42.880 --> 1:59:54.320]  and consolidate power this is the truest form of technocracy fascism big brother mainstream media
[1:59:55.440 --> 2:00:03.760]  government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com
[2:00:03.760 --> 2:00:15.600]  studios it's alex jones well i've been watching the hodge twins for years but let me tell you
[2:00:15.600 --> 2:00:20.400]  they are as hot as joe rogan right now on youtube five million views two million views a million
[2:00:20.400 --> 2:00:24.800]  views everything they do and i just appreciate them having the courage to come on this show that
[2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:30.080]  has really been you know a blocked by the establishment but i just love watching what they
[2:00:30.080 --> 2:00:34.640]  do and i know my kids love watching as well and i was thinking man i want to try to get them back
[2:00:34.640 --> 2:00:38.960]  on but instead of me sitting there asking the questions let them ask the questions and kind of
[2:00:38.960 --> 2:00:43.200]  have the floor here long form so i've seen some of the pieces they've done that have been longer
[2:00:43.200 --> 2:00:47.040]  they make some really great points i've never even really thought of so they're here with us
[2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:53.600]  to cover the waterfront uh today so many different subjects so many different fronts uh but first off
[2:00:53.600 --> 2:00:59.760]  gentlemen people really like you guys people love you talk about you and your family you're awakening
[2:00:59.760 --> 2:01:03.840]  where you come from who you are because that's not something you do a lot on your own show but i
[2:01:03.840 --> 2:01:08.160]  know i'm kind of springing that on you but i mean you know who are you guys people can find out
[2:01:08.160 --> 2:01:13.280]  about what you do at the hodge twins youtube conservative twins instagram official hodge
[2:01:13.280 --> 2:01:17.760]  twins twitter hodge twins but i mean tell folks who you are because you're americans
[2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:24.320]  man and that's the main thing we want to point out to everybody i don't like that term african
[2:01:24.320 --> 2:01:30.400]  american and we're americans what does my uh my ancestor has to do with anything you don't have
[2:01:30.400 --> 2:01:35.120]  white people talking about they ours european americans they just call themselves american the
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:39.920]  reason why we call ourselves african americans is why the left wants you to call you that uh
[2:01:39.920 --> 2:01:44.800]  term yourselves that is so they can divide us yeah they want black people to feel they're
[2:01:44.800 --> 2:01:51.120]  less than american than anybody else yeah that's the biggest uh concern the left has if if everybody
[2:01:51.120 --> 2:01:56.880]  can wake up one morning and just look at themself as just being american then we all can see ourselves
[2:01:56.880 --> 2:02:01.840]  as the same and that's the message we're trying to preach on our facebook our youtube our instagram
[2:02:01.840 --> 2:02:06.400]  is we need to stop focusing so much on our differences and what we look like or what we like
[2:02:06.400 --> 2:02:12.480]  or like or what we like to do we just need to sit down and find some commonality commonality
[2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:18.880]  that we all can agree on it and we pretty much 99 percent of us we like the same thing but the
[2:02:18.880 --> 2:02:23.680]  left and mainstream media like to focus on our differences yeah to divide us well that's what
[2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:31.120]  john wane said word for word and they say he's bad yeah the man says one thing um wrong and
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:36.240]  they want to throw everything out that he's done the council coach is just running everything yeah
[2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:42.240]  and when he said those words those were decades ago yeah i mean it was a different world then yeah
[2:02:42.240 --> 2:02:47.120]  i mean if the left can just take their own logic and look at themself in the mirror have the things
[2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:51.120]  they say should they should throw out hillary clinton said black men were super predators what
[2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:57.920]  happens to her nothing she gets a pass yeah but trump comes out and say a couple real things
[2:02:57.920 --> 2:03:04.240]  and then he did try to mark him as a racist like he was just on a cbs news getting interviewed by
[2:03:04.240 --> 2:03:10.320]  reporter yeah she asked a question that was based on a false assumption why is black people still
[2:03:10.320 --> 2:03:16.880]  being killed in america that's because she doesn't want the truth she has an agenda yeah
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:24.080]  that people all races are done at the hands of police officers and trump made a very statistical
[2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:30.560]  a great fact a statistical fact yeah based on math based on science he said more white people
[2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:36.160]  being shot and killed by cops than blacks yeah but see that's they don't want the public to know
[2:03:36.160 --> 2:03:40.960]  that yeah because if the public knows that they're narrative that they're pushing that black people
[2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:46.560]  have been hunted down in america it falls apart yeah i know you guys want to get into statistics
[2:03:46.560 --> 2:03:50.320]  and we'll do that a lot of professors are being fired that show these statistics but since you're
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:54.880]  bringing up we've got an internet clip of this it's a little bit choppy but here's a clip of
[2:03:54.880 --> 2:03:58.880]  trump laying out facts and the cbs reporter acting like he's got three heads here it is
[2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:05.040]  let's talk about george foyd you said george foyd's death was a terrible thing terrible why are
[2:04:05.040 --> 2:04:10.720]  african-americans still dying at the hands of law enforcement in this country and so are white people
[2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:17.840]  so are white people what a terrible question to ask so are white people more white people by the way
[2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:22.560]  more white people and the media's spun it like he cares about the white people no he's saying
[2:04:22.560 --> 2:04:27.760]  there's some bad cops things go wrong the world's not perfect guys give people the real numbers
[2:04:27.760 --> 2:04:36.080]  yeah like uh the washington post posted this song horrific study it was so flawed even somebody of
[2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:41.920]  my rudimentary experience in statistics noticed that was flawed yeah yeah but that's what the
[2:04:41.920 --> 2:04:46.960]  washington post hopes for yeah literally half the population this country don't know rudimentary
[2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:51.840]  statistics yeah i mean the studies uh they're trying to say black people being killed at a
[2:04:51.840 --> 2:04:57.760]  higher rate than black folks yeah but the study takes in the takes in there they're white folks i mean
[2:04:57.760 --> 2:05:02.960]  i'm missing out that uh survey is saying white uh black people are getting killed at a higher
[2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:08.720]  rate than white yeah that studies uh they take into account the entire population
[2:05:09.920 --> 2:05:15.360]  okay if you want to figure out what's going on if black people are being killed killed at a high
[2:05:15.360 --> 2:05:20.640]  rate you need to take an account only police interactions who cares about the lady that's
[2:05:20.640 --> 2:05:24.640]  sitting in the old folks home or my wife who's never been stopped by the cops yeah you need to
[2:05:24.640 --> 2:05:28.720]  look at police interactions and then you'll be able to determine if black people are being killed
[2:05:28.720 --> 2:05:34.320]  at a high rate but even then whether was the black people walking down the street just flying a kite
[2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:39.600]  sucking on a lollipop or they put that self in a dangerous position put the cops life at risk yeah
[2:05:39.600 --> 2:05:45.840]  even if the if after this study if you just take relevant facts relevant data yeah and throw away
[2:05:45.840 --> 2:05:50.720]  the data that doesn't mean anything if you find black people are being killed at a high rate
[2:05:50.720 --> 2:05:54.960]  then you need to look at the individual cases where black men is lost that lost their lives
[2:05:55.600 --> 2:06:01.520]  and then even at that there's gotta be a reason yeah just to say black people being hunted down
[2:06:01.520 --> 2:06:06.160]  just because the color of the skin no there's more reasons why they're being shot at a high rate
[2:06:06.800 --> 2:06:11.280]  more often in times if you look at the faces of black lives matter or the people they like to hold
[2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:17.120]  up when they say black lives matter majority's cases have the same denominator they're being
[2:06:17.120 --> 2:06:20.880]  they're being violent they're resisting arrest they're attacking police officers they're trying
[2:06:20.880 --> 2:06:26.720]  to grab that gun they took that taser yeah the police have the right to defend themselves they
[2:06:26.720 --> 2:06:31.840]  have lives they have families too but that's why they Alex they say black lives matter because only
[2:06:31.840 --> 2:06:37.360]  black lives matter yeah that's the agenda yeah they don't if you say all lives matter all of a
[2:06:37.360 --> 2:06:42.000]  sudden they're trying to paint you as a racist everybody on the left has lost common sense
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:48.800]  mainstream media they've taken up the most simplest things and they're twisting it and people on the
[2:06:48.800 --> 2:06:54.240]  left do not realize what they're doing because they've been fed these lies over the last 30 years
[2:06:54.240 --> 2:06:57.920]  hey I want to I want to say something else Alex this information that they're giving to black
[2:06:57.920 --> 2:07:04.080]  people they're actually creating racist black people I've never in my life seen so many white
[2:07:04.080 --> 2:07:10.240]  people getting attacked by black people just for the simple fact that they're white I mean I don't
[2:07:10.240 --> 2:07:16.320]  see this happening to black people in this country yeah I've seen a white lady at a protest say all
[2:07:16.320 --> 2:07:22.400]  lives matter and a black person shoots and kills her she had a six-year-old I mean not six-year-old
[2:07:22.400 --> 2:07:28.400]  six-month-old infant and they didn't say that was a hate crime I mean what country are we living in
[2:07:28.400 --> 2:07:34.320]  yeah it's like a double standard um everything that there's been preached on mainstream media
[2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:39.760]  is all these double standards and we're starting to see the effects of these double standards you're
[2:07:39.760 --> 2:07:44.800]  giving certain people these rights but these people in this demographic can't say certain things
[2:07:44.800 --> 2:07:49.360]  based on our history yeah if we're going to ever get rid of racism in this country we're
[2:07:49.360 --> 2:07:55.120]  going to have to deal with all the double standards if if a black man can say black power
[2:07:55.120 --> 2:07:59.840]  why can't a white man say white power that's you never hear a white man saying it because it doesn't
[2:07:59.840 --> 2:08:05.360]  sound right well let's expand on that what do you think the democrats and the deep state are
[2:08:05.360 --> 2:08:11.920]  trying to do because they've got canon and they've got chartleman the god out literally saying white
[2:08:11.920 --> 2:08:16.560]  people are inherently bad and they've got the biggest huge shows and then attacking jews and all
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:21.200]  this stuff and it's the left funding all of this like black lives matter openly once the
[2:08:21.200 --> 2:08:27.840]  and the nuclear family this is villainous stuff who are the who's behind these people man they all
[2:08:27.840 --> 2:08:33.520]  the democrats want they don't have ideas to take this country forward yeah to progress this nation
[2:08:33.520 --> 2:08:39.040]  they just want power so what the way they go about getting a power is putting this in little groups
[2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:44.560]  it's called divine and conquer yeah a lot of black people don't do that research and it's been eased
[2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:52.320]  that's why blacks over the last decades they had a 90 clip they vote democrat soon stay here racist
[2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:57.360]  that's all they need to hear they don't need to think but hollywood hollywood is their biggest
[2:08:57.360 --> 2:09:04.400]  ally yes especially black celebrities they're the democrats ally black people blindly follow these
[2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:10.240]  people all the time just based on what they sold in music yeah what what kind of show they do because
[2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:15.200]  they can rap or they're comedian they actually listen to these people like they're very important
[2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:20.240]  they these people know nothing about politics yeah half the time when I hear these people speak
[2:09:20.240 --> 2:09:24.880]  I think they're actually auditioning for their next movie role yeah no I think you're right
[2:09:24.880 --> 2:09:29.600]  gentlemen let's come back and talk about the insanity of AOC I know you've been on her

[2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:16.320]  code word for Bill Gates this operation he carries out with his good little buddy Dr. Fauci in the
[2:10:16.320 --> 2:10:21.760]  surgeon cult as you know for girls there's five different types of villains they secretly desire
[2:10:21.760 --> 2:10:29.120]  in the romance novels one of them is the vampire the werewolf the billionaire and and who else

[2:12:31.360 --> 2:12:35.040]  haven't gone to the games in many years because it's just such propaganda he makes hundreds of
[2:12:35.040 --> 2:12:41.200]  millions of dollars in america china literally runs death camps for muslims and christians and
[2:12:41.200 --> 2:12:48.480]  modus and he says america sucks and america's bad same thing with cavernic with nike and all of it
[2:12:48.480 --> 2:12:54.000]  and it's just like it's so obnoxious when as you i know you guys have talked about this they said oh
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:59.040]  we're dealing against police brutality it's not just disrespect the flag that was two years ago now
[2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:06.080]  cavernic says the flags evil get rid of it it's bad it's white supremacy why are they doing this
[2:13:06.080 --> 2:13:10.000]  and more importantly why are the big corporations pushing this what do you guys think's really
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:15.760]  behind us well they're they're easy celebrities actors i mean their knowledge about our history
[2:13:15.760 --> 2:13:21.760]  and what's going on in this country is very very low and and and they're being taken advantage of
[2:13:21.760 --> 2:13:27.280]  yeah i mean they take advantage of their fans but uh nike they're in the pocket of our china
[2:13:27.840 --> 2:13:32.960]  yeah how much are they making from having their shoes made in china it's billions yeah it's just
[2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:38.160]  it's just hypocrisy alex so they cover their real their real slave master activity in 2020
[2:13:38.160 --> 2:13:45.440]  using a black man as their cover right exactly i mean look what china's done to the world yeah
[2:13:45.440 --> 2:13:52.480]  that chinese virus you got to call the chinese virus it comes from china right yeah and it's
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:56.640]  look what they've done in the world at first they say no we got this handled it's not that big of a
[2:13:56.640 --> 2:14:03.680]  deal how many people died as a result of this this could have been perhaps um um kept from getting
[2:14:03.680 --> 2:14:10.000]  out of control if they were to let the world know what was going on yeah but they chose to be quiet
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:14.880]  there's really a shame that these celebrities they they're so vocal which you know i mean everybody's
[2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:19.760]  got an opinion but they really should do their research and and sometimes they just need to
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:26.560]  stand that lane yeah if you saw lebron james at say a bar restaurant or walking down the street
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:30.480]  what would you say if you had a minute to talk to him what you say hey i would say hey man be a man
[2:14:30.480 --> 2:14:34.800]  stand up for what's really going on and the same thing with cappernik and all these people you're
[2:14:34.800 --> 2:14:40.640]  being used to cover up real slavery in china it's disgusting what what would you say to him if i saw
[2:14:40.640 --> 2:14:45.280]  lebron in person i would go up to him and say man hey congratulations on a great career but you need
[2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:52.800]  to shut up and dribble well i mean would they really want to have a conversation yeah because
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:58.560]  these people don't want to have a conversation they don't want facts yeah they're just doing what
[2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:03.840]  they need to do to keep that uh that money frame coming yeah to protect their self-interest yeah they
[2:15:03.840 --> 2:15:09.840]  don't care about progress uh the unistake's progressing they don't they just care about
[2:15:09.840 --> 2:15:14.720]  their pockets and they're not dumb people they know what's going on they're great you cannot
[2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:19.360]  be that stupid they know what's going on that's a really good point because i know some of the
[2:15:19.360 --> 2:15:24.480]  people at that level they are just totally cold-blooded i don't care if it's a top actor or top
[2:15:24.480 --> 2:15:28.640]  black white in matter they have just got these managers and they're just cold-blooded and they
[2:15:28.640 --> 2:15:35.760]  stand for nothing yeah absolutely now absolutely well why don't the corporations stand up for
[2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:40.480]  america because i mean i get that okay lebron james and cappernik and puppets uh you know it's
[2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:44.400]  those bill marr for that matter but what about people on top why do they want to get rid of america
[2:15:45.440 --> 2:15:51.360]  greed yes simple greed they read it it's all about their profit margin yeah it's all about money
[2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:56.480]  and a lot of these corporations have been dealt a bad hand from our own government through taxes
[2:15:56.480 --> 2:16:01.520]  and regulations they've been forced to do take that they've been that's very astute they've been
[2:16:01.520 --> 2:16:08.880]  forced under china's control so i think they they've dealt been dealt a bad hand and sometimes that
[2:16:08.880 --> 2:16:14.640]  sometimes this comes back to roost when these things happen yeah we need to deregulate deregulate
[2:16:14.640 --> 2:16:20.160]  businesses bring down taxes these jobs has been in there's been sent to china mexico those jobs
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:25.920]  to be here yeah and the government can do something about it all you have to do is deregulate bring
[2:16:25.920 --> 2:16:32.480]  taxes down americans more americans could have more jobs america could be that's all common sense
[2:16:32.480 --> 2:16:36.800]  when you guys talk to the grassroots are out there you're you're super popular been popular for years
[2:16:36.800 --> 2:16:41.680]  you guys are really popular right now congratulations on your exponential growth thank you are you seeing
[2:16:41.680 --> 2:16:48.880]  an awakening or do you believe these polls that trumps behind no i don't i don't i don't but but we
[2:16:48.880 --> 2:16:53.440]  we should not become complacent we got to keep the uh we got to keep the gas pressed down we got
[2:16:53.440 --> 2:16:58.880]  to keep going yeah because i don't want to see this country go falling to the hands of another
[2:16:58.880 --> 2:17:04.800]  democrat because these people are batshit crazy yeah and i see these things on instagram where
[2:17:04.800 --> 2:17:08.800]  they're censoring so many conservatives and they give a pass to so many people on the left
[2:17:08.800 --> 2:17:15.600]  i came across some some uh instagram posts where it looks like the lgbtq community is actually trying
[2:17:15.600 --> 2:17:22.880]  to make pedophilia pedophilia and actual sexual orientation oh yeah they were mainline feminists
[2:17:22.880 --> 2:17:30.320]  were defending gizlain maxwell like she was an empowered woman that is sick that was my next
[2:17:30.320 --> 2:17:34.160]  question you guys brought it up i'm gonna do that next segment jeffrey ebbstein and but but
[2:17:34.960 --> 2:17:39.520]  you were starting to get into it one of the twins there are you guys just go about twins but we
[2:17:39.520 --> 2:17:43.200]  should have you on they should go by your full name sometimes people know you guys are but what about
[2:17:43.200 --> 2:17:49.920]  this what what do you what do you expect to happen next if the democrats got in
[2:17:51.200 --> 2:17:57.440]  oh man no telling i mean i mean i think if a democrat got in office i mean there's a lot
[2:17:57.440 --> 2:18:02.640]  of conservative voices on social social media i mean we're already being censored but if a democrat
[2:18:02.640 --> 2:18:08.880]  gets in office i could i could see us getting heavily censored maybe even our channel shut down
[2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:14.560]  just for speaking our opinion and speaking a lot of facts i can see that come they're already trying
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:19.680]  to censor the president of the united states on twitter on twitter so what the hell you think
[2:18:19.680 --> 2:18:24.480]  they're gonna do to us yeah don't you or anybody else look what they've done to you already it's like
[2:18:24.480 --> 2:18:30.160]  yeah if that happens thank god help us i think the next several elections is very important we
[2:18:30.160 --> 2:18:35.200]  can't get complacent we gotta urge our family members our friends to get out and vote but make
[2:18:35.200 --> 2:18:40.560]  sure they vote republic yeah well that's the truth what triggered you guys a few years ago to get
[2:18:40.560 --> 2:18:46.560]  online oh well first when we first got online it was just you know i knew people was making money
[2:18:46.560 --> 2:18:51.280]  i was just trying to keep me my car from being repossessed yeah i never thought it was gonna
[2:18:51.280 --> 2:18:55.840]  turn into this if you'd have asked me if i'd have became a republican or conservative i was about to
[2:18:55.840 --> 2:19:00.480]  say i saw you guys years and years ago and you were just having fun yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:05.120]  we wasn't really into politics but you know we're a lot older now and yeah i can't believe
[2:19:05.120 --> 2:19:10.240]  i'm about to be 46 but it's like i used to be naive when i was young i used to think voting
[2:19:10.240 --> 2:19:15.920]  didn't matter yeah i mean that's the dumbest that is just so dumb you letting grown folks
[2:19:15.920 --> 2:19:19.760]  decide how you're gonna live your life so what was the tipping point for you guys to go from
[2:19:19.760 --> 2:19:23.280]  just having fun and being popular to you know taking a real stand and doing a great job
[2:19:23.280 --> 2:19:30.000]  uh obama yeah i actually hated obama so much i voted for mitt romney
[2:19:31.360 --> 2:19:37.600]  yeah let's take on something yeah yeah he took um like i um i was listening to conservatives i was
[2:19:37.600 --> 2:19:42.800]  still liberal i had i got an older older brother that's retired army yeah i came across some bench
[2:19:42.800 --> 2:19:48.640]  apparel videos um some larry elder videos and you know i start to listen to these people but when
[2:19:48.640 --> 2:19:54.480]  obama got in the office and he took my insurance premiums me damn near triple them and on top of
[2:19:54.480 --> 2:19:59.360]  that i lost courage and remember he was saying it was going to be free at first remember yeah yeah
[2:19:59.360 --> 2:20:04.880]  all lies all lies and keep you doctor all lies nobody calls them off of that i remember when
[2:20:04.880 --> 2:20:09.280]  obama care went in i had an infection on my leg and i went to a clinic there were these old ladies
[2:20:09.280 --> 2:20:13.760]  crying they go i heard it was going to go down or be free and they said sorry it's an obama care
[2:20:13.760 --> 2:20:19.600]  charge and i saw old ladies crying because that was all the money they had in the bank yes sad
[2:20:19.600 --> 2:20:25.760]  because i got a letter in the mail two weeks after that went into play and they explained to me that
[2:20:25.760 --> 2:20:33.840]  my rates was going up and they said at the bottom obama care act yeah i was like wow yeah how to
[2:20:33.840 --> 2:20:37.840]  shoot yourself in the foot tell people you're getting something free and you get it that sounds

[2:21:42.720 --> 2:21:48.880]  dot com a lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years and if you go back to those shows
[2:21:48.880 --> 2:21:56.000]  we laid out the ai takeover plan the tracking of cell phones how programmed master computers would
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:22:02.080]  manipulate control society how they'd be able to not just predict large groups of human movements
[2:22:02.080 --> 2:22:06.320]  and activities but even predict what individuals would do and then once you could predict what
[2:22:06.320 --> 2:22:12.960]  individuals were going to be doing you can add stimuli through the ai systems through the computers
[2:22:12.960 --> 2:22:17.200]  through digital billboards through face scanning through the social credit score
[2:22:17.200 --> 2:22:22.480]  to control people and make them act like you wanted to but when we cover that the media would attack
[2:22:22.480 --> 2:22:27.760]  us and say we were making it up it was a conspiracy theory even though it was in the actual corporate
[2:22:27.760 --> 2:22:33.280]  level blueprint documents well the next level of the blueprint documents explain to us that they are
[2:22:33.280 --> 2:22:38.240]  setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out and it's something
[2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:59.760]  about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned so we might want to dismantle the system now
[2:22:59.760 --> 2:23:06.560]  it's the end of the world as we know it and i don't feel fun this entire takeover has been
[2:23:06.560 --> 2:23:12.560]  battle planned blueprinted war-gamed field marshaled by the psychological war chiefs
[2:23:12.560 --> 2:23:18.880]  at the united nations and the fortune 100 this is the post human takeover the new skits tighter
[2:23:18.880 --> 2:23:26.080]  when you comply not looser the entire covid-19 operation as a hoax now they admit the quote
[2:23:26.080 --> 2:23:30.320]  death numbers are dropping because those are fake where they count people that died of something else
[2:23:30.320 --> 2:23:35.360]  but it's all about how many cases there are and now they're saying most of the population will get it
[2:23:35.360 --> 2:23:42.720]  and then no one can go outside ever again it's totally insane it's a fraud it's all alive
[2:23:42.720 --> 2:24:02.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:24:13.200 --> 2:24:29.600]  look our guest just laid it out the hodge twins this is nothing but divide and conquer
[2:24:29.600 --> 2:24:33.680]  and you get the wiki leaks you get all the documents the democrats the deep state admit
[2:24:33.680 --> 2:24:38.080]  they're doing that i mean communist china has millions of christians buddhists and muslims in
[2:24:38.080 --> 2:24:43.120]  death camps on record apple gets their components made in there i was like oh but apple's liberal so
[2:24:43.120 --> 2:24:51.600]  it's okay and then all these politicians hire black activists to be their shield and call america bad
[2:24:51.600 --> 2:24:57.600]  so america's busy defending itself while all these other really evil regimes are getting away with
[2:24:57.600 --> 2:25:03.360]  murder and for me that's just what this comes down to so i'm gonna ask these two very successful
[2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:08.480]  commentators where they think the country is going and what they think all of us can do
[2:25:08.480 --> 2:25:12.720]  with 108 days because i gotta be honest with you i mean i wake up early in the morning
[2:25:12.720 --> 2:25:16.480]  my five six in the morning i'm worried about i'm not doing enough and then i'll be up here
[2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:19.760]  sometimes late at night still working but i'm and i'm thinking what is it i'm supposed to do
[2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:24.720]  because the more they censor me the more i want to get the word out but then i just love seeing
[2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:29.200]  as i get censored you get censored more people are popping up i'm also seeing a lot of people
[2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:34.560]  pop up and speak out as more of us get censored and and so i just i feel like we're winning but
[2:25:34.560 --> 2:25:37.920]  i just feel like we should be doing more what do you think we should all be doing right now
[2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:42.960]  well we could always do more but essentially i want to touch on something you said they're
[2:25:42.960 --> 2:25:47.840]  using blacks as muscle and they're using white people's guilt against them to divide us yeah
[2:25:48.560 --> 2:25:52.320]  going forward we just need to be more vigilant we need to be more proactive well
[2:25:52.880 --> 2:25:57.920]  just content is keep grinding and hustling doing our videos and educating our friends family and
[2:25:57.920 --> 2:26:03.200]  yeah just tell people to share our videos you you got to do the bare minimum you we cannot
[2:26:03.200 --> 2:26:11.440]  become complacent you have to vote yeah that's the bare minimum yeah vote you got to make sure your
[2:26:11.440 --> 2:26:15.600]  message is being heard that means get registered now that means go down and do it that means take
[2:26:15.600 --> 2:26:23.120]  ten people with you do it yeah yeah got my whole family waiting alex yeah i mean i think got biggest
[2:26:23.120 --> 2:26:28.000]  impact as far as when we came out the closet is conservative yeah is uh i mean we've got some
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:32.800]  black people to switch over i'm sure that we've made that impact i think our biggest impact has
[2:26:32.800 --> 2:26:37.840]  been with white liberals yeah i mean when we have our comedy shows they they show up to our shows and
[2:26:37.840 --> 2:26:43.520]  they tell us you know that we've made an impact on them yeah let's talk about your comedy shows
[2:26:43.520 --> 2:26:49.200]  you guys do a lot of stuff talk about that well they all been shut down because of covid but um
[2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:53.600]  hopefully here in the next six months or so we can get back on the road because um we really like
[2:26:53.600 --> 2:26:59.600]  doing our comedy we put our our comedy is a spin on politics so it's a lot of conservative
[2:27:00.160 --> 2:27:05.200]  yeah offensive jokes in there hey but i'll tell you what alex during our comedy show and when we do
[2:27:05.200 --> 2:27:11.200]  a q&a your name comes up i mean we're making a huge difference every day don't i mean i know when
[2:27:11.200 --> 2:27:16.080]  you turn on the tv and you see what's going on that's what they want you to see yeah i mean we
[2:27:16.080 --> 2:27:21.120]  are sleeping giant and and we're going to do very good in selection we just need to get no i agree
[2:27:21.120 --> 2:27:26.080]  with you i mean i shake 20 hands on i walk down the street at the time somebody drives by and goes
[2:27:26.080 --> 2:27:30.240]  fq nazi guess what they're never black they're never hispanic it's always weird whacked out white
[2:27:30.240 --> 2:27:34.960]  people and sometimes i'll chase it down i'll say i'll say listen and they go get away get away
[2:27:34.960 --> 2:27:39.440]  they literally believe it they're crazy and i'm not gonna put down white people but let's be honest
[2:27:39.440 --> 2:27:44.240]  you go to a black lives matter meeting 95 percent are weird crazy white people and i'm not trying
[2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:49.520]  to bash white people but we do have a white people problem yeah yeah yeah you know why you're
[2:27:49.520 --> 2:27:55.040]  hiring purple hair yeah yeah low IQ is a problem for all races yeah but you're right what is it
[2:27:55.040 --> 2:27:59.440]  i don't care if you want green or purple hair but they've all got green purple hair like what does
[2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:06.480]  that mean they just want to be different i guess that just means you got a low IQ i guess if you
[2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:11.440]  got pink hair yeah they're just trying to rebel against the system they think they're doing that
[2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:16.400]  part by rebelling what the uh social construct should be when it comes to your hair color
[2:28:16.400 --> 2:28:21.360]  but it's like all these people if you look if you look at uh constituents on the right and
[2:28:21.360 --> 2:28:26.400]  constituents on the left it's like night and day on the right they use their minds and they can
[2:28:26.400 --> 2:28:31.760]  actually debate their views right on the left they're like no this is a trick you're trying to
[2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:37.920]  trick me yeah you would never see aoc you never see her debate anybody yeah she can't even debate
[2:28:37.920 --> 2:28:43.680]  herself that's right she said that we were making kids drink out of toilets it's a total lie so let's
[2:28:43.680 --> 2:28:49.760]  talk about that you guys are really on aoc's case which you should be uh i mean what do you make of
[2:28:49.760 --> 2:28:56.480]  her being the model of the new democratic party that's pretty scary it's uh it's amazing that you
[2:28:56.480 --> 2:29:01.680]  go to a twitter and see how hot her twitter's doing it's like yeah that's it's that many people in this
[2:29:01.680 --> 2:29:08.000]  country that have just lost just blind followers i mean anybody with common sense and just uh
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:12.960]  rational minds should be able to sit down and go through her tweets and do some research
[2:29:12.960 --> 2:29:19.760]  half the things that come in her mouth is just either false or just plain out lies yeah she
[2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:25.840]  rationalized you can give aoc anything and she can rationalize it and make it bad anything remember
[2:29:25.840 --> 2:29:34.080]  when she said cauliflower is racist because it's white i can't keep up with her alex she just
[2:29:34.080 --> 2:29:39.760]  briefly wanted to find the police i mean she wants to let's talk about that because i mean look the
[2:29:39.760 --> 2:29:43.600]  police nothing's perfect government has problems we're all flawed but that's the lowest level of
[2:29:43.600 --> 2:29:50.640]  government get rid of the police can you imagine what that would look like to her is gonna make
[2:29:50.640 --> 2:29:57.520]  every word the suburbs i mean look we live in a civil society because of law and order the cops
[2:29:57.520 --> 2:30:04.160]  are there to enforce law and order if you take away the cops uh if you take away law and order
[2:30:04.160 --> 2:30:11.440]  you now have a barbaric society yeah and besides alex you take away cops what does a court system
[2:30:11.440 --> 2:30:16.160]  look like without police officers yeah what the hell you need judges know exactly the whole system
[2:30:16.160 --> 2:30:21.440]  breaks down if you do that and they know exactly what they're doing yeah you get rid of the police
[2:30:21.440 --> 2:30:25.840]  you don't need judges you don't need prisons ain't nobody getting arrested yeah you don't need to
[2:30:25.840 --> 2:30:30.080]  have a driver's license you don't need registration you don't need a dmv you don't need well this is
[2:30:30.080 --> 2:30:34.880]  the left counter to trump trying to get non-violence out of prison they go oh we'll we'll do one better
[2:30:34.880 --> 2:30:40.400]  we'll just get rid of it entirely yeah and it's crazy they just want to give it to education
[2:30:40.400 --> 2:30:45.360]  which i mean we should give more money to our education but we need to use common sense
[2:30:45.360 --> 2:30:51.520]  there's funds we need funds for everything in our society you just can't do away with the cops
[2:30:51.520 --> 2:30:56.880]  because of two or three bad apples yeah i mean there's bad teachers out there you're going to
[2:30:56.880 --> 2:31:02.720]  defund high schools and colleges yeah i mean doctors are killing people every day oh we're
[2:31:02.720 --> 2:31:07.840]  gonna start uh banning hospitals that's the best point i've seen number one cause of death and
[2:31:07.840 --> 2:31:12.720]  cancer heart attacks it's medical mistakes because it's hard to do if people have problems and it's
[2:31:12.720 --> 2:31:19.280]  not perfect and yeah do we blame all doctors when a doctor cuts the wrong leg off yeah it's
[2:31:19.280 --> 2:31:25.200]  just insane it's just it's just cancel culture it's just it's just horrible and i haven't heard
[2:31:25.200 --> 2:31:30.640]  about it make that point maybe i've been hiding out under a rock but exactly if we blame one cop
[2:31:30.640 --> 2:31:35.280]  and then blame all the cops then what about doctors and nurses they make mistakes way more than cops
[2:31:35.280 --> 2:31:43.120]  no yeah they're killing people far more than that covid is that's right chinese that's right
[2:31:44.080 --> 2:31:47.920]  well keep laying it on me then what do you think trump should do right now i had a
[2:31:47.920 --> 2:31:52.160]  caller yesterday that was genius he said we should make the credit scores all go back to
[2:31:52.160 --> 2:31:56.960]  say january of this year before the covetous area that's what's really hurt people's their credit
[2:31:56.960 --> 2:32:01.360]  scores going down trump could say everybody's credit scores go back to what they were in january
[2:32:01.360 --> 2:32:08.720]  that'd be a big move for everybody oh they'll still find a way to say this is racist i mean
[2:32:08.720 --> 2:32:14.640]  have i i have never heard uh somebody on the left say something good about trump he can do no right
[2:32:14.640 --> 2:32:20.240]  it's it's nothing this man can do yeah for these irrational people on the left i mean that's why
[2:32:20.240 --> 2:32:26.960]  we need to galvanize everybody on the right the independence yeah because the left is insane
[2:32:26.960 --> 2:32:31.760]  yeah everything this man has done since he's been in office which i want to keep in mind they impeach
[2:32:31.760 --> 2:32:38.160]  him for practically breathing i mean aoc says the most craziest things i mean if you can impeach
[2:32:38.160 --> 2:32:43.360]  impeach trump for for breathing we should be able to impeach aoc for being stupid
[2:32:44.720 --> 2:32:53.120]  what about elon o march he's even worse oh man and and come to think of alex we rescue this lady
[2:32:53.120 --> 2:32:58.880]  from our country she could be dead right now well we allow her to come this country as an immigrant
[2:32:58.880 --> 2:33:03.200]  she's a city she got saved two years before by the military when one tribe was about to kill her
[2:33:03.200 --> 2:33:08.160]  and then she says our military are massacres and bad when they literally saved her she hates them
[2:33:09.440 --> 2:33:15.200]  she hates america she has an agenda she knows this country is not as bad as just they hate what
[2:33:15.200 --> 2:33:20.880]  this country represent western civilization they want to rip it all down and make this country
[2:33:20.880 --> 2:33:26.320]  what they think well that's it they want authority over it and so that's what soros pays them to do

[2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:42.000]  ladies and gentlemen in fact we had a similar design back with the made in 1776.com that's
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:46.400]  what it's all about is rediscovering who we are because the globalists hate america because it
[2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:51.680]  threatens them america didn't start out perfect we're not perfect now but the idea was beautiful
[2:38:51.680 --> 2:38:56.400]  and the world fell in love with it and that's what it's about so they're attacking it uh
[2:38:56.400 --> 2:39:01.200]  gentlemen i just want to salute your success and the great work you're doing and the fact that you
[2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:05.360]  went from being successful comedians to seeing the threat to freedom and started speaking out and
[2:39:05.360 --> 2:39:08.800]  and i noticed as they attacked you more and more you've got more hardcore so it's just awesome
[2:39:09.440 --> 2:39:13.760]  a few minutes each of you just about where you see this going what you think trump should do
[2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:19.440]  other points you'd like to make i think trump should just keep his foot down on the gas keep
[2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:25.200]  doing what he's doing don't let the um mob change uh wait the the views they want this country the
[2:39:25.200 --> 2:39:31.040]  direction they want this country to go because trump is redefined what it is what a president should
[2:39:31.040 --> 2:39:36.480]  do right like obama he just said whatever made people feel good now trump's not going to do it
[2:39:36.480 --> 2:39:42.480]  he's going to tell you what you need to hear he's leading right he's he's being a leader being a leader
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:47.040]  is telling people what they need to hear not making them feel good about a situation you need to hear
[2:39:47.040 --> 2:39:52.880]  the truth yeah and that's what i'm sure what they need to hear not what they want to hear um i think
[2:39:52.880 --> 2:39:58.080]  as far as trump i think he's doing a great job under the circumstances i mean house representatives
[2:39:58.080 --> 2:40:03.600]  and all these uh batshit crazy liberals i mean they're making his job tough but yeah so far man
[2:40:03.600 --> 2:40:09.440]  he's did an excellent job i really like to see our local governments and uh cities start to enforce
[2:40:09.440 --> 2:40:14.800]  um to stop these rides because they keep saying that these people are peaceful protests i think
[2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:19.280]  we should get the national guard because this stuff has to stop seeing people getting attacked
[2:40:19.280 --> 2:40:24.000]  but just simply being white or being a trump supporter i mean these people are not just randomly
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:29.280]  they block people on roads and start shooting people and then they do it the name of black lives
[2:40:29.280 --> 2:40:32.960]  they're mainly white i'm not saying that because you guys are you know whatever i mean it's real
[2:40:32.960 --> 2:40:37.680]  it's white people in the name of black people shooting people in the head at a checkpoint
[2:40:38.640 --> 2:40:43.680]  yeah white guilt imagine if the cops set up a checkpoint and randomly shot somebody in the head
[2:40:43.680 --> 2:40:49.120]  it'd be the whole town would burn but when but when white people the name of BLM do it oh it's good
[2:40:49.920 --> 2:40:53.920]  and if you've seen the mug shots of these white people whenever they get arrested shooting somebody
[2:40:53.920 --> 2:40:58.160]  they just look all happy like they just did a great thing what the hell is wrong with these people
[2:40:59.200 --> 2:41:04.160]  these people are mentally sick these a lot of them uh uh you can tell when you look at somebody's
[2:41:04.800 --> 2:41:09.760]  they're not all there they're uh experiencing some type of mental breakdown or they're just
[2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:17.600]  not mentally well they'll say the democrats are like very good at focusing on the the demographic
[2:41:17.600 --> 2:41:23.760]  in this country that's doesn't have a lot going from yeah the vulnerable yeah the vulnerable there
[2:41:23.760 --> 2:41:28.800]  they may not be the brightest they may not be as successful as most americans and they're young
[2:41:28.800 --> 2:41:33.680]  and they take advantage of that and they exploit it exactly and so it's up to us to reach out and
[2:41:33.680 --> 2:41:37.440]  give leadership just like gangs get young kids because the dad isn't at home we need to reach
[2:41:37.440 --> 2:41:41.200]  out these young people said oh the gangs don't get them same thing let's go back this is two nights
[2:41:41.200 --> 2:41:47.760]  ago federal courthouse they're trying with a hatchet and a hammer to break in and then the feds

[2:42:06.480 --> 2:42:12.400]  yeah and they show a lot of restraint those people deserve the bullet in between their head
[2:42:13.680 --> 2:42:19.040]  to be back back it up did you see him swing the hatchet or whatever it is at the at the at the
[2:42:19.040 --> 2:42:25.920]  fed's head a hammer uh an axe that is a dangerous weapon and they didn't even shoot them they use
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:31.280]  pepper spray and they still say that's police brutality when they're trying to break into a
[2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:37.360]  building all over the media it's oh secret police arrest people peaceful protesters trying to break

[2:42:51.200 --> 2:42:55.680]  how about holding yourself accountable if you if we hold ourselves individually accountable
[2:42:55.680 --> 2:43:01.360]  you wouldn't even need cops right you wouldn't even need them but how crazy are they to try to break
[2:43:01.360 --> 2:43:06.320]  in a federal building and then try to hit a guy in camo and riot gear in the head with a with a
[2:43:06.320 --> 2:43:12.400]  club you know why alex because only black lives matter yeah that's why that's what they're pushing

[2:46:48.400 --> 2:46:52.720]  and everything i just feel like i should probably move in full force to shut it down in a few years
[2:46:52.720 --> 2:46:57.360]  and i should just work with somebody else and just let people have their own operation everything
[2:46:57.360 --> 2:47:02.320]  so that i could just go forward and he said well let's get that started well a couple months ago

[2:48:39.760 --> 2:48:44.880]  to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny we don't appreciate the american
[2:48:44.880 --> 2:48:50.160]  way truth justice due process the right to self defense private property because we've had it so
[2:48:50.160 --> 2:48:54.720]  long and we just think that's how the rest of the world is ladies and gentlemen the renaissance the
[2:48:54.720 --> 2:49:00.720]  social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and
[2:49:00.720 --> 2:49:06.000]  to try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the west invented and that's what
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:11.280]  made our modern world that's now been hijacked by the technocrats by the globalist who say humans
[2:49:11.280 --> 2:49:16.960]  are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups
[2:49:16.960 --> 2:49:22.320]  that the elites dominate manipulate and command even lucky enough to stay alive and that's what
[2:49:22.320 --> 2:49:29.520]  covet 19 is a global un revolution against free humanity against your family against prosperity
[2:49:29.520 --> 2:49:34.240]  and against your future if you don't stand up and fight you deserve what you get i know what we'll
[2:49:34.240 --> 2:49:39.520]  do to make them conform to our cult we'll all tell them to wear masks so they're gonna die and then
[2:49:39.520 --> 2:49:43.760]  we'll release the pressure for a while then bring it back and squeeze it harder and release it again
[2:49:43.760 --> 2:49:49.040]  and we'll be the virtuous and we'll be the angels even though our lord and master bill gates helped
[2:49:49.040 --> 2:49:58.080]  fund the whole covet 19 oh no don't seduce me that's right that's the code word for bill gates
[2:49:58.080 --> 2:50:05.760]  this operation he carries out with his good little buddy dr fouchy in the surgeon cult
[2:50:05.760 --> 2:50:10.560]  as you know for girls there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance
[2:50:10.560 --> 2:50:17.760]  novels one of them is the vampire the werewolf the billionaire and and who else oh that's right
[2:50:17.760 --> 2:50:22.240]  there's the surgeon and then there's one other one and it's so much fun to be ruled over by
[2:50:22.240 --> 2:50:28.400]  these psychotic psychopaths it's so good to know that there are masters and are coming to rape us
[2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:51.040]  with their inoculations psychopaths are so hot oh yeah you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:51.040 --> 2:51:01.120]  all right my son rex jones is coming up he shot a black lives matter antivirally at ut a few days
[2:51:01.120 --> 2:51:07.600]  ago there's a bunch of video on his site a sub site at vanda video that's coming up and he's
[2:51:07.600 --> 2:51:11.840]  gonna be in studio with me and then i've got a medical doctor who's a state senator they're
[2:51:11.840 --> 2:51:15.920]  trying to shut down we're gonna be having that here on the transmission as well exposing the
[2:51:15.920 --> 2:51:22.800]  covered 19 hoax but let me let me just spend a little bit of time on this my dad is a retired
[2:51:22.800 --> 2:51:26.880]  dentist and he's a chemist and a lot of other stuff and he helped us produce the high quality
[2:51:26.880 --> 2:51:31.520]  whitening toothpaste the super blue toothpaste and all the rest of it but he said about a year ago
[2:51:31.520 --> 2:51:36.480]  you know how can i help with the info war and i said well listen you've got all your knowledge
[2:51:36.480 --> 2:51:40.480]  why don't you launch a whole new supplement line with the highest quality stuff i don't care if it
[2:51:40.480 --> 2:51:44.560]  competes with what we're selling you should create your own line your own site that's separate from
[2:51:44.560 --> 2:51:49.280]  info wars because they're trying to set us all down here well you can go and set up your own thing
[2:51:49.280 --> 2:51:55.120]  and you know have that there to help the operation continue into the future and so that's what's
[2:51:55.120 --> 2:52:00.480]  happened now we're not going to launch the toothpaste the activated charcoal toothpaste
[2:52:00.480 --> 2:52:07.760]  and mouthwash till next week but everything else is launched now it's it's it's in our warehouse
[2:52:07.760 --> 2:52:13.760]  ready to ship out to you now i am not putting down any of the previous products we've had they're
[2:52:13.760 --> 2:52:21.440]  excellent knockout like six years ago i go wait a minute el tryptophan valerian root melatonin a
[2:52:21.440 --> 2:52:27.520]  bunch of other ingredients nine total are known to give you deep clean better sleep so i put out
[2:52:27.520 --> 2:52:32.800]  knockout and knockouts great people love it just my idea i talked to experts i said can you mix all
[2:52:32.800 --> 2:52:38.880]  this table they said yeah so we did it instead of paying 19 bucks 20 bucks for you know melatonin
[2:52:38.880 --> 2:52:43.440]  you pay the same price and get eight other things on top of it because they totally gouged you i mean
[2:52:43.440 --> 2:52:50.160]  look most places are not putting five ten dollars a product in a bottle but i said to my dad's
[2:52:50.160 --> 2:52:55.280]  developer who's one of the top guys in the country i said how about something even stronger if that's
[2:52:55.280 --> 2:53:03.200]  what people want so it's not competing with knockout it's it's it's a different formulation
[2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:07.520]  but quite frankly it is stronger and after you've been taking knockout for a while it might not work
[2:53:07.520 --> 2:53:11.200]  as well that's this how this stuff work you'll say what's your sales pitch just the truth
[2:53:11.200 --> 2:53:20.640]  worth rocket rest you rock it off the sleep and you blast off in the morning and my son rex is
[2:53:20.640 --> 2:53:27.440]  coming in here this wasn't planned actually he's once gone he doesn't really have trouble sleeping
[2:53:27.440 --> 2:53:33.040]  but he kind of wakes up a few hours after he goes to bed he always has i'd be like down the kitchen
[2:53:33.040 --> 2:53:37.280]  at midnight getting a glass of oranges if you wander around his underwear at least to live with me
[2:53:37.280 --> 2:53:44.080]  you know he's he's moved out now he's a big boy and he would take knockout sometimes
[2:53:44.800 --> 2:53:49.920]  and it affects everybody differently he said yeah knockouts great well he said rocket rest
[2:53:49.920 --> 2:53:58.000]  his words were two days ago is too strong and i said take it again and tell me he slept 12 hours
[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:05.120]  on this and he said the name is perfect he said i was just had so much energy when i woke up so
[2:54:05.120 --> 2:54:15.760]  rocket rest is available right now ladies and gentlemen at infowarstore.com or drjonesnaturals.com
[2:54:17.200 --> 2:54:21.840]  and it's an amazing product we're really really proud of it it's got a lot of product in it
[2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:28.080]  and it is extremely strong and it works extremely well and it's not meant to be competition against
[2:54:28.080 --> 2:54:36.640]  knockout knockouts got all these great compounds together in medium and low dosages this has got
[2:54:36.640 --> 2:54:41.360]  less ingredients but at high dosages and believe me it works like
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:49.600]  fourth of July i mean it is super powerful we're very very proud of it and i have any
[2:54:49.600 --> 2:54:58.960]  of that time to tell you about soreless primal youth cabochill regular strength top brain
[2:54:59.760 --> 2:55:07.200]  and cabochill extra strength formula because seriously the average person might not be able
[2:55:07.200 --> 2:55:11.600]  to take the extra strength cabochill but if we weigh 200 plus pounds like i do you want to take
[2:55:11.600 --> 2:55:16.080]  the extra strength and what what these things do is just phenomenal we're so excited about these
[2:55:16.080 --> 2:55:24.240]  products and i'm so glad my father uh developed these i i charged him a year ago to build me an
[2:55:24.240 --> 2:55:30.400]  army worthy of mordor and he did so these are amazing products so good job dr jones

[2:56:49.440 --> 2:56:58.240]  hi senator scott jensen i represent carver county this is one of the most important videos i've
[2:56:58.240 --> 2:57:03.200]  made and one of the hardest frankly it's been a very difficult decision to make whether i even
[2:57:03.200 --> 2:57:09.200]  wanted to do it less than a week ago i was notified by the board of medical practice in minnesota
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:17.760]  that i was being investigated because of public statements i had made they listed two allegations
[2:57:17.760 --> 2:57:23.760]  they said i've been spreading misinformation in regards to the completion of death certificates
[2:57:24.640 --> 2:57:30.240]  on a news program which happened to take place on april 7th and you could find that one it was
[2:57:30.240 --> 2:57:35.200]  with chris burg if you wanted to and the other allegation was that i provided reckless advice
[2:57:35.840 --> 2:57:43.040]  in my willingness to compare covid-19 and the flu when i got this letter i was ticked and quite
[2:57:43.040 --> 2:57:51.040]  frankly i leaned into the comfort and wisdom of my family to help them let them walk me talk me
[2:57:51.040 --> 2:57:58.000]  off the cliff but i got it if this could happen to me my view is it could happen to ever anybody
[2:57:59.200 --> 2:58:06.320]  i mean i've been a family doctor for 40 years i work hard i love my patients i do house calls
[2:58:06.320 --> 2:58:11.520]  i've been medical directors i've held staff positions in hospitals to help make things work
[2:58:11.520 --> 2:58:18.240]  better i've been in the senate for four years and i've learned a lot
[2:58:20.640 --> 2:58:24.640]  i've never had anything like this happen shoot a mile five years ago i was named
[2:58:24.640 --> 2:58:31.760]  the minnesota family doctor of the year in minnesota and i get this because a couple people
[2:58:31.760 --> 2:58:39.040]  complained and i don't get to know who those people are i don't know if they're routinely
[2:58:39.040 --> 2:58:44.800]  in a political camp if they're activists i've gone online and looked at what it takes to
[2:58:44.800 --> 2:58:50.800]  complete a complaint that the board of medical practice has to follow up on it's a one-page deal
[2:58:51.520 --> 2:58:57.920]  you can say what you want you could be a huge donor for the other party and i wouldn't get to
[2:58:57.920 --> 2:59:02.080]  know what i wouldn't get to know if you live in my district i don't i don't get to know anything
[2:59:02.080 --> 2:59:09.840]  i checked so here i am i've spent the better part of the last six days
[2:59:09.840 --> 2:59:14.720]  preparing a response i understand how important the work is the board of medical practice does
[2:59:14.720 --> 2:59:22.880]  i mean physicians do screw up two of the big areas where physicians mess up is inappropriate
[2:59:22.880 --> 2:59:29.840]  sexual behavior inappropriate self-medicating certainly with opiates but this is an odd position
[2:59:29.840 --> 2:59:37.200]  for me to be in and i am just stunned but i should have seen it coming because i saw the
[2:59:37.200 --> 2:59:40.560]  threats on social media i've seen him for the last two or three months i've seen him come from
[2:59:40.560 --> 2:59:47.280]  physicians i've seen him come from people in all walk of life they didn't agree with me they didn't
[2:59:47.280 --> 2:59:55.680]  like it that i was trying to provide some context for the flu for covid-19 we've had some 35 40
[2:59:55.680 --> 3:00:01.520]  thousand cases of covid-19 in minnesota thus far according to the department of health people
[3:00:01.520 --> 3:00:07.120]  that might translate into 10 times that many and if it does translate it 10 times i mean that's 350
[3:00:07.120 --> 3:00:12.400]  thousand cases but in 2018 we had more than a half a million minnesotans with the flu
[3:00:13.920 --> 3:00:20.160]  when i say that am i recklessly giving you advice regarding covid-19 and the flu
[3:00:20.160 --> 3:00:26.400]  doctor anthony fouchi has come out and compared him all the time dr. mike osterholm has
[3:00:27.840 --> 3:00:35.120]  in terms of the death certificates on april third i got an email from the department of health
[3:00:36.080 --> 3:00:42.640]  that said very clearly that we should report covid-19 on death certificates
[3:00:42.640 --> 3:00:52.720]  if it is assumed to have caused or contributed well that's not how we do death certificates
[3:00:53.280 --> 3:00:59.760]  the official icd 10 coding for april first 2020 through september 30th 2020 during the time
[3:00:59.760 --> 3:01:05.920]  frame in question says this if the provider documents coming up in the last segment of this hour
[3:01:05.920 --> 3:01:13.680]  or we're gonna air this this full statement by him but he is a esteemed medical doctor in minnesota
[3:01:13.680 --> 3:01:18.400]  just like all the other esteemed doctors that have come out across the country and nurses
[3:01:21.360 --> 3:01:26.320]  and pointed out their order to put people that die car wrecks on the death certificate of people
[3:01:26.320 --> 3:01:31.360]  that die cancer or die something else and they've opened up a disciplinary investigation of him to
[3:01:31.360 --> 3:01:38.080]  fire him or remove his medical license and it's the same thing across the country this is the rain
[3:01:38.080 --> 3:01:46.480]  of terror that we put up with these people and you've had all these prestigious medical doctors
[3:01:46.480 --> 3:01:51.120]  come out and say we're counting people that died motorcycle accidents car wrecks cancer
[3:01:51.680 --> 3:01:58.800]  diabetes heart failure and they test him and they have covid but again that's the big secret
[3:01:58.800 --> 3:02:04.960]  it anyone who's ever had a corona virus of the flu virus they're very similar shows it within
[3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:10.400]  about 10 years on average so if you have the antibodies or you have the detritus from it
[3:02:10.400 --> 3:02:14.800]  they do it i know the listeners know that you've heard me say that 5 000 times but this is the
[3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:21.520]  greatest hoax ever and it's all banking on oh it's the medical system don't question it
[3:02:23.440 --> 3:02:27.200]  how many medical doctors have been banned off youtube or facebook or twitter because they
[3:02:27.200 --> 3:02:33.520]  came out and said the same thing with dr jensen who is a state senator said he will defeat this
[3:02:33.520 --> 3:02:42.960]  medical board review but because he came out he said this is overblown they're counting people
[3:02:42.960 --> 3:02:50.160]  that died of something else um you notice as the number of people infected goes up the death rate
[3:02:50.160 --> 3:02:54.560]  goes down because it's a fraud folks it was designed to bring the country down
[3:02:54.560 --> 3:03:02.160]  Michigan physician lawmaker under investigation by board of medical practices for his commenting
[3:03:02.160 --> 3:03:09.120]  regarding covid 19 they put me under criminal investigation you saw it on the news for saying
[3:03:09.120 --> 3:03:20.560]  it was a hoax it's a rain of terror to sit down so fouchy and gates and the rest of them can say
[3:03:20.560 --> 3:03:26.080]  and do whatever they want because the real kill system is in that vaccine and you know loose
[3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:30.960]  fair con i know loose fair con i've had dinner with loose fair con i'll leave it at that loose
[3:03:30.960 --> 3:03:37.680]  fair con says he's a big fan of the show all i know is loose fair cons right about don't take
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:41.920]  these vaccines they have a history of secret experimentation but he tells black people don't
[3:03:41.920 --> 3:03:46.560]  take it because the white man wants to get you let me give you the rest of story whether you're
[3:03:46.560 --> 3:03:54.560]  black or white or older young the globalists want everybody you think the new world order just
[3:03:54.560 --> 3:04:04.320]  wants to get black people yeah yeah right think again they want everybody and eugenics you hear
[3:04:04.320 --> 3:04:09.840]  is to empower the race but if you're globalist that want to post human race they want anybody they
[3:04:09.840 --> 3:04:17.680]  see as strong so while they've got black people and europeans fighting with each other
[3:04:19.600 --> 3:04:25.200]  i can tell you that europeans and black people africans are the number one group being targeted
[3:04:25.200 --> 3:04:29.680]  by this the whole globalist systems to get us to fight with each other i'm giving the deep
[3:04:29.680 --> 3:04:35.440]  knowledge right now and and to act like all this crap because we're strong and nothing against other
[3:04:35.440 --> 3:04:42.160]  groups of people the point is there is a plan in this satanic actuary that's being run that wants
[3:04:42.160 --> 3:04:47.520]  to play us off against each other while poisoning and killing us at the same time aren't we smart
[3:04:47.520 --> 3:04:53.600]  enough to figure this out and say no to it i mean you want to kill me because i'm white go ahead
[3:04:53.600 --> 3:04:59.680]  or kill smuggles or black whatever it's all stupid but let's pull back and realize there's a scientific
[3:04:59.680 --> 3:05:09.200]  studied plan and it wants to kill the west and it wants to kill africa and i don't even know all
[3:05:09.200 --> 3:05:15.120]  the answers how those things come together or what those pieces are but i know when i talk about that
[3:05:15.120 --> 3:05:22.160]  my spirit knows that i'm on target rex jones my son is here this was a plan today he did a big 20
[3:05:22.160 --> 3:05:26.720]  minute report that's out at bandai video he's got a few clips of it coming up the craziness he saw
[3:05:26.720 --> 3:05:32.960]  will have two segments when we come back but this is really a big time right now folks and
[3:05:33.520 --> 3:05:39.760]  if you're a black person you know in the middle of alabama in 1965 and a racist group of kkk drunk
[3:05:39.760 --> 3:05:43.840]  guys pulled up around you in your car and i hope you got a gun to protect yourself but that was
[3:05:43.840 --> 3:05:49.760]  back then but the truth is events like that are very rare for black people now they're very common
[3:05:49.760 --> 3:05:54.560]  for white people now and black folks ought to be asked themselves a big question and so share
[3:05:54.560 --> 3:06:01.280]  everybody else why is the establishment funding attacks on white people you think it's just because
[3:06:01.280 --> 3:06:07.920]  they don't like white people know it is to create a response of racism in a larger plan against black
[3:06:07.920 --> 3:06:16.560]  people you're being set up and so do i have all the answers well i got a lot of them and i haven't
[3:06:16.560 --> 3:06:21.840]  figured out every angle of this yet but i know a setup when i see it and i know the bad guys want
[3:06:21.840 --> 3:06:26.720]  us fighting each other and killing each other and we should say no to them and then while they do all
[3:06:26.720 --> 3:06:31.600]  this they say capitulate to us to prove you're not bad to stop the problem and that's what this
[3:06:31.600 --> 3:06:37.200]  terrorism is create the crisis tell us to all bow down to them like they're the guys they're
[3:06:37.200 --> 3:06:40.800]  going to fix it when they're the people that started it stay with us there are a lot of reasons
[3:06:40.800 --> 3:06:46.880]  to get an alex jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com you can wear them out to political events you
[3:06:46.880 --> 3:06:52.960]  can trigger live darts but one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any
[3:06:52.960 --> 3:06:58.960]  costume party or at halloween but on top of that they admit that wearing these masks there's
[3:06:58.960 --> 3:07:03.600]  absolutely nothing to protect you from covid 19 or anything else it's total virtue signaling to
[3:07:03.600 --> 3:07:07.920]  show that you're prepared for the force inoculations and contact tracing of their openly
[3:07:07.920 --> 3:07:12.560]  announcing it's an active submission it's an active like putting a burqa on your head and
[3:07:12.560 --> 3:07:17.440]  bowing down but a big reason to wear these is then into stores when people ask you why you're
[3:07:17.440 --> 3:07:23.360]  wearing a halloween mask say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth masks that you're wearing
[3:07:23.360 --> 3:07:28.160]  and the m95 mask only control what's coming in not what's going out so they quote spread
[3:07:28.160 --> 3:07:32.800]  covid 19 they don't protect from it so again it's a great way to throw it back in these control
[3:07:32.800 --> 3:07:39.280]  freaks faces you buy one for 995 you get four more free they're at cost infowarstore.com

[3:08:58.080 --> 3:09:02.000]  well you know a lot of the crews have been here for a long time rex they remember when you were
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:09.120]  like three feet tall turn this mic on and now here you are with us and you've been going out
[3:09:09.120 --> 3:09:14.080]  doing reporting for info wars but you've started your own doctor silence site tell us about that
[3:09:14.080 --> 3:09:18.400]  i have i've started doctor silence uh my goal with this new project is i really want to show
[3:09:18.400 --> 3:09:22.880]  you an unbiased form of what the left is really standing for i'm not here to ask leading questions
[3:09:22.880 --> 3:09:26.720]  i'm here to let them talk and expose themselves because that's when i feel you get the best
[3:09:26.720 --> 3:09:33.120]  content and man i went out to the student led blm protests last weekend and holy tolito these
[3:09:33.120 --> 3:09:39.280]  people are nuts we even captured footage of a kind of like a troll creature there is there
[3:09:39.280 --> 3:09:42.080]  footage of the goblin where about there's footage of the goblin you're going to see in the last
[3:09:42.080 --> 3:09:46.800]  few seconds of the report so so you have this idea for doctor silence i guess to cover censorship
[3:09:46.800 --> 3:09:53.040]  right yeah exactly so uh the whole the whole theme of doctor silence is um conservative voices have
[3:09:53.040 --> 3:09:57.200]  been silenced moderate voices have been silenced it's only the radical left that's allowed to talk
[3:09:57.200 --> 3:10:01.920]  so i'm gonna play by their rules i'm gonna let the radical left talk i'm gonna put a microphone
[3:10:01.920 --> 3:10:06.000]  in their face and ask them what they stand for and when you ask them what they stand for they
[3:10:06.000 --> 3:10:09.920]  tell you that they're not ashamed of it they're not ashamed of it i mean in the in the protest
[3:10:09.920 --> 3:10:15.040]  they're shouting we are socialists we are socialists we want we want we want universal health care
[3:10:15.040 --> 3:10:19.200]  we want to end the police we want the abolition of police we want the abolition of prisons these
[3:10:19.200 --> 3:10:22.880]  people are crazy and they just don't know it and they're willing to share it with you which is what
[3:10:22.880 --> 3:10:28.160]  makes it so great doctor silence youtube and twitter go follow it uh it's very important that you do
[3:10:28.160 --> 3:10:31.840]  we're gonna be putting out a lot of weekly content every week and i'm really going to show you who
[3:10:31.840 --> 3:10:37.200]  these people are well you did a good job i mean there's like a 20 minute video right yeah there's
[3:10:37.200 --> 3:10:42.080]  20 minute there's a 20 minute video uh and then there's a four a four minute and 30 second highlight
[3:10:42.080 --> 3:10:47.600]  reel that we're gonna play today and uh it's go watch a 20 minute video it's fantastic it's great
[3:10:47.600 --> 3:10:51.840]  but you have to understand you're not cherry picking this i mean these are not at all not at all not
[3:10:51.840 --> 3:10:58.000]  at all every second you spend with these people is gold every second you spend with them and well
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:11:02.400]  i appreciate but i i get we laugh at them but like yeah i know for any way to free these people
[3:11:02.400 --> 3:11:06.640]  you know it's really sad when you look at young people and especially what i'm covering on doctor
[3:11:06.640 --> 3:11:11.760]  silence a lot is a social media how it kind of trains young people to act in a certain way it
[3:11:11.760 --> 3:11:17.680]  leftism really has become a religion and it's a program it's a program yeah on every everyone's
[3:11:17.680 --> 3:11:22.160]  and everyone's instagram story it's all this leftist ideology and they all show how they're
[3:11:22.160 --> 3:11:28.720]  conforming 100 percent so it's not a religion it's a cult it's a cult well we've got more
[3:11:28.720 --> 3:11:33.200]  after this but let's go ahead and play this little piece you put together of uh what you
[3:11:33.200 --> 3:11:39.440]  got shot just a few days ago at ut here it is defund the police so recognize that as much as you
[3:11:39.440 --> 3:11:52.160]  have privilege make sure that you use it to the benefit of black people as much as possible
[3:11:52.160 --> 3:11:57.040]  recognize that black people do not have a privilege like many of you do today we cannot
[3:11:57.040 --> 3:12:03.200]  do anything literally without people calling us names squares or anything at all so recognize
[3:12:03.200 --> 3:12:08.480]  that as much as you have privilege make sure that you use it to the benefit of black people as much
[3:12:08.480 --> 3:12:13.920]  as possible help us in every situation that you can because black people for far too long black
[3:12:13.920 --> 3:12:18.560]  and brown people have not been heard and clearly our voices are not hearing the racist cops who
[3:12:18.560 --> 3:12:29.200]  think that they still can kill black children uh what's your opinion on property rights stuff
[3:12:29.200 --> 3:12:35.920]  like that i think property is a form of death in all honesty um the idea of private property
[3:12:35.920 --> 3:12:42.560]  rights is obviously a western colonial um invention so there's historical basis to prove that societies
[3:12:42.560 --> 3:12:47.360]  don't need to be structured around private property rights i view property as something that should
[3:12:47.360 --> 3:12:52.640]  be collectively owned by the people not necessarily something that should be owned by a state i think
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:12:58.320]  state-owning property is um a very dangerous practice and any form of property should be held
[3:12:58.320 --> 3:13:04.240]  by social institutions controlled by people and workers especially so in my mind a world void
[3:13:04.240 --> 3:13:10.880]  of private property rights it would essentially be a sort of planned economy except there would be a
[3:13:10.880 --> 3:13:16.080]  variety of institutions controlled by the different people who compose the economy so for instance one
[3:13:16.080 --> 3:13:22.560]  of the things we could expect to see are worker councils councils where people produce commodities
[3:13:22.560 --> 3:13:26.960]  workers produce these commodities and they democratically come to conclusions as to what
[3:13:26.960 --> 3:13:31.520]  they're going to produce and how their workplaces are going to produce that thing i think we could
[3:13:31.520 --> 3:13:37.280]  also expect to see councils of consumers who make the demands for the workers to fulfill
[3:13:38.080 --> 3:13:43.680]  and i think primarily we just see an economic system based on cooperation versus an economic
[3:13:43.680 --> 3:13:50.160]  system based on coercion these councils but we gotta let her talk we gotta let her talk
[3:13:51.840 --> 3:13:57.040]  that's because that's those of us standing here now over 50 percent of the city's budget
[3:13:57.040 --> 3:14:04.640]  goes to funding the police and that is a crime against humanity when we have homelessness
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:13.040]  where people don't have health care when we don't have a living wage in this city
[3:14:13.040 --> 3:14:18.000]  supposedly the most destructive city in the in the state of texas
[3:14:19.840 --> 3:14:21.680]  they do this whole mass things they don't wear a mask
[3:14:21.680 --> 3:14:23.200]  we don't have college roll in
[3:14:23.200 --> 3:14:27.360]  what do you do professor and we surely don't have black matter
[3:14:27.360 --> 3:14:28.800]  it's simply the worst voice i've ever heard
[3:14:28.800 --> 3:14:32.400]  she doesn't need a leader just two seats say with me all two seats
[3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:34.640]  look at black lives matter it's really black isn't it
[3:14:34.640 --> 3:14:39.200]  two seats from taking them for black lives majority in austin city council
[3:14:39.200 --> 3:14:42.720]  yeah i'm not giving black folks a pass but i'm sorry black lives matter is as white as my ass
[3:14:43.280 --> 3:14:48.320]  that means if you all take two seats y'all can have the city
[3:14:48.320 --> 3:14:53.760]  i consider myself a communist because i fundamentally want the abolition of capitalism
[3:14:54.640 --> 3:14:55.680]  she's got polar areas
[3:14:55.680 --> 3:14:59.440]  as more of a you know an adjective than maybe like a specific
[3:14:59.440 --> 3:15:02.960]  we haven't gotten to political construction or economic construction
[3:15:03.840 --> 3:15:07.600]  what what what do y'all really stand for i can't you personally stand for
[3:15:07.600 --> 3:15:13.760]  yeah i personally stand for the abolition of prisons the abolition of the police because
[3:15:13.760 --> 3:15:18.000]  i fundamentally believe in individual freedom about anything else
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:21.840]  or any you know leftist ideologies i definitely consider myself a leftist
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:28.160]  but i hold individual freedom to a higher standard i am first a libertarian than a communist
[3:15:28.160 --> 3:15:34.000]  first day
[3:15:40.480 --> 3:15:41.600]  about to go to the battle slug
[3:15:43.120 --> 3:15:44.000]  i like the purple hair
[3:15:45.680 --> 3:15:47.600]  i don't even care about the purple hair but it's like why
[3:15:48.960 --> 3:15:50.000]  look at this guy
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:16:03.840]  all right now let's listen listen i swear to god i am not exaggerating i'm not lying if you if
[3:16:03.840 --> 3:16:07.680]  you're an info wars fan you know who rob do is rob do is about six three this guy's probably an
[3:16:07.680 --> 3:16:12.640]  inch shorter than rob do probably weighed about 450 not exaggerating the camera does not do him
[3:16:12.640 --> 3:16:17.200]  justice i got a bunch of other angles of them i'm gonna put out a montage soon this guy is the battle
[3:16:17.200 --> 3:16:23.680]  slug he had an antifa tattoo on his forearm purple teal hair i mean you couldn't create a
[3:16:23.680 --> 3:16:28.720]  more stereotypical character complete insanity and these these people when you look at them
[3:16:28.720 --> 3:16:33.120]  they're a rabble it's a group of outcasts it's a group of people that don't have friends so they've
[3:16:33.120 --> 3:16:38.400]  chosen this weird leftist movement as they're kind of like club they don't play sports they don't even

[3:17:47.360 --> 3:17:52.400]  that we do to protect ourselves going back thousands of years when we would post a dog or a
[3:17:52.400 --> 3:17:56.720]  century at the entrance of the village so we would know if predators or criminals were coming well

[3:19:42.800 --> 3:19:49.920]  reason is it serves every one of their purposes we've gone over those purposes many times here on
[3:19:49.920 --> 3:19:55.920]  air the casual society the surveillance system global government medical tyranny forced inoculation
[3:19:56.800 --> 3:20:03.200]  but the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete that we are non-essential
[3:20:04.000 --> 3:20:11.520]  as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had
[3:20:11.520 --> 3:20:18.480]  by design this isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into it's been pre-planned
[3:20:18.480 --> 3:20:25.920]  organized globally and it's extremely predatory and through governmental actuaries and tax programs
[3:20:25.920 --> 3:20:32.640]  and regulations the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers
[3:20:32.640 --> 3:20:42.960]  and consolidate power this is the truest form of technocracy fascism you're listening to the alex
[3:20:42.960 --> 3:21:03.120]  jones show well the story just broke at info wars dot com boy is it sexy 2015 video shows
[3:21:03.120 --> 3:21:08.960]  trump denouncing epstein pedo island is an absolute cesspool you know the media tried to
[3:21:08.960 --> 3:21:13.520]  connect him to epstein even though epstein tried to be a member of his club he kicked him out i made
[3:21:13.520 --> 3:21:20.560]  a lot of checks before i backed trump i know what trump likes i know people that let's just say
[3:21:21.840 --> 3:21:29.360]  took care of trump's women and trump has the same taste i have in women 500 600 horsepower
[3:21:30.080 --> 3:21:36.320]  he's not intimidated by third red women it's these pedos that want 12-year-old girls that's
[3:21:36.320 --> 3:21:41.920]  not trump trump doesn't want 12-year-old girls folks he wants well look at his wife malania
[3:21:41.920 --> 3:21:47.600]  that's what trump wants trump wants what we would call premium beef stop stop being like that rags
[3:21:47.600 --> 3:21:53.360]  the point is he likes full grown women he's not intimidated the pedos are intimidated by women
[3:21:53.360 --> 3:21:56.400]  don't make women a commodity here let's go ahead and play the club
[3:21:56.400 --> 3:22:08.880]  i don't know but that island was really a cesspool there's no question about it just ask
[3:22:08.880 --> 3:22:15.520]  prince andrew he'll tell you about it the island was an absolute cesspool so he's been there for
[3:22:15.520 --> 3:22:20.240]  many times well i can't say friends but i know you're friendly you know them they play at my clubs
[3:22:20.240 --> 3:22:24.160]  a lot i have clubs and everybody likes to play are you saying there's a political problem for her
[3:22:24.160 --> 3:22:28.800]  if she runs for president it could be a political problem look he could be a political problem
[3:22:28.800 --> 3:22:33.200]  right now he's teflon and right now maybe not but he could end up being a political one
[3:22:34.320 --> 3:22:40.160]  so there you go there's trump torpedoing the entire situation let's just give this clip next
[3:22:40.160 --> 3:22:48.320]  other info wars dot com article south dakota governor gnome says no new outbreak ever she
[3:22:48.320 --> 3:22:55.200]  gave people their freedom folks it's all a hoax yes it's man made so that bill gates owns it but
[3:22:55.200 --> 3:22:59.920]  it's just like the flu or anything else and it's all coming down to oh it's all these record cases
[3:22:59.920 --> 3:23:07.840]  but not deaths because we exposed democrats killing people with the intubation here's what she had to
[3:23:07.840 --> 3:23:16.480]  say south dakota never closed yesterday they reported 42 cases and four deaths and about 87
[3:23:16.480 --> 3:23:22.960]  percent of their total cases have recovered the governor tweeting that quote the call to apply a
[3:23:22.960 --> 3:23:29.040]  one-size-fits-all approach is not leadership here to explain is the leader of south dakota
[3:23:29.040 --> 3:23:33.920]  governor christy gnome good morning new governor good morning steve good to be with you it's good
[3:23:33.920 --> 3:23:40.080]  to have you as well uh south dakota never did close and and you were emphatic about that there's
[3:23:40.080 --> 3:23:47.760]  not been a mask mandate i know you took a lot of criticism because of the mount rushmore event uh
[3:23:47.760 --> 3:23:53.440]  were there any breakouts after that no actually we're doing really good we would start to see
[3:23:53.440 --> 3:23:58.800]  that a few days ago and we continue to decline i think what we did here in south dakota is really
[3:23:58.800 --> 3:24:04.000]  remarkable because we gave people their freedom we let the businesses stay open we let people go
[3:24:04.000 --> 3:24:09.600]  to work we told them to be smart and we also asked them to be personally responsible and
[3:24:09.600 --> 3:24:14.000]  we're seeing the benefits of that each and every day in south dakota sure and i know that uh you
[3:24:14.000 --> 3:24:20.240]  were with us a couple of months ago talking about how um what you were doing was you were protecting
[3:24:20.240 --> 3:24:25.920]  the vulnerable people you know over 65 uh and anybody with a comorbid condition but at the
[3:24:25.920 --> 3:24:30.560]  same time there were spots in your state there were trouble uh some of the packing plants me packing
[3:24:30.560 --> 3:24:34.960]  plants were a problem and so you addressed it that way rather than shut everything down hit pause
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:41.520]  they had the dirtbag lawyers say we better test the whole plant and they test five thousand two
[3:24:41.520 --> 3:24:46.800]  thousand three thousand and then two hundred three hundred four hundred would test none of them were
[3:24:46.800 --> 3:24:55.840]  sick it's a fraud COVID-19 a papaya and a goat have tested positive for COVID-19 exactly COVID-19
[3:24:55.840 --> 3:25:02.560]  is that we open up the encyclopedia botanica the future hoax is COVID-19 coronavirus uh
[3:25:02.560 --> 3:25:07.040]  corona uh COVID-19 whatever you want to call it this is going to be the death knell for the
[3:25:07.040 --> 3:25:10.640]  american economy if we don't wake up to it right now i totally agree let's go back to the governor
[3:25:10.640 --> 3:25:19.200]  of south dakota there it is we're like a laser focusing on those we did in fact we uh according
[3:25:19.200 --> 3:25:24.640]  to the national experts did everything wrong we we did what the people on the ground saw
[3:25:24.640 --> 3:25:30.160]  we aggressively addressed those situations and came out better for it so i really think the
[3:25:30.160 --> 3:25:35.760]  people of south dakota stepped out they did the right thing and uh they trusted me i trusted them
[3:25:35.760 --> 3:25:42.080]  and they made the right decision uh in addition to running the state of south dakota we've got
[3:25:42.080 --> 3:25:48.800]  some images of you over the weekend you were at a professional bull riding event it was the first
[3:25:48.800 --> 3:25:54.160]  major indoor sporting event with fans since march how important was it oh that was that horse you
[3:25:54.160 --> 3:26:00.560]  would ride in bringing the flag when are we moving to south dakota well that was a new life right there
[3:26:00.560 --> 3:26:05.920]  this was the first major i'm officially courting the south dakota governor i know they prayed before
[3:26:05.920 --> 3:26:10.880]  the event forcing my wife and saying the national anthem i was just proud to be there this this was
[3:26:10.880 --> 3:26:17.200]  a perfect example of what makes this country great without your name is mrs jones no to do what they
[3:26:17.200 --> 3:26:21.840]  were good at and it reminded all of us about how special this country is and how important our
[3:26:21.840 --> 3:26:27.120]  liberties are to me now indeed and as we look at the covid numbers they are staggering uh but
[3:26:27.680 --> 3:26:33.680]  if you had advice they are staggering they're gonna infect everybody every american's gonna
[3:26:33.680 --> 3:26:39.600]  have it because it's a fake test the the last statistic oh three million have it oh the last
[3:26:39.600 --> 3:26:44.480]  statistic i read about texas and i could be wrong there was something like 838 deaths per 10 million
[3:26:44.480 --> 3:26:49.200]  people that's the last statistic i read no no it's it's like this this kills less people in the
[3:26:49.200 --> 3:26:54.400]  windows completely ridiculous so so that rex that's where we are though so i'm just i'm calling it all
[3:26:54.400 --> 3:27:00.240]  out man we need leaders not just what she did they need to call it all out the thing is about the
[3:27:00.240 --> 3:27:04.400]  nanny state and the thing about the democrats it's really this sick perverted twisted moon
[3:27:04.400 --> 3:27:08.320]  child was by proxy thing of oh the government's going to be your parents we're going to take
[3:27:08.320 --> 3:27:14.000]  care of your mommy and you never know we really saw that at the blm protest they were manic about
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:18.240]  making everyone make wear masks like i remember i took mine off briefly just so i could breathe
[3:27:18.240 --> 3:27:25.760]  because it was like 104 it's all sign of her submission oh you can't you can't do that and
[3:27:25.760 --> 3:27:29.840]  they had hand washing stations everyone had to wash their hands every 20 minutes and i mean
[3:27:29.840 --> 3:27:35.920]  we're out in the blazing texas sun this is a cult of demons it is it's the cult of leftism it's the
[3:27:35.920 --> 3:27:40.960]  cult of identity politics it's all it is and they were they were like they were sticking tape to the
[3:27:40.960 --> 3:27:45.520]  ground so they made sure people stood stood at a proper social distance which everyone ignored
[3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:49.440]  and then when i probably saw like three or four other people take off their mask briefly just
[3:27:49.440 --> 3:27:52.400]  so they could breathe because again it's like a hundred and four hundred and five degrees out
[3:27:52.400 --> 3:27:58.480]  texas blazing sun open air by the capital clear blue skies and every time one of those people
[3:27:58.480 --> 3:28:02.880]  would take their masks off for just five seconds you said clear blue white people have blue eyes
[3:28:02.880 --> 3:28:09.280]  that's kind of racist am i about to get canceled rec seriously you need to apologize say that you're
[3:28:09.280 --> 3:28:15.200]  bad because you're white i'm gonna be uh donating all my uh all my all the money i ever make in my
[3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:18.960]  life to black lives matter not to make up for what i just said i'm directly to soros directly
[3:28:18.960 --> 3:28:24.160]  to soros because soros isn't black but he he wants to help black people by destroying their community
[3:28:24.160 --> 3:28:29.440]  i've learned that now i've learned how the world works and i've really been doing investigating
[3:28:29.440 --> 3:28:34.400]  i've been going on uh i've been going on instagram and snapchat and watching uh and watching a seph

[3:34:25.920 --> 3:34:29.200]  obviously the political issues but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the
[3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:34.000]  design of it and we believe it is the best strongest but healthiest energy out there and

[3:35:06.960 --> 3:35:13.440]  jones is here and i'm going to play this report of this senator in minnesota exposing the tyrants
[3:35:13.440 --> 3:35:19.200]  and being censored but just in closing here rex what does it like to watch all this unfold
[3:35:19.200 --> 3:35:24.160]  you know being so young i'm 17 years old it's really depressing for me to see this stuff happen
[3:35:24.160 --> 3:35:28.640]  because i know that people that are middle-aged even some millennials they won't have to deal with
[3:35:28.640 --> 3:35:34.000]  this stuff for 50 60 years i will i'm going to have to deal with the repercussions of these
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:39.440]  craze left us for the rest of my lives and i hope to god i pray to god that we can turn this around
[3:35:39.440 --> 3:35:44.400]  but really when i see like hitler was right about one thing you control the youth you control the
[3:35:44.400 --> 3:35:48.560]  future and that's what they're doing it's George it's the nazi blueprint that's what George Soros
[3:35:48.560 --> 3:35:53.200]  is doing is a nazi collaborator control the youth and you control the future when they manipulate
[3:35:53.200 --> 3:35:57.680]  young people and they get them at this age and they get them in literal these uniforms black
[3:35:57.680 --> 3:36:01.840]  lives matter shirts and when they when they make it a cult when they make it something
[3:36:01.840 --> 3:36:05.760]  man they make it something like a religion where it's something they they can identify with because
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:10.560]  christ christianity has been stripped away from our society they can impregnate their minds with
[3:36:10.560 --> 3:36:15.040]  this socialist garbage and really make them believe in it well that's true we have no ideology now
[3:36:15.040 --> 3:36:21.360]  we don't we don't oh america sucks god sucks all of it so now what do i have oh george soros
[3:36:21.360 --> 3:36:28.480]  and black lives matter america was built on christian western ideals and these people openly
[3:36:28.480 --> 3:36:33.360]  admit that they want to strip those christian western ideals away what do you have to replace
[3:36:33.360 --> 3:36:38.160]  our ideals with and then they think we're gonna get scared of being demonized so we we stand out
[3:36:38.160 --> 3:36:43.520]  our system isn't perfect but america the idea of america and what americans have done over the
[3:36:43.520 --> 3:36:47.520]  200-something years that this has been this has been a country i agree right i want you to host
[3:36:47.520 --> 3:36:53.040]  the end of the show yourself thank you appreciate it do it take it over getting back to what i was
[3:36:53.040 --> 3:37:00.000]  saying he's waddling off now america was built on western ideas of freedom and life and liberty
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:04.080]  and property rights the idea that if you worked hard enough you could build something and you
[3:37:04.080 --> 3:37:08.880]  could keep a society functioning what these people want to do is strip that all away they want the
[3:37:08.880 --> 3:37:13.360]  end of the nuclear family they want the end of liberty and they want to usher in the new era
[3:37:13.360 --> 3:37:18.800]  of the nanny state bill gates george soros that's what all these people want they want to be your
[3:37:18.800 --> 3:37:22.400]  they want to be your father they want to be your mother they want to take care of you
[3:37:22.400 --> 3:37:27.680]  they want to remove the role the family has in your life and it's just depressing to see because
[3:37:27.680 --> 3:37:34.080]  i try to talk to people my age i try to tell them these things and it's so hard when every single
[3:37:34.080 --> 3:37:41.040]  thing they're being fed on social media is this leftist garbage black lives matter is very very
[3:37:41.040 --> 3:37:45.840]  very good at public relations because they get billions and billions of dollars from these
[3:37:45.840 --> 3:37:50.720]  from these billionaires like george soros to just openly that openly want to destroy america if you
[3:37:50.720 --> 3:37:56.640]  go to black lives matter's website it says we want we are train marxists they admit it it's not like
[3:37:56.640 --> 3:38:01.120]  they're hiding themselves it's not like they're it's not like they are it's not like they're trying
[3:38:01.120 --> 3:38:06.800]  to conceal what they're doing they're open about it and that is why i've started doctor silence is
[3:38:06.800 --> 3:38:11.920]  because just letting these people talk is the most effective method and i love my dad i love
[3:38:11.920 --> 3:38:16.800]  oh insurer they're great they're awesome but they're kind of in your face uh computational
[3:38:16.800 --> 3:38:22.320]  journalism can only get you so far if you don't let these people explain for themselves why they
[3:38:22.320 --> 3:38:27.360]  are so crazy and what they believe in you're not going to get anywhere the only hope we have as a
[3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:32.080]  society the only hope we have as americans as as conservatives or libertarians or whatever you
[3:38:32.080 --> 3:38:35.440]  want to call yourself if you if you believe in life liberty and property if you believe in the
[3:38:35.440 --> 3:38:40.880]  constitution the bill rights the only hope we have as americans is to let these people really
[3:38:40.880 --> 3:38:47.040]  explain what their plan is because then we can know how to stop it when you look at all these
[3:38:47.040 --> 3:38:52.400]  cases whether it's coronavirus blm when you when you look when you look at this kind of
[3:38:53.520 --> 3:38:58.640]  when you look at this kind of division these lines that are being drawn 2021 in late 2020 no
[3:38:58.640 --> 3:39:03.600]  matter who wins whether it's biden or trump it's going to be very very very ugly and it's going to
[3:39:03.600 --> 3:39:09.040]  be brutal we need to prepare ourselves for the inevitable reality that things are going to get
[3:39:09.040 --> 3:39:15.040]  ugly and that only through god and only through our cultural western ideas of freedom can we succeed
[3:39:15.040 --> 3:39:20.720]  only by educating other people to the reality of what's going on and not yelling at them shouting
[3:39:20.720 --> 3:39:25.680]  them down that's the only way we can truly make an impact this is the only way we can truly truly
[3:39:25.680 --> 3:39:32.400]  stand up to these people and i mean it's not hard to see it's not hard when you look if you look at
[3:39:32.400 --> 3:39:36.240]  the people that are trying to tear down society these are evil human beings can we go back to that
[3:39:36.240 --> 3:39:42.560]  picture of uh steven cobert i just want you to look at the smile it's truly disgusting look at that
[3:39:42.560 --> 3:39:47.280]  smile look at pedestrian next to him these aren't good people these aren't nice people these are
[3:39:47.280 --> 3:39:53.680]  literal demons i mean everyone laughed at my dad when he talked about the civil war guess what's
[3:39:53.680 --> 3:39:59.520]  happening now right after july fourth monuments being torn down cities are burning riots looting
[3:39:59.520 --> 3:40:07.040]  you name it and no one cares no one cares at all because they told you what they were going to do
[3:40:07.040 --> 3:40:11.680]  and they did it and i guess we're just supposed to lay down and accept it that's the world we live
[3:40:11.680 --> 3:40:16.000]  in now it's acceptance it's not tolerance you're not being tolerant of them you're accepting them
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:21.200]  you're accepting whatever they want to do to you if they want to like this case if they want to give
[3:40:21.200 --> 3:40:27.680]  a child with oppositional defiant disorder estrogen a male a teenage kid if they want to
[3:40:27.680 --> 3:40:34.720]  give him estrogen that's okay that's totally cool but if you are able but if you voice conservative
[3:40:34.720 --> 3:40:40.240]  ideology on snapchat or twitter or youtube or instagram you're banned you're done that's it
[3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:47.040]  that's it that's it it's all over they can literally poison our children they can poison our children
[3:40:47.040 --> 3:40:52.960]  they can poison our youth they can feed them propaganda that's totally okay but you are not
[3:40:52.960 --> 3:40:58.320]  allowed to stand up for your second or first amendment right what's up with that i mean look
[3:40:58.320 --> 3:41:02.880]  at this look at this child this is possibly the saddest thing i've ever seen and it's not sad because
[3:41:02.880 --> 3:41:06.880]  it's the first time i've seen something like this i have seen hundreds or even thousands of pictures
[3:41:06.880 --> 3:41:16.160]  like this it's disgusting that child right there is being manipulated and is being abused by his
[3:41:16.160 --> 3:41:20.080]  or her parent i don't want to assume gender because then i'll all get canceled i'll get banned
[3:41:20.080 --> 3:41:24.800]  you have to watch everything do you say do you know how exhausting it is for me as a teenager
[3:41:24.800 --> 3:41:28.960]  to have to police everything i say just to make sure that someone doesn't get offended
[3:41:30.880 --> 3:41:35.680]  this is the new reality this is the new america you aren't allowed to speak unless you're saying
[3:41:35.680 --> 3:41:39.840]  what they want you to you aren't allowed to act unless you're looting or rioting or burning cities
[3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:43.280]  you aren't allowed to peacefully protest for what you believe in you aren't allowed to hold up a
[3:41:43.280 --> 3:41:47.520]  police lies matter sign you aren't allowed to hold up an all lies matter sign you'll get attacked
[3:41:47.520 --> 3:41:54.320]  but if you hold up a blm sign oh you're literally jesus but of course jesus jesus is bad and religion
[3:41:54.320 --> 3:41:58.800]  is bad and the only religion that's okay is the religion of abortion and millions of black babies
[3:41:58.800 --> 3:42:02.880]  murdered and planned parenthood that's the only thing that's okay that's the only thing that's
[3:42:02.880 --> 3:42:07.920]  allowed that's the only thing that's acceptable because it's liberal and it's leftist and it's
[3:42:07.920 --> 3:42:13.680]  right it doesn't matter that carl marx himself was a racist carl marx is a good guy because communism
[3:42:13.680 --> 3:42:19.200]  is wonderful communism has resulted in hundreds of millions of people that are dead and they want
[3:42:19.200 --> 3:42:25.520]  to try the same system again and again and again america isn't perfect no country is perfect but
[3:42:25.520 --> 3:42:30.640]  it's the damn best thing we've got what we had in america and i say had because we're losing it
[3:42:30.640 --> 3:42:37.280]  we're losing it real fast what we had for a brief period of time was true freedom and liberty
[3:42:37.280 --> 3:42:42.000]  the opportunity to become something and to make something of yourself and we're slowly and slowly
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:47.600]  losing that please please don't wear the mask please please stand up for yourself don't let these
[3:42:47.600 --> 3:42:53.440]  people run over you don't do it don't do it don't sell your soul so you can have so you can have a
[3:42:53.440 --> 3:42:58.400]  bunch of fake friends don't sell your soul so you can be popular don't sell your soul don't sell
[3:42:58.400 --> 3:43:07.280]  your future out i'm 17 years old i'll be alive in 2050 i'll be alive in 2060 i'm gonna be seeing this
[3:43:07.280 --> 3:43:12.320]  like the real repercussions of these actions either we can have a total turnaround or we can
[3:43:12.320 --> 3:43:18.480]  have nothing at all we can have ashes we can have the communist chinese takeover we can have death
[3:43:18.480 --> 3:43:24.880]  we can have despair we can have poverty america can become a third world country very fast i mean
[3:43:24.880 --> 3:43:30.880]  look at uh maxine waters and nancy plosie's home home districts they're they're they're the crap holes
[3:43:31.760 --> 3:43:35.760]  i mean we've seen what they're what we've seen what happens when democrats are allowed to push
[3:43:35.760 --> 3:43:42.320]  their agenda we we see what happens look at chicago gun control in chicago gun control sure
[3:43:42.320 --> 3:43:48.080]  didn't work and when you ignore the real problems when you just focus on the invisible boogie man of
[3:43:48.080 --> 3:43:54.000]  racism which really doesn't exist anymore in america i i firmly believe that i talked to young
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:43:59.120]  people man people my age aren't racist people in their 20s and 30s and 40s and 50s aren't racist
[3:43:59.120 --> 3:44:03.360]  nearly all the people i've ever met in my life that i've been friends with have been good honest
[3:44:03.360 --> 3:44:07.680]  people who love america and who love everyone regardless of what their race is or the skin
[3:44:07.680 --> 3:44:12.720]  color or sexual orientation but if you say hey maybe we shouldn't chop a six year old's dick off
[3:44:12.720 --> 3:44:18.000]  maybe we shouldn't give a teen boy estrogen shots then you're banned and you're canceled and you're
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:23.760]  evil it's a sad reality but it's the reality we face and if you don't wake up and do something
[3:44:23.760 --> 3:44:29.360]  about it it's on your head you are to blame anyone listening to this broadcast whoever i don't know
[3:44:29.360 --> 3:44:36.240]  i don't care how young or old you are we have a very small window of time a very a very minuscule
[3:44:36.240 --> 3:44:42.720]  window of time where we can save this country and it's going away real quick if you roll over and
[3:44:42.720 --> 3:44:49.760]  let it happen it's on your head and you are to blame it is your fault you can save america right
[3:44:49.760 --> 3:44:54.320]  now you can save it by being a good god-fearing decent american and spreading the truth to other
[3:44:54.320 --> 3:45:01.120]  people you can do it yourself but it's up to you and man i'm just trying to help i just want to be
[3:45:01.120 --> 3:45:06.160]  able to be in my 40s and 50s and see a country i'm proud of that's all i've ever wanted i just want
[3:45:06.160 --> 3:45:26.000]  to be free i know you do too thank you very much that's all i had to say hope you enjoyed it
