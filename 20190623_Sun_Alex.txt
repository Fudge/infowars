[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:31.000 --> 00:40.000]  You better set me free.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  I'm a live wire, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44.000 --> 00:53.000]  You know, there's a place where having a live transmission wire is transmitting data is illegal.
[00:53.000 --> 01:06.000]  In fact, there's more than just one, and I'm working on a map from publicly available files on where these escape corridors are from the 5G kill grid.
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  Now, you might want to understand something.
[01:08.000 --> 01:09.000]  This is not my opinion.
[01:09.000 --> 01:28.000]  This is fact, and the ultra rich have been building airfields and armored redoubts or fortresses in Kauai, Hawaii, Tasmania, Australia and West Virginia, not to mention areas of northern Canada.
[01:28.000 --> 01:48.000]  And the funniest thing happened last week. I was already planning on either doing a short film or a long film on this and predicting the exodus you're going to see out of the cancer zones from 5G and the rest of it and how the establishment is going to respond to that.
[01:48.000 --> 02:08.000]  And then Friday I came in and there was a huge article that had been out since Thursday in the New York Times admitting all of this, but from the oblique, from an angle, the land where the internet is.
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.000]  Well, you know what this broadcast is all about.
[02:11.000 --> 02:23.000]  You know, I've been thinking, we told you about the world government and the collapse of the EU and the plan to attack the family and to attack the genders and that's in movies I made 20 years ago and in game 11 years ago.
[02:23.000 --> 02:29.000]  And now the world government's out in the open and the surveillance grid is out in the open. Everything we told you, it's like, okay, I already know that.
[02:29.000 --> 02:39.000]  Well, I was thinking how about I start telling folks, like I did 20 years ago or 10 years ago, what's coming next?
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  How about I start telling you all of that?
[02:44.000 --> 02:52.000]  Because by the way, it's not my opinion that cell towers give you cancer. That's all admitted. I'll show you all the main line government documents.
[02:52.000 --> 03:01.000]  But I want to explain something here. It's a lot worse than that.
[03:01.000 --> 03:10.000]  And so I thought, though, instead of just talking about what they're going to do to us, the way the globalists work metaphysically is they follow the rules of metaphysics.
[03:10.000 --> 03:18.000]  They have to give you an escape route and they have to even tell you what they're doing, but then criticize it and make fun of it.
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.000]  If you warn people.
[03:23.000 --> 03:34.000]  The vampire has to be asked to be let in and then you have to let it in.
[03:34.000 --> 03:46.000]  So I'm going to do my best today at the start of the next hour to plunge directly into this.
[03:46.000 --> 03:59.000]  But I'm telling you, for anybody who wants to get together, I'm not saying I'm going to do this, but get together with real investors and real developers and go out to Wyoming, Montana, places like that.
[03:59.000 --> 04:08.000]  And buy enough land and get enough investors and enough people to move into the area to say that you don't want cell phones. You don't want cell towers.
[04:08.000 --> 04:17.000]  You want everything wired. That is going to be the biggest growth industry in the future because the cancer rates are just skyrocketing around the regular cell phones.
[04:17.000 --> 04:24.000]  And now the 5G, it's just unbelievable. And the behavioral problems, the effect it has on this on the central nervous system.
[04:24.000 --> 04:32.000]  I have a stack of scientific American articles admitting that it causes brain damage and mind control.
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.000]  Here's a headline. Mind control by cell phone. It's just, it's just all here.
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  You're like, oh, that's like the movie, The Kingsman. Yeah, but it's not a movie.
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  Makes you irritable. Breaks up your family. Makes you all alone.
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  Well, guess what? There's 14,000 square miles where the U.S. government has made cell phones illegal.
[04:53.000 --> 05:00.000]  Oh, and they did it 40 years ago. Oh, and guess where the elite lives? Oh.
[05:00.000 --> 05:07.000]  You want to nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by InfoWarsLife.

[05:59.000 --> 06:19.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:19.000 --> 06:32.000]  Yes, my friends, you found it. The vaunted. The celebrated. The superb. That's how we're seen by those that love liberty.
[06:32.000 --> 06:45.000]  We're seen as the victors. We're seen as the slayers. The globalist lies. But to the enemy, we are reviled and hated and cursed.
[06:45.000 --> 07:02.000]  And I wouldn't have it any other way. I hate you too. But I don't fight you because I hate you.
[07:02.000 --> 07:21.000]  I fight you because I love my family and I love humanity. You hate me. You hate me. You asked me. You asked me. You asked me. You asked me. And I didn't say anything.
[07:21.000 --> 07:34.000]  All right. I'm going to do my very best at the bottom of the hour. Usually I'd say something this big. I'd say next hour.
[07:34.000 --> 07:46.000]  And then by then I've already gotten wound up too much. Bottom of the hour, I'm going to summon my mental capacity to its fullest if that's possible.
[07:46.000 --> 07:54.000]  And I'm going to really try to lay out the facts and how we can stop it. But I have studied the architecture of the next phase, the globalist operation.
[07:54.000 --> 08:02.000]  And I am now starting out, as you've seen in the last few weeks, to laying out the analysis and the testament to those facts.
[08:02.000 --> 08:12.000]  So get ready on every subject, what they're going to do the family next, what 5G is going to do next, what the next military actions are going to be if the globalists are able to carry them out.
[08:12.000 --> 08:23.000]  And how their intimidation operations are going to work. What I see them doing with the casual society, it's all happening. It's all going into overdrive, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:23.000 --> 08:49.000]  Now, did you know that fiber optics has almost zero failure, right? And the best 5G out there is thousands of times slower than the best fiber that the public can get.
[08:49.000 --> 09:00.000]  Did you hear what I just said? I'm going to show you the engineering for that. There's no radiation that comes out of the end of a fiber optic cable other than light.
[09:00.000 --> 09:10.000]  What comes out of a 5G broadcasting array, they admit will kill you if you were to live by it, say 10 feet from it for a year.
[09:10.000 --> 09:17.000]  It would physically cook you. And in further distance, it just damages your DNA and gives you cancer.
[09:17.000 --> 09:28.000]  So why in the hell would they be rolling 5G out all over the world with all of its security risk and all of its problems and all of it, if it gives you cancer and doesn't work as well?
[09:28.000 --> 09:44.000]  Well, I'm going to explain all of it coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[09:44.000 --> 09:51.000]  Now, there's a place. There's not just one. They've got these facilities under different covers.
[09:51.000 --> 10:01.000]  And I've been told about these and I've looked into them and I've discovered at least 10. There are a lot more.
[10:01.000 --> 10:11.000]  There are at least 10 corridors in the Western world where no cell phone towers or microwave radiation towers are allowed.
[10:11.000 --> 10:18.000]  It turns out, guess who's running this program worldwide? NASA.
[10:18.000 --> 10:34.000]  Of course, who do you think NASA really is? It's the breakaway civilization or one of them set up by Kennedy, led and commanded by Nazis.
[10:34.000 --> 10:44.000]  And I'm not even saying that NASA itself was bad, but this is big boy stuff. This isn't junior wearing his little short shorts.
[10:44.000 --> 10:52.000]  This is the real world, folks, how the cookie really crumbles.
[10:52.000 --> 11:10.000]  And you have the establishment and ultra rich all moving completely now into these corridors and commuting by helicopter and aircraft for short periods of time into mega cities, the rest of the time video conferencing in.
[11:10.000 --> 11:18.000]  And if you read and follow the industry of Silicon Valley, very few of their CEOs or leadership are ever seen anymore.
[11:18.000 --> 11:26.000]  They just teleconference in and they teleconference in over fiber optic.
[11:26.000 --> 11:33.000]  They are all with their children far away from what they're setting up.
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  So that's coming up bottom of the hour. I'm going to get into it.
[11:37.000 --> 11:49.000]  And by the way, this is hiding like everything super evil is in pure view, pure evil hiding in pure view.
[11:49.000 --> 12:02.000]  Turn I'm turn a phrase I've known calling, but I intended pure view right in your face, telling you it kills you telling you it robs you and surveils you and doesn't even work good.
[12:02.000 --> 12:09.000]  When there are more advanced things that work far better and are proven and don't hurt you.
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.000]  Plus you see with electromagnetic radiation, you can control people's brains and their bodies and their cells.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  And so that's why this is happening. That's bottom of the hour.
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  And it'll take me a couple of segments to get to and then let me tell you what I'm going to cover in the second hour.
[12:25.000 --> 12:35.000]  We always have the Sunday show that's abbreviated 4 to 6pm and I have the weekday broadcast 11am to 3pm and we have the war room with Owen Schreuer 3pm every day doing a great job.
[12:35.000 --> 12:43.000]  And of course, David Knight weekday mornings and knocking out of the park 8am central, the verboten, the censored, the blocked, the hated, the lied about, find out why we're under attack.
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.000]  We've cracked the code. We've got the globalist operation. We know how to beat it.
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.000]  Most of the governments compartmentalized. Most of the governments good people, they don't know what's going on.
[12:52.000 --> 12:59.000]  But they know when they hear this show that we know more than they do in most cases and then we give them the missing pieces.
[12:59.000 --> 13:07.000]  Just like you have Legos and you got a bunch of Legos without the map, without the directions. You're like, what the hell does this build?
[13:07.000 --> 13:18.000]  But as soon as you have the directions, it's so simple. My dad bought me a high powered pellet gun for Christmas two Christmases ago.
[13:18.000 --> 13:26.000]  I've been fighting so hard, working so hard, I've never even opened it. And once I did open it, my wife threw away the box and the instructions, even though it was already built,
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.000]  took me 20 minutes to figure out where the lever was to break it, to pop it open and to cock it and load it.
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  I knew it. I had a button on. I knew it was a single shot, high powered, supersonic.
[13:37.000 --> 13:50.000]  And when I finally found the mechanism, it was the sight. I felt like an idiot, but I didn't have the owner's manual.
[13:50.000 --> 13:57.000]  Once I would have had it, I could have done it in 20 seconds. It's the same thing, folks. I've studied the pieces.
[13:57.000 --> 14:06.000]  We've got the owner's manual. We've got the blueprint. And let me tell you, it ain't pretty. You're not in Kansas anymore.
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  No, sir. And I'm not either.
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.000]  And all this race baiting and all this other crap isn't going to mean anything once the public finally gets what's happening.
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.000]  I'm going to explain something. It's going to get a lot worse a lot quicker from here on out.
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.000]  I'm not trying to be negative. I'm just telling you that there's a plan and we ain't in it.
[14:26.000 --> 14:35.000]  Like George Carl used to say, there's a club and we ain't in it. There's a plan and we ain't in it.
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  And I discovered the plan that many others have discovered 50 years before me, but I really dug into the plan
[14:41.000 --> 14:48.000]  and did more research than anybody else has really done into eugenics, depopulation, the whole world government plan from their own admissions.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  And the system was arrogant and they ignored me and I put out dozens of films for free.
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.000]  They were watched hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of times online for free.
[14:58.000 --> 15:05.000]  I sold millions of DVDs and I funded building this to resist them into the future knowing that once they announced their world government
[15:05.000 --> 15:10.000]  and once they started breaking up the family and once they started castrating little kids genitals
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  and once they launched their whole plan, people go, whoa, this is real.
[15:14.000 --> 15:21.000]  The globals are so arrogant they thought, no, they'll never wake up. They'll have learned helplessness.
[15:21.000 --> 15:27.000]  They'll never wake up. They'll have learned helplessness. They'll just adapt to being slaves and by the time they wake up, they'll be dead.
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  Wake up dead is the term. Never do what hits you.
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.000]  Well, guess what? We got the jump on you, globalists, because our listeners spread the word faithfully.
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  It was mainly Christians that did it. A lot of other folks, but Christians.
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.000]  That's why the globalists hate Christians because their whole prophecy is about what's being built, a world government,
[15:45.000 --> 15:51.000]  an attack on the family, a cashless world society, can't buy or sell. It's being announced now.
[15:51.000 --> 15:57.000]  And praise God. God's real. We're going to make it through this, but it's going to be tough. Stay with us.
[16:22.000 --> 16:29.000]  I know I'm getting under their skin. I'm bloody and then I'm up politically. I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[16:29.000 --> 16:36.000]  That just brings more people here. So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds. I need gas. I need ammo politically now.
[16:36.000 --> 16:43.000]  But literally, if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[16:43.000 --> 16:50.000]  We're unstoppable together. I want to send a strong message to the enemy. I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing
[16:50.000 --> 16:55.000]  and that you will stand with us and I will never back down. You have my commitment. This only gives me more energy
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.000]  Tom and Texas police officer on the border talks about MS-13 and more. Thanks for calling, Tom.
[17:10.000 --> 17:17.000]  Yes, sir. Thank you for taking my call. I just want to thank you for your product. I have an info word, P.K. I was on outside of my cell phone case.
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.000]  My truck, sport, the shirts, all the equipment. I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[17:21.000 --> 17:22.000]  God bless you, brother.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  And I have three or four info war bumper stickers in my glove box right now.
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.000]  I'll hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[17:29.000 --> 17:58.000]  You're our only hope, brother. I'm telling you, you're more important than I am. It's people like you on the ground as you know that's boots on the ground.
[17:58.000 --> 18:04.000]  Info war's life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:04.000 --> 18:13.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  eye comfort and respiratory function.
[18:16.000 --> 18:25.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials.
[18:28.000 --> 18:36.000]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[18:40.000 --> 18:50.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:53.000 --> 18:58.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.000]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long. Go ahead.
[19:01.000 --> 19:09.000]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man. It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, your bracket, it just gets old, man.
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[19:11.000 --> 19:18.000]  We're taking calls about your nomination. Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  I mean, what's it going to take? Us being shut down? Is that what you want, Frank?
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  Yeah, you know what, Alex?
[19:29.000 --> 19:36.000]  I'm going to put it on pause again. Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[19:36.000 --> 19:41.000]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.000]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  You understand? I need your help, Frank. I need your help, Frank.
[19:48.000 --> 19:54.000]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the info war.
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.000]  Do you understand? I need your help, Frank. Free press needs your help, Frank.
[19:58.000 --> 20:23.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:23.000 --> 20:33.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[20:33.000 --> 20:39.000]  Okay, let me tell you what's coming up in the second hour, though. Let me do that.
[20:39.000 --> 20:49.000]  Tucker Carlson has had Antifa put up flyers all around his house that they're planning an attack on his home coming up in a few days.
[20:49.000 --> 20:56.000]  They're organizing a lynch mob down the street. The Democrats are praising this, Maxine Waters is praising this.
[20:56.000 --> 21:02.000]  They really hate the fact that he talked to the president and helped stop the president from attacking Iran.
[21:02.000 --> 21:10.000]  Now, the left now openly wants total war, just absolute criminal activity. That's coming up.
[21:10.000 --> 21:15.000]  I know the inside baseball, a lot they've gone through, not just the stuff you've heard about in the news,
[21:15.000 --> 21:19.000]  but it's similar things we've gone through. I've had to have armed guards at my house.
[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  They say, oh, you can just go to sleep and just have a gun by your side. It doesn't work like that.
[21:24.000 --> 21:33.000]  I want to make sure anybody ever shows up and tries something. They're going to get it, so it's expensive, but that's what's got to be done.
[21:33.000 --> 21:41.000]  Now continuing, you've got the latest with Trump and the fact that we're swamped. We're overwhelmed with human trafficking.
[21:41.000 --> 21:49.000]  I've got mainline articles, Fox News, AP, human trafficking in America, amongst worse in the world, report by the UN,
[21:49.000 --> 21:57.000]  and people blame Trump for that. That's because the globalists have done their bum rush to overwhelm us and crush our borders
[21:57.000 --> 22:03.000]  and overwhelm the courts and overwhelm the jails. And then when we put people in facilities to find out who's who,
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  one-third of the kids aren't even with their parents, we're told it's a concentration camp.
[22:08.000 --> 22:14.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, though people don't fight to get into a concentration camp, they fight to get out of them,
[22:14.000 --> 22:23.000]  but Omar incests Ilhan, or Ilhan incests Omar, you know, married her brother.
[22:23.000 --> 22:29.000]  Probably got three kids with him. I can't believe it. She says, what's wrong with calling the concentration camps?
[22:29.000 --> 22:34.000]  Hey, Penn Head, why'd you try to come here so you could conquer us? I know.
[22:34.000 --> 22:43.000]  Once you get out on those little Somali pirate boats, see how it goes for you. Just absolutely never ends.
[22:43.000 --> 22:50.000]  Hey, we're letting in a bunch of crazy pirates and they're pissing on us. What a surprise. That's all coming up.
[22:50.000 --> 22:56.000]  Also, we're going to get into the latest with Iran. We're going to the latest. The story is linked up on dredgerport.com.
[22:56.000 --> 23:10.000]  Amazon patents creepy drone technology to spy on your home. And then, oh, infowars.com published this with a letter from the Justice Department and the FBI.
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.000]  And no media picked it up, of course. FBI clears info wars and child porn hoax.
[23:16.000 --> 23:23.000]  We've been sent 9.6 million emails since Sandy Hook. They sent us a penis for all 9 million.
[23:23.000 --> 23:29.000]  We fought it in court in five different, six different hearings. The judge said 57,000.
[23:29.000 --> 23:38.000]  Any email that had Sandy Hook or anybody's name associated with it, all these search terms, two law firms, tons of money later.
[23:38.000 --> 23:47.000]  We sent them 57,000 emails complying. They had hidden coded links in them to child porn that we never opened.
[23:47.000 --> 23:55.000]  The FBI said we were the victim. The media said, oh, that's just your lawyer saying that now I have the letter from the FBI.
[23:55.000 --> 24:03.000]  But that doesn't stop the media. They're still running with headlines. Did you hear Jones sent child porn to the Sandy Hook families?
[24:03.000 --> 24:18.000]  No, their lawyers, famous Democrat prosecutors, now turned ambulance chasers, sued me and asked for all the emails.
[24:18.000 --> 24:25.000]  And when they got the emails they got, they went in there and found this and went reported to the FBI hoping I'd get in trouble.
[24:25.000 --> 24:40.000]  I didn't get in trouble. I was the victim. But what's worse about it is that I had a feeling when the FBI got back with us and it's in the letter
[24:40.000 --> 24:47.000]  and gave us a list of the email addresses and how to track them. We have a reward out that it would have come after the lawsuits.
[24:47.000 --> 24:56.000]  And guess what? It did. It wasn't the first five years or five and a half years.
[24:56.000 --> 25:05.000]  No, right after I get sued, we get sent child porn. We don't open. Never gets past the spam filter with hidden links.
[25:05.000 --> 25:12.000]  Oh, man. And they went to court and they begged that judge to make us open the attachments in the hearings.
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  We said, no, we're not opening attachments. We don't know what's in them. If we would have opened them.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  We would have been opened to five years in federal prison for opening child porn.
[25:21.000 --> 25:27.000]  But guess what? We didn't open them. We said no.
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  But we still get subjected to being called that in the press, unbelievable.
[25:32.000 --> 25:42.000]  Shall I get more into that? Storiesuponinfullwars.com and newswars.com. So when your family calls, like, mind's called, like, what's all this child porn stuff?
[25:42.000 --> 25:48.000]  You could just go, oh, here's a letter from the FBI. Oh my gosh. Well, I hope they catch you. Get it? That's horrible crime.
[25:48.000 --> 25:55.000]  Yeah, that's Democrats. Whoever did it is a Democrat, obviously. Who else would have child porn to send it to somebody?
[25:55.000 --> 26:01.000]  Who does things like this and then hides it?
[26:01.000 --> 26:07.000]  That's how crazy it's gotten to fight for this country.
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.000]  They said the same thing about Alan Dershowitz. Turned out it wasn't true. Same thing about Trump. Was it true?
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  We're the people that advocate for children here. We're the people that fight child trafficking.
[26:16.000 --> 26:24.000]  You know, like the Senate report admitted, tens of thousands of children were sex trafficked into the U.S. under Obama letting them in and were given to sex traffickers.
[26:24.000 --> 26:32.000]  Senate report. Washington Post. I'm not the one trafficking kids in the U.S. It's a Democratic Party and Trump's trying to stop it.
[26:32.000 --> 26:40.000]  So what happens? Well, the media runs with a story that I sent child porn to people that subpoenaed me when it was hidden links.
[26:40.000 --> 26:47.000]  It says the families. It was sent to the lawyers and they're the ones that subpoenaed it.
[26:47.000 --> 26:50.000]  Unbelievable. The good news is everybody sees through it.
[26:50.000 --> 26:56.000]  Separately, we've got something special coming up this week and a long time. So we did some big overnight special transmission.
[26:56.000 --> 27:05.000]  Clown World. Clown World, the greatest comedy show on Earth. Two nights, 20 candidates and tons of laughs.
[27:05.000 --> 27:12.000]  June 26th and 27th coverage starts at 7 p.m. Our regular broadcasting ends at 6 p.m. Central at 7 p.m.
[27:12.000 --> 27:19.000]  Myself, Owen Schreuer and a whole list of other guests will do one hour of pre coverage and then we'll have live clown world coverage
[27:19.000 --> 27:30.000]  of Beto O'Rourke and Cory Booker and Bernie Tambov. Eric Swallows well.
[27:30.000 --> 27:42.000]  Camila Harris and so many others like De Blasio. It's all coming up this Wednesday and Thursday.
[27:42.000 --> 27:52.000]  Coverage starts at 7 p.m. Central Standard Time and when you get excited about a live broadcast, a special broadcast,
[27:52.000 --> 27:58.000]  we've had millions during elections like 5 million to one night. We've had 3 million to other special elections.
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  When you don't get excited a few hundred thousand to an end, that's still great.
[28:01.000 --> 28:07.000]  But when you get excited about infowars.com and newswars.com and our own audio and our own video feeds and local radio stations,
[28:07.000 --> 28:16.000]  it'll be family friendly. Everyone's small and it's internet only. I start using non-kings language and they take me off here when I do that now.
[28:16.000 --> 28:25.000]  So it doesn't ever happen. Good clean family fun. That's clown world, the greatest show on earth this Wednesday and Thursday.
[28:25.000 --> 28:32.000]  We will have live coverage of the two democratic debates. I mean there was like 26 of them, 27 of them, but I guess only 20 have made the cut.
[28:32.000 --> 28:43.000]  So this is going to be step aside. Step aside Ted Bundy. Step aside John Wayne Gacy.
[28:43.000 --> 28:53.000]  What's the name of the clown in it? Step aside it. This is going to be the real clown world.
[28:53.000 --> 28:59.000]  Stay with us ladies and gentlemen newswars.com. Tomorrow's news today.
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  I just want listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[29:04.000 --> 29:11.000]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[29:11.000 --> 29:16.000]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton of it, okay?
[29:16.000 --> 29:19.000]  But you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get $20,000.
[29:19.000 --> 29:22.000]  That doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew.
[29:22.000 --> 29:25.000]  So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product.
[29:25.000 --> 29:29.000]  I want to expand, not contract. And for six months, we've not just made a standstill.
[29:29.000 --> 29:34.000]  The enemy's been winning and I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  I like to be expanding. I like to be winning. I like to be fighting.
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.000]  And we are winning the info war. That's why we're so hated, but we need to be retreaded.
[29:40.000 --> 29:44.000]  We need to be tuned up. We need to be fixed up. We never have time to get into drive up.
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.000]  We got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us.
[29:47.000 --> 29:52.000]  Then they're really going to plant child porn on us. Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else.
[29:52.000 --> 29:56.000]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the Chicombs.

[33:21.000 --> 33:37.000]  Alex Jones here back live and I'm sitting here in my television slash radio studio in central Texas.
[33:37.000 --> 33:42.000]  Literally on ground that my ancestors conquered.
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000]  And I don't want to be conquered by the globalist.
[33:45.000 --> 33:50.000]  I've studied their plans with the military and political mind.
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.000]  I've devised their endgame.
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.000]  I've developed strategies and operations to defeat them.
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  That's why they want me off here.
[33:59.000 --> 34:07.000]  You see there's tens of thousands of shows and programs in the U.S. alone, hundreds of thousands worldwide conservatively.
[34:07.000 --> 34:14.000]  But where are the programs, where are the shows actually talking about the real world?
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  They're not there.
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.000]  And the globalists know that info wars is not bragging.
[34:20.000 --> 34:30.000]  We're pointing out the fact that when you hear Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity talking about the New World Order and global government in the surveillance state and all the rest of it.
[34:30.000 --> 34:45.000]  Individuals like myself and Ron Paul and Matt Drudge and going all the way back to like Barry Goldwater made it safe to talk about those things.
[34:45.000 --> 34:52.000]  So I said I would get into the giant news here at the bottom of the hour.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  And I'm not doing this for suspense.
[34:56.000 --> 35:04.000]  I was sitting here during the break trying to figure out where I start.
[35:04.000 --> 35:12.000]  I mean something this big, you should build up for like a year and have spotlights at night going.
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.000]  Because people don't pay attention unless you have fanfare like the Super Bowl or the Oscars.
[35:18.000 --> 35:27.000]  And then a huge 50 foot TV screens at a PowerPoint showing the quotes and showing the admissions and showing all the facts and having ominous music play.
[35:27.000 --> 35:35.000]  So people get, hey out of the whole wash of the news and information you hear and see, this is really what's important.
[35:35.000 --> 35:44.000]  But see that's how the globalists operate. They show you all this glitz and all this glamour and all this fancy crap.
[35:44.000 --> 35:58.000]  And then they tell you that there aren't two genders and that men are bad and that capitalism is bad when they're ultra rich and they sell you poison with the sugar fancy coating.
[35:58.000 --> 36:09.000]  Where you might get real wisdom sitting out on a dock with an old man fishing or working in a factory or going to church.
[36:09.000 --> 36:15.000]  Not a lot of fanfare there. So I will start next segment.
[36:15.000 --> 36:20.000]  I promise and it will go into the next hour.
[36:20.000 --> 36:31.000]  But when I go and I research this before I decide to talk about it and I decide to pull up articles and documents and things I've already read.
[36:31.000 --> 36:42.000]  And then I start to rescan over articles I've read over the years. It makes me excited that, oh my gosh, they admit it all will be able to stop it.
[36:42.000 --> 36:53.000]  And then I remember that it's a weird psychological thing about people.
[36:53.000 --> 37:08.000]  Back when world government was secret and you'd have to get Library of Congress documents leaked to you in an alley in DC by the caretaker of a dead senator's estate.
[37:08.000 --> 37:20.000]  People were just blown away because it was secret and it was proof that it was the media would deny that Bilderberg was meeting and they, you know, all that stuff.
[37:20.000 --> 37:28.000]  But then when they just come right out in the open London Guardian and say, the elite have moved to New Zealand and underground bunkers.
[37:28.000 --> 37:35.000]  They believe the world is going to end as we know it soon and there'll be depopulation.
[37:35.000 --> 37:40.000]  It's like a big deal. These are the people running things.
[37:40.000 --> 37:48.000]  This is the establishment and they've already been dug in and I can't even get, you know, I love Mark Dice. He's a great guy.
[37:48.000 --> 37:59.000]  But when he got mad at me 10 years ago over an argument we had about a book deal, he attacked me and we ought to find that video somewhere where he said,
[37:59.000 --> 38:08.000]  Jones is crazy. Somebody finds it online because I can't find it. Send it to me because he memorialized it.
[38:08.000 --> 38:19.000]  He said, Jones claims he knows James Cameron and that James Cameron has moved to New Zealand to avoid a digital AI takeover and an apocalypse.
[38:19.000 --> 38:25.000]  Because I talked about it on air like 10, 12 years ago and Dice thought it was bull and he said it was bull.
[38:25.000 --> 38:33.000]  I didn't say I talked to James Cameron. I was out in LA and I met with some lawyers and top producers that had produced some of his movies.
[38:33.000 --> 38:40.000]  And they said, unfortunately, James doesn't care about changing the way we watch movies on a big screen.
[38:40.000 --> 38:46.000]  He was going to have a 360 screen and they were going to have holograms and they already had the technology and he was going to.
[38:46.000 --> 38:57.000]  But Cameron decided that the elites going to kill everybody with a bio weapon. So Cameron has run off to a bunker in New Zealand and a bunch of other elites are running out there.
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.000]  And he's got all these ships out there he claims trying to find sunken wrecks. That's his tax write off.
[39:03.000 --> 39:13.000]  He's got ships because he's afraid New Zealand will fall and he's got ships that have got Faraday cages in them that will survive EMPs.
[39:13.000 --> 39:19.000]  Now, I said all that on shows. And when I said to these producers, I said, well, can I say that?
[39:19.000 --> 39:26.000]  They go, yeah, just don't say we told you. Because back then I wasn't as big as Alex Jones is today supposedly.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  And I came on air and I said, the leader moving to New Zealand, they're building underground bunkers for the end of the world.
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.000]  And they believe there's an AI takeover and a bio weapons going to be released.
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  Now, you know, 10 years later, Elon Musk is saying all that because he's in the meetings.
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  Well, look at these headlines. London Guardian.
[39:45.000 --> 39:51.000]  Why Silicon Valley billionaires are prepping for the apocalypse in New Zealand?
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  That's last year, 10 years after I told you.
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.000]  Terminator director Cameron says machines have already won.
[40:00.000 --> 40:08.000]  U.S. elites buying up New Zealand redoubts to escape crack up civilization.
[40:08.000 --> 40:13.000]  5G gives you cancer. Wired magazine.
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.000]  Let me explain something, ladies and gentlemen. This isn't BS.
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  I'm on record telling you all this.
[40:22.000 --> 40:28.000]  Now, is it going to happen?
[40:28.000 --> 40:36.000]  I've met with research scientists and people that hold patents and people that are worth, you know, $100 million, $200 million,
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.000]  who don't even feel like they're part of the establishment, who are scared
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  and who have moved to different areas around the country and the whole country of Texas.
[40:44.000 --> 40:50.000]  And they say there's no stopping all this. They say it's all done.
[40:50.000 --> 40:56.000]  All I know is I've got a job to try to warn you. And this is the real reason they've got us off here.
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  This is the real reason they're trying to shut us down because let me tell you something.
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  We're telling you the truth and you have a right to know the truth.
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.000]  And I had to have a talk with my wife this weekend. I probably had to have one of my ex-wives soon
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.000]  and just say, listen, all troubles aside, all fighting with each other aside,
[41:11.000 --> 41:17.000]  we need to decide what we're going to do because whether it's going to be bio weapons or 5G that give you cancer,
[41:17.000 --> 41:23.000]  all of the establishment is moving out of populated areas now.
[41:23.000 --> 41:31.000]  And they're moving to these very quiet cell phone free areas, even where there's industrial things nearby,
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  they won't build cell towers since the globalists have control over the companies.
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.000]  And I'm going to be publishing maps of this soon from their own admissions.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  There's something big, a big plan's about to happen.
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  I don't know if the frequencies are going to activate a virus that's already in you,
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.000]  that's given to you airborne, so it's binary. I'm not sure. There's technology that does that.
[41:51.000 --> 41:55.000]  I'm just saying we know this is a weapon system. We're getting hit.
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  And this isn't a Netflix series about Into the World.
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  It's all these Netflix series about Into the World because they're getting you ready, folks,
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.000]  at a subconscious level to accept this as if it was meant to happen.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  Yeah, print me that Bloomberg article about how they're getting ready for the Into the World as well.
[42:12.000 --> 42:20.000]  And now they've gone from us telling you about it to now they're telling you about it and getting you ready for it.
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  So I just want to tell all the yuppies and establishment people and the rest of you,
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  you're not going to get out of this. You think you're going to escape this whole globalist program?
[42:29.000 --> 42:35.000]  You're crazy. Whatever you do, however you're listening, tell everyone on local AM and FM, local TV,
[42:35.000 --> 42:41.000]  or on the Internet, hey, Alex Jones is covering the fact that there are secret government facilities
[42:41.000 --> 42:47.000]  built all over the United States in areas where cell phones are illegal and he's about to show proof.
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  You think I'll show you proof? I will.
[42:50.000 --> 42:56.000]  When we come back, I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[43:20.000 --> 43:28.000]  Oh, my God, Corey Booker, the amazing, oh, Pocahontas Joe Biden,
[43:28.000 --> 43:33.000]  Swallows Wells, his little new gun owners, yay, Bernie Sanders,
[43:33.000 --> 43:38.000]  lunch, the Soviet Union, Kamala Harris, and so many more.
[43:38.000 --> 43:44.000]  It's The Greatest Show on Earth at infowars.com for its last show, Wednesday and Thursday night.
[43:44.000 --> 43:50.000]  The Greatest Comedy Show on Earth, two nights only, 20 candidates and tons of laughs.
[43:50.000 --> 43:58.000]  June 26th and 27th, coverage starts at 7 p.m. at infowars.com forward slash show.
[44:00.000 --> 44:04.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[44:04.000 --> 44:07.000]  The viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you,
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen,
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.000]  but I wanted to take just a minute out here, from the bottom of my heart,
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.000]  to tell you how much it means to me, that when you saw all those lies against us last week,
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  the worst things you can say about people, that you knew they were liars,
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.000]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder,
[44:26.000 --> 44:30.000]  and I feel your love in my heart, and I want you to know that love is right back at you,
[44:30.000 --> 44:34.000]  and I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support,
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.000]  because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win,
[44:37.000 --> 44:41.000]  and without you, I'm going to be destroyed, and it's not going to be fun,
[44:41.000 --> 44:44.000]  but that's not what's important, the enemy could win.
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  We're being used by God. You're being used by God.
[44:48.000 --> 44:53.000]  This is Providence, so I salute you, and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[44:53.000 --> 44:58.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[44:58.000 --> 45:07.000]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.000]  where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[45:11.000 --> 45:16.000]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions,
[45:16.000 --> 45:21.000]  we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and wake up America,
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  Patriot Blend Coffee.
[45:23.000 --> 45:29.000]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee bean.
[45:29.000 --> 45:34.000]  Carefully harvested and free of toxic chemicals used in big agricultural productions,
[45:34.000 --> 45:41.000]  Patriot Blend coffees have a smooth, bold flavor with great depth to give you just what you need in the morning.
[45:41.000 --> 45:45.000]  You can even choose to start your morning healthier with the immune support blend,
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.000]  infused with a powerful blend to support your immune response and stamina.
[45:49.000 --> 45:54.000]  To take care of your morning routine, get a bag of Patriot Blend coffee to support the show
[45:54.000 --> 45:59.000]  while enhancing your morning routine at infowarsstore.com.
[46:09.000 --> 46:18.000]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[46:18.000 --> 46:23.000]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[46:23.000 --> 46:28.000]  that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[46:28.000 --> 46:34.000]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink,
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.000]  pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[46:37.000 --> 46:40.000]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[46:40.000 --> 46:47.000]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[46:47.000 --> 46:50.000]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours,
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  so take a half pack at the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  because it will take you into overdrive.
[46:57.000 --> 47:26.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:26.000 --> 47:31.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[47:31.000 --> 47:48.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:48.000 --> 48:00.000]  Okay, 15, 16, 17 years ago, George Herbert Walker Bush's son, George W. Bush, was president.
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.000]  And I made a bunch of films critical of him and his agenda.
[48:04.000 --> 48:09.000]  And so the Democratic Party was trying to get me to join them.
[48:09.000 --> 48:15.000]  And I was out in Los Angeles routinely on national TV shows, I was in some big movies.
[48:15.000 --> 48:25.000]  And then one day I was going to be invited out to meet James Cameron out at one of his research facilities.
[48:25.000 --> 48:31.000]  And the day it was supposed to happen, one of the producers that's in his films comes over and goes,
[48:31.000 --> 48:32.000]  let's just go get dinner.
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.000]  James has left the country, he was going to give you and some others a tour,
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  but he just decided this is off record not to launch this new project.
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  It's going to be new movies with holograms and 360 screens.
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  He just doesn't think there's going to be a future for humanity.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  I said, well, what did he tell you?
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.000]  And by then it was at dinner with these people.
[48:52.000 --> 48:57.000]  They said, well, he's just disillusioned and believes that there's about to be an extinction event of humanity,
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.000]  or at least a huge die off, and that it's going to be orchestrated.
[49:01.000 --> 49:09.000]  And that he even agrees that it may not be the worst thing and that he's building armored fortresses in New Zealand.
[49:09.000 --> 49:15.000]  And that, you know, he's got those ships you think are for exploration.
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.000]  Of course, either folks I've known for years, so they're just telling me this like I'm a fly on the wall.
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  I was just little Alex Jones back then, not the big evil Alex Jones.
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  And they're like, he has those ships in case New Zealand falls.
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  He's got these research vessels, five or six big ones.
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  So I'm hearing this and I'm going, well, this is crazy.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  So I said, can I talk about it?
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  And they said, no, you can't talk about it.
[49:37.000 --> 49:41.000]  But we just don't say it's him or just don't say you heard it from us.
[49:41.000 --> 49:46.000]  So I came out for a few years and said the Hollywood elite are running to New Zealand.
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  Then later it was announced he'd moved to New Zealand.
[49:49.000 --> 49:55.000]  And I just went ahead and said, well, he's moved there because he believes the collapse of civilization is coming.
[49:55.000 --> 50:02.000]  Now, about 10 years later, this is about 12 years ago, it's been in the New York Post, New York Times, Bloomberg.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  I can show you a bunch of articles for your TV viewer.
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  You can see them on screen.
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  Now, why am I starting this discussion with this?
[50:10.000 --> 50:25.000]  I later learned that the Silicon Valley crowd is running to Kauai, Hawaii, where the most secretive Pentagon, NSA, super weapons,
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  space-based weapons are directed from.
[50:27.000 --> 50:30.000]  I mean, Kauai is like a underground base, okay?
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.000]  Also super gorgeous.
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  That's why I started going to Kauai to check it out.
[50:36.000 --> 50:42.000]  Zuckerberg's got like a, you know, 10,000-acre ranch, whatever it is.
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  And again, they're building fortresses there, and that's come out in the news.
[50:46.000 --> 50:52.000]  And I mean underground bases, I mean rocks that pop up and have, you know, huge double 50-caliber guns at them.
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  I'm talking about drone attack helicopters.
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  I've talked to folks in Kauai that have worked on them.
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  Right across, there's Lenai.
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  And so Larry Ellison of Oracle has Lenai.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  He owns part of the island.
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  He has an armored fortress on it.
[51:06.000 --> 51:09.000]  So it's Lenai, it's Kauai.
[51:09.000 --> 51:14.000]  They're trying to buy from the ocean-faring Amish folks.
[51:14.000 --> 51:15.000]  I'm not kidding.
[51:15.000 --> 51:19.000]  They call it the Forbidden Island off the coast of Kauai.
[51:19.000 --> 51:27.000]  There's another island that was bought from the king of Hawaii before the U.S. took it over 150 years ago.
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  That's got Amish living on it.
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  And I know the globalists have been trying to buy that from them, but they haven't sold it.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  Crazy.
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  You can do day hunting trips though there.
[51:38.000 --> 51:43.000]  I thought about helicoptering out there and doing a hunting trip for Wild Boar just to reconnoiter the area.
[51:43.000 --> 51:44.000]  But that's where they're going.
[51:44.000 --> 51:48.000]  They're going to Tasmania, south of Australia.
[51:48.000 --> 51:53.000]  They're going to New Zealand, north of Australia.
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.000]  Or I guess kind of east of Australia, northeast of Australia.
[51:56.000 --> 51:57.000]  This is happening.
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  This is going on.
[51:59.000 --> 52:06.000]  But if Hollywood and the bankers and the media and the left are running to New Zealand,
[52:06.000 --> 52:12.000]  and a lot of other elitists, people like J.K. Rowling's are running to Tasmania,
[52:12.000 --> 52:15.000]  and the British Royal Family's built redouts there.
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  Where are the bushes going?
[52:17.000 --> 52:18.000]  Paraguay of all places.
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  Buying 200,000 acre ranches.
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  They have airfields, shipping operations.
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.000]  We're talking up to 1,000 troops any one time there, paramilitary.
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  They got that going on down there.
[52:31.000 --> 52:39.000]  But what's going on here in the United States, in Conus, continental United States,
[52:39.000 --> 52:42.000]  and what's going on in Canada?
[52:42.000 --> 52:54.000]  And I've talked to the folks that have been stringing the fiber optic cable,
[52:54.000 --> 53:00.000]  in some cases over 100 miles from internet zones, where the internet zones end,
[53:00.000 --> 53:07.000]  into underground facilities where these individuals are moving into.
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  Because they've got to have engineers to do it.
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  You've seen a lot of the engineers we've had on air.
[53:11.000 --> 53:17.000]  We've had the former head of technical of the NSA on many, many times.
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  He hasn't given any info on this.
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  I'm just giving you an example of the food chain here.
[53:21.000 --> 53:26.000]  Former head of the NSA, William Benny, right down to engineers that put in the cell towers
[53:26.000 --> 53:31.000]  and put in the NSA snooping hubs right at the cell tower level with the fiber optic.
[53:31.000 --> 53:34.000]  And by the way, the NSA gets their stuff all off fiber optic mainly.
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  Some of it's wireless, but it's collected to fiber optic.
[53:37.000 --> 53:42.000]  If you go to AT&T or whatever, they have whole floors of Verizon or Deutsche Telecom,
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.000]  doesn't matter.
[53:43.000 --> 53:49.000]  You go to these and there'll be a whole room or floor that's just their fiber optics
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  hooked into your fiber optics.
[53:51.000 --> 53:55.000]  So it all ends at the end chain with fiber optics.
[53:55.000 --> 53:58.000]  So I'm just giving everybody some base here.
[53:58.000 --> 54:09.000]  Before we return and I give you the gigantic trillion pound inch a lot of Maximus.
[54:09.000 --> 54:14.000]  Because they're not just running to Kauai.
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  They're not just running to Lonay.
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  They're not just running to Tasmania.
[54:18.000 --> 54:22.000]  They're not just running to armored redoubts in the middle of the desert in Australia.
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  They're not just running to New Zealand.
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  They're not just running to Switzerland in the mountains.
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  They're not just running.
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.000]  No, the majority of the top tier.
[54:35.000 --> 54:40.000]  And the second tier, their minions know about this now.
[54:40.000 --> 54:46.000]  So what happens once the minions learn about this Exodus and once we give you these secrets on air,
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.000]  it's going to blow everything for them.
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  Now.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  Now, why is that so important?
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  I've explained how to blow globalist operations before.
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  How to take back nations with populism.
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  How to get populist candidates elected.
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  This is why they want me dead, okay?
[55:00.000 --> 55:04.000]  It's why they haven't killed me yet, though, because I'd be a martyr and then you'd listen to what I said.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  They want to kill my name instead.
[55:06.000 --> 55:12.000]  But I'm going to lay out the next phase that give people in corporations that aren't evil
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  and the people in government that aren't evil.
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.000]  Because you're all compartmentalized just like I am.
[55:17.000 --> 55:21.000]  If we're aware of this and understand this is real.
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  This is happening.
[55:23.000 --> 55:29.000]  If they know they pull a bio weapon that reduces world population by billions
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  and that we know to blame them, they won't do it.
[55:31.000 --> 55:36.000]  If we know 5G gives us cancer and we know the elite are moving to areas to be away from it,
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  they'll never get away with it.
[55:38.000 --> 55:43.000]  If we know about their plans for the UN to break the borders and flood the country,
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  we'll make provisions to stop it.
[55:45.000 --> 55:51.000]  If we know they're putting cancer viruses in major vaccines, people won't take them.
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  You understand?
[55:53.000 --> 55:56.000]  We know how to blow their operation because they're behind.
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  We're still on air. Others are on air.
[55:58.000 --> 56:04.000]  But that's why they've tried to psychologically inoculate everyone that I'm the devil and don't listen to me
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.000]  is because they hope you're such a coward that you'll think,
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  oh, well, he's been demonized. He's been attacked.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  I better not defend him.
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  I better not repeat what he says. They'll come after me.
[56:13.000 --> 56:18.000]  You're going to lose everything within 10 years.
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  And that means your life, most of you, if you don't listen to me very, very carefully.
[56:22.000 --> 56:27.000]  This isn't some movie like Bird Box where she tells the kids, shut up or you're dead.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  You'll die. This is real.
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  Most of you are already walking dead.
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  I probably am already.
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  We already are chop-full of airborne crap. You name it.
[56:36.000 --> 56:37.000]  They've already got us.
[56:37.000 --> 56:44.000]  They're getting ready to spring it with a binary wave with 5G.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  That's right.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  That's only one aspect of it.
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  So I'm going to lay out their plan to kill you and your family.
[56:52.000 --> 56:57.000]  And that means if you're in the FBI, that means if you're at work at the butcher area at a grocery store,
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  that means if you're a school teacher, it means you're black, you're white, you're Asian, you're whatever.
[57:01.000 --> 57:07.000]  You are under globalist attack by a breakaway civilization.
[57:07.000 --> 57:10.000]  And all the money is running for the exits.
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  Even people worth 20 million, 50 million have got the word and are running.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  They're gone. They're not around.
[57:16.000 --> 57:19.000]  And when you look around and nobody's there, what's that mean?
[57:19.000 --> 57:22.000]  It means they're getting ready to pull the trigger.
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.000]  We're going to break. Please don't forget we have the Save the Info Wars mega special.
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  Please support us. It's great products anyways.
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.000]  Store-wide free shipping, 50% off all the supplements and double Patriot points
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.000]  and a bunch of other specials on air filtration, water filtration, you name it.
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  Please support us in the face of this. We need funding plus these are great products.
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  Second hour, I detail the big secrets.
[57:49.000 --> 57:54.000]  I just want listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[57:54.000 --> 57:58.000]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off.
[57:58.000 --> 58:02.000]  But we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price.
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  And we're moving a ton of it, okay?
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.000]  But you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get $20,000.
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  That doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew.
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.000]  So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product.
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  I want to expand, not contract.
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  And for six months, we've not just made a standstill.
[58:19.000 --> 58:20.000]  The enemy's been winning.
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.000]  And I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  I like to be expanding. I like to be winning. I like to be fighting.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  And we are winning the Info War. That's why we're so hated.
[58:28.000 --> 58:32.000]  But we need to be retreaded. We need to be tuned up. We need to be fixed up.
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  We never have time to get it to dry out. We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[58:35.000 --> 58:40.000]  And the enemy wants to silence us. Then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else.
[58:42.000 --> 58:45.000]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor,
[58:45.000 --> 58:46.000]  funded by foreign banks and the CHICOM.
[58:46.000 --> 58:49.000]  So go to mfullwarstore.com.
[58:49.000 --> 58:52.000]  I want to be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  We're going into the season of war.
[58:54.000 --> 58:57.000]  And they have been inches from shutting down the final bank accounts we have
[58:57.000 --> 59:00.000]  through their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[59:00.000 --> 59:04.000]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[59:04.000 --> 59:06.000]  We need to be in here. We need to be provisioned.
[59:06.000 --> 59:10.000]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[59:10.000 --> 59:14.000]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[59:16.000 --> 59:20.000]  I'm banging ads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[59:20.000 --> 59:21.000]  That just brings more people here.
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you.
[59:23.000 --> 59:27.000]  And I need war bonds. I need gas. I need ammo politically now.
[59:27.000 --> 59:31.000]  But literally, if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases
[59:31.000 --> 59:35.000]  and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable. We're unstoppable together.
[59:35.000 --> 59:38.000]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy. I want to raise a couple million dollars right now
[59:38.000 --> 59:42.000]  to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us.
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  And I will never back down to have my commitment.
[59:44.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  A big extinction is coming.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  I want to stand up against it. I've not steered you wrong yet.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  I'm not steering myself wrong.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  I'm going to spend two more segments on this and get into the news. I haven't hit yet.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  I've covered a lot of information that I've covered previously but giving you updates on it.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  There are giant government projects going on that are hundreds of times bigger than the Manhattan Project.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  The Manhattan Project to develop atomic weapons before the Nazis and the Axis did.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  They had a couple hundred thousand people working directly on it and they were able to keep it quiet
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  until they dropped Fat Man and Little Boy on Hiroshima and Nakasaki in 1945.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  Now, if you understand silent weapons for quiet wars and you understand soft kill,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  this is the end of the age of man according to the globalist. This is the end of humanity.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  But we're not meant to know what hits us. It's meant to lower our cue, poison us, make us infertile,
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  dumb us down, culturally wreck us.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  The cultural norms no one would follow where we're so confused and so stunned,
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  like a spider that bites its prey, pumps in some poison, ties it up, lets it dissolve their innards.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  A spider comes and checks, touches it to see that it's liquefied, and then when that heart's barely beaten in that bug,
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  it then, and it dies right as the last drops are sucked in. It's done with such loving precision.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  And so we're tied up in web right now, but we can still break out. We can still get away.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  But see, it likes you to suffer as long as possible and struggle and release all those stress hormones
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  before the vampire, a real vampire, a real blood drinker, sucks everything you ever are and ever were
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  and ever will be out of you.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  It's liberal. Just like those babies after their barn, keeping them comfortable.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  Keeping them comfortable for a week or so, all the orders come in, top bitted prices, and then,
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  then you slice them open and take all the goodies out.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  And then those doctors go out and play golf, visit their mistresses.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  The love is so good for them.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  Well, they're going to fry you and your family real slow, like a poached egg.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  And so I want to show you how they're doing. I want to show you where they're moving.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  I want to show you how they think they're going to sit there while there's all these runs for cancer
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  and all these events. And why do half the kids have cancer?
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  Oh, you don't know. It's liberal, though. We keep them comfortable and have lots of runs
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  and lots of events and bake sales, raising money to treat it, never wondering
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  why they rolled out the 5G and other things they knew would kill us.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  That's right. Children, doctors say, particularly vulnerable, dangerous 5G,
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  that's all right as long as we keep them comfortable.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  So we'll come right back in one minute and I'll get totally focused.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  And I'm going to drill into the land where there is no internet.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  But what's beneath all that? Why is there 14,000 square miles?
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  One of only many safe zones where the establishment are moving as fast as they can.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  What are they trying to escape? What treat is it they have in store for us?
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  Are they going to keep us comfortable?
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  We're going to blow their operation on the boo the others. And this is key.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  Now, $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  I've got two in my home. You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house. Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  Have clean air. Go to infowarstore.com.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  So if you just joined us, I spent much of the last hour. Your TV viewers showing you Bloomberg,
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  AP Reuters, New York Times, London Guardian, that the elite are all moving to New Zealand
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  in underground bunkers for the collapse of civilization.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  Well, I explained that that is a diversion. That's where a bunch of Hollywood folks have been led by James Cameron.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  There is a client government there that's socialist and they are working with the government.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  He also has a private navy to escape what he says will be the mass culling of the earth.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  I first broke that more than 12 years ago. He's now gone public the last five saying it's coming.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  Dr. Kim shot, please. So I'll recap that and get into the big news.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  The super rich of Silicon Valley have a doomsday escape plan. Bloomberg.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  Why Silicon Valley billionaires are prepping for the apocalypse in New Zealand?
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  Terminator director James Cameron, the machines have already won.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  And you've got, again, Elon Musk saying the end of the world's coming. They're going to depopulate us.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  The elites have decided to get rid of us. U.S. elites buying up New Zealand redoubts to escape crack up of civilization.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  Now, what is the crack up of civilization?
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  What do they know that we don't know? Well, we actually do know.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  Normal cell phone radiation from the towers and the phones causes massive brain tumors, massive breakage of DNA.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  We've been spending years covering all that. It's a fact.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  Anybody can just look at themselves. But here's Wired Magazine. 5G smartphones cause cancer.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  Big wireless doesn't want you to know.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  Mind control by cell phones. Scientific American.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  And then they can put over different wavelengths to actually control your brain with the carrier wave that's on it.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  Developed by the DARPA and the CIA. You might want to read that.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  Scientific American. So what's so frustrating is this is all out in the open.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  You watch Davos, they go, we're ending the family and bringing in world government.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  That's 10 years ago. I'm like, they're ending the family and bringing in world government.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  Oh, shut up. That's code word for racism.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  Continuing. Doctor says children particularly vulnerable, the dangers of 5G.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  5G danger. Hundreds of respected scientists shout the alarm about health effects of 5G networks go up nationwide.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  And that's in all these mainline publications, even cities are saying don't do it.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  Cancer, cluster, California, elementary school results in removal of Sprint cell tower.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  Even the teachers are dying.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  Now I could go on for days with all this, okay?
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  I could go on for days, but what's the point of doing that?
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  What's the point of doing that? Let's get to what the establishment's doing.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  You remember it came out with the swine flu six, seven years ago that the year before the CDC had actually put it in vaccines,
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  a quote, attenuated virus, but it would still spread.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  They were going to track flu spread with an attenuated H1N1.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  And it was worse than that.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  They admitted that it was basically a government program that they'd been running the whole time.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  And that in Germany and that in China and in the EU and in the UK all over,
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  they quote got clean vaccines for the elites that actually worked.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  And that all the vaccines the public were given had liability protection and that the companies could not get in trouble
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  and that they didn't even do what they said they do and all were doing something else, secret experiments,
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  which you've seen over and over again, radiating kids, giving black people syphilis to ski experiment.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  Thousands have admitted lethal experiments, but we just trust this eugenics scientific elite because here's what happened.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  Hitler, you may have heard of him, was advised by the Cold Springs Harbor IBM eugenics facility run by IBM
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  but funded by Congress in New York City founded in 1921.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  And the Cold Springs Harbor facility created the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and actually financed the Nazi party.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  So Hitler was following what they said.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  So at the end of World War II, eugenics was unpopular, a lot of it got shut down.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  But the scientists, the people involved in the whole thing, they just went underground into academia and into all these other walks of life.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  And that's why 36,000 Nazis were brought back into the United States via operation paperclip to help run the National Institutes of Health
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  and NASA and all these universities in DARPA because they would follow orders and do what they were told
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  and they were trained in England and the United States.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  Their professors were British and U.S. professors.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  At Nuremberg, they used the defense of Margaret Sanger and John D. Rockefeller funding them, advising them.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  They gave awards to the Rockefellers.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  They gave awards to Margaret Sanger.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  They did what they were told to do.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  The British government told the Nazis to do what they did.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  The King of England, Edward VIII, funded them.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  He was to be the king of the new EU.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  But they double-crossed the Nazis.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  This is all declassified.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  Deputy Fuhrer, Rudolf Hess, all of it, parachuting into the palace with the peace treaty, being arrested,
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  putting the tower of London till he died.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  So I'm giving you a gestalt.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  I'm giving you one-one millionth of the knowledge.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  Seriously.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  But imagine it's a lot of knowledge, isn't it?
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  So how would they release a bio-weapon and be safe from it?
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  How would they have 5G that gives you cancer or resonates with certain viruses to actually make them replicate
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  and turn off your immune system?
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  That's in major studies.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  And under Nick Beggar, Sean and others, about the hundreds of patents.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  How would they do this and get away with it?
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  Well, it turns out I've listed New Zealand and other areas.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  But when we come back, I'll finally get to all of it.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  I want to give you the precursor.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  I want to give you all the history of it, the basics and the setup.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  And a gestalt.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  Just a basic outline.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  Before I show you where they are and where they're moving to and what they're doing and how it's all hidden in plain view.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  Because I want you when they release the bio-weapon and most your family dies.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  If we're unable to stop this, I want you.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  There's always a percentage that survive it.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  I want you to know where they are so you know what to do.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  And so you know who to come after.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  Now, what we're doing right now can stop them.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  But everyone has to go.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  Wait, this is the guy that told us Trump would win.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  This is the guy.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  Hillary tweeted about me last week.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  She said, Trump is in fours now.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  Yes, Trump is in fours if he was able to operate.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  Yes, people in the Pentagon and people in the CIA are not bragging.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  They don't take orders from me.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  I don't take orders from them.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  But I'm the only person that developed a free information node to put out what's already known by the resistance in government to this eugenics plan.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  And so I am the leader.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  I don't say it to be arrogant, but at the end of the day we have to announce why they produce TV shows against me.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  Why they're constantly freaked out.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  Why they're so scared.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  I'm under total surveillance, folks.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  That's why they haven't killed me yet because so many agencies are watching.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  It's not as easy as it used to be.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  But we in the scheme of time and everything that's happened are the group and the organization that built something independent to track all of this so that we can expose what these monsters.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  Because when you see CNN host and you see these guys, most of them have been let in on this.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  They believe humanity is a cancer.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  It's got to be cold.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  They're an emergency procedure.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  That's why they call me a disease, an infection, a virus.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  And they are doing an emergency operation to save the earth from humans.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  And so they've got to all get rich and powerful and dumb us down and turn us against each other and destroy new technologies and clean technologies.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  No.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  No, the truth is they're just sabotaging things and taking over and doing evil-ass crap.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  And it was Bill Gates' father that inherited the secret army program at Cold Springs who ran Planned Parenthood and who held the main keys to the whole globalist operation.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  And the orders to Hitler.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  That's why Bill Gates was put in by IBM to be the fake so they wouldn't get busted up under antitrust.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  And that's why they hate my guts so much because I know their entire operation.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  And I'm going to blow it wide open when we come back.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  I will tell you their main armored redoubt and where they are.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  And they even offered me to three different Hollywood people at the time to move to West Virginia.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  And I didn't even know at the time what they meant when I got the offer.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  Now I know.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  I was offered 15 years ago to move to West Virginia where I'd be safe.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  Marcus here on the air.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  Thanks for holding.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  Hey, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  The approaching 2020.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  That's it.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  I agree entirely.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  The globalists are hyper competitive, scientific dictators. They are technocrats.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForestLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality Methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  It is amazing, experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American evolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA 253-3139.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget, this is the maximum alert. We wouldn't be here without you. I thank you for your support and your help.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight, but we need financial support, and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  We want to just give us straight donations. There's a PO box. We want to mail us a check. We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  We need money to fight back and to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.

[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  All right, my friends, I've set the table with the establishment running for the hills, hiding out, admitting mainstream news. They believe the end of the world's coming with some bio-weapon or some AI takeover.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  Bill Joyce says he goes to meetings with the top elite. The decision's been made to kill everyone. That was 1999 cover of Wired Magazine. Why the future doesn't need us.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  So I got told by a high-level government individual, and then I got told by a major Hollywood producer, within a month of each other, I ought to move to West Virginia.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:11.000]  And they talked about a beautiful place up in West Virginia, in a valley, and how comfortable and nice it was and how in the future I'd be safe if I just moved there and how there's a lot of great people there.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  They wanted to live with me. They wanted to have me around. And again, back then, I'm like, it's weird that they were saying West Virginia.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  Well, guess what? I went back in my memory and I checked. It's the same valley. 14,000 square miles. No technology allowed, but NASA basis.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  And it turns out they've got a couple of these in Canada, in Northern Canada, right before the Arctic Circle. They're building air bases, helicopter bases, all of it.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  I'll be showing locations in the next few weeks, but a lot of this is already in the news. And you read this 11-page New York Times article, and it's crazy.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  They claim they're hunting for aliens and the radio telescope, so there's any radio or any broadcasts or any cell phones.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  There's so much pollution, like when you're on an airplane, when you turn your cell phone off, you can mess up devices.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  But then you realize and you read and you study that all these ultra-rich people are moving into the area, and they have been for decades.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  And it's the big secret.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  So the land where the Internet ends. Green Bank, West Virginia. A few weeks ago, I drove. This is Pagan Kennedy, who's a photographer, and Damon Winter, a contributing opinion writer.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  A few weeks ago, I drove down a back road in West Virginia and into a parallel reality.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  Oh, your kids don't die of brain tumors. 50 years ago, I was unheard of for kids that have cancer, and now it's everywhere.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  I'm sorry, let me just read the article. Let's see if I can shut up.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  A few weeks ago, I drove down a back road in West Virginia into a parallel reality.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  Sometime after I passed Spruce Mountain, my phone lost service, and I knew it would be comatose for the next few days.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  When I spun the dial on the car radio static roared on every channel, I had entered the National Radio Client Zone.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  13,000 square miles of mountainous terrain with few cell towers or other transmitters.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  It goes on to say they're restricted there.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  I was headed towards Green Bank, a town that adheres to the strictest ban on technology in the United States, except for talking to the folks they're talking to.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  The residents do without not only cell phones, but also Wi-Fi, microwave ovens, which also kill you, and any other devices that generate electromagnetic signals.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  What a bunch of throwbacks there at the giant NSA NASA DARPA Command Base.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  It goes on how eclectic all these scientists and rich people are.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  The ban exists to protect the Green Bank Observatory.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  A cluster of radio telescopes, the Mountain Valley, conventional telescopes, are like super-powered eyes.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  The instrumented Green Bank are more like superhuman ears.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  They continue to frequencies from the lowest to the highest ends of the spectrum.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  The telescopes are powerful enough to detect the death rows of a star, but also terribly vulnerable to our loud world.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  I bet our DNA is too, right?
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  Even a short-circuiting electric toothbrush could blot out the whisper of a big bang.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  Uh-oh.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  Oh, something's happening with those.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  Physicists travel here to measure gravitational waves, astronomers study stardust.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  The Observatory has also become the hub for alien hunters, hope to detect messages sent from other planets.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  The point of the observatory would see they make a joke out of it.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  And in past decades, the town has become a destination for electrosensitive who believe,
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  I just showed you 100 studies, that they're allergic to cell phone towers.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  Some of them going so far as to wrap their bedrooms and mesh in hopes of screening out what they believe to be harmful rays.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  I mean, a fair day cage, that actually does that.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  Why they admit people that like live in caves live longer.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  Anyway, this town in other words calls out to many kinds of eccentrics.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  And I guess I'm one of them.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  And I did some more research on this last few days.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  There's building all this massive mansions and underground bases being built.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  I came in hopes of finding a certain kind of wildness of solitude.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  I live in Massachusetts and I often disappear into the forest and rivers to clean my head.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  I'll always love the moment when the bars on my phone disappear.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  When I'm out of range entirely, flowing along a kayak, time grows elastic.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  Yeah, you're back to being human.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  I stare down into that kingdom below me, the meadows darting through the duckweed and feel deeply free.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  No one's watching.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  No one knows where I am.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  Well, The New York Times actually has a good writer.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  And then you can, folks, I knew this was real.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  10 years ago, I've been to Big Ben 20 times probably.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  But not before all the 3G and 4G got turned on and all the allergies and health problems,
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  everything I saw with everyone I knew and the agitation and the studies.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  And I was in Big Ben for like a week with Rob Dew and his son and my son.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  And I was just like, man, I feel so good.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  Like I'm high without smoking pot, without drinking a beer.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  I'm like, God, I feel so at peace.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  Like I did when I was a kid.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  And my son and Rob Dew's son was just like, yeah, I never want to leave.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  We're only like 4,000 feet.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  Wasn't the altitude.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  We're like, there was no cell phones, no bars, no nothing, no internet.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  And that's it, man.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  It all admittedly manipulates the electrochemical neurons in your brain.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  And it's not just being outside.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  This stuff is killing us.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  And the establishment knows it and they're running away from it all over.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  Special communities are being formed and the elites are all moving in.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  It even gets into this article.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  Why we can have unlimited fiber optic with no radiation?
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  I've got the articles right here.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  Here's one.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  Scientists for wired tech, enough of the 5G wireless hype, choose FTTH, fiber to the home.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  No radiation, works much better, hundreds of times better.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  None of this crap, but it doesn't matter.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  It can't spy on you as easily.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  Anyways, when I come back, I'm going to get into this because this is 13,000 to 14,000 square miles
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  where all the establishment's moving and they've got other areas where they're doing it
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  and no cell phones are allowed under the U.S. government.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  But let me tell you, they're going to hit your ass.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  They're going to hit your ass with it.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  What do they know we don't know?
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  Stay with us.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  I just want listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars 50% off,
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  That's $2 on the toothpaste at that price.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  And we're moving a ton of it, okay?
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  But you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get $20,000.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  That doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars a product.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  I want to expand, not contract.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  And for six months, we've not just been able to stand still.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  The enemy's been winning.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  And I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  I like to be expanding.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  I like to be winning.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  I like to be fighting.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  And we are winning the info war.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  That's why we're so hated.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  But we need to be retreaded.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  We're tuned up.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  We need to be fixed up.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  We never have time to get it to dry up.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  And the enemy wants to silence us.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  Then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000]  Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the Chicombs.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:21.000]  So go to infowarstore.com.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000]  I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food.

[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  It's up to us to be self sufficient.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000]  You're buying war bonds.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000]  Bringing great products together with God's help, we are unstoppable.

[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000]  Stacy in a great state of Texas.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000]  In FEMA region six, you're on the air worldwide, Stacy.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000]  Good to talk to you.
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.000]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I trust.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.000]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them and they're often not things that are natural.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  I appreciate that.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force?
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000]  Tell us about it.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000]  Well, it's really great.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000]  I take it.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000]  It tastes good.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste that actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000]  So I really like it.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.000]  They're known to turbo charge women and then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000]  So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.000]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  Thank you.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  Thank you.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:33:03.000]  Thank you.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  Transmitting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  So thanks for joining us, Alex Jones, here back live.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  I don't have all the pieces in the puzzle, never pretended to.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  But we've proven that we are able to analyze what's happening globally.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  Now, I want to explain something.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  There is not only one power structure on this planet.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  There are at least three major geopolitical organizations and many subgroups within that.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  And most of these powerful elite groups are competing with each other but have overlapping areas of research because they believe they'll just be able to dominate and control the research once those keys to infinity are discovered.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, you see movies like in game and they have the infinity stones.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  I made the film in game blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  I talked about the keys to infinity 12 years ago.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  And you have to understand that it's not bragging, but shows like Homelander based on me where I'm this bad guy that I'm not.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  I got told by some of the sub producers on the first Captain America that where I break down these global drones that kill everybody and all the rest of it.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  That was based on what I talked about.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  And they thought, oh, this is really interesting stuff.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  Let's write movies about this.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  This is not where this is coming from.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  So if people think that I'm where they're getting the ideas for all these shows, I would be a plagiar.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  They would be plagiarists.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  This is what's really happening.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  So this is not entertainment.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  This is not stuff we're cooking up here.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  This is really what's going on now.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  They've got zones not just in this 14,000 square mile area of the New York Times it meant where no cell phones are allowed and no Wi-Fi.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  It's run by NASA.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  And you've got over 50,000 people living in the 14,000 square miles.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  And you look at the concentration of wealth moving there.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  It's staggering because the establishment is running away from the cell phones, from the cell towers and from the 5G.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  5G gives you cancer.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  I just showed you LA Times.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  I just showed you mainline studies.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  So what are they doing?
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  Why are they doing it when they have fiber optic that doesn't hurt anybody?
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  Because you can mind control people with it.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  And I just showed you Scientific American, if you just tuned in, two segments ago saying that.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  I remember DARPA in 1998 online it was in the Baltimore Sun that DARPA was testing high powered cell towers to calm the public.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  And it found that they were able to calm the public in case of riots and that they were putting in more powerful systems.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  The Doppler radars for weather control.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  I knew that 20 years ago.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  Now that's declassified.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  They make away scientific projects that are overlapping, that are building towards some larger in game, and they're going from beta test now to operational.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  And all of it kills people, but kills you slowly where you never know what hit you.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  But you've got the statistics.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  I'm going to say it again.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  But a Russell Blalox retired now.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  He's a famous brain surgeon, invented a lot of the modern terms.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  He documented 25 years ago that aspartame makes you get fatter.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  Now that's mainstream news.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  Diet soft drinks with aspartame make you fatter.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  Even World Health Organization admits that.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  They always tell you about it after you're addicted.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  And he said, Alex, when I was going through my residency in the 60s for brain surgery, for cutting tumors out, he said, professors I have would fly across the country to see a kid with a brain tumor.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  You can't swing a stick in a major city and not hit a kid with a brain tumor.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  And they knew damn well aspartame caused brain tumors.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  My point is, there's a big plan and we ain't in it.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  So the land where the internet ends.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  It's an 11 page article.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  Everybody should read it.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  It's very well written.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  New York Times.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  The national radio zone comprises 13 other things, say 15 to 14, I just say 14.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  The national radio quiet zone comprises 13,000 square miles of mountainous terrain.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  The national radio quiet zone comprises 13 miles of mountainous terrain with few cell towers or transmitters.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  Mr. McNally seemed to be of the opinion that the rest of the country out there beyond the mountains was losing its mind.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  Well, you're right, sir, it shows cell phones are making us more alone, more unhealthy, rewiring our brains, frying our brains, giving us cancer.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  Norgie Prestige, a tour guide at the observatory agreed.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  She told me she had lived in Green Bank for 17 years, happily without a cell phone.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  But just this week before, she felt it necessary to buy a basic mobile phone so she could rendezvous with friends and her son when she went outside the zone, the zone.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  See, the whole future is, are you in zone or out zone?
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  Can you afford to live out zone, outside the frying?
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  See, the establishment's not going to fry everybody and not give themselves zones, see?
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  Oh, it's wildlife research.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  Oh, the whales are bothered.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  Oh, the satellites are bothered.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  Oh, the satellite uplinks bothered.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  Oh, DARPA runs it.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  Oh, there's a bunker over here.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  Oh, a helicopter.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  Don't worry about that.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  But just this week, she felt it necessary to buy a basic mobile phone so she could rendezvous with friends and her son when she went outside the zone, the zone.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  I don't want it.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  She said the phone, but if you're going to make plans out there, you have to have it.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  Yeah, they're going to get rid of landlines.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  Monopoly just got rid of cash in the game.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  When I walk around my house, I'm silent.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  Remember that old silent feeling?
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  No TV on, no air conditioning.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  Just you hear your heart beating, you just get tied to the whole earth.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  It's magnetic field, that connection to the ancients, that stillness, that focus.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  It's all gone now, isn't it?
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  When I walk around my house, I'm silent.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  Let's see what I was out in the desert in Big Bend.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  No cell phones.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  I just felt.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  And even when I got into the towns, it was still desert, it's still mountains, but it was back.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  All that chatter, all the feeds, all the...
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  Because your ears don't hear it, but your brain hears it say it's like banging pots.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  And it breaks up your DNA, cuts it up, gives you cancer.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  That's in all the studies, but it's also a bang, bang, bang.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  Just the sound in your soul.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  Yeah, city noise might be making you sick, the Atlantic.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  I'll forget the city noise, the honking of the sirens.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  What about all the electromagnetic?
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  I don't want it, she said, of the phone, but you're going to have to make plans out there.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  You have to have it.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  When I walk around the house, I'm silent, she said.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  I think people have lost their ability to be present with themselves.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  There's nothing wrong with sitting on the deck, looking at the hills.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  I don't even have an answering machine.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  Man, I always have dreams about this last week before I read this.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  I told my wife, I said, look, it's not as bad as folks having to march into Chernobyl
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  and clean up radiation that kills you in five minutes.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  You'll die a month later, but you're dead in five minutes.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  But I said, it's still slow death for all of us.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  And I said, I can still come back to town and do stuff remotely.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  But I said, we got to get to some area that doesn't have all this.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  I know there's elite zones that don't have it, because I can't look at my kids
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  and watch them slowly dying.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  It's real.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  And the establishment's all running to these other areas, hoping we don't notice.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  I can't believe the New York Times even wrote about this.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  When I walk around my house, I'm silent, she said.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  I think most people lost the ability to be present with themselves.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  There's nothing wrong with sitting on your deck, looking at the hills.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  I don't even have an answering machine.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  And then it just goes on and on and on.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  What it's like to not have a buzzing, beeping thing controlling your life,
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  made by slaves in China, by some horrible anti-free speech demon, Tim Cook,
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  who's turned over his humanity and can care less.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  I didn't get to a lot of it. I covered a ton of it.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  I got a special report coming up that I got to tell you.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  The establishment is running from everything they've deployed against us.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  The mountains of debt, the giant third-world populations they've weaponized.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  The smart phones, the G5, the bio weapons, the leftist garbage.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  None of them give their kids iPhones. None of them do all this.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  They're running from what they're doing to us, but they'll never escape the blowback.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  I'll make sure of it.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  It's the greatest show on Earth at infowars.com for its last show.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  It's the greatest comedy show on Earth, two nights only, 20 candidates and tons of laughs.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:56.000]  June 26th and 27th, coverage starts at 7 p.m. at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  infowars, the most banned network in the world.

[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  It's the greatest show on Earth at infowars.com forward slash show.

[01:46:46.000 --> 01:47:08.000]  It's the greatest show on Earth at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:23.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  I had an entire spread of news and clips for you tonight, but I basically covered one topic.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  And that's the establishment is building armored redoubts in the US and in other areas of the world
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  that are free of the general population, but also free of 5G and that are defensible during a collapse.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  And in the last two hours, I let it all out.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  And I'm asking listeners and viewers to get that video, to get that audio,
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  and to get it out to everyone you know.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  I'm going to post it the next few hours at newswars.com and infowars.com
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  because the old cheesy GI Joe saying is really a real intelligence saying knowing is half the battle.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  And we know the globalist plan.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  Most people in government aren't bad.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  Most people in corporations aren't bad, but the psychopathic elites are so evil
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  that we have a blind spot and can't believe what they're doing.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  I was just talking to Justin, one of the great crew members.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  He's like, I'm like, listen, we exposed their redoubts.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  We exposed what they're running to.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  They're going to be afraid to go ahead and turn the heat up.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  He goes, no, let's just turn it up faster.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  They're just making money off of us right now while they kill us.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  Yeah, but that money is symbols of energy, and that's how they're sucking our energy out of us.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  It's not going to go forever.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  We're living in epic times.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  They've got big plans for us, but humanity is not going to go along.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  So we just laid out the incredible real secrets of 5G that nobody else has laid out.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  The last hour and a half that we've covered is legendary intel.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  I'm telling you, I don't usually say that's legendary intel.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  That is as close as you're going to get to the truth as there is.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  Because even the establishment are mad scientists.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  They're not exactly sure what they're doing.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  They're just testing and have a grand plan.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  We can change that plan by our actions.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  All right, I'm going to go to this very special report by John Bowne.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  The case against the reparations guilt circus cult, which is absolutely paramount
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  and shows how they're trying to re-institute slavery,
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  and the idea that if somebody that you're related who did something wrong, you're guilty.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  It's just the end of due process, the end of common law, the end of everything.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  It's amazing.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  And I'll be back tomorrow live at Lebanon Central, but please don't forget,
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  we're running a huge special right now, one of the biggest ever,
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  store-wide free shipping, 50% off all the great supplements,
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  and double patriot points, the save info wars emergency special.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  You've seen all the attacks, you've seen the attempts to take us off air.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  Without you supporting us, we will not be here.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  So whether it's amazing X2 that's so good for the body,
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  find out about the purest form of iodine out there,
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  or whether it's the great sleep aid knockout,
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  or whether it's the eight pack power stack,
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  or our great super blue fluoride free toothpaste fortified with iodine and little silver,
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  whether it's the real Red Pill Plus, all these great products.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  We've got the best turmeric out there.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  They fund the operation.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  They make it all possible.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  We're making history together.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  So thank you for the support.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  Please take action.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  Without you, we're not here.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  Plus, these are great products.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  You already need a 361 infowarstore.com.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  Here's John Bowles report.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  42 million African Americans for reparations of the descendants of slaves,
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  which by some estimates could total roughly 105 billion a year,
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  15% of the U.S. National Defense budget.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  Representative Sheila Jackson Lee,
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  who has been a member of Congress since 1995
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  and a leader behind the reparations legislation,
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  forgot what it took one good American to point out.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  HR 40 is in fact the response of the United States of America long overdue.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  Slavery is the original sin.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  Slavery has never received an apology.
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  In 2008, the House of Representatives formally apologized for slavery in Jim Crow.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  In 2009, the Senate did the same.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  And what if reparations fails?
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  Does this embolden the lunatics on the left and their leading candidate Joe Biden's call for a physical revolution?
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  Let's start a real physical revolution if you're talking about it.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  And by a physical revolution, he is alluding to a race war that the Democratic Party would ignite.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  What are the 9 million mixed race Americans supposed to do?
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  Stay home and fight themselves?
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  What about the exemptions?
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  I'm a direct descendant of abolitionists who settled in Flushing, New York in the 17th century
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  who assisted with the Underground Railroad.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  Is my family exempt?
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  What about the descendants of the 360,000 Union soldiers that died fighting for the Emancipation Proclamation?
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  Are they exempt?
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  And what about all the white people who immigrated long after slavery in the Civil War ended?
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  Are they exempt too?
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  The real issue with reparations?
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  Well, they generally pay out to living survivors.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  In 1988, the United States paid one and a half billion dollars in reparations to the survivors of Japanese internment during World War II.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  While Germany has paid 89 billion to the victims of the Holocaust,
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  will those survivors be paying reparations to the ancestors of those promised 40 acres and a mule by Union General Sherman
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  that was interrupted after impeached Democratic President Andrew Johnson reversed the Freedmen's Bureau process
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  that had already awarded 40,000 freed slaves, 400,000 acres of coastal land in South Carolina and Georgia?
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  The federal government under a Democratic executive office turned around and took that land by force.
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  Unfortunately, that was the perfect window for reparations because there were plenty of survivors, not 42 million people.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  Nothing I'm about to say is meant to minimize the horror and brutality of slavery and Jim Crow.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  Racism is a bloody stain on this country's history, and I consider our failure to pay reparations directly to freed slaves after the Civil War
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  to be one of the greatest injustices ever perpetrated by the U.S. government.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  But I worry that our desire to fix the past compromises our ability to fix the present.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  Think about what we're doing today.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  We're spending our time debating a bill that mentions slavery 25 times, but incarceration only once,
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  in an era with no black slaves, but nearly a million black prisoners.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  The history of our black country, of our black Americans, has been stolen from us for decades, almost over a century.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  Bookity Washington, 1880-82, began Tuskegee University by 1905.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  It was producing more self-made black millionaires than Harvard, Yale, and Princeton combined.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  The 40s, 50s, and 60s, it was a black community that led our country in the growth of the middle class,
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  led our country in terms of men committed to marriage over 70 percent, now it's 30 percent.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  Led our country in terms of the commitment to business ownership, 40 percent, now it's 3.8 percent.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  Are we going to base serious policy on white guilt, even if no taxpayer alive today is responsible for slavery?
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  And does that mean my soul needs to be forgiven, Reverend?
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  And when I'm talking for reparations, I'm talking about those left behind,
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  but I'm actually talking to my white brothers and sisters.
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  You need this more than we do.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  You need this for your soul.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  A testimony about the fact that we're fighting for the heart of our nation.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  I think everybody in this room, as part of the American family, understands that.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  We see it different ways. Here's the question.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  And then frankly, when I hear from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle,
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  that we need to be encouraged to work harder, to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps,
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  that we can actually achieve that that's the only thing that's the problem.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  This is just how inept the Democrats are with the leadership of this nation
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  and how dangerous reparations are to this republic.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  You want reparations? Then why not start with the ancestors of the southern Democrats
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  that form the Confederacy and the KKK?
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  KKK, that's not a democratic party, by the way.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  They lynched 4,700 people. 1,500 of them were white Republicans.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  Or those responsible for the mortgage-lending scams that targeted black Americans in the 1960s and 1970s.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  Or those responsible for overseeing the crack epidemic that put millions of black Americans in prison during the 1980s.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  Or those Democrats today who lord over their blue districts where poverty is increasing
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  and education of our unifying principles are dying.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  Let's point to the party that was part of slavery, KKK Jim Crow,
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  that has killed over 40% of our black babies, 20 million of them.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  But aside from reasonably helping our fellow Americans whatever race or races they may be,
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  you can't blame millions of innocent people for slavery.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  It is the Democrats that must search their souls.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  Bottom line, Democrats, you opened up this can of worms.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  And in the end, it is your history that has doomed reparations for slavery
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  and caused us to all see the truth that it was the Democrats
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  who fought tooth and nail to keep reparations from legitimately happening all along.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  John Baum reporting.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.000]  We make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price.
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  And we're moving a ton of it, okay?
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000]  But you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get $20,000.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  That doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  I want to expand, not contract.
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  And for six months, we've not been able to stand still.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  The enemy's been winning.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  And I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  I like to be expanding, I like to be winning.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  I like to be fighting.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  And we are winning the M-Full War.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000]  That's why we're so hated.
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  But we need to be retreaded.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  We need to be tuned up.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000]  We need to be fixed up.
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  We never have time to get it to dry out.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  And the enemy wants to silence us.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  Then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  funded by foreign banks in the Chai Comm.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.000]  So go to M-FullWarStore.com.
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:50.000]  We'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000]  We're going into the season of war.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.000]  And they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000]  through their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.000]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:03.000]  We need to end here.
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000]  We need to be provisioned.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.000]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.000]  against the enemy fearlessly.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.000]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  That just brings more people here.
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  And I need war bonds.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000]  I need gas.
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  I need ammo politically now.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.000]  But literally, if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000]  and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  We're unstoppable together.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.000]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000]  that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us.
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000]  And I will never back down.
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  You have my commitment.
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.000]  and that we were right about this.
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:53.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
