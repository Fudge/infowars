[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.000 --> 00:20.000]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:20.000 --> 00:33.000]  Our information war, it's Alex Jones. Hard to believe it's already August 30th, 2017 on this Wednesday
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.000]  global edition. We're going to have our intrepid reporter who's just spent three days down there
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.000]  on the alligators and the fish, women through the houses and with the rest of our team
[00:44.000 --> 00:52.000]  rescuing more than 40 people out of their submerged houses yesterday. That's why we didn't have
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  Michael Zimmerman on yesterday and many videos didn't get uploaded because he had to abandon that
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  just to help save the people. It is a catastrophe. Houston Mayor orders curfew to prevent mass looting.
[01:03.000 --> 01:10.000]  Warns, bridges and roads are starting to fail. You tie that together with hell freezing over.
[01:10.000 --> 01:20.000]  Berkeley police arrest 13 protesters in connection to antifa vicious fascist attacks on peaceful prayer vigil.
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  As long as they scream Nazi, it was okay to hit folks in the head with clubs and bike locks.
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  And Pelosi's had to come out because they realized this is hurting them bad with their focus groups.
[01:29.000 --> 01:37.000]  Their little revolution has blown up in their face. Thank God Trump pointed out that antifa was worse than the Nazis
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  because the white supremacists weren't actually attacking people first. Then it escalated.
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  It was horrible what happened. Both sides are bad, but the people that attacked first are the bad guys.
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.000]  You're allowed to be a moron Nazi in America. You're allowed to be a moron Mexican racist or black racist,
[01:53.000 --> 02:01.000]  but you're not allowed to just beat up whoever you want because they've got a bald head, so they must be a Nazi.
[02:01.000 --> 02:07.000]  All that said, it is total information overload.
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.000]  As sick left to celebrate hurricane as a victory over conservative white Americans.
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  Big story from Dan Lyman chronicling it on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  For TV viewers, we'll go over some of that coming up, but here is the big news.
[02:22.000 --> 02:30.000]  So big that I'm mad at myself that I haven't been following this more than the last few weeks because I want it to go away.
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.000]  And I'm not the type of person that ignores something. I'm not the type of person that sweeps stuff under the rug,
[02:36.000 --> 02:52.000]  but I realize I psychoanalyzed myself and realized that this is so out of our hands to a great extent that I catch myself doing the ostrich head in the sand situation.
[02:52.000 --> 03:01.000]  Ostriches don't really do that. They stick their head in the sand to turn their eggs once a day, but regardless, because what do you do?
[03:01.000 --> 03:09.000]  We're still at war with Korea since 1953 and the ceasefire armistice, and they've been firing all these missiles over Japan.
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  Trump said if you fire them at Guam, near Guam, we're going to attack you, so they backed off there,
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.000]  but now they've come back saying we're going to go ahead and fire missiles off towards Guam, Alaska, you name it, get ready.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  And our military and our president will be forced to respond.
[03:25.000 --> 03:34.000]  So again, the nightmare of another addled, potbellied, weakling communist, Kim Jong-un threatens all of the earth.
[03:34.000 --> 03:42.000]  And here's the big news. Russia orders mass evacuation out of the east of Russia.
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.000]  They've never done that over North Korea missile launch, and that tells you back channels.
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  They told the Russians, we're going in, we're going to use nuclear weapons to take everything out.
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  Because believe me, you can't hit North Korea and not hit them with nuclear weapons.
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.000]  They've got 100,000 pieces of artillery. They've got tens of thousands of rockets already loaded.
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  They've got nerve gas, they've got everything, and they've got a little demonic goblin running their country.
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  So if he's going to do this and he's gone completely megalomaniac, you've got to preemptively hit him,
[04:14.000 --> 04:20.000]  you've got to wipe out the entire DMZ and their main cities, or they'll have retaliatory power.
[04:20.000 --> 04:28.000]  And if China doesn't stand down and Russia doesn't stand down, we go to WW3, thermal nuclear, just like that.
[04:28.000 --> 04:36.000]  Russia orders mass evacuation over North Korea missile launch.
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.000]  Trump on North Korea, all options are on the table.
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.000]  North Korea threatens a more ballistic test over Japan. That's Mikhail Thalin in FullWars.com.
[04:45.000 --> 04:50.000]  The others, the HILD. Here's a Paul Joseph Watson article. You might want to read it at newswars.com.
[04:50.000 --> 04:58.000]  Top forecaster prediction, U.S. confrontation with North Korea by September 12th. That means war.
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO, early on in the seeds, great books, great films,
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  great patriot apparel to meet like-minded people, and we've got a new humongoid sale.
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  Not a number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months. We've never offered super male vitality,
[05:21.000 --> 05:26.000]  known concentrated herbs, cold pressed, super male vitality, 57% off.
[05:26.000 --> 05:32.000]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total,
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.000]  by third party sites, unprecedented, and it's cold pressed. That's why super male is so different.
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science,
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  these are what you sell, they, BuzzFeed said, it's like, it's already best selling stuff.
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  It's been certified as healthy and good forever. Why, these aren't anything new.
[05:47.000 --> 05:51.000]  Why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold pressed?
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  Do. Do.
[05:58.000 --> 06:03.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[06:03.000 --> 06:08.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that
[06:08.000 --> 06:13.000]  the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors,
[06:13.000 --> 06:16.000]  in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[06:16.000 --> 06:22.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing,
[06:22.000 --> 06:28.000]  and then processing. And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth
[06:28.000 --> 06:34.000]  from chicken, but seven other super food ingredients known for cleansing
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  and super charging the body at the same time.

[08:17.000 --> 08:22.000]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty.
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[08:26.000 --> 08:37.000]  Generals gathered in their masses, just like witches at black masses.
[08:37.000 --> 08:48.000]  We take it for granted that millions of Koreans and tens of thousands of U.S. troops died, as well as hundreds of thousands of Chinese,
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  in the Korean War that is still on.
[08:51.000 --> 09:04.000]  Armistice signed July 27, 1953, and 60-plus years later, we sit here on the verge of that ceasefire ending.
[09:04.000 --> 09:15.000]  Two weeks ago, North Korea said they were going to fire missiles between 10-20 miles off the coast of Guam and our air force base there.
[09:15.000 --> 09:23.000]  Trump signaled that if he did do that, we would have retaliatory strikes on North Korea.
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  Kim Jong-un blinked and did not carry out the test.
[09:28.000 --> 09:39.000]  Instead, he started firing multiple missiles overnight, yesterday and today, at Japan, going right over the country and crashing in the ocean.
[09:39.000 --> 09:48.000]  Normally, he fires them in front of the country, but not over the country, which is absolutely provocation for war.
[09:48.000 --> 09:56.000]  The United States started firing missiles over the territory of North Korea at a very low trajectory and crashing them into the ocean.
[09:56.000 --> 09:59.000]  We started doing that to Russia, or Russia did that to us.
[09:59.000 --> 10:07.000]  Imagine if Russia pulled up ships off the coast of Florida and fired a missile over Florida, over the peninsula, from the east, from the Atlantic Ocean,
[10:07.000 --> 10:14.000]  and then it plunged into the Gulf of Mexico, say, in Tampa, right off the shore.
[10:14.000 --> 10:20.000]  Would that be an act of war? Very serious provocation.
[10:20.000 --> 10:28.000]  And Russia, according to the Russian news, has ordered mass evacuation over North Korea missile launch.
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  The Daily Star is reporting, former UK diplomat, world is much less safe due to North Korea threat.
[10:33.000 --> 10:42.000]  Russia's civil defense officials have reportedly ordered to shift residents in the country's far east to safer areas and extraordinary movement fears of worldwide conflict.
[10:42.000 --> 10:50.000]  North Korea angered the international community by launching a missile that flew directly over Japan.
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  It's not like they shot it up into space and it came back down. They shot it right over.
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  You know, a missile you could see with the naked eyeball, with a missile trail.
[11:00.000 --> 11:06.000]  That's like in a western, you know, the guy walks up and starts shooting the gun by your feet saying, come on, pull, draw, do something, boy.
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.000]  North Korea angered the international community by launching the missile that flew directly over Japan and says they're going to fire more.
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  They've been firing others as well the last few days, but not over Japan.
[11:16.000 --> 11:24.000]  In response, US President Donald Trump threatened to the communist state with military action, warning all options are on the table.
[11:24.000 --> 11:37.000]  As the Trump reeled from the provocative test, thousands of people from the city of Vlad Alaska, if I'm pronouncing that right, were moved as part of an emergency operation.
[11:37.000 --> 11:47.000]  Russian President Vladimir Putin fears the US may wage war against the secretive state that Trump threatened to unleash fire and fury should it fire more missiles.
[11:47.000 --> 12:01.000]  And then you can go back up everything that they're reporting here in other mainline reports I have reporting on each section of this overall boil down article that's linked at newswars.com and infowars.com.
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.000]  Trump on North Korea, the hill, all options are on the table. Let's go more into his statement.
[12:07.000 --> 12:17.000]  President Trump said early Tuesday now it's Wednesday that all options are on the table of North Korea fired a missile that flew over Japanese airspace.
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  Trump said in a statement the world has received North Korea's latest message loud and clear.
[12:22.000 --> 12:31.000]  The regime has signaled its contempt for its neighbors for all members of the United Nations and for minimum standards of acceptable international behavior.
[12:31.000 --> 12:40.000]  Trump said threatening and destabilizing actions only increase North Korea's regime's isolation in the region and are among all nations of the world and all options are on the table.
[12:40.000 --> 12:47.000]  His comments come after the Pentagon confirmed late Monday that North Korea fired a missile that flew over Japan's airspace.
[12:47.000 --> 13:08.000]  But you wouldn't know any of this was going on and that today Russia announced an evacuation of major cities in the east of Russia had a possible nuclear war because all we're hearing is first lady on her way to Air Force One was wearing high heels.
[13:08.000 --> 13:21.000]  You know they've had major directors come out and say that Wonder Woman is a step back because it shows a woman looking good using her body to be impressive as if men don't do that as well.
[13:21.000 --> 13:32.000]  And it's the same thing. See they hate Melania because she's projecting the feminine power one large aspect of it. She also has smarts and they can't stand it.
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  There she is up on the pedestal with the high heels. Now later she gets off the plane not wearing them.
[13:37.000 --> 13:54.000]  The point is that the top story yesterday wasn't the bridges failing and the roads beginning to fail and the looting and the dead police officers and the craziest coastal natural disaster in history.
[13:54.000 --> 14:05.000]  The costliest divided USA embraces as the flood brings us together.
[14:05.000 --> 14:15.000]  I'm looking at drudgereport.com right now but look GDP up jobs up but you wouldn't even know that in mainstream media.
[14:15.000 --> 14:33.000]  Whenever Eric Trump tried to tweet a drudge link to CNBC a month ago or three weeks ago about great job numbers they blocked it and said this is this violates our terms of service inappropriate or hateful.
[14:33.000 --> 14:43.000]  Because the truth is hateful you need to stall the economy as much as possible to make Trump fail. The big banks came out and said the economy is going to go down last week.
[14:43.000 --> 14:52.000]  The fellow reserve said it's going to go down last week. That everything they could to drive down the economy.
[14:52.000 --> 15:06.000]  But now since they're failing they just get more angry and Kathy Griffin climbs out from underneath the rock to get more publicity and she says she's no longer sorry for decapitated Trump photo to get more attention.
[15:06.000 --> 15:22.000]  I guess we knew you were never sorry and then it's a directive of the globalist to try to start a race war class war in this country by you the elites trying to destroy the middle class and complete their journey to total financial impoverishment and surf them.
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.000]  You want your slaves this arm you want them controlled.
[15:27.000 --> 15:37.000]  But as the left prepares their civil unrest they want to back away from the wind up toy of antifa drooling methods that they've created.
[15:37.000 --> 15:51.000]  Fearing antifa mayhem Berkeley mayor wants free speech week canceled for UC conservatives. That's right you as conservatives period cannot have free speech because of the antifa.
[15:51.000 --> 16:02.000]  Just like they bring in the Islamist they cause the big crisis. They're not compatible with our free way of life or open society and then we have to get rid of our open society because of them.
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  That's in the WikiLeaks. That is the plan.
[16:06.000 --> 16:19.000]  And then if somebody fights back against these people when they're clubbing them in the head or killing somebody and one of the antifa gets killed they will give them royal honors like Jesus Christ was hung on the cross again.
[16:19.000 --> 16:29.000]  But again they're having to distance themselves now ahead of the edicts banning free speech that oh they are against the evil method antifa.
[16:29.000 --> 16:42.000]  Berkeley police arrest 13 protesters in connection to antifa violence the spitting the clubbing the attacking the bike locks the cowardly hordes of women.
[16:42.000 --> 16:56.000]  Ganging up and stomping and kicking on men who dared go to a prayer meeting drenched in spit as they hawk loogies on them and howl and scream.
[16:56.000 --> 17:07.000]  Just a bunch of gang thugs trace some of these mug shots that just want to go out and beat the daylights out of people.
[17:07.000 --> 17:15.000]  Real Nair duels Nancy Pelosi finally condemns antifa for Berkeley violence.
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.000]  Oh after she said oh I'm glad they did that over the weekend she said they're fighting Nazis.
[17:21.000 --> 17:30.000]  The problem was a lot of the Nazis that would be black and Hispanic they were attacking not just white who she's dehumanized as part of her rearguard action.
[17:30.000 --> 17:46.000]  Valstow and Luke she's gotten to get us all fighting with each other so they don't know what to do because the Internet has thousands of videos some of them millions and millions of views apiece much more powerful coverage than mainstream media and people are seeing the horror of the living dead.
[17:46.000 --> 18:03.000]  Men in dress is running around beating up women and men who don't even defend themselves it's just the image of the decadence of the insanity.
[18:03.000 --> 18:27.000]  Berkeley mayor we should classify antifa as a gang so the big news is the left turns on the antifa at least on the surface because they know they've got their left is preparing some false flags and the globalists know they're getting ready to launch some false flags against different liberal associated installations to blame on
[18:27.000 --> 18:36.000]  Trump and the liberty movement in a giant operation to bring in civil unrest.
[18:36.000 --> 18:52.000]  So that's just some of the news that we're going to be getting into more details on today but don't worry about North Korea threatening to attack your neighbors or launch nuclear weapons at Japan or soul South Korea or the US don't worry about Russia evacuating its major eastern cities.
[18:52.000 --> 19:04.000]  Because the word is that Trump has green lighted nuclear strikes on North Korea if need be to remove the threat and Russia has been consulted on that.
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  Never mind all that.
[19:06.000 --> 19:12.000]  We need to have the Democrats say that Trump mentioned the crowd size while touring Texas.
[19:12.000 --> 19:22.000]  He said look at this great crowd of people out here to help look how wonderful you are out here taking action all these great people out here.
[19:22.000 --> 19:29.000]  Having some solidarity thanking the locals and they turn that into oh he's bragging and he has a big crowd.
[19:29.000 --> 19:41.000]  Well that's right you couldn't get anybody out to protest him really and Phoenix so you pointed cameras at the bikers for Trump and had the headline everywhere that was bikers against Trump.
[19:41.000 --> 19:51.000]  CNN reporter Trump showed very little empathy to Harvey victims because he was solemn most of the time but then when he acted excited that was wrong too.
[19:51.000 --> 19:58.000]  Meanwhile we're on the edge of World War 3 and Antifa is celebrating Texas hit by Harvey.
[19:58.000 --> 20:12.000]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.

[24:32.000 --> 24:33.000]  Thank you.
[24:33.000 --> 24:57.000]  Thank you and CNN played that exact clip and then criticized the president.
[24:57.000 --> 25:04.000]  And I don't even know if I should play some of these demon demonization clubs because CNN is so discredited.
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  There's such a joke.
[25:05.000 --> 25:10.000]  They're so sick that why should we even give them attention at this point?
[25:10.000 --> 25:18.000]  CNN reporter Trump showed very little empathy to Harvey victims as though he was coming to a small campaign rally of sorts.
[25:18.000 --> 25:21.000]  They say this from their air conditioned offices.
[25:21.000 --> 25:35.000]  When everybody, the locals, the sheriff's departments, the emergency management, the state have said that homeland security, FEMA, everything under Trump's direction has never been anywhere close to this responsive.
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.000]  It's been called completely and totally responsive by the governor.
[25:39.000 --> 25:52.000]  And this is the biggest hurricane flooding disaster in US history.
[25:52.000 --> 25:53.000]  People in Brazil don't act like this.
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.000]  People in China don't act like this.
[25:54.000 --> 25:55.000]  People in Russia.
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.000]  People in Europe.
[25:56.000 --> 26:11.000]  We have a spoiled rotten media and their spoiled rotten constituents who are like day of the dead methods on one end or arrogant want to be know it all academics that just cuss and scream and yell and hate America.
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  Owen Troyer has gone out twice in the last two weeks in Austin.
[26:16.000 --> 26:26.000]  And last night after the kids went to bed at like 10 at night, I spent an hour and a half just watching the footage he shot unedited yesterday.
[26:26.000 --> 26:39.000]  Over an hour of it, he just uploaded it in 20 minute chunks last night with people screaming and cussing at him and saying the most horrible things and then not even able to even finish sentences.
[26:39.000 --> 26:46.000]  And then they tell him we're UT professors or we're this and then they're like, you know, F Ben Carson, he's not black.
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.000]  The footage is on info wars.com with the headline shock video.
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  Alt left says Ben Carson, not black.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  And then she says he's retarded.
[26:59.000 --> 27:09.000]  See any black person that supports Trump, even though he put himself through school as an admitted top brain surgeon, which is about the hardest job there is.
[27:09.000 --> 27:16.000]  He's done brain surgeries that nobody else has survived from removing kids heads that are together with the brains are grown together and the kids are fine today.
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  But no, he has no accomplishments because you know, he supports Trump.
[27:19.000 --> 27:20.000]  He supports free market.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  He is an Uncle Tom loser according to them.
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  These people are just sick.
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  And it goes on and on the footage.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  There's hours of it.
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.000]  It's close to two hours of it on our YouTube channel.
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000]  And then I sat there sort of watching footage from California of the same stuff.
[27:39.000 --> 27:48.000]  And McBrain show me the same clip this morning that I sat to see last night where they're talking to this guy and he goes, yeah, Trump's a Russian and he's going to go down for being a Russian.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  And the reporter goes.
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  The independent reporter goes.
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  But sir, they've already dropped the Russian state.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  He goes, well, that's because we're on the race thing right now.
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.000]  We're going to go back to that.
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.000]  Even the guys on the street have talking points.
[28:04.000 --> 28:14.000]  Just like I told you three months ago, Roger Stone was talking to high level folks that were in editorial meetings at major newspapers.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  And they were saying, we're going to do the Russian narrative.
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  We know it's not real.
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  Well, you saw Van Jones and others on tape on hidden cameras.
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  And they know it's all fake.
[28:22.000 --> 28:29.000]  They're going to push that and then hopefully find a bounce check or somebody didn't tell the FBI the exact right thing and then get them that way.
[28:29.000 --> 28:37.000]  And now it was in the news yesterday that that's what Mueller wants to do is try to indict Donald Trump Jr.
[28:37.000 --> 28:46.000]  And then go after Donald Trump claiming he covered up some Russia meeting where Donald Trump Jr. met with a lady for 10 minutes to try to get dirt on Hillary.
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  That's your job to meet with people to get dirt on Hillary.
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  They were doing the same thing in Russia to Trump.
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  They couldn't find anything.
[28:53.000 --> 28:59.000]  Does that make the DNC investigators, Russian agents, because they went to Russia and went to England and went to Germany?
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.000]  No.
[29:00.000 --> 29:01.000]  But it doesn't matter.
[29:01.000 --> 29:07.000]  The guy admits on tape, hey, we're just got talking points, bro, to bring Trump down.
[29:07.000 --> 29:10.000]  And all these people pretend they're part of the establishment.
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  A lot of the people are astroturf.
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  They get paid a couple hundred bucks a day to go out and do this.
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.000]  Sometimes more to be violent agitators, $1,200 a day.
[29:17.000 --> 29:20.000]  That's been in the WikiLeaks, other documents.
[29:20.000 --> 29:25.000]  But most of them are just there because they think it's a cool thing to do and they're like in an end crowd.
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.000]  These people are so uncool and so dumb.
[29:28.000 --> 29:41.000]  They think MSNBC and CNN has their best interest in heart and they're really cool out there screaming Nazi, Nazi, Nazi and beating up people at prayer meetings with bite locks until they have to have brain surgery.
[29:41.000 --> 29:44.000]  We'll be right back with the latest on Harvey.
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.000]  It's, it's deteriorating quickly.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  We're on the march.
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:51.000 --> 29:55.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:03.000 --> 30:10.000]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[30:10.000 --> 30:16.000]  And we've got a new humongoid sale, not a number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[30:16.000 --> 30:19.000]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[30:19.000 --> 30:26.000]  We've never offered super male vitality, no concentrated herbs, cold pressed, super male vitality, 57% off.
[30:26.000 --> 30:28.000]  It's never been the price.
[30:28.000 --> 30:34.000]  It is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third party sites, unprecedented.
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  And it's cold pressed.
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.000]  That's why super male is so different.
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science.
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  These are other what you sell.
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  Buzzfeed said it's like it's already best selling stuff.
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  It's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[30:46.000 --> 30:47.000]  Why these aren't anything new?
[30:47.000 --> 30:51.000]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best but cold pressed?
[30:51.000 --> 30:52.000]  Do.
[30:52.000 --> 30:53.000]  Do.
[30:59.000 --> 31:01.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[31:01.000 --> 31:03.000]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:03.000 --> 31:06.000]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:06.000 --> 31:12.000]  Artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:12.000 --> 31:18.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems
[31:18.000 --> 31:21.000]  have now developed Alexa pure breeze.
[31:21.000 --> 31:26.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children.

[31:28.000 --> 31:36.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[31:36.000 --> 31:38.000]  The general public doesn't.
[31:38.000 --> 31:42.000]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:42.000 --> 31:46.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:46.000 --> 31:53.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[33:21.000 --> 33:40.000]  The chief vampire squid, the master pound for pound biggest face sucker, the globalist cancer, Goldman Sachs, has been waging war against President Trump.
[33:40.000 --> 33:42.000]  And they admit they have.
[33:42.000 --> 33:55.000]  Come out in their emails, come out in their statements, come out and Lloyd Blank finds tweets as he ridicules Trump's attempt to defibrillate the American economy.
[33:55.000 --> 33:58.000]  But despite all of that, we are back on our feet.
[33:58.000 --> 34:06.000]  The globalist left their throngs of mindless slaves or cheering the Gulf of Houston.
[34:06.000 --> 34:13.000]  They've got the Black Lives Matter folks out on Twitter showing the looting they're involved in, bragging about how they're attacking white people.
[34:13.000 --> 34:18.000]  But the majority of folks have come together and are helping each other, and it's a beautiful thing to see.
[34:18.000 --> 34:24.000]  But it just boggles my mind to see how incredibly nasty the left is.
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  The footage is on infowars.com.
[34:26.000 --> 34:33.000]  Owen Shroyer, our great reporter and talk show host, will be joining us coming out in the middle of the next hour to play some of these videos.
[34:33.000 --> 34:41.000]  It's really hard on the crew because the bleeping, because every other word is an expletive would left us.
[34:41.000 --> 34:47.000]  Who are really just, before you'd kind of call them trash.
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  Grabbing any big city, you see trash of all colors.
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.000]  White trash, black trash, just trashy method types.
[34:54.000 --> 35:00.000]  And you see folks hanging around, you know, outside halfway houses or hanging around, you know, whatever.
[35:00.000 --> 35:05.000]  And you can even see a normal homeless person versus a mentally ill one versus like a little criminal demon one.
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  You go, man, why do those people look like demons?
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  Why do they always look crazy?
[35:11.000 --> 35:20.000]  Even the ones that call themselves UT professors just look like they're whacked out and have chips on their shoulders and snort methamphetamine five or six times a day.
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  What's wrong with them?
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  Well, they're fundamentally losers.
[35:24.000 --> 35:32.000]  They're hateful people and they want to hate somebody and they hate anybody else's success and they hate light in your eyes.
[35:32.000 --> 35:40.000]  They get off on taking Christian children and giving them to Muslim foster homes and ripping crosses off their necks and putting burkas on their head.
[35:40.000 --> 35:47.000]  They get off on pushing down prayer vigil people and 20 women kicking them and hitting them and spitting on until they're covered in spit.
[35:47.000 --> 35:54.000]  They get off on cussing at people and telling them that they're Nazis because they want power.
[35:54.000 --> 36:03.000]  They want control, but they don't want the responsibility.
[36:03.000 --> 36:12.000]  So we'll play some of those videos and go over the good, the bad, the ugly, the moronic, the just plain sad to know what we're facing because we're not cherry picking these people.
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  You go to a Democrat event, you go to a anti-Trump event.
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  I mean, it is like a day of the dead convention.
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.000]  You got to ask yourselves, what happened to these people?
[36:25.000 --> 36:35.000]  Well, statistically, they're six times more likely to steal, nine times less likely to get a charity, 14 times more often telling you all the great things they did.
[36:35.000 --> 36:48.000]  You know, not only did Quentin and Michael go down there and pull more than 50 people out of their houses, people that couldn't get out, families.
[36:48.000 --> 36:56.000]  They then wouldn't even shoot video of it because, well, that would be immoral to almost even show we were doing it.
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.000]  And then, well, we're not going to talk about what we did.
[37:01.000 --> 37:08.000]  Now, see, there's the opposite of a conservative or libertarian, which I think we should show how virtuous libertarians and conservatives are.
[37:08.000 --> 37:14.000]  All the statistics from the UK, the EU, Canada, all the universities have basically the same numbers.
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.000]  Don't believe me and just type in to mainstream news, search engine, they even admit it.
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  Liberal's more likely to steal, less likely to give.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  And you'll get the numbers.
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  Some statistics are even higher.
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  I've seen numbers where they're 20 something times more likely to steal.
[37:29.000 --> 37:38.000]  These are bad people that know you're good and like the racist homophobe, rich person.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  And they know you've got morals.
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  So if someone's guilting you, well, maybe you did something and you introspectively look in because you have a conscience that they don't have.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  And they're like sitting there like Grimer Wormtongue.
[37:49.000 --> 37:59.000]  No, is it working on them? Ah, good. They're con artists, they're frauds and they know it.
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  It's their power.
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.000]  On time about three years ago, I've told the story many times when we get back on the news.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  I was staying at some friends house that have a lake house.
[38:12.000 --> 38:21.000]  And my son and I got up at about 7am and went down and we're fishing on a community dock in the little homeowners association.
[38:21.000 --> 38:28.000]  There's a very small homeowners association there, but this woman walks up and I think she must recognize who it was.
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  I'm sitting there putting a worm on the hook.
[38:30.000 --> 38:36.000]  We've caught some perch and bass. We're just playing around, drinking coffee.
[38:36.000 --> 38:47.000]  My son's sitting there catching fish and she's just going, we're here from the University of Texas staying with friends and we're going to have the main gypsy leader here today.
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  You don't have a problem with that, do you?
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.000]  I'm like, the main gypsy leader? I go, what? Is it Iris Pikes or is it Romanoff's?
[38:53.000 --> 38:54.000]  And she's like, aroma.
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  And she goes, oh, you know about them.
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  Oh, you have them, those wonderful people on earth.
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  And I'm just like, okay, it was like some weird, like worship the gypsies thing.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  I'm like, okay, yeah, great. Thank you.
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  I'm not being nice to her.
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.000]  And then all of a sudden she's like, she's talking to my son who's like 14 now.
[39:13.000 --> 39:14.000]  He was like 10 years old.
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  She goes, what happened to the side of your head?
[39:16.000 --> 39:17.000]  Did someone hit you?
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  And she looks at me and I'm used to liberal mental illness.
[39:21.000 --> 39:24.000]  I'm just ignoring her and there's this big doc.
[39:24.000 --> 39:33.000]  I mean, there's like 40 feet across the front, sticks out about another 60 feet.
[39:33.000 --> 39:37.000]  So she's over here where we are in our business.
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  And she wasn't a half bad looking woman.
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.000]  And my son goes, no, that's my birthmark.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  He's got a little red birthmark on the side of his head.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  You guys have seen him on TV.
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  A little stork bite as they call it in Germany.
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.000]  And she goes, oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything.
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.000]  I'm just, just, just, and it went on and on and on and on.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  And I didn't even get in the rest of the story.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  We're over there barbecuing that night.
[40:03.000 --> 40:10.000]  And then she and a bunch of liberal professors and the gypsy show up over at our friend's house where we're cooking.
[40:10.000 --> 40:17.000]  And it was just like an assault of, of, of liberal crud and just seeing if they could mess with us.
[40:17.000 --> 40:22.000]  And that's all they are is a cult of creeps.
[40:22.000 --> 40:29.000]  And they went and found historically the most creepy people they could that are a gang system that's designed to feed on people,
[40:29.000 --> 40:35.000]  whether it's the folks from Eastern Europe, you know, that came out of India and other areas thousands of years ago,
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  or whether it's the Irish Pikes, they let the, and I don't think it's the Irish, I'm part Irish,
[40:39.000 --> 40:49.000]  but they let the Irish Pikes and the folks from Eastern Europe as well in England steal your mobile home and keep it because that's part of their culture.
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  Don't believe me? They call them caravans in England.
[40:52.000 --> 40:57.000]  Gypsies told they can keep caravan because it's part of their culture to steal.
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  And it's part of their culture to live in a caravan.
[41:01.000 --> 41:08.000]  Just like they've said in Sweden, Muslims are allowed to rape because it's their culture they don't get in trouble.
[41:08.000 --> 41:15.000]  And that's all this is, is mass cuckolding to see, hey, can we take a five-year-old girl begging for mommy,
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  not give it to grandma or the rest of the family, even the social workers say, don't do it, the grandma's great.
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  In fact, give them back to mom before you do this, whatever mom did, we don't know.
[41:23.000 --> 41:34.000]  And then they give them to hardcore Wahhabis that wear full hoods on their heads and they take her cross the way and tell her she's going to go to hell if she doesn't convert to Islam.
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.000]  And then the Muslim mayor who's already been convicted of corruption says, I don't care.
[41:39.000 --> 41:45.000]  We're going to keep giving the kids the Muslims because the Muslims are getting the money.
[41:45.000 --> 41:52.000]  And then I'm a hateful person because I don't want to be preyed upon by cultures that this is how they operate.
[41:52.000 --> 42:01.000]  In Islamic countries, they are parasitic top-down nightmare scenarios where women are lower than animals.
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  And now they harvest Christian children.
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  It all started with they'll, especially out in Washington states where I always see the reports,
[42:10.000 --> 42:17.000]  they will take Christian children who are five, six years old and say, yes, I'm Christian.
[42:17.000 --> 42:22.000]  When they're teaching them Heather has two mommies or whatever. And then they say, oh my God, that's a hate crime.
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  And they take your child and then quote, give it to a lesbian couple.
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  This is real news to teach them to be diverse.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  They kidnap kids because their parents are Christian and take them and give them.
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.000]  And it's not that I hate those women for what their quote sexual proclivity is.
[42:37.000 --> 42:44.000]  It's that I hate their politics and that they're hunting us and they're harvesting us and they know it and they love it.
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.000]  And they say, we want to kill all the white people. We want to extinct the white people.
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  We want to extinct the heterosexuals. It's Michael Moore.
[42:52.000 --> 43:03.000]  It's the Medusa, you know, the major publications of the feminists say we want to have white women abort their white babies.
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.000]  They teach white genocide at the colleges.
[43:07.000 --> 43:14.000]  And then they teach the whites hate yourself and hate everyone around you and do whatever Michael Moore.
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.000]  The guy just looks like a total creep and is a creep.
[43:18.000 --> 43:26.000]  Do whatever we say or you'll be in the bad group and they want to accept it so bad and they want to shake with their fake indignance.
[43:26.000 --> 43:33.000]  They're, you know, they're fake anger at everyone.
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.000]  So it's just incredible to see these people.
[43:37.000 --> 43:40.000]  This guy on screens like the son of Michael Moore.
[43:40.000 --> 43:45.000]  But let me digress here. I'm going to get back to the hurricane back in North Korea, massive escalations there.
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.000]  And don't just think because we haven't had a major war with them since 53.
[43:49.000 --> 43:57.000]  Even though they've hijacked our ships and attacked South Korea hundreds of times and are now firing missiles right over the coast of Japan.
[43:57.000 --> 44:03.000]  Don't think it won't kick off because Russia is for the first time evacuating their eastern area.
[44:03.000 --> 44:08.000]  I hope they don't kick off. I hope and pray this doesn't happen.
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.000]  But what I'm telling you is the clock has never been closer to doomsday.
[44:13.000 --> 44:16.000]  And that's what the experts are saying.
[44:16.000 --> 44:23.000]  Now, before I go any further, I want to ask the listeners of this broadcast to commit to this transmission.
[44:23.000 --> 44:37.000]  I want to ask the listeners and I want to ask the viewers to go to infowarstore.com and to look at the thousands and thousands and thousands of products that are there on the site.
[44:37.000 --> 44:46.000]  And I just want to ask folks when they go to the site to support us because we need your support.
[44:46.000 --> 44:55.000]  Now, obviously, I'm sick of saying that.
[44:55.000 --> 45:00.000]  And obviously deep down, I'd much less not do this six, seven days a week.
[45:00.000 --> 45:05.000]  But I'm not going to let these criminals win.
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.000]  And everybody knows now that's paying attention that I've not exaggerated.
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  We've laid out exactly what we're facing.
[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  And quite frankly, I can't believe how bad it is.
[45:14.000 --> 45:27.000]  But the good news is what they're trying to sell is so authoritarian and so evil that if we simply just say no to their bullying, say no to their brainwashing, say no to their fraud, they're going to collapse and they know they're going to collapse.
[45:27.000 --> 45:33.000]  Why do you think Nancy Pelosi has come out and said antifa is fascist, antifa is a gang, antifa is evil?
[45:33.000 --> 45:45.000]  Because they tried to sell antifa, sort of funded it, but it's such a consortium of the dregs of the loser earth. Again, a day of the dead convention.
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.000]  I'm not kidding. These people are pathetic. It's very sad.
[45:49.000 --> 45:59.000]  And this walking dead witch queen has been told by her advisors, this is blowing up in our face with our mainline constituents, everyone's turning against us.
[45:59.000 --> 46:07.000]  That's why the smarter Democrats have said back off Russia, back off the antifa, back off Trump's races, you're totally turning everyone against us.
[46:07.000 --> 46:14.000]  But they've been in their own little San Francisco and Seattle echo chambers.
[46:14.000 --> 46:21.000]  So they come up starting to attack me physically and verbally in Seattle. They say, why are you here? This is Seattle.
[46:21.000 --> 46:35.000]  Like, this is Sparta as they waddled up. And I said to show what incredible fascist you are, to show how physically ugly you are, to show how fallen you are.
[46:35.000 --> 46:41.000]  Look at yourselves. Look at you. You hate yourself.
[46:41.000 --> 46:58.000]  So you are projecting that hate onto us. So if you'll go to infowarstore.com and look at the thousands of great items, the very best cookstuffs, the very best food dehydrators at the best prices,
[46:58.000 --> 47:09.000]  the very best storeable foods, the very best t-shirts, the very best books, the very best films, amazing information, great supplements, great products.
[47:09.000 --> 47:15.000]  I mean, you've seen our enemies test it and say, okay, it's California standard, the cleanest. They've tested everything.
[47:15.000 --> 47:22.000]  I know for a fact, five different so-called news publications have bought our products, tested them, and couldn't find anything.
[47:22.000 --> 47:32.000]  Everything was what they said. The amount they say is in there. It's totally clean. They don't even know what to do.
[47:32.000 --> 47:48.000]  So I make it easy to try Supermobility and see why it's got thousands of five-star reviews. It's 57% off. We have never done 57% off in our history.
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.000]  And that's not because we're not selling out of it. I want to just have huge sales.
[47:52.000 --> 48:00.000]  I want to get people off the couch that haven't tried it. So you'll try it. So you'll keep buying it so we can expand the operation and you have a better, more healthy life.
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.000]  It certainly changed my life.
[48:03.000 --> 48:14.000]  M4sLive.com. It says 56 on the screen, 57 here. Oh, that's right. 57 Supermail by itself.
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  Biotrystallinium with Supermails, 56 when you get two together. That's how I was getting confused.
[48:18.000 --> 48:23.000]  And 56% off, you use Supermail Vitality with X2.
[48:23.000 --> 48:29.000]  So there are a lot of different combos. The biggest specials we've ever done on these specific items.
[48:29.000 --> 48:35.000]  I had wider sales the last month and a half. The largest overall sales we had the most items.
[48:35.000 --> 48:42.000]  But this is the biggest best sales ever on Supermail Vitality on X2 and on Biotrystallinium.
[48:42.000 --> 48:49.000]  You can get them individually discounted or get them together. Sign up for AutoShip and these are all lost leaders.
[48:49.000 --> 48:59.000]  AutoShip, an additional 10% off, cancel anytime. You can have it recurring, being sent to you every 15, every 30, every 60, every 90.
[48:59.000 --> 49:04.000]  M4store.com, M4sLive.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[49:04.000 --> 49:13.000]  And again, I want to thank everyone that has supported us over the years, the PrisonPlanet.tv members, our local affiliates, our sponsors, the folks that go to M4store.com.
[49:13.000 --> 49:19.000]  Get your CNN, this fake new shirt. M4Wars.com is real news on the back. M4Wars.com on the right shoulder.
[49:19.000 --> 49:27.000]  Got great little survival watches that are very affordable. Kathy Griffin's CNN is terrorist. You want to trigger folks. It's all available.
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  And a lot of these are limited edition and are about to sell out.
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.000]  Conservatism is the new counterculture. That is a limited edition. We're going to stop selling that soon.
[49:35.000 --> 49:45.000]  We're going to come out with a new variety. I voted for Donald Nacovanka. That was kind of Stone's idea, whatever. That controversy is kind of over, but that's a limited edition.
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  CNN's fake news. That's my favorite shirt, black on white. CNN is terrorist.
[49:49.000 --> 49:55.000]  But commit to get the shirt. You probably get dinner bought for you in libertarian or productive areas.
[49:55.000 --> 50:03.000]  If you're in an area and people look good, whether it's blue collar, white collar or rich, you're going to get dinner bought for you and meet a lot of great people.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  If you walk around, people look like devil worshipers and they're stumbling around and look like sometimes a satanic demon.
[50:07.000 --> 50:15.000]  Suck their soul out. Get ready for the hissing and the spitting and the, you'll think you've met Linda Blair, but it's an amazing experience to wear an M4Wars.com shirt.
[50:15.000 --> 50:23.000]  So get yours today. Help fund the operation. Okay, I'm going to come back, get into more with new developments on North Korea that are the most serious ever.
[50:23.000 --> 50:31.000]  I'm going to give you the latest on Hurricane Harvey. Also, government fast tracking mandatory vaccination as media muzzles debate.
[50:31.000 --> 50:39.000]  Robert F. Kennedy exclusive to M4Wars.com. New big pharma strategy. Kill the messenger. Will Congress and Trump declare war on WikiLeaks?
[50:39.000 --> 50:49.000]  That's like declaring war on your right hand. Whatever. Trump does that. It's a real betrayal and a real black mark against an otherwise stellar and amazing individual.
[50:49.000 --> 51:01.000]  We'll break it all down and what's happening in the economy. The globalists are panicking as we hit 3% growth rate.
[51:19.000 --> 51:25.000]  In thousands of people's lives across America. My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[51:25.000 --> 51:32.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[51:32.000 --> 51:40.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
