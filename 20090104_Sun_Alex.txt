[00:00.000 --> 00:06.840]  The Bible studies exposing the Antichrist, the Beast, and its mark right to the Bible
[00:06.840 --> 00:19.280]  says Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee 37771 or call 888-211-1715 that's 888-211-1715.
[00:19.280 --> 00:32.760]  of the nation's more flu-infected states. You are listening to GCN on News Radio 590K.
[00:32.760 --> 00:38.760]  I am in USA Radio News. I'm Jody Jordan. Israeli ground forces have effectively cut Gaza into
[00:38.760 --> 00:44.080]  two and are surrounding its biggest city. Troops and tanks are being backed by artillery
[00:44.080 --> 00:51.080]  barrages and helicopter gunships. Israeli officials are saying that 30 soldiers have
[00:51.080 --> 00:54.800]  been injured at two of them mysteriously in the fighting. They're claiming they've killed
[00:54.800 --> 00:58.640]  dozens of Hamas militants. Israeli Prime Minister Ahud Almert is telling
[00:58.640 --> 01:02.800]  his cabinet that he's aware of the risks of the operation but says the ground offensive
[01:02.800 --> 01:08.040]  in Togasa is necessary to protect Israeli civilians. Palestinian President Bakmoud
[01:08.040 --> 01:12.960]  Abbas, who governs from the West Bank, is denouncing the Israeli offensive as a brutal
[01:12.960 --> 01:17.600]  aggression. In time, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown says there must be an end to
[01:17.600 --> 01:20.440]  the conflict. We need an emergency fire. The blame claim
[01:20.440 --> 01:25.960]  can continue afterwards but this dangerous moment I think requires us to act.
[01:25.960 --> 01:31.600]  This is IRN USA Radio News. If you've been watching the news lately,
[01:31.600 --> 01:35.400]  you've been hearing a lot about the obstacles in our economy. If you'll listen for just
[01:35.400 --> 01:39.800]  a few seconds, I'll share the opportunities that this economic downturn is offering to
[01:39.800 --> 01:43.520]  those with the energy, courage, and know-how to take advantage of it.
[01:43.520 --> 01:47.640]  Hi, how in the world are you anyway? I'm Andy Willoughby with the Three Step Plan
[01:47.640 --> 01:52.520]  Home Business System. The Three Step Plan helps people feel better, look better, and
[01:52.520 --> 01:57.800]  make more money. History has shown that our product line actually grows during an economic
[01:57.800 --> 02:03.440]  slowdown. Our newest product category actually grew 21% during the last 12 months while
[02:03.440 --> 02:07.960]  most business categories were dropping like a rock. With the Three Step Plan, you can
[02:07.960 --> 02:13.480]  help yourself and others develop another stream of income to survive and prosper in
[02:13.480 --> 02:18.080]  today's uncertain business climate. Don't wait for things to get worse. Check out the
[02:18.080 --> 02:29.920]  Three Step Plan today. Go to threestepplan.com or call 800-480-2102.
[02:29.920 --> 02:34.880]  Presidential inauguration is weeks away but Amtrak and several airlines have been planning
[02:34.880 --> 02:40.640]  ahead. They're adding trains and extra services for the millions expected to attend. Here's
[02:40.640 --> 02:46.600]  Sophia Manos. As a Virginia state police spokeswoman puts it, pack your patience. Virginia troopers
[02:46.600 --> 02:51.280]  from across the state will be deployed to monitor expected gridlock outside Washington.
[02:51.280 --> 02:56.360]  On the Maryland side, commercial drivers are being urged to avoid the area altogether. A
[02:56.360 --> 03:01.240]  woman standing among a crowd of Shiite worshipers has blown herself up in northern Baghdad.
[03:01.240 --> 03:06.560]  At least 35 people are dead and some 65 others wounded. Iraqi authorities fear the death toll
[03:06.560 --> 03:11.600]  could go higher. And British Prime Minister Gordon Brown says he supports closing Guantanamo
[03:11.600 --> 03:17.440]  Bay Prison but hasn't been asked yet to accept any of the detainees. President-elect Barack
[03:17.440 --> 03:23.200]  Obama has pledged to close the camp in Cuba. About 250 terror suspects remain at the U.S.
[03:23.200 --> 03:30.200]  run prison. For more news and analysis, log on to IRN News.com.
[03:53.200 --> 04:04.600]  And more on the Israelis and Palestinians. Where Israeli Defense Force spokesman Colonel
[04:04.600 --> 04:07.600]  Oliver Ravowitz says they have sustained some casualties.
[04:07.600 --> 04:15.600]  You know, we just say that we have two Balinese soldiers and around 20 more lightly and the
[04:15.600 --> 04:17.720]  person is going in against them.
[04:17.720 --> 04:22.320]  Israeli President Shimon Perez says Israel is only trying to take Hamas out.
[04:22.320 --> 04:28.760]  We have decided to try and eliminate this danger. We have nothing against the Gaza
[04:28.760 --> 04:33.560]  people. We wish them well and not part of the Palestinian politics.
[04:33.560 --> 04:38.400]  Arab League Secretary General Amer Musa says he does not think the Israel action in Gaza
[04:38.400 --> 04:40.040]  can be considered defensive.
[04:40.040 --> 04:49.480]  It is unacceptable and not really. This is a description that fits the forces of occupation.
[04:49.480 --> 04:54.560]  This Jerusalem resident says Israel is right to take action against Hamas.
[04:54.560 --> 05:03.480]  Israel cannot pose themselves as sitting ducks for the Hamas and I fervently hope that we
[05:03.480 --> 05:05.200]  wipe them out.
[05:05.200 --> 05:09.080]  Scores of demonstrators who try to reach the U.S. Embassy compound north of Beirut have
[05:09.080 --> 05:11.400]  been turned away by tear gas.
[05:11.400 --> 05:15.360]  Lebanese officials say the demonstrators were protesting Israel's ground attack on the
[05:15.360 --> 05:20.120]  Gaza Strip and police in Thailand say criminal charges will be filed against the owner of
[05:20.120 --> 05:24.920]  a nightclub where at least 62 revelers perished in a New Year's Eve fire.
[05:24.920 --> 05:29.240]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.
[05:29.240 --> 05:33.520]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced
[05:33.520 --> 05:38.320]  alkaline environment, but as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic
[05:38.320 --> 05:40.080]  diet and lack of exercise.
[05:40.080 --> 05:45.400]  pH-balanced is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of
[05:45.400 --> 05:46.400]  disease.
[05:46.400 --> 05:50.440]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and
[05:50.440 --> 05:51.520]  loss of weight.
[05:51.520 --> 05:56.120]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most
[05:56.120 --> 05:57.720]  people are overly acidic.
[05:57.720 --> 06:01.640]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[06:01.640 --> 06:05.960]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[06:05.960 --> 06:06.960]  it.
[06:06.960 --> 06:10.480]  You can start alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[06:10.480 --> 06:15.160]  Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH
[06:15.160 --> 06:19.320]  of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[07:00.280 --> 07:08.280]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[07:08.280 --> 07:13.240]  Come in, thank you for joining us, it is Sunday, January 4th, 2009, we're going to be here
[07:13.240 --> 07:20.160]  for the next two hours roughly, and we'll have open phones at 877-590-5525, love to
[07:20.160 --> 07:21.400]  hear from you.
[07:21.400 --> 07:28.560]  All right, the three major issues that I have to go over today are obviously the invasion,
[07:28.560 --> 07:34.640]  the bombardment started 10 days ago, but the invasion yesterday at around 11 a.m. central
[07:34.640 --> 07:40.520]  standard time here in the United States of the tiny strip of land holding around a million
[07:40.520 --> 07:47.720]  and a half souls just north of Egypt, formerly part of Egypt, sandwiched between the Mediterranean
[07:47.720 --> 07:54.120]  Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and of course Israel.
[07:54.120 --> 08:00.400]  And Israeli tanks, armor helicopters went into the territory yesterday, they have now
[08:00.400 --> 08:06.000]  completed as of a few hours ago the encirclement of the three major cities, including Gaza
[08:06.000 --> 08:12.120]  City that are there on the Mediterranean, so they have now encircled the million and
[08:12.120 --> 08:15.760]  a half souls.
[08:15.760 --> 08:20.480]  And instead of getting emotional about this, why not just look at the facts, whether you're
[08:20.480 --> 08:26.840]  for the Israelis or for the Palestinians, we're just going to look at the facts today
[08:26.840 --> 08:32.360]  and discuss what is really happening, because that's the big issue here.
[08:32.360 --> 08:35.560]  There's a lot of lying going on.
[08:35.560 --> 08:43.080]  Now in tribal warfare, I would expect people who live in Israel to be for Israel, and I
[08:43.080 --> 08:49.080]  would expect the Arabs and Muslims, people in the Middle East to be for the Palestinians,
[08:49.080 --> 08:51.160]  the Gazans.
[08:51.160 --> 08:56.120]  But just as somebody on the outside of this, another United States has been for decades
[08:56.120 --> 08:58.520]  sucked into it.
[08:58.520 --> 09:04.560]  We need to go over the cold, hard facts of what's going on, so I'm going to do that.
[09:04.560 --> 09:10.960]  Also Obama is announcing more details of his, that's right, every time you hear the
[09:10.960 --> 09:19.320]  word Obama, we're going to play his Imperial Battle March for you here on air.
[09:19.320 --> 09:25.400]  Barack Obama is giving us more details of his policies and what he's going to do.
[09:25.400 --> 09:28.000]  And there is some change involved.
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.920]  George Bush tripled the size of the federal government in seven and a half short years.
[09:33.920 --> 09:39.120]  Barack Obama is promising to triple the size again, so the only change is they're accelerating
[09:39.120 --> 09:43.040]  down the same highway, and there'll be some different rhetoric.
[09:43.040 --> 09:49.520]  And Obama brags that he does read the newspaper, and George Bush bragged that he didn't.
[09:49.520 --> 09:52.200]  They work for the exact same financial interest.
[09:52.200 --> 09:56.680]  I want to go over Barack Obama and his national compulsory service.
[09:56.680 --> 09:58.480]  His chief of staff wrote a book about it.
[09:58.480 --> 10:04.480]  He's given C-SPAN, ABC News, interviews, sharing compulsory service for all Americans.
[10:04.480 --> 10:12.740]  Change.gov, the bizarre transition website, we've never seen that before with a newly
[10:12.740 --> 10:20.840]  elected president who's not been sworn in yet, broadcasting from a done-up, fake Oval
[10:20.840 --> 10:28.360]  Office and the rest of it, said that old people have to serve with the senior corps.
[10:28.360 --> 10:33.520]  They're going to have a corps for your junior high and high school students under federal
[10:33.520 --> 10:38.360]  indoctrination, and then you're going to have this million-person domestic spy force.
[10:38.360 --> 10:43.720]  I mean, we've got Obama on video saying it, but it was on Change.gov, and then we talked
[10:43.720 --> 10:48.120]  about it, and others talked about it, and suddenly they jerked it off.
[10:48.120 --> 10:51.920]  They pulled it down from the website.
[10:51.920 --> 10:59.680]  So I'm going to discuss, I mean, playing a clip from his own national radio address
[10:59.680 --> 11:06.320]  this weekend, all that came out today.
[11:06.320 --> 11:07.320]  That's nothing.
[11:07.320 --> 11:12.560]  We've never had a president who's not in the Oval Office yet doing radio addresses,
[11:12.560 --> 11:13.640]  but he's doing it.
[11:13.640 --> 11:21.200]  His presidential radio address, and he says they're going to hire 600,000 new bureaucrats.
[11:21.200 --> 11:26.560]  That's the change, and he has the audacity to say, this is Washington not doing things
[11:26.560 --> 11:29.640]  the way it's been done before.
[11:29.640 --> 11:36.120]  So this is change you can believe in, and their chant, they have children in their cities
[11:36.120 --> 11:41.240]  chanting the government schools, yes we can, yes we can, while wearing Obama uniforms,
[11:41.240 --> 11:45.800]  yes we can take your guns, yes we can get rid of our borders, yes we can start more
[11:45.800 --> 11:53.400]  wars, yes we can audit everybody and squeeze and create hundreds of new federal fines, fees
[11:53.400 --> 11:58.240]  and taxes, yes we can raise the gas taxes, oh, that won't be a tax that hits the average
[11:58.240 --> 12:05.480]  person, but it's only the top 5% that are going to be paying the new taxes.
[12:05.480 --> 12:10.200]  All lies, all betrayal, and don't you dare, if you're a new listener, say, oh, this guy
[12:10.200 --> 12:12.360]  has some right winger.
[12:12.360 --> 12:16.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is no left and right wing at the highest levels of power.
[12:16.680 --> 12:21.360]  Both parties are owned by offshore private banks, the ones that have stolen 8.5 trillion
[12:21.360 --> 12:23.240]  as of early December.
[12:23.240 --> 12:26.840]  We haven't, in more than a month, we haven't gotten the new numbers.
[12:26.840 --> 12:34.000]  Previously every week they would announce 1.3 trillion stolen, that was 8 weeks in,
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.800]  but over a trillion a week stolen, and we don't know now, we haven't seen any new numbers
[12:38.800 --> 12:47.400]  over 3 weeks, but 8.5 trillion stolen by offshore private banks with no oversight, but Obama
[12:47.400 --> 12:52.600]  says the trillion bucks he's going to take of taxpayer money to give to select corporations,
[12:52.600 --> 12:55.080]  he says they'll be oversight.
[12:55.080 --> 13:01.520]  He was the guy that haunched the tie breaking vote in the U.S. Senate to get the banker
[13:01.520 --> 13:06.600]  takeover bill known as the banker bailout, which states that they are now the government,
[13:06.600 --> 13:12.360]  and Bloomberg has reported that the War Powers Act has been declared, meaning, but the new
[13:12.360 --> 13:18.040]  war powers have been given to the private federal reserve, I mean that's a Bloomberg headline
[13:18.040 --> 13:24.000]  with a Fed chief over one of the Fed branches saying we're not even involved now, the Treasury
[13:24.000 --> 13:31.000]  and the Fed governors in New York have declared the War Powers Act over Congress.
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.040]  Remember back on October 3rd when they passed the bill, the members of the House and Senate,
[13:35.040 --> 13:39.920]  Senator Inhofe, others came out and said we were threatened with martial law, well now
[13:39.920 --> 13:47.800]  War Powers has been declared, we are under the control of foreign banks completely.
[13:47.800 --> 13:52.720]  Totally lawless, so we're going to cover some of that today, and this dovetails with it,
[13:52.720 --> 14:01.120]  Pat Robertson has hailed Barack Obama and says that it's of the Lord and that resistance
[14:01.120 --> 14:08.320]  is futile, that it will help America and that Americans want to ease the pain and that socialism
[14:08.320 --> 14:15.560]  will be unstoppable, that's a quote, nothing can stand in its way and that this will help
[14:15.560 --> 14:20.040]  America and then they cut because he literally says he goes to a mountain like Moses.
[14:20.040 --> 14:22.920]  We don't have time for the whole clip, we're going to play a part of it later if you can
[14:22.920 --> 14:27.640]  go to, it's up on WorldNet Daily, it's up on infowars.com, we have it linked up there,
[14:27.640 --> 14:33.520]  it's doing a story on it, it wasn't up there as of Showtime, he said he's doing it.
[14:33.520 --> 14:39.600]  But Pat Robertson says that he goes and the God tells him what's going to happen, of course
[14:39.600 --> 14:44.160]  if you look at his past predictions about 80% of them are wrong, he said, well he said
[14:44.160 --> 14:50.040]  this year we would be nuked, well 2008's over, so now we're 2009, it didn't happen, well
[14:50.040 --> 14:57.400]  now he's saying in 2009 that socialism will save America and that the Muslims are going
[14:57.400 --> 15:02.920]  to collapse worldwide, the opposite is happening by the way, I'm not even really saying that's
[15:02.920 --> 15:06.520]  a good thing Bob, I'm just stating the facts here.
[15:06.520 --> 15:12.000]  And he says that it is of the Lord, of course he also does national TV ads telling you that
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  global warming is real, we need to pay global carbon tax, he does that without Sharpton,
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.680]  so a complete and total sell out, but the zombies he had out in his audience were just
[15:21.680 --> 15:25.760]  smiling when he said the God told him the economy would turn around and socialism would
[15:25.760 --> 15:32.080]  save them and that's the main group that should be resisting communism, socialism, the internationalist
[15:32.080 --> 15:35.880]  should be Christian conservatives, but they're not, I mean Pat Robertson goes on TV and says
[15:35.880 --> 15:40.560]  go ahead and thumb scan to buy and sell, it's of the Lord, I'm on video, he came out and
[15:40.560 --> 15:44.680]  said China has forced abortion but they're doing what they have to do, I mean I have
[15:44.680 --> 15:49.960]  the Huffington Post today criticizing the UN and eugenics and sterilizing people in
[15:49.960 --> 15:56.600]  forced abortion, the liberal Huffington Post and I'm gonna praise them later, it's as if
[15:56.600 --> 16:01.960]  I wrote this article, they got a lot of good people over there like Max Kaiser and others,
[16:01.960 --> 16:04.320]  they'll really tell the truth, he's even attacking Obama now, I don't know how long
[16:04.320 --> 16:09.880]  he'll be there, this is the supposed left, they're admitting the UN is sterilizing people
[16:09.880 --> 16:16.920]  in forced abortions, meanwhile Pat Robertson's saying it's of the Lord, look I'm sorry, Christians
[16:16.920 --> 16:20.960]  can tune out of the show, I'm not gonna be for abortion, it's like when Pastor Hagey
[16:20.960 --> 16:26.200]  said a year ago that Jesus wasn't the Messiah, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna drink your weird
[16:26.200 --> 16:29.760]  Kool-Aid man, you're a bunch of cult members, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[16:29.760 --> 16:33.920]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt,
[16:33.920 --> 16:38.960]  but the truth be told public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999 reaching
[16:38.960 --> 16:46.560]  a peak of $14.8 trillion marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[16:46.560 --> 16:51.120]  The US economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution
[16:51.120 --> 16:53.000]  called the Federal Reserve System.
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.520]  In the year 2000 debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%, it's bad enough that the US citizens

[21:16.480 --> 21:20.680]  posted there as well and we just started at a Twitter feed, I noticed there were some
[21:20.680 --> 21:26.360]  fan Twitter feeds with thousands and thousands of subscribers, so we started a week ago,
[21:26.360 --> 21:32.840]  our own Twitter feed, there's a link up at infowars.com, if you want to get all the news
[21:32.840 --> 21:38.560]  articles we write or news articles we post, the links to be fed to your cell phone or
[21:38.560 --> 21:44.000]  different type of handheld computer device, that really is the wave of the future and
[21:44.000 --> 21:49.280]  I noticed we're the number one radio talk show on Shoutcast, overall ranked number 16
[21:49.280 --> 21:55.560]  for all music, all talk, number one talk, 24 hours a day we're number one and only about
[21:55.560 --> 22:01.240]  a third of my internet feeds are on Shoutcast, a lot of the systems we use aren't compatible
[22:01.240 --> 22:08.200]  with that, so that's too bad, we're number one and that's only a third of our feeds
[22:08.200 --> 22:14.760]  and at the same time we are continuing to grow, so that is very, very exciting, there's
[22:14.760 --> 22:20.480]  a thing called Flycast and that will go to your BlackBerry or iPhone, you can go sign
[22:20.480 --> 22:24.560]  up and download that free app, we've got a link to it up on infowars.com as well on
[22:24.560 --> 22:29.520]  the listen page, just click on the listen link and it's all there, the podcast, the
[22:29.520 --> 22:38.520]  themes, AM and FM affiliate, short wave, it's all there, okay, forgive me if I sound
[22:38.520 --> 22:45.040]  a bit bamboozled today, just cedar fever, they claim it's these conifers that us rednecks
[22:45.040 --> 22:49.360]  around here call cedars in Texas, when the German immigrants came in and the Czech immigrants
[22:49.360 --> 22:55.280]  they cut down, I guess most of the oak trees put goats out and they killed the black level
[22:55.280 --> 23:03.040]  of the soil till it was all rocky and then this imported juniper that we call a cedar
[23:03.040 --> 23:07.520]  came in and they claim that's where everybody's got the allergy, my grandmother's lived here
[23:07.520 --> 23:12.080]  her whole life and never had allergies and now she has them and I was just talking to
[23:12.080 --> 23:15.880]  Jaren and there he helps run the show with Paul, he was saying you know he went out to
[23:15.880 --> 23:19.880]  the countryside this weekend thinking he'd get even sicker, he'd been sick with cedar
[23:19.880 --> 23:25.560]  fever all week and he was better, so it's something that it's mixing with and a lot of
[23:25.560 --> 23:31.480]  mainline MD allergist will tell you it's the GMO food, there's a lot of studies that showed
[23:31.480 --> 23:38.320]  as well that then triggers other naturally occurring substances in the environment, it
[23:38.320 --> 23:46.560]  heightens your capacity to have other things trigger the allergies, so I am going to have
[23:46.560 --> 23:50.840]  some allergist on the radio show in the next few weeks to talk about that because it is
[23:50.840 --> 23:58.240]  serious business to affect your quality of life and it's the same thing, I can go out
[23:58.240 --> 24:01.880]  to Fredericksburg or I can go out to Lano for a week and I won't have this, it's when
[24:01.880 --> 24:08.640]  I come into Austin, so is it the mix of the smog with it or I mean who knows, I just know
[24:08.640 --> 24:12.680]  something's going on in this town and I don't like it, I also get it in LA, I know it's
[24:12.680 --> 24:16.760]  smog there, every time I'm in LA, I have a headache the whole time I'm there and people
[24:16.760 --> 24:20.680]  are like, come on out to LA, see us hang out, stay at my house, no, no I don't want to come
[24:20.680 --> 24:26.200]  out there unless it's on the beach, I'm staying at somebody's house on the beach, that's clean
[24:26.200 --> 24:29.520]  air blowing in, it's when it gets in that bowl, those hills around LA all just sits
[24:29.520 --> 24:38.640]  there cooking, never blows out, never leaves, you know I got a parcel of calls here holding
[24:38.640 --> 24:43.760]  at 877-590-5525 and I haven't even gotten to my main story yet, what I'm going to do
[24:43.760 --> 24:46.400]  is take a few calls right now and we come back, I'm going to get into what's really
[24:46.400 --> 24:51.040]  happening in Gaza, then I'm going to get into national service, the trap that we're deep
[24:51.040 --> 24:57.640]  into and what Obama's announcing and then we'll get into Pat Robertson saying God told
[24:57.640 --> 25:05.040]  him socialism's going to save us, let's go ahead now and go to Chris in San Francisco,
[25:05.040 --> 25:09.760]  Chris you're on the air, thanks Alex, Chris Cantu here and I just want to let your viewers
[25:09.760 --> 25:15.080]  know I came out with a movie called the United States of Terror which is available on Google
[25:15.080 --> 25:19.480]  video and it was inspired by an article you did called the timeline to tyranny, basically
[25:19.480 --> 25:23.640]  all the laws that have been passed since 9-11 that got us to where we are today and what
[25:23.640 --> 25:26.240]  I call the United States of Terror.
[25:26.240 --> 25:30.920]  Well we are openly, and this was publicly admitted in Congress, foreign banks through
[25:30.920 --> 25:35.800]  fraud bought off the government have had contracts signed now where the private treasury rules
[25:35.800 --> 25:39.520]  the United States, the treasury has now been made private just like the Federal Reserve
[25:39.520 --> 25:46.440]  basically and is outside government and has stolen 8.5 trillion we know of, again the last
[25:46.440 --> 25:53.360]  time the numbers came out and we're in receivership, we're being looted like a third world nation.
[25:53.360 --> 25:57.600]  We are, I also want to let your listeners know Alex that there's a document called
[25:57.600 --> 26:03.760]  Irregular Warfare Joint Operating Concept that was published on September 11, 2007 and
[26:03.760 --> 26:08.160]  approved by Robert Gates who's as you know staying on as the Defense Secretary, so in
[26:08.160 --> 26:14.120]  it it talks about conventional warfare traditionally being against other militaries where now they
[26:14.120 --> 26:19.960]  are defining irregular warfare as those that are, that go against the general, warfare
[26:19.960 --> 26:21.960]  that goes against the general population.
[26:21.960 --> 26:26.360]  Yeah well let's go further and I appreciate your call, we covered this a month ago it
[26:26.360 --> 26:32.440]  finally had mainstream news last week, the Army War College says their main mission will
[26:32.440 --> 26:38.400]  be engaging the American people, they specifically admit now 91% of the American people want
[26:38.400 --> 26:43.800]  the borders controlled, both parties don't do it, 80% want the wars to end, the two parties
[26:43.800 --> 26:51.320]  don't do it, 90% of Americans in Gallup polls want taxes cut not raised, feds don't do it
[26:51.320 --> 26:58.360]  because they're illegitimate and so the military, the Naval War College, Thomas Barnett, he
[26:58.360 --> 27:03.200]  admits that they work for foreign offshore banks in the New World Order, so the New
[27:03.200 --> 27:08.440]  World Order is, it's just a fancy term for the corporate takeover of all western countries
[27:08.440 --> 27:14.000]  as well as third world and second world and old world nations, it's a hostile corporate
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.080]  takeover and so they're now announcing all these years, oh we're trading the troops for
[27:18.080 --> 27:22.640]  domestic operations to fight al-Qaeda and then all of a sudden, oh and for rioting and
[27:22.640 --> 27:28.840]  civil unrest, we're sorry but we change the rules of engagement and we'll kill you, but
[27:28.840 --> 27:34.680]  that's freedom and then it turns out in Denver and Minnesota and everywhere else the police
[27:34.680 --> 27:40.680]  have been caught this year alone staging attacks on other police to claim that the protesters
[27:40.680 --> 27:47.400]  did it to set a precedent to attack protest, they just got caught in Greece, national television
[27:47.400 --> 27:53.340]  going and taking off their anarchist outfits and getting in police cars, they have sledge
[27:53.340 --> 27:58.560]  ambers knocking out windows, attacking cars, then it shows police in uniform commanding
[27:58.560 --> 28:03.480]  them and then later, and this is all shot by a journalist hiding on top rooftops, she
[28:03.480 --> 28:07.920]  because the real protesters are attacking police, they're attacking prisons, they're
[28:07.920 --> 28:12.760]  attacking government buildings, mainly the private banks because the folks know who's
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.520]  there, they're deeper into receivership in Greece right now than we are here, so how
[28:17.520 --> 28:21.800]  do the cops turn the general public against the protesters hoping they won't join them,
[28:21.800 --> 28:27.240]  well they go dress up like an anarchist and go beat up old women, burn things down, knock
[28:27.240 --> 28:31.840]  out shop windows, people say look at those people attacking shops, look at those anarchists
[28:31.840 --> 28:43.200]  attacking that old woman, but it's the cops, I mean this is mainstream Greek TV, you can
[28:43.200 --> 28:47.080]  Google or YouTube but it's all over their television news, the police are saying okay
[28:47.080 --> 28:54.200]  we'll stop doing it, Denver Post headline, police attack police and staged event, just
[28:54.200 --> 29:02.920]  Google that, I mean this is really going on, I mean I was there this year and we couldn't
[29:02.920 --> 29:06.680]  be at all the protests at all times, I said well I didn't see police provocaturing in
[29:06.680 --> 29:11.160]  Denver this year, but we did have reporters in Minnesota that did see it, so I said the
[29:11.160 --> 29:17.600]  first time ever I haven't seen police provocateur, well now I have to revise it, I mean I'm
[29:17.600 --> 29:22.120]  fair when I don't see the cops doing bad stuff, but I saw them there, okay we're gonna come
[29:22.120 --> 29:26.080]  back, take more calls, get into Gaza, what's really happening, stay with me, you'll get

[32:29.400 --> 32:33.760]  Hello, I'm Steve Scheng. For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to
[32:33.760 --> 32:38.160]  give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[32:38.160 --> 32:42.360]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes that we're
[32:42.360 --> 32:46.920]  desensitized and frozen and active like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually
[32:46.920 --> 32:48.360]  increasingly hot water.
[32:48.360 --> 32:51.160]  We'll snap out of it, we now have a deadline.
[32:51.160 --> 32:53.360]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[32:53.360 --> 32:58.000]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about
[32:58.000 --> 33:02.800]  January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to
[33:02.800 --> 33:05.160]  make unpopular decisions.
[33:05.160 --> 33:09.400]  While I take the general at his word, my best advice is to have your food in your possession
[33:09.400 --> 33:11.640]  prior to the inauguration.
[33:11.640 --> 33:16.800]  Contact eFoodsDirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[33:16.800 --> 33:21.080]  Ask yourself is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[33:21.080 --> 33:31.360]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[33:31.360 --> 33:34.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[33:34.000 --> 33:41.400]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[33:41.400 --> 33:51.600]  All right, we're going to get to your phone calls coming up here in about 10 minutes.
[33:51.600 --> 33:56.640]  A whole free number to join us, 877-590-5525.
[33:56.640 --> 34:01.720]  It is the fourth day of January, 2009, hard to believe, already four days into a brand
[34:01.720 --> 34:02.720]  new year.
[34:02.720 --> 34:09.400]  Oh, I just went by in the blink, better hold your children, kiss your wife, your husband
[34:09.400 --> 34:29.960]  because life before you know it just goes by in a flash.
[34:29.960 --> 34:40.960]  The Israeli troops take a serious grip on Gaza, they invaded, of course, yesterday into
[34:40.960 --> 34:43.920]  the tiny piece of land.
[34:43.920 --> 34:49.680]  They're landlocked by Israel to the north and to the east and to the south by Egypt,
[34:49.680 --> 34:51.800]  formerly part of Egypt.
[34:51.800 --> 34:53.880]  Israeli troops take a strong grip on Gaza.
[34:53.880 --> 34:58.640]  They now encircle the three main cities, including Gaza City, Israeli troops and tanks, split
[34:58.640 --> 35:03.760]  the Gaza Strip and ringed its main city on Sunday in an offensive against Hamas that
[35:03.760 --> 35:08.000]  has killed more than 500 Palestinians, many of them civilians.
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.720]  I'm proud of the fact that infowars.com reported an hour before anybody else, the headline
[35:13.720 --> 35:22.240]  Israeli ground troops center Gaza, because I was watching live press TV out of Iran feeds
[35:22.240 --> 35:26.640]  out of Gaza with international Iranian TV.
[35:26.640 --> 35:34.960]  Then I was integrating that in with the Israeli news report with the tanks rolling forward
[35:34.960 --> 35:41.760]  and they had the attitude of their tanks down flat, which meant they were shooting targets
[35:41.760 --> 35:42.760]  relatively close.
[35:42.760 --> 35:49.640]  I saw footage of carpet bombing with a type of cluster bomb meant to get rid of landmines
[35:49.640 --> 35:53.680]  and booby traps and so I called Curt and Emma up and I said, write an article saying the
[35:53.680 --> 35:54.680]  ground invasion has begun.
[35:54.680 --> 35:56.680]  He said, are you sure?
[35:56.680 --> 36:00.560]  I said, write the article and I usually tell my folks what to write or what to do.
[36:00.560 --> 36:03.840]  They've got almost complete autonomy and pretty much write what they want and cover
[36:03.840 --> 36:04.840]  what they want.
[36:04.840 --> 36:08.720]  I mean, I pick them because I agree with their views and then about 30 minutes later he posts
[36:08.720 --> 36:13.640]  the story and it says, Israeli troops prepare to invade and I said, Curt, just change it.
[36:13.640 --> 36:15.760]  Just trust me.
[36:15.760 --> 36:21.840]  Say they're invading and then an hour later it came out and Reuters and Harats, Haritz,
[36:21.840 --> 36:25.280]  all over the nose, side issue, it's just that I know what I'm looking at.
[36:25.280 --> 36:28.320]  It didn't take much military study to know.
[36:28.320 --> 36:32.680]  Israeli tanks poured shells and machine gun fire into suspected militant positions and
[36:32.680 --> 36:39.560]  war planes as Hamas fighters fought back with mortars and rockets.
[36:39.560 --> 36:45.040]  Israeli troops and tanks split the Gaza Strip in two and ringed its main city on Sunday
[36:45.040 --> 36:50.800]  in an offensive against Hamas that has killed more than 500 Palestinians, many of them civilians.
[36:50.800 --> 36:53.560]  It's killed more than a thousand of the numbers I've got.
[36:53.560 --> 36:58.720]  Hamas fighters kept up rocket salvos against southern Israel, defying efforts by the Middle
[36:58.720 --> 37:04.240]  East's most powerful army to stamp out the threat Israel has set out to achieve.
[37:04.240 --> 37:10.080]  European Union foreign policy chiefs launched a mission to seek a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip
[37:10.080 --> 37:15.800]  but acknowledged they faced a difficult test persuading the parties to stop fighting.
[37:15.800 --> 37:17.880]  All right, let me just stop there.
[37:17.880 --> 37:20.120]  You know the basics and say this.
[37:20.120 --> 37:31.040]  I don't look at a political issue and say, well, you know, I've got a dog in this fight.
[37:31.040 --> 37:37.360]  I coldly look at it and then come to my conclusion and then I may hotly, you know, in a very
[37:37.360 --> 37:42.280]  aggressive way push the point I'm making, but there is a cold-blooded intellectual
[37:42.280 --> 37:49.800]  process that goes on and the cold-blooded process is what is moral, what is right, what
[37:49.800 --> 37:58.120]  historically is best for liberty and freedom, especially for my nation and my family.
[37:58.120 --> 38:02.480]  What is in my best interest, but also balancing that with a moral compass.
[38:02.480 --> 38:06.200]  And so I come about that decision cold-bloodedly.
[38:06.200 --> 38:10.240]  You know, I get criticized by some by not attacking Israel, by not criticizing Israel
[38:10.240 --> 38:13.880]  for its excesses.
[38:13.880 --> 38:17.880]  So when I say the things I'm going to say, it is from deep study.
[38:17.880 --> 38:25.400]  Okay, we have been taught by our media to love and worship Israel and that Israel can
[38:25.400 --> 38:31.800]  do no wrong and that Israel is always attacked and that Israel isn't the aggressor.
[38:31.800 --> 38:37.200]  Well that isn't true starting in the early 1940s.
[38:37.200 --> 38:44.440]  The later president of Israel and others blew up British, blew up European hotels, killed
[38:44.440 --> 38:45.760]  tens of thousands.
[38:45.760 --> 38:47.840]  This is all mainline history.
[38:47.840 --> 38:54.920]  Machine gun crowds bombed, busy markets attacked the Arabs, you know, the Palestinians, killed
[38:54.920 --> 38:59.920]  tens of thousands, but mainly targeted England, who had taken over from the Ottoman Empire
[38:59.920 --> 39:00.920]  there.
[39:00.920 --> 39:05.600]  And this was being funded by the large Bank of England controlled by the Rothschild family
[39:05.600 --> 39:09.200]  that took control of the Bank of England by staging a run on it at the end of the Battle
[39:09.200 --> 39:14.240]  of Waterloo, claiming Napoleon had won in 1815, if you must know, that's mainline history.
[39:14.240 --> 39:17.520]  It's not really taught in school, but it's in the mainline history books.
[39:17.520 --> 39:20.480]  We should read the scholarly treatises on the subject.
[39:20.480 --> 39:24.520]  It's in Cyclopedia Britannica, if you'd like to look.
[39:24.520 --> 39:31.320]  But so the Palestinians learned everything they're doing because it was done to them.
[39:31.320 --> 39:36.520]  I mean, bombing mosque, shooting crowds, and you're not supposed to talk about that.
[39:36.520 --> 39:41.360]  Israel's like, oh, it's so terrible, oh, they used asymmetrical warfare and low intensity
[39:41.360 --> 39:47.120]  conflict and it's called terrorism.
[39:47.120 --> 39:54.220]  And I agree it is terror, but they were called rebels when the Israelis did it to the Palestinians
[39:54.220 --> 39:55.720]  and the British.
[39:55.720 --> 39:58.920]  It's not called that today.
[39:58.920 --> 40:03.200]  And when Israel attacked the U.S. as liberty and tried to sink it in 67 to blame it on
[40:03.200 --> 40:10.560]  Egypt as a pretext for war, it was called patriotic and a dirty trick.
[40:10.560 --> 40:16.680]  And they tried to brush it under the rug, but now, earlier in 2008, got to get used to
[40:16.680 --> 40:21.440]  saying last year, almost said this year, 2008, the Chicago for being around the headline
[40:21.440 --> 40:24.000]  confirming Israel attacked it in a premeditated fashion.
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.360]  The national security tapes have been released by the NSA and that they knowingly attacked
[40:29.360 --> 40:30.520]  the ship to blame it on Egypt.
[40:30.520 --> 40:34.040]  Now, we already had the fighter pilots that refused orders three times.
[40:34.040 --> 40:37.760]  They liked the U.S. They didn't want to attack the ship, but they were ordered to do it.
[40:37.760 --> 40:39.920]  Now thank God they kept the ship afloat and didn't sink.
[40:39.920 --> 40:44.920]  So, so again, that's just a fact that it isn't that I even want to bash Israel.
[40:44.920 --> 40:46.120]  I'm not a Palestinian.
[40:46.120 --> 40:47.760]  I'm not an Arab.
[40:47.760 --> 40:51.800]  I mean, do I lose a lot of sleep at night knowing that Muslims and Christians are killing
[40:51.800 --> 40:54.280]  each other in Malaysia right now?
[40:54.280 --> 40:57.240]  Even though I'm a Christian, I mean, I just know that's tribal warfare.
[40:57.240 --> 40:58.240]  That's always going to go on.
[40:58.240 --> 40:59.240]  I'm sad.
[40:59.240 --> 41:01.860]  It's happening, but there's not much I can do to stop it.
[41:01.860 --> 41:05.360]  I mean, do I lose sleep at night knowing?
[41:05.360 --> 41:08.760]  So understand, I don't have a dog in this fight.
[41:08.760 --> 41:11.880]  I was brought up in condition to worship Israel.
[41:11.880 --> 41:15.520]  Israel was perfect as pure as the driven snow could do no wrong.
[41:15.520 --> 41:22.680]  So if anything, my cultural conditioning is decided with Israel.
[41:22.680 --> 41:35.080]  So separately and coldly from the outside of all of this, I am simply going over the
[41:35.080 --> 41:39.280]  facts and what are the facts?
[41:39.280 --> 41:48.000]  Okay, as an American citizen, I am angry by the fact that the media insults my intelligence.
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.440]  Okay, they lie.
[41:52.440 --> 41:56.240]  And if you look at the polls in Europe and if you watch European television, which you
[41:56.240 --> 42:02.800]  can get on some cable systems, dish systems, I watch live feeds online, 75% of the reporting
[42:02.800 --> 42:03.800]  in Europe.
[42:03.800 --> 42:08.720]  In Europe is against the United States doing this and Israel and yes, the U.S. gave the
[42:08.720 --> 42:11.440]  weapons the money to do it.
[42:11.440 --> 42:13.200]  If you watch England, it's 50-50.
[42:13.200 --> 42:19.200]  If you watch the U.S., it's 98% negative against Hamas.
[42:19.200 --> 42:20.200]  And they're lying.
[42:20.200 --> 42:22.480]  They're saying Hamas broke the ceasefire.
[42:22.480 --> 42:25.800]  Well, you can go watch the U.N. debates on the U.N. and I'm no fan of the U.N.
[42:25.800 --> 42:30.120]  They're just reporting the facts there because, you know, they look like fools with all these
[42:30.120 --> 42:34.320]  international bodies there and all these foreign countries and all these intelligence heads
[42:34.320 --> 42:38.920]  where it's public knowledge outside this dumbed-down and we are the most dumbed-down
[42:38.920 --> 42:43.040]  people in the world now, from the smartest, most intelligent, most informed to the lowest
[42:43.040 --> 42:47.240]  IQs, so physical acuity and then also our education.
[42:47.240 --> 42:49.400]  We're not just the worst in the industrialized world.
[42:49.400 --> 42:55.960]  We're 30-something overall, so we're 15 nations behind third-world countries, not just first-world.
[42:55.960 --> 43:02.480]  So it's admitted and Israel admits that they have been doing targeted bombings and killings
[43:02.480 --> 43:09.480]  for the last seven months in the Gaza Strip, in the three cities in outlying towns, Gaza
[43:09.480 --> 43:14.680]  City and others, and they promised under the ceasefire to open the border crossings up
[43:14.680 --> 43:20.160]  again into Israel, you know, because the people want to come clean the Israelis' houses
[43:20.160 --> 43:21.160]  and things.
[43:21.160 --> 43:24.800]  That's kind of the servant class.
[43:24.800 --> 43:29.680]  They're not allowed to, so Israel broke the truce, we'll come back, finish up with that.
[43:29.680 --> 43:32.720]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.

[47:42.560 --> 47:45.960]  So again, let's do an exercise here.
[47:45.960 --> 47:50.520]  If you're for the Palestinians and you're mad that I'm not coming right out and saying
[47:50.520 --> 47:59.960]  Israel needs to burn in hell, try being intellectual and actually listening to the facts.
[47:59.960 --> 48:06.320]  And if you're an Israeli or an Israel supporter, try not saying let's kill all the Arabs and
[48:06.320 --> 48:08.440]  drive them into the sea.
[48:08.440 --> 48:10.880]  Let's try to just look at the facts here, okay?
[48:10.880 --> 48:18.320]  I as an American don't like being insulted by the media saying that Hamas fired these
[48:18.320 --> 48:25.800]  Kutusha rockets, very low intensity conflict weapon, very low kill ratio.
[48:25.800 --> 48:29.880]  It's the equivalent of a high-tech rock, and you see the footage of the Palestinians throwing
[48:29.880 --> 48:33.160]  rocks or using slings.
[48:33.160 --> 48:35.960]  It is definitely an upgrade from that, but not much.
[48:35.960 --> 48:38.000]  It kills a couple people a week.
[48:38.000 --> 48:39.760]  It's terrible.
[48:39.760 --> 48:45.440]  But every week Israel would go in and bomb what they call the illegitimate government
[48:45.440 --> 48:52.800]  of Hamas that won free elections there and Israel's puppet was kicked out, what now two
[48:52.800 --> 48:57.000]  years ago, back in 2006, almost three years ago.
[48:57.000 --> 49:02.960]  So the media is lying about that, and that's very insulting to claim that Israel isn't
[49:02.960 --> 49:08.760]  shooting and bombing and killing people inside the Gaza Strip and engaging in targeted assassinations.
[49:08.760 --> 49:14.760]  I mean, the media just be honest about it and say that these two groups are fighting
[49:14.760 --> 49:20.600]  with each other and just report that, and that Israel broke the ceasefire, then I would
[49:20.600 --> 49:25.200]  be not as outraged and insulted by it.
[49:25.200 --> 49:32.280]  Now again, for several years you didn't hear about these rockets, but then when the killings
[49:32.280 --> 49:42.760]  started in early 2008, Hamas started firing the rockets back into Israel.
[49:42.760 --> 49:49.200]  Also Israel about nine months ago cut off ships coming in with aid, ships coming in
[49:49.200 --> 49:51.520]  with medicine to a million and a half people.
[49:51.520 --> 49:55.440]  I mean, that's a lot of folks.
[49:55.440 --> 50:00.720]  That's Austin, Texas and the whole metro area and then 300, 400,000 more.
[50:00.720 --> 50:04.200]  And just everything cut off to your city, everything cut off.
[50:04.200 --> 50:05.520]  That's how big the Gaza Strip is.
[50:05.520 --> 50:15.620]  It's the size of two districts of Columbia's smaller than Dallas, Texas area geographically.
[50:15.620 --> 50:19.920]  And so imagine they're being bombed, they're being attacked and everything is cut off.
[50:19.920 --> 50:24.160]  Now in the peace agreement in the deal, they were supposed to get medicine and supplies.
[50:24.160 --> 50:31.280]  They were supposed to be able to have trade and Israel because the Gaza Strip to its south
[50:31.280 --> 50:38.200]  borders Egypt and Israel's constantly bombing any aid that attempts to come through there.
[50:38.200 --> 50:43.320]  And so their only border with civilization is the Mediterranean Sea, but no trade is
[50:43.320 --> 50:44.720]  allowed to come in.
[50:44.720 --> 50:48.000]  Israeli patrol boats control that, lock that down.
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.360]  And the most of the Palestinians do want to go into Israel.
[50:51.360 --> 50:52.620]  They do want to work.
[50:52.620 --> 50:56.560]  They do want to go work in shops and work as maids and that's about the only jobs they're
[50:56.560 --> 50:57.960]  allowed to have.
[50:57.960 --> 51:01.520]  And they've got to go to checkpoints and wait for hours and routinely get shot for no reason.
[51:01.520 --> 51:03.920]  I mean, that's all over the nose.
[51:03.920 --> 51:05.320]  But Israel won't even allow that.
[51:05.320 --> 51:12.280]  So you've got a million, 500,000 people just sitting there literally starving to death.
[51:12.280 --> 51:16.320]  Electricity's off most of the time, almost no medicine.
[51:16.320 --> 51:20.600]  Whether you love her or hate her, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, I admire her for many reasons,
[51:20.600 --> 51:22.480]  interviewed her several times as well.
[51:22.480 --> 51:25.120]  She's in my film, Matrix of Evil.
[51:25.120 --> 51:26.440]  She comes in on this pleasure boat.
[51:26.440 --> 51:29.000]  They rammed the front, rammed the side, almost sink the ship.
[51:29.000 --> 51:34.200]  And the media spins it like, oh, there was a little ding on the dingy was the CNN subheadline,
[51:34.200 --> 51:35.640]  a ding on the dingy.
[51:35.640 --> 51:38.480]  No, it was just fun.
[51:38.480 --> 51:39.480]  No big deal.
[51:39.480 --> 51:44.700]  A former Congressperson almost being killed, trying to bring in medical supplies.
[51:44.700 --> 51:50.000]  And so that's very insulting to my intelligence to have people lying about that.
[51:50.000 --> 51:59.680]  And then there's also this claim that Israel is only targeting military assets, paramilitary
[51:59.680 --> 52:02.000]  Hamas assets.
[52:02.000 --> 52:08.400]  Well, again, those tunnels, the 40 plus tunnels they've destroyed, that's how the majority
[52:08.400 --> 52:13.360]  of the food and fuel oil and other necessities are being brought in to the country because
[52:13.360 --> 52:15.520]  Israel won't allow anything in.
[52:15.520 --> 52:16.800]  It's total siege.
[52:16.800 --> 52:22.200]  Now Israel's physically gone in and encircled the three major cities, Gaza City being the
[52:22.200 --> 52:29.000]  biggest, to where nothing can come in, to where nothing can come in.
[52:29.000 --> 52:33.040]  And folks tended to dehumanize the Palestinians or say, they're not even Palestinians.
[52:33.040 --> 52:34.040]  They're Arabs.
[52:34.040 --> 52:35.040]  They have no right to that land.
[52:35.040 --> 52:36.040]  Come on.
[52:36.040 --> 52:43.200]  Under the Ottoman Empire and previous empires for thousands of years since 70 AD, Titus,
[52:43.200 --> 52:50.280]  the Roman general, because Judea was in revolt, went in and leveled the city of Jerusalem
[52:50.280 --> 52:55.720]  and basically killed the majority of the population and took the rest into slavery.
[52:55.720 --> 53:01.480]  So Israel, there was no Israel from 70 AD until 1947.
[53:01.480 --> 53:03.480]  Okay.
[53:03.480 --> 53:08.600]  Now obviously, especially the Sephardic Jews out of North Africa and Spain in places, they
[53:08.600 --> 53:11.000]  really do have ancestors that live there.
[53:11.000 --> 53:17.000]  The European folks out of Russia, they just converted what hundreds and hundreds of years
[53:17.000 --> 53:22.080]  ago, 800 years ago, to Judaism, but that's fine if they want to try to move down there.
[53:22.080 --> 53:27.800]  The point is, is that Jews and Arabs and others lived in peace there and weren't killing
[53:27.800 --> 53:34.640]  each other until the 40s when money out of England financed the overthrow of the British
[53:34.640 --> 53:36.000]  government there.
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.280]  And the British government allowed that to happen.
[53:38.280 --> 53:41.160]  Very bizarre because of big payoffs that were made.
[53:41.160 --> 53:46.800]  And so when we hear that it's all one-sided, that is what is an insult.
[53:46.800 --> 53:54.400]  And then the image of tanks and cobras, gunships and Apache gunships and the image of F-15s
[53:54.400 --> 54:03.800]  and F-16s and drones and predators dropping 2,000 and 3,000 pound bombs and the image
[54:03.800 --> 54:10.120]  of dead children and dead women, you know, 45% of the population of the Gaza Strip is
[54:10.120 --> 54:11.920]  under the age of 15.
[54:11.920 --> 54:13.720]  Pull that number up.
[54:13.720 --> 54:16.880]  You can check that number out at cia.gov, they have their fact book there, that's where
[54:16.880 --> 54:25.120]  I went to check that number, 45% are under the age of 15.
[54:25.120 --> 54:28.600]  And so you have this exploding third world population, they're living in third world
[54:28.600 --> 54:38.200]  conditions and Israel is engaging in the most ancient form of total war against that country.
[54:38.200 --> 54:42.800]  And I mean that, you can say it is in a country, it's a scrap of land, well I mean those are
[54:42.800 --> 54:46.120]  people that did live there.
[54:46.120 --> 54:51.400]  Those are people that did live there when it was Egypt.
[54:51.400 --> 54:57.160]  Now the bigger issue is why won't Egypt allow them to immigrate?
[54:57.160 --> 55:00.160]  Why won't Syria allow them to immigrate?
[55:00.160 --> 55:03.560]  Well the answer is some of them don't want to leave but many do and aren't allowed to
[55:03.560 --> 55:04.560]  leave.
[55:04.560 --> 55:13.280]  And so that's pretty cold-blooded and Egypt's supposedly our ally and by our ally, you see
[55:13.280 --> 55:18.400]  I'm in that group think of I'm an American and so they're the U.S. and Israel's ally
[55:18.400 --> 55:24.480]  but Israel is controlled by the globalist, the United States is controlled by the globalist,
[55:24.480 --> 55:26.320]  Egypt is controlled by the globalist.
[55:26.320 --> 55:29.440]  Those interests really are being served here.
[55:29.440 --> 55:36.120]  And so not one rocket was fired until what, seven, eight months ago, when they started
[55:36.120 --> 55:41.320]  the targeting killings and breaking the deal and shutting down the border crossings for
[55:41.320 --> 55:44.960]  people that wanted to come in and work in Israel and Israelis who wanted to hire them
[55:44.960 --> 55:53.320]  and some Arab Israelis as well that live in Israel and live in peace.
[55:53.320 --> 55:58.080]  So there are radicals on the Israeli side, there are radicals on the Palestinian side,
[55:58.080 --> 56:08.240]  but clearly one has to overall side with the Palestinians, with the people in the Gaza
[56:08.240 --> 56:13.560]  Strip because they have one of the most high-tech militaries.
[56:13.560 --> 56:15.360]  Israel says they're the most high-tech.
[56:15.360 --> 56:20.480]  There were 400 nukes and all these fighter bombers and thousands of tanks and the latest
[56:20.480 --> 56:25.040]  anti-missile technology on and on and on and on and then Israel acts like, oh, we just
[56:25.040 --> 56:28.880]  gave the Arabs this land and look how mean they're acting for no reason after we gave
[56:28.880 --> 56:29.880]  it to them.
[56:29.880 --> 56:36.200]  Well, you took it away from them back during the Six-Day War.
[56:36.200 --> 56:40.880]  So when we come back from break, I want to go to Tom, Kathy, Kurt, Kurt's first, Logan
[56:40.880 --> 56:41.880]  and others.
[56:41.880 --> 56:44.920]  We'll go directly to your calls on whatever subject you're calling in about, but I would
[56:44.920 --> 56:48.200]  imagine some of you will want to talk about the issue I just brought up and if you disagree
[56:48.200 --> 56:53.440]  with me, if you think I'm being too easy on Israel, call in or if you think I'm being
[56:53.440 --> 57:02.640]  too easy on the Palestinians, you're welcome to call in at 877-590-558-7759-0525, if you're
[57:02.640 --> 57:05.640]  listening on AM and FM stations around the country or shortwave or satellite or the internet.
[57:05.640 --> 57:09.120]  If you're listening from all the way, it goes north of Dallas, down to San Antonio, down
[57:09.120 --> 57:14.480]  to the beach, down to South Texas, huge footprint of the station that I've transmitted out of
[57:14.480 --> 57:18.160]  on Sundays at the mothership where the transmission originates from.
[57:18.160 --> 57:21.120]  It is news radio 590-KLBJ.
[57:21.120 --> 57:25.200]  That local number is 836-0590.
[57:25.200 --> 57:26.200]  We are live.
[57:26.200 --> 57:30.200]  It is January 4th, 2009.
[57:30.200 --> 57:36.160]  Man, that's taken some getting used to, but I want to hurry through a bunch of calls for
[57:36.160 --> 57:43.280]  most of the next half hour after the news and then I'm going to get into all of the
[57:43.280 --> 57:46.560]  other news.
[57:46.560 --> 57:51.400]  But another one of the big lies is that Iran is running this whole operation.
[57:51.400 --> 57:53.080]  Now that's in the LA Times today.
[57:53.080 --> 57:59.920]  In Gaza, the real enemy is Iran by Yossi Klein and Michael Oren and they say that Iran's
[57:59.920 --> 58:00.920]  behind it all.
[58:00.920 --> 58:08.320]  Well, Iran was behind Hezbollah, Shia, in Lebanon.
[58:08.320 --> 58:10.440]  Yes.
[58:10.440 --> 58:14.480]  But Iran is not behind Hamas.
[58:14.480 --> 58:17.040]  And by the way, the big dirty cigarette, you can Google this and read this in Israeli
[58:17.040 --> 58:18.040]  papers.
[58:18.040 --> 58:19.040]  Israel.

[59:19.320 --> 59:24.200]  For fact, rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on
[59:24.200 --> 59:25.960]  world health is staggering.
[59:25.960 --> 59:30.280]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[59:30.280 --> 59:34.680]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world
[59:34.680 --> 59:37.920]  in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[59:37.920 --> 59:38.920]  The solution.

[1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:22.280]  battle blazes.
[1:00:22.280 --> 1:00:26.280]  This is the GCN radio network.
[1:00:26.280 --> 1:00:33.600]  Hey, LBJ, Austin, Texas.
[1:00:33.600 --> 1:00:36.560]  I am in USA Radio News, I'm Jody Jordan.
[1:00:36.560 --> 1:00:41.360]  Gaza officials say at least 31 civilians have been killed as Israeli forces continue their
[1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:43.000]  ground offensive.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:46.560]  Troops and tanks have cut the coastal territory into two.
[1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:50.240]  The Israeli military say several dozen militants have been killed.
[1:00:50.240 --> 1:00:52.440]  This is British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:56.720]  The very events that we're seeing emphasize what the real challenge is.
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:01.840]  Israel needs to be secure, Palestine needs to be viable, Palestine needs to have humanitarian
[1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:07.040]  support and the Palestinians, of course, need that, the Israelis need to be sure of the
[1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:08.040]  security.
[1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:13.400]  The sounds from Beirut were security officials in Lebanon say police have fired tear gas to
[1:01:13.400 --> 1:01:17.560]  keep scores of demonstrators from reaching the U.S. Embassy compound.
[1:01:17.560 --> 1:01:22.200]  They say about 250 demonstrators protesting Israel's ground attack on the Gaza Strip
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:26.840]  tried to cut through Bob Dwyer police had placed on a road leading to the embassy.
[1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:30.680]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[1:01:30.680 --> 1:01:35.960]  The pit bulls at the credit card company made my life miserable with their 25 calls a day.
[1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:40.640]  How would you like to be out of credit card debt in as little as 12 to 36 months?
[1:01:40.640 --> 1:01:44.880]  If you owe more than $10,000 in credit card bills, you could save thousands of dollars
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:49.080]  by starting with a free no obligation consultation from a copia consulting.
[1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:51.720]  The staff at a copia was just great.

[1:02:35.240 --> 1:02:36.400]  Here's Sagar Maghani.
[1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:40.560]  The inauguration is still more than two weeks off and the President-elect's traditional
[1:02:40.560 --> 1:02:45.960]  residence still isn't available, but the Obamas are making an early appearance in the capital
[1:02:45.960 --> 1:02:49.920]  because 10-year-old Malia and 70-year-old Sasha start school tomorrow.
[1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:53.440]  Their first day at the Tony Sidwell Friends School.
[1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:57.760]  While they get acclimated to new digs, their dad will be on familiar turf.
[1:02:57.760 --> 1:03:02.480]  The President-elect's due to meet with congressional leaders to push ahead on an economic stimulus
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:05.800]  package he hopes to enact soon after taking office.
[1:03:05.800 --> 1:03:07.680]  Sagar Maghani at the White House.

[1:04:00.600 --> 1:04:05.000]  Before he heads to Washington tomorrow to lay claim to a Senate seat doiled out by disgraced
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:10.240]  Illinois Governor Rod McLoevage, Roland Burrows will address his supporters in Chicago.
[1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:14.280]  He's likely to get a much frostier reception at the Capitol where Senate Democrats have
[1:04:14.280 --> 1:04:17.680]  said they will reject any Begoyevich appointment.
[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:19.880]  This is Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
[1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:26.080]  Begoyevich obviously is a corrupt individual, I think that's pretty clear.
[1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:30.640]  And the reason that he's done what he's done is divert attention from the arrest that was
[1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:32.080]  just made of him.
[1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:35.200]  And more on the Israelis and Palestinians.
[1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:40.200]  Israel doesn't seem concerned about some international demonstrations against the offensive.
[1:04:40.200 --> 1:04:41.200]  Here's Aaron Heller.
[1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:45.840]  Israel's pointing out they're making this distinction between protests of the public opinion in
[1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:48.480]  Western countries and those of the government so far.
[1:04:48.480 --> 1:04:50.640]  No real diplomatic pressure on Israel.
[1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:54.800]  Not from Europe, not from even Arab states around Israel, like Jordan and Asia.
[1:04:54.800 --> 1:04:59.360]  Israeli President Shimon Peres says Israel is right to take action against Hamas.
[1:04:59.360 --> 1:05:04.560]  We carry the greatest weapon on earth, which is justice.
[1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:09.240]  And Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeib Erkutets says the problems in the Middle East cannot
[1:05:09.240 --> 1:05:12.000]  be discussed until there's a ceasefire in Gaza.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:16.800]  I believe the focus should be on one thing at this particular point, and that is to stop
[1:05:16.800 --> 1:05:20.520]  all attacks against Gaza from Israel.
[1:05:20.520 --> 1:05:24.200]  We believe once this is achieved, we can talk about all other issues.
[1:05:24.200 --> 1:05:30.320]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN, USA Radio News.

[1:07:05.880 --> 1:07:11.560]  ABC News reporting, President-elect makes new pitch promises on job creation including
[1:07:11.560 --> 1:07:17.160]  $600,000 new government employees on top of George Bush tripling the size of government.
[1:07:17.160 --> 1:07:19.760]  That's change you can believe him, we're going to get into that.
[1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:24.160]  Pat Robertson saying God says U.S. will accept socialism, that it's going to be good and
[1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:26.040]  fix our problems.
[1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:30.600]  So I mean the total sellout, both parties, they're taking over with big government and
[1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:32.920]  taxes and regulation, incredible.
[1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:37.840]  The Huffington Post comes out, big liberal side admitting the U.N. is funding forced
[1:07:37.840 --> 1:07:43.280]  abortion and fantasizing eugenics, but Pat Robertson is endorsing forced abortion in
[1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:44.280]  China.
[1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:47.120]  I mean everything is upside down.
[1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:50.480]  So we'll be going over that as well.
[1:07:50.480 --> 1:07:55.800]  Some other news reports that I have here in front of me is Yellowstone earthquakes raise
[1:07:55.800 --> 1:07:56.800]  fears.
[1:07:56.800 --> 1:08:01.880]  You know all of Yellowstone is a giant caldera or that is the cone of a volcano.
[1:08:01.880 --> 1:08:05.240]  In fact, that's just the center of the cone.
[1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:10.840]  And top geologists, top volcanologists are saying they believe it erupted a few million
[1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:14.680]  years ago and destroyed the equivalent would have killed everything in the four western
[1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:15.680]  states.
[1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:18.440]  Everything in the four western states that Yellowstone is in front of the middle of.
[1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:21.600]  They say there is a good chance it could erupt.
[1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:24.960]  Even the Dallas Morning News had the headline, you know, is it going to blow?
[1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:31.200]  I have the headline here out of AOL News, Yellowstone, earthquakes raise fears.
[1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:37.240]  They had a whole bunch of earthquakes yesterday there and the whole thing is rising.
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:38.720]  Other parts are sinking.
[1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:40.440]  They believe it could blow sky high.
[1:08:40.440 --> 1:08:44.040]  Look, I'm not saying that's going to happen, but there were a lot of volcanologists and
[1:08:44.040 --> 1:08:48.480]  geologists that said, seismologists that said of all those disciplines that they thought
[1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:51.200]  Mount St. Helens was going to blow.
[1:08:51.200 --> 1:08:57.640]  And that is tiny compared what happened in 1980 to what would happen if the big end.
[1:08:57.640 --> 1:09:00.960]  I mean, this is a super prehistoric volcano.
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:04.920]  In all of human recorded history, nothing's ever blown this big.
[1:09:04.920 --> 1:09:08.360]  So literally goodbye, America.
[1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:14.880]  And they're talking about a 20 point reduction on average temperatures.
[1:09:14.880 --> 1:09:18.440]  If this happens just the dust in the air, all right, I'm done talking about it.
[1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:19.440]  I'm going to get into it more later.
[1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:20.880]  Let's go to your calls right now.
[1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:24.240]  If you don't believe me, just Google Yellowstone and click news.
[1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:27.440]  There's hundreds of mainstream articles saying this could be the big one.
[1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:28.720]  I'm not saying that.
[1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:29.880]  They're saying that.
[1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:30.880]  Okay.
[1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:32.960]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kurt in Ohio.
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:37.160]  Kurt, thanks for holding buddy.
[1:09:37.160 --> 1:09:38.720]  What's going on?
[1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:42.200]  A little story I want to tell you about real quick.
[1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:45.480]  I had no New Year's Eve and it kind of goes along with your little rant that you had Friday,
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:49.760]  which I must say is my favorite by far.
[1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:54.680]  I celebrate the New Year's at midnight by, you know, 9-11 was an inside job.
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:56.680]  I didn't use a traditional pots and pans.
[1:09:56.680 --> 1:09:59.600]  I had a few officers patrolling the area.
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:01.520]  They proceeded to pull in front of my house.
[1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:03.240]  Mind you, I'm inside my house.
[1:10:03.240 --> 1:10:06.120]  They shine their spotlights up in my window.
[1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:10.840]  The one proceeded to call me a retard and threatened to put me in jail if I kept using
[1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:11.840]  profanity.
[1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:12.840]  I was not using profanity.
[1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:15.840]  Well, you should have videotaped that and put it on YouTube and have a million views
[1:10:15.840 --> 1:10:16.840]  right now.
[1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:17.840]  Yeah, I know it.
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:22.840]  Every look, look, look, they got decent video cameras that are just basically a camera hooked
[1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:27.480]  up to a memory stick for like a hundred bucks.
[1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:33.040]  I mean, everybody needs to have one of these and be like quick draw McGraw, like a gunslinger,
[1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:34.880]  but it's a video camera.
[1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:37.880]  And I'm actually in the process of getting one of them little flip cameras.
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:39.520]  So what were you doing to have the police?
[1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:44.440]  Well, listen, we had a Ron Paul supporter arrested a bunch of them for their signs protesting
[1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:45.600]  on streets.
[1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:48.480]  We had people that had American flag upside down and a Ron Paul sign.
[1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:52.320]  The cops busted in the house without a warrant, beat them up, took them to jail.
[1:10:52.320 --> 1:10:53.400]  That was in South Carolina.
[1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:54.680]  That was mainstream news.
[1:10:54.680 --> 1:10:55.680]  They're crazy.
[1:10:55.680 --> 1:10:56.680]  Some of them.
[1:10:56.680 --> 1:10:57.760]  They think we don't have a First Amendment.
[1:10:57.760 --> 1:11:00.640]  What were you doing to make them come to your house?
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:05.280]  I was hanging out my window yelling at 9-11 was an inside job that we need to fight these
[1:11:05.280 --> 1:11:07.280]  global fascist elite.
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:08.280]  That's good.
[1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:11.280]  I tell everybody to go out, stick your head out the window and tell them you're mad as
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:12.280]  hell.
[1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:13.280]  You're not going to take it anymore.
[1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:15.400]  Not done that too, buddy.
[1:11:15.400 --> 1:11:16.400]  Beautiful.
[1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:20.600]  I wanted to know real quick if like I'm holding a screening here in the Dayton area of your
[1:11:20.600 --> 1:11:21.600]  movie Endgame.
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:23.160]  I was wondering if I could plug that real quick.
[1:11:23.160 --> 1:11:24.160]  Sure.
[1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:25.160]  Go ahead.
[1:11:25.160 --> 1:11:26.160]  Yeah.
[1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:30.920]  I'm at the Neon Theater in Dayton, Ohio, January 17th.
[1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:33.920]  That's 130 East Fifth Street.
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:35.320]  It'll be from noon to three.
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:39.080]  Be a $5 donation to the Feel Good Foundation.
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:44.720]  I will add free copies of your movie Endgame and possibly a few more movies.
[1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:46.640]  So I encourage everybody to come on out.
[1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:47.640]  All right, buddy.
[1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:48.640]  Good to hear from you.
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:49.640]  Yeah.
[1:11:49.640 --> 1:11:51.440]  I let folks do these free screenings.
[1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:54.600]  I guess that one really isn't, but say la vie.
[1:11:54.600 --> 1:11:56.880]  Just want to get the word out that's the only goal here.
[1:11:56.880 --> 1:11:58.880]  Let's talk to Kathy in Virginia.
[1:11:58.880 --> 1:11:59.880]  Thanks for holding, Kathy.
[1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:01.240]  Thank you for taking my call.
[1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:05.520]  I've had two really burning questions about national service.
[1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:10.760]  Now for me, I'm a 58-year-old woman with a bad back and not too much stamina.
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:11.760]  Two questions.
[1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:16.440]  One, what type of activities would they have me doing for national service?
[1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:18.760]  Okay, let's be clear.
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:19.760]  You won't have to.
[1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:23.200]  It's like if you get tickets and they claim you've got to go clean this out of the highway
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:24.680]  up because you got caught littering.
[1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:28.680]  Well now it'll just be everybody and then if you don't show up, they'll issue a warrant.
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:31.320]  And then if you resist, they will come to your house with guns.
[1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:33.040]  And if you don't come out, they'll kill you.
[1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:36.560]  I mean, this is government, this is like the Soviet Union.
[1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:41.960]  And I've got eight different clips of Rahm Emanuel telling TV that this will be forced.
[1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:46.560]  It was on the Obama Change God website later if we have time, I'm going to play some clips
[1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:47.560]  of that.
[1:12:47.560 --> 1:12:49.560]  In fact, jaren, go to infowars.com.
[1:12:49.560 --> 1:12:51.600]  It's still one of the headlines.
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:56.800]  He reposted a clip of him on C-SPAN admitting it's going to be forced for everybody.
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:12:59.280]  Try to find that if not, because I want to play that for the show ends.
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:02.680]  I forgot to give that to you because people don't believe this.
[1:13:02.680 --> 1:13:07.200]  But Obama's on tape saying that you're going to have the Secure Corps, that's a group
[1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:12.120]  of one million tattletales, as big as the military, domestically, that's a quote from
[1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:13.280]  Obama.
[1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:18.360]  You're then going to have at least a million seniors.
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:21.360]  And so they're going to find the idiots that will sign up to do this first, but then others
[1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:23.520]  will be forced by them.
[1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:24.520]  They're proposing it.
[1:13:24.520 --> 1:13:26.560]  I'm not saying I'm going to be able to get away with it.
[1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:30.840]  And then you're also going to have your junior high and then high school students.
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:33.160]  They say serve hundreds of hours a year.
[1:13:33.160 --> 1:13:37.200]  And they say, don't worry, as soon as you graduate, it's only three months, but then
[1:13:37.200 --> 1:13:42.120]  you're in military boot camp for domestic operations to be called up anytime they want
[1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:43.120]  you.
[1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:44.120]  This is all proposed.
[1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:45.120]  This has been proposed.
[1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:46.120]  They're really pushing it.
[1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:47.120]  And it's bipartisan.
[1:13:47.120 --> 1:13:48.120]  Bill Clinton started it.
[1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:49.720]  George Bush started pushing it.
[1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:52.080]  And now Barack Obama is doing it.
[1:13:52.080 --> 1:13:57.280]  Well, now would they have someone like older persons, are we going to be forced to leave
[1:13:57.280 --> 1:14:01.960]  our homes for months at a time to go serve in the Iraq war, or are we going to be forced
[1:14:01.960 --> 1:14:05.320]  to go out after work and work all evening after working all day?
[1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:06.320]  Yes.
[1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:07.320]  But here's the deal.
[1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:09.520]  They're going to bankrupt the economy to where you've got to go do it.
[1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:12.520]  And the government's going to give you a national ID card.
[1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:16.600]  I saw Homeland Security say this five years ago that will have your credits put on it.
[1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:21.060]  So we're shifting over to a total cashless society where everything you do is tracked
[1:14:21.060 --> 1:14:22.600]  and traced and controlled.
[1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:28.920]  And so they say, okay, fine, you don't want to come out and do work brigade stuff, work
[1:14:28.920 --> 1:14:33.400]  at the highway or spy on your neighbors or spy on farmers and ranchers.
[1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:34.760]  You don't want to be part of this.
[1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:35.760]  Fine.
[1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:39.360]  You just won't get the money on your cred card.
[1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:44.160]  So this is the total control, and that's what Pat Robertson's, the Judas Goat is shelling
[1:14:44.160 --> 1:14:49.760]  mainline conservatives on doing now, I appreciate your call.
[1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:51.920]  Let's go ahead and start playing around the manual right now.
[1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:52.920]  Here it is.
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:53.920]  Go ahead and play that clip.
[1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:56.320]  The word universal comes through a lot.
[1:14:56.320 --> 1:14:57.480]  Universal will scare some people.
[1:14:57.480 --> 1:15:02.720]  They will think the government program, the idea of universal citizen service.
[1:15:02.720 --> 1:15:04.220]  You have to participate.
[1:15:04.220 --> 1:15:06.380]  Citizenship is not an entitlement program.
[1:15:06.380 --> 1:15:09.080]  It comes with responsibilities.
[1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:12.840]  Everybody somewhere between the ages of 18 and 25 will serve three months of basic training
[1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:15.920]  and understanding in a kind of civil defense.
[1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:20.520]  That universal sense of service somewhere between ages 18 and 25 will give Americans
[1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:25.520]  once again a sense of what they are to be American and their contribution to a country
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:27.080]  and a common experience.
[1:15:27.080 --> 1:15:31.280]  And you look at World War II, and that was a draft, because this is not a draft, it's
[1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:32.920]  a universal service.
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:39.600]  It is not an accident that we started our big march towards civil rights and expanding
[1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:44.000]  post-World War II because the country came through an experience together.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:45.840]  So is this compulsory then?
[1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:52.360]  Well, you have to, in a sense, it's a requirement of everybody, 18 to 25, three months, because
[1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:55.880]  I think anytime somebody serves their country in some capacity, we're going to be stronger
[1:15:55.880 --> 1:15:56.880]  for it.
[1:15:56.880 --> 1:15:59.160]  All right, stop right there, because there are two more clips.
[1:15:59.160 --> 1:16:00.400]  Now that was on C-SPAN.
[1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:04.560]  With his head up there saying he wrote a book about it.
[1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:10.560]  Now word for word, but more, it said seniors, junior high, high school, everybody, up until
[1:16:10.560 --> 1:16:12.600]  age 65.
[1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:15.800]  And then they say above 65.
[1:16:15.800 --> 1:16:20.920]  On the website, change.gov, and then it made national news that they then took it off after
[1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:21.920]  we reported on it.
[1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:25.720]  But the point is, we have clips of Obama and Rahm Emanuel saying the same thing in other
[1:16:25.720 --> 1:16:28.160]  clips and now they're moving ahead with it.

[1:20:32.520 --> 1:20:35.040]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[1:20:35.040 --> 1:20:36.240]  Well, search no more.
[1:20:36.240 --> 1:20:40.800]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:44.400]  I mean, what do I say about that C-span clip?
[1:20:44.400 --> 1:20:48.040]  And I've got a problem on this show.
[1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:52.040]  I was looking at all the clips last night because I wanted to address this issue of forced
[1:20:52.040 --> 1:20:56.720]  compulsory service to the federal government under Obama that the federal government's
[1:20:56.720 --> 1:20:58.680]  been setting up for decades quietly.
[1:20:58.680 --> 1:21:01.480]  They shut up the draft boards again, all of it.
[1:21:01.480 --> 1:21:07.160]  And I've probably got two hours of Rahm Emanuel and Barack Obama and others in his administration
[1:21:07.160 --> 1:21:09.800]  saying, well, it's not going to be compulsory.
[1:21:09.800 --> 1:21:11.120]  You just have to do it.
[1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:13.000]  Well, it's not a draft.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  It's universal service.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:20.840]  And then the reporters say, but from the New York Daily News and C-span and ABC, but you're
[1:21:20.840 --> 1:21:21.840]  going to have to do it.
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:24.160]  Yes, you have to by law.
[1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:30.200]  And all they're announcing on TV, all they'll talk about on TV is the 18 to 24, everybody
[1:21:30.200 --> 1:21:34.920]  that graduates has to do military training for the armed services.
[1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:36.840]  It is a draft.
[1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:41.720]  And now they've made the National Guard under Northcom, and they're basically abolishing
[1:21:41.720 --> 1:21:42.720]  it.
[1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:44.960]  They're saying they'll use National Guard on the streets of America.
[1:21:44.960 --> 1:21:49.840]  Well, where's Obama going to get his million-person army as big as the military?
[1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:51.080]  That's it.
[1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:55.400]  But in changing.gov, and we copied it all before they pulled it down, it's the word-for-word
[1:21:55.400 --> 1:22:00.920]  sentence in Rahm Emanuel's book, it states that junior high, high school, they're going
[1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:01.920]  to be involved.
[1:22:01.920 --> 1:22:05.080]  And then we have the program that Clinton started, that Bush expanded called Secure
[1:22:05.080 --> 1:22:09.120]  Corps, where they train them with M16s, warrants, service, checkpoints.
[1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:11.840]  I mean, high schoolers with guns helping the police.
[1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:14.160]  If that didn't pull pot, I don't know what is.
[1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:18.200]  If that isn't Soviet Russia, if that didn't Hitler, you can, I mean, I don't know what
[1:22:18.200 --> 1:22:20.480]  it is.
[1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:22.000]  And I've got clip after clip.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  And then every time we post these clips on infowars.com, people go into the comments
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  section and say, this is an edited video.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  This is fake.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  This isn't real.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  Obama.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:33.200]  We love Obama.
[1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:36.120]  I mean, you people are in denial about this.
[1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:37.120]  Obama.
[1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:38.120]  Obama.
[1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:39.120]  Obama.
[1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:40.120]  Obama.
[1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:41.120]  Obama.
[1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:42.120]  Obama.
[1:22:42.120 --> 1:22:43.120]  Obama.
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:44.120]  Obama.
[1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:45.120]  Obama.
[1:22:45.120 --> 1:22:46.120]  Obama.
[1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:47.120]  Obama.
[1:22:47.120 --> 1:22:48.120]  Obama.
[1:22:48.120 --> 1:22:49.120]  Obama.
[1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:50.120]  Obama.
[1:22:50.120 --> 1:22:51.120]  Obama.
[1:22:51.120 --> 1:22:52.120]  Obama.
[1:22:52.120 --> 1:22:53.120]  Trump's policies.
[1:22:53.120 --> 1:22:57.620]  But stuff is going to get bad under Obama, I have never seen government get more behind
[1:22:57.620 --> 1:22:58.620]  somebody.
[1:22:58.620 --> 1:22:59.620]  Both parties.
[1:22:59.620 --> 1:23:00.620]  You notice he keeps saying, it's all nonpartisan.
[1:23:00.620 --> 1:23:01.620]  We're all going to work together.
[1:23:01.620 --> 1:23:02.620]  Well, that's true.
[1:23:02.620 --> 1:23:05.760]  It's the global corporate take-over of the United States is now happening.
[1:23:05.760 --> 1:23:09.240]  Just like the private foreign banks and the little third world country, they're doing
[1:23:09.240 --> 1:23:10.240]  it now.
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:14.440]  You got the Republicans lining up to support Barack Obama.
[1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:18.600]  The guy who spearheaded the banks taking over this country with the banker bailout, they
[1:23:18.600 --> 1:23:21.400]  immunity and unlimited power.
[1:23:21.400 --> 1:23:23.800]  So let's go ahead and play a clip before we go back to your calls.
[1:23:23.800 --> 1:23:30.800]  A Barack Obama from this weekend's presidential radio address, and it says, we're changing.
[1:23:30.800 --> 1:23:31.800]  We're doing this different.
[1:23:31.800 --> 1:23:36.560]  There'll be total oversight of the trillion bucks.
[1:23:36.560 --> 1:23:37.880]  That's what it says on paper.
[1:23:37.880 --> 1:23:38.880]  He says 700 billion.
[1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:40.040]  We use that number again.
[1:23:40.040 --> 1:23:41.200]  That will be a stimulus.
[1:23:41.200 --> 1:23:46.400]  Now, that's the select groups to carry out setting up the new environmental taxes to
[1:23:46.400 --> 1:23:48.560]  regulate and control this.
[1:23:48.560 --> 1:23:49.560]  These youth cores.
[1:23:49.560 --> 1:23:54.560]  I mean, I've read the fine print, but he said with the banking takeover, it had total transparency
[1:23:54.560 --> 1:23:55.560]  and oversight.
[1:23:55.560 --> 1:23:58.440]  But in there, it says there can be no oversight by law.
[1:23:58.440 --> 1:24:02.260]  Imagine passing a law where there can be no oversight of the private banks.
[1:24:02.260 --> 1:24:04.560]  So here is Obama in the radio address.
[1:24:04.560 --> 1:24:07.560]  And this plan must be designed in a new way.
[1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:10.880]  We can't just fall into the old Washington habit of throwing money at the problem.
[1:24:10.880 --> 1:24:11.880]  Stop there.
[1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:13.160]  We must stop there.
[1:24:13.160 --> 1:24:18.000]  We must not fall in the old Washington habit of throwing money at it.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:19.480]  And then it's going to all his select cronies.
[1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:22.440]  I mean, his administration is so corrupt, but you thought Bill Clinton was bad.
[1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:24.240]  You thought George Bush was bad.
[1:24:24.240 --> 1:24:28.640]  I mean, this guy, Richardson just had to step down because of all this questionable stuff
[1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:33.040]  going on with, you know, he gets tens of millions of money for a construction firm and he gets
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:35.760]  a hundred and something thousand bucks.
[1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:40.880]  I mean, this guy has resco and terrorist and every poverty pimp and every corrupt person
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:42.880]  and, and Governor Blagojevich.
[1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:48.000]  I mean, his best buddy controlled by Rahm Emanuel, Obama and Rahm Emanuel were both
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:54.880]  protégés of Blagojevich and Obama were both protégés of Rahm Emanuel, who's not
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:24:55.880]  even really a U.S. citizen.
[1:24:55.880 --> 1:24:56.880]  He's an IDF soldier.
[1:24:56.880 --> 1:24:57.880]  What is it?
[1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:01.760]  A new prerequisite in our government that you've got to be an IDF government person
[1:25:01.760 --> 1:25:06.160]  because they had a Homeland Security to be the head attorney general, to be the chief
[1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:07.160]  of staff.
[1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:08.400]  I mean, you know, this is getting to be a problem.
[1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:09.400]  I'm against Arnold.
[1:25:09.400 --> 1:25:10.400]  He's from Austria.
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:12.440]  I don't want foreigners over here being our governors.
[1:25:12.440 --> 1:25:13.600]  I'm not just picking on Israel.
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:15.720]  I mean, it's normal to not want this.
[1:25:15.720 --> 1:25:17.720]  Go back to it.
[1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:23.560]  Strategic investments that will serve as a down payment on our long-term economic future.
[1:25:23.560 --> 1:25:28.960]  We must demand vigorous oversight and strict accountability for achieving results.
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:34.000]  We must restore fiscal responsibility and make the tough choices so that as the economy
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:37.120]  recovers, the deficit starts to come down.
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:42.080]  That is how we will achieve the number one goal of my plan, which is to create three
[1:25:42.080 --> 1:25:47.080]  million new jobs, more than 80% of them in the private sector, 600,000 government to
[1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:53.520]  put people back to work today and reduce our dependence on foreign oil again.
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:57.440]  Exactly what the CFR and others have said, government money now, these will really be
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:01.280]  government jobs, all three million, not just a 600,000 will be pure government because
[1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:05.560]  it'll be private select inside corporations that made campaign contributions that will
[1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:06.560]  get that money.
[1:26:06.560 --> 1:26:08.240]  And now you'll be government beholden.
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:11.640]  So now the government's fully taking over what's left of the free market.
[1:26:11.640 --> 1:26:13.760]  They promised that NAFTA and GATT would save us.
[1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:16.600]  They promised that globalism and the service economy would be great.
[1:26:16.600 --> 1:26:20.040]  All that did was let the bankers get total control of our economy, who were totally
[1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:21.040]  dependent on them.
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:22.040]  Back to the liar.
[1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:26.080]  Double renewable energy production and renovate public buildings to make them more energy
[1:26:26.080 --> 1:26:27.480]  efficient.
[1:26:27.480 --> 1:26:32.960]  To build a 21st century economy, we must engage contractors across the nation to create jobs
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:35.920]  rebuilding our crumbling roads, bridges, and schools.
[1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:36.920]  All right.
[1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:37.920]  It paused there.
[1:26:37.920 --> 1:26:40.920]  Bush signed an executive order a year ago when the state started passing laws against
[1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:43.200]  taking our paid for roads and making them toll roads.
[1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:46.680]  Bush signed an executive order saying, if you take highway funds, you've got to give
[1:26:46.680 --> 1:26:51.120]  your existing roads to foreign offshore Spanish and Dutch and other companies to then put
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:52.280]  toll roads.
[1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:53.720]  And then big studies have been done.
[1:26:53.720 --> 1:26:59.720]  You'll have a road that'll make 50, 60, 70 million dollars for a state over 20 years.
[1:26:59.720 --> 1:27:01.280]  They'll get it for 500 million.
[1:27:01.280 --> 1:27:04.320]  It's a fire sale, but it's not privatization.
[1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:07.280]  It's globalist companies coming in and looting the nation.
[1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:08.280]  Back to the liar.
[1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:11.040]  They've not only jobs, but money and lives.
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:15.120]  We will update and computerize our healthcare system to cut red tape.
[1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:16.120]  Stop there.
[1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:17.120]  Yeah.
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:20.560]  Bush, a member six years ago, got a law passed about protecting your privacy.
[1:27:20.560 --> 1:27:21.560]  My dad's a dentist.
[1:27:21.560 --> 1:27:22.560]  I happen to know.
[1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:23.560]  But it's on record.
[1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:26.520]  It actually federalized all your doctors and dentists, put them under federal control
[1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:31.840]  where every prescription you get, whether it's for diaphragm or prescription antibiotics,
[1:27:31.840 --> 1:27:35.840]  is instantly uploaded to the feds, violation of the Fourth Amendment, total surveillance.
[1:27:35.840 --> 1:27:41.120]  So total federalization of healthcare, making everybody computerize and go under their control
[1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:44.760]  and federal regulation, just like know your customer now under the Patriot Act when you
[1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:47.240]  buy a car or a house or a boat.
[1:27:47.240 --> 1:27:51.200]  They put you through anti-terror laws, which violate your privacy.
[1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:54.640]  So it's the government tracking every purchase you make, everything you do.
[1:27:54.640 --> 1:27:55.640]  Back to the liar.
[1:27:55.640 --> 1:27:59.560]  See how it all sounds good.
[1:27:59.560 --> 1:28:01.720]  But if you know what each program does, it's a nightmare.
[1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:02.720]  Back to him.
[1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:05.840]  You produce healthcare costs by billions of dollars each year.
[1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:06.840]  Oh, yeah.
[1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:12.040]  To make America and our children a success in this new global economy, you will build...
[1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:14.720]  Globalism is a private group of banks looting sovereign nations.
[1:28:14.720 --> 1:28:18.160]  They want to destroy economy so they can consolidate them.
[1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:19.760]  That's even in the Financial Times of London.
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:21.040]  They are engineering this.
[1:28:21.040 --> 1:28:22.040]  Back to him.
[1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:25.040]  21st century classrooms, labs and libraries.
[1:28:25.040 --> 1:28:26.040]  All right.
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:27.040]  Stop there.
[1:28:27.040 --> 1:28:31.280]  That's pure federalization and computer labs where your textbooks are on your computer.
[1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:36.120]  All the children get laptops so everything is federally controlled Soviet-style curriculum.
[1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:37.120]  Continue.
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:40.160]  Put more money into the pockets of hard-working families.
[1:28:40.160 --> 1:28:44.800]  We will provide direct tax relief to 95% of American workers.
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:45.800]  Stop right there.
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:46.920]  His tax plan has been analyzed.
[1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:51.600]  It actually taxes the top 20% of earners, and that will cause businesses to shut down
[1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:54.000]  and layoffs to happen, and you just won't have a job.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.800]  But that's okay to be part of his little tattletail court.
[1:28:56.800 --> 1:29:00.080]  Then they want to start a new increase in sales taxes nationwide.
[1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:01.400]  They won't have a federal sales tax.
[1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:03.320]  They would have an increase in gas taxes.
[1:29:03.320 --> 1:29:05.800]  New York State just passed 88 new taxes.
[1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:06.800]  Let's continue.
[1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:11.840]  I look forward to meeting next week in Washington with leaders from both parties to discuss
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:12.840]  this plan.
[1:29:12.840 --> 1:29:17.680]  I'm optimistic that if we come together to seek solutions, come together with total
[1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:24.800]  pork barrel and the complete takeover of the society, Logan and many others, your calls
[1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:26.800]  straight ahead when we get back.
[1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:29.200]  Stay with me.
[1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:33.800]  What will you do when the economy collapses, store shelves are empty, and your stored food
[1:29:33.800 --> 1:29:34.800]  is gone?
[1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:36.440]  How will you feed your family?
[1:29:36.440 --> 1:29:41.200]  True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able to grow a wide range of crops,
[1:29:41.200 --> 1:29:43.880]  ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family.

[1:30:34.920 --> 1:30:38.520]  the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?

[1:30:46.600 --> 1:30:51.160]  In fact, clinically-detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.

[1:32:32.120 --> 1:32:36.200]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective
[1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:37.200]  spray.
[1:32:37.200 --> 1:32:39.040]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:43.200]  We are under the microscope, red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money,

[1:34:15.400 --> 1:34:21.480]  First, elements of Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, Communist China, Fidel's Cuba.
[1:34:21.480 --> 1:34:27.640]  Meanwhile, we always have Pat Robertson criticizing Hugo Chavez of Venezuela for his socialist
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:28.640]  activities.
[1:34:28.640 --> 1:34:32.840]  I don't agree with socialism, but it's actually real socialism where they're really taking
[1:34:32.840 --> 1:34:37.240]  government land and internationalist land that have been robbed before and giving it
[1:34:37.240 --> 1:34:38.640]  to the people with deeds.
[1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:40.880]  Well, see, Pat Robertson doesn't like that.
[1:34:40.880 --> 1:34:45.200]  But when it's, quote, socialism where the big banks take over what's left of the economy,
[1:34:45.200 --> 1:34:50.840]  and we're plantation sharecroppers working for them, well, he's all for it.
[1:34:50.840 --> 1:34:51.840]  That's coming up.
[1:34:51.840 --> 1:34:53.640]  But right now, let's woods through your phone calls.
[1:34:53.640 --> 1:34:55.840]  Let's talk to Logan in Missouri.
[1:34:55.840 --> 1:34:57.480]  Logan, you're on the air.
[1:34:57.480 --> 1:34:59.880]  Hey, Alex, what's up?
[1:34:59.880 --> 1:35:00.880]  Going out worldwide, sir.
[1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:01.880]  Yes, I know.
[1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:06.400]  I was going to cover what I thought the best of the year and the worst of the year was first
[1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:07.400]  and then a prediction.
[1:35:07.400 --> 1:35:08.400]  Go ahead and hit us.
[1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:09.400]  All right.
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:12.080]  I think that the worst of the year, like we didn't cover enough.
[1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:15.920]  I think the con con, even though there's not much info about it, and I think the best
[1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:19.440]  that you did with the RNC and DNC coverage was amazing.
[1:35:19.440 --> 1:35:23.880]  For those that don't know, a con con is a constitutional convention.
[1:35:23.880 --> 1:35:25.600]  There are two states away from having one.
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:27.840]  They could abolish the entire bill of rights.
[1:35:27.840 --> 1:35:29.920]  And if they get one, you know they're going to try it.
[1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:33.520]  We got to fight those where it's happening in Ohio and one other state.
[1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:34.520]  They get those final two.
[1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:35.680]  They win.
[1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:36.680]  Very serious fight.
[1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:37.680]  Continue.
[1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:38.680]  Yes.
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:42.720]  I think that people are going to really see what Obama is like this year.
[1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:46.240]  I hope people actually start waking up.
[1:35:46.240 --> 1:35:47.240]  Hold on.
[1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:48.240]  Obama supporters.
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:50.240]  We had some John McCain supporters.
[1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:51.240]  Hold on.
[1:35:51.240 --> 1:35:52.240]  They're calling in too.
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:53.240]  Hold on.
[1:35:53.240 --> 1:35:54.240]  You guys, stop it.
[1:35:54.240 --> 1:35:56.240]  Don't you know both parties are controlled by the foreign banks?
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:35:57.240]  Stop it.
[1:35:57.240 --> 1:35:58.240]  Wake up.
[1:35:58.240 --> 1:35:59.240]  Go ahead.
[1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:00.240]  I'm sorry.
[1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:01.240]  Yeah, I know how that is.
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:02.240]  I know.
[1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:03.240]  I see Obama supporter hotline.
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:05.640]  Speaking about Friday, man, you really popped me up.
[1:36:05.640 --> 1:36:06.640]  That was some righteous anger.
[1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:07.640]  You know what happened?
[1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:11.000]  There were different YouTube videos of my prisonplanet.tv where we go live the last
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:12.600]  two hours of the radio show.
[1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:17.240]  Over 100,000 views on that video that I saw just in a cursory look and look in one day
[1:36:17.240 --> 1:36:22.200]  because the videos went up yesterday, 100,000 views on YouTube in one day of the three different
[1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:23.200]  videos I saw.
[1:36:23.200 --> 1:36:24.880]  That is power packed right there.
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:26.800]  That means it'll be a million within a week.
[1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:30.000]  I like it when just, you know, one little attack pattern hits the enemy hard.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  Yeah, it was crazy.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.320]  I also really like hearing about the way that they could win it.
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:36.320]  He's really brave.
[1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:37.880]  That's pretty inspiring.
[1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:41.200]  Yeah, 14-year-old there in his school, deprogramming the slaves.
[1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:42.200]  Exactly.
[1:36:42.200 --> 1:36:44.440]  And fighting back inside the reeducation camp.
[1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:46.000]  Yeah, definitely.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:51.560]  And one thing that I've been trying to get St. Louis changed together and it just kind
[1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:54.600]  of fell apart and I was going to be a member of that and that didn't go well.
[1:36:54.600 --> 1:36:55.840]  Well, you know what?
[1:36:55.840 --> 1:36:58.680]  Start another 9-11 Truth Group or Patriot Group.
[1:36:58.680 --> 1:37:01.440]  Logan in Austin, Texas, you're on the air, Logan.
[1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:03.720]  Yeah, I wanted to get your take on something.
[1:37:03.720 --> 1:37:08.960]  And I was looking on a website called the American Patriot Friends Network and I looked
[1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:15.720]  at this before and how it deals with the connection with the IRS, the U.S., Great Britain and
[1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:16.720]  the Pope.
[1:37:16.720 --> 1:37:23.440]  You know, I'm not really familiar with that particular group, but, I mean, what's the
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:24.440]  point?
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:29.880]  Well, it basically has this in a nutshell, the IRS is a company who milks the cows in
[1:37:29.880 --> 1:37:30.880]  the U.S.
[1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:36.120]  You write your check to the private federal reserve and it only goes to interest on the
[1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:37.120]  debt.
[1:37:37.120 --> 1:37:44.160]  Ronald Reagan talked about that when he was first elected until he suddenly got shot by
[1:37:44.160 --> 1:37:47.080]  the gentleman who was having dinner with the Bush family the night before.
[1:37:47.080 --> 1:37:49.000]  That's the mainstream news.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:51.360]  But yeah, very, very serious.
[1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:57.520]  So the United States and Inc. and corporate is the veterinarian who takes care of the
[1:37:57.520 --> 1:38:01.800]  herd and Great Britain is the owner of the farm in the fee.
[1:38:01.800 --> 1:38:10.160]  Well, I mean, here's the problem and I've studied these similar groups.
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:15.360]  But getting a weird feedback there on my line, I guess that's the network feed going off
[1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:16.360]  the satellite.
[1:38:16.360 --> 1:38:21.600]  There, that board in there is having some problems.
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:22.600]  There's a lot of truth to that.
[1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:25.760]  I don't know about this particular group, but there's also a lot of disinfo.
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:29.280]  A lot of people say, well, you can just opt out of the IRS and they'll leave you alone.
[1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:31.880]  You notice that Wesley Snipes tried that.
[1:38:31.880 --> 1:38:34.560]  It's criminal and we didn't have an IRS until 1913.
[1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:36.320]  It is for the private federal reserve.
[1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:37.760]  It is a tax directly to the bankers.
[1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:39.840]  They have used it to take over our society.
[1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:40.880]  It is bad.
[1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:45.040]  But the problem is they use criminal enforcement to come after you if you don't play their
[1:38:45.040 --> 1:38:46.040]  game.
[1:38:46.040 --> 1:38:49.040]  But even if you do pay them, they cheat you a nickel and dime you and go after you.
[1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:55.640]  But big corporations, I saw a report that Goldman Sachs paid 1% tax in 2008 and 2007.
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:38:56.640]  You can just Google that.
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:38:58.680]  It was in the New York Times.
[1:38:58.680 --> 1:39:00.520]  So the big corporations, they don't pay taxes.
[1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:01.640]  It's all selectively enforced.
[1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:05.760]  All they do is basically take the money.
[1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:06.760]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:08.200]  I'm hurrying here through the calls.
[1:39:08.200 --> 1:39:10.400]  Let's talk to James in Hutto, Texas.
[1:39:10.400 --> 1:39:11.400]  You're on the air, James.
[1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:12.400]  Hey, Alex.
[1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:16.720]  I've been listening to a lot of your stuff.
[1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:18.640]  I love that you interviewed Peter Schiff.
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:22.320]  So I've been looking at Peter Schiff a lot, Gerald Salente, Jim Rogers.
[1:39:22.320 --> 1:39:28.760]  I've been saving the clips offline so if they take them off, I could show them to people.
[1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:33.320]  You said something a little while ago about the Gaza Strip.
[1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:43.640]  And I just wanted you to expand on that about Israel took the Gaza in the Six-Day War.
[1:39:43.640 --> 1:39:46.720]  But in your view, what was the cause of the Six-Day War?
[1:39:46.720 --> 1:39:51.160]  From my understanding, Israel was just defending themselves and took over that land.
[1:39:51.160 --> 1:39:55.040]  Is there another viewpoint that I need to hear or, you know?
[1:39:55.040 --> 1:40:01.320]  Oh, there's no doubt, but the Arabs point out that Israel wasn't there until 1947.
[1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:13.320]  Israel wasn't there from 70 A.D. or roughly 17, no, no, excuse me, not 17, 1930 years,
[1:40:13.320 --> 1:40:15.840]  1908 years.
[1:40:15.840 --> 1:40:16.840]  I don't know.
[1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:17.840]  Let's do the math.
[1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:18.840]  Let me just stop on air and try to do the math.
[1:40:18.840 --> 1:40:29.120]  Let me see, in 70 A.D., this happened, so that would be 1900 and 38 years, 1,938 years.
[1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:30.120]  That's right, isn't it?
[1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:31.760]  I'm not good at math while I'm on air.
[1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:33.840]  I think you're the same as me on the math.
[1:40:33.840 --> 1:40:37.400]  So I mean, they weren't there for over 1900 years.
[1:40:37.400 --> 1:40:40.640]  And the Jews that were there lived in peace with the Arabs.
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:46.360]  And then the Bank of England financed terrorism against the British government.
[1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:50.000]  They kicked the British government out and basically just took over a few cities.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:54.600]  And then from there, they started terror attacks all around to drive the Arabs out, and it
[1:40:54.600 --> 1:40:55.600]  worked successfully.
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:40:58.360]  So the Arabs got mad about that in 67.
[1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:00.640]  Now, again, I'm not an Israeli.
[1:41:00.640 --> 1:41:06.480]  I'm not a Palestinian, so I'm just intellectually stating the facts here.
[1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:07.680]  What does that sound like to you?
[1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:09.440]  I mean, does that sound fair and nice to you?
[1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:10.600]  I love hearing both sides.
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:14.720]  I lean more to the Israeli side and stuff, but I don't want to just lean now.
[1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:17.400]  Well, the point is you never hear the other side.
[1:41:17.400 --> 1:41:24.280]  And then our media, our corporate controlled media is on there every day telling us that
[1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:26.400]  Hamas broke the ceasefire when they didn't.
[1:41:26.400 --> 1:41:27.400]  It's on record.
[1:41:27.400 --> 1:41:28.400]  They didn't.
[1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:32.760]  It's on record that Israel shut down the border crossings for people that needed to
[1:41:32.760 --> 1:41:33.760]  go in for work.
[1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:38.080]  That was part of the deal and started targeted assassinations and bombings.
[1:41:38.080 --> 1:41:41.280]  So I mean, why is our media lying to us?
[1:41:41.280 --> 1:41:43.040]  That's insulting our intelligence.
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:44.280]  That's the issue.
[1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:45.560]  The issue is they're lying.
[1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:50.920]  I don't like being propagandized and listen, foreign governments are always trying to take
[1:41:50.920 --> 1:41:52.080]  over nations.
[1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:59.640]  Why did the founding fathers say you had to be natural born 35 years old to run for president?
[1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:03.440]  Because the Austrians at the very time of the founding of this country had just taken
[1:42:03.440 --> 1:42:09.520]  over Poland and two other countries by sending princelings in with money to get financed,
[1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:13.400]  to take over the governments in those fledgling democracies there.
[1:42:13.400 --> 1:42:16.520]  So we have a problem with foreign governments taking us over.
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:21.320]  Now, when we get known, admitted Israelis, dual citizens, being the attorney general,
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:25.400]  Mckazie, being the head of Homeland Security, Chertoff, and now the White House chief of
[1:42:25.400 --> 1:42:26.400]  staff, Ron Manuel.
[1:42:26.400 --> 1:42:27.520]  The list goes on and on.
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:32.080]  That's why you got all these professors and institutions and people saying this is wrong.
[1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:33.920]  I'm against Arnold Alo Schwarzenegger.
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:36.360]  I made a film about it.
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:37.360]  That's how serious.
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:38.560]  It's a three hour film.
[1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:42.160]  The last hour is about Schwarzenegger and his father, the SS officer, I'm against an
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:45.160]  Austrian, you know, being governor.
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:48.080]  I mean, we need American born, but there's no law against that.
[1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:51.000]  Well, I don't, he says he wants to be president on 60 minutes, two weeks ago.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  I'm against Arnold.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  Okay.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:55.520]  So it's not just some particular dislike of Israel.
[1:42:55.520 --> 1:42:59.480]  I don't want Russians coming over here and suddenly popping up everywhere in government
[1:42:59.480 --> 1:43:04.840]  running things and it's becoming a serious issue and I'm tired of it.
[1:43:04.840 --> 1:43:08.200]  And the Israeli lobby gives money to gun control groups and all this other stuff in America.
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:09.200]  I'm sorry.
[1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:11.200]  The second amendment comes first.
[1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:12.200]  Okay.

[1:43:22.320 --> 1:43:23.320]  Total sell out.
[1:43:23.320 --> 1:43:25.880]  To sell Christians on going, well, it's up to the Lord.
[1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:27.680]  God says we're going to come back.
[1:43:27.680 --> 1:43:29.480]  He's for socialism.

[1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:07.720]  Pat Robertson trying to Judas Goat lead his little slaves into the execution pens of the
[1:48:07.720 --> 1:48:08.720]  New World Order.
[1:48:08.720 --> 1:48:11.600]  Mark Ian Origan, you're on the air.
[1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:12.600]  Welcome.
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:13.600]  Hey, Alex.
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:14.600]  Great to speak with you.
[1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:20.520]  Alex, last week, I believe it was that you mentioned in one show that Israel was actually
[1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:27.840]  responsible for at least the main financing that was behind the formation of Hamas.
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:30.440]  And if I'm wrong on that fact, please tell me now.
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:35.240]  No, it's United Press International, Herets, Jerusalem Post, you can Google it.
[1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:36.840]  We posted, reposted those stories.
[1:48:36.840 --> 1:48:39.040]  I mean, I'm just reporting what the Israeli press is saying.
[1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:43.440]  They created it to attack and go after the PLO.
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:44.840]  Right.
[1:48:44.840 --> 1:48:47.080]  And they have perpetuated it, though, actually.
[1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:51.760]  I don't think Hamas could have got into legislative power as they have.
[1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:52.760]  I don't know what the status of it is.
[1:48:52.760 --> 1:48:53.760]  That could be.
[1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:54.760]  We don't know.
[1:48:54.760 --> 1:48:55.760]  I mean, Israel's admitted they created Hamas.
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:58.520]  And for those who don't understand, that's called the great game.
[1:48:58.520 --> 1:48:59.520]  It's divide and conquer.
[1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:01.200]  I don't know what's going on now.
[1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:05.640]  But on the assumption that they are actually perpetrating, because that's what it looks
[1:49:05.640 --> 1:49:09.760]  like, it doesn't look logical to interpret it any other way, because it doesn't make
[1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:12.320]  sense on the face of it that, you know, they wouldn't...
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:13.880]  Well, no, you see, it does make sense.
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:14.880]  I'm not saying what's happened.
[1:49:14.880 --> 1:49:15.880]  We don't know.
[1:49:15.880 --> 1:49:16.880]  It will always come out later.
[1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:17.880]  You know, we don't claim to be all knowing.
[1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:20.320]  We study history and then find out once it's admitted.
[1:49:20.320 --> 1:49:24.440]  So much of the stuff is admitted, just not, you know, widely publicized.
[1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:29.680]  What we know is that the million and a half people there have elected Hamas.
[1:49:29.680 --> 1:49:31.800]  The food and water has been shut off.
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:37.720]  The ceasefire was not followed by Israel on record, the only place in the world where
[1:49:37.720 --> 1:49:41.120]  they lie to the public, to the U.S., everywhere else it's admitted.
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:42.120]  And so what do they do?
[1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:46.640]  They want to bring it to a crisis, I guess, to try to force Israel's hand, but that's
[1:49:46.640 --> 1:49:47.640]  not going to happen either.
[1:49:47.640 --> 1:49:48.800]  But it could be staged.
[1:49:48.800 --> 1:49:49.800]  I don't know.
[1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:58.240]  Well, at the actual pivot point of the Middle East exploding, it seems to be the conventional
[1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:03.120]  with them in recent years that it would always be set off by an incident around Israel.
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:04.760]  Israel would be concerned somehow.
[1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:05.760]  Yeah.
[1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:06.760]  No, I agree with you.
[1:50:06.760 --> 1:50:10.400]  I mean, all of a sudden, they want to reapprove naft and get all of a sudden, Indian and
[1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:14.000]  Pakistan are massing troops talking about going to thermal nuclear war.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:17.760]  All of a sudden, the United States stages attacks against Russian held areas of South
[1:50:17.760 --> 1:50:19.400]  Ossetia and Georgia.
[1:50:19.400 --> 1:50:23.200]  All of a sudden, and Obama says, get ready for something unpopular the day I'm elected
[1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:25.120]  or the day I'm sworn in.
[1:50:25.120 --> 1:50:30.640]  So I mean, regardless, look, Israel, take their president right now.
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:32.280]  He had a 32 percent approval rating now.
[1:50:32.280 --> 1:50:33.680]  It's almost 60 percent.
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:38.480]  So see, this is popular for him with upcoming elections.
[1:50:38.480 --> 1:50:43.320]  So there's no doubting that George in Texas, you're on the air.
[1:50:43.320 --> 1:50:44.320]  Happy New Year, Alex.
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:46.320]  First Sunday broadcast of the year.
[1:50:46.320 --> 1:50:47.320]  Yes, sir.
[1:50:47.320 --> 1:50:48.320]  Yes.
[1:50:48.320 --> 1:50:53.800]  I remember Pat Robinson, I think he posted on your website that Pat Robinson predicted
[1:50:53.800 --> 1:50:56.920]  chaos in the cities around fall time.
[1:50:56.920 --> 1:50:57.920]  It never happened.
[1:50:57.920 --> 1:50:58.920]  Yeah.
[1:50:58.920 --> 1:50:59.920]  He said nukes were going to go off.
[1:50:59.920 --> 1:51:01.360]  I mean, look, about 80 percent of what he says is wrong.
[1:51:01.360 --> 1:51:03.200]  I went back to his predictions last year.
[1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:05.320]  He goes, oh, but I told you the economy be in trouble.
[1:51:05.320 --> 1:51:06.960]  I was right about that.
[1:51:06.960 --> 1:51:12.320]  But now he's saying, if you listen to him, he says Americans will accept socialism because
[1:51:12.320 --> 1:51:15.520]  it will help them and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
[1:51:15.520 --> 1:51:19.600]  And he's selling it as if it's good because he's an establishment person and the entire
[1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:22.440]  establishment is behind domesticating the people.
[1:51:22.440 --> 1:51:23.800]  This is not socialism.
[1:51:23.800 --> 1:51:28.640]  The majority of our tax money will be given to private corporations as a payoff to go
[1:51:28.640 --> 1:51:32.640]  along with the offshore banks stealing 8.5 trillion so far.
[1:51:32.640 --> 1:51:35.400]  Oh, Alex, also too.
[1:51:35.400 --> 1:51:40.560]  It seemed like I listened to his predictions and it looked more like talking points.
[1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:41.960]  No, no, that's it.
[1:51:41.960 --> 1:51:45.560]  He's telling the public what the establishment wants you to hear.
[1:51:45.560 --> 1:51:49.560]  Brandon in South Carolina, he's there to neutralize the control Christian conservatives
[1:51:49.560 --> 1:51:53.480]  because they're great folks by and large and would be quintessential enemies of the New
[1:51:53.480 --> 1:51:56.680]  World Order and socialism and gun control and abortion.
[1:51:56.680 --> 1:52:00.080]  That's why it comes out and says China's doing good with abortion.
[1:52:00.080 --> 1:52:01.080]  Remember that six years ago?
[1:52:01.080 --> 1:52:03.720]  I mean, this guy and people go, well, it's of the Lord.
[1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:04.720]  Abortion's now of the Lord.
[1:52:04.720 --> 1:52:05.720]  No, it's not.
[1:52:05.720 --> 1:52:07.800]  Even if you're not a Christian, it's evil.
[1:52:07.800 --> 1:52:10.880]  But now, see, I'm an evil comic because I'm against abortion.
[1:52:10.880 --> 1:52:11.880]  Conservatism is abortion.
[1:52:11.880 --> 1:52:13.240]  See how they're flip-flopping?
[1:52:13.240 --> 1:52:15.880]  They're really showing their colors right now here in the end game.
[1:52:15.880 --> 1:52:16.880]  Brandon in South Carolina.
[1:52:16.880 --> 1:52:17.880]  Go ahead, Brandon.
[1:52:17.880 --> 1:52:20.880]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:26.840]  I just wanted to admit that a lot of your callers call in all the time and they ask,
[1:52:26.840 --> 1:52:32.160]  you know, what can we do of, you know, you know, get on the internet and talk to people
[1:52:32.160 --> 1:52:34.720]  and spread the information and wake people up?
[1:52:34.720 --> 1:52:38.480]  I'm just here to say that we're awake and it is time to do something.
[1:52:38.480 --> 1:52:39.880]  Well, everybody's not awake.
[1:52:39.880 --> 1:52:41.560]  We've probably woken up 20% of the public.
[1:52:41.560 --> 1:52:43.080]  The rest know something's wrong.
[1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:44.320]  Now is the time to wake them up.
[1:52:44.320 --> 1:52:46.680]  There's a great video of somebody edited.
[1:52:46.680 --> 1:52:50.840]  It's a masterpiece up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com titled How to Stop the New
[1:52:50.840 --> 1:52:51.840]  World Order.
[1:52:51.840 --> 1:52:53.480]  Go watch that video.
[1:52:53.480 --> 1:52:58.840]  Well, well, maybe not, maybe only 20% awake, but you know what, maybe 5% was awake 10 years
[1:52:58.840 --> 1:53:00.960]  ago and people told me, Alex, it's time.
[1:53:00.960 --> 1:53:01.960]  Let's get physical.
[1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:04.520]  Uh, you know, no, you know, we've woken up as many as we can.
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:08.760]  No, we're finally waking everybody up because the enemy's finally admitting their New World
[1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:09.760]  Order.
[1:53:09.760 --> 1:53:10.760]  It's finally out in the open.
[1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:11.760]  Right.
[1:53:11.760 --> 1:53:15.800]  Um, I totally agree with everything you're saying and I don't, I'm not advocating
[1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:16.800]  violence.
[1:53:16.800 --> 1:53:22.640]  I say, you know, back, back in the early times, in the first presidential, uh, during the
[1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:26.400]  first president, you could walk into the White House if you had a problem with the,
[1:53:26.400 --> 1:53:28.120]  with the government and that's right.
[1:53:28.120 --> 1:53:31.120]  They're sequestering themselves in armored fortress because they're owned by offshore
[1:53:31.120 --> 1:53:32.120]  banks.
[1:53:32.120 --> 1:53:33.120]  Yeah.
[1:53:33.120 --> 1:53:37.760]  So what, what we need to do is we need to get together with every, every organization
[1:53:37.760 --> 1:53:44.120]  that has a problem with government and go and sit on the White House lawn until and demand
[1:53:44.120 --> 1:53:48.800]  to speak to somebody and, and, and well, I agree that's part of the solution, but there's
[1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:52.440]  many others take over your local governments peacefully for the political process.
[1:53:52.440 --> 1:53:53.440]  This is all unpopular.
[1:53:53.440 --> 1:53:57.600]  What the globalists are doing, all we've got to do is stand up and say no to their system
[1:53:57.600 --> 1:54:03.200]  or, and we're going to win all jam in Osama in Virginia, Kelly in Michigan and patients
[1:54:03.200 --> 1:54:04.200]  in California.
[1:54:04.200 --> 1:54:08.760]  If I have time, but I've got to go ahead and get to this clip of Pat Robertson playing
[1:54:08.760 --> 1:54:12.480]  the part of the Judas goat, the Judas goat is a trained goat who leads the other goats
[1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:15.280]  in to be slaughtered because they trust him.
[1:54:15.280 --> 1:54:19.920]  He leads them into the slaughter pen and that Pat Robertson have got him on tape saying
[1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:22.280]  thumb scanning to buy and sell as of the Lord.
[1:54:22.280 --> 1:54:26.800]  Those videos are up on my side, uh, that, uh, all of this police state's good.
[1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:29.160]  We need to assassinate foreign leaders.
[1:54:29.160 --> 1:54:31.600]  He does these global warming ads saying it's real.
[1:54:31.600 --> 1:54:33.520]  He's a total sellout.
[1:54:33.520 --> 1:54:38.000]  This guy is totally under the globalist control to neutralize Christian conservatives.
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:42.080]  Then he said six years ago that China had good family planning, good and the forced abortions
[1:54:42.080 --> 1:54:44.420]  is bad, but they're doing what they have to do.
[1:54:44.420 --> 1:54:46.080]  So that was an endorsement of that.
[1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:49.840]  And I had Christians call me and say, yeah, he did say it, but don't you dare bash him?
[1:54:49.840 --> 1:54:51.600]  I mean, this is sick folks.
[1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:55.240]  This guy has gone 180 degrees from what he was 20 years ago when he wrote the new world
[1:54:55.240 --> 1:54:56.240]  order.
[1:54:56.240 --> 1:54:57.400]  So let's go ahead and play this clip.
[1:54:57.400 --> 1:54:58.400]  Now, now, now listen to him.
[1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:02.160]  See, he says, well, they're going to want socialism's, it's going to ease their pain.
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:04.720]  And there's no way you can stop it.
[1:55:04.720 --> 1:55:07.240]  And this big group of people are like, okay, we can't fight it.
[1:55:07.240 --> 1:55:09.600]  God told Pat, you can't stop socialism.
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:10.600]  You can't.
[1:55:10.600 --> 1:55:12.480]  We're going to fight Obama's gun ban.
[1:55:12.480 --> 1:55:13.600]  He did vote for gun ban.
[1:55:13.600 --> 1:55:16.440]  He does support total gun ban in DC and Chicago.
[1:55:16.440 --> 1:55:17.920]  He has set on record under law.
[1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:18.920]  They can ban your guns.
[1:55:18.920 --> 1:55:19.920]  It's a total fraud.
[1:55:19.920 --> 1:55:21.760]  He is coming for your guns.
[1:55:21.760 --> 1:55:24.200]  Bush didn't triple the size of the BATF or nothing.
[1:55:24.200 --> 1:55:25.200]  These guys all worked together.
[1:55:25.200 --> 1:55:26.200]  They're front man.
[1:55:26.200 --> 1:55:27.800]  Go ahead and go to the clip.
[1:55:27.800 --> 1:55:35.400]  So here are some of the things that I feel are going to be happening in 2009.
[1:55:35.400 --> 1:55:43.360]  The Lord said the economy of your nation will recover, the steps taken will lead to a dramatic
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:44.360]  increase.
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:45.360]  Stop there.
[1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:46.360]  Stop there.
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:47.360]  Back it up a few seconds.
[1:55:47.360 --> 1:55:51.480]  See, the steps taken will increase the power of the government, but he goes on to say it
[1:55:51.480 --> 1:55:52.480]  will fix the economy.
[1:55:52.480 --> 1:55:54.160]  He says the economy will get better though.
[1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:55.480]  So the message is it's good.
[1:55:55.480 --> 1:55:57.680]  And then he says, there's no way you can stop this.
[1:55:57.680 --> 1:55:59.400]  Here it is.
[1:55:59.400 --> 1:56:01.360]  This is so sick.
[1:56:01.360 --> 1:56:06.920]  The power of your nation will recover, the steps taken will lead to a dramatic increase
[1:56:06.920 --> 1:56:09.920]  in the power of government.
[1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:15.760]  The people will welcome socialism in order to relieve their pain.
[1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:23.800]  Nothing will stand in the way of a plan by Obama to restructure the economy in the same
[1:56:23.800 --> 1:56:26.400]  fashion as the New Deal in the 30s.
[1:56:26.400 --> 1:56:30.760]  America will never again have the power in the world that it has enjoyed since World
[1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:32.200]  War II.
[1:56:32.200 --> 1:56:36.480]  With no strong leadership, dangerous dictators will arise in various parts of the world.
[1:56:36.480 --> 1:56:37.480]  All right, let's stop there.
[1:56:37.480 --> 1:56:38.640]  Let's stop there.
[1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:43.320]  The globalists have said in hundreds of publications, Financial Times three weeks ago and now for
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:47.680]  world government, and the editor of Foreign Affairs comes out and says, we set up world
[1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:48.680]  government.
[1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:50.360]  We're bringing down the United States.
[1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:51.720]  We're going to bankrupt you.
[1:56:51.720 --> 1:56:55.000]  We're going to set up a world government based basically in the European Union.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:58.120]  All the evils of the world government will be blamed on the U.S.
[1:56:58.120 --> 1:56:59.360]  They will pose as the savior.
[1:56:59.360 --> 1:57:01.480]  That's Obama's job.
[1:57:01.480 --> 1:57:04.080]  And so here he is saying, America's ending.
[1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:06.040]  There's nothing you can do to stop it.
[1:57:06.040 --> 1:57:07.800]  And then he goes on later in the clip.
[1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:10.880]  You can watch it again up on infowars.com.
[1:57:10.880 --> 1:57:13.400]  Roland Ailey also reported on it.
[1:57:13.400 --> 1:57:15.640]  Just type Pat Robertson socialism in the YouTube.
[1:57:15.640 --> 1:57:16.640]  You can watch the full clip.
[1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:17.640]  He goes on and on.
[1:57:17.640 --> 1:57:23.720]  And he says, God directly beamed this into his head, okay, that you cannot stop socialism.
[1:57:23.720 --> 1:57:27.400]  You cannot stop the restructuring, but this isn't the New Deal with people building dams
[1:57:27.400 --> 1:57:30.680]  and bridges and electrical coops and farms, which was bad enough.
[1:57:30.680 --> 1:57:31.680]  Watch the grapes of wrath.
[1:57:31.680 --> 1:57:32.680]  That's accurate.
[1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:36.440]  7 million people started to government engineered the depression with the private fellow reserve
[1:57:36.440 --> 1:57:37.640]  to consolidate wealth.
[1:57:37.640 --> 1:57:39.920]  That's been declassified.
[1:57:39.920 --> 1:57:45.720]  They admit in this disgusting piece, oh, it's just so sick.
[1:57:45.720 --> 1:57:51.440]  It is so absolutely sick to see all of this happening and all of this going on.
[1:57:51.440 --> 1:57:52.720]  They are orchestrating the crisis.
[1:57:52.720 --> 1:57:54.160]  They are domesticating you.
[1:57:54.160 --> 1:57:55.320]  They are enslaving you.
[1:57:55.320 --> 1:57:57.000]  You have to say no to it.
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  It's not your friend.
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:57:59.000]  It's been hijacked by foreign banks.
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  God bless you all.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:01.000]  See you at info work.
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:05.280]  It's no secret that Genesis communications network depends on listeners like you.
